 <start> I walk out and stand in a my front yard
It's plain to see that the times are hard
What's a man to do when he's had enough
You put on your boots and you strut your stuff
I bet on the market that don't crashed
I bought me a house but it ain't worth trash
Baby I don't care long as I stay tough
'Til it turns around I'm gonna strut my stuff
Come on strut your stuff
I got a call today from the hometown bank
And I got no fuel left in the tank
Well the scene looks bad but sure enough
Gonna go out today and strut my stuff
Come on strut your stuff
At the crack of dawn you know you get on up
You put the hot black coffee in your cup
You say a little prayer should the day get rough
Then you step on out man and strut your stuff <start> E i volontari laici
scendevano in pigiama per le scale
per aiutare i prigionieri
facevano le bende con lenzuola
e i cittadini attoniti
fingevano di non capire niente
per aiutare i disertori
e chi scappava in occidente.
Radio Varsavia
l'ultimo appello da dimenticare e i commercianti punici
prendevano sentieri di montagna
per evitare i doganieri
ed arrivare in Abissinia.
La Cina era lontana
l'orgoglio di fantastiche operaie
che lavoravano la seta
le biciclette di Shangai.
Radio Varsavia
l'ultimo appello da dimenticare. <start> Songs were made to sing
While we're young
Every day is Spring
While we're young
None can refuse
Time flies so fast
Too dear to lose
And too sweet to last
Though it may be just
For today
Share our love we must
While we may
So blue the skies
All sweet surprise
Shines before our eyes
While we're young. <start> There's another one due in three month's time
She'll have to paint the spare room blue
She'll work a little overtime
And hope it all works out for Frank and her
If she can keep him home nights
Away from those factory girls
And the gas bills come and the money burns
And Frank just keeps complaining
How little they both earn
And mother drops by Mondays
Just to nag about the world
Then she stays to nag at Dallas
Cause she hates those Texas girls
Poor cow
You'll get your dumb man
You'll see your whole life coming at you
In the back of his hand
Poor cow
It's a monkey see town
You'll walk down the aisle
In the hand me down gown
Of some poor cow
Oh them rich bitch girls
Ain't like our lass
Got no spine for labour
Like us working class
Us gamey lot
Still got our pride
We got our health
It's just the truth that's died <start> And we're driving just as fast as we can
And we're racing to outrun the wind
It's just me and you and you and me
So wild and so young brighteyed and free
And we're trying to get out of here
As a small town romance draws ever near
And I swear we're in a movie
The highlight comes when you kiss me
And the stereo sings our song
And we don't hesitate to sing
Drive to dream to live we could see the world tonight
Hear the hope tomorrow we could see the world
And we're miles from the middle of nowhere
And neither of us seems to care
And that's why I love you so
Shut your mouth girl no one has to know
And times seems to drip like Dali
And neither of us has a place to be
So once and forever tell me all
Tell me all of your dreams
And the stereo sings our song
And we don't hesitate to sing
Drive to dream to live we could see the world tonight
Hear the hope tomorrow we could see the world
Drive to dream to live we could see the world tonight
Hear the hope tomorrow we could see the world
And we're driving just as fast as we can
And we're racing to outrun the wind
And the stereo sings our song
We don't hesitate to sing
Drive to dream to live we could see the world tonight

Hear the hope tomorrow we could see the world
Drive to dream to live we could see the world tonight

Hear the hope tomorrow we could see the world
Drive to dream to live we could see the world tonight

Hear the hope tomorrow we could see the world <start> There's a difference between spending time with me
And killing time while I'm there
Too many people and too many things
And it makes me feel like hell
You're half gone as I can see
And all of this she says to me
Chorus
There's too many questions and too many strings
And they won't keep themselves tied
On a roller coaster ride and it feels like I'm lying
Next to a ghost at night
I don't know why I gave you my heart
'Cause sometimes it feels so wrong
But in spite of all this weather I know why we are together
And I swear right now I'm right where I belong
I know I get a little bit crazy
But I never done you no wrong
Well I get distracted and carried away
And I spin this way too long
But I don't know what you need from me
'Cause all I know is what I can see
Chorus
I'm right where I belong
Go on play it for me son
Chorus <start> yeah
i am psychotic gothic rockstar
come on baby jump into my demon car
i'll take you to my dark dark star
i have photos of naked goth girls
pierced and tattooed on my black bedroom walls
come on baby jump into my demon car
i'll take you to my dark dark star
yeah i am psychotic gothic star
psychotic gothic rockstar
i have a pet python yeah by the name of lucifer
sleeps on my black comforter

come on now jump into my demon car
i'll take you to my dark dark star
i am psychotic gothic rockstar
psychotic gothic rockstar
come on baby jump into my demon car
i'll take you to my dark dark star
yeah <start> Now things have turned for the worse
Thought I was so well rehearsed
I guess I'm probably cursed
I just don't know
I beat my head on the wall
I'm trying not to recall
The inevitable fall
And so it goes
I'm struck so shockingly dumb
I know now I can become
The definition of numb
And you can too
So let's all pull out our teeth
And go to sleep like good sheep
Let's watch our TVs and weep
Oh yes
You better Scream Hallelujah
Scream Hallelujah
You better Scream Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Now get the fuck back in line
And pay your taxes on time
And lay around like you're swine
There is no doubt
You live your life on the screen
And talk about what you've seen
A vicarious dream
You won't live out
They put the rails in your head
And as you travel you're led
You can't control what you're fed
But you won't gag
So lock your yourself up indoors
Ignorant media whores
Before you're gasping in your plastic bag
You better Scream Hallelujah
Scream Hallelujah
You better Scream Hallelujah
Hallelujah
I don't want you to go it alone
So I left a little seed and it's grown
But somehow you don't seem
Like one for watering
I'll never ask you why
But these little things they die
You better Scream Hallelujah
Scream Hallelujah
You better Scream Hallelujah
Hallelujah <start> I'll never get too cold with you
I'll never lose control
And you will never see darling
All these things I'll never show
And you'll just say I'm so naive and yours alone
But I can't be anything to anyone
Just look around
And you won't find anyone who's anything anyhow
You don't really get angry
So I don't have to care
You know you're just seeing things baby
That were never really there
It's just a little show love
Some crying in the bed
Run your fingers through my hair and kiss me once again
Just kiss me
Because I can't be anything to anyone
Just look around
And you won't find anyone who's anything anyhow
And you can't be everything to everyone
I have found
And you won't find anyone doing anything for anybody anyhow
Anyhow
I never really thought too much
About where this would go
But you can call me anytime
I'm still your friend you know
So get up off your knees now baby
And don't you cry no more
Cause I can't be anything to anyone
Just Look around
And you won't find anyone who's anything anyhow
And you can't be everything to everyone
I have found
And you won't find anyone doing anything for anybody <start> Sooner or later more These words to paper pour.
Compose apologies To bring you back to me.
What words were written forOne girl whose pages tore. I'll bet you never knew
With a letter came a fool for you. She says she'd worked it out
This room's not big enough for two. He swears she'd work his words out
If she ever knew. How do I find her Bearing my heart in hand. Last winter
Anne Arbor Was all I had. I still wear your heart around my throat
I still wear your heart around my throat
With barely the air not to choke. Never not ever again.
I finally replaced every promise you've taken away.
Now that it's over I'm older and colder this way.
I finally replaced every promise you've taken away.
How do I find her Bearing my heart in my hand.
Last winter Anne Arbor was all I had. <start> I love you more than ever more than time and more than love
I love you more than money and more than the stars above
Love you more than madness more than waves upon the sea
Love you more than life itself you mean that much to me.
Ever since you walked right in the circle's been complete
I've said goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street
To the courtyard of the jester which is hidden from the sun
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live
When I was deep in poverty you taught me how to give
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole
Quenched my thirst and satisfied the burning in my soul.
You gave me babies one two three what is more you saved my life
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth your love cuts like a knife
My thoughts of you don't ever rest they'd kill me if I lie
I'd sacrifice the world for you and watch my senses die.
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth
We'll play it out the best we know whatever it is worth
What's lost is lost we can't regain what went down in the flood
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large
Nor is it my intention to sound a battle charge
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
And if there is eternity I'd love you there again.
Oh can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
And I was born to be with you you were born to be my bride
You're the other half of what I am you're the missing piece
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see
Just bein' next to you is a natural thing for me
And I could never let you go no matter what goes on
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone. <start> I woke up to a feeling it was cold by my side
You had gone with the sunrise leaving tears in my eyes
I got up with a feeling of an emptiness inside
To the noise of the sidewalk and the silence of my mind
Well I walked out this morning down a street with no name
To a club called The Loser like a dog that's gone lame
Took the club elevator to the floor with a view
I took out life subscription  it's the only one they do
I stepped out on the guard rail saw the crowds slowly part
Heard a voice shouting Don't jump please for God's sake let me move my car
Felt a hand on my shoulder heard a voice cry Just in time
Felt the quick push felt the air rush
Felt the sidewalk fell in line <start> 
Let go of your mind
And see what there is to see
It can be real
Not just a fantasy
Open your eyes
And leave the world behind
Open your mind
Come along for the ride
Do what you want to do
Be what you want to be
Do what you want to do
It's just a short trip from reality
Chorus
I'm on the inside
Looking outside
I'm on the inside looking out
I'm going somewhere
Feeling nowhere
I'm on the inside looking out
I can't be free
Till I know what free is
I can't be me
Till I know who I am
Do you believe
There's more than what you see
All that we need
Is some free association
Painted pictures in a room of glass
Looking throught the floor above
Don't know what has brought me to this place
Ectasy confused by love
Chorus 
I'm on the inside

Looking outside
It's up to you
You can make the changes
You make your dreams come true
What will you do if you don't start
Rearranging the things that you do
It's all up to you
Chorus  <start> and i wait for an end
but what about them
with broken wings
what about them
we've become so indifferent
is there a stance one could take
to break the infrastructure
is there a single thing that you would die for
when all's said
i don't see what you see
but you believe
truthfully
there's a stance you can take
to break the infrastructure
there's a single thing that you would die for
it's blood red
i don't see what you see
but you believe
it's come full circle now
they finally came to break the home
taking everything to dictate you're not your own
your conflicts infinitely built
and your reactions may not be sound
but they're the only thing
between love for family
and finding closure now <start> I thought that number one would surely be me
I thought I could be what I wanted to be
I thought that I could build on lives sinking in sand
But I realize I can't even walk without You holding my hand
I thought that I could do a lot on my own
I thought I I thought I could make it all alone
I thought I thought of myself as a mighty mighty big man
But I realize I can't even walk without You holding my hand
Lord I can't even walk without You holding my hand
Because the mountains are so high and the valleys are so wide
I'm down on my knees I had to say
Lord I can't even walk without You holding my hand
Lord I can't even walk without You holding my hand
Because the mountains are so high and the valleys are so wide
I'm down on my knees I had to say
Lord I can't even walk without You holding my hand
Lord I can't even walk without You holding my hand
Lord I can't even walk without You holding my hand <start> 
I put horse's heads in peoples beds
Cause I am the mob
When duty calls gonna bust some balls
Cause I am the mob
Don't try and tell me it's one for the money two for the money three for the money
Am I your Easter bunny come on.
I try my level best my best to please
But I'm gonna put a bullet between your knees
baby come on just tell them
Stop blowing the Don put his keks back on
Cause I am the mob
Stop mucking around with the brand new sound
Cause I am the mob
Try and tell me it's one for the money two for the money three for the money
Am I your Easter bunny come on oh baby come on
I try my level best my best to please
But I'm gonna put a bullet between your knees
baby come on just please tell them
That Luca Brasi ah he sleeps with the fishes
Luca Brasi ah he sleeps with the fishes
Luca Brasi ah he sleeps with the fishes missus
Oh tell them just tell them
Luca Brasi ah he sleeps with the fishes
Luca Brasi ah he sleeps with the fishes
Luca Brasi ah he sleeps with the fishes missus
I am the mob <start> Fearless love fearless love
Fearless love makes you cross the border
At your church they asked for volunteers
To make a presence in the park
That's where the wicked planned to demonstrate
And carry signs to set a spark
Someone behind you heaved a stone
That struck the thin man behind his ear
So now there's blood upon his sign
Which read There's nothing here to fear
The wrath of God somebody yelled
Will punish all of those like him
But if you travel back  years
I swear you'd hear this all again
Back then they'd say
These soldiers walk on sacred ground
This land's our history and our home
They have no right to be around
They are the evil force of Rome
So just how strong this change of heart must be
That one that Jesus once described
Kindness to your enemy
Carry his pack an extra mile
When fearless love fearless love
Fearless love makes you cross the border
Your mind snaps back to where you stand
Your church is here to fight a cause
And at your feet a fallen man
Whose head is cradled in his arms
Though his blood contains his death
And though the lines are drawn in hate
You drop your sign of Bible verse
And help the wounded stand up straight
When fearless love fearless love
Fearless love makes you cross the border
Oh yes the high religious still will scorn
Just like they did all that time back
They'll say you helped the other side
They saw you haul that soldier's pack
But now how could you carry that man's sign
In your heart the choice was clear
You didn't join the other side
The battle lines just disappeared
When fearless love fearless love
Fearless love makes you cross the border <start> I just cannot believe
That you want me
Beg at your door
I just cannot believe
That you want me
Forever more
Time and time I tried to make you mine
I didn't think it would be such a short time
Before you came my way
Up where the moon is shining so bright
That's where my heart is tonight
Up where the moon is so bright
That's where my heart is tonight
I thought my day would come
When I would be
The only one
I thought my day would come
Under the moon
And under the sun
Now I shout through all the streets today
Lucky me your love has come my way
Now tell me I was a fool
Up where the moon is shining so brightly
That's where my heart is tonight
Up where the moon is so bright
That's where my heart is tonight
I believe that dreams come through
I believe because of you
He who made the stars in sky
Made the world for you and i
I just cannot believe
That you want me
Beg at your door
I just cannot believe
That you want me
Forever more
Time and time I tried to make you mine
I didn't think it would be such a short time
Before you came my way
Up where the moon is shining so bright
That's where my heart is tonight
Up where the moon is so bright
That's where my heart is tonight <start> Mr. Dali Lamas

Amputees in Freetown
Sierra Leone's
The church wasn't honest
The state put the youth in a harness
Creatin' hostility among us
Teacher said no college
Still the kid's gotta get a check with a couple commas
People wanna bomb us
More people gotta scatter and run from us
You can blame it on Zeus and Apollo and Adonis
But what you've done here
Is put yourself between a bullet and a target
And it won't be long before
You're pulling yourself away
But what you've done here
Is put yourself between a bullet and a target
And it won't be long before
You're pulling yourself away
I've been knowing her for years
I've been seeing her for years
She got dark dark wavy hair
With a voice like she just don't care
She got a skirt with a halter top
She's got a dad who never gave a fuck
She drinks a beer with a malted top
She got knocked up in a pickup truck
But she got engaged when she was nineteen
To this dude who was acting insane
Had a . that he always cleaned
Said one day one day one too many days
Now she ducked and she ran away
Never to be heard from never to be seen
I check the cover of a magazine
I'm just wondering how just wondering how
But what you've done here
Is put yourself between a bullet and a target
And it won't be long before
You're pulling yourself away
You're pulling yourself away
You're pulling yourself away
You're pulling yourself away
A bullet and a target
A bullet and a target
A bullet and a target
A bullet and a target
Between a bullet and a target <start> Can't ask for more so why unfulfilled
We take apart everthing we build
Had it right here but now it's gone
On and on
Break <start> Miracle rain makes snowballs falling slowing out of the sky
All you people wandering by
Make sure you don't get one in the eye
There's a new world forming out of the way
Future love that's born every day
Too many miracles happening here
It's the same old story different year
Oh I'm glad you are here
Been this way since the day I was born
I'm ready to be in love again
I know we could be in love
Photographing snowflakes lately I'm slowly losing my mind
There's so many different kinds
Falling all the time
There's a rainbow forming without any rain
A new dimension again
There's too many miracles happening here
It's the same old story different year
Oh I'm glad you are here
Been this way since the day you were born
The age of romance is dead and gone
Maybe a chance I'm wrong
People falling out of love I don't know whose side you were on
Got to call these people along
And tell them where they've been going wrong
There's no shame in changing and being alone
Just pull yourself one for the road
Hasn't it been a strange old year
Well too many miracles happening here
I'm so glad you are here
Been this way since the day we were born
Are you ready to be in love again
I'm ready to be in love <start> Hay un pequeo loco en m
Hay mentiras que viv

Hay un milln de luces que
Quieren venir conmigo

Cambi el sentido de vivir <start> I'm a color reporter 
But the city's been bled white 
And the doctor orders 
He drinks all night to take away this curse
But it makes me feel much worse
Bled white
So I wait for the ftrain 
And connect through a friend of mine 
To a yesterdaydream 
'Cause I'll have to be high to track the sunset down
And paint this pailing town
Bled white
So here he comes with a blank expression
Especially for me 'cause he knows
I feel the same
'Cause happy and sad come in quick succession
I'm never going to become
What you became
Don't you dare disturb me 
While I'm balancing my past 
'Cause you can't help or hurt me 
Like it already has it may not seem quite right
But I'm not fucked not quite
Bled white
Bled white <start> Let love explode and bring the dead to life

Just want to hold you tonight

Start up my lovin'

Hot and you're lovin' me now
My collector 
Over the top now
Straight up it's hands down
Straight up the land of love
Hot and bothered
Hot and bothered
Just want to hold you tonight
I don't want no top bunch
Love how your lips go
Whisperin' kisses
Love me come close to me
I'm hot and bothered
Hot and bothered
Hot and bothered
Just want to hold you tonight <start> All these buckets of rain I've heard enough about.
You say that I lied.
I am a gentleman didn't I ask for a place I could stay
What were we both thinking
The next part just got in the way.
You were just always talking about changing changing
What if I was the same then same then
The same I always was
All these things that you say
Like I'll forget about the mindnumbing games that you play.
I am a gentleman didn't I pay for every laugh every dime
Every bit every time and then you feed me some line.
I won't hear one more word about changing changing
Guess what I am the same man
Same man same man I've always been.
Days pass and turn into weeks when we don't even speak.
We just lay wide awake and pretend we're asleep.
You go home alone and you're checking your phone
And you're looking at me like I'm something you own.
All these buckets of rain
You can't forget about it
You say I never tried.
I am a gentleman
Didn't I answer every time that you call
Pick you up when you fall
But you never listen at all
You were just always talking about changing changing
Guess what I am the same man same man.
Changing changing
Guess what I am the same man same man.
Changing changing
Guess what I am the same man same man. <start> I want to know how it will be
Me and her or you and me
You both sit there with your long hair flowing
Your eyes alive your minds are still growing
Saying to me
What can we do now that we
Both love you I love you too
But I don't really see
Why can't we go on as three
You are afraid embarrassed too
No one has ever said such a thing to you
Your mother's ghost stands at your shoulder
Got a face like ice just a little bit colder
Saying to you
Can not do that it breaks all the rules
You learned in schools
But I don't really see
Why can't we go on as three
You know we love each other it's plain to see
There's just one answer comes to me
Sister lovers some of you must know about water brothers
And in time maybe others
So you see what we can do
If we try something new that is if you're crazy too
And I don't really see why can't we go on as three <start> Sit alone waiting on the morning
Woman leaving her whole life behind
train rolling on taking mama's baby home
no one knows what's going through her mind
Just another love song I'm singing
And you know people sing them all of the time
Just another lonesome guitar ringing
The only difference is this one is mine
Freedom Lord what a funny word
We search for it just like some kind of fool
Woman leaving home man sit's there all alone
Little child is paying all the dues <start> Moss
What a big man you are
Could fight a war with just your face
Take it on the chin and leave me openjawed.
What big words you've got
Reciting lines you've heard on film
Could write a script with just your lust for respect.
Rip off this face it can't persist
Like shadows in the rain undefined lines
A symphony muted and greying.
You're not real and neither are your goals. <start> I run at things too fast
Only give them half a chance
Say what you want what you will
But it's true.
I'm far too lazy
I do enough but nothing more.
I like to drink I like to play
Do you too
You never know
Just what the blues are like
Until you take
A taste of the sweet life.
I found an angel
A reason to smile
A best friend.
Until I knew her I never knew
What a woman can do
Did what she want did what she will
Is it true
She holds her own she holds mine too
We do a marry dance.
Do what we want do what we will
Do you too
I brush her hair
And it crackles with the static
I never meant to kiss her
It was purely automatic.
She's my angel
She's my Betty Blue
She's my best friend.
Her fingers drumming time drumming time
Drumming on my heating heart.
I got it good I've got it bad
It's true uhhuh.
You never know
Just what the blues are like
Until you take
A taste of the sweet life.
I found an angel
A reason to smile
A best friend.
She's gone
She's out of sight
She's my love me tender
My P. G. fright
My lady day in the dead of night
My best friend.
She's my best friend. <start> Its gonna be a long drive home
Without you shotgun or buzzing my phone
It's a nightmare
Do I even got a voice here
I put up a wall
But wouldnt have guessed that you would take offense and start a fight there
I had my finger aimed toward you but you missed the point dear
I dont want to seem unfriendly but I dont want to be your friend
Im in a fantasy dreaming of a happy ending
But you were my reality and you set in
Sugar let your hair down show me that you care now
Want a fairy tale Im ready to rhyme
The stars will glow the wind will blow
At the top of your tower Im tempted to climb
Let your hair down love is in the air now
Im well aware now well be all right
If you go down Ill stand my ground
Cause I dont want to settle for the next best ride
That was a dead end road
And it left me a wreck and with nothing to show
But the state I was in through the words I wrote
They help me grow
Or grow apart. Some songs break hearts you know
Well this one was state of the art
I dont want to seem unfriendly but I dont like playing pretend
I guess Im just a sucker for a sappy ending
Or bitter that its out of my hands
I guess I gotta settle for the next best ride cause Im giving up
Today Im gonna treat you friendly. Ill take whatever I can get
But I wont be sweet for long with my sugar gone
Ill have this sour after taste til the bitter ends
So if youre dead set on leaving run away while you can
I know when this wears off and I see what a loss caused me to give up
Im gonna give in. So run quick
Run away while you can
Just run kid Run Kid Run
Come back <start> Now here you go again you say
You want your freedom
Well who am I to keep you down
It's only right that you should
Play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound
Of your loneliness
Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost and what you had and what you lost
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean you'll know you'll know
Now here I go again I see the crystal visions
I keep my visions to myself it's only me
Who wants to wrap around your dreams and
Have you any dreams you'd like to sell
Dreams of loneliness
Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost and what you had and what you lost
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean you'll know <start> I don't need no million dollars just need a couple of bucks
Don't need no life insurance I just need a little luck
I don't care if the sun don't shine as long as it don't rain all week
And I don't care if I don't reach the top
But when it comes to you and me oh ya
I don't need a piece of your heart oh ya
I'm in need of every part I want it all I want it all
I want everything you got
I don't need a piece of your heart I want it all
I don't wanna go through no long good bye's
I don't mind being apart
I don't need no fancy car
As long as we can make it start oh ya
I don't need a piece of your heart oh ya
I'm need of every part I want it all I want it all
I want everything you got
I don't need a piece of your heart I want it all
So I'll sister come to me put everything in harmony irie <start> I've seen the rain in vales of a deeper joy
Don't mourn for me or my demise
I'll away until we've found our deliverance
The tears of your pain will melt the ice
I'll never see when you smile when you're laughing
I'll never see when you cry all day
I fall asleep but you still got my spirit
I'll always sleep until we meet again
I turn around and see your face for the last time
You think good bye but your lips are kept closed
I go away 'cos my fate was programmed before
Eternity took place in me <start> Give me sugar
Give me something sweet
I've spent a lifetime
Feeling incomplete
If I sound better
Or if I've come too late
Please reconsider
I don't need much on my plate
Just give me sugar
Don't come close
Please keep at a distance
Look but don't touch
'Til the light goes on
Sorrow's a lamb and please wait at the window
Don't touch the glass 'til the curtain calls
Wait wait don't make me wait
Wait wait don't make me wait
Just give me sugar
Give me sugar
Give me something deep
Don't make a habit
Of crawling on my knees
But this is different
Can't you see I'm in control
This is the moment
Where all your dreams have flown
Just give me sugar
Don't come close
Please keep at a distance
Look but don't touch
'Til the light goes on
Sorrow's a lamb and please wait at the window
Don't touch the glass 'til the curtain calls
Wait wait don't make me wait
Wait wait don't make me wait
Just give me sugar
Don't look around
Sugar don't look around
Said sugar don't look around
Sugar don't look around
Oh won't someone love me
Won't someone love me
Won't someone love me
Won't someone love me
Like you
Like you
Like you
Like you
Someone like you <start> Man meets boy
Shattered summer broken dreams
Too young to know
What he wants is so extreme
He held you down
Told you not to scream or cry
From that day forward baby
You just wondered why
Oh child it's not your fault
Don't rub your wounds with salt
He can't hurt you anymore
I am your friend my love will be your cure
He can't hurt you anymore
Give me your hand I'll help you fight your war
'Cause he can't hurt you anymore
Man meets boy
Quiet churches empty streets
And secrets stored
Behind close doors between the sheets
Oh no one knows till it's too late
The damage deepens
In the end something's beneath
The surface creeping
You held it in so long
I knew that something's wrong
He can't hurt you anymore
I am your friend my love will be your cure
He can't hurt you anymore
Give me your hand I'll help you fight your war
'Cause he can't hurt you anymore
Baby you're not alone
It's too late the damage deepens
Don't turn your heart to stone
Something beneath the surface creeping
He can't hurt you anymore
I am your friend my love will be your cure
He can't hurt you anymore
Give me your hand I'll help you fight your war
'Cause he can't hurt you anymore <start> You're the one I've been waiting on
What took you what took you so long
I'd just about given up on this
Oh yeah oh yeah don't you wish
That you could go and forget about me
But that but that'd be too easy
Don't you know that you're all mine
Mine until 'til the end of time
Because now I've got you and I'm never gonna let you go
You can try to run just remember that I told you so
I look at you and I see myself
Oh boy boy do you need help
Cause your mind's as twisted as mine
Never thought never thought I'd find
Any man that could get me to bite
At least every at least every night
So I'm afraid you're stuck with me
Hope that makes you hope that makes you happy
Because now I've got you and I'm never gonna let you go
You can try to run just remember that I told you so
You're the one I've been waiting on
What took you what took you so long
I'd just about given up on this
Oh yeah oh yeah don't you wish
That you could go and forget about me
But that but that'd be too easy
Don't you know that you're all mine
Mine until 'til the end of
Mine until the end of time
Because now I've got you and I'm never gonna let you go
You can try to run just remember that I told you so
Gonna keep you gonna keep you for myself
Gonna keep you gonna keep you for myself
Never letting you go <start> Never you mind at the storm honey
Never you mind the lightning
Dawn gonna make the day warm honey
Sun gonna make the day bring
Hold you till it comes
Just water falling down
The orange in the sun
Never makes a sound
Never you mind at the noise honey
The man and the moon and the stars
Are putting away all their toys honey
The lightning back in their jars
Hold you till they're done
Just water falling down
The orange in the sun
Never makes a sound
As it shines all around
Rise and awake in the morning honey
Wash away sleep from your eye
Keep any dreams that you
Might have made baby
Little one please don't you cry
Hold you till the dawn
Just water falling down
The orange in the sun
Never makes a sound
As it shines all around
Take away all of the darkness honey
Remove any nightmares power
Break any curse with me won't you honey
By the light of the morning hour
Hold you till the dawn
Just water falling down
The orange in the sun
Never makes a sound
Every night has to end honey
Every storm has to pass
You don't have to pretend honey
That a tear in the rain has to last
Hold you till the dawn
Water falling down
The orange in the sun
Never makes a sound <start> I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When you're here
All those words they seem to slip away
When I get near you
The games begin to drag me down
It's all right
I'll make you maybe next time around
But if I seem to act unkind
It's only me it's not my mind
That is confusing things
I want to tell you
I feel hung up and I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever I've got time
Sometimes I wish I knew you well
Then I could speak my mind and tell
Maybe you'd understand <start> Mighty men of power
great Goliaths who've turned sour
never feeling never caring
only blindly you're following one flight of power
crushing all who stand there before you
taking breaking you
even make the strong men cower
grind to dust those who can't pay your due
With careful plans your lies
there's no risk and no mistake
ignore the small man as he cries
smash him and then he'll cooperate
giant stop for a moment
search deep within your heart
are you so sure you're right
you could make a new start
if you left this Earth
who would care
what d'you think you're worth
just a share
you don't have much time
face the truth
you'll pay for your crime
you must choose
there's another way of living
see what you get by giving
take your chance find your way
take it while you may
forget that thing called pride
just awaken what's inside
stop deceiving start believing
your humility will be your last misleading guide
the seeking mind could then show you how
freely gladly now
fulfill yourself be satisfied
give all the love that you can mend all
with simple joys your life
will be rich and so much more
welcome the feeling see it thrive
the peace that you've been searching for <start> I'm in work in an hour and a half
And the gin is still fresh on the end of my scarf
How long can we keep up with this
And if we didn't is there anything we would miss
The sun comes up over Raven South
You're a raving misbehaving mouth
I never thought that we'd like each other
But lo and behold
This love will last forever and ever and ever
Here come the young men
I'll never show my back to the painting
Youth encompassed ready and straight in
She looks at me like nobody else can
Eye to eye eye to eye..
Are we getting older
Are we getting wiser
Or are we getting none of the above
And does it matter when
This love will last forever and ever and ever
Here come the young men
This love will last forever and ever and ever
Amen
And so the party's finished
Seratonin has diminished
The curtains become see through
And there's a cadbury's flake in the corner
And we'll be doing it all again
A weekend in burnage was our den
A bond we made together
This love will last forever and ever and ever
Amen
Here come the young men... <start> know we'll love again
Maybe tomorrow
I don't know where or when
Maybe tomorrow
Maybe tomorrow
You say you say you're gonna cry
Because they've made us say goodbye
Our love will stand their test of time
Our ages won't be there to draw the line
I know we'll love again
Maybe tomorrow
Maybe tomorrow
You say you say you're gonna cry
Because they've made us say goodbye
Our love will stand their test of time
Our ages won't be there to draw the line
I know we'll love again
Maybe tomorrow
I don't know where or when
Maybe tomorrow
Maybe tomorrow <start> You drag your nails across my back
I can feel your teeth upon my neck
I am in ecstasy
You blow my mind heat me up
Take my spirit to the top so high
I am in ecstasy
Chorus
We fly... Till we die
We fly... Till we die
More than more is not enough
I need your mind expanding stuff
To fly...to fly
All my strength down the drain
No escape I tried in vain
I am in ecstasy
Chorus
In your hand helplessly
Sweat and blood I cannot flee
On my skin sweetest pain
A million needles like burning rain
Chorus <start> The smoky mist it hovered over the distant echoes of your voice flow through
my soul
The wind blows silent like a mystery standing on a mountain top within my
dream
They comfort me
And I don't know how I'm supposed to feel
None of this makes any sense at all to me
Lullabies sung by a distant memory seems to hold me when I'm down
In this world of quiet sadness
Golden chalices filled with madness they come for me
Broken hearts lie all around me
A flowing pastel red upon the ground in the place I'm in
I gazed up into the night sky
Shivering cold from a brave man's destiny
As I opened up my eyes a strange light seemed to shine all over me
I heard this voice from nowhere surrounding all that wasn't there
Confirming all believing it was the time it said
You have to
Crawl crawl before you walk walk before you run run before you die
You have to feel feel before you hurt hurt before you learn learn before
you try
I feel like a wheel turning turning on midnight  distorted  faces
I feel like a wheel lights up my eyes happiness befalls me in some peculiar
way
I feel like a wheel turning turning on midnight
You have to
Crawl crawl before you walk walk before you run run before you die
You have to feel feel before you hurt hurt before you learn learn before
you try
Now the mist was clearing I could see the stars that lit the sky
I waited silent calls for a voice a vision I could not find
Never heard but I wasn't jaded and that voice of reason never left my mind
You have to
Crawl crawl before you walk walk before you run run before you die
You have to feel feel before you hurt hurt before you learn learn before
you try
Oh no it's looking right at us but you don't have to like this <start> Hey me
Eu tenho uma guitarra eltrica
Durante muito tempo isso foi tudo
Que eu queria ter
Mas hey me
Alguma coisa ficou pra trs
Antigamente eu sabia exatamente o que fazer
Hey me
Tem uns amigos tocando comigo
Eles so legais alm do mais
No querem nem saber
Mas agora l fora
Todo mundo  uma ilha
H milhas e milhas e milhas
De qualquer lugar
Nessa terra de gigantes
Eu sei j ouvimos tudo isso antes
A juventude  uma banda
Numa propaganda de refrigerantes
As revistas as revoltas as conquistas da juventude
So heranas so motivos pras mudanas de atitude
Os discos as danas os riscos da juventude
A cara limpa a roupa suja esperando que o tempo mude
Nessa terra de gigantes
Tudo isso j foi dito antes
A juventude  uma banda
Numa propaganda de refrigerantes
Hey me
J no esquento a cabea
Durante muito tempo
Isso foi s o que eu podia fazer
Mas hey hey me
Por mais que a gente cresa
H sempre alguma coisa que a gente
No consegue entender
Por isso me
S me acorda quando o sol tiver se posto
Eu no quero ver meu rosto
Antes de anoitecer
Pois agora l fora
O mundo todo  uma ilha
H milhas e milhas e milhas
Nessa terra de gigantes
Que trocam vidas por diamantes
A juventude  uma banda
Numa propaganda de refrigerantes
Mega ultra hiper micro baixas calorias
Kilowats gigabites
Trao de audincia
Trao nas quatro rodas
E eu o que fao com esses nmeros
Eu o que fao com esses nmeros
Nessa terra de gigantes
Eu sei j ouvimos tudo isso antes
A juventude  uma banda
Numa propaganda de refrigerantes
Hey me <start> Thieves of war
Love so ever lasting
Written from a
Distant shore
It's a constant hunger
I'm freezing every night
Roaring canon thunder
But I don't wanna fight
The fear is daunting me
Afraid to even more
You image haunting me
It gets me thru
I find my strength
I find my truth
In every memory of you
You are my world
You are my heart
In every moment now
'Cause you are my meaning
You are my reason to go on
So when bullets fly
And brave men die
It's you that guides me
Through this war
A photograph is all she has of him
So lonely years
And her memory grows dim
Still her heart keeps praying
She'll be holding him again
In her dreams he's saying
Love never ends
I find my strength
I find my truth
In every memory of you
You are my world
You are my heart
In every moment now
'Cause you are my meaning
You are my reason to go on
The tears I cry
They never die
It's you that guides me
Through this war
Words frozen there
In time
Their love affair
Still clings to the light
In the bright stars at night
And I feel them
It's so clear
True love
Always living deep inside
I find my strength
I find my truth
In every memory of you
You are my world
You are my heart
In every moment now
'Cause you are my meaning
You are my reason to go on
The tears I cry
They never die
It's you that guides me
Through this war <start> I sent a message to another time
But as the days unwind this I just can't believe
I send a note across another plane
Maybe it's all a game but this I just can't conceive
I drive the very latest Hover car
I don't know where you are
But I miss you so much till then
I met someone who looks a lot like you
She does the things you dobut she is an IBM
She's only programmed to be very nice
But she's as cold as ice whenever I get too near
She tells me that she likes me very much
But when I try to touch she makes it all too clear.
She is the latest in technology
Almost mythology but she has a heart of stone
She has an IQ of 
She has a jump suit onand she's also a telephone.
Chorus
Is that what you want  is it what you really want.
I realize that it must seem to strange
That time haz rearrangedbut time haz the final word
She knows I think of youshe reads my mind
She tries to be unkindshe knows nothing of your world
Although her memory banks overflow
No one would ever knowall she says is that what you want
Maybe one day I'll feel her cold embrace
And kiss her interfaceuntil then I'll leave her alone.
Chorus <start> Tiny European cars
Are dropping from the sky
They're wonderfully efficient
Engines fueled by Spanish wine
Maybe just a sip
To help us get a grip
Did you know Isaac Newton
Was a virgin when he died
A hundred thousand naked woman
Running on the beach
In such a state of wild abandon
They ignore my speech
About the overt flow
A dangerous undertow
And how there is a hole so deep
It swallows up the sun
Oh the smoke seems sweet to me
Must be a perfume factory
Just one of many ancient travesties
We're all descendants of the pharisees
Tiny European cars
Are bouncing off my shins
If you've never seen a bull fight
Guess who always wins
To grab it by the horns
Its life like censored porn
Did you know they sing
RingAround the Rosie when you die <start> Comes a time in
Everyone's life
We're paid to feel free
Fall asleep now
Calming leaders
Be who you wanna be
We'll live forever forever forever
We'll come together together together
We'll live forever
 
We'll come together together
 

So many changes
Taking places
We need to walk away
With all these reasons
Time and seasons
We need who we would bleed for
We'll live forever forever forever
We'll come together together together
We'll live forever
 
We'll come together together
 

Love's pressure
Is just kisses
And what's last's to come and
Look back with a lighter soul
Harbor motion into the great unknown
We'll live together forever forever 
We'll live together together forever 
We'll live forever



We'll live together forever forever
We'll live together together forever
We'll live forever forever forever
 


 <start> I feel so far away from love
'Cause I can never get enough
Like the kid with his hand in the highest jar
And if I came back from the grave for a while
Would you could you make a dead man smile
I'd wear you on my arm like a brand new scar
My oh my oh my I've had a few
But my oh my oh my this one's for you
My heart is on its sleeve
I need you to believe
That the dark times will fade
So crack the shell of the hardest heart
Slip inside when they're caught off guard
Kill all the urgent lies that stain their blood
And if you think that you know everything
Don't give me this chance to sing
I'm not a fool a fool to lighten up
And I can't stop staring at you
And your expression looks a little confused
This little story will end so well <start> In the daytime time for celebration.
No use looking down if it's over here.
It's a world a new creation
And the golden light of the morning
Makes it easy to comb your hair.
And the love of a child.
It's the time of the year.
In the daytime you can move a mountain
With a blink of your eye.
Now it's over here now it's over there.
It's a world with no complications
And the curtains on the window
Start blowing like your hair.
And the love that I feel.
'Cause it's the time of the year.
Mysterious moon found me crying in the dark.
Heard my footsteps on the stairs.
Mysterious moon found me crying.
But the sun dried my tears
Showed he cares.
In the daytime time for celebration.
No use looking down children open your eyes.
It's a world a whole nation.
Now the white boats have landed
And the innocent are here.
So dream for the child
'Cause it's the time of the year. <start> Trying to find you left me lost
But I just want you home now
Though I'll see you again but
I can't wait forever.
I can't wait I can't wait
I can't wait anymore Baby 
I can't wait I can't wait
I can't wait anymore.
I wish you were still here
Not just on my mind
Though I'll see you again but
I can't wait forever
Ooooooh 
Trying to find you left me lost
But I just want you home now. <start> Everyday will be like a holiday
When my baby
When my baby comes home
Now she's been gone
For such a long time
Ever since she's been gone
She been on my mind
I got a letter today
Just about noon
She said Don't worry
I'll be home soon
And everyday will be like a holiday
When my baby
When my baby comes home
I'll never have to worry
About sitting by the phone
When she gets here
I'll never be alone
She said she'd get here
Sometime today
I know when she gets here
She'll never go away
And everyday will be like a holiday
When my baby
When my baby comes home
Oh everyday will be like a holiday
When my baby
When my baby comes home <start> He wouldn't say he cared at all if you asked him.
You're heading for a fall brother it goes right past him.
In another world he's in another place
You now the need for speed. Is just another form of greed
But when you jones'n your brains frozen.
You're not thinkin' bout the choices you makin' you're just rollin'.
On and on it's anybody's guess cuz no one's at the wheel at the front of
That mess yes.
The sun's goin' down for me it's goin' down for me.
He and she are what I need yes they're what I need.
But I'm gonna buy a ticket I'm not gonna even pick it.
I heard it he said it I heard it.
But it we but it went something like.
Chorus
Visit.
I wanna visit the world.
So now I visit the world.
With my time on this world.
Because livin' when you're hungry is a dog in an alley.
Now I mind my business cuz I'm rhymin' down in Cali.
I ain't playin' when sayin' kings of the ghetto feel they losing ground.
Vato's goin' loco because everyone's brought down.
This is a visit then we dead fade to dust strickin'.
I'm wearing my Doc Martens cuz I'm always down for kickin'.
This my friend the city pity everywhere the enemy.
Ready or not homey stompin' everyone in front of me.
Jump up and down cus that's the  style.
Cruise on by the frowners float follow me now with a smile.
Looking at the ocean I say there's plenty.
Looking at the river I say there's plenty.
Chorus
Jump up and down cause that's the  style.
Cruise on by the frowners float follow me now with a smile.
I got a golden ticket I'm not gonna even pick it.
I heard it he said it I heard it
But it went but it went something like.
Chorus x <start> Come on admit it it never crossed the line
Geoff Hurst's goal in extra time
In the Third World War at Wembley '
When England won again to make it a hattrick
Twenty years later a replay of another war
The Falklands Spirit against the skill of Maradona
The Union Jack's drooped the English were quiet
The Argies won Maradona had a hand in it
The line between patriotic bigotry and loyal support
Is it going to war or the simple love of sport <start> Beckoned to the frontlines to ease the pain from starving stomachs.
No floods of tears no stench of death on the screen.
Beckoned to dismiss chosen to defend.
The population reels when consistence is our enemy. <start> Saying 'I Love you' is not the words
I want to hear from you
It's not that I want you not to say
But if you only knew
How easy it would be to show me how you feel
More than words is all you have to do
To make it real then you wouldn't have to say
That you love me I'd already know
What would you do if my heart was torn in two
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say if I took those words away
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying I love you
More than words
More than words
Now I've tried to talk to you
And make you understand all you have to do
is close your eyes and just reach out your hands
And touch me hold me close
Don't ever let me go
More than words is all I ever needed you to show
Then you wouldn't have to say
That you love 'cause I already know <start> I don't mind if you kiss my ass
And suck up to me of you want to
I don't care if you kiss my ass
And suck up to me of you want to
I've got that you want
But you've got not to succeed
Stop kissing me please
Yeah Repeats
I don't mind if you leave me dry
And get me so high if you want to
I don't care for your two faced smile
And the way that my life seems to haunt you
You've got nothing i want
You've got nothing i need
Stop touching me please
Yeah Repeats
I've got what you want
What you've got not to succeed
Stop touching me please

Yeah Repeats
Don't want you to touch me no more
Don't want you to kiss me no more
Don't want you to touch me no more
Don't want you to kiss me no more
Don't even love your smile
Don't even love your smile
Don't want you to touch me no more
Don't even want you to kiss me no more
Don't even love your smile <start> 
 Come sleeper to the window do you know
Us know Have we changed Have you seen us here
Before Do you remember long ago
You summoned us across the high frontier
Of sleep and bid us urgently appear.
You called we came we waited every night
Like crystals in solution coming clear
Until your dream was sharp enough and bright
To waken you with stabs of appetite.
 Is this the moment in my story when
The messengers of destiny prepare
The usual historic specimen
Some lonely little hero starving there
And feed him with the fruits of solitaire
Is this my miracle of bread and fishes
This the mystery of answered prayer
Is this my table laid with golden dishes
 Let us not say prayer let's just say wishes.
Don't stand there dreaming let us in
It wasn't all that easy getting here. We had
To metamorphosize at least a hundred
Thousand times through all the dreary realms of
Sense just to get us from the astral to
The mental to the solid and the dense.
And that's not counting countless times we spent
Manifesting aimlessly as
Elements of chaos in the undifferentiated
Antiuniverse before
We even had a chance to be unborn
As shadowy particals in streams of light 
Now hurry up we haven't got all night
 What am I supposed to do
 Ask for something.
 I can't think.
 Come on darling.
 Help me
 You can ask for peace on earth. There's a few
That do. Or you can ask for peace of mind.
It's very rare but we've had one or two.
Or ask that human suffering unwind
And justify itself by what's behind.
Too abstract  somewhat off the beaten track.
We'd like to have this contract sealed and signed.
Then we must get back  ask for what you lack
And we will leave you sweet insomniac.
 Well could I have someone to love
 You can
 Can I send her away
 We have written it down.
 Then could I call her back again
 You certainly can you merrygoman.
 Could I write whatever's in my heart
 It's on your desk the writer's mighty pen.
 And could I sing whatever's in my heart
 Just close your eyes and keep your lips apart.
 I could have my heart's desire when
And where and how my heart desires it
And could I bring the whole world to my heart
 O Jesus not the heart the heart again
So boring. Everyone's like everyone
Your famous heart is like an onion
All layers and layers of wild distress
All gathered into rings round nothingness.
 But can I have it can I have it
 Yes
 If woman heart and song are mine
The rest will come where do I sign
 But could he write whatever's in his heart
 It's on his desk the writer's mighty pen.
 And could he sing whatever's in his heart
 He'll close his eyes and keep his lips apart
 And could he have his heart's desire when
And where and how his heart desires it
 And could I bring the whole world to my heart
 O Jesus not the heart the heart again
So boring. Everyone's like everyone
Your famous heart is like an onion
All layers and layers of wild distress
All gathered into rings round nothingness.
 But can I have it
 Can he have it
 Yes
 Can I have it
 Can he have it
 Yes
 The night is ending we have many duties
Still much gold and silver light to spill
On anxious girls and frightened boys like you
All brooding deeply on some window sill.
But one condition there remains to fill.
One term before the heart begins to play
With other hearts the music of its will.
 If I don't agree
 Still you have to pay
The ordinary price that humans pay...
With suff'ring joy redemption and decay
 All my heart's desire ... let's keep the part
about joy.
 It's a package.
 ...Suffering redemption and decay
 It's a bitch.
 I have to get some sleep I'm opening
tomorrow night.
 Then you agree
 Yes yes I agree.
 ...Do you remember long ago
You summoned us across the high frontier
Of sleep and bid us urgently appear. <start> I've been away so long I hardly knew the place
It's been too long since I've been around
Just like I rolling stone I ain't go no home
But my boys are back in town
It's been two long years that I've been on the run
From lawyers lovers monies and a lawman's son
You though tit was the last you heard from me
Well you better back up to catch up with me
'Cause I'm livin' in the fast speeding like a steam train
Just before I fall just before I fall off the track
Taking it back
I'm taking it back
Taking it back
You took it away took it away
All I can say is we're taking it back
I'm the same old dog that I used to be
The word's all over town that you've been looking for me
I'm no different that I was before
Give you what you need and then I'm out the door
'Cause I'm livin' in the fast lane coming like a hurricane
A snake without a rattle baby that's a matter of fact
Taking it back
Taking it back
Taking it back
You took it away took it away
All I can say is we're taking it back
I've been away so long it's good to see your face
Barkeep won't you buy me a round'
Raise a glass to the good times past
Then we'll tear this damn place down
Taking it back
Taking it back
Taking it back
Taking it back <start> Hard times hand to mouth down and out
All those hard times
But we've seen the seasons turning
As we weathered every storm
And the climate of our loving
Is so tender and so warm
And the best is yet to come
This is only the beginning
And we've only just begun
To realize the best is yet to come
Heartache more or less useless
All the heartache
But when the flood of sudden tears came down
We smiled and stood our ground
And the laughter we'd been counting on
It finally came around
And the best is yet to come
And it's getting so much better
Than anything I've known
And I know oh yes
The best is yet to come <start> If only I could move a galaxy that's multiplied by five
You could decide to move the great divide
When I find you split the seventeen to separate the sky
I'll turn the zero into my rocket ride.
Before me swirl these circles
of zero's and three's and the planets fell apart for me.
When I find a number greater than the sum of what you'll find
I'll turn to hide and hitch a ride to save the seventh planet
That raised a question underneath the sun.
I'll come back for me again. <start> Promised cures for every man
Snake oil and circuses
You can get to heaven yes you can
So judge the books by their surfaces
Someone's taking care of business
The market place is doing fine
As long there's no witness
How can there be a crime
The illusion is lasting
Such beautiful masking
We hold it in our arms
It's all just varying degrees of conartistry
But no one seems alarmed
No one seems alarmed
I'll promise love without end
I'll believe myself if I can
And like a baby soft and helpless
I won't ask questions
The illusion is lasting
Such beautiful masking
We hold it in our arms
It's all just varying degrees of conartistry
But no one seems to mind
No one seems to mind <start> Smell the bodies burning
As the ash it fills your lungs
You know there's nothing we're learning
That the history books haven't begun
You say It's human nature
Well I say It's no part of mine
You say you fight for the future
I say you've just begun the decline
Shame on you for trusting the weaker one
You're feeling small so go pick up a gun
Shame on you for trusting the weaker one
You're god is small he's nothing
Shame on you for trusting the stronger one
You're feeling small so go pick up a gun
Shame on you for trusting the stronger one
Your god is tall he's something
Put me in my place
When all the bodies lie burning what will be left of you
When one god slayssaves another who's decision was it
Who's decision was it
You'll need a story to tell your children <start> On and On
On and On
She broke my heart he hurt me too
That's something that only unworthy souls do
They said goodbye we say hello
An introduction for a perfect love to grow
Let's stop thinking about the past
And start thinking about the future
So that love can go on and on
Let's stop thinking about the past
And start thinking about the future
So that love can go on and on
She said she'd stay he said that too
So sad when you find out your love has found a new
She made me cry he made me weep
But life has love in store for us that's ooh so sweet
On and On 
On and On 
On and On 
On and
It's time to say goodbye to crying eyes and broken dreams
And get back to the joy that to each other we will bring
That starts from summer love to last through autumn winter spring
Our hearts will sing forever love <start> Summer here is over in a million different ways
You look like a dream sometimes but I don't dream these days
Yesterday the snow fell by four o'clock it thawed
And last night making love to you well honey it was such a fraud
'Cause you can find yourself a lover
You can make yourself a home
You can want no other ever
But it's never to late to be alone
So everything is settled or so we do pretend
From a beautiful beginning babe to a muted kind of end
And our separate possessions are shuffled up on shelves
Like our fingers lock together when we talk about ourselves
You can find yourself one day staring into space
With a suitcase waiting by the door
You can think you've got it made til it hits you in the face
That these are not the people you wanted to be before <start> On the windy beach
The sun is shining through
With weather fair
White horses riding
On the seas pasture
Onto the sand
Over the dunes came a traveling man
Sack on back wild flowers in his hand
Old rusty cans pebbles 'bedded in the sand
Stand and stare
Scratching his beard
Through the grass he steered
His sandy shoe
Disappearing in the dips
Pondering and wandering along
Nice as you please comes the traveling man
Drinking a bottle of milk in his hand
Speaking to no one in particular but happily
Down where young gulls dance
Driftwood lying drying
For the fire
Yellow beak and sleek
Now the gulls are crying
Flying higher
Out from the sea came a little green crab
Taking the sun the morning being very drab
Old rusty cans pebbles 'bedded in the sand
Stand and stare
The tinker and the crab
The tinker and the crab
The tinker and the crab <start> When I disappear do you think all of this will have stood
When I disappear it is clear I am up to no good
Only after you realize that you need what you've already lost
Touch me or don't

Where've you been
Well drop me a line with a hook and some raw bleeding bait
Well I am uncaught and still swimming alone in the lake
Shimmering under the moon made of anger and hate
Shimmering like a penny out of reach in the subway grate
Touch me or don't
Where've you been
Leave it alone
I'm sure there's someone who knows where you've been
You never worked well with our group no one can fault you now.
We'll fix you with cement galloshes no one can save you now.
Unless you have friends among fish
There'll still be no air to breathe.
You can drink up the entire ocean
And still find someone
To be everything we know that you'll never be
Touch me or don't
Where've you been
Leave it alone
I'm sure there's someone who knows where you've been
Where've you been
Where've you been
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa ah <start> Little things you do
Lead me on
Weak in those knees
Till all my will is gone
You don't want this heart
No you go too far
The way you use your eyes
Mesmerizes me
With those lips and that kiss
I'm gonna be
Cast in your arms
Taken by your charms
And all your little things
I can't hold back baby
Please please please won't you save me
With just one touch or I'll go crazy
Little things
I can't hold back baby
Please please please won't you save me
With just one touch or I'll go crazy
Little things you do
Turn me on
Makes me feel like you're the one I want
Honey there's no doubt
Don't want to live without
All your little things
Honey there's no doubt
Don't want to live without
All your little things <start> Well the lord must have had his day off when I was born
He went to bed closed his eyes had some fun
Mummy said she wanted me and I was welcome
Daddy gave his sperm and it was done
Ohh ohh I was dead before I was born
Ohh ohh I was dead before I was born
the first thing that I saw was white
The nurse came with the scissors and said  it's a boy
The doctor hit my ass said come on cry
And then I started to scream and I was alive
Ohh ohh I was dead before I was born
Ohh ohh I was dead before I was born
Ohh ohh I was dead before I was born
Ohh ohh I was dead before I was born
And now I'm here and I don't know why
'Cause I wasn't asked at all
Ohh ohh I was dead before I was born
Ohh ohh I was dead before I was born
Ohh ohh I was dead before I was born
Ohh ohh I was dead before I was born <start> Birds end their song
Only you compare
Only you know where they're gone.
Clutch the final straw
Break it in your hand
No one understands it's yours.
Now don't let go never let go again
Now cause if you must go won't you go down in flames.
Celebrate and everything will change
You're swimming with the hook
that's why everybody looks your way
Celebrate and let those demons race
You were never fake nobody could take your place.
Can't make time stand still
But you can make it run
You can make it bend at will.
Sparks will light your trail
You were never lost
You were only off the scale.
Now don't let go never let go again
Now cause if you must go won't you go down in flames.
Celebrate and everything will change
You're swimming with the hook
that's why everybody looks your way
Celebrate and let those demons race
You were never fake nobody could take your place.
You were never fake nobody could take your place.
You were never fake and nobody can take that away. <start> We keep falling into love
With no reason no rhyme
We keep falling into love
'til our tired heart cries
I don't know you
And you don't know me
Time has come to find
Different skies...
The sun and the moon collide
One burning one reflecting
One fired up in demon red
One pale and interesting
We stand staring into the sun
And then we want to be it
Blindness of moths around a flame
And we can't see it
'cause I know you
And you know me
And there's the reason why
'cause I know you
And we know her
Time has come to find...
A different sky
A different place to shine
A different sky
Without a reason why
Can't tell is it heaven or hell
Can't tell I never lie
I can't fool myself
So I found myself
A different sky
The sky I choose
Is a myriad of ocean blues
And when I think of you
I like to think your sky is blue too
Fireworks and clouds have made us find
A different sky... <start>

 <start> I started working at the second hand
I thought it would make me more colorful
I saw the world as a stitch and patch
I saw the sky as torn grey wool
I started working as a dime store clerk
I thought it would make me the kind to put you first
My only dreams were in fluorescent light
My only goal was to forget what I was worth
I want to see how it takes me
I want to see how the powder burns
Don't want to keep what I can't have more of
Don't want to wait and miss my turn
I started working as a tour guide
I thought it would make me believe my own words
Every patient thought just passed me by
Every truth I said sounded just absurd
I started working at a small town church
I thought it would make me a better man
They said the sins I had would fly away
As if the birds were in the palms of my own hands <start> Where do you think you're going
Don't you know it's dark outside
Where do you think you're going
Don't you care about my pride
Where do you think you're going
I think that you don't know
You got no way of knowing
There's really no place you can go
I understand your changes
Long before you reach the door
I know where you think you're going you
I know what you came here for
And now I'm sick of joking
You know I like you to be free
Where do you think you're going
I think you better go with me girl
You say there is no reason
But you still find cause to doubt me
If you ain't with me girl
You're gonna be without me
Where do you think you're going
Don't you know it's dark outside
Where do you think you're going
Don't you care about my pride
And now I'm sick of joking
You know I like you to be free
So where do you think you're going
I think you better go with me girl <start> Danny's on the drumset Justin' on the bass
Kelly's got the rhythm while Aaron shreds the place
Issa's writing songs again he's screaming them all night
For a positive solution together they will fight
People of the world today are we looking for a better way of life
People of the world unite let's make a difference we can get it right
We are a positive hardcore band
We are ready to take a stand
We know the future's in all our hands
We are a positive hardcore band
We went around the globe we crossed the equator
We didn't come back home again until almost  years later
We made a lot of new friends we had a lot of fun
You think this story's over but it's only just begin <start> I I know I'm a dreamer
It's easy to see I want to be a believer
And fly right through the air
Now I'm wide awake
I want you to take me there
The things that you told me
I don't know if I was dreaming
And dreams aren't enough
Life is so lonely
I need someone to believe in
Are you in love
Can't you see that's everything to me
That's enough
Magdalene let me hear it said so I am sure
Answer me can't you see that's all I'm waitin' for
Here I am on my knees once more
Magdalene
Time must lead you somewhere
I don't want to wait
I know you can take me there
The way that you hold me
I don't know if I was dreaming
And dreams aren't enough
Life is so lonely
I need someone to believe in
Someone to love
Can't you see that's everything to me
That's enough
Magdalene let me hear it said so I am sure
Answer me can't you see that's all I'm waiting for
Here I am on my knees
Oh I'm begging you please
Magdalene
Magdalene
Magdalene
Magdalene <start> Now ending discreetly just like a hidden sin
As I go under please tuck me in
Make me invisible
This hidden explosion calls for a wandering cast with no direction
Enter all monsters let us twist another fairy tale

Go kill the lights we'll glow till morning comes


I'll say goodnight and bow to everyone
Then we go under
The beauties are sleeping as fruit just rots away
Today go hungry let it begin
Make me invincible
There was a weeping I carried down today a sigh worth keeping
Deep within divinity let's star another secret show

Go kill the lights we'll glow till morning comes


I'll say goodnight and bow to everyone
No need to worry it is just another monster
No need to fear here in the secret show
No need to worry I am just another monster
In you I'll see me in the secret show

Go kill the lights we'll glow till morning comes


I'll say goodnight and bow to everyone

Go kill the lights we'll glow till morning comes

I'll say goodnight and bow to everyone <start> And there you were beside me
In the middle of a crowd
It took so long to find me
While I cried to you out loud
It seemed like forever
I was so alone
I thought I'd never find home
I was stumbling in the darkness
I was living underground
Now I'm standing in the sunlight
Basking in this love I've found
It's the first breath of a baby
It's the warmth of a touch
I'm giving you my vow I'll say it here and now
Nothing I could do could mean as much
I savor every moment
I hang on every word
It's rapture just to touch you
The world becomes a blur
I'm a better man with you
Than I was by myself
And when I kiss you
You can tell
It's finding what you're after
It's what is meant to be
When I hear your laughter
And when you look at me
It's like living in a daydream
It's like heaven here on earth
I don't have much to give but long as I shall live
I'd give to you my heart for what it's worth
I was drowning in an ocean
A lost soul set a drift
I was wandering the desert
I was stepping off a cliff
I was hanging by a heart string
I was just about to slip
When you came to my rescue
And gave to me the ultimate gift
It's a feeling of completeness
It's a half that now is whole
Now I see forever
When you look into my soul
It's a truck I've never taken
It's like walking through the clouds
Words cannot describe just how I feel inside
Because of who you are I'm free somehow
It's finding what you're after
It's what is meant to be
When I hear your laughter
And when you look at me
It's like living in a daydream
It's like heaven here on earth
I don't have much to give but long as I shall live
I'd give to you my heart for what it's worth
For what it's worth for what it's worth
For what it's worth
I can dance with you all night
Make love back and alive
We can walk through the rain
We can Incomprehensible pain <start> When you're half way from a dream
Is it hard to work out what is real
Is the real over there more vivid than here ever feels
We could love
We could love you
If you need somebody to love you
While you're looking for somebody to love
Sweet love illumination
Sweet sweet love elevation
Outside fresh avaricide
But inside our love you'll be alright
Sweet love illumination
Sweet sweet love celebration
Cop car burn
Reason turn
But it'll bring you up
You'll be alright
Is the Blackpool bright light
Brighter than the light in your home
Were you born to be loved but nobody else seems to know
We could love
We could love you
If you need somebody to love you
While you're looking for somebody to love
Sweet love illumination

Sweet love <start> Here we are
You and I together for the first time
Though heaven knows I've wanted you
And I guess you knew but we just
Never said
Or never had the chance
And if love only lasts for one night
That would still be all right
If love only lasts for one night
We've got the morning to remember 
And decide
That if love only lasts for one night
We will have something
We always wanted to try
Holding you
Seems like this is what the night
Was made for
Though who can say what lies ahead
Will this flame that flickers in
The darkness
Survive the light of day
And if love only lasts for one night we
Got the morning ohooh
If love only lasts for tonight
If love only lasts for on night we
Will remember oh yeah
If love only lasts for tonight <start> She motioned to me
That she wanted to leave
And go somewhere warm
Where we'd be alone
Well I do not know what's going on
But I'm guessing
Oh it's an all night thing
Yeah it's an all night thing
If it's an all night thing
Nobody is gonna make it end
And if it don't begin
Don't worry that I'll take offence
If it's an all night thing
And we fall like a tear falling
To the ground
I'll never come around
And you'll never hear a word from me
If it's an all night thing
Well I walked along
I was feeling at ease
And falling like rain
Ooh into her scheme
She won't let on what that'll be
But I'm guessing
Oh it's an all night thing
Yeah it's an all night thing
If it's an all night thing
Nobody is gonna make it end
And if it don't begin
Don't worry that I'll take offence
If it's an all night thing
And we fall like a tear falling
To the ground
I'll never come around
And you'll never hear a word from me yeah
If it's an all night thing
If it's an all night thing
If it's an all night thing
Yeah if it's an all night thing <start> This new neighborhood ain't no good

Something's wrong but there's nothing

I wanna get back to blue. Wanna get back to blue.
An acquired tast your smilin' face

It just gives me the creeps
When I hear you laughing in your sleep
I wanna get back to blue. Wanna get back to blue.
I wanna get back to the things
we used to do.

Ain't it funny how it ain't funny at all.
I think I'm going back again tonight.
I wanna get back to blue.
Wanna get back to blue. <start> J.G. Thirwell
If Moses had heard about this one there would've been another commandment
Thou shalt not slaver on thine cadaver whilst all thine fat is in the fire
This isn't the melody that lingers on it's the malady that malingers on
There's the Devil to pay  he can keep the change  I can't stand the thought
Of another cold day...
I AIN'T GOT A CHINAMAN'S CHANCE IN LIMBO
Mass breathing mass seething mass bleeding mass seeding mass debating
Mass existence is the cause of my problems gotta choose between suicide
And genoicide
I've been impaled by the sins of World Ware Two
Can't sleep for the skins of six million jews
I'd join the Ku Klux Klan just to get the uniform  or a good night's sleep
ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE
The jig is up  My fate is sealed
I'm stood at the gallows again
The inscription on my tombstone reads WISH YOU WERE HERE
The tearing of my FLESH  The thud of my CARCASS
The rhythmic crunch of bone
Crucifixion is my addiction...
I SPENT A MONTH OF SUNDAYS IN A COLD DAY IN HELL
When it's one man against the world I shouldn't have so much time to complain
I found there was a hole in my spiritual parachute after I jumped from the
Astral plain
No escape from four stone slimy walls I built up while trying to knock them
Down
DEATH warrant DEATH wwatch DEATH rattle DEATH'S door  ain't I died enough
Before
Deliver me from this treachery... Deliver me from this AGONY
Stop trying to make a man of me... I ain't got the raw materials see
I'm a killer with a label and a blueprint of Babel and all of my DEATH cards
Are on the table
I met my maker and I don't like what I see... Medusa is fondling me
Blut und Boten are strictly verboten it's a classic case of mort subite
But what I thought was the quickest solution turned out to be satanic destiny
ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE
The jig is up  my fate is sealed
I'm stood on the gallows again
The inscription on my tombstone reads WISH YOU WERE HERE
I DIED EVERY NIGHT FOR A THOUSAND YEARS
The tearing of my FLESH  the thud of my CARCASS
THE RHYTHMIC CRUNCH OF BONE
Crucifixion is my addiction...
I SPENT A MONTH OF SUNDAYS IN A COLD DAY IN HELL
I SPENT A MONTH OF SUNDAYS IN A COLD DAY IN HELL

You know why and where to go
She can't wait to roll you right
She called you up and told you so
Feel the wind now as it cleans away your past
This when you feel your future changing fast
Right now right now right now
Keep your mind back on the road
Concentration on the curves
She made time feel slow
She cranked the volume on your nerves
The town is sleeping and the motor's making time
Take it easy hold it right at ninetynine
Right now right now
See the candle in the dawn
Lover's light is burning still
Need some sleep to carry on
Wonder when you ever will
There beside you she is breathing slow and sweet
She is smiling as you slide under the sheet
Right right now right right now right right now <start> Born a natural loser I can't recall just where

Two bit hand a twenty one that's all I ever get
Go down gamblin'

Go down gamblin'
You may never have to go no
Down in a crap game I've been losing at roulette
Cards are bound to break me but I ain't busted yet
'Cause I've been called a natural lover by that lady over there
Honey I'm just a natural gambler but I try to do my share
Go down gamblin'
Say it when you're running low
Go down gamblin'
You may never have to go no <start> I'm an engine driver

I am the heart that you call home
And I've written pages upon pages
Trying to rid you from my bones

And if you don't love me let me go
And I am a writer writer of fictions
I am the heart that you call home
And I've written pages upon pages
Trying to rid you from my bones
I am a writer I am all that you have home
Home
And I've written pages upon pages
Trying to rid you from my bones
My bones
My bones

And if you don't love me let me go

And if you don't love me let me go <start> Pretty little one
How has it all begun
They're teaching you how to walk
But you're already on the run
Little one
What you gonna do
Little one
Honey it's all up to you
Now your daddy's in the den shootin' up the evening news
Mama's with a friend lately she's been so confused
Little one
Come on and take my hand
I may not have the answer but I believe I got a plan
Honey you shake and I'll rattle and we'll roll on down the line
And see if we can't get in touch with a very close friend of mine
But let me clue you in it ain't like him
To argue or pretend
Honey let me introduce you to my redneck friend
Well they've got a little list of all those things of which they don't
approve
They've got to keep their eyes on you or you might make your move
Little one
I really wish you would
Little one
I think the damage would do you good
Honey you shake and I'll rattle and we'll roll on down the line
We're going to forget all about the battle
It's gonna feel so fine
'Cause he's the missing link the kitchen sink
Eleven on a scale of ten
Honey let me introduce you to my redneck friend
Honey you shake and I'll rattle and we'll roll on down the line
I'm going to try to swing you up into my saddle
And then we'll run but you'll think we're flyin'
Now honey don't just stand there
Lookin' like this dream will never end
Honey let me introduce you to my redneck friend <start> Something's wrong from the moon my friends
Something's wrong from the moon
As I look down at you my friends
Something's wrong from the moon
Poor little man
You been run down
Poor little man
You're all run down
I can see right through your eyes
I can see right through your weary eyes
I can hear right through your cries
I can hear right through your drunken cries
When they spit do you wash their floors
And pray that they don't spit no more
Or rise up children life goes on and on
Wise up children life goes on and on
In the dark you cannot see
In the dark the victory is fear
Like a fool you follow fools
Like a fool you follow what you hear
Will they blow us all apart
Or kill us all with virus darts
Or rise up children life goes on and on
Wise up children life goes on and on
On the moon they're laughing hard
On the moon they're falling off their seats
From the moon we're comedy
From the moon we're really quite a treat
Shall we have another beer
And slobber through another year
Or rise up children life goes on and on
Wise up children life goes on and on
Rise up children life goes on and on
Wise up
Something's wrong from the moon my friend
Something's wrong from the moon
As I look down at you my friends
Something's wrong from the moon <start> I'm envious of your I.Q. of 
You you're the one
It's written all over your face
You you're the one
I'd like to take your place
I'm envious of your I.Q. of 
Your lack of brains just drives me crazy
It's the only way to get by and be lazy
You you're the one
It's written all over your face
You you're so dumb
I'd like to take your place
I'm envious of your I.Q. of 
From where I come it's the dumber the better
No one likes a really go getter <start> I always used to dread the dark
It reminded me of my empty heart
Lonely nights brought so much pain
And times I thought I would go insane
Had no one to talk to nothing to do
Emotions ran from black to blue
I kept my thoughts bottled up inside
Felt so bad I thought I'd die
Chorus
Yeah I have prayed
To the moon and stars
But I came out
All bruised and scarred
I never thought I would find a way
To see the light at the end of day
You saved my heart
You're my angel in the dark
Now darkness comes but I don't care
Because I know you'll be there
To keep me warm when the nights turn cold
Things like that stir my soul <start> I wanna be a little piece of history
Let's go I wanna be a painting for all to see
Let's go take a trip take a big hand full of these
And swallow just a headache a fuzzy memory
Tomorrow
I wanna be a Warhol
Hanging on your wall
You down there looking up at me
I wanna be a Warhol
Displayed on your wall
Hung up there staring back at you
Staring back at you
Give me a taste of your misery
Let's go won't you please come play chemistry
And sorrow I can't believe anything that you're telling me
Let's go the walls are closing in and melting
Nice and slow
I wanna be a Warhol
Hanging on your wall
You down there looking up at me
I wanna be a Warhol
Displayed on your wall
Hung up there staring back at you
Staring back at you
I wanna be a Warhol
Hanging on your wall
Staring down at you
I wanna be a Warhol
Displayed on your wall
Still hung up on you
Still hung up on you
Still hung up on you <start> Our whole universe was in a hot dense state
Then nearly fourteen billion years ago expansion started wait
The earth began to cool the autotrophs began to drool
Neanderthals developed tools
We built a wall 
Math science history unraveling the mysteries
That all started with the big bang Hey
Since the dawn of man is really not that long
As every galaxy was formed in less time than it takes to sing this song
A fraction of a second and the elements were made
The bipeds stood up straight the dinosaurs all met their fate
They tried to leap but they were late
And they all died 
The oceans and Pangea see ya wouldn't wanna be ya
Set in motion by the same big bang
It all started with the big bang
It's expanding ever outward but one day
It will cause the stars to go the other way
Collapsing ever inward we won't be here it won't be hurt
Our best and brightest figure that it'll make an even bigger bang
Australopithecus would really have been sick of us
Debating how we're here they're catching deer 
Religion or astronomy 
It all started with the big bang <start> Our stuck together pieces
The joke is I don't need this
You can hardly tell the difference
Well I know but I don't care
Grown up together pieces
Our stuck together pieces
A load near misses
Aw shucks you got me
You can have anything that you want
Except the thing you really want
Go back to where you came from
Go back to what you know
Our stuck together pieces
Our stuck together pieces
Our stuck together pieces
Our stuck together pieces
Why be rain when you could be sun
Why tie yourself to anyone
Why be here when you'd be somewhere else
Well I know but I don't care
You don't get away you don't get away
You don't get away you don't get away
You don't get away you don't get away
You don't get away you don't get away so easily
You don't get away you don't get away
You don't get away so easily
You don't get away you don't get away
You don't get away you don't get away
You don't get away
Mirror mirror still the prettiest
To all points of the compass
Just tell us where the money is
On stuck together pieces
And a load of near misses
And a load of near misses
Well I don't want any trouble
But my brain is in a tangle
You don't get away you don't get away
You don't get away so easily
You don't get away you don't get away
You don't get away so easily
You don't get away you don't get away
You don't get away you don't get away
You don't get away you don't get away
You don't get away you don't get away
You don't get away <start> I I love the colorful clothes she wears
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I hear the sound of a gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations
I'm pickin' up good vibrations 
She's giving me excitations
Good good good good vibrations 
She's giving me excitations
Good good good good vibrations 
She's giving me excitations 
Close my eyes
She's somehow closer now
Softly smile I know she must be kind
When I look in her eyes
She goes with me to a blossom world
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations
I'm pickin' up good vibrations 
She's giving me excitations 
Good good good good vibrations 
She's giving me excitations 
Good good good good vibrations 
She's giving me excitations 


I don't know where but she sends me there



Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations
A happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations
A happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations
A happenin'
Ah
Good good good good vibrations 
She's giving me excitations 
Good good good good vibrations 
She's na na
Na na na na na
Na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na
Do do do do do
Do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do <start> Stop those voices in your head
They eat away your will
You've everything you need
Hate the way they make you weak
They bring you to your knees
And steal your power away
Girls talk shit when you're backed up against it
Don't believe any word that they hear
And you can do what it is that you want
Without some little bitch in your ear
And girls talk shit making no bones about it
When you're something that they don't understand
When they see that you got caught with your pants down
When they see you got caught with your pants down
Buy into the things they say
You'll lose your common sense
You've everything you need
Love to bring you to your knees
And watch you as you bleed
And give your power away
Girls talk shit when you're backed up against it
Don't believe any word that they hear
And you can do what it is that you want
Without some little bitch in your ear
And girls talk shit making no bones about it
When you're something that they don't understand
And you can do what it is that you want
Without some little bitch in your ear
And girls talk shit making no bones about it
When you're something that they don't understand
And you can do what it is that you want
Without some little bitch in your ear
Girls talk shit when your karma is crashing
Girls talk shit when it falls to the floor
Girls talk shit when you're biting your nails down
To the quick cause you feel insecure
Girls talks shit making no bones about it
Girls talks shit making no bones about it
You can do what it is that you want
Without some little bitch in your ear
In your ear
In your ear <start> Underneath your gaze I was found in
The haze I'm wandering around in
I am lost in the dark of my own room
And I can't see a thing but the fire in your eyes
Clear my eyes make me wise
Or is all I believe in lies
I really don't know when or where to go
And I can't see a thing 'til you open my eyes
I've been told by some you'll forget me
The thought doesn't upset me
I am blind to whatever they're saying
And all I can see is the fire in your eyes
Can't believe that it's on your mind
To leave me behind <start> Kennst Du die Trauer einer Mutter
die ihr Kind verliert
kennst Du das Herz eines Freundes
das Leere sprt und stirbt
Du hast genommenwas wir liebten
hast Trauer hinterlassen
soll ich Dich bedauern
oder Dich hassen
Du warst das Messerer die Wunde
wer fhrte Deine Hand
Du warst Henkerer Dein Kunde
bist Du ein Mrder oder krank
kennst Du die Wutden Schmerz
das Brennen tief in mir
die grenzenlose Ohnmacht
einen Bruder zu verliern
Sie hat verbundene Augen
und heit Gerechtigkeit
wie konnte sie Dir glauben
ist sie blind in dieser Zeit
doch Du mut damit Leben
er ist tot und Du bist frei
es wird nie wiederwie es war
es ist noch lange nicht vorbei
Du hast gettet
doch bereust Du Deine Tat
Du hast gelogen
doch qult es Dich im Schlaf
alleswas Du tust
kommt irgendwann auf Dich zurck
vielleicht wirst Du verschont
vielleicht verrckt <start> To the voyer
Seated in the darkened room
Do you thrill
When the green light starts pulsing
Paranoia
The only valid point of view
If you know what I'm saying
I'm not alone
Being followed
Someone always watching what we do
Never alone
But I'm in the shadows
I dream things I don't want you to know
Something shifting
Between the sirens and the glow
Of red lights
And the blue slowly turning
A fog is lifting
A silhouette begins the show
Then the moment is stolen
I'm not alone
Being followed
Someone always watching what we do
Never alone
But I'm in the shadows
I dream things I don't want you to know



In this chamber
Lit by scandal
Your the bullet
In the barrel
Your the last thing
As I'm falling
Bloody roaring
Still I'm calling out
I'm calling out
I'm not alone
Being followed
Never alone
I'm being followed
I'm not alone
Being followed
Never alone
I'm being followed
La la la la la la la <start> I want some culture
Never mind the cheese
Just want to hear music
And originality
I want some culture
Never mind the TV
Just want to hear music
Down at the 
This is a rhyme about how good music can be
How mean are its bass lines its melodies and beats
Now its good to have positivity
But you also muct be able to crush adversaries because
We have terrorists in the music industry
Yes terrorists trying to define what music be
We are modern medicine men  cure all ills with ill beats
But some people are making music sick
And stealing all the chi
You know who you are and yes judge not lest ye
Be judged I agree in front of my plasma screen but
While you're making a concert of convicts who
Stumbled throught the contest I'm taking the
Concept of convex and putting it in a concave context
And if you were Rocksteady Bebop and Shredder
I'd be Krang... doing that evil shit better
Music is for living yes music is essential
Music should take risks and be experimental
I want some culture
Never mind the cheese
Just want to hear music
And originality <start> You are who's inside of my heart
Made don't want to be apart.
I would cry to see you go woahwoh
'cause you are who's inside my heart.
I can be the one who goes
I am strong in this you know woahwoh
I don't wanna be alone
You are who's inside my heart.
So meet me if you care I'll be at the spot
Maybe see you there or not.
So meet me if you care I'll be at the spot
Maybe see you there or not.
If you care about me 'cause I know I care for you
And I want you there I'll leave it up to you.
Here inside it's hard to see who holds
See if I am what you want.
I'll be here with sticks and stuff
I'll be here to let you know.
So meet me if you care I'll be at the spot
Maybe see you there or not.
So meet me if you care I'll be at the spot

If you care about me 'cause I know I care for you
And I want you there I'll leave it up to you. <start> All I want is a day from your life
I'm not asking you to be my wife
All I need is a friend for today
It's not because I'm feeling down
That I want you around
I just want to share the good times with
Someone who looks just like you
I'll write to you from wherever I am
We'll keep in touch just like we planned
I need more than a friend for today
The touch of your hand the look in your eyes
You ask no questions tell me no lies
I've found more than a friend for today
It's not because I'm feeling down
That I want you around
I just want to share the good times with
Someone who looks just like you
Honey I ain't never never never gonna leave you
That's true
Do you want to know why
'Cause you're the dirtiest girl I've ever had
It's not because I'm feeling down
That I want you around
I just want to share the good times with
Someone who looks just like you <start> All day long
I've been thinking about you baby
With loving you on my mind
I couldn't hardly wait
To get home to you baby
So I could do a little overtime
Baby baby you've been so good to me
I want to understand
If I want a do right woman
Then I've got to be a do right man
So I'm gonna lay another log
On the fire baby
Before my flame gets too low
Yes I'm gonna lay another log
On the fire baby
Trying to keep Jody from my door
Oh I know I've been neglecting you
Lately baby
Just trying to make ends meet
But tonight I'm gonna be
On my love job baby
Me working on you you working on me
Wine music and a little candlelight
Just to help me unwind
'Cause I know
I got so much love to give baby
And tonight I'm gonna take my time
I'm gonna lay another log
On the fire baby
Before my flame gets too low
Said I'm gonna lay another log
On the fire baby
Just trying to keep Jody from my door
I'm gonna lay another log
On the fire baby
Before my flame gets too low
Yes I'm gonna lay another log
On the fire baby
Just gotta keep Jody from my door
I'm gonna lay another log
On the fire baby
Before my flame gets too low
Think I'm gonna lay another log
On the fire baby
Just trying to keep Jody from my door... <start> 




 





 



 
 





 





 <start> Is it too late to prevent their fall
Are they ready for the key to it all
The mystery solved the answer to life
The final solution a chance to survive
We can save this illfated race
Who are lost in the ocean of space
Show them the way to reverse their decline
Guide them back on the river of time
Follow the wave speed up the flight
Slow down time faster than light
Unite the forces take a giant leap
Bend the stream dive into the deep
We can save this illfated race
Who are lost in the ocean of space
Show them the way to reverse their decline
Guide them back on a river of time
Send back visions of war and decay.
Paradigms of fear in a world of dismay.
Shape the present alter the past.
Create a new future one that would last
We can save this illfated race
Who are lost in the ocean of space
Show them the way to reverse their decline
Guide them back on a river of time <start> Swoon this is the same old blood rush with a new touch
I am safe quaint and eloquent
But my bottom lip along with the top one too
Is chapped and it's all thanks to you
We all wet our lips to prepare for the kiss
But it never came
And we all wet our lips to prepare for the kiss
It was but a game
You have a moan all of your own
And I can feel it down to the bone
You have a moan all of your own
And I can feel it down to the bone

You trained these lips when they were champs
And now they're itchin' for a comeback
So come back
It's a shame that your claim to fame
Hangs on someone else's name
So come back
Such a task and this is such a blast
And such a task
And such a task and this is such a blast
And all that jazz
You have a moan all of your own
And I can feel it down to the bone
You have a moan all of your own
And I can feel it down to the bone
You have a dangerous face and illegal taste
And that strap is fallen on that shoulder blade
Be patient
Behave
You have a dangerous face and illegal taste
And that strap is fallen on that shoulder blade
Be patient
Behave
You have a dangerous face and illegal taste
And that strap is fallen on that shoulder blade
Be patient
Behave
You trained these lips when they were champs
And now they're itchin' for a comeback
You have a moan all of your own
And I can feel it down to the bone
You have a moan all of your own
And I can feel it down to the bone <start> Freedom calls
And in your heart you have been waiting
For this moment to come
Within these walls
You have heard words of inspiration
That have opened your eyes
I am old
But there's a wisdom that comes with years
You are young and it's so easy when you have no fears
Go go where your heart believes
Your memories are waiting
It's the only way to find out who you are
In this life
There is a road that you must follow
To the left or the right
One is wide but the other is hard and narrow
Take this one and you can call it your own
There will so many voices trying to turn you round
Take a moment just to listen then carry on
Go go where your heart believes
Your memories are waiting
It's the only way to find out who you are
There will be times when you're lost and lonely
And you will have noone beside you
And that is when you'll find the hidden one inside
Who will help you through
Go go where your heart believes
Your memories are waiting
And your dreams are on their way go go to your destiny
You know I will be with you every step of the way go

Freedom calls 
Go where your heart believes <start> Written by bob welch.
I guess you've heard about the bermuda triangle
There's something going on
Nobody seems to know just what it is
And the airforce won't let on
It might be hole down in the ocean
Yeah or a fog that won't let go
It might be some crazy people talking
Or somebody that we ought to know
Down in bermuda the pale blue sea
Way down in the triangle it's easy to believe
Now here's one
You see strange shapes in moonlight
And shadows in the night
They said that wingtip seemed to brush their faces
And strangers stole their sight
Way down in the triangle
Where the sea was smooth as glass
Giving you one answer to a question
That you never thought you'd ask
Ah down in bermuda in the pale blue sea
Way down in bermuda yeah it's easy to believe
Down in the triangle it's easy to believe
They came from galveston
They came from new orleans
And then from bloomington and delaware
The used st. petersburg they came from tampa
And then from mexico it doesn't matter where
They all completely share
All of those ships and planes
A great big mystery that cannot be explained
Down in bermuda in the pale blue sea
Your feeling safe in your harbour
And everything seems certain
Right next to palm beach and key biscane
Behind a velvet curtain
But then the moon goes grey with worry
And the sea turns a pale white
You better believe something strange is going on tonight
Down in bermuda ah the pale blue sea
Bermuda triangle yeah it's easy to believe
Down in the triangle it's easy to believe
They came from galveston
They came from new orleans
And then from bloomington and delaware
Bermuda the pale blue sea <start> On a normal day I'd treat you like I did today
I don't know why I need the pain
On a normal day I'd stop it all and tell you why
I pulled the plug threw it away
Of only it would get better I'd smile as if I felt it
Although if it ever got better
I might go throw it all away
The way you always do
I might just bury you alive
And go do something new
If I've asked before then turn around and shut the door
The answer I don't want to know
If I've asked before then tell me to go home
I think it's probably time that I should go
If only it would get better I'd smile as if I felt it
although if it ever got better
I might go throw it all away
The way you always do
I might just bury you alive
And go do something new
It doesn't matter if you tell the truth
It doesn't seem to pay off when it comes the time
It doesn't matter if you're clean or if your soul is black
They believe that you are kind
If only it would get better I'd smile as if I felt it
Although if it ever got better <start> Deceiver do you pride in the mess that you make
Do you rejoice in the peace of mind that you take
When you take it all
and these words spill from me too easily
like the patience I feel as it leaves me
eyes open wide and all I can see
is the growing distance that you should be from me
selfcentered eyes don't call to mine
You parade on thin Ice
If I'm not being perfectly clear
or if the words that I spit went in and out your ear
Do us a favor quit the games pack up and leave
my friends and I live without tricks on our sleeves <start> Al decirme a m mi piel que t eres tela
Y que yo la costurera pa tejer
En ese cuerpo bendito una propuesta
La de hacerte prisionera de mi bien
Al contarme a m mi piel que t eres perla
La que quiere a mi ese brillo devolver
Pa que luzca y ya no mande en mi cabeza
Que me tuvo castigado sin mi bien
Ay pequea corre vuela
A sacarme de esta oscura noche gris
A meterme de tu vida por las venas
A morirte por querer verme vivir
Al decirme a m mi piel que t eres prenda
Pa taparme a m los ojos y no ver
Y que ahora ya no vea y solo sienta
Y me guen tus ojitos para ser
Ay pequea corre vuela
A sacarme de esta oscura noche gris
A meterme de tu vida por las venas
A morirte por querer verme vivir
Ay pequea <start> I know that I don't know you
And you couldn't know me
But time and space collided
And here we are here we are
I know that you don't understand
And I can't explain
But circumstance conspired
And here we are here we are
the time is four nineteen
time flies

the answer is no
And I know we can't turn back all the years
Time reflected in a shade of gray
But I often wonder what could have been
And I still hold on to yesterday
And I know we're not children any more
Innocence lost in a sea of gray
But I often wonder what else could be
And I still dream of running away
So where do we begin
And what else can we say
When the lines are all drawn
What should we do today <start> Once stood a man on my face
Ooh yeah on my face
Gobbled him up 'cause my taste
Leaves nothing to waste
Hear the riddle that I say
Hear the riddle that I say
What is fair is fair
That is fair and square to me
Piano it marks the good pace
Ooh yeah the good pace
Don't know if it's right but I like the bass
So turn up the bass
Hear the fiddles as they play
Hear the fiddles as they play
What is fair is fair
And the guitar player
No metal no brick was no trace
Oh no was no trace
But machines moved on and still chased
No particular place
Hear the riddle that I say
Hear the riddle that I say
What is fair is fair
That is fair and square to me
What is fair is fair
That is fair and square to me. <start> It's ok In a way
I just can not see it
If you take What I have
I just can't belive it
Try to sort it all out
It's a way of dreaming
You will keep In my way
As a case of sorrow
Try to feel Not a thing
At least until tomorrow
Give me your medicine
If you go I'll follow
What's that about
What is that All about
Leaving me defenceless
Leaving me With a sight
That I just can't let go
It's a thing on my mind
If I go will you follow <start> I've been staring at the page for what seems like days
I guess I put this one off for a while
Did I see a tear fall from your eyes
Or did you laugh so hard that you cried
When I served my secrets on a silver tray to you 
Hey now I guess the night's just bringing me down
There's no love there's no hate
I left them there for you to take
But know that every word was a piece of my heart 
You've been the blood in my veins
The only one who knows my middle name
And the smiles they came easy 'cause of you 
You know that I love you but I hate you
'Cause I know I can never escape you
So let the choir sing for tonight I'm an easy mark 
Hey now am I acting just a little too proud
There's no love there's no hate
I left them there for you to take
But know that every word was a piece of my heart 
Have I said too much
Maybe I haven't said enough
But know that every word was a piece of my heart 
Hush me darling maybe I've lost my touch
Maybe I've lost my guts
There is that truth enough
Hey now hey now...
Guitar solo
You know these love letters mix with whisky
Just don't light a match when you kiss me
Though I'll blow away you know I'll be back soon 
Hey now hey now hey now am I talking just a little too loud
There's no love there's no hate
I left them there for you to take
But know that every word was a piece of my heart 
Have I said too much
Maybe I haven't said enough
But know that every word was a piece of my heart
Hey now am I talking just a little too proud
Hey now the night's just bringing me down <start> I remember all my life
Raining down as cold as ice
Shadows of a man a face through a window
Cryin' in the night the night goes into mornin'
Just another day
Happy people pass my way
Lookin' in their eyes I see a memory
I never realized you made me so happy
Oh Brand oops
Well you came and you gave without takin'
But I sent you away oh Mandy
Well you kissed me and stopped me from shakin'
And I need you today oh Mandy
I'm standing on the edge of time
I walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world of uphill climbin'
The tears are on my mind and nothin' is rhymin'
Oh Mandy
Well you came and you gave without takin'
But I sent you away oh Mandy
Well you kissed me and stopped me from shakin'
And I need you today oh Mandy
Yesterday's a dream I face the mornin'
Cryin' on the breeze the pain is callin'
Oh Mandy
Well you came and you gave without takin'
But I sent you away oh Mandy
Well you kissed me and stopped me from shakin'
And I need you today oh Mandy
Well you came and you gave without takin'
But I sent you away oh Mandy
Well you kissed me and stopped me from shakin'
And I need you today oh Mandy oh Mandy <start> I keep looking for a place to fit
Where I can speak my mind
I've been trying hard to find the people
That I won't leave behind
They say I got brains
But they ain't doing me no good
I wish they could
Each time things start to happen again
I think I got something good goin' for myself
But what goes wrong
Sometimes I feel very sad
Sometimes I feel very sad

Sometimes I feel very sad

I guess I just wasn't made for these times
Every time I get the inspiration
To go change things around
No one wants to help me look for places
Where new things might be found
Where can I turn when my fair weather friends cop out
What's it all about
Each time things start to happen again
I think I got something good goin' for myself
But what goes wrong
Sometimes I feel very sad
Sometimes I feel very sad

Sometimes I feel very sad

I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times

When we said we're just as one
We were heading for the promised land
Keep the faith I'm still close to you.
Nothing can separate us now
in the hardtimes
I'll be by your side
Let's find a way out
I won't change the way I look at you
You're not a alien
there's something now in your blood
I know it hurts it hurts you deep inside
Don't let despair invade your heart
I'll be there I won't let you down
I promise nothing can separate us now
in the hardimes I'll be by your side
Let's find a way out

Ah you're the sweetest little babe

Everything that I ask you to
Guess you ran away from your home darling

Well my brother is sent to Korea
And my sister settled down in NewOrleans
Guess my mother is up in heaven
And now I wonder what
Would happen to me

See me poised at the happy games
Standing in the mouth of all that's pure
Come straggling in your tattered remnants

Ask tomorrow I am the end

And I'm half English too
I'm a great big bundle of culture
Tied up in the red white and blue
I'm a fine example of your Essex man
I'm well familiar with the Hindustan
'Cause my neighbors are half English too
My breakfast was half English
And so am I you know
I had a plate of Marmite soldiers
Washed down with a cappuccino
And I'll have a veggie curry about once a week
The next day a fry it up as Bubble 'N' Squeak'
'Cause my appetite's half English
And I'm half English too
Dance with me
To this very English melody
From Morris Dancing to Morrissey
All that stuff came from across the sea
Britannia she's half English
She speaks Latin at home
St. George was born in the Lebanon
How he got here I don't know
And those three lions on his shirt
They never sprung from England's dirt
Them lions are half English
And I'm half English too

What a beautiful country you are <start> Photograph each day so we can live forever Sit in the light to make the dark a little darker And I dance to move only you and I fight to kiss and make up. I scream for some silence. I laugh to laugh for once
not there so you notice I'm gone and I breathe cuz its necessary and I sigh when I see the moon. I dream to make sleep less boring.. until there was you and I feel in the absence of heart and I plug my eyes to cry. I'm a hopeless romantic and kicking the habit but all hearts have darts.
Chorus Sweet red cherry blossom tree that lives in both you and me. You marked your name but I can see its not on me. So I've shamelessly gone and made myself come undone.
Heavy hangs my head when I'm Unhearted.

I wear this angels crown to cover up my devils frown and upon my broken chest lay a struggle between loneliness and things that are out of place like my head in outer space and the carpet you walked on the ceiling that cries please don't walk away chorus
Bridge
Bellow it out with all the breath in my lungs. Apologize for all that I've done. You did a number on me and a fantastic job. In the scheme of all things we never felt. When your hearts been breached and your guards been let down You've rotten and spoiled me into the ground and a good mess forgives all the rest we allow
chorus x Sweet red cherry blossom tree that lives in both you and me <start> So you think the man is crazy
He eats up your lies
Like they're good for him
Apple pie he don't even cry
He's not a fool
He's just tryin' to do
What his heart says to
To love you
As you take to the wind
To the wind again my friend
As he breaks down within
Within within within
He waits for you patiently
Hopin' that one day you'll see
That all he really wants to be
Is yours and yours alone eternally
What do you want the boy to do
Don't you see you're breaking the child in two
What do you want the boy to do
All he really wants is you
He knows what you are
Still he'll be up game
Saved the world today
But you know better
You don't go around him
Now and then you promise
All the way out things that you're gonna get
You will see you will be
So damn glad that you finally found him
As he watches you come and go
Or you show
As he watched you promise a zero
He waits for you patiently
Hopin' that one day you'll see
That all he really wants to be
Is yours and yours alone eternally
What do you want the boy to do
Don't you see you're breaking the child in two
What do you want the boy to do
Don't you see that you're breaking the child in two <start> My friends and me we live a lot

I only want it to be
Touche d'amour

I'm sailing around the room.
Like never before could never have come too soon.
I want this dance to last forever
For it to last forever more.

I don't wanna hear no more.
So call somebody baby I'll be useless in the morning.
My heart is all in tatters I ain't nobody's saint.
I'm just trying not to call you trying not to call you.
And I learned the rules out with the wolves.
I'm vicious now honey cruel and unprincipled.
With tears in my eyeballs wine on my lips uh huh.
And all my love my love is a plague.
Ain't that a shame Ain't that a shame
I throb and wince and weep just the same
I can't feel a thing ain't that a shame
Now somebody hit the lights get the ropes and medicines
And think about it sugar and how it's gonna end.
Last night I was freezing tonight I'm soaking wet.
Well I must've had a fever salivating in my bed.
And I learned the rules out with the wolves.
I'm vicious now honey dumb and insatiable.
With tears in my eyeballs your name on my lips uh huh.
And all my love my love is a plague.
Ain't that a shame Ain't that a shame
I throb and wince and weep just the same
I can't feel a thing ain't that a shame
And all my love she's a plague ain't that a shame
And you know you're gonna wait so long time slips away.
Till you can't feel the kick my how we've changed.
I stood on the platform waiting in vain blue light my baby
And all my love my love is a plague.
Ain't that a shame ain't that a shame
Like poisonous fingers right in your veins
Who do you love who do you blame
Nobody knows what trouble I'm in.
Ain't that a shame ain't it a shame
My poisonous fingers inside your veins
They gonna get you someday
Now ain't that a shame <start> Every now and then I hear a song I used to know
Playing late at night on radio
And I remember when the schooldays finally had to end
We were neatly wrapped and sent off in a row
To be champions of the world
We can take on anyone
Nothing's going to keep us from the door
We're taking it to the top oh yes indeed we are
We've come this far
We're taking it to the top oh yes indeed we will
We've got the skill
We're taking it to the top hitting them from the heart
Too late to stop right from the start
Up to the top giving it all we've got
To the top of the hill right now
Working on the window of a boardroom in the sky
Business men in suits go flying by
They're heading for the greatest day that they have ever seen
Selling bridges to the Japanese
We are the champions of the world
We can take on anyone
Nothing's going to keep us on the floor
We're taking it to the top oh yes indeed we are
We've come this far
We're taking it to the top oh yes indeed we will
We've got the skill
We're taking it to the top hitting them from the heart
Too late to stop right now
Taking it to the top oh yes indeed we are
We've come this far
We're taking it to the top oh yes indeed we will
We've got the skill
We're taking it to the top hitting them from the heart
Too late to stop once we have started
To the top giving it all we've got
To the top of the hill right now right now <start> In the heat of the night
You've pushed my juice to the limit
You slide so right
I know that you'ra going down
It's getting harder to breathe
You burn my bones with your fever
I'm gonna get ya while you sleep
I'm gonna wreck ya release your body heat
I'm gonna get yaI know you're gonna come with me
I wanna be your  Hard Attack  Hard Attack
You gonna feel my Hard Attack  Hard Arrack
When you shiver and shake
I'm a man hell bent on a mission
We're doing it good
I'm a tiger on heat tonight
I'm gonna get ya while you steep
I'm gonna wreck ya release your body heat
I'm gonna get yaI know you're gonna come with me <start> Take my hand
I'll show you how
to get up to the slide.
I will be watching
I will be waiting
on the other side.
There'll be time for everything
let's sit
and spell just now
Take my hand 
I'll show you how.
Everything I've ever done
has brought me back to here
everything I have I'd give
to see the future clear.
Know this time
I'll face my fear
say rightt here right now
take my hand 
show me how.

Twenty times there my heart broke
might have broke a couple I guess
but when you show up I swear my heart
poppe'd right through my chest.
Here is how you tie a shoelace
here iss how you climb a tree
here is what you need to do things
way better than me.
I'll be here by your side
as God and time allow
take my hand 
I'll show you how.
Take my hand
take my hand
I'll show you how.
 <start> We both lie silently still
In the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together
We feel miles apart inside
Was it somethin' I said or somethin' I did
Did my words not come out right
Though I tried not to hurt you
Though I tried but I guess that's why they say
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad sad song
Every rose has its yeah it does
I listen to my favorite song
Playin' on the radio
Hear the D.J. say
Love's a game of easy come and easy go
But I wonder does he know
Has he ever felt like this
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could've let you know somehow
I guess every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad sad song
Every rose has its thorns
Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like the knife that cuts you the wound heals
But the scar that scar remains
I know I could have saved our love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love we both
Made our separate ways
But now I hear you've found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife
I guess every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad sad song
Every rose has its <start> Anna lee she's a pain to me
Well now everything she does she's gotta have her own way
She won't do it unless it's her own way
But she can move mountains with the wink of an eye
Bring a man to tears and she don't even try
Chorus
Anna lee. she's the same to me
Well you can't tell her nothing she don't already know
She can change her will ...
She don't want to hear when you speak your mind
She don't hold nothing that she didn't find
Chorus
Well she woke up one morning found herself all alone
Noone will answer on the telephone
Sleeping all alone in a bed full of rain
Noone will answer or feel her pain
Chorus x  <start> When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer a warm embrace
To make you feel my love
When evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love
I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong
I'd go hungry I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
And oh there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet
I could make you happy make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love <start> When the world has seen the light
At the beginning of the day
You will let me call your name
'Cause I love you more than light
And it will always be this way
As long as I believe in life.
When the morning comes too soon
And I am still without your love
You will let me call your name
'Cause I love you more than light
And it will always be this way
As long as I believe in life.
Whatever happened to the girls I used to know
Whatever happened to the places that we'd go
When we were running in and out of time
But all the time we still believed in life.
We were running in and out of time
But still believed in life.
And when the day is almost done
And there is nothing left to say
You will let me call your name
'Cause I love you more than light
And it will always be this way
As long as I believe in life.
Running in and out of time
But still believed in life.
And when the day is almost done
And there is nothing left to say

revolution is not yet

vacant stares and no more words
this is now

it is time to cut it thin
it is time to kill my twin
this is nothing like before <start> Our whole universe was in a hot dense state
Then nearly fourteen billion years ago expansion started wait...
The Earth began to cool
The autotrophs began to drool
Neanderthals developed tools
We built a wall 
Math science history unravelling the mysteries
That all started with the big bang
Since the dawn of man is really not that long
As every galaxy was formed in less time than it takes to sing this song.
A fraction of a second and the elements were made.
The bipeds stood up straight
The dinosaurs all met their fate
They tried to leap but they were late
And they all died 
The oceans and pangea
See ya wouldn't wanna be ya
Set in motion by the same big bang
It all started with the big BANG
It's expanding ever outward but one day
It will pause then start to go the other way
Collapsing ever inward we won't be here it won't be heard
Our best and brightest figure that it'll make an even bigger bang
Australopithecus would really have been sick of us
Debating how we're here they're catching deer 
Religion or astronomy Descartes or Deuteronomy
It all started with the big bang
Music and mythology Einstein and astrology
It all started with the big bang
It all started with the big BANG <start> Please won't you go back out
I'm fast asleep
cant deal with this no more

Aggravation is the inspiration into madness

Waiting for the rising sun
Erase the slate

My religion is a mind condition as it turns out
Hesitating while my soul sits waiting through my blackout
Soon the day will come down when I'll reflect on all those years
My perfect world  sublime and surreal
Waiting for the rising sun
Erase the slate
Erase the slate

Too much pride  could not repent
Can't escape at all

Penicillin Penny she's the queen of the sunset strip
If she ever gives you any then you better see your doctor real quick
From the back seat of Cadillac cars to the floor of men's room bars
She's Penicillin Penny and her future's written in the stars
She's Penicillin Penny and ever since the day she came and came
They say she's had so many she gives 'em all numbers not names
I always call her Hun' but she calls me 
And Penicillin Penny starts to boogie when the day is done
She's Penicillin Penny and if you ever see her passin' through
Better run into your house before she stops and lays a little on you
If you ever let her in your door it takes  million units
Or more to cure the love that Penicillin Penny's gonna lay on you <start> Performed by adam sandler and jon

That it's all been done
Shattered by shock
Nuclear glare
Frozen in fear you're on the air
Bid them goodnight
And a pleasant day
This now concludes your broadcast
Near death experience
It's not your fault
Just be the one in all
Whose fault dissolves
In replay
It just happens over and over <start> Her voice
Somewhere there's a girl
Who's like the shimmer of the wind upon the water
Somewhere there's a girl
Who's like the glimmer of the sunlight on the sea
Somewhere there's a girl
Who's like a swell of endless music
Somewhere she is singing
And her song is meant for me
And her voice it's sweet as angels sighing
And her voice it's warm as summer sky
And that sound it haunts my dreams
And spins me 'round until it seems I'm flying
Her voice
Well I can sense her laughter
In the ripple of the waves against the shoreline
And I can see her smiling
In the moonlight as it settles on the sand
I can feel her waiting
Just beyond the pale horizon
Singing out a melody
Too lovely to withstand
And her voice it's there as dusk is falling
And her voice it's there as dawn steals by
Pure and bright it's always near
All day all night and still I hear it calling
Singing da da da da da da da
Strange as a dream
Real as the sea
If you can hear me now
Come set me free
Oh come set me free
And her voice it's sweet as angels sighing
And her voice it's warm as summer sky
And that sound it haunts my dreams
And spins me 'round
Until it seems I'm flying I'm flying
Strange as a dream
Real as the sea
Her voice is calling to me <start> 
Little Billy drunk on beer
Plops down behind the steering wheel
His prom date pukes on her brand new dress
He wonders who'll clean up the mess
His car skids goes off the road
Hits a tree and then explodes
His death was quick painless they say
Hope when I die I go that way
But you may not be so lucky
You may not be so lucky
You may not be so lucky
You may not be so lucky
Little Debbie drunk on wine
Says she's havin' a very good time
She thinks she's havin' the time of her life
Prom date sharpens a big butcher knife
Like a cheap horror movie on the silver screen
The night is filled with deadly screams
Word gets out of his famous capers
It even made the bigcity papers
You may not be so lucky
You may not be so lucky
You may not be so lucky
You may not be so lucky
President laughs shaves his head
Pushes the button and bombs the Reds
Reds hits back with all they've got
Now we're all in the melting pot
Let's have a big cheer for the government
Who's finally ended our descent
Vaporized masses in the shopping mall
Never got to see the Hbomb fall
Little Billy drunk on beer
Plops down behind the steering wheel
His prom date pukes on her brand new dress
He wonders who'll clean up the mess
His car skids goes off the road
Hits a tree and then explodes
His death was quick painless they say
Hope when I die I go that way
But you may not be so lucky
You may not be so lucky
You may not be so lucky
Never gonna be so lucky
Little Debbie drunk on wine
Says she's havin' a very good time
She thinks she's havin' the time of her life
Prom date sharpens a big butcher knife
Like a cheap horror movie on the silver screen
The night is filled with deadly screams
Word gets out of his famous capers
It even made the big city papers <start> One night out of nowhere
Came a shimmering light
Flowers were fading leaving us cold

Alone in the night
Dark clouds the storm kept on turning
Where's the final sign
Invisible masks burning bridges were falling
Will we all leave behind
Whispers from the forgotten tale
And the wind cries out your name
How long will it take to remember
Are we too blind to see
Hold on to the dream or surrender
We ain't gonna win
In this gamble of sin
Holding on the walls kept on breaking
Resolving to dust
The curse og the chains causing evil and pain
How long will it last
Whispers from the forgotten tale
And the wind cries out your name
How long will it take to remember
Are we too blind to see
Hold on to the dream or surrender
We ain't gonna win
In this gamble of sin
Whispers from the forgotten tale
And the wind cries out your name
How long will it take to remember
Are we too blind to see
Hold on to the dream or surrender
We ain't gonna win
In this gamble of sin <start> Not that long ago
Seems like yesterday
We were caught up in love
We were swept away
Seems like over night
From out of the blue
Something went wrong
Between me and you
Chorus
Oh I'll move on
I'll be strong
Do what I have to do
No matter where you are
You'll always have my heart
I may never get over you
The hopeless dreams insanity
I'm just a fool with a fantasy
I close my eyes
I feel your touch
Just as real as it ever was
Chorus x <start> Just another brain on the campus
Just another man in the field
Just another tall pile of papers
Making it crowded in here
Someone else's workin' your thesis
Someone else's words in your mouth
Someone else's hard work and research
Taking you up in the world
Oh never leave me out
I'm standing by the sidelines
Oh never leave me out
I'm standing by
I'll watch it all from afar
Heaven help me
I'll watch it all fall apart
Heaven help me
Help me help me help me help me
I'll watch it all from afar
Heaven help me
Just another brain on the campus
Just another set of ideas
Just another theory in motion
Waiting on for your to steer
He must be so lonely knowing what you know
Man it must be lonely keeping it on the low
Oh never leave me out
I'm standing by the sidelines
Oh never leave me out
I'm standing by
I'll watch it all from afar
Heaven help me
I'll watch it all fall apart
Heaven help me
Help me help me help me help me
I'll watch it all from afar
Heaven help me
I'll watch it all from afar
Heaven help me
I'll watch it all fall apart
Heaven help me
Help me help me help me help me
I'll watch it all fall apart
Heaven help me <start> It seemed like days had passed
Are you finished
I could no longer
Move my arms
The only thing left in the room
Was the silence
Can you still hear the breaking glass
When it hit my face
Even the mice were laughing
At the smell of pain
Here we go again
To the depths of no return
Please remember I know who you are.
Someday I'll have the strength to tell
As the man looked over me
With his inquiries
I swore you never did it
I licked the sweat from my palms
Alone am I with your face burned in my mind
You are the one  who deserves to die
It should have never been me
Please remember I know who you are
Someday I'll have the strength to tell
I pray for you as a little boy
What must have happened to make you so cruel

Please remember I know who you are
Someday I'll have the strength to tell
On you <start> Wise men say only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I say would it be a sin
'cause I can't help falling in love with you
Like the river flows
Flowing to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things were meant to be
Take my hand take my whole life too
'cause I can't help falling in love with you
No I can't help falling in love with you <start> Amaru
The Victim EP
The Victim
Verse 
Another day in paradise
Another victim for your life
So helpless I fall for it every time
Now I'm backed against the wall
Sedated but I won't forget
The innocence I've lost
Chorus
Yeaaaah
Run away like you don't care
Another day my life is unfair I know
It's all the same nothing's changing
Yeaaaah
Another day my heart is breaking
And now there is no escaping this love
A day in misery
Verse 
Another fight more wasted time
I'm still a victim in your eyes
You're reckless it all falls apart tonight
I'm gonna walk right out that door
'Cause I won't take anymore
It's over now it's over
Chorus
Yeaaaah
Run away like you don't care
Another day my life is unfair I know
It's all the same nothing's changing
Yeaaaah
Another day my heart is breaking
And now there is no escaping this love
A day in misery

Ooooooo ooo ooooooo
Ohhh...Yeah yeah yeah...ooo
Run away like you don't care
Another day my life isn't fair
Ooooooo
Chorus
Yeaaaah
Run away like you don't care
Another day my life is unfair I know
It's all the same it's all the same
Yeaaaah
Another day my heart is breaking
And now there is no escaping this love
A day in misery
Another day in paradise
Another victim for your life
So helpless I fall for it every time
Lyrics by Hafrican <start> Denise promise me you'll come around
For you you decide to spread
Your wings spread your wings and leave this town
Denise there's something you should know
I hid the bottle in the woods
To mark the spot where I first realized
That what we have is more than good
And seems to shine a light behind my eyes
Denise if only just to hear the sound
Of you breathing in my ear
I swear I'd let them put me in the ground
Denise I will not be ignored
I hid the bongs behind the shed
To mark the spot where I first saw clear
Where what we have will never die
And everybody else can disappear <start> The wind blows hard across the Texas plains
Makes some people go insane
While others quietly pray for rain
The's where we came from
Two boys playing in the burning sun
One with books and one with guns
Mama calls but just one comes
The other one runs
With a Christian sense of wrong and right
We were born and raised in black and white
One learned to pray one learned to fight
We were born and raised in black and white
My brother took to the gospel road
Spent his whole life saving souls
When he looked at me and his blook ran cold
He didn't even try
I had no dreams and I had no plans
But a gun felt good in my right hand
Warden said 'how come you killed that man'
I said 'I don't know why'
Welcome home said the hot moonlight
We were born and raised in black and white
One lives to pray one wants to die
We were born and raised in black and white
We were born and raised in black and white
Someone handed me a cigarette
They offered me my last request
I asked my moral soul be blessed
By someone close to me
I came to him with trembling hands
I swore I'd never understand
He said its just what life had planned
It's destiny
So don't waste your tears on me tonight
We were born and rasied in black and white
You chose the dark I chase the light
We were born and raised in black and white
We were born and raised in black and white
The wind blows hard across the Texas plains
Makes some people go insane
While others quietly pray for rain <start> Breakin' rocks in the hot sun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I needed money 'cause I had none
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I left my baby and it feels so bad
Guess my race is run
She's the best girl that I ever had
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the
Robbin' people with a sixgun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I lost my girl and I lost my fun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I left my baby and it feels so bad
Guess my race is run
She's the best girl that I ever had
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the <start> Like the first apartment that we had
That bumpy little couch that made into a bed
The shower down the hall and footsteps overhead
She said It's just fine
Times were hard for us for quite awhile
But through those hungry days she faced it with a smile
Not wanting me to know she's carrying my child
She tried to ease my mind
And for my woman's love
For my woman's love
Each day I thank the Lord above
For my sweet woman's love
Through the years of moving town to town
Still searching for a dream somehow we never found
And wondering if we would ever settle down
Her love never died
And if I am anything today I owe it to the love I had along the way
No matter what went wrong
No matter come what may
She stood by my side
And for my woman's love
For my woman's love
Each day I thank the Lord above
For my sweet woman's love
And for my woman's love
For my woman's love
Each day I thank the Lord above
For my sweet woman's love <start> I'd like to jettison your medicine
back to where you came from
you keep your bell and edison
away from my grandson
stand son on your own bone
don't forget the home that you came from
don't let them say your name wrong
Just like Larry I'll take it to the hoop
make one false move in one fell swoop
and then I pass it to the trigger man
bow down to the sound if you still can
XHD
I got my beautiful dutiful cargo 
plenty of misshalls and plenty of cat calls
and I can attest to the rest of the best stalls
but never have I ever made a match with sickness
look both ways and Dispatch with a quickness
gimme some roy and gimme some speed
gather all around to the world and read on
'til you get to the part that's righteous
it's an unbearable likeness
XHD
I got my beautiful dutiful cargo  <start> Put and opening shot. Across your bows.
Got tunnel vision. Pull the sheets in now.
Let'em flap. Let'em rip.
This man of war gonna sink your ship.
Gonna blow you midships.
Gonna dive tonight.
There's no release when your deep down inside.
Davey Jones gonna keep your bones.
No monkey buisness. Now your on your own.
Turn your stern and cover me.
We're rolling swell. Just an old sea dog like me.
Gonna blow you midships.
Gonna dive tonight.
There's no release till your deep down inside.
CHORUS
Dive Dive Dive
Dive Dive Dive
Dive Dive Dive
No muff too tuff.
We dive at five.
Seamen Staines is down below.
Torpedoes loaded. He's ready to go.
Wait to discharge. Waiting to release.
I see where the bones came up from below.
Gonna blow you midships.
Gonna dive tonight.
There's no release till your deep down inside.
CHORUS. <start> Wider than a smile
The truth can be unkind
To take the only one
You thought you were someone
No apologies
I live the life I lead
I hope you understand
That none of this was planned
No apologies
I live the life I lead
I hope you understand
That none of this was planned
Who am I to ask you why
You feel the way you do
If you feel the way you do
Is there something we could do <start> Rocking around the Christmas Tree
at the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Ev'ry couple tries to stop
You will get a sentimental feeling When you hear voices singing
Let's be jolly Deck the halls with boughs of holly Rocking around the Christmas Tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In a new old fashioned way
Rocking around the Christmas Tree
Let the Christmas Spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
and we'll do some caroling
You will get a sentimental feeling When you hear voices singing
Let's be jolly Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Rocking around the Christmas Tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In a new old fashioned way <start> Every time I think of you
It always turns out good
Every time I've held you
I thought you understood
People say a love like ours
Will surely pass
But I know a love like ours
Will last and last
Chorus
But maybe I was wrong
Not knowing how our love should go

But I wasn't wrong
In knowing how our love would grow

And every time I think of you
Every time
Every time I think of you
Every single time
It always turns out good
Seasons come and seasons go
But our love will never die
Let me hold you darling
So you won't cry
Cause people say that our love affair
Will never last
But we know a love like ours
Will never pass
People say a love like ours
Will surely pass
But I know a love like ours
Will last and last
But maybe I was wrong
Not knowing how our love should go

But I wasn't wrong
In knowing how our love would grow

And every time I think of you
Every time I think of you
Every time I think of you
It always turns out good
Every time I think of you
Every time I think of you
Every time I think of you 
Every time I think of you 
Every time I think of you 
Every time I think of you  <start> 
Everybody's gettin' funky
In the days when the funk was gone
I recall not long ago
When the funk it was goin' strong
Now they were rocking upside the wall 
Rockin' out in the hall 
Now they were jumpin' up and having a ball 
Music's got them beggin' for more
Give me more give me more
Come on
Give me more
Give me more of that
Good old funky music yeah
Good old funky music yeah
Yes indeed they're movin'
Yes they are doin' it to and fro
Yes indeed they're groovin'
To that music that will let them go
You know they started somewhere round about midnight 
And they rocked it all night until daylight 
Music that was groovin' my mother 
It's groovy for my sister and brother
Give me more give me more 
Give me more
Give me more of that
Good old funky music yeah
Good old funky music yeah
Music that was groovin' my mother 
It's groovy for my sister and brother
Good old funky music yeah
Good old funky music yeah <start> I never thought I'd die alone
I laughed the loudest who'd have known
I traced the cord back to the wall
No wonder it was never plugged in at all
I took my time I hurried up
The choice was mine I didn't think enough
I'm too depressed to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone
I never conquered rarely came
 just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide too late to try
The tour was over we'd survived
I couldn't wait till I got home
To pass the time in my room alone
I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never set foot in my room again
You'll close it off board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell mom this is not her fault
I never conquered rarely came
 just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide too late to try
The tour was over we'd survived
I couldn't wait till I got home
To pass the time in my room alone <start> Close your eyes and try to get to sleep
Now don't you make a peep
Now we hear everything
Shut the door and make it clean and neat
Now you've been so discreet
Now we've seen everything inside your heart of hearts
You know pick yourself up off the floor
And stand now wash away your sin
Now you've got everything
Inside your heart of hearts
You know will you choose to hide it in your soul
If it's wrong and I'm feeling so indifferent
I might be in danger of myself
Shut your mouth and get yourself to sleep
Now don't let then hear you weep
Now you've got everything inside your
Heart of hearts you know will you
Choose to hide it in your soul <start> Men walking 'long the railroad tracks
Going someplace there's no going back
Highway patrol choppers coming up over the ridge
Hot soup on a campfire under the bridge
Shelter line stretching 'round the corner
Welcome to the new world order
Families sleeping in the cars in the southwest
No home no job no peace no rest
Well the highway is alive tonight
But nobody's kidding nobody about where it goes
I'm sitting down here in the campfire light
Searching for the ghost of Tom Joad
He pulls a prayer book out of his sleeping bag
Preacher lights up a butt and he takes a drag
Waiting for when the last shall be first and the first shall be last
In a cardboard box 'neath the underpass
You got a oneway ticket to the promised land
You got a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand
Sleeping on a pillow of solid rock
Bathing in the city's aqueduct
Go
Well the highway is alive tonight
Where it's headed everybody knows
I'm sitting down here in the campfire light
Waiting on the ghost of Tom Joad
Now Tom said Mom wherever there's a cop beating a guy
Wherever a hungry newborn baby cries
Where there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air
Look for me Mom I'll be there
Wherever somebody's fighting for a place to stand
Or a decent job or a helping hand
Wherever somebody's struggling to be free
Look in their eyes Ma and you'll see me
Yeah
The highway is alive tonight
Where it's headed everybody knows
I'm sitting down here in the campfire light
With the ghost of old Tom Joad <start> Hey folks believe in me
'Cause I'm a disciple can't you see
Avoid the horrors of the big microwave
The instant dinner for the man in the cave
I'm sure the lord will forgive your faults
Now you just gimme your gold and follow my call
'Cause I'm one hell of a kid
I'm God's favourite
'Cause me and the lord we got this heavenly deal
He is my master and he taught me to steal
Yeah me and the lord we got this fiftyfifty split
The old man says that I'm one hell of a kid
Yeah the old man says that I'm one hell of a kid
I must be God's favourite
I'm God's favourite
I'm the son of the creator
I make a blind man hear
Now you just open your purse and feel the lord is near
'Cause he know your world It's written down in his book
And I'm his clerk I know what you took
So see you next time at the Jesusshow
'ae
Where blessings are costly and you can't say no
'Cause me and the lord we got this heavenly deal
He is my master and he taught me to steal
Yeah me and the lord we got this fiftyfifty split
The old man says that I'm one hell of a kid

Hey folks listen to me
'Cause I'm one of God's boys can't you see
'Cause I got the answers and you will seek them
Remember the dollars you saved over this weekend
Sins are free but it costs to confess
So your life lately has it been in a mess
'Cause I'm to decide if you are fit
'Cause we got the record and we know what you did
'Cause me and the lord we got this heavenly deal
He is my master and he taught me to steal

U know me  big G don't give blessings for free
Gimme what u got or come down where it's hot
I can rap with Saint Peter  tell what you did <start> Oh lucky day lucky day lucky day.
She finally walked my way.
You know she sauntered up to me.
Kissed me on the lips today.
When you smile when you smile
When you look at me
Oh hazel eyes hazel eyes.
You know you beg me.
Feel like a pain.
I want to see what you've seen.
I want to be who you've been.
I want to go where you go.
'Cause that's alright.
Oh my name is Horizontal.
I live in a darkened hotel.
If you see any love letters from Galveston
Won't you please send them there
They'll be a thousand guitars.
No one can complain about the noise up there.
But the love that we make.
The love that we take.
And the love that we make.
And the love that we take.
I want to see what you've seen.
I want to be who you've been.
I want to go where you go.
'Cause it's alright.
I want to see what you've seen.
I want to be who you've been.
I want to go where you go.
'Cause that's alright.
That's alright.
That's alright.
That's alright. <start> Mary wore three links of chain
Every link was Jesus' name
Keep your hand on that plow hold on
Oh Lord oh Lord keep your hand on that plow hold on
Mary Mark Luke and John
All these prophets are dead and gone
Keep your hand on that plow hold on
Oh Lord oh Lord keep your hand on that plow hold on
Well I've never been to Heaven
But I've been told streets up there
Are lined with gold
Keep your hand on that plow hold on
Oh Lord oh Lord keep your hand on that plow hold on
Oh Lord oh Lord keep your hand on that plow hold on
Oh Lord oh Lord keep your hand on that plow hold on <start> If home is where the heart is
Then we're all just fucked
I can't remember
I can't remember
And I want it so bad
I'd shoot the sunshine into my veins
I can't remember the good old days
And it's kind of funny
The way we're wearing anchors on our shirts
When being anchored aboard just feels like a curse
My mind is a safe
And if I keep it then we all get rich
My body is an orphanage
We take everyone in
Doing lines of dust and sweat
Off last night's stage
Just to feel like you
The milligrams in my head
Burning tobacco in the wind
Chasing the direction
Chasing the direction
Chasing the direction you went
You're a bottled star
The planets align
Just like Mars
You shine in the sky
You shine in the sky
Are all the good times getting gone
They come and go and come and go and come and go
I've got a lot of friends who are stars
But some are just black holes
My mind is a safe
And if I keep it then we all get rich
My body is an orphanage
We take everyone in
Doing lines of dust and sweat
Off last night's stage
Just to feel like you
And it's kind of funny
The way we're wearing anchors on our shirts
When being anchored aboard just feels like a curse
My mind is a safe
And if I keep it then we all get rich
My body is an orphanage
We take everyone in
Doing lines of dust and sweat
Off last night's stage
Just to feel like you
If home is where the heart is
Then we're all just fucked <start> The sun is up
I'm so happy I could scream
And there's nowhere else in the world I'd rather be
Than here with you
It's perfect
It's all I ever wanted
I almost can't believe that it's for real
I really don't think it gets any better than this
Vanilla smile
And a gorgeous strawberry kiss
Birds sing we swing
Clouds drift by and everything is like a dream
It's everything I wished
Never guessed it got this good
Wondered if it ever would
Really didn't think it could
Do it again
I know we should
The sun is up
I'm so fizzy I could burst
You wet through and me headfirst
Into this is perfect
It's all I ever wanted
Ow It feels so big it almost hurts
Never guessed it got this good
Wondered if it ever would
Really didn't think it could
Do it some more
I know we should
Say it will always be like this
The two of us together
It will always be like this
Forever and ever and ever
Never guessed it got this good
Wondered if it ever would
Really didn't think it could
Do it all the time
I know that we should <start> I'm not asking for forever
And I don't need much of your time
And I know we can't be together
You should know I'm on your side
I swear I'll always be
It's alright for you to be scared
I'll drive all night or go anywhere
If someday the stars don't align
We'll go our own ways
But you should know I'm always on your side
I could have treated you better
Something else I could've tried
And I don't have to be the one you dream about
Well you should know I'm on your side
I swear I've always been
It's alright for you to be scared
I'll drive all night or go anywhere
If someday the stars don't align
We'll go our own ways
But you should know I'm always on your side oh
And I don't know where you are
But I know where you've been
You're just a small town girl
You're trying to kill her not fair
And I don't know where it started
But I hope that it ends up
In you being happy
Wherever you are forever
I'm not asking for forever
And I don't need much of your time
It's alright for you to be scared
I'll drive all night or go anywhere
If someday the stars don't align
We'll go our own ways
Yeah yes you know it's always
It's alright for you to be scared
I'll stay up all night and won't go anywhere
If someday the stars don't align
Go our own ways
And yes you know I'm always on your side
Yes you know I'm always on your side <start> What can I say to you
That we haven't said before
I've had enough and i can't take it anymore
And now what should i do
Am i better off without you
All this talk and nothing's changedOh yeah
Nothing left to say
We've said it all anyway
Let's call it quits and go our separate ways
Nothing left to say
Wish it didn't have to end this way
But it doesn't matter anyway
I know you oh so well and i can already tell
What you'll say before the words come out
You've made your points clear
But you're not getting anywhere
There's no need to drag it ohOH yeah
Chorus <start> Just let me go I'm on my own a rolling stone and I'm in the zone.
Don't let me fall just let me know when we'll make it through.
I got that sht that you can bump in your car
Steady lurkin' on my enemies to settle the score
I am never backin' down until the day that I die
And I don't give a fck about no hater
On my life
I am the best at what I do and I will always prevail
And overcome all obstacles while walkin' through hell
And if you got a problem now's the time to speak up
Cause I'm blowing up I'm never gonna stop
Just let me go I'm on my own a rolling stone and I'm in the zone.
Don't let me fall just let me know when we'll make it through.
No matter what the price may be for clarity I'll make it home.
Just let go I'm on my own a rolling stone.
I spit the fire and I'm killin' the track
Ambitious from how many knifes are stabbed in my back
And if you think you know me then you're probably wrong
I spill my heart and soul
So lock and load and keep bringin' it on
I got an anger that runs deep in my blood
And I'm always stayin' true reppin' the city I'm from
And if you got a problem now's the time to speak up
Cause I'm blowin' up I'm never gonna stop
Just let me go I'm on my own a rolling stone and I'm in the zone.
Don't let me fall just let me know when we'll make it through.
No matter what the price may be for clarity I'll make it home.
Just let go I'm on my own a rolling stone.
Don't get it twisted ballistic characteristics when I rip sht intricate
Visions of infinite wisdom empirical spiritual lyrical very cool synonyms
In layman's terms I am the best you must agree
I got that white boy swagger rappin' right down to a T
I got my hand up on the throttle holdin' up a broken bottle
Ready to cut you up and gut you like a fcking avocado
Desperado on the track in fact if I am gone tomorrow
Then my motto is no sorrow no apologies just karma
Don't get it twisted and delete me off yours friends list
Stayin' busy tweeting hatred at me all up in my business
I'm getting kicks outta this sht like it was my sneakers
And the game fears me like a motherfcking wifebeater
Just let me go on my own again
A rolling stone I'm in the zone.
Just let me go I'm on my own a rolling stone and I'm in the zone.
Don't let me fall just let me know when we'll make it through.
No matter what the price may be for clarity I'll make it home.
Just let go I'm on my own a rolling stone.
Just let me go I'm on my own a rolling stone and I'm in the zone.
Don't let me fall just let me know when we'll make it through.
No matter what the price may be for clarity I'll make it home.
Just let go I'm on my own a rolling stone. <start> zasetsu mamire ryuukou ni magire

Aunque estemos lejos nunca nos separaremos
Porque te has metido entre mis huesos
Ahora recuerdo cuando nos conocimos
En la Plaza de la Estrella
Noche de carnaval noche de fiesta
Plaza de la Estrella
Como un alma en pena hasta que no salga el sol
Por la avenida baja un coche como un vendaval
Y en las esquinas la cancin del solitario
T y yo vivimos una historia
Y en realidad ni nos miramos
Llega el 'Reina mora' cargadito de tabaco
Llegan los furtivos con las luces apagadas
Duermen las chalanas salen planeadoras
Entre la calima desde el mar de Portugal
Por la avenida baja un coche como un vendaval
Y en las esquinas la cancin del solitario

When you fall in love you know your done
You got easy eyes to hunt
When the world above needs your blood
And the cold vain to the richest man
They're paid away to steal our hand
There ain't no easy way no there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way no there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way no there ain't no easy way out
It's easy to fall in love
When your on your luck you know your done
And the last kiss had a foolish cause
Straight tired eyes could only haunt
There ain't no easy way no there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way no there ain't no easy way out

For here blood runs cold...

cries from the grave resound in my ears
they hail from beyond my darkest fears
faces of the past are etched in my brain
the women I raped the men I've slain
shades of the dead are sliding on the wall
demons dance in the castle hall

I call upon the sword the mighty Excalibur
grant me the skill to fulfill my quest
I call upon my king and the knights of the table round
grant me the courage to stand to this test
I call upon the seer Merlin the sorcerer
grant me the magic to end my pain
I call upon the spirit that lives in a noble heart
grant me the passion that's within my veins

and i'll always fall forever in her

i cannot break

and i'll keep you safe
the monster's gone.

I don't belong here
i can't taste her skin

No matter who's driving or for how far.
Feels so good yeah it's been so long.
No fancy drivers tell us how to drive
Me and the boys.
Just me and the boys.
Me and the boys.
Me and my buddies just like to go
We're having fun. Everybody knows.
We don't fuss and we never cry.
We're just grooving taking in the sights.
Me and the boys.
Just me and the boys.
Me and the boys.
Don't raise questions about how it's done.
We're just messing round having fun.
The car gears shifting well up and down.
The muffler smells a lot but we love the sound.
Me and the boys.
Just me and the boys.
Me and the boys.
It ain't like us to hang around this town
Cause squares just bring us down.
I've got to find me something new.
Don't want to think about what they do.
The future's coming round and we don't care
Cause wherever we're going we'll soon get there.
Me and the boys
Just me and the boys
Me and the boys. <start> De bejaardenbond uit Klazinaratjetoe
Die kreeg een briefje ze mochten naar de TV toe
Met een hele bus naar de Vakantieman
Ze maakten er een gezellig dagje van
Iedereen in het nieuw en iedereen blij
Na drie uur rijden kwamen zij aldaar
Ze moesten snel gaan zitten heel dicht op elkaar
De regisseur riep en zo meteen bekken dicht
Niet in de camera loensen en klappen is verplicht
Als ik zwaai met mijn papiertje gaan de handen op elkaar
De bejaardenbond kreeg vlaggetjes waarmee ze zwaaien moesten
Maar tante Mien had astma en begon te hoesten
En tijdens de reclame werd tante Mien uit het publiek gehaald
Oprotten teef je hebt in jouw gedrag gefaald
De bejaardenbond moest ook zingen een of ander volkslied
Maar ome jan zonder kunstgebit die lukte dat niet
De regisseur kende geen pardon ome Jan die vloog eruit
This is TV man geen dom dagje uit
Klapvee klapt u even mee
Handen op elkaar een twee hupsakee
Klapvee treurnis op tv
Handen op elkaar een twee hupsakee
Ik word er echt niet goed van het maakt mij schijtziek
Neem nou die schandaalprogramma's met dat scheldend publiek
Jan neukte zijn moeder en Kees deed het met de hond
Dat interesseert mij geen fuck dus hou gewoon je mond
Nog erger is die Hansje met zijn Rad van Fortuin
Om nog maar te zwijgen over de pizza's van Van Duin
Lachen en klappen een twee op commando
Je hond doet 't niet beter apport de baas Fernando
Klapvee klapt u even mee
Handen op elkaar een twee hupsakee
Klapvee treurnis op tv
Handen op elkaar ik doe mooi niet mee
De bejaardenbond uit Klazinaratjetoe
Was die avond meer dood dan moe
Ome Jan en tante Mien houden het voortaan wel voor gezien
Naar de Vakantieman gaan de oudjes nooit meer toe
 Hele volkstammen laten zich verleiden om als een idioot met een vlaggetje te gaan zitten zwaaien in een programma als De Vakantieman. Gezellig he  <start> You weave your spell
Your eyes beckon me
Your lips they speak lies and misery
I know it's wrong but I can't turn away
The flames draw near they're telling me to stay
 I'm falling
 I'm falling
Into the fire
Your love burns bright and yet the flames are cold
This time I fear you won't be back no more
When will it end your love consumes my soul
Into the fire I'm being tempted once more
 I'm falling
 I'm falling
Into the fire <start> You know I I've
Got a little problem
I have to be the one
The second guy to none
Well I've got
A pretty little girlfriend
Who tells me all the time
That she'll be forever mine
And she says
That your baby loves you
Yes your baby loves you
When your baby loves you
Then nothings gonna hurt you
Sometimes
I lie here with my eyes open
With so much on my mind
My teeth begin to grind
And she'll just hold me
Repeating through my senses
Now every thing's okay
When I will hear her say
When she says
That your baby loves you
Yes your baby loves you
When your baby loves you
Then nothings gonna hurt you
When your baby loves you
All your dreams can come true
When your baby loves you
Then nothings gonna hurt you
Baby loves you
Hold me tonight
Love me tonight

Come on pretty baby

You dreams can come true
When your baby loves you
Then nothings gonna hurt you

Ooh <start> You think you're not worthy
I'd have to say I agree
I'm not worthy of you
You're not worthy of me
Which of us is deserving
Look at the human race
The whole planet at arm's length
And we don't deserve this place
What good is a poker face
When you've got an open hand
I was supposed to be cool about this
Yeah I remember cool was the plan
Tried to keep it all under wraps
But the wraps kept going slack
I keep turning around
I keep coming back
Give me your vertical
Your horizontal line
I want to take each of them
Bend them to fit mine
The world is too good for me
I am such a naughty girl
But when we're together
We're too good for this world
You think you're not worthy
I'd have to say I agree
I'm not worthy of you
You're not worthy of me
I'm not worthy of you
You aren't worthy of me... <start> Nothing to do in the city
Can't get nothing to eat it's only am
All the girls they look at me funny
They don't know nothing and I gotta get out
Get up get out get loose
Get up get out get loose
Get up get out get loose
Monkeys on my TV
Speak to beggars on a Friday night
I got the blues walking all over my streets
I keep my head on I keep shaking no I gotta get out
Get up get out get loose
Get up get out get loose
Get loose

The original conjuring cat
Please listen to me...
And don't scoff
All his inventions are of his own bat
There's no such cat
In the metropolis
He holds all the Pitan monopolies
For performing surprising illusions
And creating eccentric confusions
The greatest magicians have something to learn
From Mr. Mistoffelees's conjuring turn
And we all say
Oh well I never was there ever
A cat so clever as magical
Mr. Mistoffelees
Oh well I never was there ever
A cat so clever as magical
Mr. Mistoffelees
He is quiet and small he is black
From the ears to the tip of his tail
He can creep through the tiniest crack
He can walk on the narrowest rail
He can pick any card from a pack
He is equally cunning with dice
He is always deceiving you into believing
That he's only hunting for mice
He can play any trick with a cork
Or a spoon and a bit of fish paste
If you look for a knife or a fork
And you think it was merely misplaced
You have seen it one moment
And then it is gone
But you find it next week
Lying out on the lawn
And you'll all say
Oh well I never was there ever
A cat so clever as magical
Mr. Mistoffelees
Presto
Oh well I never was there ever
A cat so clever as magical
Mr. Mistoffelees
His manner is vague and aloof
You would think there was nobody shyer
But his voice has been heard on the roof
When he was curled up by the fire
And he's sometimes been heard by the fire
When he was about on the roof
At least we all heard that somebody purred
Which is uncontestable proof
Of his singular magical powers
And I've known the family to call
Him in from the garden for hours
When he was asleep in the hall
And not long ago
This phenomenal cat
Produced seven kittens
Right out of a hat
And we'll all say
Oh well I never was there ever
A cat so clever as magical
Mr. Mistoffelees
Oh well I never was there ever
A cat so clever as magical
Mr. Mistoffelees
Oh well I never was there ever
A cat so clever as magical
Mr. Mistoffelees
Oh well I never was there ever
A cat so clever as magical
Mr. Mistoffelees
Oh well I never was there ever
A cat so clever as magical
Mr. Mistoffelees
Oh well I never was there ever
A cat so clever as magical
Mr. Mistoffelees

I give you the magical Marvelous Mr. Mistoffelees <start> Baby I've been drifting away
Dreaming all day
Of holidng you
Touching you
The only thing I want to do
Is be with you
As close to you

Until all our strength is gone
Hold on tight
Just let go
I want to feel you in my soul
Until the sun comes up

Everything inside of me
Is wanting you
And needing you
I'm so in love with you
Look in my eyes

Until all our strength is gone

Ik zal de doos bewaren
Totie vol is

Wees nog even zoals nu
Wees nog even hier

They took the name right out of your mouth
Hollow heart your hollow heart

Into yourself <start> It was never easy growing up with you
Your words  actions left me confused
The way you think about things makes the mad
You tried to teach me your version of bad
I never saw the reasons for your hate
I don't think you had one any way
Now I'm older opinionated and I'm strong
So shut your mouth and listen to this song
Your way of thinking is fucking wrong
And I know I can't change you with this song
But maybe I can make you stop to think
We're all connected you're just the weakest link
Conditioned to hate without a reason
I don't understand what you believe in
No color no race no religion no creed
No reason to hate why can't you see <start> So I'll tell you I love her. That is what I'll tell myself. But there's something I'm hiding cause I'm afraid of what she might find out. We're going to start this right. It's going to end tonight. I'm gonna make sure everything will end up white. This is where you wanted to be. I bet that now if I said anything you wouldn't believe me. Like when I say it is what it is meant to be. <start> I feel safe inside the violence
Like I feel safe inside a rollercoaster car
I feel safe in the hills up above it all
Sometimes in the middle of the night
I can almost see the stars
Living in L.A. makes me think of you
I think about the good times doing
All the bad things that we used to do
I walk the streets at night
To remember why I feel so bad
I walk the streets at night
It helps sometimes to remember why
Living in L.A
Feels like home in a brand new way
I am like everyone I meet
I have a ghost in my eyes
That will never go away
I walk the streets at night
To understand why I feel so bad
I walk the streets at night
To understand why I am the way I am
We come from a sun
We're lost out in the cold
We run from the light
It's the only way we know
I wanna find a better sun
I wanna find a better world
I wanna find a better heart
So I can find me a better girl
I wanna find a place to live inside
All the violence and the rage
Oh the Santa Ana wind
On a sunny day
Living in L.A
Is the west coast without your head in the sand
Can't explain this place
If you're not from here you will never understand
I walk the streets at night
I think about all the lives that I have had
I walk the streets at night
I think about why all the love that I can't have
We come from a sun
We're lost out in the cold
We fight for the light
It's the only way we know
I wanna find a better sun
I wanna find a better shine
I wanna find a better world
I wanna find a better life
I wanna find a place to live inside
All the violence and the rage
Oh the Santa Ana wind
On a beautiful day
Yeah it is the simple things
That I love about this place
Sunshine and Mexican food
On a Christmas day
Oh the noise in the city
Is the only way to fall asleep
I think I needed to leave
To realize that this is all
This is where I'm suppose to be
We come from a sun
We're lost out in the cold
We fight for the light
It's the only way we know
I wanna find a better sun
I wanna find a better shine
I wanna find a better world
I wanna find me a better life
I wanna find a place
To hide inside all the violence and the rage
But the Santa Ana wind
On a winter's day
I can almost see the future
I can almost see the blue sky
In the middle of the day
Even though all hell is coming down around me now
My Santa Ana wind
Maybe the clouds are gray <start> Falling and spinning
Losing and winning
Keeping my head
Watching for signals
Wearisome vigil
Was I misled
I remember you said
That you don't want to forget me
It doesn't matter
Which of our fantasies fled.
Every tomorrow
Looking to borrow
A piece of today
Run a bit faster
Here comes the catcher
Making his play
You had better not stay
You will soon be surrounded
It doesn't matter
Which of our fantasies stay.
Lonely and winsome
Calling for someone
Living right now
Something is shallow
Ugly and hollow
Doesn't even allow you
To want to know how
You might
Live for the living
Give for the giving
Moment by moment
One day at a time
It doesn't matter
It's nothing but dreaming
Anyhow. <start> lets have a little bit of rhythm
and a little bit of blues now
and now the swinging bass guitar one time
and now you got cold ryhthm and blues
Well if your hands start aclapping and your fingers start apopping
And your feet start amoving around
And if you start to swing and sway when the band start to play
A real cool and wayout sound
And if you get the Can't Help It when you can't sit down
You feel like you gotta move around
You get a shot of rhythm and blues
With just a little rock and roll on the side
Just for good measure
You get a pair of dancing shoes
Well with your lover by your side
Don't you know you're gonna have a lot of pleasure
Don't you worry 'bout a thing when you start to dance and sing
Until bumps come up on you
And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets her too
Well here's the thing for you to do
Get a shot of rhythm and blues
With just a little rock and roll on the side
Just for good measure
Get a pair of dancing shoes
Well with your lover by your side
Don't you know you're gonna have a lot of pleasure
Don't you worry 'bout a thing when you start to dance and sing
Until bumps come up on you
And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets her too
Well here's the thing for you to do
Get a shot of rhythm and blues
Get a pair of dancing shoes
Get a shot of rhythm and blues
Well with your lover by your side
Don't you know you're gonna have a lot of pleasure
Don't you worry 'bout a thing when you start to dance and sing
Until bumps come up on you
And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets her too
Well here's the thing for you to do
Well here's the thing for you to do
Well here's the thing for you to do <start> All our needs put together
Don't bleed on their own
You paid for an eyeful
So behold the bull
Why can't I look up 
Tell me what's there below 
While he's safe for the moment 
He's never safe from the crowd come one
So hats off to the bull
No giving up


Hats off to the bull keep giving all

To be monumental
Could mean the beyond
The simpler the treasure
Means the higher the cost
Well as for the ending damn right I'm learning
You might ask for the door end over end
Well I hate how the clouds hide
The gasps from above
So hats off to the bull
No giving up


Hats off to the bull keep giving all

Find your challenge suffer miles
Colors gray he brings them out
Don't mind the challenge suffer miles
A little shallow if I don't say
Hats off to the bull
His time ain't up

For some of us
Hats off to the bull
The sun won't set

So hats off to the bull
No giving up


Hats off to the bull keep giving all

Hats off to the bull
No giving up
Hats off to the bull
Keep giving up
Hats off to the bull
No giving up
Hats off to the bull <start> Do you remember how to say please
You've had your own way for such a long time
Your lash is sweet now I dry your cheek
You think I'm powerless when you weep
You may have something I don't deny
You look too beautiful when you cry
If I seem unconcerned
Perhaps it's time you learned
I'll cry until you suspect my tears
I'll cry until you suspect my tears
You're not the only one who can turn it on
Where and when you need to
Do you remember how bad it felt
Big eyes would fill up
That lip would tremble
You want to hurt me
Make me feel guilty
You always promise to lose control
I stole the trick that you used to play
I'm tired of you having it your own way
With the power to persuade
Beginning to cascade <start> Another rhyme you wrote last night for what and why
Nature is a bitch you can't decide to deny
Another guide you bought last night for what and why
Nature is a bitch that shows the way
To where you need to go
Who told you it's easy to be happy
Who told ya Who told ya
Who told you it's easy to be happy
Who lied to you
Troubles come and you do whatever you can do
Troubles come and they're all gray
Troubles come and you run away from your mistakes
Troubles come just to piss your days
You don't need to fight them
They'll turn out just ok
Living is not a mistake
Do just what you please
Beware of all your needs
And try not to exceed
I think you'll be ok <start> 
Don't think sorry's easily said
Don't try turning tables instead
You've taken lots of Chances before
But I'm not gonna give anymore
Don't ask me
That's how it goes
Cause part of me knows what you're thinkin'
Don't say words you're gonna regret
Don't let the fire rush to your head
I've heard the accusation before
And I ain't gonna take any more
Believe me
The sun in your Eyes
Made some of the lies worth believing
Chorus
I am the eye in the sky
Looking at you
I can read your mind
I am the maker of rules
Dealing with fools
I can cheat you blind
And I don't need to see any more
To know that
I can read your mind I can read your mind
Don't leave false illusions behind
Don't Cry cause I ain't chnaging my mind
So find another fool like before
Cause I ain't gonna live anymore believing
Some of the lies while all of the Signs are deceiving <start> The party's at it's end

If it's a new beginning then I don't want to know
If its not worth pretendingthen I don't want to know
I'm just so sick of listening what should I want to know
I lost my  minutes on eurodisco
The musics in my head
I thought music was dead
Give me the words I'll sing
But I can't feel a thing....
I'll be there pump it up pump it up pump it up bah bad up
Just don't stop just don't stop just don't stop stop dah dah dop

Traveling out far
This driving music makes us feel
More than we ever are
Trying hard to get away from you

Long hot summer days
Traveling out far

Make us feel more than we ever are
Trying hard to get away from you
But sure enough Im falling apart <start> Seul face au destin
Seul sur mon chemin
Me voici rclamant tout de ma vie
Et je ferai mon chemin
Te laissant loin trs loin
Tu devras t'carter
Oubliant notre amiti
L'ambition est mon seul but
Moi qui me croyais perdu
Seul face au destin
Seul tendant les mains
J'ai perdu l'amour par ta faute
J'ai connu de longues nuits sans fin
Mais tu n'en savais rien
Oui tu as su me perdre
A ses yeux  mes rves
Vois ma colre gronde
Maintenant qu'j'ai les dents longues
Et tu devras t'carter
Oubliant notre amiti
L'ambition est mon seul but
Moi qui me croyais perdu
Et je ferai mon chemin
Te laissant loin trs loin
Tu devras t'carter
Oubliant notre amiti <start> You walked into the room
I smelt your perfume
And I could see your body talkin'
Got up and grabbed the chance
C'mon we're gonna dance
'Cause I can see your body talkin'
You never said a thing
But baby just the same
The things you weren't sayin'
Kept poundin' in my brain
Right there on the floor
I saw you wanted more
'Cause I could see your body talkin'
I feel every quiver
I feel every shiver
Action speaks louder than words
I know what your sayin'
When your body's swayin'
Girl you got a way to make your feelings heard
You never said a thing
But baby just the same
The things you weren't sayin'
Kept poundin' in my brain
Right there on the floor
You knew I wanted more
And I could see your body talkin'
I can feel your motion
Rockin' like the ocean
Action speaks louder than words
I know what your sayin'
When your body's playin'
Girl you got a way to make your feelings heard
Right there on the floor
You knew I wanted more
And I could see your body talkin'

I feel every shiver
I feel every quiver
I can feel your body talkin'

I can feel your heat now
I can feel your beat now
I can feel your body talkin'
I can feel your body talkin'
I can see your body
I can feel your body
Talkin' talkin'

I can feel your body

Someone that turns your heart around
And next thing you know you're closing down the town
Wake up and it's still with you
Even though you left her way across town
Wondering to yourself Hey what've I found
When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
The best that you can do
The best that you can do
Is fall in love
Arthur he does as he pleases
All of his life he's mastered choice
Deep in his heart he's just he's just a boy
Living his life one day at a time
And showing himself a really good time
Laughing about the way they want him to be
When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
The best that you can do
The best that you can do
Is fall in love <start> Mr. Dali Lamas

Amputees in Freetown

The church wasn't honest
The state put the youth in a harness
Creatin' hostility among us
Teacher said no college
Still the kid's gotta get a check with a couple commas
People wanna bomb us
More people gotta scatter and run from us
You can blame it on Zeus and Apollo and Adonis
But what you've done here
Is put yourself between a bullet and a target
And it won't be long before
You're pulling yourself away
But what you've done here
Is put yourself between a bullet and a target
And it won't be long before
You're pulling yourself away
I've been knowing her for years
I've been seeing her for years
She got dark dark wavy hair
With a voice like she just don't care
She got a skirt with a halter top
She's got a dad who never gave a fuck
She drinks a beer with a malted top
She got knocked up in a pickup truck
But she got engaged when she was nineteen
To this dude who was acting insane
Had a . that he always cleaned
Said one day one day one too many days
Now she ducked and she ran away
Never to be heard from never to be seen
I check the cover of a magazine
I'm just wondering how just wondering how
But what you've done here
Is put yourself between a bullet and a target
And it won't be long before
You're pulling yourself away
You're pulling yourself away
You're pulling yourself away
You're pulling yourself away
A bullet and a target
A bullet and a target

A bullet and a target
Between a bullet and a target <start> Oh come back baby
Oh mama please don't go.
Child the way I love you
Well you'll never know oh.
Chorus
Come back baby
Yeah yeah
Let's talk it over one more time.
Well I admit baby
That I was wrong.
Don't you know baby
Child you've been gone too long.
Chorus
I said if I could holler
Like a mountain jack
I'd go up on the mountain
People I'd call my baby back oh.
Chorus
Now one of these days baby
And it won't be long yeah.
You're gonna look for me child you know
And I'll be gone.
So
Chorus <start> If yer always tryin' to get to the top
You don't get to the bottom of nothin'
Then you're gone before you know it
You'd better stop 
Learn a little givin' and lovin'
It's been done before
C'mon do it again
Coz if it's good
Then you should share it round
What's the use of keeping
All the good things that you've found to yourself
Learn a little learn a little
Learn a little givin'
Learn a little learn a little
Learn a little givin' and lovin'
You don't gotta keep no other man down
For you to get up
There's no need to worry
Just don't give away your selfrespect
Coz if it's all you've got left
The rest don't really matter now anyway honey
But give away love 
And give it for free
No strings attached
Just don't ask for it back
Learn a little learn a little
Learn a little givin'
Learn a little learn a little
Learn a little givin' and stop
Givin Learn a little givin'
It's been done before
C'mon do it again
Learn a little learn a little
Learn a little givin' and lovin' <start> I want my share
of all that I've given to you
Take it take it
Walk all over me
I'm putting that to an end
Right now
Think how you want
but I know I'm living the truth
Break it break it
Get myself clean
and lose all this negative shit
I said
Never again never again
Too hard
Giving myself the power
to make it all end
Take it take it
Be my own man
stand up and never look back
Never
Through my suffering
indulging in all that I could
No lie
Keep myself clean
a fight that I know I can't quit
I said
I know that time will be

Love is a gift we all must give
Love is all there is

There is <start> Well here's a story 'bout a southern gal
She got all the parts and she's built quite well
And her name is Dixie Dynamite
She's a lady with beauty and grace
And she's got all this till you see her face
A pair so big they'll really grab your eyes
Big bad Bill was a man of means
When he come around you hear Dixie scream
They jumped in his Cadillac
Everyday for them was fun
Cruisin' on the highway called one o one
They ain't comin' back no
Dixie won't you be my wife
Dixie Dixie Dynamite
The truckers on their way back from Arkansas
Couldn't believe now what they saw
Dixie driving with her top on down
When the sun come out she don't waste no time
Her and Bill drive to county line
They sit there and talk about their dairy farm
Bill said Dixie won't you be my wife
She said Yeah babe let's share our life
You seem to be the man for me
Dixie got as fat as a horse
Bill dumped her and gave her a divorce
He ran out the back door as fast as he could
Well he traded in his Caddy for some spandex jeans
Now he's a stud and drives a Limousine
He owns a disco club in Hollywood
Dixie won't you be my wife
Dixie Dixie Dynamite <start> Breathe breathe in the air
Don't be afraid to care
Leave but don't leave me
Look around and chose your own ground
For long you live and high you fly
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
And all you touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be
Here's a message to the newborns
Waiting to breath if you believe you can achieve just look at me
Against all odds though life is hard we carry on
Living in the projects broke with no lights on
Here's a message to the newborns
Waiting to breath if you believe you can achieve just look at me
Against all odds though life is hard we carry on
Living in the projects broke with no lights on
No lights on no lights on
Run run rabbit run
Dig that hole forget the sun
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down it's time to dig another one
For long you live and high you fly
But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave
You race toward an early grave
Early grave
Early grave
Breathe breathe in the air
Waiting to breathe breathe
Breathe breathe in the air
Breathe breathe in the air
Waiting to breath breath
Breathe breathe in the air
Here's a message to the newborns

Living in the projects broke with no lights on
No lights on no lights on <start> I opened up the music box
I wish you would have changed the locks
To keep me from replaying
All the feelings I've been saving
I did not keep them locked up inside
I did not take my steps in stride
Thought you were bluffing trampled on you
Went from friends to nothing
Radio turns to gold
And paves the way
To find my home
When I'm alone
Overeager and underway
I risked it all I had to say
What opened me up for the beating
But the heart is for bleeding
With scraps of songs I paste along
The seams of my clumsy tongue
In hopes of creating the golden notes
That might bring you back to me
Radio turns to gold
And paves the way
To find my home
When I'm alone
Like phantoms on the highway
After holiday gritting their teeth
Racing to find a place for their soul
Or at least a place... that's less familiar
We offer up our heart before
The heart's invited or asked for
Oh no here I go my friend I'm repeating
But the heart is for bleeding...
And I've said all I can say
I am retreating on my way
Music box play my song I'll sing along
To that bitterly sweet tone
When I'm alone... <start> We sit you and I one by one on the driver's side of this station wagon
My right hand in your left the sun is setting to the west
We are clutching our bibles tight we musn't forget to light.
To light those candles under asses make them scream and reach for rafters
Clap their hands and stomp their feet and reinstill some dignity
Well its seems to me every time we hit the streets we don't have to try
Every night is like oh...
Every night is like a revival painting strangers faces with smiles
Every night is like a revival and we always do it with style
Well I guess I've always known somehow our loved was blessed
To light those candles under asses make them scream and reach for rafters
Clap their hands and stomp their feet and reinstill some dignity
We'll make our way right back to Queens without the aid of luxury
A quiet ride in our own taxi yeah that's enough for you and me
Well it seems to me every time we hit the streets we don't have to try
Every night is like oh... <start> You can't build the world in bricks and dust.

 <start> Time's running out
I fear I don't have much left to share
Beyond any doubt
There's so much love left in there
Inside my afraid heart
I just want to love ya before I leave
Well I know nothing's for sure
But doctor says I'm gonna go
I'm losing this fight
But not done yet no not tonight
'Cause I know I know
I just want to love ya before I leave
We are all just moments
Passing by one another in this life
And sometimes these moments
Find each other
Don't dare let that go
And cherish every second here
Just let your love show
Say what you feel let what you feel
'Cause I know oh I know
Just want to love ya before I leave
It's getting harder to see
And daylight's turning into dark
Feeling lost and sick
Still waiting to feel some little spark
'Cause I know oh
I just want to love ya before I leave
Someday you'll understand
My constant sense of urgency
No I can't just pretend
This is not an emergency
'Cause I know oh I know
I just want to love ya before I leave
We are all just moments
Passing by one another in this life
Oh and sometimes these moments
Find each other
Don't dare let that go no
Cherish every second here
And just let your love show
Say what you feel let what you feel
'Cause I know oh I know
I just want to love ya before I leave
Uuh...
We are all just moments
Passing by one another in this life
Oh and sometimes these moments
Find each other
Don't dare let that go no
Cherish every second here
And just let your love show
Say what you feel let what you feel
'Cause I know
Just want to love ya before I leave
Hmm...
'Cause I know oh I know
I just want to love ya before I leave... <start> The old home town looks the same
As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my Mama and Papa
Down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green green grass of home
Yes they'll all come to meet me
Arms reaching smiling sweetly
It's good to touch the green green grass of home
The old house is still standing
Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green green grass of home
Then I awake and look around me
At four gray walls that surround me
And I realize yes I was only dreaming
For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre
On and on we'll walk at daybreak
Again I'll touch the green green grass of home
Yes they'll all come to see me
In the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me 'neath the green green grass of home <start> All my trials and tribulations
Have led me to one realization
That no matter where I've been
I'm still stuck inside my skin
And I'm not trying to be something I'm not
Letting their thoughts get in 'cause I
Won't end up twisted and insane
All those fears and reservations
Ended up as amputations
Cause no matter where I've been
I'm still stuck inside my skin
And I'm not trying to be something I'm not
Letting their thoughts get in 'cause I
Won't end up twisted and insane
And I'm not trying to be something I'm not
Letting their thoughts get in 'cause I
Won't end up twisted and insane
And all my insecurities
and my anxieties
Tore out my insides
And it took a while to find
That I don't really mind
Life on the outside
So take up your aim and raise your rifles
Fire Away 'Cause I don't really care at all
And I'm not trying to be something I'm not
Letting their thoughts get in 'cause I
Won't end up twisted and insane
And I'm not trying to be something I'm not
Letting their thoughts get in 'cause I
Won't end up twisted and insane <start> Love leaps into motion
trying to keep hanging on
When i need a reason to wake up
I find you turning
Laughing and smiling
Love you girl but sometimes
I feel like you leave me behind
Now you don't have it mind it
I'll find you shinning
Every day by day
Singing love My sister
In this world
Where everyone is lonely
Everything will be fine someday
Remember playing in the backyard
Hiding myself in your eyes
It seems you never could catch me
I find you crying
Weeping in darkness
Singing love my sister
In this world where everyone is lonely
Everything will be fine someday
Love leaps into motion
trying to keep hanging on
When I need a reason to wake up
I find you turning
laughing and smiling.
Singing love my sister
In this world where everyone is lonely
Everything will be fine
some other day... X
Some other day.... <start> There is something on your mind
By the way you look at me
There is something on your mind honey
By the way you look at me
Can what you're thinking bring happiness
Or will it bring misery
No no please don't try to tell me
I may not understand
No no you don't have to tell me pretty baby
I may not understand
You want me to try and forget you
But I'll do the best I can
If you ever think about me
If I ever cross your mind girl
Girl if you ever think about me pretty baby
If I ever cross your mind
Well you know you know I'm yours
And I know I know you're mine
Dodododo mmm mmm
Dodododo mmm mmm <start> I can't understand she let go of my hand
An' left me here facing the wall
I'd sure like to know why she did go
But I can't get close to her at all
Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime
She said she would never forget
But now morning is clear it's like I ain't here
She acts like we never met
It's all new to me like some mystery
It could even be like a myth
But it's hard to think on that she's the same one
That last night I was with
From darkness dreams are deserted
Am I still dreamin' yet
I wish she'd unlock her voice once an' talk
'Stead of acting like we never met
If she ain't feelin' well then why don't she tell
'Stead of turnin' her back to my face
Without any doubt she seems too far out
For me to return to her chase
Though her skirt it swayed as a guitar played
Her mouth was watery and wet
But now something has changed for she ain't the same
She just acts like we never have met
If I didn't have to guess I'd gladly confess
To anything I might've tried
If I was with her too long or have done something wrong
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is I'll run an' hide
Though the night ran swirling an' whirling
I remember her whispering yet
But evidently she don't evidently she won't
She just acts like we never have met
I'm leavin' today I'll be on my way
Of this I can't say very much
But if you want me to I can be just like you
An' pretend that we never have touched
An' if anybody asks me is it easy to forget
I'll say it's easily done
You just pick anyone
An' pretend that you never have met <start> If I were a kernel in the Unineted States Marine Corps
I'd buy a bunch of drugs
Tell a bunch of lies
Trade the hostages  missiles flyin' in the skies
People become whores  back the corporate wars
Vietnam Nicaragua oh help us my Lord
People never c what should really b
Spreading their disease on them and you and me <start> I brought you back to life
Saw your flesh turn the color of sand
And it still hurts as much this time
As it did when I hit the floor
In Kalamazoo I watched you turn off
It was all I could do to lift my eyes up
It wasn't me then
Who took you to the edge
And watched you fall
It wasn't me then
Testing your desire
By setting fire
To the House of Jupiter
You never said the end
Only spoke to me through mercury
And I escaped the land
Made my way toward history
And California kept me silent
And I find it so hard to stay this quiet
And I will never forget the way
I fell toward what you wanted
And seeing your demise was grand
But I still miss your hands
I still miss your hands
And now I'm flashing back
I see your eyes when they were learning me
And the way you held your breath
When I was naming the stars
But the new year brought too many changes
And you grew tired with my obsession with
Stages <start> I've been waiting all night long
waiting for a friend of mine
I can leave before it falls
Shivers run down my spine
What she gives to me
You could never ever see
When she makes her moves till dawn
When she lays her body down
Tie me up wet me down
Oh she's got that magic touch
Is this love or fascination
I've never seen the world from
This view before
Gotta love em and leave em to beg for more
Is this love or fascination
Dance little darling dance
She'll give it up
That's what love is for <start> now I'm grow in many doubts
cheerful weakness forced me on
from the highest place in space
 dogs don't take away my face
rushing in surrounding me
asking for reason praise of me
 alive steals life from death
only in  knowlege ways will die my final breath <start> Kickin' at the curb strollin' mothers bay
Little naked kid it's where I used to play
Dad paints the house on the stereo
Reggae music plays and it just goes to show
You can't shake what you've been sold
Roots so deep I can feel the fold
Had not a clue that my mind been mold
Now I've gone and done what I've been told
I can't trust no man because of those days
I can't trust no man I can't trust no man
It don't bother me that I grew up this way
They way it was coulda blew my mind away
A scale of dope a couple bars of gold
No man got my trust over my control <start> I'm looking for a man who knows how to finish
Better than to begin
I'm looking for a girl whose age is Virginia
Name around seventeen
I'm looking for a tie that won't get knotted
One that will not be four making five
On I've a reason you see
That's good. tell me where's the door
I like to think it's time I stopped interfering
In peoples private lives
I like to think the bits I find fascinating
Ought to decrease in size
I like to think but then you tell me who doesn't
And I'll tell you a taletail
Is the part you start with when you begin
Or brush If your dog's on sale
I like to think but then you tell me who doesn't
And I'll tell you a sale
Is the time you find out everything's cheap
Only prices remain unchanged
I'm wondering If the girl I married this morning
Wants us to get divorced
I'm wondering If the child we both plan on having
Shouldn't be ordered first
I'm wondering If the pain I have In my left leg
Isn't just In my head
Which Is fine don't mind as long as I'm here
I might as well stay myself <start> Incurable disease on the day of rest
Walking on water in a sea of incest
I've got an image of Jesus
embedded on my chest
I can't leave home without my
bullet proof vest
Killing myself for the perfect honeymoon
fighting with scorpions tied around my neck
I hear the pitter patter
of a killer on the loose
children using their fingers instead of words
crosses burn your temples
on slaughter avenue
It takes too much time to say 'I refuse'
Time is digging graves for the chosen few
Children dig graves for me and you
Describe the illness I'll prescribe the cure
start your two day life
on a two day vacation
I've got a spiritual cramp going for my ribs
Those gangsters toting guns
are shooting spikes through my wrist
children using their fingers instead of words
Fingers bury children under the boards
I can die a thousand times
But I will always be here
with the power skull secrets
of forgotten years
the hangman's noose is trenched
with bloodstains of tears
my hands are the killer that confirms
my tears
Jesus won't you touch me
come into my heart
where the Hell are you
when the fire starts
On a mission of the father
to reduce the gates of hell
the ivory bone eyed mother's flesh
is starting to swell
I'm setting twentytwo tables
for the funeral feast
Satan is by far the kindest beast <start> I know what boys like
I know what guys want
I know what boys like
I've got what boys like
I know what boys like
I know what guys want
I see them looking
I make them want me
I like to tease them
They want to touch me
I never let them
I know what boys like
I know what guys want

Boys like clap
Boys like me

You're so much diffrent

I know what boys like
I know what guys want
I know what boys like
I know whats on there mind
I know what boys like
I know what guys want
They talk about me

That so upsets them
Zippers and buttons
Fun to frustrate them
They get so angry
Like pouty children
Denied their candy
I laugh right at them
i know what boys like

i know what boys like
boys like clap
boys like me
I feel so sad now

Sucker hahaha
I know what boys like
I know what guys want
i know what boys like
Boys like clap
Boys like me <start> So the mourning after heartbreak got me tearstained
And all my cries have hurt my sides in losing you pain
All these bruises and misuses will become scars
Just a norm for tragic born with all their broken hearts
I'm losing grip
Only holding on by finger tips
Cry crimson tears without you
Cry crimson tears without you
Cry crimson tears without you
Crimson tears
So the morning before heartbreak has not yet broke
But my heart bleeds through my flesh in crimson I soak
All this pain corrupts my soul discoloured within
All the crimson is my prison formed from tainted skin
I'm losing grip
Only holding on by finger tips
Cry crimson tears without you
Cry crimson tears without you
Cry crimson tears without you
Crimson tears <start> Close your eyes
And tell me what you see
The two of us
And nothing in between
And run away
With me
Say goodbye
To all the tears you've cried
And all the pain
That you could never hide
And run away
With me
I can make you believe
It's worth it
Don't be afraid to be free
Cause no one's perfect
I'll always be there by your side
Someone said
Love is all you need
So take my hand
I'll show you what he means
Just run away
With me
I can make you believe
It's worth it
Don't be afraid to be free
Cause no one's perfect
I'll always be there by your side
So
You've heard it all before
But there's nothing I want more
So
Oh
I can make you believe
It's worth it
Don't be afraid to be free
Cause no one's perfect
I'll always be there by your side
Yes I'll always be there by your side
Cause I'm here for you
Yes I'm here for you <start> Baby when you hold me
I can feel so wrong
You're trying to console me
Your chance has long gone
So baby won't you take my hand
So we can do what the others can
We are alive tonight we are alive tonight
I am going home forever and ever more
No I was never born and there's no such thing as home
We used to stand so strong
That's why the others have gone
Different person different argument
In my shadow no more compliments
One more person breaking the rules again
I'm still waiting for someone else to join in
Stand where the others stand
We're alive tonight
Land where the others land
We're alive tonight
I am going home forever and ever more
No I was never born and there's no such thing as home
We used to stand so strong
That's why the others have gone
Scintillating and inspirational conversation
Death to everyone
Little purpose little consequence
Too combative too cool to realize
Different person different argument
In my shadow no more compliments
One more person breaking the rules again
I'm still waiting for someone else to join in
Stand where the others stand
We're alive tonight
I am going home forever and ever more
No I was never born and there's no such thing as home
We used to stand so strong
That's why the others have gone <start> This is the best time of the daythe dawn
The final cleansing breath unsullied yet
By acrid fume or deaths cacophony
The rank refuse of unchained ambition
And pray deny me not but know me now
Your faithful retainer stands resolute
To serve his liege lord without recompense
Perchance to fall and perish namelessly
No flagdraped bier or muffled drum to set
The cadence for a final dress parade
But it was not always thusremember
Once you worshipped me and named me a god
In many tongues and made offering lest
I exact too terrible a tribute
Take heed for I am weary ancient
And decrepit now and my time grows short
There are no honorable frays to join
Only mean death dealt out in dibs and dabs
Or horror unleashed from across oceans
Assail me not with noble policy
For I care not at all for platitude
And surrender such tedious detail
To greater minds than mine and nimbler tongues
Singular in their purpose and resolve
And presuming to speak for everyman
Oh for another time a distant field
And there a mortal warriors lonely grave
But duty charges me remain until
The end the last battle of the last war
Until that morrow render unto me
That which is mine my stipend well deserved
The fairest flower of your progeny
Your sons your daughters your hopes and your dreams
The cruel consequence of your conceit <start> Moonlight's in her eyes and I can't see three feet in front of me
And its the middle of the day
Herculean tasks they come and go so easily
When her rods and her cones play
White bluely bathed in Elysian fields they run
And I don't care what time it is
I'd throw my watch away if I could hold the lunar surface
With the flicker of light that she witnesses
And if I'm reaching you
Don't you feel guilty
And there's nothing to do
And you can only help me
And I may never learn
But you can only teach me
I'm not sure where you're trying to go
All I'm saying is that you reach me
Some see the forest for the trees to avoid the trouble
Trouble might be what I'm looking for
Or surely I'd aboutface and on the double
But it just doesn't work anymore
No longer up to me a compass leads the way
Restless evening spirit unwilling to cease
Responsible for what the Ouija board might say
Although it's my finger that moves the piece
And if I'm reaching you
Don't you feel guilty
And there's nothing to do
And you could only help me
And I may never learn
But you can only teach me
I'm not sure where you're trying to go
All I'm saying is that you reach me
I lash myself at the helm as my ship sails her reef
A violent storm is all around me
But before me only calm and welcome waters
As if at last she finally found me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
And if I'm reaching you
Now don't you feel guilty
And there's nothing to do
And you could only help me
And I may never learn
But you can only teach me
I'm not sure where you're trying to go
All I'm saying is that you reach me
And I may never learn
But you can only teach me
I'm not sure where you're trying to go
All I'm saying is that you reach me
The wind chimes and you're mine a thousand times
Until my rhymes and other crimes have aged like wine
You are sublime so fine
You reach me
You reach me <start> I can't take it I can't take it
I can't make it move in time
I can't take it I can't take it
I can't make it pass me by
As I stand paralysed like stone
And the future just became the day
I wonder what it was I was doing that seemed so urgent
Anyway
As I do everyting but what's important
I slip back into peace
I wonder why I keep on bothering to look back
Endlessly
Everything fast forwards right past me
And all I seem to be able to do is just stand there
And grieve
prechorus
For myself for my life
For the things that feel behind
I couldn't hold on to it all
With so much on my mind
If I picked up another piece
I couldn't keep on juggling
Those I have without blinking back these tears
chorus
 think what you see is real
 want to know what I believe
 and see through me
 that will never be
As I stand with my jaw hung slack
I realise it's not too late to try
I wonder what will happen if I just let this last deadline
Pass me by
As the water rushes to my lips and I slowly begin to drown
I wonder what took the pressure so long to finally
Break me down
Everything fast forwards right past me
And all I seem to be able to do is just stand there
And grieve
I can't take it I can't take it
I can't make it move in time
I can't take it I can't take it
I can't make it pass me by
chorus

It's too late to replay
The future is here just clear the way
Can't undo your mistakes
The time is now no more delay
I can't take it
I can't make it move in time
I can't take it
I can't make it pass me by <start> I went down among the dust and pollen
to the old stone fountain in the morning after dawn
underneath were all these pennies fallen from the hands of children
they were there and then were gone
and I wonder what became of them
what became of them
sunlight over me no matter what I do
apples in the Summer are golden sweet
everyday a passing complete
I'm not one to ever pray for mercy
or to wish on pennies n the fountain or the shrine
but that day you know I left my money
and I thought of you only
all that copper glowing fine
and I wonder what became of you
what became of you
Sunlight over me no matter what I do
apples in the summer are golden sweet
everyday a passing complete
apples in the summer are golden sweet
everyday a passing complete
In the morning waking up to terrible sunlight
All diffuse like skin abused
The sun is half its size
When you talk you hardly even look in my eyes
in the morning in the morning
In the doorway holding that letter I wrote
in the driveway pulling away putting on your coat
in the ocean washing off my name from your throat
in the morning in the morning
in the ocean washing off my name from your throat
in the morning in the morning
Green apples hang from my tree
they belong only to me
Green apples hang from my green apple tree
they belong only to only to me
and if I just stay awhile here staring at the sea
and the waves break ever closer ever near to me
I will lay down in the sand and let the ocean leave
carry me to Innisfree like pollen on the breeze <start> Odori ga subete no shoujo
Wo dakikakae asa wo matsu

Wo furu kimi sae mou inai kara
Ari fureta hibi sae ima

No shoujo dakikakae <start> Come on now the curtain is drawn
And tomorrow stands before you
Dressed and draped in a cold black cape
Like a crow he ignores you
Look again there's a beautiful girl
Covers sin in a holy land shroud
It's the great disappearing act
Done once again for the marveled crowd
As we're chasing our tails
And biting our nails
So strong and frail
Chorus
And we build and tear down
Build and tear down
Build and tear down
With barely the time to say
How did it get so late
I'll never know
Step outside and now the doors open wide
And the minions are eager to find him
Put a million miles under your heels
And you're still behind him
Cover your clocks with your chains and your locks
While the seasons get hotter and colder
Stretch your faces and lie about your ages
And still you're going to get older
As we're chasing our tails
And biting our nails
So strong and frail
Chorus
I'll never know
Hang on till your fingers break
And your hands unwind
He will escape you every time
From under your pillows
Through open windows
And out on the rails
Chorus
I'll never know
I'll never know <start> I like how you get when I get out of line
You say all the right things I have no reply
I like how you butt in
And make me take a good look around
Yea you make me take a good look around yeah
You make me take a good look around
I fail to remember remember sometimes
I guess thats your way then of training my mind
That ends are beginnings
And that everything thats lost is found yeah
Yea everything thats lost is found
Everything thats lost is found
Mmmmhmmm
If Id only known you
Right from the start
It wouldve been easier
To tend to my heart
But now we are together
And I know well make it work somehow yeah
Were gonna make it work somehow yeah
Were gonna make it work somehow
In desperate times when I am weak
In times when it is blood I seek
When nothings going the way I planned
And in times that I cannot understand
When I go after things beyond my reach 
When I question how Ill stand the heat 
You come to me to let me know
That the good the bad is how I will grow
I like how you get when I get out of line <start> Ain't it just a rip off oi oi oi
Ain't it just a rip off oi oi oi
Ain't it just a rip off oi oi oi
What a fucking rip off oi oi oi
Another threatening glance another macho stance
Another aggressive fist another arsehole pissed
Another vicious threat a stream of blood stained sweat
Another bottle waved in the air another battle with tension and fear.
Ain't it just a rip off oi oi oi
Ain't it just a rip off oi oi oi
Ain't it just a rip off oi oi oi
What a fucking rip off oi oi oi
Tell me why do you glorify violence Ain't there nothing better to give
Why fuck up the only chance to be yourself and really live
You tell me you're a working class loser well what the fuck does that mean
Is the weekly fight at the boozer gonna be the only action you've seen
Are you gonna be one of the big boys well we've seen it all before
Muscles all akimbo as they boot down another door.
Will you see yourself as the hero as you boot in another head
When you're just a pathetic victim of the media you've been fed.
You're lost in your own self pity you've bought the system's lie
They box us up and sit pretty as we struggle with the knots they tie.
Okay so you're right about one thing noone's got the right to shit on you
But what's the point of shitting on yourself what's that gonna do
Working class hero beats up middle class twit
Media labels system's shit.
When it looks like the people could score a win
The system makes sure that the boot goes in.
Yeah it's the greatest working class rip off oi oi oi
Just another fucking rip off a fucking media ploy
It's the greatest working class rip off oi oi oi
Ain't it just a rip off ain't it just a rip off ain't it just a rip off oi
Punk attacked the barriers of colour class and creed
But look at how it is right now do you really think you're freed
Punk once stood for freedom not violence greed and hate
Punk's got nothing to do with what you're trying to create.
Anarchy violence chaos You mindless fucking jerks
Can't you see you're talking about the way the system works
Throughout our bloody history force has been the game
The message that you offer is just the fucking same.
You're puppets to the system with your mindless violent stance
That's right you fuckers sneer at us cos we say Give peace a chance
Punk is dead you wankers cos you killed it through and through
In your violent world of chaos what you gonna do
Is Top of the Pops the way in which you show how much you care
You take off now to the U.S.A. and spread your message there
Well mouth and trousers sonny boy never changed a thing
The only thing that'll ever change will be the song you sing
Cos when you've bought your Rolls Royce car and your luxury penthouse flat
You'll be looking down your nose and saying Punk dear chap what's that
You'll be the working class hero with your middle class dream
And the world will be the same as the world has always been.
Punk's the people's music so you can stuff your ideas of class
That's just the way the system keep you sitting on your arse.
Class class class that's all you fucking hear
Middle class working class I don't fucking care.
It's the greatest working class rip off oi oi oi
What a fucking rip off oi oi oi
It's the greatest human sell off oi oi oi
Ain't it just a rip off ain't it just a rip off ain't it just a rip off oi
Punk's the peoples music and I don't care where they're from
Black or white punk or skin there ain't no right or wrong
We're all just human beings some of us rotten some of us good.
You can stuff your false divisions cos together I know we could.
Beat the system beat its rule
Ain't got no class I ain't a fool
Beat the system beat its law
Ain't got no religion cos I know there's more
Beat the system beat its game
Ain't got no colour we're all the same
People people not colour class or creed
Don't destroy the people destroy their power and their greed. <start> oh now dear i was thinking

Here's to the beauty of the stars
Here's to the travelers on the open world
Here's to the dreamers in the bars
Here's to the teachers in the crowded rooms
Here's to the workers in the fields
Here's to the preachers of the sacred word
Here's to the drivers at the wheels
Here's to you my little love let the day begin
Here's to you my little love with blessings from above let the day begin
Here's to the winners of the human race
Here's to the losers in the game
Here's to the soldiers of the bitter world
Here's to the water that's their names
Here's to you my little love let the day begin
Here's to you my little love with blessings from above
Let the day begin day begin day start
Here's to the doctors and their healing work
Here's to the loved ones in the can
Here's to the strangers on the streets tonight
Here's to the lonely everywhere
Here's to the whistle from the mouths of bets
Here's to the lions and their kids
Here's to the struggles of the silent war
Here's to the clouding of age
Here's to you my little love let the day begin
Here's to you my little love let the day begin
Here's to you my little love let the day begin <start>  letters I have written but will never send
Here it is another end
And now we act like strangers like we never met
But I can't forget
You said you were on the other line that day
So I sat and waited for the callback that never came
Now where can I dispel the memories of your crime
Where can I release the burn of bitterness inside
There's an astroplane of rage somewhere in the sky tonight
I need to find it to unburden to try to set my head on right
My heart feels hard even as the memories fade
Soon I'll be able to smile at all the times you took away
They say that I'll get stronger form this
Dear god let them be right
But I still see you when I close my eyes at night
This is the last goodbye
That's what you want from me
This is the last goodbye
So that's what you get <start> Shining brightly in the night
You could make me blind
Morning after I couldn't find
Any of your signs
Now I got my feet back on the ground
Yesterday we were young
So young
So young
And we raised our heads up to the sun
But when the day is done
Even the sun goes down
If you only said your last goodbye
I admit I could have been untied
But I keep counting on your second coming
I'm still looking for a silver lining
And I'm waiting for the sky to brighten
And it's been so long
Since the sun has gone
Now I got my feet back on the ground
Finding myself still young
So young
So young
And the stars are so far
They fade from our sight
 only come out at night
 they have already died
Does your earthly body keep on breathing
Is your heart still warm or slowly freezing
Is your pulse still passionately beating
I keep counting on your second coming
I'm still looking for a silver lining
And I'm waiting for the sky to brighten
And it's been so long
Since the sun has gone
Fairy nightmare hurt my eyes
Burned into my mind
Dying quiet is the night
But you're out of sight
But you're out of sight
But you're out of sight
I keep counting on your second coming
I'm still looking for a silver lining
And I'm waiting for the sky to brighten
But it's been too long
Since I wrote this song <start> There's something you said
A whirlwind a voice
Together you said
But I have no choice
Oh please
Stay a while
God I love your smile
I never felt alone
But here feels like hell
When I am on my own
And you're all I feel
Oh please
Stay a while
God I love your smile
A rat in a cage
A stone in a stream
I float far away
I live in a dream
Oh please
Stay a while
God I love your smile
And how bout that thing
You do when you're awake
A laugh with a sting
A bite from a snake
Oh please
Stay a while
God I love your smile <start> 
Getting ready to rock
Getting ready to roll
I'm gonna turn up the heat
I'm gonna fire up the coal
I gotta keep that motor turning
I gotta keep that engine clean
I gotta keep those tires burning
I've got the best you've ever seen
And I'm a heatseeker charging up the sky
And I'm a heatseeker and I I don't need no life preserver
I don't need no one to hose me down
To hose me down
Getting ready to break
Getting ready to go
Get your shoes off and shake
Get your head down and blow
You gotta keep that woman firing
You gotta keep that serpent clean
You gotta make her sound the siren
You gotta hear that lady scream
Cause I'm a heatseeker burning up the town
And I'm a heatseeker I don't I don't need no life preserver
I don't need no one to hose me down
Don't hose me down

I want to see you get up
And see the whites of your eyes
And I'm a heatseeker heatseeker yeah
I'm gonna measure you up
I'm gonna try you for size
And I'm a heatseeker
Gotta keep that motor turning
You gotta keep that engine clean
You gotta keep those tires burning
I've got the best you've ever seen
And I'm a heatseeker and I don't need no life preserver
I don't need no one to hose me down woah
I'm a heatseeker
And I'm a heatseeker
Heatseeker
Out on the street feel the heat <start> I'm very fucking impatient
and real fucking insensitive you got that
 Alright then.
Tryin' to tell me I'm insensitive but I fall asleep
So you smack me in the head and then start to weep
When we make love I never let you come
I'm just happy to be getting some

You say I'm insensitive but it just don't phase me
I know you'll never find another to replace me 
So you wanna let me in on all your deepest thoughts
But I'd rather be on the couch with a beer watching football
You snuggle up to me and try to get into the game.
But I won't answer your questions or listen to a word you say.

Rock steady
Yeah I got something to say about that.
Girl I would like to talk to you. 
Beacause if you think that I'm the best you can do 
Then forget those dreams of true love because all that shit
That will never come true. 
But I'd like to thank you and I'm glad we can have this talk.

Now get the hell out of here and let me watch my football game.
And bring me some eggs when you come back up in this motherfuckin'...

Yeah Yeah Yeah  <start> My brother Jake hat shades head in a daze
My brother Jake have you thought about changin' your ways
He goes out he don't have no doubt
He don't have to know what the world's about
My brother Jake head down it's a scrapin' the ground
Jake stay away you know you can't always be down
He goes out he don't have no doubt
He don't have to know what the world's about
I said Jake now won't you wait
What's got into you
Your candle is burning the wheels are turning
What you gonna do
My brother Jake won't you start again try makin' some friends
Jake it's not too late to start again by making amends
He goes out he don't have no doubt
He don't have to know what the world's about
I said Jake now won't you wait
What's gone wrong with you
Your candle is burning the wheels are turning
What you gonna do
Hey I said Jake don't you wait
What's gone wrong with you
Your candle is burning the wheels of time are turning
What you gonna do Yeah
I said Jake Jake Jake won't you wait
What's got into you  oh
Your candle is burning the wheels of time are turning
What you gonna do
Listen I'm gonna break you Jake
Because you got what it takes
To give a whole lotta people some soul <start> He said I'd like to go back
But we can't go back
Man I'd take off tomorrow if I had any cash
The cigarettes got the best of us
There's not much left of us
And there's still a little bit
And we can split it up
I can walk by the park and see if anything is up
Sometimes lonely is easy. Sometimes together is too tough
There's not much left of us
The part that remains is rotten and bruised
The soft spot on a piece of fruit
We can cut off the black and eat at the rest
And that's probably what we're gonna do
And from what I understand
He's just some boy with a band
But when I walked by the park you were holding his hand
You dropped it like it was hot to the touch
There's not much left of us
And so you went with him. Down to Birmingham
Stayed in some fancy hotel on a credit card scam
Left in a limo. Came back on the bus
With not much left of us
The part that remains is rotten and bruised
The soft spot on the passion fruit
We can cut off the black and feast on the rest
There are nights I'm still in love with you
And the dreams they come. And they won't go away
I keep seeing the things that we don't want to say
Up on the sun and down to the bone
There's not much left of us
Because you went with him <start> Under the stairs and beyond your horizon
There lives a creature that wants to be free
Under your skin and beneath the dark water
There ascends a shining light secretly
Ah there is blood on the horizon
Ah and the flood comes in from the sea
Ah and a storm behind your eyes and
Ah there is no one left to see
Me
Stay where you are don't give way to your hunger
Shivering you stand there it makes you yearn
For what lies hidden a phantasmagoria
Follow the light and you'll never return
Ah there is blood on the horizon
Ah and the flood comes in from the sea
Ah and a storm behind your eyes and
Ah there is no one left to see
Me <start> I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby he's gone left this town
Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my giveaway
St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere nowhere
I got the St. Louis blues blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me <start> Hot streets down below me
All the people moving slowly
As they search each other's faces
For a trace of hope
Concealed beneath their laughter
And it's only love they're after
Mountains lie before me
Skies ahead are looking stormy
As the highway driver braces
For a race with time
To reach a destination
Of his own imagination
A child of the sky
A rider on the wind
I can fly
A prisoner of time
A dimensional crime
Lost am I
Winter stars above me
With a woman who can love me
And moonlight swept embraces
Fill my space with joy and peace
The sweet vibrations
Of a lover's celebration <start> Jerusalem

Intro. 
I came back to Jerusalem
Just to see if the light had changed
But it all seems about the same
My friends are here on a holy mission
A mass convergence of JudeoChristians
It's nice to put the faces with the names
Don't you know me by my ancient eyes
Sweet salvation what a lonely prize
I came back to Jerusalem
I came back to Jerusalem
And it's all coming down right now
Instrumental 
I ran into Magdalena
She said she's staying for the Y Cana
But I see the sadness in her eyes
We all lost the one we loved
He's up there livin' high above us
Fire and love gonna rain on down down down
Don't you know me by my well worn shoes
I walked this road beside the King of Jews
I came back to Jerusalem
I came back to Jerusalem
And it's all coming down right now
Instrumental 
But I've been waiting for two thousand years
That's a lot of blood
And a lot of tears
Instrumental 
Call me certified delusional
But I got stoned against this very wall
I came back to Jerusalem
I came back to Jerusalem
And it's all coming down right now
I came back to Jerusalem
I came back to Jerusalem
And it's all coming down right now
Ending  <start> I'm wrong
I'm wrong
I'm wrong
I don't know why i take it out on you
Could you dance in the black light of my glow
Could you dance in the white light of the snow
I'm wrong
I'm wrong
I'm wrong
My hair recedes from the horns
Could you dance in the black light of my glow
Could you dance in the white light of the snow
In other words it takes what it takes
Got wrong
Got wrong
Got wrong
My hair recedes from the horns
In other words it takes what it takes
In other words it takes what it takes
In other words it takes what it takes
To rely on another one
Its our last chance
To help each other <start> I just want to see what you have in mind.
Your name name upon my book I write.
I'm sorry I'm such a typical guy.
I cannot speak.
I have not tried to try to see
what it is inside
That keeps us playing the games these lies.
To try to se what it is inside.
But when I
When I speak yeah you'll have your answer.
When you speak yeah you'll have you answer. 
If there's a clause about where we stood last night
Before we hit the ground but you love that sight
Why can't i be there by your side
Cause your brother is that kind of guy
who stitches up when it don't feel right
so why do i even try
But when I
When I speak yeah you'll have your answer.
When you speak yeah you'll have you answer.  <start> There's a little flame inside us all
Some shine bright some shine small
The rains will come and the waters rise
But don't you ever lose your light
In this life you will know
Love and pain joy and sorrow
So when it hurts when times get hard
Don't forget whose child you are
Chorus
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine gonna let it shine
May you live each day with no regret
Make the most of every chance you get
Let your eyes get wide when you look at the stars
With the same sense of wonder as a child's heart
With the ones you love treasure the time
And for those who are gone keep their memories alive
Hold on to your dreams don't ever let go
There's a fire inside you burning with hope
Chorus
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine gonna let it shine
There will be days when you want to give up
When the clouds settle in
But after the rain comes the sun
Don't you ever forget
One day there will be no more pain
And we will finally see Jesus' face
So until then I'm gonna try
To brave the dark and let my little light shine
Chorus
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine gonna let it shine
There's a little light inside us all <start> There was one king this was his one sin
You never make a move 'til you've got something to prove.
Upon a cross strapped to a lathe
Young ingenue escapes unscathed
You read the part but you didn't get it
left Lancelot out of the picture credit.
If there's just one line that springs to mind today
Your bottomlit face hovering in outerspace.
Upon a cross strapped to a lathe
Young ingenue escapes unscathed
You read your part from your beergut heart
Then you fell to earth where you became a star.
Each time I see your face remains
Your beergutheart escapes unscathed
Left Lancelot out of a part
You married the monster but not the art.
You fell to earth but you wanted it back now.
You slipped at the tracks now the one with the cross
And it's all gone bad hasn't it
Now that you're dead. <start> I wake up in the mornin' just to work all through the day
That sun can get so hot that you can sweat your strength away
And ooohhhh come the night time
Gettin' hungry
Hungry for my kind o' woman
I'm gettin' hungry
Soon I gotta find me a woman
I'm gettin' hungry
Searchin' for a pretty girl
But I still get up in the mornin'
Though it's so hard all day long
If it weren't for the love of a woman
I don't think I'd continue on
And ooohhh come the night time
Gettin' hungry
Hungry for my kind o' woman
I'm gettin' hungry
Soon I gotta find me a woman
I'm gettin' hungry
Searchin' for a pretty girl
I'm gettin' hungry
Hungry for my kind of woman
Hungry
Hungry for my kind o' woman
I'm gettin' hungry
Soon I gotta find me a woman
I'm gettin' hungry
Searchin' for a pretty girl <start> I declare my destination
Straight to hell 'cause that's where I can find you baby
You're like the devil baby
You're hot hot hot
And I can tell by the way you wag your tail
Someplace where you can't feel your heartbreak
No empty feelings lonely nights when your libido aches
I'm a man womanbound
Put me on the train that's womanbound
Time to pack my bags I'm leaving on vacation
I got my ticket and I'm headed for my getaway
There's gotta be a better place for a bachelor
Temperatures rise when you strut wpride
Someplace where you can't feel your heartbreak
No empty feelings lonely nights when your libido aches
I swear to God I need  just to calm me down
Baby start me engine climb aboard because I'm womanbound
I'm a man womanbound
Put me on the train that's womanbound <start> In spite of all you been told about Elvis
The good die old and helpless
In bobble hats and armchair football scarves
For the big match with Antarctic thistle
They didn't catch the half time whistle
When they wheeled on the pop music stars
With their pop music guitars
And they were singing
One two three happy neighborhood
Do Re Me so far so good
Because life Mrs Brown
It's just one big knees up
A night on the town a storm in a teacup

Where are the songs about boozers and buildings
Banning the bomb and abusing the children
Who'll one day be pop music stars
With their pop music guitars
And they'll be singing
One two three happy neighborhood
Do Re Me so far so good <start> I live in a town called Millhaven
And it's small and it's mean and it's cold
But if you come around just as the sun goes down
You can watch the whole thing turn to gold
It's around about then that I used to go aroaming
Singing La la la la La la la lie
All God's children they all gotta die
My name is Loretta but I prefer Lottie
I'm closing in on my fifteenth year
And if you think that you've seen a pair of eyes more green
Then you sure didn't see them round here
My hair is yellow and I'm always acombing
La la la la La la la lie
Mama often told me we all gotta die
You must have heard about The Curse Of Millhaven
How last Christmas Bill Blake's little boy didn't come home
The found him next week in One Mile Creek
His head bashed in and his pockets full of stones
Well just imagine the wailing and moaning
La la la la La la la lie
Even little Billy Blake he had to die
Then Professor O'Rye from Millhaven High
Found nailed to his door his prizewinning terrier
The next day the old fool brought little Biko to school
And we all had to watch as he buried her
His eulogy to Biko had all the tears aflowing
La la la la La la la lie
Even God's little creatures they have to die
Our little town fell into a state of shock
A lot of people were saying things that made little sense
Then the next thing you know the head of Handyman Joe
Was found in the fountain of the Mayor's residence
Foul play can really get small town going
La la la la La la la lie
All God's children all have to die
Then in a cruel twist of fate old Mrs. Colgate
Was stabbed but the job was not complete
The last thing she said before the cops pronounced her dead
Was My killer is Loretta and she lives across the street
Twenty cops burst through my door without even phoning
La la la la La la la lie
The young ones the old ones they all gotta die
Yes it is I Lottie. The curse of Millhaven
I've struck horror in the heart of this town
Like my eyes ain't green and my hair ain't yellow
It's more like the other way around
I gotta pretty little mouth underneath all the foaming
La la la la La la la lie
Sooner or later we all gotta die
Since I was no bigger than a weevil they've been saying I was evil
That if bad was a boot then I'd fit it
That I'm a wicked young lady but I've been trying hard lately
O fuck it I'm a monster I admit it
It makes me so mad that my blood really starts agoing
La la la la La la la lie
Mama always told me that we all gotta die
Yeah I drowned the Blakey kid stabbed Mrs. Colgate I admit
Did the handyman with his circular saw in his garden shed
But I never crucified little Biko that was two junior high school psychos
Stinky Bohoon and his friend with the pumpkinsized head
I'll sing to the lot now that you got me going
La la la la La la la lie
All God's children we all gotta die
There were all of the others all our sisters and brothers
You assumed were accidents best forgotten
Recall the children who broke through the ice on Lake Tahoo
Everyone assumed the Warning signs had followed them to the bottom
Well they're underneath the house where I do quite a bit of stowing
La la la la La la la lie
Even twenty little children they had to die
And the fire of ' that razed the Bella Vista slum
There was the biggest shitfight this country's ever seen
Insurance companies ruined landlords getting sued
All cause of a wee little girl with a can of gasoline
Those flames really roared when the wind started blowing
La la la la La la la lie
Rich man poor man all got to die
Well I confessed to all these crimes and they put me on trial
I was laughing when they took me away
Off to the asylum in an old black Mariah
It ain't home but you know it's fucking better than jail
It ain't such a bad old place to have a home in
La la la la La la la lie
All God's children they all gotta die
Now I got shrinks that will not rest with their endless Rorschach tests
I keep telling them they're out to get me
They ask me if I feel remorse and I answer Why of course
There's so much more I could have done it they'd let me
So it's Rorschach and Prozac and everything is groovy
Singing La la la la La la la lie
All God's children have all gotta die
La la la la La la la lie
I'm happy as a lark now and everything is fine
Singing La la la la La la la lie
Yeah everything is groovy and everything is fine
Singing La la la la La la la lie
All God's children they all gotta die <start> and by the light of the desk lamp
i sat alone with my paper and crayons
trying to draw the things i saw in my head
and by the sound of the crickets
through windows of darkness
i tried to fit the moon in my mouth
in my mouth...
sometimes when i'm alone
and out of view of my own
i pretend i'm someone else
taking a look at myself
and i wonder what i'll think then
and i hope i'll be ok
and i finally reach the day
when everybody sings my song
when everybody sings my song
when i show you my soul
by the skin of my teeth
i got a break around seventeen
and suddenly everyones acting so differently to me
and by the bus i call my home
i've seen more miles then i'll ever know
trying to be some kind of rock and roll hero
rock and roll hero...
sometimes when i'm alone
and out of view of my own
i pretend i'm someone else
taking a look at myself
and i know i'm still thinking
and i know i feel ok
now that i've reached the day
and everybody's singing my song
and everybody's singing my song
and i show you my soul
and by the clock i live
thought i had so much more to give
it all came to an end somehow
but i made it the best i can
even became a family man
with nothing but gold records on my wall
on my wall
they're on my wall...
sometimes when i'm alone
and out of view of my own
i pretend i'm someone else
take a look back at myself
and i wonder what i was thinking
and i although it turned out
i will always miss the day
when everybody sang my song
when everybody sang my song
when i showed you my soul <start> Voglio odorare
il sapore celeste del ferro
voglio vedere
il profumo sanguigno del fuoco
esiste lo so
non tutti possono
tendendo le braccia
afferrare la sorte
schiaffeggiarle la faccia
renderla solida ed obbediente
renderla tenera incandescente
a ja Ljublju SSSR
a ja Ljublju SSSR
il fuoco di un cuore
che incendia la mente
pu fondere il gelo
del marmo bollente
onoro il braccio
che muove il telaio
onoro la forza
che muove l'acciaio
esiste lo so
a ja Ljublju SSSR
a ja Ljublju SSSR
 <start> The meadows ring I hear the flowers
And I kissed the dandelion so sour
Yo let's numb the pain away to this hour
Yo let's numb the pain away well its ours
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Your the lonely graves adorned with power
You now hid the silver in your tower
Yo let's numb the pain away to this hour
Yo let's numb the pain away well its ours
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh <start> I have to block out thoughts of you so I don't lose my head
They're crawling like a cockroach leaving babies in my bed
Dropping little reels of tape to remind me that I'm alone
Playing movies in my head that make a porno feel like home
There's a burning in my pride
A nervous bleeding in my brain
An ounce of peace is all I want for you
Will you never call again
And will you never say that you love me
Just to put it in my face
And will you never try to reach me
It is I that wanted space
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you
I'm sober now for three whole months
It's one accomplishment that you helped me with
The one thing that always tore us apart
Is the one thing I won't touch again
In a sick way I want to thank you
For holding my head up late at night
While I was busy waging wars on myself
You were trying to stop the fight
You never doubted my warped opinions
On things like suicidal hate
You made me compliment myself
When it was way too hard to take
So I'll drive so fucking far away
That I never cross your mind
And do whatever it takes in your heart
To leave me behind
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you
And with a sad heart I say bye to you and wave
Kicking shadows on the street
For every mistake that I had made
And like a baby boy
I never was a man
Until I saw your blue eyes crying
And I held your face in my hand
And then I fell down yelling
make it go away
Just make a smile come back
And shine just like it used to be
And then she whispered
How can you do this to me
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you
For you
For you
For you <start> Der Doktor sagtes ist okay

The electrical fire is taking up my oxygen
I move my mouth to say your name
But nothing ever came nothing for hours
Are you ready Are you ready Are you ready I am
Are you ready Are you ready Are you ready I am
This time it's all worth waiting for
We won't sleep tonight
This time it's all worth waiting for
I'll take you home
I believe tonight we burned out bright
I believe tonight we burned out bright
Tonight this town becomes our vice
Doused in white lights
Put on your shoes and find your best dress
This could be our finest hour the night is waiting for us
Are you ready Are you ready Are you ready I am
Are you ready Are you ready Are you ready I am
Tonight this town becomes our vice

Tonight is waiting for us

This time it's all worth waiting for
We won't sleep tonight
This time it's all worth waiting for
I'll take you home
I believe tonight we burned out bright
I believe tonight we burned out bright
Open your eyes look at the sky tonight
All dressed in white up with the satellites
Circling earth they will be watching us
Just for tonight can I have the last dance
This time it's all worth waiting for
We won't sleep tonight
This time it's all worth waiting for
I'll take you home
I believe tonight we burned out bright
I believe tonight we burned out bright <start> Never mind what they say if it happens to look your way
In fact I were you I would runna runna away
It usually comes around on those days that might seen grey
But if it catches up with you you'll have nothing left to say
Living his life in the corner
Mowing the lawn with a hammer
Looking confused by our banter
He didn't know what the hell he was supposed to say
Monster comes around and he really wants to play
Bubbling out of his mouth so you'd better walk away
You'd better watch your steps 'cause it'll trace 'em anyway
And if you happen to get away you've gone through another day
Follow the monster
Follow the monster
Follow the monster
Follow the monster
 <start> You got a feeling
That it keeps you up at night
I know that I'm leaving
Everything will be all right
And even when I'm miles away
You got me high like cocaine
We're moving faster than a freeway
And I can feel you in my veins
Baby take my pain away take my pain away
Hit me like a kick drum
Love me like I'm still young
We're older but we're still the same
Baby take my pain away take my pain away
So this ain't easy
Ill make it worth it if you see it through
Days when I'm speaking
Probably think I'm over you
And even when i'm miles away
You got me high like cocaine
Were moving faster than a freeway
And I can feel you in my veins
Baby take my pain away take my pain away
Hit me like a kick drum
Love me like I'm still young
We're older but we're still the same
Baby take my pain away
Take my pain away
Thinking about you
Even without you
Wishing and praying hoping that is saying
You got me high like cocaine
Were moving faster than a freeway
And I can feel you in my veins
Baby take my pain away take my pain away

I'm a do me you do you. You're all a bunch of haters.
Oh
Oh
I don't like the way that you talk to me
When you tell me how it's gonna be
And I don't like the way that you smile at me
When you tell me what is wrong with me
Sometimes I wish you would go away
Go away and never ever come back
I don't like the mean and vindictive things you do
It makes me want to hate on you
Yeah it's got me sad
I'm kinda stressed

You are such a hater
I don't like the way that you never take the blame
For absolutely anything
And I don't like the way that you put me through hell
For all those things you do yourself
Sometimes I wish I could disappear
Fade away into a happy new life
I don't like the way that you're always telling lies
You talk about me all the time
I hear you talk
You are such a bore
I see the way you look
I think you look like a witch

Hater <start> There is that I can only hear by the moon
I lay still enough to hear the trees grow
I listen for the creak of their thoughts
And I hear your corduroy legs running up the stairs
And all the kindest words are held in reserve
For you
And all my gentlest thoughts
A hand reaches to me
Across the banished sea
And holds me
Holds me holding you
It holds me
Holding you
There is that I can only hear by the moon
I lay still enough to hear the trees grow
I listen for the creak of their thoughts
And all the wisdom their age bestows
I hear your corduroy legs running up the stairs
All the kindest words reserved
For you
All my gentlest thoughts
Are yours
A hand reaches out to me
Across the vanished sea
And holds me
Holding you
Holding me
Holds me
Holding you <start> Who am I to say you're wrong
For feeling what you feel
There's something in the way you talk
Like you've forgotten what is real
You don't have to prove you're strong
To face it on your own
Cause it'll steal your breath
It'll wear you out
It'll throw you to the ground.
There is a lighter day
Hold on hold on
It's closer than you let yourself believe
Whoaoh
When life cuts you like a blade
It's gone so wrong
You can't remember who youre supposed to be
Hold on hold on
To me
You can tell me anything
Your deepest darkest fears
I ain't gonna judge you baby
That's not why I'm here
You can lay your burden down
You can lay it down on me
And I'll take it all
I'll lift you up
I'll pass you to the sun
There is a lighter day
Hold on hold on
It's closer than you let yourself believe
Whoaoh
When life cuts you like a blade
It's gone so wrong
You can't remember who youre supposed to be
Hold on hold on
To me
To everything you're certain of
All the love that's right in front of you
Trouble always has a door
That you can break through
There is a lighter day
Hold on hold on
It's closer than you let yourself believe
Whoaoh

You can't remember who you're supposed to be

There is someone that you can turn to
Hold on hold on
To me <start> and when i'm free

and i know this time i'm going it alone
down in the street

or give the time

somewhere out there anywhere but here
so let em know i'm never comin home again
i just started out
and when i'm free <start> Yeah oh yeah

I'm looking forward to that day
when all sorrow will passed away
all trouble will cease to be
then we will live together in peace
i know the day and time will come
the sky will open and reveal the Son
every tear will be wiped away
if you believe than let me hear you say

i will fly away someday i will fly away to be with him

 <start> The young stale memories
Of the play the role to your part
Librarian find me the pole
The one that kicks your head in
With my own time role your own innocence by
Grab on to my sleeve
The one that grabs at your ankle
Debate to understand that we all have a flaw
The fail to represent your life as you know it
God grant you one wish
To turn back the time...correct and create
Me and my star Matthew goodnight
You know by law when you'll be forgiven
Maria my star Matthew goodnight
You know my lord when you'll be forgiven
So they pulled your confidence down
With those verbal discrepancies
Now and then you'll gain what they've lost
Through a challenge of unpronounced
Pain is only a pulse if you stop feeling it
You might be able to use
The very thing that makes us up
Me and my star Matthew goodnight
You know by law when you'll be forgiven
Maria my star Matthew goodnight
You know my lord when you'll be forgiven <start> Well I'm just outta school

Gotta break it loose
Gonna keep 'em movin' wild
Gonna keep a swingin' baby
I'm a real wild child yeah
Well I'm a real wild one
An' I like a wild fun
In a world gone crazy
Everything seems hazy

Ooh yeah I'm a wild one
Gotta break it loose
Gonna keep 'em movin' wild
Gonna keep a swingin' baby

Well I'm just outta school

Long fall to the floor
Crying out dry as a bone
Take you somewhere
But it's too late it's too far
You're faking the part
Way down on Tennyson
They'll tell you it's true
You come down from your medicine
All battered and blue
Shout it out shatter your lung
Long fall to the floor
Crying out dry as a bone
Take you somewhere
But it's too late it's too far
You're faking the part
Way down on Tennyson
They'll tell you it's true
Come down from your medicine
All battered and blue
Shout it out shatter your lung
Long fall to the floor
Shout it out shatter your lung
Long fall to the floor
Shout it out shatter your lung
Long fall to the floor

Where we can go to get away
There's no rules and there's no laws
There's no fighting you can't go wrong
Chorus
'cause we're the next generation
Destroy your generation.
Help me up when I'm down and out
Hear me scream and hear me shout
Time to blow their generation away
Let 'em that we're here and we're here to stay
Chorus
my freedom's been takin' away
Don't wanna hear what I gotta say
Lock me up and throw away the key
Is my destiny. <start> We first met it was raining
In a house with bay windows
And all the fittings and fixtures
And a catalogue of injury
She's got a credo in underground movies
Her father is a lawyer
Who paid for the fittings and fixtures
And a house with bay windows
And I'm calling from a Baltimore hotel
Don't let it ring again
Your movies are your own
You're on a limb again
calling from a Baltimore hotel
Don't let it ring again
Your movies are all your own
Don't let him in again
Four weeks later in April
I took her to the doctors
Said I've no prescription
For compromised solution
And I'm calling from a Baltimore hotel
Don't let it ring again
Your movies are your own
You're on a limb again
calling from a Baltimore hotel
Don't let it ring again
Your movies are all your own
Don't let him in again
Ten years
Caught in a trap by my own cunning
Thought I was smart
Thought I was dying
For years
I lived in a flat without water running
Thought it was smart
Thought it was funny
I'm writing her memoirs
The underground press remain faithful
Ghost writing her memoirs
Maybe we'll get on cable <start> What did you see Can you believe it
All fallen heroes forever gone
The eternal lights died out in it's shadows
Brought back some memories when evil ruled the world
No fear the sun will never fade
One more pray to heaven
We're sailing in
In the burnin' sea
Into the storm
Into the storm
Follow the ship sail on the oceans
Dark stormy nights aimless victims of the sea
Life's on the edge fadin' lost and gone
Trying to break free but something's goin' wrong
Round and round in circles in a place of no return
The captain is in sorrow the sails started to burn
As we passed the border to a new and different world
The northern lights kept shining but the tale's left unhead
Far away far away <start> We could say it's just how it is
And how it always will be
And believe things will never change
As far as we can see
It's a disaster and it doesn't matter
Well I disagree
A ray of hope remains if we take the reins we'll arrive
Eventually
Keep all the lights on in the streets of Babylon
Then we'll just dig for some more
Pull back the curtain 'cause one things for certain
Action speaks louder than war
Look around there's no time left to stall
You've got to stand up
While you can don't miss the call
Hold on here we go
Where we stop nobody knows
Breath and count to five
Live while you're still alive
Right before your eyes
Your best laid plan up and dies
Cleverly disguised
The bounty materialized
Now we're moving fast we're picking up on speed
We got the energy
Creating fast as we tunnel deep
And no time to think
Here we just react
To the things we need
Hold on to your world
Look around there's no time left to stall
You've got to stand up
While you can don't miss the call
To live just in your mind
Is some kind of crime
Stuck in your station
In isolation
Never too late for beginning
To set your captive free
Tonight the moment has arrived
To live like we're still alive
Wake up and look around there's no time left to stall
You've got to stand up while you can don't miss the call
It's time to end the debate don't hesitate this time
C'mon on and take a stance don't miss your chance to stand up right <start> I have been sleeping with the horse's head
It has been urging me to stay in bed
Lie down with dogs now you'll wake up with fleas
It's either crowing or being part of the disease
RoosterMan
Wake 'em all up
RoosterMan
RoosterMan
Give it all up
RoosterMan
I've been counting every single threat
Know I will shoot them through their treasure chest
This dusty conscience pushing me to crow
This rusty whistle telling me to blow
RoosterMan
Wake 'em all up
RoosterMan
RoosterMan
Give it all up
RoosterMan <start> There's white slums down on Medford street
A fire hydrant on to beat the heat
A pit bull dog 'aint got no leash
On the corner where the kids all meet
A junkie in the doorway that knows what he needs
A bottle of booze and a bundle of weed
People look around but don't like what they see
A white trash ghetto but it's home to me
A broken window at the corner store
Boarded up tight with a lock on the door
A harbor view that resembles a sewer
Another day in the life of the poor
What are these people living their lives for
But a dirnk and a fix and nothing more
I'm jealousof the rich down to the core
Pissed on broke now hear me roar
The rich that live on the side of town
I head that way when I'm feelingdown
Feeling destructive burn it to the ground
Rip it to the floor kill it pound by pound
I'm proud of my life my work my toen
'Aint nobody gunna bring me down
I may not have a throne or crown
But I love that dirty water and the shit on the ground
I love that dirty water and there 'aint no gettin' out <start> If the trials up here
Are really getting you down
You had a close call
I didn't even see it in another one
I hardly believed it all
What the writers say
It means shit to me now
Plants and animals
Appear on the bend when its  degrees
The end of December whats going on
Now before
You and me
In the showing up here
Its going back to the south
Were hungry next that I know
And running a blender in a lightning storm
The disguise is a blessing i'm sure
And growing up here
There comes a fork in the road
Pants have got to go
We're on an island on the th of July
It looks like the tide is going home <start> I'm done telling you that I'm in love what I have will never be enough come on baby go live life on your own everything inside is breaking down and you don't want to be hanging around I don't think I want to leave myself alone I'm done having to apologize I'm done living inside your eyes when the lights go out what's left to know nothing ever makes sense to me a broken branch of the family tree kill the lights now baby watch me explode there is no revolution and I'm done doing things I don't want to do there is no restitution and I'm done living in this decline I'm done watching you redesign come on baby let's go walk out the door I'm done showing up to fucking work taking orders from a fucking bitch I'm in the chair now go ahead and flip the switch I'm done doing things I don't want to do and I'm sick and tired of setting up to be like you fucked up thrown out and overdue I'm done there is no revolution <start> Sinking farther than you've gone
Wanting more than all you got
It isn't as simple as it seems
Giving them everything they need
I'm playing the part
Digging the heroine
She's the one I want
What are you fighting for
Everything and more
I'm holding out my hands
Why are you keeping score
Battered and torn
I don't understand
Shouting out loud but no one hears
Whispers to screams to tears
Easing your way from bad to worse
Losing your place forgot the verse <start> Throw my ticket out the window
Throw my suitcase out there too
Throw my troubles out the door
I don't need them any more
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you
I should have left this town this morning
But it was more than I could do
Oh your love comes on so strong
And I've waited all day long
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you
Is it really any wonder
The love that a stranger might receive
You cast your spell and I went under
I find it so difficult to leave
I can hear that whistle blowin'
I see that stationmaster too
If there's a poor boy on the street
Then let him have my seat
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you <start> I was out the other day
And I saw you in your big black car
And I was waving as you were passing
'Cause I know who you are
You had this look that of an angel
It was such a bad disguise
Did you think for second
I would not realize
Tripping hard falling down onto the ground
'Cause I can't stand up and I can't fall down
'Cause I'm somewhere in the middle of this
I was out the other night
And I saw you so we had a fight
It was late and I was lonely
And its such a long way home
So I asked you if you'd join me
For a single last call drink
So you turned and bought us two
And you didn't even blink
You had this look that of an angel
It was such a bad disguise
When you drink it makes you angry
When I drink I want you more and more and more
Tripping hard falling down onto the ground
'Cause I can't stand up and I can't fall down
And I'm somewhere in the middle of this
Tripping hard falling down onto the ground
'Cause I can't stand up and I can't fall down
'Cause I'm somewhere in the middle of this
Somewhere in the middle
You know I find it hard
I always tried to find the sane life
Somewhere in the middle
'Cause I don't like the way things are
And I keep falling to my knees
Somewhere in the middle of this
'Cause it's somewhere in the middle of this
Tripping hard falling down onto the ground
'Cause I can't stand up and I can't fall down
'Cause I'm somewhere in the middle of this
No no 'cause I'm somewhere in the middle of this
Somewhere in the middle <start> Novaking

You work so hard nothing is getting through
They just got sick of you

Never released

tripped the snare with my rabbit foot
Jumped for joy only to be employed
by our worst fear
Lady Luck have you given up
Are you scared of my rabbit foot
Jumped for joy only to be employed
by our worst fear
Didn't it feel better
when we were being bigger
Didn't it feel stronger
when the love was honest
Didn't it feel kinder
when you were walking beside her
Lady Luck there is plenty of
love to spare and foolhardihood
It's a choice
to feel the heavens rejoice
It's a charm so make it your own <start> That night he pictured the removal of his hairy heart and to the
Accompaniment of very
Romantic music he watched it being shaved smooth by an anonymous
Stainless steel razor. <start> You said you loved me

When your well runs dry I like to know
Whatcha gonna do

Sat down and sighed
And I heard you packin'
But you said nothin'
I watched you pass me by
I know you're gonna miss me
And you're gonna be blue
Tell me tell me

So the fast dance won't last
Clap until you hands hurt
Standing ovations or boobooboos

Walk off into the sunset

Never means forever

Don't harm no harm <start> Ik heb koorts
Ik voel het niet
En ik sluip door de stad
Ik hoop dat niemand mij ziet
Regen slaat
Stuk op m'n hoofd
En het beukt en het gonst
De hele stad lijkt verdoofd
Refrein
Neonlicht gaat aan en uit en aan
Neonlicht gaat aan en uit en aan
Het beukt op m'n hoofd
Het vertelt waar ik ben
Het vertelt wat ik doe
Het gaat aan en uit en aan
Ik loop door
Alles is grauw
En ik snak naar wat licht
De boulevards zijn te nauw
Een flik kust een NoordAfrikaan
En een priester knielt neer
Begint zichzelf maar te slaan
Refrein
Ik heb koorts
Ik loop in draf
Mensen wonen en leven
Boven hun eigen graf
Een man loopt
Over glad ijs
En hij lacht en hij drinkt
Hij maakt zichzelf maar wat wijs
Refrein <start> You look like gold to me
And I'm not too blind to see
You look like gold
You make me wanna sing
With all the joy you bring
You look like gold
Like the rays down from the sun
When a new day has just begun
You look like gold
I've been fooled before
But now I know
I've made the mistake in the past
But now I know the difference
From gold and brass
Not the kind of gold you wear
But the kind that can feel my care
You look like gold
Some shine when the day is new
But fade when the day is through
But you look like gold
I've been wrong before
But now I know
I've made mistakes in the past
But now I know the difference
From gold and brass
You look like gold to me
And I'm down on bending knees
You look like gold
And I just want you to know
To me you mean so much more
Than all the gold
You look like gold <start> Old bitches get up

Heard you coming and he got his gun
Better go jackrabbit better start to run
Go jackrabbit running through the wood
You had a good night and you feel real loose
Gunfire breaking up the peaceful night
Jackrabbit lying in the cold daylight <start> From your time of infancy Christ was aknockin'.
You say it's in vain but I've got to tell you somethin'
When the bad things I'd done made me detestable
God proved His love because He saved me anyhow.
Flick the porchlights and go get the doorbell.
Knock knock Jesus there
He's lookin' for a place to dwell.
Make Him some dinner and invite Him to eat.
God'll come in your house if He's got the house key.
Someone kept prayin' I would change and I came around.
God was ready and he came to me first.
Hopefully you'll believe what you read.
It is in the book of Revelation there in chapter number three.
So save some space and a place in your heart.
Save another soul from burnin' in the Lake of Fire
Yo Got it
Someone's at the door.
Find out who's there baby.
Go light up your building.
Double doors locked shut.
Go and tell the Lord
I want you to save me
So why don't Ya fill me
Doors are shut even though you know He's right there.
Man don't refuse Him
Don't you know that that's dangerous
Cause one spot of evil is enough to call you bad.
What's on your soul is a lot more sin than that.
And the rerun shows that your door stayed closed up.
You said come back at a more convenient time.
He rung the bell but you kept on sinning.
Snuck around the back
He was bangin' on your kitchen screen.
Gotta get Christ and you can't delay.
Make it fast cause you need Him in your heart to be saved
And it's time to repeat the facts regarding our eternal life
Which you can now consider.
Someone's at the door.
Find out who's there baby.
Go light up your building.
Get face to face with Jesus.
Go and tell the Lord
I want you to save me
So why don't Ya fill me
That's right God is here.
Yo Bring Him in now
Jesus says
Behold I stand at the door and knock.
If anyone hears My voice and opens the door
I will come into him and dine with him
And he with Me.
I'd invite Him home for dinner.
Then you're gonna change I believe it.
Someone's at the door.
Find out who's there baby.
Go light up your building.
I can't believe it
Go and tell the Lord
I want you to save me
So why don't Ya fill me
Yeah
Someone's at the door.
Find out who's there baby.
Go light up your building.
Yo Open those doors baby.
Go and tell the Lord
I want you to save me
So why don't Ya fill me

And when the daylight dies
You'll still be there when I close my eyes
And I'll follow follow You
I walk into the midnight blue
You light a torch and it cuts right through
And I'll follow follow You
I see You on the boulevard like a movie star on the cover
And my heart beats like a drummer
Chorus
If I lose my way tonight
I know it's gonna be alright
'Cause I'll follow follow You
I'll follow You
If I ever fall behind
You'll be right there to show me a sign
I can follow follow You
If you go away that's where I'll be
A world without You is no place no place for me
I'm gonna follow You
When I think of You and the things You say
What You choose to keep and what You throw away
I hear Your voice and I won't be afraid
Chorus
They say that I'm a fool to put my trust in You
But don't you know my faith is all I have
I think of You and the things You say
What You choose to keep and what You throw away
I hear Your voice and I am not afraid
Repeat Chorus <start> I feel you break through the night like a flame in the dark
I feel my whole world shake as You awaken my heart
Only You can resurrect the part of me that's died
Only You can bring us back to life
Black I watched it all fade to black
Yeah this is where my heart was at
Broken and bleeding
Red every part of me was dead
No part of me innocent
I was desperately needing
Someone to follow
Someone to save my soul
I need a hero I need a hero
I feel You break through the night like a flame in the dark
I feel my whole world shake as You awaken my heart
Only You can resurrect the part of me that's died
Only You can bring us back to life
You showed up in the nick of time
I didn't think I'd survive
Now my heart is beating
You everything points to You
I could try to save myself but it's no use
Without You I'm sinking
I'm down to zero
With a Godshaped hole
I need a hero I need a hero
I feel You break through the night like a flame in the dark
I feel my whole world shake as You awaken my heart
Only You can resurrect the part of me that's died
Only You can bring us back to life
Revive me revive me
Bring us back to life

I feel You break through the night like a flame in the dark
I feel my whole world shake as You awaken my heart

Only You can bring us back to life

She's going to break your heart in two it's true
It's not hard to realize
Just look into her false colored eyes
She builds you up to just put you down what a clown
Chorus
'Cause everybody knows

The things she does to please

She's just a little tease

See the way she walks
Hear the way she talks
You're put down in her book
You're number  have a look
She's going to smile to make you frown what a clown
Little boy she's from the street
Before you start you're already beat
She's gonna play you for a fool yes it's true
Chorus <start> One two one two three four
You are so far away on this cold empty night
As I lie in a hotel room lookin' at a street light
Outside my window I listen to the rain
And the sounds of the passin' cars and the waves on English Bay
And I wonder if you think of me as I dream of you
Do you hear the song that I sing in this hotel room
'Cause I see you in the stars above and in every setting sun
And even though you're fifteen hundred miles away
I hear you howlin' at the moon oh
And I hold you in my mind and I start to float away
Yea the whole world seems very strange in a pleasant kinda way
And as the morning sun comes up and puts an end to this long night
More than anything I wish you were here <start> It's hard enough I know
To find the strength to go
Back to where it all began
It's hard to enough to gain
Any traction in the rain
You know it's hard for me to understand
Hard to find a way
To get through another city day
Without thinking about
Gettin' out
Now the strangest thing I've seen
Was a tshirt turning green
In envy of turtle dove
The dove's lady was the cause
Or maybe it was the olive branch she held in her claws
Or maybe he could see they were in love
You know it's hard for me to find a way
To get through another city day
Without thinking about
Gettin' out <start> Oh I'm sorry but it's time to move away
Though inside my heart I really want to stay
Believe the love we have is so sincere
You know the gift you have will always be
Chorus
You're the apple of my eye
You're the apple of my heart
But now the time has come to part
Oh I'm sorry but it's time to make a stand
Though we never meant to bite the lovin' hand
And now the time has come to walk alone
We were the children now we've overgrown
Chorus
Oh I'm sorry but it's time to move away
Though inside my heart I really want to stay
Believe the love we have is so sincere
You know the gift you have will always be
Chorus
Now the time has come to part
Now the time has come to part. <start> Do something for me boys
If I should die at sea boys
Write a little note boys
Set it off afloat saying
Bless you bless you all of you pretty girls
Village and city girls by the quayside
Bless you bless you all of you pretty girls
Watching and waiting by the sea
Bless you bless you all of you pretty girls
Quiet or witty girls by the quayside
Bless you bless you all of you pretty girls
Watching and waiting by the sea
I think about your pale arms waving
When I see the caps upon the green
And the rocking rollercoaster ocean
Think about you every night when I'm fathoms asleep
And in my dreams
We are rocking in a similar motion
I think about the salt sea rolling
Down in pearly tears upon your cheeks
Just like the day the harbor pulled away
I think about your warm white sheets unfolding
The more I have to drink
The more that I can think to say <start> Let It Go
You say to me
Dont know what you want
Ever since you said you cant
Trying to find a way to believe
I know that it is wrong
But I cant get along
When all you wanna do is leave
And I know that I will remember
And I hope that you understand
When I say that I cant come over
Though my mind will always be there
Now all of this has gone
And we have moved along
We see a different side to everything
And though we tried to go on
This battle cant be won
Tell me now what Ive gotta say <start> When the week is done and the evening sun
Is sinkin' back into the hills
Well the neon lights start flickerin' on
And the roadhouse starts to fill
You can bet your ass by ten o'clock
It'll be all that you can take
To squeeze inside with the girls and guys
Who come out to do the shake
Shake it 'til you can't shake it out no more
Do it 'til your feet come off the floor
Put a little shake in your rattle and roll
Shake it 'til you can't shake it out no more
The air is thick with the sweat and smoke
Comin' off everybody's skin
And the rhythm grows in people's bones
Like it's comin' from within
Don't come out here lookin' just to chill
Or to sit down and take a break
The only thing to try 'round here tonight
Is get up and do the shake
Shake it 'til you can't shake it out no more
Do it 'til your feet come off the floor
Put a little shake in your rattle and roll
Shake it 'til you can't shake it out no more
We're all the same when we come out here
Don't matter who your daddy is
What side of the street that you grew up on
Don't count for anything
Come down alone or with a friend in tow
Just get down here for god's sake
Bring folding money and a pack of smokes
And get down here and shake
Shake it out <start> Last nightSan Francisco
Tonight we're in LA
 Days untils I see you
Hearing your voice is not good enough
I wish I could be seeing you tonight
I'm thinking of the time
That I saw you last
Time has passed me by too fast
I think of yesterday
It seems so very far away
I wonder if you think of me
I wish you were here with me
So here we goc'mon let's go
Last nightNew York City
TonightPittsburg PA
 Days until I see you
Hearing your voice is not good enough
I wish I could be seeing you tonight
The days turn into weeks Weeks to a month
And you're still the one I'm thinking of
We're driving farther but we're getting closer everyday
Blut still we're having so much fun
It feels like it has just begun
So here we goc'mon let's go
Last night we're in Chicago
Tonight we're in Greenbay
 Days until I see you
Hearing your voice is not good enough
I wish I could be seeing you
Tonight you seem so far away
But I call you 'cause you say
You stop drop everything
When the phone begins to ring
How are you today
Is everything okay
Before you go there's one thing you should know
That there's no one that I'd rather go with to a
Punk Rock Show
Hearing your voice is not good enough
I wish I could be seeing you tonight <start> Walkin' along by the L.A. River
This river's such a joke and so am I
I don't know why I should believe her
I don't care what she says
I wanna die
I'd jump right in the drink
But there's no water
I'd jump right in and sink away from here
Poor river
Empty river
I'm feeling just like you
I'm feeling just like you
Walkin' along by the L.A. River
Stepping on broken glass kicking cans
She's tellin' me I don't even know her
I guess there's some things I won't understand
I'd love to float away like old Tom Sawyer
I'd love to run away and be Huck Finn
Poor river
Empty river
I'm feeling just like you
Walkin' along by the L.A. River
Reading graffiti and throwing stones
She's looking for someone to deliver
She doesn't give a damn if I'm alone
I'd dive right in and drown
But there's no water
My head may hit the ground
But still I'm here
Poor river
L.A. River
I'm feeling just like you
I'm feeling just like you <start> . Verse
They heard the call from the evil vault
And raised their swords in the air
Kings and Queens the evil dreams
Their hearts full of steel and despair
Bridge
Rain and thunder
The lightning strikes the earth
And a thousand warriors
They lived and died by the sword

On the run
Only the strong will survive
Get on down
Can't escape from the hideaway
On the run
Only the strong will survive
On the wings of no return
Will they ever learn

About to explode
All I need all I know
Beg you please no I won't let go
Moving on it's not the same
All messed up and it's that I blame
People talking like they don't even know where they're walking
Hurricane girl
About to explode
Pieces missing like they don't even know how to listen
Hurricane girl hurricane girl
About to explode <start> What's the ugliest part of your body
What's the ugliest part of your body
Some say your nose some say your toes
But I think it's your mind your mind your mind
I think it's your mind I think it's your mind <start> Thirty two teeth in a jawbone
Alabama cryin' for none
Before I have to hit him
I hope he's got the sense to run
Reason those poor girls love him
Promise them anything
Reason they believe him
He wears a big diamond ring
Alabama getaway
Alabama getaway
Only way to please me
Turn around and leave
And walk away
Majordomo Billy Bojangles
Sit down and have a drink with me
What's this about Alabama
Keeps comin' back to me
Heard your plea in the courthouse
Jury box began to rock and rise
Fortynine sister states all had
Alabama in their eyes
Alabama getaway
Alabama getaway
Only way to please me
Turn around and leave
And walk away
Why don't we just give Alabama
Rope enough to hang himself
Ain't no call to worry the jury
His kind takes care of itself
Twentythird Psalm Majordomo
Reserve me a table for three
In the Valley of the Shadow
Just you Alabama and me
Alabama getaway
Alabama getaway
Only way to please me
Turn around and leave
And walk away <start> Got a lotta heart ache
He's a fucking weasel
His issues make my mind ache
Want to make a deal
'Cause I love your little motions
You do with your pigtails
What a nice creation
Worth another night in jail
He's a player diarrhea giver
Tried to grow his hair out
When friends were listening to Slayer
I would like to find him Friday night
Hanging out with mom and trying on his fathers tights
Life just sucks I lost the one I'm giving up she found someone
There's plenty more girls are such a drag
So all you little ladies
Be sure to choose the right guys
You'll come back to me maybe
I'll shower you with lies
Got a lotta heart ache
He's a fucking weasel
Decisions make my mind ache
Want to make a deal
Ease away the problems and the pain
The girl chose the one guy who makes you want to kick and scream
All along you wish that she would stay
Fuck the guy who took and ran away
He's a player diarrhea giver
Tried to grow his hair out
When friends were listening to slayer
I would like to find him Friday night
Hanging out with mom and trying on his fathers tights
Life just sucks I lost the one I'm giving up she found someone
There's plenty more girls are such a drag
Fuck this place I lost the war
I hate you all your mom's a whore
Where's my dog
'Cause girls are such a drag <start> Staring at the carnage praying that the sun will never rise
Living another day in disguise
These feelings can't be right
Lend me your courage to stand up and fight on tonight
Stand up and fight
Now fighting rages on and on
To challenge me you must be strong
I'll walk your land but don't be long
Two million soldiers can't be wrong
Its no fun but I've been here before
I'm far from home and I'm fighting your war

Some are scared others killing for fun I shot a mother in front of her son

Fight for honor fight for your life
Pray to god that our side is right
You know we won but still we lose until I make it home to you
I see your mother filled with tears we grew up so fast where did those years go
Memories won't let you cry unless I don't return tonight
So many soldiers on the other side I take their live so they don't take mine

Nobody tells me all the reasons were here I am a weapon so there's nothing to fear

Fight for honor fight for your life
Pray to god that our side is right
You know we won but still we lose until I make it home to you
I see your mother filled with tears we grew up so fast where did those years go
Memories won't let you cry unless I don't return tonight
Staring at the carnage praying that the sun will never rise
Living another day in disguise
These feelings can't be right lend me your courage to stand up and fight
Watching the death toll rise wondering how I'm alive
Strangers blood on my hands shot all I can
There were no silent nights watching your brothers all die
To destroy all their plans with no thought of me 
No thought of me
Walk the city lonely
Memories that haunt are passing by
A murderer walks your street tonight
Forgive me for my crimes don't forget that I was so young
Fought so scared in the name of God and country <start> Have you ever prayed to the night sky
Under one of them cold street lights
Watched another stolen car drive by
lose your hope and say
This is where I'll die
But you try to say you know me.
But you try to say you're from my world.
Well have you ever gone to sleep to the sounds of the gunshots sirensviolence all alone
They wanna break me down. Hope I can hold my ground.
Your world is MTV. Spring breaks and ecstasy.
You'll get your hopes and you'll get your dreams.
Well that choice wasn't there for me.
My world remains unseen .
Poverty no family
Broken homes and broken dreams
I fall upon the thorns of life. I bleed.
They want to break me down. I won't back down.
They try to break me down. Hope I can hold my ground.
I ain't your kinda white. I ain't that kinda white.
Never be your kinda white I'll never be your kind 'cause you made me
outcast.
I ain't your kindawhite. I've never been your kinda white.
I ain't that kinda white 'cause I'm a lowlife outcast piece of white trash.

Five years on down the road. Two kids and a high paying job
picket fence and a college degree.
Well that choice wasn't there for me.
This path on which I walk. It ain't a game and it ain't all talk.
This is all I ever had.
This is all they ever let me have.
I ain't ever been nor will I ever be another blind eye in society.
I seen the way it was for the people like me.
I seen the way it was for the families so...
Have you ever prayed to the night sky
Under one of them cold street lights
Watched another stolen car drive by lost your hope and said
This is where I'll die
I ain't I your kinda white. I ain't that kinda white.
I'll never be your kinda white I'll never be your kind 'cause you made me
outcast.
I ain't your kinda white. I've never been your kinda white.
I ain't that kinda white 'cause I'm a lowlife outcast piece of white trash
If your offended by this song
Well I'm fucking offended about the way i had to grow up
So who's really been slighted

Have you ever prayed to the night sky
Under one of them cold street lights
Watched another stolen car drive by lost your hope and said
This is where I'll die
I never had enough money or enough privilege to be white
I'm white trash and society better learn to recognise the difference <start> Crazy little woman go down go down go down go down

It's pure and simple as the shepherd's song
Seraphic pipes along the way in Arcady
In Arcady
Never saw I such a scene
Such maids upon such a molten green
They employ their holiday with dance and game
And things I may never name
In Arcady
You said he was your teacher
Taught you so true and so wise
But now you know more than your teacher
I see nothing but cool selfregard in your eyes
In Arcady
So you see how twisted it becomes
See how quickly twisted it becomes
When the cat gut binds my ankles to your bedstead
That ain't love no that ain't love
Said he was your teacher
Taught you so true and so wise
Now you know more than your teacher
I see nothing but cool selfregard in your eyes <start> Dripping wet with practiced sincerity
Cute slogans for tangible mysteries
You reduce your god to a TV commercial

Buy what I sell you scream

Purchase my lifestyle
I once held the key
But now I have nothing
You are so naive
I'm sorry for leading you along
I'm just a man I'm just a man I'm just a man
Wake me up and wipe the clich from my eyes
It's killing me when all I see is hypocrisy and lies
I know that my faults bring me down it's a constant battle
Thats why I have to be honest with you now
I'm not your saint I'm not your savior
I once held the key
But now I have nothing
And you are so naive
I'm sorry for leading you along
I'm just a man I'm just a man I'm just a man <start> Take to the skies build us a new heaven
Of worthless lies from a new spokesperson
Anything for gold you'll do anything for gold
You'll do anything you're told
What happened to all the good love songs on the radio
Where do we go when the music's gone
And there's nothing to hold onto
Don't leave don't leave
Take to the streets with paper magazines
Songs still playing but your lips aren't moving
Anything for love you'll do anything for love
You'll do anyone for love
What happened to all the good love songs on the radio
Where do we go when the music's gone
And there's nothing to hold onto
And there's nothing to hold onto
And there's nothing to hold onto
Don't leave don't leave no <start> Lying here  waiting for the end
Release myself from life's punishment
Escape to the void I came from
Leaving behind a darkish disturbing world
PUNISHMENT  I never asked for life
PUNISHMENT  My will is free  my choice suicide
The final dormancy I adore dying is the name
Realize I'm weeping with laughter
As I found I always fathomed for
You shall obey  I will not
Searching for the true delight
The cannot rot one with eternity
Forever I will sleep
Martin Witchskinner  <start> Stayed in bed all mornin' just to pass the time.
There's somethin' wrong here there can be no denyin'.
One of us is changin' or maybe we've just stopped tryin'.
And it's too late baby now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it oh no no.
It used to be so easy livin' here with you.
You were light and breezy an' I knew just what to do.
Now you look so unhappy and I feel like a fool.
And it's too late baby now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it oh no no.
There'll be good times again for me and you
But we just can't stay together don't you feel it too
Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you.
And it's too late baby now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it. 
Somethin' inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it oh no no no no no no.
It's too late baby it's too late now darling
It's too late. <start> Follow that dream I gotta follow that dream
Keep amovin move along keep a moving
I've got to follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
I've got to follow that dream to find the love I need
When your heart gets restless time to move along
When your heart gets weary time to sing a song
But when a dream is calling you
There's just one thing that you can do
Well you gotta follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
You gotta follow that dream to find the love you need
Keep amovin' move along keep a moving
Got to find me someone whose heart is free
Someone to look for my dream with me
And when I find her I may find out
Just what my dreams are all about
I've got to follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
I've got to follow that dream to find the love I need
I've got to follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
I've got to follow that dream to find the love I need
Keep amovin' move along
Keep amovin' move along
Keep amovin move along <start> You ain't never been blue no no no
You ain't never been blue
Till you've had that mood indigo.
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh Go 'long blues.
I always get that mood indigo
Since my baby said goodbye.
And in the evenin' when the lights are low
I'm so lonely I could cry.
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be.
When I get that mood indigo
I could lay me down and die.
You ain't never been blue no no no
You ain't never been blue
Till you've had that mood indigo.
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh Go 'long blues. <start> You can tell a lot about a man
By the woman he loves
'Cause nothing else shows a part of his soul
Like she does
And she'd be the one to swear that he hung
The moon above
Yeah you can tell a lot about a man
By the woman he loves
She knows him inside out
The things he dreams about
And makes them come true when she can
She knows all of his faults
The demons he's fought
With nothin' but his hardworkin' hands
And he calls out her name
In passion and pain
She makes him stronger each time
Yeah it's there on her lips
And her fingertips
That she's with him to 'til end of the line
 you can tell a lot about a man
By the woman he loves 
'Cause nothing else shows a part of his soul
Like she does and she'd be the one to swear that he hung
The moon above
Yeah you can tell a lot about a man
By the woman he loves
You can tell a lot about a man
By the woman he loves
'Cause nothing else shows a part of his soul
Like she does
And she'd be the one to swear that he hung

Yeah you can tell a lot about a man
By the woman he loves
Yeah you can tell a lot about a man
By the woman he loves
He loves
He always loves <start> Do you know what it is about you and me
No one else is gonna blame the problems circling around you.
I don't know. I don't even want you around.

You move fast but you just move along the ground.
I better stay away from you.
I've got some cherries but I'll keep them to myself.

You're the ol' lady from the society pages
From a small town somewhere I used to be
You owned the paper and a bunch of other stuff
That didn't appeal to me
Ol' lady ol'lady
Ol' lady ol'lady
Ol' lady ol'lady
Ol' lady ol'lady
The hostpital plans 
You ran the paper 'n charity ball
Every day on the third or fourth page
There you was..you was quite the rage
Somehow you was all kinda cheap 'n wrong
Just like in a lotta small towns
Where folks like you
Hang around too long
And pass out jobs to yer relatives 'n such
So you all keeps a lot 'n nobody else
Ever gets too much...to speak of...
So what what can you say
So long as the trash gets picked up
So long as the trash gets locked up
Just so the trash don't stack up
Some day you won't be on page three
Or page four anymore
Ol' lady ol'lady
Ol' lady ol'lady

By the grace of God you had a son
He's the one and only one
He grew up and by and by
He came to be a beautiful guy <start> Ratted out in hades
Forced to return
To Rockville
With nothing but a rucksack
Hard lesson learned
Foul council of leeches
Want silence and bet 'em
Take rebute
And a dagger to the bites
Then suck out the venom
Oh Isabella
Your ship's run aground
Kneel at the sword
Scream at the clouds
Oh Isabella
There's smoke on the wind
Jaguar in fever
Have taken your men
Running on the tightrope
Woven by spider
While the canyon
Teeming with shoppers
Grows wider and wider
What demon's possessing
The clock and the compass
Surrender
Run headlong to the void
The reptile's among us
Oh Isabella
Your ship's run aground
Kneel at the sword
Scream at the clouds
Oh Isabella
There's smoke on the wind
Jaguar in fever
Have taken your men
Chained to the ox cart
With a chest full of arrows
The villages
Are burning with cedar
By bag and by barrow
Scrub brush from the wasteland
Snake in a tree
Remember
When they throw the torches in
Breathe breathe breathe
Oh Isabella
Your ship's run aground
Kneel at the sword
Scream at the clouds
Oh Isabella
There's smoke on the wind
Jaguar in fever
Have taken your men
Oh Isabella
Your ship's run aground
Kneel at the sword
Scream at the clouds
Oh Isabella
There's smoke on the wind
Jaguar in fever
Have taken your men <start> Yeah
Yeah we're gonna fight
We do it every night
Baby when you scratch
You know I'm gonna bite
You can make me die
I can make you cry
Opposites attract
That's the reason why
Chorus
No one else could make you feel like I do I do I do
No one ever gets as deep inside you as I do baby
Our love is a bed of nails
Love hurts good on a bed of nails
I'll lay you down and when all else fails
I'll drive you like a hammer on a bed of nails.
First we're gonna kiss
Then we're gonna say
Dirty little words
Only lovers say
Rocking through the night
Rolling on the floor
When they hear you screaming
They'll be breaking down the door
Chorus
Bed of nails
Bed of nails
I'll drive you like a hammer on a bed of nail
Ow ow ow ow ow
Gonna drive you like a hammer
Gonna put in my slammer
Oh yeah
Chorus
Our love is a bed of mail
Love hurts good on a bed of nails
I'll lay you down and when all else fails
I'll drive you like a hammer on a bed of nails
Our love is a bed of mail
Love hurts good on a bed of nails
I'll lay you down and when all else fails
I'll drive you like a hammer on a bed of nails <start> Six sets smoked on Saturdays
At Barnaby's on State
Countless California calls
We could not stand the wait
We played the pier on Venice beach
The crowd called out for more
Zappa and the Mothers next
We finished with a roar
Jimi was so kind to us
Had us on the tour
We got some education
Like we never got before
Around the world in twenty days
We played most every night
Jetlag girls strange languages
Everyone began to fight
Lowdown at the Caribou
All rumours aside
Was we could never get together
Not unless we tried
Summer with the Beach Boys
We got sand all in our shoes
Made some special music
Everybody sang the blues <start> Well I heard the story once before
And I know what the tears are for
That's a lie and I just can buy
You came for me so don't try
And I see another man in your eyes
Listen you're old enough to know you can live twice
Listen so I'm telling you just exactly what to do
Cause you can have from me some advice
Pay the price
And if on another time or place
Another day another face
I'm telling you babe it's all you know
That one of us should have to go
Listen I know you hate to see me cry
But I have to go and I tell you why
Without your love I can't go on
It's easy and it's wrong <start> What if everything was different
Never the same way twice
What would make a man go stiff rent
And disregard the price  yeah
Just think...
What if nothin' changed for the better
But never got no worse
Conversation beats a letter
A blessing beats a curse  yeah
What about the situation
In which it gets revealed
The secrets to negotiation
Of an emotional deal
Just think... <start> You try to look like you're busy
Your time's aerobics and weight lifting
The wardrobe's perfect but the acting's obscene
Unwind on rainy days applying fake tan cream
And you wear those clothes
'Cause you're a real wannabe
You're not indisposed
You're just a real wannabe
I've seen you roller blade lately
Drop names and disco till tomorrow
And you wear those clothes
'Cause you're a real wannabe
You're not indisposed
You're just a real wannabe <start> You said you'd never give in never pretend
That this is just a chapter for you
What do we do I feel like this is war on a hill
A Jack and a Jill trying to win a battle or two
What we never do is win
So now you hurry it up
It's coming at you fast as you can run
The silver of a tip of a bullet from a gun
Is gonna take you down
Take you down and finally kill this love
We don't get along anymore
Saw his name and number at her door
You just take the bed I'll take the floor
We don't get along anymore
And there's the look in your eye
Magnified a thousand times
I see the vessels of blood swelling above
The color that made me turn to red
When you turned your head
At the body we never saw you went for it all
I took you like I never gave you up
Not a breath could come between
The bodies lying on the car hood
I think it says a lot that I remember it all
Was it all just wasted love
We don't get along anymore
Saw his name and number by the door
You just take the bed I'll take the floor
We don't get along anymore
We don't get along anymore
Saw his name and number by the door
You just take the bed I'll take the floor
We don't get along anymore
We don't get along anymore
Saw his name and number by the door
You just take the bed I'll take the floor
We don't get along anymore <start> I woke up on the floor again
and I needed something to eat so I went down the street to Monty's Grill.
What'll it be Said Monty sporting a wry grin.
Just give me the usual Monty I said.
Monty just scratched his head and said what is that again
The usual was a Utah burger with cheese fries and a coke.
Monty knew that I had been coming there everyday for the last four years.
Then I began to realise the man behind the counter was the IMPOSTER <start> So long ago the days when we first met
Two years have passed so much has changed around us
In my life you are a ray of light
Tonight if I should die hold my heart within your eyes
I still recall your face from so long ago
Two voices spoke of hope from a distant place
And still this day your eyes flow like the sea
When you are lost I will be there waiting for you <start> I close my eyes and ignore all the signs
I'm walking 'round in circles
I've closed my ears and believed my own lies
And break the silence always
I make a lot of words big storm in the air
All around your hair it's blowing
Just leave it be and it will all blow away
The weather's always changing
You can go if you want to
I don't own you go be wild
Leave my hand it's wide open
So's the door evermore woo ooo oh yeah
It hurts me more to think I'll keep you in chains
Than if you were to leave me
I am what you are and I'm running too
All for the open prairie <start> Jack O'Rion was the finest fiddler ever fiddled on the string
He could drive young ladies wild with a tune his wires would sing
He could fiddle the fish out of salt water water from a marble stone
Or milk from out a maiden's breast though baby she had none
There he played in the castle hall and there he played them fast asleep
Except it was for the young countess who for love she stayed awake
So first he played her a slow air and then he played it brisk and gay
And oh dear love behind her glove this lady she did say <start> You came up on me like a landslide
Once in a while I get taken like that and I like it
I've got a Thunderbird parked right outside
Give me a minute to finish this thing and we'll light it
In all this heat it's a job keeping cool
And I could fry an egg on you
You came up on me like a landslide
Once in a while I get taken like that and I like it
You're gonna get what's coming
You been asking for it two days running
You're gonna get what's coming
You're gonna get what's coming to you
I hope that you're half as intrepid as you make out
Often or not but you never got what you asked for
Keep on pouring until you hear me shout
And turn up the sound if you want me to drive any faster
Caution went out when you walked in the room
If it never came back it would be too soon.
You're gonna get what's coming
You been askin' for it two days runnin'
You're gonna get what's comin'
You're gonna get what's coming to you
You came upon me like a landslide
Once in a while I get taken like that and I like it
You're gonna get what's comin'
You been askin' for it two days runnin'
You're gonna get what's comin'
You're gonna get what's comin' to you <start> I was cruisin' in my Stingray late one night
When an XKE pulled up on the right
He rolled down the window of his shiny new Jag
And challenged me then and there to a drag
I said You're on buddy  my mill's running fine
Let's come off the line now at Sunset and Vine
But I'll go you one better if you've got the nerve
Let's race all the way  to Dead Man's Curve
 is no place to play
 you'd best keep away
 I can hear 'em say
Won't come back from Dead Man's Curve
The street was deserted late Friday night
We were buggin' each other while we sat out the light
We both popped the clutch when the light turned green
You shoulda heard the whine from my screamin' machine
I flew past La Brea Schwab's and Crescent Heights
And all the Jag could see were my six taillights
He passed me at Doheny then I started to swerve
But I pulled her out and there we were  at Dead Man's Curve
 is no place to play

Well the last thing I remember Doc
I started to swerve
And then I saw the Jag slide into the curve
I know I'll never forget that horrible sight
I guess I found out for myself that everyone was right
Won't come back from Dead Man's Curve
 is no place to play
 you'd best keep away
 I can hear 'em say
Won't come back from Dead Man's Curve
 is no place to play
 you'd best keep away
 I can hear 'em say
Won't come back from Dead Man's Curve <start> Lovers keep on the road your on
Runners until the race is run
Soldiers you've got to soldier on
Sometimes even right is wrong
They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day were gonna get out
Tonight maybe we're gonna run
Dreamin' of the Osaka sun
Ohh ohh ohhh
Dreamin' of when the morning comes
They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day the sun will come out
Reign of love
I can't let go
To the sea I offer
This heavy load
Locusts will
Lift me up
I'm just a prisoner
In a reign of love
Locusts will
Let us stop
I wish I'd spoken
To the reign of love
Reign of love
By the church were waiting
Reign of love
My knees go praying
How I wish
I'd spoken up
Or we'd be carried
In the reign of love <start> 




 <start> With the old dogs
And the young dogs
Clap together
For a spring
You can best
Well I'll give it
They'll be running fast and free
Money's never wrong
There's a message in this ditty
There's a moral to this song
When the dogs
Get their bones
Remember they'll be howlin'
Money's never wrong <start> If I find my way through the darkest of days
Will I laugh about the things that kept me awake
But if my greatest fears
Paints itself so crystal clear
Will I run away will I hide
And if I don't come home tonight just know I tried my best to fight
Please don't think I planned to lose to the night
And crystal moon so dull and bright
My heavy soul can't stand the light
It burns me straight to the bones
My bones
In the desert sun
I watched my nerves come undone by one my strings they tangled into knots
And ever since that day
Deep in Santa Fe
I've learned to hate myself for giving everything away
And if I don't come home tonight just know I tried my best to fight
Please don't think I planned to lose to the night
And crystal moon so dull and bright
My heavy soul can't stand the light
It burns me straight to the bones
My bones <start> Look at the red red changes in the sky
Look at the separation in the borderline
But don't look at everything here inside 
And be afraid afraid to speak your mind
Took a moment before I lost myself in you then
Took a moment and I could not be found
Again and again and again and again
I see your face in everything
It took a moment before I lost myselfthe moment it could not be found
What's all the fascination with the Echelon
What's with the constant questions you have this time
What's with this circumstantial consequence 
Find oversight before this night will ever rise again
It's all you've got inside your head
Better get a belief instead
Took a moment before I lost myself in you then
Took a moment and I could not be found
Again and again and again and again
I see your face in everything
It took a moment before I lost myselfthe moment it could not be found
To find ourselves lost here
Within we need the reasons why
So we take this bridge with the others
That will thrive in the Great Divide
Look at the red red changes in the sky
Again and again and again and again
I see your face in everything
Again and again and again and again
I see your face in everything
Took a moment before I lost myself in you then
Took a moment and I could not be found
Again and again and again and again
I see your face in everything
It took a moment before I lost myselfthe moment it could not be found <start> ou turn the screws
You tear down the bridge
Flimsy as it is
It's business like.
You shake my hand
You break up the band
Flimsy as it is
It's open mike
punk rock
Red white and blue
You twist the knife
Then go home to kiss your wife
A bigger better slice
is what you'd like
You kick the sand
You get the upper hand
You sell it to Japan
It's natural
Punk rock
Red white and blue
You turn the screws
It's what you choose to do
You think that I
Must turn them too
You think that I
Must be so satisfied
I stay inside
I wonder why
And the cement mixer gets it all ready
One good turn at a time
Then pouring it slowly and steady
You're showing me where I can sign
What I can expect to find
But how you can you say you'll be happy
When you turn the screws
You turn the screws
It's what you choose to do
You think that I
Must turn them too
You think that I
Must be so satisfied
I stay inside
I wonder why <start> I don't like you
But I love you
Seems that I'm always
Thinking of you
Oh oh oh
You treat me badly
I love you madly
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me baby
I don't want you
But I need you
Don't want to kiss you
But I need you
Oh oh oh
You do me wrong now
My love is strong now
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me baby
I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me please hold me squeezehold me
Tied up. Tied up.
I want to leave you
Don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend another day here
Oh oh oh I want to split now
I just can quit now
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me baby
I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me hold me hold me hold me
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me <start> She said she liked to party
She sure looked good
She said let me show you
What I got under my hood
She slid on over
And she called me honey
She said before you get a kiss
You got to show me the money
Show me the money
Don't be talking no trash
Only thing better than money
Is a pile of that cold hard cash
Took my baby out on the town
The other night
Drinking champagne in the
Candlelight
I told the waiter
Bring another bottle for my honey
He said before we pop the cork
You got to show me the money
Show me the money
Don't be talking trash
Only thing better than money
Is a pile of that cold hard cash
On my way home
I stopped to catch the last call
I could hear the band jamming
The people was having a ball
The owner asked me
If I would sit in
I said I ain't no dummy
Show me the money
Show me
You know just what I mean
Don't be talking trash
If you want the real deal now
Show me that cold hard cash
Show me the money
Show me the money
Show me the money
Show me the money
The only thing better than money
Is a pile of that cold hard cash <start> I stole into the eyes of a boy singing the blues
Hair jet black he'd stars for shoes 
Smoked his cigarette 'cause his lips had touched it
And I found out soon
He sure knew how to use a hotel room
I could open my hands and let the rain come down
But you're just to close to dream I had
I'm scared I don't know why I do
But I miss you
He stood there restless waiting for me
Body hummed with colours I have never seen
So we keep on burning like two stars in the same constellation
Screaming through the air
With a look like the light leaving
He said 'I've known you for a thousand years'
I could open my hands and let the rain come down
But you're just to close to dream I have
I'm scared and I don't know why
I couldn't watch you go
I can't watch you go
You know it sounds strange and untrue
But I miss you
Girls on the streets shine ruby lips
Black straight hair from the tip to hip
Brown eyes blazed under blue eyelashes
Feel how you feel <start> As I got on a city bus and found a vacant seat
I thought I saw my future bride walking up the street
I shouted to the driver hey conductor you must slow down
I think I see her please let me off this bus
Nadine honey is that you
Oh Nadine
Honey is that you
Seems like every time I see you
Darling you got something else to do
I saw her from the corner when she turned and doubled back
And started walkin' toward a coffee colored Cadillac
I was pushin' through the crowd to get to where she's at
And I was campaign shouting like a southern diplomat
Nadine honey is that you
Oh Nadine
Honey where are you
Seems like every time I catch up with you
You are up to something new
Downtown searching for 'er looking all around
Saw her getting in a yellow cab heading up town
I caught a loaded taxi paid up everybody's tab
Flipped a twenty dollar bill told him 'catch that yellow cab
Nadine honey is that you
Oh Nadine
Honey is that you
Seems like every time I catch up with you
You are up to something new
She move around like a wave of summer breeze
Go driver go go catch 'er for me please
Moving through the traffic like a mounted cavalier
Leaning out the taxi window trying to make her hear
Nadine honey is that you
Oh Nadine
Honey is that you
Seems like every time I see you
Darling are up to something new <start> Oh my blueeyed boy built something to destroy
Is it getting high High oh you cheeky face
Shirt open to the waist now it's really getting cold
One more paranoia I don't want another
Oh yes I confess I don't want another
Yes you handsome man wicked boy you sycophant
Are you ready to feel Deep stress nothing new
Anxiety to use coming through the door
One more paranoia I don't want another
Oh yes I confess I don't want another
Ah ah
Taken many drugs popped so many pills
Gasp at my adventures marvel at my thrills
One more paranoia I don't want another
Oh yes I confess I don't want another
One more poison thought don't want another
Yes yes I confess I don't want another <start> Oh there's Johnny he's so sweet
He's booger sugar devils meat
Hard as boardwalk bubblegum
And smooth as 
But hey hey it's all right
I don't mind I won't fight
Hey hey it's all right
'Cause baby you can come
With me tonight
Oh there's Larry he's alright
He's a walkin' stick of lit dynamite
Always gets it wrong
His heart's as soft as chicken bone
But hey hey it's all right
I don't mind I won't fight
Hey hey it's all right
'Cause baby you can come
With me tonight
We can lose ourselves
Not find our way back home
Till the whole world feels
Just like a Saturday night
Without a care in the world
Not a net underneath us
Floatin' through the air
High as a kite
Hey hey my my
You're as pretty as the big blue sky
Hey hey it's alright
'Cause baby you can come
With me tonight
Oh and there's Barry he's okay
He might even find himself one of these days
With his diamonds and cocaine
And his Honey I won't ever do that again
But hey hey it's all right
I don't mind I won't fight
Hey hey it's all right
'Cause baby you can come
With me tonight <start> This road bubbles in the heat.
Choppin' rocks the only cracker that mine eyes can see.
These rails have run me out of town and shipped me down the line.
What once was mine is yours is now what's yours is mine.
And those eyes could stain glass with the glaze you try to pass.
The overalls are down but the sheep line up too fast.
Shots and bumps and drops and lines are old shifty friends of mine.
You can move your body  to the beat of the pigs while they
rip out your spine and shoot out your legs. You live for the rhythm but you live on your knees.
If we're really this stupid then we'll never succeed.
This morning in a drunken haze I think I talked to you.
I think we went to breakfast and then walked down to the zoo.
I said some things that I don't mean but don't remember now. It happens all the time these days.
The words just fall right out.
When this joke dies the party hats and streamers really start to fly.
Look up at the sky where the frogs rain down and the blood floods
the riverbed and seeps down into the ground. Our time is now. <start> i want out of here there's got to be
someplace for the dream in me
looking out at pacific sunsets
to austin sunsets
wish it could've been you
instead of her cold eyelids
that close and close
and never open here's to hopin'
give me one more chance to try and be
a little more unkind
hide those things that
you don't want me to know
is it true if you were here i'd ask you
don't you think the sky is really blue
not a cloud in sight well maybe  or 
too few to mention this music
stares at me so cold and sequential
keeping time with the perfect sounds
of my heart beating slow it down
twist it around and slam me
on my back in anxious waves
of idle time pass over me
and make me aware
is it true if you were here i'd ask you
the sky is blue.
if you were here i'd ask you
I suck your kisses down
I suck your kisses down
I suck your kisses down
it's true
the sky is blue
if you were here i'd ask you
 <start> It's hard
When a love goes wrong
Picking up the pieces to go on
Our dreams
Are scattered in the wind
I won't let it take me under
Even though you tried...and...
I wonder why
Things go the way they do
Why people lie and break a heart in two
I wonder why
Things go the way they do
It's strange
Strange the way I feel
Time is all I need to make me heal
You're gone
And now I'm all alone 
I'll reclaim the thunder
Dry the tears I've cried...still...
I wonder why
Things go the way they do
Why people lie and break a heart in two
I wonder why
Things go the way they do
Now I'm turning my back on confusion
I won't live in a world of illusion
Well the river stopped running through me
You didn't see what you did to me
I've got to try to find some kind of peace of mind
You're just a mystery to me
I'll reclaim the thunder
Dry the tears I've cried...still...
I wonder why
Things go the way they do
Why people lie and break a heart in two
I wonder why
Things go the way they do <start> We are the pushing pulling
We are breaking the distance
If there's still sometime in our thoughts
We walk away and back again
Under the night sky the twilight
We find ourselves
Here again
Breaking out of standstill
We are the drifters from the shore
We are colors in the landslide
We are the burdens off the floor
Pushing pulling
We are breaking the distance
Under the night sky twilight
We walk away and back again
breaking out of standstill
We are the drifters from the shore
We are colors in the landslide
We are the burdens off the floor. <start> Well nobody wants to burn in hell
But everybody's got a soul to sell
When I was young my mama gave me some advice
She said boy don't you know everybody's got a price
I make lots of money I make more money than you
I drive around in my limo that's what I was born to do
And I might like you better if we fought together
If its not to be noted I got somethin' better for ya
Naked pictures of your mother
Naked pictures of your mother
Naked pictures of your mother GO
I dropped the bomb on Japan
I was a hostage in Iran
I'm the ugly American
Now I'm a government man
A government man
I make lots of money I make more money than you
I drive around in my limo that's what I was born to do
And I might like you better if we fought together
If its not to be noted I got somethin' better for ya
Naked pictures of your mother
Naked pictures of your mother
Naked pictures of your mother GO <start> I've known for a long time the kind of girl you are
And a smile that covers teardrops the way your head yields to your heart
Of things you've kept inside that most girls couldn't bear
Well I've known you for a long time but I've just begun to care
Yes I've known of all the heartaches and I've known of all the pain
I've seen you when the sun shines and I've seen you when it rains
I've seen you make a look of love from just an icy stare
Well I've known you for a long time but I've just begun to care
I know I've been blind
To not have loved you all this time
To not have loved you all this time
But the image of you wasn't clear
I guess I've been standing too near
It's taken me a while but I have finally found
What you are to me and that's what really counts
And what you are to me is something we can share
Well I've known you for a long time but I've just begun to care
Yes I've known you for a long time but I've just begun to care <start> Jimmy rode a bike with a steering wheel
Said he didn't like the way the handle bars feel
Folks said Jimmy son what's the deal
And this is what Jimmy said
Ain't no more with the wonder why
I can't live like those other guys
So I dwell on the outside
And do what's right for me
Get on wit' your bad self
Get on wit' your bad self
Get on wit' your bad self Jimmy
One day Jimmy was hangin' 'round
And a man said Boy won't you come down
To a big tent meetin' outside town
Gonna be a big show
Jimmy thought about it for a short while
And his words came back with a big smile
Well if it ain't ordinary then it's my style
So I guess I'll have to go
Get on wit' your bad self
Get on wit' your bad self
Get on wit' your bad self Jimmy
From the time that he walked in that place
There was a burnin' in his soul
When he heard about Heaven and God's grace
That Jimmy was a holy rollin'
Some folks never quite figured out
Just what Jimmy was all about
Well he sure loved Jesus but they had doubts about
About what the bike with a steering wheel <start> Like the sound of tapping from a sinking ship
I never thought we'd come to this such a calm and silent scene
With the shots still ringing in my ears so clearly now
Hit the brakes and we spun out no one heard a thing no
I'm blessed if I know anything at all
If I know anything I know I've been blessed
How long could they lead you so far from the light
I never want to let them try
All this noise I'm nineteen I'm twentytwo
In between I'm blessed with you rubber necking past the scene
With the shots still ringing we get up your ghost and me
Leave behind our victory while they fight for it no
I'm blessed if I know anything at all
If I know anything I know I've been blessed
How long can they lead you so far from the light
I never could leave you your only goodbye I never want to let them ride <start> Went around the way for you
Did all the things you asked me to
I thought it was the perfect day
To see just open love to say
It doesn't mean a thing to me
It doesn't mean a thing to me
And it's about time you see
Things ain't like they used to be
I headed out to Lester Hill
But that just made me weaker still
She's got the kind of love I need
The kind that's never good on me
It doesn't mean a thing to me
It doesn't mean a thing to me
And it's about time you see
That things ain't like they used to be
Walked into the battle blind
It happens almost all the time
The yard is kinda overgrown
And all those happy times are gone
But it doesn't mean a thing to me
It doesn't mean a thing to me
And it's about time you see
That things ain't like they used to be
It doesn't mean a thing to me
It doesn't mean a thing to me
And it's about time you see
Things ain't like they used to be <start> Waking up as the sun goes down
Body all in pain
Straight out the door to the worst part of town
Shooting up in vain
Slips all his money to the man
Here we go again here we go again
Got bags of mercy in the palm of his hand
Shooting up in vain
And so he heads for the closest rooftop
And now he's free with the skyline behind
But it won't be long until his high will drop
And then you know what he'll try to find
Such a shame
Now he's back on that hunt for more
Body all in pain
Wanting to get back to where he was before
Shooting up in vain
So now he goes and sells his wedding ring
Here we go again here we go again
But now he's sold exactly everything
Shooting up in vain
And so he heads for the closest rooftop
And now he's free with the skyline behind
But it won't be long until his high will drop
And then you know what he'll try to find
Shooting up in vain
Down to bed as the sun goes up
Body all in pain
Now he swears he's going to stop
Shooting up in vain
He's Dr. Jekyll and he's Mr. Hyde
He's got to listen to that voice deep inside
He's got a oneway ticket on a derailed train
He's got a oneway ticket on a derailed train
Shooting up in vain
Got to stop shooting up in vain
He's got a oneway ticket on a derailed train
He's got a oneway ticket on a derailed train
Got to stop shooting up in vain
He's got a oneway ticket on a derailed train <start> This bellybutton dangle will probably just be one of those things
I won't be showing off to often at sixty five
This butterfly tattoo might be something I tell my kids not to do
Spring break shouldn't last the rest of your life
There were things I should not have done
Then again well I sure had fun
Being free being wild being bulletproof
Back then we were rebels without a clue
Nothing in the world that we wouldn't do
Whoa oh oh oh oh
Didn't give a damn what people say
We were doing it doing it our way
I wish that we could always stay
Nineteen and crazy
I fall in love with those guys that keep my dad awake at night
Running his knife across a red stone
Maybe he hates their long hair
The tattoos or the chains that they all wear
Mostly he hates your black Camero
We were young so in love and we still haven't grown up
Being free being wild being bulletproof
Back then we were rebels without a clue
Nothing in the world that we wouldn't do
Whoa oh oh oh oh
Didn't give a damn what people say
We were doing it doing it our way
I wish that we could always stay
Nineteen and crazy
Oh the only things that I regret are the things that we didn't do
Those crazy days  that I have left  have led me here to you oh
Being free being wild being bulletproof
Right now we're rebels without a clue
Nothing in the world that we can't do
Whoa oh oh oh oh
Don't give a damn what people say
'Cause we're doing it doing it our way
I know that we will always stay
Nineteen and crazy
Promise me that we will always stay
Nineteen and crazy <start> no one said this would be easy easy
and no one said that you weren't right right
you always stop to think about the way things were
but what's good is gone
and now's your time to try and run away
the last time you ran away
you said you'd be back again
it's the last time you'd run away
you're never going back to him no
you lose yourself into your mirror it's clearer
you use your make up to cover up your life
you always stop to think about the way things were
but what's good is gone
and now's your time to try and run away
last time you ran away
you said you'd be back again
it's the last time you'd run away
you're never going back to him no
'cause the pressure's got you
and you can't fight fight no more
'cause the pressure's got you
and you can't fight fight
it's the last time the last time
the last time you ran away
you said you'd be back again
the last time you'd run away
you're never going back to him no
the last time you ran away
you said you'd be back again
the last time you'd run away
you're never going back to him no <start> I'm calling all bars tonight.

The grass is green
The oranges the palm trees sway
There's never been such a day
In Beverly Hills LA
But it's December the twentyfourth
And I'm longing to be up north
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white <start> No don't mock me
Don't you look at me pity me feel for me
It's okay

Don't sit there and tell me

don't sit there and judge me..you don't wanna face yourself
don't lie to me
don't sit there and test me I don't have the patience now

All the times I've seen your face

I don't want this..I don't need this
I will never go away
I leave this all to you to live inside you till you die
No don't mock me

But reach out from the distance
For the love we need
For the warmth we seek
We all share the same hope
That one day we'll find the right one
Who is worth our trust
Whose heart beats just for us but...
What if that was here all the time only we never noticed
What if that was here but we've been to blind to see it
What if that was here only we did never reach out for it
What if we already had the best there was to come
Plans that we made
All vanished into nowhere
We carried too much load
Down a winding road
Fragile we are
Sometimes we all need someone
Need a heart that feels
Need a hand that heals us
What if that was here all the time only we never noticed
What if that was here but we've been to blind to see it
What if that was here only we did never reach out for it
What if we already had the best there was to come
I hope it wasn't here
Let's hope it was not here
What if that was here all the time only we never noticed
What if that was here but we've been to blind to see it
Let's hope it was not here only we did never reach out for it
Hope ahead of us is still the best there is to come...
So may you find luck
May you become as happy as can be
May the sun shine on whichever way you'll choose to take
May you feel allright
May you have all that you have been dreaming of
And may your smile come from your heart and be no fake
May you find love
May someone give you all I just could not give
And may he still love you when you are old and gray
So take good care of yourself
And I hope you know I really mean it when I say
Of all those years we shared I don't regret a day <start> She put an eviction note on the door frame of her heart
What seems to melt together just seems to shatter apart
So watch your feelings 'cause these pieces can get very sharp
You have this talent for shooting down a shooting star
And the truth of a smartass is that I'm not very smart
It's gonna be a long night
Tonight
All the planets are aligned
And that sounded just right
I wanna state for the record I didn't mean to ruin her
I didn't mean to wreck her
It's gonna be a long night
Tonight
I took a vacation from all the things I should become
'Cause drivin' the nine to five never seemed like very much fun
Look in the mirror are you recognizing anyone
You're overrated and you're weathered but you just begun
I gotta got hands all over this 'cause I could never stop at one
It's gonna be a long night
Tonight
All the stars are aligned
And the moon is just right
I wanna state for the record I didn't mean to ruin her
I didn't mean to wreck her
It's gonna be a long night
Tonight
And my knees are bruised
From beggin' you 
I'm beggin you 
And if you need the news
Stand in line 
'Cause we're all over
No
Are you sure you said yes just for the hell of it
You've got one lie
What've you got to show for it
I am a sleepwalker stuck inside a daydream
I am just a soundwave
It's gonna be a long night
Tonight
We've got our hands in the air
And the room's just right
I wanna state for the record I didn't mean to ruin her
I didn't mean to wreck her
I had to be the song she couldn't shake from her head
It's gonna be a long night
Tonight <start> I'm so bored of education
I'm so bored of you
It's such a frustration situation
And I don't know what to do
I really wish they'd let me be
To work things out my way
America's been good to me
But I laugh when people say
All the kids salute the flag
Uncle Sam wants you
Come on boys let's hear it for the
Red white and blue
I'm so bored of television
TV dinner on a TV tray
Join the Pepsi generation
That's the American way
Fight for your country
Fight for survival
Fight for the fear of war
Sometimes I wonder who makes the rules
And I wonder who they're making them for
All the kids salute the flag
Uncle Sam wants you
Come on boys let's hear it for the
Red white and blue <start> Joke me something awful just like kisses on the necks of best friends
We're the kids who feel like dead ends
And I want to be known for my hits not just my misses
I took a shot and didn't even come close
At trust and love and hope
And the poets are just kids who didn't make it
And never had it at all
And the record won't stop skipping
And the lies just won't stop slipping
And besides my reputation's on the line
We can fake it for the airwaves
Force our smiles baby half dead
From comparing myself to everyone else around me
Please put the doctor on the phone 'cause I'm not making any sense
Blame everyone but me for this mess
And my back has been breaking from this heavy heart
We never seemed so far
I'm hopelessly hopeful you're just hopeless enough
But we never had it at all
And the record won't stop skipping
And the lies just won't stop slipping
And besides my reputation's on the line
We can fake it for the airwaves
Force our smiles baby half dead
From comparing myself to everyone else around me
To everyone else around me
Everyone else around me
Everyone else around me <start> Now he's going for the grey ball
Into the top left pocket
A touch off the slightly darker grey ball
And he's snookered behind the grey ball
Oh he's going for the grey ball
Now that's a surprise
A kiss on the slightly lighter grey ball
Now just the grey ball to play
What a colorful game this is
What a colorful game this is
What a colorful game this is
What a colorful game this is
What a colorful game this is
What a colorful game this is <start> Where you off to with that head of yours
Is there somewhere you should be
Was it something that I said the time I held you down
And told you it's not you it's only me baby
Don't take what I don't need

Don't say what I don't mean

No way you'll silence me
You'll see
What you up to now your mirror's gone
Is there someone you should be
Did you think I was just fooling 'round with you
But honestly
But honestly
But honestly
Don't take what I don't need

Don't say what I don't mean

No way you'll silence me
No where to hide from me
You'll see
And tonight I thank the stars
As I count my lucky scars
For everything you've given me
And all the words I gave to you
Something borrowed something blue
If you want them back
I'll give it to you
Give it to you
Give it to you
Give it to you
Give it to you
Give it to you
Give it to you
I'll give it to you
I'll give it to you
Give it to you
Give it to you
I'll give it to you
I'll give it to you
Give it to you
Give it to you
I'll give it to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you <start> Flvio Venturini  Murilo Antunes
Para sempre para renascer
O fruto da paixo
Para aquele dia que chover
Em teu corao
Baila sobre as ondas do mar
O que se cantar
Paralisa a terra e o mar
O que se calar doce amor
Chuva em teu olhar
Uma cano para te namorar

Para sempre para relembrar
e tentar o melhor
Pararia o tempo pra te ver
Oh meu doce amor
Baila sobre as ondas do mar...
Oh doce amor
Luz do meu ser
Canta que eu quero ver
Raio de sol
Brao de mar
Tudo que acontecer
Oh doce amor
Olha no mar
Olha em meu olhar <start> Don't take me to space man
I've had a taste of true love
I don't care that this world's corrupted
I don't want to be abducted
Don't take me away spaceman
I wanna stay here on this wasteland
I don't care that this world's masonic
I've got true love keeping me on it
Don't take me to space man
I've had a taste of true love
I don't care if this world's crowded
I gotta get a hand to hold you
Don't take me away spaceman
I wanna stay here on this wasteland
I don't care that you've got your utopia
I gotta get a hand to hold you
I was pushing me air on this one way drive
sinking going down man I'm happy just to be alive
I was pushing me air on this one way drive
sinking going down man I'm happy just to be alive
So don't take me to space man
I've had a taste of true love
I don't care that this world's corrupted
I don't want to be abducted
Don't take me away spaceman
I wanna stay on this wasteland

spaceman <start> I killed you on a tuesday
Your head was raw and bloody
Killed my baby in a car crash
We went out to a drive in
Going home your head was smashed in
Killed my baby in a car crash
Glad to know i'm all alone
Glad to know you're not going home
My car wrapped round a steal fence
Thank god i bought insurance
Killed my baby in a car crash
Your back was full of glass shards
Your lifeless corpse flew ten yards
Killed my baby in a car crash
Glad to know you paid your fee
Glad to know you're over me
Take two pills before you try and go to sleep
You won't have these problems left tommorrow
And if you think you're stupid then i'll take you to my room
We've got many brains there you can borrow
If you tell me that i'm wrong
I'll admit that i am gone I am gone i am gone i'm already gone <start> I feel destruction running hard through my veins
But I see redemption rushing my way
My victories are bittersweet and now I can tell
The only place my plans have lead me is right where I fell
I'm overboard too far from shore castaway trying to make it home
I catch my breath to save myself but I can't
In my sight You were just in time I feel You now You're by my side
And I know You gave me a gift of a second chance
I had a dream of a life of my own
And I had a place that I thought was my home
But now I see I just can't have it any other way
It's all or nothing do or die and I'm the price I pay because
I'm overboard too far from shore castaway trying to make it home
I catch my breath to save myself but I can't
In my sight You were just in time I feel You now You're by my side
And I know You gave me a gift of a second chance
A second chance
A second chance I won't forget a second life I won't regret
A second wind to brave this night a second more to make it right
A second chance I won't forget a second life I won't regret
A second wind to brave this night a second more to make it right
I'm overboard too far from shore castaway trying to make it home
I catch my breath to save myself but I can't
In my sight You were just in time I feel You now You're by my side
And I know You gave me a gift of a second chance
A gift of a second chance
I'm a castaway
With a gift of a second chance <start> On a Tuesday in December
When you walked out I remember
You were smiling as you turned 'round
In the hallway lingered in the doorway
Still the words you said to me
They make me think of how we used to be
Hand to my heart
I want to be the one who always learned
She says You're just like the sun
I get so burned when you are close to me
In the back room of a mansion
You are planning your deception
Always calling never phoning
I'm a victim of another's war
Still the words you said to me
Come ringing in your silent symphony
Hand to my heart
I want to be the one who always learned
She says You're just like the sun
I get so burned when you are close to me
And still it hurts so bad
I thought I'd get on over on you
And still I hope you're sad
Deserving more than anyone
I could give you one reason
You could be my winning season
All the things we could have been just fell away
Hand to my heart
I want to be the one who always learned
She says You're just like the sun
I get so burned when you are close to me <start> We refuse to be
What you wanted us to be
We are what we are
That's the way it's going to be if you don't know
You can't educate I
For no equal opportunity 
Talkin' 'bout my freedom
People freedom and liberty

We've been trodding on the winepress much too long yeah

From the very day we left the shores 
Of our Father's land 
We've been trampled on 
Oh now  Lord Lord <start> the things you've been through mean nothing to anyone
the days you've been through mean nothing to anyone
you've done so much in this little time youve had
i only know your name from reading it but i do wish i could have met you
and maybe i have but i can't picture you
and another day passes just another day
and it's so easy to forget what you lived for
you grew so much in the little space you've had
the days you've been through mean nothing to anyone
the things you've been through mean nothing to anyone <start> You say I done it wrong again
They say I left myself with nothing much to give
And they try and show me how to live
I must be good repent and forgive
But I've been asleep for weeks on end
 I've got the time I like to watch the cricket and
If they say I lead an empty life
My mouth is shut you won't get any information from me
Dwtai now
You will never ever force my hand
My head is always buried way down in the sand
You can say I lead an empty life
But I've never found it easy to decide
Dressed you up in uniform
Did they pick on you when you were weak and they were strong
Who told you that I'm not on form
My mouth is shut etc.
Dwtai now
No dwtai now
You can knock on my door
Keep ringing my bell if you're coming for jesus or coming to sell
I've got none of my money but I've got the knack
If I sit long enough it'll fall to my lap
I can never pay enough of my bills
I spend my money wll I enjoy the time it kills
I won't fix my life cos it ain't bust
You can come again  you won't see me for dust <start> Everybody got something to say and they're coming
On strong like a smooth operator
Everybody got something to say but I'll be moving along
And I'll see you all later
Logos is on the perch
I got some Heaven in my head
Chaos is just a quirk
I got some Heaven in my head
Pathos is a starting to hurt
I got some heaven in my head
Mythos is a gumming the works
I got some heaven in my head
I think I'm starting to lose it
I think I'm starting to lose it
I think I'm starting to lose it
Chaos is on the perch
I got some heaven in my head
Pathos is a starting to hurt
I got some heaven in my head
Mythos is a gumming up the works
I got some heaven in my head <start> It's the way that you look
At me when I'm steppin out
Wanna change who I am
But you won't let me be
So afraid
So alone
Creative and amused
With this life
It's not enough
It's not enough
The sun it runs straight into you
The sun it runs straight into you
These moments will not end
All the things we could have been
The sun it runs straight into you
The sun it runs straight in
It runs straight in
You missed your chance to find another way
You lost you're love just cause you hesitate
And now I wait for love to come again
You thought that you were all you believed in
The sun it runs straight into you
The sun it runs straight in
Straight in
Straight in
Straight in to you <start> Lookin' out a dirty old window
Down below the cars in the city go rushing by
I sit here alone and I wonder why
Friday night and everyone's movin'
I can feel the heat but it's soothing heading down
I search for the beat in this dirty town

It's done over and over again
We've just been losing a part
To be in another winning team
We turned the tables and times
Reject the failures for the pride
It's a replay or a change
Who knows when the new game starts
What have we done
What a deal
We're bound to fail
'Cause you failed before
We're bound to fail
'Cause you failed before
While you have been so wrong
We have to live by self defense
We are mistaken by you
There is no way we can win
We want to change it
Is it true
We're bound to fail
'Cause you failed before
We're bound to fail
'Cause you failed before
We want to change it
What have we done <start> ...oh
When I think back it's so unreal
Well did I just get murdered 
What's that mean cause I ask please god
Please tell me if it was a dream now

Do you know that i....continue all this one time before.

Stand

Go...oh.......too. <start> Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh I believe in yesterday
Suddenly I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me.
Oh yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong now I long for yesterday
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday
Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong now I long for yesterday
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday

The sound of heavy metal that tastes like cellophane
Collapsing every vein like umbrellas in heavy rain
My passion is pain
I do dirt to bury shame
I'm victimized an institution's no solution
A place where you're defenseless and guilt's the prosecution
Where necks are bound into slipknots of shallow souls
Walking narrow roads to be hung from gallows poles
Nobody knows me success has exposed me
To narrowminded souls with goals to overthrow me
Suppose that I chose to live my life lowkey
Would you act like you could teach
When there is nothing you can show me
Don't you understand I'm the head of the class
A straight A student not regretting the past
CHORUS
You see I'm okay now but I don't think it will last
Because reality is something I can't seem to grasp
Candycoated pain is like a ball and chain
Pulling me closer to death I feel closer to death now
Candycoated pain is like a ball and chain
We only dig deeper by running away
It's deeper than what it looks like
We never got an equal shot so we took mics
Packed the candycoated pain in the first pipe
That said my name and the candycoated pain is the worst type
You got it nice my every day is like your worst night
The world is digging in my wounds screaming out I bet it hurts right
But it hurts more I got regrets but
I'm glad I took the prize behind the first door
What's the hurt for
Everybody hungers peace but they thirst war
It's crazy I'm not complaining because I probably would have tried better
And if the people that I trusted weren't lie tellers
So keep your candycoated pain to make the vibe better
Now all the songs I'm writing sound like suicide letters
Chorus
Guilty or innocent whatever pick the verdict
Sometimes a perfect picture's not so perfect
Thought I could reverse the mixture it isn't worth it
Because my life seems to work no matter how bad curse it
I only know a little but I feel so much
The pain brings me down but it reveals the rush
See I got my arms up just to shield the dust
Because I lust for the things I can't seem to touch
Arrest me if I follow you
You congest me I'm so hollow from your gift
You infect me when I cut you
Still the same still insane
I think I love you

Chorus <start> Everything you own
in a suitcase by the door.
The words to keep you home are failing.
Everything we take out in anger
eventually will break down to answers
that are ringing in my head.
Slow down take a deep breath.
We can't give up tonight.
Is it right to sit and watch this die
We're slowly letting go like it's better left alone.
So erase the damages we've made.
The story left untold is better than you know.

Of all the nights we spent wrapped in blankets.
The mattress on the floor we're now home sacred.
You were my best friend.
Slow down take a deep breath.
We can't give up tonight.
Is it right to sit and watch this die
We're slowly letting go like it's better left alone.
So erase the damages we've made.
The story left untold is better than you know.
So much more to say. Suspended in the air
between the truth is right in place
spilling over everything.
Before you slip away before you slip away from me
Slow down...
Is it right to sit and watch this die
We're slowly letting go like it's better left alone.
So erase the damages we've made.
The story left untold is better than you know.
Is it right to sit and watch this die
We're slowly letting go like it's better left alone.
So erase the damages we've made.
The story left untold is better than you know <start> Eagle flies across a flag
Bureaucracy is such a drag
Behold a pale horse tonight
The men in black are out of sight
She comes
He comes
We come
She comes
Across the oceans in my mind
Across the skies I left behind
A land of opportunity
A land to fill my destiny
Emigrate x
I've been alone a long long time
So what I take what should be mine
I've searched the sea of empty eyes
And severed all my familiy ties
A mercenary feeds my soul
A plastic world no getting old
A monkey wears the ageold crown
The other monkeys getting down
She comes
He comes
We come
She comes
Welcome
Emigrate x
Walk through fear
Leave you dear
Never wanted to create a tear
Walk through fear
If you dare
Emigrate x <start> And when I look out my window
What do I see
The old grinder selling
Sawdust balls with a motheaten parrot
And he plays
Watch the children play on Paradise Passage Road
I see the best things aren't free
Despite everything
This old grinder still in love
With a shinyscaled mermaid
Quicktailed
Some... Some place between him and a myth
And he plays
What is forever
Are there things we can change
And the parrot
He says
I... I believe in the sun and the sky
Words that just don't seem to tell me why <start> If you had a day would you give me a moment
Would you allow our play to leave no bone unbroken
Let's love like seventeen
I'm in love with poisoning
Only bring your pretty frightful gifts to me
Lets love and kill like seventeen now
If I weren't so cold
We couldn't freeze this moment.
And as we won't grow old
We'll leave no heart unbroken
Let's love like seventeen
I'm in love with poisoning
Only bring your pretty frightful gifts to me
Lets love and kill like seventeen now
Tomorrow cannot be like this
And even though it's such a sin they will...
Tomorrow cannot be like this
Tomorrow they will take us in
We'll leave no heart unbroken
Let's love like seventeen
I'm in love with poisoning
Only bring your pretty frightful gifts to me
Lets love and kill like seventeen now
Let's love like seventeen
I'm in love with your new screams
Only bring those pretty frightful things to me
Let's love and kill like seventeen now
Let's run and kill like seventeen now
Lets love and kill like seventeen <start> The time has come
Come to make a choice
Forgotten by our governement
I thought it was my voice
As the truth starts to become apparent
You know it was lies
A politicians talent
Tats beer music our world wide bond
In a white collar world
They sing a different song
When you meet in the street
Remember walk proud
You made your country strong
The system let us down
Chorus
How many times listen to faces full of lies
How Many times going to stand alone not even try
It's only time before i hit you right between the eyes
Can't waste my time its my life until i die
The reward you get
For your aches and pains
Is a weekly insult
No chance for gains
For years you're stuck
Between dealers and homeless
The Man in the middle
Always doing his best
Are you still proud
Of who  what you are
You can bet your ass
The boss likes his new car
We go our way and they go theirs
Greed takes over
And who the fuck cares
The money makers in their pressed wool suits
I got sweat on my face
And dirt on my boots
When you're handing me my last paycheck
With a smile on your face
Cause your a lying prick
The companies going south
And are you going with it
The bank wants my house and everything in it
Seen it in others eyes
Like a failure left alone
You're a working class hero
From the day you were born <start> Nunca supe lo que el mundo puede pesar
Ayer todo y ahora otro pasaje ms
Nunca esperas que la china te pueda tocar
Hasta que llega y te deja en la ocuridad
No hay fuerza que pueda
Devolverme hoy la claridad
No hay canciones que llenen
El vaco de mi soledad
Siempre piensas que tu nia no te va a engaar
Pero ayer lo pudiste comprobar
De la mano y besando a ese chaval
Poco a poco te quedaste sin lugar <start> I don't know what I should do
I don't know how to get through
I'm so sad and lonley
so sad and lonley
my baby's gone away
I don't know what I should say
I don't know how to find a way
I'm so sad and lonley
my baby's gone away
I don't know how to be strong
I don't know how to get along
I'm so sad and lonley
so sad and lonley
my baby's gone away <start> Oh look at how she listens
She says nothing of what she thinks
She just goes stumbling through her memories
Staring out onto Grey Street
But she thinks hey
How did I come to this
I dreamed myself a million times around the world
But I can't get out of this place
Oh there's an emptiness inside her
And she'd do anything to fill it in
But all the colors mix together
To grey and it breaks her heart
Oh how she wishes it was different
She prays to God most every night
And though she swears he doesn't listen
There's still a hope in her he might
She says I pray
But all of my prayers fall on deaf ears
Am I supposed to take it on myself
To get out of this place
Oh there's a loneliness inside her
And she'd do anything to fill it in
And though it's red blood bleeding from her now
It feels like cold blue ice in her heart
When all the colors mix together
To grey and it breaks her heart
There's a stranger speaks outside her door
Says take what you can from your dreams
Make them as real as anything
Oh it'd take the work out of courage
But she says please
There's a crazy man that's creeping outside my door
I live on the corner of Grey Street
And the end of the world
Oh there's an emptiness inside her
And she'd do anything to fill it in
And though it's red blood bleeding from her now
It's more like cold blue ice in her heart
She feels like kicking out all the windows
And setting fire to this life
She could change everything about her
Using colors bold and bright
But all the colors mix together
To grey and it breaks her heart
Oh it breaks her heart
To grey <start> New in town Got it all ya' wanna buy a gram
Funny accent a Russian in Amsterdam
Looking for a job or need a place to stay
Go see Kashei...
What the hell I said how bad can it be
And checked the address the guy gave to me
The letters were smudged Dead knight district
A name for a derelict...
Zdrastvujtje My name is Ivan
Is this the right place I'm here to see a man
A Mr Kashchei I was invited in
To The House of Sin...
Then the world exploded the only thing I recall
Before I woke up tied to a concrete wall
Let me introduce myself and welcome to my club
I'm your local Beelzebub
What am I doing here
What in the name of a Hun
Powder all around me
Smoke that makes me dizzy
Unfamiliar devices
Women smiling tempting
Syringes injecting
Lies and pseudo paradises
Fake paradises...
While tied to the wall Ivan who was to naive to fathom the shit he was in made semiromantic moves  on one of the girls in Kashchei's harem. Ivan's innocent Irkutskian eyes made a monumental impression on the somewhat jaded girl and she rediscovered feelings she thought were dead and buried a long ago. Love was in the maruana air...
The evil Mr Kashchei and his sinister drug pushers whom he provisioned with free dope to keep them ignorant and dumb had settled back for a few Z's. Meanwhile Ivan was cut loose by his new found love and they decided it was time they leave. So did the other girls who were fed up spending time in the thick of things.
All of a sudden Kashchei opened his eyes and instantly aware of what was going down he unleashed his thunderous rage. No one fucks with Kashchei Nikto ne ebat so mnoj Especially not whores and cocksuckers named Ivan  he screamed furiously his appearance all the more frightening.
A few of the pushers vaguely percieved the tumult but were too stoned to ascertain the circumstances and retired contented to their state of inhaled bliss.
However one of the girls knew about Kashchei's Achilles' heel  that hard boiled Satanic sonofabitch sonofaHun was allergic. She managed to sneak out the back door in search of some kind of animal preferably a cat or a dog. In a streetcorner lay a Dutch shepherd with orange fur and a puzzled look that became more puzzled as the girl picked him up and dashed back to The House of Sin. The dog friendly by nature mistook Kashchei's shouting and waving for an invitation to play and leaped up on his chest causing an immediate hypersensitive reaction leaving the drug dealing pimp panting on the floor Delftblue in the face...
Ivan and the former  prostitues escaped and took the first available flight out of the country whose destination happened to be Portugal. The heroic dog was quickly named Lucifers  at the airport before checking into quarantine.
Ivan and company now live as suburban idiots and love it in a commune outside of Lisbon.
Mr Kashchei got arrested but avoided custody since drug dealing hardly ain't a crime in the Netherlands anymore. He later moved to Copenhagen and became a politician. His pusher dudes are still wandering about the streets of Amsterdam in their purple haze... <start> imagine to set one fire burn out the infection spread the ruin end the tyrrany
I saw you shut out the light tape the black fabric over your eyes
and this is the way you see there's a war going on insde me
let me go down...
your diseased hand touches my mouth
and the words and fingers rot and curl and wither
there's a hollowness that festers there let me go down...
I'm in the need to cut you to pieces.
twist the lids of your blinded vision.
I'm in the need to dismember the ruinous joints of you
I'm in the need for slaughter  I've got the taste of blood on my tongue...
picking at the skin offering no protection
I'm bared down to the wires
leave me this tarnished key to lock and silence
I need to be filled up with light
hope is sunken like my blackened eyes
I've lost this breath
withering solace
the ghost came to carry me home... <start> Lord I smoked  cigarettes
Waiting on your call but it ain't come yet
I'm waiting for your footsteps in my hall
And I'm watching for this ash to fall
And while I'm counting my regrets
I'm gonna smoke  cigarettes
You know how I'm feeling
My porch light is on and I've unlocked my door
My eyes are red and my throat is sore
I check my mail and watch my phone
And I wonder when you're coming home
And while I'm counting my regrets
I'm gonna smoke  cigarettes
Yes I smoked  cigarettes
Waiting for your call but it ain't come yet
I'm waiting on your footsteps in my hall
And I'm watching for this ash to fall
While I'm counting my regrets
I'm gonna smoke  cigarettes
You know right about that time
My friend who Mr Chilly call me up at this telephone
This what he said
How much longer can I watch my own TV
Now that I've seen how white my shirts can be
One more smoke I'll take just one more sip
Before I wipe your name right off my lips
While I'm counting my regrets
I'm gonna smoke  cigarettes
Lord I smoked  cigarettes
Waiting for your call but it ain't come yet
I'm still waiting on your footsteps in my hall
And I'm watching for this ash to fall
And while I'm counting my regrets
I'm gonna smoke  cigarettes
And while I'm counting my regrets
I'm gonna smoke  cigarettes
Before I see the rising sun
I believe I'll smoke  <start> It's a sunny day outside
Lovely sunny day outside
Happy butterfly outside
I'm locked up inside
I don't know if I can hear another tale
Of how amazing you can be
I don't know if I can hear another tale
Of how amazing you can be
Such a lovely day outside
Fairies waiting
Birds are flying in the sky
Office meeting
Perfect temperature outside
Let's go swimming
Freezing deep inside
I don't know if I can hear another tale
Of how amazing you can be
I don't think that I have really ever seen
Just how amazing you can be
I met some friends of mine
I used to call them friends
One of them was not so hairy
One of them was not so scary
I ran into a girl I knew before I was on TV
She stopped to get my number
'Cause she said that she was glad to see me <start> Tksi yksi j

I thought what he didn't know wouldn't hurt him anyway
But he found out and someone else gave him her hand to hold
And suddenly I find myself out in the cold
He trusted me all the time
I thought I could see another man and he would still be mine
Well yesterday I had a good thing worth more than gold
Today he's got a truer love and I'm out in the cold
I had a love warmer than fire
But I listened to my desire
Now yesterday's dreams are tomorrow's heart aches
I'm payin' for my mistakes
Now girl take a tip from one who knows
If you open up a new door you may find the old one's closed
So be true to your good man
Take a lesson from the story I have told
Or you just might geta left now out in the cold
You just might geta left now out in the cold <start> This is a cry out
To the ones in the gutter
To the sorry unfaithful
We lonely few
We band of others
We stand apart
In a trial by fire
We'll make it through
There is hope for us yet
We can die like the heroes before us
Or live to be the wicked ones
The wicked ones we're running from
Nobody's gonna believe
When you say you're turning the page
'Cause you never put up a real fight
So shut up and make it right
Shut up and make it right
Singing oh take cover take cover
Singing oh take cover take cover
Secrets don't make friends
We make love and love falls apart
Singing oh take cover
From our future hearts
Here comes the fall out
The trouble and clutter
The madness of millions
If we only knew
Surely there would be
Some kind of redemption
A trial by fire
To pull us through
Nobody's gonna believe
When you say you're turning the page
'Cause you never put up a real fight
So shut up and make it right
Shut up and make it right
Singing oh take cover take cover
Singing oh take cover take cover
Secrets don't make friends
We make love and love falls apart
Singing oh take cover

Secrets don't make friends

Ecstasy on their faces

Do do do... <start> Nos conocimos aqu
T me lanzaste hacia el centro de tu diana
De intenciones disfrazadas
Y ahora va vagando mi alma
De la noche a la maana
Fue como un beso de amor
La mordedura en el cuello me quemaba
La condena comenzaba
Por los siglos de los siglos
De la noche a la maana
Y no descanso de noche
Vuelvo a casa de maana
Y mis amigos preguntan
Pero nia qu te pasa
Nadie lo supo jams
Pero inyectaste el veneno del que ama
Y me hiciste tu esclava
Ahora va vagando mi alma <start> I looked to the North and I turned to the West
For a sign a light in the sky
Oh the message is clear that the time is near
For a leader to come again
A circle of stones on the head of a hill
Tonight is where it will be
In this desolate place we all stand and wait
For a leader to come again yes a leader will come again
For it is written that a leader will be here
And then a vision left me blinded by the light
And it started right in front of my eyes <start> Dear sirs
To whom this may concern
There's facts Id like to learn
So many things I wanna know
Especially trivial info paraphernalia badges and regalia
Please send me everything
'Cause I
Am interested in you
And every thing you do
I find myself at all your shows
Could you tell me where you buy your clothes
Could you sign my little sisters face
Put your signature any place and please send me a bio
'Cause we've got fan mail
We really really read it
Fan mail
We really really need it
I sent you my letter now I want a reply
You don't know any better than you won't take your time with my
Fan Mail
So I would like to know just if and when
You'll be in town again
So that I could meet with you
And brag at my friends at school
Have you been all around the world
Have you seen every kind of girl
Or are you from the other side
'Cause you
You can't believe everything that you read
With the hypocrysy and the greed
The papers all the things that they say
They don't tell me anything anyway
That's why I've gotta get it straight from you
Concerning your situation
Without an obligation
Break
My Fan mail
What's this I find to my surprise
Those fans that I idolized
No longer seem to exist
Now tell what can be the cause of this
Perhaps it could be their egos
I tell you heaven only knows
I didn't even get a newsletter
Fan Mail Send it out to me
Fan Mail Special delivery <start> Well what power of God does a nun use to hold up parish priests
And what makes a good cop let go a beautiful theif
Oh and how does the queen know she got hold that manna honey
Oh and what makes an old woman give a young man all her money
Well late in the night 'neath that pale moonlight the power comes over me
And it's all elouise yeah
I'm turning into elvis 
...kissed the babysitter. she screamed and I told her it was just the beast in me.
And on my way out of the house I shot out my tv
I went down to the corner luncheonette and said sally fried peanut butter and banana will do
I'm turning into elvis and there's nothing I can do
I threw out my wife and family I took off my wedding ring
I told my friends and neighbors to refer to me now as king
I put a chainlink fence around my ranch house and on the gate a sign that reads graceland ii
I'm turning into elvis and there's nothing I can do
I visited my mama's grave and I headed out to hollywood and I signed a picture with mgm
I play a rebellious beachboy racecar driver who fucks a nun in the end
In the last scene I whip out my big guitar and show her a little memphisstyle kungfu
I'm turning into elvis and there's nothing I can do
But I drove on straight to vegas and I stopped in the first old stripper bar.
Found me a little hooker that looked just like annmargaret and we rumba'd in my sports car.
Well me and my drinking buddies turned my lovin' home into a frikkin' zoo.
I'm turning into elvis and there's nothing I can do
Well he came to me last night in a dream looking just like he did in '.
He said son that guitar is a wonderful thing but it can be the living devils' friend.
On the other hand there's sexstarved women millions of dollars and anything you want to do.
I'm turning into elvis and there's nothing I can do <start> It's Courtney bitch.

No thesis existed for burning cities down at such a rampant rate
No graphics and no fucking PowerPoint presentation
So they just DIY'd that shit and built their own bombs
She's his suicide blond she's never in gold
Are you ready for another bad poem
One more off key anthem
Let your teeth sink in
Remember me as I was not as I am
And I said I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead
I kept wishing she had blonde ambition and she'd let it go to my head
Rat a tat tat
Rat a tat tat tat hey
If my love is a weapon
There's no second guessing when I say
Rat a tat tat
Rat a tat tat tat hey
If my heart is a grenade
You pull the pin and say
We're all fighting growing old
We're all fighting growing old
In the hopes
Of a few minutes more
To get on St. Peter's list
But you need to lower your standards
'Cause it's never
Getting any better than this
We are professional ashes of roses
This kerosene's live
You settled your score
This is where you come to beg unborn and unshaven
Killing fields of fire to a congress of ravens
This is what we do we nightmare you
I'm about to make the sweat roll backwards
And your heart beat in reverse
Our guts can't be reworked
As alone as a little white church in the middle of the desert
Getting burned
But I'll take your heart served up two ways
I sing a bitter song
I'm the lonelier version of you
I just don't know where I went wrong
Rat a tat tat
Rat a tat tat tat hey
If my love is a weapon
There's no second guessing when I say
Rat a tat tat
Rat a tat tat tat hey
If my heart is a grenade
You pull the pin and say
We're all fighting growing old
We're all fighting growing old
In the hopes
Of a few minutes more
To get on St. Peter's list
But you need to lower your standards
'Cause it's never
Getting any better than this

It's never
Getting any better than this

It's never
Getting any better than this

It's never
Getting any better than this

It's never
Getting any better than this
She's sick and she's wrong
She's young dirty blonde
And you sink inside her like a suicide bomb
He says I've seen bigger
She says I've lit better
And they throw the matches down into the glitter
Not a dry eye left in the house
Go boy go boy run for your life
Go boy go boy run for your life
Go boy go boy run for your life
We're all fighting growing old
We're all fighting growing old
In the hopes
Of a few minutes more
To get on St. Peter's list
But you need to lower your standards
'Cause it's never
Getting any better than this

It's never
Getting any better than this

It's never
Getting any better than this

It's never
Getting any better than this

It's never
Getting any better than this
Are you ready for another bad poem <start> Oh Louisiana I stayed away from you too long
Oh Louisiana how can a true love go so wrong 
She put me in shame and in sorrow and I come home tomorrow
Oh Louisiana
Oh Louisiana yea yea Creole baby Cajun queens
Quaint porches and windows filet de gumbo the Basin beans
Your beautiful Delta and bayous in greens
Oh Louisiana
Oh Louisiana yeaee yea I'm flyin' on Delta Nineothree
Right over St. Louis high over Memphis Tennessee
On southward to the sea where I long to be
Oh Louisiana
Oh o Louisiana yea yea them Yankee nights are cold and long
Oh Louisiana she broke my heart and wrecked my home
She shamed me in sorrow to face my tomorrow
Oh take me back oh Louisiana <start> The days seem the same
And you feel like you're losing your mind
I tasted the danger
And went south of heaven tonight
I didn't mind she wasn't into letting go
I didn't mind 'cause she still was nothing like you
How can you lose when it's waiting for you
You should come on when
It's there for the taking
Waiting for you
The days seem the same
And you feel like you're losing your mind
I tasted the danger
And went south of heaven tonight
I want to wake up in the morning
Feeling fine <start> Don't worry ''cause I always be there for you
I just needed you to comfort me
And I have tried to make it right
And I don't know that I feel so sure
But I think that we must stand
So I've sung this song for you
And I just want you to say to me
Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you
And the heavens above
Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you
And the heavens above
Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you 
And all I wanted was to stand alone
So is there a place that we could meet 
And you see this face within your face and I
Stayed away but I am back to hear you say
Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you
And the heavens above
Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you
And the heavens above
Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you 

Can you hear me 
Through the spaces 
Wondering in this wonderland
And if I try to understand it
Broken Man 
Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you
And the heavens above 
Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you 
Yeah hey yeah Repeats <start> I keep thinkin' any minute you'll be comin' home honey
I ain't seen nothin' of you in a month of sundays
Tell me how long gone are you gonna be
All you said was you had to get goin'
Oh but baby I wouldn't mind knowin' just
How long gone are you gonna be
How am I supposed to make any plans
When I still don't even understand
If you're ever gonna come back home to me
How long gone are you gonna be
Maybe I didn't pay enough attention
But I do believe you forgot to mention
Just how long gone are you gonna be
The phone ain't ringin' 'cause you still ain't callin'
I ain't been hearin' your footsteps fallin'
Tell me how long gone are you gonna be
How am I supposed to make any plans
When I still don't even understand
If you're ever gonna come back home to me
Tell me please
How long gone are you gonna be
Tell me how long gone are you gonna be <start> It's hard can't afford to stop
Keep on working till you're fit to drop
Then comes the weekend and my troubles go away
Monday morning brings them back again
No no no I'm not satisfied
Can't there be more to life
I can't see reasons why
Going steady have been a while
Ain't ready not by a mile
I try to tell her that I'm not he marrying kind
She tells me she's gonna change my mind
No no no I'm not satisfied
Can't there be more to life
I can't see reasons why
I want a place to go
I could go leave these streets alone
Everywhere you go now is just misery
There's no hope living in this city
No no no I'm not satisfied
Can't there be more to life
I can't see reasons why <start> Woke up this morning my baby's gone
Woke up this morning my baby's gone
I ain't had no loving since my baby been gone
I ain't got nobody to stay at home with me
I ain't got nobody to stay at home with me
I wonder 'bout my baby what's gonna happen to me
My baby's gone gone away from me
My baby's gone gone away from me
My whole life is in misery
My baby's gone gone away from me
My baby's gone gone away from me
And now I'm worried that you can see <start> Well you think that you're safe
Well I just think that you're a waste
Well you've been striving to win
Well you get knocked down again
Get up
Here's your chance now
All eyes are upon you
You better give your all
If you wanna rise up
You got to do what defines you
Cause if you give up give in you're gone
Well they're calling you strange
Well it's more like deranged
When they just push you aside
But it keeps you alive
Get up <start> You ain't been blue no no no
You ain't been blue
'Till you've had that mood indigo
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I sit and sigh go 'long blues
Always get that mood indigo
Since my baby said goodbye
In the evenin' when lights are low
I'm so lonesome I could cry
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me
I'm just as blue as blue could be
Always get that mood indigo
Since my baby said goodbye
Blues on my mind
Blues all around my head ooh
Blues on my mind
Blues all around my head ooh yeah
Woke up this morning but I'll be better off dead uhhuh
You ain't been blue no no no
You ain't been blue
'Till you've had that mood indigo
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I sit and sigh go 'long blues
Blues on my mind
Blues all around my head whoo
Blues on my mind
Blues all around my head
Woke up this morning but I'll be better off dead <start> I leave town
Take a ride
Maybe see the countryside
All green and gold
I breathe the better air I'm told
The city life is fine
But it seems like all the time
It's an uphill climb
And I never draw the line
This land this land
The soil turns to sand and stone
You could build a home
A little place to be alone
I worry 'bout the world
I worry too about a girl
But that's nothin' new
There's too much else to do
Take a man any man
Then I start to understand
What he believes
Becomes the very land he sees
It sets him free
Tranquility
A way to be
Gonna clear my head
And walk along the riverbed
Gonna play a song
And hope it finds her further on
I clear my head
I heard just what the river said
I made a song
It'll find you further on
Now I'm far away
From the troubles of the day
Another way
Another way to pray
Take a man any man
Then I start to understand
What he believes
Becomes the very land he sees
This land this land
I hear it and I understand
What I believe
Becomes the very land I see
Sets me free
The heart of me
A way to be <start> Built to spill you are pleased precariously momentarily chilled temporarily filled you will spill until lower expectations you will because at the time it seemed built to spill like an acceptable deal you feel you feel this is how you'll always feel it's no big deal I'm ashamed of you my friend you feel like you are on the verge of something real would you please would you please I'm to blame for this my friend on a role and built to spill would you please built to spill would you please you will carry out your function then occasionally filled you will you will come alive to something real then realize you're built to spill this is how you'll always feel it's no big deal <start> Sleigh bells ring are ya' listenin'
In the lane snow is glistenin'
A beautiful sight we're happy tonight
Walkin' in a Winter Wonderland
Gone away is the blue bird
Here to stay is the new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walkin' in a Winter Wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say Are you married We'll say No man
But you can do the job when you're in town
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we've made
Walkin' in a Winter Wonderland
Oh yeah
Hey come on let's go out into the snow
To a Winter Wonderland
Hats gloves boots ya'll
You better make sure you've got em' all
Please take my persuasion
'Cause outside everybody's havin' fun
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman
Until the other children come around

Knock him down
Over the ground there's a mantle of white
A heaven of diamonds shine down through the night
Our hearts will be thrillin' in spite of a chillin'
Let's go walkin' in the snow in this wonderland
Come on everybody let's go
We're walkin' in a Winter Wonderland
Merry Christmas everybody <start> Gotta do a little bit of reminiscing
On the days that just gone by
They say don't look back
But I take things in stride
Everybody wanna minimize
They want to change what can't be undone
I can see it's a recipe
That always leads to just no fun
Haven't slipped that time to take you back
I got a few regrets of my own
She had a diamond eye
Beauty all her own
Where are you now girl
You know you got that special place
I always see you
When love spits in my face
Regrets I've had mine
Lonely nights and a whole lot of wasted time
If you see her won't you tell her for me
It's better this way to avoid our misery
It's a little bit of luck
But a whole lot of hard work takes a toll
Most people don't know when they walk in
Heartache is what's in store
I thought I'd given up
And settled on the blues
But I'd always think of her
When I didn't know what to do
It'll be my burden
To track when it got hot
When she walked on
I didn't know what I'd just lost
Maybe she's out there
And thinking just like me
What if what would have happened
What could have been
Regrets I've had mine
Lonely nights and a whole lot of wasted time
If you see her won't you tell her for me
It's better this way to avoid our misery
Regrets I've had mine
Lonely times and too many wasted nights
If you see her won't you tell her for me
It's better this way to avoid our misery
Regrets I've had mine
Regrets I've had mine
Sometimes when I think back
I wonder where it was that I lost track
And I think of you ha ha baby who knew
Who knew
She's out there she's somewhere
I'm losing my head again
She's always haunting me
I'm going out of my head
Regrets I've had mine
Lonely nights and a whole lot of wasted time
If you see her won't you tell her for me
It's better this way to avoid our misery
Regrets I've had mine
Lonely times and too many wasted nights
If you see her won't you tell her for me
It's better this way to avoid our misery
I'm full of regret I'm full of regret
I'm full of regret I'm full of regret <start> On the lam from the law
On the steps of the capitol
You shot a plainclothes cop on the ten o'clock
And I saw momentarily
They flashed a photograph it couldn't be you
You'd been abused so horribly
But you were there in some anonymous room
And I recall that fall
I was working for the government
And in a bathroom stall off the National Mall
How we kissed so sweetly
How could I refuse a favor or two
For a trist in the greenery
I gave you documents and microfilm too
And from my ten floor tenement
Where once our bodies lay
How I long to hear you say
No they'll never catch me now
No they'll never catch me
No they cannot catch me now
We will escape somehow
Somehow
It was late one night
I was awoken by the telephone
I heard a strangled cry on the end of the line
Purloined in Petrograd
They were suspicious of where your loyalties lay
So I paid off a bureaucrat
To convince your captors they're to secret you away
And at the gate of the embassy
Our hands met through the bars
As your whisper stilled my heart
No they'll never catch me now
No they'll never catch me
No they cannot catch me now
We will escape somehow
Somehow
And I dreamt one night
You were there in fours
Head held high
In uniform
It was ten years on
When you resurfaced in a motorcar
With the wave of an arm
You were there and gone <start> You said you were hurtin' you almost lost your mind
The man you love he hurts you all the time
When things go wrong wrong with you it hurts me too yeah.
He loves another woman but I love you
But you love him I don't know what to do
When things go wrong wrong with you it hurts me too.
You love him more when you should love him less
Why sneak up behind him and take his mess
When things go wrong wrong with you it hurts me too it hurts me too.
Oh play your heart out.
Rod  Slide Solo   verses
Now he'd better leave you or you should put him down
I just can't stand to see you pushed around
When things go wrong wrong with you it hurts me too oh yeah.
So goodbye baby I've got to leave you now
I'm gonna pack my bags and move on down the line yeah
When things go wrong with you
When things go wrong so wrong with you yeah
When things go wrong wrong with you
It hurts me too it hurts me too yeah.
Rod  Slide Solo   verses to fade <start> I never made it as a lineman
I couldn't cut it as a Pittsburgh Steeler
I'm tired of losin' all the time man
But sin keeps sendin' my defenses reelin'
And this is how You rewind me
This is how You rewind me up when I'm really bad
This is how You rewind me up when I'm really bad
I'm not like YouI'm so sorry
The world's waitin on a distant glory
Each time I'm mistaken
Lord thanks to You I'm not forsaken
And I've been wrong I've been down
But through the battles and every struggle
These five words in my head scream But He isn't done yet
Yet yet yet oh no yet yet yet oh no
It's not like You didn't know better
I still don't want to do the things I still do
It must have been Romans 
Cause livin' in me is the sin that killed You
And this is how You rewind me up when I'm really bad
This is how You rewind me up when I'm really bad
Seems all I do is say I'm sorry
Your Word's waiting with forgiveness for me
It's time I put faith in  in Lamentations
And I've been wrong You bent down
And turned the bottomless pits to potholes
These five words in my head scream But He isn't done yet
Yet yet yet oh no yet yet yet oh no
Yet yet yet oh no yet yet yet oh no
I never made it as a nice man
I could be counted as the poor in spirit
And this is how You designed me
This is how You refine me
This is how You rewind me up when I'm really bad
This is how You rewind me up when I'm really bad
You blot my sinsIsaiah 
And  Your forgiveness floors me
This time I'm just beggin'
Lord can You cure my heart's frustration
And I've been wrong I've been down
But soon my problems are getting smaller
These five words in my head scream But He isn't done yet
Yet yet in Phillippians 
Yet yet oh He isn't done yet
Yet yet oh He isn't done yet
Yet yet <start> From the crow ii city of angels soundtrack
What's your lie
Warm glance a fake smile.
Eyes meet your mind runs wild.
This game you play I like in a way.
You expect to grab a child 
You think I'm innocent not wild.
Take me let's see how much I'm tamed.
Everybody listen while I think of all I know
How to live for sure  body wall into my precious soul.
I'll show you fears pleasure pain is my control.
Let your body lay in there warm flesh to your fear.
Warm lips a big smile.
Hatred runs through your insides.
This game you play  intimidation each day.
You think it's all a lie 
They want to destroy your life.
Anger twisted your life into pain
I wish I could take control.
I wish I could let go.
I wish I could break this mould.
Inside I'm so fucking cold.
I'm coming I'm coming I'm coming on you... 
Warm glance a fake smile.
Eyes meet your mind runs wild.
This game you play I like in a way.
You expect to grab a child 
You think I'm innocent not wild.
Take me  let's see how much I'm tamed.
Everybody listen while I become all I know.
How to live for sure  body wall into my precious soul.
I'll show you fears pleasure pain is my control.
Let your body lay in there warm flesh to your fear.
I wish I could lose control.
I wish I could let go.
I wish I could break this mould
Inside I'm so fuckin' cold.
Weapons inside so the truth unfolds.
I am done.
That was so fun.
This one's real.
How'd it feel
What's comin' what's comin' what's comin' on you 
I'm comin' I'm comin' I'm comin' on you...
 <start> Take me for what I'm worth though it may not amount to much
Take me from this abyss and put me back in touch
Though I have strayed from you though I have fallen from grace
I am back on higher ground up from that lonely place
Chorus
'cause I have found the going tough and you have suffered long enough
And I am undoin' this cruel stage that I've been going through
These words they come hard I've tried to make them live
I carve them from a humbleness I'm not familiar with
And though I have built a world made out of panes of glass
I won't shatter yours no more with a pain that lasts
Chorus
And I have found the going tough
But I will find the strength enough
And I am undoin' this cruel stage
That I've been going through
I didn't mean to hurt you
No that's not what I meant
Now I mean to alert you of my true intent
Take me for what I'm worth though it may not amount to much take me from this abyss and put me back in touch
Repeat st chorus <start> Living life is not too hard
If I can be born again
Many things could be chenged now
A bit of lightness
And less stupidity
Faking you're good at faking
When you are close to me
You always tell me I'm right
And I'd like to tell you
That I feel better
Alone.
Yes but the animal which is inside me
Won't let me live in happiness again
He takes all the coffee too
He renders me a slave of all my passions
He never does give up
He doesn't want to wait
And still the animal which is inside me
Wants you.
Inside me signs of fire
And water often quenches them
If you want them to burn
You leave them in the air
Or let them be on earth. <start> we keep shouting nothing ever changes. we keep fighting nothing ever changes. we want war. <start> There's a few cars out at  o'clock the limousine me and the patrol cop
Everything seems white in the middle of the night
Always get that feeling that things ain't quite right
The man on the beach now he wants to start a fight
Won't give him what he wants to feed the stereotype
The man in the shop said it's all about hype
I just can't believe it
It's just a little bit of chaos under quite a bit control
A little left of center been the only thing I know
Just a little bit of chaos under quite a bit control
It's such a large town to get so far
Maybe I'm neurotic it just seems bizarre
Company cars compete speedin' up the concrete
Earn a steady income and then become a deadbeat
Underneath the streetlight wait and watch the rat race
Fellowman don't like ya decides to put ya in your place
Always runnin' scared 'cause you don't understand
No way for you to see it
Does it make you mad that we live this way
Are you feeling rather frantic did we ruin your day
Who heeds the voice of the generation that's ahead
To be slavin' like a servant I'll be better off dead
Are you feeling rather frantic gonna be okay <start> Forever waiting for disaster
What David calls servant and master
Will you play it too
As this displacement begs for water
Swimming bathing
Drowning in sorrow
Scream with me
I crawl across this cracked expansion
I'll be buried soon
Beneath the sand with pure intentions
Wanting something someone to follow
For a change Ill refrain from hiding all of me from you

Pray for rain lose your name
And watch all your dreams fall through

I swoon upon my knees come crashing
Will you bury me
Today this small favor I am asking
Hold me you may drop me tomorrow
For a change Ill refrain from hiding all of me from you

Pray for rain lose your name
And watch all your dreams fall through

For a change Ill refrain from hiding all of me from you
Pray for rain lose your name
And watch all your dreams fall through
Here's my lullaby
Hush now don't you cry
Come down
Come down cold with us
With me
I flee to Decemberunderground
As you exhale I breathe in
And sink into the water underground
And I grow pale without you <start> Dry your eyes and take your song out it's a newborn afternoon.
And if you can't recall the singer you can still recall the tune.
Dry your eyes and play it slowly like you're marching off to war
sing it like you know he'd want it like we sang it once before.
And from the center of the circle to the midst of the waiting crowd
if it ever be forgotten sing it long and sing it loud and come dry your eyes.
And he taught us more about giving than we ever cared to know
but we came to find the secret and we never let it go.
And it was more than being holy and it was less than being free
and if you can't recall the reason can you hear the people sing.
Right through the lightning and the thunder to the dark side of the moon
to that distant falling angel that descended much too soon
and come dry your eyes.
Come dry your eyes. <start> I love New York City
Oh yeah New York City
I love New York City
Oh yeah New York City
Run it over run them out
Knock your block or tearing your doubt
Move on corners move around
Talk no talk breaking you down
We are a corporation
We are a company
We cut high but we're cuttin high anyway 
We are your mother's father
We are your fighter friend
It never started and it won't end
I love New York City
Oh yeah New York City
I love New York City
Oh yeah New York City
Broken faces burnt and bent
Deal off 
Ride on nothin' ride your head
Got no fear sayin' not said
We are a population
We are a factory
We don't do but we never did anyway
We are your mother's father
We are your fighter friend
It never started and it won't end
I love New York City
Oh yeah New York City
I love New York City
Oh yeah New York City
Oh oh oh oh oh oh New York oh oh oh oh oh oh
I love New York City
Oh yeah New York City
I love New York City
Oh yeah New York City <start> Chicka uh chicka uh
For the benefit of Tom and Mary
Before our guests arrive
If they haven't found out already
It's gonna blow their minds
Will they find the strength
To find the will to testify
That for the benefit of Tom and Mary
There's something we can't hide anymore
Everybody here knows the story
Some with fabricated extra parts
See the sisters shout in whispers
Feeding hot air to the sparks
Put a damper on the party
It will lighten up this room
But for the benefit of Tom and Mary
We've got to see the truth today
Ms. Suthernson says here they come
And all the chatter and the smiles
They come undone
You could hear a pin drop on the carpet floor
Everyone's pretending not to hear them
Knocking at the door
For the benefit of Tom and Mary
Before our guests arrive
If they haven't found out already
It's gonna blow their minds
Haven't found out already
And yet the seams all seem to show
That for the benefit of Tom and Mary
For the benefit of Tom and Mary
For the benefit of Tom and Mary
We gotta let the truth me known yeah <start> So you and I we've come to this place
And never did I believe that I'd survive
Now what ever happens know that I'm about honor...
...honor among thieves 
So you and I we talk a little
About the themes and all the thinking then I die...
...a little
whatever happened about honoring thy father mother...
...honor me.
Backtrack easy everything's easy... tell me again
'Is it us or them us or them'
Backtrack people beware the vat people prepare the cat people
Beware the bad people and I'm a bad man...
So you and I we talk a little...
About the fate of all those days and then I DIE.
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO YOUR WORDS ABOUT HONOR
...HONOR AMONG MEN
Backtrack easy everything's easy... tell me again
'Is it us or them us or them'
Backtrack people beware the vat people prepare the cat people
Beware the bad people I'm a bad bad man...
So you and I we've come to this place
And never did I believe that I'd survive... this...
Now what ever happens know that I'm about honor...
...honor honor honor...
Backtrack people everythings evil... tell me again
'Is it us or them us or them'
Backtrack people beware the vat people prepare the cat people
Beware the bad people I'm a black cat man... <start> Sometimes I get to thinking of another time
When we hide so little but you were mine
But now so much is changed and all the price the years have caused
Somewhere between then and now so much got lost
So much got lost when you try to gain
And what has gone come back again
We burned our bridges as we crossed
And on the way to the other side so much got lost
 steel 
We want the world lost each other
And what good is one without the other
We threw love to the wind and just let it be tossed
And in the calm after the storm so much got lost
So much got lost... <start> LOLA

All the dogs and angels are turning
Burning in their sleep
You can't see me now but I'm watching over you
A broken smile never lies
A busted mirror cannot see you cry
I'm looking through one glass eye
You can't see me now but I'm watching over you
All the clocks are broken
Every door is open
Take me to the ocean
And we'll ride on the hurricane
Until we're washed away
Take off the mask and tell me what you find
Behind the curtain everyone's deaf dumb and blind
Everyone becomes the one the one they most despise
You're looking through one glass eye
Well you can't see me now but I'm watching over you <start> Seems a little bit odd when you think about how the way he used to
Certain things that you did when you were with me but not with him or are you
Looking for a purpose in the time we spend with me you argue
I don't want to be the man you used to have but in a brand new forum
So many times I let this go
But I won't let you do this
You tried to turn me into him
I will not stand for this again
I've held my thoughts inside my head
But now I'm leaving
I was hoping maybe things would change but I guess it's just the way you are
Even if you understood I feel like everything would carry on
See the little thing you're looking for it's not in me and you won't find it
He's the one you really want it isn't me you know you can't deny it
So many times I let this go
But I won't let you do this
You tried to turn me into him
I will not stand for this again
I've held my thoughts inside my head
But now I'm leaving
Seem to think you've got it right this time
This is never gonna be alright
I don't think you understand that I will never be the man that you need
Wanted me to be the only one
Couldn't live up to the chosen one
Sick of all the little games you play
And now I think it's time that I leave
So many times I let this go
But I won't let you do this
You tried to turn me into him
I will not stand for this again
I've held my thoughts inside my head
But now I'm leaving <start> Tossed into my mind stirring the calm
You splash me with beauty and then you pull me down
Because you came from out of nowhere
My glance turns to a stare
Obsession rules me I'm yours from the start
I know that you see me Our eyes interlock
Because you came from out of nowhere
My glance turns to a stare
One minute here and one minute there
Don't know if I'll laugh or cry
One minute here and one minute there
And then you wave goodbye 
Sifting to the bottom every day for two
All energy funnels all becomes you
Because you came from out of nowhere
My glance turns to a stare <start> You make my teeth clinch and my hands shake
Do you ever see what you do to me
Wearing me out just wearing me out
But I'm wearing you down
You're impossible to love me
So impossible to win or breathe
I'm wearing you out just wearing you out
But I'm wearing you down
Take what you want from me
It means nothing now
Take everything from me it means nothing now
Not so easy to forgive harder to forget
Take what you want
I make your lips moan and your moans quake
Try to think through
What I can do to you
It's wearing you thin
Can I begin to wear you out
Take what you want from me
It means nothing now
Take everything from me it means nothing now
Not so easy to forgive harder to forget
Take what you want
I'm impossible to figure out
So impossible you had your doubt
Take what you want from me
It means nothing now
Take everything honey it means nothing now
Not so easy to forgive harder to forget
Take what you want from me it means nothing now
Take everything honey it means nothing now
Not so easy to forgive harder to forget
Take what you want from me
Take what you want from me <start> Well once at liberty lunch in austin texas...

Because your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear
So while you sit back and wonder why
I got this fuckin' thorn in my side
Oh my it's a mirage
I'm tellin' y'all it's sabotage
So listen up 'cause you can't say nothin'
You'll shut me dow with a push of your button
But I'm out and I'm gone
I'll tell you now I keep it on and on
'cause what you see you might not get
And we can bet so don't you get souped yet
You're scheming on a thing that's a mirage
I'm trying to tell you now it's sabotage
Why our backs are now against the wall
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
I can't stand it I know you planned it
But I'm gonna set it straight this watergate
I can't stand rockin' when I'm in this place
Because I feel disgrace because you're all in my face
But make no mistakes and switch up my channel

It's the same old story same old song and dance my friend
It's the same old story same old story
Same old song and dance
Fate comes aknockin' doors start lockin'
Your old time connection change your direction
Ain't gonna change it can't rearrange it
Can't stand the pain when it's all the same to you my friend
When you're low down and dirty from walkin' the street
With your old hurdygurdy no one to meet
Say love ain't the same on the south side of town
You could look but you ain't gonna find it around
It's the same old story same old song and dance my friend
It's the same old story same old story
Same old song and dance yeah <start> As I wake I see a morning star
Through the window dimly shines
Its final statement at the closing of the day
I've got a few more minutes of night time before I rise
As the dawn is breaking through the darkness
The morning star will fade but never die
Morning star I can't see your face no more and that's good
Get out now out on the streets of your nowhere neighborhood
As I laid down last night I felt no pain
The day went on without a sound
Another night to put all the business away
I had a few more hours of night time before I'd rise
All the stars were out last night in the sky
I slept right through as they all went by
Soon the dawn was breaking up the darkness
The morning star will fade but never die
Morning star I can't see your face no more and that's good
Get out now out on the streets of your nowhere neighborhood
You come along with a color that I can't match
Gold chain and a crystal ball attached
You're coming from the wrong direction
And as I sleep tonight I'll dream of you
Sleeping somewhere far away
You come into my head so pretty and so true
I get a few more hours to dream of you till I rise
As the fireworks shoot off in the sky
I sleep right through as it all goes by
Soon the darkness would suck up into the dawn
The morning star will fade but never die
Morning star I can't see your face no more and that's good
Get out now out on the streets of your nowhere neighborhood
You come along with a code that I can't crack
Gold chain and a crystal ball attached
You were coming from the wrong direction
You were coming from the wrong direction
You were coming from the wrong direction <start> She comes up with the morning sun
And tells me life has just begun
Oh what it is to be young
And in the early evening light
She brings me flowers from the sun
Oh what it is to be young
And if you see her you will know
She's like a shadow
Falling softly on the snow
And in the early evening light
She brings me flowers for the night
Oh what it is to be young
And if you see her you will know
She's like a shadow
Falling softly on the snow <start> Knockdown loaded
Asphalt rollin'
Can you do me one better
With a magnified header
I feel nothin'I feel it all the time
I feel nothin'doin' just fine
Ya knew all along
Pushed out of that arm
Onehundred and fifty
Will do you no wrong
I feel nothin'I feel it all the time
I feel nothin'doin' just fine
For the longest time
Been ridin' so slow
Gear grindin' I didn't know
Lend me and you are 
I can see so far <start> just give me one more sunny day
bring one more summer breeze my way
one more blue sky to call mine
come on just let it shine
so what did I learn from the Ferris wheel
had a view from the top
should have known it would stop some day
never forgot how it made me feel
but a ticket to ride never buys the same high as the fall
still you never stop longing for more
Just give me one more sunny day
bring one more summer breeze my way
one more blue sky to call mine
come on just let it shine
Where did we go when we just drove around
top down radio up can't you see us now
whatever happened to the plans we made
why did we wait it's never to late
don't let go of your dreams
no matter how dark it seems
Just give me one more sunny day
bring one more summer breeze my way
one more blue sky to call mine
come on just let it shine
wouldn't it be so fine
just open up our minds
and it's summer time
oh yeah
Just give me one more sunny day
ooh ooh
Just give me one more sunny day
hey hey
Just give me one more sunny day
bring one more summer breeze my way
one more blue sky to call mine
come on just let it shine
hey hey give me one more sunny day
hey hey yeah yeah come on just let it shine
with a blue sky to call mine <start> I cant seem to remember
and i cant seem to forget
i cant remember day to day
but my lifes not over yet
i aint got no time
and i aint got no will
i aint got much of anything
but i'm ready for my next big thrill
Chorus
and it feels like im losing control
when chaos has taken its toll
and im goin insane..........today
and im losin' my brain.....hurray
now i dont wanna leave here
and i dont wanna stay
my brain keeps telling me one thing
but i go the other way
i need something i can believe in
i need me a bit of luck
everybody wants to grow up but
i dont give a fuck <start> Not feeling brokenhearted
Feeling just like when it started
Awake it's a new day
No more heartache breaking away
Out of the blue
Into the slipstream out of the blue
Into the slipstream out of the blue
Into the slipstream out of the blue
Into the slipstream
Sky blue nothing to loose
Girl I want to get to know you
It's come from out of nowhere
All is changing it's in the air
Out of the blue
Into the slipstream out of the blue
Into the slipstream out of the blue
Into the slipstream out of the blue
Into the slipstream
Into a freefall out of the blue
Into a dreamworld out of the blue
Into the sunset out of the blue
Into the slipstream out of the blue
Do you feel what I feel is it real
Can't conceal so unreal what I feel
Yeah
Out of the blue
Not feeling brokenhearted
Feeling just like when it started
Out of the blue
Into the slipstream out of the blue
Into the slipstream out of the blue
Into the slipstream out of the blue
Into the slipstream out of the blue
Into the slipstream out of the blue
Into the slipstream out of the blue
Into the slipstream out of the blue
Into the slipstream <start> You're just a face in the crowd
A tiny hole in the cloud
You're trying to find your way in
To let your soul shine back out
We're just a twist in a seam
A splash of paint on a screen
We're making all kinds of shapes
Somehow we can straighten out the bends
This is our time we can't rewind
Our place to shine out we can live it anyway
This is our time to feel sublime
Our place to shine now and we can do it anyway
We can't rewind
Do you think we can change
A different color and shade
I guess a new kind of thing
Somehow we can straighten out the bends
This is our time we can't rewind
Our place to shine out and we can live it anyway
This is our time to feel sublime
A place to shine now we can do it anyway
Oh yes we can do it our way then
Stop taking me for a fool now
Yeah I've got this feeling inside me
But I guess you knew
We can work it out
We can find some place new
We can't rewind
We can't rewind
You're just a face in the crowd
A tiny hole in a cloud
This is our time we can't rewind
Our place to shine out and we can live it anyway
This is our time to feel sublime
A place to shine now and we can do it anyway
This is our time we can't rewind
Our place to shine out we can do it anyway
This is our time to feel sublime
A place to shine now and we can do it anyway <start> Se si spoglia un'anima
Di ogni ragione
Resta solo un timido accenno negli occhi
Poter dare solo una sola
Occasione all'amore
Prima che ognuno sia preso dalla sua stessa vita
Prima che la poesia
Ci sembri follia
Prima che diventi un ricordo
Un ricordo
E un peccato
L'estate vola via
Scossa da un vento orchestrale
Si infrange su di noi
... solo un peccato
L'estate vola via
Dura un sorriso crudele
Non sai pi cosa dire
Con alto peccato
Un altro peccato
Un vero peccato
Ogni bacio chiama un altro
E poi un altro ancora
Un paesaggio che stiamo per lasciare per sempre
E che vorremmo portarci lontano
Un ricordo un ricordo un ricordo
 un peccato
L'estate vola via
Scossa da un vento orchestrale
Si infrange su di noi
 solo un peccato
L'estate vola via
Dura un sorriso crudele
Non sai pi cosa dire
Con alto peccato
Un altro peccato
Un vero peccato
Scivola sulla pelle
Scivola e se ne va
Scivola il piacere
Senza lasciare scia
Come una barca a vela
Che mi trascina via
Altro che Adamo ed Eva
Chi mi assolver
L'estate vola via
Scossa da un vento orchestrale
Si infrange su di noi
 solo un peccato
L'estate vola via
Dura un sorriso crudele
Non sai pi cosa dire
Con alto peccato
Un altro peccato
Un vero peccato <start> Originally by The Outlets
Waiting for the while
Will she ring my dial
Can't stay out past eight
Bored out all the rest
She knows where her heart goes
She thinks I'm a jerk
Taught her dirty words
Sweat and bake and heal
Is my timing real
She knows where her heart goes
Knock me down again <start> The elevator in the hotel lobby has a lazy door
The man inside is going to a hotel room
He jumped out right after seeing just the very sight of me
Decided he better hike it to the second floor
Its temporary this place I'm in
I permanently wont do this again
My belongings scattered across the hotel floor
Now then later I was thinking it over by the snack machine
I thought about you and a candy bar
The now and laters now that I've got stuck between my teeth
I fell asleep to the greatest movie of the year
A man gets lonely for heavens sake
He's wondering only what did you do today
The worlds spinning around into an old sad song
Well it's coming down outside like Ive never even seen before
I fell into some kind of sorry state
But looking back now I think it's time for me to laugh about it
And get my things together and find something to say
Well I feel awful and I believe
That time gets wasted in this misery
And darling I never wanna come back home <start> you said i'd be blue if i fell in love with you.
fuck yer fans
one two three four.
im going to kill you.
get outta my fucking life.
i've waited my whole life.
stop living my fucking life.
you've ruined my fucking life.
you dumb bitch i love.
get outta my fucking town.
stop coming to my fucking town.
grew up in this fucking town.
you've ruined my favorite town.
you dumb bitch i love.
get outta yer fucking scene.
if you know what i fucking mean.
get out of our fucking scene.
i hate yer fucking scene.
you dumb bitch i love.
yer breaking my fucking heart.
you think yer so fucking smart.
i'll tear yer lie apart.
you have no fucking heart.
you dumb bitch i love. <start> Anna blue oh
Anna blue oh
Anna
Not me not you
Just time and a sigh
On a line look in fine print
The small town dream
To be part of the scene
You can wear it with a style
In your eyes a story never spoken
Anna blue oh
Anne blue oh
Anna
Just me just you
Just a wide eyed girl
Turn around quick
I'm walkin' my high heeled shoes
And I'll be talkin' pretty smooth
Like some souped up cosmo girl
In a stupifying world
But before I fall I wake up crying
Oh... when I sit back
I'll sigh and think... <start> Du starrst mich an
Ich wei genau warum
Du gibst es nur nicht zu
Doch ich bin ja nicht dumm
Es ist mein Aussehen
Das wei ich ganz genau
Es tut mir weh
Das ist hier keine Show
Du siehst gut aus
Das sagt man dir sehr oft
Hast viele Freunde
Wirst von allen nur gemocht
Doch ich bin einsam
Verstecke mein Gesicht
Verpa' das Leben
Doch du du siehst das nicht
Doch irgendwann da reicht es
Jetzt platzt mir der Kragen
Hr mir mal gut zu
Ich hab' dir was zu sagen
Ich bin nicht hlich
Ich sehe nur anders aus als du
Ich bin nicht hlich
Nun gib's doch endlich zu
Ich bin nicht hlich
O nein ich find' mich schn
Ich bin nicht hlich
Du mut ja nicht her sehen
Es ist vorbei
Ich komme jetzt heraus
Schlu mit Verstecken
Ich mach' das Beste draus
Kannst du mich hren
Du kannst mich nicht verstehen
Tut es dir weh
mich einfach anzusehen
Glanz und Glimmer
Prgen deine Welt
Fr dich ist's leicht
Du hast was dir gefllt
Ich habe nichts
Immer nur mich selbst
Es ist deprimierend
Da du nichts von mir hltst
Ich bin nicht hlich
Ich sag' es dir noch mal
Ich bin nicht hlich
Bin ich dir so egal
Ich bin nicht hlich
Du kannst auch mit mir reden
Ich bin nicht hlich
Ich bin dir berlegen
Denk mal darber nach
Ich bin eigentlich ganz nett
Ich kann gut zuhren
Zerre dich nicht gleich ins Bett
Ich wrde alles tun
Da du mich akzeptierst
Dein Herz ist kalt
Da ich daran erfrier'
Und wenn ich knnte
Hielt ich mich fern von dir
Das ist unmglich
Denn die Welt ist voll von Menschen wie dir
Ich bin nicht hlich
Glaubst du wirklich du wrst schn
Schnheit ist relativ
Und sie wird vergehen
Ich bin nicht hlich
Ich bin ein Mensch wie du
Ich bin nicht hlich
Schau mir nur einfach zu
Ich bin nicht hlich
Es ist das Innere das zhlt
Ich bin nicht hlich
Doch du du hast gewhlt
Ich bin nicht hlich
Ist nur das uere gut
Ich bin nicht hlich
Und dafr voller Wut
Ich bin nicht hlich
Ich sehe nur anders aus als du
Ich bin nicht hlich
Nun gib's doch endlich zu <start> This stoy keeps writing itself pages and chapters of you and I of things that I wish would have happened of things that I wish you would say then you whispered to me said I missed you as I silently basked in your words these eight letters that keep me from growing out and away from you
we still return to the seasons where these corners and cracks of this street are still leading me home
this tongue just keeps tying itself unspoken words from the mouth of a bottle of things that I wish I could tell you of things that you can't understand and we still return to the life where these...
I keep running back in your direction to these beaches and swings that we know it's as empty as when we had left it still writing these letters to you
the truth behing story incredible glories of you and what my mind has made you the life bearing pictures these porches these splinters and summers that are making me whole
still I fly high and away from these dreams
still I fly high and away from these things <start> The clouds are really cheap
The way I seen 'em thru the ports
Of which there is a halfadozen
On the base of my resorz
You wouldn't think I'd have too many
Since I never cared for sports
But I'm never really lonely
In my Excentrifugal Forz
There's always Korla Plankton
Him 'n me can play the blues
An' then I'll watch him buff that
Tiny ruby that he use
He'll straighten up his turban
An' eject a little ooze
Along a onecelled Hammond Organism
Underneath my shoes
An' then I'll call PUP TENTACLE
I'll ask him how's his chin
I'll fine out
How the future is
Because that's where he's been
His little feet got long 'n flexible
An' suckers fell right in
The time he crossed the line
From LATER ON to WAY BACK WHEN <start> Halusin pahaa
Lahjaksi antaa
Vaan sit samaa
Lysin mun paikalta
Mun kadulla on kuoppia
Mun ovella vain lampaita
Kun koputtaa niin aukaistaan
Tule vaan se on halpaa
Jokaista rataa
pitisi koittaa
Pala mun lihaa
Girls just wanna have fun
Mun kadulla on kuoppia
Mun ovella vain lampaita
Kun koputtaa niin aukaistaan
Tule vaan se on halpaa <start> There's no wrong way to f a girl with no legs
Just tell her you love her as she's crawlin' away
There's no wrong way to f a bitch with no faith
Now you'll never be sad again
Lovin' you are the two best things in a world that's skipping town
Reaching blind into the deepest mouth in the brownest place around
There's something I miss in her cum stained lips
So I get the first kiss before she takes the last bite
Genital outlaws in a positive way and in everything bagel too
Getting strangeld by the junkie priest as the boys get stoned in school
There's a knock at the door and your parents come in
They thought you were a different girl <start> Somebody Somebody
Come to my side
I'm tired I'm crying
I'm sick inside
My woman that woman
Just wasn't right
Help me now please my friend
I never felt so bad before
Never never before
So funny so funny
Just like a show
One name two people
All in a row
Somebody Somebody
Someone must go
Help me now please my friend
I never felt so bad before
Never never before
I was hurt when I was younger
By a woman who was cold
She took my name
She took my body
And she threw away my soul
Can't hide I can't hide my misery
I know my sorrow won't set me free
She did it d'you see she did it to me
Help me now please my friend
I never felt so bad before
Never never before <start> Nothings last forever
Of that I'm sure
Now you've made an offer
I'll take some more
Young loving may be
Oh so mean
Will I still survive
The same old scene'
In our lighter moments
Precious few
It's all that heavy weather
We're going through
When I turn the corner
I can't believe
It's still the same old movie
That's haunting me
Young loving may be <start> Oh Susie Q Oh Susie Q
I love you my Susie Q
I like the way you walk
I like the way you talk
I like the way you walk
I like the way you talk
My Susie Q
Oh Susie Q Oh Susie Q
Oh Susie Q
Well I love you my Susie Q
Which way to Susie Q
Which way to Susie Q
Which way to Susie Q
You never leave me blue
My Susie Q
Oh Susie Q Oh Susie Q
Oh Susie Q I love you
My Susie Q <start> We flew over the cascades
We were forced to behave while we sat in rows like children
I crossed some standard state lines
I finally found myself so far away from home
And even though New England intrigued us thrilled us
Our bones were cold as stick and stones
We flew over the cascades
Just to find ourselves in storms we've never known
The winds were like a beast with wings and yes
Everything was blown so far away
And I fell down I failed to cut its neck
Even after hours of waiting
There was no telling when the storm would find its way
The lands we tried to memorize
Were no longer wrapped in tepid shades of red
And through the night the storm held me down
And bit my neck and said it'd be okay
I stared into the fury
And the beauty of its overwhelming strength
The winds were like a beast with wings and yes
Everything was blown so far away
And I fell down I failed to cut its neck
I saw a dim light in the mouth of the beast
So I followed it in it was too late to retreat
It swallowed me whole and my flesh became meat
And I can't look back now 'cause the beast has come clean
We flew over the cascades
We're forced to behave <start> I'm so glad you finally called
It's been way too long
How's New York and you been getting on
You say you're prayin' for one whole week
Well let me just tell you
The weather here's been kind of crazy too
Summer in Dixie sure been cold
Even when the sun burns hot enough
There'd be tar on the road
Way down in my heart a north wind blows
Summer in Dixie sure been cold
Now if Manhattan turns you on
Do what you gotta do
Don't worry how I'll make it without you
I'll just here on the porch
And wait here for the breeze
To whisper your name through the willow trees
Summer in Dixie it sure been cold
Even when the sun burns hot enough
There'd be tar on the road
Way down in my heart a north wind blows
Summer in Dixie sure been cold
You know I'd never
Talk about the weather
Summer in Dixie sure been cold
Even when the sun burns hot enough
There'd be tar on the road
Way down in my heart a north wind blows
Summer in Dixie sure been cold
Summer in Dixie sure been cold <start> Slowly he settles down
To give them what they want
He tries to keep himself together
I would slam my head in the ground
Before i tell you this
He turns his head to the floor
As it falls away
I'm a product of your hate
Just the one that you'd create
Is anybody listening to a word I say
I hate today
You tought me everything you know
The blame will surely show
I tried to keep it down forever
The days have taken years
To conquer all my fears
I stand before you now
Sickened and cut down
I'm a product of your hate
Just the one that you'd create
Is anybody listening to a word I say
I hate today <start> Intrumental <start> Every time I think that I'm the only one who's lonely someone calls on me
And every now and then I spend the time to find a person who's so
Close to me
And then along comes Mary 
And then she want to give me kicks and
Now what to get from me will be memories
I really got the tales all the trials and tribulations
No one's ever seen
Why do birds suddenly appear every time you are near
Just like me they long to be
Close to you
Why do stars fall down from the skies
Every time you walk by
Just like me they long to be
Close to you
From the day that you were born the fairies got together and decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled angel dust in your hair
Golden starlight in your eyes ooh
I find my baby gotta hold her tight
Gotta grab some afternoon delight
My motto's always been when it's right it's right
Why wait until the middle of a cold dark night
When everything's a little clearer in the light of day
And we know the night is always gonna be here anyway







Have my baby
What a wonderful way of saying how much you love me
Having my baby
What a lovely way of saying what you're thinkin' of me
I can see it
Faces glowing
I can see it in your eyes a happy knowing
'Cause you're having my baby
You're the woman I love and I love what it's doing to ya
Having my baby
You're a woman in love and I love what's going through ya
Love love will keep us together
Think of me babe whenever
Some sweettalking guy comes along
Singin' a song
Don't mess around you just gotta be strong
Stop  I really love you
Stop  I been thinking of you
Look in my heart and let love
Our little boy is four years old and quite a little man
So we spell out the words we don't want him to understand
Like TOY or SURPRISE
But the words we're holding from him now
Tear the heart right out of me
Our DIVORCE
Becomes final today
Me and little SOB
Will be going away
But I love you both and this will be pure HEdoubleL on me
How I wish we could stop this DIVORCE



 <start> So bring sunrise slowly
So she has the time to see
This moonlit cemetery stones
And all surrounding sounds echo
Through the trees and they're filled with screams
This marble's marked with her name
If the keys she takes can drive her away
I'll be here for you if there's ever a doubt
Though it's hard for me but I can't live without
You in my life
So drink up lovely
Because in time you'll see
That if you choose to ignore me
This story will end in tragedy
Take these words a forewarning
This candle's lit emitting lost flames
If the keys she takes can drive her away
I'll be here for you if there's ever a doubt
Though it's hard for me but I can't live without
I'll be here for you if there's ever a doubt
Though it's hard for me but I can't live without
You in my life
Take these words a forewarning
This marble's marked with her name
If the keys she takes can drive her away
I'll be here for you if there's ever a doubt
Though it's hard for me but I can't live without
I'll be here for you if there's ever a doubt
Though it's hard for me but I can't live without
You in my life <start> Woke up this morning my baby was gone
Woke up this morning my baby was gone
I felt so bad my baby's gone
I ain't got nobody stayin' home with me
I ain't got nobody stayin' home with me
My baby she's gone I'm in misery
Well baby I'm all alone
Yeah baby I'm all alone
I ain't no lovin'
Since my baby's been gone
Oh lord
All alone
Oh baby I'm all alone
I had no lovin'
Since my baby's been gone everybody <start> Get out on the floor
Do things to make 'em adore you
Show 'em why you were born
And put a little mustard on it
Don't tell me what time it is now
I know what time it is now
It's show time
Show time
Teach the world to move to your sound
Hop around and twirl around
And put a little mustard on it
Don't tell me who to love or hate now
'Cause I'm totally filled with hate now
It's show time
One for the money
Two for the show
It is all done with computers
Hey mister
Put a little mustard on that mustard
Don't tell me how to do my job now
'Cause I'm totally doin' my job now
Show time <start> They saw the lights on the horizon
Out of the seas it came shinin'
The buildings so high
They seemed to touch the sky
Miami Oh Miami
They felt the warm breezes blowing
From off the strange new ocean
They reached the end safe
It was a new day
Miami. Oh Miami
Oh it must've seemed
Something from a dream
Shinin' through the night
All those city lights
Staring at the shore
Hungry tired and worn
Could it really be
Were they really free
And so they came
A hundred thousand
To find a way of life
They could believe in
Far away from home
With nothing of their own
To Miami Oh Miami <start> If you ever leave me I'll be sad and blue
Don't you ever leave me I'm so in love with you
The birds in the sky would be sad and lonely
If they knew that I'd lost my one and only
They'd be sad don't be bad to me
The leaves on the trees would be softly sighin
If they heard from the breeze that you left me cryin'
They'd be sad don't be bad to me
But I know you won't leave me 'cos you told me so
And I've no intention of letting you go
Just as long as you let me know you won't be bad to me <start> 
Estou parado
Buscando encontrar
Algum que tente explicar
Dores da mente
Sonho feroz
De algum que sente ser s
Refro
Sentirse s
Dor que ilumina
Vontade de estar longe
Quero voltar pra minha paz
Enquanto penso
Quantas vezes errei
Tentando ser o que no sei
E tudo passa
Sempre veloz
Pra algum que sente em ser s


 <start> I called you on the telephone 'cause I was lonely
I called you up just to hear you
Your eyes I know are a cold cold blue
Pale whit skin dead like a mannequin
Seem to fade
Looking and not wanting to come up to date
Like a broken clock
The hand is still
Through the pain I was watching as sound hit my ears
We don't fit anymore
We don't fit anymore
Not the same
Not the same
Not the same same same
Ripped up in the shadows
Over and over again
I remember before as your mouth
It touched my face
Small hands grabbing me
Trapped in my thoughts
You repeating like a machine gun
Phantasmagoria
The times pelting me
Pelting me
Ripped up in the shadows
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again <start> Il vento gonfiava le mie vesti
di veramente stabile erano le mie scarpe nere
alle caviglie ortopediche.
Un tempo passavo ore in palestra
continuai a inseguirla per inerzia.
La vidi stagliarsi tra alberi e cielo
e dopo un piccolo volo
camminare monca e rapida
avrete anche voi visto
camminare le aquile. <start> Yeah
Detention Girl
I say yeah yeah detention girl
Well she can come and bring us back from life 
Want to be my psycho boyfriend NO
Detention girl

Detention girl
Oh Detention
Oh Detention
Detention girl
It hurts so bad
I'm so glad 
Yeah Detention
I say yeah yeah detention girl
She's goin down down detention girl
I say yeah yeah Detention Girl <start> Whenever I come back the air on Railroad is making the same sounds
And the shop fronts on Holly are dirty words 
We peered through the windows new bottoms on barstools but the people remain the same.
With prices inflating as if saved from the gallows.
There's a bellow of buzzers and the people stop working and they're all so excited.
Passing through unconscious states when I awoke I was on the highway.
With your hands on my shoulders a meaningless movement a movie script ending.
And the patrons are leaving now we all know the words were true
In the sappiest songs 
I'll put them to bed but they won't sleep they're just shuffling the sheets
They toss and turn 
Passing through unconscious states when I awoke I was on the onset of a later stage
The headlights are beacons on the highway. <start> So the boys got together and formed a band...uh fate played the
Straight man and since then they've never looked back...
You lads welcome to t'Club be I've seen you on t'telly with your long
Hair and pimples. 
We arrived at the gig looking rough
Not happy we'd all had enough
Of eight hours on the road 
Legs Larry said eeh It's the boozer for me dear boy.
Yup yup yes indeedy
And the hotel reception was empty and cold
With horrid red wallpaper forty years old
It stank like a rhino house
Mr. Slater said Pooh I can smell Vindaloo.
Oh really No Sir O'Reilly
Hobnob
And we wave to the people who frown
At our hair as we ride into town
And Chalky and Nozz had set up the gear
At the club where the Dohl Pal Show would appear
In person as themselves 
In person as themselves
Then Neil Fred and I played darts for awhile.
Before we switched on our theatrical smiles
Hey you remember
Hot dogs on sale in the foyer
Hey...
You can have a drink in your dressing rooms lads but you can't come
Into club looking like that. We can't oblige. Thank you.
Hey Redneck
We've had 'em all here you know Tommy Ray.
Oh aye
That's a brand new scratch on the piano cost you seventyfive quid to put that
Right.
Whoa who did that
Aye remember Frank Fesher
And and Buddy Greece
Aye
Put off thought really here doesn't it
Whoa what
Will you take your empty glasses back the bar
Any artiste mentioning football will be paid off immediately.
Hoover
It's not for meself lads it's for me daughter.
Five pints of lager and one Coke
It's not me lads it's the manager what makes the rules. <start> I bet you're wondering
If you woke up today
Just to learn why the caged bird sings
I bet you're wondering if the goddesses are all crazy
Or just keeping it interesting
Situated slightly outside society
At odds with its odd offerings
I bet you're teetering on the edge of sobriety
Just to alleviate a few things
Like the fear that you're standing here
'cause you want to be liked
You know you need your instrument
But does your instrument need to be miked
You keep imagining
That pretty soon you will just disappear
And thinking that one thing
Is what saves you from your fear of being here
Here for now
Here for now
Here for now
I bet you're looking for the little red x
Next to the red arrow
And the words 'you are here'
I bet you're hoping that your heart will send up
The white flag this time
Or some sign that the coast is clear
Yeah the moment when your heart jumps
It's all that's happening
And once again
It's like the first time you've felt that shock
Yeah the moment when your heart jumps
It's all that's happening
And I was right behind the door when you knocked
Thinking maybe I'm just standing here
'cause I want to be liked
I know I need my instrument
But does my instrument need to be miked
I keep imagining
That pretty soon I will just disappear
And thinking that one thing
Is what saves me from my fear of being here
Here for now
Here for now
Here for now <start> Look at me
Gone away my friend
Can't you see
Buried once again
Endless time
Reached the promised land
State of mind
Suffer by my hand
The end is still long long way
Overdosed
On my own damn fears
Felt the most
Pain I've felt in years
Sacrificed
My own sanity
Lock the vice then come set me free <start> Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night and
Wouldn't you love to love her
Takes to the sky like a bird in flight and
Who will be her lover
All your life you've never seen
A woman taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven
Will you ever win
She is like a cat in the dark and then
She is the darkness
She rules her life like a fine skylark and when
The sky is starless
All your life you've never seen
A woman taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven
Will you ever win
Will you ever win
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
She rings like a bell through the night and
Wouldn't you love to love her
She rules her life like a bird in flight and
Who will be her lover
All your life you've never seen
A woman taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven
Will you ever win
Will you ever win
Rhiannon

Dreams unwind
Love's a state of mind
Dreams unwind
Love's a state of mind
Dreams unwind
Love's a state of mind <start> Should I thirst for knowledge
Can I beg you for some water
Should I fight your battles
Can I rest upon your shoulders
I hope I'm able to ride out this storm
So come on Gabriel and blow your horn
Reach Reach out to me
Can't you see I need you to save me
Yeah Reach Reach out to me
Can't you see I need you to hold me
Should I beg for mercy
Can I be the one you treasure
Should I question knowledge
Can I have all of your answers
I hope I'm able to find love today
Can I ask you to light my way
Reach Reach out to me
Can't you see I need you to guide me
Yeah Reach Reach out to me
Can't you see I need you to love me
Take me out of these walls
Take me somewhere I can see
Take me away from it all
Please just reach out to me <start> Written by stevie nicks.
What can I say this time
Which card shall I play
The dream is not over
The dream is just away
And you will fly like some little wing straight back to the sun
The dream was never over
The dream has just begun
The dream has just begun
Fingers find the ivory keys
And a song begins to begin l
Like a wolf on the run
And you will find while in the wind something that you lost
The dream was never over no
The dream was only lost

The dream has just begun

The dream has just begun

Well the dream has just begun
She remembers how good it can be
He remembers a melody
Ah in the shadow of my shadow in a gleam
He remembers how good it can be
She remembers a melody
Well in the shadow of my shadow in a gleam

The dream has just begun

Hours of waiting for you

The dream has just begun...

Straight back now

Hours and hours waiting this way
Hours and hours of waiting this way
Straight back
Straight back
Straight back... yeah <start> The Big Bang has created one soul the Universal Migrator. The Universal Migrator
divides itself and each Migrator flies off independently in search of a habitable planet
in order to breathe life into it. I follow the migrator that will eventually reach our
planet Earth.
Russel Allen Damian Wilson
At the birth of time the beginning of beginnings
One cosmic soul was created
A bringer of life a universal migrator
Born to sow its seeds in all the galaxies
Like a cell dividing it spreads in all directions
Creating life among the stars
I'm struck with awe as I join the great migrator
Now it takes flight to the brightest star of all
On a quest for life through the sable skies
What a show behold
The dawn of a million souls
On a bold crusade in the realm of shade
What a show behold
The dawn of a million souls
Through the glowing mist like a fog of radiation
I can see the forming of new planets
I've been struck by thunder as I witness all the splendor
And I realize how small we really are
Ooh I can see forever
On the wings of dreams I fly
Is this real or is it just a fantasy
What awaits me now at the end of this ride <start> Oh hi Is Miss Otis in
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today madam
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today mmm
And she's sorry to be delayed
But last evening down at lover's lane
She strayed madam
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today
When she woke up and found
That her dream of love was gone madam
She ran to the man who had lead her so far astray
And from under her velvet gown
She drew a gun and shot her lover down madam
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today
When the mob came and got her
And dragged her from the jail madam
They strung her up on the willow across the way
And the moment before she died
She lifted up her lovely head and cried madam <start> I'm irresponsible
I'm irrational
What are you gonna do
And if it's in my head
And if I'm just paranoid
Well I guess it's just jealousy
When it comes to you
But you'll never guess
It's like exercising
When I try to disguise it
I avoid your eyes
You'll never know
Inside I can't stand it at all
When every word is a lie
But I go through it all
Lies are just exercises
And I can't help myself
Cause I've always lied to myself
I've had to fake so many things
What are you gonna do
And if you see though it all
And I can't excuse myself
I think I need your help to see me through
What are you gonna do
Lies are just exercises <start> Don't you know that one day you'll be found out
Faulty explanations changing colors all breed doubt
You push your thoughts away from the day when you must pay
When the storm becomes a blizzard don't play dead like a lizard
Pull it out wash it off
With the blade of deception sheathed the wounds can heal
Though you like the darker climes they shade you from the real
Don't pull it off cut it off
A game is fair when the players abide by the rules
You speak with forked tongue and cast yourself the fool
There's something slightly saurian in the structure of your skin
Your conscience is well padded your reasoning is thin
So you put your prayers away until the hunt when you're the prey
On that darkest judgment night the ledger books will be set right
Pull it out wash it off
With the blade of deception sheathed the wounds can heal
Though you like the darker climes they shade you from the real
Don't pull it off cut it off
A game is fair when the players abide by the rules
You speak with forked tongue and cast yourself the fool
Watch your tail
You're headed for a tailspin
Approaching danger cuts the water like a shark's fin
Don't you know that one day you'll be found out
The changing colors
Something slightly saurian in the structure of your skin <start> Let it burn in your eyes your cover is blown this time and you know
But you know this was gonna happen and you could taste the red hands
And like the flies you'll eat the worst of everything
But you know this was gonna happen you could taste the red hands
But you needed this
You needed this
You needed this
You needed this
There's a glossary of dirty words for people just like you
And only for people like you I reserve the words
Backstabbers and money whores and dirty rotten millionaires
That always wanted more
Pull the wool on my eyes like a crooked burnt out saint
I believed and soaked in every word you said
Always tasting red hands but the fight never ended and we're all here
Singing loud for revolution and sitting battles out
But you needed this
You needed this
You needed this
You needed this
There's a glossary of dirty words for people just like you
And only for people like you I reserve the words
Backstabbers and money whores and dirty rotten millionaires
That always wanted more
And it's sick outside but I'm trying to keep you alive
And it's sick outside but I'm trying to keep you alive
And it's sick outside but I'm trying to keep you alive
There's a glossary of dirty words for people just like you
And only for people like you I reserve the words
Backstabbers and money whores and dirty rotten millionaires
That always wanted more
And all fingers are pointing right at you
And all fingers are pointing right at you
And all fingers are pointing right at you
But I burned this down for you <start> One look sends it coursing through the veins oh how the feeling races
Back up to their brains to form expressions on there stupid faces
They don't want to say hello
Like I want to say hello
Oh the heartbeats at its peak when you're coming up to speak
And I'm so tense never tenser
Could all go a bit frank spencer
I'm talking gibberish tip of the tongue but I can't deliver it
Properly oh it's all getting on top of me
And if it weren't this dark you'd see how red my face has gone
Everybody's trying to crack the jokes and that to make you smile
Those that claim that they're not showing off are drowning in denial
They're not half as bad as me say anything and I'll agree
'Cause when it comes to acting up I'm sure I could write the book
And now that you're more than a part in the play
It's slightly easier to think what to say
You had us all standing on our heads
Doing our best tricks
Never again
Never again will there be another one that's as desirable as you
One look sends it coursing through the veins oh how the feeling races
Back up to their brains to form expressions on there stupid faces <start> Hi I'm an ordinary organism
And I was kinda linging the walls
In a warzone slamdance backbeat
Poison and meandering
I hear the little voice say
Oh baby are you all alone
I get ready for the dangerous behavior
I feel the pull of my genetic code
Sometimes what you see
Makes you holler for your saviour
Especially the babies
All set to explode
I look up past the jewelery
The ecstasy the insanity
I count the knives
Count the teeth in her smile
People are just animals
Angry hungry
They falter for an instant
Then you see the child and you say 
I love you baby
Love you every single little bit
I love your walk your talk
Your smile your style your tits
I love the way you swing that
Circumstance around
You could ask me again
And I would bow down I'd bow down but...
I see you but I don't believe you
I see you but I don't believe you
I see you but I don't believe you
I see you but I don't believe you
I see you but I don't believe you
I see you but I don't believe you
I see you but I don't believe you
Hey I see you but I don't believe you <start> You you got me
Thinking it'll be all right you you told me
Come and take a look inside.
You believed me in every single lie
But I I failed you this time
And it feels like tonight
I can't believe I'm broken inside
Can't you see that there's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight tonight
I was waiting
For the day you'd come around
I was chasing
But nothing was all I found
From the moment you came into my life
You showed me what's right
And it feels like tonight
I can't believe I'm broken inside
Can't you see that there's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight
I never felt like this before
Just when I leave I'm back for more
Nothing else here seems to matter
In these everchanging days
You're the one thing that remains
I could stay like this forever
And it feels like tonight
I can't believe I'm broken inside
Can't you see that there's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight tonight tonight
Cause there's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight tonight <start> Bring on the tequila oh
On fire on tequila oh
My friends and I meet hours before
We make some home made pizza
We do some funny bits back and forth
My knees buckle I laugh so hard
We might end three sheets to wind
And who knows where we'll wind up
All I know is there's a car waiting
And we'll figure that out after
I have to keep my eye
On my old friend from high school
We've known each other for the longest time
She has trouble with her dance so to speak
She can hoist a really good kick
In the butt when she's excited
She doesn't do it so much anymore
'Cause we're all on to her
Bring on the tequila oh
On fire on tequila oh
Mostest most on tequila oh
Bestest friends on tequila oh
Then there's my other pretty friend from high school
The predator in me is put to shame by the predator in her
And now I've reeled it in
It'll be interesting to see how much she's done as well
Then there's my friend from Chicago
God do I love all people from Chicago
All ready to light up the barbecue
And be harping on debauchery
Bring on the tequila oh
On fire on tequila oh
Mostest most on tequila oh
Bestest friends on tequila oh
Then there's my Canadian friend
What a fabulous mom she's become
She's been tortured in this sense
For the last many of months for obvious reasons
She was like Hey where was this part of you
When I wasn't pregnant
I laughed and did a shot in her honor
As I conversed with her belly
Bring on the tequila oh
On fire on tequila oh
Mostest most on tequila oh
Bestest friends on tequila oh
Then there's my Cupid friend
She sure knows how to dress that one
She's a wise and worldly girl
But you gotta watch that medication
My favorite beverage is taken
To a whole other level on it
I'm not worried about it
Or I'll coast around the room
While I trust she'll temper
My brother came to visit me
And now he's used to hanging with me and cracking up
But he had no idea about my built up tolerance
No idea about how manipulative I've become
I would surreptitiously put it in front of him
Without him asking
In a pretty little shot glass
His smirk and cackle would only egg me on
Bring on the tequila oh
On fire on tequila oh
Mostest most on tequila oh
Bestest friends on tequila oh <start> When you're on your own
When you're at a fork in the road
You don't know which way to go
There's too many suns in our rows
You haven't laughed in a while
When you can't even fake a smile
When you feel ashamed
The uniform don't make you brave
Chorus
All I can do is love you to pieces
Give you a shoulder to cry when you need it
When the day is long and the night is coming down on you
All I can do
All I can do
All I can do...
When you forget your name
And the pleasure can't disguise your pain
And you don't feel the same
I won't forget the love you made
Chorus
What a lovely day to shape your dreams
And you don't even have to sleep
You can make it what you want to be
You can fly away
You can change your name
You can have a happy face
It can be so real
Oh
Chorus
Is all that I can do <start> Everybody's doin'
What they shouldn't be doin'
Everybody's doin' it
In the middle of the street
Everybody's movin'
What they shouldn't be movin'
Everybody's movin' it in the middle of the street
Improper dancing in the middle of the street

Everybody's showin' it in the middle of the street
Improper dancing in the middle of the street
Improper dancing in the middle of the street
Improper dancing in the middle of the street
Man those ppl must have demons livin in their feet
And I want to reach into the fire of your heart
I want to program all those beats right from the start
Have you ever been to New York City
And music starts to play 
Bodies start to sway 
Debbielee's the dj in the middle of the street
Beats are droppin'
Bodies rockin'
Hearts are stoppin'
Electric shockin'

On a moonjet from out of bound
Try to relax
When my church runs me out of town
Fathom a chance
To behold what you never knew
I'm coming around
And I won't be leaving
Say you can say you will
Turn a fourletter self regret
Hold the hand that holds your fate
But don't let it lead you on
Right or wrong I lie in the bed I make
On and on I lie in the bed I make
Needed a shove
To believe in a jagged edge
The sentiment of
A self centered wonder man
I'm coming unglued
Oh I couldn't be more obvious
Say you can say you knew
Your sincerity bathed in doubt
All you loved and all you knew
Time let it lead you on
Here in the rough
Where a crowd still attracts a crowd
Try to relax...

So open up your eyes
And you can get some sleep when you are dead
Kill the clock inside your head
Bring your normalcy to the edge
And watch it drown in new horizons
New horizons
You said I'd only have to wait until I died
And that's no time
How did we come to think that this was funny
Cheering and laughing at the dying
While we've been riding the light in you
Wait
You said I'd only have to wait until I die

There is no such thing as time
Inside this moment no sun rising
Wait until I fly

Wait until I fly

Sin with a conquest
Life floods in with a new quest
Here's a voice for the voiceless
And a song for the soulless
Life floods in
Wait
You said I'd only have to wait until I die

There is no such thing as time
Inside this moment no sun rising
Wait until I fly

Wait until I fly

When the times keep going wrong and we go right
When the times keep going wrong and we go right
Wait
You said I'd only have to wait until I die

There is no such thing as time
Inside this moment no sun rising
Wait until I fly

Wait until I fly

Wait until I fly

There is no such thing as time
Inside this moment no sun rising
Wait until I fly
When the times keep going wrong and we go right
We go right <start> Gazed at the ceiling from below
A splendid Michelangelo
Filled my heart with delight
Last Saturday night
Arrived believing from home
Climbed every step inside St. Peter's Dome
Claustrophobic and exCatholic
Last Saturday night
Now how come nobody really noticed
Puff of white smoke knocked me out
The truth is hiding lurking banking
Things they do at night
It's quite suspicious to say the least
Even mentioned it to my local priest
One Our Father three Hail Marys
Each Saturday Night
I wish somebody would tell me
That it's only a show
I'll confess own up let's face it
In my concrete tuxedo
It's quite suspicious to say the least
While mentioning it to my priest
One Our Father three Hail Marys
Each Saturday night
One Our Father three Hail Marys
Each Saturday night
One Our Father three Hail Marys
Each Saturday night <start> You would have loved who I used to be
Yesterday I would have hated the boy you see
When you found me I was at my worst
The best I was is a long forgotten curse.
You caught me one the way down
Please hold my hand before I drown
Tie my hands before I burn this town
You caught me on the way down
I feel like a shell of yester years gone by
Bad decisions like ghosts that just won't die
I'm so sorry that I can't apologize
What comes next is another long goodbye
You caught me on the way down 
Please hold my hand so I don't drown
Tie my hands before I burn this town
You caught me on the way down.
You caught me on the way down 
Please hold my hand so I don't drown
Tie my hands before I burn this town
You caught me on the way down.
You caught me on the way down
Please hold my hand before I drown
Tie my hands before I burn this town
You caught me on the way down. <start> It's Friday night and I can
Just talk for hours and hours
'Til I wake up and wonder
Where the time went
When you were the one I loved
You were the one I loved
You were the one I loved
You were the one I loved
You were the one I loved
You were the one I loved
I loved
Now lock your doors and chain up
All of your mixed emotions
'Cause they will come and get you
Just when you don't
'Cause you were the one I loved
You were the one I loved
You were the one I loved
You were the one I loved
You were the one I loved
You were the one I loved
You just look around and wonder why
You've wondered so long so hard and you're still wrong
I'd have taken you back I'd have taken you back
When you were the one I loved
So we've been through the motions
And suffer these delusions
I'll dream away my sorrows
On through the night
'Cause you were the one I loved
You were the one I loved
You were the one I loved
You were the one I loved
You were the one I loved
You were the one I loved
I loved <start> My time to think
All that I need
My time to think
Never again  found my calling
Never again
It will not pull me down
Flesh over bone
Cut and bleeding
My frozen will
Never again  purge on my blood
Never again
I feel it all
Numb to nothing  feel it all
Stand in my own
Cut and bleeding
I feel it all <start> I've this passion
It's something I can't describe
It's so electric
It's like I've just come alive
I feel this freedom
Now that my past is erased
I feel the healing
I found the meaning of grace

If only you could see me yesterday
Who I used to be before the change
You'd see a broken heart
You'd see the battle scars
It's funny how the words can't explain how good it feels to finally break the chains
I'm not what I have done
I'm what I've overcome
I know I stumble
I know I still face defeat
These second chances with define me
I'm moving forward
I'm standing on my two feet
I've got momentum
I've got someone saving me

If only you could see me yesterday
Who I used to be before the change
You'd see a broken heart
You'd see the battle scars
It's funny how the words can't explain how good it feels to finally break the chains
I'm not what I have done
I'm what I've overcome
I'll make mistakes
And I might fall
But I won't break
I've got someone saving me
If only you could see me yesterday
Who I used to be before the change
You'd see a broken heart
You'd see the battle scars
It's funny how the words can't explain how good it feels to finally break the chains
I'm not what I have done
I'm what I've overcome
I'm what I've overcome
I'm what I've overcome <start> Love won't remember me
It's been so long
And that's what I've told myself
But you proved me wrong
You opened up my eyes
And helped me to see
That love has a way of finding
Those in need
Love has remembered me 
It seems too long since we've been together
Love has remembered me 
It's been so long seemingly forever
Love has remembered love has remembered me
I felt so all alone
And at times afraid
That love had forsaken me
It just seemed that way
Then you walked into my life
And you turned my whole world around
Ours is a true love
It can't be found
Love has remembered me 
It seems too long since we've been together
Love has remembered me 
It's been so long seemingly forever
The love has remembered love has remembered me
Love won't remember me
It's been so long
And that's what I've told myself
But you proved me wrong
Love has remembered me 
It seems too long since we've been together
Love has remembered me 
It's been so long seemingly forever
Love has remembered me 
It seems too long since we've been together
The love has remembered me 
It's been so long seemingly forever
Love has remembered
Love has remembered
Love has remembered
 <start>  <start> Radio was playing
I was knocked out on the floor
Staring at the floor boards
She kicked me to the floor
I said to myself
This ain't no way to have fun
Then she looked me in the eye and said
Your life has just begun
Now I want some water not some whiskey
I want some water in this cup
Don't tell me of your fortunes
Then wish me best of luck
I've seen that face before
In a million magazines
All beauty on the outside
And the inside's just as clean
Then she say Love it's just not enough
Then she say Love it's just not enough
Now the telephone's been ringing
And I'm knocking at her door
Standing in the hall she say
I've seen that face before
Now I don't want to own her
I just come for some more
No I don't want to own her
I just come for some more of that
Love it's just not enough
Love it's just not enough
Love it's just not enough
Love it's just not enough
So when the sky's ain't blue
And stars don't shine
And everything ain't right
You go walking down that hallway
See the girl from paradise
Now you won't want to own her
You'll just sit you'll want to cry
No you won't want to own her
You'll just sit and wonder why
This love it's just not enough
This love it's just not enough
She say Love it's just never enough
Love it's just not enough

Rock on pop <start> I walked with you
Just like we've done for so long
You seemed so near
But even that's become so common
It's not just you just been together so long
That I thought I knew everything about you
But today I saw did you open up my eyes
'Cause I feel like I've just seen you for the first time
Chorus
I didn't see you
But God I want to
You've come alive
And I think I've fallen harder than the first time
Was I so blind how did I not see you
Yet in all that time you never left my side
So for all my life I will live to know you
So here I am I'll take your hand
Chorus
I see your face I feel you close
The love you've always shown me
Won't miss it now can't waste a day
Jesus I'm yours completely
Chorus <start> ' Static Feedback and Noise '  the Casualties
sick sick sick  of the music of today
sick sick sick  we need a fucking change
sick sick sick  their groups are such a waste
sick sick sick  I need anger in my brain
Listen to the sound of the poets of today
all on tour right clothes no heart and soul
the ones on top don't care about you
the ones on the bottom they'll use you to get rich
you  star on tv you're fucking hell to me
you  in the underground your head got too big
you  two of a kind what a fucking waste of time
raise my finger in the airI'll show you how
it's done
Noise  Give me static and feedback
sick sick sick  of the music of today
sick sick sick  we need a fucking change
sick sick  their groups are such a waste
sick sick sick  I need anger in my brain
Listen to the sound of the poets of today
all on tour right clothes no heart and soul
the ones on top don't care about you
the ones on the bottom they'll use you to get rich
you  star on tv you're fucking hell to me
you  in the underground your head got too big
you  two of a kind what a fucking waste of time
raise my finger in the airI'll show you how

Noise  Give me static and feedback
Bring back the old days of The Ramones
Bring back those fast two minute songs
give me that two fingers in the air
cause punk is back and is back to stay
You  The rebels with the fucking ripped up clothes
you  can't follow any leader or any cause
you  that shouts and sweats at every show
raise your finger in the air and show them how
its done <start> Who deserves a pretty tangle dream
Green hillside hands inside hands
I lay before you like unclaimed land
You drove your bulldozer over
Wrote your name in the sand
I am new watch the smoke move through
You've got this world and the wine in your hand
So you drink it down then you look at me
And offer me some watered down potion
Eau de toilette of devotion
Tell me you've been saving it for me
Tell me you've been saving it for me
Who deserves a pretty tangle dream
Green hillside hands inside hands
I lay before you like unclaimed land
Clear economic potential
You hung yourself in the sky frozen blue
My smile a tattoo you're happy happy with what you've created
Tell me to choose like some big suit tycoon
Go on drink it down
Look at me and offer me some watered down potion
Eau de toilette of devotion
Tell me you've been saving it for me
Tell me you've been saving it for me
You used to shine I can't find where you drink it down
Yeah look at me offer me a watered down potion
Eau de toilette of devotion
Drink it down
Look at me and offer me a watered down potion
Eau de toilette of devotion
Tell me you've been saving it for me
Tell me you've been saving it for me <start> When the night's quiet and you don't care anymore
And your eyes are tired and there's someone at your door
And you realize you want to let go
And the weak lies in cold walls you embrace you
At your insides and baby I ain't no liar I walk
Streets of fire
Streets of fire
Streets of fire
Streets of fire
Now I'm wandering a loser down the tracks
An' I'm lyin' but babe I can't go back
'Cause in the darkness I hear somebody call my name
And when you realize how they tricked you this time
And it's all lies but I'm strung out on the wire in these
Streets of fire
Streets of fire
Streets of fire
I live now only with strangers
I talk to only strangers
I walk with angels that have no place
And don't look at my face
Don't come to my place
'Cause I'm strung out on my wire cross
Streets of fire
Streets of fire
Streets of fire
Streets of fire oh yeah <start> We watched the season pull up its own stage
And catch the last weekend of the last week
Before the gold and the glimmer have been replaced
Another sun soaked season fades away
You have stolen my heart
You have stolen my heart
Invitation only grant farewells
Crash the best one of the best ones
Clear liquor and cloudy eyed too early to say goodnight
You have stolen my heart
You have stolen my heart
And from the ballroom floor we are a celebration
One good stretch before our hibernation
Our dreams assured and we are we'll sleep well
Sleep well
Sleep well
Sleep well
You have stolen my you have stolen my
You have stolen my heart
I watch you spin around in the highest heels
You are the best one of the best ones
We all look like we feel
You have stolen my you have stolen my
You have stolen my heart <start> Just before the lights went out
We sat up and talked about
All the things that we would be
I just wanted him to be with me
But he had a mind of his own
And he did not mind being alone
Left me there in our little world
Left me there like a little girl
He said don't get hung up
Hang ups will get you down
He said don't look back
Look up and then look around
That time I was feeling high
Like I never had to try
To kick myself up out of bed
Kick these worries out of my head
He said it's better this way yeah
One day you'll understand
He said I'm leavin' today and
He let go of my hand
I know that I'll never see him again
I feel the same way that I saw him then
I know that when I get back on my feet
I will walk away from misery
What do you say when it's all been said
How do you feel when it's all been felt
Where do you go when it's all gone
And you don't care enough to carry on
Well I say close your eyes
Look down deep inside
Someone is there for you
Someone who cares for you
Well I know it's easier to say then do
Easier to look away than see it through
I know it's easier to think than feel
Easier to make it up than make it real
Oh it's hard to love
Oh it's hard not to love
Oh it's hard to love
Oh it's hard not to love
Oh now take me there don't leave me here
Oh now take me there don't leave me here
Oh now take me home and disappear
Oh oh oh no no no no no no <start> I want to smoke crack

We're in a terrible mess
It's been so long since I've been home
Since I've had fun
I'm coming home
I'll be there soon

My retreat's in my head
Take back those things that you said

But I'm staying sane instead

I'll keep a smile 'til my last breath
I've loved 'til I've lost
I've lived how I felt
One day I will find peace within myself
Boyish grin it bears me well
Where can I begin
Don't forget I'm still around
How the wind feels free
Behind the smile I fade away
The wayward days are gone
I love this power

I love this power that's crushed so easily
I love this power
I'm not scared of dying

There's a reason to believe we almost got it right
There's a fire burning in the firelight
As we roll on tonight
There's paper promises and alibis
There is certainly uncertainty in all our eyes
But as long as you are here I'll be all right
As we roll on tonight
So you go out I'll go on
If there's a doubt we'll be strong
As we go on singing
One more for love my love
One more for love
There's always blood to fill the heart betrayed
There are children being born to every house that's raised
And we're getting closer to where we got it made
As we roll on tonight
So you go out I'll go on
If there's a doubt we'll be strong
As we go on singing
One more for love my love
One more for love
I'm never going to wait for anything
Never going to break for anything
Cause I am one more for love my love
One more for love
One more for love my love

And what do you get for your pain
Its how you live this life in danger
Your always on the go
Still only scars remain
Well its been so long since I have tried
Yea its been so long since I have cried
So life goes on
Yea its been so long
Yea its been so long sice I've felt the pain
Well I'm movin east bound on the west bound train
So life goes on
Its been so long
I try to do what is right now
I don't try to do what is wrong
The lies of guilt are comin out now
And I sit here alone
And sing another song
Just take a look in the miror
And tell me what do you see
Down play the croud to the guily
And make believe and make believe you don't need me <start> I hide me far away from trouble
The world outside me grows darker by the day
So I promise to stay here close beside You
Surely God would want His children safe
Then in reading how my eyes were opened
I find that He is leading us out into the world
Into the middle of fallen saints and sinners
Where a little grace is needed most
Come take the Light to darker parts
Share His truth with hardened hearts
We are not like the world but we can love it
Come bring the hope to hopeless men
Until the lost are found in Him
He came to save the world so let us be
In it not of it
Wait a minute
If we say we love them why are we not in it
Why we run and hide
Entertain a stranger
Maybe entertain an angel
The danger is if our worlds don't collide
We've cursed the darkness far too long
We need to hold the candle high
We have to go and right the wrongs
We need to touch the world with love <start> Smooth like a rolling crystal ball
Heading for a sideline straight towards the fall
No one will get through
No one will get through at all
The night sky illuminates it all
Like a distant firefight always orchestral
The sun is coming soon
Just to pass by you by you
And I will hide myself away
Save all these people for another day
And I will hide myself away
Just to spite them all for another day
The moon comes down on me again
Soon this lonely dream now slowly will begin
Giving me this pain
This paralyzing pain again
The night sky illuminates it all
Like a distant firefight always orchestral
And time is coming soon
Just to pass by you pass by you
And I will hide myself away
Save all of these people for another day
And I will hide myself away
Just to spite them all for another day yeah
Smooth like a rolling crystal ball
Heading for a sideline straight towards the fall
No one will get through
No one will get through at all
And I will hide myself away
Save all of these people for another day
And I will hide myself away
Just to spite them all for another day
And I will hide myself away
Much to the chagrin of everyone this day
And I am not much a friend this way
No I'm not fit to wear that hat today <start> ' <start> There is a place it has a face and he was walking out the door
His mother said she was ashamed 'cause he had no place to go
He was afraid and I was fine he wanted piece of mind
Three times done and you gone and you're gone
You are free you are free it's a long way home
What have we done was it wrong is it wrong
Is it me Can't you see it's a long way home
There is a snake he will awake and he will get you off the floor
You'll start to shake your friends will sweat you are high you will forget
She is afraid 'cause you are dying but you have got your piece of mind
Three times done and you're gone and you're gone
You are free you are free it's a long way home
What have we done was it was it wrong is it wrong
Is it me Can't you see it's a long way home
And I won't make your dreams come true it's all you
You've got to change your lonely ways to make it through
You found a place in outer space and it won't hurt anymore
Your lovely hand has slipped away and there is nothing left to say
And you were born of yellow sand there is no plan there is no end
Three times done and you're gone and you're gone
You are free you are free it's a long way home
All night long I was wrong I was wrong
It was me can't you see it's a long way home <start> Can't take it with you
Everybody knows
Can't take it with you when you go
Can't hide your love away
Save it up for a rainy day
Ya can't take it with you when you go
Play it high or low
Break the bank in Monte Carlo
You can play it just the way it falls
Cut it like you want to
But it just might come back and haunt you
Lady Luck's your mama when she calls
Can't take it with you everybody knows
Can't take it with you when you go
Can't hide your love away save it up for a rainy day
You can't take it with you when you go
Hotwire a fast car just to take a ride
You can run but you sure cannot hide
Oh tell her a lie
And live with it 'til you die
But you can't take it with you when you go
And it hurts so bad when you finally have to show
Can't take it with you everybody knows
Can't take it with you when you go
Can't hide your love away save it up for a rainy day
You can't take it with you when you go
Can't take it with you when you go
Can't take it with you when you go <start> Don't don'tthat's what you say
Each time that I hold you this way
When I feel like this and I want to hold you
Baby don't say don't
Don't don't leave my embrace
For here in my arms is your place
When the night grows cold and I want to hold you
Baby don't say don't
If you think that this is just a game
I'm playing
If you think that I don't mean
Every word I'm saying
Don't don't don't don't
Don't feel that way
I'm your love and yours I will stay
This you can believe
I will never leave you
Heaven knows I won't
Baby don't say don't <start> When your friends all kill you put your cannon on the line.
Doing the last chaseryour already ripe.
Fear not the link from the chain.
It's o.k.  it's all in the game.
chorus
Gotta bad case of love
Bad case of love
Bad case of love
Cut off relations 'cause you can't get enough.
When you turn on gods speed children of the night.
You know I'll be watching 'cause I'm already tight.
Too many to charm so many dreams.
Going home alone I don't know what you mean.
chorus
Gotta bad case of love
Bad case of love
Bad case of love
Down to the canyon 'cause you can't get enough.
You can face off like a child God don't understand.
The moon falls  she loves another man.
She's got all the weapons you know you're gonna lose.
Don't let it tear you better start singing your blues.
chorus
Gotta bad case of love
Bad case of love
Bad case of love
Don't rush the colors 'cause you can't get enough <start> No me llames cario no necesito caridad
Ya no somos unos cros ya est todo dicho
Que cada uno siga su camino
Cada uno en su lugar
Cuando buscaba tu boca el viento se llevaba mis besos
Se estrellaban contra una roca de obsidiana pura
Dejndome el alma rota llenndome de amargura
Cuando buscaba tus manos quedaba solo en la pista
Me apartabas de tu lado el baile era con otro
Como si fuera un extrao
Ahora no te conozco
No me llames cario no necesito caridad
Ya no somos unos cros ya est todo dicho
Que cada uno siga su camino
Cada uno en su lugar
Cuando buscaba consuelo t no me escuchabas
Nunca era el momento para mis depresiones
Demasiados lamentos demasiadas discusiones
No me llames cario no necesito caridad
Ya no somos unos cros ya est todo dicho
Que cada uno siga su camino
Cada uno en su lugar
Cada uno en su lugar
No me llames cario
Ten caridad <start> It's  AM and I'm waiting
for the coffee perculating
in the kettle in the back
And there's no use getting all upset
about who is degrading who
when there is hockey on the set
Chorus
There's two cops in Tim Hortons
and I'm just another shit to them
maybe I'm just a good for nothing
but did I have to hear it again
And they got two blue and whites
parked in the back well out of sight
in the hopes that I won't see
And maybe I'm getting older
a little more fat and slower
but is there any other way to be
Not like I had better things to do
they're just wasting my time
And now there's no use getting all upset
about whos degrading who
When there's crullers to be had.
Honey glazed and jelly filled
Those chocolate sprinkles really fit the bill
And won't it make those pigboys mad <start> Written by bob welch.
The swamp is getting deeper all the time
And the faces that I see don't seem to shine
Now there's too much warhol hanging off the wall
And the mystery that there used to be is gone
Let me go
Miles away
Let me ride
Just miles away
Don't wanna know
I'm not gonna miss it much
Gonna be drivin' once again
Don juan goes up in a cloud of smoke
And all those hare krishnas turned out to be a joke
And it's restless restless restless all the time
Slidin' up and down the surface of this life
Now I know that I can't say what's black and white
But if I could fly I think I'd try tonight <start> Forever alone until I found you and now you're always there
Voice on the air scent on my clothes
Oh but when the sun exposes all my demons
Will you stay or run away
I'll help you find your way every moment you're awake
You know I'll stay even in your dreams
I'll pull the stars down from the heavens to fill your empty skies
I'm yours tonight I'm yours tonight
Whenever you go they say I'm bad news when everyone agrees
Whispers start sounding like screams
Oh but I know what you want to say before the words escape your teeth
Will you trust in me
I'll help you find your way every moment you're awake
You know I'll stay even in your dreams
I'll pull the stars down from the heavens to fill your empty skies
I'm yours tonight I'm yours tonight
My good intentions can leave the hardest hearts
The harshest scars you've ever seen
My bad impressions they will follow me
Makin' enemies that I can't see
Forever alone till I found you
I know that you'll stay you won't run away
I'll help you find your way every moment you're awake
You know I'll stay even in your dreams
I'll pull the stars down from the heavens to fill your empty skies
I'm yours tonight
I'll help you find your way every moment you're awake
You know I'll stay even in your dreams
I'll pull the stars down from the heavens to fill your empty skies
I'm yours tonight I'm yours tonight <start> Seen you round I know your face
Watched you try to grow up with grace
Seen that heart out on your sleeve
Like it's so much life you're dying to feel dying to feel
'Cause if you got to steal you've got to steal the show
It's the spirit of the underdog
And if you got to break you've got to break the mould
It's the spirit of the underdog
I've seen you reach that main event
And make it look like an accident
Your need for love can't be replaced
Just put away at least for today at least for today
'Cause if you got to steal you've got to steal the show
It's the spirit of the underdog
And if you got to break you've got to break the mould
It's the spirit of the underdog <start> On sticks and sand lost my money lost my hands
Blood on my brain too much salt in my veins
And I thought pain was clean
And I thought hearts were strong
But bones aren't sticks anymore
And a day is far too long
So many days never needing any grace
Live for kicks and danger there'd be beauty anyway
And I thought pain was clean
And I thought hearts were strong
But bones aren't sticks anymore
And a day is far too long x <start> Times were tough love was not enough
So you said sorry Johnny I'm gone gone gone
You said my act was funny
But we both knew what was missing honey
So you let out on your own
Now that pretty form that you've got baby
Will make sure you get along
But you're gonna find out someday honey
When you're alone you're alone
When you're alone you're alone
When you're alone you're alone
When you're alone you ain't nothing but alone
Now I was young and pretty on the mean streets of the city
And I fought to make 'em my home
With just the shirt on my back I left and swore I'd never look back
And man I was gone gone gone
But there's things that'll knock you down you don't even see coming
And send you crawling like a baby back home
You're gonna find out that day sugar
When you're alone you're alone
When you're alone you're alone
When you're alone you're alone
When you're alone you ain't nothing but alone
I knew some day your runnin' would be through
And you'd think back on me and you
And your love would be strong
You'd forget all the bad and think only of all the laughs that we had
And you'd want to come home
Now it ain't hard feelings or nothin' sugar
That ain't what's got me singing this song
It's just nobody knows baby where love goes
But when it goes it's gone gone
When you're alone you're alone
When you're alone you're alone
When you're alone you're alone
When you're alone you ain't nothing but alone <start> And I am the sun
I rise above the world
And when the light goes out
I kill another child
And I am insane
I crawl into your mouth
I grow like a flower
I grow a suicide
And I am the sun
And I am the light
And I am the sun
Yeah I am the light
And I am the dog
I cut out my eyes
Yeah I will nullify
My true love creation

A place I've never been
I'm dying to meet you here
Come break this skin
I'll let you sink right in
And show you everything
See you in hell
See you in hell
We'll gather around the fire
And I will lead the choir
Sing farewell
See you in hell
Come break my spell
Well down the wishing well
We'll find some time to kill
I'll be right there
The buzz inside your head
The whole electric chair
See you in hell
We'll gather round the fire
And I don't need the choir
Sing farewell
See you in hell <start> Work all day come back home
Get a little older
I don't feel like I belong
Tell me when it's over
This comfort I wait for you

Try and break my routine
It's harder than it looks like
Drowning in monotony
Thinking that I'm alright
This comfort I wait for you
This comfort I
Can I embrace a moment with you
Cam I embrace a moment with you
No I missed my chance a thousand times before
I'll tell you why I'm gonna miss no more
Told me once told me twice
There will be a reward
Listened to your advice
Not a lot to record
This comfort I wait for you
This comfort I
Can I embrace a moment with you

No I don't need a lifetime a moment will do

For I missed my chance a thousand times before

And I'll tell you why I'm gonna miss no more
No more

I tell you why
I'm gonna miss no more <start> Stop and look around everyone's sick in this town.
Plagued with apathy walking through life aimlessly.
Crawling on the ground they're tired of getting knocked down.
Their face is badly burned the rescuers haven't returned.
Who will help me out
I can't do this on my own.
Is anybody reaching out
Does anybody care
We could be the ones. 
We could be the ones. 
If you want them to change  they will.
If you give everything  they will.
We could be the ones. 
Lonely and confused.
Hurt broken scared and abused.
Angry at the world
They never know who to turn to.
So everyone who knows the truth please lend a hand.
The opportunity may never come again.
We could be the ones. 
We could be the ones. 
If you want them to change  they will.
If you give everything  they will.
We could be the ones. 
Is anybody reaching out
Let your love come quickly.
We can't ever let them slip away
Because every soul is waiting.
We can't let them go no.
Does anybody care
We could be the ones. 
We could be the ones. 
If you want them to change  they will.
If you give everything  they will.
We could be the ones.  <start> Shiny shiny shiny boots of leather
Whiplash girlchild in the dark
Comes in bells your servant don't forsake him
Strike dear mistress and cure his heart
Downy sins of streetlight fancies
Chase the costumes she shall wear
Ermine furs adorn imperious
Severin Severin awaits you there
I am tired I am weary
I could sleep for a thousand years
A thousand dreams that would awake me
Different colors made of tears
Kiss the boot of shiny shiny leather
Shiny leather in the dark
Tongue of thongs the belt that does await you
Strike dear mistress and cure his heart
Severin Severin speak so slightly
Severin down on your bended knee
Taste the whip in love not given lightly
Taste the whip now plead for me
I am tired I am weary
I could sleep for a thousand years
A thousand dreams that would awake me
Different colors made of tears
Shiny shiny shiny boots of leather
Whiplash girlchild in the dark
Severin your servant comes in bells please don't forsake him
Strike dear mistress and cure his heart <start> In an empty cinema 
When your old friends drift apart 
Wandering round the house in the dark 
Faded glory of a broken star 
Loneliness
Loneliness
What would I do without you
Stays around won't let you be 
Corners me in deadend streets 
To bring unwanted memories 
That find their way into my blood stream 
Loneliness
Loneliness
What would I do without you
Loneliness
Loneliness
Is this all you have to give me
Your love is a place for a lonely man
With too much in his head
The liars and thieves who cramp your style
Won't be there for your last breath
Be there for your last breath
Loneliness
Loneliness
What would I do without you
Loneliness
Loneliness
Is this all you have to give me
To give me

She looks out of her window at the people passing by they look so happy make's her cry
She watches them laughing sees the lovers holding hands and everyone each others friends
Beautiful and blue they're not as good as you
Beautiful and blue they're lonely too
She feels so unhappy she no longer cares for life and is close to ending all her strives
The world doesn't know her it's so hard and cold and cruel she wonders why she's such a fool
Beautiful and blue

To another world
Still stranded somewhere
In between the earth and sky

Your longdistance love is coming through alright
And I'm not lonely
Lost in the Orient
I'm dreamin' of
Turn around in Tokyo
Gotta send it back to you
Turn around in Tokyo
Well I feel like a stranger
In a modern land
Outside the sky light stands like a Buddha shrine
And on the east horizon there's complete design
It's the quiet hours of darkness before the light
The words don't come easy
Lost in the Orient
I miss you
Turn around in Tokyo
Gotta make it back to you
Turn around in Tokyo

Foolish from the start

And the world just falls apart
And there's no cure for this disease
I'm making up so whats the fuss
I live inside this
Head and I'm at war
Hero and villain
Same type keeping score
And I'm not sure what I'm to do
Inside these walls not anymore
With my own life
Get off the island
And swim back to shore
Girl I don't think I could last here one second longer
'Cause in these waters I'm done for
Now give me one good reason to stay here at all
When the fee is too big our apartment's too small
Where's my life saver
When I'm screaming danger
I'm screaming danger
Get off the island
And swim back to shore
I'm just a victim
Of unfortunate circumstance
And this was my choice
So shit well I'll be damned
And I got to stop dwelling on
What I could have had
All the times I could of
Oh I just want to
Get off the island
And swim back to shore
Girl I don't think I could last here one second longer
'Cause in these waters I'm done for
Now give me one good reason to stay here at all
When the fee is too big our apartment's too small
Where's my life saver
When I'm screaming danger

 from your sand I'll float away
 and never see you around again

Hope you have a lot of nice things to wear
But then a lot of nice things turn bad out there
Oh baby baby it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Oh baby baby it's a wild world
I'll always remember you like a child girl
You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do
And it's breaking my heart in two
'Cause I never want to see you sad girl
Don't be a bad girl
But if you want to leave take good care
Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware

So I am pissing in the yard
I have to laugh when I think how far it's gone
But things aren't funny any more
I drew a line into the dirt
And dared her to step right across it
And she did
So I am knocking on the door again
I say Do you want to be alone
She says No I don't wanna be alone
But I think that you do.
I drew a line into the dirt
And dared her to step right across it
And she did
And I know she's right
I know how it would be
If I had my own way with the world
As I know it should be
She locked herself in the bathroom again
So I've been shutting down the lights
And I don't know if I'll ever go back again
I'm drivin' straight into the night
I drew a line into the dirt
And dared her to step right across it
And she did <start> She stood on the tracks
Waving her arms
Leading me to that third rail SHOCK
Quick as a wink
She changed her mind
She gave me a night
Thats all it was
What will it take until I STOP
Kidding myself wasting my time whoa
Theres nothing else I can do
Cause Im doing it All For Leyna
I dont want anyone new
Cause Im living it All For Leyna
Theres nothing in it for you
Cause Im giving it all to Leyna
We laid on the beach
Watching the tide
She didnt tell me there were ROCKS
Under the waves
Right off the shore
Washed up on the sand
Barely alive
Wishing the undertow would STOP
How can a man take anymore whoa
Theres nothing else I can do
Cause Im doing it All For Leyna
I dont want anyone new
Cause Im living it All For Leyna
Theres nothing in it for you
Cause Im giving it all to Leyna
Im failing in school
Loosing my friends
Making my family loose their minds
I dont want to eat
I dont want to sleep
I only want Leyna one more time
Now Im in my room
Watching the tube
Telling myself she still may DROP
Over to say shes changed her mind
So I wait in the dark
Listening for her
Instead of hearing my old man saying STOP
Kidding yourself wasting your time
Theres nothing else I can do
Cause Im doing it All For Leyna
I dont want anyone new
Cause Im living it All For Leyna
Theres nothing in it for you
Cause Im giving it all to Leyna

You can jump it from

Only you would ever know again
Live for love but love's all gone
Surround yourself with genius
But the meanness is enough to kill someone
So you learn what you learn
You drink your blessings and you take your pills
You look for something better
So lost your will to save yourself
So the hurt keeps comin
Only you would ever know who was your friend
I know what you need
You need someone to help you tonight
Only when you're here can I feel like this
I put my arms around you
And only when you smile does it hurt like this

Bless my soul one false hope and wisdom there

With love with love so don't be accusing me

I dare you to get close
I dare you to come closer
It's just makin' me sick 
I'm done wasting my time
How can you live like this
I tried to be your friend
But you were fakin'
After everything we've been through
I seized you from yourself
When you had no one else
Now you walk past me like you don't know me
But you wouldn't be alive if you didn't kill me
At night when you had no where else to go
You were dying on the phone
Sick to your stomach on the floor
That night when you had no one else to call
Sick to your stomach on the floor
You were calling me like Doctor doctor doctor
Enjoy living to these expectations
So realize I don't expect a thing
So open up a little so see the riddle
Spent every minute thinking how you used me
Now you walk past me like you don't know me
But you wouldn't be alive if you didn't kill me
At night when you had no where else to go
You were dying on the phone
Sick to your stomach on the floor
That night when you had no one else to call
Sick to your stomach on the floor
You were calling me like Doctor doctor doctor
 You were callin' me like doctor
Welcome to this crappy ending
Seek the opportunity so I assume we should end this
Maybe if we just put this behind us
Take off this blindfold and see how we got dressed
Now you walk past me like you don't know me
Spending your nights out with all my homies
Maybe if you just cut out your ego
Sever the tattoo giving you reason
Many last nights you asked me nice
But your world won't break so your grasp I'll take
Well shit I'm over it
At night when you had no where else to go
You were dying on the phone
Sick to your stomach on the floor
That night when you had no one else to call
Sick to your stomach on the floor
You were calling me like Doctor doctor doctor
At night when you had no where else to go
You were dying on the phone
Sick to your stomach on the floor

Worst Friends Forever <start> Nothing that you say will release you
Nothing that you pray would forgive you
Nothing's what your words mean to me
Something that you did will destroy me
Something that you said will stay with me long after you are dead and gone
If flesh could crawl
My skin would fall
From off my bones and run away from here
As far from god
As heaven is wide
As far from god
As angels can fly
If holy is as holy does
This house will burn straight down to hell
Take it's conscience with it
As it falls
Nothing said could change the fact
My trust was blind you broke the pact
If gods my witness god must be blind
If flesh could crawl
My skin would fall
From off my bones and run away from here
As far from god
As heaven is wide
As far from god
As angels can fly
I wish I wish I wish i wish
Take it back I dare you take it back
No you can't you should have thought of that
What's inside a man that goes so wrong <start> Whatever did happen to your soul
I heard you sold it
To some old boy who lived uptown
Who could afford it
So what's gonna happen to you now
Therapy... The pharmacy
Crazy
That's what you'd like to believe
But it ain't easy
When yer goin' crazy
Over the rainbow
I think your story's jive she said
There ain't nuthin' wrong with me
If I use it to get me some sympathy
Some ecstasy
A memory... I want to remember me
Crazy about ya
Crazy without ya

And turns it up.
He's found a place to go.
When he's had enough.
It's in the city where her parents said she couldn't go.
She don't care.
They hate her hair.
But she won't let it grow.
He ain't allowed to call.
Ripped the flyers off her wall.
Of that mohawked boy.
They fucking blame it all.
All ages show.
Forbidden city tonight.
It's all they know.
He's holding her so tight.
In the darkest corner of the club.
They're watching the band.
Holding hands tangled leather n studs.
Boots braces sucking on each others faces.
Tonight you know it just feels right.
Just another punk alone in the city.
With a skinhead girl a box of wine.
Yeah they're pretty fucked up.
And feeling shitty.
But at least they got each other tonight.
They feel this town as they spin around.
Together alone.
In the middle of the crowd.
They ain't going home.
No one's ever gonna tell them what to feel inside.
They don't care.
Blue Hair.
To match the feelings they hide.
Denied.
They've tried.
Now there just sick and tired.
Of not feeling alive

I show you all you need to know
I've never felt this way about someone
Whoa oh oh

There will come a time when everybody
Who is lonely will be free...
To sing  dance  love
There will come a time when every evil
That we know will be an evil...
That we can rise above
Who cares if hair is long or short
Or sprayed or partly grayed...
We know that hair ain't where it's at

Wah wahwah wah
There will come a time when everybody
Who is lonely will be free...
To sing  dance  love 
There will come a time when every evil
That we know will be an evil...
That we can rise above 
Who cares if you're so poor you can't afford
To buy a pair of mod a gogo stretchelastic pants...
There will come a time when you can even
Take your clothes off when you dance <start> One night me and the crew hit the road on a mission
To slurp free brew and go fuzzy flounder fishin'
Kayjees on the hifi and the keg was bottomless
Until we brought skip o' potmus
And daddy's gonna get some probably underage and dumb
And everybody knows that the daddy eats his young
Lupus in the lavatory making a big stink
Macing up the toilet seat and pooping in the sink
M.S.G.'s tanked up and wizzin' in a cup
Waiting for a sprinkle genie to come and drink it up
'Cause I'm the one bottle willy with the twelve horse ale
After that I get silly like soupy sales
Now it's midnight and I'm completely boofy blitzed
A six of Schlitz and the Jew brew Manischewitz
With my beertinted glasses I'm ready to bitty battle
I'm hungry like the wolf but I'll end up tending cattle
'Cause you're pretty when I'm drunk





Here she comes a funky fried cutie
Mr. Jimmy Pop Ali is gonna get some booty
'Cause I'm Mr. Mcfeelie with a speedy delivery
You'd think I was a ditch the way this chick was diggin' me
But maybe I should check and see if this is where I want to be
Hey lupus is she cut yeah for a pygmie
Aw what do you know you're probably going home alone
And it wouldn't be the first time that I gave a dog a bone
Plus beauty it's only skin deep
It's in the eye of the beholder and my beholder's about to tweak
I could tap that barrel in fact I know I can
It's a mnage  trois you and me and Heineken
'Cause you're pretty when I'm drunk




Regrets I've had a few
First and foremost I'd like to mention you
For the sake of conversation we'll call you the brand new heavy
Your a mix between an Ugnaut and Eugene Levy
You can call it bigboned I prefer to call it gut
Your Buddha your Shamu your Jabba the fuckin' Hutt
You had harpoon scars and your boobies were hairy
I smelt tuna melt but I wasn't gonna worry
It was three a.m. and I wasn't gettin' squat
So I rolled you up in flour and aimed it for the wet spot
I was buttering rolls like a soup kitchen Christian
Then it hit me something bit me while my little rod was fishin'
I was deep sea fishing I took a fat chance
But how was I supposed to know that jabberjaws
Lived in your pants
At that junction I came to realize
That only Frank Purdue likes thighs that size
Fatty fatty boom ba latty I gotta lament
That you were not a girl you were an experiment
'Cause you're pretty when I'm drunk

You're pretty when I'm drunk
And I'm pretty fucking drunk <start> Strange things take place in my moondreams
as the lonely and loveless hours go by
Your face takes its place in every moonbeam
moondreams bring thoughts gentle as a sigh
Moondreams can be a sensation
Moondreams may be fascination
love can be our destination
you and I can share this dream
Wishing for you in my moondreams
as the lonely and loveless hours go by
Will do until you can share all my dreams
moondreams brought by moonbeams in the skymoondreams  moondreams <start> You got your money you got your car
You got your bottle at the bar
It doesn't mean that you're anything
A rich bitch a rich bitch
The public loves you you're gonna go far
'Cause you're throwin' a charity bazaar
It doesn't mean that you give a damn
Watcha 
You're nothin but a rich bitch
A rich bitch a rich bitch
You expect me to spend my time
Loving you and pouring you wine
You just might as well forget it
I'm not your slave
A rich bitch a rich bitch
The public loves you you're gonna go far
'Cause the society makes you what you are
But that doesn't mean you're ready to be
Whatcha 
You're lyin' in the ditch bitch

You're gonna go 
You're gonna go 
You're gonna go 
Bitch <start> I know you've got your reasons
Your reasons to leave him
You'll get to start again
I know you've been through the stages
The fears and the rages
You've got to let it go
Don't remind me of the angry side you knew
That's not defined as love
So put it behind you
It's true he used to confine you
Used force to deny you
But now you can walk away
It's you. The future's in your hands
I know that you can
You've got to let it go
Don't tell him again
No jus take him away
I know you've got your reasons
Your reasons to leave here
You'll get to start again
It's you the future's in your hands
I know that you can
You've got to let it go <start> Tonight we're alone and the music is right
Do you feel good do you feel alright tonight
I'm out on the streets tonight I'm with a few
friends so it feel alright. Shouting out loud
to this doesn't do it. If it doesn't sink in
then i say screw it. Same old vices not much to
dream about is there anything left to fight about.
Fighting to live is the only fight I've got left in me
I've never been the same since that last show
I close my eyes and let myself go to a place
I'm never alone or scared Somehow i had a reason
a reason to care. I get so lost in it..
Live to fight  Fight to live
Tonight were alone and the music is right
do you feel good do you feel alright
Tonight were alone and the music is right
do you feel good do you feel alright
I'm on the train and I've got my phones
People all around but I'm good all alone
I won't worry what i need to be
wherever i am is the place to be
Tonight were alone and the music is right
do you feel good do you feel alright
Tonight were alone and the music is right
do you feel good do you feel alright
we feel good we feel alright tonight <start> I think a lot about the times when I was old and full on lines
Like man it's all so hip or was It groovy
Well anyway that's all so yuk
Like a book I didn't read last night
Concerning someone else's wife. whose husband's son
Had ran off with his mother
And you know. if  and  were multiplied they'd equal 
Little children started building not with bricks
But with what they had been told was
Advantageous to an old and sort of in between
Has been
I must admit it frightens me to think we take so literally
The fact that you can get away with murder
There ought to be a law against
Common sense of course will not prevail
If people going into jail
Are doing so for fear of unemployment
And you know. what makes a parrot talk
Is really rather cute
What he does is listen close then follows suit
And within a minute. two at best. refers to you
As nothing less than some obscene
Has been
I've never had myself altered. what for
I mean if I did. I'm not sure
I'd be all that happy to see. another me
I wouldn't be at all surprised if I looked you
Straight in the eyes
And saw there were no stars. only your eyeballs
And you know if two and two were joined
By two they'd equal 
Little children started building not with bricks
And without even the prompting will bestow on you
The daunting little words that mean
Has been
A sort of In between
Has been <start>

That's all byebye.. <start> You don't get your dreamjob 'cause you're too tall.
You missed your wakeup call.
A drunken guy crashed in your car
Can't pay for your drinks at the bar.
Your boss said it was nice to work with you
You think he's just a jerk.
The new shoes you bought are ruined after a mile.
The sheets are warm. The fridge is filled.
Everything's so funny
Living in the land the land of milk and honey.
And now your girlfriend sold your favourite CD.
They've towed your car away.
While watching girls you fell from a tree.
And that was hard but now the best
You haven't seen a girl undressed.
Mummy said they'd take you out of college.
The sheets are warm. The fridge is filled.
Everything's so funny
Living in the land the land of milk and honey.
The sheets are warm. The fridge is filled.
Everything's so funny
Living in the land the land of milk and honey.

Steht da drauen ein Kerl ein Monster nicht wahr.
Sieht aus wie eine Mischung zwischen einer
Sylvesterrakete und einem Lumpensammler.
h im Gesicht Pickel nicht wahr.
Ich h denke noch um Gottes Willen nicht wahr
schreit dieser Kerl Gr Dich Onkel
Ich bin zusammengefahr'n nicht wahr.
Um Gottes Willen im Haus nicht wahr.
Wenn das einer mitbekommt da ich verwandt sein soll
mit diesem Virus nicht wahr das ist ja h.
Gott sei Dank war der Spuk aber gleich vorbei.
Sie ham ihn dann gleich geholt und ham ihn zurck in das Heim verfrachtet.
Aber ich frage mich was sind das fr Heime
wo soetwas ausgebrtet wird <start> All the time I thought
There's only me
Crazy in a way
That no one else could be
I would have given everything I own
If someone would have said you're not alone
All the time I thought that I was wrong
Wanting to believe but needing to belong
If I'd've just believed in all I had
If someone would have said you're not so bad
All the time all the wasted time
All the years waiting for a sign
To think I had it all
All the time
All the time I thought
There's only me
Crazy in a way
That no one else could be
I can't believe that you were somewhere too
Thinking all the time there's only you <start>  <start> The mother of invention made it good for me
Tighter in the rear
Longer in the seam
Kicked out yards of leather
Wrapped around her waist
Trimmed it to perfection
And left a little space
Yeah they got competition now
All across the world
But there ain't been no looking back
Since God invented girls
Now I know what Brian Wilson meant
Every time I step outside
I see what Heaven sent
There may be seven wonders
Created for this world
But one is all we need
Since God invented girls
Higher on the heel paler than pure cream
Leaner on the sidewalk
Cutting through the steam
After claws and feathers
He took skin and bone
Shaped it like an hourglass
And made the angels moan <start> Got a doll baby I love her so
Nothing else like her anywhere you go
Man she's anything but calm
A regular pint sized atom bomb
Refrain Atom bomb baby little atom bomb
I want her in my wigwam
She's just the way I want her to be
A million times hotter than TNT
Atom bomb baby loaded with power
Radioactive as a TV tower
A nuclear fission in her soul
Loves with electronic control
Refrain
Atom bomb baby boy she can start
One of those chain reactions in my heart
A big explosion big and loud
Mushrooms me right up on a cloud
Refrain
Atom bomb baby sweet as a plum
Carries more wallop than uranium
When she kisses there's no hitch
Zero power she turns on the switch
Refrain
Atom bomb baby little atom bomb
I want her in my wigwam
She's just the way I want her to be
A million times hotter than TNT
Atom bomb baby little atom bomb <start> The radio
Whatever breaks my heart
All that you can't say
You seem to find a way
Whatever makes me cry
And everything you do
Takes a piece of me with you
Round and round
You're spinning me
Won't the sound just let me be
The radio is killing me
Singing all my memories
And why did we say goodbye
And why did we say goodbye
The radio is killing me
Singing all my memories
And why did we say goodbye
And why did we say goodbye
Whatever breaks my heart
All that you can't say
You seem to find a way
Whatever makes me cry
And everything you do
Takes a part of me with you
Round and round
You're spinning me
Kill the sound just let me be
The radio is killing me
Singing all my memories
And why did we say goodbye
And why did we say goodbye
The radio won't let me be
It's playing all our melodies
And why did we say goodbye
And why did we say goodbye Oh yeah oh
The radio is killing me
Singing all my memories
Why did we say goodbye
And why did we say goodbye
The radio is killing me
Singing all my memories
And why did we say goodbye

I'll embroider the truth
And that's so I shall reap
I took things that didn't belong to me
I didn't mean to do you wrong
Chorus
Looking back on all that stolen time
Back when I was drinking turpentine
Don't blame me
I only took you in
It takes time to do the poisoning
So let's close the door on this and lock it
And that's all it will ever be
Just an accident of chemistry
You did everything to me but stopped short of murder
Couldn't move me much closer to keeping my word
While the crowds threw stones at the hangman
The sky fell down
The bells rang
Chorus
And that's all that it will ever be
Just an accident of chemistry
Airless shaft of an underground railway
Effete assassin with a hawk in a sack
The earth will offer us in when our hearts fail
As it swallowed the river running under the track
Under the track yeah
I can't tell if I'm dreaming or if I'll awaken
With a song in my heart that is longing to break
Let it out and let it fly high
Up where the spires scrape the sky
Chorus
And that's all that it will ever be
Just an accident of history
Yeah
Airless shaft of an underground railway
Cute assassin with a hawk in a sack
The earth will offer us in when our hearts fail
Swallowed the river running under the track
That's right <start> Frankie died just the other night
Some say it was suicide
But we know
How the story goes
With his six string knife
And his streetwise pride
The boy was a man before his time
And she knew
All their dreams would come true
But ya see Frankie was fast
He was too fast to know
He wouldn't go slow
Until his lethal dose
And she knows
He'll finally come too close
Chorus
Well on with the show
Going on with the show
Come on baby
No no no
Oh my my my my my my
Chorus
He was bad
He was never good
But one thing that he understood
And she knew
All these lies would come true
The time has come
And he's paid his dues
And Suzy finally got the news
She always knew
This day would come soon
Chorus
Chorus
He was stopped on a dime
With a switchblade knife
Some damn punk went and
Took Frankie's life
And she knew
She'd have to pull through
Broken down
With his broken dreams
With a wink of an eye
Said Suzy listen to me
You must go
On with the show
Chorus
Chorus
Chorus
Oh baby <start> When Moses walked the children out of Egypt land
He said now don't you worry we're in the lords' hands
He's gonna' walk beside us  the time is coming near
He's gonna wash away our misery and our fear

Tomorrow'l be our lucky day
We'll be released from all our sorrow
Leave it layin' long the way

We've got to be like Daniel and the Lord will help us out

Comfort for the weak

Yeah there was a Jack who coiffed it
He came from my home town
He was a prophet

I didn't need you to reply
Is it gettin' heavy
But they'll realize
Is it gettin' heavy
Well I thought it was already as heavy
As can be
Is it overwhelming
To use a crane to crush a fly
It's a good time for Superman
To lift the sun into the sky
'Cause it's gettin' heavy
Well I thought it was already as heavy
As can be
Tell everybody
Waitin' for Superman
That they should try to
Hold on
Best they can
He hasn't dropped them
Forgot them
Or anything
It's just too heavy for Superman to lift
Is it gettin' heavy
Well I thought it was already as heavy as can be
Tell everybody
Waitin' for Superman
That they should try to
Hold on
Best they can
He hasn't dropped them
Forgot them
Or anything
It's just too heavy for Superman to lift <start> Life in hive city
Somewhere in the east
Flowing down a crowded street
As though I am or I will be released
Can't stop yawning clear blue morning
In mourning no more
Come and see the wild things
Just beyond the door
But there's an old man here who claims that he knew you
In another life
I'm not sure what he said
And could it be that he still thinks you're his wife
I've been waiting seems like eternity
I've been waiting waiting for you
I'm still waiting if you remember me
I'll be waiting waiting for you
Drink and sing on a desert wind behind here
The ghosts have laid there fine little clay to rest
But who they they left and what they thought they stayed for
Is crumbled in their life's dusty caress
They were so blind
They were so blind
Hiding in a hotel room
Somewhere in the west
I heard they brought a priest in to sanctify the place
But it remained unblessed
Things move around
My guitar sometimes plays itself
They say it's static electricity but
Yesterday it took twenty dollars off the shelf
There's a young man here says May or June another town
The children cry and ask where their mother is
Gonna have to let them down
I've been hurt... I've been around
I've been waiting seems like eternity
I've been waiting waiting for you
I'm still waiting if you remember me
I'll be waiting waiting for you
Lifted shelves are fading in the valley
Where once the sea had strength enough to reach
And out of twisted metal I've discarded for Gaea's curse
no one here can quite translate the verses they wanted to preach
They were blind
They were so blind
They were so blind
They were so blind
I've been waiting seems like eternity
I've been waiting waiting for you 
I'm still waiting if you remember me
I'll be waiting waiting for you <start> I took the time to compare emotions with energy
And found that the secret was to always have a strategy
The mazes we build to trap our inconsistencies
And misguided loyalties can weigh us down and come with penalties
There's only one way out two left turns to the south
But what's the price I will pay
Am I lazy or just insane it's hard to tell 'cause nothing every feels the same
The trail I left behind is gone the secret's out my strategy failed to help
So find your way and I'll do the same
I try my best not to fear what's waiting around each bend
It's only uncertainty and most of which won't bother me
I just stumble down every path I take
There's not a minute to waste
Am I lazy or just insane it's hard to tell 'cause nothing every feels the same
The trail I left behind is gone the secret's out my strategy failed to help
So find your way and I'll do the same...I'll meet you on the other side <start> There's a friend who will call
When her husband's asleep
Crossing the phone lines for comfort
And she cries that she needs him and
Someday he'll change
And now's not a good time to go
And it isn't my place to say leave him and run
That no love is worth all the damage he's done
But if she'll hold her ground
Then I'll hold my tongueever the diplomat
Oh I'd like to think
That I would be stronger than that
Where's her head
Where's her nerve
Does part of her think this is all she deserves
OhI would be stronger
I would not stay one minute longer
I would be stronger than that
It started out goodthey usually do
Then one dayit's taken for granted
'Til words become weapons and love turns to pain
Ohwhy is she still holding on
She says living without him is too hard to face
And I try to imagine myself in her place
But with well chosen words and well placed tears
She forgives him in two seconds flat
OhI'd like to think
That I would be stronger than that
Where's her head
Where's her nerve
Does part of her think this is all she deserves
Oh I would be stronger
I would not stay one minute longer
I would be stronger than that
I know what she's thinking and I know what she'd say
That my life and her life are like night and like day
And her love is the love that will save him
Brave words but I don't believe them
Where's her head
Where's her nerve
Does part of her think this is all she deserves
Oh I would be stronger
I would not stay one minute longer
I would be stronger than that
Oh I would be stronger
I would not wait one minute longer
I would be stronger than that <start> Instrumental <start> You are the loneliest person that I've ever known
We are joined at the surface but nowhere else
I look in the glass and stare at your strained
Grey motionless face and ask
Underneath is there a golden soul
Take care of the ones that you love
Take care of the ones that you love
Baby I'm leaving here
You need to be with somebody else
I can't stop bleeding here
Can you suture my wounds
Everyone is beginning to breathe as I break down
You are in love with a shadow that won't come back
Sooner or later we all have to wait
Try forgetting everything
Underneath there's a perfect sky
Baby I'm leaving here
You need to be with somebody else
I can't stop bleeding here
Can you suture my wounds and feelings
Baby I'm leaving here
You need to be with somebody else
I can't stop bleeding here
Can you suture my wounds and feelings
Baby I'm leaving here
You need to be with somebody else
I can't stop bleeding here
Can you suture my wounds and feelings
Baby I'm leaving here
You need to be with somebody else
I can't stop bleeding here
Can you suture my wounds <start> Once knew a woman
She put a curse on me that eventually came true
She was a head on wreck
On a mystic ride 
Among the visions and the ruins
She was my unsuspecting secret mission
Leftover passion and desire they only deepen the wound
But you must admit that the pain is sweet
It makes you howl at the moon
I guess you are my unsuspecting secret mission
Every eleven days or so
I get a message from you
Invisible ink on invisible paper
But I can smell the perfume
I guess I ain't your unsuspecting secret mission
No you aren't my unsuspecting secret mission <start> Some miserable day back in November
Newcastle is grey as grey as the river
But your eyes are bright with life
And life is bright with you
Chorus
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
You're laughing again I'm so glad that she met you
As you start to explain something I'm proud of you
But I forget all that relax
And just enjoy the fact that life is good
Chorus
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
So I'm trying to pretend you're out in the garden
That you're about to walk in
To wash your hands in the kitchen
But she said your face changed
And your breath got slower and slower
Until there was breath no more <start> Days filled with joy and days filled with sorrow
I don't know just what to do
Am I happy today am I lonely tomorrow
Everything depends on you
I've been waiting for the angels to knock on my door
I've been hopin' that everything could be like before
Open your heart and tell me what's wrong
Why can't you talk like you used to do before
I don't know if I'm weak I don't know if I'm strong
Hey girl I can't cope anymore
I've been waiting...
Open your heart let me hear you
Make up your mind I want to hear you call
Open your heart want to come near you
Make up your mind oh girl before I fall
Maybe the sun will continue to shine
Maybe the rain will continue to fall
Maybe you want to leave me behind
Maybe you'll change and give me a call <start> If I was a drift on an ocean all alone
You came and rescued me
When I was far from home
Rush of love around my heart
Just as I fell apart
Chorus
Nobody ever cared as much for me 
Nobody's touched my heart and healed my pain
You've picked up the pieces and put me back together again
Oh ya
Careful we're fragile and easily we break
In your arms I'm certain
It's all the love we make
Rush of love around my heart
Just as you take my hand
Chorus
I'll write you name in
Stars across the sky 
We'll drift away in
To each others eyes
Hey ya  Hey ya ya ya ya ya oh ya ya
Chorus x
Nobody ever cared as much for me 
Nobody's touched my heart and healed my pain
You've picked the pieces and you've put me back together again <start> Day after day all I saw was you
And the sky came a tumbling down
Smoke in the air all I want is truth
I am a light that's aglow that's alive
That's a warm place in your heart
You kept turning me on and off
'Til I went out and you were standing shivering in the dark
Open your eyes
And see me leaving
Closing the door
I won't think twice
When you come pleaing
Not anymore
Hope was a dream that I had of you
In the soft warm slumber of dawn
I must keep in mind that reality
Can be painful if neglected too long
I am aware that I will soon be released
To the mercy of a concrete jungle
I thought that I could glide right in
But instead it's over loneliness and pride I stumble
Open your eyes
And see me leaving
Closing the door
I won't think twice
When you come pleaing
Not anymore no no no
Open your eyes
And see that I am not afraid of
Saying goodbye
Your strikes are up I'm gone
So don't even try
'Cause I'm telling you right now
That I'm a free young woman
And I gotta be moving on
Once I was lost in my strife
And getting you off was my life
I was in doubt now I know
That getting rid of you was all I needed to grow
Once I was lost now I'm found
With my Adidas on the ground
Once I was blind now I see
The negative effect that you were having on me
Open your eyes
And see me leaving
Closing the door
I won't think twice
When you come pleaing
Not anymore  no no
You're not the man
That I remember
Tell me your name
Cold empty seat
That long November
You never came
Open your eyes
And see me
See me leaving <start> Michael and Heather at the baggage claim
Tired of playing the waiting game
Every bag has got a different name
Michael and Heather may never get home again
Michael and Heather at the lost and found
Looking for luggage that's soft and brown
Sir I'm so sorry it's just not around
Michael and Heather are glad to be on the ground
It's been a long long day
Can't we just be on our way
It's been a long long day
Can't we just be on our way
Michael and Heather on the shuttle bus
Standing alongside the rest of us Michael says
Heather have you had enough
Heather says Michael you know that it's you I love <start> You got the lights on in the afternoon
And the nights are drawn out long
And you're kissing to cut through the gloom
With a cough drop coloured tongue
And you were sitting in the corner with the coats all piled high
And I thought you might be mine
In a small world on an exceptionally rainy Tuesday night
In the right place and time
When the zeros line up on the  hour clock
When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks
Well you cured my January blues
Yeah you made it all alright
I got a feeling I might have lit the very fuse
That you were trying not to light
You were a stranger in my phonebook I was acting like I knew
'Cause I had nothing to lose
When the winter's in full swing and your dreams just aren't coming true
Ain't it funny what you'll do
When the zeros line up on the  hour clock
When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks
The late afternoon
The ghost in your room that you always thought didn't approve of you knocking boots
Never stopped you letting me get hold of the sweet spot by the scruff of your
Knee socks
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of mean streets
You could be my baby
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of mean streets
You could be my baby
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of mean streets
You could be my baby
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of mean streets
You could be my baby
When the zeros line up on the  hour clock
When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks
When the zeros line up on the  hour clock
When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks
Knee socks
Knee socks <start> What goes around comes around
And I can't breathe
What holds me up is what holds me down
And I am more unstable than I seem
There's not much there
My heart is bare
Chorus
But I believe You've given me more
Than I could know
And I know this
You are good
I've fought the fight against myself
And I have lost the fight again
My body's broke from falling down
This time I'll win
Just give me one more chance
My heart is bare
My eyes are weak I can only see
But I know that you're e there
A glimmer of Your gold
But it's enough to know
You are good
And through it all You've given me
Oh how I know
A peace that overflows
That You are good
So good to me
You're good <start> Corporate market rule monetary steeple. crucified for power. profit over people. capitalist vultures circle a dying nation. drawn by scent of desperation. mass production. exploit the poor. life consumption will be our downfall. <start> She's going out to forget they were together
All that time he was taking her for granted
She wants to see if there's more
Than he gave she's looking for
He calls her up
He's trippin' on the phone now
He doesn't want her out there
And alone now
He knows she's movin' it
Knows she's using it
Now he's losing it she don't care
Everybody put up your hands
Say I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love
Feel the beat now
If you've got nothing left
Say I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love
Back it up now
You've got a reason to live
Say I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love
Feelin' good now
Don't be afraid to get down
Say I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love
He was always giving her attention
Looking hard to find the things she mentioned
He was dedicated but most suckers hate it
That girl was fine but she didn't appreciate him
She calls him up
She's trippin' on the phone now
He had to get up
And he ain't comin' home now
He's tryin' to forget her
That's how we come with him
When he first met her
When they first got together
Everybody put up your hands
Say I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love
Feel the beat now
If you got nothing left
Say I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love
Back it up now
You got a reason to live
Say I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love
Feelin' good now
Don't be afraid to get down
Say I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love
To the beat to the beat to the beat
You got nothing to lose
Don't be afraid to get down
We break up it's something that we do now
Everyone has got to do it sometime
It's okay let it go
Get out there and find someone
It's too late to be trippin' on the phone here
Get off the wire know everything is good here
Stop what you're doin' you don't wanna ruin
The chance that you got to find a new one
Everybody put up your hands
Say I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love
Feel the beat now
If you got nothing left
Say I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love
Back it up now
You got a reason to live
Say I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love
Feelin' good now
Don't be afraid to get down
Say I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love
No no
Now you know what to do
So come on get up girl <start> Nashville sky
In a morning sun
Somewhere up north
A new life begun
He was drawn to the twister
With a Memphis sound
Kissed by an angel
Of a music town
Jump a train from Chicago
Trace it back
With the neck of a bottle
And the groove of the tracks
Spend your life running
That angels sweet sound
Chasing the ghosts
Of a faraway town
Oh Mississippi
Running through my veins
Oh Mississippi
Never the same again <start> Well I've opened up my veins too many times
And the poison's in my heart and in my mind
Poison's in my bloodstream poison's in my pride
I'm after rebellion I'll settle for lies
Is it any wonder that my mind's on fire
Imprisoned by the thoughts of what you do
Is it any wonder that the joke's an iron
And the jokes on you
Experiments that failed too many times
Transformations that were too hard to find
Poison's in my bloodstream poison's in my pride
I'm after rebellion I'll settle for lies
Yes I know the secrets of the iron and mind
They're trinity acts a mineral fire
Yes I know the secrets of the circuitry mind
It's a flaming wonder telepath
Well I've opened up my veins too many times
And the poison's in my heart and in my mind
Poison's in my bloodstream poison's in my pride
I'm after rebellion I'll settle for lies
Is it any wonder that my mind's on fire
Imprisoned by the thoughts of what you do
Is it any wonder that the joke's an iron
And the jokes on you
And the joke's on you <start> Bette Midler

We haven't lyrics of this song. Please add these lyrics for other users. Use Correct. Thanks to you. <start> It was on the trail of riches
We set off upon that day
To the Castle keep of Carisbrooke
To where the treasure lay
And soon I found the diamond
At the bottom of the well
But that traitor of a Turnkey
To his death below he fell
Have a care have a care
T'was evilly come by and no good will you find there
Have a care have a care
T'was evilly stolen only pain and sorrow there have a care
Then across the sea to Holland
With the jewel in my hand
Where we went to sell our treasure
At the house of Aldebrand
When he said it was no diamond
Through the window it was tossed
But that wicked man was lying
And we were caught in a doublecross
Have a care have a care
T'was evilly come by and no good will you find there
Have a care have a care
T'was evilly stolen only pain and sorrow there have a care
What shall we do with the boy who's stealing
What shall we do with the boy who's stealing
What shall we do with the boy who's stealing early in the morning
Throw him into jail let him rot forever
Throw him into jail let him rot forever
Throw him into jail let him rot forever early in the morning
Have a care have a care
T'was evilly come by and no good will you find there
Have a care have a care
T'was evilly stolen only pain and sorrow there have a care <start> Tonight you're mine completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow
Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow
Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun
I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow <start> Such a tiny spark
Little tiny spark
But a spark it could catch and could grow and could burn this whole place To the ground.
Such a little voice
Little tiny voice
Still its easy to hear how it someday could fill a whole world with sound.
But you hardly breath cause you move so fast
Never looking back
Never looking back.
Oh do you know where your going
Do you know where your head is
Where your sweet crooked smile is taking you
Hummingbird.
Oh she won't be denied
She wont be denied.
Oh she won't be denied
She wont be denied.
Theres a world out there
And its unaware
Of the world that is coming
But soon you will have this whole place
In a spin.
See its in her eyes in those worldly eyes
Shes a wonder of nature a wonderful creature
So sly tonight is she.
Oooh do you know where your going
On this journey your making
Watch your too tiny face are fighting for.
Like a little hummingbird
Hovering innocently
Flying in though my window
Taking over.

Ah she won't be denied
She won't be denied
Ah She won't be denied
She will not be denied.
Ah do you know where your going <start> Come to me
Come lie beside me
Oh don't deny me your love
Make sense of me
Walk through my doorway
Don't hide in the hallway
Oh love step over
I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down
In the name of whiskey
In the name of song
You didn't look back
You didn't belong
In the name of reason
In the name of hope
In the name of religion
In the name of dope
In the name of freedom
You drifted away
To see the sun shining
On some one else's day
In the name of United
And the BBC
In the name of Georgie Best
And LSD
In the name of the Father
And his wife the Spirit
You said you did not
They said you did it
In the name of justice
In the name of fun
In the name of the Father
In the name of the Son
Call to me
No one is listening
I'm waiting to hear from you love
Stay with me
It's cold in the ground
But there's peace in the sound
Of the white and the black
Spilling over
I'll follow you down <start> Girl I've got somethin' just a waitin' for you
That's gonna make you smile and never leave you blue
I've carried it around waiting for the right time
To give it to you and make you mine
Just give it a chance and you're gonna want it
Cause I've got a heart with your name on it
It beats strong and it beats true
And you'll love the love that it's gonna give you
You might as well take you already own it
I've got a heart with your name on it
I've got a heart with your name on it
I could feel the heat when I look in your eyes
You were carving your name with a burning fire
Now I'm a brand new man branded with the thought of you
Holding me tight the whole night through
All you've gotta do is say that you want it
Cause I've got a heart with your name on it
It beats strong it beats true
And you'll love the love that it's gonna give you
You might as well take it you already own it
I've got a heart with your name on it
Well
It beats strong and it beats true
And you'll love the love that it's gonna give you
You might as well take it you already own it
I've got a heart with your name on it
I've got a heart with your name on it
I've got a heart with your name on it <start> Came in from a rainy Thursday on the avenue
Thought I heard you talking softly.
I turned on the lights the TV and the radio
Still I can't escape the ghost of you
What has happened to it all
Crazy some'd say
Where is the life that I recognize
Gone away
But I won't cry for yesterday there's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find.
And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world
I will learn to survive.
Passion or coincidence once prompted you to say
Pride will tear us both apart
Well now pride's gone out the window cross the rooftops run away
Left me in the vacuum of my heart.
What is happening to me
Crazy some'd say
Where is my friend when I need you most
Gone away
But I won't cry for yesterday there's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find.
And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world
I will learn to survive.
Papers in the roadside tell of suffering and greed
Feared today forgot tomorrow
Ooh here besides the news of holy war and holy need
Ours is just a little sorrowed talk

And I don't
But I won't cry for yesterday there's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find.
And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world
I will learn to survive.
Every world is my world 
Any world is my world 
Any world is my world
Every world is my world <start> Wait a minute.
Can't you see what this pain has done to me
I'm alive but I'm slippin'
What you see I can't see and maybe you'll think before you speak
I'm alive for you.
I'm awake because of you
I'm alive told you.
I'm awake swallowing you
Take a second.
Turn your back on me and make believe
It's safe to say you're never alive.
A big part of you has died and by the way I hope you're satisfied
I'm alive for you.
I'm awake because of you
I'm alive told you.
I'm awake swallowing you
I'm alive for you.
I'm awake because of you
I'm alive told you.
I'm awake swallowing you <start> The life I have
Is the life I've always wanted
and there's no more feeling low...
Early morning and I'm on the go
Here I'm finally on the road...
On the road
And I wanna put my faith in you babe
But I have to face it in another way
Let go...free from all
Now I'm a traveller...traveller...travel around.
But don't worry baby I need someplace to call my home
...never worry baby I need someone to call my own.
RIGHT
And I wanna put my faith in you babe
But I have to face it in another way
I wanna put my faith in you babe...
So let go...free from all
Let go...I'll free fall
Now I'm a traveller...traveller...
...traveller... traveller...
...traveller... traveller...
...TRAVELLER...TRAVELLER...TRAVEL AROUND <start> Take you back
Do do do do
Take you back
Take you back
Do do do do
Take you back
I don't know why I should even try
To take you back
Take you back in my life
You say there's a reason
That you can't live without my love
Push me back
You push me just too far
You never stop
You are what you are
You lie and you hurt me
When you do the things you do
Now the nights are forever
All the low lie together
No one else will it matter
There's nothing you can say or do
Change my mind of you with you
Don't put me down no more
Here's walking out the door
You know that I love you
But I can't be a fool no more
I need someone in my life <start> I can't believe that I'm here in this place again
How did I manage to mess up one more time
This pattern seems to be the story of my life
Should have learned this lesson by the thousandth time.
'Cause I promised myself I wouldn't fall
But here I've fallen
I guess I'm not as strong as I thought
All I can do is cry to you.
Chorus
Oh God you have to save me
You're my last and only hope
All my right answers fail me
I can't seem to make it on my own.
Always thought that I would be strong enough
What made all of them fall couldn't take me down
Yeah did I think that I was above it all
I have learned that pride comes before the fall
I can't promise myself that I won't fall
'Cause here I've fallen
I know I'm not as strong as I thought
All I can do is cry to you.
Chorus x <start> Dancing the night away
Dancing the night away
Dancing the night away
Dancing the night away
So you want to believe
Everything that you read
And you think that you're makin' the grade
 just when you're getting it made
You're still in love with her
She'd love you to kiss her
Hopin' you'll miss her
By takin' your mind off the load
Just when you're ready to go
You turn your back on her
You just got your mind on the things ahead
At last you're gonna be free
You'll only miss her
Just after you kiss her
Dancing the night away
Dancing the night away
Dancing the night away
Dancing the night away
Dancing the night away
Dancing the night away
So you turn on the smiles
'cause you think of the time
And nobody knows who you are
You don't think you'll get very far
I don't even know your name
At last they accept you
In case you go next year
And ask you to reach for the sky
And just when you're ready to die
They turn their back on you
So they put you on ice
In survival hotel
And wish you would die from the cold
When all you want is a night alone
Dancing the night away
Dancing the night away
Dancing the night away
Dancing the night away
Dancing the night away
Dancing the night away
Dancing and the song you sing
Dancing every move you make
Dancing makes my body go
Dancing right across the floor
Dancing
Dancing
Dancing <start> Bite down hold your tongue girl
Lights out over our world
Lips spoken the truth left you feeling ashamed
Youre calling out
Reborn a well rehearsed line
Once more wasting our time
But Im ready to set your record straight
When youre calling out
Wear your time feeling lucky
If youre lucky at all
Wear your time out
Remember the day remember the night
Remember the weekend walk to the coldest fight in the rain
We said our goodbyes honey my love washed out
As you made up your mind in the rain
Soft heart full of regret
Beats slow like a bad threat
I burned the letter you wrote reinviting me in
Youre calling out
Your choice and I've spoken
My word yours broken
And now youre wanting it back it backfired again
But youre calling out
Wear your time feeling lucky
If youre lucky at all
Wear your time out
Remember the day remember the night
Remember the weekend walk to the coldest fight in the rain
We said our goodbyes honey my love washed out
As you made up your mind in the rain
Remember the day remember the night
Remember the weekend walk to the coldest fight in the rain
We said our goodbyes honey my love washed out
As you made up your mind in the rain
And I'm gone I'm gone
Another goodbye another goodbye
So self assured with unbelievable posture
Attempt retired at the blink of an eye
She said Our darkest hour was the worst departure
Another goodbye another goodbye
So self assured with unbelievable posture
Attempt retired at the blink of an eye
She said Our darkest hour was the worst departure
Remember the day remember the night
Remember the weekend walk to the coldest fight in the rain
We said our goodbyes honey my love washed out
As you made up your mind in the rain
Remember the day remember the night
Remember the weekend walk to the coldest fight in the rain
We said our goodbyes honey my love washed out
As you made up your mind in the rain <start> I tried and tried finally I realized
Why she left this D world behind
Go
She got tired of the same old story
She had a mind that would not quit
She'd insist a plot must exist
With an ending that she could not guess
She tried hard to convince me
Then she took off like a bright idea
She believed there just had to be
A movie that she'd never seen
I watched as her fingers drew
A perfect line in space
I watched as she looked on through
Into another place
She found out what she'd been missing
She decided she could change her luck
She was right life's not black and white
It's something more than meets the eye
I watched as her fingers drew
A perfect line in space
I watched as she walked straight through
Into another place
She parted with convention
Now she's living in the th dimension
Without me
I watched as her fingers drew
A perfect line in space
I watched as she walked straight through
Into another place
I tried and tried and still I don't know why
She left me no address or a way to guess
I tried and tried finally I realized
Why she left this D world behind
Now she's somewhere in the th dimension
She's living in D
She found herself a new direction there
She's living without me
She's living in D
She's living without me
Somewhere in the th dimension
She's living in D
She found herself a new direction there
She's living without me
She's living in D
She's living without me <start> Hey man it's been a while
Do you remember me
When I hit the streets I was 
A little wild a little green
I've been up and down and in between
After all these years
Can you believe I'm still chasing that dream
But I ain't looking over my shoulder
Chorus
I like the bed I'm sleeping in
It's just like me it's broken in
It's not old  just older
Like a favorite pair of torn blue jeans
This skin I'm in it's alright with me
It's not old  just older
It's good to see your face
You ain't no worse for wear
Breathing that California air
When we took on the world
When we were young and brave
We got secrets that we'll take to the grave
And we're standing here shoulder to shoulder
Chorus
I'm not old enough to sing the blues
But I wore the holes in the soles of these shoes
You can roll the dice 'til they call your bluff
But you can't win until you're not afraid to lose
Well I look in the mirror
I don't hate what I see
There's a few more lines staring back at me
The nights have grown a little colder
Hey man I gotta run
Now you take care
If you see coach T. Tell him I cut my hair
It's been all these years
Can you believe I'm still chasing dreams
But I ain't looking over my shoulder
Chorus <start> She came dancing right before my eyes
She said shed came to warn me
Before it dawned on me
I went walking on the blank hillside
Where the sunset falls
Where the sunset dies
She gave me love she told me lies
That most mischievous ghost
She was in disguise she was in disguise she was in disguise.
He started to whistle they bought him a flute
He was talking in tongues they swore he was mute
He scoffed and blasphemed they said it was beautiful
Busted a button they bought him a suitcase full
They coloured him cricket and laced him up tight
As he drew on their days resurrected his nights
He raved in the dark he went out in a blaze
There you go they said hes good for nothing and lazy
With scandal and shame they slandered his name
They told him to freeze they damned him to roast
Disappointed that he passed away peacefully
Never tryingdying to be a mischievous ghost
They dug him up quick with a polish and lick
They powdered him up till he only looked sick
The hinge in his backbone would bend to applause
But his dancing was not quite as lively of course
These are the rewards immortality affords
Bullied and bribed and beaten to bliss
Harrington slacksHarrods in slacks and tormental laments
Of going away and not being missed
With scandal and shame they slandered his name
They told him to freeze they damned him to roast
Disappointed that he passed away peacefully
Never dying to be a mischievous ghost
With the green beer and the shamrock tattoos
Singing his songs of the battles we lose
And whenwill you come home again so we can murder you
What would you do if they took his word
With fortyeight million to join in the toast
Move over my darling
Mischievous ghost
Mischievous ghost <start> American native dances through the night.
In search of a spirit who'll bring back the light.
A trail full of tears a desert full of sand.
He dances for hours to bring back his land.
Mr. Politician he walks through another door.
He talks about love and peace and turns around and starts a war.
A new world order a one way government.
Prepare your shelter and ask the Lord for guidance.
Its only the simple things that you do.
American people its time we make a stand.
And fight for our country or well surely lose this land.
American native can you teach us how to pray.
Deliever us from evil and showus the way.
Its only the simple things that you do.
And if this crazy old world ever gets you down.
Just call my name Ill be around.
And in the end youll see that this whole thing was just a dream.
Awaken from your sleep youll be found.
Its only the simple things that you do. <start> Since the day I turned fifteen I've been
Standing on my own
Never tried no suicide standing on my own
Everyday I'm moving forward even
Though it seems a little bit awkward
Lost myself a thousand times I found
My way home I found my way home
Standing on my own with no help from you
Since I lost my innocence I've been
Standing on my own
No time to reminisce standing on my own
Everyday I seem to mess up even
Though I think it's real bad luck
Lost myself a thousand times I found my way home
Standing on my own with no help from you
Since the day I turned fifteen I've been
Standing on my own
Never tried no suicide standing on my own
I learned to live I learned to live I've
Been standing on my own
I learned to fight I'll learn to die
Standing on my own
Standing on my own with no help from you <start> Ooh look at me in a Cadillac
You can play in a convertible child
I've never been driven baby you're the first
come on baby drive me wild ooh
Ooh look at me on the telephone
whatever you want just dial
come on baby please it's so easy
do it baby drive me wild
come on baby do it drive me wild
do it baby drive me wild
Ooh look at me on the radio
call me up and make a request
If you want anything just name it
when I'm bad baby I'm the best <start> Sie war ein Kind der Sterne
Sie war voller Charme
Lachte auf meinen Knien
Weinte in meinem Arm.
Sie rief laut meinen Namen
Zog mir an den Haaren
Ihre Blicke waren albern
Ihre Blicke waren warm.
Sie war ein Kind der Sterne
Geradeaus und frei
Und die Welt auf ihren Schultern war kinderleicht.
Jetzt kennt sie keine Richtung und hat schon genug
Und spielt mit ihrem Fahrschein fr den letzten Zug.
Nicht schwarz
Nicht wei
Ist nicht kalt oder hei
Sie wei nicht mehr
Wo's lang geht
Dreht sich hilflos I'm Kreis.
Nicht ja
Nicht nein
Ist nicht Wasser
Nicht Stein
Sie hat sich irgendwann verloren und findet nicht mehr heim.
Sie war ein Kind der Sterne und wuchs prchtig auf
Was gut oder schlecht war
Fhlte sie genau.
Jetzt schweigt sie allwissend
Hat fr sich abgeklrt
Die einen klffen mit der Meute
Die anderen gar nicht mehr.
Nicht schwarz

Ist nicht kalt oder hei
Sie wei nicht mehr
Wo's lang geht
Dreht sich hilflos I'm Kreis.
Nicht ja
Nicht nein
Ist nicht Wasser

Sie hat sich irgendwann verloren und findet nicht mehr heim.
Sie liegt auf meinen Knien und ist weit
Weit weg
So als sucht sie in der Ferne irgendein Versteck.
Sie war ein Kind der Sterne ohne ein Problem
Was ist passiert
Ich word' es nie verstehen.
Nicht schwarz
Nicht wei
Ist nicht kalt oder hei
Sie wei nicht mehr
Wo's lang geht
Dreht sich hilflos I'm Kreis.
Nicht ja
Nicht nein
Ist nicht Wasser

War ein Kind der Sterne
War ein kind der Sterne und findet nicht mehr heim. <start> Dare mo ga kitto kokoro no

And to pack unheavy
Because the truck was getting full.
But the same old fear
At the end of the year
Wouldn't let us leave so soon.
The Blue Ridge Mountains were calling
The rain was falling
The wind was in our faces.
And above the sound
Of the engine I found us
Arriving at those places.
I've heard you say a
Thousand times
That we could never leave
This town
But where were you last night
When the sun went down.
The rain proved steady
And as our packs wore heavy
With the weight of our survival.
The woods rang loud
With the love of our God
And the sound of our revival.
The summer wind turned colder
As the day grew older
The night would soon surround us.
The Curtis Falls
Had a view of it all
As the snow fell all around us.
I've heard you say a
Thousand times
That we could never leave
This town
But where were you last night
When the sun went down.
I was singing alone
You were standing on the side.
And the water so warm
As you walked the mountain side
And you washed my feet and cried.
Well the days passed quickly
And our time was over
Three souls the same in sorrow.
But the Reds and rain
Put an intimate stain
On the start of our tomorrow.
And soon our pieces will scatter
In a world of anger
The only thing to free us
Is the part of man
That we don't understand
That found a place between us.
I've heard you say a
Thousand times
That we could never leave
This town
But where were you last night
When the sun went down. <start> You my friend
You have nothing to fear my friend
You have nothing to fear my friend
Except for love
We're moles my friend
We are just moles my friend
Blind against the dark
That's where we belong
The hungry crocodiles are dancing in the light
But what's up there besides the darkness of the night
The hungry crocodiles are dancing in the light
But what's up there besides the darkness of the night
Forget them friend
You better hear my friend
Where the tunnels never end
To love is to pretend
Don't try to love yourself again
That is the worst kind of pain
We're not those kind of freaks amen
We're a different site and breed of men
Up there they're drinking down the day
They mix it with the chardonnay
They try to keep the dark at bay
Down here the darkness stays
The hungry crocodiles are dancing in the light
But what's up there besides the darkness of the night
The hungry crocodiles are dancing in the light
But what's up there besides the darkness of the night <start> You make my heart beat too fast
You make me want this to last
You make me spend all my money
Oh I think I love you honey
You make me think I could miss you
You make me think I should kiss you
You make me want your affection
We need to make a connection
You're so angelic
I'm psychedelic with emotion
And I can't come down
Well my heart was playing dead
But love changes everything around
I wanna ride in your car
I wanna know where you are
Why don't you make me your fool
Come on baby take me to school
You make me want to be sweet
You make me walk down your street
You make me dance to your beat
I'm gonna save you a seat
You're making me lose my focus
You've got some bad hocus pocus
You make me think you're clever
I'm gonna love you forever <start> When your world it starts to fall apart
Look deep within within your lonely heart.
Do your best my friend try and understand
It's only you pull yourself through.
When you tell your story
Make sure your story's right
Every little single word is true.
See what love can do.
See what love can do.
When the words are in the music the music is the song.
The world would be so happy if we'd all just get along.
I want to see it a smile on every face.
So when we tell our story
Make sure that it's right
And every single word is true.
See what love can do.
See what love can do.
So when you tell your story honey
Make sure that it's right.
I finally proved the message true.
I see what love can do.
See what love can do.
See what love can do.
See what love can do.
When we sing the story
Make sure your song is right.
Finally proved the message true.
See what love can do.
Oh see what love can do.
See what love can do.
See what love can do.
See what love can do.
See what love can do. <start> Is it true what they say about Dixie
Does the sun really shine all the time
Do the sweet magnolias blossom at everybody's door
Do folks keep eating possum
Till they can't eat no more
Is it true what they say about Swanee
Is a dream by that stream so sublime
Do they laugh do they love like they say in every song
If it's true that's where I belong <start> He came in and sits down at the end of the bar
His old rawhide shirt full of dust
He asked for a glass and he ordered rye whiskey
He talked to himself and he cussed
He left Sacramento early that mornin'
With a sackful of mail for St. Joe
Had to outrun some outlaws outside Carson City
By ridin' where they wouldn't go
He said to me Mister this long ridin's hell
But I guess it's got to be done
Otherwise how would you get all your mail
If the pony express couldn't run
I said I hear you mister and you do your job well
But I hear it won't be for long
They'll be sendin' the mail by the wire and the rail
And your pony and you will be gone
He came in and sits down at the end of the bar
His coveralls covered with dust
He said Jesse James had just held up his train
He talked to himself and he cussed
He pulled out of St. Joe early that morning
With the mail and the union payroll
Had to stop for a rock slide outside Jackson City
And Jesse made off with the gold
He said to me Mister this railroading's hell
But I guess it's got to be done
Otherwise how would you get all you mail
If that old iron horse couldn't run
I said I hear you mister and you do your job well
But I hear it won't be for long
They'll be sending the mail without you or the rail
'Cause they say man will fly before long
He came in and sits down at the end of the bar
His face looked all haggard and gray
He ordered a drink and said Make it a double
Boys it's sure been a long day
He pulled out of Denver early that mornin'
He said You'll never guess where I've been
A hijacker needed a lift down to Cuba
So your mail will be late getting in
I said I hear you mister and you do your job well
But you know it ain't been that long
They were doing it best with the pony express
Before you and your friends came along <start> What is that strang air in the sky.
Why should a strange star pass me by.
How can you congratulate the people who destroyed the piece of mind
the silly people just like you and better too.
How can you keep turning when the overture is burning on the faces
of the people in the churches of the land.
That's all a way that I cut from the lives.
The day has come at last.
People that cry in the boulevard
Their eyes are blind they cry so hard.
How can you congratulate the people who destroyed the piece of mind
the silly people just like you and better too.
How can you keep turning when the overture is burning on the faces
of the people in the churches of the land.
That's all it seems there is only one dream.
The day has come at last.
That's all it seems there is only one dream.
The day has come at last.
What you have done makes me ashamed.
I'll blow it up and start again.
How can you congratulate the people who destroyed the piece of mind
the silly people just like you and better too.
How can you keep turning when the overture is burning in the faces
of the people in the churches of the land.
That's all it seems there is only one dream.
The day has come at last. <start> 
My temper's boiling like a thermal mire
My heart is burning like a forest fire for you
Sticking pins all over my effigy
The pain's no worse than the witch's heart you left with me
How can you fail to see my point of view
Or are your eyes a bitch's brew
At first I thought you came from paradise
then you split my world in two but I love you
So tell me it another way
listen what I have to say
Don't leave me for another day
Tell me that you're here to stay
There's something odd about the way I fell
Could it be those potions that you mixed up Oh so well
You spin your web but like a spider's mate
I served your purpose but for me it's not too late
You cut me deep but hat is how I learned
You're just my cup of gruel
Familiar faces that you left with me
Are they meant to be so cruel 'Cos I live you <start> Cold concrete apartments
Rise up from wet black asphalt
Below them a few carcasses
Of the long gone age of privacy
It takes a scary kind of illness
To design a place like this for pay
Downtown's an endless generic mall
Of video games and fast food chains
One by one
The little houses are bricked up and condemned
A subtle hint to move
Before the rats move in
This could be anywhere
This could be everywhere
Those new kids at school seem cool
But dad says not to talk to them
Stick to your old friends
They're not our kind
So now there's lots of fights
So many people I know
Come of age tense and bittereyed
Can't create so they just destroy
C'mon
Let's set someone's dog on fire
Empty plastic
Culture slum suburbia
Is a war zone now
Sprouting the kinds of gangs
We thought we'd left behind
This could be anywhere
This could be everywhere
Kids at school are taking sides
Along color and uniform lines
My dad's gone and bought a gun
He says he's fed up
With crime in this town
This could be anywhere
This could be everywhere
This could be anywhere
This could be everywhere
Anywhere
Everywhere
I hope I'm gone before it explodes
I linger late at night
Waiting for the bus
No amount of neon jazz
Could hide the oozing vibes of death
My dad's a vigilante now
He's bringing home these weirdass friends
Like the guy who fires blanks at his tv
When kojak's on
Or the guy who shows off his submachine gun
To his sixteenyearold daughter's friends
Whose sense of pride and hope
Is being in the police reserve
This could be anywhere
This could be everywhere  everywhere <start> YEAH
Looks like I'm doing time
Framed for another crime
Lost all my innocence
In shameless sin of a broken mind
But maybe I'm to blame
Cause things aren't gonna change
Held down and taken in
To hopeless life and pointless games
You lied you lied to me
You went and blew my cover
You got away with murder
Now I'm the criminal
Now I'm the criminal
Now I'm the criminal
Now I'm the criminal
But you gave me the key
Whoaoh
Now I'm the criminal
Now I'm the criminal
Now I'm the criminal
But you gave me the key
Would you say anything
Give me some reasoning
To why you stab me in the back
while I was covering
You for this stunt you pulled
Do you think I'm a fool
I'll tell them everything to
keep my life and record clean
You lied you lied to me
You went and blew my cover
You got away with murder
Now I'm the criminal
Now I'm the criminal
Now I'm the criminal
Now I'm the criminal
But you gave me the key
Whoaoh
Now I'm the criminal
Now I'm the criminal
Now I'm the criminal
But you gave me the key
Whoa oh
Gave me the key
Whoaoh
Bullets and enemies
Helmets and you me
Friend or future
Blaming it on the past
Shotguns and make believe
What you have become to me
Holding on to memories won't last
Your fame won't last
Now I'm the criminal
Now I'm the criminal
Now I'm the criminal
But you gave me the key
Whoaoh
I am the criminal
I am the criminal
I am the criminal
But you gave me the key
Now I'm the criminal
I am a criminal
Now I'm the criminal
But you gave me the key
Whoa oh
Gave me the key
Whoa oh
NOW I'M THE CRIMINAL <start> Instrumental <start> Silent weekend
My baby she gave it to me
Silent weekend
My baby she gave it to me.
She's actin' tough and hardy
She says it ain't my party
And she's leavin' me in misery.
Silent weekend
My baby she took me by surprise.
Silent weekend
My baby she took me by surprise.
She's rockin' and areelin'
Head up to ceiling
An' swinging with some other guys.
Silent weekend
Oh Lord I wish Monday would come.
Silent weekend
Oh Lord I sure wish Monday would come.
She's uppity she's rollin'
She's in the groove she's strolling
Over to the jukebox playin' deaf and dumb.
Well I done a whole lotta thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of cheatin'
And I maybe I did some just to please.
But I just walloped a lotta pizza after makin' our peace
Puts ya down on bended knees. <start> We all sit on the curb
And we stare at the rain in our boots
The car the clouds the sky
While Ishmael wraps himself in the sheet again
He'll clench the fists and close his eyes
I don't know how many times
I can loan him my cigarettes
When I don't even know if he's alive
Do prophets lie
It makes me feel less horrified
And my closet's filled with
All these endless accouterments
These shoes these scars
These shirts these ties
And these things I say to make myself feel good again
I'll speak I'll write I'll laugh I'll lie
I can't bear to sit here and drink myself sick again
Another night
When everything I know was just a lie
And I don't even know where I'll sleep tonight
I got nothing to do but stare at these walls
And take some time to screw my head on right
We all ended up alone wasted here at Silver Lake
We'll work we'll feed we'll change we'll try
I can't make any sense of this or you or anything
I'm wide awake and all our parents lied
It's not alright and all our words collide
Awake all night <start> Could I fly around the world
If my wings were really broke
And see so clearly
Drowning in grey smoke
I've got to stay quiet
But there's so much to say
If I could feel my arms
I'd push it all away
I know there is a future
And the best is still to come
When all I have are feelings
Why am I always
Wishing that a moment
Was really like an hour
Then every penny that I earn
Could balance out the dollar
Something that's spent on patience
Would make me patron saint
You know I might be ordained today
I guess I'll have to wait
Hurry up and wait
Gotta break it out
Gonna turn the lights on
See what's there for me
Take a look around
With an open shutter
There's a world to see <start> Chorus
Gone gone from New York City
Where you gonna go with a head that empty
Gone gone from New York City
Where you gonna go with a heart that gone
Down down to Mexico City
Got myself a lady she know how to treat me
Down down to Mexico City
Got myself a lady to lay me down lay me down
All my friends want you to know
I'm gonna miss you when I go
But I'll see you down the road
Meet me at the station way down low way down low
Chorus
Where you gonna go with a heart that gone
Chorus
Where you gonna go with a heart that gone
Where you gonna go with a heart that gone <start> i'm taking the last train home tonight
i'm drinking but i can't get drunker than this
i'm going home alone again with a checklist of my exbest friends
and a headache the size of your little white lies
blood dripping from my head into sore black eyes
place my head between my hood and the vent

killing time by killing myself slowly
drugs and booze and tobacco companies own me

but you meant what you did

i'm a dispensable character from your past
and i'm not feeling safe come on pick up the fucking phone
i can't accept when this night ends i'm going home alone
i'm running far away from my problems 
i'm not waiting for you to decide what to pack

i'm running far away from my problems

because its me vs. them <start> Yeah he was rolling in the rumor
That he was the loser king for a day yeah yeah
Ah she was kinda crosseyed
She was damaged in a beautiful way yeah yeah
He was addicted to her body
When she opened up her legs and her heart
She was good at all the simple things
She was addicted to the subtle way he'd rip her apart
It was a shameless use of charm
She was delighted with the promise of a life
Of being bored and annoyed
He was happy with the pictures
That he painted with distortion and noise
He was a sexaddicted user with a certain kind of flair
He did really not care that she was dumb and unaware
She was strong when they were naked and alone in the dark
It was a shameless use of charm
Everybody says they're looking for the fairy tale
No they are just looking for a way to fall
Everybody says they are looking for the true love lost
True love lost
He was big bigger than the life she knew
Back when she was good with being slow and confused
She was clean the best thing that he'd ever seen
She looked just like those girls he saw in playboy magazine
They were lost they were looking for the easy dream
Living high on borrowed time running low on selfesteem
They were down and were helpless to the rush
It felt just like a white drug
Everybody says they're looking for the fairy tale
No they are just looking for a way to fall
Everybody says they're looking for the happy ending
No they are just looking for a way to fall soft
Just like anyone they are just like everyone
They were looking for the easy way to have it all
Everybody says that they are looking for the true love lost
True love lost
True love lost
True love lost <start> I am a little beggar and a beggar I have been
For three score'r more in this little Isle of green
And I'm known from the Liffy down to Segue
And I'm known by the name of bold Donahue
Of all the trades agoin' now sure beggin is the best
When a man gets tired he can lay him down to rest
He can beg for his dinner when there's nothing left to do
Then just cut around the corner with his old Rigadoo
I slept in a barn way down in Curabawn
Awaitin' in for the mornin' I slept till the dawn
With the holes in the roof and the rain acomin' through
And the cats and the rats they were playin' peekaboo
Who should awaken but the woman of the house
With here white spotted apron and her calico blouse
She began to frighten when I said boo
Sayin' don't be afraid ma'am it's old Johnny Dhu
I met a little flaxy haired girl one day
Good morning little flaxy haired girl I say
Good morning little Beggar Man and how do you do
With your rags and your tags and your old Rigaioo
Buy a pair of leggings and a collar and a be
And a nice big lady I will fetch by and by
Buy a pair of goggles and I'll color them blue
And an old fashioned lady I will make her too
Over the fields with the pack on my back
Over the field with my great heavy sack
With the holes in my shoes and the toes a'peekin' through
Singin' skittilee rinkadoodle it's the old Johnny Dhu
Must be going to bed boys it's gettin' late at night
All the fire's all raked and up goes the light
And now you've heard the story of my old Rigadoo
It's Goodbye God be with you' sings the old Johnny Dhu <start> Wir fliehen voreinander der Himmel ist das Ziel
Das Leben will es anders. Zwei sind einer zuviel
Es brennt nicht mehr wir verschwenden unsre Zeit
Ich habe Angst mich zu verlieren wir sind einsam zu zweit
Bridge
Eine letzte Umarmung  bevor ich geh
Ein letzter Fick  bevor wir uns nicht wieder sehn
Ein letztes Wort  nach so langer Zeit
Ein letzter Blick und wir sind wieder allein
Chor
Zu viele Worte alles totgeredet
Zu viele Trume die nie in Erfllung gehen
Zu viele Trnen wir leben uns zu Tode
Zu viele Gedanken die sich um dich drehen
Wir hatten alles Zeit fr neue Episoden
Wenn man loslt stirbt man immer kleine Tode
Zu viele Fragen wieso und warum
Zu viele Narben unsre Zeit ist einfach um <start> It's the upshot
Of bein' the beauty queen
It's a damn good place to be seen
Oooh must be quite good
Wow must be so nice
Yeah yeah
Lucky dog
And I wanna be like Wendy
I wanna be like Wendy
Allstar tease
Bang 'em up bruiser queen
I wanna ride
On your trampoline
I wanna ride <start> This love is a curse that's fading away
If I could only see your eyes
I swear it may just change my mind
That this wasn't a dream a diamond I can't see
When we had everything but time
Why did we let it pass us by
The scent of your perfume left me consumed
And every promise that you made
Were they pure and true
'Cause when I looked beyond the mattress
I saw you for what you really were
And from that moment you've been a stranger and I've been a fool
This love is a curse that's fading away
If I could only see your eyes
I swear it may just change my mind
That this wasn't a dream a diamond I can't see
When we had everything but time
Why did we let it pass us by
There's a contract in a shoe box
And a ring that comes with a veil
You've shattered all my dreams you're a liar too
With there being so many ghosts inside
My stored past that haunts me
Will I be the one destroyed after this
Is it a sign of weakness
Can't do it anymore
I was drowning in the ocean
Now I'm floating to the shore
You left me to die there
Sinking in the core
This love is a sequence in a series of failures
This love is a curse that's fading away
If I could only see your eyes
I swear it may just change my mind
That this wasn't a dream a diamond I can't see
When we had everything but time
Why did we let it pass us by
You left me to die there
Sinking in the core
This love is a sequence in a series of failures <start> I've done it again
Something
Forced me to
Another piece in my collection
Of plays with you
I've done it again
Even
Several times
I guess it really takes a lot of beating
Before you cry
Alright i've been blind
But nothing ever happens
Some things won't ever change
And if I'm being inconsiderate
I'm ashamed
And it's always something different
The grass is greener on the other side
I guess i've always been a dreamer
With a dirty mind
But it's
Nobody's fault
And if
Someone arranged this for me
Getting his kicks out of it
It's not my fault
I've done it again
I was
Weak again
I guess I lost my chance of heaven
Before it came
Alright i've been blind
If something ever happens
And i've no chance to say goodbye
This is my way to say I'm sorry
One last time
But it's nobody's fault <start> This is not about age
Time served on the earth
Doesn't mean you grow in mind
This is not about god
Spiritual insinuations seem
To shock our nation
Come with me I'm fading
Underneath the lights
Come with me
Come with me
Come with me now
This is not about race
It's a decision to stop the
Division in your life
This is not about sex
We all know sex sells and
The whole world is buying
Come with me I'm fading
Underneath the lights
Come with me
Come with me
Come with me now
Can't you see the signs
See the signs now
Can't you see them
See the signs
You see them
All the signs we see them
Can't you see them <start> Just what you need to make you feel better
Just what you need to make you feel
Just what you need to make you feel better
Just what you need to make you feel
At the far end of your tether
And your thoughts won't fit together
So you sleep light or whatever
And the night goes on forever
The your mind change like the weather
Your in need of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether
Even clouds seem bright and breezy
'Cause the livin' is free and easy
See the rat race in a new way
Like you're walkin' up to a new day
It's a wise thing if you're clever
Take a lead from Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether
Find the end of the rainbow
Fly wherever the winds blow
Laugh at life like a sideshow
Just what you need to make you feel better
Satisfaction altogether
Guaranteed by Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether
Find the end of the rainbow
Fly wherever the winds blow
Laugh at life like a sideshow
Just what you need to make you feel better
Don't stop bringin' the girls round
Don't start havin' a showdown
Keep on handin' the jug round
All that you need is wine and good company <start> I got a line on you
We could be overdue
We could be trashed inside
We could be on the slide
No need to cool it out
Just one two three and shout
You just can't push me
You just can't push me
You just can't push me
Around
You got to help me in
You want to be my sin
You want to be my dream
You want to fill my dreams yea
No need to feel it out
Just another something
To forget about
You just can't push me
You just can't push me
You just can't push me
Around 
I got a line on you
We could be overdue
We could be trashed inside
We could be on the slide
You just can't push me
You just can't push me
You just can't push me
Around <start> I was so much an outcast
No one ever liked me cause I wasn't wanted
I was so different from the rest of them all
Fucked up on the drugs from all the speed
And I never got no sleep
Cause I kept on trippin' over what they said
And everything that my mom said made me mad
And everything that my dad said made me sad
Why am I even trying
I'm crying out I'm crying out
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
Spinning round spinning round I've fallen down
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
You keep shootin' those glances
Relating to the rawness I'm a fuckin' lost kid
Trying so hard to become just like me talk like me walk like me
You keep trippin' on everything I wear every time I swear
Even when it comes to my hair
It seems like you don't have the time to relate to my kind
I'm not a dope pullin' your life
Why am I even trying
I'm crying out I'm crying out
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
Spinning round spinning round I've fallen down
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
I'm trippin' out I'm trippin' out
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
Draw me down breaking down
I've hit the ground
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
Your dreamy dreads
Are you still tripping on me
You're drinking dread
Are you still tripping on me
Now do you drift
Are you still tripping on me
Now do you drift
Why are you tripping on me
I was so much an outcast
Find a way to make it right
I was so much an outcast
I can't seem to find a way to make it right
I was so much an outcast
No ever liked me
I can't find a way to make it right
I was so much an outcast
I can't seem to find a way to make it right
Why am I even trying
I'm crying out I'm crying out
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
Spinning round spinning round I've fallen down
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
I'm trippin' out I'm trippin' out
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
Draw me down breaking down
I've hit the ground
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
I'm crying out I'm crying out I'm crying out freaking out
Draw me down breaking down

I cannot seem to keep from freaking out <start> I got me a deuce and a quarter babe
She will ride you right
Pick you up about half past nine
We can ride all night
I came up from the country baby
City's where I stay
Got me a deuce and a quarter babe
That's all I got to say
She's a Detroit made
Deuce and a quarter babe
She's a Detroit made
Deuce and a quarter babe
Bigblock she'll do all the work
So we can ride in style
Leather on those bucket seats
Carpet double pile
Chrome that takes the moonlight on
Sea to shining sea
You can hear those glass pipes rumble to the Statue of Liberty
She's a Detroit made
Deuce and a quarter babe
She's a Detroit made
Deuce and a quarter babe
Now when I first got out of high school
I drove an old farm truck
All the girls they walked right by me
Didn't even say good luck
Now I ride my  they all want to be my friend

If you can wait till then
She's a Detroit made
Deuce and a quarter babe

Just about every cat I know wants in my coupe de ville
I pay half the price I get twice as nice
And they still have to pay that bill
I can't say everything's okay riding in my car
But I got me a deuce and a quarter baby
She goes like a shooting star
She's a Detroit made
Deuce and a quarter babe
She's a Detroit made
Deuce and a quarter babe
Detroit made
Deuce and a quarter babe
Detroit made
Deuce and a quarter babe <start> I was a wandering soul
Traveling a well worn road
A sinner so far from home
No second chance in sight
I heard You call my name
I felt You lift my shame
And I made a vow that day
That I'd spend the rest of my life
Loving my Jesus
Showing my scars
Telling my story of how mercy
Can reach You where You are
And I pray the whole world hears
The cry of my heart
Is to see all the ones I love
Loving my Jesus
Sin tries to make you hide
Whispers that same old lie
Keep all your pain inside
'Cause no one will understand
The last thing this lost world needs
Is someone I'm trying to be
Truth that has set me free
Is that I'm just a broken man
Loving my Jesus
Showing my scars
Telling my story of how mercy
Can reach You where You are
And I pray the whole world hears
The cry of my heart
Is to see all the ones I love
Loving my Jesus
When all is said and done
When my last song's been sung
I stand face to face with the One
Who gave all for me
May all I have to show
Be all that mattered most
Making Your great name known
Let this be my only legacy
Loving my Jesus
Showing my scars
Telling my story of how mercy
Can reach You where You are
And I pray the whole world hears
The cry of my heart
Is to see all the ones I love
Oh all the ones I love
Loving my Jesus <start> Melancholia caressed my stretched hand
And together we came
dancing to the sound of a shining vertigo.
For we are one
yet one is nothing
Come on walk through this open womb
One little step at a time.
Oblique visions of captivity
Swirl silently around us
As we join hands with Desire
For we are nothing
and nothing is One
Walking through the open wombs of time
we attend the great and secret masquerade. <start> Stubbed my toe running to your house
Broke my leg running to your house
Lost my head running to your house
Broke my crown running to your house
Oh my God
Is this what it feels like to be in love
Is this what it feels like
Oh my love
It feels like God
Just you shut my mouth
Just try and shut my mouth
Stubbed my toe running to your house
Broke my leg running to your house
Lost my head running to your house
Broke my crown running to your house
Well oh my God
Is this what it feels like to be in love
Is this what it feels like
Oh my love
It feels like God
Just you shut my mouth
Just try and shut my mouth
Mad pilot fly
Just try and shut my mouth
Mad pilot fly <start> So I will pave this road till glory
Sets our broken spirit free
From every cross soaked nail pours endless rain
With tears no eyes should see
But they could fill our highest ocean
And the rivers in between
With every blade that flowers must grow then drown
With love our cruelest sea
So with a wonder an' a wild desire
I will crawl from under every weight
With a wonder an' a wild desire
Bless the day it was I shared your name
Yesterday forever speaks your grave
Hailed the shower from the broadside
To the heavens down below
Draw one last breathe from your famine ship
Sink the hunger in us all
Shake the hand that speaks of freedom
Kiss hate one final bow
'Til each twilight falls then rests till dawn
Where tomorrows never sleep
So with a wonder an' a wild desire
I will crawl from under every weight
With a wonder an' a wild desire
Bless the day it was I shared your name
Each word forever speaks your grave
And of the fool we shall not mention
That depraves the cries of youth
Drag not your strength from the government
But from the voices they abused
So with a wonder an' a wild desire
I will crawl from under every weight
With a wonder an' a wild desire
Bless the day it was I shared your name
Yesterday forever speaks your grave
Only time will tell when this reign of hell
Shall wither in defeat
Seperate the bread thet they forgot to share
To the mouths still left to feed
Though his body ached
Then disappeared
Into the ground now seeds
He said I I'll always comfort thee
So I will pave this road till glory
Watch as our broken spirits soar
Resonate with perfect reason
Shut life's last gloomy door
So with a wonder an' a wild desire
I will cross from under every weight
With a wonder an' a wild desire
Bless the day it was I shared your name
With a wonder an' a wild desire
I will cross from under every weight
With a wonder an' a wild desire
Bless the day it was I shared your name
Yesterday forever speaks your grave <start> Raat Din Main Sochada Haan Tere Baare

Tere Bin Aida Sarda e nayi

Raat Din Main Sochada Haan Tere Baare
Kehnda Nahin Main Laike Aawan Chaand Taare <start> Sitting here all away from you
I've tried so hard I don't know what I should do
It's all been triedand all has failed
To bring me back to where I once fell

I just want to find my way back to you
Where love is strong and feels brand new
I just want to find my way back to you
Where love is strong and feels brand new
I'm so tired that I can't fight anymore
It seems as though I've turned and shut my own door
I've prayed so hard hoping that you care
But then I turn and find you are there

Yes I've been to this place before
Out on this ledge so afraid to look down
Broken down and torn
I find my way to you
 <start> i have traveled alone to be here
and now underneath the faltering clear
i dream seamless perpetual night
so deep aching for the dawn to arrive
it's coming it's coming
it's come and i feel i'm close to something
divine
something eternal and pure
...divine
nothing that i've seen before
it feels like i'm falling
and forever is a long way down
yet slowly spilling like riverflow
at the mouth of the shore
if we run into tomorrow
it would be the highest low
it's as far as we go
but we die together
we live believing the light returns
and we'll never be whole until then
we're closer we're closer
we're close and i feel we're touching something
divine
something eternal and pure
...divine
closer than ever before <start> Better take care
I think I better go I better get a room
Better take care of me
Again and again
I think about this and I think about personal history
Better take care
I breathe so deep when the movie gets real
When the star turns round
Again and again
He looks me in the eye says he's got his mind on a countdown
  
Forever
I'm screaming that I'm gonna be living on till the end of time
Forever
The sky splits open to a dull red skull
And my head hangs low 'cause it's all over now
And there's never gonna be enough money
And there's never gonna be enough drugs
And I'm never ever gonna get old
There's never gonna be enough bullets
There's never gonna be enough sex
And I'm never ever gonna get old
So I'm never ever gonna get high
And I'm never ever gonna get low
And I'm never ever gonna get old
Better take care
The moon flows on to the edges of the world because of you
Again and again
And I'm awake in an age of light living it because of you
Better take care
I'm looking at the future solid as a rock because of you
Again and again
want to be here and I want to be there
Living just like you living just like me
Forever
Putting on my gloves and bury my bones in the marshland
Forever
Think about my soul but I don't need a thing just the ring of the bell in the pure clean air
And I'm running down the street of life
And I'm never gonna let you die
And I'm never ever gonna get old
And I'm never ever gonna get
I'm never ever gonna get
I'm never ever gonna get old
And I'm never ever gonna get
And I'm never ever gonna get
Never ever gonna get old <start> She likes hair bands on satellite radio
But I was in one so it's a little too close to home
And she can dance like she's done it for a living before
And I kinda dance like I've been shot in the leg for sure
She's got all that she's got but she don't got me
So baby lay down nobody is around
Watching as our bodies slowly sinking to the ground
Throw away your phone and your inhibitions too
There's a hundred dirty things that I wanna say to you
Never let me come and never let me go
I got you where I want you so I wanna say it slow
This is as good a night as any to say that you want me too
She likes Mary Jane but she says she doesn't like the smell
She's got a baby and by the way she walks I can tell
She's got a birth mark on the inside of her thigh
Ask me how I know about the inside of her thigh
She knows the Japanese alphabet but she don't know me yeah
So baby lay down nobody is around
Watching as our bodies slowly sinking to the ground
Throw away your phone and your inhibitions too
There's a hundred dirty things that I wanna do to you
Never let me come and never let me go
I got you where I want you so I wanna say it slow
This is as good a night as any to say that you want me too
She's got all that she wants but she don't want me
So baby lay down nobody is around

This is as good a night as any to say that you want me too <start> I only dreamed that I would find
A loving heart an open mind to see the real me
And I hoped that you would be the one
A chance to talk a chance to grow
I'll take the risk let my feelings flow
I've found the words I need to say
Suddenly you're seeing me just the way I am
Suddenly you're hearing me
So I'm talking just as fast as I can to you
Suddenly every part of me needs to know every part of you
Now I know that you are mine
You bring me your love and peace of mind
You see the real me and I know that you're the key
Suddenly you're seeing me just the way I am
Suddenly you're hearing me
So I'm talking just as fast as I can to you
Suddenly every part of me needs to know every part of you
Suddenly you're seeing me just the way I am
Suddenly you're hearing me
So I'm talking just as fast as I can to you
Suddenly awkwardly
You're all I want all I need you to be
Suddenly every part of me needs to know every part of you
Just you it's you <start> Words and music by Arlo Guthrie
In the event of my demise
Be sure to include this statement
When you are bent on closing my eyes
Thinking about what my life meant
Alone on a hill back in '
Things looked a lot like changing
Singing our songs that we harmonized
Dreaming of worlds rearranging
And I don't know why I'm singing tonight
Maybe it's time someone told you
Just because you say you've seen the light
Doesn't mean nobody sold you
I can remember all of your smiles
During the demonstrations
Taking on what seemed like the whole world
Igniting the hearts of our nations
And together we sang our victory songs
Though we were worlds apart
Every thing then has now passed away
Except for the love in my heart
Sitting at home on computerized beds
Tryine to come to conclusions
Seeing reflections from rosecolored heads
Ignoring the states of illusion
Drunk in a world of material wealth
No one can notice you falling
Fantastic flights once good tor your health
Now make you deaf to your calling
And all alone the prophet groans
With words as yet unseen
Who'll be awake when the master returns
Who will be lost in their dreams
So in the event of my demise
e sure to include this statement
Only the words of love kept alive
Are worthy of not being wasted <start> Hey Joe where you goin' with that gun of your hand
Hey Joe I said where you goin' with that gun in your hand oh

Goodbye everybody

That time I saw you girl across the floor
Just one look was all it took
Since then I've been so dawn
But baby do you wanna be with me
Everything you do
Everything is blue
Everytime we touch
Can you feel the rush
We're never alone
Get into the zone
Where everything you do
Paints my love in blue
Born into a world that never sleeps at night
Put a side the thorns the troubles on your mind
And through the fog we meet each other on the other side
And when you're here with me
Then blue is all we see
But baby do you wanna be with me
Everything you do
Everything is blue
Everytime we touch
Can you feel the rush
We're never alone
Get into the zone
Where everything you do
Paints my love in blue
I wanna feel your body close to mine
I wanna scream your name out through the night

Y tienes el cambio a tu favor
Y ya casi no recuerdas tu pueblo

no te llaman la atencion mas

y es mas grande la ciudad
Vives en una gran ciudad 
Y tienes el cambio a tu favor
y ya casi no recuerdas la nia
aquella que murio de amor
Pues donde vives las mujeres son bellas
todas parecen modelos
pero cuando buscas su alma te das cuenta
que la perdieron frente a los espejos
Pero aqui tenemos grande el corazon
y nos brillan mas los ojos que una estrella
y aunque no llego la industrializacion 
tenemos llenas de flores las praderas
Vives en una gran ciudad 
junto al relog con la campana
que te recuerda que el tiempo vuela
que el tiempo vuela y que te alcanza
y corres detras de la vida
pues la vida se te escapa
pues por correrla se te olvida la vida
como se te olvido un dia tu casa
Pero aqui tenemos grande el corazon
Y nos brillan mas los ojos que una estrella
y aunque no llego la industrializacion 
tenemos llenas de flores las praderas
Vuelve cuando quieras Aqui esta tu tierra
Vuelve cuando quieras Aqui esta tu tierra
Aqui esta tu tierra <start> You call me crying
You call me crying
And time just stopped
My heart can't beat when you're unhappy
I want you to know
Even when I'm gone
I keep you with me yes I do
I'd do anything to take that pain
And hear you laughing
Harmony
Some day you'll see things the way they really are
But now it's time for your sweet eyes to be softly dreaming
From my old heart to your little soul
You're the best thing I've ever known
You deserve more
I was so low
And I'd known that nothing was right yeah
Even the lie I made myself was over
So if you're lonely
And feeling unsure
Know that I love you oh I love you
And even when we're apart
I still hear you laughing
Harmony
You'll understand in a little while
I want your heart to be free
Then dream about what makes you happy
So from my love to your little soul
You're the best thing I've ever known
My love you're always with me
Know you'll always be
Always forever my love
You're my little soul child
My love you're always with me
This whole world in this whole world
Always forever my love

A sinister kid is a kid who
Runs to meet his maker
A drop dead sprint from the day he's born
Straight into his makers arms
And that's me that's me
The boy with the broken halo
That's me that's me
The devil won't let me be
I got a tortured mind
And my blade is sharp
A bad combination
In the dark
If I kill a man
In the first degree
Baby would you
Would you flee with me
A sinister kid is a kid who
Runs to meet his maker
A drop dead sprint from the day he's born
Straight into his makers arms
And that's me that's me
The boy with the broken halo
That's me that's me
The devil won't let me be
A sinister kid is a kid who

You say it's all because of me
Tilting your head so you can catch my eye
Promising things I can't believe
Why can't you recognize the need
I don't wanna be the one who's always left behind you
Some people live on memories
I don't wanna be the one who's always left to find you find you
If I could make everything work out right
I'd bring my photographs to life
It's hard to figure out reality
When you're consumed by compromise
Why can't you recognize the need
I don't wanna be the one who's always left behind you
Some people live on memories
I don't wanna be the one who's always left to find you find you
And now I can't believe you won my sympathy
I told you I'm not coming back
The lies that fall between the cracks
And now I can't believe you won my sympathy
I told you I'm not coming back
The lies that fall between the cracks
Why can't you recognize the need
I don't wanna be the one who's always left behind you
Some people live on memories
I don't wanna be the one who's always left to find you find you

I don't believe I love you
Look at the fool I've been
I don't believe I'm sinkin' <start> Today the thought of leaving you wandered through my mind
And all the sleeping memories that we made
I've thought about the love we knew that one day upped and died
It wasn't even strong enough to fade
Soon as I am strong enough I pull myself away
You little love me long enough and hurt me anyway
Then you come to me and stay and love me one more time
I changed my mind
 guitar  steel 
I've been good and true to you but you don't even care
I'd be better off if you'll just turn and gone
But then I've thought of losin' you is more than I can bear
Yes I am too weak to make it on my own
Soon as I am strong enough...
I changed my mind <start> Tasha's got a room at the county shelter
The cops took her there when her mama got hauled away
Little brother and her can't even stay together
She cries each night wondering why it's gotta be this way
And she says I wish I was anyone but me
Yeah she'd pack her life in a heartbeat for a little change of scenery
And she keeps looking for a better place
Somewhere she can wear a smile upon her face
A home to welcome with a warm embrace
There's no way to disguise her lonely eyes
Looking for a better place
Bobby's doing time in youth detention
Pulled a switch blade knife on some boy making fun at school
And all he wanted was a little attention
And a temporary escape from the ridicule
And now he's in real deep with the freaks and the criminals
And he wonders when his time is up if he'll know himself at all
And he keeps dreaming of a better place
Somewhere he can have a little room to make mistakes
A home to help him wash the past away
Oh he don't need too much just a little love
In a better place
In a better place
Jamie's got a room in a story brick home
Daddy makes a lotta money mama keeps all her laundry clean
And she's got a  Abercrombie outfit on
Drives a brand new car that she got when she turned 
Still she spends every night getting high with her socalled friends
And she's dropping hundred dollar bills on quarterbags says she's never coming down again
And she keeps looking for a better place
Failing to realize how good she's got it made
Her loving home she don't appreciate
Oh it's crazy but it's true she doesn't have a clue
She's living in a better place
In a better place
In a better place
We're all lookin were all lookin for a better place
Woah a better place
We're all lookin were all lookin for a better place <start> Oh yes

The snow's coming down

I'm watching it fall

Watching the people around

Baby please come home

The church bells in town

They're ringing a song

Oh the happiest sound

Baby please come home
They're singing Deck the Halls
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

Pretty lights on the tree

And I'm watching them shine

You should be here with me

Baby please come home
They're singing deck the halls
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year <start> All around me

See him gun in hand

Better watch that man
See him gun in hand

Use a Kleenex
Wipe out sex Kleenex
Better than love Kleenex
John Paul George Kleenex
Governments use Kleenex
Use a Kleenex solve world problems
Better blow your nose right now
Maybe is it you

Better watch that man see him gun in hand
What you gonna do next

Use a Kleenex
Wipe out sex Kleenex
Better than love kleenex
Trade Unions use Kleenex
Governments use Kleenex

Two things to say
Because Canada's so far away
Two things to say
That is where I want to lay <start> Die Sonne scheint als htte sie Van Gogh gemalt
Und auf dem Asphalt steht die Luft
Die Blumen blhn als wrden sie dafr bezahlt
Doch das lsst mich so kalt wie ihr Duft
Zu viele Frauen zu viel Geld viel zu viel was mir auch viel zu gut gefllt
Mein Leben ist die Hlle  ich fhle mich so leer
Immer laut immer bunt ist auf die Dauer nicht gesund
Mein Leben ist die Hlle ich kann nicht mehr
Ich brauch kein Haus aus purem Gold ich hab das alles nicht gewollt
Ich brauch nur etwas Ruhe das wr nicht schlecht
Ich will nicht mssen was ich muss ich hasse diesen berfluss
Ich brauch nur etwas Ruhe  dann komm ich schon zurecht
Ich kann doch nichts dafr dass ich ein Glckspilz bin
Und jedes Herz gewinn Tag fr Tag
Das ist der Fluch der Menschen die zu gut aussehn
Es hrt niemand hin wenn ich was sag
Und noch ein Flirt noch ein Kuss  nur noch einmal vgeln dann ist wirklich Schluss
Mein Leben ist die Hlle wo ist der Notausgang
Zu viel Sex zu wenig Schlaf  wofr werd ich denn nur bestraft
Mein Leben ist die Hlle schon viel zu lang
Ich brauch kein Haus aus purem Gold ich hab das alles nie gewollt
Ich brauch nur etwas Ruhe und etwas Zeit
Das Leben ist zum Lachen da drum nehm ich Psychopharmaka
Ich brauch nur etwas Ruhe und Einsamkeit
In jeder zweiten Zeitschrift steht wie gut es jedem Menschen geht
Der immer alles haben kann
Die Wahrheit ist ich glaub nicht mehr daran ... <start> It would take a month of sundays
To understand you now
Lord knows I'll make it one day
And I hope he tells me how
It seems impossible
But strangest thoughts come true
And a shadow of a doubt just crossed my mind
Kinda right on cue
Had a shadow of a doubt last night
When you walked into view
What could I do
Company convivial
The drink went to my head
Conversation trivial
Don't ask me what I said
Could it have been pure coincidence
The moisture in your eye
But the shadow of a doubt just crossed my mind
When you said Hi
And a shadow of a doubt remains
However hard I try
How hard I try
What's passed is history
I never wish to read
You're the very last thing I want
The very first thing I need
What kind of spirit
Made me feel that warm inside
When a shadow of a doubt appeared
To wash away my pride
And a shadow of a doubt was here
When you stood by my side
Right by my side
What's passed is history
I never wish to read
You're the very last thing I want
The first thing that I need
The nosey next door neighbours
Would have laughed if they could see
That mutual ecquaintance
Introducing you to me
Never dreamed that you'd be there
Or are you staying away
Yet that shadow of a doubt
Has grown much stronger night and day
And the shadow of a doubt
Won't let me go
What can I say
What can I say <start> In this days of hate and division
It's a gift to have someone you can trust
Someone to share every little thing with
The good times and the daily musts
Right now the sky may seem heavy
But I know the clouds will break up
From here we can only go forward
You and me we keep the dream alive
And with you it all seems so easy
It's all worth givin' a try.
And when I've been away I've got someone to come home to
You know that means a lot to me
You pick me up when everything is so slow
When I'm knee deep knee deep in wet concrete.
Right now the sky may seem heavy
But I know the clouds will break up
From here we can only go forward
You and me we keep the dream alive
And with you it all seems so easy
It's all worth givin' a try
So I'll give it a try
From here we can only go forward
You and me we keep the dream alive
And with you it all seems so easy
It's all worth givin' a try <start> I got some oil and some matches
You know I will do anything for you
So whether for light or for ashes
All of us burn for something
The greatest risk the greatest wonder
Some of the time we are stolen
Most of us live our lives as thieves
So how could you know that I could be trusted
How could you know that I just know that I won't leave
Always waiting for someone to be sure
Always praying that we'll be ready for
The greatest wish the going under
The greatest risk the greatest wonder
You cannot give somebody joy
But you can find it by trying
You can't save someone from death
But you can love them while they're dying
Love them while they're dying <start> I looked your way You looked your best Looked like a million More or less You were so carefully undressed And I'm not impressed But you're just skin deep You're just skin deep Like you change your clothes Just like all the rest Because you change your mind Prefab perspective poise and pose But it's just skin deep And that's as far as it goes In it comes and out it goes ReflectionObsession It's all done with mirrors And painted smiles The hype of style I looked away But you're just skin deep I could have cried You always have me hypnotized And looks can lie Sure would like to know what your like inside You're just skin deep So why even try <start> These blood shot eyes they don't compromise
And this dry cottonmouth spits out words she can't figure out
And I'm drowning on my bed and the phone falls out of reach
We'll I am like a dead man washed upon the beach
Hold my head down under water
And pull me up just to watch me suffer
Headlights from your car
Chase the shadows on my wall that kept me comfort
But she loves to watch me suffer
And these blood shot eyes they don't recognize
And the look on your face you always seem so damn out of place
And I'm crashed on your bed and your hand falls out of reach
I am like a dead man washed upon the beach
Hold my head down under water
And pull me up just to watch me suffer
Headlights from your car
Chase the shadows on my wall that kept me comfort
We'll I am on my last nerve in case you haven't heard
I burn with every word
I close my eyes you kick me in the side
But I am still alive I am still alive I said I'm still alive
Hold my head down under water
And pull me up just to watch me suffer
She holds my head down under water
But she pulls me up just to watch me suffer
I am what she thinks that I am I've become her dead man <start> Life is short filled of stuff
Don't know what for
I ain't had enough
I learned all I know
By the age of nine
But I could better myself
If I could only find
Some new kind of kick
Something I ain't had
Some new kind of buzz
I wanna go hog mad
Lookin' and lookin' and lookin'
For something I ain't had before
I'm lookin' and lookin'
I'm lookin' and lookin'
I'm lookin' and lookin'
To find some new kind of kick
To find some new kind of kick
Gimme a kick
Like baby needs mom
Like Susie needs dick
This baby needs
Some new kind of kick
I want some new kind of kick
I want some new kind of kick
I want some new kind of kick
I'm lookin' and lookin' and lookin'
For something I ain't had before
I'm lookin and lookin'
I'm lookin and lookin'
I'm lookin and lookin'
To find some new kind of kick
Life is short filled of stuff
Don't know what for
I ain't had enough
I learned all I know
By the age of nine
But I could better myself
If I could only find
I want some new kind of kick
I want some new kind of kick
I want some new kind of kick <start> Oh come crush me now
Don't leave
No one has won this war this time
No don't sleep tonight
I'm burnt and ready for fire
Don't leave me up alarmed
And ready to die
Come on it's war come on
Come on come on come on
Come on it's war come on
Please I'm almost done
Don't retreat
I've loaded my gun with blood
Here the dust roll over the floor
Why must you sleep
Come crush me now unarmed
And ready to die
Come on it's war come on
Come on come on come on
Come on it's war come on 
Come on fight me come on
Come on it's war come on
You look so peaceful when you sleep
Beautiful creep
It's such an easy way to choose you lose
It's getting late
Come on it's war come on 
Come on come on come on
Come on fight me come on
Come on come on come on
Come on it's war come on 
Come on come on come on
Come on it's war come on
You look so peaceful when you sleep
Beautiful creep
It's such an easy way to choose you lose <start> Fever is growing in their veins
Flashlights cold eyes
Back to the start
Take a coin for your game
The game sucks your luck
Press all buttons down to play
Like a drug  like a derailing train
Falling in the trap of these games
Chorus
Living in a world of shame and glory
Living in a world of shame and lies
Living in a world of shame and glory
It's a flight into other lies it's a lie
The coin is your key in a nightmare world
Machines and dreams
Luck for a minute you're a loser in life
Once more high score
All our misery
Illusions of reality
Don't let them take possession of you
Chorus
Living in a world of shame and glory
Living in a world of shame and lies
Living in a world of shame and glory
It's a flight into other lies it's a lie <start> You have no place yet to be.
I have not seen what you see.
Live through hell you've never known.
You will know what you've been shown.
Take what you can from this place.
Watch all the freaks fall from grace.
As the world dies in your eyes.
You will be shown all it's lies.
Standing where I should not be.
Seeing all the horor before my mind was free.
Beyond what I could see.
Standing where I should not be.
Watch them melt into the sand.
Drip and twist into your hand.
Scratch pick the flesh from your face.
Your head gone without a trace. <start> 
Forgive me lord
Please those years when I ignored you hmm
Forgive them lord
Those that feel they can't afford you hmm
Help me lord please
To rise above this dealing hmm
Help me lord please
To love you with more feeling hmm
At both ends of the road
To the left and the right
Above and below us
Out and in there's no place that you're not in
Oh won't you hear me lord




At both ends of the road
To the left and the right
Above and below us
Out and in there's no place that you're not in
Oh won't you hear me lord
Help me lord please
To rise a little higher hmm
Help me lord please
To burn out this desire hmm
Hear me lord please
Hear me lord please
Oh won't you please please
Hear me lord
Oh hear me lord
Hear me lord
Oh won't you please please
Hear me lord
My lord my lord my lord

Now won't you please 
My lord my lord my lord
Won't you please 
Oh hear me lord hear me lord
 <start> Did you see the moon tonight
Did it shine the way I asked it to
By the time it made it's way to you
Instead of me
Inside your room tonight
It will dance across your floor
Make you remember more
Then you might want it to
But I want you to
Remember me
If you see the moon tonight
I hope it finds you all alone
Maybe sitting by the phone
Kinda sad and glad to be unhappy
'Cause your missing me
Like I'm missing you
If you see the moon tonight
If you do don't close your eyes
You might get a big surprise
I might just fly across the ocean
And materialize
Then I could tell you that it's true
That I'm the one who turned it white to blue
Just for you just for you <start> Rudy was my friend
But he had an end
Oh yes I did send him into an eternal sleep
I'm so sorry boy
No longer my toy
Oh my pride and joy
You no longer go beep
Rudy my electronic penguin
I'm so sorry boy I hope you rest in peace
Oh my Rudy how I miss you
Maybe we'll meet in a better world
Filled with penguin boys and penguin girls
But until then my love for you will never cease
And I just hope that you will rest in peace <start> I got a chip on my shoulder
You can't knock off
If you and make me run
I'll just walk
The system tries to legislate
Can't break the wings that we wear
Yellow brick road leads to nothin'
I don't care
If I bleed in buckets
Would I be your debutante
Tell me what more
What more do you want
Dollar signs are for the blind
You can't break destiny
You can take away my freedom
But you know I'll always be free
You can all say that you love me
But love is just a four letter word
Talkin' bout me degeneration
Sounds so absurd
If I dropped my disguise
Would you put up a front
Tell me what more
What more do you want
It ain't about the fortune
It ain't about the vice
As long as I got the groove
Then I'll be alright
Still got a chip on my shoulder
You can call it attitude
Long as you label me nothing
Then I've got nothing to lose
You can all say that you love me
But love is just a four letter word
And talkin' bout my degeneration
Sounds so absurd
If I dropped my disguise
Would you put up a front
Tell me what more
What more do you want
Power and glory
Freedom and love
If I got it all then
What more do you want <start> Tanta parla acerca de acabar con el sistema me da risa
tanto verso aburrido repetido y sin sentido
que llega inevitable inevitable inevitablemente a ser repelente
ese papo se repite una dos diez y cien mil veces
El sistema ja de que carajo me hablas
el sistema no existe si no estamos vos yo
y eso nos jode a los dos o pensas que zafas
todo el mundo atrs el problema esta ac aunque parezca no estar
No existe un principio y tampoco un final

Y los hijos de perra

en ellos y en todo lo dems

Pa pa

El educado hocico de los lderes polticos
escupe solo mentiras
cerdos pintados para la televisin

de tanto predicar <start> Oh these little rejections how they add up quickly
One small sideways look and I feel so ungood
Somewhere along the way I think I gave you the power to make
Me feel the way I thought only my father could
Oh these little rejections how they seem so real to me
One forgotten birthday I'm all but cooked
How these little abandonment's seem to sting so easily
I'm  again am I  for good
I can feel so unsexy for someone so beautiful
So unloved for someone so fine
I can feel so boring for someone so interesting
So ignorant for someone of sound mind
Oh these little protections how they fail to serve me
One forgotten phone call and I'm deflated
Oh these little defenses how they fail to comfort me
Your hand pulling away and I'm devastated
When will you stop leaving baby
When will I stop deserting baby
When will I start staying with myself
Oh these little projections how they keep springing from me
I jump my ship as I take it personally
Oh these little rejections how they disappear quickly
The moment I decide not to abandon me <start> In Louisville Kentucky name of Cassius Clay
Fought my way up to see another day
Seven Incomprehensible 'gainst ol' Sonny Liston
Took my title from him but I kept on my mission
Float like a butterfly sting like a bee
Float like a butterfly sting like a bee
You know you got me dancing
I'm the champion of the ring
Know my name is Muhammad Ali
No George Foreman ever called me quitter
No Viet Cong ever called me nigger
Threw my gold medal in the Ohio river
I won for the 'Land of the Free'
Kumbaya
Float like a butterfly sting like a bee
Float like a butterfly sting like a bee
You know you got me dancing
I'm the champion of the ring
Know my name is Muhammad Ali
Yes my mind is free and all you
Heaven never forgive
Yes in time you'll see
I am the most beautiful
I am the most beautiful body yeah
I know my destination and I and I know the truth
Yes I am The Louisville Lip that you been talkin' to
All my life I been dancing like Incomprehensible
Float like a butterfly sting like a bee
Float like a butterfly sting like a bee
Float like a butterfly sting like a bee
You know you got me dancing
I'm the champion of the ring
Know my name is Muhammad Ali <start> Feel feel the wounds
Hold my hands cradling all the souls
And wait wait for peace
As my love makes its way shattering
My heart it hurts
'Cause it never catches its breath
I'm still staying when I should have left
Come to where the waters meet the shore
I'll be there and I will stay leaving you

Listen to
All my dreams love that lasts pain that heals
And take take your time but move so fast
'Cause hearts move on and this is real
This time it means something
Dreams will fall love will spill <start> I'll take another photograph
Before the old one fades
It reminds me of those things that past
And quickly passed away
But it comes on in the early night
Creeping up on you
Those scenes of devastation
Crushing down on cue
These days are growing colder now
The light is growing dim
August was a heavy month
And now the nights are drawing in
Poor Baby Blue's wrapped up again
Inside her final pain
I'd help her if I could I say
She puts us all to shame
Alright alright I know I've got a lot
Left to answer for
But am I the only one to blame
And anyway who's keeping score
But the grass seems so much brighter now
She's spilled her blood again
August was a heavy month
Wash it down September rain
Baby Blue picks up her life tonight
And rushes for the Chelsea train
All the stars shine down on her tonight
And August was a heavy month
The photograph is cracked and torn
From being picked up put down
Like some holy relic
Whose worshippers are found
Searching through their sacred books
For the holy grail of why
But the total sum of knowledge
Knows no more than you or I
Alright alright says Baby Blue
Who doesn't really understand
August was a heavy month
But winter came at last.

taken from the album Deep In the Heart of Knowhere <start> All I wanted was to find my way
All I wanted was to save the day
All I wanted was to be your friend
That's all I wanted in the end
From the corner of my eye
I saw you flaming across the sky
There was nothing I could do
Than to burn up next to you
There's a fire burning in me
It's a storm bound to win me over
People run December morning
They run to sound the warning
Over
When we lay down in the grass
All my feelings turn to ash
All the pieces of my soul
Heart to harden into coal
In the middle of the stormy weather
When our bones start to fuse together
All the protons and unnamed neutrons
Explode in me
There's a fire burning in me
It's a storm bound to win me over
People run December morning
They run to sound the warning
Over it's over
Sound the warning
Sound the warning
Sound the warning
Sound the warning <start> A little hating in the morning time
a little hating come around noon
Ain't no remorse
All that you think
Ain't no regret
All that you do
Jesus
Hell Yeah What do we do
Jesus
Can you hear us screaming up above
Lord
I guess we were just born to lose
A little hating on my TV screen
A little hating in the news that I read
Lay to rest a soul so kind
Rewarding the wrong
Feeding The Twisted Mind
You Lookin' At Me
Forever hurt
Forever bleed
It ain't black
It ain't white
It ain't wrong
Lord knows it ain't right <start> Passion for lust Despair and distrust
Connect at cost Kill Cupid with rust.
Pity the ones Salvage and strung
Reflect at loss Fill stupid and stung.
Plenty of fish Twisted and stitched.
Infect the rot Luck forever missed.
Sink with me..........
Sink with me..........
Sink with me..........
Sink with me..........
Sink..... Sink.....
Passion for lust Despair and distrust
Connect at cost Kill Cupid with rust.
Pity the ones Salvage and strung
Reflect at loss Fill stupid and stung.
Plenty of fish Twisted and stitched.
Infect the rot Luck forever missed.
Sink with me..........
Sink with me..........
Sink with me..........
Sink with me.......... <start> Well the future spills it's intangibles
An unknown set of variables
A path that spliten infinitely up ahead
So tell me what's the use to pick and choose
From what you should or shouldn't do
That's time spent better sleeping in your bed
Or wide awake in a shopping mall
Trying clothes on from off of the wall
Yeah anything to entertain yourself
'Cause a costume can be quite comfortable
It can make you feel more beautiful
It can even make you look like someone else
But it's still you so there's nothing you can do
Like a bad habit the one you couldn't kick there it always is
And it's nothing that no doctor's gonna fix
They pat your back bruised with their accolades
And all four walls are a trophy case
But that doesn't make it any less of a cage
But you can make it all less difficult
By embracing the ephemeral
Then you'd never have to worry or explain
'Cause if it's really all just physical
Then my memory's immaterial
So why then do I remember you at all
But I do I do my friend I seen your face
We shared a cup I know the taste
Its sweetness is relentless on my lips
So help me drink in everything that is like a freed convict
Drunk on redemption from the way I've been
But I swear this time that things will be different
Well right and wrong they have never been that far apart
For those who'd write that sentence where you hang hang
We will be lifted up from all of this
Yeah we will transcend the insignificance of our existence
Yeah your body's gone but angel you will live
Yeah your body's gone
Now your body's gone
Now your body's gone
Now your body's gone
Now your body's gone
Now your body's gone
Now your body's gone
Now your body's gone
Now your body's gone
Now your body's gone
Now your body's gone
Now your body's gone
Now your body's gone
Now your body's gone
Now your body's gone but angel you will live <start> Time travel will be the death of man
Only the devil fools with the best laid plans
The best laid plans best left unplanned
Time travel will be the death of man
What's done is done
So you must see
You can't bring back
What's already been
Technology's tempting the public eye
Do you wanna know why when who and why
We're cloaked in indicision
Consealed by lies
I wanna know why we're really alive
Well you might say we got no proof
There's one thing I know
Is that I'm younger than you
And I can see through your eyes
And I can see through your lies
Hypocrisy is your only disguise
Better tell us why we're really alive
Time travel will be the death of man
Only the devil fools with the best laid plans
The best laid plans best left unplanned
Time travel will be the death of man
In my darkest day
I thought this through
A change in the weather
Could be made by you
And all the information
You're holding back
Is it hidden in the water
That runs from my tap
When few had the proof that Jesus Christ
Was no more of a man than you or I
Would you tell the people Would you try to deceive
For fear of undermining their religious belief
Well there's a war going on
It's obvious one
It's between magic and medicine
Time travel will be the death of man
Only the devil fools with the best laid plans
The best laid plans best left unplanned
Time travel will be the death of man
Never give up the fight <start> You're breaking my heart 'cause you're leaving
You've fallen for somebody new
It isn't too easy believing
You'd leave after all we've been through
It's breaking my heart to remember
The dreams we depended upon
Your leaving is slow dying ember
I'll miss you my love when you're gone
I wish you joy though tear drops burn
But if some day you should care to return
Please hurry back and we'll make a new start
Til then you're breaking my heart
I wish you joy though tear drops burn
But if some day you should care to return
Please hurry back and we'll make a new start dear
Til then you're breaking my heart <start> Sunday Sunday here again in tidy attire
You read the color supplement the TV guide
You dream of protein on a plate
Regret you left it quite so late
To gather the family round the table to eat enough to sleep
Oh the Sunday sleep
Sunday Sunday here again a walk in the park
You meet an old soldier and talk of the past
He fought for us in two world wars
And says the England he knew is no more
He sings the Songs of Praise every week but always falls asleep
For the Sunday sleep
Sunday
Sunday
Oh Sunday sleep
Sunday Sunday here again in tidy attire
You read the color supplement the TV guide
You dream of protein on a plate
Regret you left it quite so late
To gather the family round the table to eat enough to sleep <start> Everything you do it comes back to you. Whatever it may be.
If it isn't one thing rest assured that something.
Will come back and pay you for your deed
A shortcut's a self defeating means if you cannot do it clean.
You'll never reach your reward.
And when the day is done what you receive is the sum.
Of what you took out from what you put in.
Times deep in a dream seem a veiled realm.
Shadows what I think and feel is real.
Times in our tribe feel the tribe when we thrive.
We have no fear of death and no fear of life.
Chorus
I can't forget you and our version of paradise.
I can't forget you and our version of paradise.
Everything you do it comes back to you whatever it may be.
What you did as a devil or did as an angel.
The favor returns itself somehow.
If you take my money Il buy you a drink and you'll see.
That no one rides for free.
Afraid of what I said then your mind is stricken.
I'm wearing my heart sleeveless and I'm always up for kickin
This is my favorite city pity everywhere the enemy.
From the beginning serious history
Nothing's ever given to no one. Rides for free.
From the beginning radiant energy's
Music what I need to keep my sanity.
I say we fear no evolution stand up musical revolution.
Follow me now when I say we can never stop in we never give.
Cause this is how we breathe and live.
Some of them whine and some of them bitch.
They cannot do it we never switch.
We do it for ourselves and we do it for you.
If you don't like it well I hope you do.
I've got to be honest.
Chorus x <start> Your tempting me to all of life and all its pleasure
Take me to the dream to the highs and the depths of my soul
Here we free thoughts inside giving up for giving time
But a world without end where no soul can descend
There will be no summertime
How lost life's been afraid of waking up
So afraid to take the dream
Shapes of angels the night casts
Lie dead but dreaming in my past
And they're here they want to meet you
They want to play with you
So take the dream
Can't break free and I hear them call
They want to plague you
They're here once more
They want to lay with you
They want to take you to the shame of your past
Take the dream
Take me lead me far away
Take me there I'll fade away
But I can't hide and I cannot die
I take the dream
We're but fools of our fates on this earth I shall wait
By the roots of my soul
I am losing control
Take the dream
The sleepers in you
Shapes of angels so deep within you
Feel your soul drowning
Unloosen your soul
Drowning in waters of reality
Tell me what is reality
Tell me tell me thought of god
Do dreams fall from god
Tell me what dreams may come
Break free thoughts all gone
We've all come down
Take me there you're my ticket out a here
All come down
Take me out a here
Take me there
We can dream together
We can sleep forever <start> The clock struck midnight
And through my sleeping
I heard a tapping at my door
I looked but nothing lay in the darkness
And so I turned inside once more
To my amazement
There stood a raven
Whose shadow hung above my door
Then through the darkness
It spoke that one word
That I shall hear forever more
Nevermore
Thus quoth the raven nevermore
And still the raven remains in my room
No matter how much I implore
No words can soothe him
No prayer remove him
And I must hear for evermore
Quoth the raven nevermore
Thus quoth the raven
Nevermore <start> My dear old friend I hope you will forgive
If you feel left alone if you feel left alone
We had been friends for too long
To be anything but that
And that's a thing I should have known
A funny couple we must have seemed you and I
I was trying so hard to fall in love with you
But you had your travelling shoes already on
While I was so obviously still wearing her tattoo...
My dear old friend I hope you will forgive
If you're running from me then please don't run too far
We've been friends for too long
To ever let that go
So I hope this is still what we are... <start> You are the savior without a saviors crown
Till night is falling it brings you down to sigh
I adore your blessing there is no much to say
Ill be come your reason to feed the flame inside our hearts
Youre all desire youre all desire I haunt
Beat my heart beat my heart to dry
Craving haunting the ceased devotion
Shes the one for me the cross I beg to see the path
When I dont want to stay
You are the reason to wipe my past away
Till night is falling I need no longer to breath
I dont need to care
I dont feel like cared
I dont need to breath cause I know what is
Best for me
Craving haunting the ceased devotion <start> I got somethin' to keep you satisfied
So won't you excuse me while I slip inside
I ain't gonna rush things you know I ain't no speed freak
And I like to take my time whenever I eat
Cause I'm just a slow poke uhhuh with long strokes
I said I'm just a slow poke baby
And I like to take my time poke on
I'd like to see you with the lights turned down
And I'd like to see you when you go down
I'm gonna be there right by your side
I'm just gonna hang on and let you take me for a ride
So how 'bout a slow poke uhhuh with long strokes
I said how 'bout a slow poke baby
I like to take my time alright
I'd like to poke you right here on the floor
I ain't gonna stop none till I hear you call for more
Then I'm gonna tease you till you're ready to scream
Then I'm gonna please you it's gonna seem like a dream
So how 'bout a slow poke uhhuh with long strokes
I said how 'bout a slow poke baby
I like to take my time poke on <start> When the big one talks huge heavy deep voice.
When he walks his feet rise six feet off the ground.
Seems indestructible and intimidating.
When he's in deep thought
You just can't tell what he's contemplating now
But the small one's smart.
Some would call him wiry.
To him it's art and his pallet's colourful.
This man is proof that looks can be deceiving.
Confident of victory the fun for him is in conceiving how.
They both want it need it love it.
It makes them feel like they belong.
When these two meet it's back in the alley.
Neither of them strangers to the venue or the clientele.
They are unaware of any negative consequences.
Their one concern is impressing those in audience tonight
With a fight to end all fights.
With so much in common you'd think that
They both could get along.
They both want it need it love it.
It makes them feel like they belong.
With so much in common you'd think that
They both could get along.
Why can't they get along <start> So here we are  just you and me
Love's refugees again.
Girl it's been so long
But still you are so close
I guess the way we're feeling
Still remained the same.
so there they are  the memories
Bringing back the dreams we learned to hide
And as we're looking back
Love is walking by
Leaving just a blossom
For all the tears we cried.
take me up  just for one more time
High above the shadows of those long lonely nights
Hold me tight  just for one more time
'till the new morning's breaking.
two burning hearts  that's all we are
Turning back the time for just one night.
But as we're moving on
All our dreams remain
Like a secret promise
Before we said goodbye
take me up  just for one more time
High above the shadows of those long lonely nights
Hold me tight  just for one more time
'till the new morning's breaking.
 guitar solo 
take me up  just for one more time
High above the shadows of those long lonely nights
Hold me tight  just for one more time
'till the new morning's breaking.
'till the new morning's breaking.
'till the new morning light... <start> I'll go on living and keep on forgiving because
You were my first love
So very warm and tender the way you loved me
Hey girl can't you remember and want more of me
Ronnie Ronnie Ronnie how can you go
Ronnie Ronnie Ronnie I am regretting but can't stop forgetting because
You were my first love
You said now you don't need me because I cheated
Why didn't you believe me when I repeated
Ronnie Ronnie Ronnie I'll never know
Ronnie Ronnie Ronnie I'll go on living and keep on forgiving because
You were my first love

Night after night

Day after day

Ronnie Ronnie Ronnie I'll never know
Ronnie Ronnie Ronnie I'll go on living and keep on forgiving because
You were my first love
I'll go on living and keep on forgiving because
You were my first love <start> Your my Friend
We'll stick together til the end.
What else is there for a buddy to do
But stick around with you
And I know it's hard
To be like you are.
I want you to know
I'll be there you won't fall apart.
And I want you to know
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
Your my friend
We'll be together to the end.
What else is there for a buddy to do
But be there without a view
And I know it's hard
To be like you are.
I want you to know
I'll be there you won't fall apart.
And I want you to know
I'll be with you
I'll be with you <start> Shootin' stars gilded age
Yeah just spill your dreams to me and we just hide away
You can stay if you believe
Just a leap of faith across a busy boulevard of broken dreams
And I dream about her even though I never should
Miss Hollywood Miss Hollywood Miss Hollywood
Yeah I would ride into the sunset if I could
Miss Hollywood Miss Hollywood Miss Hollywood
So slow to fade
Check all the hip across the street
Taking turns unlocking doors to fame by proximity
Golden dreams flow like water
And the water always wins for good or bad once you let it in
And I dream about her even though I never should
Miss Hollywood Miss Hollywood Miss Hollywood
Yeah I would ride into the sunset if I could
Miss Hollywood Miss Hollywood Miss Hollywood
So slow to fade
Don't you cry on Oscar night
Lifted off from mother earth to find her elusive smile
You can't buy authentic vibe
But you can check out all the detours off the 
But you can stay if you believe
But spinning gold is never easy when shooting stars are your dreams
Up in the sky a star's just a star
But funny thing when looking up it seems to follow you wherever you are
And I dream about her even though I never should
Miss Hollywood Miss Hollywood Miss Hollywood
Yeah I would ride into the sunset if I could
Miss Hollywood Miss Hollywood Miss Hollywood
And I dream about her even though I never should
Miss Hollywood Miss Hollywood Miss Hollywood
Yeah I would ride into the sun like Clint Eastwood
Miss Hollywood Miss Hollywood Miss Hollywood
So slow to fade so slow to fade so slow to fade
So slow to fade so slow to fade <start> You changed mylife you saved my soul
You let your sweet love shine on me
I found my strength when I lost control
You let your sweet love shine on me
Reflections of the pain and fear
Are closer than they may appear
Almost gone and almost here
Hey let your sweet sweet love shine love shine down on me
Let your sweet sweet love shine love shine down on me hey
Even when the skies are gray
You let your sweet love shine on me
You find a way to find a way
To let your sweet love shine on me
You know I've built those walls
And sang the blues
Over what this world is coming to
But walls are not enough for stopping you
Hey let your sweet sweet love shine love shine down on me
Let your sweet sweet love shine love shine down on me hey
You know I've built those walls and sang the blues
Over what this world is coming to
But walls are not enough for stopping you
Hey let your sweet sweet love shine love shine down on me
Let your sweet sweet love shine love shine down on me
Let your sweet sweet love shine love shine down on me
Let your sweet sweet love shine love shine down on me
Let your sweet sweet love shine love shine down on me <start> Fourteen years
Thirty minutes
Fifteen seconds I've
Held this grudge
Eleven songs
Four full journals
Thoughts of punishment
I've expended
Not in contact
Not a letter
Such communication
Telepathic
You've been vilified
Used as fodder
You deserve a piece
Of every record
But who's it hurting now
Who's the one that's stuck
Who's it torturing now
With an antique knot in her stomach
Chorus
I want to be big and let go
Of this grudge that's grown old
All this time I've not known
How to rest this bygone
I want to be soft and resolved
Clean of slate and released
I want to forgive for the both of us
Like an abandoned house
Dusty covered
Furniture
Still intact
If I visit it now
Will I simply relive it
Somehow gratuitous
But who's still aching now
Who's tired of her own voice
Who is it weighing down
With no gift from time of said healing
Chorus
Maybe as I cut the cord
Veils will lift from my eyes
Maybe as I lay this to rest
Dead weight off my shoulders will rise
Here I sit
Much determined
Ever illequipped
To draw this curtain
How this has entertained
Validated
And has served me well
Ever the victim
But who's done whining now
Who's ready to put down
This load I've carried longer than I had cared to remember
Chorus <start> Time ticks ticks away
Over bright lights and machines we've made
A beautiful face in a bar
Is one raindrop in a million others
You'll never know of the night sky
The way I have for all of time
It sings to me a lullaby
The day can't bring even though it tries
It hurts a little it cuts a little
It takes you right down to the bone
I see the love I see it in all of you
In the night I can breathe again
On this night I found my one and only friend
This feeling inside counts for more than anything
In the night I can breathe again
I was downtown all alone at three
I kept on crawling 'cause I had to flee
Hunters and fighters lovers and thieves
We all moved together under one belief
I sat down and watched the bullets fly
Across my heart on the loneliest night
I went to the end of the earth
Just to find out where it really hurts
It hurts a little it cuts a little
It takes you right down to the bone
I see the love I see it in all of you
In the night I can breathe again
On this night I found my one and only friend
This feeling inside counts for more than anything
In the night I can breathe again
Don't tell anyone 'cause I trust you
Don't tell anyone 'cause I trust you
Don't tell anyone 'cause I trust you
'Cause I trust you
In the night I can breathe again
On this night I found my one and only friend
This feeling inside counts for more than anything
In the night I can breathe again <start> I don't know if to run or to go
People say I'm too fast but too slow
I don't know if you're right or wrong
I just know I've been here too long
I say now
Come on and get me
Come on and get me baby
Take me away

Take me away

Well they tell me there is a Heaven
They could be right 'cause I know there's a Hell
I've been living oh too long without you
I know I'm right but I'll never tell
I say now
Come on and get me
Come on and get me baby
Take me away

Take me away

I don't know how I got here
And I don't know where it all began
I just know I can't make it
It's the end if you don't come back
To me...
 A.M in the morning
A strange light is shining through
It must be a vision
Or could it be you
I say now
Drop down and get me
Drop down and get me baby
Drop down and get me and take me away
Take me away
Take me away
Drop down and get me

Drop down and get me

Drop down and get me

Take me away
I said now Drop down and get me

Drop down and get me

Drop down and get me

Take me away

Take me away
... <start> Life
Isn't everything
Isn't everything
Isn't everything
Life
Isn't everything
Isn't everything
Isn't everything
Life
Isn't everything
Isn't everything
Isn't everything
Life <start> How can you treat me so badly
I gave my heart to you gladly
Don't try to explain
You'll drive me insane
If you have to go
Then go
I want no more of your lyin'
I don't wanna know
Just go
Hasn't there been enough cryin'
Don't tell me why
I
Don't wanna know
Don't tell me how you'll love me forever
Don't say that someday we'll be together
Stop tryin' to be kind
You were never really mind
And every word you say
Just drives me out of my mind
If you have to go
Then go
I want no more of your lyin'
I don't wanna know
Just go
Hasn't there been enough cryin'
Don't tell me why
I
Don't wanna know
How could I be so blind
I thought we were doin' fine
You never said a word
Never gave me a sign
If you have to go
Then go
I want no more of your lyin'
I don't wanna know
Just go
Hasn't there been enough cryin'
Don't tell me why
I
Don't wanna know <start> Shes always saying maybe well never know
I cant hear it for all my fears
I'm too busy praying wishing for what I should
Do or say to get my way
Oh maybe well never know
Were on our way
Its never done all of the joy and pain Repeat x
Dream again
The windows shuttered the big day never comes
The gift is giving what comes with it
Celebrate the birth at any age
Eat up grow up shut up measure up
Were on our way
Its never done all of the joy and pain Repeat x
Dream again
Were on our way
Its never done all of the joy and pain
Dream again <start> Come on so tough
When you think you got a right
Make love so rough
Until I lose the will to fight
You got that somethin' baby
That turned my darkness in the light
And I can't get enough of your love
I never found a man
Who took the time to see
The woman that I am
And not the one he hoped I'd be
And I think we're onto somethin'
And it's good enough for me
I just can't get enough of your
Come on so tough
Baby you know just how to please
You got that stuff
Brings this woman to her knees
I think we're onto somethin'
That is good enough for me
I just can't get enough of your
I just can't get enough of your
And I just can't get enough of your love
Can't get enough of your love
Can't get enough of your love
Just can't get it
Can't get enough of your love
Just can't get it
Can't get enough of your love
Can't get enough of your love
Well I can't get enough of your love <start> I want to be loved but you dont seem to love me
I wander within that repetition
I found one answer that even if Im scared even if Im hurt
I can say I love you to the person who I love
Do you love me Or not love me
As for things like that its already fine either way
No matter how I wish
There are many unchangeable things in this world right
Thats right and because only the fact of my loving you
Is the truth unchangeable by anyone
I want to overcome the thousands of nights and tell it to you
Theres something that I must tell you
I want to be loved but you dont seem to love me
I wander within that repetition
I found one answer that even if Im scared
Even if Im hurt I can say I love you to the person who I love
Its scary to turn my feelings into words
But I can say I love you to the person who I love
In this broad world I cant express the joy of encountering you with words
So we smile sing about the vividly passing autumn in doremi
Turn our backs on winter wait for the sunlight streaming through trees in spring
And become reborn anew so that we can protect someone
On the path we came from and our destination when we looked back Id always have timid eyes
I want to face you but I cant be honest
I who repeated days of not being able to straightforwardly love my partner
And hated being alone on that day
Seemed to love people while unwounded
Ill overcome the thousands of nights and go meet you now
There is something that I must tell you
I want to be loved but you dont seem to love me
I wander within that repetition
I found one answer that even if Im scared
Even if Im hurt I can say I love you to the person who I love
Even if those thoughts arent fulfilled I can say I love you to the person who I love
Its the most wonderful thing in this world <start> Take my heart and wring it out
In your hands and watch it all collapse
Take your love and drive it in
Into my soul and never leave again
Chorus
Cause I am so afraid
That I'll find myself alone
Looking for a savior looking for a home
I am so afraid
That I'll find myself alone
Lookin for a savior lookin for a home
So don't leave me here alone
Don't leave me here alone
All your hope and all my pride
All this time to watch it all collide
When everyone seems to say
You can work it out
Under my skin I'm shaking
And I can't get out
Chorus
So don't leave me here
This is not what you said
It's all in my head
When I throw my anger at you instead
So don't give up on me
I want to believe
That you'll never leave me
But I am so afraid
That I'll find myself alone
Lookin for a savior lookin for a home
I am so afraid
That I'll find myself alone
Deep into the ages deep into the foam
I am so afraid
That I'll find myself alone
Lookin for a savior lookin for a home
So don't leave me here alone
Don't leave me here alone <start> When the rain is falling and you feel like you are a stranger
And the time is passing you by is a lonely time and you want to fly
Call on me call on me
Call on me call on me
I'll be by your side
When you turn around needing somebody there
Who can give you love and show you good care
If there's a place inside you that's empty and cold
You may need my love to have to hold
Call on me call on me
Call on me call on me
I'll be by your side
To keep you satisfied
I want to keep you satisfied
Call on me call on me
Call on me call on me
I'll be by your side
To keep you satisfied
When the clear light of a winter's day
Blows cold and hard and the future is grey
You can always have the fire of love
To keep you warm as the sun above
Call on me call on me
Call on me call on me
I'll be by your side
To keep you satisfied
I'll be by your side
To keep you satisfied
Don't worry about the rain baby
I'll keep you dry
I'll keep you warm inside
And satisfied
Don't worry about the rain
I'll keep you dry I'll keep you dry
Call on me baby call on me baby <start> We arrived too late
Our mouths were opening
I turned off the light
So come on night
You're a witness you
You've seen me interrupt
A good old fashioned fight
So come on night
Everyone is gone
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
Watched the dying day
Blushing in the sky
Everyone is uptight
So come on night
Everyone is gone
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
I know we're not
Illegitimate
In our hearing
So come on so come on night <start> He hates the desk that is grotesque
With all its documents and lists and the screen
Outside the sun he wants to run away to face the day
Without destroying his way
Hurry up Don't dare to stop
Something inside him screams
It's creeping in it's sweating out
The fear of flying the fear of dying a roundabout
It's time to decide to choose the question mark or to hide
From the fire still burning inside
On the radio 'though the level's low he hears The Stones
See how I'm flying it's the call for life
Just pretend your wings are stronger than all the things
That put you down and start your crying
She's through the door of the seventh floor
Her naked body lies dead on the ground
Tears in his eyes asking for the wherefores and the why's
And searching for the pure or at least the nice
Not only on the radio don't keep the level low we receive the call
See how I'm flying it's the call for life
Just pretend your wings are stronger than all the things
That put you down and start your crying
See how I'm sailing in the eye of the storm
Leave your fears behind or soon you'll be blind
For the miracle called Life <start> We grow tobacco and we drive trucks
We kill whitetails and greenhead ducks
And drive our four wheelers down the main road
And bust out the sleds when it's cold
We got back roads an' fourwheeldrives
We got tailgates on a Friday night
And it's a half hour from my front door
To a Walmart or a grocery store
What you all don't understand
It ain't all about a southern man
'Cause we got outlaws we got hicks
We got honkytonks out in these sticks
We love our whiskey and we love our homegrown
God damn it's so good to be home
We wear Carhart we don't wear suits
We wear square toes and Chippewa boots
And we all know where we come from
And we'll be right here when it's done
What you all don't understand
It ain't all about the southern man
'Cause we got family livin' out in these woods
We got pride and a sense of what's good
And we all got dirt on our hands
It's a song for the workin' man
Get up early and we work third shift
Pay our taxes and protect our kids
And we all got dirt on our hands
'Cause there's rednecks north of the MasonDixon
There's rednecks north of the MasonDixon
'Cause I'm from the North son you're from the South
Straight out the trailer fresh off the plow
You got your Chevy parked next to my Ford
And the colors flyin' high at your door
I got a shotgun fill it with shells
You got a Bible but I'll see you in hell
We ain't that different son you and me
Tryin' to make it in the land of the free
What y'all don't understand
It ain't all about a southern man
'Cause we got family livin' out in these woods
We got pride and a sense of what's good
And we all got dirt on our hands
It's a song for the workin' man
Get up early and we work third shift
Pay our taxes and protect our kids
And we all got dirt on our hands
'Cause there's rednecks north of the MasonDixon
I'm a redneck north of the MasonDixon <start> There's no time to phone home
When you're racin' you're on time
You contemplate you gotta wait your own turn
Up the noise with some poison with great poise
You can't compare it too or let it scare you through
If everything you do is not as smoothly as we planned
You gotta understand
There is more for you.
But all you gotta do ooh
Is put yourself with the people
They're the ones who make the world spin
Lust in favor you can win.
And you'll take home the gold medallion
And ride the wobbly wave of fame.
That is why you came
That is why you
Came to your senses
To feel it out
And try to kill off every dial
Your mother worries but no one worries quite like you.
And when you start you must rely on your own heart.
Cause nothing works the same or takes the blame or wins the game
With your head in your hands in the pouring rain
I want to see you as you are.
Like a lonely star.
There is more for you.
But all you gotta do ooh
Is put yourself with the people.
They're the ones who make the world spin.
Lust in favor you can win.
And you'll take home the gold medallion.
And ride the wobbly wave of fame.
That is why you came.
That is why you came.
You gotta be so strong
You gotta teach your son
How to stand up straight
When you want to run
How to carry on
How to be yourself
To be different but the same.
That is why you came. <start> Yeah the roads are right tonight
They are twisting
My mouth is dry
Like cool air inside
And maybe I worry
Do things in a hurry
And follow the dust
Of people like new
There's people like me
And there's people like you
Yeah the roads are right tonight
They are turning
I know that deep inside the pines
An answer is lurking
And maybe I worry
Do things in a hurry
And follow the dust
Of people like new
There's people like me
And there's people like new <start> Got a wife and kids in Baltimore Jack
I went out for a ride and I never went back
Like a river that don't know where it's flowing
I took a wrong turn and I just kept going
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Lay down your money and you play your part
Everybody's got a hungry heart
I met her in a Kingstown bar
We fell in love I knew it had to end
We took what we had and we ripped it apart
Now here I am down in Kingstown again
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Lay down your money and you play your part
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Everybody needs a place to rest
Everybody wants to have a home
Don't make no difference what nobody says
Ain't nobody like to be alone
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Lay down your money and you play your part
Everybody's got a hungry heart <start> Missed the Saturday dance
Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore
Though I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore
Darling I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless why stir up memories
Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for
Awf'lly diff'rent without you
Don't get around much anymore <start> Fuck You
Fuck You
Fuck You and Fuck Society too.

My kind
My kind
My kind belongs nowhere.
 <start> Radio radio. Gimmie gimmie.

Chorus
Gimmie my radio.
Gimmie my radio.
Gimmie my radio.
Gimmie my radio.
They took away my TV set
And my cheeba cigarette.
I wanna be like Nikki Corvette so
Chorus
I don't wanna eat these vegetables.
I don't wanna read this book no more.
I just wanna go to the rock 'n' roll show so
Chorus
I'm a diva yeah I know.
Everybody tells me so.
I don't wanna go to school no more so
Radio radio. Gimmie gimmie.
Radio radio. Gimmie gimmie.
Radio radio. Gimmie gimmie.
Radio radio. Gimmie gimmie.
 <start> I can't seem to feel the envy I should feel
Or maybe I don't need the sour side of love of love
No I don't care his breath is in your hair
Well I don't care his skin is still
Between the still on fold of your sheets
Send him away
Send him away send him away
Send him away send him away
I don't mean to claim or own you or maybe I would like to
But I need whatever side of love is there
No I don't care his breath is in your hair
well I don't care his skin is still
Between the still on fold of your sheets
From the fold of your sheets
Send him away
Send him away send him away
Send him away send him away
Send him away send him away
Send him away send him away
Send him away send him away <start> As I wake today same as yesterday
I get in my car the poor turn my wheels
There's so much today who's got time to listen
As we fulfill our dreams the shame is left unseen
Why should someone lose so that I get by
Why should someone pay just to send me high
Chorus
No one has to cry while I can smile
No one owns the sky so blue above you
Somewhere in this world
There's a field where we all play
The secret's in your eyes
No one has to cry
There's no selfcontrol as we play our roles
It's all dog eat dog we're all dressed for show
As we plot and scheme full of American dreams
Who says it's fair who gets the opportunities
There are some who live without so that I get by
They pay the price for doubting just to send me high.
Chorus <start> I just want my fortune now
I don't care where or when or how
I don't want the dustbin
Or the cuddly toy
I'm going for the jackpot
Boy oh boy oh boy
See me on the box
See me winning lots of loot oh yeah
Silly kids games
Grabbing cash off that old coot oh yeah
Now I've got the replies to all the questions
There's just one thing that I should mention
When I win all the loot
Don't you have no fear
I'm going to take my hols
In Kampuchea yeah
And it's been a pleasure
Thanks a million
I hope you like the show
La la la la la la la <start> Somewhere in the madness of a long forgotten time
Resurrect the pieces to the crime
I'm searching for an answer that somehow could explain
Why I feel this misery and pain
But who am I to pretend
The fault is mine in the end
Sifting through the ashes for any alibis
All I find is me in my disguise
Father won't you help me hallowed be thy name
I confess I am the one to blame
And though my life fades to black
I know there's no turning back
So as I cross the Rubicon
I know I can't go on feeling this way
And I can't be like Estragon
A fool who's waiting on some better day
When all my prayers are answered and all my sins absolved
And all life's mysteries have been resolved
Father won't you tell me why life is such a sham
And why I don't know who the hell I am
And though I'm feeling estranged
I must admit somehow I've changed
So as I cross the Rubicon
I know I'll carry on oh come what may
And I can't be like Estragon
A fool who's waiting on some judgement day
Woke up in a cold sweat screaming
Same dream I'm always dreaming
Look out there's a monster waitin'
Comin' for me with the mark of Satan
Can't run I'm in slow motion
I can't swim in the middle of the ocean
I can't breathe I need intubation
Everywhere I look there's complete devastation
Wake me
Wake me somebody wake

And as I cross the Rubicon
I vow to carry on oh come what may
And I'll not be like Estragon
Some fool who's waiting for someone to say
It's OK...
it's ok...
it's ok... <start> Im Sommer  fahren wir nach Mexico
um unsere Nationalelf siegen zu sehen
und fr unser Land gerade zu stehen
FuballWeltmeister es gibt nur einen Deutschland heit er
Deutschland Deutschland ist die Macht
Refrain
Ja wir sehn uns in jedem Fall
Im Sommer ' beim Mexicoberfall
Ja wir sehn uns in jedem Fall
Im Sommer ' beim Mexicoberfall
Lat uns unsre Fahne hissen
unserem Gegner vor die Fe pissen
Zeigt ihm zeigt ihm wer wir sind
FuballWeltmeister es gibt nur einen Deutschland heit er
Deutschland Deutschland ist die Macht <start> I Tell Myself That I Wasn't That Involved
And Put Away Problems That Are Not Solved
Still I Recall What We Did That Day
It's Clear Why You Ran Away
My Conscience's Gone
I Get The Feeling That I Am Not Alone
A Glance At The Wall Did I See Him Frown
I Feel He's Aware Of What We've Done
Destroying His Favorite Son
He Read My Mind
I Will Not Ever Forget A Smile That Dies
The Look On Your Face When You Took Our Lies
But You Were The One To Blame
I Cannot Stand The Shame
I Guess He Sees Me Through
Feel Him From Above
How He's Starting From The Ceiling
Ted I Let Her Use You Too
Nothing She Said Was True
What Have I Done To You
You Sat Beside Me We Talked About Your Style
I Mentioned The Garden That Made You Smile
A Lie From This House Was The Latest Trend
I Said That I Was Your Friend
Please Rewind
I Think He's Coming To Get Me Can't You See
A Whisper At Night  You Will Not Be Free
Reminding Me Of What We Did That Day
It's Clear Why You Left That Away
I've Lost Control
A Memory Of A Smile That Died
How Do You Think That I Feel Inside
But You Were The One To Blame
She Won Her Stupid Game
Chorus
Repeat <start> I can't believe it
Talking to people
That cowboys and indians
Are taking control
It really was a wild one
But somebodys coming
A lot of fast people
Would fade away yeah.
Hold back the seasons
Take back the memories
Hold onto to something
Better hold to you
It really was a wild one
But somebodys coming
A lot of fast people
Would fade away yeah <start> I been working one eye dollar
Bye and bye Lord bye and bye
I been working one eye dollar
Bye and bye Lord bye and bye
I got the plans to the Oval Office
Bye and bye Lord bye and bye
I got the plans in my front pocket
Bye and bye Lord bye and bye
In the inner chambers of the President
You will find no crosses only pentagrams
Beelzebub and business suits
On the hot line all right
I been working one eye dollar
Bye and bye Lord bye and bye
I been working one eye dollar
Bye and bye Lord bye and bye
I been working like a pack mule every day <start> Alright now boys and girls we've got another story for you now
We want to introduce to you another friend of the Bible
Hell yeah
Hell yeah
Hell yeah
Hell yeah
If I were God there would be no explicit sex on T.V.
Like little Opie eating pie when he made it with Aunt Bea
If I were God thou shall not worship false Billy Idols
And thou shall add the Book Of Flavor Flav to the Bible
Thou shall make fun of Hindus thou shall not make a Speed 
If I were God that's what I'd do Heavens no
Hell yeah
Hell yeah
Hell yeah
Hell yeah
If I were God I'd get a bunch of slaves to do everything
Norwegian lesbians that feed me grapes and know how to sing
If I were God thou shall not wear tube socks with FlipFlops
Thou shall sit and thou shall spin thou shall even wife swap
Thou shall resist the Olsen Twins thou shall not cut Footloose
If I were God that's what I'd do Heavens no
Hell yeah
Hell yeah
Hell yeah
Hell yeah
And when they nail my pimpled ass to the cross
I'll tell them I found Jesus that should throw them off
He goes by the name Jesus and steals hubcaps from cars
Oh Jesus can I borrow your crowbar
To pry these God damn nails out they're beginning to hurt
Crucified and all I got was this lousy tee shirt
I Can't Believe It's Not Butter I'll sing as I'm flogged
Yeah that's what I would do if I were God
So vote for me for Savior and you'll go to Heaven
Your lame duck Lord is like Kevin Spacey in Seven
With creepy threats of HEDoubleHockeyStick
You just can't teach an old God new tricks
But would I be a good Messiah with my low selfesteem
If I don't believe in myself would that be blasphemy
Just sport some crummy holier than thou facade
Yeah that's what I would do if I were God <start> As soon as you're born they make you feel small
By giving you no time instead of it all
'Til the pain is so big you feel nothing at all
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
They hurt you at home and they hit you at school
They hate if you're clever and despise a fool
'Til you're so  crazy you can't follow their rules
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
When they've tortured and scared you for twenty odd years
Then they expect you to pick a career
When you can't really function you're so full of fear
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV
And you think you're so clever and classless and free
But you're still  peasants as far as I can see
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
There's room at the top they're telling you still
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill
If you want to be like all the folks on the hill
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
If you want to be a hero well just follow me
If you want to be a hero well just follow me <start> Milk it for all it's worth
Make sure you get them first
The apple of your eye
The rotten core inside
We are all prisoners
Things couldn't get much worse
I've had it up to here
You know your end is near
Chorus
You had to have it all
Well have you had enough
You greedy little bastard
You will get what you deserve
When all is said and done
I will be the one to leave you in the misery and hate what you've become
Intoxicated eyes no longer live that life.
You should have learned by now I'll burn this whole world down.
I need some peace of mind no fear of what's behind.
You think you've won this fight you've only lost your mind.
Chorus
Hold me down 
Hold me down 
Hold me down 
Hold me down
Chorus
Heaven help you <start> Unchain the colors before my eyes
Yesterday's sorrows tomorrow's white lies.
Scan the horizon the clouds take me higher
I shall return from out of fire
Tears for remembrance and tears for joy
Tears for somebody and this lonely boy
Out in the madness the all seeing eye
Flickers above us to light up the sky
Unchain the colors before my eyes
Yesterday's sorrows tomorrow's white lies.
Scan the horizon the clouds take me higher
I shall return from out of fire <start> Businessmen drink my blood
Like the kids in art school said they would
And I guess I'll just begin again
You say you can we still be friends
If I was scared
I would
And if I was bored
You know I would
And if I was yours
Well I'm not
All the kids have always known
That the emperor wears no clothes
But to bow to down to them anyway
Is better than being alone
If I was scared
I would
And if I was bored
You know I would
And if I was yours
But I'm not
Now you're knocking at my door
Saying please come out against tonight
But I would rather be alone
Than pretend I feel alright
If the businessmen drink my blood
Like the kids in art school said they would
Then I guess I'll just begin again
You say you can still be friends
If I was scared
I would
And if I was pure
You know I would
And if I was yours
But I'm not
Now I'm ready to start
If I was scared
I would
And if I was pure
You know I would
And if I was yours
But I'm not
Now I'm ready to start
Now I'm ready to start
I would rather be wrong
Than live in the shadows of your song
My mind is open wide
And now I'm ready to start
Now I'm ready to start
My mind is open wide
And now I'm ready to start
Your mind surely opened the door
To step out into the dark
Now I'm ready <start> You can make it if you try
You can make it if you try
You can make it if you try
Whoa yeah
You can make it if you try
Sometime you'll have to cry
Sometime you'll have to lie
You're gonna live until you die
Whoa yeah
You can make it if you try
If your baby treats you wrong
Don't go around singing the blues
Remember my friend
Everybody can't win
Somebody somebody's got to lose
You can make it if you try
You can make it if you try
You can make it if you try
Whoa yeah
You can make it if you try <start> Adamant adamant. Tunnel vision view
Wasn't gonna pull the plug had to see it through
What a bright idea that wouldn't quit
Somewhat empty but I took a healthy sip
Then I tripped when it got harder to see
In over my head and now it's hanging over me
I've only made things worse today
And everyone everything's in my way
Adding insult to injury
Are you happy are you happy now
Can I tip the scale
Well maybe I'm just bound to fail
Adding insult to injury
Are you happy are you happy now
Adamant adamant. Tunnel vision view
Backed up in a corner
Now I'm stuck because I should know better
Take the wrap suck it up because I should know better
Sad to say couldn't make the connection
A lot of build up
But it only took a second to bring this whole thing down
Backed up in a corner now I'm stuck
Adamant adamant. Tunnel vision view
Backed up in a corner
Now I'm stuck because I should know better.
Take the wrap suck it up because I should know better <start> I walk in the streets and there is no one there
I hear a voice and there is no one there
I see a market square but no one is there
I reach a hand out but no one is there
No one is there for me 
People got killed and i don't care
This world is dying but i don't care
I know they hate me and i don't care
I close my eyes and i don't care
Because no one cares about me 
 The feeling that nobody cares about you <start> You ever love someone so much you thought your little heart was gonna break in two

You ever tried with all your heart and soul to get you lover back to you

You ever pray with all your heart and soul just to watch him walk away
Baby did a bad bad thing 
Baby did a bad bad thing 
Baby did a bad bad thing 
Baby did a bad bad thing 
Baby did a bad bad thing 
Baby did a bad bad thing 
And I feel like crying I feel like crying
You ever toss and turn your lying awake and thinking about the one you love
I don't think so
You ever close your eyes your making believe your holding the one your dreaming of
Well if you say so
It hurts so bad when you finally know just how low low low low low he'll go
Baby did a bad bad thing 
Baby did a bad bad thing 
Baby did a bad bad thing 
Baby did a bad bad thing 
Baby did a bad bad thing 
Baby did a bad bad thing 
And I feel like crying I feel like crying
Baby did a bad bad thing
Baby did a bad bad thing
Baby did a bad bad thing
Baby did a bad bad thing
Baby did a bad bad thing
And I feel like crying I feel like crying <start> I'll give you back my farm and I'll give you back my house
I'll give you back my right to be free
I've got moon I've got sun
Lightning lightning lightning
I've got me I've got you
Frightening frightening frightening
I'll give you back my farm and I'll give you back my house
I'll give you back my right to be free
I'll give you back my farm and I'll give you back my house
I'll give you back my right to be free
I've got moon I've got sun
 Lightning lightning lightning
I've got me I've got you
 Frightening frightening frightening <start> You're a shadow
Standing in your own sunshine
Always doing what
Feels right not wasting no time.
You're alone
Waiting for your bus to leave
Waiting for your chance to go
Waiting for your chance to breathe
Through the Darkness
Through the Darkness you run
Close behind you
Close behind you it comes
Lady Luck finally found
You out in the sun
Friends and family
Watching as you drive away
But you still got your faith
No matter how long it takes <start> Poor Baby something always bringing you down
If you look for it baby there's so much unhappiness all around
Don't cry your daddy gonna buy your oneway ticket to sunshine
Cheer up your ... try to clear up your mind
Poor Baby try to feel better
Nothing's as bad as it may seem
Poor Baby under the weather
Try to close your eyes and dream
Think of the good times 
Just think of the good times that we're gonna see
Poor Baby try to feel better
Nothing's as bad as it may seem
Poor Baby under the weather
Try to close your eyes and dream
Think of the good times 
Just think of the good times that we're gonna see
Don't fret your daddy gonna fetch your oneway ticket to happy
Cheer up your ... try to clear up your mind
Poor Baby try to feel better
Nothing's as bad as it may seem
Poor Baby under the weather
Try to close your eyes and dream
Think of the good times 
Just think of the good times that we're gonna see
Poor Baby try to feel better
Nothing's as bad as it may seem
Poor Baby under the weather
Try to close your eyes and dream
Think of the good times 
Just think of the good times that we're gonna see <start> Hey.... Heyyyy.... Heyyyyyyyy...
Baby baby you better be under control
So don't lose out low
Name name me the other one for once
I recall
so do me a favor
Rise..
up rise the waterfall
Wetting my eyes
I've lost my own sight but
At least for a while
Just as long as I cry
I've got everything
I've got everything
I've got everything
There's nothing i wont......
I've got everything
I've got everything
At least for a while
Just as long as I'm gone
Dive dive in your afterlife and come back
Alive and let go the fear
Save I say the other one again I recall
So do me a favor
Rise..
up rise the waterfall
Wetting my eyes
I've lost my own sight but
At least for a while
Just as long as I cry
I've got everything

There's nothing i wont......
I've got everything
I've got everything
At least for a while
Just as long as I'm gone <start> What are you going to do with your new ways
What are you going to do with your new wave
Maybe it's that you no longer care.
Now you're so great.
You've just got to stand there.
Or were you never even bothered anyway
About the new wave.
What about the new wave
Did you think it would change things
Here we all are in the latest craze.
Stick with the crowd
hope it's not a passing phase.
It's the latest thing to be nowhere.
You can turn into the wallpaper.
But you know you were always there anyway
Without the new wave.
What about the new wave
Did you think it would change things
It's just safety in numbers
When it's tricky when it gets tough
When you need to feel that you're good enough
All you pretty people who've been taken over.
Had better start looking for your own answers.
'Cause there's no safety in numbers anyway
Or in a new wave
What about the new wave
Did you think it would change things
It's just safety in numbers. <start> Sunlight failed but only for a while
In the moonlight pale someone made me smile
The shining almost took me but I made it through that night
And in the morning life it graced me and I ran for miles
Sunlight in a billion dreams that are lost and won
Moonlight in spite of all you've seen there's only one way out
Say you will love me until I leave the world <start> Can you hear yourself free yourself fuck yourself
Can you fix yourself fill yourself trust yourself
Cloud your vision
And just medicate yourself and just separate yourself
And just medicate yourself and you'll never change yourself
Will you hesitate penetrate deviate
Will you medicate agitate aggravate
Indecision
Can you fill this deep inside <start> As I was motivatin'
Back in town
I saw a Cadillac sign
Sayin' No Money Down
So I eased on my brakes
And I pulled in the drive
Gunned my motor twice
Then I walked inside
Dealer came to me
Said Trade in you Ford
And I'll put you in a car
That'll eat up the road
Just tell me what you want
And then sign on that line
And I'll have it brought down to you
In a hour's time
I'm gonna get me a car
And I'll be headed on down the road
Then I won't have to worry
About that broken down raggedy Ford
Well Mister I want a yellow convertible
Four door de Ville
With a Continental spare
And a wide chrome wheel
I want power steering
And power brakes
I want a powerful motor
With a jet off take
I want air condition
I want automatic heat
And I want a full Murphy bed
In my back seat
I want short wave radio
I want TV and a phone
You know I gotta talk to my baby
When I'm ridin' alone
Yes I'm gonna get that car
And I'm gonna head on down the road
Yeah then I won't have to worry
About that broken down raggedy Ford
I want four carburetors
And two straight exhausts
I'm burnin' aviation fuel
No matter what the cost
I want railroad air horns
And a military spark
And I want a five year guarantee
On everything I got
I want ten dollar deductible
I want twenty dollar notes
I want thirty thousand liability
That's all she wrote
I got me a car
And I'm headed on down the road
No money down
I don't have to worry
About that broken down raggedy Ford <start> you should hear the warning if you read the signs
play with your own life but don't play with mine
you're living your way i'm living mine
may be tomorrow we will collide
if you knew the action you see us so blind
play with your own life but don't play with mine
the shape of things to come
the shape of things to come
welcome to the future <start> Due to acne.
Due to heavy metal.
Due to Fread and Barney Wilma and Pebbles.
New Jersey exit.
Suzy's got the flue.
Maybe this will clear up her sinuses
she's got nothing better to do.
Your kids are having a gas in the garage.
Daddy comes home
to the kiddie circus
Charlie Get out of that car
Sorry dad got rigor mortis
Your kids are having a gas in the garage.
Is something's pretty much dead
you might as well shoot it.
What will this do to car insurance
How 'bout the family unit
Seven at a time death extravaganza.
Little Joe and Hoss never did this on Bonanza.
Your kids are having a gas in the garage. <start> Can I touch you
I can't believe that you are real
How did I ever find you
You are the dream that saved my life
You are the reason I survived
Baby...
I never thought that I could love
Someone as much as I love you
I know it's crazy but it's true
I never thought that I could need
Someone as much as I need you
I love you...
Can I hold you
Girl your smile lights up the sky
You are too beautiful for the human eye
You are the dream that never dies
You are the fire that burns inside
Baby...
I never thought that I could love
Someone as much as I love you
I know it's crazy but it's true
I never thought that I could need
Someone as much as I need you
I love you...
You are the sinshine in the sky
You are the sparkle in my eyes
I never thought that I could love
Someone as much as I need you
I know it's crazy but it's true
I never thought that I could need
Someone as much as I need you
I love you. <start> In a discotheque at dawn
Is when it came to me
I'd been ravin' through the night
Lookin' for some company
It was the Mambo talkin'
It's got a lot to say
'Do you come here often'
'Do you wanna play'
The hitchhike into Paris
And zigzag by the Seine
The Hollywood moment
I'll never be the same
You can dance
There's a world awaiting
Way beyond the sea
How I love to travel
Baby will you come with me
You can dance
Jump on the table
Slide down the pole
You can wear your sable
You can bare your soul
Through Reno down to Vegas
The casinos never close
To the movers and the shakers
The Tango never knows
You can dance
You can dance
You can dance
You can dance dance dance dance
You can dance dance dance dance
I need some inspiration
I've got a lot of time to lose
You can dance
And then the dolce vita
I find my beauty queen
In England there's a moment
One nation in a groove
You can dance
Where the music and emotion
Will make you wanna move
You can dance
Take me to the river
Try singing in the rain
You can dance
I like the jungle fever
It's got me in the mood again
You can dance
Oh tutti frutti
Jones bar Hollywood
You can dance
I like Campari soda
I'd can can if I could
You can dance you can dance
You can dance you can dance
You can dance you can dance
You can dance <start> I got an offhand way
Of getting information
I gotta walk away
Jetlag is suffocation
Call me zero zero zero
Call me zero you are zero
Call me zero zero zero
Call me zero you are zeroohohohohohoh
Another cloudy day
another observation
They keep my DNA
Down by the record station
Call me zero zero zero
Call me zero you are zero
Call me zero zero zero
Call me zero you are zeroohohohohohoh
Come on
You'll be coming around
And youll be of your station
Ohohoh
And you'll be hanging around until you go and make up

Daddy take me with you
I promise I'll be good
Daddy this is next time
And momma said I could
Sittin' in the front seat ridin' down town
An icecream cone I'd wrap him around
My little finger
Tighter than my baby curls
You can make a tear go a long long way
When you're daddy's little girl
Well he tightened my bike chain from  to 
Taught me to drive when I was a wild thing
Reached and he prayed while I made some mistakes
That I wouldn't have made if I'd have done it his way
Now he hugs me when he sees me
We talk about the past
He tries to give me money
And I try and give it back
He's a book of advice
More then I need
The look in his eyes is saying to me
Let me help you all I can
While I'm still in this world
What will you do when you're daddy's gone
And you're daddy's little girl
Jeff Carson
There's two things I know for sure
She was sent here from heaven
And she's daddy's little girl
As I drop to my knees by her bed at night
She talks to Jesus
And I close my eyes
And I think God for all of the joy in my life
Oh but most of all
For butterfly kisses
With her momma there
Stickin' little white flowers
All up in her hair
Walk me down the isle daddy
It's just about time
Does my wedding gown look pretty daddy
Daddy don't cry
With all that I've done wrong
I must have done something right
To deserve her love every morning
And butterfly kisses for life
Faith Hill
What'll I do when my daddy's gone <start> Have you ever hear of Gide
I won't advise it's full of lies
Trust me I know 'cos I believed it so
What was I supposed to do
Turn my back
Well that would lack
A certain amount of happiness
No doubt it's brutal and cruel and inevitable
It's not my fault so I don't care anymore
I'm packing up and moving out
And it's alright 'cos I'll be miles away
Trying to find new things to say to say
Take me home and tuck me in
Hold me tight and I just might tell you all I know

Sunglasses and handkerchiefs
I'm chronicling everything that's happened to us
So hate me if you must
It's easy to do so easy to do yeah
And so convenient
It's all my fault though I don't care anymore
I'm packing up and moving out
And it's alright 'cos I'll be miles away
Trying to find new things to say
Trying to find new things to say <start> Are you tired of the life that leaves us begging for more
We got our heads in the clouds but our feet on the floor
We tend to chase everything that ends us leaving us dry
We need a voice
One voice
Let us amplify
Can you feel momentum shifting
Can you hear the sound
We were once upon missing
We have been found
It starts now
So raise a fist high
This is the first night of beginning of forever
Now let the old die
'Cause there is new life
Forever starts tonight
Our time is now
Now
Now
Now
Its only takes one second to turn it around
We got our minds make up but still a stake in the ground
All the pain all the shame
Have you had enough of it
Are you ready for the change
Can you feel momentum shifting
Can you hear the sound
Can you see the darkness lifting
Now
So raise a fist high
This is the first night of beginning of forever
Now let the old die
'Cause there in new life
Forever starts tonight
Our time is now
Now
Now
Now
Oh loving can divide us
Oh take away our time is now
We rise from ashes
Kings and queens our time is now
So raise a fist high
This is the first night of beginning of forever
Now let the old die
'Cause there in new life
Forever starts tonight
Our time is now
Now
Now
Now <start> Let's swim to the moon
Let's climb through the tide
Penetrate the evenin' that the
City sleeps to hide
Let's swim out tonight love
It's our turn to try
Parked beside the ocean
On our moonlight drive
Let's swim to the moon
Let's climb through the tide
Surrender to the waiting worlds
That lap against our side
Nothin' left open
And no time to decide
We've stepped into a river
On our moonlight drive
Let's swim to the moon
Let's climb through the tide
You reach your hand to hold me
But I can't be your guide
Easy how to love you
As I watch you glide
Falling through wet forests
On our moonlight drive baby
Moonlight drive
Come on baby gonna take a little ride
Down down by the ocean side
Gonna get real close
Get real tight
Baby gonna drown tonight
Goin' down down down <start> In agony they cry and scream
And children and children
And children and children
Skin peeled hanging in strips <start> Guess there's no use in hangin' 'round
Guess I'll get dressed and do the town
I'll find some crowded avenue
Though it will be empty without you
Can't get used to losin' you
No matter what I try to do
Gonna live my whole life through
Loving you
Called up some girl I used to know
After I heard her say Hello
Couldn't think of anything to say
Since you're gone it happens every day
Can't get used to losin' you
No matter what I try to do
Gonna live my whole life through
Loving you
I'll find somebody wait and see
Who am I kiddin' only me
'Cause no one else could take your place
Guess that I am just a hopeless case
Can't get used to losin' you
No matter what I try to do
Gonna live my whole life through
Loving you
Can't get used to losin' you
No matter what I try to do
Gonna live my whole life through
Loving you <start> I could sit and cry
I am never mad
I am burning up
I am broken up
Brace yourself
Brace yourself
Come on play again
Don't just stand and stare
I keep calling you
You keep taking in
Brace yourself
Brace yourself
Brace yourself
Brace yourself
For this
For this
I can brace myself
For this
I can brace myself
For this
Yeah
Brace yourself
Brace yourself
Brace yourself
For this
For this
For this
For this <start> Pop a top again I think I'll have another round
Another one my friend
Then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down
I'd like for you to listen to a joke I heard today
From a woman who said she was through and calmly walked away
I tried to smile and did awhile but it felt so out of place
Did you ever hear of a clown with teardrops streaming down his face
Pop a top again
All to me is misery and here I'm wasting time
Cause a row of fools on a row of stools is not what's on my mind
But then you see her leaving me is not what I prefer
So it's either here a drinking beer or home rememberin' her
Pop a top again <start> By the time I reach tomorrow
I won't be me any way
And I'm not collecting sorrow
Don't disengage
You can't finger what you filter
When it travels like the clouds floating away
I thought he'd never take it this far
I can see where this is going
As the undertow is pulling me down
With your cross examination
I'm receding in the teeth of your plow
But I wont dig my own grave
By the time I reach tomorrow
Will you be there in the you
Is your pride too big to swallow
Know what's true
Did you figure I would falter
When I travel like the clouds floating away
I Thought he'd never take it this far
I can feel I'm getting smaller
As your twisting every word that I say
There's a snare in the forest
Under brush where you want me to play
But I won't dig my own grave
No I won't won't dig my own grave
Bayonne Bayonne Bayonne <start> 
Ever' mornin' won't you you wake up early cook me great big Tbone steak
Serve it to me in bed go on the street and hustle bring me back all the money you make
Won't you rub my body with sweet scented oil cool me with a 'lectric fan
Run to the church fall down on your knees say Lord I wanna thank you for that man
And I'll call that true love true and sweet
That ain't the kind of love I'm gettin'
But baby that's the kind of love I need
I wanna come home every evenin' to a great big meal of wine and roasted pheasant
I want you to say to me Ray hey this is Susy this is Kay I brought 'em both home to you for a present
When The Man downs his soul and find my stash won't you tell 'em it belongs to you
And when you're sittin' in the slam tell all the other chickies when they get out they should look me up too
And I'll call that true love true and sweet
That ain't the kind of love I'm gettin'
But baby that's the kind of love I need
Some guy accuses me of foolin' with his wife threatens to take me apart
Points a gun at me I want you to jump in the middle and take the bullet in your own heart
And as you're lyin' on the floor and dyin' I want you to look up at me and say
Hey Ray I'm sorry I messed up your rug just roll my body out of the way
And I'll call that true love true and sweet
That ain't the kind of love I'm gettin'
But baby that's the kind of love I need
Hollywood calls you on the telephone I want you to turn down the part
And when we're ballin' baby ride on top so I never ever strain my heart
And I'll call that true love true and sweet
That ain't the kind of love I'm gettin'...... <start> Nerve here I burned feeding on his lung
Verve is his curse because he wanted to meet Christ alone
Bitch you're no good
We could be so flown
Misunderstood
We could be
You're God
There in my bones
We could be so flown
Misunderstood
Because we wanted it to be alone
But you will
No you will never find me breach unborn
Never come here watch me burn
Never bitch because your scars show
Never will I burn under and beneath the floor
Before face it
'Cause you're no good
We could have been like one
Beg don't even try
And you will never
Beg <start> Papi papi ven y bsame

Like a kid in a candy store
It's a handcarry situation
Made for lying on the beach
Or dancin' in the streets
You got your pertinent information
Or you can tune in to hear the scores
There's a power in a million stations
You can't ignore
Radio
crank up the power
Radio
rock it for hours and hours
Radio
play it soft and low
Viva la Portable Radio
turn up the power all night
Well I don't want to hear no static
And I don't want to hear no jaw
Put them platters on automatic
I cannot get enough
Got to give me more and more
Play some soul for the congregation
Rock n' roll for the kids next door
Charge up your batteries across the nation
Viva la portable radio
It's xstatic <start> Well she was so fine
On the first impression
I was taken taken in by the view
With eyes so soft
And a face so smooth
I found her selling in a fashion booth
All that I said was do you sell suits
She said you're a scream and your accent's so cute
Her mother had to meet me it all sounded funny
But then my friends told me well the girls got money
It's alright it's okay
Hey don't you worry about a thing
You're the king today but there's a price you may pay
If you take your seat in the royal suite
You might get stranded on easy street
Well she said she was
A good time girl
Laughing laughing a bit too loud
Such a face
The specialist creates
She gets the benefit of the doubt
I know that she wanted more than I could give
But I just had to see how the other half lived
She showed me her friends she showed me her throne
I didn't sell my soul I just took out a loan
It's alright it's okay
Hey don't you worry about a thing
You're the king today but there's a price you may pay
If you take your seat in the royal suite
You might get stranded on easy street
She runs to her mother the social xray star
She put me at the wheel of her father's new car
She loved how her touch made me want to drive farther
She loved how her money meant she'd tell me how far
It's alright it's okay
Hey don't you worry about a thing
You're the king today but there's a price you may pay
If you take your seat in the royal suite
You might get stranded on easy street <start> I am the teacher come to reach ya
Take the old ways back to you
You were lost but I found you
And it's your choice what to do
I've learned a few things as I've traveled through the years
Through the door of evermore
I came through fire came through water
Through the oily serpent's kiss
Climbed the mountain chased the dragon
Thrown myself in the abyss
Do I make myself familiar to you now
'Cause I've been around you
And I'm glad I found you
I am the living flame and I teach the holy games
Teach the secret of the dance
Throw the future in the runes
Kick the sand in Satan's face
I'll put Jesus in his place
Shamen or priest it's all the same
The Magician is my name

The Magician is my name

The Magician is my name

The Magician is my name

And magic is my game
Now I know you and you know me
We have secrets we can share
We can build a new tomorrow
From the trash of yesterday
It won't be the last time
And I'm glad I found you
I am the living flame and I teach the holy games
Teach the secret of the dance
Throw the future in the runes
Kick the sand in Satan's face
I'll put Jesus in his place
Shamen or priest it's all the same
The Magician is my name

The Magician is my name

The Magician is my name

The Magician is my name

The Magician is my name <start> Now the time has come to leave
Darkness fills the sky with grief
You see me crying
You wonder why
Now I have to say goodbye
I see the look that's in your eye
Your love is dying
You wonder why
Now the sun becomes the night
The moon has come and steals its light <start> Billy works too hard trying to make ends meet
He's gotta pay his credit cards
Yeah he's been dealing with the odds
That even Vegas can't beat
By six he's out of bed she makes his coffee sweet
He grabs his boots and his coat
Leaves a note that says 'I love you'
And runs to catch a bus down at the end of market street
It took some time to figure it out
He's a rich man living in a poor man's house
He might be down but he ain't out
He's a rich man living in a poor man's house
Every night at home feels like it's Christmas Eve
And Gracie's got his dinner on the stove Daddy's coming home
And they've got seven hungry children
That are tugging on his sleeve
It took some time to figure it out
He's a rich man living in a poor man's house
He might be down but he ain't out
He's a rich man living in a poor man's house
Every night at five when work lets out
He's a rich man living in a poor man's house
He arrives at nine as the work bell's ringing
And he hits the grind but his heart is singing yeah
Some men live for money some men live for work
But it's a real man richer man who knows what love's worth
It took some time to figure it out
He's a rich man living in a poor man's house
He might be down but he ain't out
He's a rich man living in a poor man's house
Every night at five when work lets out
He's a rich man living in a poor man's house
Sha la la la la la la la
Rich man living in a poor man's house
Rich man living in a poor man's house
Rich man living in a poor man's house
Rich man living in a poor man's house
Rich man living in a poor man's house
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh oh yeah hey <start> Take a seat next to thy devil. Reach and grasp beneath my skin.See my fate. Wreck a lifetime. Gain my heart. Kill my visions. In those days I denied you for every second.
And now I can't accomplish anything. Still got so much more to give in this life. I guess I'm heading for regrets.
Once I sold my soul.
That's one sweet regret. <start> Turning in to something
Drifting off to always
Got to pull myself back in
Holding back the questions
Bruised with all rejections
Got to pull myself back in
We've suffered the breaks
You know I still remember it
It keeps burning away
I know that you may take a while
To come back around
Come back around
I miss you around
Reaching out for someone
Burning out for solo
Got to pull myself back in
There's no new religion
And there's no real solution
Got to pull myself back in
We've suffered the breaks
You know I still remember it
It keeps burning away
I know that you may take a while
To come back around
We've suffered the breaks
You know I still remember it
It keeps burning away
I know that you may take a while
To come back around
Come back around
Come back around
Feel you're going under
So keep on treading water
Got to pull myself back in
Feel no obligation
No more indecision
Got to pull myself back in
We've suffered the breaks
You know I still remember it
It keeps burning away
I know that you may take a while
To come back
We've suffered the breaks
You know I still remember it
It keeps burning away
I know that you may take a while
I know that you may take a while
To come back around <start> Well the fields belong to the farmers
And the forests belong to the king
These days our pleasures are all behind fences
We have to pay for everything
So turn around and come on down
The beach is free
Just turn around and come on down
The beach is free
Well the cities are teeming with people
And the highway is jammed up with cars
And the airport is a nightmare in season
But you don't have to go that far
Just turn around and come on down
The beach is free
Just turn around and come on down
The beach is free
Well they take all the flags down in the evening
And the soldiers stand guard at the keep
But the beaches are always open
'cause the ocean she never sleeps
So turn around and come on down
The beach is free
Just turn around and come on down
The beach is free
So turn around and come on down
The beach is free
Just turn around and come on down
The beach is free <start> noticing the change
We are taking time
Everybody knows
Everybody's fine
And we'll figure out
Purpose in the end
Unless we have to jump
Unless we have to swin
Chorus hold your tongue
Brace yourself
Give me a kiss
Show me what i missed
Can i find a phone
Can i drop a dime
Can i get a loan
Running out of time
And i'll have a toast
To what it's all about
Unless they move us on
Unless they move us out
Seven doglegs hung to dry
It works that way
Postal blowfish make me cry
It works that way
Begging on the nail don't fail
To clue me in
cluster frogs and crabs begin <start> Name one thing on earth lower than a tough guy
Who talks with his fists instead of using his head
Who beats the shit out of anything it can't understand
Behind the muscle mask is a scared little boy
Chorus
Called macho insecurity
Macho insecurity
Macho insecurity
Cause you can't stand
Yourself
Got a bitch with me
Why won't you say it to my face
It's so easy to mouth off to others
But where's your proof
Maybe we can talk if you'd just drop your act
Nothing's ever solved by making childish threats
That's macho insecurity
Chorus <start> Lately youve been acting unsure
Of everything that weve worked for
I cant speak for you but I think we can pull through
No I cannot look ahead to see our future but instead
Ill stick to working presently on you
Chorus
And if theres a storm to weather
A storm to weather
Ill weather it
Ill weather it with you
If theres a storm to weather
A storm to weather
Ill weather it
Ill weather it with you
Time and time again you ask Do you think its gonna last
Im not gonna waste my time reassuring you
I would never lie to you and no I do not have a clue
And if you really think this through
Theres not much we can do

You dont know no you dont know how much you mean to me
And I just know yeah I just know that we are meant to be
 <start> Well there's one kinda favor I'll ask of you
Well there's one kinda favor I'll ask of you
There's just one kind favor I'll ask of you
You can see that my grave is kept clean
And there's two white horses following me
And there's two white horses following me
I got two white horses following me
Waiting on my burying ground
Did you ever hear that coughin' sound
Did you ever hear that coughin' sound
Did you ever hear that coughin' sound
Means another poor boy is underground
Did you ever hear them church bells tone
Have you ever hear that church bells tone
Did you ever hear them church bells tone
Means another poor boy is dead and gone
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
Now I believe what the Bible told
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you
See that my grave is kept clean <start> The chords we play ways left to communicate these roads are paved with plans we've made
And your headboards never felt so safe well they'll reach our graves where your friends
And i will kill the lights and hide oh what a nice suprise dont
Dont tell me when its coming  dont dont i just want to see if for myself dont breathe
Dont make a sound cause the song wont stop till the tape runs out when melody has nothing to hold
I'll be the last sound that you hear as your eyes close and these chords remain
We'll use them to exploit the friends we've since forgot those friends we've lost you
All know just who you are cause ive since made graves but im too scared to etch the names
For fear that im the one whos changed
chorus
The thought of death it scares me to death and i dont know why
I dont know its just too much to never wake up
chorus <start> Do you feel the way you hate
Do you hate the way you feel
Always closest to the flame
Ever closer to the blade
I am poison crazy lush
Built these hands to lift me up
We are servants of our formulaic ways
I'm screaming daisies
From fourteen miles away
I've got my own time
Got it all today
Make up your mind
I need some help
To find this mind
Limbo this and limbo that
You were this and you were that
Ever know that what you fear is what you find
This Indian summer
I signed my life away
There's a greedy fly in here
And I fly away
Make up your mind
I need some help
To find this mind
Make up your mind
I need some help
To find this mind mind mind mind
Make up your mind
I need some help
To find this mind mind mind mind <start> You think that you know the smile on her lips
The thrill at the touch of her fingertips
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
In each caress and each tender kiss
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her
You stole her love from me one day
You didn't care how you hurt me
But you can never steal
Never steal away memories of what used to be
You think she's yours to have and to hold
But someday you'll learn when her love grows cold
That I forgot more than you'll ever know about her
I forgot more than you'll ever know about her <start> It's Friday night the lights are low
We're looking for a place to go
With the play nearly right
All night every night
Honey

Then a voice in the distance grab a hold of you

Whispers boy I'm gonna sexatise you
Don't ever let your private life
Get in the way of your sexy life
She said don't ever let your private life
Get in the way of your sexy life
Well in Paris TX or Paris France
Down in the alley still taking a chance
Home of pleasures live life in a day
If I had my time over I'd do it all again
Sing

Toping my body with a close of you
Step over hear I'm gonna sexatise you
Don't ever let your private life
Get in the way of your sexy life
She said don't ever let your private life
Get in the way of your sexy life
Turn up the powers that power
And ride it right on through
I'm polishing my pretty dolls up
I'm gonna sexatise you
Turn up the powers that power
And ride it right on through
I'm polishing my pretty dolls up
I'm gonna sexatise you
Well there is no such thing as good or bad
Was the experience the best you ever had
Just want to throw it right on your fire
And just like Sly 'I wanted to get higher'
She said don't ever let your private life
Get in the way of your sexy life <start> Me acuerdo y ya hace tiempo
Cuando un recreo era mas que un trofeo
Cuando ser pequeo significaba que eras el 
Y recibir un premio era encontrar el mejor delantero
Metido en aquel cromo tan buscado era tu tesoro
Y gracias fue tan bonito
Por darme tanto cuando era nio
Y gracias lo necesito
Lo llevo dentro y
Vive conmigo
Hacer dao era trampa multiplicar un lio
Y regalar cario no era competitivo
Y a las diez en casa me dejas un ratito
Y de escribir mil cartas todo lo hemos perdido
Y gracias fue tan bonito
Por darme tanto cuando era nio
Y gracias lo necesito
Lo llevo dentro y
Vive conmigo
Un problema era tarea y el amor felicidad
El verano era mas largo mi refugio era mama
Nada se quedaba dentro yo sabia perdonar
Siempre disfrutando el tiempo siempre siendo de verdad
Aquellos  aos aquellos findes que lejos estan
Aquellas ilusiones ya no se tienen no se sienten igual
Aquellas noches largas aquellas plazas y esas ganas de amar
Mi bici amarilla  y aquel verano nunca volveran
Y gracias fue tan bonito
Por darme tanto cuando era nio
Y gracias lo necesito
Lo llevo dentro y
Vive conmigo <start> Inhabitants of the earth a good news day
I've got much to say without pain
I bring hope to you for always
If we hope for what we do not see we wait
Oh how earnestly perseverance
Ever so near it waiting patiently
My hope my promise
You said you'd always be here
No matter what we've done and all the times we fail
You said you would deliver us
Not long until our hope is revealed
I'll keep waiting here for you
Hope that is seen is not a hope at all
Why would one still hope for what he sees
We must wait to be revealed
My hope my promise <start> I had a will of iron
I had a heart of steel
I always call the shots
But honey you shoot to kill
I've spent a hundred other nights like this
A little laughter and a stranger's kiss
But the next thing that I knew
I was heart over head
Over heart over head over you
It's too late to stop it now
I'm heart over head
Over heart over head over you
I never once imagined
A night like this before
That love would last for hours
And still I begged for more
If I sound a little crazy
Well forgive me please
My head is swimmin'
And I'm on my knees
Cryin' Love me love me do
Because I'm heart over head
Over heart over head over you
Too late to stop it now
I'm heart over head
Over heart over head over you
Can't seem to slow down
Can't even touch the ground
The harder I try
The higher I fly
I'm fallin' heart over head
Over heart over head over you
Where did you get your touch
I'm heart over head
Over heart over head over you
I like it much too much
Heart over head
Over heart over head over you
Too late to stop it now
I'm heart over head
Over heart over head over you... <start> When you sleep.... where do your fingers go
what do your fingers know
what do your fingers show
where do your fingers go... yea
when you sleep... do they tremble..on the edge.. of the bed
or do you fold them... neatly.. by your head
do they clench like claws against your own skin
when youre living your day all over again
When you sleep.... where do your fingers go
what do your fingers know
what do your fingers show
where do your fingers go... yea
when you sleep... do they tremble..on the edge.. of the bed
or do you fold them... neatly.. by your head
do they clench like claws against your own skin
when youre living your day all over again
do they play guitar in a latin bar
are they strangers or lovers do they drive your car
are they swimming submissivly sex acts of life
or just cutting through jello with a very sharp knife
now Zeus was a womanizer
always on the lake
but Hera usually punished her
that Zeus was one to take
when you sleeeeeeeeeeeeep
where do your fingers go
Are they pulling out weeds form the dusty soil
are they never rewarded fruits of the toil
are they scratching their nails on the chalk boards of death
only seeking attention when everyone in the room has left
When you sleep.... where do your fingers go
what do your fingers know
what do your fingers show
where do your fingers go... yea
when you sleep... do they tremble..on the edge.. of the bed
or do you fold them... neatly.. by your head <start> I need someone's hands
To lead me through the night
I need someone's arms
Just to squeeze and hold me tight
And when the night began
And the days have end
I need your love so bad
I need someone's lips
To feel next to mine
I need someone to stand up and tell me
When I'm lying
And when the lights are low
And it's time to go
I need your love so bad
So give it up
And bring it home to me
Write it on a piece of paper
So it can be read to me
Tell me you love me
And stop driving me mad
'Cause I need your love so bad
I need a soft voice
To talk to me at night
Don't worry baby
Don't fuzz and fight
So listen to my plea
Bring it home to me
'Cause I need your love so bad
Ohohoh I need your love so bad <start> You stood on a darkened
Edge of a dead end street
Stuck inside of a whirlwind
The same way you wished for me
Slave to your needs
Your claws are on my back
I don't know if I'm gonna last
From this pain
In my heart from your rejection
I got pain
In my heart like an injection
All out of glory
I'll never be the same
Behind my smile there's a twisted mind
If fills my heart with pain
I'm just looking for something
Something that's good and true
But it seems like I'm always waiting
You love can be so cruel
All my suspicions steering me away
That kind of poison driving me insane
Your love's the curse got me feeling low
All I've ever known
Pain and rejection
In my heart like an injection
Pain and rejection
All I need is your affection
So I'm running

I keep on running from your loving'

I'm running from what I am becoming

From what you are


You stood on a darkened
Edge of a dead end street
Stuck inside of a whirlwind
The same way you wished for me
Locked to your needs
Pain and rejection
In my heart like an injection
Pain and rejection
All I need is your affection
All my suspicions steering me away
That kind of poison driving me insane
Your love's the curse got me feeling low
All I've ever known
Got me feeling low
I gotta let you go
All I've ever know <start> How Lucky are we that we have lights so that we can see
Although the day is done
What a miracle that a spark lifts these candles out of the dark
Every evening one by one
Until the end of Hanukkah of Hanukkah
With the jingle bells and the toys
And the TV shows and noise
It's easy to forget
At the end of the day
Our whole family will say
These words for Hanukkah
Baruch atah Adonai eloheinu
Melech ha'olam
Asher kid'shanu b'mitz'votav v'tzivanu l'hadlik ner shel Hanukkah
Light the candles for Hanukkah for Hanukkah
We remember how Maccabees
Fought so all of us could be free
And so we celebrate on this festival of the lights
There's a joyful time every night
But we illuminate the candles of Hanukkah of Hanukkah
Baruch atah Adonai Eloheinu melech ha'olam
She'asa niseem la'avoteinu bayamim haheim baz'man hazeh
Hanukkah
Hanukkah <start> I wrote my letter to Argentina today
And it made me sad that she's so far away
But I'm looking forward to the day I save some time
So I can see her before I lose my mind
Miss Argentina I'd like to know
When will I see her my heart cries out so
Left you at the Greyhound station just the other day
And it made me sad as I watched you walk away
That day at work you were the only thing on my mind
The way you smiled when you sung your Spanish rhyme
Miss Argentina I'd like to know
When will I see her my heart cries out so
Miss Argentina I'd really like to know
When will I see her this here heart cries out so
Horns  Dub
I wrote my letter to Argentina today
And it made me sad that she's so far away
The suddeness of her smile and how she looks so sweet
She's wrapped up in my soul there is where she'll always be
Miss Argentina I'd like to know
When will I see her my heart cries out so
Miss Argentina I'd really like to know
When will I see her this here heart cries out so
Horns <start> I know that there's something you're not tellin' me
Maybe I don't want to hear you say it
Don't think that you're somewhere you're not supposed to be
'cause you're not you know that I want you here
Sometimes I fall apart and don't know what to do
She brings me back again
It's like tryin' to breathe underwater
I'm just tryin' to break down a wall
You're offering me all the answers
I won't throw them away like before
You told me that life's too short to have regret
Every word you said has a stronger meaning
Leaving is the last thought there to cross my mind
Gonna close my eyes to yesterday
Sometimes I fall apart and don't know what to do
She brings me back again
It's like tryin' to breathe underwater
I'm just tryin' to break down a wall
You're offering me all the answers
I won't throw them away like before
Sometimes I fall apart and don't know what to do
She brings me back again
It's like tryin' to breathe underwater
I'm just tryin' to break down a wall
You're offering me all the answers
I won't throw them away throw them away like before
Throw them away like before
Throw them away like before
Throw them away like before
Throw them away like before <start> Dropped acid Blue Oyster Cult concert fourteen years old
And I thought them lasers were a spider chasing me.
On my way home got pulled over in Rogersville Alabama
With a halfounce of weed and a case of Sterling Big Mouth.
My buddy Gene was driving he just barely turned sixteen.
And I'd like to say I'm sorry but we lived to tell about it
And we lived to do a whole lot more crazy stupid shit.
And I never saw Lynyrd Skynyrd but I sure saw Molly Hatchet
With  Special and the Johnny Van Zant Band.
One night when I was seventeen I drank a fifth of vodka
On an empty stomach then drove over to a friend's house.
And I backed my car between his parent's Cadillac's without a scratch.
Then crawled to the back door and slithered threw the key hole
And sneaked up the stares
And puked in the toilet.
I passed out and nearly drowned but his sister DD pulled me out.
And I never saw Lynyrd Skynyrd but I sure saw Molly Hatchet
And the band that I was in played The Boy's are Back in Town.
Skynyrd was set to play Huntsville
Alabama in the spring of  I had a ticket but it got canceled.
So the show it was rescheduled for the Street Survivors Tour.
And the rest as they say is history.
So I never saw Lynyrd Skynyrd
But I sure saw Ozzy Osbourne with Randy Rhoads in 
Right before that plane crash.
And I never saw Lynyrd Skynyrd but I sure saw ACDC
With Bon Scott singing Let There Be Rock Tour.
With Bon Scott singing let there be rock <start> Damn you're so dull
Still need to borrow your hate
Change what they can
Persuade us back under cover
Oh old you're so over
Who made you king of the ages
Tending the wounds
Thinking of adding another
But the
Chosen never wrong
He sat holding
Several thoughts
I'll take anything
That's not bolted down
Tricking us in don't get along if they're brothers
So phasing it out correcting vision with fists
And drawing a line still give it less than a week
Checking the wounds thinking of adding another
Free what's bolted down <start> I got frostbitten in the winter
Ice skating on the river
With my pretty little blackeyed girl
She'd make your darn toes curl just to see her
I got a fringe front on my buggy
I got a frisky little colt in a hurry
And a pretty little blackeyed Suzie by my side
Well she sure knows how to use me
Pretty little blackeyed Suzie
Playing hooky with my heart all the time
Living with her funky family
In a derelict old alley
Down by the river where we share a little loving in the moonshine
I'm an old hayseed harp player
I'm the hit of the county fair
With my pretty little blackeyed girl
Living proof as she swirls
She's a dancer <start> In and out of darkness in and out of sleep
Trying to keep my hands upon the wheel
Never saw the corner in the driving rain
I never saw her step into the street
Dreaming while you sleep
Dreaming while you sleep
Memories to keep
Dreaming while you sleep
I can never understand what went through my mind
I didn't stop to see what I had done
I had to keep on driving deep into the night
The miles between would somehow put it right
Dreaming while you sleep
Dreaming while you sleep
Memories to keep
Dreaming while you sleep
All my life you lie silently there
All my life in a world so unfair
All my life and only I'll know why
And it will live inside of me
I will never be free all my life
Trapped in her memory all my life
Till the day that you open your eyes
Please open your eyes
Dreaming while you sleep
Dreaming while you sleep
Heard it on the radio saw it on TV
But could I take my secret to the grave
If I had another chance would I do the same
Dreaming while you sleep
Dreaming while you sleep
Dreaming while you sleep
Are you dreaming while you sleep 
All my life I'll be haunted by
All my life just one moment in time
All my life until the day I die
And it will live inside of me
I will never be free all my life
Trapped in her memory all my life
Till the day that you open your eyes
All of my life you lie silently there
All my life in a world so unfair
All my life and only I know why
And it will live inside of me
I will never be free all my live
Trapped in her memory all my life
Till the day that you open your eyes <start> Loneliness is the coat you wear
A deep shade of blue is always there
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
Tears are always clouding your eyes
When you're without love
Baby
Emptiness is the place you're in
Nothing to lose but no more to win
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
Tears are always clouding your eyes
When you're without love
Lonely
Without you
Baby
Oh I need you
I can't go on
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
Tears are always clouding your eyes
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
When you're without love
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
Not anymore
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
Bring it back baby
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore

All right
A sea of destruction
Build your ship and sail across the sea of flame
Leviathans will guide you into where they say
Kings dig ditches witches stitch in witches' time
And proper paupers are of sound body and mind
Greenest genius of the fallen fool
All the beggars play by the beggars' own rules

I see a lot of hate
Pushing me away
You're haunted by a past
A past that brings you down
So you throw it all away
Again
Just try to find a place deep within your soul
And don't deny the child living deep inside
Open your eyes and find
This life's better than you know
It's in your hands now
Just open up your eyes
Deep inside of your mind
You're forced to believe
That nothing's gonna change
So I take you by the hand
And I lead you to a place
A place of happiness
Like this

You make no sound and yet you cry
It's not the double cross
You feel the love you lost oh no
This letter has to say goodbye
So now you thank him carefully oh no
'Cause that's the way he's going to be oh no
I hope you find some reason to be free
You saw them in the park
The laughter in the dark oh no
How can you face him and pretend
So now you thank him carefully oh no
'Cause that's the way he's going to be oh no
I hope you find some reason to be free <start> In the dark in the night
Damned by what you see
Where ever that bitter light shall burn
Man's own misery
Sorcerers good and bad
Makes you toss and turn
In the deepest catacomb
He hears the call
he is the prey
And she wants it all
He's not giving up his life
In the dark of the night <start> I've lost my faith in everything
I couldn't believe in anything
Until I put my faith in you
Is it a sin is it a crime
To worship somebody all of the time
Anytime I would do anything for you
I've found my heaven right here with you
Believe in me forever I believe in you
Not just on Sunday I love you everyday
And I fall to my knees
Every night I pray since
You've come and saved me
For all eternity
In the name of the Father and the Son
You are my religion
I wasn't looking for a miracle
Didn't think that love was possible
But your love has made me whole
And I pray that this will never end
You are my lover my best friend
You took me in and saved my soul
I've found my heaven right here with you
Believe in me forever I believe in you
Not just on Sunday I love you everyday
And I fall to my knees
Every night I pray since
You've come and saved me
For all eternity
In the name of the Father and the Son
You are my religion
Not just on Sunday I love you everyday
And I fall to my knees
Every night I pray since
You've come and saved me
For all eternity
In the name of the Father and the Son
You are my religion
And forgive me for the things that I have done
In the name of the father and the Son
You are my religion <start> No my eyes ain't silver
No no my eyes ain't blue
When your well it ain't got no water
I don't hate you I pity you
On a saigon night in God's sky
There's a butterfly on your wrist
The flies are stuck to your neck
You see the... Search planes are out for you
Better call the neurosurgeon
Our dreaming space it is open
Into the hospital I go
I said you better call the neurosurgeon
Our dreaming space it is open
Into the hospital I go
Watch me go
Watch me go
Here I go...
A newborn is coming
Watch me go...
When I'm at war with the world I turn to you
When I am searching thru the downpour you melt me
Thru and thru
When I'm at war with the world I turn to you
When I am searching thru the downpour you melt me
Thru and thru thru and thru thru and thru...
Better call the neurosurgeon
Our dreaming space it is open
Into the hospital I go
I said you better call the neurosurgeon
Our dreaming space it is open
Into the hospital I go...
Watch me go
Watch me go
Here I go...
A newborn is coming
Watch me go... <start> The world 's getting so insane
Need something to kill the pain
Turn that shit off the radio
Tell me you're on double zero
Lara Croft's high on dope
My computer starts to ooze
Better go buy me a riot
I've got somes euros left to use
Buy a riot Buy a riot
Buy a riot Buy me a riot
Marc sold his head to a pawnshop
Thinking he could get a better one
'cause everything's for salein a pawnshop
Why don't you buy me a riot
Buy a riot Buy a riot
Buy a riot Buy me a riot <start> Trained to be a bone digger
A soul sister a born winner.
And maybe we are two sinners
Who go bigger but burn quicker.
The lies the lies the bullshit and the lies.
Like oh I could have died yeah lucky to be alive.
I want truth and reason clean and decent.
I want new school teachings deeper meanings.
Thought I'd be a bone digger
a stone figure a quick trigger.
But now I see a life richer
A nice picture the lights flicker.
The lies the lies the bullshit and the lies.
Like oh I could have died yeah lucky to be alive.
I want truth and reason clean and decent.
I want new school teachings ancient secrets. <start> Turn away as the storm draws near
Hear the thunder's distant cry
Taste the air to find a trace of yesterday
Falling under waves of time
Her twilight eyes turn the night sky red
Timeless words cannot fade
Though our skies grow grey
Haunted winds speak of fallen homes
Painted eyes leave a tear
In her heart I place a promise that shall live
Amongst December's fondest dreams
To never find this life again
To never find our way <start> In love with love in love with a passionate heart
In love with love in love even when we're apart
In love with love in love with a passionate heart
In love with love in love even when we're apart
I wondered the difference of how it could last
I heard the celebration of champagne in glass
No wonder it's no wonder why I'm
In love with love in love with a passionate heart
In love with love in love with the form of the art
We love through the fighting of everyday life
Of glass that gets broken and cuts like a knife
I wonder and I wonder why I'm
In love with love in love with a passionate heart
In love with love then on with the delicate march
Heart of fire house of fire 
Heart of fire house of fire
Heart of fire house of fire 
Heart of fire house of fire
Heart of fire house of fire 
Heart of fire house of fire
Heart of fire house of fire 
Heart of fire house of fire
Heart of fire house of fire 
Heart of fire house of fire
In love with love in love with a passionate heart
In love with love on fire with a passionate heart
Ablaze with reflection our hot house is set
Blazing with a flaming with a fire it's so passionately racing
With a chaser it's so hard to keep my wits about me
Yeah yeah yeah
Heart of fire house of fire
Heart of fire house of fire
Heart of fire house of fire
Heart of fire house of fire
Heart of fire house of fire 
In love with a passionate heart  <start> Instrumental <start> Noc przytula mnie
Pieci z caych si
Jej oddaj to co mam
Oddaj sny...
Daj swoje sny
Daj to co mam
I przez cay czas
Wiem
Nie jestem sam
Budz si przy blasku ostrych barw
Guchn w wielkim huku susznych salw
Dawi si sowami  kt <start> I know I have found a perfect way to aggravate you without a word
I would cast a glance at you and then I wait until it hurts
You gotta listen to the silence read between the lines that you can find
Cause it doesn take a single word to tell you what is on my mind
So how much did you understand of everything I didn say
Get going  You work it out
Get going  The time is running out
Get going  Figure it out
No need to talk about it
Get going  You work it out
Get going  The time is running out
Get going  Go sort it out
No need to talk about it 
I can feel the tension when I look at you like a loaded gun
So you call me triggerhappy
Don you know the show has just begun
Il stare you down Il steal your crown without a sound
Tell me are you ready for a knockout in the final round <start> You say that you can and then you run to get your mummy
And youre almost beaten to the punch
Looking for the man who sold you the dummy
And youre almost beaten to the punch
Laughing at the older guys who say its just as well
Saved by the wedding bell
Almost beaten to the punch
Youre looking for somebody new that you can knock around
You are almost beaten to the punch
If youve got a head for figures then youd better count me out
You were almost beaten to the punch
You pulled the piece but you soon called it love
You go hand in glove
Almost beaten to the punch
Your body speaks much louder than your voice
You let it do the talking so I dont have any choice
Now you find the younger guys are putting up resistance
And youre almost beaten to the punch
You better get out now because youll never go the distance
And youre almost beaten to the punch
Youll find a girl and youll promise her anything
Even a wedding ring
Almost beaten to the punch <start> Seems like it's here today
And we'll be here tomorrow
I don't know why we have to stay so long
I know
It's you
I want
To think about
It's you I need for
Everything
So don't
Let this get harder
'Cos I still can't seem
To fight it out
To fight it out
I got to thinking that
With every day that passes
I feel as though
I couldn't wait so long
I know
It's you
I want
To think about
Do you need me for
Anything
So don't
Let this get harder
'Cos I still can't seem
To fight it out
To fight it out
Seems like it's here today
And we'll be here tomorrow
I don't know why we have to stay so long
So don't
Let this get harder
'Cos I still can't seem
To fight it out
Seems like it's here today
Seems like it's here today
Seems like it's here today
Seems like it's here today <start> By the rivers of Babylon
Where he sat down
And there he wept
When he remember Zion
It was the wicked
CHORUS
Carry us away captivity
Require from us a song
How can we sing King Alfa's song
In a strange land <start> Nobody knows my love for you
Nobody knows my love for you
This love could not be truer
nobody knows my love for you
Nobody knows I yearn for you
Nobody knows I yearn for you
This heart could not be truer
Nobody knows I yearn for you
Nobody knows my wasted days
Nobody knows my sin filled nights
They'll never know how hard i fight
Nobody knows my love for you
Nobody knows my love for you
Nobody knows my love for you
No they'll never know the things I do
nobody knows i yearn for you
How this fire will always burn for you
Nobody knows my love for you <start> Back in black
I hit the sack
I've been too long I'm glad to be back
Yes I'm let loose
From the noose
That's kept me hanging about
I've been looking at the sky
'Cause it's gettin' me high
Forget the hearse 'cause I never die
I got nine lives
Cat's eyes
Abusin' every one of them and running wild
'Cause I'm back
Yes I'm back
Well I'm back
Yes I'm back
Well I'm back back
Well I'm back in black
Yes I'm back in black
Back in the back
Of a Cadillac
Number one with a bullet I'm a power pack
Yes I'm in a bang
With a gang
They've got to catch me if they want me to hang
'Cause I'm back on the track
And I'm beatin' the flack
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
So look at me now
I'm just makin' my play
Don't try to push your luck just get out of my way
'Cause I'm back
Yes I'm back
Well I'm back
Yes I'm back
Well I'm back back
Well I'm back in black
Yes I'm back in black
Well I'm back yes I'm back
Well I'm back yes I'm back
Well I'm back back
Well I'm back in black

Oh yeah yeah oh yeah
Back in now
Well I'm back I'm back
Back 
Back 
Back 
Back 
Back
Back in black
Yes I'm back in black
Out of the sight <start> If someone told you there is
No way to get way out of this
Then what
And if you're keeping this heart
From coming completely apart
Then what
And if the rich are begging for more
On the doorsteps of the poor
Then what
Then what is it I've got
If someone told you there is
No way to get way out of this
Then what
Oh girl and if you're the last thing
that's keeping this heart from coming completely apart
Then what
And if in the warmth and the rhythm of your skin
I lost everything I could win
Then what
Then what is it I've got.
I used to think that I used to think I had it all
But that was long before I knew
What a girl like you could do
I used to think that I used to think I had it all
But that was long before I knew
What a girl like you could do
And if your eyes that draw you in
Don't reveal anything
And if the salt that lay thin
On the sweat on your skin
Retreated deep in
To your body again
Well what is it it then
What is it then
Of what is it I've got <start> Heavy night it was a heavy night
Feels like we come back from the dead
Heavy night it was a heavy night
I cannot remember what I said to anyone
If we get up now we can catch the afternoon
Watch the under s playing football in the park
Let's sit in St. Leonard's in this alcoholic day
We're doing the best with what we've got
I love you in the morning 
When you're still hungover
I love you in the morning
When you're still strung out
I love you in the morning
I would cry all week and so do you
We discern to let us sleep
Let all the droughts creep in to reach for this life
There might be white to smatter you in
That have the right answers
That we British forget
About those north eastern gaps
I love you in the morning 
When you're still hungover
I love you in the morning
When you're still strung out
I love you in the morning
With you I am cut from a pearl in your oyster
Head on my chest a silent smile a private kind of happiness
You see giant proclamations are all very well
But our love is louder than words <start> Such a little niggle
The tiniest of touch
So easy to brush aside when everything looks up
But blossomed into chaos
The icy hands of rage reach deep into your system
And pull a piece away
So far away
And it's not coming fast enough at all
And it ain't easy to break through that wall
It's not always better to keep those thoughts at bay
You know what they say  it's never too late
To wash away the pain
To make it all okay
To start again and clean the slate
One too many counters to knock you right around
Splitting hairs halfway to find that middle ground
Endless frustration at another compromise
You want to feel want to live
Want to see with those eyes
I look into your smile and there's nothing in there to see
You seem so distant to me
You know what they say  it's never too late
To wash away the pain
To make it all okay
To start again and clean the slate
And I know you need some space to try it your way
But I'm scared you'll go astray
What am I supposed to do Sacrifice my goals
What am I supposed to do Stand by and let you go
Never...
You know what they say it's never too late
But the past has had its way
The leaves have blown and winters here to stay <start> High highest in the open sky
Fate is a world you can't deny
Bring you will bring the axle down
We escalate to hear the sound
Standin' on my shoulder I can feel ya gettin' bolder
In the light of day
Goodbye Arizona I can see that you're a loner
And you shine away
Orion Orion
Born you were born within the light
I plant the seed before your flight
Standin' on my shoulder I can feel ya gettin' bolder
In the light of day
Goodbye Arizona I can see that you're a loner
And you shine away
High highest in the open sky
Fate is a world you can't deny
Standin' on my shoulder I can feel ya gettin' bolder
In the light of day
Goodbye Arizona I can see that you're a loner
And you shine away
Standin' on my shoulder I can feel ya gettin' bolder
In the light of day
Goodbye Arizona I can see that you're a loner
And you shine away
Orion
Orion
Orion <start> I exit through the spotlight glare
I stepped out into thin air
Into a perfume so rarefied
Here comes the bride
Not quite aside they snide she's number four
There's number three just by the door
Those in the know don't even flatter her they go one better
She was selling speedboats in a trade show when he met her
Look at her now
She's starting to yawn
She looks like she was born to it
But it was so much easier
When I was cruel
She reaches out her arms to me
Imploring another melody
So she can dance her husband out on the floor
The captains of industry just
Lie there where they fall
In eaudenil and pale carnation creation
A satin sash and velvet elevation
She straightens the tipsy headdress of her spouse
While hers recalls a honey house
There'll be no sorrows left to drown
Early in the morning in your evening gown
But it was so much easier
When I was cruel
The entrance hall was arranged
With hostesses and ushers
Who turned out to be the younger wives
Nursing schoolgirl crushes
Parting the waves of those
Few feint friends
Fingers once offered are now too
Heavy to extend
The ghostly first wife glides up
On stage whispering to raucous talkers
Spilling family secrets out to
Flunkey's and castrato walkers
See that girl watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen
Two newspaper editors like playground sneaks
Running a book on which of them is going to last the week
One of them calls to me and he says I know you
You gave me this tattoo back in '
You were a spoilt child then with a record to plug
And I was a shaven headed seaside thug
Things haven't really changed that much
One of us is still getting paid too much
There are some things I incomprehensible report
The memory of his last retort
But it was so much easier
When I was cruel oh
Look at me now she's starting to yawn
She looks like she was born to it
Ah but it was so much easier
When I was cruel <start> We give we take we bend until we break
We touch and feel to hurt or heal
And in the end
We run so far from who we really are
And we starve and thirst we praise and curse
And I don't care
How near or far I'll find you wherever you are
You know I'll find you wherever you go
We shout and scream but it's just a silly dream
And we hold it inside like its live or die
Till in the end we learn to wait
And we squeeze the hands of fate
And we twist and turn
We freeze and burn but I don't care
How near or far I'll find you wherever you are
You know I'll find you wherever you go
Through the time and space
I'll always see your face
And if I must count every star
How near or far I'll find you wherever you are
You know I'll find you wherever you go <start> When a dream survives the longest night
And the vision takes a hold
When a breath inspires it's a sign of life
You're the string and I'm the bow
Jump in the flow
Just get carried by the flow
Where the bank defines the water's edge
The river in my spine
As we circulate maybe we shall collide
You're the space and I am the time
Jump in the flow
We get carried by the flow
Through a sleep I ride
Feel like a night that shines
With a memory of long ago
We drank to them
Said goodbye as friends
We survive we survive it so
Back in the flow
Carried by the flow
Just look how far you've been
Look how far you've come
All the things you've achieved
Don't try and find any reason
Get carried by it
Jump in the flow <start> I've been down I've been beat
I've been tossed into the street
Making nickels begging dimes
Just to get my bottle of wine
Some say Life she's a lady
Kind of soft kind of shady
I can't tell you Life is rich
She's no lady she's a bitch
They suck my body out
But then there is no doubt
Gonna pay the devil his dues
Cause I'm so sick of being abused
Eat the rich eat the rich
Don't you know life is a bitch
Eat the rich eat the rich
Out of the palace and into the ditch
Steal my money steal my car
Took my woman and an old guitar
Running crazy running wild
Blind ally in my eye
Just can't fight the temptation
It's become my inspiration
Gonna get myself an axe
Break some heads and break some backs
They suck my body out
But then there is no doubt
Gonna pay the devil his dues
Cause I'm so sick of being abused
Eat the rich eat the rich
Don't you know life is a bitch
Eat the rich eat the rich
Out of the palace and into the ditch
Don't stop me
Eat the rich eat the rich
Don't you know life is a bitch
Eat the rich eat the rich
Out of the palace and into the ditch
Eat the rich eat the rich
Don't you know life is a bitch
Eat the rich eat the rich
Out of the palace and into the ditch
Out of the palace and into the ditch
They suck my body out <start> Fire up the propaganda mills
We're going in for the kill
Just as recklessly as before
I've seen you as you've filled the streets
With slogans and careless poetry
And I know how little it all means
Bodies overflowing my front page
Bodies crowding towards the center stage
Bodies pile higher everyday
Bodies all swear they got something to say
Ringing in with what I don't care about
I know your ego's whereabouts
And you're too fickle for me to mind
You see the blood that's being shed
You raise your voice but nothing's said
Just another body whose voice will fade <start> I could tell you a story of shame
I could talk for hours on how we became
A flower that bloomed in one day
The next day our glory faded away
Divided by hostilities
Hung up on issues we disagreed
A body that's been torn apart
We're still a body with a healthy heart
People like me persons like you
We wanna be closer to God
Closer to free
All you people like me
What do you think when you see
Continuous losers the people like me
I hope you never believe
Just for a moment you're better than me
The truth is that we are the same
All different people but only one name
I hope that you will agree
That all of you are people like me
People like me persons like you
We wanna be closer to God
Closer to free
All you people like me
I can't stand by myself anymore
I forgot what we're fightin' for
Please come take my hand
We will make our stand
Feels so good to me be so free
People like me persons like you
We wanna be closer to God
Closer to free
All you people like me
The truth is that we are the same
All different people but only one name
I hope that you will agree
That all of you are people like me <start> She must have known from the moment she saw him
From the look in his eye and the way that he smiled
She must have dreamed of lying beside him
His hands on her body his whispers of love
There is nothing that the eye can't see
There is nothing that the heart can't feel
There is nothing that a love can't heal
Whatever is waiting it is meant to be
It is meant to be
She must have felt the stirrings of passion
It's been missing so long with the man in her life
But now at last there is someone beside her
Somebody to guide her someone to love
There is nothing that the eye can't see
There is nothing that the heart can't feel
There is nothing that a love can't heal
Whatever is waiting it is meant to be
Oh the time will come when we'll be living the dream
It's that miracle moment for being what we believe
There is nothing that the eye can't see
There is nothing that the heart can't feel
There is nothing that a love can't heal
Whatever is waiting sooner or later it is meant to be
It is meant to be it was meant to be
She must have known it was meant to be
She must have known it was meant to be
She must have known it was meant to be
She must have known now she's heading for the sunshine
She must have known she's gonna be like Shirley Valentine
She must have known it was meant to be
She must have known it was meant to be
She must have known now she's heading for the sunshine
She must have known she's gonna be like Shirley Valentine
She must have known <start> So maybe I wasn't
That good a friend
But you were one of us
And I will wonder
Just like anyone
If there was something
Else I could've done
So maybe it's true that
Your cry for help
Was oh so very faint
But still I heard
And knew something was wrong
Just nothing you could put your finger on
And I will wonder
Just like anyone
Just like anyone <start> Your world full of creeps
Zombies walk the street
 to  barely alive
Have a beer go to sleep
And start all over again
Same gray suit
Same brown shoes
Same headache
Same pills
He goes home thinks about suicide
But he's got his diploma ya got to give him that
I got a radical place
Got my own private space
It's my sanctuary
It's the castle of doom
I'm the king of my room
Just a Quasimodo
Let the world blow away
This is where I will stay
In my sanctuary
Got my mess on the floor
Got my lock on my door
Go Away Sanctuary
Go Away Sanctuary
Someday I gotta get outta here
Gotta put on a shirt put on a tie
Get a job buy a car get some insurance
'Cause I'll probably have a heart attack by the time I'm 
I guess I'll find the perfect wife
And I'll have . perfect kids
And if I work real hard
And if I die real fast
They'll all turn out just like me
I got a radical place
Got my own private space
It's my sanctuary
It's the castle of doom
I'm the king of my room
Just a Quasimodo
Let the world blow away
This is where I will stay
In my sanctuary
Got my mess on the floor
Got my lock on my door
Go Away Sanctuary
Go Away Sanctuary
Go Away Sanctuary
Go Away Sanctuary
I got a radical place
Got my own private space
It's my sanctuary
It's a castle of doom
I'm the king of my room
Just a Quasimodo
Let the world blow away
This is where I will stay
In my sanctuary
Got my mess on the floor
Got my lock on my door
Go Away Sanctuary
Go Away Sanctuary
Go Away Sanctuary
Go Away Sanctuary <start> I'm pushing I'm pushing
I'm pushing through
I'm pushing through face
I'm pushing through facedown
I'm pushing through facedown
I'm pacing inside this empty room
Told to wait till my life's withdrawn
Uneasy I'm waiting here anxiously
It's a waste and I won't wait another Eon
Endless night
Long for light
My head against this tomb
And pushing through
I'm pushing through
Facedown and pushing through
Trapped and isolated
Time is dislocated
Eternity is what a moment seems
When I can't feel anything
Erasing my final memories
They won't stop till my whole life's gone
Uneasy I wait for normality
It's a waste and I won't wait another Eon
Endless night
Long for light
My head against this tomb
And pushing through
I'm pushing through
Facedown and pushing through
Trapped and isolated
Time is dislocated
Eternity is what a moment seems
When I can't feel anything
When life is gone without a trace
And hope is lost in time's embrace
I won't wait or hesitate 'cause I'm pushing through facedown
I won't wait or hesitate 'cause I'm pushing through
If time's a song I won't wait for its reprise
I am done wishing farewells and goodbyes
I won't let this place overshadow my birthright
I won't wait another Eon
Impatiently
Impatiently
I'm cutting through the earth in front of me
Bone on stone blood and sweat married
Can't hear the voice that whispers fears when my heart is pounding in my ears
All I see in my mind is not what I've left behind
But all the things I've been missing in that lost Eon
Endless night
Long for light
My head against this tomb
And pushing through
Trapped and isolated
Time is dislocated
Eternity is what a moment seems
When I am lost inside this dream
When I can't speak and I can't scream
And I can't feel anything <start> When I come home I know it's you that I'll find
Pacing the floors once again
I know that I'm bored I'm staying in bed too long
Counting the holes in the door
Damaged is the way I feel
My life is running away
Alone I'm a mess I don't care how long it's been
I know I'm just wasting away
The clothes on the floor just like the mountains outside
The prison I live every day
Damaged is the way I feel
My life is running away
I want to know if this is real
All of these things that I feel
I want to know if this is real
All of these things that I feel
Damaged is the way I feel
My life is running away
I want to know if this is real
All of these things that I feel
I want to know if this is real
All of these things that I feel
I want to know if this is real
All of these things that I feel
I want to know if this is real
All of these things that I feel
When I come home I know it's you that I'll find
Pacing the floors once again <start> On the highway thirty people lost their lives.
On the highway thirty people lost their lives.
Well I had some words to holler and my Rosie took a ride.
In the moonlight see the greyhound rollin' on.
In the moonlight see the greyhound rollin' on.
Flyin' through the crossroads rosie ran into the hound.
For the graveyard thirty boxes made of bone.
For the graveyard thirty boxes made of bone.
Mister undertaker take this coffin from my home.
In the midnight hear me cryin' out her name.
In the midnight hear me cryin' out her name.
I'm standin' on the railroad waitin' for the graveyard train.
On the highway thirty people turned to stone.
On the highway thirty people turned to stone.
Oh take me to the station 'cause I'm number thirtyone. <start> 
A long time ago from the valley of the sun
Came the holy power
When the gods were one
Searching for a new home
Searching for this land
Guided by the stars and a vision they had seen
The pillars of the temple
In these hills of green
Buried deep inside for only us to find

It is the roar of the wind
The power of the sun
The strength of a thousand bows
And those who near it again will fear it again
And it's here in the heart of the rose
Painted in the sky was the moment to awake
All that lay within you
As this dawn should break
With this force awoken none can stand before
This is the hour now is the time
Driven by the purest love I give you mine
All that we must be is everything we see

Our love has brought us both together
And it's our love that will go on forever
There is no love that can become as one
Before it's time <start> I have snipped your wingspan
My precious captive swan.
Here all clipped of kickstand
Your spirit won't last long.
Don't you lift a finger.
Don't you snap and jaw.
Limber limbs akimbo
Restful rubbing raw
Oh my own true love
Oh my own true love
Can you hear me love
Can you hear me love
Don't hold out for rescue.
None can hear your call
Till I have wrest and wrecked you
Behind these fortress walls. <start> They don't call me this for nothing
Clueless to the fact I know something
Clueless are the masses
They better off staying paranoid
They don't know how true this really is
Pull my string but no I'm not talking
The polygraph I guarantee won't be on the record
Ronnie Raygun
Nowhere to hide nowhere to run
My brain is frozen numb from debriefing
Ignore the transmissions I was receiving
Does SDI have lasers beaming saucers in the sky
Black budget unmarked helicopters
Chase me home and drop me off there
They call me in the middle of the night end
Tell me to return
Clearance majestic
Erase my existence
Alleged intimidation
Hypnosis mind control <start> Once we're together naturally
When I'm not here and you're not away from me
And we're finally home I'm gonna kiss you just like I did
That time the breeze slid through the open door
Then I know I won't miss you anymore
Like I do now
Like I do now
Like I do now
Taking the wait as long as I can
Too many days is too hard to stand
So I'm on my way on an airplane in the sky
In a taxi on the Triborough Rail coming in
I wonder if you're sleeping
I want to wake you up <start> And I could easily fall from grace
Then another would take my place
For the chance to behold your face
As the days of my life are but grains of sand
As they fall from your open hand
At the call of the wind's command
Many words are spoken when there's nothing to say
The fall upon the ears of those who don't know the way
To read between the lines that lead between the lines that lead me to you
All that I ask you
Is show me how to follow you and I'll obey
Teach me how to reach you I can't find my own way
Let me see the light let me be the light
As the sun turns slowly around the sky
Till the shadow of night is high
The eagle will learn to fly
As the days of his life are but grains of sand
As they fall from your open hand
And vanish upon the land
Many words are spoken when there's nothing to say
The fall upon the ears of those who don't know the way
To read between the lines that lead between the lines that lead me to you
Show me how to follow you and I'll obey
Teach me how to reach you I can't find my own way
Let me see the light let me be the light
And so with no warning no last goodbye
In the dawn of the morning sky
The eagle will rise again <start> I believe I'm in a bad mood girl
And I hope it won't last too long
Last time I had a bad mood girl
Everything turned out wrong
I'm living in a bad mood world
The heart's bleeding don't it make you cry
Are you listening to the sad news girl
It's about another mixedup messedup guy
He's goin' through a bad dream girl
He's sleepin' with his eyes open wide
He's livin' in a bad mood world
He's livin' and he don't know why
Sometimes I don't know what to do
I just wish I could fly yeah
I can't give it up 'till I had enough
I wanna see the truth in your eyes
Sometimes I'm tired of livin'
I can't give it up before I live it up
Fall in love for the rest of my life
Sometimes I'm tired of livin'
Sure as hell ain't ready to die
You give my heart such a hard time inside
Like a passenger on a rollercoaster ride
Through the cold moonlight
Just show me where the good time's rolling
Lemme eat a slice of that pie
Show me where they go out moonbeaming
And I shoot 'em all from the sky <start> I've been restless on the inside
Wondering about this heart of mine
I've been desperately trying to find
A way to prove that I'm still alive
Has the love I speak so loudly of quietly grown cold
Has my life been an empty voice
What I say needs to be seen
I need to step out and make the choice
To let go of everything
Would You reignite this heart spark here in the dark
Bring Your love to life inside of me
Why don't You break my heart 'til it moves my hands and feet
For the hopeless and the broken
For the ones that don't know that You love them
Bring Your love to life inside of me
A generation You're calling out
Living everything that we sing about
A revelation right here and now
Of love beyond a shadow of a doubt
Love that's greater than our own
Won't remain unknown when You
Bring Your love to life inside of me
Why don't You break my heart 'til it moves my hands and feet
For the hopeless and the broken
For the ones that don't know that You love them
Bring Your love to life inside of me
Love come to life
Love come to life
Bring love to life inside of me
Love come to life
Love come to life
Bring love to life inside of me
Love come to life
Love come to life
Bring love to life inside of me
Love come to life
Love come to life
Bring love to life inside of me
Bring Your love to life inside of me
Why don't You break my heart 'til it moves my hands and feet
For the hopeless and the broken
For the ones that don't know that You love them
Bring Your love to life inside of me
Love come to life
Love come to life
Bring love to life inside of me
Love come to life
Love come to life
Bring love to life inside of me
Love come to life
Love come to life
Bring love to life inside of me
Love come to life
Love come to life
Bring love to life inside of me <start> She looks smiley
He looks friendly
You maybe nice
Don't know who I am
She is talkative
He is whiner
You are innocent
Don't know how I am
She keeps talking
He keeps begging
You are stainless
But I keep driving
Though I know you're the one who would end this rain
You make me feel like changing
That only makes me annoyed
Cause Grab it steal it beat them down
That's all I've learned
You are innocent
You are stainless
You're my best friend so I'll tell you this
You're an angel
Let me feel good
Let me feel I am still alive
I have learned my instinct is hiding background
Though no one knows
But I keep denying
Cause the world is lonesome enough to me
and the world is crazy enough to me
It keeps turning 'round and 'round and leaves me behind
I say the world is lonesome enough
I say the world is lonesome enough
When I've got a feeling that I am behind
I blame myself to have expected
The way you see it through your eyes could be different slight
Cause the world is lonesome enough to me
and the world is crazy enough to me
It keeps turning 'round and 'round and leaves me behind
I say the world is lonesome enough
I say the world is lonesome enough
You make me feel like changing
That only makes me annoyed
Cause Grab it steal it beat them down
That's all I've learned
the world is lonesome enough to me
and the world is crazy enough to me
It keeps turning 'round and 'round and leaves me behind
I say the world is lonesome enough

It keeps turning 'round and 'round and leaves me behind
I say the world is lonesome enough
I say the world is lonesome enough <start> Junior's eyes looked up to the skies in tears
He prayed that his maker the giver and taker would 'pear
Junior sighed as his hands reached out to the sky
Junior cried the day that his best friend died
Yeah
They're coming home again tomorrow
I'm sorry it won't be for long
With all the pain I've watched you live within
I'll try my hardest not to cry
When it is time to say goodbye
Junior's eyes they couldn't disguise the pain
His father was leaving and Junior's grieving again
Innocent eyes watched the man who had gave everything
Junior's sorrow who knew what tomorrow would bring
Yeah
They're coming home again tomorrow
I'm sorry it won't be for long
With all the pain I've watched you live within
I'll try my hardest not to cry
When it is time to say goodbye
Junior's eyes looked into the skies once more
Now he knew well this life was hell for sure
He desperately tried his fingertips stretched to the stars yeah
Reaching for reason along with the time and the stars
Yeah
They're coming home again tomorrow
I'm sorry it won't be for long
With all the pain I've watched you live within
I'll try my hardest not to cry
When it is time to say goodbye <start> Your god fucked me up the ass
Jesus Christ sucked my fucking ass
Your bible is such a piece of trash
I am the highest power the leader of the pack
Hail Mary is so full of shit
Virgin Mary I'll rape that fucking clit
Jesus Christ was the son of a bitch
I am the highest power the leader of the pack
Your church let's burn it to the ground
Priests and nuns let's put them in the ground
We don't need those lames to hold us back
I am the highest power the leader of the pack <start> It's  to nothing and I'm at the intersection
Waiting for the light that's green
Waiting for a reason
Take them all and stack them up
Not in my collection
Hit them all and watch them fly
Fuck them all and watch them drown
What is with these bands that keep comin' with their politics
They never went to school to find out
That they were full of shit
I didn't really either
But fuck I guess it really doesn't matter
You took this time to listen to me
So I'll say hey I fucked your brother
There's one problem
I got brownies
From your mother
They gave me syphilis
Now I got no dick
There's one problem
I got brownies
From your mother
They gave me syphilis
Now I got no dick fucker <start> These are the days we throw away
The words we never say
That I'm so fragile and so wrong
And we're still knockin' on the door
Of a world that's gone before
Until the real thing comes along
Kiss the day on it's way
And the sun will never shine
In your eyes like the skies
And the darkness will arise
Kiss the day and await
It holds you in it's arms
And the light will never fade
Kiss the day
And now I've seen enough to know
Though the truth can leave you cold
It can always lead you home
Back to the place where we belong
To the time when we were strong
When we could blow away the storm
Kiss the day on it's way
And the sun will never shine
In your eyes like the skies
And the darkness will arise
Kiss the day and await
It holds you in it's arms
And the light will never fade
Kiss the day kiss the day
These are the days we throw away
The words we never say
Till the real thing comes along
Kiss the day on it's way
And the sun will never shine
In your eyes like the skies
And the darkness will arise
Kiss the day and await
It holds you in it's arms
And the light will never fade
Kiss the day <start> Poor old granddad I laughed at all his words
I thought he was a bitter man
He spoke of women's ways
He said they'll trap you and they'll use you and before you even know
For love is blind and you're far too kind
Boy don't ever let it show
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger
The cancan such a pretty show
It will steal your heart away
But backstage back on earth again
All them dressing rooms are grey
They come on strong and it ain't too long
For they make you feel a man
But love is blind and you soon will find yeah
You're just a boy again
He said I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger
When you want her lips you get her cheek
Makes you wonder where you are
And if you want some more then she's fast asleep
Leaves you twinkling with the stars
I say poor young grandson there's nothing I can say
You'll have to learn it just like me
And that's the hardest way ooh la la
Yeah ooh la la
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh ooh la la
Everybody sing
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger
I said I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger
Hey I said ooh la la ooh la la yeah yeah
Ooh la la oh ooh la la la la la la
Say ooh la la
Oh ooh la la la la la la la la la
Oh ooh la la
I said ooh la la
Everybody sing
I said I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger
Ooh la la <start> Remember the world
Living in the half
That you cannot see
Been walking a line
The thinning tide
And stepping in too deep
Watching water thread my sleeve
What did I pull from underneath
We'll tie it down
Wait it out
Hope our memories hold
A leadwhite nail
Driven down
A hundred years ago
Feeling wheels on my old road
Feeling bought for what I sold
I had a dream you were two towns from me
Got to sleep spent the whole night running
Diving gulls
Wet their breath
And live in between
Hollow bones
Knowing both
What they want and what they need
How I want that mystery
Let me dive 'til I believe
I had a dream you were two towns from me
Got to sleep spent the whole night whole night <start> When I was very young
My daddy took me on his knees
Son there some things I wanna learn you
Before you get away from me
Don't let nobody boss you much
And keep your money clean
Treat a woman like lady
And your lady like a queen
But I didn't know what he was talking about
I didn't know what he was trying to say
'Til I got out in this mean old world
And you can turn my head around the other way
When I was 
A lady picked me up from off of the Street
She put a new suit on by back
And new boots on my feet
Said Thank you kind lady
What do you want in return
She said Young man put yourself in my hands
And youre damn sure gonna learn
But I didn't know what she was talking about
I didn't know what she was trying to say
'Til she took me in the bathroom
And she turned my head around the other way
Right along about this time
The Incomprehensible
It was about the time that I turn 
I thought that I was bad
Then I cussed out this old man
Down here in the beer joint late one night
He said Son if you wanna talk you talk
But if you wanna fight lets fight
But I didn't know what he was talking about
I didn't know what he was trying to say
'Til he took me out in the parking lot
And he turned my head around the other way
Til he took me out in the parking lot
He turned my head around the other way <start> Search and youll define
The sky between the lines
I could never tell truth from victim
Escapes a tired line
Knock knock somethings creeping
Laying down the land smear on the wicked
Now if youre ready to bleed
Turn your head turn your head
From the right follow me
Give chase to my shadows disarmed with a whisper
No gun in my hand whatever happened to honor brother
Fight me man to man look me in the eye
I got a family a feed
Will i learn from this what can you teach me
Its out of control the times are crazy
We dont care who sits on the throne
Doesnt matter to most of us
Just dont mess with the status quo
Lies paint my picture everyday
Every stones been thrown
Lay siege to my kingdom
My covers blown your blind dealing with death
Every dollar a headstone
Where the rich get richer
The poor just multiply
Thats smart divide and conquer
I keep em entertained while you steal their hard earned mule
Was there ever a time we dreamed for something better
Right now sounds real good
But your telling me to wait for fairer weather
Let it rain fire from the sky heaven help us 
Only the strong should survive
With permission i make this my personal mission
Save me from the fire
Yes sir yes maam i get the picture
We educate the masses
Whos gonna be cooking our dinners
Such a waste of time
Thinking we have to raise our own sons and daughters
When you can pay below the minimum
Shoot that man may i follow up that order
But all this talk dont come cheap
We all know what has to be done
Our very own personal revolution
Revolution revolution revolution
Revolution revolution revolution
Revolution revolution revolution
Let it rain fire from the sky heaven help us 
Only the strong should survive
With permission i make this my personal mission
Save me from the fire
Now here you come walking into my part of town
Telling people you have such a solution
Quick fix you got a story
Boy meets girl  stop they have kids
Poppa works while ma raises the ten babies
Shes praying every night that theyll one day hit the jackpot
 lucky numbers win the lottery a million gets me out of this hole
But when the well dries up oh where do i go
Little pablo doesnt even know how to read or write
Im starving sweet ana so i can get a good price for her
 down  to go oh wait hes got good skin tone got nice smile
An accent but kinda smells though
So where do you think youre going talking that kind of talk
That doesnt happen not on my watch no that doesnt happen
I ask you all to bear witness to the rape of these young souls
Lets give em a fighting chance and see where this all goes
I ask you all to bear witness to the rape of these young souls
If i dont do nothing lets see where this all goes
I ask you all to bear witness to the rape of these young souls
They got front row seats dont tell me they know
I ask you all to bear witness to the rape of these young souls
They dont need you donation what about education
I ask you all to bear witness to the rape of these young souls
No amount of praying gonna change their woes
Let it rain fire from the sky heaven help us 
Only the strong should survive
With permission i make this my personal mission
Save me from the fire <start> F nenhuma

lmacielrol.com.br <start> we know the place you're at
it's not where you want to be
it's out of our hands
maybe time will heal all wounds
moving forward showing no emotion
this is my time to reflect
on you beautiful people
and i can remember all the minutes we shared
overwhelmed by joy
it's all over now
and i'm on my way back home
maybe this summer
we can get together <start> Now here's a book full of photographs
That my ancestors made some generations ago
They're wearing the lastest clothes in a nautical way
The Suez Canal close behind is frozen in time
The deck crews star out of a mime
And they seem to be considering me
Here on my Egyptian couch
O the life on Edwardian steamships
Is measured and slow while down below
There are fires that shudder and clang and thunder
And sweatcaked in smoke and cauldrons to stoke
To send the ship on her way
Tasting the salt and the spray
And a century later I scan the equator
From my Egyptian couch
And the news every day brings
Contains the strangest of things
But with confident smilesw my forebears decline
To gaze into the wings
So they look from the photographs
And they're curious now wondering how we turned out
Let's say like the Chinese adage
We're living our lives in interesting times <start> Jesus is just a Spanish boy's name
How come one man got so much fame
And to enemy it's pointless to anybody
That doesn't have faith
Give me the cloth and I'll wipe my face
When it's all gone something carries on
And it's not morbid at all
Just when natures had enough of you
When my blood stops someone else's will not
When my head rolls off someone else's will turn
And while I'm alive I'll make tiny changes to earth
So you can burn me
Cause we'll all be the same the same way
Dirt in someone's eyes cried down the drain
I believe in a house in the clouds
And God's got His dead friends 'round
He's painted all the walls red
To remind them they're all dead
And you know when it's all gone something carries on
And it's not morbid at all
Just when nature's had enough of you
When my blood stops someone else's will not
When my head rolls off someone else's will turn
You can mark my words I'll make changes to earth <start> You lean forward to go
You pull back to go slow
These are the horse basics
You should know
There's no use to wait
A girl and her horse will never separate
You were done before
The gun at the starting gate
And away she rides
To the great unknown
You can wave goodbye
And spend some time on your own
And wonder why
Sometimes you find you fall far behind
On the course
Some things are best left
Between a girl and her horse
With no words to say
A girl and her horse can communicate
Cause motion is motion
And nothing's up for to debate
And away she rides
To the great beyond
You can wave goodbye
To a girl and her horse with a bond
You can't deny
Sometimes you find
You fall far behind on the course
Some things are best left
Between a girl and her horse
Sometimes you find
You can't cross the line on the course
Some things are best left
Between a girl and her horse
You lean forward to go
You pull back to go slow
The rest is anyone's guess
Don't you know
And away she rides
With the best in show
You can wave goodbye
A girl and her horse
Have a bond you'll never know
And away she rides
WIth the best in show you know
Unicorns don't exist of course
But every girl in this world has a horse
Sometimes you find
You fall far behind on the course
Some things are best left
Between a girl and her horse
Sometimes you find you can't cross
The line on the course
Some things are best left
Between a girl and her horse <start> The bell just toned my baby done caught that train and gone
Yes the bell just toned my baby done caught that train and gone
It's all my fault I must have done somebody wrong oh yeah
Everything that happened you know I am to blame
Everything that's happened you know I am to blame
I'm gonna find me a doctor maybe my luck will change oh yeah
My mother told me these days would surely come
But I wouldn't listen to her said I gotta have some fun
Aah I musta did somebody wrong
Uuh it's all my fault I musta did somebody wrong <start> Tomorrow I'll be nine
And everything will be the same
Tomorrow I'll be nine
It's only gonna be another day
They're always looking at me funny
I'm always doing something wrong
I'm thinkin' they'd be better off if I was gone
Tomorrow I'll be nine
And everything will be the same
Tomorrow I'll be nine
It's only gonna be another day
They never tell me what they're thinking
They're always busy being mad
I start to thinkin' could it be 'cause I am bad
Oh I'll go where I can't hear them
Oh I'll go away
There's got to be someone who wants me
There's got to be someone who cares
Don't know where they are but I am going there
Tomorrow I'll be nine
And everything will be the same
Tomorrow I'll be nine
I think it's time I make my get away
Tomorrow I'll be nine
Tomorrow I'll be nine <start> Attempt the keyhole how
I don't    for free
All to stop moving now
You taught it all to me
But I can never walk out
I can never walk out
I'm getting down
I'm going out
I have a date with a pretty ballerina
I had a date with a pretty ballerina
How do I get into bed to sleep with you
Crushed cause I tripped the alarms
I'm going sugarless
Down enough to a crawl to be primitive
Out of my head on the prowl
I'm going sugarless
Kasabi courdarouy
How can you refuse
Pissed out on engine noise
Telepathic blues
You know I never lose
Never ever lose
I'm getting down
I'm going out
I have a date with a pretty ballerina
How do I get into bed to sleep with you
Crushed cause I tripped the alarms
I'm going sugarless
Down enough to a crawl to be primitive
Out of my head on the prowl
I'm going sugarless
I had a date with a pretty ballerina
I had a date with a pretty ballerina <start> I remember it like it was yesterday
Snow in the park and skaters on the ice
Long black cars standing sidebyside
Loading up the boys at night
Turned up our collars to the chill of the wind
Caught an innocent smile from a taxi at the lights
Not something you'd see on a New York street
It's such an uncommon sight
Chorus
But I wouldn't have it any other way
This city's got a thing about it don't try to understand it
New York City I'd really like to stay
New York City I wouldn't have you
I wouldn't have you any other way
Oh the subway rumbled underneath
Italian lights where Joey Gallo died
And the man on the door down at 's
Letting only the pretty inside
I'd wake with a stranger under the covers
Late in the day and longing for the night
Just like the snowfall there's so many bodies
But somehow it feels so right
Chorus <start> This is mankind and mankind kills
You think that women are just here for thrills
Your filthy morals just fucking stink
Don't try and get my hands in your sink
Don't call me your bird I'm not your pet
Well I've had enough right up to my neck
This is mankind and mankind kills
Why should women be raped at your will
This is mankind and mankind kills
Why should women pay for man's thrills
Why don't you get married
Wear that wedding ring
Can't she see it's the only respectable thing
She'll cook his meals
Sleep in his bed
Do anything he says <start> Each time that I hold you your eyes fill with fear
You can't lose control now the price is too dear
But love I have heard you crying in the dark
And the tears on your pillow came bleeding weeping from your heart.
Oh sinner you're losing all that you had
Your day is in peaces your night has gone mad
And love cannot touch you the search has no end
And the one you've forgotten was really your only friend
Then your soul flies to Heaven
You reach out for me
But the door will not open
You've thrown away the key
No the door will not open
You've thrown away the key
Oh stranger beware the life that you lead
Is filled with the warnings you can or will not read
Your castle has fallen it lies in the sand
I heard your voice calling I thought I felt the brush of your hand
Oh gambler remember the love that you lend
Will never come back for the game has no ending
The smiler is calling you turn for the deal
And the aces keep falling with every spin of the wheel
Then you gather your winnings
You're ready to leave
But the door will not open
You've thrown away the key
Oh there's no point in staying
So don't wait to see
For the door will not open
You've thrown away the key <start> Every night I go down town
Take a walk around
Every soulful sound
Reminds me of you
And all the shit you do
You are the mood that I'm in
Every afternoon I try
Don't have to wonder why I
Kiss on some other guy
I just can't help missing you
And all that shit you do
You are the mood that I'm in
All I wanna do is cook your bread
I just wanna make sure you're well fed
I would rather die one hundred ways
Go blind than watch you walk away
Come on home
You are the mood that I'm in
Started smoking cigarettes
One hundred sixty sticks
All my love is sick
Don't wanna hear where you been conversations
You are the mood that I'm in
All I wanna do is cook your bread
I just wanna make sure you're well fed
I would rather die one hundred ways
Go blind than watch you walk away
Come on home
You are the mood that I'm in
Those wicked eyes they captify straight through my dress
Don't be so shy while I am swimming in your hands
I can taste your sweat
'Cause all I wanna do is cook your bread
I just wanna make sure you're well fed
I would rather die one hundred ways
Go blind than watch you walk away
Come on home
You are the mood that I'm in
Come on home
You are the mood that I'm in <start> Now I'm in love with the Texas Chain Saw Massacre
I'm in love with the wolfman and his pal Dracula.
There's horror all about me horror everywhere
I love it when those vampire bats get tangled in my hair.
Your not safe you won't escape my horror story.
Feel a chill then it's you I kill in my horror story.
Shivers down your spine shivers down your spine
shivers down your spine all of the time.
Shivers down your spine shivers down your spine
turns your blood to wine.
Now I live in a big house the one on haunted hill
and I knew Dr Jekyll before he got ill.
I went to school with Mummy and the Hunchback of Notre Dame
Frankenstein was often seen there unlike the invivisible man.
At the local gig on Friday the zombies all would dance
and eat the eyes of the DJ who put them in a trance.
The man in the iron mask was shooting pool up top
said Don't get up to Duran Duran get down to the Bellend Bop. <start> Cherub
Cherub the angel
Roll back the hands of time
Cherub
Enter the angel
aaaaaaahhhh
You walk alone now
You're never mind
The walks you've taken
have left behind
All people sideways
They look at you
may god forsake me
cause I do to
I see bodies
Maybe maybe someone is alive
Naked we smile
Hoohahahahahahahah ahahahahahohoho
Naked
Haha
ahhhh
You're right beside me
you gaze a view
your body's vacant
they crawl right through
those bodies falling
it's in the air
we're mixed so close now
but I don't care
ha ha ha
walk upon me
your body lead
you try to escape you
it's in your head
I'd better go back
I'm not over there
You walk beside me
you gaze at me
you're homeless now
or that times three
amazon
you gaze along
I'll make you talk you
there is no bong
your mind has cut you
you're bleeding now
your plans escaped
just like a bow
they walk right past you
they stop and stare
your body's lying
all over there
hahehehehe
feh <start> In the morning
In the evening
Anytime at all
I'll be ready baby when you call
In the darkness
I'll be waiting
With nothing but a smile
You got me crazy
I just want what's mine
I don't need another love song
You're the only thing that turns me on
Nobody loves me like you do
Nobody understands everything I am
Nobody else could ever take your place
You're all that I want
I'm in heaven now
Nobody loves me like you do
Don't be tired
Don't be late now
Don't forget your key
I'll be right where you should be
Don't you know you're taking too long
You're the only thing that turns me on
Nobody loves me like you do...
You got something that's so true
I need your loving like a heartbeat
You're my everything cause I believe
Nobody love me like you do... <start> Do you want to go
Straight to Hawaii
 Hawaii 
Straight to Hawaii 
Oh do  you want to come along with me

I heard about all the pretty girls
With their grass skirts down to their knees
All my life I wanted to see
The island called Hawaii
Go to Hawaii
 Hawaii 
Straight to Hawaii 
Oh do  you want to come along with me

Now I don't know what town you're from
But don't tell me that they got bigger waves
Cause everyone that goes
Comes back with nothing but raves
That's in Hawaii
 Hawaii 
That's in Hawaii 
Oh do  you want to come along with me

And pretty soon this winter
They'll hold the surfing championship of the year
Surfer guys and girls
Will be coming from far and near
Go to Hawaii
 Hawaii 
Go to Hawaii 
Oh do  you want to come along with me

And you now 
You want to live Hanah Lee

Ooo ooo ooo 
Ooo ooo ooo 
Ooo ooo ooo 
Ooo ooo ooo 
Ooo ooooo  <start> A thousand years from now on
The flame of life's gone out
The earth  a frozen wasteland
No living trace  no sounds
The world did die in anguish
The ashes turned to dust
Fire and ice  blackness of night
Man's evolution has lost
Don't tell me that we didn't know
And that we haven't been told
The final s.o.s. we all ignored
We've seen the writing on the wall
The writing on the wall
The science of the madman
Was getting out of control
For every creature comfort
There is a heavy toll
We turned on mother nature
Stabbed her deep in a back
We ripped out her lungs  poisoned her veins
Internal acid attack
Don't tell me that we didn't know
And that we never been told
The final s.o.s. we all ignored
We've seen the writing on the wall
The writing on the wall
Seen the writing on the wall
I'm just painting a picture
Of how it could be
But time's running out  the clock's ticking down
You're not blind  can't you see
Don't tell me that we still don't know
And that we're not being told
The final s.o.s. we shouldn't ignore
Just read the writing on the wall
The writing on the wall
Read the writing on the wall
The writing on the wall <start> Don't open the box
Take the money
Take it to the shops
Where we can spend it all honey
On 's memorabilia and rock n roll records
And experience the genius of Terrence and Leonard
Send them victorious
Happy and glorious
Long to reign over us
In the studio for us
My eyes hve seen the glory of
The legend and the story of
Feather cropped and blow dried hair
Clever clogs and Lionel Blairs
And I won't be watching TV any more
I'll poke my TV eyes out at the door
Nail my other records to the record shelf
Enlighten educate and entertain myself
Listening to the sound of Lenny and Terrence <start> Sitting as the noonday sun
Shines high up in a clear blue sky.
While warming me I drift away
No mem'ries of the times gone by.
Oh the moment that I lose my mind
You come into my heart and say
I'm always here for you to love
Surrender to me let me stay ay ay.
Oooo
Oooo du du du du du du du.
Sinking deeper still inside
I feel awakened from my dreams.
Resting in some golden flow
Becoming part of you it seems.
Nothing separates my life
From that which we have called our goal
It's all in this external world
As results from deep within my soulouloul.
Oooo
Oooo du du du du du du du.
Oooo du du du du du du du.
As I open up my eyes
The sky has changed into a glow.
My sense of time had disappeared
I see the sun has sunken low. <start> Give yourself a little competition I can see it flaring up in your eyes
Give yourself a moment to remember all the trailing loose ends you've left behind
And I keep on a wondering how all the walls around you have kept so high
Give yourself a little competition it's the only thing that will get you by
Keep the wound salted
Oooooooh Ooooooooh Oooooooh
It's what you've always wanted
Oooooooh Ooooooooh Oooooooh
Keep the wound salted
Oooooooh Ooooooooh Oooooooh
Suddenly you've lost communication and you swear that it's all her mistake
But you must really like this situation cause the clean break you wanted is now in your face
She looked at you then at the room then at the state she's been living in
And suddenly you're in a new position as the views you held so highly fade
Keep the wound salted
Oooooooh Ooooooooh Oooooooh
It's what you've always wanted
Oooooooh Ooooooooh Oooooooh
Keep the wound salted
Oooooooh Ooooooooh Oooooooh
Just say goodbye don't look back...Whoa
Give us all a little more emotion we can see it welling up in your eyes
And we can see your fur is getting thicker as you show no signs of compromise
But don't go running back when you realize that nobody's buying into your lies
Then give yourself a little more opinion cause we know you'll never choose to rectify
Keep the wound salted
Oooooooh Ooooooooh Oooooooh
It's what you've always wanted
Oooooooh Ooooooooh Oooooooh
Keep the wound salted
Oooooooh Ooooooooh Oooooooh
Just say goodbye don't look back <start> Well we walk hand in hand till life does us part
Me and the world my scum sweetheart
We met a long ago with a flirt and a stare
Together ever since a lethal love affair
I tried to get out to get up and go
I was afraid of the fall the vertigo
You made me suffer guilt was your game
You had control of what I became
A rotten romance if I'd stayed I'd die
It was a fond farewell when I said goodbye
Now I'm free on solid ground
No more of you pushing me around
You're my scum sweetheart
You're the world you broke my heart
You're my scum sweetheart
You're the world you broke my heart
Oh yeah
You broke my heart
You're the world full of lies
How could I think of compromise
It seems to me a solitaire affair
I was in need but you didn't care
Please stay away heart breaker
You're not gonna be my soul taker
I've got friends that want to see you
They'd stay away if they had a clue
You're my scum sweetheart
You're the world you broke my heart
You're my scum sweetheart
You're the world you broke my heart
You broke my heart
You took my heart
Come be my soul taker
It's a black heart that I see
It's evil it's bad and all in between
Whatever it is I'll do my part
To keep you from being their scum sweetheart
You're my scum sweetheart
You're the world you broke my heart
You're my scum sweetheart
You're the world you broke my heart
You're my scum sweetheart
You're the world you broke my heart
You're my scum sweetheart
You're the world you broke my heart
You're my scum sweetheart
You're the world you're the world
You broke my heart <start> Sitting in a graveyard
Waiting for the dawn
Leaning on my tombstone
Till the night is gone
Chorus
Oh how the moon
Hangs in black sky
Wish I could find out
The reason why
I sit here alone
And cry
My woman was so lovely
Together we were one
No sunshine in my weary eyes
Now that she has gone
Chorus
Palm trees whisper to me
From your spreading height
Tell me all the lonely stories
Of the world at night
Chorus <start> Cheena so sound so titty up this Malchick say
Party up mood naddy vellocet round on Tuesday
Real bad dizzy snatch making all the homies mad Thursday
Popo blind to the polly in the hole by Friday
Where the fuck did Monday go

Who the fuck's gonna mess with me
Girl loves me
Hey cheena

And I believe in you beautiful woman
And you are like a breath of spring
Warm like the summer rain beautiful woman
Every breath I take
Every move that I make
I'm reaching out

Just to get a little closer
Just a little bit closer
Move a little closer baby
Closer closer
You you are my dream come true
And I believe in you beautiful woman
Every breath I take
Every move I make
I'm reaching out

Just to get a little closer
Just a little bit closer
Move a little closer baby
Closer closer to you
You are my dream come true
And I believe in you beautiful woman
And you are like a breath of spring
Warm like summer rain beautiful woman <start> Lightning's flashing all around me
Thunder's rolling up behind.
Big blue clouds are going to roll in
Full of tears and make me blind.
I can't let her man recatch me.
I can't stop to cry no more.
I'm just running down the highway
One jump ahead of the storm.
One jump ahead of her crying
One jump ahead of her cold cheating arm.
One jump ahead of her lying
One jump ahead of the storm.
One day I looked on the horizon
Saw her love just couldn't last.
Oh my mind was torn to pieces.
I had to leave and get out fast.
And so I slipped out of her power.
I saw my chance and I was gone
Before the rain could start to falling.
One jump ahead of the storm.
Chorus
I was one jump ahead of the storm.
Just one jump ahead of the storm.
I was one jump ahead of the storm.
Just one jump ahead of the storm.
I was one jump ahead of the storm.
Just one jump ahead of the storm.
I was one jump ahead of the storm.
Just one jump ahead of the storm. <start> er valt licht bij mij naar binnen
ze staat naast me met haar tas
alsof er iets open gaat iets wat er nog niet was
en dan denk ik nee dan weet ik
ook al is het nog maar klein
het staat in steen gehouwen ik moet nergens anders zijn
ze kijkt heel lang naar de wolken
en dan kijkt ze naar mij
alsof ze nu iets nieuws ziet alsof er iets aan haar verschijnt
en dan lacht ze  en dan straalt ze 
en niemand die is vrij
ik kan maar niet begrijpen hoe ze zo zichzelf kan zijn
dus open je ogen voor mij
loop je geluk niet voorbij.
er staat nooit iets in de sterren wat een mens niet goed verstaat
alsof elke vorm van uitleg het veel te moeilijk maakt
maar je voelt het en je ziet het
en je weet dat het zo is
je kunt niet meer begrijpen dat je nooit iets hebt gemist
dus open je ogen voor mij
loop je geluk niet voorbij.
open je ogen voor mij
loop je geluk niet voorbij
niets bijzonders heel eenvoudig
het gebeurd de hele tijd
als een donderslag bij heldere hemel
want vandaag gebeurd het mij
oooh
oooooooooooh oooooooooooh ooooooooooooh ooooooooooh
open je ogen voor mij
loop je geluk niet voorbij
open je ogen voor mij
loop je geluk niet voorbij <start> No explanation
No words describe
Serving sentence in your head
You murder time
Some waiting station
One endless night
Take the empty trains to nowhere
In your idle mind
And sometimes I feel like the last one on the planet
Only one your the only one
Sometimes I feel like the last one in the world
Only one your the only one
Don't get so near to me
Don't disappear on me
Here comes the morning
Venetian blind
I'll do the haunting
I'm killing time
It's dark on Broadway
It's kind of like
Walking down the lonely streets
In your idle mind
I'm the only one I'm the last one in the world
Only one you're the only one <start> They said the surface was suffocating
They said the distance wasn't worth the waiting.
They said the pressure could crush the spirit of a man
But none of them see the heavens from the place where I stand.
She is the brightest star that's in the sky
She is the reason every astronaut would fly.
I see the lighting clouds of white on Cobalt fields of blue
I close my eyes and sigh
I can't believe it's true.
Chorus
The moon is burning bright
I saw her face tonight
I touched the seamless beauty with my hands
I'm never going back again.
They said I'm foolish
fleeting hopes in borrowed dreams.
They said forget her
The moon is far beyond your reach.
I would run out of fuel long before I'd ever land
But none of them can see this world.
From the place where I stand. <start> I'll remember you
When I've forgotten all the rest
You to me were true
You to me were the best
When there is no more
You cut to the core
Quicker than anyone I knew
When I'm all alone
In the great unknown
I'll remember you.
I'll remember you
At the end of the trail
I had so much left to do
I had so little time to fail
There's some people that
You don't forget
Even though you've only seen 'em
One time or two
When the roses fade
And I'm in the shade
I'll remember you.
Didn't I didn't I try to love you
Didn't I didn't I try to care
Didn't I sleep didn't I weep beside you
With the rain blowing in your hair.
I'll remember you
When the wind blows through the piny wood
It was you who came right through
It was you who understood
Though I'd never say
That I done it the way
That you'd have liked me to
In the end
My dear sweet friend
I'll remember you. <start> What is it that turns you on to the illusion of power
This thing that grabs you by the heart and makes you want to tear things down.
There is no reason why I should need all this power but if you cross me now
I'm gonna tear your whole world down.
The illusion of power things I feel seem so real
The illusion of power.
I can' get the emotional thing straight in my head
Everything I love dies to soon or is already dead.
Don't stand too close I spit and breath fire
Anything I've got now you cannot desire.
You want to be my friend I promise you nothing
Nothing I can give you nothing I can do for you
I'm being chased by the sins of my past and it's killing me now
Killing me now.
The illusion of power things I feel seem so real
The illusion of power.
The illusion of power it's already set signed and sealed
The illusion of power.
Powerful who are you fooling
You're caught in a complex cataclysm of your own inadequacies
And pitiful weaknesses
Your souls secretes insecurity
So you live on the reflection side of the mirror
You're terrified of true power...you fear me...
I can tell you stories of my
Shaded past and I can
Drag you down into the
Depths of my soul.
The illusion of power things I feel seem so real
The illusion of power.
The illusion of power it's already set signed and sealed
The illusion of power.
Why don't you come closer Promise a story I will tell yeah
I'll save you from your dreams yeah
I'll save you from your dreams. <start> Way you look at me like that something's got to give pretty soon
Throw it on a camel's back something's got to give pretty soon
Living hard to chase the dream way beyond our ways and means
Yours don't mean a goddamn thing.
That's what you said but don't believe it.
That shattered look upon your face something's got to give pretty soon.
Swallow but can't stand the taste bark at the wind chase the moon
Living fast and drinking lots. List of things we haven't got.
Tired of life with the havenots
That's what you said and I believe it.
Maybe what you need's for someone to send you flowers
Someone strong and mean who can prove he has the power to
Show you more than charm and take you on your way
To where you want to be at the end of the day
And it breaks my heart in two to know it ain't meant to be
But it ain't me
It ain't me.
And you say it's these things I do about me that's attracted you
So if I started doing something else what would we have left.
And you say you just want compromise then act so different all the time.
These reasons why you said goodbye just another way of telling lies.
Something's got to give got to give pretty soon
Or else we're gonna lose the very things that made it bloom
Sitting in silence in a cold and lonely room
While the world goes on around us
Something's got to give got to give pretty soon
Or else we're gonna hate each other
And that would be the saddest thing I ever seen. <start> Are we growing up or just going down
It's just a matter of time until we're all found out
Take our tears put 'em on ice
'Cause I swear I'd burn this city down to show you the light
We're the therapists pumping through your speakers
Delivering just what you need
We're wellread and poised
We're the best boys
We're the chemists who found the formula
To make your heart
Swell and burst
No matter what they say don't believe a word
'Cause I'll keep singing this lie
If you keep believing it
I'll keep singing this lie
I'll keep singing this lie
Are we growing up or just going down
It's just a matter of time until we're all found out
Take our tears put 'em on ice
'Cause I swear I'd burn this city down to show you the light
We travel like gypsies only
With worse luck and far less gold
We're the kids you used to love
But then we grew old
We're the lifers here 'til the bitter end
Condemned from the start
Ashamed of the way the songs and the words
Own the beating of our hearts
'Cause I'll keep singing this lie
I'll keep singing this lie
Are we growing up or just going down
It's just a matter of time until we're all found out
Take our tears put 'em on ice
'Cause I swear I'd burn this city down to show you the light
And there's a drug in the thermostat to warm the room up
And there's another around to have us bend your trust
Got a sunset in my veins
And I need to take a pill to make this town feel okay
The best part of Believe is the lie
I hope you sing along and you steal a line
I need to keep you like this in my mind
So give in our just give up
The best part of Believe is the lie
I hope you sing along and you steal a line
I need to keep you like this in my mind
So give in our just give up
Are we growing up or just going down
Are we growing up or just going down
It's just a matter of time until we're all found out
Take our tears put 'em on ice
'Cause I swear I'd burn this city down to show you the light <start> She sits alone and wonders
When is the end of broken dreams
This isn't what I pictured
She says as tears run down her cheeks
She needs a friend beside her
She's looking for a savior
Hold on hold on
Someone will find you
Hold on hold on
Somebody loves you
She grabs her coat to leave
So sure it's gonna be the end
Another broken family
Tears are her only friends
This isn't the life they wanted
She's hoping that heaven comes through
Hold on hold on
Someone will find you
Hold on hold on
Somebody loves you
Yeah hold on hold on
You're not drowning this time
Hold on hold on
Look for the search lights
Does anybody care Do you even see
Look past my skin do you see me
Do you even know what I'm going through
I need to talk to someone can I talk to you
Does anybody care Does anybody care
Does anybody care Oh
Hold on hold on
Someone will find you
Hold on hold on
Somebody loves you yeah
Hold on hold on
You're not drowning this time
Hold on hold on
Look for the search lights
Hold on hold on
Hold on hold on
Hold on hold on <start> I don't know
What I'm feeling
Can't you see
What's going on
I am Gene
I'm a genius
But something happened
The human touch
Tries to corrupt
My way too much
I am a bit confused
United units start
A rivalry of bites
My human system fights
My mission clear defined
I'm at the end of the line
I'm a Gene  genius
Built to protect the world
From death and pain
But my mission was erased
I'm Gene Genius
I lost my sense of duty
For us all
What a vision I'm amazed
I still try
Can you hear me
Mankind just
Doesn't realize
I am Gene
I'm a genius
But something happened
The human touch
Tries to corrupt
My way too much
I'm here to fight the fight
Control the human might
The universal quest
There is no time to rest
The mission would be fine
I'm at the end of the line
I'm a Gene  genius
Built to protect the world
From death and pain
But my mission was erased
I'm Gene Genius
I lost my sense of duty
For us all
What a vision I'm amazed
I'm a Gene Genius
I didn't reach the height
Of my intent
It's my passion to replace
The feelings in my veins <start> You've got me poppin' champagne I'm at it again
Caught up in the moment but not in the right way
I'm falling in between tearing up at the seams
We're just aiming to please and aesthetics don't hurt one bit
So follow me down take this all the way
Any way you want to
Why don't you say so I think I'm caught in between
The nights and days fly by when I'm lost on the streets
And my eyes they despise you for who I am
Why don't you say so Why don't you say so
You've got me thinking that lately I've been wishing
The television set would show me more
Than just a picture of the things I've grown to detest
I strip down my dignity they can take all of me
But they won't ever take what I still believe
So follow me down take this all the way
Any way you want to
Why don't you say so I think I'm caught in between
The nights and days fly by when I'm lost on the streets
And my eyes they despise you for who I am
Why don't you say so Why don't you say so
Give up and let go I'm just a boy with a dream
And you can take one look as I fall in between
With my eyes just as wide as my mouth can be
Why don't you say so Why don't you say so
I know I know I know
That there's a place for me somewhere out there
I know I know I know
That there's a place for me somewhere out there
Why don't you say so I think I'm caught in between
The nights and days fly by when I'm lost on the streets
My eyes they despise you for who I am
Why don't you say so Why don't you say so
Give up and let go I'm just a boy with a dream
And you can take one look as I fall in between
With my eyes just as wide as my mouth can be
Why don't you say so Why don't you say so
Why don't you say so Why don't you say so
Why don't you say so Why don't you say so
Why don't you say so Why don't you say so
Why don't you say so Why don't you say so <start> Hey Sylvan what's to say
It feels so strange
To sing your name this way
I'm a loss for words
Still looking for the one
Still searching on the tip of my tongue
Hey Sylvan do you recall
The summer we spent moving bricks
And building cement walls
Through every nickname
Everyone would call
You laughed along and smiled at them all
On your day everybody came
You were there in a wooden picture frame
Reminded me of a wedding we went to
Where you cried for the bride and now she's here to cry for you
Chorus
I guess we all fall in and fall out
Every good story has to end somehow
Here's your standing o oh on your last bow
You left the stage on fire and we'll never put it out
Never put it out....
Hey Sylvan where'd you go
Yeah I know you were always leaving early
From the parties we would throw
We'd chase you down before you were gone
Now I wish I knew the street that you're on.
I would say that you never went away
You're in the ground but you're not living in a grave
I look around and I see what you gave
All the proof of the life you engraved
Chorus
I guess we all fall in and fall out
Every good story has to end somehow
Here's your standing o oh on your last bow
You left the stage on fire and we'll never put it out
Never put it out....
never put it
never put it out
never put it
never put it out <start> I should've seen it comin' should've seen the signs
Seems that there's a break in our communication lines
You haven't heard me talkin' for a long long time
I guess you're in a new dimension but I'm still in mine
Look out 'cause I'm a bull in a china shop
What's it gonna take to finally breakthrough
Somethin' about this that makes it all new
I'm prepared to do all that I have to
Anything it takes to finally breakthrough
I got a sinking feeling that I can't relay
Remembering a conversation on a distant day
Visions of teardrops falling as you turn away
I may be flesh and bone but my feet are clay
Look out 'cause I'm a bull in a china shop
Ghosts form my past cling to my back
I should've seen it comin' should've seen the signs
Sensing a swelling shiver shooting up my spine <start> The snow is snowing and the wind is blowing
But I can weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
For I've got my love to keep me warm
I can't remember a worse December
Just watch those icicles form
Oh what do I care if icicles form
Oh I've got my love to keep me warm
Off with my overcoat off with my glove
I need no overcoat I'm burning with love
My heart's on fire the flame grows higher
So I will weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
Oh I've got my love to keep me warm
The snow is snowing the wind is blowing
But I can weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
Oh I've got my love to keep me warm
I can't remember a worse December
Just watch those icicles form
What do I care if icicles form
Ohhoho I've got my love to keep me warm
Off with my overcoat off with my glove
I need no overcoat I'm burning with love
My heart's on fire the flame grows higher
So I will weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
Oh I've got my love to keep me warm <start> Words don't come easy to me
How can I find a way to make you see I love you
Words don't come easy
Words don't come easy to me
This is the only way for me to say I love you
Words don't come easy
Well I'm just a music man
Melodies are so far my best friend
But my words are coming out wrong
Girl I reveal my heart to you and
Hope that you believe it's true 'cause
Words don't come easy to me
How can I find a way to make you see I love you
Words don't come easy
This is just a simple song
That I've made for you on my own
There's no hidden meaning you know when I
When I say I love you honey
Please believe I really do 'cause
Words don't come easy to me
How can I find a way to make you see I love you
Words don't come easy
It isn't easy words don't come easy
Words don't come easy to me
How can I find a way to make you see I love you
Words don't come easy
Don't come easy to me
This is the only way for me to say I love you
Words don't come easy
Words don't come easy <start>

bleeding fortified wine out of the injury that i call my mouth
trying to insult some crazy fucker
from the south whose arrow comes to pick me out
and so I'm waiting for a shot of white noise
don't wanna hear no stupid screaming little halfassed
middleclass boy because I've got a headache and I'm already full of useless stories
arrow come on pick me out
because I've got a headache and I'm already full of these useless stories
arrow come on pick me out
arrow come on pick me out
a broken arrow <start> If you take the tears from crying eyes
Will the hurt just disappear
Put a weapon in the hand of a frightened man
Will he show no fear
So we stand and we watch while the city lights go out one by one
Mother Nature sits on the other side with a loaded gun
Why is there blue sky
Why is there red sky
Now's the time to ask the reason
Should the blue sky
Meet the red sky
Should the rules have to change at all
We all know whatever they say
Time is on our side
This world has been here before just going round and round and round
We all agree as far as we can see
It's just the way of the world
That's how it's meant to be
There's right and there's wrong
There's weak and there's strong
It's just the way of the world
And that's how it's meant to be
Take the motion from a spinning wheel and watch it stop
Take the danger out of a naked flame and what have you got
If you take the anger out of a broken heart you feel no pain
Could you swear if you had that second chance you wouldn't do it again
Why is there blue sky
Why is there red sky
Now's the time to ask the reason
Should the blue sky
Meet the red sky
Should the rules have to change at all
We all know whatever they say
Time is on our side
This world has been here before just going round and round and round
We all agree as far as we can see
It's just the way of the world
That's how it's meant to be
There's right and there's wrong
There's weak and there's strong
It's just the way of the world
And that's how it's meant to be <start> Closed society the avant guarded name the password
Tight lips
Broken spirit locked behind a painful stone cold chest
Reach into the valley of the shadow of success
Over the cold shoulder I can't breathe deep or roll away the stone
Sweet Jesus my relief
From tongues lashing blind eyes flashing trash can smiles
Limited words of infinite smallness
Peering back from the unknown
Mindless mayhem
To the victor go the spoils
As long as that can stand on dead man's bones
Screaming from the devil's pulpit
Intellectual incest incestual intellect
Open minds open mines
Like a lump in the throat...incomplete.
I'm coughing up my youth
I've got the buzz on you. <start> I've got every reason on earth to be mad
'Cause I just lost the only girl I had
If I could get my way
I'd get myself locked up today
But I can't so I'll cry instead
I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger that my feet
I can't talk to people that I meet
If I could see you now
I'd try to make you sad somehow
But I can't so I'll cry instead
Don't want to cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away
But I'll come back again someday
And when you do you'd better hide all the girls
I'm gonna break their hearts all round the world
Yes I'm gonna break them in two
And show you what your lovin' man can do
Until then I'll cry instead <start> Through the eyes of a child
There's no wrong or right
No reason to hate
No need for a fight
No color no creed
No malice no greed
Till the child becomes a man
Give up your freedom
Hand back your rights
Then change your color now
You're black not white
And there'll never be a piece of the action
Now you're an African
Forget beliefs and swallow your pain
You're just a number now
And Boy's your name
And you'll never get a piece of the action
Now you're a working man
African Asian it's all the same
Brown black Caucasian
It's all the same
Slave labor working class
What's in a name
Far left far right center
It's power they crave
The politics of Apartheid
The politics of shame
The cold abuse of human rights
Of torture and of pain
Are only part of the action
When you're an African
The politics of making more
The politics of greed
The cold abuse of poverty
To keep your labor cheap
Are only part of the action
When you're a working man
African Asian it's all the same
Brown black Caucasian
It's all the same
Slave labor working class
What's in a name
Far left far right center
Far left far right center
Far left far right center
It's power they crave
The politics of buying arms
When there's no food to eat
The politics of digging gold
Instead of planting seeds
The leader with his private golf course
And his flashy cars
Sits playing with his diamond wrist watch
While the people starve
The politics of shooting down
A plane that brings relief
By fat men playing power games
Who've got enough to eat
The politics of racial hate
The politics of war
The men who sell the guns have fun
While we all count the score
One two three four
Thousands millions
People dying just to keep
Them in the action
Through the eyes of a man
There's wrong and there's right
A reason to hate
There's need for a fight
There's color there's creed
There's malice there's greed
When the child becomes a man <start> When I woke up it seems
Like my world was caving in
I won't break down this time
I'll be fine
With dull dimension speaking of the truth
And howls of chaos the bleeding of the moon
Rounding up this time
I'll be fine
Let your love caress me
Like the tide embraces the sea
Let our soul connection
Bring me alive today
Am I lost and can be found
Heaven's locked hell not a sound
All my angels left and gone
It rains down
Turn the key enough for rescue
And burn the light
The light that burns through
But here it comes again
It rains down
Well live your life a little
Breathe in and out a little
I say a prayer for you
Let your love caress me
Like the tide embraces the sea
Let our soul connection
Bring me alive today <start> I was born yesterday  years ago
And there ain't no explanation
for this situation that I'm in
And I don't want to live forever
that's just the way it's always been
All of the children I've had in my life
I've watched them grow up and
grow old and then die
And my wives Oh how I've missed my wives
Why won't the angels come take me away
Chorus
Tears drip cause a quiver in your lip
When I remember the people that I've left behind
Tears drip cause a quiver in your lip
When I remember the reason that I'm still alive
I am ever human being
It's this curse It's this gift It's the blood
It's the blood And I am the chosen one
I am the chose one
Chorus
This can't go on forever 
This can't go on forever
Somebody take me away
Somebody take me away <start>

  <start> Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end
Always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
And I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on
Somebody that you used to know.
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Somebody
I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Somebody yeah yeah
Now you're just somebody that I used to know <start> Only came outside to watch the nightfall with the rain
I heard you making patterns rhyme like
Some new romantic looking for the TV sound
You'll see I'm right some other time look now
Look all around there's not sign of life
Voices another sound
Can you hear me now
This is Planet Earth you're looking at Planet Earth
Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop
This is Planet Earth
My head is stuck on something precious let me know
If you're coming down to land is there
Anybody out there trying to get through
My eyes are so cloudy I can't see you
Look now look all around there's no sign of
Life voices another sound
Can you hear me now
This is Planet Earth
You're looking at Planet Earth
Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop
This is Planet Earth
Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop
This calling Planet Earth
Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop
This looking at Planet Earth
Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop
This is Planet Earth <start> I keep on asking myself what went wrong
Why were we fighting for so long
Was the river of love running dry
Was a wicked storm passing by
Oh baby I wonder
If I die tonight
Would you die
Would you cry for me
If I die tonight
Would you shiver
Bleed and suffer for me
If I die tonight
Would it tingle
Oh would it even tickle you
If I die tonight if I die tonight
Would you would you
While you're sleeping on my broken heart
And silence drifts us wide apart
I dream chills growing all over me
But head under sand you can't see
So baby I wonder
If I die tonight
Would you die
Would you cry for me
If I die tonight
Would you shiver
Bleed and suffer for me
If I die tonight
Would it tingle
Oh would it even tickle you
If I die tonight if I die tonight
Would you would you
Why do I still care
'Cause I wanted to share
Everything with you
How I wanted to forgive you
If I die tonight
Would you die
Would you cry for me
If I die tonight
Would you shiver
Bleed and suffer for me
If I die tonight
Would it tingle
Oh Would it even tickle you
If I die tonight if I die tonight
Would you would you <start> Who will fight tomorrow
Who will fight today
Who will fight tomorrow
Who will change their way
I hear a baby cryin' all night long.
I hear his mother cryin' all night long.
Sun it burns like hell. Burns a mother clean.
Sun it burns a hole. Hole in a baby's dream.
I wish my father would come.
I wish my mother would not cry all night long.
Someday I'll find some redemption.
I'll find a little peace.
Blue steel for protection.
Blue steel is my guide.
Need a little love.
From the other side.
My ancestors I wish they would come.
Help my mother stop from cryin' all night long.
Offer some redemption.
Someday I'll find I'll find a little peace. <start> It's  A.M. I'm going home
I watch the white lines pass alone
There is no moon so I just drive
I feel like the last man alive
I find a voice on the radio
It sounds like someone I used to know
He sends out songs that are sad and slow
For us with nowhere else to go
That's when I get to crying
And crying never makes no sense
When too much has gone on for it to ever be coincidence
Who's gonna take you to the moon who's gonna take you to the stars
Who's gonna wait around for you who's gonna bring you back from Mars
I'm gonna take you to the moon  I'm gonna show you 'round the stars
But if I take you to the moon will you come back the way you are
If absence makes the heart grow fond
Why does my presence seem so wrong
If I am here and you are gone
I wonder what it is I've done
That's when I get to crying
And crying never makes no sense
When too much has gone on for it to ever be coincidence
Who's gonna take you to the moon who's gonna take you to the stars
Who's gonna wait around for you who's gonna bring you back from Mars
I'm gonna take you to the moon  I'm gonna show you 'round the stars
But if I take you to the moon will you come back the way you are
We keep our secrets to ourselves
We leave those lies for someone else
We rise above what we used to be
Don't get discouraged easily
That's when there's no more crying '
Cause crying never makes no sense
When too much has gone on for it to ever be coincidence
Who's gonna take you to the moon who's gonna take you to the stars
Who's gonna wait around for you who's gonna bring you back from Mars
I'm gonna take you to the moon  I'm gonna show you 'round the stars
But if I take you to the moon will you come back the way you are
I'm gonna take you to the moon
I'm gonna show you 'round the stars
But if I take you to the moon
Will you come back the way you are. <start> Ruzica si bila
Ruzica si bila
jedna u mom srcu.
Ruzica si bila
moja
Al nije za tebe
divlja kupina
ni covek kao ja.
Bog mi daje
Bog mi odnosi
ruzica si bila
sada vise nisi.
S' vremena na vrijeme
kao da cujem stope
k'o da ides preko mog praga.
S' vremena na vrijeme
a znam da nemam prava
nisi vise moja draga.
Letjele su nocas
iznad moga krova
letjele su ptice
selice
A ja sam sanjao
tvoja koljena
i tvoje poljpce. <start> So she told me
I don't want to lose you to the stars or push you back into my arms
I'm familiar with the scars
But I'm lonely
Don't want to choose you or the dark I'm a prison but the bars
Are the bottom of a bottle
That I'm holding
Oh I wish it was your body wish I wasn't such a sucker
Stuck inside this selfish struggle
For my own means
I've been meaning to survive past survival when I thrived by you
So just shut up and hold me
'Cause dammit I'm folding
If you swear that you know me
Then it's better we don't speak
Just shut up and hold me
Just give me the moment
I went from loving you so deep
To having you stolen
I need you to hold me
Like maybe for a second I can finally take a breath and
Catch a vision of the version that
I won't be
While I'm choking on emotions I'm incapable of focusing
On anything so shut up and hold me
 <start> Storm clouds cruising cross the blue skies
Shadows float across the fields of barley
I find myself an island in an island
I have to sort things out just my way
And all I find is my bar
To laugh to me I say
Like all you know is true
Is for ever time we know it's mine
I saw clouds cruise floating cross the blue sky
Shadows float across the fields of barley

Everything will come out soon my way
Now I know I see I find
It's the only way I ever felt the way I do today
All I say I play the game
I know I never could be sure of all the places that I've seen
Clouds cruising cross the blue skies
Shadows float across the fields of barley
Every self an island in an island
Working every problem out my way
Now I see I feel I know
It's the only way that anything could sort out to the way
I say you'll find it's out of mind
It's the only way I could have been
It's the only way I stand
Clouds cruise float upon the barley <start> You're pop culture is shit
Where do I stand as an individual
In a cultureless society
One that I don't need
I've got a mind of my own
Here I stand without a place to roam
Without an idol telling me just who I am
Or who I need to be
Can't erase my life
You can't rip this feeling from my arms
You can brake my back
You can brake my heart
You can't stand when life doesn't rip us apart
Vomit all your bile
Your attempt to castrate all our dreams
You live and breathe
As we jump through rings
As we all live we all die
Without a purpose is not how I lay
I will not take this one lying down
We will bring you down
Can't erase my life
You can't rip this feeling from my arms
You can brake my back
You can brake my heart
You can't stand when life doesn't rip us apart
And if you lived life
You could see through more than hollow
That your victory isn't much to me
It is the end of life
This world is my vile
I can feel it burning up my skin
My ears
My eyes
My brain
I can feel hate churnin' from within
This world is vile
I can feel it burning up my skin
My ears
My eyes
My brain
I can feel hate
Can't erase my life
You can't rip this feeling from my arms
You can brake my back
You can brake my heart
You can't stand when life doesn't rip us apart
And if you lived life
You could see through more than hollow
That your victory isn't much to me
It is the end of life <start> I got a one track mind
I got a twisted heart
I need a lesson in love
I'm right on time
For tonight's the night
I need your love
Oh yeah
Caught in the act
Had no alibi no reason why
To let you down oh
Stabbed in the back
Though it hurt i let you go
Will you take me back oh
What was right went wrong oh
It's alright to put the blame on me
For after all blame it on my last affair
It's alright it takes two to make it love
'cause love can be just a four letter word
A four letter word
I got a one track mind
I got a twisted heart
I need a lesson in love
I'm right on time
For tonight's the night
I need your love
Day turns to night
I was wrong and you were right
I feel like Mr. Hyde not Dr. J
Sometimes I'm not myself
I must be somebody else
To jeopardize your love
What went wrong was right oh
It's alright to put the blame on me
For after all blame it on my last affair
It's alright it takes two to make it love
'cause love can be just a four letter word
I got a one track mind
I got a twisted heart
I need a lesson in love

If I hada listened to my second mind
Lord I wouldn't a been sittin' here and wringin' my hands

All Night Long I Have Been Waiting
We Who Are Constantly Moving
Leaving Part Of Us Behind
She Moves Across The Room With Easy Grace
Mona Lisa Smiles Up On Her Face
I Who Am Completely Mesmerized
By The Sunlight In Her Eyes
Morning Sun Comes Thru My Windows
All Night Long I Have Been Waiting
We Who Are Constantly Moving
Leaving Part Of Us Behind
Moves Across The Room With Easy Grace
Mona Lisa Smiles Up On Her Face
I Who Am Completely Mesmerized
By The Sunlight In Her Eyes <start> Offerings...
Look what you're offering
By your hands you've emptied my soul
But I'll find some time
I'll find somewhere to grow
Look out now
Has your mind been changed by the loss of this memory
Roll on
You've got some time on your hands for where you are now
Bleeding the offerings
Yes you are now
Bleeding the offerings
My time to sit you all down
My time to save you all now
My time to lay it all out
My time
See what you're offering
See I open my eyes
Your face seems to speak aloud
Seeing it all in my eyes
I see some things in your eyes that have never been shown before
Roll on
Believing it all in my eyes
You've got these needs but I've got somewhere to go now now
So leave it alone it's my time
With so little time it's so hard to find somewhere to go
Bleeding the offerings
Yes you are now
Bleeding the offerings
My time to sit you all down
My time to save you all now
My time to lay it all out
My time to save your souls again
My time to sit you all down now
My time to save you all now
My time to lay it all out
My time <start>  <start> Lying all alone in this midnight blue
With nothing but these memories of you
Staring at these walls that are closing in
Wondering if you're ever coming back again
Now I'm just a prisoner in this big old bed
Living with the things that I should have said
Why is it always after someone's gone
That you can see where you went wrong
I couldn't see you leaving
But I can see you're gone
That note you left on my pillow
Said I was on my own
I never heard you crying
'Cause I was seldom home
I couldn't see you leaving
But I can see you're gone
I just keep wondering where you are tonight
And if someone else is holding you tight
It took you walking out the door to see
That I'm really nothing when you're not with me
I did a good job of fooling myself
Thinking that you love would stay on the shelf
But how could anybody be so blind
To have to wake up alone and find
I couldn't see you leaving
But I can see you're gone
That note you left on my pillow
Said I was on my own
I never heard you crying
'Cause I was seldom home
I couldn't see you leaving
But I can see you're gone
I couldn't see you leaving
But I can see you're gone <start> Time to run yeah
Time to hide
Holy war in the land of fire

Wrath of gods

To the words that i speak
And the thoughts that i'm havin r gettin me really freaked
And the tears in my eyes
Fall like rain from the sky
Like the planets unligned
And your questioning why
I don't get the point
It just makes no sense
I thought it was the beginning
Have I reached the end
I'm hiding from my friends
How could they understand me
When they do not know me
They can't show me
How to live my life
What is wrong from right
But then again
Who am i
Look back the days
When i tried so hard
Just to fit in
The way i am feeling
Where do i begin <start> remember when things just weren't the same.
My life went up in smoke.
The end came crashing down on me.
Just when I found this piece of sympathy.
You turned your back.
Walked away after the eulogy.
Can I touch your lips
Feel the motion of your kiss
I remember when I first saw your face.
You took my breath away and left without a trace.
So here I stand empty handed point of view.
I took some time.
The search is up and I found you.
Can I touch your lips.
Feel the motion of your kiss
Where did you go
It's not the distance keeping you from seeing me.
It ain't the weather changing minds or changing dreams.
It's not the sight of you when I stepped off the plane.
I think that things will be much better off this way.
And when my seasons change
I might have to pray for rain.
Now that I've found you you're not leaving me.
Please stay right by my side.
I'll give you everything.
There she goes.
There she goes with me.
Another lonely winter I don't think we'll see.
Where did you go <start> I was the middle of the center part
I could taste what I'd hate
I had my bubble and it took me far
Just like a car just like a car
I wanna dine with the New York elite
I could spawn what they'd later delete
I wanna shake it off and run away
Just like a car just like a car
You should've seen his face
Can't really say the same
You should've seen this place
We could've done alright
I wanna get fined
I wanna get fined
I wanna get fined
I wanna get fined
I was the middle of the indica
Could've faced what was too late
Got in to trouble for the way you are
Get in the car get in the car
I wanna sleep with the middle of day
Lay around till' the sky is grey
Come pick it up or get out of my way
The way you are the way you are
Take me home <start> Crack rock steady are you ready to stop
The rotten blue menace Let's go kill us a cop
Crack rock steady are you ready
Living above the law
Po' little lice the po' little screws
The whitest gang crew the hated boys in blue
Like scabei on the street they infest the beat
Fucking my life but I won't admit defeat to them
Above the law above the law come now
No copper will be safe till they are dead and done now
Let's lay 'em down low let's hang 'em up high
Let's take all of these piggies and have them crucified
Crack rock steady are you ready to stop
The rotten blue menace Let's go kill us a cop
Crack rock steady are you ready
Living above the law
Hardcore rugged and raw
On the streets of New York we live above the fucking law
It don't matter the color of your skin
As long as you not scandalous commit no sin to me or my tribe
Would not be wise
Time to smell the ganja open up your fucking eyes
Step back keep your attitude in check
And give the crack rock steady much respect
Crack rock steady are you ready to stop
The rotten blue menace Let's go kill us a cop
Crack rock steady are you ready
Living above the law
Don't ya know that Satan is the man
So listen very close because we got a little plan
We're gonna have to execute some rich important people
Gonna burn down all the churches and topple all the steeples
See a frown turn that cross upside down
Grab a gun or baseball bat let's go to fuckin' town
Let's kill the police I'll be saying little more
But when the cops come to your door don't forget the choice is yours
Crack rock steady are you ready to stop
The rotten blue menace Let's go kill us a cop
Crack rock steady are you ready
Living above the law
Riot sound police come round
With the bass and drum we knock 'em down
Chop 'em up with the riffs an' in the stew in it
Drinkin' pot liquor made of poison glue pick it up
Someone way up livin' in those highrise castles
Wishing with the hope that I lick their assholes
With the beat we burn down those big brass doors
Here we go rocksteady
Crack rock steady are you ready to stop
The rotten blue menace Let's go kill us a cop
Crack rock steady are you ready
Living above the law
Crack rock steady are you ready to stop
The rotten blue menace Let's go kill us a cop
Crack rock steady are you ready
Just now stop
Crack rock steady are you ready to stop
The rotten blue menace Let's go kill us a cop
Crack rock steady are you ready
Just now stop
Crack rock steady are you ready to stop
The rotten blue menace Let's go kill us a cop
Crack rock steady are you ready
Just now stop
Crack rock steady <start> Out of the woodwork keeping hidden where they hide
Par for the course the highest horse on which they ride
The devil's grin illness is in so claim your prize
Without the facts on track sumeratism dies
I've got this chronic fever
You'll cure me non believers
Still ill and rehabilitated
By those sick enough to have created
Symbols of sanity decreasing year by year
Inflated vanity you learn to hold so dear
Opposite synonymous withholding every truth
I live to tell the tale for I am living proof
Rats rats they're living in the infirmary
Rats rats and they've been crawling all over me
Rats rats we feed them in the infirmary
Rats rats and they've been crawling all over me
We're just part of the smallest fraction
Not worthy of any reaction
Without a clue you're over medicated
By those sick enough to have created
I'm not a stranger to the threat of every modern day
Never got the facts on track and time will win this race
Each tragic accident there's a hero in its place
Your good intention for attention is gaining praise
Rats rats they're living in the infirmary
Rats rats and they've been crawling all over me
Rats rats we feed them in the infirmary
Rats rats and they've been crawling all over me <start> En ce temps le dormais dans un petit
Lit dans un coin et j'observais cet ami veuf qui
Partageait son existence avec moi.
Quelquefois dans le crscule la monotonie mais
J'is douce je me pliais e que je supposais etre l'ordre
De l'univers
Il ouvrait les fenetres pour laisser entrer un peu d'air et
Quand il nelgeait le vent soufflait la neige et tous les deux assis on
Attendait
Que l'hiver continue <start> I would send out for assistance but there's someone on the signal wire
And the corporation logo is flashing on and off in the sky
They're putting all your names in the forbidden book
I know what they're doing but I don't want to look
You think they're so dumb you think they're so funny
Wait until they've got you running to the
Night rally night rally night rally
Everybody's singing with their hand on their heart about
Deeds done in the darkest hours
That's just the sort of catchy little melody
To get you singing in the showers
Oh I know that I'm ungrateful I've got it
Lying on a plate and I'm not
Buying my share of souvenirs
You can stand to attention you can
Pray to your uncle
Only get that chicken out of here
Everyone gets armbands and D glasses
Some are in the back room and they're taking those night classes <start> Just a few facts that I thought you should know...
Life increases your chances of dying
so why are you trying at all
On a walk in the summer sun you're more likely to be in a homocide
not to mention the cancer you'll get and the light waves frying your eyes.
Dive right in... 
Dive... 

Accept the lack of control.
Let this wake you up.
The self is not in control.
Let this wake you up.

Life is full of risks.
Take your pick and dive right in.
We're approaching this all wrong nothing comes from worrying.
As you're breathing this air
you're increasing your chances of getting diseased
so retreat in your house with your spouse
the one person most likely to kill you.
Imagine a leaf as it falls to the ground
whining about an obstruction on the way down
curling itself to shield from the wind so hopelessly.

You'll laugh some say.
Laugh Some Day.
 <start> Onwards to the city
Where new money awaits
Far further from the clatter
Of your past life's mistakes
I've seen this all before
I know what can happen
When you're honest and true
It's too late to change now
Your years flew too soon
I've seen this all before
And more
You found the right cliff top
For saying goodbye
As life swung it's elbow
And spat in your eye
I've seen this all before
And more
So onwards to the city
Where new money awaits
Far further from the clatter
Of your past life's mistakes
Yes I've seen this all before
And more <start> In the back of my pickup out under the stars
Me and Miss Tina just talking about cars
She says I'm tired of riding with you up to lover's leap
She says I'm tired I'm riding in this old truck
And as long as you're in it you're out of luck
How can you stand to be seen in this dirty old heap
Well I heard what she said and I went downtown
I grabbed the first salesman that I found
I said I need an extended cab a Ford or GMC
He said son if a woman's involved with the choice you make
Here's some advice you might wanna take
You need to take a look around at these brand new SUVs
A sports utility vehicle hell they're made for women and ain't got the
strength to pull
A billy goat out of a hard drivin' rain
He said son you've been drivin' that truck to long
Your thinkin' is fuzzy and your mind is gone
Just come around here and let me show you just one thing
Don't you know the seats lay back
When you get in the way back
Of this brand new Jeep Cherokee
You can call her up and say that
We can get in the way back
And she'll find her way back to me
Well lover's leap is never gonna be the same
Cause we can sit cross legged and play a poker game
And Tina's made curtains for the windows so no one can see
Well insurance is high and that payment great
It's putting a strain on our budget
Taking food off our plate so we decided to live in our brand new SUV
Don't you know the seats lay back
When you get in the way back
Of this brand new Jeep Cherokee
I remember the day that
We got in the way back
And she found her way back to me
Well it's been thirtynine months since we signed this lease
Through a lot of tire kickers and a lot of police
Sneaking up on me and shining their light on me
Me and Miss Tina we got a family plan
We're gonna trade in our new home for a minivan
But we will never forget how we started our family
Don't you know the seats lay back
When you get in the way back
Of this brand new Jeep Cherokee
Well I called her up and said that
We oughta get in the way back
And you'll find your way back to me
Don't you know the seats lay back
When you get in the way back
Of this brand new Jeep Cherokee
It sure beats a haystack
As a matter of fact
Why don't you climb into the way back with me <start> Instrumental <start> I want it to be over
Turn the boat around and bring that girl in
I stumble through the error
Hope deferred makes the heart sick sick sick
The circle rules and ruins
Yet again we are on our own
I don't need your opinions
What I got is alright
I know you're bleeding baby
But you're not bleeding blood
Blood
I need it you never show me
Keep it in the back seat nice and sharp
Uneasy in the daytime
How'd you feel alive if you cannot climb in
We aim to make a difference
Get a sense of meaning from our time here
I don't need your opinions
What I got is alright
I know you're bleeding baby
I know you're bleeding baby
But you're not bleeding blood <start> We lie here
Quiet waiting for the rain
Hopes wander
Detached from time
I stretch out
Quiet trying to hang on
My conclusions
Out on a limb
When we get angry
We can still share the why
Don't need a reason
To play the joy of you and I
We black out
Quiet wait to start again
All explanations
They can wait
Watch the time go
Minutes stumble into days
If we could bottle fury
We'd be saved
When we get angry
We can still share the why
Don't need a reason
To play the joy of you and I
When we get angry
We can still share the why
Don't need a reason
To play the joy of you and I <start> My Lord King
You stoop to betray your own people
And even in the eyes of God do you not relent
I am therefore bound by no other course
I shall raise an army
Together we will march against you and your kind
And every born man will fight
To regain his own freedom
And cleanse his retched soul
Arise Arise <start> Need someone's hand
to lead me through the night.
Need someone's arms
to hold and squeeze me tight.
'Cause when the night begins
I'm at an end
because I need your love so bad.
Need some lips
to feel next to mine.
Need someone to stand up
and tell me when I'm lyin'.
When the lights are low
and it's time to go
that's when I need your love so bad.
Why don't you give it up
bring it on home to me
or write it on a piece of paper darlin'
so it can be read to me.
Tell me that you love me
and stop driving me mad
beacause I I need your love so bad.
Need your soft voice
talk to me at night.
Don't want you to worry baby
'cause I know we can make everything allright.
Listen to my plea baby
bring it home to me
because I need your love so bad. <start> I knew somewhere in my heart that something like happiness wouldn't continue
But these feelings of liking you won't change Goodbyeee forever to the fun daysaiaiai
From today I'm alone I have to live without your smiling face
Thinking about all about those sad things I've put a question mark on the meaning of living
ah I wanted to be with you forever so don't leave me behind
ah Forever Wasn't there from the begining was it
ah I'm getting scared I'm walking the answerless road singlemindedly
ah I really loved you
When has it become so easy to cry I want to laugh I want to laugh Next to you
I can't laugh anymore Painful Sad I want to see you
If I remember it I embrace sadness Quietly Quietly I fall down
When I realize it tears are spilling over I want to disappear I want to die I want to go crazy
Being entrapped everyday by the sweet temptations drugs and women I thought it doesn't matter
With some girl I don't know that I met at a club I picked my drug and had ectasy sex
ah I name my beloved pet that I have only for tonight
ah Slutty bunny Shaking your hips up and down just like I thought you would
ah Enchant me With your rhymical dancing
ah my baby Tonight was a perfect tone
Those days that the two of us followed our whims
Were contrarily not a lie I told myself
I keep fighting Between the loneliness and the solitude
The weakling ran away from the reason
When has it become so easy to cry I want to laugh I want to laugh Next to you
I can't laugh anymore Painful Sad I want to see you
If I remember it I embrace sadness Quietly Quietly I fall down
When I realize it tears are spilling over I want to disappear I want to die I want to go crazy
You said some everyday words to me again Thank you Thank you I love you
At that place that we met By myself Only me Will fall <start> I can't stop loving you so I made up my mind
To live in memories of old lonesome times
I can't stop wanting you it's useless to say
So I just live my life in dreams of yesterday
Those happy hours that we once knew
So long ago still make me blue
And they say that time heals a broken heart
But time has stood still since we've been apart
I can't stop loving you so I made up my mind
To live in memories of old lonesome times
I can't stop wanting you it's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday <start> My grandfather's name was Moon
Because his eyes were bright and round
No amount of time or liquor could dull them
My grandmother's name was Joy
Because it spilled out of her heart
And bathed her precious children in its warmth
And there was happiness in life
Beyond the sorrow and the pain
But how they ever found it I cannot explain
I guess time has a way of making everything alright
It's just there is not enough of it
And so we drink and we sing and we celebrate this lie
And hope that it will last morning is here night has passed
My grandfather was a doctor
He cured the sick with his kind hands
And he taught me how to sail and how to find dry land
My grandmother was all sweetness
And when she spoke we all heard bells and
They ran in such a way that we were comforted
And they held on to each other with all the strength they had
And they loved with devotion beyond what I understand
But fear has a way of making sleep unbearable
And the days seem dark and long
But we cry and we dance
And we stumble into love an awkward perfect grace
The moon is gone and the sun has took its place
The moon is gone and the sun has took its place <start> Hello honey how is every little thing
Sure I'll be glad to meet you at the beach at ten
I wanna be your browneyed handsome man
Plant my feet in the sand
Maybe you could be the Sunkist queen
In your cool Raybans
Ooohweee you and me babe
Here comes another summer of love
And we're a fine pair of coconuts
Oil me up buttercup
Park your towel over here
With your things n' stuff
I'm gonna work on my major tan
I'm gonna get it perfect yet
You go ahead hon and jump in the lake
Let me know if it's wet
Ooohweee you and me babe
Here comes another summer of love
And we're a fine pair
Under the sun
Where there's only one plan
Build a condo in the sand
And maybe we'll be fried again oh man
Oil me up now coconut
I just love to feel your hands
Oil me up now coconut
I wanna be your man
Ooohweee you and me babe
Here comes another summer of love
And we're fine coconuts <start> The wheels have lifted
I'm crossing this great expanse
That brings me back to you
It seems we waited like forever
To get caught up just where we won't refused
I know it's been a while
But I am on my way
So baby let's go dance
Across the sky tonight
Cause no boundary
Could keep me from your arms tonight
Of all the things in my life
That I could rewrite
I wouldn't trade a moment with you
I've been dreaming
I'm praying
While I'm gone
God is watching you
And if you're feeling
Like you've lost yourself
You'll discover it
When you replace lies with truth
I know it's been a while
But I am on my way
So baby let's go dance
Across the sky tonight
Cause no boundary
Could keep me from your arms tonight
Of all the things in my life
That I could rewrite
I wouldn't trade a moment
I've been praying
you've been waiting
Hear me say it
I am coming home
I've been praying
you've been waiting
Hear me say it
I am coming home
So baby let's go dance
Across the sky tonight
Cause no boundary
Could keep me from your arms tonight
Of all the things in my life
That I could rewrite
I wouldn't trade a moment with you <start> Well shake it up baby now 
Twist and shout. 
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon baby now 
Come on and work it on out.  ooh
Well work it on out honey. 
You know you look so good. 
You know you got me goin' now 
Just like I knew you would.  ooh
Well shake it up baby now 
Twist and shout. 
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon baby now 
Come on and work it on out.  ooh
You know you twist your little girl 
You know you twist so fine. 
Come on and twist a little closer now 
And let me know that you're mine.  ooh
Ah  ah  ah  ah 
Baby now 
Twist and shout. 
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon baby now 
Come on and work it on out.  ooh
You know you twist your little girl 
You know you twist so fine. 
Come on and twist a little closer now 
And let me know that you're mine.  ooh
Well shake it shake it shake it baby now.  <start> There was a chill that night in the hobo jungle
Over the train yard lay a smooth coat of frost
And although nobody here really knows where they're goin'
At the very same time nobody's lost
Then the fire went out and the night grew still
This old man lay frozen on the cold cold ground
He was a stray bird and the road was his callin'
Ridin' the rods
Sleepin' under the stars
Playin' the odds from a rollin' box car
She attended the funeral in the hobo jungle
Long were they lovers though never could they wed
Drifters and rounders and distant friends
Here I lie without anger or regret
I'm in no one's debt
Man goes nowhere
Everything comes like tomorrow
But she took that last ride there by his side
He spent his whole life pursuing the horizon
Ridin' the rods
Sleepin' under the stars
Playin' the odds from a rollin' box car <start> How can nothing ever mean something
It goes from white to gray so fast
A new pool on a strange mattress
Helps me catch up with my past
Pass me something to wipe with
We're so easy to please
Do you worry that it's loaded
Laced with a million little me's
So are you up for the hat trick
Or are you down for a rest
As the whitest light between our legs
Or hidden in my chest
And if they see us on the stairs
Or if they catch us on the sink
Move quickly and brush it off
With a giggle and a wink <start> You have sold my confidence
Now my soul is broken
You just told the perfect lie. I will not recover
The perfect demon. The perfect fit
The perfect reason to deal with it
The perfect demon a friend of mine
A stolen moment the perfect crime
One small lie and the world falls
Three short words and I cannot recover. <start> Ocean lovers who like to harmonize
They're all cousins friends and brothers
And they make their Mamas cry
They're recordmaking heartbreaking
Just West Coast boys
What I know it's a beginning of an endless harmony
Striped shirt freedom
Brave new worlds
Go out on the road
Where there's midsixties screaming
And that nighttime holiday scheming
While a lifestyle turns to gold
Music's growing
And vibrations showing
What's it all mean
I know it means there's an endless harmony
And we sang God bless America
It's a land where we tour
She takes great care of us
And people love for where we sing
We sing... <start> another day goes by of this insanity
we fight one another not the real enemy
rich bastard scum still rule this land
while their stolen wealth and positions of power go unchallenged
judges lawyers and an army of police put
property over human life and cage thousands every day
while we're bashing our heads against the same old walls
divisions in our class insure their positions of power
fight the real enemy
fight the real enemy
they ain't never gonna stop until we fucking stop them
fight the real enemy
stop fighting one another fight the real fight
fight the real enemy
corporations and bosses reap profit by millions
as we slave to make them rich we all live in shit
the religious right grows stronger in numbers
leading legions of brainwashed masses into submission
nazi scum still violently emerge
for fucks sake why don't they get the boot they deserve
all these people freely take our rights
are you happy with it well it makes me fucking sick
there's plenty of legitimate targets that surround us
recognize the oppression and real enemies around us
racist sexist shit keeps us divided
only when we unite will they ever be defeated
lets get past that shit there's an enemy before us
stop making it easier for the system that destroys us
when we start working together on our own with no leaders
and stop giving those bastards opportunity to beat us
and fight the real enemy <start> Leave me there by the fire
Cover me with a blanket
Over my dead body
Hold on take a sandwich
And keep me company
Till I sssleep over my dead body
Im so cold
Leave me here
Think of nothing to do
Or tell me everything about us
Im so cold
Were walking closely together
In the park at night
Almost full moon
For lunatics and lovers
Im worthy of you
Darling Im looking for protection
After ten days of rain
Everything is soaking wet
Baby does make me forget
He said Oh what a love
He said he said Oh what a love
He said Oh what a love
He said Oh what a love <start> Somos culpables de este amor escandaloso
Que el fuego mismo de pasin aliment
Que en remanso de la noche impostergable
Nos avergenza seguir sintindolo
Poco a pocofuimos volvindonos locos
Y es el vapor de nuestro amor
Que se embriag con su licor
Y culpa al carnaval interminable
Nos hizo confundir irresponsables
Si fuimos carne de mentira casquivana
Que la imprudencia del rumor hoy desato
Que descubiertos por la luz de la maana
Nos castigaron la desidia y el dolor <start> Hey the sound is foreign. Coming from in.
You knew at the start you'd lose what you owned if you were to carry on.
Carry on you better know just where you are.
Carry on carry on you better know when.
The sooner you go the sooner you'll know when to stop.
Carry on carry on you better know just where you are.
Carry on carry on you better make tracks.
Carry on without me carry on if you can.
Won't you carry on without me Won't you Carry on if you can. <start> tebi je lako
jer ti imas mene
a sta sam zato
dobio
na kraju ces me ostaviti
ej to bi i blesav vidio
poneka ljubav mozda vrijedi bola
moja i tvoja vise ne
jer ti si samo trag u pijesku
gorka brazda koja nestane
danas otvaram oci
nakon svih ovih godina
niti ja voljeh tebe
nit si ti mene voljela
samo stara navika je ostala <start> The thrill is gone
The thrill is gone away
The thrill is gone baby
The thrill is gone away
You know you done me wrong baby
And you'll be sorry someday
The thrill is gone
It's gone away from me
The thrill is gone baby
The thrill is gone away from me
Although I'll still live on
But so lonely I'll be
The thrill is gone
It's gone away for good
All the thrill is gone
Baby it's gone away for good
Someday I know I'll be openarmed baby
Just like I know I know I should
You know I'm free free now baby
I'm free from your spell
Oh free free free now baby
I'm free from your spell
And now that it's all over
All that I can do is wish you well <start> Looking at the pages of my life
Faded memories of me and you
Mistakes you know I've made a few
I took some shots and fell from time to time
Baby you were there to pull me through
We've been around the block a time or two
I'm gonna lay it on the line
Ask me how we've come this far
The answer's written in my eyes
Every time I look at you baby I see something new
That takes me higher than before and makes me want you more
I don't wanna sleep tonight dreamin's just a waste of time
When I look at what my life's been comin' to
I'm all about lovin' you
I've lived I've loved I've lost I've paid some dues baby
We've been to hell and back again
Through it all you're always my best friend
For all the words I didn't say and all the things I didn't do
Tonight I'm gonna find a way
Every time I look at you baby I see something new
That takes me higher than before and makes me want you more
I don't wanna sleep tonight dreamin's just a waste of time
When I look at what my life's been comin' to
I'm all about lovin' you
You can take this world away
You're everything I am
Just read the lines upon my face
I'm all about lovin' you
Every time I look at you baby I see something new
That takes me higher than before and makes me want you more
I don't wanna sleep tonight dreamin's just a waste of time
When I look at what my life's been comin' to
I'm all about lovin' you
All about lovin' you <start> A media noche despieto con la sensacin
de que he escuchado entre sueos tu voz
y una tristeza infinita que me atrapa.
Te aoro desde que no ests.
Te veo de pie en una gabia de vrtigo
alzas el rostro dicindome adis.
Tu silueta que tizna las nubes.
Te veo desaparecer.
Una carga de siglos que te aplasta en tu viaje.
A la entrada tu cara ya es un puro carbn.
Trabajo duro
tajo que amarga.
En este da
melancola.
Veo a tu padre leyendo en el comedor.
Ha preparado la cena para ti.
El sabe lo que son ocho horas bajo el suelo
l sabe el cuerpo que traers.
De maana ese cuerpo
te transporta al infierno.
Y cuando sales piensas
ya no bajo ms.
Trabajo duro
tiempo que amarga.
En este da
melancola.
A media noche me despierto con la sensacin
de que he escuchado entre sueos tu voz <start> Bring me the head of Roman Polanski
Bring me the legs of Fred Astaire
We come from a place called heaven
That you made hell that you can sell
We set fires to this lesson
That heavens sell that lesson failed
War we need this war
War we need this war
Right on
Bring me the head of Roman Polanski
Bring me the legs of Fred Astaire
We come from this hell called heaven
That vision's held that vision killed
We set fires to your lessons

This beat flow
Everyone talks about what they think they need
They make up a list of things   ...
Everyone is different but where we can agree
Is every girl wants her boy to treat her sweet
Don't think that being mean will get you anywhere
Don't think that acting cool will make me want to care
I just need your respect if you're gonna be the one
And if you must apply then try to get the job done

Talk can be so cheap
So I just look for action
Be good to me
If you want my attraction
Maybe I just want too much
But I don't really care
I know I'm worth it
And I know he's out there
Wait wait
You might be a contender
Hey hey
Can I borrow your sweatshirt
Normally I'm not the one
To say hello first
But if I didn't I might miss out
And that might hurt

I saw the light
I've been baptized
By the fire in your touch
And the flame in your eyes
I'm born to love again
I'm a brand new man
Well the whole town's talking
'Bout the line I'm walking
That leads right to your door
Oh how I used to roam
I was a rolling stone
I used to have a wild side
They say a countrymilewide
I'd burn those beer joints down
That's all changed now
You turned my life around
Chorus
I used to love 'em and leave 'em
I'd brag about my freedom
How no one could tie me down
Then I met you
Now my heart beats true
Baby you and me together
Feels more like forever
Than anything I've ever known
We're right on track
I ain't looking back
Chorus x
I'm born to love again
I'm a brand new man <start> The stereo on plays the song to your soundtrack
You came looking for fun and you found that
Heart on your sleeve gum on your shoes
Looking this year's model feeling yesterday's news
So you take off running like a dog at a racetrack
Crowded in like clowns in a hatchback
Into your own out in the night
You get a tan from the spotlight
Lost and found in the mirror now
Coming down getting clearer now
Coming 'round getting nearer now
Lost and found right before your eyes
Right before your eyes
You never say a word you would take back
You came looking for truth and they faked that
Selling out buying in
Trading capitol gains and original sin
So you come up swinging like it's time for some payback
Too late out of date like an eight track
Fade to black fade to gray
Tired of it anyway
Lost and found in the mirror now
Coming down getting clearer now
Coming 'round getting nearer now
Lost and found and you say
It might be hard but it sure looks easy to me
And it might seem funny but it don't look funny to me
'Cause they keep on talking but they still ain't talking to me
And they think they're ready but they sure ain't ready for me
Find time to shine before the last act
You came looking for faith but you're past that
Comedy and tragedy when irony is your strategy
So you jump up singing on cue like a laugh track
Switch lanes or remain in the fast track
You don't know you don't care
See you when you get there
See you when you get there
Lost and found in the mirror now
Coming down getting clearer now
Coming 'round getting nearer now
Lost and found
Lost and found in the mirror now
Coming down getting clearer now
Coming 'round getting nearer now
Lost and found
Right before your eyes
Right before your eyes
Right before your eyes
Right before your eyes <start> She walks alone on the brick lane
The breeze is blowing
A year had changed her forever
Just like her gray home
He used to live so close here
We'd look for places I can't remember
The world was safe when she knew him
She tried to hold him hold on forever
For all that never happens
And all that never will be
A candle burning for the love we seldom keep
The earth was raw in her fingers
She overturned it
Considered planting some flowers
They wouldn't last long no one to tend them
It's funny how these things go
You were the answer to all the questions
The memories made her weary
She shuddered slowly she didn't want to
As a distant summer he began to whisper
And threw a smile her way
She looked into the glass
Liquid surface showing
That they were melding together present past
So where can I go from here
The color fading he didn't answer
She felt him slip from her vision
She tried to hold him hold on forever
So close forever in a silent frozen sleep <start> Do it do it do it
Do it do operator
Come up come up come up so hard
Do it do it do it
Do it do operator
So what so what so what so what so what
Do it do it do it
Do it do operator
So what so what so what so what so what
Its impossible and over mountain Doka
And I wonder I wonder I wonder
There is nothing else that in pieces to pieces are straight
When I forget about it
I cant face the pieces on fire
You stood straight cause dont you know
That Ive been picking up to someone
Help Im falling down
Its impossible when the night inverts us
And I wonder I wonder I wonder what I am
Its destructible but I know that someday
when Im gone Im going Im going ohohoh
I cant face the pieces on fire
You stood strangers dont you know
That Ive been picking up from somebodys left
Help Im falling down
Do it do it do it
Do it do oerator
Come on come on come on so hard

Or burn you from my memory
Well sometimes I but it just ain't no good
Well it ain't no good for me
I wanna push you right out of my heart
My heart sings a different thing
I walk out that door
And see I can't take it no more
And I'm running and running

I can't stay away no more
I'm running and running

I can't stay away no more
Sometimes I'm sure I'll do better
If I just get away from you
And break this lock took out of my heart
Go and find somebody new
I wanna be free somewhere so far away
But I can't get these feet to move
You've got a hold on me
I try and break free
But I'm running and running

I can't stay away darling
I'm running and running

I can't stay away no no
This love won't set me free
This love has captured me
This love won't let me go
This love holds my heart and my soul
I tried but I can't say goodbye
I'm running and running

I can't stay away no no
I'm running and running

I can't stay away darling
I'm running and running

I can't stay away darling I'm
 <start> You're always so nice to everyone
And it's a part of your appeal
But don't hold back with me
I'm not just anyone
Get some backbone
Tell me how you feel
Don't lie you're sick of me
Don't try to cover it up baby
Don't lie you're sick of me
And you want me to shut up <start> 
Will you stand up or will you freeze
That savage woman make you pleased
Turn your inside outside in
Still you don't know where she has been
Living sin
Can't you see through
She's going to realize the way to sound you
Finely ground you
Silence Never speak a word about a one night lover
Tell you stories of a meeting with a younger brother
Twisting All the people lyin' just to find a cover
No one ever gonna buy it from a twofaced mother
Can't you see through
She's going to realize the way to sound you
Took you never saw it coming
Hooked you up with cocacola cunning
Nice and slippery <start> 
I still got that same look that sets me off.
'Cause there's just something about you.
I got these feelings to let it show 'cause I wouldn't let you go.
I shouldn't of let you go.
You asked me for closure before and girl I told you it's over it's over
It's not over.
So here we go again.
It's like I'm falling in love all over again.
For the first time and I know that it feels right.
I think I'm falling in love all over again.
Love at first sight do you know how I feel to the left left left.
On the right right right.
To the back back back
On the side side side.
To the left left left.
On the right right right.
To the back back back
On the side side side.
Tonight.
I know I tried to not face the truth but no one can love me like you do.
Your love is static it pulls me in like a song when it first begins I
Just don't want to let you in 
Just take me over and you are my controller.
I told ya I told ya I told ya I'm ready to go again 
It's like I'm falling in love all over again.
For the first time and I know that it feels right.
I think I'm falling in love all over again.
Love at first sight do you know how I feel to the left left left.
On the right right right.
To the back back back
On the side side side.
To the left left left.
On the right right right.
To the back back back
On the side side side.
Tonight.
Baby there's something that you did to hold me on.
Maybe there's something that just keeps me from moving on.
The moment I see you I know it's going to be you I got this figured out.
It's like I'm falling in love all over again.
For the first time and I know that it feels right.
I think I'm falling in love all over again.
Love at first sight do you know how I feel to the left left left.
On the right right right.
To the back back back
On the side side side.
To the left left left.
On the right right right.
To the back back back
On the side side side.
Tonight.



 <start> You find your way
To write your song
And come what may
I hope you find friends with whom you belong
I said I hope you find friends with whom you belong
'Cause you'll never know the reason
Why the seas rise and fall
You'll never know the reason
Or if there's a reason at all
Make sure you stay
When you find love in your heart
And as it lights up your way
Don't let your friends fall apart
I said I hope you find friends with whom you belong
I said I hope you find friends with whom you belong
'Cause you'll never know the reason
Why the seas rise and fall
You'll never know the reason
Or if there's a reason at all
'Cause you'll never know the reason
Why the sun shines at all
You'll never know the reason
Why we each must one day fall <start> 
Cuando llegas a ese fondo
ya no sientes el temor
de la guerra de la vida
hay un cambio de teln.
Es el miedo ya sin sabor
el sendero viste un azul rumor.
El pasado ya no importa
el futuro no existi
el presente es infinito
tu lo riegas con sudor.
Roca negra sin ms color
la conquista alegre nunca se agot.
Tu linterna no da luz
para ser hilo del sol
esperanza das ilusin
al esfuerzo sin pasin.
Cuando luchas en el fango
laberinto indmito
tu tristeza se refleja
an no entiendes la razn.
De ese infierno del gran dolor
que a otros siempre sirve de mullido silln.
Tu presencia en las tinieblas
pocos mundos derrib
en el fondo de la mina
no da tiempo al soador.
Estructuras son de metal
unos muros llenos pronto a derrumbar. <start> We measure our lives in years
But they don't mean much
Always fading away
The things we can't touch
I Didn't want you to go
I Didn't want you to stay
I Didn't want you to know
What was inside of me
We measure our lives in years
But they don't mean much
Always fading away
The things we can't touch
I never told you a lie
I never meant to deceive
I never gave you the time
Or led you to believe
Let it go
Let it go
Chorus
I'm all alone
So far away
Under the sun
Sometimes you stay
Sometimes you run
Don't want to be the only one
Underneath the sun
We measure our lives in years
But they don't mean much
Always fading away
The things we can't touch
I'm never seeing it through
I'm always walking away
Maybe I don't believe
That it's inside of me
We measure our lives in years
But they don't mean much
Always fading away
The things we can't touch
I can't believe that I'm lost
I don't know how to survive
I can't believe that I'm here
And that I'm still alive
Let it go
Let it go
Chorus
Sometimes I feel I'm on my way
Sometimes I feel I'm on my own
It's harder and harder every day
Nobody wants to be alone
Chorus
I was looking for myself
Got lost along the way
Now it feels like someone else
Has got control of me <start> 
My thoughts are slowly coming out loud.
I flinch each time I hear them out loud.
I guess I know what it's like now
to be honest.
To see what I'm hiding
in the closet.
Do I still look the same to you now
am I still clean enough

We slowly sink into cigarette ash.
You sleep while I tip the bottle back.
I guess we've seen what it's like now
to be lovers.
To scream that we're nothing
without each other.
Can I lay back and close my eyes
and pretend you're mine

Have we made a fool of love
Have we taken all the good away
If we're not supposed to be alone
then I'm begging you to stay
here.
I saw your face in the mirror last night.
Blood stained your clothes
bags under your eyes.
I guess you've heard what I'm like now
just a body.
You're haunting our bedroom
and the hallway.
And I still hear your voice in my head
saying awful things. <start> It's now or never
Come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling
Be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late
It's now or never
My love won't wait.
When I first saw you
With your smile so tender
My heart was captured
My soul surrendered
I'd spend a lifetime
Waiting for the right time
Now that your near
The time is here at last.
It's now or never
Come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling
Be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late
It's now or never
My love won't wait.
Just like a willow
We would cry an ocean
If we lost true love
And sweet devotion
Your lips excite me
Let your arms invite me
For who knows when
We'll meet again this way
It's now or never
Come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling
Be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late
It's now or never
My love won't wait. <start> 
The tiger he looked out of his cage and smiled
He said come here boy I want to talk to you a while
He said I once was running wild and free just the same as you
But it's one step from the jungle to the zoo
Its one step from the jungle to the zoo
You better watch out or they're gonna get you too
They'll clip your claws cut your hair make a pussy cat out of you
Its one step from the jungle to the zoo
He said son when you go running through the grass
You bet look out for all the hidden traps
They'll feed you sweets and goodies 'til you're too fat to move
Then its one step from the jungle to the zoo
Its one step from the jungle to the zoo
You better watch out or they're gonna get you too
They'll clip your claws yank your fangs make a pussy cat out of you
Its one step from the jungle to the zoo
Only one step from the jungle to the zoo
You better watch out or they're gonna get you too
They'll clip your claws cut your hair make a pussy cat out of you
Its one step from the jungle to the zoo
Only one step from the jungle to the zoo
You better watch out or they're gonna get you too.....

en tu rincn
la luz del sol
no te moleste.
Si tan solo
hubiera un sol
de quien huir
cuando despiertes.
Pero ha siempre ha sido as
No conozco nada ms
que esta jaula de cristal
que es mi crcel mi hogar.
Si al menos hubiera una razn para vivir
Si con mi triste existencia
alguien pudiera sonreir
Te doy pena a ti
me doy pena a m
Me morder la cola
como siempre una vez ms.
El principio del mal rollo
es que no encuentro un final.
Te doy pena a ti
Me doy pena a mi
Te dar tu libertad
te irs de aqu
no puedo verte as.
Hay mil bosques fuera
que esperan por ti
mil noches de estrellas
te aguardan all.
Es tan grande el mundo
no te lo creers
y no hay jaulas fuera
contra qu luchar.
Dime qu prefieres
si poder vivir
tan slo un da libre
o en tu jaula mil.
Morirs por no saber
contra qu luchar
si te quedas vivirs
sin ver nada ms.

Pues algn da todo cambiar <start> Got my feet on the ground
Ain't it funny that you're not around
Got my head in the clouds
I can feel it I'm coming down
I remember the way we were
I remember every word
When I think about what might've been
I can see what I'm livin' in
Chorus
Would it be alright if I could live again
Would you even care if I said it's over
Would it be alright if I could live again
Live again
Out every night
Never see the light
Were you hangin' in
Were you giving in
I remember the way you cry
I remember every lie
When I think about what might've been
I can see what I'm livin' in
Chorus
I remember the way we were
I remember every word
When I think about what might've been
I can see what I'm livin' in
I remember the way you cry
I remember all your lies
When I think about what might've been
I can see what I'm livin' in
Chorus Repeat X <start> Breathe trust bless me
And release
Climb hard or never be seen
Closed off rescue to breathe
Just bless me.
Too sided time
Your rebirth can't hurt
Branch out behind
The pain.
Closure has come to me
Myself
You will never belong
To me.
Closure has come to me
Myself
You will never belong
To me
Had to turn
And lay down
You're the sting of disease
Phase you out
Should've seen this coming
Go on
Confusing this soul
Hold my breath
Til you rupture
Three days aside
Your rebirth can't hurt
Branch out behind
Pride.
Closure has come to me
Myself
You will never belong
To me.
Closure has come to me
Myself
You will never belong
To me
Like a leech
I hold on
As if we belonged
To some
Precious pure dream
Cast off
You've seen what's beneath
Now fail me
Forget closure
Forget closure
Forget closure
Forget closure
Closure has come to me
Myself
You will never belong
To me
Closure has come to me
Myself
You will never belong
To me
Go <start> Do you remember
The things we used to say
I feel so nervous
When I think of yesterday
How could I let things
Get to me so bad
How did I let things get to me
Like dying in the sun
Like dying in the sun
Like dying in the sun
Like dying x
Will you hold on to me
I am feeling frail
Will you hold on to me
We will never fail
I wanted to be so perfect you see
I wanted to be so perfect
Like dying in the sun
Like dying in the sun
Like dying in the sun
Like dying x <start> Well did you ever wake up
With them bullfrogs on your mind
Well did you ever wake up
With them bullfrogs on your mind
Your gonna wake up laughin'
Laughin' just to keep from crying.
Well did you ever wake up
With that one woman on your mind
Well did you ever wake up
With that one woman on your mind
Your gonna wake up laughin'
Laughin' just to keep from crying.
My mommy got em

I woke up this morning
My grandma and grandpa had them too
Well don't you know about that
I got the bullfrog blues.
Bullfrog <start> Reality punk is all together
Fighting each other just ain't clever
You've got the wrong enemy picking on a friend
If we don't stand together then this is the end
Today's youth stand together
In your combat and leather
There's a cause a cause to fight
Not each other we must unite
Fight the real enemy Repeat x 
Banned from the pubs everynight
Same old story will you ever see the light
Everyone toghter now listen to me
Don't fight each other fight the real enemy <start> If there is a tear on my face
It makes me shiver to the bones
It shakes me Babe
It's just a heartache that got in my eye
And you know I never cry I never cry
Sometimes I drink more than I need
Until the TV's dead and gone
I may be lonely
But I'm never alone
And the night may pass me by
But I'll never cry
Take away take away my eyes
Sometimes I'd rather be blind
Break a heart break a heart of stone
Open it up but don't you leave it alone
'cause that's all I got to give you
Believe me Babe it ain't been used
My heart's a virgin its never been tried
And you know I'll never cry
And you know I'll never cry
And you know I'll never cry
Never cry I'll never cry
Break a heart break a heart of stone
'cause that's all I got to give you
Believe me Babe it ain't been used
My heart's a virgin its never been tried
And you know I'll never cry
Never cry
I'll never cry <start> I don't know what u been told
What I feel is in my soul
cause what I want I got for free
It's all I need  satisfy me
Now I just want  make u see
And I don't need no sympathy
And I just want  break on thru
And what am I supposed  do
Right on mr. turn your light on me
Back off sister won't u let me be
Catch my spirit won't u set it free
Now can u see the other side of me
I woke up in a velvet room
That's when I heard the sonic boom
I don't want no dope and smoke
I think I'll tighten up my stroke
Right on mr. turn your light on me
Back off sister won't u let me be
Catch my spirit won't u set it free
Now can u see the other side of me
I don't want  give it up

More tv's in the swimming pool
Right on mr. turn your light on me
Back off sister won't u let me be
Catch my spirit won't u set it free
Now can u see the other side of me
Right on mr. turn your light on me

Still plays a part in what I do always I'm here for you
I think that if we were all we had
That's more than most people ever have
Anyway oh anyway you can stay here
I know you're still there because you're scared
That you'll lose everybody
I know you're still there because you're scared
That you'll lose everything
I know you're still there because you're scared
I'm here if you're scared to go through
Anything just reach out in front of you always won't you stay near
So close we played it as if we cared
Don't stop now that we're almost there anyway oh I'm here for you

That you'll lose everybody

We wanna see those flashing feet
We wanna see if you can make a break
And have you have you got the right stuff

Are we doing something for you
Or can you do something for me
Are you gonna make a few moves
Or sit back and let it all be

Or can you do something for me
Are you gonna make a few moves
Or sit back and let it all be
Wait and see <start> Break up already wake up now
Walk away take it all back now
Don't be quick to lick the scab off
You're spitting in his face with the rest of them
Break up already wake up now
Walk away take it all back now
Don't be quick to lick the scab off
You're spitting in his face with the rest of them
Please give me something I'm so thirsty
I'm so thirsty
Oh please let me warn them
Don't you come here don't bring anyone here
The chasm isn't fixed yet.
Take this water
Drinking ever deeper living water
Please give me something I'm so thirsty
I'm so thirsty
Oh please let me warn them.
Don't you come here don't bring anyone here
Please
Please give me something I'm so thirsty

Oh please let me warn them.
Don't you come here don't bring anyone here <start> Your signal across the sky
Is trying to bridge the distance
And all of the reasons why
I'm so far away
I know you can move the time
And the space that falls between us
I know you can cross the lines
All I can say is
Break them down

You are what's turning my world around
Moving me close in the moment with a single motion
Even when all of my stars are falling
You pulled me from here to you
It feels like I'm falling down
Through atmospheres and orbits
And I'm moving without a sound
I'm floating away
But you are the satellite
That makes the strong connection
With messages through the night
When the going is insane
Send them down
Cause they're keeping me alive
Send them down

A million miles away
Is as close as a razor
All the words I can't say
In a breath of silence
All the truth I'm looking for
Is just beyond my shadow
When I'm spinning in the night
You are what's turning my world around...
 <start> Sing a song of love to me
Sing out sing out
She's the one who made me free
Sing out sing out
''cause she made me smile
And she made me love
Oh she made me laugh
And she made me dance
Bombo
Little pearl inside the shell
Come out come out
From deep down in my wishing well
Sing out sing out
''cause you made me smile
And you made me love
And you made me laugh
And you made me dance
Bombo <start> Hey. I woke up today  to think about a dream I had.
A dream I left so far away. Ten seconds pass.
And as I think twenty minutes pass.
I failed my mission.
Waste of life. Waste of mind. Where's my ambition
Chalk up one girlfriend.
Two broken cars.
My band and friends are nothing more
Than parting shots not taken. Look how jaded I can be.
When I turned  I already felt too old to be in this entire scene
of sighing lazily at unaccomplished dreams.
Yeah it's my home but I think its time to go.
I'll hit once more so I don't wake up.
I have no home and I don't know where to go.
I just can't seem to get on top of this situation normal all fucked up.
Still I lay in bed.
Think of all the dreams I had and clever remarks I have said.
It seems like they all mean nothing.
Snooze.
Alarm Reset.
That's eight more minutes.
This disaster can't exist because I'm not awake to live it.
I can't seem to place where life went wrong.
It's the wrong chords.
It's one lame song.
I'll never know what exist to get off at until its passed.
So kick me in the ass.
A free shot Get it over with and kick me 'til I bleed.
It seems that's all you need. Let's go This one's on me
I don't think I'm going outside today.
I'll stay in bed all day.
Declare a personal holiday.
So you can take my page right of your phone book.
Burn my seven digits to ashes.
I won't be present in any of your classes.
Eyelids are the sky as this day passes.
I wanna stay asleep forever. <start> You know it seems to me
You fail to see beauty through invisible tears
I know what you mean but
Its not what I'm getting at when
I say
'The bits of broken glass
In the evening sun reflection
Look like stars in the night sky
Of the central reservation'
You just say
'That's not how I see it'
Moving through the rain
I hear you here
Say life is a valley of tears
And your heart is a drain
But how can that be the truth when
The storm that came was invited by you
I say
'The rain is just the moon
She's sending soul in your direction
I hope she softens you soon
With her subliminal affection'
You just say
'That's not how I see it'
There's something missing when you look at me
If all you see is what your eyes see
Hold on I'm coming in <start> I'll be there to hold you by the hand
When you need someone to walk you home
You know that I'll be there to understand
When you call me on the phone
And I'll be there to watch you when you sleep
When you close your eyes at night
And I'll be there to keep your secrets kept
Cross my heart hope to die I swear each word is true
There's only one thing I wouldn't do
I'll be there when you need a real friend
I'll be there to listen to your secrets
I'll be there and give you all I've got
I'll be there when you paint your masterpiece
And I'll be right beside your every move
I'll give you my eyes so you can see
And I'll help you to find the things you've lost
When you're busting at the seams
I swear each word is true
There's only one thing I wouldn't do
I ain't gonna love you
I ain't gonna love you
Nobody wants you like I want you
Nobody needs you like I need you
You know I would beg and plead get down on the knees
I'd do most anything it's true but I ain't gonna love you I ain't gonna love you
Because I love you
I'll be there to love the things you love
I'll be the one who knows your middle name
Be the only one that you can trust
I'll give you the blood that's in my veins
I swear these words are true
There's only one thing I wouldn't do
I ain't gonna love you
'Cause nobody wants you like I want you
Nobody needs you like I need you
You know I would beg and plead get down on my knees
Do most anything for you but I ain't gonna love you I ain't gonna love you
Because I love you
Because I love you <start> You know nothin's gettin' done when talk is all you hear
Like someone revvin' up a truck never put in gear
But you don't see a cowboy run his mouth and strut around
He just takes the bull by the horns and throws him to the ground
And takin' care of business not just puttin' on a show
And when it gets down to it everybody knows
It ain't the smoke it's the fire that gets the burnin' done
If it wasn't for the bullet nobody'd fear the gun
It ain't the bark it ain't the growl it's the bite that hurts
Thunder's just a noise boys lightnin' does the work
Well you can talk about the farm or you can plow the ground
Argue with a rusty nail or hammer it on down
You can stand there in the dark cussin' at the night
Or you can just reach out your hand and turn on the light
There ain't no limit in this life to how far you can get
But if you're goin' all the way you gotta break a sweat
It ain't the smoke it's the fire that gets the burnin' done
If it wasn't for the bullet nobody'd fear the gun
It ain't the bark it ain't the growl it's the bite that hurts
Thunder's just a noise boys lightnin' does the work
Well I've heard thunder talkin' up a storm
Rattlin' my windows and knockin' on my door
But I've seen lightnin' blow a cypress tree in half
The thunder's busy talkin' and lightnin's kickin'
It ain't the smoke it's the fire that gets the burnin' done
If it wasn't for the bullet nobody'd fear the gun
It ain't the bark it ain't the growl it's the bite that hurts
Thunder's just a noise boys lightnin' does the work
The thunder's just a noise boys lightnin' does the work
Ahh yeah
Gonna getcha
Getcha good <start> You'll get no answer from me
About what I want of what I get
Brave enough to speak afraid to see
Confuse the issue till you forget
And I've tried
To finally decide
Why
I'm in your face
And if you can't already tell
I am unable to let things go
I'm told I do it very well
But more important you should know
That all the same
You've got no one to blame
But yourself
If you call that a waste
'Cause it ain't me
That's been hurting you inside
And if you've learned
You'll know much more than I
That you're gonna have to go and fine it
You'll have to dig beneath the ground
You'll have to unearth every ugly stone
That kept you on your own
And simply put them down
You're gonna have to look around
You'll get no answer from me
About what I get or what I want
That was enough to make her leave
She's not the first one come and gone
And I don't care
Buyer beware
Of me
Cause it might get rough
If you want peace then live alone
If you want to hide then find a stage
Each a brief but perfect home
To accommodate your rage
And sometimes
In the midst of all my crimes
I feel lost
Or have I lost enough
Remaining friends
Remind me as they say
It's up to you
The things you throw away
And still you're gonna have to go and find it
You'll have to dig beneath the ground
You'll have to unearth every ugly stone
That kept you on your own
And simply put it down
You're gonna have to look around
You're gonna have to look around
You're gonna have to look around <start> butterflies sunflowers

when i'd see something in your face
then it all just went away
and turned to hate
i thought you were in love
what a fool's mistake
i don't care about love now
it's true i'm through

Of a lonely broken heart
Weird nightmare
Why must you torment me
Weird nightmare
Pain and misery
In a heart thats loved and lost
Take away the grief youve caused
Cant sleep at night
Twist turn in fright
With the fear that Ill live it all again
In my dreams
Youre there to haunt me
When you say she doesn't want me
I've been hurt
Do you know what that means
Weird nightmare
Take away this dream youve born
Weird nightmare

That has paid the price of love
A thousand fold

Is this pain about my new affliction
Waves of pain are sweeping through me
Just tell me who would ever believe me
Rather than believe it's all so easy
To cause me to suffer all this grievin'
I blame it on something that can't be explained
I said that I've got a new kind of pain
I've got headache in my heart heartache in my head
Each and every single day
Money is big in some sort of way
Forget all the doctors being absolutely certain
For months for me they can't find what's hurting
When the pills that the pain brings on
It's got nothing to do with the fact that you're gone
You ain't the reason why I don't sleep at night
It's only because I'm trying to fight this
Headache in my heart then I got a heartache in my head <start> from The Nightshift Watchman
..............................................
I walk the High Hill tonight
It stands behind the town
It was golden in the autumn sky
As the sun was going down
I could not stay to answer
The man who rang my telephone
Cause when I hear the High Hill calling
I have to go alone
I climb alone the winding trail
Leave the town below
I wrap my woven blanket round me
Up here the wind can blow
The brighter stars come peeking through
A canopy of branches high
Out across the town lights glistening
I think I'm gonna fly
I am looking down from High Hill
I am looking down
On my four walls
In my small town
High
I'm standing high in windy dark
Above this amber glow
Glistening sea of shining lights
A half a mile below
And somewhere on that shining sea
A tiny light I call my own
I feel like I been too long sailing
I finally made it home
I am looking down from High Hill
I am looking down
My dream's been found
In my old home town
I am looking down from High Hill
I am looking down from High Hill
I am looking down from high

Suitcase some baggage in her head she screams out yes and it's crazy beautiful
Crazy beautiful.
Tattooed lying on the bed Don't
Regret smashing her fist into the wall
Crazy beautiful
She's worth it all.
She leaves the ashtray on the bed
She don't sense any thoughts inside her head
She just has to get them out
Can't shut her mouth.
She's like a song that's in my brain
But every other lyric says my name
And I just can't turn it off
Can't get enough.
Knew you were trouble back then but that's what turned me on
It's all wrong.
Suitcase some baggage and a head she screams out yes and it's crazy beautiful
Crazy beautiful.
Tattooed lying on the bed Don't
Regret smashing her fist into the wall

Sometimes something that is not perfect ends up being what you want
Sometimes she lets me into places where her demons come to haunt.
She's like an angel that's corrupted and I'm hanging on to her...

my picture in the psper
with a small covering story.
on the next page a eulogy by my mum
a little praise for her little boy
the one that she called son.
so if that leaves you lonely
well you brought it on yourself
you never even trusted me
when I said there was no one else.
no disrespect intended
but the faewell won't be fond
for the love it died
each time you lied.
an ever weakening bond.
and now it's time to say goodbye to you
and all the pain you put me through.
if you were a friend
you'd be there when I needed you.
everything is closing in
I try to talk but where to begin.
one final sigh my last goodbye.
engulfing flames I close my eyes.
I think of you as the heat consumes me
as I lose you to another guy
you lose me for eternity.
torment and tears from another wasted year
conscious of the way I felt
you blamed me for the cards you dealt.
never even told me
what you claimed that i'd done wrong.
just made me feel unwelcome
said we couldn't carry on.
you always got so caught up
in your ideals of perfection
never even realised
you'd bought a misconception.
as the burns higher
I look at my past.
what a shame to think you'll miss me
that i'll get the last laugh.
why was it that I loved you
when you treated me that way.
the question stays unanswered now
on this my final day.
as I come to end my life now
I look back with no regrets.
it wasn't me who was guilty
of the friendship being wrecked.
you had no comprehension.
or you should have spoken up.
for your bitter words I always heard.

Looking so fine cosmo behind
Fermentation of time like reunite wine
Well I'm bubbling up and steaming like an active volcano
I think I clogged up all your pipes better get yourself some draino
I get annoyed cause I can't avoid
Baby sounding like a mongoloid

If you do not bite I hope you blow like dynamite
Happy thanksgiving would you like a little white meat

The want to be gangster
The want to be dapper Don Don John on
The wall I'm your biggest fan
Next to my little brother Paul.
Losing his grip like Pesci he'd flip
If you talk to his brother he says they
Always planned this trip
He wasn't okydokie running around like
Don Quixote trying to free a man he
Didn't even know B.
He had the roots he bought the suits
But the boys didn't like him mto tell you the truth
He had J.G. on his pinky ring and he
Lied about doin' some time up in singsing
He flipped one fine summer afternoon
He told his brother Paulie something had to be done soon.
He took Paulie and a couple of boys and jacked the
Coup de Ville to Illinois.
Ladi dadi free John Gotti The King of New York
He got a clipper from a stripper he met at a club
Two sticks of dynamite and a . Snub
He tried to see the Don without an invitation
Stood outside the gate with his three man demonstartion
Waving picket signs the C.O. saw a nine
And only Paulie go away with the skin on his behind.
Back in the borough the cops are acting
Thorough they raided Franky's room
And then they saw his bureau upon it was a note
With a rhyme that was dope about
How he was breaking John out and how he couldn't cope.
It sait I don't fly coach never save the roach

Wonder how she smells
Wonder what she's wearing
In the deep of herself
Wander what she tastes like
With what flavour she will come
The shape of her figure
To what she will become
She's so worth waiting for
She's all so worth waiting for
Wonder if she turns out
To be image of you
Always so determined
About what to do
Like God's wondrous purpose
The highest of them all
The very crown of life
She's so worth waiting for
She's all so worth waiting for
Like god's wondrous purpose
The highest of them all
The very crown of love
She's so worth waiting for
She's all so worth waiting for
All so worth waiting for <start> I've got no time for fairy stories
I'm not a little girl
So you can leave me all alone
And turn of the lights as well
If you were frightened then listen
But I don't think you'd like it
Such a nice kid
Chorus
Nobody's lookin' now
I throw my toys around
Somebody's being very bad
I wonder who it could be
Somebody's gon' to get in trouble
I know it isn't me
I'm just a little angel
But cha don't know what I've done
When your backs turned
Chorus
Pick up those building blocks
Chop off the baby's locks
Swing dolly by her hair
Put down that teddy bear
Slam dunk a happy clown
I throw my toys around
I've got no time for bedtime stories
I'm not a little child
Everything makes me furious
And everything makes me wild
If you are frightened
Then whistle and I'll come running to you
As you boo hoo
Chorus x
I throw my toys around
I throw my toys around
I throw my toys around
I throw my toys around
I throw my toys around
I throw my toys around
I throw my toys around
I throw my toys around
I throw my toys around
I throw my toys around <start> He's there in case I wandered off
He's scared because I warned
He's scared in case I want it all
He's scared 'cause I want
All in all the clock is slow
Six color pictures all in a row
Of a marigold <start>

 <start> It isn't safe in here
It isn't safe on our own
We've got a new place to go and we will call this our home
The sky is clear but the air is thick with smoke
And all you've got is some heels your lipstick and your raincoat
So let's kill tonight
And we will embrace it with arms held wide
And its blood is black it's floating through the bedroom window
So let's stand so close and we'll not let go
I've got friends here and they're all dying to meet you
We won't feel sad as they're calling our names
I turn to you and wipe the sleep from your face
We've got nothing to lose
we'll leave nothing to fate
Let's take a walk we'll meet and we'll be on our own way
So let's kill tonight
And we will embrace it with arms held wide
And its blood is black it's floating through the bedroom window
So let's stand so close and we'll not let go
I've got friends here and they're all dying to meet you
Hang close I've got a plan to kill this
I've got to whisper in your ear
Let's gather all of human life
And by the time it blows we'll be well clear
Let's run
Run run run run and give it up
Run run run run for good
Run run run
So let's kill tonight
And we will embrace it with arms held wide
And its blood is black it's floating through the bedroom window
So let's stand so close and let's not let go
I've got friends here and they're all dying to meet you <start> Into the Dungeon with evil men
The people has risen we're free again
Come out of the closet
Come out of the hole
Come out of the woodwork
Come into the fold
Rebels and fighters a license to kill
Unite with the bandits down from the hills
Open your windows
Open your doors
Open your minds
To a freedom of thought
Raise our voices raise our flag
Smash the symbols of the life never had
Long live the symbols
Long live the scheme
Long live our hopes
Long live the dream
Dance in the streets at the carnival
Celebrate the victory now
Drink the wine from the rich man's cask
This revolution won't be the last <start> Oh baby I'll buy you a diamond ring
Oh baby I'll buy you a diamond ring
If you let me love you darling
I'll give you almost anything
Well it's early in the mornin'
And my baby can't be found
Oh it's early in the mornin'
And my baby can't be found
I'm looking for my baby
But she ain't nowhere around
Oh baby I need your love tonight
Oh baby you know I need your love tonight
I want to make love to you darling
While the moon is shinin' bright yeah
Well it's high up in the mornin'
And I'm lookin' for my babe
Yes I been standin' in the mornin'
And I'm lookin' for my babe
If she don't come back to me
I'll put her six feet in her grave <start> I got a beat up piece of paper  It's a message from a king
He says  I got to get you out of here
He say  I got to let you in
'Cos I've been down the darkest road there is  I've seen the other side
I got a licence to go  Straight through your pain
Ain't no big deal  'Cos I'm qualified  Yeah I'm qualified
Qualified in fear and pain  I'm qualified in lies and shame
I'm qualified with a broken heart
You knock me down  I get back up again
'Cos' I'm qualified
I'm qualified  To get your love
I'm qualified  To know what you're thinking of
I'm qualified  in broken dreams
I can save you from where you've been
'Cos I'm qualified
I'm qualified to make you smile
I'm qualified to save your pain
Qualified to give a real good time
Qualified to make your sun shine <start> Pulled into a truck stop...my luck is over
The plan is failing....i think not <start> Now I fall to the ground
I can't get up well never mind
I know you'll pull me up by my bones
And say I'm sand to polished stone
Today's gone and it won't be long
Before we fall asleep and forget what we've done
We won't get up 'cause today is fun
We're alone
Now you bite my tongue
And when the alcohol's gone
I won't feel a thing
So you can't carry on
Today's gone and it won't be long
Before we fall asleep and forget what we've done
We won't get up 'cause today is fun
We're alone
It's numb
It's numb
It's numb <start> I've had a beautiful evening
For awhile I've forgot she was gone
Now she's back on my mind how I hate closing time
For there's no place to go but home
No place to go but home and nobody home when I get there
They've turned out the lights friends have said their goodnights
Now there's no place to go but home
 guitar 
I drive through this ghost of the city
And I've never felt so all alone
It's the world's time to sleep and it's my time to weep
And there's no place to go but home
Nowhere to go but home...
Now there's no place to go but home <start> Do do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do do
Was I not enough stimulation
Hit by a brake the other day
Just when I thought that I'm okay
You didn't like my conversation
I can't come up with something new
It doesn't really matter what I do
So here's my observation
You could never see it through my eyes
And I'm too tired to try
So don't call and say your coming back for me
Don't mean nothing
I'm always getting over you
And don't lie and say your over me
Don't mean nothing
I'm always getting over you
Do do do do
Do do do do do
Was it too much aggravation
Your telling me the way that I won't see
And then I change my mind you disagree
I used to be our inspiration
You chase your mind you disappear
And I know it's never over
So don't call and say your coming back for me
Don't mean nothing
I'm always getting over you
And don't lie and say your over me
Don't mean nothing
I'm always getting over you
Do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do do
Was I not enough stimulation
Hit by a brake the other day
Just when I thought that I'm okay
You didn't like my conversation
And I can't come up with something new
It doesn't really matter what I do
So don't call and say your coming back for me
Don't mean nothing
I'm always getting over you
And don't lie and say your over me
Don't mean nothing
I'm always getting over you
Do do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do do
So don't call and say your coming back for me
Don't mean nothing
I'm always getting over you
And don't lie and say your over me
Don't mean nothing
I'm always getting over you
So don't call and say your coming back for me
I'm always getting over you <start> You know my life would be easy
If people would leave me alone
Stop steppin' on my fingers
That I've been workin' to the bone
Maybe then I could get back with you
God damn I hate the blues
I've tried to put 'em in a bottle
Some people pu 'em in their arm
Either way they're gonna kill you
Slowly eat away your heart
If only I could stop the thought of you
God damn I hate the blues
I never learned to listen
To the promises I'd made
I never thought you'd stay away
Leaving me to take the blame
I never thought you'de follow through
God damn I hate the blues <start> No I won't be saved
No I won't be saved
Heart is in my mouth
As I turn my face away
And I walk down the deserted streets
Desolate and grey
Nothing more to say
Whispering your name
Under winter skies
Imprisoned by the thought of you
Captured by your eyes
Mesmerized
No I won't be saved
I will always be enslaved
No I won't be saved
In my heart your name engraved
I'm down on my knees
In a willing sacrific
I won't confess my transgressions
I won't repent my vice
I'll pay the price
No I won't be saved
I will always be enslaved
No I won't be saved
In my heart your name engraved
No I won't be saved
I won't be saved
No I won't be saved
I won't be saved
The visions come at night
I feel I'm hypnotized
I tremble as I fall into
The furnace of your eyes
And out of sight
No I won't be saved
I will always be enslaved
No I won't be saved
I will love you to the grave
No I won't be saved
I will always be enslaved
No I won't be saved
In my heart your name engraved
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down <start> 
The gypsy wizard he rattled
His broken tattered tambourine
And asked for me to share with him
In this timeless dream. Ow
Lost in the dazzling fascination
I caught myself touching my imagination
And holding the sights I'd never known
And hearing the sounds I'd not yet been shown.
Toms and trinkets made of green to make us all see.
Tainted jewels and diamond rings and other things. OW
Lost in a maze of liquid smoke
I thought my brains were gonna choke
Holding the sights I could not tell
Under gypsy wizard's spell. <start> atomic electricity is just a filthy mess and waste
it makes you wonder why they bother with such risks entailed
is it just a coincidence this atomic power makes
an energy source of uranium from which atom bombs are being made
behind our backs they scheme and dig mine and your graves
behind our backs they laugh as their shelters are being made
out of sight on the quiet the plans are being neatly laid
while we sit wasting time in the safe ignored shade
what if soon we were all out in the sun
dodging the fallout trying to hide or run
we need to stop it now before they've begun
don't wait to be asked no questionnaire will come
they lie we die
we've left it in their bloody hands for far too long
atomic energy is gonna finance their bomb
they think they fight wars on mine and your behalf
so let's bloody tell 'em you've got it fucking wrong
what about the people in far off remote places
they never even knew bombs exist
they'll never have the chance to say or protest
that they didn't want their lives blown to bits
they lie we die
when they crawl from their shelters they'll start it all again
it makes you wonder who are these powermad women and men
so that in a hundred years they'll be as strong as before
but as usual at no expense to them
it's no use saying oh it's too late
it's no use saying that it will never happen
it's no use saying that's the way it goes
is it really the way you wanna go 
they lie we die
they sigh we cry
we burn they learn
they lie we fry
they dream we scream
they lie we die
is it really the way you wanna go <start> I'm gonna keep my heart safe
In a special place
I'm gonna lock myself up
A hundred miles away
I don't want to do
What I did today
I'm gonna get a new world
Made out of paper stones
And in my plastic house
I'll never be alone
I don't want to do I want to go...
Yeah yeah I want to go
Yeah yeah I want to go
I want to disappear
And have no sense of time
And I've got a little secret here
And I use it every night
I don't want to do I want to go...
Yeah yeah I want to go
Yeah yeah I want to go <start> Well there's a cruel sun beating
Where there once was a river
Crops are bending in the heat
But still her dark skin shivers
When you move to the beat of hungry
It's a slow aching journey
She'd hide but there ain't no shelter
Yet the cool of the night
Reveals the spark of the sweeter life
So she dreamin' in color and livin' in black and white
Chorus
Dreamin' in color livin' in stone cold black and white
Sittin' a grey day leanin' on a bright new tomorrow
Where some rainbow rules will make everything all right
She ain't about to let the blues over come her
She'll contend with this day to day life
She's just dreamin' in color and livin' in black and white
Well it's a gunshot down
Here in the heart of the city
He slides closer to his mama
It's months since they've seen daddy
There's a pale light shinin'
From a bare refrigerator
By the stained cracked plaster
By the cold radiator
But he's sure out beyond these mean streets
There lies paradise
So he's dreamin' in color and livin' in black and white
Chorus
He ain't about to let the blues over come him
He'll contend with this day to day life
He's just dreamin' in color and livin' in black and white
Chorus
They ain't about to let the blues over come them
They'll contend with this day life
They're just dreamin' in color and livin' in black and white
They're just dreamin' in color and livin' in black and white
Dreamin' in color livin' in stone cold black and white Repeat x <start> Oh something's got a hold of me now
It's a feeling burnin' up like I'm on fire
Hold me tight babe don't leave me by myself tonight
'Cause I don't think I can make it through the night
I think I'm in love
And my life's lookin' up
I think I'm in love
'Cause I can't get enough
I think I'm in love
It's gotta be love
It surrounds me ooh like a sea of madness
It controls me makes me do all the things I do for you
On my mind babe thinkin' about you now
And I don't know if I'll make it through the night
I think I'm in love
And my life's lookin' up
I think I'm in love
'Cause I can't get enough
I think I'm in love
It's gotta be love
I think I'm in love and love's enough
I think I'm in love
And my life's lookin' up
I think I'm in love
'Cause I can't get enough
I think I'm in love
It's gotta be love
Baby help me do it
There must be something to it
I know it's gotta be love <start> Well I thought that the rain would cool things down
But it looks like it don't
I'd like to get you to change your mind
But it looks like you won't.
From now on I'll be busy
Ain't going nowhere fast
I'm just glad it's over
And I'm seeing the real you at last.
Well didn't I risk my neck for you
Didn't I take chances
Didn't I rise above all
Most unfortunate circumstances
Well I had some rotten nights
Didn't think that they would pass
I'm just thankful and grateful
To be seeing the real you at last.
I'm hungry and irritable
And I'm tired of this bag of tricks
At one time there was nothing wrong with me
That you could not fix.
Well I sailed through the storm
Strapped to the mast
Oh but our time has come
And I'm seeing the real you at last.
When I met you baby
You didn't show no visible scars
You could ride like Annie Oakley
You could shoot like Belle Star.
Well I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble
Trouble always comes to pass
All I care for about now
Is that I'm seeing the real you at last.
Oh yes I am.
Well I'm gonna quit this baby talk now
I guess I should have known
I got troubles I think maybe you got troubles
I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
Whatever you gonna do
Please do it fast
I'm still trying to get used to
Seeing the real you at last.
Oh yes I am. <start> Lookin' out for something special
Something crazy to call my own
Worked all week
Now that it's over
Yes I'm ready to bring it on
Driving to me
It'll be easy
After all that's what it's for
If the fire's too hot
Get out of the kitchen
Or do it do it do it on the floor
So get out now
Before it's too late
Don't bring me down
Don't you wait too long
Wild wild women
Make the world go round
Wild wild women
Wild wild girls
Kick your heels
Set in motion
After all they never stop
Feels so good
Must be illegal
That's no reason to call the cops
She goes crazy
In the corner
Like some forward flash
No problems
No headaches
No troubles
That's the best
So come on now
Before it's too late
Don't bring me down
Don't you wait too long
Wild wild women
Never slow me down
Wild wild women
Wild wild girls
So get out now
Before it's too late
Don't bring me down
Don't you wait too long
Wild wild women
Got a hold on me
Wild wild women
Wild wild girls
Wild wild women
Make the world go round
Wild wild women
Wild wild girls
Will wild women
Never slow me down
Wild wild women

To lift you up
I'll dry your eyes
Oh when you cry
When you're alone
And nobody's there to take you through the night
Oh when nothing's right
Call out my name
Oh don't be ashamed to say you need a hand
I understand baby
Sometimes the night can be so dark and cold
No one beside you
And no one to hold
Hold on hold on
When you cry
I will dry your eyes
When you fall
I'll lift you up high
You just reach
For these arms of mine
I promise they won't let you go
And I'll make you smile
When you cry
You're always strong
Always got a hand to lend to someone else
Don't need no one else
What about those times
When that heart inside is crying out for love
For someone baby
Someone to lean on when the tears start to fall
Lean on me I'll see you through it all
Just hold on hold on
When you cry
I will dry your eyes
When you fall
I'll lift you up high
You just reach
For these arms of mine
I promise they won't let you go
And I'll make you smile
When you cry
Hold on to me
When you're not feeling strong
Hold on baby hold on
When you cry
I will dry your eyes
When you fall
I'll lift you up high
You just reach
For these arms of mine baby
I promise they won't let you go
When you cry
When you cry
When you cry
Oh baby
Yeah <start> Oh sweet were the hours when in mirth's frolic throng
I led up the revds with dance and with song
When brisk from the fountain and bright as the day
my spirits o'erflow'd and ran sparkling away
Wine Come bring me wine to cheer me
Friend of my heart Come pledge me high
Wine Till the dreams of youth again are near me
Why must they leave me tell me why
Retourn ye sweet hours Once again let me see
Your airly light forms of enchantment and glee
Come give an old friend while he crowns his gay glass
A nod as you part and a smile as you pass.
Wine Come bring me wine...
I cannot forget you I would not resign
There's health in my pulse and a spdl in my wines
And sunshine in autumn tho' passing too soon
Is sweeter and dearer than sunshine in June.
Wine Come bring me wine...
O dolci furono le ore quando di scherzosa
allegria riondanti
Io aprii i festeggiamenti con balli e con canti
Quando fresca dalla fonte e chiara come il giorno
La mia gioia trabocc e fugg tutt'intorno .
Vino Vieni e porta il vino che mi rallegri
Amico del cuore Vieni e brinda a me
Vino Finch i sogni di giovent di nuovo sono vicini
Perch devono lasciarmi dimmi perch
Tornate ore dolci Lasciate che io riveda una volta soltanto
Le vostre lievi aree forme di gioia e di incanto
Venite concedete a un vecchio amico che
l'allegro bicchiere va ricolmando
Un saluto quando ve ne andate e sorriso
quando vi state allontanando.
Vino Vieni e porta il vino...
Non so dimenticarvi la speranza resta mia
Ho salute nel sangue e nel vino magia
E seppur passi troppo in fretta il sole d'autunno
E pi dolce e prezioso del sole di giugno.
Vino Vieni e porta il vino... <start> Lasciami qui
Lasciami stare
Lasciami cos
Non dire una parola che
Non sia d'amore
Per me
Per la mia vita che
E' tutto quello che ho
E' tutto quello che io ho e non ancora
Finita
Finita... <start> The morning sun I squint my eyes
Streets are buzzing full of passes by
Full of life
Conversations coffee cups
The world feels like it's in a rush but I'm
Yeah I'm
Feeling like it's been a million days
Since we came tumbling down from grace
And all my life it's then I see you're face
It's then I see your face
On Liberty road you're standing with a smile
The sparks still in your eyes
The light of nowhere we collide
On Liberty road don't let ourselves forget
The love loss silence says
The perfect place to start again
On Liberty road
I stand and stare and stop myself
From showing you the emptiness I felt
My pain can't help itself
And people pushing us aside
Moments gone and then we say goodbye
Say a lie
Feeling it's been a million days
Since we went down in a blaze
It's not too late to see we've paved the way
So we can find our place
On Liberty road you're standing with a smile
The sparks still in your eyes
The light of nowhere we collide
On Liberty road don't let ourselves forget
The love loss silence says
The perfect place to start again
On Liberty road
Oh woah oh oh oh oh
On Liberty road
Oh woah oh oh oh oh
Found a place to start again
Found a place to start again
On Liberty road you're standing with a smile
The sparks still in your eyes
The light of nowhere we collide
On Liberty road don't let ourselves forget
The love loss silence says
The perfect place to start again start again
On Liberty road <start> Baby I'ma want you
Baby I'ma need you
You the only one I care enough to hurt about
Maybe I'ma crazy
But I just can't live without
Your lovin' and affection
Givin' me direction
Like a guiding light to help me through a darkest hour
Lately I'm aprayin'
That you'll always be astayin' beside me
Used to be my life was just emotions passing by
Feeling all the while and never really knowing why
Lately I'm aprayin'
That you'll always be astayin' beside me
Used to be my life was just emotions passing by
Then you came along and made me laugh and made me cry
You taught me why
Baby I'ma want you
Baby I'ma need you
Oh it took so long to find you baby
Baby I'ma want you
Baby I'ma need you <start> If only my heart spoke the things it would tell me
To hold onto meaning keep on dreaming
If only my heart spoke the things it would tell me
To hold onto meaning keep on dreaming
Everything tumbles oh so quickly to the ground
As I sit here wishing waiting and anticipating
I don't know what calculations I have made
But I know I know I must have something right
If only my heart spoke the things it would tell me
To hold onto meaning keep on dreaming
If only my heart spoke the things it would tell me
To hold onto meaning keep on dreaming
Thinking myself even deeper every day
Contemplating formulating and even dedicating
Meanings to feelings that I can't play advocate
Still I know I know I must have something right
And butterflies deep between my heart and stomach
Tell me I'm alive
Those butterflies deep between my heart and stomach
Tell me I'm alive
If only my heart spoke the things it would tell me
To hold onto meaning keep on dreaming
If only my heart spoke the things it would tell me
To hold onto meaning keep on dreaming <start> Instrumental <start> Alone among the hills and stone
Through summer sun and winter snow
The eagle he was lord above
And Rob was lord below
 years
We lived without hope and without pride
So who will know where they come from
Who raised a torch for those who died
I will be with them
In the summer sun
And the winter snow
They will come and clouds will go
And show that we are proud again
Though all we lost in autumn days
Cannot be born again
Stand here by me
Until the ways of age and youth
Are one and same <start> I'm staying in tonight
Watching T.V by myself
'Cause yesterday my girlfriend wrecked my life
I don't want to explain
There's nothing I can say to you
All I got is this one note she left me
It says that she's not coming back
Not now not then
Next year or ever
If one more person asks me why
I'll try to lie
And then
I will say
She got herself arrested
Got ten years locked away
But that's okay
'Cause the honest truth
I was gonna end it anyway
I'll make up anything yeah truthfully
So no one finds out she left me
She's enrolled in the marines
I try to see her most weekends
But in all honesty she's never allowed leave
She says that she's not coming back
Not now not then
Next year or ever
If one more person asks me why
I'll try to lie
And then
I will say
She got herself arrested
Got ten years locked away
But that's okay
'Cause the honest truth
I was gonna end it anyway
The reason's I don't have a clue
This could easily happen to you
And then you'll know just what it's like
She says that she's not coming back
Not now not then
Next year or ever
If one more person asks me why
I'll try to lie
And then
I will say
She got herself arrested
Got ten years locked away
But that's okay
'Cause the honest truth
I was gonna end it anyway
And I could say
She did a bungee jump rope snapped
She passed away
But that's okay
'Cause the honest truth
I was gonna end it anyway
I'll make up anything yeah truthfully
So no one finds out she left me <start> From a stage in your heart
I can tell that you're far from yourself when you barter your lust for your health
And when you claim it's all a play and you just don't care
I only stare
I'm a director watching you rehearse
You say
Lend me your eyes to evolve from that actor I fight in the dark
where I'm two twins I can't tell apart
But you remember which is which when the wrong man wins
You will hate who you are 'til you overthrow who you've been
How'd you expect your soul to send a whole
patrol if you were too far gone for me to know where to find you
I've wandered out alone into your cold unknown to try to bring you home
So you forgot your way
Well I'm trying to remind you <start> The road is long with many a winding turns
That leads us to who knows where
Who know where
But I'm strong strong enough to carry him
He ain't heavy he's my brother
So on we go his welfare is my concern
No burden is he to bare we'll get there
For I know he would not encumber me
He ain't heavy he's my brother
If I'm laden at all I'm laden with sadness
That everyone's heart isn't filled with gladness
Of love for one another
It's a long long road from which there is no return
While we're on our way to there why not share
And the load it doesn't weigh me down at all
He's my brother he's my brother <start> Verse  I guess it's time to settle all the things. The pain it brings. In my life. They say the love can be the protocol. I can end it all. In my life.
Refrain How many times do I have to explain myself without you in my life How many times do I have to say...
Chorus Get Away I can't control my feelings. Feelings so strong that you'll never know. Give it up The game you play is over. You burned out so hard you lost control.
Verse  Try to stop when you carelessly present to me a fistful of lies. It doesn't matter what you even say. Well those games you play well some might say.


Refrain How many times do I have to explain myself without you in my life How many times do I have to say....
Bridge Get Away from me. Get Away from me. Get Away from me. Get Away from me. I guess it's time to settle  all the things  the pain it brings. SO TELL ME OFF 

 <start> There's nothing like a bad joke to make the enemy choke
Can't excuse the punchline it never works the first time
Look through broken windows and everybody looks cold
Won't ask for a reason but shutting up's not easy
Tell the one about the silver spoon that I can't understand
Tell the one about the silver spoon and I won't understand
I need secondary sight just what's lurking behind
Step on cracks I'm bleeding I never stopped believing
Winter gave me shelter but summer left me freezing
Thirty thousand feet up my head has taken enough
There's nothing like a bad joke to make the enemy choke
There's nothing like disaster to make the heart beat faster
There's nothing like a bad day to make the enemy say
Life is like bad joke it's always making me choke <start> When I was only a kid I hid in the pyramids
Archeologists came so I just changed my name
I had years still to go they were moving too slow
I was here from the start now it's the end of the show
Forever I never thought that this day would come
She's been my everything not anything or anyone
Could kill the time and wait in line for a sign
Textbooks they don't mention me forgotten over centuries
Last call that's on me here's to eternity
 years now she's finally here
If the words come out wrong I'll disappear
Now that I'm older than sin
I think the heavens caught wind
They send a postcard from home
They wanna throw me back in
But I am Omega Man I am out on the lam
I think it's well understood that they don't understand
Me myself and I we're hiding out in history
A specific hieroglyphic message sent to me
To kill the time wait in line for a sign
Final hour nevermore tonight's the night I've waited for
Last call that's on me here's to eternity
And I know she's right for me just the wrong century
 years now she's finally here
If the words come out wrong I'll disappear
To the stars in the sky shining down on the girl
From the beginning of time till the end of the world <start> When's better than now
When's better than now
To come with nothing and deny you
When's better than now
When's better than now
To not believe a thing you say
I've restrained but it can't go down this way
Eye's that lie  hide
Burning time burning time  blaming memory
To return back to a comfort
In an attempt to feel complete
Than tokenize
With lying eye's as if to care
And it's a shock that you leave calmly
As fas as you appear
When's better than now
When's better than now
To come with nothing and deny you
When's better than now
When's better than now
To take blame unscathed and remain
Estranged I can walk straight estranged
With blinders bound
Time
Burning time burning time  blaming memory
Oh I won't let myself be troubled
Or deny I'm part guilty
The road will rise
Blackened skies in time will clear
Though it's a shock now to the body
To be without you near <start> Holding nothing
Scratch the walls just to survive
You can't fathom what that's like
You can listen to you lies
In the end you'll do your time
Holding nothing
Staring at myself again
What I see would swallow you
In your eyes I'll always be nothing
Never did you understand
Never did you give respect
Never did you ever love
Never
Never <start> Take everything out
Just put it back
Right where you found it
You your hands in your jeans
Were you waiting for me
Cause that's how I found you
Every word seems to roll off your tongue
Like honey on my lips
I never thought I could get enough
You took me around the block
But I couldn't stop
I thought it was real
The rush so intoxicated
I look back and I hated that I couldn't tell
I'm lying alone on the floor
Just laughing at myself
How could I ever go back for more
Put everything back
That you took out
Right when it started
Where we started
Where we started
How could I get back what you cant give out again
How could I replace my mother how can I face my friends
How could I look in the mirror and shine the light again
How could I get back what you cant give out again
How could I get back what you cant give out again
Take the deepest breathe
I just it out
I will be stronger
You took everything out
I put it back
Just where you found it <start> Niinkuin roskat lennmme tn ajan tuulessa
Miss itsekkyytt ei saa anteeks pyydell
Ei jaksa uskoo unelmiin mut jaksaa juhlia
Kun hetkeekn paikallaan ei saisi tuhlata
Niin sekaisin kuin voi olla
Kuin timantit katuojassa
Juostaan kilpaa aikaa vastaan
Mut kuitenkaan ei voi voittaa
Kaiken jlkeen tuntuu ett jotain puuttuu
Ei lydy uskoo ett viel kaikki muuttuu
Sattuman syyst renkaat trm reunukseen
Kun maistaa asvalttii niin vasta silloin j paikalleen
Niin sekaisin kuin voi olla
Kuin timantit katuojassa
Juostaan kilpaa aikaa vastaan
Mut kuitenkaan ei voiteta
Hetken aikaa taivasta
Ei meille ole huomista
Kun tyttymys on kertakyttist
Niin sekaisin kuin voi olla
Kuin timantit katuojassa
Juostaan kilpaa aikaa vastaan
Mut kuitenkaan ei voi voittaa <start> Hurry Hurry
I know you can do it
Faster Faster

Always under pressure
Rush it Rush it
Shoot another climber overdose

Fall down a hole and you burn in hell
Striptease yourself against the wall
And watch the shadows begin to fall
Shadows shadows
Shadows begin to fall
Crazy crazy dancing fire
Think of those days that took you higher
Look at yourself through a telescope
Drowned by life well there's always hope
And shadows shadows
Shadows begin to fall
I don't need those shadows
I don't need those shadows
To fall
I don't need those shadows

Look away
Look away
Nothing to loose
left east tenneessee at fourteen
Wonderd to the west
Look away
Look away
Born into death
you fought the salors in New Orleans
You worked the flat boats and walked the streets
Hit Nachdogdes in '
And there you saw the devil for the very first time

Kid dont you know me
We are the last of the true
Drink up drink up
Drink up drink up
Cause tonight your souls required of you
Signed on with a stone mad captian rode on mexico
Look away
Look away
War behold
Jailed with killers one and all but we were killers free
Look away
Look away
Look to me
you saw the lancers 'mid heathen hordes
Bloodstained viels
And costumes of war
Hell ain't that full boy hear me
War is the game and the god we seek


we set out as men of reason armed with navy colts
Look away
Look away
Work paid in gold
but you stood witness to yourself our trial you did betray
Look away
Look away
To judgement day
we killed in the dessert we killed in the streets
We choose what shall and shall not be
We stood with pistols fought back to back
Now you've stood your ground but what ground is that
 <start> Sick of the static I'm sick of your lies
Think you're the baddest bitch think twice
After escape and your grasp I'm coming back to life
Running away running low on time
Counting the eggs in my basket
Terrible tasting and I still believe in magic
Nothing ever happens
Mo more new X's on the calendar
I run all I can
Marathon man
Heading for disaster
Oh it's a miracle I lasted
All I am who I am
Marathon man
Drinking you in spitting out the seeds
Asking nice waiting patiently
As the clock ticks down
I feast despite the famine
Am I a hawk are you a dove
Cold consensual bloodlust
Master masking your love
It's hard to gauge your reaction
But I can imagine it
But I can imagine it
Nothing ever happens
No more new X's on the calendar
I run all I can
Marathon man
Heading for disaster
Oh its a miracle I lasted
All I am who I am
Marathon man
Who's trading places
Who's playing both sides
Old friends again
I'm staying alive
Like pulling teeth
Like telling a lie
Like young and reckless
Like certain deathwish murder suicide
Nothing ever happens
No more new X's on the calendar
I run all I can
Marathon man
Heading for disaster
Oh it's a miracle I lasted
All I am who I am
Marathon man <start> charlie never let it get too hard
just try sticking with the girl you got
other women they would seem secure
they're just as fragile as her
i heard ... a new good space
she found charlie in the strangest place
at the back of the hotel them found
blood on the side of his mouth
is there anything that i can do
all my sympathy it went to you
i heard you were looking so strung out
smiling and tumbling down
the seasons will change
the things you perceive
the company will keep disturbing your sleep <start> Arms legs toes and feet
Lipstick and eyes sneaky peeks
Split tail buttons and bows
Pink butterflies on painted toes
I'm a skin tight boogie baby
Right on top of the world
You're a skin tight boogie baby
Don't you stop baby girl
Yeah everybody wanna hold my hand
Gonna drag me off to a promised land
 baby oh no
 I don't think so
You're just a dumbdumb toad
Who's done run out of road
So you ain't going nowhere with me beat it
Rules are bending still pretending
Mind expanding never ending
Rules are bending still pretending
Mind expanding never ending
Come close closer still
Some boys won't but you know I will
Can I walk you home
Carry your books so you're not alone
I'm a skin tight boogie baby
Right on top of the world
You're a skin tight boogie baby
Don't you stop baby girl <start> Come for me
You come for me
Come for me
Comfortably
You cover me
Cover me
Comfortably
Comfortably
I had a drink
No longer to be free
I want only to see
Four walls made of concrete
Six by six enclosed
See me on video
Oh oh oh
feed me twice a day
I want to fade away
Away
come for me
Cover me
Come for me
Come for me
You cover me
Cover me
Comfortably
Comfort me
and after some time
I know I would go blind
But seeing only binds
The vision to the eye
I lose my voice I know
But I have nothing left to say
It is

No echo in this space <start> Hey man what's it take
To get a drink around here
'Cause I've lost my will again again
This is the part we read about when we were young
How it's so hard to face the truth and give it up
But there's no one left to blame no there's no one left at all
Oh no It looks like I've got a problem
And I really don't know if I will survive
Never gunna make it alive
I'm never gunna make it I'm alive
Never gunna make it alive
And that's fine
Tonight 'cause I can always quit tomorrow
And I'll find my will again again
Is it so bad I only want to live this up
A new city each night it's hard to give it up
'Cause they only know my name
They don't know my shame at all
Oh no It looks like I've got a problem
And I really don't know if I will survive
Never gunna make it alive
I'm never gunna make it I'm alive
Never gunna make it alive
And that's fine
I hope It's not too late
I never know when enough is enough
And every time I come to this place
I get more then just a little buzz
I don't know how much longer before I drown
I don't know if I've gone long enough to put another down
Hey man what's it take
To get a drink around here
Oh no It looks like I've got a problem
And I really don't know if I will survive
Never gunna make it alive
I'm never gunna make it I'm alive
Never gunna make it alive
And that's fine <start> 
I got my mat
I'm gonna take a dive
I might get wet
But I'll still be alive
It only cost  bones
To prove my masculinity
But when I'm riding I'm free
I'm on the waterslide

I'm on the waterslide

I'm on the waterslide
Watch me go
In the shoot
I'll do the loop to loop
But in the end
I'll wind up in the soup
Last one to finish
Has to pay for every ride
But if I'm last you'll let me slide
Chorus
Lead
Chorus
Go down backwards on the waterslide
Lane  on the waterslide
Lane  on the waterslide
I'm getting wet on the waterlide <start>

 <start> White lotus black vanilla lust.
Brand new opus still nobody we trust but us
brave heart lovers.
Why don't we take their hate
and put it in the graveyard
Soon see you in the secret spot at noon.
In an orange haze it's too all these days
so we cooking up some new shit.
You're the fire in my eyes you're my revolution.
It ain't no rocket science it's just give and take.
Copenhagen karma state of mind.
We levitate elevate we escape the gates of hell.
So we celebrate.
You and I like swans in the sky in V shape.
Peace out we great uh huh.
We ain't trying to hurt nobody we just flying.
You're my fire
You're my rain.
You're my shelter from the world when I'm in pain.
You're my river when I need to fall.
You carry me you carry me home .
I went from skating and making songs
in my homies basements
to heavy rotation on radio stations.
Now the whole nation is debating.
Some hating some say it's amazing.
It's the same old song.
Gravitation I need to stay grounded.
I've been patient but finally I found it.
Lost in a place where I didn't belong.
Guidelines and your beautiful eyes brought me home.
When it's right there you gotta hold onto it
make no mistakes.
And I was falling for you slowly like a snowflake.
And I put everything into it baby no brakes.
ow go ahead we can do this like soul mates.
They can have my seat back at the front row
cause tonight we plan seeing that this love grows.
And it give me the chills
let it be forever like strawberry fields.
You're my fire.
You're my rain.
You're my shelter from the world when I'm in pain.
You're my river when I need to fall.
You carry me you carry me home.
I'm giving up all control somebody take the wheel.
Used to be a lost soul oh ooh.
A million dreams out there you give me something real.
Save me save me.
You're my fire.
You're my flame.
Hands up no we don't lie I got a shortcut to the sky.
You're my fire
You're my rain.
You're my shelter from the world when I'm in pain.
You're my river when I need to flow.
You carry me you carry me home.
Keep moving keep keep moving on.
This is where I'm going.
This is where I'm home.
That the whole world feel that I...
Keep moving keep keep moving on.
This is where I'm going.
This is where I'm home.
 <start> I think I've waited long enough.
Our world was once forgetmenots and now I wait another year.
I need you here. I think I've heard this once before but it's not you walking through my door.
Don't bother it now let sleepers lie.
Bygones have all gone by. Forgot what we fought for hard as I might I don't have the will to fight. Forgive and forget whatever was said because we're growing up by the hour. I never would let it go on like it did... all good things have endings. <start> 
Oh I know it's strange
But I think that it's about to change
So I'll take the chance
To get back into the straight again
Heaven only knows 
Heaven only knows 
Heaven only knows 


Now the sun will shine
And I'm gonna work it out this time
And before the light
All I gotta take is one more night
Heaven only knows 
Heaven only knows 
Heaven only knows 
Heaven only knows heaven only knows
Heaven only knows heaven only knows
Heaven only knows heaven only knows
Heaven only knows heaven only knows
Heaven only knows

As the hours go by
I can only wonder why
You can change your mind
But you never change the price
Heaven only knows 
Heaven only knows 
Heaven only knows 
Heaven only knows heaven only knows
Heaven only knows heaven only knows
Heaven only knows 
Heaven only knows 
Heaven only knows  <start> Symbolem twoim nienasycona
W odmetach mysli schronienia szukam
Jak sniaca o wedrowcu droga
Do ciebie wyciagam ramiona
Przed toba krlu granitowy
Inny duch jawi sie
Potega bez tronu
Natchnieniem bez swiatla
Cieniem
Z okruchw godzin noc wyrosla
Necona bladego ksiezyca wolaniem
Ja wybrales i tylko ona
Skronie zdobi wiencem rzanym
Przed toba krlu granitowy
Inny duch jawi sie
Potega bez tronu
Natchnieniem bez swiatla

It freaks you up like ghouls from the dead
I feel like I'm ready to run thru your room
It's gonna be another gingerale afternoon
And I'm feelin' like
I'm leavin' much too soon
Got a pocket full of capsules and some chocolate ice cream
Both make me cool but one makes me dream
I feel like I'm ready to race through your room
It's gonna be another Gingerale afternoon
And I'm feelin' like
I'm leavin' much too soon <start> If I sing you one more song baby would you come along
You can tell me what to do
And if I kiss you one more time baby can you read my sign
You can tell me that were through
And I just wanna be with you
And I just wanna hold you one more time or maybe two
I just wanna be with you
Cause Im a fool Im a fool
And if I pour you one more wine baby can you read my mind
You can play me for a fool
And if I stay just one more night baby will you hold me tight
You can use me like a tool
And I just wanna be with you
And I just wanna hold you one more time or maybe two
And I just wanna be with you
Cause Im a fool Im a fool
And if we made love one more time
Maybe you would change your mind
I just wanna be with you
I just wanna be with you
I just wanna be with you
... <start> Stoney breaks his stride and breaks his heart
Stoney put the sickness in the jar
Stores it in the darkest place he knows
Sadly always keeping it in tow
He sings
Am I ever to feel that free again
Am I ever to feel so light
Am I ever to feel that sweet again
Am I ever to feel alright again
Stoney burns the leaves and hails the smoke
Stoney holds the horn commands the stroke
Parts the water with his finger tips
All the while doubtful of the tightness of his grip
He sings
Am I ever to feel that free again
Am I ever to feel so light
Am I ever to feel that sweet again
Am I ever to feel alright again Again. <start> time to breakout

Well I walked her down to the train
And I said oh baby please walk slow
Well I hate to see you go
I walked my baby down to the train
I know I'll never see my girl again
Well I tried to make her understand
You know I tried to make her understand
I talked to my baby tried to get her to understand
She left me at the station wavin' my hand
Calling goodbye train
Goodbye train
Goodbye train
Goodbye train
Well if I had if I had you close to me
You'd know I wouldn't have to go on in this misery
Well now I'm cryin'
Callin' out her name
Well now I'm cryin'
Callin' out her name
I stood there at the station
You know I was callin' out her name
So go ahead and leave me just the same
Callin' goodbye train
Goodbye train
Goodbye train
Goodbye train <start> I'm sorry I told you those pants made your ass look fat
oops my bad
I'm sorry I tried to borrow condoms from your dad
oops my bad
I called you by your best freind's name
when you and I were fooling around and around
Then I went and made out with that same best friend
the weekend you left town
Oops my bad
It's all my it's all my fault
I never should have let those little things ruin what we had
Oops my bad
I'm sorry I made out with you younger sister
Oops my bad
I swear I thought it was you when I kissed her
you look so similar
Oops my bad
Now seems a good a time as any for apologies
I'm sorry I never told you about my STDs
I've got herpes so do you now
And your best friend and your sister
And your mom and I suppose even you dad
Oops my bad <start> Some say love is giving without an end
I say that's a pretty good place to begin
Some say it's a cigarette burning thin
Here and gone like ashes to the wind
So hold me close
Say goodbye
Break my heart
Save my life
Leave me when the morning comes
I just want to feel something beautiful so I can heal
I just want to feel something terrible something real
I just want to feel.
Spin me round like a beat up 
Stumblin' blindly down this road that we call life
Love seems like a perfect place to hide
Till it goes and leaves you high and dry
So tear me up
Burn me down
Change my mind
Turn around
And hold me when the morning comes
I just want to feel alone so I can feel alive
So leave me in the cold and let me die inside
I just want to feel.
Some say love is a perfect place to hide. <start> It was late I was runnin' good did'nt have a place to stay
I did'nt stop I was feelin' so good thought I'd try to make it to L.A.
There was a girl she said I'll put you up
any time you're passing through
Got my book  and I looked her up
she said I'll be waiting here for you.
I was runnin' with the devil he was by my side.
Runnin' with the devil what a hell of a ride.
Keep your motor runnin' I'm a headin' for you.
Better move on over comin' through
I was hot I was burnin' up the rubber
I was hot I was thinking of my lover.
I was hot I was burnin' up the highway of love.
It was late dawn was comin' up California comin' into view.
Won't be long and I'll wake you up
I can't wait I'll soon be there with you.
I was hot I was burnin' up the rubber
I was hot I was thinking of my lover.
I was hot I was burnin' up the highway of love.
I was hot I was burnin' up the rubber
I was hot I was thinking of my lover.
I was hot I was burnin' up the highway of love.

I want to wish you a merry Christmas
I want to wish you a merry Christmas
I want to wish you a merry Christmas
From the bottom of my heart <start> Don't think you got me girl
Don't think you can tame me and change me
Don't think that it's all because of you
Just because I don't run around
Just because we're forever together
Don't you think of a four letter word to use
So what if I just don't want anybody else but you
So what if you're all that I ever really want to do
I know what you're thinkin' but that doesn't make it true
Believe me baby
I'm not in love
No not at all
What makes you think
You made me fall
I slip but no I'm not in love
What if I just can't sleep at night
I see your face in the starry skies
So high above
But girl I'm not in love
Don't think you got it made
Don't think it's to easy to keep me
Never know it could all just fade away
So what if I just don't want anybody else but you
So what if you're all I really want to do
I know what you're thinkin' but that doesn't make it true
Believe me baby
I'm not in love
No not at all
What makes you think
You made me fall I slip but no I'm not in love
What if I just can't sleep at night
I see your face in the starry skies
So high above
But girl I'm not in love
So if my heart just skips a beat
What if I lose a little sleep
Believe me
I'm not in love
No not at all
What makes you think
You made me fall I slip but no I'm not in love
What if I just can't sleep at night
I see your face in the starry skies
The way you feel
It makes it right
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
No not at all
What makes you think
You made me fall I slip but no I'm not in love
What if I just can't sleep at night
I see your face in the starry skies
The way you feel
It makes it right
I'm not in love <start> Welcome back miss April
Hope you feel all right
You've had a long vacation
From real life
Welcome back miss April
Gravity ain't kind
You lost your Playboy body
At Hollywood and Vine
You sure spent lots of money
Now you wonder why
Your  minutes flew by
Well it must've been hard
And it must've been good
And it must've been nice to be understood.
It must've been fun
'Cause you must have been loved
You must've been beautiful
Open up the paper
Hope that you will find
The young girl from Virginia
You're back in your prime
You should have known that someday
Things were gonna change
And they would forget your name
Well it must've been hard
And it must've been good
And it must've been nice to be understood.
It must've been fun
'Cause you must have been loved
You must've been beautiful
Beautiful
You're beautiful
Welcome back miss April
Hope you feel all right
You've had a long vacation
From real life
Well it must've been hard
And it must've been good
And it must've been nice to be understood.
It must've been fun
'Cause you must have been loved
You must've been beautiful
Beautiful... <start> I've been looking so long at these pictures of you
That I almost believe that they're real
I've been living so long with my pictures of you
That I almost believe that the pictures are
All I can feel
Remembering
You standing quiet in the rain
As I ran to your heart to be near
And we kissed as the sky fell in
Holding you close
How I always held close in your fear
Remembering
You running soft through the night
You were bigger and brighter and whiter than snow
And screamed at the makebelieve
Screamed at the sky
And you finally found all your courage
To let it all go
Remembering
You fallen into my arms
Crying for the death of your heart
You were stone white
So delicate
Lost in the cold
You were always so lost in the dark
Remembering
You how you used to be
Slow drowned
You were angels
So much more than everything
Hold for the last time then slip away quietly
Open my eyes
But I never see anything
If only I'd thought of the right words
I could have held on to your heart
If only I'd thought of the right words
I wouldn't be breaking apart
All my pictures of you
Looking so long at these pictures of you
But I never hold on to your heart
Looking so long for the words to be true
But always just breaking apart
My pictures of you
There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to feel you deep in my heart
There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to never feel the breaking apart
All my pictures of you <start> Little worm
No spine at all
Just feedin' on the crumbs that fall
Down on the floor you grub
An ancient slug
Is far from above
How you live with yourself
Big mouth
Little heart
Talk so loud think you're smart
You're just a bag of guts
And nothing but
The door is shut
This wall ain't coming down
You want what you can't be
Just a parasite suckin' on the side of me
I'm gonna rip you off
And smoke you out
Your time is done here you won't be bringin me down again
This time the doctor's here
To diagnose to make it clear
No quarter be given to the enemy
The parasite
Was livin' off of me
Now that I am healed
The world is right the way is clear
All of the weakness gone
It won't be long 'til I am strong
'til I am strong again
You called yourself my friend
Shoulda never let you in
Now many are my sins but I'm no parasite
I woke up I came to understand it was always you
Takin my power down
The cause was found the truth is out
That dog is in the pound
You want what you can't have
I'm the healthy skin under
You're the puss and the scab
Gonna rip you off and throw you out
Your time is done here you won't be bringin' me down again <start> Well hard times here baby hard times everywhere I go
Lord hard times baby hard times everywhere I go
Now people keep cryin' 'bout hard times
They comin' more and more
Lord I can't even see what poor people is gonna do
Lord I can't even see what poor people is going to do
They keep cryin' about these hard times
And they coming more and more
Well went to the factory this mornin'
Where I had worked ten years ago
Lord I went to the factory this mornin'
Where I had worked ten years ago
And the bossman told me that
They ain't hirin' in here no more
Well was a bluebird baby
Had my trunk packed on my back
Lord if I was a bluebird
Had my trunk packed on my back
I'd fly away from this town mama
Swear I would never come back. <start> Hometown heroes and superstitions
Are what keeps this town's heart beating
You'll never smell sawdust
In the nooks or crannies of its buildings
Nothing ever changes
Nothing ever grows
The boys at public are fixin' to win state
And I'm so tired of the repetition
Gotta get out before it's too late
Nostalgia is this town's religion
That night I went to the tavern
And I had myself a beer
I talked about the future with an old friend
Frankie Last Year
I'll believe it when I see it. Nothin's waiting for you out there
The world gives guys like us a whole lot of nothin'
So stick with the nothin' you're given
Sit back and grab a plate of that old time religion
I knew that Frankie hated this town
Yet we argued through the night
I thought this place had finally got to him
And then I realized
Frankie's got nothing
And if I leave he's got even less
When you live on a steady diet of glory days
Eventually you're gonna have to make more
Sittin' in that tavern with Frankie
I just can't afford
Well that morning I awoke
And I ran wherever my young legs would still take me
Travelin' from state to state
No one would stake me
I had nothin'
And now I have even less
I lived on a steady diet of glory days
Now I need to make more
Sittin' in that tavern with Frankie
Is all I can afford <start> Sixteen and a son of a bitch
Got a gun and a strychnine twist
Little girl on the graveyard shift
Out of control and doesn't give a shit
I don't wanna go down. I don't wanna go down.
I don't wanna go down. I don't wanna go down.
Gonna lose control
So stop drop and roll.
So babydoll don't you lose your touch.
You take it all cause it's never gonna take too much.
Dirty mouth and the look of death.
My tequila coming' from your breath.
Your lips are like a cherry bomb with teeth
Losing control break my sanity.
I don't wanna go down. I don't wanna go down.
I don't wanna go down. I don't wanna go down.
Gonna lose control
So stop drop and roll.
So babydoll don't you lose your touch.
You take it all cause it's never gonna take too much.
I don't wanna go down. I don't wanna go down.
I don't wanna go down. I don't wanna go down.
Gonna lose control
So stop drop and roll.
Alright
So babydoll don't you lose your touch.
You take it all cause it's never gonna take too much.
So babydoll don't you lose your touch.
You take it all cause it's never gonna take too much. <start> Seeing is believing but belief is not like faith
Faith takes chances and faith moves mountains
You will see what you don't see faith prevails where belief fails
It needs no proof baby you don't need proof
You play it safe that's why you're running away
You play it safe 'cause you think it's okay yeah yeah yeah
You play it safe that's why you're running away
You play it safe 'cause you think it's okay yeah yeah yeah
You claim to be searching but just want to be down without a fight
No one seeks God no not one
God will be though belief fails and love prevails where passion fails
No one seeks God no not one
You play it safe that's why you're running away
You play it safe 'cause you think it's okay yeah yeah yeah
You play it safe that's why you're running away
You play it safe 'cause you think it's okay yeah yeah yeah
Our nature plays with fire burning bridges that made us stronger
Don't play it safe fall in love with an honest conviction
Our nature plays with fire burning bridges
Don't play it safe fall in love with an honest conviction
You play it safe that's why you're running away
You play it safe 'cause you think it's okay yeah yeah yeah
You play it safe that's why you're running away
You play it safe 'cause you think it's okay yeah yeah yeah <start> What are you gonna to do
Now that its gone
There's nobody left to call you anymore
Its all coming down on you its all raining down
Did you have anymore to say
You've lost all there is to lose
So what are you gonna do.
Chorus
If your cup is empty
I will fill it up
And I will come around and pick you up
If you fall fall fall. If you fall fall fall.
Now Saturday came and went
Like every day goes. 
Days never last that long
Only those.
You took all my pictures down
''cause your thinking it might make you feel better
To pretend.
But its just the same old room
So what are you going to do
Chorus
Oh ya oh ya oh ya hey

You can't come down
And you won't turn around.
Now that you're gone are you still moving on.
Did you fall fall fall
Chorus
Oh hey oh ya oh ya hey
 <start> Instrumental <start> If I could give you
All the things you've been denied
Would it change you
Would you feel alive
But all that's left now
Are these words that I've been trying to say to you now
And together we'll get by somehow
And all you ever wanted was someone to find
The truth you hide from everyone deep inside
Hey ya hey ya
You're the only one I want
Hey ya hey ya
And I would drown to save you
From the sinking thoughts you feel
And I'll love you just the same
So don't you ever feel ashamed
'Cause we all get tired of fighting
Just to feel like we belong
And I know you feel forgotten
But I've been here all along to say
And all you ever wanted was someone to find
The truth you hide from everyone deep inside
Hey ya hey ya
You're the only one I want
Hey ya hey ya
Hey ya hey ya
You're the only one I want
Hey ya hey ya
And you hide yourself so deep inside
Will I ever see
Ever see you
Now I'm the one who's been denied
But I believe in you
Believe in you
Hey ya hey ya
You're the only one I want
Hey ya hey ya
Hey ya hey ya
You're the only one I want

willst du die Welt verfhren dann mut du erstmal investieren

By the dancefloor
Looking for some
Trick or treat
That was
When I saw her
Looking so good
So good to eat
Body and soul
Keep me going
You'll be there
When the blood is flowing
Only got one life to live
Body and soul
Keep me moving
You'll be there
When the rest are losing
Only got one life to give
Moving
Closer to her
And I asked her
For a dance
Feeling
Kinda lucky
So I thought I'd
Take a chance
Then I reached out
To touch her hand
She pulled me close
And whispered I'm a man  say what <start> Building a bridge across where we live
There are roots in my ground and I stretch across town
I couldn't care less if I live in my head
I've shed all my tears and I'm better than bored
Oh this ship was built to last yeah
Oh this ship was built to last
Move your hands on release me in love
Weather the rain and pleasure my skin
I'm building a bridge across where we live
I've fed all the hurt now I just have to learn
How this ship was built to last
Oh this ship was built to last
See where she goes that's where we go
The breeze takes my hand this ship takes over ooh
Drip upon drop overflowing the cup
Running in light I whip multiple cries
They echo around all the walls of my heart
Yeah worry no more when love leans 'gainst the door
Oh this ship was built to last
Oh this ship was built to last
Oh this ship was built to last
Oh this ship was built to last
Yeah this ship was built to last <start> Dear arise and say it's a honey
All this light that daybreak brings
And the ancient bands that brung me
To the bed where you're sleeping safe
And we had agreed on Henry
Long before a flutter felt
And so it will be till memory
Makes a shadow of ourselves
And the reach and the wrecks and the wrong
All would lead to believe that it's not
But it's foregone
It's foregone
Can it be that this is given
This awaking from a long dark night
Of a soul so on and wizened
Sleep away to set to rights
And the reach and the wrecks and the wrong
All would lead to believe that it's not
But it's foregone
It's foregone
And it's foregone
It's foregone
And the reach and the wrecks and the wrong
All would lead to believe that it's not
And the reach and the wrecks and the wrong
It's foregone
It's foregone
It's foregone
It's foregone
Carry on
Oh and carry on <start> I know your kind
I've seen that smile
I won't let you come back
But you know
Just how to make my world fall back
Just how to make my world turn black
I cannot breath
My mind is blank
You're laughing when I cry
Why did you bring
My happiness so deep inside
My happiness there just to die
Just how to make my world fall back
Just how to make my world turn black
On sunless days we're side by side
Sunless days
Sunless days
My emotional decay
You're hiding now
I'll cut you out
My sky will gather clouds
Where can I go
I try to hide but can not find
I try to leave all things behind
My happiness so deep inside
My happiness there just to die
'Cause on sunless days we're side by side
Sunless days
Sunless days
My emotional decay
I try to hide but can not find
I try to leave all things behind
'Cause on sunless days we're side by side
Sunless days
Sunless days
My emotional decay <start> Shaking like a dog shittin' razorblades
Waking up next to nothing after dreaming of you and me
I'm waking up all alone waking up so relieved
While you're taking your time with apologies
I'm making my plans for revenge
Red eyes on orange horizons
If Columbus was wrong I'd drive straight off the edge
I'd drive straight off the edge
Taking your own life with boredom
I'm taking my own life with wine
It helps you to rule out the sorrow
It helps me to empty my mind
Making the most of a bad time
I'm smoking the brains from my head
Leaving the coal calling the kettle black and orange and red
This kettle is seeing red
I've got a big fat fuckin' bone to pick with you my darling
In case you haven't heard I'm sick and tired of trying
I wish you would take my radio to bathe with you
Plugged in and ready to fall
Shaking like a dog shittin' razorblades
Waking up next to nothing after dreaming of you and me
Waking up all alone waking up so relieved
While you're taking your time with apologies
I'm planning out my revenge
Red eyes on orange horizons
If Columbus was wrong I'd drive straight off the edge
I'm seeing red
I've got a big fat fuckin' bone to pick with you my darling
In case you haven't heard I'm sick and tired of trying
I wish you would take my radio to bathe with you
Plugged in and ready to fall
Plugged in and ready to fall
Plugged in and ready to fall
Plugged in and ready to fall <start> Leroy was a farmer and an honest man
Would have lived in Oklahoma all his days
He just wanted left alone to work a piece of land
But a hard wind come and blew his dreams away
So he headed for the West Coast thought he could not lose
Rollin' down the highway with the dust bowl blues
It's a thousand miles from Broken Bow to Bakersfield
And the highway's paved with heartaches all the way
Leroy drove on lookin' for a better deal
A place a man could settle down and stay
But the police at the state line beat him black and blue
Left him lyin' by the roadside with the dust bowl blues
They say California is a paradise
Hollywood turns night time into day
But up along the San Joaquin those city lights
Might as well be a million miles away
When your kids are cold and hungry wearin' worn out shoes
Standin' in the garden with the dust bowl blues <start> Hey let them do it again yeah
Hey you said you were my friend
Hey turn me upside down Oh
Hey feelin' so down
Hey hey hey hey
You made a fool of me again
Again again again again
Again again again again
Hey I know I made the same mistake yeah
I I won't do it again no
Why Why you slap me in the face ow
I I didn't say it was OK no
No no
You violate a part of me again
Again again again again
Again again again again
Ah ooh
Doot doot yeah doot doot yeah
Doot doot yeah doot doot yeah
Doot doot yeah doot doot yeah
Doot doot yeah doot doot yeah
Hey you had time to think it out yeah
Hey Your weak will won't help her heal her heart
Hey I'll bet it really eats you up
Extending part of me again
Again again again again
Again again again again

Seeking its salvation
With every string of lights
That suddenly appears
Children stare with new found wonder
No one dares to break the trance
Every wish is carefully numbered
And god has granted all a second chance
This day
And all at once
The dream's begun
And as we mark the old year's passing
Strangers greet
On every street
And suddenly there's goodwill everywhere
There's Christmas in the air
On this night
To this light
We see it all again
On this night
To this light
We see it all again
On this night
To this light
We see it all again
On this night
To this light
We see it all again
All again
On this winter night
We still wait for you
And now the time has come
When all the world is one
And as we mark the old year's passing
Strangers greet
On every street
And suddenly there's goodwill everywhere
There's Christmas in the air
There comes a time when we're on our own
Some times in life such a thing must be
But such a thing should not be known
This night
This night
This night
And now the time has come
And now the time has come
And now the time has come
And now the time has come
And now the time has come
And all the world is one
And as we mark the old year's passing
Strangers greet
On every street
And suddenly there's goodwill everywhere
There's Christmas in the air
The final letter that she read
Was from a younger man
It came with a journal
That was all written by hand
He had done something so wrong in life
That he no longer wished to live
But on this night he had a dream
And found that god forgives
If we truly regret how others we have hunt
He will understand
So he took the message from this night
And became a different man <start> We are only brave enough to fight the battles already won for us
And spend more time with our hair than we do our minds
While the girls and the young and the lost
Are kicked off to the side
Our armies in fractions because our kings are so foolish
We will never know true victory and are happy just to survive
To live to dance another day
Still clinging to those golden olden days
While our mouths sweep the mess to the back of our minds
Nothing ever changing as we all grow older
Nothing ever changing as our hearts grow colder
Thats what holds us down
We flap our wings but we never leave the ground <start> I volunteer to drive you home
To spend some time with you alone
But the words don't come that I wanna say
And the precious time just slips away
'Cause you don't know
You don't know that it's me
Who really loves you so desperately
If I could only make you hear I'd volunteer
I volunteer to stop somewhere
And talk about your love affairs
We'll laugh together like best friends
But I hate to see these moments end
'Cause you still don't know
You don't know that it's me
Who really loves you so desperately
If I could only make you hear I'd volunteer
Well I volunteer the love I kept inside so long
I search in your eyes for the moment
But it never seems to come
We talk all night and forget the time
But I never say what's on my mind
And when you're gone all that I wish
Is I'd said it all with just a kiss
'Cause you still don't know
You don't know that it's me
Who really loves you so desperately
If I could only make you hear I'd volunteer
If I could only make you hear I'd volunteer <start> I don't miss you
I don't care where you are now
You're a ghost to me
Left with my taste in your mouth
Take it away somewhere new
I've been used to it
This body is here but I'm bound
When I reawake
I reawake in the waves
In a new realm
Just to strain my film
You might just get used to it
And you'll smile  smile
And I'll descend on these waves 
Slip into the calming waves 
Your known hex
That you strained my world
So I put this gun to my head
And I smile  smile
And down deep
I'll sail along these waves 
Slip into the calming waves 
Deep into the calming waves
We have created now a god
Now I'll reawake me
Never full of myself
I'll grow out of my shell
Slip into the calming waves
Deep into the calming waves
Slip into the calming waves
Deep into 
Right now
Bear witness sleeper
Right now <start> I am limbo waiting on a window
Stuck inside an interval
I know it's unattainable
Covered by a label's name
Labeled by geography
On a dying dark horse
Placing
I am a plagiarist
Feeble picking up a pen
Between a sonic precedent
Any age I represent
Old enough to own the store
The noise I make like an arrogant ingrate
I'm not noteworthy for a loyalty
The forefathers who are redeemed
Most of whom I never revered
Never needed or never even heard
Emulating individuals
Cloning the new originals
Follow us for king land rituals
I am a spokesman for a derivative
Travelling salesman
Selling old narrative
True sounds of liberty
Straining through my voice
Only heard in their code
One noise
Once an introvert
Spewing my entire worth
Regurgitating their words from it
Second coming a second strings
They're personating the real thing
The odd guys that wrote bad songs
A drug addict's dead and gone
Who wrote the song that sold my voice
Forcing to make my choices
And the name they chose for me
And the name chosen for me
Finally here I am
Said to be made again
Posing weathered statues
Standing on old attributes
Getting sick of this
Feeling ridiculous
I'm an overtold joke's punchline
I am limbo waiting on a window
Resonating old song
You're not so long
Scraping the bread off my forehead
At the speed of nearly dead
I never found what never made
To the sound I've already betrayed
It's the name they chose for me
It's the name they chose for me
Follow us for king land ritual <start> I let you down
Let me pick you up
I let you down
Let me climb up you to the top
So I can see the view from up there
Tangled in your hair
I let you down
I have no lid upon my head
But if I did
You could look inside and see
What's on my mind
You could look inside and see
What's on my mind
I let you down oh forgive me
You give me love
Let me walk with you
Maybe I could say
Maybe talk with you open up
And let me through
Don't walk away
Don't walk away
I have no lid upon my head
But if I did
You could look inside and see
What's on my mind
You could look inside and see
What's on my mind
I let you down
How could I be such a fool like me
I let you down
Tail between my legs
I'm a puppy for your love
I'm a puppy for your love
I have no lid upon my head
But if I did
You could look inside and see
What's on my mind
Oh it's you
I let you down
I'm a puppy for your love
I'm a puppy for your love
Forgive me
Forgive me
Forgive me
I let you down <start> You want more than you take away
No one can make you stay
And if it's true there's no night no day
No sense of any other way
You've crossed that line alone
No one can take you home
If your fate to die on the throne
Sit and think what you've become
In between two worlds
Its so easy since you bought it
In between two worlds
How you'd love to join the haunted
In between two worlds
This can't be all that you've wanted
In between two worlds now
You're really alone at last
You're bored and fading fast
And if it's true you'll fall from the past
All you'll have to do is ask
You'll feel but never be
You want and always need
Price you pay for wanting to see
Will you have all you've ever dreamed
In between two worlds
Its so easy since you bought it
In between two worlds
How you'd love to join the haunted
In between two worlds
This can't be all that you've wanted
In between two worlds now <start> Kids standing in the streets
Angry faces and weapons on their feet
Broken step broken bottles on the ground
Tension's thick you can feel it all around
A bottle flies someone falls to the ground
There's a pool of blood and there's fighting all around
Blood runs hot and no one asks why
Runs like the respect that they always get denied
Dead end boys they push out to keep us down
So we stick together so we don't get pushed around
Dead end boys you say but what'd you expect
At the bottom of the ladder you take what you can get
Standing by each other's the way it's got to be
Not turning on your brothers like the ones we always see
No knife in your back every time your back is turned
What you give you get get respect and don't get burned
The papers show the hatred but not the fire in our eyes
Show the violence in the streets but don't ask why
We'll take their lies take their abuse and we deal with it all
Cause at the end of the day we still stand tall
Dead end boys in the streets
Dead end boys weapons on their feet
Dead end boys won't keep us down
Dead end boys won't push us down <start> News travels fast there's an old wreck in the underpass
Wine in a glass and a well traveled bed down the length
And breadth of the motorway down the information highway
I took a ride in an angels heap
Yeah I took a ride and she took me away
To where the hills are steep yeah I took a ride
In the still mind of a child there's a live bird on her shoulder
She could swallow a lie like she's drinking a flagon of beer
I'll never be the same again let the black wheels fly over
I took a ride in an angels heap and she took me away
To where the air was sweet and she made me come alive
In a red vinyl seat yeah I took a ride let the black wheels fly over <start>

  <start> Even with my eyes closed
Funny how I know it's harder it's harder now
Young girl in my
young girl days thinking I could live for always
But like an ocean tide
I'm drawn back inside and I know
Seasons pass like sand inside a glass
and nothing nothing returns
Standing with the friends I've made
I'll race them to the grave
Well who won won the extra days
When you take away the years toll
on the waters wide shallow high and low
In the autumn sky
happy to know I'm going home <start> Well they took some honey from a tree
Dressed it up and they called it me
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby now
Woke up last night half past four
Fifty women knocking on my door
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby now
Went out last night I didn't stay late
'Fore I got home I had nineteen dates
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby now
Went out last night I didn't stay late
'Fore I got home I had nineteen dates
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby now
Well they took some honey from a tree
Dressed it up and they called it me
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby now <start> black on pink
pink on black
she's got a new tattoo on her back
it's alright her mama doesn't know yet
say goodnight gets into bed
climbs out the window and over the fence
it's alright her mama doesn't know yet
oh mallory
you move to fast for me
fast for me 
mallory
she gets in the car and lets down her hair
and drives away in the cool night air
off to where the ocean sings her song
in the corner of her eye
there's a number on a sign
telling her she needs to slow down

i was once like you
trying to get out of this place
and since i made it through
this is what i'll say
live life for today
live life for today
 <start> Greetings beautiful mutants
And how may we be of service
This is NuTra for Devo incorporated
Checking in with the many factions
Of devolutionary humans
Who have waited so faithfully this past year
While Devo gathered its strength
For the next offensive
As many of you can see
The road ahead is filled with danger
It's not nuclear bombs we must fear
But the human mind itself
Or lack of it on this planet
It's time to go beyond the normal thing
It's time to do the super thing
It's time for Devo
There is no question about it
The spud boys are ready with
New songs new films and new approaches
To survival in a world filled with subhumans
Lies lies lies
That's all we get
From those who pretend to know but don't
But once again Devo attempts
To cut through the mental grease and grime
With techniques of positive mutation
Designed to protect you
From the ninnies and the twits
Remember no one knows
So let's find out Devo asks the questions
That help point us all in the right direction
To go forward move ahead
And give the past the slip
It's time to seek out new traditions
We know where the old one's took us
And now we are all here together
So let's go take in the full measure
Of Devo's new traditionalist spirit
The vinyl record and cassette tape
Of Devo's latest musical outpourings
Is entitled simply 'New traditionalists'
To purchase it is not like spending money
But rather it is an investment in the future
In a blow against the empire
This is NuTra for Devo incorporated saying
'Bombs away' <start> So I heard you say
I got your getaway
I'm on a second trail
As clear as crystal
But it was harmless
It couldn't hurt you
Oh you were helpless
I know you'll get through <start> Find the colour
Sight and sound
A new exposure comes around
Anaesthetic for the mind
Hear the voice that soothes away the pain
Television satellite
Conversation running dry
Sending back another text
Holding on to words you might regret
You know you might regret
Cause now I can see that I love all the things
That you do with each day
And it feels so damn good
Every second that passes me by With the blink of an eye
It just feels so damn good
Find the colour find the colour
Looking for something new
A taste of life to pull you through
Defences down your feeling low
A change in feeling comes around again
Its coming round again
Cause now I can see that I love all the things
That you do with each day
And it feels so damn good
Every second that passes me by
With the blink of an eye
It just feels so damn good
So damn good
I read the papers yesterday
They say that the bubble boy's ok
Another day of rain to come
We're sitting back still waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Cause now I can see that I love all the things
That you do with each day
And it feels so damn good
Every second that passes me by
With the blink of an eye
It just feels so damn good
Now I see that I love all the things
That you do with each day
And it feels so damn good
Every second that passes me by
With the blink of an eye
It just feels so damn good <start> You think you don't sync
With the world am I right
It's not because of your
Behaviour right
So I'm not gonna wear your shirt
I'm not gonna wear your shirt
I'm not gonna do it
You think that something
Must break because of you
Just for you to make you feel
Comfortable right
But I'm not gonna wear your shirt
I'm not gonna wear your shirt
I'm not gonna wear your shirt
I'm not gonna wear your shirt
I'm not gonna wear your shirt
I'm not gonna wear your shirt
I'm not gonna wear your shirt
I'm not gonna wear your shirt
I'm not gonna wear your shirt
I'm not gonna wear your shirt
I'm not gonna wear your shirt
I'm not gonna wear your shirt
I'm not gonna wear your shirt
I'm not gonna wear your shirt
I'm not gonna wear your shirt
No <start> My diamond's clouded over where it used to shine like light
And the day keeps running faster
Into the arms of night...
The stitches on the tapestry say
Everything in time
Will find it's way home again
But I'm tired of crying...
No Second Chances
Don't knock on my door
There won't be any answer
I won't be here no more...
This house we had together
Might still be in its place
But the rest of this is much too hard to face
There'll be No Second Chance...
Lovely moonlit hours we spent
Walking on the beach
We'd gaze up at the stars
I swear they were in our reach...
But time... it went on
Minutes... they ran too fast.
Like you they were gone...
Into the past.... <start> All of our fashions have faded
Each generation has been here before
How do we get so jaded
Break this cloud that we're on
Let it rain let it pour
When all is said and all is done
Will we turn our face to the Son
Get back to the root of it all
Jesus is calling us
To the love of a father
Get back to the root of it all
Jesus is calling us
To love one another
This world and all of its treasures
Pull in tied chase the wind
Lose our grip break the fall
Love will transcend through the ages
Darkness cannot survive
With the break of the dawn <start> The Prophet of Pain gave warning
The punishment due
Take heed of the early morning
In time it was seen true
Four winds calling to Zamora
Four winds of deceit
Four winds to the ghost of Tara
Four winds of defeat
Bow down to the thief of all men
The will to be tame
Bow down to the thief of all men
Only one time only one to blame
I led the life unchoosen
Gave the lesson to the broken
I heard the words unspoken
Gave the lesson to the broken
I led the life unchoosen
Gave the lesson to the broken
I heard the words unspoken
Gave the lesson to the broken <start> Holy John lives down by the water
Bathing sinners and he wants your daughter
Telling people that they'd better repent
Telling your daughter it was him who was sent
I saw him down there in a long white gown
Taking sinners and holding them down
John John won't you wash 'em away
Make us ready for the Judgment Day
Take us down and hold us under
Make the Heavens roar with thunder now
The waters are dirty and the reason is
Holy John had to wash away our sins yes he did
He came to town two weeks ago
Didn't take long before everyone did know
Down to the riverside they all did flock
To watch him stand upon the rock yeah
I saw him down there in a long white gown
Taking sinners and holding them down
John John won't you wash 'em away
Make us ready for the Judgment Day
Take us down and hold us under
Make the Heavens roar with thunder now
The waters are dirty and the reason is
Holy John had to wash away our sins oh yes he did <start> Verse
I thought I knew you but how much did I really know
You say youre sorry I tell you words will never show
I pray you dont leave me you say its better to let go
I cant let go
But what about me what about us
What about the love when did it turn to dust
When did you start to feel distant
When did you turn so cold
So many things ill never know
But one thing ill never forget

Your love was never mine how did I keep it
Keeping secrets away from me I was too blind to see

I'm not one of those who can easily hide I
Don't have much money but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
If I was a sculptor but then again no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
Oh I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song
And this one's for you
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
I sat on the roof and kicked up the moss
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind
While I wrote this song
It's for people like you that
Keep it turned on
So excuse me forgetting
But these things I do
You see I've forgotten
If they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words

So love and mercy to you and your friends tonight

For what seems like a thousand years
Only to find that I'm losing my mind
I've been standing to the side
A blackened soul as my guide
Only to see there's a price to be free
You can cast a magic spell
Or pull the sword from the the stone
Until you find the Grail that you've been looking for
You'll always be alone
Where is this Grail I've been searching for
So many years since you've been gone
On all the roads I have traveled on
Where is this grail I've been searching for
I have run so far away from the stench of decay
Only to learn I should never have turned
I'm completely at fault to a pillar of salt
I've been reduced feel the pull of the noose
You can cast a magic spell
Or pull the sword from the the stone
Until you find the Grail that you've been looking for
You'll always be alone
Where is this Grail I've been searching for
So many years since you've been gone
On all the roads I have traveled on
Where is this grail I've been searching for <start>

December st 
People buying up army surplus things
Afraid of what the new year will bring
I live back in the woods you see
YK don't mean a thing to me
I got a shotgun a rifle and a wheel drive
A country boy can survive
Country folks can survive
I can plow a field all day long
I can catch catfish from dusk till dawn
Make our own whiskey and our own smoke too
Ain't too many things these 'ol boys can't do 
We grow good 'ol tomatoes and homemade wine
And a country boy can survive
Country folks can survive
'Cause you can't starve us out
And you can't make us run
We'll survive the new millennium
We say grace and we say ma'am
If you ain't into that we don't give a damn
We came from the West Virginia coal mines
And the Rocky Mountains and the western skies
If the bank machines crash we'll be just fine
'Cause a country boy can survive
Country folks can survive
I had a good friend in New York City
Never called me by my name just Hillbilly
But he was killed by a man with a switchblade knife
For  dollars my friend lost his life
I'd like to spit some beech nuts in that dude's eye
And shoot him with my ol' 
Cause a country boy can survive
Country folks can survive
'Cause you can't starve us out
And you can't make us run
We'll survive the new millennium
We say grace and we say ma'am

Any year any time <start> Sky is clear tonight
Sky is clear tomorrow
A star is out
I reach for one to sparkle in my hand
A star is out
I will not touch you I am just a man
Sky is clear tonight
Sky is clear tomorrow
 And every night I shut my eyes
So I don't have to see the light
Shining so bright
I'll dream about a cloudy sky a cloudy sky
Man was born to love 
Though often he has sought
Like Icarus to fly too high.
And far too lonely than he ought
To kiss the sum of east and west
And hold the world at his behest 
To hold the terrible power
To whom only gods are blessed 
But me I am just a man
 And every night I shut my eyes
So I don't have to see the light
Shining so bright
I'll dream about a cloudy sky a cloudy sky
And every night I shut my eyes
But now I've got them open wide
You've fallen into my hands
And now you're burning me
You're burning me <start> I was thinking about what you said
I was thinking about shame
The funny thing how you said
Cause it's better not to stay
Sure enough if you feel nothing
You're better off this way
Gets to the point where you can't breathe
It's the last word
I can see it standing
So here we are
At the last broadcast
Here we are
Our last broadcast
Sun on faces made us feel alive
The colours of the sky
Southern trees made us enemies
Who knows the reason why
You can't escape yourself
You can't just fall away
It comes to the point when you feel nothing
This is the last time
Cause I can see it in your eyes
So here we are
At the last broadcast
Here we are
Our last broadcast <start> Late Sunday evening
I only just feel like eating
Am I feeling unwell
For what I've done or drunk
Or for someone might tell
I'm gonna find it hard to sleep tonight
I'm gonna find it hard to sleep
There's nothing that's been done that can't be undone
You were sick now you're better
There's work to be done
There's nothing that's been done that can't be
undone
You are sick now you're better
There's work to be done
Everything has been shown to me
With only a magazine for company
Answers in the problem pages
To problems I've been having for ages
Late Sunday evening
There's no way I'm gonna be sleeping
Am I feeling unwell
For what I've done or drunk
Or for someone might tell
I'm gonna find it hard to sleep
There's nothing that's been done that can't be undone
You were sick now you're better
There's work to be done
When I feel my friends have been conspiring against me
I break into their bedrooms and write in their diaries
There's nothing that's been done that can't be undone
You were sick now you're better
There's work to be done
Everything's gonna be alright
I'm gonna find it hard to sleep tonight
Everything's gonna be alright but I'm
I'm gonna find it hard to sleep tonight
Everything's gonna be alright but I'm

Well maybe I'm a weasel
Maybe I'm a liar
Maybe I'm a skinny punk

I've always been this shape
I'm just a teensyweensy thing
Passed on by itsybitsy apes
I'm laying down and I'm playing dead
I ain't fetchin' no stick no way baby
You know that you could train me
You know I'd sit and beg
But you think I'm just a dirty dog
That tried to hump that pretty leg

I ain't fetchin' no stick no way baby <start> I see the lightning in the background a little thunder in your roar

Louden boomer makes you feel the thunder roar
Ear splitting like you never heard before
If you feel like screaming let me hear you say... hey
Nobody's stopping us or getting in our way
C'mon lets scream for the Heavens and shake the gates of Hell

Coming down like a hammer gonna cut you like a knife

If you are a backwards ghost
I will hire you
Brother are you really home
Holy as a blessed worm
Paradise ambassador bring me to your room
And I will throw you rocks today
Watch them pass right through you say
This is not a game or test
We both have done some grieving'
Brother with your vast reward
Treasury who can't afford
Surgeries in innocence abounds
And I have read in paper books
My eyes are glands on twisted hooks
Never have I felt or looked
So sorry for you now
Brother are you trained to spy
One eye open one eye dry
When I die will you be my neighbor
Tell me things I'd like to know
Dress it up from head to toe
Let them know to and fro
From here and tomorrow

The message I received is gone
Are you a phantom detective
Can you read my soul backwards

If you are a backwards ghost

Are you happy

Lost and found with the resurrection
And with tools of deep precision
With the schools of thought complexion

We don't have to make it
Complicated
I said come comma comma comma some more
Kick up the club floor that's what ya came for
Leave your big booty round at my front porch
And leave your big ugly frown back out the back door
Forget your big plans your high ideals
'Cause it's a quicksand for the way you feel
When they put you down the river and they leave you squeal
Come on squeal like a pig how the summer girl feels
We're leaving leaving our machine this very evening
They're programming your head
So stop believing
No need to complicate it's all illusion
Anyways I feel the machine's got boring

A bottle of crisp and a pasta plate
Kick up the love baby down the hate

Money money money got your head in a mush
Now Bush has got the button is he gonna push

What do I see

Yeah she's walkin' back to me
Oh oh pretty woman <start> On a hill long ago on a cold winter's night
In a land far away three kings saw a light
And from heaven it shone like God's God's own crown
And it guided three kings into Bethlehem town
Oh they came bearing gifts and so said each one
Let's call this day Christmas from this moment on
We'll be calling it Christmas in honor of him
The child in the manger or savior and king
We've been calling it Christmas keeping the faith
Knowing the reason we're saving the day
We've been calling it Christmas down through the years
Spreading joy to the world when Christmas is here
Oh a simple belief was the start of it all
A small child asleep on a bed made of straw
Unverified where shepherds and kings
First Unverified this moment would bring
We've been calling it Christmas keeping the faith
Knowing the reason we're saving the day
We've been calling it Christmas down through the years
Spreading joy to the world when Christmas is here
We've been calling it Christmas keeping the faith
Knowing the reason we're saving the day
We've been calling it Christmas down through the years
Spreading joy to the world when Christmas is here
We've been calling it Christmas down through the years
Spreading joy to the world when Christmas is here
Spreading joy to the world when Christmas is here
Spreading joy to the world when Christmas is here <start> I woke up in a stranger's bed
With pins and needles in my head
And the clock ticking off the wall
Oh yeah oh yeah
I don't even know myself
I wish I could be someone else
But I don't have a clue at all
Oh yeah
I'm sinking
You're wading
I'm thinking something's gotta give
Oh
Wake me up
Say enough is enough
I'm dying to live
Something's gotta give 
Pull me out
Of this sinking town
I'm dying to live
Something's gotta give
Maybe I'm a fucking waste
Filling up the empty space
I've been here way too long
Oh yeah oh yeah
I'm feeling like a nervous wreck
Living on my last paycheck
I'm a clich in a song
And everybody's singing along
I'm sinking
You're wading
I'm thinking something's gotta give
Oh
Wake me up
Say enough is enough
I'm dying to live
Something's gotta give
Oh
Pull me out
Of this sinking town
I'm dying to live
Something's gotta give
Someone please come pull me out
From the shadow of my doubt
Wake me up
I'm falling
Oh
Wake me up
Say enough is enough
I'm dying to live
Something's gotta give 
Pull me out
Of this sinking town
I'm dying to live 
Something's gotta give
I'm sinking 
You're wading 
I'm thinking something's gotta give

Pull me out
Of this sinking town
I'm dying to live 
Something's gotta give <start> I'm hot as a fire burning bright I feel as empty as air
There is no sense of balance
In the howling wind that calls to me
I can feel it everywhere but it's invisible to me
Distractions and spirit find me floating in a magnetic sea
The nights are phosphorescent
And the days are beautiful and bright
Until whispering mist it comes falling down on me
Oh there's fire burning
Looking for the magic
In the night time all this
Brings the magic back to me
I'm looking for the magic in the places I remember it to be
It's in the night time alleys
Winding through my deepest memory
And just one simple thought brings the magic back to me
I'm looking for the magic in the places I remember it to be
And just one simple thought brings the magic back to me <start> Engrave me with that bass and shudder
You can't save me
Raving rampant stroking
Knife and voltage burn
Electric shock love
Guard and lock my eyes
Make it hum
Over the river and through the woods
Shoot your honey dove
Breaking the air with those sugarplum arches
Queen born above
Bearing down onto
Not the fruit of you tree
To the end of your root
Flank embankment sewed
My solid rich and rising
Spank and dank Chardot
Snakey bleeding heartbreak
Over the river and through the woods
Shoot your honey dove
Breaking the air with those sugarplum arches
Queen born above
Let me be your salt lick
Let me be your salt sap
Wet lap dream
Knife and voltage churn
Rub in gutter butter
Make it hum <start> Oh to find some peace of mind rest for the soul.
Drifting out invitingly she welcomes me.
Caressed by your hand hearing warm gales low.
I am so relieved.
Sailing out through the waters of blissful love.
The sky as my friend and dolphins calling to me.
I look into you for miles.
The mountains below.
My love ocean eyes so true I'll never forget her.
My love whisper with words from your salt I'll never forget you.
Deep blue the touch of most holy God I'll never forget you.
I'll never forget. <start> Okay
Dreams of Xanadu
Like a rainbow in the sky
I wil lead you to heaven
Close your eyes just let me try
You will listen to my voice
You will listen to my whisper
Sweet emotions fill my love song
And it's only for you
It's only for you
Every song I sing
Is a love song for you 
This song I sing
Is a love song for you 
A love song for you
How I cherish your touch
Believe in you so much
You're my island in the setting sun
And the waves just drift along
How I feel for you
I cannot forget you
It's not hard to understand me
The way I show my love <start> Tell me why I feel so bad honey
TV's flat and nothing is funny
I get sad and stuck in a cone of silence
Like a big balloon with nothing for ballast
Labeled like a bottle for Alice
Drink me or I'll drown in a sea of giants
And tell me Baby baby I love you
It's nonstop memories of you
It's like a video of you playing
It's all loops of sevenhour kisses
Cut with a couple nearmisses
Back to the scene of the actor saying
'Tell me baby baby  why do I feel so bad'
Tell me why I feel so bad honey
Fighting left me plenty of money
But didn't keep the promise of memory lapses
Like a building that's been slated for blasting
I'm the proof that nothing is lasting
Counting to eleven as it collapses
And tell me Baby baby I love you
It's nonstop memories of you
It's like a video of you playing
It's all loops of sevenhour kisses
Cut with a couple nearmisses
Back to the scene of the actor saying
'Tell me baby baby  why do I feel so bad' <start> A mattress and a stereo
Just like I started.
And a note composed with thumbs and phone
On unpacked boxes.
It's so well written
But I won't be sending it.
And I will not forget you
There is nothing to forget.
Oh so there.
Through shiny streets and dirty snow
Blue skies in Ditmas
Oh Brooklyn it's my second sleep.
I damn well did this.
The world got big again.
You could get rid of it.
And I cannot forget you
There is nothing to forget.
Oh so there. <start> Were it not for your nervous nature you would'be become icon you would've become an image healing wounds with words you tell me these are the hymns that free me when I am enslaved you tell me you've written your stories about anyone but me tell me the fable again about when the bell rings and the angel gets his wings or the sod in the mound it's amazing again how you could lie and I would swear it the truth and it's your turn so spit the words out of your mouth into my hands tell me the fable again about when the bell rings and the angel gets his wings or the sod in the mound stories of the quiet moments before each storm long tall tale your getting used to disguising the truth now there's a cold that comes from the distance that's like the waiting for the grass to grow or my rival in this bloody battle a war of holding out and dying all my friends say this riddle may be the answer your stories the riddles set sail fables your long tall tale I wish I could follow long with you spit the words out of your mouth
tell a lie make it come true. <start> Like one hundred whales to the water
You know you had me that corner
You had me the corner
There's are at least a hundred pages I ordered
But before I can read what I wrote about you
What I wrote about you
But tonight I'm thinking of someone else
And I can't help myself
No I can't help myself
Yes tonight I'm thinking of someone else
And I can't help myself
No I can't help myself
There's at least ten times I've spoken to you
And I've never said things that I wanted to say
Things I wanted to say
Things I wanted to
Play it close to the waves cold
'Cause there's always someone you know
That's trying to catch someone out
But the difference between you and me
Is that I know when I shouldn't speak
But you don't know when to hold your piece
Blackjack waistcoat in my face
Farewell to you my lovely
Farewell to you my lonely
'Cause tonight I'm thinking of someone else
No I can't help myself
Can't help myself
Yes tonight I'm thinking of someone else
Wishing around of our ways
Means I've gone on 'bout you all day <start> Min nukuin niinkuin nukuin
sitten en nukkunutkaan
hersink maailmantuskaan
vaiko rakon paisuntaan
Silloin aloin oivaltaa
jostain kuului metakkaa
taasko meidn talonmies
ammuskelee kaappejaan
Kuulin yaikaan
sen Alakerran Orkesterin soittavan
Saivat ne aikaan
niin pirun kovan menon tosi maittavan
Bonzo takoi Cisse nauroi
Jimi poltti soitintaan
Herra Epstein myi jo keikkaa
Bon Scott meni laulamaan
Kuulin yaikaan...
Silloin soitto taukoaa
joku oveen koputtaa
On aika katsastaa
taas uutta koesoittajaa
Kuulin yaikaan... <start> Right outta port angeles like a bullet with no pain
Driving north on the harbor freeway
Up and over st thomas vincent bridge
Making stops as you go everyone you used to know
Flashing your fury gonna lay your enemies to waste
Never hear them when they come
Hear them when they come
Drop 'em to the floor settle every score as you roll
On
Out of the southbay into the san bernadinos
Down into the valley drivin' to meet your connection
Driving with the bass
Never heard you when you come
When you come
Heavy with the bass
Never heard you
Drop 'em to the floor blood pumping thru your vein
Riding off with the score
Driving 'neath the stars you pull over to the side
A voice trickles from your heart
Now the bleeding won't stop
Now the bleeding won't stop
Drivin' you insane
Heavy with the bass
Only a bullet could stop your pain
Never heard you when you come <start> You know I'm sorry if you misunderstood
But your confusion is a bit overdone
I was only in to do good
I was only in to have some fun
I went way out of my way to get this bad
And you still don't get how far
But now I'm Back I'm New
And it's a wonderful thing
But you still don't get how things are...
Not superstition I'm talking hideous kinky
No not religion I'm talking serious OOBE
Not science fiction I'm talking horrible freaky
Yeah all that stuff you don't believe in
Well that stuff is for real
Got myself a change of life
Got myself a change of style
Got myself a new direction
Got myself a reason why...
I just fell right out of my face one day
And took it as a sign from God
And now I'm feeling good
And I'm moving up
And I've got to do it now
Yeah I'm sorry if you misunderstood
But your condition is a touch overplayed
I was only in to do good
I was only in to get it made
I went way out of my way to get this bad
And you still don't get how far
But now I'm Back I'm New
And it's a wonderful thing
But you still don't get how things are...
Not superstition I'm talking hideous kinky
No not religion I'm talking serious OOBE
Not science fiction I'm talking horrible freaky
Yeah all that stuff you don't imagine
Well it's happening to me
Got myself a change of life
Got myself a change of style
Got myself a new direction
Got myself a reason why...
I just fell right out of my face one day
And took it as a sign from God <start> Go down go down you stranger
There's something waiting for you
Angels dolls and honey
Temples and harpoons
You want your main line Jesus
Your want your diamond
You want to pull the trigger
And kill the autumn home
Chorus
So walk believer walk
Straight into the sun
Walk believer walk
Your word ain't ever done
Pray on pray on my brother
Nows the time for due
Black shadow come a creeping
Take the soul right out of you
Can you feel the demons puling
Can you hear the devils sing
Can you taste the poison in your mouth
Feel the weight of his chains <start> I woke up this morning my baby was gone
Woke up this morning my baby was gone
I've been so bad I'm all alone
I ain't got nobody stayin' home with me
I ain't got nobody stayin' home with me
My baby she's gone I'm in misery
Well baby I'm all alone
Yes baby I'm all alone
I ain't got no lovin'
Since my baby's been gone
Allright
Oh baby I'm all alone
Oh baby I'm all alone
My baby she's gone I'm in misery <start> Yeah
I know
How you're always putting down all your friends
I know
How you think your righteousness will make amends
I know
How that little short skirt always gets you in
I know
How you hold me down just hoping I'll say when
And I know you want to own my soul yeah yeah
I don't know why you
Think that you can stand there on your own
I don't know why you
Always find the time to bitch and moan
I don't know why you
Think you're always right and never wrong
But I know why you're gone
I know
How you always get your way with that tease
I know
How you always wanna do just as you please
I know
How you came about those dirty little knees
I know
What you're thinking when you're saying you and me
And I know you still want to own my soul yeah yeah
I don't know why you
Think that you can stand there on your own
I don't know why you
Always find the time to bitch and moan
I don't know why you
Think you're always right and never wrong
But I know why you're gone
I know why you're gone
I know why you're gone yeah
And I know now tomorrow
I've got the sun to shine on me
Yeah
I don't know why you
Think that you can stand there on your own

Always find the time to bitch and moan
I don't know why you
Think you're always right and never wrong
But I know why you're gone
I know why you're gone
I don't like you gone
I know why you're gone <start> As I was slowly passing
An orphan's home one day
I stopped for just a little while
To watch the children play.
Alone a boy was standing
And when I asked him why
He turned with eyes that could not see
And he began to cry.
I'm nobody's child
I'm nobody's child.
Just like the flowers
I'm growing wild.
I got no mummy's kisses
I got no daddy's smile.
Nobody wants me
I'm nobody's child.
No mummy's arms to hold me
Or sue me when I cry
'Cause sometimes I feel so lonesome
I wish that I could die.
I'll walk the streets of heaven
Where all blinds can see.
And just like for the other kids
It will be a home for me. <start> It's time to tell the truth to anyone who cares to know what brought him to this point
Curled up into a ball his thumbs the only things that could break his fall
Almost out of air far beyond repair doomed
The time is wearing thin the technicolor's gone
See it all now in black and white
So now please it's your last drop of air
So now breathe and take your very first
Breath of water
Allow yourself this one
Breath of water
Allow yourself this one
Allow yourself this one last breath
He ran away from home leaving a trace for friends to hunt and find him in the snow
But a scent is not enough and we're barely sure he's strong enough to survive the cold
Almost out of air far beyond repair doomed
The time is wearing thin the technicolor's gone
See it all now in black and white
So now please it's your last drop of air
So now breathe and take your very first
Breath of water
Allow yourself this one
Breath of water
Allow yourself this one
Allow yourself this one last breath
I'd rather spare the truth from anyone who cares to know exactly how we found him
But it's time to share the truth with anyone who cares he goes out too deep alone
So now
Breath of water
Allow yourself this one
Breath of water
Allow yourself this one
Allow yourself this one
Allow yourself this one last breath
Water breath of water breath of water water water water breath of water <start> Bila mama Kukunka

all the years you've lived
you could be someone else
and all the times you've been alone
all the lies you told
now haunt your perfect spacious home
and now there's no time
and now there's no time
it's not such a crime
to say you don't love her
all those awkward silences over breakfast
as you fumble with your toast
you know the magic's gone for good
little things get on your nerves
that never worried you before
and now there's no time
and now there's no time
it's not such a crime
to say you don't love her

'Cause I have torn about everyone
Who reached out for me
I am sorry I have left you a broken man
But if I had a heart I'd cry out loud but I can't
Baby don't you walk away
I have been so alone
Lighten up my night and day
Here comes the sun today
There will be no remorse at all
Come what may
Find us a very crowded place to stay
We'll be making out on the dance floor
Have sex do some drugs yeah lets rock n roll
Today heeey ey

Tell me where and when
We'll meet again
Cause I just begin to long for you
And the flesh you wear
And everything will happen
If you only give me the word
Cover up my eyes because the sun is
Shining too bright
Today there will be no remorse at all
Come what may
Find us a very crowded place to stay
We'll be making out on the dance floor
Have sex do some drugs yeah lets rock n roll

I seduced this gorgeous model chick  With my fame and not my charm  I headlined last years Lilith Fair  Just me and my brassiere  Sang songs for sweaty college girls  Spin's artist of the year  I even wrote a song with that guy from the Fugees  Got doper rhymes than Master P  I went cruising with Dr. Dre  He tried to kiss me thought I was gay  And everyone from Detroit to Yellowstone  Knew my face from the cover of Rolling Stone  I never thought it would end like this  People act like I don't exist  I went from Alist to blacklist  Just another casualty  Another answer on Jeopardy <start> Will you take me in and care for me
I don't think I can go on
It seems everyday in everyway
It gets harder to get things done
I can't be what they think I should be
And I don't believe that's wrong
But I need some help with all this time
That lingers right along
I need some help with all this time
That lingers right along <start> Good things come to those you wait
They say patience is a virtue
But all I've got is the time it takes me to hurt you
I feel so little I need so much without something to believe in
Now all I've given is all I've got
That's all he had to say
Give me all give me some give me anything you want
You know love will only get you through the night
Give me all give me some give me anything you want
You know love will only get you through the night
She's not asking much from me
So I don't ask no questions
If that's the way it's gonna be
Then I call no objections
We're two that feel the same
Can't handle situation
All you've given is all you gain
So all I gotta say is
Give me all give me some give me anything you want
You know love will only get you through the night
Give me all give me some give me anything you want
You know love will only get you through the night <start> I love the way you walk

YOU CAN SMELL SOMEONE'S ROTTING
DEATH COMES BEHIND YOU
THERE'S NOWHERE TO RUN
DISMEMBERED YOUR REMAINS AND NOBODY CARES
FACTORY OF MURDER IS THIS ROOM 
YOU CAN SEE SOMEONE'S SKULL THAT BOILED
CASKET AROUND YOU AND NOBODY KNOWS
RUPTURED YOUR MEMORY HOLD YOUR BREATH
FACTORY OF MURDER IS THIS ROOM 
WELCOME TO MY SLAUGHTER HOUSE
WHERE THE BLOOD FEAST HAS BEGUN <start> Ci alzammo che non era ancora l'alba
pronti per trasbordare
dentro un satellite artificiale
che ci condusse in fretta
alle porte di Sirio
dove un equipaggio sperimentale
si preparava
al lungo viaggio.
Noi
provinciali dell'Orsa Minore
alla conquista degli spazi interstellari
e vestiti di grigio chiaro
per non disperdersi.
Seguimmo certe rotte in diagonale
dentro la Via Lattea.
Un capitano del centro impressioni
colto da esaurimento
venne presto mandato in esilio.
Mi preparavo
al lungo viaggio
..in cui ci si perde.
Seguimmo certe rotte in diagonale
dentro la Via Lattea. <start> She's the one who burned me at the stake
Sweet girl
Lacked by vision kneeling on her bed
Dark cloudy eyes foreseeing obsession
Beautiful and willful
It seems those years
I've been lying on a spellbound bed
Haunted disappointed down
Like a daemon obsessed waiting for dawn
I've been writhing feeling her scent
It seems the night has brought her unrest
She was kissed caressed loved
Sweat screaming in mourning
I've been writhing feeling her scent
I've been writhing feeling her scent
I've been writhing feeling her scent
I've been writhing feeling her scent
She was a swear she was my girl
And I was that saint Lucifer
Beautiful and willful
She's the one who burned me in that stake
Dawning for a sweet girl no no no no
She was a swear she was my girl
And I was that saint Lucifer
Beautiful and willful
She was the one who burned me in that stake
Dawning for a sweet girl no no no no
Lacked by vision kneeling on her bed
Dark cloudy eyes foreseeing obsession
Dawning for a sweet girl no no no no
Haunted disappointed down
Like daemon obsessed waiting for dawn
Haunted disappointed down
Like daemon obsessed waiting for dawn
Dawning for a sweet girl no no
Sweet girl for a sweet girl <start> I can't stop can't stop thinking
About you at all
I called you up to come on round tonight
You wouldn't give a straight answer
But you wouldn't say no
Even though you're going with him
Here comes the night
Lead me on
In your veins
Warm inside
Heart beats fast
Lights are low
I want you
Let it go
You arrive with cool in your eyes
And explain to me
How he makes you feel inside
So safe secure
Later on as the night is falling
You bring me on with violent words
Desire and being young
Here comes the night
Lead me on
In your veins
Warm inside
Heart beats fast
Lights are low
I want you
Let it go <start> Now blue ain't the word for the way that I feel
That old storm brewing in this heart of mine
Someday crazy arms will hold somebody new
But now I'm so lonely all the time
Crazy arms that needs to hold somebody new
While your heart keeps sayin' your not mine not mine
Not mine not mine my troubled minds grows blue
To another you'll be wed but now I'm so lonely all the time
Now take all those precious dreams I had for you dear
And take all that love I thought was mine
Some day your crazy arms will hold somebody new
But now I 'm so lonely all the time
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
While my yearning heart keeps saying your not mine
Not mine not mine not mine my troubled mind goes blue
To another you'll be wed but now I'm so lonely all the time <start> I sat last night at midnight
Blinded by the daylight.
Sitting at the window thinking about you and me .
I see our lives together.
I see our love forever.
I picture in my heart every night how it's gonna be.
Yeah Lord now
Chorus
I see only sunshine
For you and me for years to come now.
I can see it can't you see it too
We can share the nighttime
'Til the morning's shining squints our eyes now.
Years of loving me and years of loving only you.
I catch myself in daydreams
Thinking about the hard times we've seen.
We've been through it there ain't nothing but good times ahead.
I walk into walls forget things
Forget too match my clothes my ears ring.
It circles in my head did you listen to what I said now
Yeah Lord now
Chorus <start> He's five feet two and he's six feet four
He fights with missiles and with spears
He's all of thirtyone and he's always seventeen
He's been a soldier for a thousand years
He's fighting for Britain and he's fighting for Iraq
He's fighting for the USA
He's fighting for the Russians and he's fighting for Japan
And he thinks he'll put an end to war this way
He's fighting for democracy he's fighting for the reds
He says he's for the peace of all
He's the one who must decide who's to live and who's to die
And he never sees the writing on the wall
But without him how would Hitler have condemned him at Le Val
Without him Caesar would have stood alone
He's the one who gives his body as the weapon of the war
And without him all this killing can't go on
He's the universal soldier
He really is to blame
His sword has come from far away no more
They come from you and me
And brothers  sisters can't you see
This is not the way we put an end to war <start> when i was young i knew everything
and she a punk who rarely ever took advice
now i'm guilt stricken
sobbing with my head on the floor
stop a baby's breath and a shoe full of rice
i can't be held responsible
cause she was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
she fell in love in the first place
for the life of me i cannot remember
what made us think that we were wise and
we'd never compromise
for the life of me i cannot believe
we'd ever die for these sins
we were merely freshmen
my best friend took a week's
vacation to forget her
his girl took a week's worth
valium and slept
now he's guilt stricken sobbing with his
head on the floor
thinks about her now and how he never really
wept he says
i can't be held responsible
cause she was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
she fell in love in the first place
for the life of me i cannot remember
what made us think that we were wise and
we'd never compromise
for the life of me i cannot believe
we'd ever die for these sins
we were merely freshmen
we've tried to wash our hands of all of this
we never talk of our lacking relationships
and how we're guilt stricken sobbing with our
heads on the floor
we fell through the ice when we tried not to
slip we'd say
i can't be held responsible
cause she was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
she fell in love in the first place
for the life of me i cannot remember
what made us think that we were wise and
we'd never compromise
for the life of me i cannot believe
we'd ever die for these sins
we were merely freshmen
we were merely freshmen
we were only freshmen <start> If I said I loved you would you still be here
Or would you still be crying for the yesteryear
Caught upon the melody of good old Johny Cash
You got me feelin like I am living in the past
I feel kinda silly
I feel really silly
'Cause you jerked me around like you wanna kill me
I feel kinda stupid
I feel really stupid
Because I've been deceived be the man himself Cupid
Lookin for a time or a place to deface myself or you what can I do
Feelin in the dark for a switch or a bitch what I cannot find but
which is which
All in all it's none in none
Going in the eye of everyone
Peering through a glass of no rewards
I am not sure but on my Lord <start> 
Now the closets are empty used to be full
Empty lover standing where once there was a soul
Touch down come down
You can lose your footing when you chase after a dream
Emotions forming gateways not as open as they seem
chorus
All I want is some body to take me in their arms say 'sall right
I have wanted that all a long don't worry I won't hold my breath
Why waste time and money what we know is the truth
Funny all of our lives when they blast through the roof
Come down touch down
A body at rest stays at rest all decided long ago
Nothing in the language how well I know
chorus <start> If I knew being here with you today
Would mean being alone tomorrow.
I would gladly trade all of my tomorrows away
For a moment with you.
Brown eyed blues
You can find yourself another fool.
Say yeahyeahyeah
Can you lookcan you look into my eyes
Or has your heartsaid has your heart gone blind
Can you lookcan you look into your own
And find the safe place to hide.
Brown eyed blues
You can find yourself another fool.
Say yeahyeahyeah
Why be with strangers
When you can be with your friend.
If you're ever lonely
You know I'm lonely too
And i will stay lonely until I'm again with you.
I said brown eyed blues
You can find yourself another fool.
Say yeahyeahyeah
I said brown eyed blues
You can find yourself another fool.
Singing brown eyed <start> It's automatic when I
Talk with old friends
The conversation turns to
Girls we knew when their
Hair was soft and long and the
Beach was the place to go
With suntanned bodies and
Rays of sunshine the
California girls and a
Beautiful coastline
Warmed up weather
Let's get together and
Do it again
With a girl the lonely sea looks good with your life
Makes your night times warm and out of sight
Been so long 
Been so long 
Been so long

He comes from a wasteland where stones misdeed into the night
they pretend they feed him then shoot him down in the
search light
They're putting words in your mouth so you talk like them
dressing you up in a straight jacket
Wearing his straight jacket taking his pay back in scars
she lies beside him and tells him that life's not too hard
They're putting words in your mouth so you talk like them
dressing you up in a straight jacket
Caught by the fear and the anger of all you despise
wanting the feeling of eden you've learnt how to die

He comes from the wasteland
Where stone streets lead into the night
They greet him and feed him
Then shoot him down in their searchlight
They're putting words in your mouth so you talk like them
Dressing you up in a straight jacket
Wearing his straight jacket
Taking his pay packet scars
She lies beside him and
Tells him that life's not too hard
They're putting words in your mouth so you talk like them
Dressing you up in a straight jacket
They're putting words in your mouth so you talk like them
Dressing you up in a straight jacket
Caught by the fear and the
Anger of all you despise
Wall in the feelin' revealing
You've learned how to die
They're putting words in your mouth so you talk like them
Dressing you up in a straight jacket
They're putting words in your mouth so you talk like them
Dressing you up in a straight jacket
Straight jacket  <start> Tonight I'm yours completely sharing you with pain
Guilt and remorse come with me
They're dying to play
Take me down with you
This feels so far from perfect
I'll try and pretend this is my heart
Be careful it's so hard to mend
I'm down for whatever if you're down
For the same take me take me take me anywhere you wanna go
She'll never know
Take me take me tell me everything that I wanna know
Then I'll let you go down
With you I can't go on pretending
You don't know her name
We've gone too far to turn back now
I might as well stay if you're down for whatever
I'm down for the same
Take me take me take me anywhere you wanna go
She'll never know
Take me take me tell me everything that I wanna know
Lemme go I think I'll wait too long
Wanna know
Let me go
Just take me down with you
Take me take me take me down with you
Take me take me take me down with you
Take me take me take me down with you
I play guitar and I'm better than you
My name is James James
He comes from Houston and so do we too
His name is James James
Woah woah woah
He's got something to say James James <start> I moved in that very day
The room was small but I liked it anyway
You watched TV while I dreamed through my mind
And the pregnant girl was busy all the time
September and October passed me by
I decided to go home for a while
I got a lift with an old friend of mine
I wanted her but still she reminded me on the way
So when I got home I went to see Mum and Dad
They asked was I ok was I happy enough
And I smiled and said that I was
A few days later I decided to leave
I couldn't find anyone who could take me
The only thing I could do was take a bus
So at half six I left to get the late express
I boarded the bus with the clean washing over my back
I said I sat with a girl dressed in black
We talked and smiled most of the way
Till the jealous boyfriend angrily led her away
Then when I reached the house there was a party on inside
My friend came to the door took my bags from my hands
And welcomed me in from the night
As I was walking through the happy house on halloween night
My friends were all around and my heart was glad and my life felt actually
alright x <start> Lyrics are as follows
I've done too much of some things
And not enough of others
Just like all life lovers
I've changed and changed
And changed and changed
From one thing to another.
I've had complicated dealings
With complicated feelings
And I've cut and bruised and torn.
I made blinds on the windows of my mind
with the time that my back once wore.
I'm a single person in this universe
And I am here to say to you
On the day that I die
I'll just give a smile
And fly into the blue
Cause we're all just
Protons Neutrons Electrons
That rest on a Sunday
Work on a Monday and someday soon
We'll be singing the old tunes
Zipadeedoodah Zipadeedoo
I'll be sitting on the porch with you
Then I'll die and I'll
Fly off into the blue
Some night I see the world with its winds and its whirls
And I feel undefeated
But every day I see the girl with the strawberry curl
And I'm too shy to meet her.
Some nights I go to bed
There's a ghost in the air above my head
And I tremble.
Sometimes I eat KFC
Other times I give up meat
And I just eat lentils.
I'm a singe soul on this big blue ball
And I am here to sing a song
About the day that I was born
Till the day that I'll be gone
And the song won't last for long

CHORUS
And enemy is a remedy to a malady in your melody
If you're strong not brittle.
And a friend is a friend
Is a friend to the end and it's AH so simple
A man is a man and a woman is a woman
But the times we are living in demand
That a man can change from a man to a woman
And a woman can demand to be a man.
We're just flesh with socks and locks and frocks
And I am here to say to you
On the day that I die I'll just give a smile and fly into the blue...
Cause we're all just
CHORUS
CHORUS AGAIN <start> Hold that train conductor
Please don't let that engineer start
Hold that train conductor
Please don't let that engineer start
Well I wanna ride your train this morning
Just to ease my achin' heart
Yes for the last few mornings lately
Before I get out of my bed
Yes for the last few mornings lately
Before I get out of my bed
Well I hear your whistle moanin'
And it almost drives me out of my head
I'll pay my fare when we starts rollin'
All your money's right here in my pants
I'll pay my fare when we starts rollin'
All your money's right here in my pants
Well I know I should back and buy a ticket
Yes but I'm afraid to take the chance
Oh don't stop this train conductor
Till this old state is out of sight
Yes don't stop this train conductor
Till Mississippi is out of sight
Well you know I'm going to California
Where I I know my baby will treat me right <start> The number in nations
The god in their hearts
The justice in swine
The devil in god
Vote
This long hand that breaks our back
Still casting shadows on all that we see
Unjustified mercy killing is just a feeling
To keep our numbers from being free
Prison for praise is not worth thinking
Sin is still in and our ballots are shrinking
So unleash the dogs  the only solution
Forgive and forget fuck no
I'm talking about a revolution
The prophet man's got a needle in his hand
Draws his dreams from your soul  bleeding minds into sand
The year of the fear has arrived decades too late
And our right to stand and fight is now solely sealed in fate
Prison for praise is not worth thinking
Sin is still in and our ballots are shrinking
So unleash the dogs  the only solution
Forgive and forget fuck no
I'm talking about a revolution
One last chance mission with a vision
'Cause our lives are just cards in their stack
Our time is short but theirs is shorter
How much longer can they hold us back
Prison for praise the obvious answer
Once had power mad living disaster
Don't fuck with me 'cause I'm on the freedom train
That bears no name this time
I'm voting with a bullet
The view they once knew made our nooses too tight
This justice in swine
The devil in god
So god bless my soul I've got total control
And the crosshairs lined up dead in my sight
I'm voting with a bullet <start> Here I am again in this mean old town
And you're so far away from me
And where are you when the sun goes down
You're so far away from me
So far away from me
So far I just can't see
So far away from me
You're so far away from me
I'm tired of being in love and being all alone
When you're so far away from me
I'm tired of making out on the telephone
And you're so far away from me
So far away from me
So far I just can't see
So far away from me
You're so far away from me
I get so tired when I have to explain
When you're so far away from me
See you've been in the sun and I've been in the rain
And you're so far away from me
So far away from me
So far I just can't see
So far away from me
You're so far away from me <start> x and counting down in one after the other
They'll go running up and down the road angry as their mothers
Over senseless acts of selfishness on made up English oceans
And made up English stomach contents tied to senseless notions
Once you grab them by the pride their hearts are bound to follow
Their natural fear of anything less manly or less natural
Like gunless sheriffs caught on lonesome roads and live to tell it
How hard it is for meaner men without the lead to sell it
Only simple men can see the logic in whatever
Smarter men can whittle down till you can fit it on a sticker
Get it stuck like mud and bugs to names that set the standard
They'll live it like it's gospel and they'll quote it like it's scripture
x and counting down in one after the other
They'll go running up and down the road angry as their mothers
Over senseless acts of selfishness on made up English oceans
And made up English stomach contents tied to senseless notions
Its no matter if they dress real nice and sit up straight and stupid
And say their prayers in quiet ancient tongues
They're no different that the ones who close their eyes
And fall down to the ground
And twitch just like their nerves have come undone
So be it if they come to find out feeling good's
As easy as denying that there's day or night at all
Til what it takes to feel a thing seems so far out of reach
They just claw their skin and grind their teeth and bawl <start> Instrumental with tim doing some cool kurt cobaintype growls. <start> Come in tune.

It's a place that I know well
It's a little place that's growing
It's a little space like Hell
Goodbye mom
Goodbye dad
Goodbye brothers
And my sisters
So what makes you think
I am coming back
This makes me feel so fucking bad
What makes you think I'm coming back
This makes me feel so fucking bad
Yeah
I'm going to Hell
Yeah
I'm going to Hell
There's a little fear I'm showing
I'm not so tough anymore
I feel a sickness and it's growing
I'm not so proud anymore
Goodbye mom
Goodbye dad
Goodbye brothers
And my sisters
So what makes you think
I'm coming back
This makes me feel so fucking bad
What makes you think I'm coming back
This makes me feel so fucking bad
Yeah
I'm going to Hell
Yeah
I'm going to Hell <start> See that girl over there by the jukebox
Hear the lonely song that she plays
Well you ask me if I know why she's crying
I know a little I made her that way
Well you ask me if I know why she's lonely
And why her head is dizzy from wine
And did I know she was everybody's baby
I know a little for once she was mine
Well I knew her when she was happy
And I love you was all she could say
But a lot of times I let her get lonely
I know a little I made her that way
 steel 
I knew her when she was happy...
I know a little I made her that way <start> Down to the glen where the roses twine
Lie in the grass watch the time go by
The hum drum midafternoon sun
Only his mothers only son
Black Jack tarmac dirt dust trap
Sister certain wrapped in rags
Whispers words of unwished schemes
Steals a smile from the scorpions dream
She sings the mourning
She sings the mourning
She sings the mourning
In the quiet night
She said don't worry
She said don't worry
She said don't worry
We're out of sight
She sings the mourning
In the quiet night
Blood red love not temptress eyes
Cuts right through the family ties
Lighthouse lights the locust nest
Salem's site invites incest
Back to the glen where the roses twine
Treacle tarts and turpentine
Patron saint of guillotines
A secret's safe when noone sees
She sings the mourning
She sings the mourning
She sings the mourning
In the quiet night
She said don't worry
She said don't worry
She said don't worry
We're out of sight
She sings the mourning
In the quiet night <start> R. Williams
A widow dreams of her fallen angel
The broken branch an empty manger
A widow dreams of her life with the savior
Falls to her kneew and begs for more
But the fields are filled with nightmare prophecies
Shadows cast upon her fading hope to be
A virgin widow walks through lanes of memory
Invokes the past that it might save her
An aging widow weeps and turns towards the wall
Voices shout out names of those she can't recall
A widow dreams of sons of daughter
Endless nights spent in silent slaughter
Endless nights sent in silent slaughter
A widow dreams of love lost or thrown away
Searching for the light of the day that might relieve her
A widow dreams of her fallen angel
A broken heart no memory can save her
A widow looks upon her eyeless saviour
Begs for the strength to end it all
But the fields are filled with nightmare prophecies
No hope of finding mercy in theis entity
A virgin widow lays down amongst the leaves
Invokes the past but it can't save her
An aging widow weeps and builds another wall
Voices silent now no screams or mocking calls
Endless nights spent twith thoughts that always taunt her
Endless nights spent with thoughts that always taunt her
A widow fails to find her love and drifts away
Turning out the light of day that did deceive her
A widow's dream comes to a close
A widow's dream <start> They met up in Rockport
Where the moon rose early and the days were short
And the miles between were still too many to mention
The Blue Ridge rides at starfall
Oh the epic scope of it all
Those days before the doubleedged blade of contention
CHORUS
Sometimes passion's like a cigarette
Burning clean out 'fore it really takes wing
But you always fly high for a little while
When you think you've got the real thing
He moved in for the long haul
The ' Hog the guitar and all
They got an apartment a conversation piece
But the big spark dimmed substantial
You know it's always financials
That give the portrait of happiness its nasty crease
CHORUS
Sometimes they'd find common ground
Some days he'd run to where he couldn't be found
A ride in the pines can truly inspire
The need for a soul to come clean from a waning desire
He laid there deciding
What side of a man should come out of hiding
While she laid there the key to his conventions
She had brought some changes
But how could he pretend with all these empty pages
And the miles to go still too many to mention
CHORUS
Do you think you got the real thing <start> All I want is a room with a view
A sight worth seeing a vision of you
All I want is a room with view ohoh
I will give you my finest hour
The one I spent watching you shower
I will give you my finest hour oh yeah
All I want is a photo in my wallet
A small remembrance of something more solid
All I want is a picture of you
Picture this a day in December
Picture this freezing cold weather
You got clouds on your lids and you'd be on the skids
If it weren't for your job at the garage
If you could only ohoh
Picture this a sky full of thunder
Picture this my telephone number
One and one is what I'm telling you oh yeah
All I want is  vision
A total portrait with no omissions
All I want is a vision of you ohoh
If you can picture this a day in December
Picture this freezing cold weather
You got clouds on your lids and you'd be on the skids
If it weren't for your job at the garage
If you could only ohoh
Picture this a sky full of thunder
Picture this my telephone number
One and one is what I'm telling you
Get a pocket computer
Try to do what you used to do yeah <start> Sometimes I feel so lost S.O.S. all my lines are crossed. I bite off more than I can chew. It's killing me its killing you there's nothing that I'd rather do. It's got me now its holding me. A sign of something good a sign I thought I'd never see. I try to keep it in my head. We'll you can kick my ass and burn your books but it won't change a word I've said. I guess I should have seen it coming. It's in the smile on his face. Did you really think that this would be so easy I think you made a big mistake. What went so wrong Every action has reaction in this fucked up world that you created. Now you're head is so full of negativity and shattered dreams. A world of noise you end up hating. It's got me now it's holding me. A sign of something good a sign I thought I'd never see. I try to keep it in my head. We'll you can kick my ass and burn you're books but it won't change a word I've said. I guess I should have seen it coming. It's in the smile on his face. Did you really think that this would be so easy I think you made a big mistake. What went so wrong it's been too long. So just take it on the chin. It's who you are and what you do. Not who you were or what you have been. There's just one thing you should know. That I still care to work it out don't think about it let it go. <start> Child you're talking of freedom
Painted on your garden wall
It's not there at all
Child you're talking of wisdom
You say wisdom is a golden rule
You ain't no fool
But you don't know who it is
Who calls you name
In the light of the golden moon
You don't know who it is who brought you here
And chained up your heart
So soon
Child you're life is a fairytale
And it's not the same
And the clouds
You're hiding behind
In your misty mind have disappeared
Like a sailor far from the shores of your dreams
And far from the love of your home
Sailor lost on your own misty seas
And the chains on your heart baby
Might be my love
Might be my love
It's so confusing
And you feel that you're loosing yourself
But there over the mountain
You thought you'd never have to climb
There's a road
Reaching and stretching
To the corner of your mind
Like a river casts aside the dust
And grows and grows as it flows
The feeling deep inside of you
Must break like a dam
So set you free
So set you free
So set you free. <start> Supper time in the hole
Supper time in the hole
I shame my family shame my home
Supper time
Old Saint John on death row
He's just waiting for a pardon
Old Saint John on death row
He's just waiting for a pardon
Old Saint John on death row
He's just waiting for a pardon
Old Saint John on death row
He's just waiting
All the white boys in the stay pressed slacks
They're home for the summer from college
Staying out late getting rowdy at the bar
And looking for trouble uptown
They come up my block 'bout  or  of them
Smashing their bottles in the gutter
Yelling all kinds of obscenities
About woman and God and law
Another supper time in the hole
Supper time
I shame my family shame my home
Supper time
A young girl turned the corner with a clerk dress on
That girl was my sister
Just got off the night shift at Pennington's Place
Just wanna go home and get some sleep
Butch grabbed her by the waist with the caffeine eyes
The hands all Incomprehensible
I picked up a brick from my papa's front yard
And threw it at the tallest boy's face
Well blood was streaming like a well that sprung
I couldn't believe what I had just done
Well the other boy ran and this one stayed
On the ground and he would never move again
Old Saint John on death row
He's just waiting for a pardon
Old Saint John on death row
He's just waiting for a pardon
All us boys on death row
We're just waiting for a pardon
All us boys on death row
Yours truly on trial I testify
I gotta keep on running 'til the well runs dry
Yours truly on trial I testify
I gotta keep on running 'til the well runs
Yours truly on trial I testify
I gotta keep on running 'til the well runs dry
Yours truly on trial I testify
I gotta keep on running 'til the well runs dry <start> I'm hangin around I not puttin down the state I'm in
I've never been proud And now I'm allowed to shed my skin
I'm driving away I know if I stay I'll sit and spin.
Imagine the day I'm drowing that they can reel me in
Pick up where I left off
Lets make a bet
We'll make a bargain and call this truce
Let's make a bet
I'm in loss and win or lose with you
I see it all now I'm taking my bow in every sense
I'm scratchin around Its getting too loud the space I'm in
So now I can leave Too decent of me so evident
The one that relieves The other's disease like medicine
Pick up where I left off
Lets make a bet
We'll make a bargain and call this truce
Let's make a bet
I'm in loss and win or lose with you
Speakin in tounges i can't get through
Think of runnin but
I'm tired of runnin into you
Speakin in tounges the way i do
Found that you understand quite well
Cause thats your language too
I'm hangin around I'm not puttin down the state i'm in
In love with the sound its gettin too loud
Lets make a bet
We'll make a bargain and call this truce
Let's make a bet
I'm in loss and win or lose with you
Lets make a bet
I never wanted to call this truce
Lets make a bet
Always lost and win or lose with you <start> I can't believe I'm stuck here in the room
When I look out my window at night I don't see the moon
But I'm happy to be happy again
I've been pitching the idea ever since I was 
And the calendar says I'm almost 
Well that just can't be true
But I'm happy to be happy again
And this trickles up and down my spine
Like grains from an hour glass
I know it will pass
I tried to leave the house but there was no use
I declined to stay in bed cos it seemed like something I could do
Still I'm happy to be happy again <start> You say you stand by your man
Tell me something I don't understand
You said you love me and that's a fact
And then you left me said you felt trapped
Well some things you can explain away
But the heartache's in me till this day
Did you stand by me
No not at all
Did you stand by me
No way
All the times
When we were close
I'll remember these things the most
I see all my dreams come tumbling down
I can't be happy without you around
So all alone I keep the wolves at bay
And there is only one thing that I can say
Did you stand by me
No not at all
Did you stand by me
No way
You must explain why this must be
Did you lie when you spoke to me
Did you stand by me
No not at all
Now I got a job
But it don't pay
I need new clothes
I need somewhere to stay
But without all these things I can do
But without your love I won't make it through
But you don't understand my point of view
I suppose there's nothing I can do
Did you stand by me
No not at all
Did you stand by me
No way
Did you stand by me
No not at all
Did you stand by me
No way
You must explain why this must be
Did you lie when you spoke to me
Did you stand by me
Did you stand by me
No not at all
Did you stand by me
No way
Did you stand by me
No not at all
Did you stand by me
No way <start> Come and relax now
Put your troubles down
No need to bear the weight of your worries
Just let them all fall away. <start> You're a lot like me
And I think that you should tell her
That the only difference between us is fear
And if you are like me
Then I think you should remember
If you ever wanna get yourself outta here
Now all you think you hide are open secrets
And the pendulum swings back and forth my dear
Don't believe
Everything you hear
Gather all you cherish
And keep it quite near
I can be your friend
Or I just just go and break you
And I think you'd better make what you want clear
'Cause I'm not quite sure
How long it's gonna take you
If you really wanna get yourself outta here <start> Que bom viver como  bom sonhar
E o que ficou pra trs passou e eu no me importei
Foi at melhor tive que pensar em algo novo que fizesse sentido
Ainda vejo o mundo com os olhos de criana
Que s quer brincar e no tanta responsa
Mas a vida cobra srio e realmente no d pra fugir
Livre pra poder sorrir sim

Eu vou com voc pra onde voc for
Eu descobri que  azul a cor da parede da casa de Deus
E no h mais ningum como voc e eu <start> Unser Leben war nicht keimfrei
nicht von Engeln bewacht
doch es ist ganz schn hart
was Ihr draus macht
was glaubt Ihr zu wissen
was glaubt Ihrwer wir sind
Ihr habt jahrelang gelogen
die Fresse stinkt
Fr die Blinden und die Tauben
noch ein allerletztes Mal
Ihr wollt es immer noch nicht glauben
Ihr knnt nichts ndernes ist wahr
fahrt zur Hlle mit Euren Lgen
die wirklich niemand braucht
wir lassen uns nicht unterkriegen
niemand hlt uns auf
fahrt zur Hlle
Ihr habt wie Hunde uns gehetzt
unsre Lieder verboten
ich wei warumdenn wir treten
dann nach oben
das ist das Lebendas wir whlten
ich will nichts anders haben
Ihr hrt eh' nurwas Ihr hren wollt
nicht was wir sagen <start> Maybe the years have told you
Do you remember when life was just a new day
You know the story don't you
The one they told you when life was slipping away
Aah look at the brand new day
Sitting here upon the milky way
Aah look at the dancing girls
Sitting holding hands across the world
You got a brand new lady
Just like the one you left down in some other place
Reading all the letters
Saw your face coming through on the ouija board
Aah look at the brand new day
Sitting here upon the milky way
Aah look at the dancing girls
Sitting holding hands across the world
You heard the words of aaron
He spoke the truth in these things both great and small
You can throw away the ashes
You sweep them over the world on your own accord
Did you know the real answer
You'd see the kind of mistakes that you can't afford <start> It's too late tonight
To save all of you
I've got to hold on
Make myself like you
You went on the velvet way
And every dying day
You've got your own love to shake
Into your mind again
Babe I want to know
Every breath that you save
And I'll be there when you burn
And I'll be there when you turn
It's too late tonight
To go racing back for
It won't work anyhow
The way you loved him so
Go on your wicked dance
But every fight you're in
You're gonna end all alone
Shedding your blood again
Baby I want to know
Every breath that you save
And I'll be there when you burn
And I'll be there when you turn
And I'll be there when you burn
And I'll be there when you turn
Every time it comes around
It picks you up and throws you down
All I know is I am bound to fall
Over with you
Love you must be thinking of love
Love you must be thinking of love
Got to keep moving
Lover you hide from me every time
Love oh love oh love oh love
Yeah you must be thinking of love
You must be hiding out
And it's too late tonight
To go running back for
It's too late tonight
Don't break every red rose
It's too late tonight
Hold your head up
It's too late to go <start> Crime it only comes in waves
I keep one side in distress the other side of me saved
Times why do they always change
I keep one foot in the grass the other foot in the grave
the other foot in the grave
So take what you want and more
As I'm giving myself away
I don't care what you use it for
It's of no use to me of no use to me
For so long I've been forlorn
And I guess it's just as well
My body and mind are worn
Send me right back down
Back down to hell
Rhythms in almost every phrase
One line leads to the next until i choose to refrain
My mind why does it always change
I keep one side of it stressed the other side of it sane
The other side of it sane <start> You're the light you're the night
You're the color of my blood
You're the cure you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much so much
You're the fear I don't care
'Cause I've never been so high
Follow me through the dark
Let me take you past our satellites
You can see the world you brought to life to life
So love me like you do lololove me like you do
Love me like you do lololove me like you do
Touch me like you do oh touch me like you do
What are you waiting for
Fading in fading out
On the edge of paradise
Every inch of your skin
Is a holy grail I've got to find
Only you can set my heart on fire on fire
Yeah I'll let you set the pace
'Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for
Love me like you do lololove me like you do
Love me like you do love me like you do
Touch me like you do touch me like you do
What are you waiting for

Which side are you on Which side are you on
I asked you what side you wanted on

A waste of time
Don't believe
Can't decide to
Hit the ground
Make your mind
It's holding me
Down
And always did
Down
And all we get
Down
This time you think it pointed right at you
Whose side are you on Whose side are you on
I asked you what side did you point it at
Whose side are you on Whose side are you on

A waste of time
We don't believe
Can't decide till you've
Hit the ground
Thank you much
If you don't believe
Can't decide
Till you
Hit the ground
Make your mind
It's holding me
Down

You don't think that I don't know
'Cause I do
Nice try
'Cause that's what you really got
Lie.

Live flows in slow motion while dreaming about
Walking through stars and reliving past stories
Of no pain and glory
Now's all back to me
Welcome to my seventeen
Another time
All the things you left behind
Now are alive
Welcome to those pretty nights
Under the moon
Welcome to my seventeen
Night lights show me where I'm going
Singing old melodies and dreaming about
Running away to a place with new stories
I'll come back I promise.
For my seventeen
Welcome to my seventeen
Another time
All the things you left behind
Now are alive
Welcome to those pretty nights
Under the moon
Welcome to my seventeen TONIGHT <start> You can't hide
Behind social graces
So don't try
To be all touchy feely
'cause you lie
In my face of all places
But I got no
Problem with that really
What bugs me
Is that you believe what you're saying
What bothers me
Is that you don't know how you feel
What scares me
Is that while you're telling me stories
You actually
Believe that they are real
I get no illusions about you
Guess what
I never did
When I said
When I said I'll take it
I meant
I meant as is
Just give up
And admit you're as asshole
You would be
In some good companyand I think you'd find
That your friends would forgive you
Or maybe I
Am just speaking for me
When I look around
I think this this is good enough
And I try to laugh
At whatever life brings
'cause when I look down
I just miss all the good stuff
And when I look up
I just trip over things
I've got no illusions about you
Guess what
I never did
When I say
When I say I'lll take it
I mean
I mean as is <start> Tired of all the promises and never coming through
It's easy to pretend until they turn their back on you
And all the ones that bring you down their colors weren't that true
And life's become a battle that you swore you'd never lose
It don't matter what went wrong this time don't matter what went right
We're always searching for the reason why
And the longest road to find it will take many years to climb
Don't wait up for that moment to arrive
Leave them all behind
Yeah I'm tired of all the promises and never coming through
It's easy to pretend until they turn their back on you
Yeah and all the ones that bring you down their colors weren't that true
And when you lose your confidence your mind plays tricks on you
It don't matter what went wrong this time don't matter what went right
We're always searching for the reason why
And the longest road to find it will take many years to climb
We keep on getting stuck here all the time
We're gonna leave them all behind We're gonna leave them all behind
We're gonna catch that train the words they say couldn't stop us if they tried
We're gonna leave them all behind We're gonna leave them all behind
We're gonna catch that train I know some day everything's gonna fall in line
I've been struck down and defeated every step along the way
Become I'm your own worst enemy when nothing seems to change
You have to fail a thousand times before you get it straight
So catch me if you can 'cause I ain't leaving this to fate
It don't matter what went wrong this time don't matter what went right
We're always searching for the reason why
And the longest road to find it will take many years to climb
We keep on getting stuck here all the time
We're gonna leave them all behind We're gonna leave them all behind
We're gonna catch that train the words they say couldn't stop us if they tried
We're gonna leave them all behind We're gonna leave them all behind
We're gonna catch that train I know some day everything's gonna fall in line
Oh oh oh
Tired of all the promises and never coming through
Stop waiting for that moment to arrive
We're gonna leave them all behind We're gonna leave them all behind
We're gonna catch that train the words they say couldn't stop us if they tried
We're gonna leave them all behind We're gonna leave them all behind
We're gonna catch that train I know some day everything's gonna fall in line
We're gonna leave them all behind We're gonna leave them all behind
We're gonna catch that train I know some day everything's gonna fall in line
Yeah <start> for years now we've fought alone
but segregation won't build us a home no
our strength will grow through community
so what is it to be
well sometimes we feel happy
and sometimes we feel proud
and so we keep on struggling
sometimes i'm so tired i can't see the good through the bad
but still we keep on struggling
our time is now
what you gonna do
are you just gonna sit and let it pass you
our time is now
what you gonna say
unification today
people say that we will never go
but negative is all they're offering
those people say

Of black and white for far too long
And now these deepen colors seem so shocking
Bless the cool cold moon
That moves the seas that makes the waves
That made this scene for me to see be moved
Will my life be long enough
To see the things I want to see
I believe this world is just too big for me
Every cloud that passes by is another cloud I'll never see
Maybe I just try to hard to understand all of these thing
Bless the hands of painters oh
Who have captured melon skies
Starry nights for us to see and feel
For all of time
Will my life be long enough
To see the things I want to see
I believe this world is just too big for me
This time it's just a blink of an eye
A glimpse into the world we were never meant to see
So don't hang on to anything at all
And all the things we have
And all the people we have known
Will fade away so quickly
Into the deep
And memories of love
Will be the only warmth we have in the end <start> Feels like the walls are closing in on me

You stupid girl <start> The Kodak next to me is what puts me to sleep
and sends me to a place where you're always there.
Through wood bed board I peek I see me kiss your cheek
I close my eyes and you're kissing my lips.
The weekends I live for
what did I do before I had your Courtney
You showed me the happiness.
And I'll hold all the pictures real close
then press them up against me
and hope that I'll get one more minute of being with you.
The Kodak's next to me our love puts me to sleep
and sends me to a place where you're always there.
And in my dreams I see a picturesque you and me
I'm so in love and I know that you really see.
Everyday I live for I say goodnight once more with you
Courtney You showed me the happiness. <start> Whatever you put in my hands is my life savings my main man
I got a box fit for a king on Queens Street

Money can't buy happiness
Man I think the opposite
If I had just one chance
I'd buy romance
Chorus 
I want to know the things you're thinking
I want to be the place you are
Under the city lights I'm sinking
Is anybody out there anybody out there
All alone in the strange city
Every other face is a blank to me
But I'm gone gone gone
And I'm lost in a sea of anonymity
Money can't buy happiness
Man I think the opposite

I love the way the city turns
I'm yours today I will be found
I can't stop laughing I can't stop smiling
All the time

The sun could never thaw away the the bliss that lays around me.

Let it rain let it rain
Let your love rain down on me.
Let it rain let it rain
Let it rain rain rain.
Her life was like a desert flower burning in the sun.
Until I found the way to love it's harder said than done.
Chorus
Now I know the secret there is nothing that I lack.
If I give my love to you you'll surely give it back.
Chorus <start> An open door I can't walk through
'Cause I can't leave behind all these things that I knew
They're all gone
And I've lost track
Of all the ones I loved and turned me back
Inside myself the words I say
It couldn't be the truth when lies got in the way
But tomorrow will be a brand new day
And I hope that it brings the chance that I forgot to take
And I know there's so much I can be
If I can be strong enough to throw away these weak pieces of me
These tired eyes and hollow skin
They remind me of the places that I've been
I feel so far but still so close
It feels like I'm living inside my own ghost
But tomorrow will be a brand new day
And I hope that it brings the chance that I forgot to take
And I know there's so much I can be
If I can be strong enough to throw away these weak pieces of me
I've gone to sleep in heaven
Only to wake in hell
If I'm gonna make it through this now then I'll have to save myself
'Cause tomorrow will be a brand new day
And I hope that it brings a chance I forgot to take
And I know there's so much I can be
If I can be strong enough to throw away these weak pieces of me oh no <start> I need a refueling

I was walkin' down the road a carryin'
The load that my father had a given me
The night before I packed and left the home
Of my childhood home of my birth.
The place in the back of the store
Where we would work
Until the night time darkness
Brought the end of day
Now Let Us Pray
When my brother was a kid
Well he often went and hid in the backyard
Settin' at the feet of my father
And my mother would appear
Oh to sooth away the fear
That my father had a started
Pretty soon the trouble parted
And while sittin' at the evenin' supper table
He'd say Now Let Us Pray
Oh Pray For Me Burly
Chorus
Now I travel all alone
A thinkin' of the home
That my Mom and Dad were given
In the times they were livin'
And the backyard swing and the happiness
Is bringin' out a whole bunch of presents
For the holiday
Remember Mom and Daddy
Are livin' and it's time now to say
Let Us Pray
Our Religion Is Music <start> Baby when I think about you I think about love
Darlin' don't live without you and your love
If I had those golden dreams of my yesterdays
I would wrap you in the Heaven 'til I'm dyin' on the way
Feel like makin'
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love to you
Baby if I think about you I think about love
Darlin' if I live without you I live without love
And if I had the sun and moon we will shine them
I would give you both night and day of satisfyn'
Feel like makin'
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love to you
And if I had those golden dreams of my yesterdays
I would wrap you in the Heaven 'til I'm dyin' on the way
Feel like makin'
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love to you
Well I feel like makin' love
Well I feel like makin' love
Well I feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love to you
Well I feel like makin' love
Well I feel like makin' love
Well I feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love to you
Well I feel like makin' love
Well I feel like makin' love
Well I feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love to you
Well I feel like makin' love <start> Speak up sir and clearly state your name
Did you say you are the son and came to save
How in my right mind should I believe
That a life exists beyond what I perceive
Change all my fear to faith in you
I'm forgetting all I know and I'm leaning on your love
Yes I see now all your wonder
My mind will now make room for all the truth that is in you
And I see now all your wonder
Let me journey to the unveiled place
Where my selfish wills and ways become untraced
Suddenly my visions getting clear
When I see the answers reasons disappear <start> Break me Lord I've taken control
I don't know how to get up from this fall
Fill my head with comfort instead
And resolute mistakes past made
Help me take this day by day
Take what is Yours make it Your own
Show my way home Your will not mine
I know if I surrender control
Help me Lord I failed You before
I haven't quite accepted that I'm wrong what You see
Mold it to be the life that You have planned
I can be used by You if I would grab Your hand <start> I would not tell you how I feel
Anymore because I've seen
How men find offence in reason
I save my heart for my family
My soul for work
My mind in moving
Through the world
Although my young ideal is gone
My embrace not so blind
And my trust is never certain
I try to find what's among us
Not to unite but to realise that
To waste's defeat
And when uncertainty reveals
When the consequences ark
When the act seems in the balance
Music is born from an instinct
And that is my truth
In the moment that I
Need it most
Scat by Harry Angus <start> YOU TRY TO STRIP MY DIGNITY
BUT THAT WON'T WORK WITH ME
TOU TELL ME THINGS ARE DIFFERENT NOW
WHY CAN't IT JUST BE ME
JUMBLED THOUGHTS INSIDE YOUR HEAD ARE
CIRCLING ROUND AND ROUND
CAN'T UNDERSTAND THE THINGS I DO
OR THE THINGS I'VE FOUND
HIDING BEHIND YOUR INSECURITIES
THE TRUTH IS SHINING RIGHT
THROUGH FROM ME TO YOU
YOUR UNDERLYING FEARS ARE SCREAMING FROM BELOW
DON'T SEE WHY YOU ATTACK ME
BUT SOMEDAY YOU SHALL KNOW
FADE AWAY INTO NOTHING
SLOWLY DISAPPEARING OVER TIME
FADE AWAY INTO NOTHING
SLIPPING THROUGH THE FINGERS OF TIME
LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW I SEE YOU WALK BY
THE BORING LIFE YOU LEAD I SEE DEEP IN YOUR EYES
SAME 'OL ROUTINE NOTHING EVER SEEMS TO CHANGE
THE MONOTONY OF YOUR LIFE THERE IS NOTHING TO GAIN
DILUTING YOURSELF IN THIS WATERY GRAVE
YOU'VE LOST ALL MEANING JUST OBSESSED WITH THE GAIN
ACTING LIKE EVERYTHING IS FINE IN YOUR LIFE
BUT IT SLOWL CREEPS UP TOO LATE TO END
ALL THE STRIFE
FADE AWAY INTO NOTHING
SLOWLY DISAPPEARING OVER TIME
FADE AWAY INTO NOTHING
SLIPPING THROUGH THE FINGERS OF TIME <start> You told me that you like her
But she doesn't want to know
You tried so much to take her
But there's no way to go
I know that kind of feeling
Knocking on someone's door
I know the endless crying
When you don't know what you're living for
Write a letter 
You'll feel better 
You'll feel better when it's done
There is one way to show
What you feel for the girl
Write her a lovely letter
Tell her what you're looking for
Don't think it's old fashion
To take one's heart 
You gotta take it as a man
When you can't win her in this game
Write a letter 
You'll feel better 
You'll feel better when it's done
There are losers and winners
Just like you and me
Losers and winners  just like you and me
You should give me the letter
I'll use it for my own 
Maybe she wants to take me
Before she stays alone
Could be my destination
To pick up broken heart
Why don't you take it easy
And screw the girl who's next to you
Write a letter 
You'll feel better 
You'll feel better when it's done
There are losers and winners
Just like you and me
Losers and winners
Just like you and me
Losers and winners <start> Well this is the story of a man
That lived in pistoia
This is the story of a man
That lived in pistoia
He was a funny little fellow
With feet just like I showed ya
Well he had a girl
And tony got her for him
Well he had a girl
But sinobbio says he got it
She did everything for him
That she could do
But still 
He locked her in the bathroom
But still 
He locked her in the bathroom
Then he took her to milan
And locked her in the hotel too
Oh mary lou 
Oh child you big fool 
Oh mary lou 
Oh child you big fool 
You did everything for him
That you could do <start>

  . <start> Like a virgin with an urgin in a surgery
I'll be swinging I'll be bringing out the nurse in me.
The art will start when I play my part
As a healer who will steal your heart
Oh look what I did to my ID.
Oh look what I did to my ID.
With neurosis in perfusion
And psychosis in your soul
Eliminate confusion
And hide inside a brand new role
Like a good time girl I'm gonna try some new tricks
This could be the start of a whole new career
Got a deep plum lipstick and some t
herapeutics
This could take us to a town that's nowhere near here.
Got some heartfelt symptoms and I'm feeling sneaky
Young male intern tall and handsome
Got my hems so high they'll think I'm being cheeky.
Legs like mine were really made for dancing
Oh oh oh Hey hey hey
When heavens in the music
Hell is in control.
The angel's got the voices
But the Devil's got rock and roll
We may look we're phony medics
But we took our look from a book by Frederick's
Oh look
what I did to my ID  ID.
Look what I did to my ID. <start> I stopped into a club
I thought I'd see a show
Everyone was there
At least everyone I know
Their knickers in a knot
Their hands upon their heart
The best they'd ever seen
The greatest work of art
I wished that it was me
It's bleaker than you think
I'm running out of ink
Give a guy a break
This is what it takes
To drive a man to drink
A party at a friend's
Toronto's coolest scene
I thought I'd bring a tape
To show them where I'd been
And listen for a while
The lyrics made them smile
They said that it was fine
Although it's not the style
I said it wasn't me
Once upon a time
I couldn't get enough
Until I made it big
And that's when it got rough
Disappointed now
Perhaps a bit surprised
To look them in the face
And see it in their eyes
They wish it wasn't me
It's bleaker than you think
I'm running out of ink
Give a guy a break
This is what it takes
To drive a man to drink
I used to hold you close
You used to tell me things
You never told a soul
Until you heard me sing
The details of your life
Condensed into a song
The neighbor and his wife
Work out and sing along
And you can't look at me
It's bleaker than you think
I'm running out of ink
Give a guy a break
This is what it takes
To drive a man to drink
Could song be an alibi
A lyric replacement for falling in love
But now that the well is dry
I can't understand what I've been singing of
Do you know what it is to love
To really love
To really love.
Do I
I cycled by your house
I saw you on the lawn
I see you all the time
Now that you are gone
I tried to call your name
But something made me stop
I call you once a day
Until you call the cops
And told them it was me
I filled a plastic bag
With everything I wrote
I threw it off a bridge
And thought that it would float.
The water made it sink
The bag was bleeding ink.
I wished that I could swim
I wished that I could drink
I wished that it was me.
It's bleaker than you think
I'm running out of ink
Give a guy a break
This is what it takes
To drive a man to drink
I'm running out of ink
Give a guy a break
This is what it takes
To drive a man to drink
To drive a man to drink
To drive a man to drink <start> This silver bird takes me 'cross the sky
Just one more hour and I'll be home and dry
'Cross the ocean
Way above the clouds I come stealin'
Feelin' tired but I feel good
Cause I did everything I said I would
I think of you
And I know how you'll be feelin'
I gotta see you
I gotta be with you
We'll make it better now in every way
It's gotta be you
It's gotta be you
Yes from now on I'll tell you everyday
Way up here above this timeless sea
I realize just what it is you mean to me
You give me somethin' when I thought that everything we had was dyin'
I need a reason just to make me carry on
Well I know better now
I know where I belong
I can't imagine how I ever let myself just give up tryin'
I gotta see you
I gotta be with you
We'll make it better now in every way
It's gotta be you
It's gotta be you
Yes from now on I'll tell you everyday
Oooooh yes home and dry
Ain't nothin' up here gonna slow me down
You know I never had to take the long way 'round
I think of you
'Cause I know how you'll be feelin'
This silver bird takes me 'cross the sky
Just one more hour and I'll be home and dry
'Cross the ocean
Way above the clouds I come stealin'
I gotta see you
I gotta be with you
We'll make it better now in every way
It's gotta be you
It's gotta be you
Yes from now on I'll tell you everyday
Oooooh yes home and dry <start> Somebody asked me funny questions
If you could do it all over again
Would you go for the same thing
And if you could be somebody else
Would you hesitate or go ahead and change
Youre not an animal
But if you could choose from all the zoos
Which beast would you be
I dont wanna be nobody else
I dont wanna be nowhere else
Cause I wouldnt be with you
And I wanna be with you
If you could be livin in a different age
A different time in history
Would you buy a time machine
And if they vote you for president
Would you go to war
A bigger war or would you make amends <start>

Well angels lay your arms around
Oh every city's seen the setting sun
Call 'em kicks you know they just begun
So come on lay your halo down
Oh lady lady don't let your worry please
Well you got something
and that ain't nothing to just let be
So why you kicking all those storms around
And keeping fake down in the underground
Oh come on lay your halo down
So why you kicking all the rollies round
And keeping fake down in the underground
We won't call curtain
still we know that you have found...
Come on lay your halo down
Angels lay your arms around
Oh every city's seen the setting sun
Call em kicks you know they've just begun
Come on lay your halo down <start> Oh just try to scream along
This is not rock  roll
It's rock control
Uh oh uh oh uh oh oh oh
Uh oh oh oh oh oh
Look to your left and to your right
and find someone to hold
That's just what we like to do
Right before we lose control
Make like you're so fascinated
Like it's gonna blow
Like your brain is caffeinated
Totally implode
Oh just try to scream along
This is not rock  roll
It's rock control
Uh oh uh oh uh oh oh oh
Uh oh oh oh oh oh
Give it up give it up that's right
Cause there's no use holding in
Take turns pushing back and forth
Lose control and sink right in
Feel the pulsing of the bodies
Breathe in all that sweat
You wanted something you could feel
That's what you're gonna get
Oh just try to scream along
This is not rock  roll
It's rock control
Oh oh oh...
What you've got you've got on leashes
What you've got come on release us
Oh just try to scream along
This is not rock  roll
It's rock control <start> From the Album
 Lovesweat
Blue for the blue  I feel when I'm feelin' down
On the ground  feelin' down that could be most anyday
Green for the eyes  take a look around
When the sun goes down  and the sun goes down
In the strangest way 
Red for the light  gotta stop this thing
Find a song to sing that is everything
That I meant to say  meant to say 
Pray for the mice that are blind like the world
Never see the good that is done to the bad
It's too late to see
Two of us make it easier to read the signs
Memorize the lines  you play with me
One for the road  I'll be on my way
Come another day  when the things we say
Find a way to be  way to be 
Solo
Autumn calls for a change of year
Bringin' winter near us  greens are brown
And disquise a sign 
Wintertime is a razorblade  that the devil made
It's a price we pay for the summertime
Springdays come it's hard to know
Where the rain comes from  where the children go 
It's a nursery rhyme  nursery rhyme <start> Ive had it with this town
I never saw those shifting skies
I never saw the ground
Or the sunset rise
I want to live on an abstract plain
Im building a frame
A place to put my tenyard stare
Thinking of that paint
Painted in pleinair
I want to line on an abstract plain
I need a new adress
I want some new terrain
Is it North or South
I want to live on an abstract plain
I could sit on the roof
On top of that abstract house
See my abstract view
An abstract mouse
I want to live on an abstract plain <start> Oh stay right here
So I can catch your smile it's good
Stranger in a crowded room
What did you say your name was Oh baby
Let's have a drink and get to the bottom of this hill
And once we see the bottom we know we'll reach another hill
But you won't be a stranger in a room
A stranger in this crowded room with you a good good time tonight
Let's go away all of us way down
I know I'll dance again
Who knows what tomorrow will bring
But I know this for sure... that tonight brought a good time
Good time with me and y'all it's a good good time tonight
Oh you're feelin' it too the light bringin us up
Troubles away it's a good good time tonight
Ah a good time right here

skat session
Just a little more ice and everything's nice skat
What do you remember before the sea was rough and the sky was grey
Oh but not today not today 'cause it's a good good time tonight
The bad sky will be gone
Oh play on oh good good time tonight
Sippin' some wine with good friends
But you know you're havin' a good good time tonight
A good good time

Let's drink to those who can not be here
Let's drink to those who are gone
Let's drink to those who will be here soon
Let's drink to those we lost along the way
Oh but this a tip of your glasses for them all
It's a good good time
It's a good good time... tonight
It's a good good time

Good good time tonight
A good good time tonight

What is it that's on your mind
Sister oh how do you decide
What do you see through your clouded eyes
On every corner I turn to
Some variation of help me please
Can't pretend I don't see you there.
How should I feel
Brother you've fallen to your knees.
What do your children need
The distance is never out of reach
There's only inches between you and me.
On every corner I turn to
Some variation of help me please
Can't pretend I don't see you there.
How should I feel
Hey mister well I'm lookin' your way you know
I wouldn't ask if things weren't like they were today.
Count up the corners of 'em add up the dollars for 'em.
Hey mister well I'm lookin' your way you know
Ten thousand of 'em all over town.
I wouldn't ask if things weren't like they were today
But is it really helpin' whatever I do
Hey mister well I'm lookin' at you you know
Will I feel good about it will I feel a fool
I hate to beg 'cause I feel like such a fool
On every corner I turn to
Some variation of help me please
Can't pretend I don't see you there.
How should I feel <start> Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling twofoot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say
Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away
How can I even try
I can never win
Hearing them seeing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
Love will find a way
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say
Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away <start> My fee areplanted I can't fly...I'd like to moonwalk through
the sky...I'd like to tiptoe past this atmosphere  And so
I gaze past satellites...Past suns and stars and endless
nights...It's clear to me I see I'm small  Compared to You
I'm nothing at all  Beyond the depths of space and time...
You built these things that remind...Setting suns and shooting
stars...Say who You are  You're the Lonestar  And I'll lift
my head up to the sky...Your hand of greatness touches mine...
I'll be content I know I'm small  Compared to You I'm
nothing at all... <start> You you shake your head what is so hard to believe
When you you are in your bed I sing over you the sweetest things
Because oh my love is does not tire I'm awake when the moon is full
And I know the times when you feel lost and you just aren't sure
And lo and behold
My love hasn't grown cold for you
You could steal away in the middle of the night
And hide in the light of day
While you cloaked yourself in the darkest lies
But oh my love it swims in the deepest oceans of fear
And as soon as you lower your head I I am here
Lo and behold my love hasn't grown cold
Oh lo and behold my love hasn't grown cold
Yeah oh
If only you could see how heaven stills when you speak
I know all your days and I have wrapped you in mystery
And oh my love for you is as wide as the galaxies
Just hold out your hand and close your eyes
And come come be with me
And lo and behold my love oh yeah
Lo and behold my love yeah hasn't grown cold for you
It hasn't grown cold oh it hasn't grown cold <start> Lord I'm going away just to wear you off my mind.
Lord I'm going away just to wear you off my mind.
Well you keep me worrying 'bout it all the time.
Well I ain't been loved but four women's in my life.
Well I ain't ever loved but four women's in my life.
Well my mother and my sister sweetheart and my wife.
If you don't want me baby please don't call me 'round.
If you don't want me baby please don't call me 'round.
Well just like you found me you can put me down.
Well now goodbye baby if you call at home.
Well now goodbye baby if you call at home.
You can go away swear you won't stay long. <start> He came down from Trinity
A midtown boy from home
In the dirt walking miles before
And dreaming of his thirst
Oh on his way
He had to go
Oh on his way
He had to go
He came down from Trinity
A midtown boy from home
In the dirt walking miles before
And dreaming of his thirst
Oh on his way
He had to go
Oh on his way <start> All alone and night is falling
All along I hear you calling
Telling lies and sad goodbyes
The secrets will be safe inside of me
As long as I'm alive
You'll always be a part of me
As long as I'm alive
As long as I'm alive
For you I'll always keep the fire burning
Inside
I will keep this love alive
Let our souls be the first me satisfy
I will keep this love alive
Oh let our hearts be the only guide we follow
Everybody knows you can't build a wall around us
I believe time will tell
Our hearts will stay forever locked together
As long as I'm alive
For you I'll always keep the fire burning
Inside
Ahohoh I will keep this love alive
Let our souls be the first we satisfy
I will keep this love alive  ohohoh
Let our hearts be the only guide we follow
As long as I'm alive
As long as I'm alive
For you I'll always keep the fire burning
Inside
Ohoh I will keep this love alive
Let our souls be the first we satisfy
I will keep this love alive  ahahohohoh
Let our hearts be the only guide we follow
As long as I'm alive  yeah 
Oh <start> Just when I thought
I had handled solace
I could soften my guard behind false confidence
Just when I felt
Humbled by insipid
Except from this blindside and from reading a script
'Cause I am seduced by reaction and under the influence
I'm slipping again I'm
Up to my tricks off my wagon
I have no defense I'm
Wreaking havoc
Wreaking havoc and consequence
I get reduced by my own willfulness as
I reach for my usual odd replacements
'Cause I wish for sanction it lacks in my steps
I'm slipping grip I'm
Up to my tricks off my wagon
I have no defense I'm
Wreaking havoc
Wreaking havoc and consequence
If forgiveness is understanding that I
Affirming a compact for the millionth time
From this tumbling house of cards of mine
I am beaten by my impulsiveness
By this uncanny foreshadowing of regret
'Cause I'm repulsed by restriction at least that's my excuse
I'm slipping again I'm
Up to my tricks off my wagon
I have no defense I'm
Wreaking havoc
From v
Wreaking havoc and consequence
I have no defense I'm
Wreaking havoc
Wreaking havoc and consequence <start> i've been
typing for hours while he waits
alone in the bushes
there's a guy on the back lawn
he can look under mats but he won't get in
he scales the walls with almost no sound
i'm sitting dead still with the light on
i'm sending off my resignation
before he gets to all i got
i'm staring at nothing
my frozen joints all broke away
i'm sending off to find them <start> Deep space comes a silver shine
Get your go get mine
Our ride was half as bad
Not quite what they had
We'll take what we can get
Even if it's
We'll take what we can get
Even if it's
We'll take what we can get
Even if it's
I've seen it fly around
I seen it hit the ground
Center sun into the sea
No one rides for free
We'll take what we can get
Even if it's
We'll take what we can get
Even if it's
We'll take what we can get
Even if it's <start> Den ganzen Tag rennst du der Kohle hinterher.
Den ganzen Tag arbeitest du von frh bis spt.
Nur damit du mal'nen eignen Mercedes hast
und ein eignes grosses Haus mit grossem Garten.
Nur du gehst dabei vor die Hunde
nur du gehst dabei zugrunde.
Steh ich vor dem Spiegel schau ich in Alltagssorgen rein
und dann denk' ich ich wr so gern nochmal ein Kind
ich wr so gern nochmal ein Kind.
Frher warst du der der du wirklich warst
mit deinen Fragen deinen Popeln deiner Liebe deiner Angst.
Heute heisst es sowas macht man nicht
dazu bist du viel zu alt du bist jetzt erwachsen.
Nur du gehst dabei vor die Hunde
nur du gehst dabei zugrunde.
Steh ich vor dem Spiegel schau ich in Alltagssorgen rein

Midnight creeps so slowly into hearts of men who need more than they get
Daylight deals a bad hand to a woman who has laid too many bets
The mirror stares you in the face and saysBaby uh uh it don't work
You say your prayers though you don't care you dance and shake the hurt
Dance boogie wonderland. Ha ha dance boogie wonderland
Sounds fly through the night I chase my vinyl dreams to boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
All the love in the world can't be gone
All the need to be loved can't be wrong
All the records are playing and my heart keeps saying
Boogie wonderland wonderland
Dance boogie wonderland. Ha ha dance boogie wonderland. Ha ha
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland <start> Hey man why don't you leave me alone
Stay off my lawn
Get away from my home
I saw you dog
It shit on my grass
I stuffed a lighted M
Straight up it's ass
Let's bury the hatchet
Right in your skull
Cut it in half
And use it for a bowl
Let's bury the hatchet
Right in your head
Bury what's left
In my flower bed
Hey man why don't you leave me alone
Stay off my lawn
Get away from my home
I saw your kid
In my backyard
So I shot him right through the heart
Hey man why don't you leave me alone
Stay off my lawn
Get away from my home
I saw your kid
In my backyard
So I shot him right through the heart <start> He was searching for the light
In the silence of the night
Something real to make him feel alive
Trying hard to find the way
But run out of cards to play
No looking back he crossed the point of no return
All his life he's been waiting desperately
To wake up in the arms of a new tomorrow
Who has wrote the book of destiny
After all a dream may come alive
Chorus
Fly eagle fly
On your way back to the sky
Let me be the chosen one
And set me free
Fly eagle fly
N' pretty soon my fears run dry
Take me with you far away
Come rescue me
So come and rescue me now
There's a message on the wall
It saysthe good Lord knows you all
But it seems that he's forgot this troubled soul
Well there's not much you can do
When you're down and feeling blue
Tired of all this neon world that tastes unreal
Once again it's hurting me to see
Another broken life that cries for sorrow
Who has wrote the book of destiny
After all a dream may come alive
He was searching for the light
In the silence of the night
Something real to make him feel alive
Trying hard to find the way
But run out of cards to play
No looking back he crossed the point of no return
All his life he's been waiting desperately
To wake up in the arms of a new tomorrow
Who has wrote the book of destiny
After all a dream may come alive
Chorus
There's a message on the wall
It says the good Lord knows you all
But it seems that he's forgot this troubled soul
Well there's not much you can do

Tired of all this neon world that tastes unreal
Once again it's hurting me to see
Another broken life that cries for sorrow

After all a dream may come alive
Chorus <start> Can't you see I'm easily bothered by persistence
One step from lashing out at you...
You want in to get under my skin
And call yourself a friend
I've got more friends like you
What do I do
Is there no standard anymore
What it takes who I am where I've been
Belong
You can't be something you're not
Be yourself by yourself
Stay away from me
A lesson learned in life
Known from the dawn of time
Respect walk
Run your mouth when I'm not around
It's easy to achieve
You cry to weak friends that sympathize
Can you hear the violins playing you song
Those same friends tell me your every word <start> Es gibt Uhren die halten gesund

The people that know you.
It's good to hear
The things that they say
At times when you are with them.
So good to note
My strength is growing from day to day
There's not a thing
I try to do without you
Troubled times of pain that come
I take them any old day.
You come and you wash them all away
Everywhere you sing in everything
And I try by remembering
All the things that you said to me
From within all you did for me.
Just one word. <start> This heart don't count on the wicked
These hands don't fight at all
This mind don't do what it's told to
These eyes don't cry at all
Don't cry at all
These eyes don't cry at all
This heart don't count on the wicked
We face this world alone
When all that want is to break you
Turn anger into hope
We're in this city of villains
I walk these streets alone
When everyone is a stranger
They're eyes turn me to stone
Turn me to stone
This heart don't count on the wicked
We face this world alone
When all that want is to break you
Turn anger into hope
I'm telling you tonight I swear to tear up these nails from across the bed
For giving you control of me
This heart don't count on the wicked
This anger turns to hope
It turns to hope
Calling from the mountain tops
Rain is falling from the sky above
They surround you with the darkest thoughts
'til you drown in pessimistic talk
You say you don't care if the atom drops
You say you don't care if the world is lost
They'll never break you if you're strong enough
They'll never change you if you turn your anger into hope
This heart don't count on the wicked
We face this world alone
When all that want is to break you
Turn anger into hope
I'm telling you tonight I swear to tear up these nails from across the bed
For giving you control of me
This heart don't count on the wicked
This anger turns to hope
We turn it to hope
We turn it to hope
We turn it to hope
We turn it to hope
We turn it to hope
We turn it to hope
We turn it to hope
We turn it to hope
We turn it to hope <start> Nothing gets done
And everyone's tired
However every things fine
Everything comes in it's own good time
Pictures of people in magazines
I think that they're trying to tell me something
Pictures of people I've never met
Living inside my TV set
My heart gets so full
Driving around this town
Feel like Dr. Shivago
Lost in Chicago
Pictures of people never alone or confused
Just looking for something
Left at the side of the road
Pictures of people I never talk to
I want to say I'm pleased to meet you
Pictures of people I could believe in
If there was a way I could touch and feel them
I never see the same again
Pictures of people
Pictures of people
And I never see the same again yeah
Pictures of people
Pictures of people
Everything gets quiet
I need help to remember
I feel no regret
The kindness of strangers
The kindness of strangers
Come down through the airwaves
Come down through the airwaves
Never alone or afraid
Never alone or afraid
Just searching for something
Left at the side of the road
Pictures of people people around me
Never run out of things to tell them
Pictures of people here in my mind
I carry them with me all of the time
I never see the same again

Pictures of people <start>  <start> Wild wild young men they like to have a good time
They chase too many women they drink to much wine
Going for a wild ride stomping on the gas
Walking on the wild side living way too fast
Playing in hot game they ain't never gonna win
Wild wild young men
Wild wild young men
Wild wild young men like to party down
They got money in their pocket they're gonna spread it around
They try to make a big point of acting like a fool
Hanging out in the juke joints trying to be real cool
They're bound to come to some bad end
Wild wild young men
Wild wild young men
Young girl let me tell you don't give your heart
To no wild wild young man cause he'll tear it apart
You ain't nothing but a sweet toy put your head in a spin
He's just a honky tonk cowboy a feather in the wind
Don't care about no one but his so called friends
Wild wild young men <start> Everybody wants to go to heaven
But nobody wants to die
Everybody wants to go to heaven
Nobody wants to die <start> Verse

The heart in my chest it is beating so fast
I can hardly contain all the hope in my veins
As I see you alive in this city arise
Like the sun shining bright
We see darkness and night run from our lives

Chorus 
Teach us to love the way you loved us
Send us out send us out
Pour out your fire and flow through our lives

We'll take to the streets with fire in our hearts
Send us out send us out <start> I got a friend doesn't talk to me
He doesn't tell me what is going on
He doesn't like it when I open up
Oh and I got a friend who's a lot like me
I never tell her what is going on
She's always asking me to open up
I guess I never really have the guts
Why does it get so hard sometimes
I know you wanna get high at night
Why does it get so hard why does it get so
Lonely lonely lonely lonely
Remember when we were younger and
All we thought about was growing up
But we could never really grow enough
Oh and you blink an eye and you're looking back
Now what you had then is what you lack
And all you're saying is remember when
You're always trying to get back again
Why does it get so hard sometimes
I know you wanna get high at night
Why does it get so hard why does it get so
Hard sometimes I really wanna get high tonight
Why does it get so hard why does it get so
Lonely lonely lonely lonely
Lonely lonely lonely lonely
Lonely lonely lonely lonely
Lonely lonely oh it gets so
Lonely lonely lonely lonely
Why does it get so hard sometimes
I know you wanna get high at night
Why does it get so hard why does it get so
Hard sometimes I really wanna get high tonight
Why does it get so hard why does it get so
Lonely lonely lonely lonely
Lonely lonely lonely lonely <start> Broken down on the side of the road
Damn brakes locked up in the rain
Smoke's pourin' out from under the hood
Stuck on the highway again
I'm too young to quit
Too old to change
Baby what am I gonna do
I got the chopped top slammed down
' mercury blues
Can't find a phone can't hitch a ride
Who would stop for me anyway
You would think that after all of
These cars I've owned I'd break down and join triple A
I'm too young to quit
I'm too old to change
Baby what am I gonna do
We got the chopped top slammed down
' mercury blues
I got the ' mercury blues
By now you'd think I've paid all my dues
Just think of all the trouble
That car is puttin' me through
Well I guess like a tooth that needs to get filled
It's gonna hurt and you're gonna get drilled
And once you get it fixed it happens all over again
I'm too young to quit
I'm too old to change
Baby what am I gonna do
I got the chopped top slammed down
' mercury blues oh yeah
I got the ' mercury blues
By now you'd think I've paid all my dues
And just think of all the trouble
That car is puttin' me through
Well I guess like a tooth that needs to get filled
You know it's gonna hurt and you're gonna get drilled
And once you get it fixed it happens all over again
I'm too young to quit
I'm too old to change
Baby what am I gonna do
I got the chopped top slammed down
' mercury blues oh yeah
I got the chopped top slammed down
' mercury blues oh yeah <start> Who cares what came before
We were only starlight
One day then nevermore
Because we're whispers in the wind
Once upon a time
The world was never blind
Like we are
Right now it seems
You're only dreams and shadows
If wishes could be eagles how you'd fly
This is your life
This is your time
What if the flame won't last forever
This is your here
This is your now
Let it be magical
Who cares what came before
We're only starlight
Once upon the time
All the world was blind
Like we are
This is your life
This is your time
Look at your world
This is your life <start> So I saw the angel girl
Hang her wings by the door
Tired from the windy chill
Guilt has forced her to land
I no longer know she said
The way to fly myself home
May it all become familiar to us all..
New moon.. 
She's so vain she's dreaming of
Funerals to come
It's the part of the movie where
You can't help but close your eyes
A social butterfly retreats
Back to it's cocoon
Surely this will be familiar to us all
New moon.. 
Hold my gaze.. 
Gaze
New moon..  <start> I came here thinking I could ease the pain
I came in spite of others' good advice
I came here thinking sweet sweet revenge
Bring me some sugar let the games begin
I made a lot of bad decisions but tonight I'm breaking through
I came here to get over you
I had this dream about a wild bird
Black feathered picking at your beating heart
You reach for me and shout I need your love
Yet soon collapses when I call your bluff
Picking at your heart strings
I need your love
I started shaking when you told me that you found somebody new
I came here to get over you
And the lights are burning like kerosene
I can't stop thinking about you and me
Did you cross your fingers when you told me you'd be true
I came here to get
I came here to get
I came here to get over you
I came here to get over you
I came here to get over you
I came here to get over you
I made a lot of bad decisions but tonight I'm breaking through <start> The gulls are coming in off the coast
The smell of corpses passed them in
Mass graves uncovered must be abroad  it can't be here
I can sense your violence but I still don't understand
How when the past seems dead and you've got the future
In the palm of your hand
Run quick through  streets
Where killers hide
Our fruits get bricks in windows
And foreigners get hushedup trials
And you're waiting for a knock at the door
Which would tell if you spent the next few years
Free from life attacked by petrol bombs
The price of bread went up five pence today
And an immigrant was kicked to death again
And I'm scared for my life for the first time in it
And we've known all along that a home can put your life at risk
So I guess we'll just disperse again
And the s are coming off the land
The easy targets lure them in

Don't be absurd it can't be here
Until we find a place to settle
We'll just keep moving on
We stay in flocks like birds no one dares to move along
Across a sea of bleached skulls
Chased by death in all its forms
Over mountains under suns
We shoot to kill let's shoot for fun
Across a desert's burning skies we never stop to sleep or eat
Death always finds us in the end its  shadows  weeping
Over hot  and plains a killer wants to see us slain
Over fields of wheat and grain through the endless pouring rain
Why can we never find a safe place to land
And we find ourselves through God's providing hand
At the close of every day <start> We were born with wings to fly
But sometimes we can't reach that high
Cause it feels like the sky is falling down
Against the odds against the rain
You dig your heels in to slow that train
So many wishes in the lost and found
One little thing can turn it all around
Chorus
Holding on to a dream
Trying to keep hope alive
You can reach out to me
You can reach down deep inside
When the whole world's gone insane
A ray of light remains
The days you know it seems
Sometimes the hardest thing is
Holding on to a dream
At times you win at times you lose
Sometimes life puts a rock in your shoe
But something in you keeps you walking on
Leave the fear and doubt in the past
Just believe don't look back
Chorus
Feels like an endless fight
All up hill but that's all right
Chorus <start> Purposeless man of clay
Darkness roll away
A silent stream leads the flow
moving on and on
Random lines fall in place
adulterines slowly fade away
I'm sucked in deep by the flow
taken in by the undertow <start> About the time my Daddy left to fight the big war
Saw my first pistol in a general store
In the general store when I was thirteen
I thought it was the finest thing I ever had seen
So l asked if I could have one someday when I grew up
Mama dropped a dozen eggs she really blew up
She really blew up she didn't understand
Mama said the pistol was the devil's right hand
The devil's right hand the devil's right hand
Mama said the pistol was the devil's right hand
My very first pistol was a cap and ball Colt
Shoot as fast as lightnin' but it loads a mite slow
Loads a mite slow and soon I found out
It will get you into trouble but it can't get you out
Bout a year later got a Colt 
Called a peacemaker but I never knew why
Never knew why I didn't understand
'Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
The devil's right hand the devil's right hand
Mama said the pistol was the devil's right hand
The devil's right hand the devil's right hand
Mama said the pistol was the devil's right hand
Got into a card game in a crumbling town
Caught a miner cheating so I shoot the dog down
Shoot the dog down watched the man fall
Never touched his holster never had a chance to draw
The trial was in the morning and they drug me out of bed
Asked me how I pleaded not guilty I said
Not guilty I said you've got the wrong man
Nothing touched the pistol but the devil's right hand
The devil's right hand the devil's right hand
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand
The devil's right hand the devil's right hand
Mama said the pistol was the devil's right hand <start> When I go to sleep you become my thief
Why dont you steal what you can keep
But you wont let me be
You break into my dreams
And every day seems different
Sometimes I pretend youll come back again
And youll console the heart you stole
Have pity on the man
Who knows that you have gone
And has begun to break down
I feel almost possessed
So long as I dont lose this glorious distress then
You can take all I have left
I know its over
If you cant be my lover
Be my thief
Im so drowsy now Ill unlock the door
What fades in time will hurt much more
So heres that happy scene
Where you come back to me
Its only found in fiction
I feel almost possessed
So long as I dont lose this glorious distress then
You can take all I have left
I know its over
If you cant be my lover
Be my thief
I didn't lead you on
But there will always be
A little larceny in everyone
So hush and dont you cry
Im trying to be kind
Because I have a perfect alibi <start> Here comes old Rosie she's looking mighty fine
Here comes hot Nancy she's steppin' right on time
There go the street lights bringin' on the night
Here come the men faces hidden from the light
All through the shadows ah they come and they go
With only one thing in common
They got the fire down below
Here comes the rich man in his big long limousine
Here comes the poor man all you got to have is green
Here comes the banker and the lawyer and the cop
One thing for certain it ain't never gonna stop
When it all gets too heavy
That's when they come and they go
They go
With only one thing in common
They got the fire down below
Yeah it happens out in Vegas happens in Moline
On the blue blood streets of Boston
Up in Berkeley and out in Queens
And it went on yesterday and it's going on tonight
Somewhere there's somebody ain't treatin' somebody right
And he's looking out for Rosie and she's looking mighty fine
And he's walking the streets for Nancy
And he'll find her every time
When the street light flicker bringing on the night
Well they'll be slipping into darkness slipping out of sight
All through the midnight
Watch 'em come and watch 'em go oh go
With only one thing in common
They got the fire down below
Oh burning down below
Yeah it happens out in Vegas happens in Moline
On the blue blood streets of Boston
Up in Berkeley and out in Queens
And it went on yesterday and it's going on tonight
Somewhere there's somebody ain't treatin' somebody right
And he's looking out for Rosie and she's looking mighty fine
And he's walking the streets for Nancy
And he'll find her every time
When the street light flicker bringing on the night
Well they'll be slipping into darkness slipping out of sight
All through the shadows
Watch 'em come and watch 'em go oh they go
With only one thing in common
They got the fire down below
Oh they got one thing in common
They got the fire down below
Oh they got one thing in common
They got the fire down below
One two three <start> they want us to tell them
what to burn into the groove
we're just gonna sit
and let them make the first move
the radio obsession
doesn't mean shit to me
i don't like first impressions
and i don't watch much tv
i don't want to think about it
who what when or where
i don't want to think about it
i don't really care
i don't want to think about
creating something new
i don't want to think about it
because i've got much better things to do
i don't want to think about it
i don't want to see
i don't want to know
the kind of fool they'll make of me
the public gets what they deserve
not what they demand
unless we all decide to be a business not a band
i don't want to think about it
who what when or where
i don't want to think about it
i don't really care
i don't want to think about
creating something new
i don't want to think about it
because i've got much better
things to do  just like you <start> Hometown girl Home on a weekend
I'm at home alone and drinkin
she's comin' over soon I'd rather watch the game
third quarter play and the Lions are winnin' once again
Chorus She told me to kiss her where she stinks
so I drove her to Squamish 
She stumbles through the door wearin' Ruby red lipstick
Smellin' of cheap perfume whiskey beer and cigarettes
She wants to make love to me but it's under duress.
Because I've seen what's under that little pink dress
Chorus
I needed to get some air and I told her so
Off to the Mr. G Come on...LETS GO
Jumped into my ducttaped bondoed Honda Civic
Hit the gas and headed out beyond the city limits
Bridge Drivin' Along the Sea to Sky...Highway
She wonders where we're goin' for beer....

Trying round pieces of string
Pieces of string
To run amok run amok ran amok
To run amok
You got me you got me
You got me you got me
Back to bite me
Back to bite me
A penny for your thoughts <start> She sat me down and told me how
My eyes reveal a secret now
You're souls been hiding in a cloud
So scared of change
Your heart has got to learn to cry 
Before it grows it's wings to fly 
Everything must fade and die to move it on
Listen to your heart
And let it blow your world apart
Then you must go it alone
And keep searching for home
Remember nothing's ever set in stone
Thank you for the good advice 
Before I wouldn't have thought twice 
I'm melting through the frozen ice
My spring is near
And it's so clear
What it is I have to do 
Bow my head and battle through 
And I'll be standing there with you
All because you said
Listen to your heart
And let it blow your world apart
Then you must go it alone
And keep searching for home
Remember nothing's ever set in stone
Open up your eyes
And you might keep your dream alive
So when you've finally flown and your resistance has grown
Then you'll know nothing's ever set in stone
You can turn back the clock but you don't need to
It's never too late to fix you life
Open up your eyes
And you might keep your dream alive
So when you've finally flown and your resistance has grown
Then you'll know nothing's ever set in stone
Nothing's ever set in stone <start> I don't know how old I was
But it was a ' pickup
I was lying on the ground
With flat iron bars over my head
One silver drop is all you need
To put a hole in your head at  degrees
That's right man you be the Metal Man
At  degrees
That's hot
That's hot
And over my head the hot wire was sparking
I got something down on my chest
And it began to bubble
I was repairing my three on a tree
When a drip dropped down on me
That's right man I'm the Metal Man
At  degrees
That's hot <start> Feels like heaven to me
Got me all confused
This was not supposed to be
I don't know what to do
Don't ask me where it came from
I've got this notion I can't seem to shake
It hits me like a little earthquake
Chorus
Maybe the wine got me thinking
Maybe the wine let me now
Maybe the wine got me feeling that
I should never let you go
Looks like heaven to me
Angels doing time
Wrapped up in a world of sin
It's gotta be in the wine
Don't ask me where it came from
I've got this vision I can't seem to shake
It hits me like a little earthquake
Repeat chorus <start> Talk to me 'bout fantasy
You talk to me 'bout love
You filled me with empty promises
You promised sky above
You ask me what I'd do for you
Give my life and more
But would it keep you satisfied
Baby I'm not sure
I change myself most everyday
But you don't reply
How can we survive
I can't change the world
If I tried would it make you happy
I can't change the world
This timei can't change the world
From soft lips you speak to me
How's it gonna be
Everyday's a different story
Changing all the time
You come to me with promises
I listen as you speak
But the promise that you want the most
Is not for me to keep
You leave me on this withered vine  now
Stripped away and torn
Left with only fantasy
Dreams of nevermore
I can't change the world
If I tried would it make you happy
This timei can't change the world
Never said that I held the answers
I can't change the world
I'd give my spirit if you tried
A fortune lost a heart denied
I come to you in your sleep
My heart is yours for only you to keep
And when the days they pass me you will see
I can't change the world
If I tried would it make you happy
I can't change the world
This time
I can't change the world
I never said I held the answers
I can't change the world
This time
I can't change the world
Change the world <start> we always need a skinhead BBQ back in the month of June
to ward off all the bad feelings left over from the fall and spring.
we must rely on common sense to keep us out of any mess
protect all those who do attend and entertain them until the end.
why can't all things be simple just like a BBQ
a summer skinhead BBQ  someday they will someday they will someday they will.
hamburgers and hot dogs chips and onion dip
watermelon and hawaiian punch to sip
don't forget the oreos double stuff  of course.

And no kind of booze or medicine helped at all
I'm drowning in too many contradictions
I'm about to lose all my self control
Water builds up
Water boils over
Gettin' too hot
The pot's starting to whistle
Running over the edge
Steaming up my aching head
The water getting higher
There's a dam bursting in my soul
Too many no's when I really needed yes for an answer
Too many times on my sad and lonely way
Feels are comin' in pressure building up too quickly
Working hard all day never any time to play
Water builds up
Water boils over
Gettin' too hot
The pot's starting to whistle
It's running over the edge
It's steaming up my aching head
The water getting higher
There's a dam bursting in my soul
Buildin' up inside of me
Deep down inside workin' free
Buildin' up deep inside
Buildin' up I hope it

Water boils over
Gettin' too hot

It's running over the edge

Policeman shoot down baby brother
Shot him shot him down in the street
But did they know the mothers grief
Were they sure they got the right one
Did they know he was her only son
A father tries to feed his family
They come here to find their opportunity
Living living living in the streets
With their dreams and with their humility
Cant we see all the pain and hurt
They love this land maybe more than us
Its a ghetto soundwave
Gets to me everyday
Its a ghetto soundwave
Gets to me everyday
Another bourgeois politician
Hears our pleas but does not listen
Never never never sees the need
But caters only to his greed
Cant he see theres no use in lying
And dont he know all our hope is dying <start> Shivers running down my spine whose blood I know it's mine 
I'm a moving target and I can't go home.
Chased forever and a day of my choosing my own way.
I don't want to forget the things I've done.
I am the hunted ..
Noone's hurt now I've escaped noone killed and noone raped.
But I'm the monster they want to catch.
My kids live alone with a stranger their mother's dead I killed her.
A moment's anger and a life of pain.
Running scared I know my number I know no joy only hunger.
I don't want to forget the things I've done.
Remorse regret it's more than anger everywhere I go there's danger.
I could take my life but still no wife.
Stop and think with my mixed up mind of sanctuary I can find.
Another night like this and I think I'll die.
How can I prove my innocence when this country's run by ignorants ..
As blind and deaf as a newborn child  <start> I would of had a asthma attack
If I seen the shark bite back
I would of had a asthma attack
If I seen the shark bite back
Yeah it's paradise island I know
Yeah yeah yeah I been there before
Once twice three times maybe
Once with my Moms and twice with my baby
I shook my silver bracelet at a thousand times
They like the shimmerglimmer but said
No never no never no never swim in the dark
Once twice three times maybe
Once with my Moms and twice with my baby
I would of had a asthma attack
If I seen the shark bite back
I would of had a asthma attack <start> Hold on this big wave
Will wash us all ashore
With nothing left to save
So leave here and be brave
There's nothing more in store
For a man that never gave
So go find a remedy
A medicine we all agree
You should know
Chorus
I'm just a stone's throw away
A mile down the road
In a phone booth I'll wait
And when all you call
I hope I hear you say
You'll be sure to bring the cure
And I'll be here another day
So go on steadfast
This town is slowly closing down
The present never lasts
So hold on this blind faith
Is harder now to see
In the darkness of this place
The glass full the candle burn
And I pushpull when hope returns
You should know
Chorus
I'm just a stone's throw away
A mile down the road
In a phone booth I'll wait
And when all you call
I hope I hear you say
You'll be sure to bring the cure
And I'll be here another day <start> It ain't natural for a delta man
To be surrounded by all this sand
To fear the echoes of live rounds
And to never sleep when the sun goes down
So I'm writing you this letter
To say I miss you more than ever and to promise you this
When I make it back to Memphis
I'm gonna take you in my arms
And never let you go
And girl I promise you a kiss
For every day we've missed
'Til I make it back to Memphis
I'll have to say I think we've done some good
If I had to do it all again I know I would
There's still a few shots every now and then
But they say this thing is finally coming to an end
So this might be my final letter
I say the sooner the better cause I'm ready to come home
When I make it back to Memphis
I'm gonna take you in my arms
And never let you go
And girl I promise you a kiss
For every day we've missed
'Til I make it back to Memphis
She reads his letters everyday then she puts them all away
Next to his medal and a flag that she would gladly give back
If it would bring him back to Memphis
So he could take her in his arms
And never let her go
Cause she's still waiting for a kiss
For every day they've missed
'Til he made it back to Memphis
Back to Memphis <start> Oh yeah
Let the band play one time now
It was early one morning
I was on my way to school
Early one morning
I was on my way to school
Got lost on monday morning
I broke my teachers rule
I was in love with you baby
Before I learned to call your name
I was in love with you baby
Before I learned to call your name
Now you're in love with someone else
You're bound to drive poor me insane
Oh yeah 
I said bye bye bye baby bye bye
I said bye bye bye baby bye bye
Ha ha
I said bye bye bye baby bye bye
Bring it down here
I said bye bye bye baby bye bye
Bye bye bye baby bye bye
I said bye bye bye baby bye bye
Yeah
Bye bye bye baby bye bye
Bye bye bye baby bye bye
I said bye bye bye baby bye bye <start> Me and the boys are we're living for the night
We're looking for adventure we're looking for a bloody fight
Always on the run we're never gonna do what's right
We're looking for chicks and we're looking for kicks
We're living fast and we're living right
Live fast die fast
Don't worry 'bout the crash
Hell bound on the coursecrash
Living in the alley with the rest of the trash
Ah we're never slowing down we're gonna party tonight
We don't care 'bout nothing we're living like rats in a sewer pipe
You'll never stop us now when we're running the red light
Pick up a few racks at the corner store
We're gonna get wild in the streets tonight
Live fast die fast
Don't worry 'bout the crash
Hell bound on the coursecrash
Living in the alley with the rest of the trash
Live fast die fast
Don't worry 'bout the crash
Hell bound on the coursecrash
Living in the alley with the rest of the trash
Me and the boys are we're living for the night
We're looking for adventure we're looking for a bloody fight
You'll never you'll never stop us now you see we're running the red light
We're looking for some chicks we're looking for some kicks and
We're living fast and we're living it right
Live fast die fast
Don't worry 'bout the crash
Hell bound on the coursecrash
Living in the alley with the rest of the trash <start> Standing there on a road that leads to anywhere
Like a child left in the wilderness standing there penniless
Wanting to be the best
Here's a place where life runs at a different pace
Where love is just convenient none are obedient
And we are subservient
Look at me I'm a girl that some may preconceive
Why do they try and generalize why are they antagonizing me
But something I can't control that...
CHORUS
I WANTCHA
You know I'll never stop 'til I've GOTCHA
You'll never be quite the same when I ROCK YA
I'm not the kind of girl that you thought I was
You'll have a good time 'cause I WANTCHA
I'm breaking down the walls 'till I have you feel you
Show you the time of your life
Here we are and I wonder how we've come this far
In a world that does not recognize women are victimized
What does that symbolize
Why do I want the things I usually criticize
It may be self destructiveness or maybe it's emptiness inside
But something I can't control that...
CHORUS
You'll have a good time...
It's a lonely road and no one knows the way that I feel
I'm not giving up now... I'll never try to justify
They'll never understand you'll be a happy man
You'll have the time of your life
It's something it's something it's something that I can't control
The time of your life...
 <start> Late August Moon
Did you reach the point where the heartaches come yet
Did you look my way can you feel me vibe you
Dreams die this way smothered by lust
Boys are broken in half for less
Late august moon theyll be coming soon
Did the angels bring you here tonight
Late august moon the enterprise is doomed
The waves have smashed me on your rocks
This towns not small and your minds eye knows that
And the odds were slim and fated by
The tides of June and all those jealous gods
If one of them dont love you its a shame
Late august moon theyll be coming soon
Did the angels bring you here tonight
Late august moon the enterprise is doomed
The waves have smashed me on your rocks
Set against a pitch black sky
Set against the question why
Theres no answer in your eyes only a quick look away
But someday Ill find you underneath a
Late august moon Ill be coming soon
Fate could never keep you away from me
Late august moon your other plans are doomed
Did you really think that you were free <start> Coffin case ran around
Another body can't be found
Coffin case just for you
Turn you into Elmer's glue
Jump back get down it's time to move
..... downtown I'm in the groove
Get lost no cost such a joke
World keeps going round and round
Your ashes up in smoke
Useless lie no excuse
Body has no use
Open up throw it in
Seek more ways to begin
Coffin case mind your plan
And join the living dead
Coffin case <start> Faces mistaken
Roads that you've taking are winding
Sand in your shoes
As you kick off those blues you've been sinking
You said that's all you want
You sure that's all you need from me
You said that's all you want
You sure that's all you need from me
Is it all you need
Morning to midnight
Everything's alright tomorrow
Eye's shine like diamonds so break off those bindings that hold you back
You said that's all you want
You sure that's all you need from me
You said that's all you want
You sure that's all you need from me
Is it all you need
These revelations keep coming down
Coming down on me
Your destination means everything
Everything to me
You said that's all you want
You sure that's all you need from me
You said that's all you want
You sure that's all you need from me
Is it all you need
Is it all you need
Is it all you need
Is it all you need
Is it all you need <start> I have been scarred so deep by life and cold despair and brittle bones were broken far beyond repair. I have leveled lies so deep the truth may never find. And inside my faithless heart I stole things never mine.
If mercy falls upon the broken and the poor Dear Father I will see you there on distant shores.
I have toiled for countless years and ever felt the cost and I've been burned by this world's cold like leaves beneath the frost. On my knees I've crawled to You bleeding myself dry. But the price of life is more than I could ever buy.
And off of the blocks I was headstrong and proud at the front of the line for the cardcarrying highbrowed. With both eyes fastened tight yet unscarred from the fight. Running at full tilt my sword pulled from its hilt. It's funny how these things can slip away our frail deeds the last will wave goodbye. It's funny how the hope will bleed away the citadels we build and fortify. GoodBye.
Night came and I broke my stride I swallowed hard but never cried. When grace was easy to forget I'd denounce the hypocrites casting first stones killing my own. You would unscale my blind eyes and I stood battered but more wise fighting to accelerate shaking free from crippling weight. With resilience unsurpassed I clawed my way to You at last. And on my knees I wept at Your feet I finally believed that You still loved me.
Healing hands of God have mercy on our unclean souls once again. Jesus Christ Light of the World burning bright within our hearts forever. Freedom means love without condition without beginning or an end. Here's my heart let it be forever Yours only You can make every new day seem so new. <start> Paradise can not refuse us
Never such a happy pair
Everybody must excuse us
If we walk on air
All the shadows now will lose us
Lucky stars are everywhere
As a happy being
Here's what I'm foreseeing
For you for me forever more
It's bound to be forever more
It's plain to see
We found by finding each other
The love we waited for
I'm yours you're mine
And in our hearts
The happy ending starts
What a lovely world
This world will be
With a world of love in store
For you for me forever more.
What a lovely world
This world will be
With a world of love in store
For you for me forever more. <start> I talk to you every now and then
I never felt so alone again
I stop to think at a wishing well
My thoughts send me on a carousel
Here I am standing on my own
Not a motion from the telephone
I know not a reason why
Solitudes a reason to die
Just you wait and see
As school life is a
It is a woken dream
Aren't you feeling alone
I guess its just another
I guess its just another
I guess its just another night alone
Now as I walk down the street
I need a job just to sleep in sheets
Buying food every once in a while
But not enough to purchase a smile
A tank of gas is a treasure to me
I know now that nothing is free
I talk to you every now and then
I never felt so alone again
Just you wait and see
As school life is a
It is a woken dream
Aren't you feeling alone
I guess its just another
I guess its just another
I guess its just another night alone <start> Aw who's the queen of the locker room
Who's the cream of the crop
Poor Joey took her to the matinee
Said God she wouldn't stop
Holy muscle of love
My heart's a muscle
Well I must have come to that crazy age
Where ev'rything is hot
'Cause I don't know if the things I'm thinking
Are normal thoughts or not
Holy muscle of love
Well I got a muscle of love
Yeah
Ooh
I read Dad's books like I did before
Now things are crystal clear
Lock the door in the bathroom now
I just can't get caught in here
Holy muscle of love
Well I got a muscle of love
Holy muscle of love
I got a muscle of love
Holy muscle of love
My heart's a muscle of love
Holy muscle of love
Well I got a muscle of love
Yeah yeah yeah
Must be a gift from above
Yeah yeah yeah
 <start> Please take me by the hand
It's so cold out tonight
I'll put blankets on the bed
I won't turn out the light
Just don't forget to think about me
And I won't forget you
I'll write you once a week she said
Why does it feel the same
To fall in love or break it off
And if young love is just a game
Then I must have missed the kick off
Don't depend on me to ever follow through on anything
But I'd go through hell for you and
I haven't been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words a simple melody
This world's an ugly place but you're so beautiful to me
I'll think about the times
She kissed me after class
And she put up with my friends
I acted like an ass
I'd ditch my lecture to watch the girls play soccer
Is my picture still hanging in her locker
I haven't been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words a simple melody
This world's an ugly place but you're so beautiful
I haven't been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words a simple melody
This world's an ugly place but you're so beautiful <start> Take a look around and tell me what you see
I guess that all depend on exaclty what you want it to be
Is your cup halffull is your cup halfempty>br> how can you get what you need in the land of plenty
Everybody gets carried away
Everybody's trying everyday to remind you
 leave it behind you
What's it take to see
What's it take to believe right from wrong
Never knowing where you belong
Walk on
Walk on
Sometimes I feel like I'm just doing time
Everybody wonders where you're going when you step out of line
Don't know all the answers someone's got to stand up and say hey
If you want to win the game then you know you're gonna have to play
Everybody's got to find a way
And everybody's trying everyday to remind you
What's standing behind you
What's it take to see
What's it take to believe right from wrong
Never knowing where you belong
Walk on
Walk on
Walk on
There's no turning back
Walk on
Get your train on the track <start> Underneath the table for shade
I leave you to the living again
Arabesque a flowery grave
I watch a real star winning
Over this twilight
Shouting at Jesus
Absolute closeness
Could be beneath us
If you
Lose yourself through touch
Lose yourself in love
It leaves me nothing to know
Just a stationary role
In your bedroom scene
Maybe what I'm trying to say is
I lost you in translation
To lover from the hand of a friend
Too much too hard to mention
So don't
Lose yourself through touch
Lose yourself in love
Lose yourself through touch
Lose yourself in love
Lose yourself through touch
Lose yourself in love <start>

 <start> Music Sipil  CHARON Lyrics Leppluoto
My love in you
purified in holy flesh
Our shape blurred
by the frame of hate
Fly out from the edge of time...
White white
goddes I sleep in you
Reach me
to the WINTER's calm
White white
goddes I sleep in you
Thy darkest trip
ends in the SEASONS change <start> Underneath The Cold November Sky

I'll Wait For You.
I'm So Desperate Just To See Your Face
Meet Me in This Broken Place..
Hold Me Now

To Make It New Again.
Theres No One I Can Run To
And Nothing I Could Ever Do

Even When The Light Begins To Fade
I'll Wait For You.
I'm So Desperate Calling Out Your Name

To Make It New Again.

Theres No One I Can Run To
And Nothing I Could Ever Do
I'm No Where If I'm Here
Without You. <start> When I close my eyes to say goodbye to life
All I want to know is that Ive truly strived
Cause all that really matters anymore
Is to love the one whom I truly adore
Hes the one that I am living for
And with all of my heart I want to please the Lord
I know that Im not all I should be
But as long as his word abides in me
Hell cause me to stand
Im in his hand He knows who I am
When that day comes for me to take my rest
All I want to know is that Ive done my best
In spite of the obstacles Ive faced
The countless times Ive fallen in this race
Had it not been for his grace
Gloom would have filled all of my days
All that really matters anymore
Is just to please the Lord
I want to hear Him say
Well done thy good and faithful servant enter into my courts
Well done enter into my joy
I dont know about you or what you want to do
You can have the fame you can make yourself a name
But all that really matters anymore
Is to please the Lord
All that really matters anymore
Is to love the one whom I truly adore
Hes the one that I am living for
And with all of my heart I want to please the Lord. <start> Look at the mercury man in his shoes
Talkin' a lot
But he's still got the blues
Do you like his music
Do you like his music
Say I'd be better if I was like him
What kind of stuck up world are you in
Keeping it out with an attitude
But why
Does the sun come over me
But why
Do I find it hard to breathe
Maybe I'm the one
The one with the attitude
And maybe I'm the one
It's an honest mistake
Look at my head
And you tell me it's wrong
You give me an answer
That doesn't belong
Ah well I'm not so foolish
I know I'm not so foolish
We connect
But we can't relate
Takin' your sunshine out of my rain
Keepin' it out with an attitude
But why
Does the sun come over me
But why
Do I find it hard to breathe
Maybe I'm the one
I'm the one with the attitude
And maybe I'm the one
It's an honest mistake
I stare out at the sun
There's a cloud hanging over you
And maybe I'm the one
It's an honest mistake
Oh yeah
And I know it hurts
When things are not so clear
Oh
But why
'Cause it's not too dark to see
But why
Do I find it hard to separate you
Why
Do I really have to know these things
And why
Did I get here
Maybe I'm the one
The one with the attitude
And maybe I'm the one
It's an honest mistake
I stare out at the sun
There's a cloud hanging over you
And maybe I'm the one
It's an honest mistake
Oh yeah
And I know it hurts
When things are not so clear
And I'm not the kind to take advantage
And I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know <start> She was a girl I loved and married seems like only yesterday
We thought we really had it made when it didn't work out that way
She's gone I'm alone I'm half a man I'm just a usedtobe
All I've got to live for is paper sack full of memories
Old love letters and wornout photograps things left on love's first gleam
Pictures of us on our wedding day what a treasured sight to see
These personal private things I've locked away for my eyes alone to see
For all I've got left there is paper sack full of memories
This paper sack full of memories is all I have to cling to
A little bag full of faded love
We broke apart she locked my heart and she still holds the key
My future my past my whole wide world is paper sack full of memories
Memories memories <start> All's quiet except for this song.
So maybe while I'm not together I can feel like I'm not alone.
And somewhere off in the distance rapidly advancing is an onslaught of sorts.
Young sirens wail with a skewed sense of glory.
And the lions in the cages roar at the memory of flight.
And there's a joy a joy in all I can see.
A joy in every possibility.
And all around this is a great great feeling.
American rockets redglared our most
disgusting triumph.
And in passing I am asked Do you believe in a God
I shrug off the answer and continue to get high in this terror of no explanation.
I am looking for a faith.
My panic is an only reason.
And there's a joy a joy in all I can see.
A joy in every possibility. <start> you said that i didn't turn out right you said i screwed it up you said that it was all for nothing and that I made mistakes from the start take take another look take another look at me you hate all the friends around me but what about all the liars you got you hate everything about me cause you're perfect and i'm not chorus and i can't forget the reasons and i won't forget why i can't bond with you like you said we used to and you ruined a piece of my life now my memories bleed for remembrance smiles with you are pictures in a book and i won't wish we were the way were until you take another look <start> Sunday night and now I know
How the night can pass slow
All kinds of ugly outside that's right
And I'm all alone tonight
Distant highway din
Leaky roof my doubt drips in
And as the streetlights and my prospects dim
She turns in bed and thinks of him
Where's the solace you can find
Is it at the bottom of your mind
My friends pushed me from behind
I feel so empty I could die
A ladder to the edge
Hangover throbs inside my head
And all the stupid things I've ever said
Now make me wish that I was dead
It's nighttime Greenwich Mean time
A man puts on a detour sign
And the waterfalls of regret
Unleash in a torrent of cold sweat <start> From the hills they came
From backwoods without a name
Carrying their guitars and a heart full of southern soul
Down the dusty roads of Caroline
The Tucker boys were friends of mine
They echoed through the lonely pines
Running down the road
And the day the Caldwells died
Before the rugged cross we cried
A voice from deep inside
Said you gotta carry on
And on and
We are brothers of the Southland
Singers in the same band
Spirits on the wind
Standing on this stage together
Our song goes on forever
We're part of Heaven's plan
We're brothers of the Southland
Brothers of the Southland
Tattered old revival tent
And ragged voices heavensent
Singing hallelujah and dancing in the aisles
Ronnie was a barefoot child
An angel's voice and the devil's smile
We only had him for a little while
But the world still sings his songs
And the day the Freebird died
Before the rugged cross we cried
The grey ghost he rides
Said you gotta carry on
And on and
We are brothers of the Southland Singers in the same band
Spirits on the wind
Standing on this stage together
Our song goes on forever
We're part of Heaven's plan
We're brothers of the Southland
Brothers of the Southland
We're brothers of the Southland
And the day Duane Allman died
With Barry Oakley by his side
They took one last midnight ride
We are brothers of the Southland
Singers in the same band
Spirits on the wind
Standing on this stage together
A bridge across forever
We're part of Heaven's plan
We're brothers of the Southland
Brothers of the Southland
Brothers of the Southland
We're brothers of the Southland <start> The search has gone on through the ages
Searching for the Promised Land
The Lord said build up the pages
Preachers have taken their stand
So many hearts that was lost in the dark
Til I saw the light in your eyes
When I'm with you there's no doubt
That I found her at last
CHORUS
Heaven is wherever you are
It's not a faraway place
It's a state of the heart
So I look to the stars but I don't have to go that far
Heaven is wherever you are
I lay by your side in the moonlight
And wonder how a man could be so blessed
An angel like you holding me tight
You've chosen me above all the rest
You've shown me a path to a love everlasting
The answer to all my prayers
Everybody's dying to find it and we're already there
REPEAT CHORUS  TIMES <start> That's right my name is Danny Boy and I like to drink at night.
I go down to the pub wherein I buy myself a pind or three.
I like to go out drinking 'cause beer it is my life
Until I come home and lay eyes upon my darling wife.
And they say
Oh Danny won't you go home earlier tonight
Your daugher doesn't know you
And your giving us a fright when you say...
Say something's wrong with anyone who's not lik eme.
With you the violence just comes so easily.
You never learn I have to teach you constantly.
Hush now.
That's right my name is Danny Boy and I'll buy another round.
Then off to the marked when this place closes down.
I say drinking's always done when the sun's up in the sky.
The sun is always up somwhere
And it's your turn to buy and they say
Oh Danny won't you go home earlier tonight
Your son he doesn't know you and your giving us a fright when you say
Say somthing's wrong with anyone who's not like me.
With you the violence just comes so easily.
You never learn I have to teach you constantly.
Hush now.
Hush now.
Sleep.
Sleep floating child.
..This is affectionate. <start> Boy we get so excited pointing fingers each day
Don't take the time to even blame me
No we'll give it away
The expectations that we're painting
They go from paisley to white
I see right through them stand up to them
Oh and I'm up for the fight
Chorus 
And with these eyes I never see right
Ooh When I look in the mirror
I'm lost in golden red and blue
I'm losing ground standing up to you
And I Understand more than I want to
And I stand more than I choose
And under these eyes I'm busted
But I'm Understanding you
It's the Understanding that kills me
So I return into my head
and I begin to see
This image is not the place for me
Is it someplace for you
'Cause the destination is never changing
When I guess a change could do
When I try to move I fall try to hold you and I lose it all
 <start> I met a man
And talked about you
He seemed like a man from Osaka I knew
And he listened while I told him how you hurt me
And he consoled me when he told me he'd been hurt too
And he said we are interdependent
And the effects on each other never ending
And that the air has no boundaries
I think this water that surrounds me
Is the same water soaking through to you
So what comes floating to me
Eventually
Will come floating back to you
What comes floating to me
Eventually
Will come floating back to you
I had some tea
With a gal from Paris
We talked about life sex love and poetry
And you can't help it
Your name came up again
And she said man those kind of guys
Really know how to steal all of the oxygen
And I said we are interdependent
And the effects on each other never ending
And that the air has no boundaries
I think this water that surrounds me
Is the same water soaking' through to you
So what comes floating to me
Eventually
Will come floating back to you
What comes floating to me
Eventually
Will come floating back to you
I have a friend I confide in
He always says 'doll you got to learn not to lead with your chin'
But you can't help it
It all comes up again
And then you have your fill
And your spill reaches down as far as a flood
So what comes floating to me
Eventually
Will come floating back to you
What comes floating to me
Eventually
Will come floating back to you
Eventually
Eventually
Will come floating back to you
Eventually
Eventually <start> We're all here we're all the same open your eyes don't play their game fighting each other nothing's to gain fight the system not each other they control your lives when we should be fighting the system that fucks up why are we so busy fighting each other open your mouth but do not close your eyes a sound called unity if we stand together we've gotta stop the violence in our scene and holds us down with the shackles that bound there's a new sound comin down from the underground and focus our hate on the state till they hear our screams we'll never be torn apart by hatred <start>

  <start> When you smile
I fall to my knees
Because you make me complete
Every time
I look at your face
I never want to leave this place
And we live in crazy times
And we're we're so far apart and I
I've fallen for you fallen for you
And we live in crazy times
And we're we're so far apart and I
I've fallen for you fallen for you
But I
I want you to see
Hey this is me
Don't cry
Whenever I leave
Ill be back when you call me
And we live in crazy times
And we're we're so far apart and I
I've fallen for you fallen for you <start> At first I was afraid.
I was petrified.
I kept thinking I could never live
Without you by my side.
But then I spent so many nights
Just thinking how you'd done me wrong.
I grew strong.
I learned how to get along.
And so you're back from outer space.
I just walked in to find you here
Without that look upon your face.
I should have changed my fucking lock.
I would have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me.
Go on now go.
Walk out the door.
Just turn around now.
You're not welcome anymore.
Weren't you the one
Who tried to break me with desire
Did you think I'd crumble
Did you think I'd lay down and die
Oh not I.
I will survive.
As long as I know how to love
I know I'll be alive.
I've got all my life to live.
I've got all my love to give.
I will survive.
I will survive.
It took all the strength I had
Just not to fall apart.
I'm trying hard to mend
The pieces of my broken heart.
And I spent oh so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself.
I used to cry.
But now I hold my head up high.
And you'll see me with somebody new.
I'm not that stupid little person
Still in love with you.
And so you thought you'd just drop by
And you expect me to be free.
But now I'm saving all my lovin'
For someone who's lovin' me.
Go on now go.
Walk out the door.
Just turn around now.
You're not welcome anymore.
Weren't you the one
Who tried to break me with desire
Did you think I'd crumble
Did you think I'd lay down and die
Oh not I.
I will survive.
As long as I know how to love
I know I'll be alive.
I've got all my life to live.
I've got all my love to give.
I will survive.
I will survive. <start> Moonlight eyes  you can break my spell
I never thought that you wanna be mine
I could not trust my eyes on that Saturday night
Holdign you in the moonshine
Light and shade  close together sometimes
But you fade all the shadows away
I feel the spirit of passion burnin' in me so let me say
Dance in the starlight light up the dark night
I'll never want to let you go
Dance in the starlight and light up my life
Oh our love will live and grow  live and grow
Under the roof of god all our prayers come true
Being one with the universe
Midnight wind will blow my promise to you
Let us embrace our mother earth
Losing time  losing space  in this hot summer night
Our witness will be our brother moon
Watching out for us sending words with the wind
Listen to it's Midnight tune
Dance in the starlight light up the dark night
I'll never want to let you go
Dance in the starlight and light up my life
Oh our love will live and grow
I'll never want to let you go
Dance in the starlight
Oh our love will live and grow
Dance in the starlight light up the dark night
I'll never want to let you go
Dance in the starlight and light up my life
Oh our love will live and grow
Dance in the starlight light up the dark night
I'll never want to let you go
Dance in the starlight
Starlight  I'll never want to let you go <start> 
Telephone lover can't tell you my name
Just a credit card number and a picture of your face
Gonna turn the lights down come on whisper in my ear
You know a nasty kind of story the kinds I like to hear
I'm lying here just thinking where I'd like to be
Right now with lady answer me inside the magazine
Let my fingers do the walking want to get me a tryst
I'm a telephone lover and a lover at last
Dirty secrets zipped up tight dirty secrets gonna let it out tonight
I got lead in my pencil and that ain't no joke
My patience ain't for writing your lips they ought to know
With a quiver in my voice take the bull my the horn
It's down below the satin sheet where I keep it nice and warm
It's a good for planning want to ride hot and hard
So open the runway I'm gonna shoot for a star
With a finger on your button slippery when wet
Gonna tell you hot mamma it's a ride you won't forget
I've got a dirty secret zipped up tight dirty secret gonna let it out tonight
Dirty secret what more can I say dirty secret let me fire away
Solo
It's a good night for planning wanna ride hot and hard
So open up the runway I'm gonna shoot for a star
With a finger on your button gonna see what I get
Gonna tell you hot mamma it's a ride you won't forget
I've got a dirty dirty secret I've got a dirty dirty secret
I've got a dirty dirty secret I've got a dirty dirty
I've got a dirty dirty secret I've got a dirty dirty
I've got a dirty dirty secret I've got a dirty dirty
I've got a dirty dirty secret I've got a dirty dirty oh <start> Welcome to the last time
That You can buy my answer
With less than a question
I would sell the hands off my wrists
If they weren't so preoccupied
With taking the bread from Your fingers
And downing this cheap new years wine
That we call Your blood
And You can wait for midnight
But my lips are sealed
And You can wait for midnight
But my lips are sealed
In this garden I'm waiting anxiously
For my children to come and murder me
In this crowded room staring nervously
Lovers lick at their lips and wait for the kiss
I've been sharpening
My teeth for this moment
And I'll stab with my lips
But You've already won <start> That could be me that could be me Walking down the Seine
Where I'd throw my glasses away
That could be us that could be us Walking through the garden
Watch the flowers melt together
Boats reflected in the river
The picture on my wall
Your picture in my wallet
Blurry and beyond
If I stare and stare
Maybe I'll be there
And we'd walk through
Breathe through open mouth
I don't care what they say <start> Love makes all the difference in the world
I was drowned in a world full of emptiness
I was bored to death with life because of loneliness
Happiness for me seemed all in vain
But love reached out her hand when I was going down the drain
I kissed her hungry lips and they turned me on
A flavor like no other lips I've ever known
Heaven opened up the door and there she was
And she was much much more than I've been dreaming of
Love makes the difference all the difference in the world
Love's the ray of sunshine the blessing from above
And I've thought the girl was just another girl
But love makes all the difference in the world <start> so hold yourself together
ive been good but youve been better
now that all our misdirection is left right on me
on the car ride home you tell me
i was lost could you please tell me
broken down and broken off from you inside
well ive been waiting for my longing soul to say
and shes been holding on for a reason then i might stay
if you hold yourself together ive been writing you this letter
stating all the things you needed me to say
and so ahhh aint it funny how it used to be
like a brokedown memory tonight 
so staying on is hard to do
but breaking down is long over due
and i tend to leave my whoas behind
well ive been waiting for my longing soul to say
and shes been holding on for a reason then i might stay
if you hold yourself together ive been writing you this letter
stating all the things you needed me to say
if you hold yourself together ive been writing you this letter
stating all the things you needed me to say
and so ahhh aint it funny how it used to be
like a brokedown memory tonight  <start> Say what you want about Elvis
Call him the king
It's one thing to die for a people
And another just to sing
Say that the devil's a genius
And be marked for the kill
Say what you want about Yahweh
And He'll love you still
Say what you want
Pray to God
Say that as long as you don't inhale
You can take your little toke
Say that there ought to be a sin tax
Then we're all going broke
You can say that there ought to be a judgment
And someone's gonna pay
And hope that there's nobody listening
To all the things that you say <start> Langour rises reaching to turn off the alarm
And there's never so much seething
That it can't be disarmed
You just stop it up
Pass it on
Shove it to shelf it
To leave it off and turnover
Lounging against your weapons
Until your muscles find lock
In the ease of that position
A residue of tremor passes
As some cherie amour suggests
That maybe it was time to smash things up
But just stop it up
Pass it on
Shove it to shelf it
To lead it on and turnover
I'm only sleeping <start> I sit back and I close my eyes
Lookin' back at all the lows and all the highs
Through the black and white and in between
All the miles I've walked the wars I've fought and all I've seen
It all seems like yesterday like a bird time just flies
No sooner than you said hello its time its time its time to say goodbye
Consumed by worry stress and fear never learning to live
Weighed down by wondering why we're here
Collected memories all that's in the end
I guess a sense of peace wasn't meant for some my friend
It all seems like yesterday
Like a bird time just flies
No sooner than you said hello
Its time its time its time to say goodbye <start> Idle juvenile on the street on the street
Who is kicking everything with his feet with his feet
Fighting on the wrong side of the law of the law
Don't kick don't fight don't sleep at night
It's shake a leg shake a leg shake a leg shake it yeah
Keeping out of trouble with eyes in the back of my face
Kicking ass in the class and they tell me you're a damn disgrace
They tell me what they think but they stink and I really don't care
Got a mind of my own move on get out of my hair
Shake a leg shake your head
Shake a leg wake the dead
Shake a leg get stuck in
Shake a leg shake a leg yeah
Magazines wet dreams dirty women on machines for me
Big licks skin flicks tricky dick's are my chemistry
Goin' against the grain trying to keep me sane with you
So stop your grinnin' and drop your linen for me
Shake a leg shake your head
Shake a leg wake the dead
Shake a leg get stuck in
Shake a leg shake a leg yeah shake it

I'm torn apart by words that you have said
All in all I know we're falling apart
Where did you run to so far away
Here we are to sing you a song
There you are asleep against the window pane
Just like always
You said you like to hear the rain sometimes
All I can do is tell you the truth
And oh my eyes will tell you the same

Midsummer magic when the night turns to day
And songbirds greet the dawn
You lie awake
You watch and wonder while the moon fades away
And one more day is born.
Tides keep on turning while hearts keep on yearning
To be where they know they belong
All on a new day you see in a new way
The things you've been leaning upon.
Moonlight and gold
I will awaken to a love that runs deeper
Than the need in me.
While you are sleeping the new day comes creeping
And life keeps on passing you by
Magic unfolds when the blue meets the gold
And the sun comes to open your eyes.
Moonlight and gold
Midsummer magic when the night turns to day
And songbirds greet the dawn
You lie awake
You watch and wonder while the moon fades away
And one more day is born.
Oh yeah

Jumped to my feet
Ran to the window
And down in the street
The paperboy was jumpin'
Like a monkey on a leash
Yellin' read all about it
Read all about it
Slow burn in L.A. town
Slow burn in L.A. town
Down on Sunset
In the summertime
It gets so hot you think you're goin' blind
Little girls all dressed up
And they're ready to go out
Makes me wanna shout
Makes me wanna shout
Slow burn in L.A. town
Slow burn in L.A. town
You've got nowhere to go
No one to go there with
Ain't nobody cares about anything you did
Lookin' for trouble
You've got plenty on your mind
Now we'll read all about it
Read all about it baby <start> Listen when I say when I say it's real
Real life goes undefined why must you be so miserable
Everything you take makes me more unreal
Real lines are undefined how can this be so miserable
Under the summer rain I burnt away
Under the summer rain you turned away


Listen I can't make make a sound or feel
Feel fine I kissed the lies why must they be so distant Whoa
Listen as I break break the four wall seal
Gorgeous eyes shine suicide when will we be invisible
Under the summer rain I burnt away
Under the summer rain we burned away

Under the summer rain I burnt away
Under the summer rain you turned away

This is the fall this is the long way down
And our lives look smaller now and our lives look so small

This is the fall this is the long way down
And our lives look smaller now and our lives look so small
Under the summer rain I burnt away
Under the summer rain we burned away

Under the summer rain I burnt away
Under the summer rain we burned away

Under the summer rain I burnt away

Under the summer rain you turned away
 <start> I would live for you
And break my heart in two
I would give for you
Like only fools would do
I would hear you out
And tell you all I could
I would take your doubts
And show you what I should
Let me break
Let me break you down
For your sake
I will break you down
I would try for you
Try to walk you through
I would fight for you
To prove that I am true
Let me break
Let me break you down
For your sake
I will break you down
Break break down
I would use for you
Alleviate your pain
I would lose for you
Again and again
Let me break for your sake
Let me break
Let me break you down
For your sake
I will break you down
Break break you down <start> All that I've come to feeling
Is a plastic wig  All that is grown
Is a plastic doll
Days so excited
All is just the things
All all
Come down and see us win
Keepers caught in clear  
All those good times
Is it much too fast
Deep inside the train
So imagination takes you there
And it's something strange
And it's something strange
And it's something strange
And it's something strange
And it's something strange
And it's something strange
And it's something strange
And it's something strange
Something strange <start> If you're feeling lazy have another Sunday
If you could have a good slacking around for me to please you
The job can wait til Tuesday maybe even Thursday
Let it go mystical
Even this dump seems cool with you baby
Our love could not be better we'll always be together
What cha got not a lot not a lot of nothing always with you baby
Ain't it the truth baby
We're the happiest fools baby
Without a clue baby
And no particular use
Trying to be satirical on any given lyrical
If we can maybe yeah sleep through the rest of the day with you baby
So if you're feeling lazy come on won't you baby
Here we go just for show just for the fun of being dumb like you baby
Ain't it the truth baby
We're the happiest fools baby
Without a clue baby
And no particular use
And if the man comes to take us both away
I could do you yeah you could do Saturdays
We'll steal another room another hideaway
Laughing at all the people saying what do you do
Ain't it the truth baby
We're the happiest fools baby
Without a clue baby
And no particular use <start> How can you lose what you never had
I tell myself when I'm feeling sad
You don't have the right to cry
You believed your own lie
It's your fault because
You thought that she was yours
Think it over once think it over twice
I wish I could take my own advice
I know I should be glad why does it hurt so bad
How can you lose what you never had
You don't have the right to cry
You believed your own lie
It's your fault because
You thought that she was yours
Think it over once think it over twice
I wish I could take my own advice
I know I should be glad why does it hurt so bad
How can you lose what you never had
How can you lose what you never had <start> Tell me baby
Have we lost everything that we had before
What do you do in the day
When I walk out the door
I can see you made up your mind
And I know our love's on the line
Love's on the line our love's on the line
Love's on the line our love's on the line
Love's on the line our love's on the line
With each passing day
I gotta watch more and more what I say to you
I can feel your eyes looking through me
As I sit at the table at dinnertime
I can feel our love's on the line
Love's on the line our love's on the line
Love's on the line our love's on the line
Love's on the line our love's on the line
I watch our kids
Growin' up going to school
Is there anything else for us now
Are we both just fools
Wasting our precious time
At night we lay in bed
But it's like you're not even there
There's something real bad
Going wrong somewhere
Last night I heard you cry
And I know our love's on the line
Love's on the line our love's on the line
Love's on the line our love's on the line
Love's on the line our love's on the line
Love's on the line <start> Our lives are hanging in the balance
Or they're dangling by a thread
A spark of life brought down from an angel
To raise the stranger from the dead
Once more we're cheating on the reaper
With all the gypsy in our souls
Cause I know there's a God up in heaven
Who must love rock and roll
Once again we sail home to Sarasota
As the ocean awash the gunwale
But she still keeps her head above water
Guess we're all gonna live to tell this tale
And here's to the you for always hangin' in
Without you there's no reason to go
I'd be lying face down in some river
Waiting on an angel to take me back home
Once again we sail home to Sarasota
with the ocean awash the gunwale
But she still keeps her head above water
Guess we're all gonna live to tell this tale
Solo
Once again we sail home to Sarasota
with the ocean awash the gunwale
But she still keeps her head above water
Guess we're all gonna live to tell this tale <start> you feel around that way
you slowly feel nothing
you run around that way
you slowly fell your way with nothing
you slowly get your wish
you feel like nothing
you filtered through nothing
you feel like nothing ive ever felt before
you stand up right through them
you filter right through them <start> I have my reasons
For the vices I embrace.
Our world of treasons
And out there on the escape.
No one else here
This conversation's been drowned here.
Sixteen is nothing
And never will be til I'm dead.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you baby.

Take all the hands that need you lately.

I don't wanna wait I don't wanna wait
On you anymore.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you baby.
Daydream that the world stands still.
Dancing through the fibers of time.
Baby I just want to hold
Something that was never meant to be mine.
I look to heaven to save me
And you call me naive.
Gravity a hopeless lover
Cursed with disbelief.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you baby.

Take all the hands that need you lately.

I don't wanna wait I don't wanna wait
On you anymore.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you baby.
Dance and kill me now
To word's that I've chose
Speak only when you are spoken to.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you baby.

Take all the hands that need you lately.

I don't wanna wait I don't wanna wait
On you anymore.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you baby.
Don't' bite the hand that feeds you baby.

Don't bite the hand that feeds you baby.

Don't fight the hands that need you lately. <start> England seemed like such a beautiful place from afar
Until one day I went and saw how miserabely how things really are
All fantastic images they only are apparent
Propagated just by hope and desire to share it
Beauty was the allure that brought me close to you
Loneliness was the bond that made me stick like glue
All fantastic images they only are apparent
Promoted by desperate hope that things are somewhere better
I don't have a thing against fantasy
But to chase it down just don't make sense to me
If you're only hope is simply peace and love
You end up discarding most of what you're made of
All fantastic images they only are apparent
Promoted by desperate hope
And the need to share it <start> It gets out
Feeling slow watching everyone is passing by
And I'm still here is this worth
All the stress and come around
'Cuz I'm still down everything is so confusing
Competition swallows me
From a life where what you hear ain't always what you see
Competition worries me
Brings out the best in you and the worst in me
Caught this time in the middle
Come and find a common ground
Everyone seems to be staring am I wrong
Indecision I don't know who I've become
And I'm not sure who you are either
Competition swallows me
From a life where what you hear ain't always what you see
Competition worries me
Brings out the best in you and the worst in me
I suppose you have some games
That you would love to play with me
I sure do would you like to try
Be my guest
Competition swallows me
From a life where what you hear ain't always what you see
Competition worries me
Brings out the best in you <start> The rage in my eyes
could have compared to the eye of a sun
Then rain
took it's course through the hands of the Son
Repent for all time
the world is at war leaving all
fault behind
So is this the end for us my friend
So is this the end for us my friend
The stains in the sky
are there to remind us of man and his fight
When two worlds collide
one steals the life like a thief in the night
So look to the sky
He hold the keys for your life and mine
So is this the end for us my friend
So is this the end for us my friend
So is this the end for us my friend
Well as though we rise
as the day breaks the dawn
and as the moon hides the sun
Oh the sun
No more sorrow
All those crying days are gone
No more sorrow now it's gone
Now it's gone
Now it's gone
So is this the end for us my friend
So is this the end for us my friend
So is this the end for us my friend
So is this the end for us my friend
So is this the end for us my friend <start> Someday things will be familiar streets
All the half built houses gone to home.
You will know what no one teaches you
Now well see that kids need learning
Hoping that I have some good advice.
Something you could win with something true
Not exactly sure just what Id do.
You think its rock and roll or something
I know what to tell you.
That theres many in new way
That I hope you know I love you
We wont have to go home pretty again.
Someday things will be familiar streets
All the other things turning in your head.
Whistling through your life and wave that wing
What currently called science fiction
I dont want to tell you that theres many new way
And I will deserve the blind stare
We wont have to go home pretty again
I dont want to tell you
That theres many in new way
And I will deserve the blind stare
We wont have to go home pretty again.
Its the break out its brand new open wide
Break out brand new open wide.
Break out brand new open wide. <start> Give me an inch and I'll take a while
Forever out of step and I'll restall
I can talk without mumbling
I can't walk without stumbling
Love gone back forgotten
I'm broken and locked in
I tried a lie always fail
Keep expectations low
It's a way out
I get along to anything but myself now
I can't talk with mumbling
I can't talk without stumbling
Not gone back forgotten
I'm broken and locked in
I tried a lied of
I feel done for you
and all that you do
feel done for you
and your have love is gone soon
is feeding mine demise <start> live at A.A. tour
You you you make me live my
happy heart
to my love
and now you're gone
since I fell for you
Love brings my misery pain
cause I'll never be the same
since I fell for you yeah baby
since your love <start> The world  the world has changed its old face
From blue to grey if you watch it from space
Oh mother earth you're giving sun  you're giving rain
Without a hope there will be nothing to remain
How could we sleep so quietly
Why are we sure we can survive
I can see the desert
I'm gonna miss the rain
I can see the desert
I will go insane
Go out  out there to turn back the wheel
of time of fate of my destiny
So take this chance nobody will show you the way
and if you don't  if you don't we'll fade away
How could we sleep so quietly
Why are we sure we can survive
I can see a desert
I'm gonna miss the rain
I can see a desert
I will go insane
How could we sleep so quietly
Why are we sure we can survive
I can see a desert
I'm gonna miss the rain
I can see a desert
I will go insane <start> There's someone coming down for you Rudy
There's someone coming down for you
There's someone coming down for you Rudy
There's someone coming down for you
I do it for you don't you know that
I do it for you
I do it for you don't you know that
You know I do it for you
You're causing problems in this town
Drinking drugs acting the clown
I hope some day you realise
You can't be living your life through these eyes. <start> You look into his eyes so sweetly
The way I wish you look in mine
But baby I can't help but notice
That all he wants is to take advantage
Of everything you've got
I know it's not my place to say girl
But I've had to see them tears fall
One too many times
But I guess you can see more than I can
You found somethin' good in him
And I don't wanna stand in your way
Cause you know I would walk through hell
A thousand times just to see your smile
It'd be worth all my pain
So I guess I'll just sit here
And watch my whole world walk away
And girl I wish I could say that all I wanted
Was just to be your friend
That would make everything alright
But I know that would be a lie
I'll always want that something more
That's just too strong to fight
To see you start to fall for someone else
It makes me wanna cry
But I pray to God that he treats you right
But I guess you can see more than I can
You found somethin' good in him
And I don't wanna stand in your way
Cause you know I would walk through hell
A thousand times just to see your smile
It'd be worth all my pain
And so I guess I'll just sit here
And watch my whole world walk away
I watch you walk away
Mmmmmhmmmmhmmmm <start> So long to young love I've anchored my heart
Farewell to small joys I've burned down the bar
I'm changing my name so I don't do no harm
Some say it's vanity some say it's charm
No levels still the same old devils
Frightened of fear a servant of time
Kidnapped the queen I have angered the hive
Snuffed out the stars with celestial winds
Ended a cycle that started again
I stopped going out they kept coming in
Was I saving my soul or saving my skin
No levels still the same old devils
Can't hold it close can't let it go
Prisons in basements in slick model homes
I'm just a daytripper on sacred terrain
My transformation went from mangled to tame
I don't feel different but I don't feel the same
I'm afloat with an ear to the ground
I built a fortress with some books and a phrase
I felt some heat so I came out of the haze
I saw the end and I was truly afraid
I have begged but I'm still not allowed
It's a trap lay the bait catch the rat
It's a trap lay the bait catch the rat
Flew home and left the unknown in the lurch
Kept finding bodies I called off the search
Went to a hymn from a funeral dirge
Church in the hospital dog in the church
No levels still the same old devils
Shepherd me back this time I know
I don't know nothing I'm not in control
Mindful but gutless
Mindful but gutless
Mindful but gutless
Mindful but gutless
There's no need to panic
No need to panic <start> Everybody knows when he's coming to town
They're locking the doors
And they don't make a sound
People want him dead but he won't die yet
First he's got to live
With the things that he did
People want him leaving
But he isn't leaving soon
He gets him some smokes
And some hoes
And a hotel room
Then you best duck when he's through
He's clinching his fists
And he's lookin' for you
'Cause Darren's got an appetite
For lightin' dynamite
And letting it
Blow up in his hands
'Cause Darren's got an appetite
For lightin' dynamite
And letting it
Blow up in his hands
Ava's got a Frank Sinatra tune
Ava's got the sun
And the wind
And the moon
Ava's got a lawyer
And a baller
And a foot taller
And a bullfighter from Spain too
But I guess you could never forget
The way she moves
She removes your stress
You ain't got a clue 'bout nothing like this
That's what she says
And she means what she says
See Ava's got an appetite
For lightin' dynamite
And letting it blow up in her hand
See Ava's got an appetite
For lightin' dynamite
And letting it blow up in her hand <start> The gold verandah in the dark has gone
down to the metal man.
No better time to leave the ground
And maybe try to understand.
You gotta hold on to somethin' that you believe
Hold on to somethin' that makes you feel alright.
And through the darkest times of your life
You always tried to be the one
And now the times have made you wonder
If you ever knew what was goin' on.
You gotta hold on to somethin' that you believe
Hold on to somethin' that makes you feel alright....
Alright alright alright alright alright.
 Alright ... alright ... alright
No use thinkin' about what you ain't got
Just makes you bitter.
And as you speak everything that you say
Goes out on the big transmitter.
You gotta hold on to somethin' that you believe
Hold on to somethin' that makes you feel alright....
Alright alright alright alright alright.
You gotta hold on to somethin' that you believe
Hold on to somethin' that makes you feel alright....
Alright alright alright alright alright.
Alright alright alright alright alright. <start> Too many nights I've sat around and wondered
Where can my baby be
I can't explain this feelin' how my heart's been reelin'
Or what's come over me
Ah but this much I know if this is how it's gonna go
It's gonna be tough
Ain't no spell I'm under it just makes me wonder
Is love enough
Is love enough to keep you happy
Is there a bottom line and can there ever be
Anyone else for you but me
Is love enough to make you mine I've gotta know
Is love enough is love enough
Is love enough I said is love enough
Don't get me wrong now woman
I'm not gonna drown in misery
If you don't want what I'm givin' I'll go on livin'
'Cause somewhere there's an angel for me
But I just can't tell is this heaven or hell
It sure is rough
So I'll ask you again please answer me friend
Is love enough
Is love enough to move this mountain
'Cause the Lord knows I've tried and tried
No matter how strong be the weather yeah we'll stick together
If love's enough to keep you satisfied I've gotta know
Is love enough is love enough
Is love enough is love enough <start> Up in smoke that's where my money goes
In my lungs and sometimes up my nose
When troubled times begin to bother me
I take a toke and all my cares go up in smoke
Up in smoke donde todos es mi rey
There are no signs que dice no fumer
So I roll un Bomber y me doy un buen tokeay
Y despues I choke y todos mis cares go up in smoke
Come on let's go get high
Up in smoke that's where I wanna be
'Cause when I'm high the world below don't bother me
When life begins to be one long and dangerous road
I take a toke and all my cares go up in smoke
I take a toke and all my cares go up in smoke <start> I watch the clouds through my window
sail across the sky
And underneath the canopy
gulls they wheel and glide
The shoreline stretches endlessly
along these windswept plains
I wander through this barren land
where solitude remains
I've made myself a universe
in this faroff home
Unseen from the outside world
here I live and roam
And though I've tried assiduously
to heal the wounds with time
you'll haunt me in my memories until I die
If I should meet you after all these years
how could I find the words
I'd greet you with silence and with tears
for all the time we've lost
The days get shorter as weeks pass
summer turns to fall
The birds will cease to sing and chant
and follow with the call
It's getting clearer and the truth
unsparingly reveals
I've drifted imperceptibly out to sea <start> Sound the bugle now
Play it just for me
As the seasons change remember how I used to be
Now I can't go on I can't even start
I've got nothing left
just an empty heart
I'm a soldier
Wounded so I must give up the fight
There's nothing more for me
Lead me away
Or leave me lying here
Sound the bugle
Tell them I don't care
There's not a road I know that leads to anywhere
Without a light I feel that I will stumble in the dark
Lay right down
Decide not to go on
Then from on high
Somewhere in the distance
There's a voice that calls remember who your are
If you lose yourself
Your courage soon will follow
So be strong tonight
Remember who you are <start> Instrumental <start> Time to call another girl in town time to take all of your pictures down
It's time to let them know I'm still around
Wish I had the words to say it right  the show is over
Let's just say goodnight and all the feelings that were locked inside
Are free
Cause it's the
First time in a long time I'm here on my own
And I'm finding reasons  to carry on strong
There's no easy way to leave it all behind
Cause it's the
First time in a long time
I'll be all right
I might just take a ride on the open sea a million miles from where I used to be
With every step I take I do believe ..oh
I see my whole world from the inside out one more reason not to cry out loud
A new beginning and I'll find my way somehow
Now it's the .
First time in a long time I'm here on my own
And I'm finding reasons  to carry on strong
There's no easy way to leave it all behind
Cause it's the
First time in a long time
I'll be all right
I could tell you my story bout the hell I've been through oh yeah
I've been praying for the answers and all that really matters
Is coming out of the blue
Cause it's the
First time in a long time I'm here on my own
And I'm finding reasons  to carry on strong
There's no easy way to leave it all behind
Cause it's the
First time in a long time
It's the  first time in a long time
It's the  first time in a long time
But I'll be all right I'll be all right
Time to call another girl in town <start> I could hang about and burn my fingers
I've been hanging out here waiting for something to start
You think I'm faultless to a 't'
My manner set impeccably
But underneath I am the same as you
I could dance all night like I'm a soul boy
But I know I'd rather drag myself across the dance floor
I feel like dancing on my own
Where no one knows me and where i
Can cause offence just by the way I look
And when I come to blows
When I am numbering my foes
Just hope that you are on my side my dear
But it's best to finish as it started
With my face head down just staring at the brown formica
It's safer not to look around
I can't hide my feelings from you now
There's too much love to go around these days <start> It was three o'clock in the afternoon we were in a cafe
You ordered what you usually do
I looked in your eyes you looked down in that moment
What you couldn't say baby I already knew
It's either you or me and I don't wanna be
The one who makes believe for too long
I don't wanna be the one this time
I don't wanna watch us fall apart
Gonna have to leave it all behind
Even if it breaks my heart
No I don't wanna watch us fade
But how can we remain the way we are
Guess I'll have to turn and walk away
Even if it breaks my heart
I gave all I had everything I had needed you to give it back
Tell me was that too much to ask
Felt it on your lips empty kisses have a story all their own
How I wish it wasn't so
True love often dies and someone always tries
To keep it alive for too long
I don't wanna be the one this time
I don't wanna watch us fall apart
Gonna have to leave it all behind
Even if it breaks my heart
No I don't wanna watch us fade
But how can we remain the way we are
Guess I'll have to turn and walk away
Even if it breaks my heart
Lord knows I've tried so hard standing in front of you
Knowing that this is goodbye
I don't wanna be the one this time
I don't wanna watch us fall apart
Gonna have to leave it all behind
Even if it breaks my heart
I don't wanna let you go
How can we remain the way we are
Guess I'll have to turn and walk away
Even if it breaks my heart
I don't wanna be the one this time
I don't wanna watch us fall apart
Gonna have to leave it all behind
Even if it breaks my heart
No I don't wanna watch us fade
But how can we remain the way we are
Guess I'll have to turn and walk away
Even if it breaks my heart
Even if it breaks my heart oh no
Even if it breaks my heart
I gotta walk away
Yeah yeah it's gonna break my heart <start> Then when you let it
You asked for nothing
Why don't you share it
All of the time you live
There's something out there
Just want to know how far to live on
This one will ever know in this town
And in the red room
At a distance
How would you know it
You're the same when you're living
I don't know it
It won't be this
Just want to know how far to live on
Just want to know how far to I've on
All of the time you wait there's someone out there
And no one can find all the red
How would you show it
You can see through the red
I don't know it
It won't be this time <start> I don't know this person in front of me
I knew you one but then you departed
A vicious circle a lashing to your brain
Look at you now you're back where you started
Is this all you ever wanted
Is this all you'll ever be
Cause you'll get none
And you've undone the good you've just done
Why can't you just live without the needs
A muted blur of a life that's shattered
A losing battle this feud within your brain
A perfect life where nothing mattered
Everything turns to grey
You take yourself through the pain
You never ever see the things
Is this all you'll ever be
Everything's a transparency
And you'll get none
You're undone
You're back where you started <start> Take it easy take it slow oh
Get on with the show ah
That's what I know
I woke in a cold sweat last night
Seems what's been good for the music
Hasn't always been so good for the life
I've thrown my phone in a pool
In New Orleans
Found the love of my life again
Y'all knows what I means
And I'll be back on your sofa in a puddle in a couple of weeks oh yeah
I can't tell what you're sayin'
When you yell
At the same time
You could be tellin' me the story of your life
Your life
Is my malfunction so surprising
'Cause I always seem so stable and bright
Ain't it always the quiet types
I've thrown my phone in a pool
In New Orleans
Found the love of my life again
Y'all knows what I means
And I'll be back on your sofa in a puddle in a couple of weeks
I won't I won't I won't I won't blame New Orleans
Can't you people function for a little while
Without me bouncin' off the satellite for a night
Drink it faster drink it slow
That's what I know
When you've gotten to the bottom of it it's time to go
And when you flip  feet feel free to proffer your advice
But until that time here's my autoreply
I've thrown my phone in a pool
In New Orleans
Found the love of my life again
Y'all knows what I means
And I'll be back on your sofa in a puddle in a couple of weeks
That's what I know
That's what I know <start> 
Well it's a chilly chilly evening
And you're burning with desire
Get it up get it up get it up and go
I've been doin calestenics
Just to try to get in shape now
Get it up get it up get it up and go
The set is on and I'm watching a show
But I can do it if you really must know
I should of known by you actions
What you're disposition's geared for
But I've had a busy morning
And my cranium is getting sore
Because I've got a splitting hedachi
And I don't wanna serve you now
Oh I've got a splitting hedachi
Now
You said that you would give me head
But I'd rather watch johnny instead
Well it's pushin 
And you're feelin really dirty yeah
You got my hand on my member
And you're tryin to get a tremor yeah
I can't stand it now the pain is so bad
But it's the worst thing a guy ever had
Chorus <start> Irgendwann kommt fr jeden der Tag
an dem man fr alles bezahlt
dann stehen wir da
denken wie schn es mal war
bereuen unsere Fehler htten gern alles anders gemacht
htten all unsere Boshaftigkeiten niemals getan
wir leben versteckt
wischen all unsere Spuren weg
vor den anderen und vor uns selbst
damit kein Mensch jemals sieht
wer wir in Wahrheit sind
Wo ist der Ort fr den ehrlichsten Kuss
ich wei das ich ihn fr uns finden muss
auf 'ner Strae im Regen
auf 'nem Berg nah beim Mond
oder kann man ihn nur vom Totenbett holen
Wo ist der Ort fr einen ehrlichen Kuss
den Einzigen den ich dir noch geben muss
All denen die uns am nchsten stehen
tun wir am liebsten weh
und die Frage warum das so ist
bleibt unser Leben lang stehen
Wann ist die Zeit fr einen ehrlichen Kuss
der all unsere Lgen auslschen muss
gib mir die Zeit fr einen ehrlichen Kuss
so wollen wir uns kssen wenigstens am Schluss
es wird ein Kuss sein der alles verzeiht
der alles vergibt und uns beide befreit
du musst ihn mir schenken ich bin zwar ein Dieb
doch gestohlen ist er wertlos und dann brauch ich ihn nicht <start> In the east the wind is blowing the boats across the sea
And their sails will fill the morning and their cries ring out to me
Oh the more it changes the more it stays the same
And the hand just rearranges the players in the game
Oh I had a dream
It seemed I stood alone
And the veil of all the years
Goes sinking from my eyes like a stone
A king shall fall and put to death by the English parliament shall be
Fire and plague to London come in the year of six and twenties three
An emperor of France shall rise who will be born near Italy
His rule cost his empire dear Napoleon his name shall be
From Castile does Franco come and the Government driven out shall be
An English king seeks divorce and from his throne cast down is he
One named Hister shall become a captain of Greater Germanie
No law does this man observe and bloody his rise and fall shall be
Man man your time is sand your ways are leaves upon the sea
I am the eyes of Nostradamus all your ways are known to me
Man man your time is sand your ways are leaves upon the sea
I am the eyes of Nostradamus all your ways are known to me
In the new lands of America three brothers now shall come to power
Two alone are born to rule but all must die before their hour
Two great men yet brothers not make the north united stand
Its power be seen to grow and fear possess the eastern lands
Three leagues from the gates of Rome a Pope named Pol is doomed to die
A great wall that divides a city at this time is cast aside
These are the signs I bring to you
to show you when the time is nigh
Man man your time is sand your ways are leaves upon the sea
I am the eyes of Nostradamus all your ways are known to me
Man man your time is sand your ways are leaves upon the sea
I am the eyes of Nostradamus all your ways are known to me <start> Danger wouldn't always hide around here
Now in here I see my old friend disappear
Into night into night
People don't change
And I know your story so well
I know your fate it's my favorite tale to tell
You wanted to make me believe in love
You wanted to make me believe in love
You bring the money and I will be waiting
I'm in the corner with a wasp sting in my throat
Throw the money now you never ran this town
I'm in the corner with a wasp stinging my throat
Whisper to me we'll want to escape
Now what you got what you got that's so great
You wanted to make me believe in love
You wanted to show me the things that you dream of
You bring the money and I will be waiting
I'm in the corner with a wasp stinging my throat
Throw the money down you never ran this town
I'm in the corner with a wasp stinging my throat
With a wasp stinging my
I will be waiting
I will be waiting
I will be waiting
I will be waiting
I will be waiting
I will be waiting
I will be waiting
I will be waiting
I will be waiting
I will be waiting
You bring the money and I will be waiting
I'm in the corner with a wasp sting in my throat
Throw the money now you never ran this town
I'm in the corner with a wasp stinging my throat
With a wasp stinging my

ooooh <start> Some people say two is company
Sherlock Holmes found the sign of four
I don't listen to that number theory
I'm always looking for a trio them and me
One for all and we're all for one
Musketeers have got to have the power of three
Every time I read a horoscope I read three
Virgo Pisces Aquarius
I just want to know what's down the road for us
Say you'll be Holmes and I'm Watson
Every hero yes even me
Everybody has their Moriarty
Keep your friends close
Your enemies at your side
Always keep your green eyes open wide
Depth perception a change of direction
And all signs point to a bumpy ride
Then I saw the fourth dimension another line
We move in space and we can move in time
Everything existed right from the start
It's the blink of an eye
It's the beat of a heart
We've got enemies and nemeses
There's a world of possibility
In everything you leave a clue
A little trace a sign of you <start> Is there anyway I can fix it
Take out my tools maybe smash with it
Let me destroy the parts that annoy
swallow the words I'm saving
Fumble the chords I'm playing
Better just break it apart
Then where should they go
but you know I'm just following suit
It's something I aim not to do
Can't mock up a model me and you
is someone out there
I can trust
With the words that never seem to fit
no sense looking backwards
Shattered every mirror in my eye
Scattering the scrapbook
Blueprints on the floor
always thought things would snap into place
With a little more ease and grace
Still a ship sealed in a bottle
Never reaches the sea
and I stash all of the reasons
Dash them against the wall
And I smash your heart into tiny little pieces
and every time this happens
It gets harder and harder to build back again <start> Sparrow say that love's a game
Win or lose it's all the same
If it leaves it comes again
I don't understand
Never let her be too sure
That would be so immature
Keep her guessing that's the way
To show you really love her
I'd like to stop these guessing games
If it's all the same to you
'Cause when they're done
If you are gone
You know you'll make me feel so bad now
Sparrow sparrow love's a game
I don't understand
I'd like to stop these guessing games
If it's all the same to you
'Cause when they're done
If you are gone
You know you'll make me blue


Sparrow say it's time to go
If you care don't let it show
Hide it so she'll never know
Then she can't hurt you
Then she can't hurt you <start> I've got to ride that lonesome train
My heart is heavy with aches and pain
I said but someday someday baby
After a while
You will be sorry
Every day my clouds are gray
It takes you to roll all those clouds away
I said but someday someday baby
After a while
You will be sorry
Trouble trouble trouble on my mind
Trouble trouble way down the line
I don't need I don't need no sympathy
So babe babe don't you don't you pity me
I may be blue but I don't mind
Because I know way down the line
I said but someday someday baby
After a while
You will be sorry <start> I have finally found a way to live
Just like I never could before.
I know that I don't have much to give
But I can open any door.
Everybody knows the secret
Everybody knows the score.
I have finally found a way to live
In the color of the Lord.
I have finally found a place to live
Just like I never could before.
And I know I don't have much to give
But soon I'll open any door.
Everybody knows the secret
Everybody knows the score.
I have finally found a place to live
In the presence of the Lord.
In the presence of the Lord.
I have finally found a way to live
Just like I never could before.
And I know I don't have much to give
But I can open any door.
Everybody knows the secret
I said everybody knows the score.
I have finally found a way to live
In the color of the Lord.
In the color of the Lord. <start> I can't seem to remember if you were kinder
Did you even care about my peace of mind
I find that in the end you're just a big old..
I can't seem to recall why you keep on laughing
At your stupid jokes They're a waste of your time
'Cause I find that in the end you're just a big old bore
And I never wanted more than just a little fun
I don't want to behave
I don't want to behave
I don't want to behave
And I don't want to live up to your standards
I can't seem to believe how your little obsession
Has you by the throat and has you running blind
I find that in the end you're just a big old..
I can't seem to believe how you keep on clutching
With all your might to your nickles and dimes
I find that in the end you're just a big old bore
And I never wanted more than just a little fun
I don't want to behave
I don't want to behave
I don't want to behave
And I don't want to live up to your standards
I'd always thought that we had the same goals
But now I know what you're after
You'll do anything to get what you want
And there's nothing that wouldn't put past you
It's pathetic to see how uptight you can be
When things don't all go your way
I can't seem to remember when you first began to
Start this shit
And tried to mess with my mind
I find that in the end you're just a big old..
I can't seem to recall why years have gone by
And you're still the same
You stay trailing behind and I find that in the end
You know you're a big old bore
Who wished that she'd had more than just a little fun
I don't want to behave
I don't want to behave
I don't want to behave
And I don't want to live up to your standards <start> Seems I just can't do enough
I could never win your love
Why should I try
When you never share your feelings
How could I be so naive
Is it so hard to believe
That you excel in emotional concealing
No matter what I do
I never measure up for you
But you just keep that smile on your face
No matter how much I try
You're never really satisfied
Until you run away and hide
In your perfect world
Where there's no one to blame
No one can hurt your feelings
And you don't feel no pain
Everybody loves you
And nobody gets burned
As long as you are living
In your perfect world
It seems like everyone gets screened
On your answering machine
Can't take the call
And let down your defenses
You can't let anybody see
Your real personality
Is it pride or just your false pretenses
Maybe a part of you has died
Because you keep it all inside
But still you wear that smile on your face
It seems no matter what I do
I just can't get through to you
But I always know where to find you
In your perfect world
Where nothing can go wrong
You're always in control
And we all get along
And everything is beautiful
No need for concern
As long as you are living
In your perfect world
Maybe a part of you has died
Because you keep it all inside
Is it hard to keep that smile on you face
It seems no matter what I do
I just can't get through to you
But I always know where to find you

Of course the hardest part is letting go
But you've got to or you know
You'll end up waiting by the

Let me know you're alright
Tell you again that I'm fine
Then we go about our separate lives
Was it nasty scheme or lazy dreams
I left you cold two blankets deep
This is the last song I'll send your way
I smelled you on my shirt today
Of course the hardest part is letting go
But you've got to or you know
You'll end up waiting by the
Phone me once in a while

Were you trying to be someone you weren't You don't hang around the old haunts anymore no all the of those bridges are burned. He doesn't' like to share you  he likes your hair short You're not you you're not you anymore.
So take off that necklace he stole from his mother it doesn't mean what it meant before. Pack up your pictures and gather all your clothes but leave that lingerie that he bought you on the floor. It made you so awkward you felt like a whore... it's not you it's not you anymore.
Girl you need to be patient the day's gonna come. You'll leave your old baggage behind. No more excuses no more denialyou're tired and you're drawing the line. You're nobody's lapdog you're closing that door. You're not you you're not you anymore. You're not you you're not you anymore. Oh no. <start> Funny how things just tasted better
When we were young when we were young
Funny how things just seemed so easy
When we were young
It's been a long day
It's been a long day
It's been a long day
It's been a long day
I wanna get out I wanna go home
Is anything better than you on the phone
I wanna get out I wanna go home
Is anything better than you on the phone
I think that we weren't always grateful
For what you've done when we were young
I think that we weren't always grateful
For what you've done
We've come a long way
We've come a long way
We've come a long way
We've come a long way
I wanna get out I wanna go home
Is anything better than you on the phone
I wanna get out I wanna go home
Is anything better than you on the phone
You on the phone
You on the phone
You on the phone
I wanna get out I wanna go home
Is anything better than you on the phone
I wanna get out I wanna go home
I wanna feel that I can make it alone
I wanna get out I wanna go home
Is anything better than you on the phone <start> What makes the monkey dance 
Birds and bees chimpanzees
Buzzing round my head swinging from trees
She's a deep dish pie  a precious flower
Wrapped like candy primped and powdered
While the creepers creep and the willows weep
In the dead of the night I'm counting sheep
All night long I toss and turn
I wonder what it's gonna take to learn
What makes the monkey dance 
We got brand new drugs for the same old blues
Satellites peaking into your room
A machine to tell me if your lying
sheep for cloning  eggs for frying
I can meet for lunch with the man on the moon
Do almost anything I want to do
Makes no difference where you go
Everybody's got a theory but nobody knows
What makes the monkey dance 
I've peaked through keyholes on my knees
for clues to life's mysteries
From day time soaps to latenight cable
Round the corner  under the table
I'm looking for a love that can't be named
Looking for a love than knows no shame
Big or round short or tall
I got to get it or nothing at all
What makes the monkey dance  <start> And she just walked away
With nothing else to say
Like I was never here
She said her last goodbye
And kept her tears inside
As if I was never here
And she just looks the same
Like any other day
You wouldn't even know
You couldn't even tell
That I was ever here
I can't say that I'm the same
But I don't think she's fazed
Like I was never here
While I can't sleep a wink
She hasn't missed a beat
Like I was never there
When I was what she needed the most
And she was feeling all alone
Those days and memories
Have seemed to have come and gone
As if I was never here
And she just seems the same
Like nothing ever changed
And I'm still standing here
With so much left to say
But she just walked away
Like I was never here <start> The night is wasted
Sorry and passed out on the lawn
Hours later
You couldn't get him on the phone
And when he got back home
All the lights were on
I can hear you
Now and then the sound is almost gone
Well I'd be near you
If you were willing to be near anyone
It's never you at all
And when the sky begins to fall
Will you get to the point and walk away girl
You've been cutting it close for far too long
There's an innocence lost throughout the day girl
When you're flipping a coin you're half away girl
I know it would be good if I could only pick a side
You know when somebody goes somebody stays girl <start> See now like cat then mouse I move
they move the game hasn't an end.
Good news soon bad news then
I know the sound that says
nothing again.
What then The hours go past
my say is real they say only pretend.
Timing.
Wait for that day for my good.
Timing.
When I sell myself again.
Do they all realise the lion's share
is always halfway.
Wait for that day for my good.
when I sell myself again.
Timing.
Wait for that day for my good.
Timing.
When I sell myself again.
See now like cat then mouse I move
they move the game hasn't an end.
Good news soon bad news then
I know the sound that says
nothing again.
What then The hours go past
my say is real they say only pretend.
Timing. <start> Dreams and wishes like shooting stars

That's enough baby <start> Walk towards me
I want to hear
The Heaven's singing over you
When you breathe
And look at me
I want to be captured by you
Gaze into my eyes
And let me know youd fight
Thousands for my love
Slip your hand in mine
Ask me to dance with you tonight
Just ask me for my love
I want to hide
Whats deep in my eyes
Im scared to be known by you
But when I turn my head
And see you there
I want to be pursued
Gaze into my eyes
And let me know youd fight
Thousands for my love
Slip your hand in mine
Ask me to dance with you tonight
Just ask me for my love
A dream I wont wake from
A story that will never end
The ground your feet walk on

Ask me to dance with you tonight

Gaze into my eyes

Thousands for my love
Slip your hand in mine
Ask me to dance with you tonight
Ask me for my love <start> It scares me to speak my mind
It might sound selfabsorbed
I don't say half of what I think
I wonder what I'm thinkin' for
I'm smellin' dead flowers
And listenin' to the walls again
I'm drinkin' from a leaky faucet
And writin' with this dried up pen
Wish I still had my imaginary friend
And who needs to listen well
What do I have to sell
Everyone's just waitin' for their own turn
Kinda like show and tell
Smellin' dead flowers
And listenin' to the walls again
I'm drinkin' from a leaky faucet
And writin' with this dried up pen
Wish I still had my imaginary friend
Wish I still had my imaginary friend
Someone to listen someone to laugh
Someone to cry at the right time
I'm smellin' dead flowers
And listenin' to the walls again
I'm drinkin' from a leaky faucet
And writin' with this dried up pen
You know that I'm smellin' dead flowers
And listenin' to the walls
Drinkin' from a leaky faucet
And writin' with this dried up pen
Wish I still had my imaginary friend
Wish I still had my imaginary friend
And I would call him up
But I don't remember his name <start> 
Oh I've been traveling on a boat and a plane
In a car on a bike with a bus and a train
Traveling there and traveling here
Everywhere in every gear
But oh Lord we pay the price with the
Spin of a wheel  with the roll of the dice
Ah yeah you pay your fare
And if you don't know where you're going
Any road will take you there
And I've been traveling through the dirt and the grime
From the past to the future through the space and the time
Traveling deep beneath the waves  in
Watery grottoes and mountainous caves
But oh Lord we've got to fight
With the thoughts in the head with the dark and the light
No use to stop and stare
And if you don't know where you're going
Any road will take you there
You may not known where you came from
May not know who you are
May not have even wondered how
You got this far
I've been traveling on a wing and a prayer
By the skin of my teeth by the breadth of a hair
Traveling where the four winds blow
With the sun on my face  in the ice
And the snow
But oooeeee it's a game
Sometimes you're cool sometimes
You're lame
Ah yeah it's somewhere
And if you don't know where you're going
Any road will take you there
But oh Lord we pay the price
With the spin of the wheel with the roll of
The dice
Ah yeah you pay your fare
And if you don't know where you're going
Any road will take you there
I keep traveling around the bend
There was no beginning there is no end
It wasn't born and never dies
There are no edges there is no size
Oh yeah you just don't win
It's so far out  the way out is in
Bow to God and call him Sir
But if you don't know where you're going
Any road will take you there
But if you don't know where you're going
Any road will take you there <start> Cleansing
Takes me where I want to be
Summer rays in me
Innocence
The hardest thing to achieve
Summer rays in me
Anyone should not be
Taken over
Here I am on the ground
On the ground
Here I am on the ground
On the ground
Cleansing
Takes away the right to breathe
Cover me disease
Innocence
Hardest thing to achieve
Summer rays be free
Anyone should not be
Taken over
Here I am on the ground
On the ground
Here I am on the ground
On the ground
Anyone should not be
Taken over
Here I am on the ground
On the ground
Here I am on the ground
On the ground <start> Cold lips cold hands
Cold feet on the street
There's no shelter from
The heart's beat
Faster and faster
The winds blow down from the north
Sweeping these streets
Like ghosts on a march to war
A march to war
Outside there's a silhouette
Changing her name
Changing her face
Every time I look away
We sway in the yellow light
With no more strength to fight
So many dreams that fade away
So many lives we just can't save
If you wanted this so bad
Then why do we stand like we do
In the doorway
Come in come in
Come in come in
Come in come in
Come in
I never wanted anything like I want you
Come in
I never wanted anything like I want you
Like I want you...
So many dreams that fade away
So many lives we just can't save
If we wanted this so bad
Then why do we stand like we do
In the doorway
If this is it then why do I wait
All tangled up in the strings of fate
If I wanted this so bad
Then why do I stand like I do
Come in
I never wanted anything like I want you
Come in
I never wanted anything like I want you
Come in come in come in
Come in come in come in
Come in come in come in
Come in come in come in <start> When I come round with a bottle inside myself
An all my pride has gone locked away on some shelf
When my instinct becomes yeah yeah what was once the truth
Many moons that fade away
Well now it's all gone blown away
Like the desert sand oh never meant to stay
Oh there is nothing left there is nothing here
Just a trail of tears yeah
Trail of tears yeah yeah
A trail of tears oh oh
Oh oh oh yeah
Trail of tears yeah
Open up my wounds and take a look inside
You could cover the whole land with the tears she's got to hide
My memories cut deep oh yeah with a silver knife
The legend opens up its arms and takes another life
Trail of tears yeah
Trail of tears yeah
Trail of tears oh oh
Oh oh oh yeah
Come on
Solo
Well now it's all gone and I don't know why
And all that remains is the pain oh is that last war cry
 aaah



 yeah F
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
The pain the shame
It all comes back again
The pain
Oh the trail of tears

Bobby said that
Bobby said that
It'll be alright
Down on Laguna Beach they used to bury their secrets deep
And Bobby always said It'll be alright
So many lies <start> I forget
The taste of
The smell on your skin
And I never dreamed
That I'd see you again
Love or dreams
I can't decide
There's nothing more for me to say
I wish I never had to compromise
I ache to hear your whisper
As my lips let out a lonesome sigh
For you
When I come back to you we lay
Rediscovering the days when we first found out
That we fit together perfectly
We'll fade away together
Cause I can't stay forever
Are you O.K <start> When the weather is fine
and the clouds have gone by
I go up in the air
waving people goodbye.
In my flying machine
I go up
I go down
I go round and round
round and round and round.
People on the ground
have gathered all around to admire
there's a feeling inside me
that gives me the urge to go higher.
But I know what goes up
will eventually fall
so I won't take no chances
while I'm having a ball
in my flying machine
I go up
I go down
I go round and round
and round and round.
I can race with the birds
I can fight with the wind
I can fly on my head
I can dance in a spin. <start> What do you see in the dark
when the demons come for you
If only you could have seen
how fucked up my life used to be
then everything starts to change
supposedly healing my pain
I never thought I'd feel this way
I never thought that I'd see a day
I'd run away from anything or anywhere or anyone
Its all these demons haunting me
Its all these little things trapped inside of me
Releasing me from all my sin
Its taken me all of my anger
And taken me all of my hate
To learn how my life came together
Releasing the demons again
And now I look through my minds eye
And see where my past needs to rest
Its always disturbed by these voices
That echo inside of my head
Another way that I can hide
Another reason to crawl inside and get away
from everything and everywhere and everyone
NO
Its all these demons haunting me
Its all these little things trapped inside of me
Releasing me from all my sin
Its taken me all of my anger
And taken me all of my hate
To learn how my life came together
Releasing the demons......again
Facin the days as I grow into my own
Loving and hatings the same
And threefold I told you
it comes back with laughter
Over and over again
Its coming back
Its taken me all of my anger
And taken me all of my hate
To learn how my life came together
Releasing...
Releasing the demons again
Releasing the demons... <start> Please don't cry my baby

Talking about a girl who's got it Repeat and Fade <start> It's August again and I'm on my own
I'm under a cloud and I'm staying home
The telephone rings and I am hiding out
Rituals carved on a well worn path
It's up with people but I'm failing that class
So many reasons to style but I'm happy to down
I'm under a cloud and no one knows
Under a cloud my beauty unfolds like a rose
Whoaoh oh
I've been down so long I got a fear of heights
My mind keep telling me that something's not right
So I walk in the sun in my rain hat and overcoat
Makes no sense and it's so surreal
Dispite what you see I feel what I feel
And I'm bailing out water from this lush lifeboat
I'm under a cloud no one knows
Under a cloud my beauty unfolds like a rose
It's a terrible lie
None of it ever happened
I have my sunny sunny days always serverd blackened
yah

I'm under a cloud no one knows
Under a cloud my beauty unfolds
I'm under a cloud and no one knows
Under a cloud the beauty unfolds
Like a rose
Like a rose
Oooh oooh 
Bailing out water from this lush boat

Bailing out water from this lush boat

Pretentious whore and pull my trigger
Free the violence that is building in me
I say now end of the ride murder suicide
Is how I've been feelin' that I can't ignore
And the need to get psycho
Is not a question to me <start> Killing's my business and business is fine
Money's my interest life isn't kind
You know you can run but there's nowhere to hide
Payback's a bitch boy
Now you're gonna die
Hand me the contract I've got no remorse
The more cash I get the bloodier the worst
You claimed their way out life is up in flames
How 'bout doin' it my way
Beheaded or slain
Chorus
Hanging or lethal injection
Gas chamber  take a last breath
Firing squad electrocute we'll execute
More than one face of death
Kill 'em all let God sort 'em out
A soldier of fortune I'll wipe 'em all out
Having no home I have no shame
I'll take a life another victim in pain
Try turning the tables or make it a frame
You can't snuff me out
Because you're my game
You know you're my target
Your time stands still
But no job's too tough
I love to kill <start> Mi barrio sienpre fue

Chorus
Some kind of love

Yeah yeah
Some kind of perfect bliss <start> Hardships faced. We've been disgraced.
Our plans for the land are degraded by menacing hands.
But history's compelling us telling us to do it all again.
As far as I can see everything that we had believed
is more true now than ever before.
If the truth be known we would do it all again.
We got low down in Mexico.
It seems so far after having been so close.
We got low down in Mexico.
We lost everything except the things that matter most.
Bureaucracy and hypocrisy are contagious and make us all victims eventually.
You can take my life from me but we will do it all again.
The seeds of truth will grow.
The people will know of the visions that we have endeavored to show.
And like the river we will flow.
We Will do it all again.
Faceless men who represent no idea or purpose intend
to prevent revolution though revolution
but we could do it all again.
Even when I die I hope you won't cry
for my life has been happily spent in the struggle...
and I love you so I would do it all again. <start> Lay lady lay lay across my big brass bed
Lay lady lay lay across my big brass bed
Lay lady lay lay across my big brass bed
Whatever colors you have in your mind
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine
Lay lady lay lay across my big brass bed
Stay lady stay stay with your man awhile
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile
His clothes are dirty but his hands are clean
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen
Stay lady stay stay with your man awhile
Why wait any longer for the world to begin
You can have your cake and eat it too
Why wait any longer for the one you love
When he's standing right in front of you
Lay lady lay lay across my big brass bed
Stay lady stay stay while the night is still ahead
I long to see you in the morning light
I long to reach for you in the night
Stay lady stay stay while the night is still ahead
Lay lady lay lay across my big brass bed <start> Doin' it right doin' it right doin' it right doin' it right

We're doin' it right on the wrong side of town
I know a place on the wrong side of town
The rock band's cookin' and they're gettin' on down
The slot man's playin' like his soul's on fire
Movin' like a rumor on a telephone wire
Go rev up your Chevy put your gas foot down

Doin' it right doin' it right doin' it right doin' it right
The rock band's cookin' and the drummer's gettin' down
We're doin' it right on the wrong side of town
There ain't no future gettin' magazine girls
Taken to the club with their hard lovin' thrills
No time for tears trouble and sorrow
Rock and roll like there's no tomorrow
Turn off the tube and put your magazine down
We're doin' it right on the wrong side of the town
Doin' it right doin' it right doin' it right doin' it right
The rock band's cookin' and the drummer's gettin' down

We're doin' it right on the wrong side of town <start> There's a man who sees all there is to see what the future holds for all
As the days grow dark with his soul and final warning
Beware of the ones with invisible friends they will steal into your mind
And all too soon the signs begin to show
Rise up to the shining
Live long live now
Rise up to the shining
Don't be blind by fools again
Fools again
As the pages turn and the story's told from the visions he had seen
The house on the hill with the haunted eyes that call
Noon laughed as madness came out to play it's game
If you stay too long you'll finally go insane now
Rise up to the shining
Live long live now
Rise up to the shining
Don't be blind by fools again
Fools again
Bells will take their toll on your way
There's no way we're born to shine before our time
All your life you're on your own lonely road lost in a time
Let the light lead your way to the golden throne it's the only way
Rise up to the shining
Live long live now
Rise up to the shining
Don't be blind by fools again
Rise up to the shining
Live long live now
Rise up to the shining
Don't be blind by fools again
Oh rise up to the shining
Wise up they're gonna steal your mind
Rise up the house is gonna haunt you
No one laughed no one cried <start> Feel It never was a better place
Cuz you backed down
From what you've done
Change the thought of a tempered pace
Cuz you back out from what you've said.
Breakdown Takedown let me see
Look in my eyes and say you're fine
You're gone
Breakdown Takedown let me see
Love is patient and love is kind
You're gone
Touch a temporary seditive
Cuz you've let go of what you know
Turns out crossing roads
And you've back down from who you are
Breakdown Takedown let me see
Look in my eyes and say you're fine
You're gone
Breakdown Takedown let me see
Love is patient and love is kind
You're gone <start> Roughin' it in the great outdoors

Tie your towhooks to the front
UHaul trailer full of souvenirs
That you buy along the way

Let's go let's go let's go down the catwalk
Hello Donatella that's a beautiful dress
Che serata fantastica everyone's impressed
You may not remember me we've never met before
I was walking down the street when I saw this open door.
Lost in this feline world
I'm sinking like a stone
There must be somewhere here
Where we could be alone.
Whose house is it anyway
Can you tell me the address
Whose house is it anyway
Tell me who should I impress.
Did you see Bob Dylan he was singing for the pope
Seemed to me like their necks were stretched both hanging from a rope
Now we've lost Sinatra another mafia's son
What is this world coming too we're losing everyone.
Lost in this feline world
I'm sinking like a stone
There must be somewhere here
Where we could be alone.
Whose house is it anyway 
Can you tell me the address
Whose house is it anyway 
Tell me who should I impress.
I never got an invitation
My name ain't on the list 
Whose house is it anyway
I can leave if you insist.
Doesn't matter where I go
I feel so far from home
I got no business
Being here alone 
There goes Quentin Tarantino he's a young man in need
Still turning out all that stuff about Hollywood and greed
I just saw Madonna she's the girl for me
Tell me who's given their blessing to this sad reality.
Lost in this feline world
I'm sinking like a stone
There must be somewhere here
Where we could be alone.
Whose house is it anyway 
Can you tell me the address
Whose house is it anyway 
Tell me who should I impress.
I never got an invitation
My name ain't on the list 
Whose house is it anyway
I can leave if you insist.
Italian voiceover
Fade
Whose house is it anyway 
My name ain't on the list 
Whose house <start> I don't know why it all fell apart
I was too young you were too smart
I guess you knew
It was goin' nowhere right from the start
But your memory brings a smile
And every once in a little old while
I remember your sheer craziness
Electrifying my heart
That summer dress
And your kiss of fire at my door
That summer dress
It spent most of August on my floor
That summer dress
And your spark of desire at my door
That summer dress
It spent most of August on my floor
I know your sensibility
You always wanted to be free
No one was gonna change you baby
I wasn't gonna be the one to try
But I think of you now and then
Wonder if you ever found the one
Who could satisfy your electrifying desire
All that long July
I watched you smile as you passed by
I knew what you were thinkin'
Especially when you were drinkin'
Come the heat of August
You and your new summer dress
Did you wear it just for me
Don't matter it came off reasonably easily <start> Here in the comfort of a favorite chair
Or smugly from the tap room at the Whitehorse
I can prove mathematically
Just when and when not to take up arms
When to fight and when to surrender

This way or that way or this way or that way
Bang on the dustbin lids here come the Brits
An empire of vampires we're sitting in our armchairs
Nothing has changed we're just younger moralists
Easy enough to turn the other cheek
When you don't get slapped around
When cupboards and bellies are full fit to burst
Let the enemy do his worst

Here in written word in song in coversation
Courtrooms sit in anticipation of the reading of the rules
The exiled poet fleeing Nazi Germany would say
'Oh these divine commandments are not much use against murder' <start> R.sambora
It's amazing
We go through changes
When times get crazy
It's up and downit's hot and cold
These complications
Just keep on coming
These ain't no running
When it comes to life that's how it goes
'round and round we go
Sometimes it feels like
We're on a roller coaster ride
Baby don't you know
It could eat up
If you try and keep it all inside
Seems like hard times come easy
We do a lot of hangin' on these days
But the heart finds a reason
And love always seems to find a way
Even if it hurts
Even if it hurts us baby
There's gonna be thunder
There's gonna be rain
There's gonna be those times
We both get caught up in the pain
The realization
Keeps sinkin' in
The way you make it
Is learn to take it on the chin
'round and round we go
It's just another day
With trouble knockin' at your door
Baby don't you know
We can work it out
'cause we always seem to find a cure
Seems like hard times come easy
We do a lot of hangin' on these days
But the heart finds a reason
And love always seems to find a way
Even if it hurts
Even if it hurts us baby
'round and round we go
Sometimes it feels like
We're on a roller coaster ride
Baby don't you know
We'll keep holdin' on
Through the changes that we feel inside
Seems like hard times come easy
We do a lot of hangin' on these days
But the heart finds a reason
And love always seems to find a way
Hard times come easy babe <start> Follow the girls..
Super magic .. <start> 

All the time they want to take your place
The back stabbers 

All the time they want to take your place
The back stabbers 
All you fellows who have someone and you really care yeah yeah
Then it's all of you fellows who better beware yeah yeah
Somebody's out to get your lady
A few of your buddies they sure look shady
Blades are long clenched tight in their fist
Aimin' straight at your back
And I don't think they'll miss


All the time they want to take your place
The back stabbers 
I keep gettin' all these visits from my friends yeah what they doin to me
They come to my house again and again and again and again yeah
So are they there to see my woman
I don't even be home but they just keep on comin'
What can I do to get on the right track
I wish they'd take some of these knives off my back

All the time they want to take your place
The back stabbers 
Low down... dirty...


Smiling faces... smiling faces sometimes tell lies 

I don't need... low down dirty bastards  <start> Jaso gara je bhana jata sukai laijau malai

And motion to the sound
You hold yourself against the wake
You say the water's fine
Save me from this life I have made
There's a hustle and a bustle
In the city tonight and I find
That a feeling it grows
Down from my legs to my spine
Save me from this life
Bathe me in the light
Save me from the dark of the day
Save me from this life
Bathe me in the light
Save me from the dark of the day
You say this life is sound
And move upon the ground
You hold yourself against the waves
You say the water's fine <start> You got your hands in my pockets
You're whisperin' lies in my ear
Such promiscuous intentions
Don't mistake me for someone who cares
There were times I fooled myself yeah
Thinkin' I was no one else
Hard days cold nights
Nothin' that I could do yeah
Lovers are babes in arms

Yes it's true that's right
True yes it's true
Such a restless condition
The way you're turnin' it on
Love 'em tease 'em for all the wrong reasons
You know you're such a bore
There were times I told myself
There was really no one else
Hard days cold nights
Nothin' that I can do
Lovers are babes in arms

Yes it's true it's true baby
True yes it's true look out
Is it some kind of shakedown
You know I really don't care
But you push it too hard girl
Yeah you know it's just not fair
There were times I fooled myself
Thinkin' there was no one else
Hard days cold nights
There's nothin' that I could do
Lovers are babes in arms

Yes it's true true
Come on come on come on
Hard days cold nights
Nothin' that I can do
Lovers are babes in arms

Yes it's true yes yes it's true
Hard days cold nights
Oh there's nothin' that I could do yeah
Lovers are babes in arms

Yes it's true yes it's true <start> You shouldn't talk to your yourself
Well I pictured somebody else
Someone that looks like
What I look like
Would you say that one of your dreams
Got in you and ripped out the seams
That's what I'd say
That's what I'd say
He was a sucker for your double dose
Motherfucker turned white as a ghost
Don't you say hi
Don't you say hi
With a broken sink for a face
And a head that just takes up space
He's not half right
He's not half right
It's already half past
And it won't last
I was sticking up for my friend
When there's nothing much to defend
It's a lost fight
It's a lost fight
Cause when I talk to you on the phone
Well it's just like being alone
It's not half right
It's not half right <start> instrumental <start> It takes a lot to piss me off
But once I'm there it's hard to cool me down
Take as lot to piss me off
So why you want to go and do that now
It takes a lot of effort and time
To push me over that line
Take a lot to piss me off
But you're gettin' there
It takes a lot to piss me off
If I get mad I feel like a jerk
It takes a lot to piss me off
So why do you want to do that much work
I lose my temper and then
It's hard to find it again
It takes a lot to piss me off
So why you gotta piss me off
It takes a lot to piss me off
But you're gettin' there <start> You could say that all love breaks you
And every kiss is who you are
If I could tell you what I've been thinking
Maybe we could get along
See yourself through the mirror of the signs
It's alright to lose your mind
In a world of paradise
Yesterday before your eyes
And all the lives you leave behind
You can't run from what's inside you
And what don't kill will set you free
All those days I felt my rage
But I found the strength to be me yeah
See yourself through the mirror of the signs
It's alright to lose your mind
In a world of paradise
Yesterday before your eyes
And all the lives you leave behind
In a world of paradise

Don't fake
Don't fake anyone
Don't lie
Don't lie till you're done
Dive in
Dive into everything
You could say that all love breaks you
And every kiss is who you are yeah
See yourself through the mirror of the signs
It's alright to lose your mind
In a world of paradise
Yesterday before your eyes
And all the lives you leave behind
In a world of paradise yeah
Watch them fade in the shadow of the sun
Each new day the last is done <start> On a night like this
So glad you came around
Hold on to me so tight
And heat up some coffee grounds
We got much to talk about
And much to reminisce
It sure is right
On a night like this
On a night like this
So glad you've come to stay
Hold on to me pretty miss
Say you'll never go away to stray
Run your fingers down my spine
Bring me a touch of bliss
It sure feels right
On a night like this
On a night like this
I can't get any sleep
The air is so cold outside
And the snow's so deep
Build a fire throw on logs
And listen to it hiss
And let it burn burn burn burn
On a night like this
Put your body next to mine
And keep me company
There is plenty a room for all
So please don't elbow me <start> Can't you see the world's last sunrise
Can't you see the tears in my eyes
Can't you see the bloodred sunrise
Can't you see the tears in my eyes
If life is a dream be afraid to wake up
You would wish to sleep again
Shameful destruction of natural beauty
Senseless exploitation  reasons for dying
What will you breathe
When all trees are dead
Where will you go
When our world is black
Clear the wounds
The earth is suffering from
Even when you can't renew
What you once destroyed
So tear out this poisoned thorn
And ease the pain you caused
Stop to torture the nature
Oh can't you see the bloodred sunrise
Oh can't you see the fear in my eyes
I cannot understand
What you've done to the world
I cannot understand
Why you've done this to our world
If you don't change your point of view
Judgement day will be
Just a question of time <start>

    <start> Do you do do you remember
When we drove we drove drove through the night
And we danced we danced
To Rancid and we danced we danced
And I confessed confessed to you
Riding shotgun underneath the purple skies
And we danced we danced
With windows down and we danced we danced
You were the song stuck in my head
Every song I've ever loved
Played again and again and again
And you can get what you want but it's never enough
And I'll spin for you like your favorite records used to
And I'll spin for you like your favorite records used to
And I can't I can't I can't remember
Just how to forget forget the way
That we danced we danced
To Danzig and we danced we danced
And when you asked you asked me how I'm doing
Like you know you know how much better off I am
And when we danced we danced
With windows down and we danced we danced
You were the song stuck in my head
Every song I've ever loved
Played again and again and again
And you can get what you want but it's never enough
And I'll spin for you like your favorite records used to
And I'll spin for you like your favorite records used to
I'll spin I'll spin I'll spin I'll spin
For you for you for you for you for you <start> Dreams and castles
We build them constantly
Who will see what we've done before
Thoughts that follow me
Fools of destiny
This is what we've become
Say you'll stay with me
I just want to be
Here with you
Say you'll stay with me
I just want to be here
Taking chances with
Time that passes us
Who can tell what will be
Words that call to me
Eyes that try to see
Make it all mystery
Say you'll stay with me
I just want to be
Here with you
Say you'll stay with me
I just want to be here
Can you hear those little people
Tell me what to do
They cannot see there's no tomorrow
But for me and you
Say you'll stay with me
I just want to be here... <start> There were times likes before When she was overcome By happiness And as one her life Her age was prime and vulnerable
Satiate
So you've got the opportunity To take my best away from me She's different now Can't you see Her life structure's been deranged By your greed And for your desires
Let me get my thoughts straight
What gave you the Right to take her away from me
Said you were raised And claimed to be neglected That's no excuse Do you know the pain I feel With your presence Just go away I think you've done your damage Her plans for the future Were dismissed by you
So I will try I think I'll try again To get my life straight And I pray that everything she's seen Won't blind her And everything she's felt Will show in years to come And as for you... <start> Ik vind mezelf terug
Op een heel vervelend feest
In een onbekende kamer
Waar ik nooit eerder ben geweest
Toch ga ik hier niet weg
Mijn benen wegen zwaar als lood
En ik blijf hier dus maar zitten
Ach ik ga wat moeilijk dood
Moeilijk dood
Een zinkend schip verlaat ik pas als laatste
Moeilijk dood
Ik wil eraf maar durf me nooit te haasten
Moeilijk dood
Een zinkend schip verlaat is pas als laatste
Moeilijk dood
Ik vind mezelf terug
Pratend over niets
Met een onbekende gozer
En ik denk alleen maar aan m'n fiets
Die op me staat te wachten
In de frisse buitenlucht
En ik blijf maar zitten in de rook
En ik sla niet op de vlucht
Moeilijk dood
Een zinkend schip verlaat ik pas als laatste
Moeilijk dood
Ik wil eraf maar durf me nooit te haasten
Moeilijk dood
Een zinkend schip verlaat ik pas als laatste
Moeilijk dood
Een praatje met de gastheer
M'n glas alweer gevuld
Niemand staat eens op
En ik verlies echt m'n geduld
Toch blijf ik hier maar zitten
En ik vind mezelf terug
Bang om op te stappen
Steeds sterkere verhalen
Over zuipen en veel weed
't Is een zielige vertoning
En gezellig is het niet
Een dubbele tong vertelt mij
Geslaagd is pas een feest
Als de zon weer opkomt
En de politie is geweest
Moeilijk dood
Een zinkend schip verlaat is pas als laatste
Moeilijk dood
Ik wil eraf maar durf me nooit te haasten
Moeilijk dood
Een zinkend schip verlaat ik pas als laatste
Moeilijk dood  <start> Could I
Could I just find a way
I'd find you everyday
and we could alter time
But
I've come to find
Everyone's gone away
So this may be the time
For the perfect crime
Yes this is perfect

Our Medicine

Our time to...
Medicate
Here with me
Now as we
Lose ourselves to us and ignore
That you don't even know my name
Medicate
Come a day
You'll say you cannot stay
What's more I'll feel the same
It happens every time
So I've come to find
Everyone goes away
I'm destined to remain
You were never mine
So you were perfect

Our medicine

Our time to
Medicate
Here with me
Now as we
Lose ourselves to us and ignore
That you don't even know my name
Medicate
Can you describe what it's like
I feel nothing
Can you feel this
Does it sting
I feel nothing at all
I feel nothing at all
I feel nothing at all

I feel nothing at all

I feel nothing
Medicate
Here with me
Now as we
Lose ourselves to us and ignore
That you don't even know my name
Medicate
Here with me
Now as we
Lose ourselves to us and ignore
That you don't even know my name
Medicate
Here with me
Now as we
Lose ourselves to us and ignore
That you don't even know my name
Oh
You don't even know my name
You don't even know my name
Oh
Medicate <start> There will be days
We'll be in each others way
Down each others throats
Like you wouldn't believe
But then who was it said
Married life begins in bed
And ends up somewhat disparagingly
You say to me that you love me truly
I say to you likewise I feel just the same
But then who really knows
When two people get that close
That their feelings to each other
Won't change
I'll kiss you and then I'll kiss you once again
And pray to God once we get married there
Just won't come a time
When we'll wish we'll have Changed our minds
A problem to end all our dreams
So there will be days
We'll be in each other ways
Down each others throats
Just you wait and see
But don't be upset
After all that's what you get
When you become part of The Marriage Machine
Part of The Marriage Machine. <start> When love is new
And the world is out reaching for you
We try hard to hold it all
In our hands
But it slips through
Like soft drifting sands
But drying the tears
Can build it all like new
Chorus
Now and forever
Remember the words
From my heart will always be true
Now and forever
Together and all that I feel
Here's my love for you
Learning each day
That the right time was so far away
To tell you the things I knew
Now it's clear
That the moment
We searched for is here
And counting the years
Is all I want to do
Chorus
Hold me as close
As love will allow
Until all your fears are gone
What has all passed
Is over now
I'm here with you
I'm here with you
I'm holding on
I'm holding on
Is my love for you
Chorus <start> I turn the radio off
Don't want to hear that crap
All this computer stuff
Sounds like a handicap
They rap and hip and hop
They cover songs and sounds
They just create their style
Stealing ideas from all around
I don't want to change you I don't say I'm right
Their music is a mirror of a world full of ice
Everybody fights alone searching peace of mind
Hear the flashback radio turn it loud the speakers blow
It will hit your ears your heart and touch your soul
Hear the flashback radio try the flashbackmusicshow
Unforgotten songs and everlasting sounds
It's gonna make me sick
It's all this techno hype
Can't hear is anymore
Oh I don't like this vibes
Songs for the passing craze
Come in a rush in and out
Forgotten in the haze
Lost in the mindless outer space
I don't want to change you I don't say I'm right
Their music is a mirror of a world full of ice
Everybody fights alone searching peace of mind
Hear the flashback radio turn it loud the speakers blow
It will hit your ears your heart and touch your soul.
Hear the flashback radio <start> I got a lot on my head
Most of it is you
I got a lot on my head
Can't forget about you
Lock me away where the silly boys go
I'm on top of my nerves don't you know
Take me apart 'cause I'm out of control
Send me a letter on a midnight scroll
I got a lot on my head
Most of it is you
I got a lot on my head
Can't forget about you
Dance by the window in flamingo pink
Go through the motions in your Romeo mink
Condition's red disposition's blue
Why am I so attracted to you
I got a lot on my head
Most of it is you
I got a lot on my head
Can't forget about you
Trip down the alleyway take the back stairs
I know it's good but good isn't fair
That's what you said flashbulb in your eye
How can I hold you whne you're waving goodbye
I got a lot on my head
Most of it is you
I got a lot on my head
Can't forget about you <start> Diane...Down deep inside I cry
Diane...Without your love I'd die
Diane...You know you drive me wild...Diane
You're such a little evil child ya ya ya
Ya I wanna pack and leave and slap your face
Bad girls like you are a disgrace
A way down deep inside I cry
Without you little Diane I'd die
I should drag you down 'cause you're no good
You're twofaced your heart's made of wood
A way down deep inside I cry
Without you little Diane I'd die
Listen to my heart
Oh you're tearin' it apart
Oh why don't you understand
Why don't you stop it stop it
Stop it if you can
I want to spread the news that you're untrue
But Diane what good would it do
'Cause way down deep inside I cry
Without you little Diane I'd die I'd die
Ya Don't you understand Diane

I want to spread the news that you're untrue
But Diane what good would it do
'Cause way down deep inside I cry
Without you little Diane I'd die I'd die
Oh yeah <start> Push
When you wake up in the morning
Do you watch CNN
Oh do you close your eyes and hold your breath
Then say an Amen
'cause there's too much information
Runnin' round in your brain
Do we really need to know the facts
Of everyone's pain
Still you're searchin' for some reason
At the scene of the crime
With people killing people
Everywhere all the time
But then you go about your merry way
'cause baby you're still alive
Wondering all the time in the back of your mind
How will this world survive
And nobody knows nothin'
Nobody ever did
Well we can talk real loud and act real smart
But who we tryin' to kid
'cause everybody is an expert
When they're bloggin' the news
Oh Genius after genius
Without any clues
Twenty four hours seven days a week
Disasters multiply
Staring at the tube you can barely speak
It makes you wanna cry
Turn off CNN
Ttturn it off
Turn off CNN
Ttturn it off
Turn off CNN
Tttturn it off
Turn off CNN
You've got your foreign wars and your global warming
A terror plot or two
Everywhere you look there's a virus forming
By the way your rent is due
Turn off CNN
Ttturn it off
Turn off CNN
Ttturn it off
Turn off CNN
Tttturn it off
Turn off CNN

You're mine to hate what you've grown to be

You're not the same since all the friends we've lost
And heaven is not enough
So listen to what I have to say before you're without me
Chorus
There's not a better place I'd rather burn
You told be but I'll never learn
There's not a better place id rather burn
You told be but I'll never learn
Then your heart
Teenage dreams come into us

All over me they're forced to breathe

Don't try to save me cause
Its me that must
And baby its just a gun
So listen to what I say with your heart above her
Chorus
Soldiers everywhere around me
Prisoners of sound
So go ahead and drown me
Soldiers everywhere around me
Prisoners of sound

Yeah

Burn
Burn <start> Since I was a young man I've doing what I can
To escape the mental torture of my past
I have changed all my beliefs
But nothing seems to last
I need compassion I need some patience
I need a friend
Do you want to be my friend
Are you holding back again
Your confessions are my sins
The war inside me has to end
Summer's fading and I am too
I wish I was somewhere else
I feel out of place
Wasting time spent by myself
Hotel rooms and solitude
And the songs left in my head
It's all I know but right now
Baby I need a friend
Do you want to be my friend
Are you holding back again
Your confessions are my sins
The war inside me has to end
Do you want to be my friend
I've been found out I can't pretend
It won't stop 'til I begin
So do you want to be my friend
Somebody told me today
Somebody said I might find my way to you
That I might find my way to you
That I might find my way to you
Somebody told me today
Somebody said I might find my way to you
That I might find my way to you
That I might find my way to you
Do you want to be my friend
Are you holding back again
Your confessions are my sins
The war inside me has to end <start> once again I see your face
and it's not the one I know
hidden in the pale look
are blue eyes that now are red
as I'm walking up to you
I can see the girl inside
and she screams out loud
come save me I'm drowning
I'm trapped inside this prison
I can't take anymore
come take me I'm pleading
why won't you save me from here
why did you leave
once again I see your face
silent as the death inside
black and blue I look at you
trying to hear the faintest cry
and I hear you say
come save me I'm drowning
I'm trapped inside this prison
I can't take anymore
come take me I'm pleading
why won't you save me from here
why did you leave
I wanna come to you
I wanna get you out
I wanna set you free but you wont let me see inside you now
you wanna come to me
you wanna hold me tight
you wanna see the sun but you're still scared of me
come save me I'm drowning
I'm trapped inside this prison
I can't take anymore
come take me Im begging
please save me from this anguish
its all too much <start> Dance to the movement of the stars
Sing till the walls around us ring
Pray that it never fades away
Until we sleep
Feast go ahead now take your fill
Drink till the room begins to sway
Play and your cares will blow away
Until we sleep
Into a deep and dreamless sleep our spirits fall
And what we sow we cannot reap nor keep at all
Work though the work will break your back
Rest hope to feel your spirits rise
But the years have cut you down to size
Now go to sleep
Into a deep and dreamless sleep our spirits fall
And what we sow we cannot reap nor keep at all <start> Didn't I give you midnight
Didn't I give you the month of June
Didn't I make it alright
When everything was ruined
Didn't I say didn't I
Didn't you say didn't I too
Didn't we both say didn't I
'Till didn't we say we're through
Didn't I try didn't I cry
Didn't I
Sorry that your mother dropped you on your head
Maybe her mother dropped her too
In the end we all get dropped
We all get black and blue
But didn't I always love you long
When time was short and the night was cold
Didn't I admit that I was wrong
When the anger was new but the fight was old
Didn't I say didn't I
'Till didn't we say we're through
Didn't I try didn't I cry
Didn't I didn't I
Didn't I do <start> Mama mama here come Doctor Dark

The bus is leaving and I don't wanna go
I've seen inside of me
This side is everything
I've seen and I'm gonna be
Fuck rehability
I don't need it
Fuck the world
One time about a year ago
I flatlined but I didn't go

I didn't tell you
You'd never fuckin' known
I've seen about everything
Sex drugs sobriety
I've laughed at all of
Thee suggested remedies
I've seen so much of the
Government hypocrisy
I've pissed off everything
I don't care what you think

Fuck the world
It's that time I don't want to go
Show time after the show

I flow freely in the wind
I cry I try
with the bloodstain in my life
all we are is all we are
and who are you
I should blame you for a love unfaithful
but I'll save this reaction
All we are is all we are
and who are you
Today I tried to close this wound
and I fear these thoughts won't disappear
force fed lies
am I blind
am I blind
All we are is all we are
and who are you
I should blame you for a love unfaithful
but I'll save this reaction
All we are is all we are
and who are you
who are you today
I will push for new
I have eyes for you
Run just run
I've been awake for hours now staring at the sun
And I know all you say and everything you do
Its in these late hours that I find
Im through with you <start> This town I'm in can't take no more
Decadence and sin
You were my woman
Why'd you have to be so hard and cold
Chorus
Paris is burning
Want to see it from afar
Paris is burning
Want to get to where you are
My life's in ruin
The girl I love
She's far away
The distant fire
Brings memories of the love
That I once knew
Where are you now
Been looking all around
And I can't stay
Help me now
I can't stay
Much more before I fade away
Chorus
I can't believe
You'd throw it all away
You know you played me for a fool 
I'm leavin' now
This time you know
That I'll be gone for good yeah

Junior high love affair is okay
Jump on the big wagon 'cause I'm so cal
I'm big in every way
I'm running as fast as I can
She goes above and beyond her call of duty
She is a slut but X makes it sexy
Sex reminds her of eating spaghetti
I am wasted but I'm ready
If you wanna move it so why don't you make it go
Prove to everybody who doesn't understand
All the nights all the fights you are out of sight
Some say more with their hands
I'm running as fast as I can
She goes above and beyond her call of duty
She is a slut but X makes it sexy
Sex reminds her of eating spaghetti
I am wasted but I'm ready
I am wasted but I'm ready
I am wasted but I'm ready
I'm running as fast as I can
I'm running as fast as I rock
Why am I dealing with this feeling
I'm maxed out like a credit card
I'll continue to be my worst enemy
It's easy but it seems so hard
You're near but you seem so far
She goes above and beyond her call of duty
She is a slut but X makes it sexy
Sex reminds her of eating spaghetti
I am wasted but I'm ready
She goes above and beyond her call of duty
She is a slut but X makes it sexy
Sex reminds her of eating spaghetti
I am wasted but I'm ready
I am wasted but I'm ready

i one decide to run out
oh they got off you did
wonder where you say you knew
sugar ain't poison

it's too much of a good thing
maybe not so....sweet
i wasn't somebody

gonna let you out
i wonder what you

too much of a good thing

dreams about oh what is sunning you
oh baby
i hung up my package
never no never you knew
sugar ain't poison
but sugar will kill you
too much of a good thing
maybe not so sweet <start> The sound of beating hearts so anxious
A sacred rhythm passing with desire
The time we spend alone it saves us
The things we learn in solitude inspire
Its good to love for love is hard to find
But to love is realized
I can breathe you in
I can taste every moment
And the world in your patient eyes
It will wait til we have arrived
I'm so alive
And I breathe you in
I'm breathing in your touch so reckless
I'm breathing in the words that slip softly from your fingertips
The one you've blessed is all but helpless
The largest lesson given will empower
Its good to love for love is hard to touch
If this life is large enough
I can breathe you in
I can taste every moment
And the world in your patients eyes
It will wait til we have arrived
I'm so alive
And I breathe you in
You sit on my pillow
Its enough to get me through
But there's so much more to learn apart from you
Our time in a bottle
Would be wasted if it were used
When there's so much more for love to prove
So I breathe you in
I can taste every moment
And the world in your patient eyes
It will wait til we have arrived
I'm so alive
And I breathe you in <start> Don't ever take tour eyes off me
Not even for a minute
'Cause like a panther I might pounce
And that will be the limit
I can be sneaky fast as a snake
I strike like a cobra make no mistake
And baby you'll be trapped quick as a wink
It's animal instinct
Don't think that I won't pin you down
No matter how you plead it
I'm like a lion who's been caged
And you are gonna meet it
Watch out I'll warn ya' sharp as a hawk
I'm wild as a tiger I prowl and I stalk
'cause when a man feels thirst he takes a drink
It's animal instinct <start> Well here you are lying bleeding on a grimy street
See the broken glass sparkling darkly as it cuts your feet
Smell the rotting stench the rancid odor of old cantonese
Feel the toxic flames all around you you can hardly breathe
Come with me
Come on. I've got something to show you
Come on. You thought that it was over
Come on. You're really gonna love this
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
We can dig you a hole deep in the ground
Bury your soul down in Dragontown
We'll he lower than low spiralin' down
Far as you want to go down in Dragontown
Open any door remember everyone you met before
Oh. There's a wicked young man cooking slowly the frying pan
And our family of bones are back together sleeping all alone
Then there's Alice dear and all the little things that got him here
Now you're here
Come on. I've got something to show you
Come on. You thought that it was over
Come on. You're really gonna love this
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
We can dig you a hole deep in the ground
Bury your soul down in Dragontown
We'll be lower than low spiralin' down

Only the best a life extrordinairy
But you're so scared you push you're doubts on me
you put me down you call me ordinary
Too scared to take a chance yourself ya critisize everything I do
though I may fail well at least I tried
that's more than I can say for you always ordinary
I don't care what ya think I'm not ordinary
you know what's best that's what you say to me
it's good advice you're looking out for me
I'm not ordinary I'm not like anyone else
I'll do what I want I'll get what I need I can take care of myself <start> Don't live a life caught in shadows
Our eyes will miss out on what's here
For us
That colors our minds with intensions
That leads us to choose and take the
Path less traveled by
Just reach within and shed your skin
Don't be afraid if it leaves a scar
Sometimes it might take you far
Stand your ground
It's time to face your fears
Now become the one You've locked away
For years
Looking back you've always found
A reason
For the easy way out
Your life in a reflection
There comes a time when we need
The answers
There comes a time when we're
All alone
Although we're bound to this together
You'll have to walk the path alone
I never told you that it would be easy
I never told you I would be around
To save you from yourself
Now you see all the whys
It's time you make your own decisions
And let me go
There comes a time when we need
The answers
There comes a time when we're
All alone
Although we're bound to this
together
You'll have to walk the path alone
I never told you that it would be easy
And now you see all the whys
It's time you make your own decisions
And let me go <start> So much has happened now I have to reflect
So much misery I wanna reject
For years and years I have wanted more
But too many times they've walked out the door
I should forget it all and think about me
Spare the agony learn to be free
Question everyone false hopes they bring
Belive no lies don't trust a thing
The world is mine
Don't feel a thing
Don't feel the pain
Don't feel pride
Don't feel no shame
Sick of the fine print
Sick of the games
My soul is flying
And it's all that remains
It seems there was a time somewhere in my life
I fought off every single tale of advice
Now yesterday has come to be gone
Taking with it everything that I've done wrong
Don't feel a thing
Don't feel the pain
Don't feel pride
Don't feel no shame
Sick of the fine print
Sick of the games
I felt the sting
I dealt with the pain
The world is mine
I feel no shame
I read the fine print
I forfeit the game
My soul is flying
And it's all that remains <start> Catch a wave and you're sittin' on top of the world
Don't be afraid to try the greatest sport around
Catch a wave catch a wave
Everybody tries it once
Those who don't just have to put it down
You paddle out turn around and raise
And baby that's all there is to the coastline craze
You gotta catch a wave and you're sittin' on top of the world
Not just a fad 'cause it's been going on so long
Catch a wave catch a wave
All the surfers going strong
They said it wouldn't last too long
They'll eat their words with a fork and spoon and watch 'em
They'll hit the road and all be surfin' soon
And when they catch a wave they'll be sittin' on top of the world
Catch a wave and you're sittin' on top of the world
So take a lesson from a topnotch surfer boy
Catch a wave catch a wave
Every Saturday boy
But don't you treat it like a toy
Just get away from the shady turf
And baby go catch some rays on the sunny surf
And when you catch a wave you'll be sittin' on top of the world
We are put up on top of the world
Catch a wave you'll be sittin' on top of the world
We are put up on top of the world <start> I'm just a woman a lonely woman
waiting on the weary shore.
I'm just a woman who's only human
one you should feel sorry for.
Well I woke up this morning a long about dawn.
Without a warning I found that he was gone.
Why did he do it How could he do it
He'd never done it before.
Am I blue. Am I blue.
Ain't these tears in these eyes tellin' you
Oh am I blue Well I bet you would be too
if each plan with your man done fell through.
There was a time I was his only one.
but now I'm the sad and lonely one.
Was I gay 'til today
But now that man is gone
he's gone and we are through.
Am I blue.
There was a time I was his only one.
But now a now now now I'm the sad and lonely one.
Oh god I'm lonely.
But I remember oh I remember when I was gay.
That was up until today
'cause now that man is gone he's gone and we are through.
Am I am I well would you believe it if I told you I'm blue <start> I gotta full moon
A smaller room than I need

A sifting sand and an electric hand
Yes I'm fine
Got a soupedup truck or a goblin suck
Yes I'm blind
And I fall
Well I fall
Well I fall

My mind's a raging blame
A crying shame and I'm sad
A city of sin a bottle of gin
So doggone bad
A cool reaction for the big attraction
That's fine
A pissedoff god oh mother of god
Yeah I'm blind
And I fall
Well I fall
Well I fall
Yeah I fall
I'm a falling angel
Falling down
Be a falling angel
Won't you come on around
Don't be scared to follow
It's no crime
You're a falling angel
Before your time
And I fall
Well I fall
Well I fall
Yeah I fall <start> Many a tear has to fall but it's all in the game
All in the wonderful game that we know as love
You have words with him and your future's looking dim
But these things your hearts can rise above
Once in a while he won't call but it's all in the game
Soon he'll be there at your side with a sweet bouquet
And he'll kiss your lips and caress your waiting fingertips
And your heart will fly away
 with a sweet bouquet
Then he'll kiss your lips and caress your waiting fingertips
And your heart will fly away <start> Ahhha ahha ahh ohhh ahhha ahha ah ohhh

And you can be the Razor blade careful you don't slip
Every time I see you smile

Wondering what the hell to do

Well the phone don't ring 'cause my friends ain't home
I'm tired of being all alone
Got the TV on 'cause the radio's playing songs that remind me of you
Baby when you're gone I realize I'm in love
Days go on and on and the nights just seem so long
Even food don't taste that good drink ain't doing what it should
Things just feel so wrong baby when you're gone
Yeah I've been driving up and down these streets
Trying to find somewhere to go
Ya I'm lookin' for a familiar face but there's no one I know
Ah this is torture this is pain
It feels like I'm gonna go insane
I hope you're coming back real soon 'cause I don't know what to do
Baby when you're gone I realize I'm in love
Days go on and on and the nights just seem so long
Even food don't taste that good drink ain't doing what it should
Things just feel so wrong baby when you're gone
Baby when you're gone I realize I'm in love

Somewhere downtown a pretty girl kneels
Offers her soft lips and a handful of pills
Peels off her dress and then the rest of her skills
It buys what she wants and the rest she just steals
He speaks between deep swallows of rum
While her head is beating like a big bass drum
And she wishes he were mute and not just dumb
When the trick asked her quick Did you come
Chorus
It's a drag
Saluting that starry rag
I'd rather go blind
For speaking my mind
Or use it just like a gag
So raise it in anger
Just let it hang

He sits back and starts to invent
All about some Saigon correspondent
'Til the carbine fell silent and spent
I never knew it could be so eloquent
Next week there'll be some fashionable new sin
For each harlot and each Puritan
Pull off their wings stick them on a pin
And just watch the money roll in
Chorus
What you got hidden up your sleeve
The tracks of the train that were bidding you to leave
When they say that you should flatter to deceive
Don't count on any reprieve
The hands of the helpless are raised
Your dead little secrets are praised
The people stand dumbstruck and dazed
By the inches that you have erased
Chorus
Committing the perfect crime
In American Gangster Time
Here we go
Bye bye
American Gangster Time <start> I bought you postcards thought it'd be funny
I would have sent a souvenir but they took all my money
It's pretty warm down here but it ain't sunny
And I'm having a hell of a time my dear
Wish you were here
Having a hell of a time my dear
Wish you were here
I tried to phone you I tried to call you
Long distance operators that only stall you
Besides the damn rates are so high
They just appall you
And I'm having a hell of a time my dear
Wish you were here
And I'm having a hell of a time my dear
Wish you were here
It started out a nice vacation
Left the station right on time
Now it's turned to pure frustration
I'm just a prisoner in time
Can't get a ticket to get me home dear
They just don't have too many flights from twilight zone dear
So don't forget to feed my cats
Spot and Jerome dear
And I'm having a hell of a time my dear
Wish you were here
Having a hell of a time my dear
Wish you were here
Having a hell of a time my dear
Wish you were here <start> Never a day goes by when I can't see his face
And I can hear a thundering voice that no one will replace
But since he left you've been hiding out and I can understand
It seems to me about that time you should be coming back again
I can feel the pain
That won't go away
We can't change that he left us
But it's up to you to stay
And I will make sense of it all
Gonna try to make sense of it all
You ask me why
'Cause it's all I can do
I miss him every day
But now I miss you
I know it hurts right now but you've got to keep moving on
And I know how good it can feel when you're safe and withdrawn
But he can live in our memory and you don't yet have that choice
'Cause you're still here and to speak to me you're gonna have to use your voice
I ain't telling you what's right
And I ain't telling you what's wrong
But it's he who has died
And it's you who has gone
And I will make sense of it all
Gonna try to make sense of it all
You ask me why
'Cause it's all I can do
I miss him every day
But now I miss you
I know you're thinking now you must go through this alone
But it's time to come home
I can feel the pain
That won't go away
We can't change that he left us
But it's up to you to stay
And I will make sense of it all
Gonna try to make sense of it all
You ask me why
'Cause it's all I can do
I miss him every day
But now I miss you <start> Who shot the bullet
That killed the air tonight
Without a thought without a reason
Take a gun called hate
Up against your heart
And pull the trigger
And pull the trigger
It's over it's only over
It's only over when we say
The smoke and mirrors
The lies that wind your tongue
Is this oppression what we wanted
Or what we needed
As we function on impatience
And our patience is wearing thin
And you live a lie that will destroy us all
It's over it's only over
It's only over when we say
It's only over when we say
Back and to the left
Come on and shoot motherfucker
You like this baby
Just dance a little longer
It's over it's only over
It's only over when we say
It's only over when we say <start> Fire spirit lit the flame
A blinding light that shows us the way
Higher He's going to make us soar
And fly us up to heaven's gate
Yurnin' mercy bring us home
We look upon our final day
Burnin' see the morning star
Trumpet blast will take us away
Glory to the King of kings
Power to the Lord we sing
Forever and ever
Callin' out S.O.S.
Save our souls
You are the only one
S.O.S. save our souls
Our life has just begun
Callin' out S.O.S.
Cyclone the tempest comes at last
Man is finally put to his shame
White throne fury of the King
Judgement comes because of His name
Stars are fallin' from the sky
Wrath of God the Son's burning eyes
Blazing like fire
S.O.S. save our souls
You are the only one
S.O.S. save our souls
Our life has just begun
S.O.S. every knee gonna bow
And every tongue confess
S.O.S. save our souls
You are the only one
S.O.S. take away our fear
And all bitterness
S.O.S. hear me cryin' out
This is my heart's distress
Callin' out S.O.S. <start> Mr. Jones in the middle of the door
Stepping in to step out
He's in town he doesn't make a sound
What's this what is this about
Oh I figured it out but I'm a little unsure
I can't sleep here tonight
Won't ask do I really wanna know
What Jones was doing last night
What happened to the black suitcase
In the middle of the dark staircase
Where he's hiding and acting like nothing is wrong
Where'd he go
There's he goes
Mr. Jones suddenly gone
Fine dine better wine then the rest
He's got looks to kill
In touch but never too much
Oh no alone left with the bill
Black hat cadillac lots of cash
Lots at stake
Quick wits got a room at The Ritz
Can't judge a man by what he makes
What happened to the black suitcase
In the middle of the dark staircase
Where he's hiding and acting like nothing is wrong
Where'd he go
There's he goes
Mr. Jones suddenly gone
You wanna do you do you wanna

Sometimes I get so schizophrenic
All your caring I don't need it
Orchestrated madness over you
Lost this feeling in my head
Just want to feel this once again
Eat up my confession as I try to come off pleasant
so untrue so untrue
It's like you never left me
Your voice it always scares me
Frustrated sadness over you
Please just go away <start> Churches falling
Angels scowl
Crusaders in a foreign land
Gargoyles cry
The old priest lied
Cathedrals in the sand
Too brave to live
Too young to die
The stone walls understand
BFBS radio
R and R not long to go
Forces sweetheart cheerio
Daddy he is coming back
And we will wave a union jack
To welcome our hero home
Christmas bells
Heaven or Hell
Salaam or be damned
Auld lang syne
One last time
Hold my hand
A call to prayer
But who dares
Behold the man
Apocalypse now
If Westminster allows
A green unpleasant land
Dressed to kill
But dancing still
To the military band
Too brave to live
Too young to die
Is this the Promised Land <start> I never go to New York City these days
Something about the buildings in Chelsea just kills me
Maybe in a month or two
Maybe when things are different for me
Maybe when things are different for you
You know all of this shit just sticks in my head
Is there anything different these days
The light in her eyes goes out
I never had light in my eyes anyway
Maybe things are different these days
It's good for everybody to hurt somebody once in a while
The things I do to people I love shouldn't be allowed
Something about the buildings in Chelsea just kills me
Something about the buildings in Chelsea just kills me
Is there anything different these days
The light in her eyes goes out
I never had light in my eyes anyway
Maybe things are different these days
I dream I'm in New York City some nights.
Angels flow down from all the buildings
Something about an angel just kills me
I keep hoping something will
Is there anything different these days
The light in her eyes goes out
I never had light in my eyes anyway
Maybe things are maybe maybe maybe
Maybe things are maybe maybe maybe maybe things are different
Maybe things are different these days
The light goes out
I never had light in my eyes anyway
Maybe things are differentthese days. <start> Rhymin' man

I already did  years in Michigan <start> Strange to be on Marvel Hill
I've walked some years to find
I know there is a piece to fill
The gap I have in mind
No nothing's here I close my eyes
It's on the other side
And what I've worked so hard to gain
I'd gladly give away
'Cause I don't need this
I don't need it
I need more
A postcard from where life is a thrill
On top of Marvel Hill
But I don't need this
I don't need it
I need more
No I don' t need this
Too good to be true
Too good to ignore
I don't need this
I need so much more
It's too much to ask <start> Hand over hand
I crawl back to land
There is no retreat
That option's far and away
I have to be brave
But I always did crave
The golden sunlight
It's been about me
But I'm setting that free
For golden sunlight oh
Chorus
There's a door open to walk through
All I want is just beyond
What if I could let my guard down
Into freedom on and on
Somehow it came out
When I can't talk about
Someone to help me
As free as I wanna be
I cannot erase
But you helped me face
The songs and the flowers
At last perception
Of my self deception
The songs and the flowers oh
Chorus
There's a door open to walk through
All I want is just beyond
What if I could let my guard down
Into freedom on and on
Bridge
What if I could just let my guard down
What if I could live wide open yeah
What if I could just let my guard down
And go beyond into the great unknown
Sweetheart I've been bothered
A golden sun lit path
I've been after
Grass hills wild flowers
Sharp road trails
For a daughter
I want to be her father
I want to hear her laughter
Under meteor showers
The dogs will howl at the midnight hour
Chorus
There's a door open to walk through
All I want is just beyond
What if I could let my guard down
Into freedom on and on
Bridge
What if I could just let my guard down
What if I could live wide open yeah
What if I could just let my guard down
And go beyond into the great unknown <start> Let's go away for a while
You and i
To a strange and distant land
Where they speak no word of truth
But we don't understand anyway
Holiday
Far away
To stay
On a holiday
Far away
Let's go today
In a heartbeat
Don't bother to pack your bags
Or your map
We won't need them where we're goin'
We're goin' where the wind is blowin'
Not knowin' where we're gonna stay
We will write a postcard
To our friends and family
In free verse
On the road with kerovac
Sheltered in bivovac
On this road we'll never die...
Let's go away <start> Life it's always overblown
Till we wake up create some other needs
Yeah well cries heard from man that knows
Let to witness the cat upon a ledge
Heats source rained down
Dyad scout craft
Hands reveal a meeting but did they come
So I look at the eyes straight to the soul doorway
I look at the eyes to know all you know
Find an other labeled hoaxes
Just as Roswell found another link
Reform witness night abductions
You always felt a meaning but did they come
Well I look at the eyes straight to the soul doorway
I look at the eyes to know all you know
And there's a why
I'm burning out inside
With a need to know
One self
Well I'm burning out inside
With a need to know
Does anybody really see anything
Does anybody really see anyone
Lights two miles wide felt it lift felt it pull
That's why
I'm burning out inside
With a need to know
With self
While I'm burning out inside with a need to know
Does anybody really see anyone
Does anybody really see anyone
Does anybody really see anything
Does anybody really see anyone <start> The Serpents Tale
Glides past my window
And I just cant see you here
While those stray eyes move through me
Venus you're a Sunbeam
Venus you're in my Blood
In your search Lights i'm recovered
After Solom sank the Rainbow
A seance in me
Confessed Love in the provence of your Heart
And it solved these lines in my face
I'm spilled and my Soul has been touched
So I reach out over a haze of dark Angels
Hold me when i'm wired
Don't leave without my hand in yours
So Venus you're a sunbeam
You stood among the Branches of my mind
Where sombre words dissolved
And hope became the anchor
Mine is the Portrait of Eden
When fears turn to Asprins and the Devils Heart was broken
So Venus you're a sunbeam
Venus you're in my blood
In your search lights i'm recovered
After solom sank the Rainbow <start> Talk to me tonight
Is everything alright
Help me understand you
You go out with your friends
And talk to other men
And our love life is a wasteland
And with the change a new test of faith
To help us through tomorrow
A condition of the love we made
Chorus
Cause things won't change without you
Forfeit the lies that maimed you
I want to dance with the lions and change things
But I can't do it without you...you
You told me I'm the one
And now you're out of love
In your eyes it's hard to find you
If we could take some time
And cut out all the lies
I'd find a heart more stable
And with the change a new test of faith
To help us through tomorrow
A condition of the love we made
So take it easy girl
You're falling through the night
Your Mona Lisa eyes
Will comfort me the rest of my life
Chorus x
When love has hit your eyes
I'll never say goodbye
We stand alone tonight
Without you
Without you
When love has hit your eyes
I'll never say goodbye
We stand alone tonight
Without you
Without you <start> Wiggle wiggle wiggle all dressed in green
Wiggle wiggle wiggle till the moon is blue
Wiggle till the moon sees you
Wiggle wiggle wiggle in your boots and shoes
Wiggle wiggle wiggle you got nothing to lose
Wiggle wiggle wiggle like a swarm of bees
Wiggle on your hands and knees
Wiggle to the front wiggle to the rear
Wiggle till you wiggle right out of here
Wiggle till it opens wiggle till it shuts
Wiggle till it bites wiggle till it cuts
Wiggle wiggle wiggle like a bowl of soup
Wiggle wiggle wiggle like a rolling hoop
Wiggle wiggle wiggle like a ton of lead
Wiggle you can raise the dead
Wiggle till you're high wiggle till you're higher
Wiggle till you vomit fire
Wiggle till it whispers wiggle till it hums
Wiggle till it answers wiggle till it comes
Wiggle wiggle wiggle like satin and silk
Wiggle wiggle wiggle like a pail of milk
Wiggle wiggle wiggle rattle and shake
Wiggle like a big fat snake <start> Looking back at your own
Life lost life which once was so strong
You ruined your body toxic indication
Back to the wall too weak to rock the nation
Looking up to the sun in the sky
To higher places but I don't want to die
Strong as a rock
On the edge to the sky
Strong as a rock
See the angels fly
Strong as a rock
The abyss calls out your name
Strong as a rock
It's yourself you have to blame
Seeing faces on the wall
The monkey on your back cold turkey's coming home
No escape out of this nightmare
Back in rehab last try of despair <start> Chorus
This is L.A.
Our city our home.
Los Angeles
We never walk alone.
Forever true we'll stay
In tribute to our city
No matter where we go
This is our home.
On the sunset strip
The devil's hard at work.
If you wanna play you gotta pay you know
To keep the clubs from going under.
That's the price to grace the floor
As every fool before.
Underneath the haze
In the streets of this maze
All the way from the  to the  to the .
These streets are nothing but a parking lot
But I don't care 'cause I'm not going anywhere.
Chorus
It's AM again when will I ever learn.
If those warm winds blow me home tonight
I'll have a place to lay my head
I'll leave my troubles at the foot of my bed.
On the west coast shore
It's been far too long.
So what if I got no money in my pockets.
I'll always stand up strong
'Cause I'm in the city where I belong.
Chorus x
Submitted by Austin Lee <start> Some time long ago
There lived a gypsy I loved so
She danced around my head
Above my bed
Like no other I had known
I remember taking with her smile
The magic sweetness of a child
A wonderous warmth of love in her gentle giving
Oh am I dreaming now
I can feel her dancing
Dancing in the memory of when I saw her crying
Crying cos our hearts weren't lying and
We are only dreaming now
The days of sunshine in the air
The nights not lonely we were gave
To share an onlyness that to be in love could find
To get her fair
So happy dancing on our way
Sometimes she'd stop and she would say
Oh how I love you so is this so
Tell me am I dreaming now
I can feel her dancing
Dancing in the memory of when I saw her crying
Crying cos our hearts weren't lying and
We are only dreaming now <start> twentytwo times around the sun i've been. and i linger. around the moon. twenty four hours. and i'll be right back. where i started. and there's nothing else. the forgetmenots you leave behind. are killing me. i promise not to stay here. i promise that i'll try. although i always seem to miss. the target is in my sights <start> Her mother her father
Never showed her any affection at all
I wonder if it hurts her now
Now that it's too late they call
We let her down
It's true
We let her down
It's true
I told her I'd be there
It's easy to say what you want to believe
I told her I'd love her
And now that it's too late I see
I let her down
It's true
I let her down
Let her down
Let her down
We let her down
Let her down
So helpless pretending
Hoping that somehow somebody would see
So desperate for someone
I guess that she thought that someone was me
I let her down
It's true
I Let her down
I let her down
Look at her look through her eyes
Close to the hurt and the pain
I hope now she's somewhere
Where they'll never hurt her again <start> Ser que nuestra historia termin

I heard you told him that you'd love him to the end of time
Now that's the same thing that you told me seems like only yesterday
Gee ain't it funny how time slips away

They're seldom ever happy but they'll make you think they are
They will laugh with you and dance with you and fill your glass with wine
But they're the girls that play the same sad song on the jukebox all the time
And here's to the girls who live their life that way
'Cause nine out of ten of them was happy yesterday
And here's to the heart I'd broken the love I left behind
She's a girl that plays the same sad song on the jukebox all the time
Here's to the girls who work where lights're soft and dim
Here's to the lonely girls may they learn to love again
The girl I love is out there somewhere so if you'll see her treat her kind
She's a girl who plays the same sad song on the jukebox all the time
Here's to the girls who work...
She's a girl who plays the same sad song on the jukebox all the time <start> We was young
And still believed in a Hard Day's Night
But no one seemed to understand
That there was no relief in sight
The company man
He's got his nose glued to the charts
He says the record's doin' fine
But now the group is fallin' apart
I hope there's no hard feelings
'Cause there isn't anyone to blame
I hope there's no hard feelings
'Cause nothin' ever stays the same
Well we was locked in image prison
Waitin' for that break
We was raped reshaped and tryin' to escape
Caught in a rock and roll time warp
Just tryin' to find the way to get out
Four years on
And things were really gettin' too intense
Critics ravin' 'bout our album
But we're makin' fifty cents
And in the end
We was facin' the hard cold truth
So tomorrow come what may
Looks like it's Ricky and The Tooth
I hope there's no hard feelings
'Cause there isn't anyone to blame
I hope there's no hard feelings
'Cause nothin' ever stays the same
Well we was locked in image prison
Waitin' for that break
We was raped reshaped and tryin' to escape
Caught in a rock and roll time warp
Just tryin' to find the way to get out
We gave it everything we had to give
But it was gettin' so tough
Too much frustration makes it hard to live
I think enough is enough
I said enough is enough
I hope there's no hard feelings
'Cause there isn't anyone to blame
I hope there's no hard feelings
'Cause nothin' ever stay the same
While we was locked in image prison
Waitin' for that break
We was raped reshaped and tryin' to escape
Caught in a rock and roll time warp
Just tryin' to fine the way to get out
Lemme out lemme out
Lemme out lemme out
I gotta get out
Lemme out lemme out
I gotta gotta gotta get out
Lemme out
I gotta get out
Lemme out lemme out lemme out
Lemme out <start> Why's it got to be the same damn thing
Same damn song that everybody wants to sing
Same sons of bitches still rigging the game
They sell the same old faces with a brand new name
No matter if I'm wrong or right
I ain't losing sleep tonight
I've heard it all before
I can't take it anymore
If that's all you got
Let me help you find the door
Here we go digging the same damn ditch
Just line 'em up can't tell ya which one is which
Standing in the back with a shit eatin' grin
They were buying it once I bet they'll buy it again
As long as it's the devil you know
I bet he got a piece of your soul
I've heard it all before
I can't take it anymore
If that's all you got
Let me help you find the door
I've heard it all before
I can't take it anymore
If that's all you got
Let me help you find ah ah
I've heard it all before
I can't take it anymore
If that's all you got
Let me help you find the door <start> I know that I can't keep her
Now she's in love with you
But I just wanna say
I won't be far away
So don't make my baby blue
I know your reputation
They say you can't be true
So I'll be standing by
And you just better try
Not to make my baby blue
My little girl she's always been an angel
And it hurts me so bad to set her free
You better take good care of her
She still means all the world to me
You know she does
I'm gonna step aside now
Just like she wants me to
But even though I'm gone
I'll still be looking on
You better not make my baby blue
She's been a good baby
....

Blue <start> Deep down Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play the guitar just like a ringing a bell
Go go
Go Johnny go
Go
Go Johnny go
Go
Go Johnny go
Go
Go Johnny go
Go
Johnny B. Goode
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh the engineers would see him sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by they would stop and say
Oh my that little country boy could play
Go go
Go Johnny go
Go
Go Johnny go
Go
Go Johnny go
Go
Go Johnny go
Go
Johnny B. Goode
His mother told him Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band.
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight.
Go go
Go Johnny go
Go go go Johnny go
Go go go Johnny go
Go go go Johnny go
Go
Johnny B. Goode <start> Well all of my life I been a tryin' to save to get a pair of cowboy boots
Sixteen years of my life I gave to get a pair of cowboy boots
I wanna go where the money's free Hollywood is a callin' me
Oh what a great big star I'll be in a pair of cowboy boots
I'm gonna get on a TV show in a pair of cowboy boots
I'm gonna ride in a rodeo in a pair of cowboy boots
I wanna go where the family lurk I'm gonna get a job and go to work
Givin' lessons to that Stony Burk in a pair of cowboy boots
Oh give me a home
Where the swimmin' pools roam
Where the money grows on trees
The gals all wanna be squeezed
Well I'm a gonna get there if I have to crawl in a pair of cowboy boots
Get in the movies and that ain't all in a pair of cowboy boots
I'm gonna get me a leather vest a gun on my hip and a star on my chest
Well I'll be the terror of the Golden West in a pair of cowboy boots
Oh give me a home
Where the swimmin' pools roam
Where the money grows on trees
The gals all wanna be squeezed
Well I'm a gonna get there if I have to crawl in a pair of cowboy boots
Get in the movies and that ain't all in a pair of cowboy boots
I'm gonna get me a leather vest a gun on my hip and a star on my chest
Well I'll be the terror of the Golden West in a pair of cowboy boots
In a pair of cowboy boots
In a pair of cowboy boots
In a pair of cowboy boots <start> Hey Amanda
Where'd you find these crazy boys this time
They say You're pretty but you don't think they're right
Hey Amanda
While you're staring at your telephone tonight
Do you feel like turning it off turning off all of the lights
Pin your wings down
If it's ever over now
Pin your wings down
Just take a chance somehow
Hey Amanda
Who just threw your heart away this time
And when you're cryin' on your bed does he help keep you alive
Pin your wings down
If it's all over now
Pin your wings down
Just take a chance somehow
I'll take the blame if you take me home now
'Cause there's no place left for trust in all this pain
And you know when it rains in this town
I get washed away without a sound
So pin my wings down
If it's over
If it's over now
If it's over
If it's over now
Pin your wings down
If it's ever over now
Pin your wings down
Just take a chance somehow
Pin your wings down
If it's ever over now
Pin your wings down
Just take a chance somehow <start> A refuge for the poor
A shelter from the storm
This is our God
And He will wipe away your tears
And return your wasted years
This is our God
Oh hmm this is our God
Oh hmm this is our God
A father to the orphan
A healer to the broken
This is our God
And He brings peace to our madness
And comfort in our sadness
This is our God
Oh hmm this is our God
Oh hmm this is our God
This is the one we have waited for
This is the one we have waited for
This is the one we have waited for
Oh this is our God

A lover for the lonely

And He brings glory to the humble
And crowns for the faithful

There is none like You Jesus
There is none like You Jesus <start> If you see him tell him I wish him well
How am I doing
Well sometimes it's hard to tell
I still miss him more than ever
But please don't say a word
If you see him
If you see him
If you see her tell her I'm doing fine
And if you want to
Say that I think of her from time to time
Ask her if she ever wonders where we both went wrong
If you see her
If you see her
I still want her
I still need him so
I don't know why we let each other go
If you see her tell her the light's still on for her
Nothing's changed deep down the fire still burns for him
And even if it takes forever say I'll still be here
If you see him
If you see her
If you see him
If you see her <start> I got you crawling up a mountain
Hanging round my neck
I got you twisted around my finger
Crawling round my legs
The emptiness
The craziness
Satisfy my hungriness
Darling how would it feel
If we sleep together
will you like me better
If we cum together
we'll go down forever
If we sleep together
will I like you better
If we cum together
Prove it now or never
Make me a pretty person
Make me feel like I belong
Make me hard and make me happy
Make me beautiful
The emptiness
The craziness
Satisfy this loneliness
Darling how would it feel
If we sleep together
will you like me better
If we cum together
we'll go down forever
If we sleep together
will I like you better
If we cum together
Prove it now or never <start> A parody of man's intent
The price becomes irrelevant
Brother killing brother dead
Bloodshed turns the Danube red
Sovereignty
To rule thy own
Ruthlessly
Claims bloody thrones
A nation torn by civil strife
Children cling to ebbing life
A prayer for peace to bless this state
No pawn wins in stalemate <start> There's a place
In San Anton
Where I can go
And not feel alone
Tacoland it's a panacea
Tacoland they're always glad to see ya
You'll understand
When you go on
Down to Tacoland
When I feel
My world is lost
I go to Tacoland
And I get really tossed
I wish my band would always play
Tacoland I want to stay
You'll understand
When you go on
Down to Tacoland
There's a girl with dirty hair
She's got her dress up in the air
She tells a lot of jokes
Hell she's got a lot to share
Tacoland we ate a lot of figs
They passed around a bottle
And we took a lot of swigs
It's nature's plan
To go on
Down to Tacoland
Tacoland just three quarters of a mile
Past the Rockwood exit
In beautiful downtown
San Antonio Texas <start> I couldn't wait to see you waiting by the door
There's no one there to meet me and your clothes are on the floor
Sorry if I hurt you and I made you cry
Couldn't stand to see you with another guy
It's the bluest blues and it cuts me like a knife
It's the bluest blues since you walked out of my life
Couldn't really tell you how you hurt my pride
Something broke within me down inside
I never knew I loved you til you went away
Now the loneliness surrounds me everyday
It's the bluest blues since you walked out of the door
It's the bluest blues 'cause I won't see you no more
I'm sorry if I failed you if somehow I'm to blame
It's the bluest blues I'm feeling it's a cryin' shame
I just can't live without you face another day
It's the bluest blues I'm feeling and it's here to stay
It's the bluest blues and it cuts me to the bone
It's the bluest blues when you can't find your way home <start> We must have smoked a thousand cigarettes  In my tiny room at dawn  And as I light on up alone now  I breathe you in but you are gone  The waves crash the wind blows  But something's missing  Its no fun around here  without your drugs  I change the channels all alone  At AM there's nothing on  I fall asleep next to the phone  I can't believe the drugs are gone  And I cross off the days on my calendar until you're back again  I can't believe the drugs are gone  You're face is burned way deep inside me  And at night its all I dream  We stare and kiss and laugh and talk  Like some fifties movie scene  The days pass the weeks go  There's something missing  'cause life sucks these days  Without the drugs <start> This feeling
Don't happen
By yourself
Alone
Is no
Way to live
Breathing
It don't happen
By yourself
Alone
Is no
Way to live
We could love
We can love
One another
We could love
We can love
One another
We could love <start> So my heart has been ship wrecked again
And I try to swim to dry land
To reach the shore
It's a desert island and I wright help
In the sand as large as I can
That you ignore
So I'm waving at air planes
Waiting for ships to come take me away
When I noticed the tide
Sure is coming in fast
And I guess that this song
Really could be my last
Chorus
I feel like I'm stranded here with
Noone to rescue me
Abandon by everyone I need
I feel like you played me
I feel like I'm such a fool
Left stranded here by you oh
So the quick sand is pulling me down
You could throw that rope
And could save me from dispare
I was cast away you let me drown
So I tried to scream but I bet
Noone would hear
Put a message in a bottle
That you'll never read
So this is the last song
That you'll get from me
Chorus
So I'm waving at air planes
Waiting for ships to come take me away
When I noticed the tide
Sure is coming in fast
And I guess that this song
I'm scared that this song
Really could be my last
I feel like I'm stranded here with
Noone to rescue me
Abanded by everyone I need
I feel like you played me
I feel like I'm such a fool
I feel like I'm stranded here with
Noone to rescue me
Abanded by everyone I need
Stuck between  worlds
What should I do
I'm stranded by you <start> Don't even try reading my mind again
It's the second time I've caught you
Rummaging around in my head
I know what you're after yeah
And I've hidden it where you will never look
I know you like to remember things that never happened
I don't like driving in this fog
I don't like struggling in this web
And if I ever wake up
As if you'll ever wake up
The people in here are getting hungry again
They hunger for something intangible
Something even you can't provide
It hurts to think that in a hundred years
We'll all just be microfiche
Our names and the names of our songs
Cataloged and filed away
I don't like driving in this fog
I don't like struggling in this web
And if I ever wake up
As if you'll ever wake up
Didn't think I felt so empty
Emptiness can feel so good
I see the perfect life is the life of a tree
Yeah the life of a tree is the life for me
But you chop me up for wood
Don't ever try reading my mind again
It's the second time I've caught you rummaging
Around in my head
I don't like driving in this fog
I don't like struggling in this web
And if I ever wake up
As if you'll ever wake up again <start> Waited all night for you to come home
I always hated sleeping alone
Watching the roses wither away
Wishing my memories would die out the same
I waited all night yeah you never came
I miss the long nights under street lights
When our hearts were made of gold
I miss the feeling that we had then
We were never growing old
Yeah I miss it all
Whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh
Yeah I miss it all
Whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh
Everyone's trying to help me move on
They say it gets better in the long run
You could say that I've a couple good days
But nobody's eyes shine quite the same way
I waited all night yeah you never came
I miss the long nights under street lights
When our hearts were made of gold
I miss the feeling that we had then
We were never growing old
Yeah I miss it all
Whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh
Yeah I miss it all
Whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh
Waited all night for you to come home
I always hated sleeping alone
I hope that the lipstick I left on your face
Stays red like the roses I laid on your grave
I miss the long nights under street lights
When our hearts were made of gold
I miss the feeling that we had then
We were never growing old
Yeah I miss it all
Whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh
Yeah I miss it all
Whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh <start> Somebody told me love's a beautiful thing
And when I found it all the bells would just ring
The sun would shine and all the birds would sing
Then I met you
I searched the planet for that magical girl
I walked a million miles all over the world
I found the oysters but never the pearls
Then I met you
I can't eat
I can't sleep
I feel sick
I'm so weak
Love should never feel like this
I must be doing something wrong
I've never felt this way before
Walk in the bathroom and I take a deep breath
Look in the mirror and it scares me to death
Look like a junkie that's been strung out on meth
Since I met you
I can't eat
I can't sleep
I feel sick
I'm so weak
Love should never feel like this
I must be doing something wrong
I've never felt this way before
Love should never feel like this
I must be doing something wrong
I never felt this way before
Oh ignorance was always bliss
Love should never feel like this
Love should never ever feel like this
I've never felt this way before
I must be doing something wrong
No Love should never ever feel like this
I must be doing something wrong
I've never ever felt this way before
What's wrong with me <start> Down from the mountains word would come
We would soon move to Oregon.
Pulled from the ground of yesterday
Sell everything and move away.
But it wasn't what we thought
And we rode the horse that Bud bought.
We took that trip again my friend.
Ten of us formed a family
Jimmy and Jesus under siege.
Follow the leader it would go
Stuck in a twisted puppet show.
But it wasn't what we thought
And we rode the horse that Bud bought.
We took that trip again my friend.
But it wasn't all for naught
Living in the house that Bud bought.
We learned so very much back then.
It was a burning bush of hungry souls
Trying to follow what our hearts were told.
But a novice played upon our fears
And the whole thing screwed us up for years.
We untied a holy knot
And we rode the horse that Bud bought.
Prophecy came and we were gone
We would soon move from Oregon.
Turning their backs on yesterday
Some of the others fell away... <start> I get down with music and guitars
I fool around with all kinds of fast cars
It takes you baby to keep my motor running
I smoke the tires and watch the rubber burn
It takes your fire to make my wheels turn
Make my blood run hot and keeps my heart a humming
But you're love don't take a backseat to nothing
Temptation always knocking
Get three behind me 'cause I ain't stopping
Baby you're all I need and whole lot more
Rockin' and rollin' out here on the fast lane
It can get crazy downright insane
Burning down the highway to your front door
But you're love don't take a backseat to nothing
My baby's really somthing
She keeps my motor running
Her love don't take a backseat
Temptation always knocking
Get three behind me 'cause I ain't stopping
Baby you're all I need and whole lot more
But you're love don't take a backseat to nothing <start> On and off
You told me to wake you up
When the hand reaches the six
I crash over laying 
My eyes on the road
Help me to hold on to all your foes
They will be the last ones always
You and I are lost can't save this
World if we could see the truth through the lies
But you and I will never be the same
Again
On and Off
The ropes in which I upheld
Two lines across your face
For every smile you gave
To me with love
Help me to hold on to all your foes
They will be the last ones always
You and I are lost can't save this
World if we could see the truth through the lies
But you and I will never be the same
Again
I beg myself to watch your face
And clear the sin of you away
For love the key will always be disguised
You and I are lost can't save this
World if we could see the truth through the lies
But you and I will never be the same
Again <start> Tell me why you think Of the days before When life was routine Which reality broke
These people are the same You have changed Dont' face forward and Turn around
Just watch Where you point that gun or you May lay flat on teh ground Right back Where you started Strive better you now
Tell me why you learn From your mistakes Can you awaken On the right side and choose A strong foundation Where you learn it all again <start> I wish I I wish I was in Richmond
I do I would I
I wish I I wish I was back home
I'm waitin' here in New York city
The rain is falling
There's no one who cares
There's no one loves me here
The women they may look very pretty
And some they know it
But some look good
They show a leg and smile
But they all look like the flowers
In someone else's garden
I've no act of love
For anyone but you <start> It's that time again to face yourself your world's come crashing down on you
Don't make the same mistake again and hold it in like you always do...
Just for tonight let's take your past and put it all behind
And forget everything you've tried to hide
Cause all that doesn't matter anymore
Just close your eyes and feel the air blow through your hair then hide
To let you choke to appreciate your life
For all the days you've wasted in the past
You need to make this moment last
Breath in breath out you've heard it all before
But nothing takes the pain away except the pain itself but its too painful to ignore
Stop your acting your script's way too flawed
Go steal some new lines for you to safely read off...
Just for tonight let's take your past and put it all behind
And forget everything you've tried to hide
Cause all that doesn't matter anymore
Just close your eyes and feel the air blow through your hair then hide
To let you choke to appreciate your life
For all the days you've wasted in the past
You need to make this moment last <start> Do you remember a guy that's been
In such an early song
I've heard a rumour from ground control
Oh no don't say it's true
They got a message from the action man
i'm happy hope you're happy too
I've loved all I've needed love
Sordid details following
The shrieking of nothing is killing
Just pictures of jap girls in synthesis and i
Ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
But I'm hoping to kick but the planet it's glowing
Ashes to ashes funk to funky
We know major tom's a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an alltime low
Time and again I tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no not again
I'm stuck with a valuable friend
i'm happy hope you're happy too
One flash of light but no smoking pistol
I never done good things
I never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue wohooh
Want an axe to break the ice
Wanna come down right now
Ashes to ashes funk to funky
We know major tom's a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an alltime low
My mother said to get things done
You'd better not mess with major tom
My mother said to get things done
You'd better not mess with major tom
My mother said to get things done
You'd better not mess with major tom

You'd better not mess with major tom <start> Mary don't you weep no more
Mary don't you weep no more
Cause I got your letter today
Pack my bags and I'm on my way
So don't you weep no more
Don't you weep no more
Dry your eyes
Don't you shed no tears
The sun is risin'
So put away your fears
Cause I know I once done you wrong
I want to say I'm sorry
And I'm comin' back home
So don't you weep no more
Don' t you weep no more
I hear your voice in the wind
And I feel your tears in the rain
Shadows of night are falling
Can't you hear me call your name
I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home
So don't you weep
Don't you weep
Don't you weep
Don't you weep no more <start> He casts a shadow down the block
He can't remember
Just how to start or when to stop
Fight or defend her
He shines the light into the dark
And empty corner
Right where the past had left its mark
Too late to warn her
But she's fine she's not innocent
She's fine in all her discontent
And she knows it's always been the same
It'll always be that way hey
He holds the secret in his fist
A burning ember
To stay or go Now that's the twist
Hate or befriend her
But she's fine she's not innocent
She's cool in all her discontent
And she knows it's always been the same
And she's fine she's not ignorant
She knows there's no main event
And she's fine it's always been the same
It'll always be that way
It'll always be that way be that way
But she's fine she's not innocent
She's cool in all her discontent
And she knows it's always been the same
And she's fine she don't give a damn
You don't have to understand
And she knows it's always been the same
And she'll always be that way
She's not innocent
She'll always be the same yeah
She's always been that way
Hey hey yeah yeah <start> if you croak i hope ya know i'm gonna toss you in the trash
you can't really blame us we're only doin' what you asked
if you have yourself a son I'm gonna tell your baby boy
that father time's chock full of lies
so don't jump in just yet
doubting thomas deserves much more than we can give
if we win the lottery let's buy an island just for him
so when that hurricane tries beatin' down the door
we can make him bat its eyes until it can't see what's a...
until we can't see what's ahead
you can sew me in stitches
and curse at the cautious
while it lasts
'cause soon we'll all forget
if we croak i hope ya know it's gonna be in single files
hunting for models that were never worth the while
each one of us caught head for throwing jack frost in july
and staring at the sun till our eyes were done
and we could not see what's a...
until we can't see what's ahead
you can sew me in stitches
and curse at the cautious
while it lasts
'cause soon we'll all forget <start> O al viento prometer
a los cardos un jardn
un Edn donde cambiar
pinchos por amor.
Y si l lo dice a qu dudar
sabe cunto hay por saber
en tus brazos llvame
t lo encontrars.
Mas si llego antes que t
no cansar de esperar.
T y yo
seremos siempre as
amantes ciegos
de la irrealidad.
Y no hay razn
para cambiarlo
si acaso un poco
por sobrevivir.
Cabalgando entre las nubes
has vivido t
entrelazando sueos locos
siempre he estado yo. <start> Sitting in my rocking chair
Grandchildren everywhere
I remember Reagan
I remember Nixon
I remember Fred Astaire
Windows of the world collide
Save me from the world inside
Bending in the winds of time
Windows of the world
Open up my eyes
Clinging to a memory
Tossed upon the cruelest sea
All the tea in China
Or the ocean liner
Couldn't bring them back to me
Windows of the world divide
Staring at the rising tide
Where did all the time go by
Windows of the world
Teach me how to fly
Sitting in my rocking chair
Hand brushing through my hair
You could be my father
You could be my brother
You could be the love affair
Windows of the world collide
Save me from the world outside
Dissolve me in the air tonight
Windows of the world
Set my eyes alight <start> .

And nothing's gained
It's the same old situation again
No I can't give or take anymore
Gets so lonely
There's really nothing left to say
Gets so lonely
And everything's so far away
No one is right
And no one's wrong
How can I say right now
Which side I'm on
No I can't give or take anymore
Gets so lonely
There's really nothing left to say
Gets so lonely
And everything's so far away <start> Now its time to say good night to you..

And we are alright now but we're feeling tremors

And what's with the fact that I can't relate to this broke down town through a melody There are streets in this town I don't dare drive down I chalk it up to a lesson from adolescence.
And we are alright now but we're feeling tremors

But now I'm gonna see you weep yeah
This broken man
Is gonna do the best he can yeah
I'll see you pay before I give you my heart
Baby I'll do without
There'll come a day
When I'll smash your heart
And then turn away
You played with me like a toy
And a little baby
After I broke
You just didn't want to know yeah
I'll see you pay before I give you my heart
Baby I'll do without
There'll come a day
When I'll smash your heart
And then turn away
My time will come
And you'll know when it's begun yeah
You'll know because
You're gonna be just where I was yeah
I'll see you pay before I give you my heart
Baby I'll do without
There'll come a day
When I'll smash your heart
And then turn away <start> The jingle bells are jingling
The streets
Are white with snow
The happy crowds are mingling
But there's no one that I know
I'm sure that you'll forgive me
If I don't enthuse
I guess
I've got the Christmas blues
I've done my window shopping
There's not a store I've missed
But what's the use of stopping
When there's no one on your list
You'll know the way I'm feeling
When you love and you lose
I guess
I've got the Christmas blues
When somebody wants you
Somebody needs you
Christmas is a joy of joys
But friends when you're lonely
You'll find that it's only
A thing for little girls
And little boys
May all your days be merry
Your seasons full of cheer
But 'til it's January
I'll just go and disappear
Oh Santa
May have brought you
Some stars for your shoes
But Santa only brought me
The blues
Those brightly packaged
Tinsel covered
Christmas blues
Oh Santa
May have brought you
Some stars for your shoes
But Santa only brought me
The blues
Those brightly packaged
Tinsel covered
Christmas blues <start> You think that you're so clever
And you think you know it all
You're risk free the king of stability
But the doctors predict a fall
You're content intent even
Of spending your days with a screen
This is the most predictable
Waste of life the nation's ever seen
You need to push yourself
This is not the world
You need to push yourself
Think of Ziggy
Think of all the girls
I'm not flattered nd I'm not surprised
That you roll this way
You stand back fuck me you're so on track
You gobble up the gospel as they say
You need to come a little closer
No you're wrong
You need to see the edge of the rails
Get both of your hands up
Locate the chalkboard and scrape your nails
You need to push yourself
This is not the world
You need to push yourself
Think of Ziggy
Think of all the girls <start> I can be your right of way
So we can get out of here
I've always been the one
Who runs from everyone
Cos everyone's just too weird
Sink with someone tied to me
I'm making you volunteer
Another one has come and gone
They crawl along
Make them disappear
Dress me up in stitches
It's now or never
Tired of wearing black and blue
Dress me up in stitches
It's now or never
Tired of wearing black and blue
Dying to get my blood on you
Blood on you
Take another stab at me
I promise in time I'll heal
But yesterday went on and on a bit too long
I waited out on high street
There's nothing to find out here
Another day has come and gone
They crawl along
Wasting all these years
Dress me up in stitches
It's now or never
Tired of wearing black and blue
Dress me up in stitches
It's now or never
Tired of wearing black and blue
Dying to get my blood on you
Blood on you
How can you go on
When you're murdering someone
Killing me like you do
Gimme stitches
Now or never
Before I get my blood on you <start> Well she swept through the church
Like a sweet Sunday prayer
While the choir sang Son of Heaven
And the groom just walked on air
I was killing time with Jesus
When the wedding bells began
And I saw the most beautiful woman
Getting married to a handsome man
And she walked like a mystery
And she passed like summer rain
And she said I do like an angel
But I never knew her name
Oh the congregation gathered
But in darkness I remained
In love with the bride of a handsome man
But I never knew her name
In the shadow of the holy
Oh I heard my telltale heart
Whisper words that never reached her
As her vows were made at last
Oh the preacher with his blessing
Pronounced them man and wife
And I saw the most beautiful woman
Make a promise to be kept for life <start> Now I live with nothing to give
'Cause it's gone
Here I stand at your command
'Cause it's gone
Now I stand with you at hand
Now I live with nothing to give
'Cause it's gone
Now I stand with you underhand
'Cause it's gone <start> Substitute my gloom with happiness
substitute my sickness with health
substitute my enemies with real good friends
Morphine  chocolate are my substitute substitutes
morphine  chocolate can bring me up
can warm my heart whenever I want it
and every once in a while when I stop and think
morphine  chocolate are my substitute substitutes
And you can say hey we've really come a long way
and you can say say it can only be this way
but you might be careful it really it really come a long way
And you can say hey it can only be this way
but you might be careful it really hurts when it's real
you might be careful it really hurts when it's real
you might be careful it really hurts when it's real
you'll go down down down ooh
Set the alarm clock baby
don't you miss the sun
I'm feeling really warm hearted baby
don't you know I'm feeling like someone
I'm fearing for my heart
Morphine  chocolate could never substitute my art
and that's real love baby
and that's real love baby
and that's real love baby <start> Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flashback
Warm nights almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after
Sometimes you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you say Go slow.
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
CHORUS 
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting
Time after time
After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm OK
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting
Time after time
You say Go slow.
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
CHORUS 
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting
Time after time <start> I've been waiting I've been watching every move you make
And when I see that look in your eyes it's more than I can take
Now I know it's all for him reminding me what might have been
But I let you walk away yeah
Heaven knows it ain't been easy but in my heart I know you need me
Back in your arms again baby
Chorus
I'll be there when it's over
After he's gone and your world comes to an end
I'll be there when it's over
You'll never cry again you'll never cry again
You were helpless I was heartless on those times I hurt you
Now I'm the one who feels the pain 'cause there's no life at all without you
I can't accept the truth
Just knowing that he's touching you is more than I can bear
No one else can really love you like I can so let me show you
Just how much I care
Chorus

Even though I know it's crazy
I've been holding on and they say time will heal the pain yeah
Heaven knows it ain't been easy
But somehow I just know you'll need me back in your arms again baby
chorus
 
 <start> Well you know Katie Mae is a good girl
Folks say she don't run around at night
WELL YOU KNOW KATIE MAE'S A GOOD GIRL FOLKS SAY she don't run around at night
Yes you can bet your last dollar Katie Mae will treat you right.
Well some folks say she must be a Cadillac
But I say she got to be a Tmodel Ford
Yes she got the shape all right but she can't carry no heavy load.
And she walks JUST LIKE
Her daddy got oil wells in his backyard
Every time she got to working that woman she never has to work too hard.
I say byebye poor Katie Mae
These are the last words I got to say
Cause if I don't meet you tomorrow
I'll get you early in the next day. <start> When I like what I see
Something inside of me
Tells me that I gotta be
Hittin' on it
I'm hittin' on it
When it looks pretty hot
I don't give it a second thought
Because I know that
I otta be
Hittin' on it
I'm hittin' on it
Girls are thought
Not to make the first move
But when I'm in the mood
Chorus
I'm the initiator
I don't bide my time
I take him home
To get him alone
I bend his will to mine
I am the initiator
I move in for the kiss
I slip the tongue
I start the fun
I like it like this
I like it like this
He looks just about my age
Baby face and long legs
A little sugar
A little rage
I'm hittin' on it
Hittin' on it
You mess with me
And I'll take you down
I may be young
But I've been around
I want it all
And I want it now
I'm hittin' on it
Hittin' on it
Listen up girls
You know it's alright
Go get
What you want tonight
Chorus
I gotta feel good
I gotta feel right
I gotta bang bang
All through the night <start> It's cold and it's
Smooth and it's
A hard shade of white
And everybody needs to lick the surface clean
And it never tastes better
white blooms to white and freezes white again
close it before something crawls in
commit it leave it get away  we always
drop our good side
Being good gets you stuff
Being stuff gets you good
Good stuf gets you being
And wheelin' and dealin' and squealin'
Shit lives forever
'Cause Shit lives forever
they have no legs but chase us anyway
wipe the shadow of your best friend
gave birth to something we don't want to be
we drop our good side
You can't kill it
Eat is just as deep as you can fuck it
So cough it up or go down
And there's only one thing that separates
A man...
Shit lives forever
we'll retire with a turd on our lips
under a pair of knowing eyes
I'm gonna take a few down with me
and drop my good side
You can't kill it
Take it from our drummer 'puff'
Being good it gets you stuff <start> I paint your nails and brush your hair
Until you are so very beautiful
I whisper in your ear and on my knees
I tell you that you are desirable
You don't need to cage me
To close all the doors
As long as you keep me
I will always be yours
Play with me
Play with me
I stroke your neck and lick your neck
And do just what you tell me to do
Sometimes I'll beg Incomprehensible
But only when you want me to
Don't need to cage me
To close all the doors
As long as you keep me
I will always be yours
Play with me
Play with me
I know that you need me
I know that you care
You know that I may not love you
But I will always be there
I paint your nails and brush your hair
And tell you that you are so very beautiful
I whisper in your ear and on my knees
I tell you that you are desirable
Don't need to cage me
To close all the doors
As long as you keep me
I will always be yours
Won't you play with me
Play with me
Won't you play with me
Please come play with me <start> Do you believe in love
Do you believe in shame
And if love can conquer all then why
Do we only feel the pain
I heard you speak my name.
Heard you singing The Stones
Maybe heard you laughing in a line of static
On my telephone.
So why your eyelids are closed
Inside a case of rust
And did you have to change all your poet's fire
To frozen dust.
I try to justify it
To learn from your mistake.
But where's the stupid lie that has to make its point
With such a pointless waste
Come out
Do you believe in shame
Do you believe in love
And if they taste the same would you love again
Or abandon both
I don't think I ever can believe my friend is gone
Keep saying it's all right I'm gonna bring you back
But I know I'm wrong.
There's nothing I can say
There's nothing left to do
It's just that lately I've been so damn lonely when
I think of you.
And it may seem selfish now but I'll hold on to
The memory until all this fear is washed away.
Do you believe in love
Do you believe in life
Cause I believe a little part of you inside of me
Will never die.
Cause I believe a little part of you inside of me
Will never die
Cause I believe a little part of you inside of me
Will never die.
Cause I believe a little part of you inside of me
Will never die.
Oooooohey
Oooooohey
Oooooohey <start> You're sitting on the moon a million miles from here
It seems so far but in my heart I know you're near
And when I'm all alone I'm wishing you were here
And so I call your name so I call your name
So I call your name
With your light you shine the message
The loveletter from space.
And it says I love you
And with my light I shine the message
The loveletter from space.
And it says I love you too
Dam da da da di da di
Dam da da da di da di
Da da da da di dam...
I'm sitting here alone the million miles from you
If I had a rocket I would flying to the moon
And everyday I hope you'll come back to me soon
And so I call your name yeah I call your name
So I call your name <start> Standing on the waters casting your bread
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing
Distant ships sailing into the mist
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing
Freedom just around the corner for you
But with the truth so far off what good will it do
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh oh oh Jokerman
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky
You rise up and say goodbye to no one
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
Both of their futures so full of dread you don't show why
Shedding off one more layer of skin
Keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh oh oh Jokerman
You're a man of the mountains you can walk on the clouds
Manipulator of crowds you're a dream twister
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah
But what do you care Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister
Friend to the martyr a friend to the woman of shame
You look into the fiery furnace see the rich man without any name
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh oh oh Jokerman
Well the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers
In the smoke of the twilight on a milkwhite steed
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features
Resting in the fields far from the turbulent space
Half asleep near the stars with a small dog licking your face
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh oh oh Jokerman
Well the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame
Preacherman seeks the same who'll get there first is uncertain
Nightsticks and water cannons tear gas padlocks
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain
Falsehearted judges dying in the webs that they spin
Only a matter of time 'til night comes steppin' in
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh oh oh Jokerman
It's a shadowy world skies are slippery gray
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet
He'll put the priest in his pocket put the blade to the heat
Take the motherless children off the street
And place them at the feet of a harlot
Oh Jokerman you know what he wants
Oh Jokerman you don't show any response
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh oh oh Jokerman <start> Blue morning Blue morning
Wrapped in strands of fist and bone
Curiosity Kitten doesn't have to mean you're on your own
Your can look outside your window
He doesn't have to know
We can talk awhile baby
We can take it nice and slow
All your life is such a shame
All your love is just a dream
Are you happy where you're sleeping
Does he keep you safe and warm
Does he tell you when you're sorry
Does he tell you when you're wrong
I've been watching you for hours
It's been years since we were born
We were perfect when we started
I've been wondering where we've gone
All your life is such a shame
All your love is just a dream
I dreamt I saw you walking up a hillside in the snow
Casting shadows on the winter sky as you stood there counting crows
One for sorrow
Two for joy
Three for girls and four for boys
Five for silver
Six for gold and
Seven for a secret never to be told
There's a bird that nests inside you
Sleeping underneath your skin
When you open up your wings to speak
I wish you'd let me in
All your life is such a shame
All your love is just a dream
Open up your eyes
You can see the flames
of your wasted life
You should be ashamed
You don't want to waste your life
I walk along these hillsides in the summer 'neath the sunshine
I am feathered by the moonlight falling down on me <start> Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will not fear for my life
I realize that God's with.
His rod and staff have been with me so long.
He's been keepin' me from all the places where I might go wrong.
But He's the shepherd
I'm the lamb
And dinner he serves me.
Lets me eat it right in front of foes who would hurt me.
They better not touch
They watch me
But they can't touch me.
They do and they know that they'll be fighting with God.
He filleth up my cup and it overflows.
It's no joke
Come see yourself
See my cup is so full.
I'm the kind of sheep that's where the grass is always green.
Still waters He leads me beside
Stayin' there is a sweet life.
The Good Shepherd rules my life.
I'm givin' Him the thanks for Paradise.
You can spend eternal life livin' in the Shepherd's Paradise.
The Good Shepherd rules my life.
I'm givin' Him the thanks for Paradise.
You can spend eternal life livin' in the Shepherd's Paradise.
Look at the declaration that God is makin'
I will give my own life in exchange for the sheep.
And He's got it written down in the Good Book
Turn the television off a while and take a look.
He's a shepherd who's good to everybody in His flock.
Chapter  verse  in the Gospel of John.
Yes the Lord's my shepherd.
What could be better
And my home is a mansion in His house forever.
Cool
Death ain't nothing so I'll not be afraid.
His loving kindness will follow us all the way.
Psalm  tells a little bit but there's plenty more.
You may even know it
I don't know.
Tell me why is He so kind to His sheep when we wander away so easily
The Good Shepherd rules my life.
I'm givin' Him the thanks for Paradise.
You can spend eternal life livin' in the Shepherd's Paradise.
The Good Shepherd rules my life.
I'm givin' Him the thanks for Paradise.
You can spend eternal life livin' in the Shepherd's Paradise.
An hour is acoming
Coming in a while where He will make divisions by His mighty power.
Shepherd's gonna come and divide between the sheep and the goats
And we're all gonna listen as final words are spoken.
He'll say you goats deserted Me when I was poor and needy.
A naked hungry stranger.
How did you treat Me
I guess they failed.
I guess they're goats.
I guess they flunked.
That's why I know I like it in the sheepfold.
The Good Shepherd rules my life.
I'm givin' Him the thanks for Paradise.
You can spend eternal life livin' in the Shepherd's Paradise.
The Good Shepherd rules my life.
I'm givin' Him the thanks for Paradise.
You can spend eternal life livin' in the Shepherd's Paradise.
Tell me why is He so kind to His sheep when we wander away so easily
Tell me why is He so kind to His sheep when we wander away so easily
The Good Shepherd rules my life.
I'm givin' Him the thanks for Paradise.
You can spend eternal life livin' in the Shepherd's Paradise.
The Good Shepherd rules my life.
I'm givin' Him the thanks for Paradise.
You can spend eternal life livin' in the Shepherd's Paradise.
Tell me why is He so kind to His sheep when we wander away so easily <start> I see you walkin' as you're walkin' by
I gotta wonder gotta wonder why
I'm gonna give it to you just one more time
'Cause baby when I see your face

You're never ever gonna see
That baby it's just you and me

Maleficio mgico.
Fuiste t mi perdicin
zahor por qu a m.
Mal tabardillo le d qu puedo hacer.
Se fue mi estrella.
Se anul mi voluntad
trece planetas marcan mi mala suerte.
Tocado estoy.
Hasta mi sombra huye de m.
Al viento le pregunt
y el silencio contest
Si es que la quieres nombrar
tu lengua sea un cascabel
si la quieres invocar
tus dedos sean de laurel.
Dormir abrazado a ti
revolverte el pelo rojo.
Dormir enredado en ti
en tu cuerpo que ahora enreda el viento <start> Follow me follow me follow me
Can you hear me
Can you see
There's your enemy enemy enemy
Can you hear me
Can you breathe
Cause ya face down
You gotta get up you want it
Shoved down you've gotta get up
You want it
Cause it has to start somewhere
Has to start sometime
I'm with you
Can you tell me are you with me
Now's the revolution
They're pushin you down
They got it
You want it
Don't give it up
Now's the revolution

They think they've won

Cause ya...face down
You gotta get up you want it
Shoved down you've gotta get up

Cause it has to start somewhere

Don't give it up
Now's the revolution
Because it has to start sometime
It starts right now <start> It's not surprising
That you have all those wounds
They're advertising
The things that you've been through
It's tantalizing
To psychoanalyze
We're all downsizing
What we do with our lives
There's not enough money
In this whole world
To pay for a break or two
There's not enough armor in a suit of mail
Your broken skin's not black or blue
But damaged just the same
And who does not feel fractured too
Like broken skin
The sun's not rising
Upon your burned out shell
Still exercising
The things you don't do well
It's not enterprising
To grapple with the past
You're past surmising
How long the past can last
There's not enough trees
You can hide behind
Not enough walls to climb
Not enough cracks in the paving stones
Your broken skin's not black or blue
But damaged just the same
And who does not feel fractured too
Like broken skin <start> Lightning strikes turning ashes to embers
Starting the fire ignites the fuel I bring
Burning ambition will give me protection
Reach for the ring and you will be the King
The King
This iron will is my constant companion
Battle is over my strength inside is strong
Whispered memories of a failure abandoned
All that I am screams that this all wrong
Lord hear my plea when will it be
Time for me to see You clearly
Walk in a daze
And weak with pain
Carry me back to life again
A lifetime of cheap whine will not improve your station
The tempest to be best will prove the others fake
One man accuses another defends me
A delicate balance of hope and heartache <start> I'm a punk I'm a sinner
I'm lost new beginner

I'm a thread to myself
I'm a get armargeddon
I'm a freak I'm a liar
I'm a flirt I deny that I'm not good
And sometimes I feel like
I'm only one
No wonder why I've become
So dumb so dumb di dumb di dumb
I get more and more strange
I'm going insane I'm building it up
Just to break it down
It get what you see
It's my destiny
The product of a dysfunctional family
Dysfunctional dysfunctional
Dysfunctional family
I'm a bit suicidal
I'm my own worst rival
Train wreck white trash freak maniac psycho
I'm a troublemaking rebel
Made a deal with the devil
I'm way past ever coming back
But sometimes I feel like
I'm not the only one
When I see why I've become
So dumb so dumb di dumb di dumb
I get more and more strange
I'm going insane I'm building it up
Just to break it down
It's my destiny
The product of a
Dysfunctional
I'm not anybody
Don't you cry for me
I'm just from a dysfunctional family
Family family family family <start> Tougher than tough
Toughest when we are together
Thoughts of me and you forever
The rest can go to hell
Yeah I'm lost but so are you
Just like little lost lambs us two
They say we're sordid 'cause the way we walk and talk and flirt
They say we're dirty
We're stronger than dirt
Absolutely novice
We're absolutely new to us
No less if we are not his 'n' hers
Our love is as valid as their love is
I'm going on
Can we stay together
Is it me and you forever
Can the rest all go to hell
They say we are sordid 'cause the way we walk and talk and flirt
They say we're dirty
Stronger than dirt <start> To Thomas S.Eiselberg a very rich man who was wise
Enough to spend all his fortunes in burying himself
Many miles beneath the ground. as the only surviving
Member of the human race he inherited the whole world.
Stagnation
Here today the red sky tells his tale
But the only listening eyes are mine
There is peace amongst the hills
And the night will cover all my pride.
Blest are they who smile from bodies free
Seems to me like any other crowd
Who are waiting to be saved.
Wait there is still time for washing in the pool
Wash away the past
Moon my longlost friend is smiling from above
Smiling at my tears.
Come we'll walk the path to take us to my home
Keep outside the night.
The icecold knife has come to decorate the dead
Somehow
And each will find a home
And there will still be time
For loving my friend
You are there
And will I wait for ever beside the silent mirror
And fish for bitter minnows amongst the weeds
And slimy water.
I want to sit down.
I want to take a drink of water
I want a drink
I want a drink.
To take all the dust and the dirt from my throat.
I want a drink.
I want a drink.
To wash out the filth that is deep in my guts.
I want a drink.
Then let us drink
Then let us smile
Then let us go <start> When I walk with You Lord
I find my peace of mind
And when I walk with You Lord
I find my place in life
Everyday I will follow after You
And when I walk with You Lord
My life is filled with love
And when I walk with You Lord
Your love consumes my life
Everyday I will follow after You
Everyday I will follow after You
Everyday I will follow after You

I will glorify You
I will testify Your Name
I will glorify You
I will testify Your Name
Your Name
When I walk with You Lord
I find my peace of mind
And when I walk with You Lord
I find my place in life
Everyday I will follow after You
Everyday I will follow after You
Everyday I will follow after You

As the sun sets on the water
And I see You walking there
And Your steps lay out before me
I will rise to meet You there

I will meet You there Lord

As the sun sets on the water
And I see You walking there
And Your steps lay out before me
I will rise to meet You there

We will meet You there Lord <start> I don't want her to know I don't know me now
I see something better but I can't let it be somehow
I say goodbye but I know I've never longed to go
I struggle to stray from her eyes
They seem so like home
I'll take my time as fast as I can now
Search my mind to find how to flee this doubt
Search my heart to know how to hold one now
I spin out and let let my pride unfold
I let go
Is running away the way to relieve my doubt
And if I should stay would the past still find me out
I'm so afraid that my flaws will fail me now
Why do I stray from this voice
The sweetest sound
I'll hide away in truth til it heals my heart
Let it learn to beat for more than mine
I'll take my time as fast as I can now
Search my mind to find how to flee this doubt
Search my heart to know how to hold one now
I spin out and let let my pride unfold
I let go...so I can know
How to hold a heart
I don't want her to know I don't know me now
I see something better
Can it be somehow <start> you wander into the forest
following that shiny red ball
and by the time you looked up
you were lost that's not all
instead of being the hero boy
he finds his way and emerges a man
you just start cutting me down tree by tree
as fast as you can
oh say can you see me
oh say can you see me
oh say can you see me
over here over here
you want me to tell you a story
but I am weary of entertaining
I'll have more to say when I'm happy
'course then I'll have less to say
'cause there's no me left for me
no anecdotal term of  here
no wild adventures except in darkness
so dark I'd rather not say
oh say can you see me
oh say can you see me
oh say can you see me
over here over here over here <start> moved by a movie
medium is the message now
you're saying do the right thing
but then you turn around
you turn around and
do it wrong
you gotta break the walls
not build them up
break the walls
not build them up
break the walls
you've gotta break the walls
you're taking it way too far
now racists come
in all shapes and colors too
I'm so sick of all the bullshit
I'm sick of louis farrakhan
I'm sick of jesse helms
you gotta break the walls
not build them up
break the walls
not build them up
break the walls
you've gotta break the walls
you're taking it way too far
taking it way too fast
don't blame me or my friends
for the sins of the past
you want to make me abandon you
you want to make me abandon you
you want to make me abandon you
but I don't want to
but I don't want to
but I don't want to <start> This feeling's fading fast
And it's getting hard to hold.
'Cause I believe in every word
Of all the rumours I've been told about you.
And I'd never thought it would ever end up like this
That I'd be the one that you'd always miss
That you'd always miss that you'd always miss.
You're looking for the one way out
Waiting for the last goodbye how could you say
Never knew never knew it was coming no.
Never knew never knew it was coming no.
If you've always felt this way
Why was I the last to know.
Yeah I believed that every day
We were on the same damn page.
And maybe I never thought it would ever end up this way
Never thought I would ever just walk away
Just walk away just walk away.
You're looking for the one way out
Waiting for the last goodbye how could you say
Never knew never knew it was coming no.
Never knew never knew it was coming no.
You're looking for the one way out
Waiting for the last goodbye how could you say
Never knew never knew it was coming no.
Never knew never knew it was coming no.
Take me with you even if it's only in your head.
When you come back to me stay forever in my bed.
One way out last goodbye how could you say
One way out how could you say last goodbye.
You're looking for the one way out
Waiting for the last goodbye how could you say
Never knew never knew it was coming no.
Never knew never knew it was coming no.
You're looking for the one way out
Waiting for the last goodbye how could you say
Never knew never knew it was coming no.
Never knew never knew it was coming no.
How could you say never knew never knew it was coming no.
How could you say never knew never knew it was coming no.
How could you say never knew never knew it was coming no.
How could you say never knew never knew it was coming no.
How could you say never knew never knew it was coming no.
How could you say never knew never knew it was coming no.
How could you say never knew never knew it was coming no.
How could you say never knew never knew it was coming no.
What could you say <start> I came 'round to your front door your back door was locked
Pushed your button rang your bell you didn't hear me knock
I saw your window open wide so I crawled inside
I ran to the top floor but you were on the ground
I was on my way up and you were going down
Fire in the basement
Burn me up scream and shout
There's fire in the basement
Only you can put it out
This strange sensation that I'm going through
Sweet infatuation when I get next to you
I know what it takes to be a man you understand
'Cause when the sparks start flying you'll never be the same
You know I'll hate to leave you girl but I'm so glad I came
Fire in the basement
Burn me up scream and shout
Fire in the basement
Only you can put it out <start> I met a girl on a Friday night
She ran her mouth and she caused a fight
Heading for the exit door
I never made it off the floor
More a lover than the fighting type
I never claimed to be the great white hype
Oh no I'd rather have a broken heart
Than have my body torn apart
I believe I believe I believe in something
I believe I believe I believe in running
Run run run run run run run run
I remember back in school
I always had to play the fool
Whenever there was choosing sides
I would always be denied
When I was waiting for the bus
There always seemed to be a fuss
I could never walk alone
'Cause I was in a danger zone
But I believe I believe I believe in something
I believe I believe I believe in running
Run run run run run run run run
Daddy always said believe in something
And I believe in staying alive
But when it comes to blows I ain't worth nothing
'Cause I believe in love love love love
Love love love love
Love love love love
Fast forward almost twenty years
Found a girl that was so sincere
Wouldn't trade me for another guy
Never leave and I'll tell you why
You see it happened on a Friday night
She ran her mouth and she caused a fight
Started swinging and she cleared the floor
Ran away with her forever more
But I believe I believe I believe in something
I believe I believe I believe in loving
I believe I believe I believe in something
I believe I believe I believe in loving
I believe I believe I believe in something
I believe I believe I believe in loving
Love love love love
Love love love love
Love love love love <start> Imagine  won't stay the day
Out of nothing you'll lose your way
Imagine  curtain's gonna fall
Come on baby now you'll have to pay
He he cannot see it
How can I try to get away
How can I explain my thoughts
How can I try to get away
How can I explain my thoughts
Imagine  clock is runnin' down
Come on baby shouldn't waste my time
Imagine  you won't stay the day
Hold on baby let me find a way
He he cannot hear it
Says follow me
How can I...
And again it gives me the creeps and
My hatred of helplessness  it grows and
Every time I fear disaster
It makes my heart beat faster
How can I...
Imagine  clock is runnin' down
Come on baby shouldn't waste my time <start> Emily shrugs and drags her heels as she takes the guided tour
It seemed like such an amazing deal
When she was looking at the brochure
Stuck on a bus with strangers
Wishing she could be ay home
With me poor little emily
How does it feel to be free
Lyin' in bed
The pain in my head
From running around all day
Tryin' to find what was rightfully mine
But I ran out of things to say
Runnin' around with strangers
Wishing she could run away with me..
Poor little emily
How does it feel to be free
From familiar fingertips
To a persecuted grip
From the pan into the fire
Now a thread becomes a wire
Under which you must crawl
Through a ditch and over the wall
Emily works her fingers
Right down to her aching bones
While my aching head's got me stuck
In bed working on being alone
Working around the clock
Wishing she had worked it out with me
Poor little emily
How does it feel to be free
Poor little emily
How does it feel to be free
Poor little emily
How does it feel to be free <start> I'm a ticking time bomb
Waiting to blow my top
No one would ever know
Not til I grew up
No one would believe it
He was such a normal guy
Shake their heads and wonder why
Martians fell from the sky
What would that do to god
Would we put the weapons down
Or aim it up at the sky
No one would believe it
Except the fucking nut jobs
They laugh and cry we told you so
Baby when I get home
I want to believe in Jesus
Hammer in the final nail
Help me pick up the pieces
When everything starts to fall
So fast that it terrifies you
When will you hit the wall
Are you gonna learn to fly
No one would believe it
Except for all the people
Watching as you fly away
Baby when I get home
I want to pick up the pieces
Hammer in the final nail
And lean me up against Jesus
Baby when I get home
I want to pick up the pieces
Hammer in the final nail
I want to believe in Jesus <start> To have his arms
Around me
To sense
His perfect trust
I'd give
All I ever had
All I ever had
I'd love
To see him dream
I'd love
To watch him sleep
To have
His arms around me
Held his arms in mine
Sense
His perfect trust
I'd give
All I ever had
For a moment
Of his love
He's my heart
And my soul
He's my blood
And my bones
He's my prayers
And my hope
My wishes
And dreams
Seems so long ago
So long ago
I'd love
To watch him dream
Love to see
Him sleep
To have his arms
Around me
Feel him
As he breathes
Hold his hands
In mine
Sense
His perfect trust
I'd give
All I ever had
For a moment
Of his love
He's my heart
And my soul
He's my blood

A boy I never knew
And the man
I'll never know
I'll never know
I'll never know
To have his arms
Around me
Sense
His perfect trust
I'd give
All I ever had <start> Skimbleshanks the railway cat
The cat of the railway train
There's a whisper down the line at eleven thirtynine
When the Night Mail's ready to depart
Saying Skimble where is Skimble
Has he gone to hunt the thimble
We must find him or the train can't start
All the guards and all the porters
And the station master's daughters
Would be searchin' high and low
Saying Skimble where is Skimble
For unless he's very nimble
Then the Night Mail just can't go
At eleven fortytwo with the signal overdue
And the passengers all frantic to a man
That's when I would appear and I'd saunter to the rear
I'd been busy in the luggage van
Then he gave one flash of his glassgreen eyes
And the signal went 'All clear'
They'd be off at last for the northern part
of the Northern Hemisphere
Skimbleshanks the railway cat
The cat of the railway train
You might say that by and large
It was me who was in charge
Of the Sleeping Car Express
From the driver and the guards
To the bagmen playing cards
I would supervise them all more or less
Down the corridor he paces and examines all the faces
Of the travelers in the first and the third
He establishes control by a regular patrol
And he'd know at once if anything occurred
He would watch you without winking
And he saw what you were thinking
And it's certain that he didn't approve
Of hilarity and riot so that folk were very quiet
When Skimble was about and on the move
You could play no pranks with Skimbleshanks
He's a cat that couldn't be ignored
So nothing went wrong on the Northern Mail
When Skimbleshanks was aboard
It was very pleasant when they'd found their little den
With their name written up on the door
And the berth was very neat with a newly folded sheet
And not a speck of dust upon the floor
There was every sort of light you could make it dark or bright
And a button you could turn to make a breeze
And a funny little basin you're supposed to wash your face in
And a crank to shut the window should you sneeze
Then the guard looked in politely and would ask you very brightly
Do you like your morning tea weak or strong
But I was right behind him and was ready to remind him
For Skimble won't let anything go wrong
When they crept into their cosy berth
And pulled up the counterpane
They all could reflect that it was very nice
To know that they wouldn't be bothered by mice
They can leave all that to the railway cat
The cat of the railway train
Skimbleshanks the railway cat
The cat of the railway train
In the watches of the night I was always fresh and bright
Every now and then I'd have a cup of tea
With perhaps a drop of Scotch while I was keepin' on the watch
Only stopping here and there to catch a flea
They were fast asleep at Crewe and so they never knew
That I was walkin' up and down the station
They were sleeping all the while I was busy at Carlisle
Where I met the station master with elation
They might see me at Dumfries if I summoned by police
If there was anything they ought to know about
When they got to Gallowgate there they did not have to wait
For Skimbleshanks would help them to get out
And he gives you a wave of his long brown tail
Which says I'll see you again
You will meet without fail on the Midnight Mail
The cat of the railway train
You will meet without fail on the Midnight Mail
The cat of the railway train <start> Chorus
Ain't that lovin' you baby
Ain't that lovin' you baby
Ain't that lovin' you baby
But you don't even know my name
Listen to me baby
What I say is true
They could drop me in the ocean
I'd swim to the bank
And get back home to you
Chorus
They may kill me darlin'
Honey just like they do
Well my body might die
But my spirit's gonna rise
And crawl back home to you
Chorus
Ain't that lovin' you baby
Ain't that lovin' you baby
Ain't that lovin' you baby
But you don't even know my name
Don't even know my name
Ain't that lovin' you baby
Ain't that lovin' you baby
Ain't that lovin' you baby
But you don't even know my name
Said you don't even know my name
Said you don't even know my name
No you don't even know my name
No you don't even know my name
No you don't even know my name <start>  You know me oh so well
 You know me back to front
 You know exactly what I'm gonna do next
I'm gonna take you to a higher place
The rain collecting in a secret place
And I ache for all your suffering
 I won't reveal it all
 I'm putting up this wall
 For all the people of the cockatoo set
The extrovert is always in your face
Unaware he's invading
Your personal space
Take him out the impostor
Put a monkey in his place
Circle round the hazy sun
The hazy sun is circling the house
Spin off the chandeliers
And who's the one whose staring at me now
You move me into silence
It's a heartbeat away from Hell
I try so hard to control myself
Always smiling on the inside out



You move me into silence
You move me into silence
You move me into silence
You move me into silence
You move me into silence
You move me into silence
You move me into silence
You move me into silence <start> There was a time I knew
All that there was to know
No one could tell me then
I was wrong
I wasn't strong enough
To see where my weakness lay
The world that you hold so tight
Could slip away
And from moment to moment
Your life can change
There's a storm over the horizon
A sea no one can see
Somewhere around the bend
Right when you least expect
Someone can walk away
With no regret
Leaving an empty space
Breaking a sacred trust
All of your shiny dreams
Begin to rust
Yes from moment to moment your life can change
There's a storm over the horizon
The sea you cannot see
Yes from moment to moment
Promise me you'll never change
Promise me you'll stay the same
Promise me you'll never change
Yes from moment to moment your life can change
There's a storm over the horizon
A sea you'll never see
Yes from moment to moment your life can change
There's a light when the sun is rising
A day after today
Promise me you'll never change 
Promise me you'll stay the same 
Promise me you'll never change
Every moment is a shining light
Every moment is the darkest night
Every moment gotta get it right
Every single moment
Every moment is a shining light
Every moment is the darkest night
Every moment gotta get it right
Every moment is a shining light
Every moment is the darkest night
Every moment gotta get it right
Every single moment
Every moment is a shining light
Every moment is the darkest night
Every moment gotta get it right
Every single moment <start> When I'm feeling all alone
There's so far to go
The signs are no where on this road
Guiding me home
When the night is closing in
It's falling on my skin
Oh God will you come close
Light light light up the sky
You light up up the sky to show me
That you are with me
I I I can't deny
No I can't deny
That you are right here with me
You've opened my eyes
So I can see you all around me
Light light light up the sky
You light up the sky to show me
That you are with me
When stars are hiding the clouds
I don't feel them shining
When I can't see beyond my doubt
The silver lining
When I've almost reached the end
Like a flood you're rushing in
Your love is rushing in
Light light light up the sky
You light up up the sky to show me
That you are with me
I I I can't deny
No I can't deny
That you are right here with me
You've opened my eyes
So I can see you all around me
Light light light up the sky
You light up the sky to show me
That you are with me
So I run straight into your arms
You're the bright and morning sun
To show your love there's nothing
You won't do

Light light light up the sky
You light up up the sky to show me

I I I can't deny
No I can't deny

To carve a road for us that slices every curve in sight
We accelerate no time to hesitate
This load will detonate whoever would
Contend its right
Born to lead
At breakneck speed
With high octane
We're spitting flames
Freewheel burning
On we catapult we're thrusting to the hilt
Unearthing every fault go headlong into any date
We don't accept defeat we never will retreat
We blaze with scorching heat obliterations everywhere
Look before you leap has never been the way we keep
Our road is free
Charging to the top and never give in never stops the

Hold on to the lead with all your will and concede
You'll find there's life with victory on high <start> Under your spell again
I can't say no to you
Crave my heart and it's bleeding in your hand
I can't say no to you
Shouldn't let you torture me so sweetly
Now I can't let go of this dream
I can't breathe but I feel
Good enough
I feel good enough for you
Drink up sweet decadence
I can't say no to you
And I've completely lost myself and I don't mind
I can't say no to you
Shouldn't let you conquer me completely
Now I can't let go of this dream
Can't believe that I feel
Good enough
I feel good enough
It's been such a long time coming
But I feel good
And I'm still waiting for the rain to fall
Pour real life down on me
'Cause I can't hold on to anything
This good enough

For you to love me too
So take care what you ask of me
'Cause I can't say no <start> Time to get up another day
Turn the clock and look away
Sit around doing none
Sit around till the day is done
You're hanging out at the turn
Stuck again you should burn
You're hanging out wasting time
You hang around say you wait for the line
You have a freeride coming better
Pick up the call you have a freeride
You have a freeride coming
So you better get on you have a freeride
Yeah yeah you have a freeride
It is good when it is numb
Waiting for tomorrow never comes
And if it does who cares
The days are all the same around here
Sleep 'em away between dirty sheets
It takes a miracle to get on your feet
Things move just a little too fast
You take a ride take a ride in the past
You had a freeride coming but you never got on
You had a freeride
You had a freeride coming but you missed the call
You had a freeride
Yeah yeah you have a freeride

She makes me shake
At night I think and I want to take her away
Rainbows are on her face
Visions of tattooed chains
Egyptian rain in my world
A princess on her throne
Queen of the Nile
Love me like an earthquake
Queen of the Nile
Please let me be your king
Down by the quiet sea
No tide of hatred calls to me
Queens last on through the time
I hope the stars say that she's mine
Mysterious delirious I wonder if she knows
Mind tamer magic maker fortuneteller of long ago <start> Moving waves the wind has left you and you are still in commotion.
We are still repeating the word it has taught us
It moves our whole being to ecstasy.
Waves why do you all become excited and then all calm together
Because behind our individual action there is one impulse working.
Rising waves what motive is behind your impulse
The desire to reach upwards <start> Look on the flip side
It could of gone real bad
The way I see this thing
It worked out all the better
The better best anyhow
And you know that you're so very precious to me
You know you're so highclass
Now I need to clear a few things up
I need to get my head clear
Need to clear the air
Should be clear I'm a cold hard killer
Who's sophisticated with touch of highclass
A heartbreaker bringing death by sexy
A ladykilling mama in a rock n' roll band
Know I am a blackhearted devil honey
I must admit you're really under my skin
But nothing's going on between us
If he thinks it is then I would feel so bad
But nothing's going on between us
If he thinks it is then I would feel so bad <start> Joe What am I to do
I've been all 'round this world
Lookin' for something like you
Oh...oh...
I always roam but
I still ain't got what I want
Here...i'm here and i'm there
Ive been around Joe but I ain't going nowhere
Oh...Joe
Don't leave me on my own
Cause I still ain't got what I want
No I still ain't got what I want
No I still ain't got what I want
No I still ain't got what I want
If I ain't got you...
Now...they put me on a plane
And im flying out somewhere that I ain't never been
Oh...Lord...why you keep me so long
And I still ain't got what I want
Now Joe Lord gave me a lot of things
I've fulfilled a lot of wishes.
And I've seen my dream
But OH...Joe...Don't you leave me on my own
Cause I still ain't got what I want
No I still ain't got what I want
No I still ain't got what I want
No I still ain't got what I want
If I ain't got you... <start> When I pull the wings off of the fly
The fly never wonders why I did it
When I pull the wings off of the fly
The fly never wonders why I did
You know they didn't ever
Have to love me
No no no
And no one ever will ever
Love them now
Oh oh but they
They always wanted somehow
To save me
Why oh why
For pity's sake they should've saved themselves
Oh oh but you
You always said I never missed a note
I only ever wanted to be with you
I only wanted someone to play
Play play play
When I pull the wings off the fly
The fly never wonders why
You know they never really ever had to love me
No no no
But no one will ever love them now
Oh oh but they
They always thought that somehow they could save me
But why oh why
For pity's sake me they should've saved themselves
but you
you always said I never missed a note
and nobody ever knew me like you do you do
You always said it's gonna be ok ok
I only ever really wanted to be with you
I only wanted someone to play play play play
When I pull the wings off of the fly
The fly never wonders why I did it <start> We can reach the stars
We can clone a sheep
We can kill each other
But we can't fight as one
I come to hate my songs
I come to hate my work
So if God exists
Now I know how he feels
Disappointed
I'm over thirty
We're from the 's
We're the cheated generation
We've been motivated
We've been left alone
That's our legacy
A mortgage and a loan
Disappointed
I'm over thirty
We're from the 's
We're the cheated generation
Disappointed
We're the cheated generation
We're from the 's
Disappointed
I'm over thirty
I'm From the 's
Disappointed <start> A neighbour stole my VCR
Can't afford to fill up my car
It's been a while since I paid the rent
I wonder where that money went
Fox and Scully just disappeared
Well I could always sit here and grow a beard
Broke a rib trying to find the bed
The lights are out and the phone is dead
Or is it my head
Entertain me entertain me
Make me laugh 'til I hit the floor
Entertain me entertain me
Crack a joke 'til I can't take no more
My girl is gone and so's the cat
The junk I eat is making me fat
The virusscan fucked up last night
While I was jerking off to a neat website
Spent my bucks on apathy
Precious precious enemy
The landlord's dog just ate my shoe
My buddy's busy sniffin' glue
I'm thinking about you
Entertain me entertain me
Make me laugh 'til I hit the floor
Entertain me entertain me
Slip for me 'til I can't take no more
Take your hypocritic pointers
And shove em up your ass
Don't need your condescending attitude
Find somebody else to harass <start> Alas my love if I could make you live
And from the page step forth and sit beside me
Or better still bestride the steed I gave you
Wrapped close within the cloak I lent to hide thee
Perhaps I'd venture forth to ask thy name
Since while thou liest underneath my pen
That honour given which the poorest claim
Unjustly was withheld. But if again
I held thee captive as I did ere now
Stalling to pass my fingers through the last
Of midnight tendrils or peruse thy brow
In fear of sending off what heaven cast
Too early for my insufficient mind
To grasp the fullest detail and retain
The presence that your image left behind
That thou in all thy glory should remain
I fear my oversight I would not mend
For now upon reflection I confess
That secretly I never did intend
With title long or surname rich to bless
But rather let in my imagination
Run wild the thoughts of who perhaps you were
Before your soul demanded your creation
And deigned my mind and willing heart to stir
For such a noble and impassioned face
Could well be but newborn unto this sphere
But sure among a distant beauteous race
Thou hast known more than all who dwelleth here
And could tell much of places thou hast seen
And battles fought for honours won and lost
And how each service done a faerie Queen
Becomes a brighter jewel than it cost
The ladies of your world you may impart
Desire to be neither overgraced
Nor underrepresented in the art
Of living where their lips were meant to taste
A sort of feline stealth they wear about them
And while a flame of innocence they hold
In forests dark you fear to be without them
For knights of maler kinds are ne'er so bold
Yes in thy orb a maid may be a knight

Without a whisper loud or censure slight
For lords are not afeared their stock to lose
Where no stock may be taken or be kept
No property be granted nor no bride
No maiden may be stolen while she slept
Nor robbed of her freedom to decide
What suits her best. No county's law is needed
To cut the weed of violence from the stem
No danger for the law to go unheeded
For acts as these do not occur to them
The gentlemen you raise are rarer still
For in their eyes as in the depths of thine
Such soft and thrilling mysteries fulfill
The darkest corners of their heart's design
Their arrows much like those I gave to thee
Could not but graze the flank of yonder cow
Without making him laugh. 'Tis much to see
Them tickling their prey. I know not how
They ever do encapture what they eat
Save that perhaps their bright unfettered brains
Have learned that what grows underneath their feet
And in the trees above better sustains
A life intent on living well tomorrow
But how I ask thee most endearing fiend
Do lords and ladies love where is no sorrow
No strife to overcome no soul uncleaned
Of crushing ardor long worn out its stay
Betrothal to a mortal less divine
Than that who stole thy blushing breath away
No hot forbidden kisses for to pine
No heart affixed to age where heart is young
No ill intentioned suitors to evade
Still madam Would'st thou kindly hold thy tongue
Thou sayest. Your mistake has rash been made
In living long in combat with your kind
Thou see'st no other obstacle but these
Thy hands are careworn that have yet to find
The hands that first should hold them. Yet to please
The hierarchy which you serve unwitting
Thou dost believe that love in fighting grows
That happiness in love is not befitting
But in thy sadness thou mak'st light of woes
For even were there ne'er a cloudy day
No tempest to divide what love had bound
The galley which the moon holds in her sway
Could not but stir the peace it finally found
The wound is deeper than the sea about thee
The stars upon my doublet you have drawn
May light my homeward path but how without me
Wilt thou escape the fate thou tremblest on
And in this way and more my paper spoke
O fierce savage gentle beauty bright
Thou who I've given breath my soul has broke
You had authority but not the right
Could I but see the lips that dare not breathe
They are so beautiful and pressing sweet
Could I but touch the wings that underneath
Are made so soft thy heart forgets to beat
Perhaps I should have more for which to strive
You came to my domain and brought despair
For though I be the chastest heart alive
The realm you speak of will not take me there
Have you no pity Can'st thou not perceive
That I a blinded beast had but the eyes
To see where I would love Dost thou believe
That ere you came I was but vain disguise
I know the murmur of music reveals
The things no human heart could comprehend
I render'st thou for all that torment feels
And longed to be thy lordship's faithful friend
Yea quiet as a mushroom did I wait
I willed to thee my form to overtake
I shivered at each passing horse's gait
And so I slept to suddenly awake
Alas my love wilt thou kiss me goodbye
The lingering night will aid thee on thy travels
I'll craft but one thing more a crow to fly
Before to tell me how thy tale unravels
I say thou art complete and free to go
What holds thee here save one who lives no longer
For I have given thee the life you know
The weaker I become thou art the stronger
And in your antique words your clear intent
Was that once thou art gone I should dismay
Quothe thee Your thought mistook me for I meant
To leave thee not but offerest to stay.
For true I never did in my own realm
Partake of that pure love of which I told thee
But be my guide and with me at the helm
And I shall in the cloak you wrought enfold thee
And journey to the ends of all the earth
For thou hast proved more generous and wise
Than all we faeries moons and stars are worth
For live we not but living in your eyes.
Dear nameless knight if thou would'st be mine own
And leave thy dragons for a while thou may'st
Find in these arms within which thou hast grown
A better reason than the which thou say'st
But with your hand you pointeth swear I so
And 'tis not plain to me though I did draw it
Which way thou dost intend for us to go
Sure in the mind it is of she who saw it
Yet still perhaps I made thee to discover
What one would do if one were asked to choose
'Tween back and forwards. Be thee friend or lover
Perhaps you were to be my favorite muse
Thou feel'st thy armor fight but when you must
Thou see'st the blade of truth below thy knee
Use arrows against all whom you mistrust
But when thou ride'st my way aim one at me
Your world is yours as ere it was before
Your time beneath my busy hand well spent
I've made a thing I love I ask no more
And never shall redeem the heart I lent
Me in my world and thyself in thine
Two petals on the same and silent flower
And evermore I'll welcome thee in mine
Your dear creation was my finest hour <start> Here I stand
A heartbroken man
I was a bad seed in your future plan
When it rains it pours
That's when you hide and close the door
I'll never be the one you wanted
I sent you a letter
I thought it'd be better than calling you
I'm missing you
I'm the man you never knew
Always blue.over you
And I can't help it
I can not fake it
For I still love you
I don't know you.anymore
Behind the shell lies something wounded
Have you found your superman
And does he fit your master plan
I feel it hard to search for something new
I sent you a letter
I thought it be better than calling you
I'm missing you
I'm the man you never knew
Always blue over you
And I can't help it
I can not fake it
For I still love you
I can see the starts above
They watch us live
They shine upon our fragile lives.and cry
Can I ask you why we turn our heads the other way
And look for something we will never find
Imaginary day.when pain is washed away
Waiting for freedom
Give us reason to live
Missing you
A hotel where nobody stays
A piano that nobody plays
Is what my heart feels like
Empty room cold dark stairway
You left me brokenhearted
All alone on the road to somewhere
I'm missing you
I'm the man you never knew
Always blue over you
And I can't help it
I can not fake it
For I still love you <start> My eyes adored you though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you like a million miles away from me
You couldn't see how I adored you
So close so close and yet so far
Carried your books from school
Playin' make believe you're married to me
You were fifthgrade I was sixth when we came to be
Walkin' home ev'ry day over Bonnicut Bridge and Bay
Till we grew into the me and you who went our separate ways
My eyes adored you though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you like a million miles away from me
You couldn't see how I adored you
So close so close and yet so far
Headed for city lights climbed the ladder up to fortune and fame
I worked my fingers to the bone made myself a name
Funny I seemed to find that no matter how the years unwind
Still I reminisce 'bout the girl I miss and the love I left behind
My eyes adored you though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you like a million miles away from me
You couldn't see how I adored you
So close so close and yet so far
All my life I will remember how warm and tender we were way back then

Whoa baby

Oh the feeling sad regrets I know I won't ever forget you
My childhood friend
 <start> Don't wanna calm down
And I'm not gonna wise up
'Cause I wanna feel something
That sets me in motion

 <start> The mime's conceit has conquered over real beauty
Grinning from a mask of hollowed bone
Where a human is somewhere to be found
But where I don't know
And things couldn't be better
From behind the halls we cannot pass
Hear the muffled traces of a boyish laugh
Hear the monster screaming What have I become
Before his lookingglass
And things couldn't be better
This is one fine life
This is one fine wine
This is one fine wife
This is one fine lie
And things couldn't be better
They are the best <start> There's not a day that goes pass by
that I don't think about you
About what you do to me baby

Object of Obsession
There's a part of me that's longing

Before you accuse me take a look at yourself

But you've been runnin' with somebody else
I called your mama 'bout three or four nights ago
I called your mama 'bout three or four nights ago
Well your mother said 'son
Don't call my daughter no more'
Before you accuse me take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me take a look at yourself
Well now you say I've been runnin' around
But you got somebody else
Come on back home baby try my love one more time
Come on back home baby try my love one more time

Your heartbeat for us

When your baby don't love you
Kind of a drag
When you know she's been untrue
Oh oh listen to what I've gotta to say
Girl I still love you
I'll always love you
Anyway anyway anyway
Kind of a drag
When your baby says goodbye
Kind of a drag
When you feel like you want to cry
Girl even though you make me feel blue
I still love you
I'll always love you
Anyway anyway anyway <start> Tale of the traitors. Pretty pretty twin sisters.
Be kind be shy were all lies. Witty wicked destroyers.
Tale of killers They're killers.
Showed my back and so long.
Never be traitors. Pretty pretty twin sisters.
So fine so shine what we had.
Tricky two heads deceivers. <start> Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind
But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely lonely times
I guess I never told you
That I am so happy that you're mine
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind
But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Tell me tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied
I'll keep you satisfied
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind <start> I'm the only one who ever sits here
So thank God for me
You're the lonley one with the waffle house apron
Who gets of on me
You're the apron string that's tied so tight
Around my middle
Truckers drunks and cowboys come to beg for seconds
from your griddle
How can they think to judge us
They don't even know who we are
In the future i see us running
Somewhere other than a parked car
Three o'clock there's only empty seats and orthapedic shoes
Sit down in my booth and tell me about country dancing
and what else you like to do
You're the only one in this town who can look down on me
No matte rhow you feel all you done and where you been
Come and sit down with me <start> Movin' at the speed of sound
There has never been a lull in the motion
Conversations swirl around
Strangers questioning their devotion
Welcome to the world of talk shows
Where everybody seems to know
People talk and never listen
Come to their conclusions
So we'll feed 'em with the spoon
That makes the medicine go down
Baby you got it
Baby we wrote it
Maybe you thought that we sugar coat it
Aint gonna hide it
Gotta expose it
Yeah we're gonna let our light shine
Standing on the stage of life
We are waiting for the final curtain
You can take a seat and watch tonight
But you're gonna get more than you came for
Bam
And welcome to our jam
Where folks are getting down
The Jesus freaks from every part of this here town
You can try and ask us why
We came to this solution
Though words may fly
You can't deny
It's in the air tonight
Baby you got it
Baby we wrote it
Maybe you thought that we sugar coat it
Aint gonna hide it
Gotta expose it
Yeah we're gonna let our light shine
Boom
They thought we'd change our tune
They thought that we'd go bust
They thought we'd crumble like my grandma's flaky crust
Kapow
up in the here and now
The truth is screaming BIG
A light so bright
Whether day or night
It can't be hid
Baby you got it
Baby we wrote it
Aint gonna hide it
Yeah we're gonna let our love light shine
Baby you got it
Baby we wrote it
Maybe you thought that we sugar coat it
Aint gonna hide it
Gotta expose it

Sugar coat it <start> Well the train I ride
Is leaving the station
And the train I ride
To my destination
I was walking
Now I'm travelin' in style
I was walking
Now I've got me a ride
Well I got no need
For no company
Got my blues guitar
That's all I need
I ain't walking
Now I'm travelin' in style
I ain't walking
Now I've got me a ride
Think I've come to
The end of my song
If you feel you want to
Why don't you sing along
I ain't walking
Now I'm travelin' in style
I ain't walking
Now I've got me a ride
I ain't walking
Now I'm travelin' in style
I ain't walking

Now I'm travelin' in style
I ain't walking
Now I've got me a ride. <start> With the money from her accident
She bought herself a mobile home
So at least she could get some enjoyment
Out of being alone
No one could say that she was left up on the shelf
It's you and me against the World kid she mumbled to herself
When the world falls apart some things stay in place
Levi Stubbs' tears run down his face
She ran away from home on her mother's best coat
She was married before she was even entitled to vote
And her husband was one of those blokes
The sort that only laughs at his own jokes
The sort a war takes away
And when there wasn't a war he left anyway
Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong
Are here to make everything right that's wrong
Holland and Holland and Lamont Dozier too
Are here to make it all okay with you
One dark night he came home from the sea
And put a hole in her body where no hole should be
It hurt her more to see him walking out the door
And though they stitched her back together they left her heart in pieces on the floor
When the world falls apart some things stay in place
She takes off the Four Tops tape and puts it back in its case
When the world falls apart some things stay in place
Levi Stubbs' tears <start> Do you know do you know where you really wanna go
Do you see do you see what you wanna see
Apologies apologies now I'm begging on my knees
On my knees on my knees just to let you know
This is me I can't be someone else
I'm alone I'm alone sinking further down a hole
Down a hole down a hole where the echoes lead
I don't know I don't know how to find a weave and flow
Weave and flow weave and flow will I ever see
This is me I can't be someone else
I won't be someone else
Is the the end of the road
Senses been out of control
It's not easy to know
Is this the end of the road
What I need what I need is a reason to believe
To believe to believe will I ever know
If I leave if I leave I will feel like a disease
A disease a disease too or let me so
This is me I can't be someone else
This is me I can't be someone else
I won't be someone else
Is the the end of the road
Senses been out of control
It's not easy to know
Is this the end
Is this the end of the road
Where is my home where is my home
Where is my...
Where is my home where is my home
Where is my...
Where is my home where is my...
Where is my home where is my home
Is the the end of the road
Senses been out of control
It's not easy to know
Is this the end
Is the the end of the road <start> The days are blood No beginning no end Bleeding like a fountain pen The days are blood Alarm clock rips open my eyes I'm so tired Staring at the black spots before my eyes Am I alive Mirror showing bloodshot eyes It never lies Another day on the  to  No when's or whys These days of blood eyes of fire I gave at the office I gave at the bank I gave to my friends I gave to my enemies You tell me it's better to give than to receive So tell me why is it you that's bleeding me  O'clock  got to wake up Wake up Look in the mirror see my face See the traces of yesterday Oh for yesterday Oh for tomorrow The days are blood Bleeding into each other The days are blood And I'm drowning And as I watch the evening news I realize Telling me of the day's slaughter I realize Spilling innards on my dreams I realize As I bleed cold sleep sweat I realize The nights are blood too. <start> There once was a boy named Pierre
Who only would say
I don't care.
Hear his story my friend for you'll find at the end that a suitable moral lies there
One day his mother said as Pierre climbed out of bed
Good morning darling boy you are my only joy.
Pierre said
I don't care.
What would you like to eat
I don't care.
Some lovely cream of wheat
I don't care.
Don't sit backwards on your chair.
I don't care.
Or pour syrup on your hair.
I don't care .
You are acting like a clown.
I don't care.
And we have to go to town.
I don't care.
Don't you want to come my dear
I don't care.
Would you rather stay right here
I don't care.
So his mother left him there.
His father said Get off your head
Or I will march you up to bed
Pierre said
I don't care.
I would think that you could see
I don't care.
Your head is where your feet should be.
I don't care.
If you keep standing upside down
I don't care.
We'll never never get to town
I don't care.
If only you would say I care
I don't care.
I'd let you fold the folding chair
I don't care.
So his parents left him there.
They didn't take him anywhere.
Now as the night began to fall
A hungry lion paid a call.
He looked Pierre right in the eye
And asked him would you like to die
And Pierre said
I don't care.
I can eat you don't you see
I don't care.
Then you would be inside of me
I don't care.
Then you'd never have to bother
I don't care.
With the mother and your father
I don't care.
Is that all you have to say
I don't care.
Then I'll eat you if I may.
So the lion ate Pierre.
Arriving home at  o'clock
His parents had a dreadful shock.
They found the lion sick in bed.
They cried Pierre is surely dead
They pulled the lion by the hair
They hit him with the folding chair.
His mother cried where is Pierre
And the lion answered
I don't care
His father said
Pierre's in there
They rushed the lion into the town.
The doctor shook him up and down.
And when the lion gave a roar
Pierre fell out upon the floor.
He rubbed his eyes and scratched his head
And laughed because he wasn't dead.
His mother cried and held him tight.
His father asked Are you alright
Pierre said I am feeling fine
Please take me home it's half past nine
The lion said If you would care
To climb on me I'll take you there
Then everyone looked at Pierre
Who shouted Yes indeed I care
The lion took them home to rest
Then stayed on as a weekend guest.
The moral of Pierre is care <start> So quickly draining away
If you could only hear all the things you used to say
Consumed now by what you knew was poisonous
Quenching your thirst for life for life
Will you die die for me
Will you live live for me
Kill aspirations away
Embrace a dream that was a nightmare only yesterday
True friends forgotten and all hopes been traded in
Exchanged for what for what for what
Will you die die for me
Will you live live for me
Die for me you gave it all away
Live for me you gave it all away
All at once you gave it all away
All is lost
Will you die die for me
Will you live live for me
Will you die die for me
Will you live live for me
Lost <start> I look around and it's the same old situation on a different day
These masses of confrontation beating me down
I'm picking at the pieces to put them all back into place
A never ending crossword of questions collaborates
While asking myself where are we going in time
But hey everyday I'll pick my feet up off the ground
And everyday you'll see I don't make believe
That everything is okay but in the end
The life that you choose to lead is your fate
You'll see
Communication with yourself and asking
Is this really where I want to be
No way
Patronized antagonized and bound beyond
the boundaries of everyday life
A mutual enmity for a system of conformity and asking myself
Is this really where I want to be
Anchors away don't let it drag you down oh no
But hey everyday I'll pick my feet up off the ground
And everyday you'll see I don't make believe
That everything is okay but in the end
The life that you choose to lead is your fate
You'll see... 
Well I know by now but keep wondering how
How many times will I fall
I'll keep standing tall
Everything you talk about and everything you see
Everybody's trying to tell you who you want to be
Don't try to separate reality from dreaming
Trust yourself keep on believing
I think I can is all that you can really tell yourself
Just keep on and moving my friend oh yeah someday you're gonna see
That hey everyday well I'll pick my feet up off the ground
And everyday you'll see I don't make believe
That everything is okay but in the end
The life that you choose to lead is your fate
You're gonna see <start> Bye bye 
It's the same old wind again that calls me
 bye bye 
On an ordinary day.
Bye bye 
Have you ever felt this lack of freedom
 bye bye 
Have you ever felt this way.
Leave it don't leave it  I have to leave
I can't go on pretending.
Nothing is real don't you feel
That every road is ending.
Don't ask why I have to leave you
Don't you try there have to be two.
We will never find a reason
We will never find a way
We will always run on empty
We will always run away.
We will never find the answer
As long as we don't understand
We can't walk this way together
We cannot take each others hand.
I've said it all  holy eyes 
No more sweet surrender.
Forget it all  no more lies
Soon we will remember that
Everything we tried to change
Stayed always and always and always
The same.
We will never find a reason
We will never find a way
We will always run on empty
We will always run away.
We will never find the answer
As long as we don't understand
We can't walk this way together
We cannot take each others hand.
We will never find a reason
We will never find a way
We will always run on empty
We cannot walk each other way.
We will never find the answer
As long as we don't understand
We can't walk this way together
We cannot take each others hand.
There's a light inside the hollow
There's a light behind the wall
But we've got different lights to follow
We have to fall so let us fall.
I was afraid  I couldn't hear you
I was ashamed but now I know
That we got different roads to follow
That we got different ways to go.
We will never find a reason.
We will never find a reason.
We will never find a reason
We will never find a way
We will always run on empty
We will always run away.
There's a light inside the hollow
There's a light behind the wall
But we've got different lights to follow
We have to fall so let us fall. <start> Parlano piano al sole le ombre stanche di rumorose rabbie e infinite
menzogne
Lunghe di sterminati fili in lunga fila sorde ai tonfi di corpi che
vengono abbattuti
Tra poco arrossa il cielo della sera sospeso tra azzurri spazi gelidi e
lande desolate
Quietami i pensieri e le mani e in questa veglia pacificami il cuore
Cos vanno le cose cos devono andare
Cos vanno le cose cos devono andare
S'alzano sotto cieli spenti i canti di chi nato alla terra ora di
volont focose speranze
E da energie costretto e si muove alla danza danza danza danza
danza danza danza
Festa stanotte di misere trib sparse impotenti di nuclei solitari che
raro di vedere insieme ancora
E s'alzano i canti e si muove la danza
E s'alzano i canti e si muove la danza danza danza danza danza
Muoiono i preti rinsecchiti e vecchi e muoiono i pastori senza mandrie
Spaventati i guerrieri persi alla meta i viaggiatori
La saggezza impazzita non sa l'intelligenza
La ragione nel torto conscia l'ingenuit
Ma non tacciono i canti e si muove la danza
Quietami i pensieri e il canto e in questa veglia pacificami il cuore
Cos vanno le cose cos devono andare
Cos vanno le cose cos devono andare
Chi c' c' e chi non c' non c'
Chi c' c' e chi non c' non c'
Chi stato stato e chi stato non
Chi c' c' e chi non c' non c'
Chi c' c' e chi non c' non c'
E non tacciono i canti e si muove la danza
E non tacciono i canti e si muove la danza
Danza danza danza danza danza danza danza danza...

Ease my troubled mind
I left my body lying somewhere
In the sands of time
I watched the world float to the dark
Side of the moon
I feel there is nothing I can do yeah
I watched the world float to the
Dark side of the moon
After all I knew it had to be something
To do with you
I really don't mind what happens now and then
As long as you'll be my friend at the end
If I go crazy then will you still
Call me Superman
If I'm alive and well will you be
There holding my hand
I'll keep you by my side with
My superhuman might
Kryptonite
You called me strong you called me weak
But still your secrets I will keep
You took for granted all the times I
Never let you down
You stumbled in and bumped your head if
Not for me then you'd be dead
I picked you up and put you back
On solid ground
If I go crazy then will you still
Call me Superman
If I'm alive and well will you be
There holding my hand
I'll keep you by my side with
My superhuman might
Kryptonite
Oh whoa whoa
If I go crazy then will you still
Call me Superman
If I'm alive and well will you be
There holding my hand
I'll keep you by my side with
My superhuman might
Kryptonite
If I go crazy then will you still
Call me Superman
If I'm alive and well will you be
There holding my hand
I'll keep you by my side with
My superhuman might
Kryptonite <start> Don't let them tell you that
You've got to change your way
Don't let them put you down
It's just another day
Don't let them get to you
Don't be afraid to try
They'll just take a look at you
And try to wonder why
You don't want anybody else
To try to run your life
You don't need anybody else
To make you sacrifice
We don't need anybody else
To take what's yours and mine
We don't need anybody else
It's just a waste of time
I see that look in your eye
I wanna know is it mine
I see that look in your eye
Tonight tonight
Don't let them tell you that
Don't let them put you down
Don't let them get to you
You've got to change your way
I don't need anybody else
To try and run my life
I don't need the way they try
To tell me what they think is right
We don't need anybody else
To take what's yours and mine
We don't need anybody else
It's just a waste of time
I see that look in your eye
I wanna know is it mine
I see that look in your eye <start> Tu es faible tu es fourbe tu es fou

Evelyne tu vois tu m'aimes encore. <start> Its a modest opinion that becomes the epitome of truth
As it builds up egos in your mind
They feast on your rejection your frivolous observation
Is you must change to survive
Now your stuck inside the play that society will write
Even the bright stars die yes they all die
Thats the reason why you missed why you slipped
Their decisions leave you dried out
Thats the treason thats the reason why you missed why you slipped
Their decisions leave you dried out
Its the weight of acceptance they fail to mention
Thatll bear down and crush you in time
When they pull on your strings to make you stand
Make you walk like a man how will you survive
When youve lost all your beliefs
When faiths hanging on by the skin of your teeth
Youll find that perfection is a lie it is a lie
When you realize theres no where you can run
Living up to expectations isnt fun
You can try to justify it but its wrong
And we all can get in line and follow along <start> Peguei minhas coisas fui embora
No queria mais voltar
Eu nunca quis presenciar o fim
H dias que os dias passam devagar
Tudo se foi nada restou pra mim
Por isso estou aqui agora
Vou embora sem pensar
No que ficou pra comear ali
Mas eu s tinha algumas horas pra voltar
Tudo se foi nada restou pra mim
So coisas que somente o tempo ir curar
Se for para nunca mais te ver chorar
So coisas que somente o tempo ir curar
Se foi tudo vai passar
Peguei minhas coisas 
No queria mais voltar
Eu nunca quis presenciar o fim
H dias que os dias passam devagar
Tudo se foi nada restou pra mim <start> If I had a world to give
If I had a life to live
Would you come to me
Would you come to me
And if I had the time in hand
Spelt out in grains of sand
Would you be with me
Would you be with me
You see that everything I do
Still leaves me lost and alone for you
If I could find some time
And a place to hide
I could sit right down and free my mind
One breath away
One breath away
And I know the past is dead and gone
Wasted emotions carry on
One breath away
One breath away my dear
Girl when you took me by the hand
You touched the child inside the man
And I was free
Yes I was me
But then love took a different turn
And now the child begins to burn
'cause I'm angry
'cause I can feel
You see that everything I do
Still leaves me lost and alone for you
And I was free
And I was free
If I could find some time
And a place to hide
I could sit right down and free my mind
One breath away
One breath away
And I know the past is dead and gone
Wasted emotions carry on
One breath away
One breath away my dear
Here comes the pressure
And it's coming down hard
My spirit is fading
But I'm still gonna fight
Here comes the pressure
And it's coming down hard
My spirit is fading
But I'm still gonna fight
If I could find some time
And a place to hide
I could sit right down and free my mind
One breath away
One breath away
And I know the past is dead and gone
Wasted emotions carry on
One breath away
One breath away my dear
One breath away
And that's the hardest breath to take my dear <start> I have found a lack of sympathy
for my chemically dependant brothers and sisters.
It disturbs me my eye rolling attitudes
I search through my studies of gods
I search for the compassion within me.
And I only have it half a day a week.
I try and I try and I try and I try
having myself cross the fucking death junk line
the forcid cock the back hand of love
I know I know I know I know
if I can get my shit clean after all the shit I seen
if I can still fall in love
and laugh my head off at my life
and my hard hard lessons.
Then why don't you you rich  yr. old junkie fuck
I want compassion for you but my friend I have none
You bear your victimization like a cross a crutch.
Your lazy its easier than to cop out than to rise above
believe me believe you me
I can't believe you but just to be nice
right now is that half a day a week
that ill make a search for compassion.
For you poor you you fucking white millionaire
My eyes are aching from roll. <start> Let the wind blow
Let the grass grow
But don't let her go
Don't take her out of my life
Don't take her out of my life
Let the moon glow


On the fallen snow


But I just got to know

Know she'll be a part of my life
Know she'll be a part of my life
Forever
Let the bees make honey
Let the poor find money
Take away their sorrows
Give them sunshine tomorrow
But don't take her out of my life
Don't take her out of my life
What would I do without her tell me now
Let the bird sing
With the coming spring
Let the church bells ring
Let the rain fall
Let the grass grow
Let the moon glow
On the fallen snow
But don't take her out of my life
Please keep her a part of my life <start> Uno dos tres kwatro
CHORUS
Lintik na pagibig
Parang kidlat
Puso kong tahimik na naghihintay
Bigla mong ginulat
'Di ko man lang napansin ang iyong pagdating
Daig mo pa ang isang bagyong namuo sa malayo
Ihip ng hangin biglang nagiba
Sinundan pa ng kulog at kidlat
Sa biglang buhos ng iyo sa akin
Ako'y napakanta
Repeat CHORUS twice
Mga halik mo't mga lambing inuulan mo sa akin
Binabagyo Binabaha na ako ng iyong mga carinio
Nananaginip ba ako nang gising
Ay tinamaan ng magaling
Nadali mo ang puso ko ng iyong kidlat
Repeat CHORUS twice
AD LIB
Lintik lintik woh woh woh
Parang kidlat
Repeat nd Stanza
Repeat CHORUS twice
Lintik lintik woh woh woh
Parang kidlat <start> Years have past and times gone by
It's times like this that I realize that
Some people stay and some people go
But how in the hell are we suppose to know
Just what to do and how to do it
Someone tell me how to get through this
In the back that's where you belong
I'll go crazy before it's too long
I look around but I can't see
What's going on or what's happening to me
Another day and I'll have to deal
Never losing touch of what is real
I'd do it all again but not quite the same
The thin I thought was normal turned out
To be insane
Forgive me not or forgive me do
I'll do my best to forget about you <start> Is this the one thought it was insane
Coming down against it all
Didn't want it. Didn't need it. Didn't want it.
Twisted face of feigning beauty
Count the cost of suffering
Cannot see the day before you
Only feel what's deep inside
Trying to change it makes no difference
Didn't want it. Didn't need it. Didn't want it.
Didn't want it. Didn't need it. Didn't want it.
Let me go
Looking outside inside craving for something
Hoping for anything I'll believe in anything
Who has eyes that see who wants to believe
In something in anything In one thing in freedom
Looking outside inside
Self assist pandemonium broken promises
Died alive flying high you caught me in your eye
Disintegrated incinerated this is not how I want to be
Too much is coming through someone please tell me what to do
Looking outside inside <start> oreta awai tsubasa

Dancing on a sea
Racing on my memories
I'm glad I set my dreams
Tip toe tip toe quickly
Forget about your cares
And remember underneath you
Is just a sea of air
Just remember underneath you
Is just a sea of air
Wishing on your wishes
Landin on a storm
Knowing when you are dancing
Knowing that's so far
Dance Dance faster
Madly dance away
Cause remeber underneath you
Is just a sea of air
Just remember underneath you
Is just a sea of air

Don't complain never seems too late

Ah cause I'm not sitting on the golden gate
Love and a peace and war and hate
No no no no no
Well I'm not gonna sit around and wait
All I'm a doing is losing my face
Oh no no no
But we're all on station that's for sure
Searchin is an endless
Well there ain't no care
Ah oo <start> Crywolf
I'm reading what I wrote about your words and how you sang to me
That night up on the awning I saw love pour out of every street
And all these memories surround me pulling me back for more
I'm lightly fading in the background laying upon your shore
You tore the towers down
Stumbled through the room
Broke the golden vow
Saw you swimming in it
My eyes were wide as hell
I saw the cancer move
Throughout your dying shell
Saw you swimming in it
You thought your arms were weak
Thought my hand was cruel
You couldn't see it then
Saw you swimming in the flood
I remember how you moved how you shot how you're breaking me
I never wanna fool you I'm swallowed up in everything
I'm writing giant words of epic works and stories of your watery womb
The hose is burst I sputtered out I'm spilled across the ground for you
You tore the towers down
Stumbled through the room
Broke the golden vow
Saw you swimming in it
My eyes were wide as hell
I saw the cancer move
Throughout your dying shell
Saw you swimming in it
You thought your arms were weak
Thought my hand was cruel
You couldn't see it then
Saw you swimming in the flood
Ohhh
Ohhh
Ohhh
Saw you swimming in the flood <start> Weaver of life let me look and see
The pattern of my life gone by
Shown on your tapestry
Just for one second one glance upon your loom
The flower of my childhood could appear within this room
Does it of my youth show tears of yesterday
Broken hearts within a heart as love first came my way
Did the lifeline patterns change as I became a man
An added aura untold blends as I asked for her hand
Did your golden needle sow its thread virginal white
As lovers we embraced as one upon our wedding night
Did you capture all the joys the birth of our first son
The happiness of family made a brother for the one
The growing of the brothers the manliness that grew
Is it there in detail is it there to view
Do the sparks of life grow bright as one by one they wed
To live as fathers husbands apart from lives they've led
Are my lover's threads cut off when aged she laid to rest
My sorrow blacking out a space upon our woven crest
A gathering for the last time as her coffin slowly lain
Ash to ashes dust to dust one day we will regain
Does it show the visits when grandchildren on my knee
But only hearing laughter when age took my sight from me
Lastly through these last few years of loniless maybe
Does by sight a shooting star fade from your tapestry
But wait there in the distance your loom I think I see
Could it be that after all my prayers you've answered me
After days of wondering I see the reason why
You've kept it to this minute for I'm about to die
Weaver of life at last now I can see
The pattern of my life gone by upon your tapestry <start> Well talk about the other side
Oh it's not so pretty
Release a modest sigh
You always took it out on me
Let me persuade you now
This could be the time
To look up our alien friends
This would be the perfect time
And than you would be the only man
Who walked on mars on mars on mars
You'll have craters and real life space invaders
on your mind on your mind
If all this stuf is not enough
Just not enough to give this up
I'll be a volunteer
Make me make me make me come along
I'm ready I'll sign up for a holiday on mars
We'll have craters and real life space invaders
on our minds
Well this could be an alibi
you need sleep and I can fly
I could even change a fuse
and it makes me happy to be used
You've got visions I've got mine
We'll have a real good time
Never took it out on you
Take me take me take me there with you
I'm ready I'll sign up for a holiday
on mars on mars on mars
We'll have craters and real life space invaders
on our minds <start> You're no longer part of my life
I must remind myself again
Too much has happened to us to cause eachother pain
It's over now there's too much guilt to share
Once there would have been a time for talking and learning
There must be some other way
To get where we have to go
There must be some other way
Please show me another way
Once it would have been so easy to do what we have to do
There must be some other way
Please show me another way
Are we no more than parts in a play
Letting other people strangers say our lines
To think it should come to this after all these years
What was mine and what should stay behind
Once there would have been a time of sharing of caring
There must be some other way
To get where we have to go
There must be some other way
Please show me another way
Once it would have been so easy to do what we have to do

There must be some other way
Please show me show me another way
There's nothing much left to say
We have said it once and said it all again
This time we have gone too far it could never be the same
It's time to carry on create new lives
Once we promised we would stay together forever
There must be some other way
To get where we have to go 
There must be some other way
Please show me another way
Once it would have been so easy to do what we have to do 
You know there must be some other way
Please show me another way
You know there must be another way
Please show me show me another way 
You know there must be some other way <start> She won't let me be

Chorus
Don't want to get it dirty
Won't take me for a ride
Don't want to get it dirty
Don't want to lose that shine
She likes to drive real fast
I like to make it last a long time
Never seen a girl who could talk so much
So educated but so outta touch oh yeah
She never lets her top down
She's the sweetest thing to ever wear high heels
And drives the finest set of wheels but she
Chorus
Don't want to get dirty
I'm out to change her mind
Let me behind the wheel baby I can drive it
Just watch
Candy apple red so brand new
Just want to see what it can really do
She says don't want to don't want to

Good girls are hard to find
Don't want to get it dirty
I'm out to change her mind listen to me baby
Don't want to get it dirty
Let's have some fun tonight
Don't want to get it dirty
Let me take you for a ride

Don't want to get it dirty
Don't want to get it dirty

Don't close your eyes
'Cause you know that ain't right
Then you should leave me out
Might as well just leave me out
Let's kick in the doors and let
me feel you now
I'll give you ambition
To one day kick and shout
You'd better kick and shout
Might as well just kick and shout
'Cause when you are young
You'll have fun in the sun
You'd better leave your smile on
So keep your mind ready
Your body and soul
You're on the run
Keep your mind ready
Your body and soul
You're on the run now
Let's go
I want love 
'Cause when you are young you'll have fun leave your smile on
when you are young you'll have fun leave your smile on 
 I want love
I'm talking good old love
Keep on love 
Good old love <start> is it too much love
is it too much pain
do you like to see  me cry
is it all that I will get
I am on my way
I nearly loose my mind
do you like to make  me cry
is it all that I will get
I don't realy know
why I love you so
but I know that it is true
yes I know now
now that you're gone
I'm having cheap thrill fun
and I now that it is time
yes know now
I know now <start> from Unreleased
..............................................
There was a long haired guy who drew a crowd outside
He got them all angry over national pride
He was talking of the war that's on our shore
And how we've never had to fight so hard beforer
It's a war to fight and a war to win he said
But how do we strike and where to begin
We want to kill those guilty of the crimes they've made
But they don't live in one city there's no fortress to invade
This war is psychological and it starts right here
So in my defiance I will not live in fear
Because fear is their weapon so I won't give in to that
They know that fear turns to rage and thats just their trap
The way they win is to make us strike back
They want us to launch a dreadful counterattack
The more people that die at the hand of our nation
The more hate it will breed in the next generation
In this kind of war they're not after our land
They want their children's blood on our vengeful hands
They want to make us act like an angry mob
So we look like a bully that hates their god
Their plan is to hurt us with our own brute force
Like a herd stampeding down a deadly course
If they can get us running with a rage like this
They can lead the free world off the edge of a cliff
And the cliff is to fall for the trap they've sprung
To make us play the role of the vengeful one
They want us to chase them and hunt them down
To kill their people and burn their towns
The few guilty people are happy to die
If they can make us kill a few thousand more besides
Becuase the death of the innocents just fuels the flame
Until the next war starts and its all the same
And the future unfolds for a hundred years
As the terror grows and it breeds more fear
So who will decide the future of our nation
Will we follow along with their invitation
The invitation is to trust our hate
To let revenge define our fate
To never see that it's a different war
And we can't fight the same way we fought before
We're not hunted by a tiger or a lion or a shark its more
Like FIRE that's the danger and the enemy's a spark
But the trickiest spin that the devil could twist
Was convincing the world that he didn't exist
If you don't believe in evil then they're just dangerous men
And you'll fight fire with fire and you'll be just like them
An eye for an eye time after time
Eye after eye until the whole world is blind
If our enemy is evil like a virus of the mind
And its moving through the body of all humankind
Then the evil brilliance of this virus which is hate
Is that our natural reaction makes it replicate
We want to shoot at a target thats easy to find
But the enemy is in us  all humankind
We want to kill the invader like we could in the past
But you can't kill a virus with a shotgun blast
This is not a nation that we're up against
If it's good against evil what's our best defense
The man on the street was drawing a crowd
Some people got angry and voices got loud
The crowd answered back to the sidewalk guy
That we must have revenge for the people that died
But the man kept talking about love and light
As if that were any way to fight the fight
And a scuffle started and they hauled him in
He was convicted of crimes and convicted of sins
And for national safety and religious pride
That sidewalk preacher was crucified

David Wilcox  copyright  <start> Born Above  
In the day he went about on the streets doin' run of the mill Pharisee things
At night he met with his master the lord and said Show us what you mean
I'm a sage but you're highly divine
Your wisdom's respected
You're second to none top of the line
Oh Jesus said if you're born from above you can give that
You can go around magic gotta get it while you're young
But you can't find much baby 'til you're born above
That's what he told them
Then he said to them you must be born again if you want god to increase your vision
Just like the wind blows just where it wills the same thing happens to Christians
You never see it make its path
But somehow you know  baby whenever it blows past
Oh you walk with me out on the water
'Cause baby I can prepare you to know the Father if you wanna know here's the deal
You must become a little child if you wanna know that God is real
Oh let me show you
John  yeah
Beyond this planet heaven's got a home seems like it's really far
The world's unaware but it's really near and you don't have to look so hard
The amusing part is it's there in your heart yet somehow out of reach in your midst
You'd either die with your dignity or you'd wait to die an everlasting death huh
One two three four
The highway's jammed with folks who's experience is gonna get them burned alive
Well everybody was on the road to God but there's no way there but mine
To get there Nicky we can live at this address
I'll scrub you of all the badness in your soul
Oh someday when you're born again
You're gonna get to that place you really wanna go
And you'll walk with the Son
But 'til then can't find much
Baby 'til you're born above
Come on honey
Can't find much
Baby 'til you're born above
Come on Nicky
Can't find much
Baby 'til you're born above
Woah

Whaahoooo

Hmm
Whoa
Whoa
Whaahahahooo <start> Once again I'm stuck in here
Once again I'm in low gear
Once again I have a fear
Once again I'm stuck in here
Hey just close the door
Think back and just ignore
Hey just close your eyes
Think back and realize
Oh no I'm stuck in here
Oh no still stuck in here
What makes you think that it's okay
Don't start it off don't relate
Take the job but not the pay
Forget the hours but not the day
Hey just close your eyes
Think back and realize
Hey just close the door
Back up and just ignore
Oh no i'm stuck in here <start> Could fill spoons full of diamonds
Could fill spoons full of gold.
Just a little spoon of your precious love
Will satisfy my soul.
Chorus
Men lies about it.
Some of them cries about it.
Some of them dies about it.
Everything's afightin' about the spoonful.
That spoon that spoon that spoonful.
That spoon that spoon that spoonful.
That spoon that spoon that spoonful.
That spoon that spoon that spoonful.
Could fill spoons full of coffee
Could fill spoons full of tea.
Just a little spoon of your precious love
Is that enough for me
Chorus
Could fill spoons full of water
Save them from the desert sands.
But a little spoon of your fortyfive
Save you from another man.

And I can't fix this anymore
Feels like the clock on wall stopped
And you're one foot out the door
What's the point in talking talking
If you're already walking walking
If you're really leaving leaving
Go go
Coz I'm on my knees
You're gonna have to
Step over me
If you're gonna shoot me down down down down down
Pull the trigger now pull the trigger now
If you're gonna shoot me down down down down down
Pull the trigger now
So call in your giant wrecking ball
Knock down this house around my head
Push me off my pedistal
Don't chip away my confidence
What's the point of talking talking
If you're already walking walking
If you're really leaving leaving
Go go
Coz I'm on my knees
You're gonna have to
Step over me
If you're gonna shoot me down down down down down
Pull the trigger now pull the trigger now

There's no ugly city in my backyard
Underneath the trees there's a little stream
And that's where I go to dream <start> I'm a junkie.
I'm a whore.
That's what you always called me.
I am raw
An open sore.
I ache to remind me
I'm a weakling
You are strong.
Pick me up from where I lay.
Here on a stolen sidewalk.
Baby don't make me beg
I'm religious once again.
We all are before we die
And I am so sick to death.
Wasted tears I cry.
And who said love would always mend
And fill the emptiness again.
Should light a single candle
Make a prayer in my name.
I'm a weakling
You are strong.
Pick me up from where I lay.
Here on a stolen sidewalk.
Baby don't make me beg.
I am not right
You're not wrong.
I can't last another day.
Here on a stolen sidewalk.
Baby don't make me beg
The closest thing I found to heaven
Is sitting here talking to you
I'm the queen of western paradise
Don't you know
Nothing left for me to do.
I'm a weakling
You are strong.
Pick me up from where I lay.
Here on a stolen sidewalk.
Baby don't make me beg.
I am not right
You're not wrong.
I can't last another day.
Here on a stolen sidewalk.
Baby don't make me beg <start> Never tell your friends
They'll never understand
Confessions only burn themselves in the fire
Choke on every word
That no one's ever heard
Your sentimental thoughts are strangled and tired
See it in another light
You'll see it working out alright
I know I won't change any mind
As long as their still changing mine
As simple as they can
They're telling you again
What they think you've done is so unbecoming
But you don't have to take
Every old mistake
And always see it as a fall while you're running
Saw it on other light
I saw it work out alright
I know I won't change your mind
As long as they're changing mine <start> You wash them clothes
Swee dee dee
And hang 'em on the line
I can see by the way
You wash them clothes
Your cookin' must be fine
I'm with you in the morning
'Til the break of day
And I know everybody
Has a little hard luck
Sometimes
And I know lately
I've been havin' mine
We used to live
In a fleabag apartment
You know the kind
And he come home and he'd say to me
We gotta leave leave leave the city
You wash them clothes
Swee dee dee
And hang 'em on the line
I can see by the way you wash them clothes
Your cookin' must be fine

There's thorns on the rose
There's thorns in the heart of me
That nobody knows
They tear at the flesh until
The tears start to rise
They form in my heart
But they fall from Anastasia's eyes.
And I was lost in the wilderness
Without courage or hope
I was setting my signal fires
And watching the smoke
When out of the smoke appeared
The sweetest surprise
And I knew I'd been found
When first I looked in
To Anastasia's eyes.
There's thorns on the cactus tree
There's thorns on the rose
There's thorns in the heart of me
That nobody knows
But finally I've found out where
My salvation lies
It lies in the love that lives
In Anastasia's eyes <start> Don't the hours grow shorter as the days go by
You never get to stop and open your eyes
One day you're waiting for the sky to fall
The next you're dazzled by the beauty of it all
When you're lovers in a dangerous time
Lovers in a dangerous time
These fragile bodies of touch and taste
This vibrant skin this hair like lace
Spirits open to the thrust of grace
Never a breath you can afford to waste
When you're lovers in a dangerous time
Lovers in a dangerous time
When you're lovers in a dangerous time
Lovers in a dangerous time
When you're lovers in a dangerous time
Sometimes you're made to feel as if your love's a crime
But nothing worth having comes without some kind of fight
Got to kick at the darkness 'til it bleeds daylight
When you're lovers in a dangerous time
When you're lovers in a dangerous time
When you're lovers in a dangerous time
Lovers in a dangerous time
Lovers in a dangerous time
Lovers in a dangerous time
Lovers in a dangerous time <start> Its sad to see your art
Hanging on the wall
So many pictures there
But yours the best of all
I like the Indian
The one in ballpoint ink
In ancient Massachusetts
Long before you called
You traded him and many others
For a drink
Your fingers thick from hammers
Well it really makes you think
And then my father
Would fill your glass so tall
When I was a kid
I gophered in your crew
Always a kind word
And you showed me what to do
And living hammered
Well it's always hit or miss
But through your cigarette stained beard
Your love rang true
And though you are so loved
It had to come to this
You got shut off
Because you always stink of piss
And now you drink someplace
Where no one bothers you
Oh Fitzy oh Fitzy
Oh Fitzy oh Fitzy
Oh Fitzy oh Fitzy <start> Kathy please just go away
Don't let Hazel see you when you're high
Just take a walk to your sleazy bar
Come back after I've come down
Cross the street
On your knees
Makes me ashamed
It's hard to sleep
I can't shake your pain
You get high you'd just throw it away
Hey Kathy please give me a break
I told you not to come here when you're drunk again
I'm sober now just  days
All alone and working hard to stay that way
Cross the street
On your knees
Makes it hard
It's hard to see
I can't shake your pain
You get high you'd just throw it away
Kathy please yeah yeah
I don't want to see you when you're down
Just leave me be and go away
You're not going to pull me down
I won't let you throw it away <start> We are the ones who will never be broken
We are the ones who survive
This is the sound that brings us together
You are the one by our side
Chorus
And through it all the spirit's alive
And through it all your spirit's alive
You are the memory that lives on forever
The shadow that stands by our side
This is the sound that keeps us together
We are the ones who survive
Chorus
Farewell my brother
You're off to the big rink in the sky
The good lord's between the pipes
And you've got Bavis and Ace on the wing
We are the ones who will never be broken
We are the ones who survive

This is the sound that brings us together
You are the one by our side <start> High class

I never seen a smile that looked so sad
You make me feel so good 'cause you're so bad
Hey little darlin'
Your love is legendary
Love's four letters
Ain't in my dictionary
'Scuse my position
But it ain't missionary
Yeah but I want to
Walk on the water with you

Hotpants
Tan line
Sweet stuff

Knocked Up

When it comes to makin' love I ain't no hype

Your love is legendary
Love's four letters
Ain't in my dictionary
'Scuse my position
But it ain't missionary
Yeah but I want to
Walk on the water with you
Well the cook's in the kitchen
And hidin' the spoons
I'm winkin' at witches
And howlin' at moons
I'm afraid of the candle
But Live for the flame
You know who I am
But you don't know my name

Hey little darlin'
Your love is legendary
Love's four letters
Ain't in my dictionary
'Scuse my position
But it ain't missionary
Yeah but I want to
Walk on the water with you
Hey little darlin'
Your love is legendary
You got the boo yah
It's almost ficitonary
'Scuse my position
But it ain't missionary
Yeah but I want to
Walk on the water with you <start> Every day was glowing like a prefect day in summer
You'd never know rain
If it was always the same
We need a bitter taste of fallin'
How to feel it back to know when it's right
To walk in the light
Sometimes you pull me back
Back from the edge
I rescue you
Back from the dead
We got lost along the way but we got here in the end
I know
He was worth waiting for
He was worth waiting for
Even with my friends I felt like I was just pretending
To know what it was
Turn it into a song
Somehow we're still standing after all the shattered plans
That faded away
Now there's only today <start> I see you tempt the night
I see you take a bite
You can tell me you were home
But the camera never lies
You walk out in disguise
To pull the wool over my eyes
You play me for a fool
To believe your alibis
And you can count on being safe as houses
Underestimate my eyes
But you can't argue with the image
The camera never lies
There's no distance put between us
Safe enough for you to hide
I'm watching all of your secrets
The camera never lies
I recommend first prize
For acting so surprised
For acting like you love me
The camera never lies
I'll take my wounded pride
I'll take it on the chin
Your profile fills the frame
How good you look on film
Smoke screens and sweet deceiving
Replace the face of trust
The shutter falls each time you meet him
A negative becomes my plus <start> New York City Subway Station
A million people and you were stickin' out
Smashed thumb and so pretty
I wonder what you're all about
Crowded train separation
But still I see you in the corner of my eye
Busy station anticipation
For you to turn around and see me smile
And you look so trendy
Spaghetti straps and six inch soles
I just looked down and didn't see me
Are you an uptight turn around no esteem wreck like me
So long SOHO
I just sat and watched you go
Take good care and always know
I'll always know that you are there somewhere
Dark hair a fair complexion
I memorize your face and eyes
The door is open and I don't see you
And through the window you turn and smile
And you look so trendy
Spaghetti straps and six inch soles
I just looked down and didn't see me
Are you an uptight turnaround no esteem wreck like me
So long SOHO
I just sat and watched you go
Take good care and always know
I'll always know that you are there somewhere
So long SOHO

Three vodka sevens and a J
I won't remember anything

This all just make no sense to me
For seven weeks you're in my dreams

Nothing's quite the same
I know your face but not your name

I hope someday you'll hear this song
And one day I'll see you sing along
So long SOHO
I just sat and watched you go
Take good care and always know
I'll always know that you are there
So long SOHO
I just sat and watched you go
Take good care and always know
I'll always know that you are there

Now I have something
I proved them all they were wrong
So glad I kept fighting
And I never stopped trying
Been waiting to sing for so long
My winner's song
I couldn't carry on
I thought my chance had gone
I was ready to stop and give in
I thought I'd give it one last try
Look this moment in the eye
Then maybe who knows I could win
I dreamed about this for a lifetime
But I could not imagine
What it feels like standing here right now
I started with nothing
Now I have something
I proved them all they were wrong
So glad I kept fighting
And I never stopped trying
Been waiting to sing for so long
My winner's song
This journey's been incredible
Now standing in the light
I hope this lasts for more than one night
One night
I started with nothing
Now I have something
I proved them all they were wrong
So glad I kept fighting
And I never stopped trying

What Emma knows
And what I know is that whenever we're apart
She will be missing me
And I'll be missing her dreadfully
And very special to me
She's gone to university
Maybe she's sleeping now
Or wide awake with a friend
It doesn't bother me
'Cause pretty soon she will be next to me
Because she loves me you see
And then she'll smile as she opens her eyes
And kiss me when the morning comes
What Emma doesn't know
I treasure everything about her so
And every second that she spends with me
I get the feeling that she doesn't believe
It is essential to me
To have her smile as she opens her eyes
And kiss me when the morning comes
I will dive off the edge of the world
I will fly to wherever you are
I will fly I will dive I will care for you baby <start> Night and stars above that shine so bright
The myst'ry of their fading light
That shines upon our caravan
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep
Across the sand so I may keep
The mem'ry of our caravan
This is so exciting
You are so inviting
Resting in my arms
As I thrill to the magic charms
Of you beside me here beneath the blue
My dream of love is coming true
Within our desert caravan <start> Youre gonna tear down the walls
Youre gonna scream for change
Youre gonna make a difference now
Theyre gonna hear it again
Well I dont believe it
And I cant see it
There is a will and a way Im happy to say
But the answers not in your basement
This time  down time
Your covers blown youre on your own this time
Down time now youre on your own
Look around  up and down
There are people sleeping on the ground
There are problems way more real
Than a gang or a scene or a record deal
And I dont believe it <start> A mile and a half on a bus takes a long time
The odor of old prison food takes a long time to pass you by
When you've been inside
Day upon day of this wandering gets you down
Nobody gives you a chance or a dollar in this old town
Hovering silence from you is a giveaway
Squalor and smoke's not your style
i don't like this place
We better go
Then i compare notes with your older sister
I am a lazy get she is as pure as the cold driven snow
She accepts my confession
What did you learn from your time in the solitary
Cell of your mind
There was noises distractions from anything good
And the old prison food
Colour my life with the chaos of trouble
Cause anything's better than posh isolation
 missed the bus
You were laid on your back
With the boy from the Arab strap
With the boy from the Arab strap
It's something to speak of the way you are feeling
To crowds there assembled
Do you ever feel you have gone too far
Everyone suffers in silence a burden
The man who drives minicabs down in old Compton
The Asian man
With his love hate affair
With his racist clientele
A central location for you is a must
As you stagger about making free with your lewd and lascivious boasts
We know you are soft cause we've all seen you dancing
We know you are hard cause we all saw you drinking from noon
Until noon again
You're the boy with the filthy laugh
You're the boy with the Arab strap
Strapped to the table with suits from the shelter shop
Comic celebrity takes a back seat as the cigarette catches
And sets off the smoke alarm
What do you make of the cool set in London
You're constantly updating your hit parade of your ten biggest wanks
She's a waitress and she's got style
Sunday bath time could take a while <start> Red squirrel in the morning
Red squirrel in the evening
Red squirrel in the morning I'm coming to take you home.

Sun it will rise soon in the
The sun rising dangling there
Golden and fair in the sky. <start> Hope a new beginning
Time time to start living
Like just before we die
There's no going back
To the place we started from
Hurts falling through fingers
Trust trust in the feeling
There's something left inside
There's no going back
To the place we started from
All secrets known
Calm all wounds are healing
Strong truth is worth saving
I want to feel alive
There's no going back
To the place we started from
All secrets known <start> T.V. war is part of life
Entertaining and far far away
What a story and how they fight
Let's gamble and guess who will win
Danger is nowhere
We still got the chance to switch off
Remote control and the guarantee
It's somewhere else
T.V. war  T.V. war
Bloodless but deadly and cruel
T.V. war  T.V. war
We are eating while we're watching
People die on the screen
Toasted and roasted and scrambled and fried
We are greedy and pay
Information  in between
Missiles are in the air
You can hear them and see
They're already here
T.V. war  T.V. war
Bloodless but deadly and cruel
T.V. war  T.V. war
Oh yeah 
According to informed sources
Of the defence ministry
There is now confirmation
That enemy missiles have penetrated our airspace
Impact is estimated in a matter of minutes
Good evening 
T.V. war  T.V. war
Bloodless but deadly and cruel

Stretch tight the lips
A glistening gum line
Mouth curtains pulled I shine
My yellow stage light smile distracting dancing puppets on short saliva strings
So you'll find comfort in a lie
My overbite clenched set in place
Like a stack of polished bright white dinner plates
Hand in my pocket
Straight jacket mind yeah
It's gettin' easy
I wish I had a single thought
The least bit legitimate enough
To open up my mouth and spit accuracy
It's gettin' easy
In this act I'll disguise those dead eyes
Lay flat the tongue
Let the supplement slide down
Everything is fine
And my brain is cloudy leveled out
The pill dissolved it's flushing out
Everything I care about
And not replacing it with anything substantial
So I'm on my hands and knees
Like a martyr callin' out his final plea
The executioner looks exactly like me
It's me
It's gettin' easy
My overbite clenched so tight
Like a stack of dinner plates all polished white
Hands at my side
Straight jacket mind alright
It's gettin' easy
And I wish I had a single thought
The least bit legitimate enough
And I wish I had a single thought
The least bit legitimate enough

And I wish I wasn't on my hands and knees
Like martyr callin' out his final plea
The executioner looks exactly like me
It's me
It's gettin's easy
In this act I'll disguise those dead eyes
Like a stack of dinner plates all polished white
Hands at my side
Straight jacket mind alright
It's gettin' easy. <start> When I heard this crazy stuff about this other guy
I didn't believe it
Had to see it with my eyes
When I saw you and him you passed me by
He's not your friend he's the other guy
Whether it's wrong or whether it's right
Won't take me through the night
Told me that you loved me so
And you'd never let me go
You played the game you're not the same
I never thought you'd ever change
If it's got to be this way
I'm never gonna fall in love
Never gonna fall in live again
Never gonna fall in live again
Never gonna fall in live again
Never gonna fall in live
Never gonna fall in live again
Never gonna fall in live again
Never gonna fall in live again
Never gonna fall in live
I'm never gonna fall 'cause I fell
Lovin' you for me was like hell
How could you play me
Like a champ a tramp a cramp
Girl you did me worse than a food stamp
You told me I could trust ya
If I didn't I would crush ya
But never thought that one day I'd bust you
Walking in the sand hand in hand with
Another man I know your game plan
And now I understand
Love so deep is like sleep
And it will leave you blind
But I see how your living
So baby next time
Watcha gonna do now that the tables are turned around
I'm livin' swell and now you wanna be down
Step off 'cause baby I've learned
If you're messin' with fire you're gonna get burned
You still look dope but a dope I'm not
I can't get with you 'cause you're too hot <start> I saw you walking in the mall
I hate your friends I hate you all
I saw you in that stupid shirt
Throw your face right in the dirt
Chorus
Hot topic
Hot topic
Hot topic  FUCK YOU

You know I love you
My baby ooh
You know I love you
I won't say it's forever
Right now while we're together
You're my baby ooh
You know I love you
My baby ooh
You know I love you
I will be where you want me
I will try to keep you happy
If only you say you're my baby ooh
You know I love you
You're my baby
I do anything for you
I'd run around the world for you
I do what you want me to <start> Oh tragedy
Has taken so many
Love lost cause they all
Forgot who You were
And it scares me to think
That I would choose
My life over You
Oh my selfish heart
Divides me from You
It tears us apart
So tell me
What is our ending
Will it be beautiful
So beautiful
Oh why do I
Let myself let go
Of Hands that painted the stars
And hold tears that fall
And the pride of my heart
Makes me forget
It's not me but You
Who makes the heart beat
I'm lost without You
And dying from me
So tell me
What is our ending
Will it be beautiful
So beautiful
Will my life
Find me by Your side
Your love is beautiful
So beautiful
At the end of it all
I wanna be in Your arms
At the end of it all
I wanna be in Your arms
At the end of it all
I wanna be in Your arms
At the end of it all
I wanna be in Your arms
So tell me
What is our ending
Will it be beautiful
So beautiful
Will my life
Find me by Your side
'Cause Your love is beautiful
So beautiful <start> I traveled to each road and the end of the earth
With no where else to go I looked back in amazement
When I finally realized how farther I had actually gone
I was still standing in the same place that I started
Till I found out and I cried out that there was silence
A definite silence... more brilliant than anything
And there was a bird with feathers brightest red and it spoke
At least that what you saw
I saw an angel on the whitest Novembers morning
And I had sang the sweetest cry since she wanted to reach down
And tell me that it would me all right
And tell me it would be alright
I walked out and stared into the golden sun
I was blinded by an endless timeless beauty
Till i found out and I cried out that there was silence
A definite silence... more brilliant than anything
And there was a bird with feathers brightest red and the smoke
At least that what you saw
I saw an angel on the whitest Novembers morning
And I had sang the sweetest cry since she wanted to reach down
And tell me that it would me all right
And tell me it would be alright <start> Walkin' through the streets just the other day 
Caught up in the traffic I can never get away 
Runnin' here runnin' there
No satisfaction anywhere
I do my work ain't enough anymore
It takes the mornin' after to forget the night before
Too daze gone too daze gone
I'm broke down insufferable my mind is on the blink
It's later than you think and I'm too daze gone
Went to see a friend just the other day 
Had a drink or two and we blew the night away 
Takin' in another show how we live I'll never know
I can't remember the things that we said
Now all I got is this achin' in my head
Too daze gone too daze gone
I'm broke down insufferable my mind is on the blink
It's later than you think and I'm too daze gone
Gone through the games that you want me to play
Gone past the rules that you put in my way
Racin' past your limit ain't no right and wrong
Past the point of carin' too daze goneuh yeah yeah
Couldn't raise my head just to save the day 
I do my penance try to keep the world at bay 
Outta sight outta mind ills you don't expect to find
I learned my lesson a thousand times too
Don't make no impression one thing I can do
Too daze gone
Too daze gone
Too daze gone
Saytoo daze gone
Too daze gone
Too daze gone 
Too daze gone <start> 
Take this
Take everything
Take what I've never had
Take what I left behind
I'm startin' over
I'm leavin' you
for the last god damn time
'Cause I can dance with myself
a little sway of my hips
a little kick to the side
a little solo dip
I can swing by myself
I can swing without you
I can have my cherry pie
and I can eat it too
So give me
What you want to
give me
all that you took from me
'cause I've found somebody else
but
I can still swing it by myself
I said I swing yeah
a swingity ding ity ding
I said I swing yeah
a bee bop a boodly bing
Yeah but
you know that I'm mad
'cause I'm spinnin' all by myself
but I'm not all that bad
and you know
I've got nothin' else
to do with my time
So I think I swing on by....

I said I swing yeah
a swingity ding ity ding
I said I swing yeah
a bee bop a boodly bing <start> Well I'm a born enchanter
That's what the ladies see
Yes I'm a born enchanter
Down in the city of dreams
Lord do right by me
And let me go
Down in my city of dreams
Where I need to go
Well I'm a born enchanter well
Well I'm a born enchanter
Followin' the sabbath cross
Oh I'm a born enchanter
Looking for the faith I lost
Lord do right by me
And let me go
Down in my city of dreams
Where I need to go
Yeah 'cause I'm a born enchanter <start> How the time passed away all the trouble that we gave
And all those days we spent out by the lake
Has it all gone to waste All the promises we made
One by one they vanish just the same
Of all the things I still remember
Summer's never looked the same
The years go by and time just seems to fly
But the memories remain
In the middle of September we'd still play out in the rain
Nothing to lose but everything to gain
Reflecting now on how things could've been
It was worth it in the end
Now it all seems so clear there's nothing left to fear
So we made our way by finding what was real
Now the days are so long that summer's moving on
We reach for something that's already gone yeah
Of all the things I still remember
Summer's never looked the same
The years go by and time just seems to fly
But the memories remain
In the middle of September we'd still play out in the rain
Nothing to lose but everything to gain
Reflecting now on how things could've been
It was worth it in the end
We knew we had to leave this town
But we never knew when and we never knew how
We would end up here the way we are
Yeah we knew we had to leave this town
But we never knew when and we never knew how
Of all the things I still remember
Summer's never looked the same
The years go by and time just seems to fly
But the memories remain
In the middle of September we'd still play out in the rain
Nothing to lose but everything to gain
Reflecting now on how things could've been
It was worth it in the end <start> Jesus babe
Can't you hear me crying
Ain't it enough
Alone in the night
And it don't matter what you've done
I just want my life back
For a while
Is it too much to ask
The bookmarks page sittin' out in the room
And altars of candles casting shadows on you
You see the bed in the dark
Well I could just sleep
I could just sleep
And hear me babe
When I don't wanna say it
Seein' through
I'm back home and stayin'
I can't be alone anymore
And I don't blame you
Or pretend to know
The right thing to do
Late afternoon and the knocks on the door
A fist through the wall
Wipe the blood off the floor
And I can see in the dark
Even still
I can see in the dark
Even still
Well I waited for you
All the thoughts twist around
The visions of you get lost
In the clouds
What now
Jesus babe
Can't you hear me crying
Ain't that enough
Alone in the night
I don't care what you've done
I just want my life back for now
Late afternoon and the locks on the door
A ship through the fog
Sweep the mess from the floor
I can see the bed in the dark
But I could just leave
I could just leave oh <start> Tell me tell me why
The snow is white
But I can't wash it all away
You left last spring
You went to find something
You could see but could never speak
West winds will wash you away
Love will lift you off the ground don't be afraid
Grace will fly you home again
My heart's crying for change
For the road to bend to be home again
And grace is where I end and you begin
My love my friend
It's a beautiful night
My eyes have seen no light
The sunset was the last thing on my mind
I feel your hands
You shake my face
And tell me it's okay to believe
West winds will wash you away
Love will lift you off the ground don't be afraid
Grace will fly you home again
My heart's crying for change
For the road to bend to be home again
And grace is where I end and you begin
My love my friend
Grace it's all around you
The sky is white
I'm ready to be baptized
You're all around me yeah
All around me
Yeah

Yeah
Grace will fly you home again
Where you're standing in the doorway
Singing songs to my old poetry
Grace will fly you home again
My heart's crying for a change
For this pain to end to be home again
And grace is where I end and you begin
That's why I feel your heart and I know
That you can be my way
And I'll say my love <start> Chorus
No where to turn nowhere to hide
Hit and run Blindside
Fight Hard to let is subside
No innocence inside
The pain from the past has never been kind
Memories Defied
Never forget shadows left behind
Verse 
I tire of this masquerade
These memories are haunting
Why's it so hard to just let go
Just let go
Chorus
Isn't easier to live this way
The faces are taunting
Why's it so hard to just let go
Why's it so hard to just let go
Let Go
Let Go
Is it time to leave these scars
Is it time to leave these scars
Just leave them behind
Just leave them behind
I tire of this masquerade
These memories are haunting
Why's it so hard to just let go
Why's it so hard to just let go
Let go
Let go <start> Ich bin dagegen
Denn Ihr seid dafr
Ich bin dagegen
Ich bin nicht so wie ihr
Ich bin dagegen
Egal worum es geht
Ich bin dagegen
Weil ihr nichts davon versteht
Ich bin dagegen
Ich sag es noch einmal
Ich bin dagegen
Warum ist doch egal
Ich bin dagegen
Auch wenn es euch nicht schmeckt
Ich nenn es Freiheit
Ihr nennt es Mangel es Respekt
Bitte versteht mein Verhalten
Als Zeichen der Ablehnung mit der ich euch gegenberstehe
Bitte versteht mein Verhalten
Als Zeichen der Ablehnung mit der ich euch gegenberstehen tu
Ich bin nicht blde
Auch wenn du gern so tust
Ich bin nicht faul
Ich hab nur einfach keine Lust
Ich bin nicht hlich
Ich seh nur anders aus als du
Du hast verloren
Du gibts es nur nicht zu
Ich bin nicht taub
Du brauchst nicht so zu schreien
Ich bin nicht blind
Ich seh es nur nicht ein
Ich bin nicht stumm
Ich halte nur den Mund
Was soll ich sagen
Ich hab doch keinen Grund
Bitte versteht mein Verhalten
Als Zeichen der Ablehnung mit der ich euch gegenberstehe
Bitte versteht mein Verhalten
Als Zeichen der Ablehnung mit der ich euch gegenberstehe
Wenn ihr schon dabeiseid dann betrachtet auch mein Aussehen
als Symbol der Nichtidentifikation mit euch Gefhrten.
Keiner  Keiner  Keiner  hat das
Recht mir zu befehlen was ich zu tun hab 
wirklich niemand  einfach keiner 
das ist ganz allein meine freie Entscheidung
Ich bin nicht arm
Ich hab was mir gefllt
Ich bin nicht neidisch
auf dich oder dein Geld
Herzlich willkommen
in meinem Lebenslauf
Ich bin ganz ruhig
Warum regst du dich denn so auf
Wenn du dann durchdrehst
Und mich wieder verhaust
Stellst du dir selber
Ein Armutszeugnis aus
Du kannst mir leidtun
Die Wut sie macht dich blind
Du hast verloren
Ich bin nicht mehr dein Kind
Keiner  Keiner  Keiner  hat das
Recht mir zu befehlen was ich zu tun hab 
wirklich niemand  einfach keiner 
das ist ganz allein meine freie Entscheidung 
so wie Meinung 
oder Kleidung 
und die innere und uere Erscheinung  <start>

So I lay down my life and worship You and worship You
Lord I worship You I worship You <start> Don't give up on me tonight
We've come this far
We've made good time
And all the light of the world is somewhere else
The morning light the faded stars
The more I make it better
And everyday I find I'm someone else
Everyday I get closer to myself
You can ride it for forever
The more I find I don't know
Go as far as you can see
But don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
You can drive it to wherever
Do whatever makes you free
Don't give up on me
But don't give up on me
Got around and shot of course
And what I found was here before
And all the time was time that I just spent
And everyday I get closer to myself
And the more I make it better
You can ride it for forever
Go as far as you can see
The more I find I don't know
But don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
You can drive it to wherever
Don't give up on me
Do whatever makes you free
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
You can drive it to wherever
Go as far as you can see
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
You can ride it to wherever
Do whatever makes you free
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me <start> Look around the country an abundance you'll find of
Mediocre minds
Sift trough the fodder as the sane justice declines because of
Mediocre minds
Shrouded under cover the most flamboyant guise hides a
Mediocre mind
You got yours but you can never bend mine with your
Mediocre minds
When the cry foul you had better watch out because you never know which
aptitude they're griping about
Don't act too smart for their stenoscopic ways
You'll be discarded away
Reason's not to be what the privileged define with their
Mediocre minds
So many sighted people act so helplessly
Blind from their
Mediocre minds
If you want attention then you will be asked to bend but the surest
insurrection is enlightenment
Then you can live outside inharmoniously
An enemy
They want to keep me locked away
'cause I'm an overactive brain
Leaders presidents and the nightly news guys cater to
Mediocre minds
Reason's not to be what the privileged define with their
Mediocre minds
You got yours but you can never bend mine with your
Mediocre minds
The only natural thing that I despise are
Mediocre minds <start> Tiny speakers are mounted into the ceiling
Barely visible next to the greywhite tiles
Dripping wet with the syrup sweet production
Hollow words for the empty in steaming piles
You'll find the truth down in the basement
Hiding out beneath the pavement
Just beneath the reach of agendas only seen in green
The vision is underground
The culture is out of bounds
It's still a persuasive sound
The music is still around but its underground
Choreography never replaced conviction.
Smoke and lighting cannot manufacture style
Propaganda can make truth sound like fiction
Greater numbers diluted are not worthwhile
Down below in the resistance
Sheer defiance builds in cadence
Pure and passionate that's right
There's nothing here to lose
Real change doesn't come a mandate
Real love you cannot legislate. <start> When you say it's dead and gone
I know you're wrong
Cut and slash sharpest knife
It won't die no
Poison cup drank it up
It won't die no
No fire no gun no rope no stone
It won't die oh
Why you gotta shove it in my face
As if you put me in my place
'Cause I don't care
If you or me is wrong or right
Ain't gonna spend another night
In your bed
In your bed
Laws of man are just pretend
They ain't mine
Love so good love so bad
It won't die
Some talk too long they know it all
I just smile and move on
Words ain't free like you and me
I don't mind
Why'd you have to be so mean and cruel
The dogs are loose i'm on to you
You ball and...
Chained together from the dawn to dusk
Can't call it leavin cause it's just <start> They say that every thing you do
Turns out all wrong
That you're bound to lose
And you love me too much
Take me along
Ah baby don't ever try to close a rose
After it blooms to the tuned
Of a spring time day
It won't work any way
'Cos once it knows the sun it grows
And keeps on growing
Knowing it must say goodbye
To the field and the sky
So don't you worry about me
You could never make me unhappy
Cause we both have been touched
By the spring time sun
We already won
As long as you want me
I'll be right there
But with a life time of hard times
We gotta love
Babe we can share
Ah baby don't ever try to close a rose
After it blooms to the tuned
Of a spring time day
It won't work any way
'Cos once it knows the sun it grows
And keeps on growing
Knowing it must say goodbye
To the field and the sky <start> So long oh how I hate to see you go
So long oh how I hate to see you go
And the way that I will miss you
I guess you will never know
We've been together so long to have to separate this way
We've been together so long to have to separate this way
I'm gonna let you go ahead on baby
Pray that you'll come back home some day
You said you once had loved me
But now I guess you have changed your mind
You said you once had loved me
But now I guess you have changed your mind
Why don't you reconsider baby
Give yourself just a little more time <start> my world is on fire
my life's overwhelming
just breathe
you're on the next train to life without me
time had nothing left to show
so we found out a world on fire
a life overwhelming
do you believe the words you said to me
as you take away everything
well i can't believe what you're saying
so don't tell me.
the words that kill the words that kill
you're leaving
i spend my time thinking about you
remember when we said that this would not end
and now you're gone
i'm still right here without you.
a world on fire
a life overwhelming
just breathe
so do you believe in the words you said to me
as you take away everything
well i can't believe what you're saying
so don't tell me
the words that kill the words that kill
you're leaving
so take back what you said
that would never end.
the words that kill the words that kill

the words that kill the words that kill

take back what you said

the words that kill the words that kill
you're leaving me <start> Flowers I sent
Were found dead on their arrival
The words I said
Inserted foot in my mouthful
So when we dance
My lead it ain't so graceful

I'm a hapless romantic
Stttuttering ppoet
Just call me a tragic comic
Cause I'm in in love with you
And when we dine
I forget to push in your seat
I wear the wine
Spilling hearts all over my sleeve
A stitch in time
Proposing down on my knees

I'm a hapless romantic
Stttuttering ppoet
Just call me a tragic comic
Cause I'm in in love with you <start> I'm looking for a friend to hold the door
It's cold outside when you don't know where to find
A sheltered place secluded from the race
Of this old life
When I walked out in the down pour with no raincoat
I was soaked down to the bone from head to toe
Without my raincoat anywhere I may go
I get wet somehow
I found that friend and he's with me till the end
He's promised me that he won't forsake his own
And when a promise never ends
It can only mean one thing it's from above
When I walk out in the down pour with my raincoat
After all is said and done he's still the One
With my raincoat anywhere I may go I know I'm all right
And when I walk out in the down pour with my raincoat
And after all is said and done he's still the One
With my raincoat anywhere I may go I know I'm all right
Now I walk out in the down pour here is my rainncoat <start> I wanna live fast
Love hard
Die young
And leave a beautiful memory
I wanna live fast
Love hard
Die young
And leave a beautiful memory
Don't want slow walkin'
Or sad singin'
Let 'em have a jubilee
I wanna leave a lot of happy women
A thinking pretty thoughts of me
I wanna live fast
Love hard
Die young
And leave a beautiful memory
I got a hotrod car
And a cowboy suit
And I really do get around
I got a little black book
And the gals look cute
And I know the name of
Every spot in town
I wanna find 'em
Fool 'em
Leave 'em
And let 'em do the same to me
I wanna live fast
Love hard
Die young
And leave a beautiful memory
I wanna live fast
Love hard
Die young
And leave a beautiful memory
I'm a wampus cat
Let me grab my hat
And baby come along with me
We're gonna do some fancy stepping
We're really goin' on a spree
I wanna live fast
Love hard
Die young
And leave a beautiful memory
Now you may not approve
Of the things I do
But it really don't bother me
But don't ever think you can tie me down
I'm gonna stay footloose and
Fancy free
So jump back
Make tracks
Move out
And let the pretty gals at me
I wanna live fast l
Love hard
Die young
And leave a beautiful memory <start> Well it's been more than a year
Since I lived by the sea
And though we both have been moving
You came back to me
And I remember the old signs
We threw off the pier
They've been burning forgotten
Their scent disappear
Take one day of my lifestyle
Passing ghosts in a street
I chase them away with alcohol
But they don't get drunk
The ghosts around your city
Have all got my name <start> Now Alexander the Great
He was a big man across the land
He conquered everything in sight
He had the world at his command
But somewhere deep down inside
He felt there were things he still didn't know
So he asked the wise men if they knew
If there was some place he could go
They said that in a far off land
Lived a man named Diogenes
Who possessed the kind of knowledge
That could put his mind at ease
Then stepping up he said I'm here
Please tell me what it is I crave
And the voice came back loud and clear
From the darkness of the cave
And said hey you're standing in my light
I said hey you're standing in my light
You know that ain't right
Hey you're standing in my light
Hey you you're standing in my light
Now I don't know what you think I know
But I'm sure it's gonna be fine
And remember that whatever's been written
Is just the opinion of one man's mind
There are no easy answers
That I know that'll satisfy you
You just gotta take your chances
And do what you wanna do
Don't you know that in this world
You get what you deserve
So when your back's against the wall
You better not lose your nerve
And now you're standing on the street
Like you got something to prove
And the pavement artist at your feet
Looks up every time you move
And says hey you're standing in my light
I said hey you're standing in my light
You know that ain't right
I said hey you're standing in my light
Hey you you're standing in my light
Now get out of my light
So when you're headed for that goddess center
And the dream that lies within it
Just remember what the man said
There's one born every minute
I said hey you're standing in my light
I said hey you're standing in my light
Now that ain't right
Hey you're standing in my light
Hey you you're standing in my light
Now get out of my light
Hey you're standing in my light
I said hey you're standing in my light no no
Hey <start> Many things have changed
But your absence changed it all
Many things are strange
You're the strangest of them all
I count the times it's rained
In the summer before the fall
Like nothing before felt the world was cruel
Had a feeling inside
Hurt me you hurt me
Bring me down
Bring me down
When I try
You bring me
Many things have changed
But your answer don't change at all
Your excuses lame
Your story's were tall
I count the wasted years
And the cracks in the wall
Like nothing before felt the world was cruel
Had a feeling inside
Hurt me you hurt me
Bring me down
Bring me down
When I try
You bring me
The times we cried
Those wasted years we lied
The times that we tried
You bring me down you bring me down
Things change
Bring me down
Bring me down
When I try
You bring me <start> Turn around for something better.
Children give up don't you ever.
Remember that the devil's clever.
Brother John where are you sleeping
Take the light into your room.
Cast a candle on your doom.
Your master his is coming home soon.
Brother John how are you sleeping
May your awakening be near
Heaven could be any place Why not here
Brother John why are you sleeping <start> Brother can you hear me
Your life is in my hands
I will not surrender never yield to his demands
If we stand together we will never fall
Brother we're the answer to your call
Brother can you hear me
You must not be afraid
I will march beside you
Have no fear
Be strong
Be brave
We sing this song for freedom
Our voices will resound
Brother we will never let you down
On the road to revolution
We're bound to make mistakes
There's a price that we must pay
For every choice we make
Freedom is the reason
To stand up or give in
But someone has to lose
And someone has to win
Brother can you hear me
I am not afraid
I will not forsake you
I'll be strong and I'll be brave
I sing the song for freedom
My courage knows no bounds
Brother know I stand on solid ground
Brother I will never let you down
Never let you down <start> It started out
With some loud shouts
As we ran around and around
I saw you there
With your long blond hair
I would have never guessed I'd meet you here
If dreams come true
I'll come talk to you
When I'm up here it all becomes so clear
You look so cute
Doing that move you do
I can't believe I'm finally here
Our eyes they lock
As the band rocks
Should I try my luck with you
They play our song
So we sing along
It's now or never so I better make a move
If dreams come true
I'll come talk to you
When I'm up here it all becomes so clear
You look so cute
Doing that move you do
I can't believe I'm finally here
I came back down
I walked my way around
Through the crowd that kept us apart
Are you with him
Or is he just a friend
I need to know so please don't break my heart
If dreams come true
I'll come talk to you
When I'm up here it all becomes so clear
You look so cute
Doing that move you do
I can't believe I'm finally here
I can't believe I'm finally here
I can't believe I'm finally here
I can't believe I'm finally here <start> Stone was in me
When I was rougher
Now my power has suffered
In this hour of my oversleep
Alone with the beast
And my skull choppers
Now I'm just a name dropper
And I'm bust in these deep slumber weeds
Stone was in me
It's so damn late
It's so damn dark
Pull up those drapes
Hey let's see just where we are
I finally woke up that's right
'Cause I've got to do something worthwhile
I sent some smoke up that's right
'Cause I've got to make something work out
It's so damn late
It's so damn dark
Pull up those drapes
Hey let's see just where we are
I finally woke up that's right
'Cause I've got to do something worthwhile
I sent some smoke up that's right
'Cause I've got to make something work out
I sent some smoke up that's right
'Cause I've got to make something work out
That's right I've got to make something work out
That's right I've got to make something work out <start> Dear precious I write you.
It's been a long time please spare me this emotional excess
This won't hurt a bit just the sting of a pin prick
And out cold with your mouth shut you look so beautiful
When you wake up I'll be gone
And this will be the last song
Now Who's laughing now
When the fire in your heart burns out
That doesn't mean I'm laughing now
Grieving the little things about you
I always thought they'd get me too but I could never let go
And out cold with your mouth shut you look so beautiful
And when you wake up I'll be gone and this will be the last song
Here's your only parting gift Just five words you wouldn't miss
Baby cause it's over now
I want you like a bad disease. You hold me like a trophy
Baby cause it's over now
Words that never meant a thing
Importance lied in being scene Baby Cause it's over now
Appreciating what you got I can't be something that I'm not
Baby cause it's over now <start> We're only making plans for Nigel
We only want what's best for him
We're only making plans for Nigel
Nigel just needs this helping hand
And if young Nigel says he's happy
He must be happy
He must be happy in his work
We're only making plans for Nigel
He has his future in a British steel
We're only making plans for Nigel
Nigel's whole future is as good as sealed
And if young Nigel says he's happy
He must be happy
He must be happy in his work
Nigel is not outspoken
But he likes to speak
And loves to be spoken to
Nigel is happy in his work
We're only making plans for Nigel <start> I can remember them
Blue as the ocean
Whenever I drew nigh
Blue as a stormy sky
Ever so sisterly
I would advise her
Looking into her eyes
Doomed as a falling star
Refrain
L  c my dear lucia
Why can't you see me
L santa lucia is what they'll call thee
L  c eyes once gazed lovingly
So veiled in purity
Santa lucia santa lucia
All your sisters have wed
Just as expected
As the most beautiful
You've been selected
L  c that's when our father said
lucy must marry
She said i'd rather die
And then she scared me
Refrain
L and like the waters 
Of pure devotion 
She'd rather love god
With all emotion
Jesus he is the lord 
Why can't you see it
And so she plucked her eyes
Out in his spirit.
Refrain <start>

 <start> A lie to say O my mountain has coal veins and beds to dig
 men with axes and they all dig for me
A lie to say O my river where many fish do swim
Half of the catch is mine when you haul your nets in
Oh no never will he believe that
His greed has a blinding ray
No devil or redeemer will cheat him
He'll take his gold to where he's lying cold
A lie to say O my mine gave a diamond big as a fist
But with every gem in his pocket the jewels he has missed
A lie to say O my garden is growing taller by the day
He only eats the best and tosses the rest away
Oh no never will he believe that
His greed has a blinding ray
No devil or redeemer can cheat him
He'll take his gold where he's lying cold
Six deep in the grave

Something is out of reach
Something he wanted


Something is out of reach
He's being taunted

Something is out of reach

That he can't beg or steal

A lie to say O my forest has trees that block the sun
And when I cut them down I don't answer to anyone
No no no never will he believe that
His greed has a blinding ray
No devil or redeemer can cheat him
Take his gold where he's lying cold
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
Oh la la la la la la la la la la
A lonely lonely lonely lonely man <start> Lord knows we've become scientific
It's nothing special at all
Sometimes everything gets big
And nothing is small
We can live here everyday
We can be here whenever we play
And the knife is near at hand
I cut myself to see who I am
Reach inside but I still can't touch
The policeman inside
Baby Jesus Holy Moses
He can stop on a dime
I guess there's just too many supposes
For me to put out that fire
Skin so soft feels so light
Guess I'll stay home tonight
From the Rockies to the Rio Grande
A big ol' shadow falls across the land
Had some money but it's not enough
To keep me in line
We made love in a shower of stars
I had a vision in my backyard
Saw a car drive across the sky
Behind the wheel look there it's you and I
Looks like we're gonna get outa ourselves tonight
Looks like
What do you suppose
Was it nothing at all
What do you suppose
Was it nothing at all
Those good times good times good times we had
Were they nothing at all
Did I sleep a little too late
Or am I awake
Shake your body till the fear is gone
Like it was nothing at all
It's so easy so easy so easy
Hey it's nothing at all
So easy so easy so easy
Hey it's nothing at all <start> I wasn't perfect
I done a lot of stupid things
Still no angel
I wasn't looking for forgiveness
I wasn't laid up by my pride
Just shocked by her attention
Did someone sign me up for love
I didn't want it
But now I can't live without it
She changed my life
She cleaned me up
She found my heart
Like only a woman can
She pulls me up
When she knows I'm sad
She knows her man
Like only a woman can
She's kinda perfect
She's kinda everything I'm not
Yes she's an angel
It's amazing how she's patient
Even more at times I'm not
She's my conscience
But who decided I'd be hers
I want to hate them
Cause now I can't live without her
She changed my life
She cleaned me up
She found my heart
Like only a woman can
She pulls me up
When she knows I'm sad
She knows her man
Like only a woman can
Like only a woman can
But who decided I'd be hers
I want to hate them
Cause now I can't live without her
She changed my life
She cleaned me up
She found my heart
Like only a woman can
She pulls me up
When she knows I'm sad
She knows her man
Like only a woman can <start> Hey Kitten whatcha doin'
Wanna play the guitar
You say what's that sound
Coming out of the hole in the wood
You say what's that sound
Coming out of the hole in the wood
You say what's that sound
Coming out of the hole in the wood
It's the guitar
Hey baby whatcha doin'
Playin' with your rattle and plastic car
You say what's that sound
Coming out of the hole in the wood
You say what's that sound
Coming out of the hole in the wood
You say what's that sound
Coming out of the hole in the wood
It's the guitar
Hey mama where ya goin'
I hope you're not going very far
Because what's that sound
Coming out of the hole in the wood
Tell me what's that sound
Coming out of the hole in the wood
Hey what's that sound
Coming out of the hole in the wood
It's the guitar

It's the guitar <start> Pedaling on a bicycle
I'm on my way to make a call
I've tried to touch you
Through the double glazing
But the curtains were drawn  the family out the away
You used to know but now you don't 
Those words
are dangerous
the kind of things you don't see
Given sight
and the ways of life
sometimes you see what can it be
A normal heart
could find it hard
not to forgive what it could be
Here' singer
Here's singer
Here's singer
Here's singer
Heres singer <start> A fatal incision cuts apart
Inject the living don't you breath too hard
No lines to rehearse no spell no curse
It's all or nothing to take til tomorrow
Before you take it in under your heavy hand
Before you get pinned for nothing
A light goes farther away go away
Take this body to study and know its name
A timeless face will haunt you
Don't you worry it's just for a lifetime
Before you take it in under your heavy hand
Bofore you get pinned for nothing
Look around <start> In  I came to this planet
Ascoltavo ieri sera un cantante uno dei tanti
e avevo gli occhi gonfi di stupore nel sentire
Il cielo azzurro appare limpido e regale
.
Strani giorni viviamo strani giorni.
Cantava sento rumori di swing provenire dal
neolitico dall'Olocene.
Sento il suono di un violino e mi circondano
l'alba e il mattino.
Chi sa com'erano allora il Rio delle Amazzoni
ed Alessandria la grande e le preghiere e
l'amore Chi sa com'era il colore
Mi lambivano suoni che coprirono rabbie
e vendette di uomini con clave.
Ma anche battaglie e massacri di uomini civili.
L'uomo neozoico dell'era quaternaria.
Strani giorni viviamo strani giorni.
Nella voce di un cantante
si rispecchia il sole
ogni amata ogni amante.
Strani giorni viviamo strani giorni. <start> finally i see your plan and now i've come to understand.
you should have told me all the lies were true.
and that was all so long ago maybe about a week or so.
if the one you're holding only knew.
fall back start over let all the negativity subside.
bad night hung over and everything you said hanging on me.
hanging on me.
i can't replace the thought of you sitting there just like you do
and now you're sitting close with someone else.
i figured out some time ago regardless of the things i know i'm over it as far as i can tell.
fall back start over let all the negativity subside.
bad night hung over and everything you said hanging on me.
had your chance your time has passed this time i'm not so blinded <start> There are days I might not make it
There are days I might start brakin'
When the rain starts coming down as heavy as the air
You can find me dancing with the spear
It's in the square god damn I swear
There are times I feel like givin' in
There are times I begin to begin again
Look outside the world keeps spinning like a paddle wheel
Rolling for the broken hearted waiting on the heel
You know I'm not in the clear
You are not in the clear
Don't you go count me out now dear
You know I'm not in the clear
You are not in the clear
Don't you go count me out now dear
In the clear
There are places I don't remember
There are faces I don't remember
How could I forget you painted stars into the sky
Coming like a reaper marching in the second life
You know I'm not in the clear
You are not in the clear
Don't you go count me out now dear
You know I'm not in the clear
You are not in the clear
Don't you go count me out now dear
In the clear
And if I should drown
May this be the sound
To wash me out
You know I'm not in the clear
You are not in the clear
Don't you go count me out now dear
You know I'm not in the clear
You are not in the clear
Don't you go count me out now dear
In the clear <start> Currents that are stronger
Want to drag you under
I would never tire
Swimming next to you
We became united
Twisted and enlightened
Skating on fire
Yes you know it's true
She took off her tshirt
Like a worm I'd eat dirt
Just to be beside her
Every single night
Golf ball hail and thunder
Rum and Stevie Wonder
Warmer than fire
Getting into you
These memories
Dear God I hope she's always next to me
Picking and then peaking
With the Costa Ricans.
Lying on a surfboard
Four weeks of the year
She was in her cycle
Crashed her motorcycle
Broken toes in plaster
Stitches in her arm
These memories
Dear God I hope she's always next to me
When we're deceased
Dear God I hope she's always next to me
These memories
Dear God I hope she's always next to me
When we're deceased
Dear God I hope she's buried next to me
Dear God I hope she's buried next to me
Dear God I hope she's buried next to me <start> It's like you're trying to get to heaven in a hurry
And the queue was shorter than you thought it would be
And the doorman says
You need to get a wristband.
You got a lift between the pitfalls
But you're looking like your low on energy
Did you get out and walk
To ensure you'd miss the quicksand
Looking for a new place to begin
Feeling like it's hard to understand
But as long as you still keep peppering the pill
You'll find a way to spit it out again.
And even when you know the way it's gonna blow
It's hard to get around the wind.
Stretching out the neck on your evening
Trying to even out some deficits
But it's sabertooth multiball confusion.
And you can shriek until you're hollow
Or whisper it the other way
Trying to save the youth without putting your shoes on.
Looking for a new place to begin
Feeling like it's hard to understand
But as long as you still keep peppering the pill
You'll find a way to spit it out again.
And even when you know the way it's gonna blow
It's hard to get around the wind.
I can hear you through my window
But I'm never quite sure who is who
But they want the world on a dessert spoon.
It always sounds like they're fighting
Or if that's what they are about to do
It might not hurt now but it's gonna hurt soon. <start> One man in a spotlight
One man with a song
When it came to love he showed us how
Was there ever a time he wasn't there
'til now the voice maybe gone
But the song goes on <start> how could this be right a half a dozen times i asked myself the same. it's nothing you can fight unless you want to live regretting everyday. so raise your glass up to the sky. a thousand cheers is due to say goodbye. but no matter how far from you i am. just know i'll be coming home again. dusk fades out the light. where the hell did three years disappear off to why did i get left that night after that there wasn't much that we could do. just sit back and enjoy the ride. the ups and downs we'll all just take in stride. no matter where i am you're on my mind. and you know i'll be coming home again. tonight. <start> They all have gone.
I sing in streets of silence.
She now is old
I haven't aged a day.
Dress the day.
Wearing time
Oh so fitting.
Dress the day.
Wearing time
Oh so fitting.
The air so cold.
With whirling wind of color
She now is gone
And I am here to stay.
Dress the day.
Wearing time
Oh so fitting.
Dress the day.
Wearing time
What's a day
What's an hour
In my capsule floating bleak
You peak
You fall.
Dress the day.
Wearing time.
Dress the day.
Wearing time
Standing in the street so cold
Your godliness is growing old.
If only I was beautiful
Like you.
Dress the day. <start> Can you be the one
To help me understand myself
The one and only one
Is it you and no one else
Can you shoot the veins
That others only dream about
Can you light the fire
When all my flames are dying out
Can you be the one
Can you be the one
Can you be the one
Can you be the one
Tell me about my life
Tell me about my world
Tell me about your life
Tell me about your world
 the crowd
Aim above and out beyond
Leave the common ground
You never wanted to belong
The sky is open wide
Light the fuse and take a ride
Leave it all behind
Dig in deep and push aside
You know you're the one
You know you're the one
You know you're the one
You know you're the one
Tell me about my life
Tell me about my world
Tell me about your life
Tell me about your world
Shoot them down
They want to drag you down
Got to see
They're your enemies
Shoot them down
They want to drag you down
Got to see
They're your enemies
Listen you can't even see
What this world has done to me
Done to me
Done to me
Can you be the one
To help me understand myself
The one and only one
Is it you and no one else
Can you shoot the veins
That others only dream about
Can you light the fire
When all my flames are dying out
Can you be the one
Can you be the one
Can you be the one
Can you be the one
Tell me about my life
Tell me about my world
Tell me about your life
Tell me about your world
Tell me about my life
Tell me about my world
Tell me about your life
Tell me about your world
Tell me about my world
Tell me about my world
Tell me about my world <start> It was just a matter of time
Before you needed me
It had to happen sooner or later
You'd get in too deep
You don't have to worry
You don't have to worry at all
And if you should stumble
I'll be there for you after the fall
Just remember to hold on tight
I know it's your life in my hands
Reach out for the one you trust
You've got to be strong
And keep holding on to the lifeline
Take my hand and don't let go again
I'll be around I won't let you down
On that you can depend
Time and tide won't keep me
Won't keep me away from your side
If I am needed I'll be there for you
Day or night
Just remember to hold on tight
You know it's my heart in your hands
Reach out for the one you trust
You've got to be strong
And keep holding on to the lifeline
Keep holding on <start> Crazy Janey and her mission man
Were back in the alley tradin' hands
'Long came Wild Billy with his friend GMan
All duded up for Saturday night
Well Billy slammed on his coaster brakes
And said Anybody want to go on up to Greasy Lake
It's about a mile down on the dark side of Route 
I got a bottle of ros so let's try it
We'll pick up Hazy Davy and Killer Joe
And I'll take you all out to where the gypsy angels go
They're build like light
And they dance like spirits in the night  in the night 
Oh you don't know what they can do to you
Spirits in the night  in the night 
Stand up right now and let them shoot through you
Well now Wild Billy was a crazy cat
And he shook some dust out of his coonskin cap
He said Trust some of this it'll show you where you're at
Or at least it'll help you really feel it
By the time we made it up to Greasy Lake
I had my head out the window and Janey's fingers were in the cake
I think I really dug her 'cause I was too loose to fake
I said I'm hurt she said honey let me heal it
And we danced all night to a soul fairy band
And she kissed me just right like only a lonely angel can
She felt so nice
Just as soft as a spirit in the night  in the night 
Janey don't know what she do to you
Spirit in the night  in the night 
Stand right up and let her shoot through me
Now the night was bright and the stars threw light
On Billy and Davy dancin' in the moonlight
They were down near the water in a stone mud fight
Killer Joe gone passed out on the lawn
Well now Hazy Davy got really hurt
He ran into the lake in just his socks and his shirt
Me and Crazy Janey was makin' love in the dirt
Singin' our birthday songs
Janey said it was time to go
So we closed our eyes and said goodbye to Gypsy Angel Row
Felt so right
Together we moved like spirits in the night  in the night 
Oh you don't know what they can do to you
Spirit in the night  all night 
Oh stand right up and let her shoot through you
Like a spirit in the night  all night 
All night  all night  all night  all night 
All night
All night <start> Isn't often that I stand up to a challenge
But today I feel I'm fighting for my soul
They give me a quite plate
But how much will I leave to waste
Doesn't matter if I wake up and I can't breathe
This one's for the world
Next one's for the friend
Waiting for the drug
That meets you at the end
But I don't wanna end up like Seymour
Whoa
It isn't often that I try to climb this mountain
But today I find I'm half way to the top
It's a bit shaky here but don't get all worried up now dear
I got a feeling if I fell right now I'd roll right into heaven
It's been hiding under hell for way too long
Where I can dream until I fell further away for this one
Whoa
Cause that's how we say Goodbye I hate you I'm sickened please don't die
Way too many times
We said goodbye I hate you I'm sickened please don't die
Way too many times
Way too many times <start> Blank pages begging to be filled
Only a story or words can reveal
My chest it pains with repercussions of thoughts
How can I deny myself experience
How can I leave this place thats carried me on
Stay lead a life of fear
Oh play make use of these tears
Daring I never meant to make this sacrifice
But I know that youll be waiting after dark
So Im gonna Play On
Play on
Away from home its never the same
Day to day its all a game
Simply put I get so damn tired of hearing hey little girl look what I do for you
you could rock my would its true Im working for you
Now stay lead a life of fear
Oh play make use of these tears
Daring I never meant to make this sacrifice
But I know that youll be waiting after dark
So Im gonna Play On
In the end when my lines are cold and tired
And these years well theyve marched across the tired eyes
No longer The Chile well Ill pull back into the drive where my heart lies
Stay lead a life of fear
Oh play make use of these tears
Oh stay lead a life of fear
Oh play make use of these tears
Daring I never meant to make this sacrifice
But I know that youll be waiting after dark
Stay yeah
Stay yeah
Stay yeah
Stay yeah
I said stay
Oh Im going to make use of these tears
Daring I never meant to make this sacrifice
But I know that youll be waiting after dark
So Im gonna Play On <start> Oh yeah
High tail in your face
Black hole rockin' the place
Hong Kong videos
Big bang mad to blow
Into cyberspace
Look out I'm gonna race
Eight ball in the pack
Big bone jukebox jack
Hot star burnin' it up
Full moon runnin' amok
Into cyberspace
Look out I'm gonna race
Blow you into cyberspace
Blow you all into cyberspace
Gotta get out get out of this place
Blow a big hole into cyberspace
Octane down the track
Flat chat smash the mach
Blow out burnin' hot
Mile high take you right to the top
Into cyberspace
Look out I'm gonna race
Blow you into cyberspace
Blow you all into cyberspace <start> Come on in my weary friend
The welcome here is endless
These fears of yours like painted whores
They will not stay the night
If all your life you've done what's right
Don't say you felt obliged
Come on along is your timid tongue
Too shy to tell your story
This pain in you so far removed
From anything you've known
So I won't condone another moan
When everything is fine
So when in drought learn to dance
And pray the dead would return
Dream smoke without fire
Just come see me again when it burns
Somewhere along the way
Well I was led astray
By a wolf in no one's clothing
It was a brilliant disguise
And I forgot that life existed
I thought it was just some kind of game
That's what brings me to your doorstep
Though I don't know why I came today
Standing still in the dust
Giving up on the rain
As with smoke without fire
I've already laid in the flames
I've already laid in the flames
Brother be afraid of the flames <start> You're only halfway
Through your working day
I'm sorry honey
But we both need your pay
I'm sorry about everything I've put you through
I'm sorry about getting by on making do
Every day is just like starting over
We try so hard but we keep on falling over
Every day is just like starting over
We try so hard but we keep on falling over
Every day is just like starting over
We try so hard but we keep on falling over
You're worried and I have my doubts
But I'm drunk when I text
So I send 'post soothing out'
I just had a nasty flashback
We both used our cards for cash back
Hard way to explain
Why my pockets are full of change
Every day is just like starting over
We try so hard but we keep on falling over
Every day is just like starting over
We try so hard but we keep on falling over
Every day is just like starting over
We try so hard but we keep on falling over
River deep and mountain high
There's some lyrics that'll never apply
'Cause I don't lie awake at night
With thoughts of river depth or mountain height
Don't care what your parents say
It won't always be this way I
Don't care what your parents say
It won't always be this way I
Don't care what your parents say
It won't always be this way you're
Only halfway through your working day
I've met your parents
And I know it sounds rough
But I'm gonna be out
When they come for your stuff
So cheer up now it's not all doom and gloom
They never got around to decorating your room <start> How could I feel that we're in condition to get along
Impending a suffocating fight
Outside is appealing
Feeling like we feel
Connected in a cloud of let's lost
Time fits to find we've extended everything
Spread thin accomplishing nothing right
Each time we're colliding
Feeling like we've killed
The focus of a time thats been lost
Let's distinguish when connection falls away
Finding a decision when our senses run away
Feels like we sing with open stomachs hanging
To feed upon the challenge of consumption
Still
I'm ashamedbeat
In this optimistic hole
Is there light at the end
Finally let's distinguish when connection falls away
Keeps us from pretending every other step we take
Finally let's distinguish when connection falls away
Keeps us from pretending every step we take
We can recognize all the ways we've led to
Stillness and content
I can hardly feel
What was once alive
Burried in disguise
Finally let's distinguish when connection falls away
Keeps us from pretending every other step we take
Finally let's distinguish when connection falls away
Keeps us from pretending every step we take <start> Look around at what you see
There's an S.O.S. ringing out for me
I thought I believed but I just turn away
From these souls living in this hell today
Tears are falling on my face
From my face
And love love will find a way to break through
This love finds a way to shine through
Your love finds a way to break through
This love finds a way to kiss you
I stare in the eyes of this flesh and bone
I'm a tourist here so tomorrow I go home
I try to make sense of the things I've seen
Between the poverty and the five star dream
Tears are falling on my face
From my face
And love love will find a way to break through
This love finds a way to shine through
Your love finds a way to break through
This love finds a way to kiss you
Love will lead me to Your feet
Love won't pass me on the street
Love will look me in the eye
Love won't leave me here to die
To Your arms I'm gonna run
And escape what I've become
Love will find a better way so they say
And love love will find a way to break through
This love finds a way to shine through
Your love finds a way to break through
This love
His love it will break you
Love it will take you
His love it will break you down
And His love it will break me
Love it will take me
Love it will break me down
Love will find a way <start> The sky is falling.
Meet the UFO's.
There's bombs and then there's wars.
The people are faceless.
They're leaving this town.
The sky is falling.
They're scared of the monsters.
These beasts have two heads.
You can see them on the T.V. Headline at .
In herds just like cattle.
How's it gonna end.
The sky is falling.
They always know.
Big brother is watching and I can't sleep.
Where do we go.
They always know. <start> Jessica nan ajig jejarijyo

That's how this breaks down.
I never see things through
I always carry the weight for you for you.
And now I hesitate
With every step I take
I fear my back might break
If I don't leave today.
Always trying to please everyone
That I met and I ended up losing it all
But all that shit is gone
All that shit is gone.
I guess I felt abused
Is that something you choose
In a cheap disguise
I did everything for you.
Always trying to please everyone that I met
And I ended up losing it all
But all that shit is gone
All that shit is gone.
All that shit is gone
All that shit is gone.
I never got it right
I always carry the weight for you. <start> Generals gathered in their masses
Just like witches at black masses
Evil minds that plot destruction
Sorcers of death's construction
In the fields the bodies burning
As the war machine keeps turning
Death and hatred to mankind
Poisoning their brainwashed minds
Oh lord yeah
Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight
They leave that role to the poor
Yeah
Time will tell them they have power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating like people just like pawns in chess
Wait until that judgment day comes
Yeah




Now in darkness world stops turning
As you hear the bodies burning
No more war pigs have the power
And as god has struck the hour
They have judgment
God is calling
On their knees the war pigs crawling
Making mercies for their sins
Satan laughing spreads his wings
Oh lord yeah <start> Last rays of sunlight die
Full moon begins to rise
Reflected in your eyes
Chorus
I can't believe that this is happening
You make the motor in me
Flutter and Wow
The crowd was gathering
The clock struck five then ten
My happy tears were descending
Chorus
Flutter and Wow
Flutter and Wow
You make the motor in me
Flutter and Wow
Flutter and how
The incident tape across the bed
Threading it from the reel to the head
I'm planting this thought in a magnetic field
And pushing the button
And all of a sudden
Erase everything rotten
Fascinated and uptight
Make me shout out loud
Make me cry all day and night
My voice got stuck in my throat...
Pulled my hand up into the sleeve of my coat
So you'd never know how it was shaking
Chorus
Flutter and Wow
Flutter and Wow
You make the motor in me
Start up and stop again
When I am spluttering
You make the motor in me
Flutter and wow
Flutter and how
Flutter and wow
Flutter and how
To the bridge
The incident tape across the bed
Threading it from the reel to the head
I'm planting this thought in a magnetic field
And pressing the button
And all of a sudden
Erase everything rotten
Fascinated and uptight
Make me shout out loud
Make me cry all day and night <start> Glad to see you I had a funny dream
And you were wearing funny shoes you were going to a dance
You were dressed like a punk but you are too young to remember
I'm glad to see you I'm outside the house
I'm not thinking right today I've got no energy
I'm glad that you were waiting with me tell me all about your day
Breaking off this misery
I see a wilderness for you and me
Punctuated by philosophy
I'm wondering how things could've been
I'm happy for you you've made it hard for me
I counted on your company you are staying with your friends tonight
I'm feeling sorry for myself I keep taking everything to be to be a sign
I'm happy for you but now I know this hurt is poison
Too sharp to be bled I'm sitting on my empty bed
On my empty bed at night the fever grows it's pounding pounding
I'd rather be in Tokyo I'd rather listen to Thin Lizzyoh
Watch the Sunday Gang in Harajuku
There's something wrong with me I'm a cuckoo
Scary moment and lovin' every moment I was high from playing shows
We lost a singer to her clothes my trouble raised its ugly head
I was revealed and I was home in bed I was a kid again
Jesus told me Go after every coin like it was
The last in the world and protect the wayward child
But I'm a little lost sheep
I need my Bo Peep you know I need my shepherd here tonight
Breaking off this misery
I see a wildness for you and me
Punctuated by philosophy
I'm wondering how things could've been
I'd like to see you but really I should stay away and let you settle down
I've got no claims to your crown I was the boss of you
And I loved you you know I loved you it's all over now
And I was there for you when you were lonely
I was there when you were bad I was there when you were sad
Now it's my time of need I'm thinking
Do I have to plead to get you by my side
I'd rather be in Tokyo I'd rather listen to Thin Lizzyoh
And watch the Sunday Gang in Harajuku
There's something wrong with me I'm a cuckoo <start> Just because in a moment of madness
I took advantage of your sweet love
Don't just hand me a lifetime of sadness
When there's so little I'm guilty of
One chain don't make no prison
Two wrongs don't make no right
One rain don't make no river
One punch don't make no fight
Can you spare me a little affection
Would that be askin' too much of you
Don't point love in another direction
I swear I'll make it up to you
One chain don't make no prison
Two wrongs don't make no right
One rain don't make no river
One punch don't make no fight
There's a bed I'm keepin' empty for you
There's a lot I know I've got to prove
Don't let a simple misunderstanding
Be a mountain that we can't move <start> There there it is
I swear he's gonna murder that poor kid
Wait I hear it again
Don't turn on the lights until we
Hear the way it ends
Under Peruvian skies
Vanessa regretfully waits
The story unfolds in her eyes
Where midnight hysteria's
No big surprise
Battered and bruised
Always confusing
The love that she's losing for hate
Poor Vanessa
Hey I hope you know
I'm taking all of this time with me when I go
Shame you're not to blame
I'm the monster you created
In your daddy's name
Under Peruvian skies
Vanessa regretfully waits
The story unfolds in her eyes
Where midnight hysteria's
No big surprise
Battered and bruised
Always confusing
The love that she's losing for hate
Poor Vanessa
Terror by night
Liar by day
Telling her secrets
Won't take them away

The story unfolds in her eyes
Where midnight hysteria's
No big surprise
Battered and bruised
Always confusing
The love that she's losing for hate
Poor Vanessa <start> Instrumental <start> Oh Danny boy the pipes the pipes are calling
From glen to glen and down the mountain side
The summer's gone and all the roses dying
'Tis you 'tis you must go and I must bye
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
And I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
Oh Danny boy oh Danny boy I love you so
But if he come and all the roses dying
And I am dead as dead I well may be
He'll come here and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an ava there for me
And I shall feel oh soft you tread above me
And then my grave will richer sweeter be
For you will bend and tell me that you love me
And I shall rest in peace until you come to me <start> Turn to me turn to me when you're lonely
Brush them aside gather your pride
Baby turn to me
Turn to me turn to me when you're lonely
Brush them aside gather your pride
Baby turn to me
Don't listen to the people
Who spread lies about your name
I know it hurts
But baby I've had it too
I've learned to live with their abuse
I've learned to live with those who choose
To disregard my emptiness and lose me
Your laughter has died in the heat of the night
The people they pretend that company is bright
But brighter you'll wait by the phone that has died
Don't bury your hopes there's nothing that's left for you to confide in <start> Dont wanna be in your X Generation
aint part of your new sensation

Im on a mission that i gotta complete
im on a mission against the man on the street
I got no money but it dont matter

I got no money but it dont matter

Played so hard his feet
They never touched the ground
Never felt afraid
Hour after shining hour
No thought of time
No parents worrying
Innocent of fear
Now my my look at that sky
Closing his eyes on a new tomorrow
Hey hey Heaven's in tears
Crying for the disappeared
She grew up on easy streets
Danced so hard her feet
They never touched the ground
Love was all around
No locks on their front door
She'd stay out late
And they'd know she was safe
No need to beware
Now my my look at that sky
Closing his eyes on a new tomorrow
Hey hey Heaven's in tears
Crying for the disappeared
My my look at that sky
Turning his back on a generation
Hey hey Heaven's in flames
And no one wants to take the blame
Blame for children of the disappeared
Bleeding crying children dying
Parents who live in fear

Children who disappear

Bleeding crying children dying


Parents who live in fear

Children who disappear

Bleeding crying children dying

Their life with never be the same
For children who disappear
And parents who live in fear
No more the easy streets
No sound of children's
Footsteps on the ground
Fear lies all around
No more the unlocked door
No more the children
Laughing as they play
Nowhere left that's safe
Now my my look at that sky
Closing his eyes on a new tomorrow
Hey hey Heaven's in tears
Crying for the disappeared
My my look at that sky
Turning his back on a generation
Hey hey Heaven's in flames
And no one wants to take the blame
Blame for children of the disappeared <start> People die over religion

Kids are brought up on hatrad
If thats religion I don't want it
Fuck religion full of shit
Fuck religion full of shit

A lying fuck but people believe
Caught in a hotel with his trousers down
Saving souls for his fee

Religion ain't worth dying for

Can you prove that God was man

Cause he was telling everyone in town
About the love that he just found
And Marie's the name of his latest flame
He talked and talked and I heard him say
That she had the longest blackest hair
The prettiest green eyes anywhere
And Marie's the name of his latest flame
Though I smiled the tears inside were aburning
I wished him luck and then he said goodbye
He was gone but still his words kept returning
What else was there for me to do but cry
Would you believe that yesterday
This girl was in my arms and swore to me
She'd be mine eternally
And Marie's the name of his latest flame
Though I smiled the tears inside were aburning
I wished him luck and then he said goodbye
He was gone but still his words kept returning
What else was there for me to do but cry
Would you believe that yesterday

She'd be mine eternally

To a place outside of town
I go there every Sunday
To watch the sun go down
There's plenty of girls who know you
They've been asking where you've been
Johnny don't disappoint them
They'd all like to see you again
Willy I don't think I'm ready
To leave this house of mine
You go out and tell them
I'm not the social kind
Some men they are lovers
Others the fighting type
And me I'm in the middle of
Choosing which one I'd like to be
Judy she's out catching
Rides in passing cars
Memories of me and her
Have burned out like the stars
Me I'm not disappointed
In knowing that she's free
Somewhere down the line I knew she'd
One day up and leave
Willy forget your troubles
And lay back on the grass
There's no need to get nostalgic
Thinking about the past
What's gone is gone
What's here is now
She's standing by a fence
She's wearing a beautiful party dress
And wanting you to dance <start> Another F again I fret
Another cocky hypocrite
Another dirty look from a passerby
Kiddy porn and lunatics
All the things that make me sick
Another suicide from a sad rock star
So get the fuck out of my face
And disappear without a trace
You annoying little prick
I'll reach into my bag of tricks
And then I'll pull out a hand grenade
Your machoism fades away
But I will not pull out the pin
Because that's mean
With judgment day not far away
You're sniffing all your days away
I don't know who to blame
Is it me or is it you
Violent death and viruses
And lack thereof of consciousness
Another shitty song on the radio
Lets go
I'll kick the teeth out of your face
I killed the cat there's no more chase
You push on me. I'll push you back
So come on girls let's go attack
Don't look at me I've had my fill
Don't find yourself inside a pill
But I will not pull out my gun
'Cause I don't have one
Why can't you let me be
Said Why can't you just let me be
Why can't you just let me be
Why can't you just let me be

I wander around as I repeat this to myself
It's the only answer I have even if I'm scared of getting hurt.
I'll say I love you to the one I love
Do you love me or not
I don't care what the answer is I just need to know
No matter how badly I desire to be with you
There are many unchangeable things in this world
and my love for you
can't be stopped by anyone
As  nights pass I long to tell you
I have to let you know
I want you to love me but I don't think you will.
I wander around as I repeat this to myself
It's the only answer I have even if I'm scared of getting hurt.
I'll say I love you to the one I love
Putting these feelings into words is so scary
but I'll say I love you to the one I love
The happiness we chance upon in our lives can't be expressed in words
That's why we can only smile
Why we sing do re mi among the vivid autumn colors
With winter at our backs and the spring sunbeams peeking through the leaves
as to protect someone who's just been reborn
As I looked at the road I'd traveled and the path ahead
my eyes were filled with cowardice
I wanted to look into your eyes but was afraid I wouldn't be honest
I didn't want to know that you didn't love me
and live the rest of my days alone
That day I kept on loving you without getting hurt
As  nights pass I long to tell you
I have to let you know
I want you to love me but I don't think you will.
I wander around as I repeat this to myself
It's the only answer I have even if I'm scared of getting hurt.
I'll say I love you to the one I love
Even if my feelings aren't returned I can say I love you to the one I love
And that's the most beautiful thing in the world <start> From a rundown cathedral that stood on the edge of the city
On sundays came a sound I will always recall
It was sweet and complete
And it flowed through this coldhearted city
And it sends me a heavenly shiver to think of it now ...
Come hear the voices of san pedro's children ...
Fill the air  ohoh ohoh ...
Joining hands and voices for the world to share ...
And how the cathedral would ring ...
When san pedro's children would sing ...
You'd hear them going ...
La la la la
La la la la la ...
vaya con dios mi amigo en las noches felices
I could not understand but the message I found
'cause the heavens seemed to translate
The words they were singing
And I know that somewhere an angel is writing it down
Come hear the voices of san pedro's children ...
Fill the air  ohoh ohoh ...
Joining hands and voices
For the world to share ...
And how the cathedral would ring ...
When san pedro's children would sing ...
You'd hear them going ...
La la la la
La la la la la ...
Time presses on and they tore down that rundown cathedral
Never will the joy ring so clear through the town
But on sundays if you stand very still ...
As the sun's coming over the hill ...
I swear ...
Sweet lord ...
I hear them goin' ...
La la la la la ...
La la la la la ...
La la la la la ...
Come hear the ...
Come hear the ...
Voices of san pedro's children ...
Fill the air  ohoh ohoh ...
Joining hands and voices
For the world to share ...  ohoh ohoh ...
La lala la la la la la la lala ...
La lala la la la la la la lala ...
La lala la la la la la la lala ...
La lala la la la la la la lala ... <start> Silent whisperings
Fills my mind
Because I have
Drowned in my own...
Tears are flowing
Like a neverending
Stream of
Sadness
Sad am I
Because my feelings
Deep inside
Are lost...
For eternity
I have waited
To retrieve you
My lost love
In a deep
Sleep you feel
Never to
Breathe again
Floating
Above us
You are
Still here
Tending my
Sadden mourning
Tending my
Tearfull eyes
Flowers in
Your warm hands
Soothing
My grief
My life
Will never
Be fulfilled
Without you
Alone
I am
Until
I die
In memory of
Your beauty
My life I
Give to you
A gift that
You once gave me
So long
Ago <start> Oh I'm a dark diamond
I've turned hard and cold
Once was a jewel with fire in my soul
There's two sides of a mirror
One I couldn't break through
Stayed trapped on the inside wound up losing you
Tell me how does it work
How do you make things fit
Spent all my life trying to get it right
I've put it together and it falls apart
I thought to myself I might understand
But when the wall's built
And the heart hardens
You get a dark diamond
Dark diamond
Oh I'm a dark diamond
But you're something else
You read me more than I read myself
The one star I could count on
Only comet I could trust
You burnt through my life to the true meaning of love <start> Sweet Anabelle as seen reclining on an ocean swell
As the waves do lather up to lay her down
'Til she's fast and sleeping
Oh well I guess I'm something of a ne'erdowell
Who fell asleep at the pealing of the steeple bell
I'm on track and keeping
But oh if I could only get you ocean side
To lay your muscles wide
It'd be heavenly
Oh if I could only coax you overboard
To leave these rolling shores
To get you oceanside
Oceanside oceanside
At rising tide you're looking fresher than a July bride
We're picking up what our mothers always stigmatized
The field is right for reaping
Oh well I guess I'm something of a neerdowell
Even though that's something I could never do well
I'm on track and keeping
But oh if I could only get you ocean side
To lay your muscles wide
It'd be heavenly
Oh if I could only coax you overboard
To leave these rolling shores
To get you oceanside
Oceanside oceanside <start> With waving dark hair and brown eyes
She stares you into focus
While pretending not to care
She's wondering if you really notice
That she can drive you insane
And she stop a train in those jeans
There's no other way to tell you
She knows what love really means
Maria she's one in a million to me
Maria she is the only one for me
And little does she know
She's the reason for every single dream
And little does she know
I'm comin apart at the seams
With one touch of her hand
She reminds me why I came to be
And I think it's time she knows
She's the only one for me
Chorus
Chorus
Chorus <start> Well you're right I'm left she's gone
You're right and I'm left all alone
Well you tried to tell me so
But how was I to know
That she was not the one for me
You told me all along
You're right our love was so wrong
But now I changed my mind
Because she broke the ties that bind
And I know that she never cared for me
Well I thought I knew just what she'd do
I guess I'm not so smart
Oh you tried to tell me all along she'd only break my heart
I'm left you're right she's gone
You're right and I'm left all alone
Well she's gone I know not where
But now I just don't care
For now I'm falling for you
If you'll forgive me now
I'll make it up somehow
So happy we will be
In a home just for three
And I'll soon forget her now I know
Well I thought I knew just what she'd do
I guess I'm not so smart
You tried to tell me all along
She'd only break my heart
Well you're right I'm left she's gone
You're right and I'm left all alone
Well she's gone I know not where
But now I just don't care
For now I've fallen for you <start> Gyrate it till you had your fill
Just like a pneumatic drill
Don't let it go down the drain
Ya better hop on the cosmic wagon train
Cosmic Cosmic
I was havin' this outofbody experience
Saw these cosmic beings
Everywhere I went up there they were shakin' their cosmic things
Like someone gave ya a wild goose or a freight train with
A loose caboose

Shake it till the butter melts shake it till the butter melts
Shake that cosmic thing shake that thing shake it ohhhh yeah
Shake that thing all night long shake it man you can't go wrong

That's why it'll never work
You had me suicidal suicidal
When you say it's over
Damn all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do your dirt
They'll have you suicidal suicidal
When they say it's over
See it started at the park
Used to chill at the dark
Oh when you took my heart
That's when we fell apart
Cause we both thought
That love lasts forever 
They say we're too young
To get ourselves sprung
Oh we didn't care
We made it very clear
And they also said
That we couldn't last together 
See it's very define girl
You're one of a kind
But you mash up my mind
You ought to get declined
Oh Lord
My baby is driving me crazy
You're way too beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
You had me suicidal suicidal
When you say it's over
Damn all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do your dirt
They'll have you suicidal suicidal
When they say it's over
It was back in '
Watchin' movies all the time
Oh when I went away
For doin' my first crime
And I never thought
That we was gonna see each other 
And then I came out
Mami moved me down South
Oh I'm with my girl
Who I thought was my world
It came out to be
That she wasn't the girl for me 
See it's very define girl
You're one of a kind
But you mash up my mind
You ought to get declined
Oh Lord
My baby is driving me crazy
You're way too beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
You had me suicidal suicidal
When you say it's over
Damn all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do your dirt
They'll have you suicidal suicidal
When they say it's over
Now we're fussin'
And now we're fightin'
Please tell me why
I'm feelin' slightin'
And I don't know
How to make it better
You're datin' other guys
You're tellin' me lies
Oh I can't believe
What I'm seein' with my eyes
I'm losin' my mind
And I don't think it's clever 
You're way too beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
You'll have me suicidal suicidal suicidal <start> Here come your pride and joy
The comic little drunk
You call your boy
Making everybody smile
Who takes your pretty plan
And then becomes a disappearing man
After a little while
I saw you with your makeup running down
Now what's that all about
You say you don't want anyone around
Cause you're all cleaned out
You toss the empty beer
Not really as composed as you appear
A icicle inside
Wearing clothes that clash
Wondering is this treasure is this trash
Still trying to decide
About  o'clock here comes your clown
With the foot he's throwing down
But all you say is you don't want anyone around
Come not right now
There ain't nothing to dream
You don't want to think about it
I'm sorry you seem so stumped
And I'm sorry you think you have to hold your tongue
When your so pretty and smart
I'm seeing you caving in
Becoming afraid of all these men
That you've given your heart
I saw you with your make up running down
Now what's that all about
You say you don't want anyone around
Cause you're cleaned out
All cleaned out
All cleaned out <start> O ho pression
You preyed on us when we sleep
Oppression
You chased after the tired the poor the weak
Oppression
You know you mean only harm
Oppression
You reach out with your long arm
But oppression
I won't let you near me oh no
Oppression
You shall learn to fear me yes you will
Oppression
You seek population control
Oppression
To divide and to conquer is your goal
Oppression
I swear that hatred is your home
Oppression
You just won't leave bad enough alone
But oppression
I won't let you near me oh no
Oppression
You shall learn to fear me yes you will
Oppression
I don't see how you sleep
Oppression
For your bleeding conscience I weep
Oppression
You may have the dollar on your side
But oppression
From the gospel truth you cannot hide
And oppression
I won't let you near me oh no
Oppression
You shall learn to fear me yes you will
Oppression
I won't let you near me oh no
Oppression
You shall fear me yes you will <start> Some nights you lie
Some nights you don't
But they all feel the same
Sometimes you wish you could turn to stone
And be perfect always
I I can't feel like this no more
In the crowd alone 'cause no one wants to know you
Do they
Don't they
Right here but no one's watching
Here comes the invisible man
That no one turns to see
I'm just another dumb fool who'll never go down in history
Yeah you're standing there with the homecoming king
Turn the silver spoon into a diamond ring
Can he make you disappear without anyone noticing
Yeah fuck the homecoming king
You see your life is drawn out
Don't feel the world that you know
Caught in the tower singing
Oh no that's not the life I chose
Most days you rise and start to fade
'Cause no one loves you
Avert their eyes and look away
Life without virtue
I I can't feel like this no more
You walk these halls and feel the same
'Cause you can't find your place
Right here but no one's watching
Here comes the invisible man
That no one turns to see
I'm just another dumb fool who'll never go down in history 
Yeah you're standing there with the homecoming king
Turn the silver spoon into a diamond ring
Can he make you disappear without anyone noticing
Yeah fuck the homecoming king
And I stare the fan on the ceiling
All night all night
All these memories won't stop running
My mind my mind
And the rats in the walls keeps scratching
My life my life
And all the voices won't stop laughing
I can't fight again
Here comes the invisible man
That no one turns to see
I'm just another dumb fool who'll never go down in history 
Yeah you're standing there with the homecoming king
Turn the silver spoon into a diamond ring
Can he make you disappear without anyone noticing
Yeah fuck the homecoming king
You see your life is drawn out
Don't feel the world that you know
Caught in the tower singing
Oh no that's not the life I chose
You see your hands are tied now
Just like your eyes will stay closed
Come in the tower singing
Oh no that's not the life I chose <start>

As long as the world dont care about our love
We will go anywhere
As long as the world dont care about our love
Oh come to me
And the brightness of the morning

In to meet another day
We will go anywhere
As long as the world dont care about our love
We will go anywhere
As long as the world dont care about our love

Never ever stop falling in love <start> Get your fat ass off the acetate into
Down twenty why stairs
It came from the rest There
Goes to rest in the heart
First I was a foreigner
Then suddenly Everything  was cool forever
This Western Orientals going full circle
This Western Orientals going full circle
Last number recall
Told me what you were up to
Put the volume down on adverts
To emphasize how sad they are
Mar ships sexier
And from all the above
This Western Orientals going full circle
This Western Orientals going full circle <start> Waiting for the flood we know it coming I'grease on the gears ever turning The millions that never cry The billions with half closed eyes A trillion will never try And the masses still multiply Yeah yet today I break away We're drowning in words and no one listens Living this curse with no remission With nothing never tried before This tune you may have heard before These words have all been said before By greater men who stand no more Yeah yet today I break away <start> Pale purple nipples goose pimpled
She shivers shifts from a walk to a trot
Alone in the city infested with faces
Immune to new friendships
Interested in places she's never seen
She says everything is gray here
And nothing is green
The girls from down the street
Sixteen seventeen years old
You can smell them getting pregnant
You can hear their rock and roll
That's America you have to be tough
Like a glad trash bag the government's an old nag
With a good pedigree but pedigree's don't help you and me
I see the precedent is gray here and nothing is green
Unless something unforeseen happens
I'm surrounded by the haves
They say I can have some too
Just because of what I do
Do they think a lot about those who have not
Or does it just distract them from what they do
Most of us have gray
Except for those who can pay for green
I'm torn I'm torn rejecting outfits offered me
Regretting things I've worn
When I was still playing roles to fill holes
In my conception of who I am
You know now I understand
It's not important to be defined
It's only important to use your time well
Well time is something nobody can buy
And nobody can sell you
So don't let anybody tell you they have the advantage
Because all the gray people can say every day
Doesn't mean anything if your mind is green
Pale purple nipples goose pimpled
She shivers shifts from a walk to a trot
Alone in the city infested with faces
Immune to new friendships
Interested in places she's never seen
She says everything is gray here
Otherwise I'd stay here
But I'm looking for green <start> Lately you've been acting strange
Getting further out of range
Seems to me there's been a change
We don't exchange the things we used to
You say it's nothing
Baby I doubt it
Can't you see we did better without it
Why don't you just tell me about it
C'mon girl stand up and shout it
Baby let it out

Tell me what you're upset about
Let it out

Baby you've got to let it out
Give me more than what we knew
Tell me more than I love you
Tell me something I can do
To prove us through
Baby you've got to
Baby let it out

Tell me what you're upset about
Let it out

Baby you've got to let it out
Just care enough to let me inside it
Can't you see it's time you can fight it
Can't you see it's time that you cried it
C'mon girl don't try to hide it
Baby let it out

Tell me what you're upset about
Let it out

Baby you've got to let it out
Let it out

Tell me what you're upset about
Let it out

Baby you've got to let it out
Let it out

Tell me what you're upset about <start> Weit Du noch wie's frher war Frher war alles schlecht.
Der Himmel grau die Menschen mies  Die Welt war furchtbarungerecht.
Doch dann dann kam die Wende  Unser Leid war zu Ende.

Hipp Hipp Hurra alles ist super alles ist wunderbar.
Hipp Hipp Hurra alles ist besser als es damals war.
.Strophe
Frher waren wir alle traurig wir weinten jeden Tag.
Es nieselte wir waren oft krank  Jetzt ist alles total stark.
Jetzt lachen immer alle und reien stndig Witze.
Wir sind nur noch am Baden gehen  Wejen die Hitze
Und ich find es wirklich scharf  Dass ich das noch erlebendarf.
Refrain
Hipp Hipp Hurra alles ist super alles ist wunderbar.
Hipp Hipp Hurra alles ist besser als es gestern war.
Alle sind happy alle sind glcklich alle sind froh.
Und berall wo man hinguckt Liebe und Frieden und so.

Gestern ging es allen dreckig  Heute geht es steil bergauf.
Jeder hat  Richtige  Alle sind total gut drauf.

Friede Freude Eierkuchen  Alle singen Ja ja ja

Und berall wo man hinguckt Liebe und Frieden und so <start> I stand around at American weddings
I stand around for family
At my best when I'm terrorist inside
At my best when it's all me
I was there when they took all the people
I was alone in a mental ravine
You breathe life when you break the walls down
You breathe life when you set me free
Where is my head
Where are my bones
Why are my days so far from home
Where is my head
Where are my bones
Can you save me from myself
Can you save me from myself
Freethinking renegade social
Mister Moon Man now
Out of the slipstream of my possibilities
Got the boat so we don't drown
These are the days that I'm split down the middle
No words to calm me down
Be sure that what you dream of
Won't come to hunt you down
Where is my head
Where are my bones
Why are my days so far from home
Ghostman
Where is my head
Where are my bones
How come we get so lost
Ghostman
Ghostman
Where is my head
Where are my bones
Can you save me from myself
Ghostman <start> I ain't broke but I'm badly bent
I had a little money but that's all been spent
When I look back I wonder where it went
It ain't no joke I ain't broke but I'm badly bent
I went to see a socalled friends
To get a little help for the tie I was in
I said I'll pay you back someday when my rich uncle passes away
But he looked at me kinda foolishly and then he had these words to say
He said I ain't broke but I'm badly bent...
Then I called my true love on the phone
The one I spent my last dollar on
I said I'll pay you back someday when my rich uncle passes away
But she said I'm through with the likes of you
And she had a quite few more words to say <start> Wash it in the sea
Let it soak all night
Wash it in the sea
Let the saltwater wash it away
Soak it in bleach
till it's white on white
soak it in bleach
till the blood just washes away
hang it in the wind
let it blow all night
hang it up high
let the high wind blow it away
hang it in the wind
let the sun burn bright
hang it in the wind
till the blood just washes away
i have waited wasted years for the child that's come and gone today
say what about this wasted fear
how can i just turn and wash it away
If I can then I will wash it away
if she can then she will wash it away.
If I can then I will wash it away
if she can then she will wash it away.
Forty years spent one by one
Forty years of life just slipping away.
What I'd give for a firstborn son.
Forty years of blood just washing away.
I have waited wasted lives
I have waited long enough I'd say
Say what about this wasted child
How can I just turn and wash it away
If I can then I will wash it away.
If she can then she will wash it away
I I can then I will wash it away
If she can then she will
Wash it away
Send me an angel.
Send me the ghost that i was
Send me an angel
Send me the ghost that i was
That I was
That I am
I will wash it away
She will wash it away
If I can then I will wash it away
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Uh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah <start> Now that we're one
Now softly whispers saving grace
 as I awake
And stronger than last year
My eyes closed  the stars can see me
Stars will meet me on the ground
Summer's gone
And winter is never too far now
And my poor arms outstretched so long
That my bones are now breaking
But there you come with a smile
That'd send any man to his knees
And I feel I've begun
Now that we're one now
You graciously add to i
Graciously add you to my heart <start> I wonder if it's safe.
It's no wonder I'm afraid.
And I wonder if you'll stay.
I wonder everyday.
You're wonderful.
You're wonderful and I'm left here in awe.
You're wonderful.
You're wonderful and I'm nothing at all.
I wonder if you're real.
Do you wonder why you're here
There's no other way to feel.
You're wonderful to me. <start> The roof the roof the roof is on fire
We don't need no water let the motherfucker burn
Burn motherfucker burn
Burn burn burn burn
Just a little and nothing now it's over
Just a little and nothing now it's over
What you said no
You're never gonna say again
In your own special way you tear me down
Sway so hypnotic
Neither up nor down
Just been turned and turned
It just sits inside so it burns and burns
If I can't decide what makes you hurt
In your own special way you tear me down
So ask me please please
Give me something good now
Something
Give me something good now
Give me
Come sway this way <start> Silken hair more silken hair
Fell on her face and no wind was blowin'

Silken hair more silken hair
Lay near her pillbox down at her feet

I peeked in and when I saw she'd
Lost her hair I thought I would keel

When she saw her shining forehead
Didn't stop she swooned to the ground

Laughed so hard I
Blew my mind
I blew my cool
I blew myself over
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Sha na na sha na na na na na na na na
What a blow
Sha na na sha na na na na na na na na
What a blow
Sha na na sha na na na na na na na na
What a blow
Sha na na sha na na na na na na na na
What a blow
Sha na na sha na na
She drew her comb acrost her scalp
And brushed what she had left
I tried to salvage what I could
And threw it in a sack
She made a beline to her room
And grabbed all kind o' juice
She started pourin' it on her head
And thought it'd grow it back
Ah ha haaaaaa
You're too late mama
Ain't nothin' upside your head
No more no more no more no more
Upside your head
Too late mama
Ain't nothin' upside your head
No more no more no more no more
Upside
Upside your head
You're too late mama
Ain't nothin' upside your head
No more no more no more no more
 <start> The architect angel held < > juda ranch.
Just a dirty mile down on the borderline.
Where he mastered blastin' and hustled young cattle for slaughter
And dated juda's daughter.
From the cellar aways to the attics and all across the plains
Broke electric static of religious strain
And though he was never an addict he wore scars on his veins.
Like a young girl holds her first pimp he held his Bible in.
From desert bars and church bazaars the hunger slowly came
With vulgar faces from vulgar places lookin' for a game.
Well ivory gun handles and chamber grease
And soupedup hydroplanes.
The bullets burn from tv silver bearin' great cowboys' names.
Now with  inches of gun barrel smokin' from the lid
Spurs on straight black bootheels he said they call me the brooklyn kid.
And in his lonely zenith nightmares well that's just what they did.
Oh how he played out his scenes loaded on < > dreams.
Well his holster slung low like a hot kidsister
Tied back to his leg like he gonna do.
He was stompin' the step he called the quickman twister.
His sixguns were pumpin' through.
His tongue hung low like sawdust scrapin' across the plains.
He crawled up outside the juda ranch.
And started callin' the angel names.
And now the architect angel stood in one hand a staff the other a gun.
He held the staff high in the wind. the gun was like a piece in the sun.
He started howlin' like a monsoon wind. drew fast. the job was done.
At night the moon stretched tight light 'cross the plains
As real cowboys sat around real campfire flames
And the county wolf called as if to explain to his son
The way the west was won.
The west was finally won.
The way the west was won. <start> This is me calling you out for all these built up superstitions
They haunt me now and then for just a little light down here
Well I would run I would cross a thousand seas
And in our perfect world you would wait at the other side
I know that you you'll follow up with all the answers
If you were there for me at all
This is the way that I can't describe anything I've felt for a while
It's just a little too much to take
This is the way that I can't describe anything I've felt for a while
It's just a little too much to take
Tell me what would you have to say for asking who you really are
Oh God I want to know just a little truth down here
Well I would write I would write a thousand songs
Sing them all to you you know you wouldn't have to say a thing
I know that you you'll follow up with all the answers
If you were there for me at all
This is the way that I can't describe anything I've felt for a while
It's just a little too much to take
But this is the way I can't describe anything I've felt for a while
It's just a little too much to take
So enough with everyone else's words
It's just a sign that nothing makes sense to me
And this is your last chance
I'd cut you just to watch you bleed
It's the only way to make you see that you are never there for me
You're never there for me
You're never there for me never there for me at all
I know that you you'll follow up with all the answers
If you were there for me at all
This is the way that I can't describe anything I've felt for a while
It's just a little too much to take
But this is the way I can't describe anything I've felt for a while
It's just a little too much to take <start> My friends tried to tell me but they were too late yeah

In a dying essence
Crying beauty
The fettered aura
Forgotten oceans of hope
Betrayed aphony
Sullen laughter in unventured paradise

For landscapes serene
Amidst the sunset of age
With joyous masquerade
The summers died <start> World premier..

Aww girl <start> You touched my hand
Said Follow me
I'll be your eyes when you cannot see
Now the only blindness that I'm gonna choose
Is ignorance to all your misuse
There was a time when you held all the cards
And you dealt them all evenly 'cause I couldn't see
You read my mind
Left yourself so hard to find
I thought you knew me better than I knew myself
Spend your time cutting me down
When it's plain to see it's faith that will carry
Spend your time cutting me down
When it's plain to see it's faith that will carry
Spend your time cutting me down you touched my hand
When it's plain to see it's faith that will carry
Spend your time cutting me down I'll be your eyes
When it's plain to see it's faith that will carry
I could try talkin' to you but I already learned all I need to
Spend your time cutting me down
Don't listen to a word then you throw me a frown
To catch the eye of a stranger is nothing new
I was just waitin' for something to do
It was a twisted pair but now I'm through
Spend your time cutting me down you touched my hand
When it's plain to see it's faith that will carry said it's faith that will carry
Spend your time cutting me down I'll be your eyes
When it's plain to see it's faith that will carry
Spend your time cutting me down you read my mind
When it's plain to see it's faith that will carry left yourself so hard to find
Spend your time cutting me down I thought you knew me better
When it's plain to see it's faith that will carry than I knew myself
You touched my hand
Said Follow me

Now the only blindness that I'm gonna choose
Is ignorance to all your misuse

When it's plain to see it's faith that will carry than I knew myself
You touched my hand
Said Follow me
I'll be your eyes when it's plain to see it's faith that will carry <start> Here come the signs
Of earlywarning misery
Here come the sounds
It looks like a river up to here
Underneath my head
Here comes the sight
I might just lose it 
Here comes the part
Where you ask me for my sympathy
I just might lose my head
Have you seen me
Can you hear me
Did you think you could win me over
I've been hard to hold
I've been hard to hold
And I'm missing
I made you get down
I made you get down on your hands and knees
But I made it up
I took you away from your misery
And you can't say it's 
Now here comes the past
It looks like what's in front of me
This may be the last
This may be the last thing you'll see of me
And it might be your key to rest
I've been hard to hold
And I'm missing <start> You gave me this
You made me give
Your silver grin
Still sticking it in
You have soul machine
Soul machine
The longest kiss
Peeling furniture days
Drift madly to you
Pollute my heart drain
You have broken at me
Broken me
All your mental armor drags me down
Nothing hurts like your mouth mouth mouth
Your loaded smiles
Pretty just desserts
Wish it all for you
So much it never hurts
You have soul machine
Stolen me
All your mental armor drags me down
We can't breathe when you come around
All your mental armor drags me down
Nothing hurts like your mouth mouth mouth
Your mouth mouth mouth
Your mouth mouth mouth
We've been missing long before
Never found our way home
We've been missing long before
Where we'll find our way
You gave me this
Made me give
You have soul machine
Broken free
All your mental armor drags me down
We can't breathe when you come around
All your mental armor drags me down
Nothing hurts like your mouth mouth mouth
Your mouth mouth mouth
Your mouth mouth mouth
All your mental armor
All your mental armor
And your mouth
Mouth <start> Go
When I fall down on my own
It came out to meet to me
 just like waitin' for me the night
The children of the night in my mind 
Glowing bright
Children night
Glowing bright
It just the bleeding light
It's just the bleeding light
Glowing bright into the night
Glowing bright in the bleeding light <start> If a load was illegal they'd call on the Eagle. That trucker'd been cheating for years.
He lived on back highways and unpatrolled byways with only his conscience to hear.
He made his first run at the age  with a load of bootleg alcohol. Well his time is near done cause he's planned his last run with the biggest payload of them all.
Chorus
He's an old gearjammer putting down his last hammer headed straight for that slammer or a hole in the ground.
If Smokey should miss him or an angel don't kiss him then the devil might get him cause he is hell bound.
End Chorus
He weren't into hijacking with his fifth wheel abacking to hook into some booze was a breeze. With his hot cargo rolling though silence is golden somebody had called the police.
In a bar in Juarez a gal named Inez was waiting for Eagle that night. But how could she know in the dawn's early glow that the Eagle was on his last flight.
Chorus
He's an old gearjammer putting down his last hammer headed straight for the slammer or a hole in the ground.
If Smokey should miss him or an angel don't kiss him then the devil might get him cause he is hell bound.
End Chorus
As he drove through the night payday was in sight  hours and his trip would be done. It was his last load over smuggler's road and he'd soon see his Mexican son.
Well he knew they were there when red lights lit the air old Eagle had entered their trap.
Off that crooked road with his crooked load he knew there was no turning back.
Final Chorus
So this old gearjammer slammed down his last hammer to hell with that slammer it's a hole in the ground.
Lord let Smokey miss me let angels kiss me so the devil don't get me keep me from hell bound.
End Chorus
That truck it was loaded and when she exploded it went over that rail it's a quick way to die. The hillside it's a cooking but Smokey can't book em old Eagle is now flying high...... <start> Well I must have a door
In the back of my head.
Where I dump out all the crap
So I can just feel solid again.
No more sittin' around
Thinkin' about your hair
'Cause I must have a door
In the back of my back of my head.
Yeah.
I got a beautiful
New Asian girlfriend.
She comes over and hangs
Around for days in my bed.
You can't seriously believe
I'm thinking about you man.
'Cause I must have a door
In the back of my back of my head.
Well it's a brand new day
And I'm walking around old town.
I feel cool as shit cause
I got no thoughts keeping me down.
I'm thinking blah de blah blah blah
To your trip.
'Cause I must have a door
In the back of my back of my head.
Yeah.
Back of my head
Yeah I must have a door there. <start> Look out baby I'm after you
You done something to me that you ought not do
Played me up and now you've made me blue
And I'm lonely
Well I guess I'm on the rebound
That's what people say
I lost the only one I found
Who can make me feel this way yeah
And I'm lonely over you
Well look out baby better change your ways
You done something to me that's drivin' me crazy
Catch up with you one of these days
'Cause I'm lonely
Yeah I guess I'm on the rebound
Guess I've lost my touch
You're the only one for me
And I love you much too much
And I'm lonely over you
You oughta be ashamed of yourself
Treatin' me this way
Didn't know what it was all about
But I'm gonna find out someday
Yeah you better look out baby
Gonna make you mad
You're gonna miss me and the things you've had
Hate to say it but I'll be so glad
When you're lonely
Yeah then you'll be on the rebound
I'm waiting for the day
You'll lose the only one you found
Who could make you feel this way
Yeah you'll be lonely
You'll be lonely
You'll be lonely just like me
Just like me
Just like me <start> Oh you should see her now
We still love her now
She is going steady
But we're not ready
To see her fall in love
I know you are getting older
We should never turn our shoulder
I have never seen you suffer
I will never hurt you mother

I will never make you suffer
I will never hurt you mother <start> well there's a feeling in this world
that causes unrest
your ambition and success
is what i detest
i try to be true
i'm trying my best
i'm not seduced by your cheap love
hatreds and mess
you make me die
i heard all you gotta say
i heard it in school
about your softsoap sex
and your sickly drawl
but you only care for yourself
just like all the rest
you love you filthy god
and think you're the best
you make me die
TVs videos money and vice
get you crawling on the floor
like a suckin lice
you'll swallow seed
before you take advice
well someone should of told you girl
that ain't very nice
you make me die <start> Say goodbye
Well I know it's true.
I know you're leaving me but i
I'm leaving too.
You won't forget me
Or the sound of my name.
Please believe me
I feel the same.
It seems so empty now.
Close the door.
Ain't it hard to believe that you ever
Lived this way before.
All that nothing
Causes all that pain.
Please believe me
I feel the same.
Well this broken soul
That I know a a heart that's breakin'.
You can't make it whole
Until you know what has been taken.
And all those pieces
Uh that you find them all your own.
I said goodbye.
Now you know it's true.
You said you're leaving me but honey i
I'm leaving too.
You won't forget me
Or the sound of my name.
Please believe me
I feel the same.
Please believe me
I feel the same. <start> Junkies down in Brooklyn are going crazy
They're laughing just like hungry dogs in the street
Policemen are hiding behind the skirts of little girls
Their eyes have turned the color of frozen meat
No no no no no no no no no no no no
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave
Catholic schoolgirls have thrown away their mascara
They chain themselves to the axles of big Mack trucks
The sky is filled with hurt and shivering angels
The fat lady lives Children start your trucks
No no no no no no no no no no no no
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave

Joan Crawford has risen from the grave
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave
Joan Crawford has risen <start> My true love went riding out in white and green and gray
Past the pale of Offa's Wall where she was one to stray
And there she came upon a white and wounded fawn
Singing oh the hazards of love
She being full of charity a credit to her sex
Sought to right the fawn's hind legs when here her plans were vexed
The taiga shifted strange the beast began to change
Singing oh the hazards of love
Singing oh the hazards of love
You'll learn soon enough
The prettiest whistles won't wrestle the thistles undone undone
Fifteen lithesome maidens lay along in their bower
Fourteen occupations paid to pass the idle hour
Margaret heaves a sigh
Her hands clasped to her thigh
Singing oh the hazards of love
Singing oh the hazards of love
You'll learn soon enough
The prettiest whistles won't wrestle the thistles undone undone
Undone undone undone <start> No one knows my lady when she's lonely
No one sees the fantasies and fears my lady hides
There are those who've shared her love and laughter
But no one hears my lady when she cries but me
No one hears my lady when she cries
And when she cries she makes you want to run
And chase the sun and bring it back
To brighten up a corner of her dark and troubled skies
When she cries
You may have seen her lyin' in your lamplight
And if you've heard her whispered words it comes as no surprise
So be the one she shares her secret smiles with
But send me back my lady when she cries for me
My lady's gonna need me when she cries
And when she cries she makes you want to run
And chase the sun and bring it back
So bring me back my lady when she cries for me
Cause my lady's gonna need me when she cries <start> Caught off guard
Or I was even on
Forcing me down hard
Striking even blows
Monochrome mind
Is my only control
Nothing can make me whole
Never dreamed so real
Never felt the way I feel
Soft innards skin of steel
Pounding hard I will reveal
Static from the prison
Saturates my porous head
Distracted by the vision
Of the chrome that's cracking under
Stability I've never known
Catwalk frail and sagging low
Clutching at thin air
Walking my frail wooden ledge
My eyes burning my head pounding
Don't let me slip
Walk out from dark into the gray
Pain is relative in every way
I bit the nail that broke my back
Now it's chasing help I'm falling
Now it's broken my neck
I can't believe I fell for that
A blissful ignorance a comforting
Fact
Now it's shoved me down
burrowed in my head
Is the real me trapped or is he dead
Alone
Aligned
Iwalk
Abort
Confort
I scream
Sharpening deafening shock
Critical no more
Feeble now was my attempt
For my image gone now to lament
Kicked the chair from under me
I've always wondered but now I see
That all this can come to pass
Kicking choking soul flies as I gasp
Dross of life is gone from me
Soon I won't know sin
Nor blood
Nor screams
Alone
Aligned
I walk
Critical
No more
Shut out
Sharpening deafening shock
Free me take this break me <start> Thank you for the sleepless nights
I wish I could repay you for them.
Thank you for the best years of my life.
For this I thank you with these tears.
This is my last try now
Before I go
Don't you see me listening
I said all goodbyes by now
Stop before I go
And hear me cry
You were never there for them
and this one's for not showing me you care
and living lies through me
ignoring every plea with your phony sincerity.
Because of you I hate.
Because of you I feel left out can't trust can't smile.
Can't laugh can't sleep can't dream.
Be real you're fake.
Can't look you in the eyes anymore. <start> An inventory has been taken of every belonging
And there's so many values sought in event of emergencies
The only backup plan in case it doesn't work out
While reasons flap your hands to a former self
You know I am becoming a choice you should make it
You're problems
Problems with everything
Sometimes it's like conversations are a waking dream third party perspective
And all the answers to thyself you can almost hear the sound traveling
Cause a feeling of anticipation
When all of the sudden you know what's gonna happen
Before the paranoids they rebuild your world
They neither eat nor sleep they are nothing
Here in the worst I will become the best of the more the more problems
Problems with anything
No more problems problems with anything <start> The eastern world it is exploding
Violence flaring and bullets loading
You're old enough to kill but not for voting
You don't believe in war but what's that gun you're toting
And even Jordan river has bodies floating
But you tell me
Over and over and over again my friend
Ah you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction
My blood's is so mad it feels like coagulating
I'm sitting here just contemplating
I can't twist the truth it knows no regulation
And a handful of senators don't pass legislation
Busing alone can't bring segregation
When human respect is disintegrating
The whole fucking world is just too frustrating
But you tell me
Over and over and over again my friend
Ah you don't believe
We're on the eve of destruction
Well look at all the hate there is in Alhambra
Then look around to Selma Alabama
You may leave here for four days in space
But when you come back it's the same old place
The pounding of the drums pride and disgrace
You can bury your dead but don't leave a trace
Hate your next door neighbour but don't forget to say grace
But you tell me
Over and over and over again my friend
Ah you don't believe
We're on the eve of destruction <start> Now if there's a smile upon my face
it's only there trying to fool the public
but when it comes down to fooling you
now honey that's quite a diff'rent subject
Don't let my glad expression
give you the wrong impression really I'm sad
Oh sadder than sad you're gone and I'm hurting so bad
like a clown I pretend to be glad
Now there's some sad things known to man
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown when there's no one around
Oh yeah baby
Now if I appear to be carefree
it's only to camouflage my sadness
in order to shield my pride
I try to cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But Don't let my show convince you
that I've been happy since you decided to go
I need you so I'm hurt and I want you to know
but for others I put on a show
Now there's some sad things known to man
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown
when there's no one around
Just like Pagliacci did
I try to keep my sadness hid
smiling in the public eye
but in my lonely room I cry
the tears of a clown
Oh yeah baby
Now if there's a smile on my face
Don't let my glad expression
Give you a wrong impression
Don't let this smile I wear
Make you think that I don't care
Now there's some sad things known to man
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown when there's no one around <start> The latest do's and don'ts
That's the right approach
That's the way to smile
Buy a lot of style
Give me new ideas
Another year
With surreal memories
Watch the autumn leaves
Change the groove
In this you
Is this new
Never lose
And follow me down
In this town
All around
Hear the sound
Of all the leaves
Falling from the trees
Other melodies
And another view
Then breaking news
Is this new
And follow me down
In this town
All around
Hear the sound <start> Trained in the art of devastating
The arts be remaining unmoved in their midst
We came down down down
From that high and now we're looking for more
We're bloodless now
And we are uninterrupted by the majesty of it all
We're passed around around around
Like the currency of the friendless roads
One trick pony and the parlor
Isn't big enough for the both of us
'Til death do we rock
We're so full of shit
'Til death do we rock
You keep buying it
'Til death do we rock
You're so full of shit
'Til death do we rock
You're still buying it
The closed circuit of stimulus
That runs between fashion and guilt
Is winding tighter around the heart
Our orbits are collapsing upon themselves
We're retreating into the vogue
Where we're sucking the blood from the necks of guitars
Beg for the scraps of prose
That piled up behind the bar
Though we try and try and try
We get the melodies wrong
But we remember the words
We're parasites we are delicate
In the way we bring each other down
We were oh so close to the start when they finished us
Aim the mast at the ground
Aim the mast at the ground
And sail us to the belly of the whale
'Til death do we rock
We're so full of shit
'Til death do we rock
You keep buying it
The closed circuit of stimulus
That runs between fashion and guilt
Is winding tighter around the heart
Our orbits are collapsing upon themselves
But we stand in the traffic indifferent
To the grand histrionics of God unmoved <start> Computer man says it's the end of time
December st 
People buying up army surplus things
Afraid of what the new year will bring
I live back in the woods you see
YK don't mean a thing to me
I got a shotgun a rifle and a wheel drive
A country boy can survive
Country folks can survive
I can plow a field all day long
I can catch catfish from dusk till dawn
Make our own whiskey and our own smoke too
Ain't too many things these 'ol boys can't do 
We grow good 'ol tomatoes and homemade wine
And a country boy can survive
Country folks can survive
'Cause you can't starve us out
And you can't make us run
We'll survive the new millennium
We say grace and we say ma'am
If you ain't into that we don't give a damn
We came from the West Virginia coal mines
And the Rocky Mountains and the western skies
If the bank machines crash we'll be just fine
'Cause a country boy can survive
Country folks can survive
I had a good friend in New York City
Never called me by my name just Hillbilly
But he was killed by a man with a switchblade knife
For  dollars my friend lost his life
I'd like to spit some beech nuts in that dude's eye
And shoot him with my ol' 
Cause a country boy can survive
Country folks can survive
'Cause you can't starve us out
And you can't make us run
We'll survive the new millennium
We say grace and we say ma'am
If you ain't into that we don't give a damn
We're from North Carolina and South Alabam
And little towns all around this land
If the bank machines crash we'll be just fine
And a country boy can survive
Country folks can survive
A country boy can survive
Country folks can survive
Any year any time <start> Tell me how you like it rough
Love it when I pull your hair baby
I wanna see your clothes come off
But please keep on them heels babe
Don't worry if it get to loud 
Go ahead scream and shout baby
And if you wanna go all night
With you I'll be a nympho
No 
If it's alright 
No one to night 
So I hope you like when I
Take you from the bed to the bathroom floor
I'mma make you scream make you beg for more
We can have the neighbors at our door
And I can tell them we're not making love

I know you like it nice and slow 
Boo we can save that for round two baby
And if you wanna play that role
I'll be your superhero baby
Amazing how you get me off
No kissing no touching we're straight to it
There's plenty time for making love
Tonight I'll be your nympho

If it's alright 
No one to night 
So I hope you like when I
Take you from the bed to the bathroom floor
I'mma make you scream make you beg for more
We can have the neighbors at our door
And I can tell them we're not making love

Tonight I'm back in everything

Until I feel you're breaking down

I'll start it on the stairs take you to the couch
Kitchen table top I'mma break you off
Indeed giving you what you need when we
Take you from the bed to the bathroom floor
I'mma make you scream make you beg for more
We can have our neighbors at our door
And I can tell them we're not making love






 <start> Swarm 'round the hive sweet honey bee
Swarm to and fro just as ya please
You're always welcome with your queen
Everybody needs a little sanctuary
Everybody needs a little sanctuary
Some men will seek it in the church
Only to find it on the sea
Or where pay women walk the streets
All of them seeking sanctuary
All of them seeking sanctuary
All of them seeking sanctuary
I only hope I can provide
That which you truly gave to me
You never made me stand outside
You always offered sanctuary
You always offered sanctuary
You always offered sanctuary
You always offered sanctuary
You always offered sanctuary
You always offered sanctuary
You always offered sanctuary <start> Five glasses changed my mind
Seems like the ticking hands are taking their time
I guess I've been at home for longer than it takes
To unwind so slap me if I step out of line
Now in smaller spaces careless lust intoxicated
Away from prying eyes
And rabid smiles
And everything's shattering
My invitation was involuntary dilation
And now I can't recall your name
I think we've met before
It was last Christmas on our parents' accord
You were the young man in the costume
That was hard to ignore
And I was feeling hopelessly bored
Now your conversation's
Scholarships and occupations
You look so different than before
When... nevermind <start> Six AM just woke up drunk
There's a woman by my side
Who is she and where am I 
And why are my hands tied 
Well I don't even care I don't even care
As long as I had fun
Now I'm pissing alcohol
And my brain's welldone
I'm sick and tired of you
Being so sick and tired of
The way I live my life...
Raw
I want it
Raw
I need it
Raw
I like it
Raw
I want it
Raw
She said Let's go for breakfasthunting
So we went for a ride
Sunday morning the stores were closed
But she was open wide
She said Do you wanna play do you wanna play
I couldn't find reason good enough to say no
Before I knew I was lying there
And some parts began to grow
I'm sick and tired of you
Being so sick and tired of
The way I live my life...
Raw
I want it
Raw
I need it
Raw
I like it
Raw
I want it
Raw
I tried everything from crack to psychoanalysis
Even tried to shoot myself but I always somehow missed
I'm sick and tired of you
Being so sick and tired of
The way I live my life...
Raw
I want it
Raw
I need it
Raw <start> How Have You Been
by John Sebastian
Performed by Crosby Stills  Nash
on Nintendo White Knuckle Scorin' 

How have you been my darling children
While I have been away in the west
Though you are strangers I feel like I know you
By the way that you treat me and offer to feed me
And eagerly ask if I'll stay for a rest
Now sit yourselves down in a pile here before me
I wish I had presents for each of your smiles
But I have been travelling without much to carry
Just a broken guitar case with paint on the sides
A bag and a few signs to help me get rides
But here are some beads from the throat of a Princess
Who lived in the years around  BC
Divide them and wear them but make sure to share them
'Cause I want you to have them in hopes that you'll be
As lovely as the lady who gave them to me...
And here is a strange European guitar string
I found on the floor of a club in Marseilles
It's fat for the third string and skinny for the fourth string
But I kept it in hopes that I'd use it some day
It's funny how people just keep things that way
And here is a turtle from the Long Island Expressway
He says that his home has been covered with tar
So I gave him a ride on the back of my suitcase
And he says that he'd like to stay here in your yard
At long last his life won't be quite so hard
And how have you been my darling children
While I have been away in the west
Though you are strangers I feel like I know you
By the way that you treat me and offer to feed me
And eagerly ask if I'll stay for a rest
And how have you been my darling children <start> Told me baby
You were just too tired to try
There was nothing left for you to give
And no more tears to cry
I know she hurt you
But you know I've been hurt too
You just come to me
We'll see what a love can do
Told me baby
I was still too young to know
All the ways that love was going
To drag you down and just how low I'd go
In love and time between us
Makes no difference at all
You know you're as desperate to get back up
As I am not to fall
Oh baby I've been looking for a man like you
Oh darling after all we've been through
There's no one left to fool nothing left for us to do
Except me and you
Told me baby
To find somebody new
Do you really think that I'd come this far
Just to lose a man like you
You know you've got to take a chance
If only you will stay
And if you've got the time baby I've got the love
We might just find a way
We might just find a way yeah
We might just find a way yeah
We might just find a way ooh <start> 
Well how come when you talk to her
she's listening to the music
on the radio tonight
You can't keep her attention
'cause she's concentratin'
on a late night movie show allright.
I know you thought that you had it goin'
when she let you in through her front door.
But now you know it's getting so late
and she don't want you around here no more.
I could have told you before.
You should have known it right from the start
that the woman's in love
the woman's in love with someone.
And you know it's gonna break your heart.
You'd better leave her alone
the woman's in love with someone else.
But it ain't you.
I know that when she smiled
across the room at you tonight
you thought you had it made oh yeah.
But maybe you reminded her
of someone else
though you can never take his place oh no.
'Cause when you're feelin' so lonely
a little conversation can go a long way.
But that's as far as you're gonna get
'cause she's not the kind of woman to stray.
I could have told you before.
You should have known it right from the start
that the woman's in love
the woman's in love with someone.
And you know it's gonna break your heart.
You'd better leave her alone
the woman's in love with someone else.
The woman's in love with me.
The woman's in love with me
yeahyeah.
'Cause when you're feelin' so lonely
a little conversation can go a long way.
But that's as far as you're gonna get
'cause she's not the kind of woman to stray.
I could have told you before.

The woman's in love with me yeah. <start> Oh oh this train I'm riding this train
Don't you wanna ride

Oh get on get on 
Grab your ticket and your suitcase
Thunder's rolling down the tracks
You don't know where you're goin' now
But you know you won't be back
Darlin' if you're weary
Lay your head upon my chest
We'll take what we can carry
And we'll leave the rest
Big wheels rolling through fields
Where sunlight streams
Meet me in a land of hope and dreams
I will provide for you
And I'll stand by your side
You'll need a good companion
For this part of the ride
Leave behind your sorrows
Let this day be the last
Tomorrow there'll be sunshine
And all this darkness past
Big wheels roll through fields
Where sunlight streams
Meet me in a land of hope and dreams
This train carries saints and sinners
This train carries losers and winners
This train carries whores and gamblers
This train carries lost souls
I said this train dreams will not be thwarted
This train faith will be rewarded
This train hear the steel wheels singin'
This train bells of freedom ringin'
This train carries saints and sinners
This train carries losers and winners
This train carries whores and gamblers
This train carries lost souls
I said this train carries brokenhearted
This train thieves and sweet souls departed
This train carries fools and kings
This train all aboard
I said this train dreams will not be thwarted
This train faith will be rewarded
This train hear the steel wheels singin'
This train bells of freedom ringin'
Come on this train
People get ready
You don't need no ticket
All you got do is just get on board
On board this train
This train people get ready
You don't need no ticket 
You don't need no ticket you just get on board 
You just thank the Lord 
Come on this train  <start> I'm losing speed
Trying to keep up with you
I'm losing speed
Worrying about you
How long will it take
'Til I can have your heart to break
Red eye
I'm asking you
Your beautiful fear
Is the Holy Ghost town
Let's close in the road
We used to drive down
How long will it take
'Til I can have your heart to break
Red eye
I'm asking you
You know I hate the way
Your love don't stay
Red eye
I'm asking you
Your eyelids don't shut
But you don't see me here
When I need to be saved
The queen disappears
How long will it take
'Til I can have your heart to break
Red eye
I'm asking you
You know I hate the way
Your love don't stay
Red eye
Do you have to have to fly all night
Just to feel all right
Red eye
I'm asking you
I'm asking you <start> I coulda seen why some girls hide away
When I saw you were crying alone last Sunday
Pretty soon all the seeds will be sewn
I'm a lot like your best friend who wants to take you home
Inside those eyes I saw myself
And what we could be
You are soul is beautiful but
Do you feel something for me
Woulda been nice to drag me through hell
But who made you the commissioner parishion's angel
Pretty soon you will see what I want to do
Making movies to keep my guitars from changing blue
Inside those eyes I saw myself
And what we could be
You're oh so beautiful but
Do you feel something for me
Coulda seen your side
You woulda made a nice bride
I shoulda tried
Inside those eyes I saw myself
And what we could be
You're rich and beautiful but
Do you feel something for me
Inside those eyes I saw myself
And what we could be
You're so damn beautiful but... <start> Go swiftly
The flags and drums can hypnotize
When glory has faded the dream is worth more than the prize
A twisting turning flame
Of freedom burning bright
Knows all of the names
And all of the games of the yellow black and white
We gotta have faith
To work it out
Faith and hope
Without a doubt
Give us strength to make a start
Put a song in our hearts...
We're never gonna break down walls
And build a prison with the stone
'Cause you and I know what this is worth
We're gonna build heaven on earth
We're running in the wheels of fortune
Turning water into wine
We're gonna take love and make it shine
We're gonna find peace in our time...
Softly softly
When there is lightning in the sky
When rivers are rising and trouble rolls in on the tide
We'll keep on keeping on
'Til all the tears are dry
We'll weather the storm and welcome the dawn
Of tomorrow you and I...
We've gotta have faith...
And get it fast
Faith and hope...
And let it last
Give us strength...
To reach the stars put a song in our hearts.
At the sign... of the dove...
Is gonna shine... shine  shine
On a wing... and a prayer...
We'll be fine... fine  fine...
People People
Do you believe in what you see
Surrounded by fire and magic are you really free
It's heating Heating up
Along the avenue
We're raisin' the dust it's heaven or bust
We will see this dream come true
We're gonna have faith...
The road will be long
Now there's hope...
To carry us on
We'll have strength...
We'll never go wrong with this song in our hearts <start> She walks in and I'm suddenly a hero
I'm taken in my hopes begin to rise
Look at me can't you tell I'd be so
Thrilled to see the message in your eyes
You make it seem I'm so close to my dream
And then suddenly it's all there
Suddenly the wheels are in motion
And I I'm ready to sail any ocean
Suddenly I don't need the answers
'Cause I I'm ready to take all my chances with you
How can I feel you're all that matters
I'd rely on anything you say
I'll take care that no illusions shatter
If you dare to say what you should say
You make it seem I'm so close to my dream
And then suddenly it's all there
Suddenly the wheels are in motion
And I I'm ready to sail any ocean
Suddenly I don't need the answers
'Cause I I'm ready to take all my chances with you
Why do I feel so alive when you're near
There's no way any hurt can get thru
Longing to spend every moment of the day with you
Suddenly the wheels are in motion
And I I'm ready to sail any ocean
Suddenly I don't need the answers
'Cause I I'm ready to take all my chances with you <start> What have I done what have I got
Your life is really useless your life is really shot.
Gun toting losers beer swillin' hicks.

Life sucks but you're too blind to tell.
Don't you know I really hate it here and
I will always hate it.

I'd rather be anywhere but fucking here. <start> Sisters sisters
There were never such devoted sisters
Never had to a chaperon
No sir
I'm here to keep my eye on her
Caring sharing every little thing that we are wearing
When a certain gentle man arrived from Rome
She wore the dress and I stayed home
All kinds of weather we stick together
The same in the rain or sun
Two different faces but in tight places
We think and we act as one uh huh
Those who've seen us know that not a thing can come between us
Many men have tried to split us up but no one can
Lord help the mister that come between me and my sister
And Lord help the sister that come between me and my man
All kinds of weather we stick together
The same in the rain or sun
Two different faces but in tight places
We think and we act as one uh huh
Those who've seen us no that not a thing can come between us
Many men have tried to split is up but no one can
Lord help the mister that comes between me and my siter
And lord help the sister that comes between me and my man
Sisters sisters sisters sisters <start> Now I thought we'd come alive
And stop all this drunken driving
You were the one who wanted to storm those gates
And kill those prophets that couldn't relate
But still you're the one who wanted to save your soul
With all your bullshit rock and roll
But now she hides her eyes
Burns her house and hopes she dies
Never gettin' my hands dirty
Uhhuh uhhuh
It's not just for myself not just all for self no
I figured we'd move it on up move it on up yeah
Not just for myself not just all for self no
Now he put your hand in mine
Come daddy come show me a sign
Now what I do I do for youths
The white and the black and the browns and the blues
Now promise comes in two foot waves
The moving earth and diggin' the graves
Now he tried to justify it
But he'll feel better once he tries it
Never gettin' my hands dirty
Uhhuh uhhuh
It's not just for myself not just all for self no
I figured we'd move it on up move it on up yeah
Not just for myself not just all for self no

Faster than laser beams

People rushing endlessly
Sometimes I think it's just their way
Of capturing a better day
You keep rushing home baby
For your dose of reality
I'll hold out my hands to you
You do what you need to
Ohh whoa
I will comfort you 
Ohh whoa
I will comfort you 
An ocean of humanity
Some wash up along the street
It's hard to keep in stepping round
It's hard to keep that frame of mind
Trying to move with the sun
Gives the illusion that we're one
I'll be running next to you
We do what we need to
Ohh whoa
I will comfort you 
Ohh whoa
I will comfort you 
But when the moonlight washes over our bed
And the road slows
A lonely siren screeching 'round the bend
The cool air blows
Raising the hair on my skin
We come face to face
Try to let each other in
Ohh whoa
I will comfort you 
Ohh whoa
I will comfort you 
I will I will I will I will
I will I will I will I will
I will comfort you <start> She was a dirty dream cool and clean
With seduction dancing in her eyes
She turned around looked me up and down
She took me by surprise
I tried to run tried to hide
But my feet were made of clay
Looked in her eyes I was paralyzed
I just couldn't get away
She licked her lips they were bloody red
She had the heart of the living dead
She pushed me down on a burning bed
Thought I was in heaven but instead
She turned her head and she softly said
I'll bite your face off
I'll bite your face off
I'll bite your face off little man
I'll bite your face off you know that I can
She put the whip into cream
She was a sinners queen oh a delicious angel face
She'd invite you in c'mon and lick my skin
You'd sell your soul for another taste
She took my heart my resistance fled
I loved each lie that I was fed
She pushed me down on a burning bed
Thought I was in heaven but instead
She turned her head and she softly said
I'll bite your face off
I'll bite your face off
I'll bite your face off little man
I'll bite your face off you know that I can

Thought I was in heaven but instead

Hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of the storm
there's a golden sky
And the sweet silver song of the lark
Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed and blown
Walk on walk on with hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone <start> Well I'm goin' down this road feelin' bad

Where the world don't seem so damn modern
Where a good ole boy like me still has a chance .
Oh this is where I was born and this is where I'll die.
Yeah this is where I was born and this is where I will die.
It's all about the south Georgia Alabama Mississippi Louisiana Carolina.
Don't you wanna get down and dirty 'Cause Florida I'm thirsty.

From daddy's Don Williams to momma's Patsy Cline.

There was you
But my eyes couldnt see what I have
That there was you
With all the pain and tears wont go away
With this song are reaching for you to stay
Comparing morons with his intentions
I'm not enough
I miss the times you hate me
Coz it only shows that you love me
Bring back those nights I could see you again
I have the sun that's screaming
Coz without you there's no meaning
When will I see you again
As far the east and west did you forgive
And I'll be here help you forget
All I want is to mend a broken heart
That's part of you

You can tell what I'm thinking before I can even pretend
Yeah we've begun and we've been down time and again
And again and again and again and again and again
Sometimes it feels like I don't need your touch
Sometimes it's just too much
And I come tumbling down like a house of cards
Whenever you take your love away
And the sweet sweet sound of your voice
Is all it seems to take
Like a house of cards 
Yeah I've played games and I've been played before
I've been to the bottom and back and I know how it feels
Yeah we know it's bad but we still come back for more
And better than that I can tell and I try to believe
Sometimes it feels like I don't need your touch
Sometimes it's just too much
And I come tumbling down like a house of cards
Whenever you take your love away
And the sweet sweet sound of your voice
Is all it seems to take
I come tumbling down I come tumbling down
Like a house of cards
When I come down I come down hard
Oh and when I fall I fall so hard
Yeah we've begun and we've been down time and again
And again and again and again
And again and again and again and again and again and again
And I come tumbling down like a house of cards
Whenever you take your love away
And the sweet sweet sound of your voice
Is all it seems to take

Tengo cita en la librera parnaso
Qued con unas cuantas muchachas
Que trabajan en un night club
Quieren llevarme al barrio a bailar
Me van a ensear palo de mayo
Soy buen bailarn con unos tragos
Demasiado torpe si me paso
Su belleza les permite ser castigadoras
Yo no me pienso negar
Ellas sern las que dispongan
Y yo no me pienso negar
Si escucharan ms no seran ellas
Igual que sin dolor ya no hay blues
No s si hay alguien dentro de azotea
O como la marea vienen y van
Propongan lo que propongan
No me pienso negar
Yo tomar ellas traern la mota
Y yo no me pienso negar
Su belleza les permite ser castigadoras
Yo no me pienso negar
Ellas sern las que dispongan
Y yo no me pienso negar
Propongan lo que propongan
No me pienso negar
Yo fumar ellas traern la mota
Y yo no me pienso negar
Al palo de mayo
Palo de mayo
Al palo de mayo <start> Wish me luck
I'll take anything this world can throw me
I'll love it and leave it and
Kiss the world goodbye you see
I'll travel my journey
With a suicide pack
I'll be free
Hello goodbye the best of luck
I'm gone
Chorus
From the day I was born
I lived my live to the full
Tried everything once
Now I'm ready for more
Now I'm ready for more
I'll think of my live
The days turn from months to years
To nothing
I didn't think I'd have the guts
To go with it
I'll think of my friends
The people I hate and the people
I never got to meet
Hello goodbye the best of luck
I'm gone from
The day I was born
So good to see you
But now I'm movin' on
Been good to be here
But it's gone on too long
It's good to see you so good
To see the back of you
Where you ever misunderstood
Did anyone say you have to stay
Think of the happiness you bring
Think of the day you were born
Remember my family yeah
Keep my habits clean you see
I'll bless the beggar's dog
If god blesses the trees
Stay out of trouble you know
Keep the cream on the cake
Take no ones word for nothing
Thank you goodnight
Best of luck
I'm gone
From the day I was born
Chorus <start> One lonely night at this drivein

And now I know what a fool Ive been

She was to meet me

We had a date

A date at seven I dreamed of heaven
Now its way past eight
She just drove by with another guy

No wonder I cant help but cry

An empty cup a broken date
Now its way past eight
An empty cup a broken date
To think she never cared

Just tears me up

Now all I have to show for love
Is this empty cup
Just like this Coke my love is gone

Ive hit the bottom now Im all alone
 <start> Love your music and love the songs Only query don't get me wrong Is this really the way you appear Then again if you feel it's right Go ahead if it's what you like You got  you got  nothing to fear See that building with all it's floor See those people go out it's doors They don't know it but they're why you're here make a record that they all bum make it appealing to every mum You got  you got  nothing to fear So you've had a bad experience And you don't know who to trust well if you want me to represent you then in me you must trust I'm not promising you the earth I'll bow out if it doesn't work You got  you got  nothing to fear Solo You got  you got  nothing to fear Have to say when I heard your voice Wasn't sure if it was my choice Then I listened again and I could hear Don't ask why but I'm certain you will make it big and the day you do You got  you got  nothing to fear But suppose in the studio unhap
py with a take will you let do it again   Don't be worried about your songs I'll ook after them every one You got  you got  nothing to fear <start> When I hit rock bottom
And then keep going down
And I'm talking to the mirror
With no one else around.
When impossible to maybe
Is as far as I can see
I keep hanging in
'Til the world believes in me.
All this drama drags me down
And drives me insane
But nothing's gonna keep me out of the game.
Life is a show
Skydiving and about to let go.
Walking the wire with nothing below
Don't you know don't you know.
Cause life is a show
In every shade of the rainbow.
Were jumping through fire
Let's go life is a show.
I know you gotta dig deep
And prove it everyday
Some people leave you feeling
You stop and toss the wave.
I tried a game of anti
Would have gave it everything
But I never lost the reason why I sing.
Everything that knocks me down
Is making me strong
And standing on this stage is were I belong.
Life is a show
Skydiving and about to let go.
Walking the wire with nothing below
Don't you know don't you know.
Cause life is a show
In every shade of the rainbow.
Were jumping through fire
Let's go life is a show.
Verse 
Once you step in the light there's no turning back.
Once your living the life what more can you ask.
Keeping this feeling is all that you want.
Singing you heart out and giving it all that you got.
Life is a show
Skydiving and about to let go.
Walking the wire with nothing below
Don't you know don't you know.
Cause life is a show
In every shade of the rainbow.
Were jumping through fire
Let's go life is a show.
Skydiving and about to let go.
Walking the wire with nothing below
Don't you know don't you know.
Cause life is a show
In every shade of this rainbow.
Were jumping through fire

In fact all week long has been crazy living it lately
And I really cant complain because Im doing what I love
Well I guess there is one thing time away from her is tough
Just the thought of you can make me smile
And I wish that you were here right now
Every time gets harder than the last
Its going to be so damn good when I get back
But just for now I need some help
Give me a memory Ill fill it out
Chorus Give me one for the road and one for your love mm hmm
So I can feel you when I sleep along
Give me one to get by and one for when I cry
You pick me up and tell me that Ill be alright
Give me one give me one
You can kiss me and hug me
Give me one give me one
You can touch me and love me yeah
Today I couldve sworn I saw you lost
But it wasnt you and that pissed me off
Every pretty girl I see I think of you instantly
Oblivious to everything my friends think theres something wrong with me but no
They dont know
Just the thought of you can make me smile
And I wish that you were here right now
Every time gets harder than the last Its going to be so damn good when I get back
But just for now I need some help
Give me a memory Ill dream about
Chorus Give me one give me one
You can kiss me and love me
Give me one give me one
You can kiss me and love me yeah <start> Not too serious take that frown off your face
I'll get furious baby I'd like to see a change of looks
Gimme pleasure you're lookin' good when you smile
Say actress don't you want to do the things I like best
Face dancer magic eyes
That burn with passion and fake surprise
Every time you call the tune
You get your way just a little too soon
Aggressive mask on request
Sure to start another bad fight
On the surface tigress
But on the inside baby you're a lullaby
I'm gonna lose you
To some photographer
You'll be abused
You know he's bound to get your act uncovered
The game's brutal
They're low on scruples
But I'll be waitin'
I'll be here when your features are failin'
Face dancer magic eyes
That burn with passion and fake surprise
Every time you call the tune
You get your way just a little too soon
Aggressive mask on request
Sure to start another bad fight
On the surface tigress
But on the inside baby you're a lullaby <start> I'm walkin' through the summer nights
Jukebox playing low
Yesterday everything was goin' too fast
Today it's moving too slow
I got no place left to turn
I got nothing left to burn
Don't know if I saw you
If I would kiss you or kill you
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow
You left me standin' in the doorway cryin'
I got nothing to go back to now
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't
But not tonight and it won't be here
There are things that I could say but I don't
I know the mercy of God must be near
I've been ridin' the midnight train
I got ice water in my veins
I would be crazy if I took you back
It would go up against any rule
You left me standin' in the doorway cryin'
Sufferin' like a fool
When the last rays of daylight go down
Buddy you're older no more
I can hear church bells ringin' in the yard
I wonder who they're ringin' for
Oh I know I can't win
But my heart it just won't give in
I see nothin' to be gained by any explanation
There are no words that need to be said
You left me standin' in the doorway cryin'
Blues wrapped around my head <start> You and I used to meet the same
Wrapped together in cellophane
We can try to get away
Drift forever lost in
Space... 
Space... 
Space... 
Safe... 
You can try to change my day
Lock me up and you watch me fade
You and I can emulate
Drift together lost in
Space... 
Space... 
Safe... 
Safe... 
Decompress again 
Take control again
Connected once again
We're starting to descend
Space... 
Space... 
Safe... 
Safe... 
Space... 
Space... 
Safe... 
Safe...  <start> Don't understand
How I could be so blind
Something is changing
And I don't know why
Heaven knows how much I sacrifice

Now nothing in this world
Will ever change her mind
Freedom what she needs
She wants freedom
'cause she got dreams
In her heart it's time to go
A long way from home
Yes it's a long way from home
I still remember
Her standing there

The sun was shining
On her soft brown hair
Well all my life
Every tear I cried
I saw the future in her eyes
Now her heart says it's time to go
A long way from home
Freedom is what she needs
She wants freedom
'cause she's got dreams
And I hope she knows she's not alone
'cause it's a long way from home
It's a long way from home
I think about her and then I pray
That she'll be safe and warm

I get on my knees

Oh lord

Freedom is what she needs
She wants freedom
'cause she's got dreams
Give her freedom to believe
Her heart says it's time to go
A long way from home
Such a long way from home
It's a long way from home
Freedom

Freedom

Freedom

Freedom

Freedom

Freedom
Freedom freedom

Freedom


Freedom she wants freedom

Freedom she wants freedom . . . <start> Once again they scrape your carcass off the floor
From where it fell
And throw your sad ass out the door.
It's not the first time
But it just may be the worst time.
Luckily they know who you are.
And they know what you're about
But your free rides in this life are quickly running out.
All in all your life hasn't been that bad.
You succeeded in
Alienating every friend you've ever had
Who took you in
And put up with your drunken musings
Broken bones and egobruisings
Conspiracies accusations
And other late night revelations
We used to find so entertaining.
You still think that people like you more
The louder that you shout.
But we all find the novelty is running out.
Once again you put yourself up to the test
To see how much a human can ingest.
You should be in the book of Guinness.
It's not the first time
But it just may be the worst time.
Even though the number of your friends
And the benefit of the their doubt is running out.
It's all running out. <start> Instead of just calling ahead
You should be calling and making amends
So should I be playing nice
Or should you be ready to say youre sorry twice
Havent you heard a word Ive said
Thinkin that that Im givin you a green not red cos
Its so wrong its right
Nothings ever gonna change my mind
So come on and try
Do you really wanna lose a fight
You shouldnt be in my neighborhood 
I shouldve known youd be up to no good 
So where does it go from here
Leaving lipstick on your mirror
Your sweat tastes like my tears my tears
Whatchoo gonna do 
Whatchoo gonna say 
Hows this gonna be 
Do you really wanna play 
What the Hell was that Dont give me no crap <start> There are angels in your angles
There's a low moon caught in your tangles
There's a ticking at the sill
There's a purr of a pigeon to break the still of day
As on we go drowning
Down we go away
And darling we go adrowning
Down we go away
Away
There's a tough word on your crossword
There's a bed bug nipping a finger
There's a swallow there's a calm
Here's a hand to lay on your open palm today
As on we go drowning
Down we go away
And darling we go adrowning
Down we go away
Away <start> What does it take to get ya
To admit it
How much light
Till it shines on you yeah
How much did she betcha
You couldn't get it
What does it signify
When it lands on you
They will tell you you're a loser
They'll stone you in the streets
Makes you kinda wonder 'bout the people you meet yeah
There's a telegram they send ya
To tell you that you won
And that now your life is gonna
Suddenly be fun
It's a piece of empty paper
It's a piece of empty pie
It's a vision of illusion
It will surely pass you by
And I don't know what to tell ya
I haven't got a clue
I don't know why people do the things that they do no
What does it take to get ya
As confused as me
And how much information
Is gonna finally set you free
What does it take to get ya
To admit it
How much light
Shines on you yeah
How much light
Is gonna shine on you
How much light
Shines on you <start> Raise up the ghosts of the dead I won't die like them
Push past the point of raw emotion I will breathe
Exist with a broken spirit I will die complete
Ignore what the angels say enjoy that special place where the demons speak to me
I won't pick out the lining of my coffin yet unless I am sure that color satin is me
Better yet go with crushed velvet that way I'll be damn sure to enjoy eternity
My daily life writes the eulogy engraved on tombstone diaries
laid to rest with the passing of time
Seems to me that even love can die
And the rituals that fade away and the roses that cease to be laid
And to me it clearly appears that we're already one foot in a very shallow grave
I will love with passion
You live like you're dead
As each day dies are we living on to the next or passing on in the twilight <start> Mr. Jones knows The Stones
Rock 'n' roll is in his blood and in his bones
Shines his shoes kicks some ass
Counts the booze and laminates his pass
Does some wizz loves the biz
Your Eric Clapton's and your Nancy's and your Sids
Mr. Jones helped me understand
The worthless piece of lowlife that I am
Changed the rules took control
Bribing the ref and widening the goals
Mr. J's master plan
Fifty ways to patronize the fans
Life is cheap buy some now
Satisfy the sheep sacrifice the sacred cow
Born to boogie disco Tex
Mr. Groovy the God of groupie sex
Born to boogie knows the Stones
The only thing in common between me and Mr. Jones
Verbal gymnastics can't help you now
We've got fifty tons plastic
We're gonna laminate your house
Born to boogie disco Tex
Mr. Groovy the God of groupie sex
Born to boogie knows The Stones
The only thing in common between me and Mr. Jones
Mr. Jones super cool

I just wanna hear us sound like the song that's in my head something to look back on when we're gone . I swear I've heard that one before. Don't get in my way I know where I'm going. I'm on my way... Hell I know I've let you down. Don't act so surprised. I don't get the look in your eyes. I just want to know did you have a swinging time Something to look back on when we're gone  I swear I've heard that one before. Don't get in my way I know where I'm going. I'm on my way home. <start> Wendel brought it to life in his guest room bath tub
It was a special project for his H club
But it broke loose out in the middle of the night
And now it's eatin' flower children left and right
All the punks are gonna scream yippee
'Cause it's the thing that only eats hippies
First it cruised on out to Malibu
And ate a couple a' surfers who where too tough to chew
So it slithered it's way out to old Irvine
And ate a couple a' hippies and they tasted just fine
Now its got a sweet tooth for long hair
So Bob and Greg and Grant you should beware
Followin' the dead is how it gets it's kicks
Shame it wasn't born in 
Listens to the music and begins to sway
Dreamin' acid dreams of a hippie souffle
Hey hey hey
What do they taste like some kind a' treat
How many hippies can this monster eat
It ate stills and Nash before they could shout
And then it chewed on David Crosby but it spit him out
All the punks are gonna scream yippee
'Cause it's the thing that only eats hippies
There it goes
Gonna send 'em all to that big folk festival in the sky
So long suckers <start> Well since she put me down I've been out doin' in my head

Blood is burning

You gave me your word
We swore allegiance
Don't turn your back on who and what we are

Let it burn just let it burn
Cause they control
Feel the heat you'll feel the heat

You took an oath
Nowhere to run nowhere to hide

Don't turn your back on who and what we are <start> Goin' home late last night
Suddenly I got a fright
Yeah I looked through a window and surprised what I saw
A fairy with boots and dancin' with a dwarf
All right now
Yeah fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
Yeah I saw it I saw it I tell you no lies
Yeah Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it I saw it with my own two eyes
Oh all right now
Yeah fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
Yeah I saw it I saw it I tell you no lies
Yeah fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it I saw it with my own two eyes
All right now
So I went to the doctor
See what he could give me
He said Son son you've gone too far.
'Cause smokin' and trippin' is all that you do. <start> For now the kids are secular
But every road leads to a church
They grow them here
The virtuous
Mutinous by any means
Rebellious reformed then upright
It's cold in Adelaide tonight
These streets are bright
Hotel bound in the small bus
My first whiskey in two years plus
It can't mask the weird vibe
This Sunday night
Passing red cars head to light
Hey mom hey dad
Hey mom I'm rad
I'm coming clean and it's a mess
In cheap hotels they find their dreams
They caffeinate amphetamines
In naive green
Designer blue
In small black prints he's minor news <start> I used to be a man of dignity
A man of my word
You could depend on me
It hurts so fine
When you cross that line
The point of no return
I used to preach strict morality
An ethical man
Complete credibility
You try and try
Then Greed comes by
And you crash and burn
I need to believe in you
I need to have faith in you
I need to rely upon you
I need you...
The Maggots
The Maggots
The Maggots
The Maggots
We crawl through your weak pathetic brain
We thrive on your guilt
We thrive on your pain
Hideous crimes
For nickels and dimes
We corrupt your soul
I need to believe in you
I need to have faith in you
I need to rely upon you
I need you...
The Maggots
The Maggots
The Maggots... <start> Staring at the television
We cant believe what were seeing
It seems a fiction imaginary pain n a loud scream
But everything is true cause the reality too looks far
Dont suffer it is of no use
Dont cry cause Ill do it too
Dont suffer it is of no use
Dont cry cause Ill do it too
Reflect It could happen to you
I cant believe that the man is so fierce
Thousands of lights brightened up
In the dark night desperate souls walk on their broken past
There are only dead bodies tormented by falling flames from the sky
Many lives faded away
We stand still with hands in chains
Jungle so far is drawing on so quickly
Screams of pain spread to my ears
They make me deaf and impotent
Rage is growing in me
I see a suicide noose the best remedy
But that blood springing from their innocent veins wont be wasted
Im afraid cant be indifferent
I cant live anymore sources are going dry
I think that I cant paint my nails and uncover my face
Im not shaved Im only ashamed nobody knows Im living
While Im walking on these streets I hold my head down
Hands in chains weve got hands in chains
Hands in chains weve got hands in chains
Hands in chains weve got hands in chains
Hands in chains hands in chains <start> Starting the car I turn off the E brake.
A three point turn and I'm driving.
Hands are at  and .
Two eyes a head blocking out two minor problems.
A faulty fuel gauge.
Idles but not well.
I'm squinting both my eyes.
Daydreaming doubtless drew pictures of perfect life my gaze from the truth.
Signal mirror over the shoulder and carefully enter the turn lane.
Hands are at  and .
Two eyes a head in the clouds as the wreck approaches.
Obstructed signs on my shoulder assist me in getting nowhere.
Wish I could blame them for the crash but I oughtta blame the driver.
He was squinting both his eyes.
Daydreaming doubtless drew pictures of perfect life his gaze from the truth.
Can you drive me to a good view
I've no sense of direction.
But something tells me you can help. <start> Are you strong enough
Can we make the cut
Can we cross the finish line
Make it out in time
Can we pass the bar
Can we make the grade
Can we make it on our own
Make it all alone
Can we pull it off
Can we save the day
When we start to recognize
And start to realize.
We can do anything
We can be anyone
Just close your eyes and try
To see.
We can do anything
We can be anyone

La la la la la la <start> The mother of the nation has gone she has hobbled off to her uncertain fate having only a tycoon's salary given to her to fund the purchase of that monkeyshitbrown hair rinse we know so well. They act like nothing ever happened but it did. It's too latetoo late for the thousands driven to mental illness premature old age and suicide by the forcefeeding to them of a daily diet of despair and the doctrine of their own obsolescence. Too late for the thousands of teenagers who grew up illiterate but unaccountably proud that their nation spent the money it could have been spent on educating them to buy gunsguns which this country is too feeble and unimportant to need to use.
It's too late to stop the rota rot she denied existed and which many thus forgot which continued to accelerate and and now will not be stopped until all this fucking pretense is dropped.

Waiting for the wolves

I hear them scratching
The wood it splinters
Into slivers easily
I hear them scratching
I hear them clawing
I fear they will not be kept
Much longer from the door

There's risk in any life you'll make
Just give more than you take
Just don't forget yourself dear
All you'll need is right here
Just be still you'll know
You'll know
So much will change and come undone
It's a season you can't outrun
Embrace the things you fear the most
And you'll beat them into ghosts
And don't forget yourself dear
All you'll need is right here
Just be still you'll know
You'll know
Trust yourself and follow love
And there will always be enough
The good and bad will surely come
But if you're happy then you've won
Just don't forget yourself dear
All you'll need is right here
Just be still you'll know
You'll know you'll know
You'll know <start> Hum drum days
And a hum drum ways
Hey kids let me tell you how I met your mom
We were dancin' and romancin' at the senior Prom
It was no infatuation
But a gradual graduation
From a boy to a man
Let me tell you while I can
The soda pop came free
Hey sis one kiss and I was heaven bound
Now who would have guessed Milton's paradise lost could be found
But in the eyes of the Dean his daughter
Was doin' what she shouldn'a oughta
But a man's gotta do
What a man's gotta do
The consequence should be
Church bells three swells
The Dean his daughter and me
They were dating in the park
They were smooching in the dark
Of a doorway for two
She whispered I love you
Ooh you know I never felt this way before
Ooh you know the elevator in my heart
Has gone awol awol awol awol
And then I kissed her
And when I kissed her
It's a wonderful world
When you're rolling in kisses
Now the paint is peeling

Now and when the chips are down

Now you kinda lose all feeling

Now your head goes round and round

Round and round and round and round and round
I'm throwing myself off this train
Hum drum days
And a hum drum ways
Hum drum days he's got
Hum drum ways oh boy
Hey you know I'm really earning now
My ship came in with a cargo of dollars
My name's lit up on the prow
It's a wonderful world
When you're rolling in dollars
Now <start> Something's calling my sunshine to the store
He thinks he'll get what he needs there
Sirens hide under each crack and wicked scar
They even made him a superstar
Someday you will wear a noble crown
And only you'll need to feel it
We're not letting this humble ship go down
We just need to steer it
And I burn it I keep repeating it
My prayer
Don't give in out there
Holding fast to my jungle conqueror
Lucky hand don't desert me now
If you ever need a parachute
You can fall free with me baby
And I burn it I keep repeating it
My prayer
Don't give in out there <start> come along and walk with me
we'll see where your life could lead
city streets of mystery are calling you and me
scream until your voice is sore
and kick down those unknown doors
cause it knows that we're at home we're at home
now come along and walk with me
we'll see where your life could lead
city streets that never sleep are waiting you and me
leave everything to chance instead of slam dance with circumstance
cause it knows that we're at home we're at home
in darkest corners of the world in darkest corners of the world
we're at home
WALK WITH ME
at home we're at home
in darkest corners of the world in darkest corners of the world
we're at home
in darkest corners of the world in darkest corners of the world
we're at home <start> Day by day they drink and dream
Old men staring out to sea
From the island living on the island
And down in the harbor it's a show
Watching all the people as they come and go
On the island living on the island
And up in the mountains they're alright
Tasting the first of the summer wine
On the island living on the island
I want to feel that sunshine in my heart
And let it blow my worries away
I want to spend a night in the ocean with her
That little lady lover who's in love with me
Prettiest little lady that I've ever seen
On the island living on the island
Ooh and when I finally sail away
I know for sure I'll be back someday
On the island living on the island
On the island living on the island
I want to feel that sunshine on my back
On the island living on the island
On the island we'll be living on the island
I want to feel that wind blow in my hair
Living on the island <start> SO YOU LIKE TO SING LIKE YOU KNOW EVERYTHING

YET YOU SAY YOUE DEFYING  NOW I KNOW THAT YOUE LYING <start> I hope you choke on my fucking heartbeat and drown in my blue blood.
The lonely walks bring out the lonely eyes.
The hunger dies because of the lies.
My stomach asks for something you can't give
something you can't feed me anymore.
I bet we believed nothing could change us.
Now our limbs have turned into shovels that even out the dirt.
I just like to think out loud.
My ears are tired and mouth is sore
from the life that you can't handle anymore.
If I could give you just one night I would make it last two seconds.
You make me feel so alive but that same love won't let me survive.
So come one destroy me.
You say you eat hearts for breakfast
better cook up mine for it's the most important meal you will ever have.
Enjoy tonight because tomorrow
I will force this straw deep into your throat
and take back what once was mine.
I just finished chapter one of it's not you it's me. <start> I'm not gonna sleep tonight
Till the morning fills the sky
No one's getting left behind this is our time
This is our time
We're gonna live this night yeah
Live it like it's our last night
'Cause nobody cares
If there's no tomorrow
I'm not thinking 'bout the future 
It's somewhere out there
We're all busy being human
We remember
Hearts spinning all around me 
Now they're surrounding me
This is how we get connected
Running out the shadows into light
We're gonna live this night yeah
Live it like it's our last night
'Cause nobody cares
If there's no tomorrow
We're gonna love this night yeah
Loving like it's our last night
Stars up in the air yeah
It's our last night in the city
I've been traveling around now

Always moving to a new town
No time to put the roofs down
We can't stop believing 
Now we believe in you
'Cause when you're standing in the spotlights
The only thing that matters is tonight
We're gonna live this night yeah
Live it like it's our last night
'Cause nobody cares
If there's no tomorrow
We're gonna love this night yeah
Loving like it's our last night
Stars up in the air yeah
It's our last night in the city

Maw maw miama glory Hallelujah
The sun burns a hole through the  AM haze
Turns up the volume and shows off its rays
Another Dodgerblue sky is crowning L.A.
The City of Angels is rushed every day
That lucky old sun smiles on me
Wanna slide down the mountain to the dancin' sea
I'm rockin' to the morning beat
It's risin' from star studded concrete
This city has my favorite soundtrack
It makes you wanna move even though it's laid back
Take it in stride it'll kick start your feet
When you're tuned in to the morning beat
Driving through the maze of the Hollywood Hills
Headed to the ocean for a view that would kill
Watching from the Wheel in Santa Monica Pier
A million diamonds floating on heavenly tiers
The gentle wind won't make a sound
Even though it's forcing the waves to crown
Maw maw miama glory Hallelujah
Maw maw miama glory Hallelujah
Hear those guitars gently strummin'
Hear the voices softly hummin'
It's hard to feel down living in this town
But you're so far away
It's a long long way from January
All the way to December
Even when the sun and I cannot sleep
There's an unspoken promise that we keep
We'll party all night into another day
And keep the golden glow of L.A.
Even when we are deep in sleep
I'm listenin' for the rhythm of the morning beat
I listen for the mornin' beat
I listen for the mornin' beat
Maw maw miama glory Hallelujah
Maw maw miama glory Hallelujah <start> I fell asleep on the couch last night woke up with the tv on.
There was a woman in tight cotton exercise shorts
And a big plastic machine she was climbing on.
She said the abacycle guarantees ten inches off your waist
And  pounds in just  minutes a day.
I went to bed knowing the revolution had been postponed
And everything was ok.
You can buy it you can try it go right ahead.
But don't be fooled folks there's only one.
I forget the guy's name but I know somebody must have said
Sell it and they will come boys sell it and they will come.
I switched the channels and there was evel knievel I thought that he was
Dead.
I found myself sitting there quietly hanging on every word he said.
now folks the stimulator removes all pain from your life.
And the best day of your life will be when you try this little thing out.
The camera moved in as he said now let me tell you ladies and gentlemen
Pain is something old evel knows a little about
You can buy it you can try it that's what I said.
But don't be fooled folks there's only one.
I forget that guy's name but I know somebody must have said
Sell it and they will come boys sell it and they will come.
And a fellow comes on shouting free haircuts for life
Somehow you cut your hair with a vacuum cleaner.
And then I switched the channels and there was dionne warwick communing
With her psychic friends.
I watched for hours taking warmth comfort
And pleasure in the things that I despise.
Touched by how much they needed me and that gleeful desperation in their
Eyes.
You can buy it you can try it it'll help you in bed.
But don't be fooled folks there's only one.
I forget that guy's name but I know somebody said
Sell it and they will come boys sell it and they will come.
So dionne cher and all my latenight friends I drink to your health.
And tony little america's personal trainer please kill yourself.
Now I've sold a few things myself in my time and by the way folks
There's some tshirts on your way outside.
Well last night I dreamed of lipstick and tight little cotton shorts
harder faster she breathed.
one two three four five
Ride sally ride girl ride sally ride.
You can buy it you can try it it'll help you in bed.
But don't be fooled folks there's only one.
I forget that guy's name but somebody said
Sell it and they will come boys sell it and they will come. <start> See the devil on the doorstep now 
Telling everybody oh just how to live their lives
Sliding down the information highway
Buying in just like a bunch of fools
Time is ticking and we can't go back 
What about the world today
What about the place that we call home
We've never been so many
And we've never been so alone
You keep watching from your picket fence
You keep talking but it makes no sense
You say we're not responsible
But we are we are
You wash your handsyou come come out clean
But fail to recognize the enemy's within
You say we're not responsible
But we are we are we are
One step forward making two steps back 
Riding piggy on the bad boys back for life
Lining up for the grand illusion
No answers for no questions asked
Lining up for the execution
Without knowing why
You keep watching from your picket fence
You keep talking but it makes no sense
You say we're not responsible
But we are we are
You wash your hands and come out clean
But fail to recognize the enemy's within
You say we're not responsible
But we are we are we are
It's all about power
By taking control
Breaking the will
And raping the soul
They suck us dry till there's nothing left
My oh my my oh my
What about the world today
What about the place that we call home
We' ve never been so many
And we've never been so alone
So alone

My aggression is where you stake your claim
Why I question this curve on which you grade
My conception a joke or latest craze
I try to get away and yet I stick around
So fall and crawl away and brush away loose ground
My intention and I arrive at eight
Lie and dream some surprise you guys I'm late
All right correction forgetting something wait
I try to get away and yet I stick around
So fall and crawl away and brush away loose ground
I try to get away and yet I stick around
So fall and crawl away and brush away loose ground
Yeah brush away loose ground
Yeah brush away <start> Somber sister
This is a strange and bitter fruit
Because you taught me to sing
And the rhythm in my heart
And the rhythm in my feet is 
Why are the rainbows
Stolen from the sky
And locked up in boxes
Yellow black red and white
Like birds in their cages
Beating their wings on the bars
And there's a song that they're singing
It's a word in the world
It's a word in their hearts
A part hate
I heard a man say
Tear apart hate
And I saw hope in his face
A part hate
Where the color of love
Slips away
Why are the children
Carrying guns not books
Drug dealing not learning
The golden rule
And the idea of freedom
Not just the same
Castle in the sky
Haunted by whitesheeted ghouls
Filled with hate me
And hate you
And proud of it too
A part hate
Heard a woman saying
Tear apart hate
And I saw hope in her face
A part hate
Where the color of love
Slips away
Why are the people
Running down the block
Rock throwing not knowing
What else to do
But I'm just a spectator
And I can never know the pain
But when I hear
That whip cracking
I cry out tears of anger
I cry out tears of shame
A part hate
I heard myself say
Tear apart hate
And I saw hope in my face
A part hate
Where the color of love
Slips away...
Tear apart hate tear apart hate
Tear apart hate tear apart hate
Tear apart hate tear apart hate... <start> Millers made the American way
Born and brewed in the USA

The American Way

The American Way
The American Way
The American Way <start> I have often walked down this street before
But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before
All at once am I several stories high
Knowing I'm on the street where you live
Are there lilac trees in the heart of town
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town
Does enchantment pour out of every door
No it's just on the street where you live
And oh the towering feeling just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling that any second you may suddenly appear
People stop and stare they don't bother me
For there's nowhere else on earth that I would rather be
Let the time go by I won't care if I
Can be here on the street where you live <start> How fast can I run
How far can I go
These are the questions
The young want to know
I met her in Brooklyn
She was coming from a place
I said where are you going to
She said where have you been
'cause I'm trapped in here
Set me free
I know your world let me see
Take me down that last open road
Take me down that last open road
Take me down that last open road
I know there is so much past
this place
I see it smile on your jagged
ragged face
Something tells me
something strong
There's a world I've heard of
So before it's gone
Take me down that last open road
Take me down that last open road <start> I am so seasick of being out to sea
It's got to be the worst thing
That's ever happened to me
But I've got my free pass
My skeleton key
I can open every door
That stands in front of me
You are so crazy
Should be under lock and key
You've got to be the worst thing
That's ever happened to me
But I don't get angry
Got my skeleton key
I can open every door
That stands in front of me
Okay I'm seasick
I'm floating all around the sea
Monkey bars gone too far
Got my skeleton key
Got my skeleton key
You are so crazy
Should be under lock and key
You've got to be the worst thing
That's ever had to be
I don't get angry
Got my skeleton key
I can open every door
That stands in front of me
Okay I'm seasick
I'm floating all around the sea
Monkey bars gone too far
Got my skeleton key
Got my skeleton key <start> Stone the world is stone
It's no trick of the light
It's hard on the soul
Stone the world is stone
Cold to the touch
And hard on the soul
In the gray of the streets
In the neon unknown
I look for a sign
That I'm not on my own
That I'm not here alone
As the still of the night
And the choke of the air
And the winner's delight
And the loser's despair
Closes in left and right
I would love not to care
Stone the world is stone
from a faraway look
Without stars in my eyes
Through the halls of the rich
And the flats of the poor
Wherever I go
There's no warmth anymore
There's no love anymore
So I turn on my heels
I'm declining the fall
I've had all I can take
With my back to the wall
Tell the world I'm not in
I'm not taking the call
Stone the world is stone
But I saw it once
With the stars in my eyes
When each color rang out
In a thunderous chrome
It's no trick of the light
I can't find my way home
In a world of stone <start> I got a room where I can breathe
I got a view no one else can see
Everybody here knows just what's right for me
Don't have to worry the Doctor's always in
I'm never lonely I'm here with all my friends
Chorus
In Chattahoochee I'm not crazy
Chattahoochee I'm just lazy
Chattahoochee Found my home
In Chattahoochee.
Out on the outside they sweat to pay the rent
While we play cards they say we ain't got no sense
They think they have a good time
Blowin' somethin' up their nose
Their corporate ladder can kill you it's so high
While it's a party here on the other side
Chorus
Who's to say who's crazy It's easy to see
All you gotta do is turn on your T.V.
All the people on the outside tryin' to be someone else
I'm havin' fun here just bein' myself in Chattahoochee.
They brought me here and saidYou're so dangerous to yourself
But I ain't the one here 'bout to blow us all to hell
Just here to have a good time let me know how it goes
Don't have to worry the Doctor's always in
I'd rather be here with all of my friends. <start> It's raining again in Vancouver I haven't seen the sun in seven days
I'm sitting here in Kitsilano waiting for a chance to play
I heard your name at a party two years after you said goodbye
I looked around the room to see you but I couldn't find your eyes
The mountains are high and the praries are wide
Some things get lost along the side
But I remember you
in all those places you once knew
I remember everything about you
It's freezing again in Winnipeg the wind's blowing straight out of hell
I thought I'd write you this postcard and wish your Christmas well
You know this life just keeps me laughing and here's the funniest part
The one thing that kept us together is finally keeping us apart
And it breaks my heart
The mountains are high and the praries are wide
I could see it reflected in your eyes
But I remember you
and all the things you used to do
I remember everything about you
It stinks again in Toronto can't see the top of the CN Tower
I'm broke and bored and lonely as hell and every beer tastes sour
But I wouldn't change one single thing and you knew that's the way it would be
So if you're at the Track tonight have a drink on me
Maybe make it three
The mountains are high and the praries are wide
The price is never worth the ride
But I remember you
just like it was all brand new
I remember everything about you
The mountains are high and the praries are wide
If life's a bitch it's time to die
But I remember you
just like it was all brand new
Yeah I remember everything
Every single stupid thing
I remember everything about you <start> Cuando corro contra vos

Para qu trabajar

The mountain is high the valley is low
And you're confused on which way to go
So I've come here to give you a hand
And lead you into the promised land
So come on and take a free ride

Come on and sit by my side
Come on and take a free ride
All over the country I've seen it the same
Nobody's winning at this kind of game
We've gotta do better it's time to begin
You know all the answers must come from within
So come on and take a free ride

Come on and sit here by my side
Come on and take a free ride
Yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh
Ah ah come on and take a free ride
Come on and take a free ride yeh yeh yeh yeh

Come on and take a free ride yeh yeh yeh yeh

The mountain is high the valley is low
And you're confused on which way to go so
Come on and take a free ride free ride <start> Downtown where no angels are found
We got our own underground now let me show you 'round.
Welcome yeah sinners and saints
Come see the king in restraints the queen with his crown.
Pure cry as we pass 'em all by
And you can look in our eyes and see no signs of light.
Hang 'em high on the street lights tonight
And there's no losing the fight
We tie our nooses tight.
Chorus
You can dance with the devil but you must wait your turn.
He'll bring you to his level so you can feel the burn
Get down pass the bottle around
Pray to the lord you don't drown and we can show you how.
Sluts twist through the smoke and the mist
So get your hand off your dick and I can show you how
Hell bent none of us heaven sent
Around the fire we chant so just walk on by.
Hold tight to your daughters tonight
Cause you know I'll fuck 'em right you know I damn well might.
Chorus
You can dance with the devil but you must wait your turn.
Down south all the rebels are standing proud and firm.
Romance tried to change the man I am
And I will be made pure of this I'm sure.
Chorus x
You can dance with the devil but you must wait your turn.
Down south all the rebels are standing proud and firm. <start> We walked in sat alone in a corner and faced the wall
Hiding behind the fear and shame
We talked but I just listened
She was sorry for it all
And that's how I found out my name
So I said
Why can't we talk it over
It doesn't have to end this way
Don't you think I should have a say
Can't we just talk it over
I must not pay for your mistakes
Let's grab our things and leave this place
Let's get out of here
It's not that I blame you for the human that you are
Just for the faith that you don't have
And I know you told me a thousand times before
That it's the best thing for the both of us right now
But I say
Can't we just talk it over
Why does it have to end this way
It just seems I should have a say
Can't we just talk it over
Don't make me pay for your mistakes
Let's grab our things and leave this place
Let's get out of here
Let's get out of here
What are we doing here
Cause I just question your intentions and your reasons for it all
And shouldn't someone else be here with us or have you done this before
And pardon me for sound so insensitive to your feelings but I
I got feelings of my own and you're about to hurt them
So why can't we talk this over
There must be something I can say
That just might make you change your mind
And after we talk things over
You'll see that we are not alone
Let's grab our things and blow this place
Let's get out of here <start> Instru <start> I was made from reels left out of the feature
so if you like bad scenes im you creature
Enter these embarissing monents tantrums and unclear omens
Arrange the things i marry dress up what i cant bury
Guilty pops in a jumble of shortwaves craking jokes trying to appear brave
I should know by now where the waves the waves are highest
where the house of stone falls down and your reasons to go on grow quiet
this is where the answere will be found
This city was made for taxies not sensitive types like you and me
They offered you a sack full of dimonds headlights hand shakes even triumphs
Waves move while water stands still its beautiful say what you will
youll ride on the back of the train writing down notes in the book of hard rain
you should know by now where the waves the waves are highest
where the house of stone falls down and your reasons to go on grow quiet
this is where the answere will be found
where the waves the waves are highest
where the house of stone falls down and your reasons to go on grow quiet
this is where the answere will be found 
where the waves the waves are highest
where the house of stone falls down and your reasons to go on grow quiet
this is where the answere will be found <start> Oh Daddy
You know you make me cry
How can you love me
I don't understand why
Oh Daddy
If I can make you see
If there's been a fool around
It's got to be me
Yes it's got to be me
Oh Daddy
You soothe me with your smile
You're letting me know
You're the best thing in my life
Oh Daddy
If I could make you see
If there's been a fool around
It's got to be me
Yes it's got to me
Why are you right when I'm so wrong
I'm so weak but you're so strong
Everything you do is just alright
And I can't walk away from you
Baby if I tried
Why are you right when I'm so wrong
I'm so weak but you're so strong
Everything you do is just alright
And I can't walk away from you
Baby if I tried
Oh Daddy
You soothe me with your smile
You're letting me know
You're the best thing in my life
Oh Daddy
If I could make you see
If there's been a fool around
It's got to be me
Yes it's got to me
Yes it's got to me
Yes it's got to me <start> Energy from every pore
Make what you will
Are you with or without
The force cannot be blamed
Just the hunger or greed
Supplying the ugly drive
Dirty water no profit to supply
That round travelled far too long
In every direction you turn touch fire and you burn
Earn self recognition over all the preoccupying nonsense
I plead my inner sense savour this aroma of a new experience
High intelligence bound for the underground we burrow deep down
I originate like the world individual visual visionary I vary
And all others see my eye view so multiply through the big bad city
With a human emotion running wild not fit for the child of all ages
Accelerate speed of life moving closer to the centre enter at ya own
If ya will still the hustling bustling busy bee hive is alive
And kicking I'm picking the moment I gotta get away from this
Monotonous call the capital L loving every minute that I'm in it. <start> i bought me a '
i just got back from heavens gate

i didn't think she'd get far
but now shes a fuckin' movie star

and be my turtle dove

cos he's courting i'm courtin' courtney courtney courtney <start> She's got cigarette on each arm
She's got the lilywhite cavity crazes
She's got a carburetor tied to the moon
Pink eyes looking to the food of the ages
She's alone in the new pollution
She's alone in the new pollution
She's got a hand on a wheel of pain
She can talk to the mangling strangers
She can sleep in a fiery bog
Throwing troubles to the dying embers
She's alone in the new pollution
She's alone in the new pollution
She's alone in the new pollution
She's alone in the new pollution
She's got a paradise camouflage
Like a whipcrack sending me shivers
She's a boat through a stripmine ocean
Riding low on the drunken rivers
She's alone in the new pollution
She's alone in the new pollution <start> Trapped in a prism in a prism of light
Alone in the darkness darkness of white
We fell in love alone on a stage
In the reflective age
Entre la nuit la nuit et l'aurore
Entre les royaumes des vivants et des morts
If this is heaven
I don't know what it's for
If I can't find you there
I don't care
I thought I found a way to enter
It's just a reflektor 
I thought I found the connector
It's just a reflektor 
Now the signals we send are deflected again
We're still connected but are we even friends
We fell in love when I was nineteen
And I was staring at a screen
Entre la nuit la nuit et l'aurore
Entre les voyants les vivants et les morts
If this is heaven
I need something more
Just a place to be alone
'Cause you're my home
I thought I found a way to enter
It's just a reflektor 
I thought I found the connector
It's just a reflektor  Just a reflektor
It's just a reflektor 
It's just a reflektor 
It's just a reflektor 
reflektor 
 just a reflektor
 just a reflektor 




Just a reflection of a reflection
Of a reflection of a reflection of a reflection
Will I see you on the other side 
We all got things to hide 
It's just a reflection of a reflection
Of a reflection of a reflection of a reflection
Will I see you on the other side 
We all got things to hide 
Alright let's go back
Our song escapes on little silver discs
Our love is plastic we'll break it to bits
I want to break free but will they break me
Down down down don't mess around
I thought I found a way to enter
It's just a reflektor 
I thought I found the connector
It's just a reflektor 
It's just a reflektor
It's just a reflektor 
It's just a reflektor 
It's just a reflektor 
Thought you would bring me to the resurrector
Turns out it was just a reflektor 
Thought you would bring to me the resurrector
Turns out it was just a reflektor 
Thought you would bring to me the resurrector
Turns out you were just a reflektor
It's just a reflektor 
 Just a reflektor
Just a reflektor
Just a reflektor
Just a reflektor
Will I see you on the other side
It's just a reflektor
Will I see you on the other side 
We all got things to hide 
Just a reflektor
Will I see you on the other side <start> You're outta line you're always fucking with my mind
You always waste my fucking time
But now that shit's done
You take your time you always tell me to hurry up
I plainly just don't give a fuck
you're stuck in the mud
Let's take it back to where it was before
I want to be a whore
You push me down and I get up off the ground
You really get around you're falling down
Don't you know you're fucking falling down
Falling down
You want to know just how far that I will go just rip me up
And you will know it's now all that far <start> Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now
Right now
Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now
Right now
Do you believe in heaven in above
Do you believe in love
Don't tell a lie
Don't be false or untrue
It all comes back to you
Open fire on my burning heart
I've never been lucky in love
My defences are down
A kiss or a frown
I can't survive on my own
If a girl walks in
And carves her name in my heart
I'll turn and run away
Everyday we've all been lead astray
It's hard to be lucky in love
It gets in your eyes
It's making you cry
Don't know what to do
Don't know what to do
Looking for love
Calling heaven above
Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now
Right now
Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now
Right now
Empty dreams can only disappoint
In a room behind your smile
But don't give up
Don't give up
You can be lucky in love
It gets in your eyes
It's making you cry
Don't know what to do
Don't know what to do
Looking for love
Calling heaven above
Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now
Right now
Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now
Right now
Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now
Right now
Right now <start> You must leave now take what you need you think will last
But whatever you wish to keep you better grab it fast
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun
Look out the saints are comin' through
And it's all over now baby blue
The highway is for gamblers better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The emptyhanded painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
This sky too is folding under you
And it's all over now baby blue
All your seasick sailors they are rowing home
All your reindeer armies are all going home
The lover who just walked out your door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor
The carpet too is moving under you
And it's all over now baby blue
Leave your stepping stones behind something calls for you
Forget the dead you've left they will not follow you
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore
Strike another match go start anew
And it's all over now baby blue <start> Ive fallen lower than the depths of misery
I wallow in the sorrow of my own afflictions
Resentment my only release
Lost in a corridor of trees and all while the world is at sleep
An abundance of atrocities through a cascade of my broken dreams
Now hear my soliloquy its a sombre tale of my dismay
Of how the last tear was cried for romance
Shall the flowers bloom when the earth collides with the sun
And all the fruits of once barren land flourish with splendor
Lost in a corridor of trees and all while the world is at sleep
An abundance of atrocities through a cascade of my broken dreams
Now hear my soliloquy its a sombre tale of my dismay
Of how the last tear was cried for romance <start>  <start> Verse 
I wrote these words to tell you
All the things I should've said so long ago so long ago
Know that I am grateful
I will not forget or let your memory go no I won't
I waited way too long
Way too long
I know this life's a mystery
We lose the things we never can replace no
So many things we keep inside
Are never said until it's much too late
So I'm giving you this song
Chorus
For the ones who sacrifice it all

Who took a stand so we would never fall

You will always be a hero

So you will be remembered 
You will be remembered 
Verse 
I know you've suffered way too much
I know you gave your all for us to be oh I see
I know how much you've sacrificed
And all of this you did so selflessly oh
So I'm giving you this song
I'm giving you this song
Chorus
For the ones who sacrifice it all

Who took a stand so we would never fall

You will always be a hero

Bridge
You'll be remembered you're still alive
Your memory will survive
And in the end all your sacrifice
It made a difference this time oh
 So I'm giving you this song
 And I'm giving you this song
Chorus
For the ones who sacrifice it all

Who took a stand so we would never fall

You will always be a hero

 Oh
 Oh
Oh oh
Did You Know <start> Near the dawn she crept in
Sittin' on the edge of a bed made up to look like it'd been slept in
And it was dark where I was lying
But I could see her face
It looked like she'd been crying
And it's a Long Long Journey Home
I drink my coffee by the door
Watch an old man on the street I think i've seen him before
Because he's out there every week
Goin' through my trash
He knows me but we never speak
It's a Long Long Journey Home
It's a Long Long Time to feel Alone
Forgiveness and favor earned
Traveling on lessons learned
We are all alone in this together
as far as i'm concerned...
It's a Long Long Journey Home
It's a Long Long time to feel alone
I have been rejected
By the very one I carefully selected
so I know what you mean
when you say you stumble on the way to the guillotine
It's a Long Long Journey Home
It's a Long Long time to feel alone
It's a Long Long Long...
Journey Home <start> I been around the world
I seen a lot of things
That make your chicken curl
You're squeezing like boys and teasing like girls
Confusing like boys and girls
Plan an exit route parachute rubber suit
Are you ready for a little swim
There's regular queen size flip it on the
Bside solid gold
Oh my God what's this
I saw the bedroom toys
Now I'm stalling
I can't believe my eyes
I saw the bedroom toys
Now I'm crawling
I learn to improvise
Checking out the five star atmosphere
You want some expertise
If you got treasure I'll pay you for the pleasure
It'll bring you to your knees
Silicone romance what's your name fancypants
Got your eye on the employees
Forget about the reeling talk about the feeling
Solid Gold
You want it...
You got it...
Now what you gonna do with it
Now you washed up beat smashing grab no receipt takes the platinum off your shine
Lazy bed star la di da petty bourgeois
Oh my would you look at the time
Until you wise up you know we're gonna line up
The pimps and snitches to dip into your riches
If you can't destroy it you might as well enjoy it <start> She's a rumor in the night
It's crazy
You can see her but she isn't there
She's the stealer of the light
It's crazy
But you go anywhere
It was just a summer night
Maybe
When a shiver cut across the air
Should you run and get away
Maybe
To go wherewherewhere
She crouches the hunter
Ready to tell you
Another lie
Another lie
You could see the side of someday
Feel the power of the young and strong
You were learning how to fly someway
You were wrongwrongwrong
She jumped at the moment
A chance to tell you
Another lie
It was just a summer night
Maybe
When a shiver cut across the air
Should you run and get away
Maybe
To go wherewherewhere
She jumps at the moment
She crouches the hunter yeah
You look and you know she's telling you
Another lie
Another lie
Why it's crazy
When you feel you're getting stronger
Why it's crazy
All the lies are getting longer
Another lie
Another lie <start> Woke up early this morning
As I looked around my world be crumblin' down
What I saw I couldn't believe Who are you
What might I be Oh the things you do
Stare at the sun one means three
At the helm insanity if you'd look Mama
Ya just might find but you're too far gone
Now you're just losin' your mind
Wanting to get away one more fix you'll be okay
The things ya do try and try to talk you down
You're so damn high can't hear a sound
Oh what's going on
Once you start you can't stop start to shake
Fall apart engine's burnin'
Burnin' out of time you're too far gone
Now you're just losin' your mind <start> Had a bit part
An endless reel
It always played in slomo
But now it's fast
A spinning wheel
I know the dynamo
My heart is cast
Speedy Marie
Ahead of the now
She's better built that's how
She's built for speed
Speedy Marie
Speedy Marie
Oh yes indeed
I said to me
And so I sing this romaunt
It's not enough
My liberty
There is a thing I want
I need
I love
Speedy Marie
Ahead of the now
She's better built that's how
She's built for speed
Speedy Marie
Speedy Marie
Juxtaposed in each moment's sight
Everything that I ever saw
And my one delight
Nothing can strike me in such awe
Mouth intricate shapes the voice that speaks
Always it will soothe
Rarer none are the precious cheeks
Is the size of each sculpted tooth
Each lip and each eye
Wise is the tongue wet of perfect thought
And softest neck where always do I
Lay my clumsy thoughts
She is that most lovely art
Happy are my mind and my soul and my heart. <start> He bought a bullseye at the county fair
To show what a good shot he was
Cost him fourteen dollars and ninety five
It's on the wall can you seecan you see
Can you see can you see it
She caught a stuffed tiger full of styrofoam beads
Do you see how she carries with ease
A safe smile wiped across her face
No fear for his fabric teeth
You're a plate you're a plate
You're a messy paper plate
You're a plate you're a plate
You're a messy paper ah
He swings a silver hammer on a copper plate
Sending lights shooting straight in the air
A brassy bell rings out but I hear one sound as he shouts
I'm the winner I'm the winner I'm the winner I'm the winner
Stuck carny smiles with no teeth at all
Counting stacks of green paper bills
Next to those milk jugs that just wont fall
And a bursting money till
You're a plate you're a plate
You're a messy paper plate
You're a plate you're a plate
You're a messy paper ah <start> Down down you can see them all
Rising gaily to the top
Keep on rising babe you know you got a long drop
You better cling 'cos it's the done thing
Down down at the Policeman's ball
They're all dancing in a line
Keep on gruntin' boys you know you're doin' fine
Come quickly I've been strangled
Down down at the Military yeah
They're all marching round and round oh
Keep them boots shined and that stiff upper lip down yeah
Ablution revolution
Down down at the launching pad
Giant phallus stands erect
Ten thousand tons of waste throb then eject
Look out space we're gonna change our place
Down down in old England town
There was air and now there's smoke
Let's build more cars and drive away before we choke
Suddenly it's always night time
Down down at that nice Trade Fair
All the money gone astray
Let's inflate this price and float away
Just you and me and everyone <start> move on hold and drag
invade no ones land
take a look in their starved eyes
mean more than a leading hand
now scrape and borrow in grimness
the groaning fever and praying
the convulsion and screams of dying
reach for you
you are the borderguard between life and death
the game you play is the game against god <start> When I hear them use your name
I get all choked up inside
It's not only from the shame
It's like  different lovers died
Except you're still just a mile away
But there's nothing left to say
Don't leave us down and out again
Cause we might break instead of bend
I felt a little strain in the pouring rain
It washed away most everything
If I found another love
They must be forever true
Cause if someone breaks this heart
Your old man right here is through
Heaven just seems so far away
When there's nothing left to say
Don't leave us down and out again
Cause we might break instead of bend
I felt a little strain in the pouring rain
It washed away most everything
Don't leave us down and out again
Cause we might break instead of bend
I felt a little strain in the pouring rain
It washed away most everything
Don't leave us down and out again
The little girl can't comprehend
She had another dream that her mama's gone
She's alright but you're all wrong <start> Electric light shines bright
But against the sun it is dim
Jet airplanes sure travel fast
But how fast is the speed of light
And no matter how low you are
There is always somebody lower
And no matter how slow you are
There is always somebody slower
Modern day structures are fantastic
But have you seen a butterfly's wings
Man has created symphony
But have you heard a blackbird sing
And no matter how dumb you are
There is always somebody dumber
And no matter how fine you are
There is always somebody finer
I am blind I am blind
But I see behind my eyes
Man can make sweet red wine
But have you tasted a mountain stream
Hollywood has created movies
But listen to the color of your dreams
And no matter how ugly you are
There is no such thing as ugly
And no matter how bad you are
There is always someone to forgive you
And no matter how fine you are
There is always somebody finer
And no matter how low you are
There is always somebody lower
And no matter how fast you are
There is always somebody faster
Faster faster faster faster faster faster and faster and faster
And slower and lower and finer and finer and slower and faster and lower... <start> I'm walking in the park
And I'm talking to the dark
But there ain't nobody listening no
My heart has turned to stone
When I found myself alone
Now all I do is whisper to the dark
Yeah
yeah
There's only so much you can take
You've gotta to give yourself a break
But I don't think you're listening no no no no
If you're gonna take it all so hard
You gonna tear yourself apart
I can understand you miss him in the dark
oh oh oh
Yeah teach your heart how to sing get the courage again now
Yeah take the pm train to the city
Yeah I had a chance for romance so I do it again now
If love is no longer being served
You've got to leave the table
Mister aznavour told me merci beaucoup
Though I miss him got to let go
Though I miss him got to let go
Let it go
It's about that time to leave it all behind you
You don't want to but life is passing by you
The hard knocks got you twisted like dreadlocks
Catalogue your dark and set some new marks
I understand your body's filled with hesitation
Trust me it's gonna be a whole new situation
Turn this page I guess you know what to do
Rise up like phoenix I'm bringing out the beauty in you

Love how you know
How to take me there
Yea I
Know where you go
Love how you know
How to take me there
You fill my head
With colours
Of wonder and delight
You move across my mind
Like the dance
Of the northern lights
Cause I
Know where you go
Love how you know
How to take me there

I'm gonna be the one to say sorry first.
I'm well rehearsed.
The penny's dropped
I'm gonna be the one to say I was wrong.
And then we're done.
Cause even when there is sorrow in your heart
You need a place need a place need a place to start.
Ooh so build a home put pictures on the wall
Choose a color for the door and let me in. 
Build a home cause I never wanna know
What it is to be alone no not again.
The penny's dropped
How come a simple thought can be so delayed.
Ain't it strange
The penny's dropped I've got it.
I'm gonna have a drink and we'll start again.
I'm still your friend.
Even when there is hunger in your heart
You need a place need a place need a place to start.
Ooh so build a home put pictures on the wall
Choose a color for the door and let me in. 
Build a home cause I never wanna know
What it is to be alone no not again.
Oohoohoohoohooh 
Oohoohoohoohooh
Cause even when there is sorrow in your heart
You need a place need a place need a place to start.
Ooh so build a home put pictures on the wall
Choose a color for the door and let me in. 
Build a home cause I never wanna know
How it feels to be alone no not again.
Oohoohoohoohooh 
Oohoohoohoohooh <start> Pleased to meet a sez the man in the suit

Piranha in the ocean eatin' you alive they've taken control can you survive
Look in the mirror now what do you see
who's the fool looking back at me
money's gone and so's the fame
don't look far to see who's to blame. <start> Now write this down
I'll never be your beast of burden
My back is broad but it's a hurting
All I want is for you to make love to me
I'll never be your beast of burden
I've walked for miles my feet are hurting
All I want is you to make love to me
Ain't I hard enough
Ain't I rough enough
Ain't I rich enough
I'm not too blind to see
I'll never be your beast of burden
So let's go home and draw the curtains
Put some music on the radio
Come on baby make sweet love to me 
Ain't I hard enough
Ain't I rough enough
Ain't I rich enough
I'm not too blind to see
Oh oh my little sister
Is a pretty pretty girl
My little sister is a pretty pretty girl
She love to ride and she loves to crawl
They love to take her out behind the wall
And when their done they just throw her away
And she don't have an awful lot to say
It hurts her so bad to come to the end
I re I remember all the times she spent sayin' Please
Ain't I hot enough
Ain't I rough enough
Ain't I rich enough
I'm not too blind to see oh oh
Oh oh
I'll never be your beast of burden.
My back is broad baby but it's a' hurtin'.
And all I want is you to make love to me.
What's the matter what's the matter with me
Ain't I hot enough
Ooh yeah ain't I rough enough
Ooh yeah ain't I rich enough rich enough rich enough
Too blind to see Too blind too blind oh
I'll never be your beast of burden.
I walk for miles honey my feet are hurtin'.
And all I want <start> Where are all the tricks that people play
When they're afraid to say
I want you to hold on to me
If I let you go again tonight
Whose arms will keep me warm
And take me where I want to be
But if I lose and then surrender all I know
What would I do if you decided to let go
Hopelessly I'd stand there with everything all gone
My head down in my hands
Just wondering why
CHORUS
This heart belongs to me
And I know what I believe
But now it longs to be
Only with you
Where are all the words I sometimes say
When I'm afraid to ask
I want you to hold on to me
Anyway you want to let me know
You're sharing my belief
Of wanting to hold on to me
I tell the truth and risk you running from my life
So much to lose and yet
You know how hard I try
Hopelessly I'd stand there with everything all gone
My head down in my hands
Just wondering why

I feel you coming on coming into me
Like a flood like a breath like a remedy
Your touch consumes my mind
I'm drowning in your eyes I'm drowning in your eyes
You're my flame you're my drug
I know you realize
This was meant to be

Deep in your oceans
You're taking the air out of my chest
You're coming strong we're running thin
I taste desire in your breath
It's a bright light at the end of the world
You're a hot fire and your presence is heard <start> She said baby get down on your knees
I said babe if you insist
She said why do you keep seeing things you know that don't exist
I said baby I love you now what can I do
I'll probably love you till the day I die
She said well pretty honey if that's true than give me both them pretty eyes
I said baby you can have them  you can have my eyes
See I was thinking if she took them I won't see her lies
But my baby  I can taste her lies.
She said baby get into this sack
I said baby I don't know what's there
She said all I want to do with you
Is take you with me everywhere
I said okay baby take me everywhere
Take me through the day through the night
She said oh silly babe don't you kid with me
You know I really don't have the time.
Still I said baby you can take me  and I got right in
See I was thinking if she took me I could taste her skin
But my baby all I taste is her lies.
Oh my baby all I taste is her lies
Oh my honey all I taste is her lies.
I said baby you can have them  you can have my eyes
See I was thinking if she took them I won't see her lies
But my baby  I can taste her lies.
Oh my baby
Oh my honey
Oh my baby
Oh my baby
I can taste
Her lies. <start> You say love
I say killing time
What's mine is yours
And yours is mine
You make me lose
I make you cry
I guess that rhymes
You're contained
By flourescent walls
I'm contained
By your control
You're overthrown
But underworn
I told you so
We're singing for the stingin' belle
She's clearly lost her way
Craving all the simple times
Inside her tragic day
Grow some balls
And speak your mind
You think you're cool
Like a porcupine
You're more like doves
That are taking flight
The sky is mine
We're singing for the stingin' belle
She's clearly lost her way
Craving all the simple times
Inside her tragic day
We're singing for the stingin' belle
She's clearly lost her way
Craving all the simple times
Inside her tragic day <start> I guess you're okay
You seem to feel better these days
I've known you for so long
I've seen your brightness go from blue to grey
You know that's true
You can shake your head but I can prove
I've seen things through your eyes
You think you win but in the end you lose
And there's no second guess
We take no second bets
Chances are we're a long way from happiness
Don't cover up the road to love
With words that can't express
The truth implies you're high and dry
And you're a long way from happiness
I'm one step behind
Looking out for you all the time
I'll put my faith in you
And steer you clear of love that leaves you blind <start> Align yourself
With the freed men
How can you deny this ground
You sold your flesh
Tell yourself that you're a free man
Tear your vestments the slave becomes the crown
The thirst filled us the worst years of
Birth and death were held by threads
The turning set about the pages saw escape
The filth of years beneath our fingers washed away
Then gold within our ears drew figures and erased
The wretched lost their way they're standing here today
Resist with wounded eyes wide awake but dead inside
You're breaking my heart You're breaking my heart
Standing here the audience will tear me all apart
The hardened answers you planned fell apart
So blanket me so you can see you've broken my heart
So I will tell you one last thing intertwine us for history
It will seal our fates but I take my place
Your rigid throats proclaim the righteous written word
But you cut out the veins and now you sleep with her
It's dripping from your mouths It's pouring from your skin
The lust of power takes you and the stench has settled in
You have ground your teeth craving control
I see what's waiting for me and it's beautiful so beautiful
I can't stop these words they all just rush to me
But I guess I've lost my senses there's just so much to see
Many times in my life I doubted your words
But here I am and everything I've heard is true
And it's you so beautiful
Beautiful to me <start> If I could grant you one wish
I'd wish you could see the way you kiss
Ooh I love watching you baby
When you're driving me crazy
Ooh I love the way you
Love the way you love me
There's nowhere else I'd rather be
Ooo to feel the way I feel with your arms around me
I only wish that you could see the way you love me
Woh woh woh woh the way you love me
It's not right
It's not fair
What you're missing over there
Someday I'll find a way to show you
Just how lucky I am to know you
Ooh I love the way you
Love the way you love me
There's nowhere else I'd rather be
Ooo to feel the way I feel with your arms around me
I only wish that you could see the way you love me
Woh woh woh woh the way you love me
You're the million reasons why
There's love reflecting in my eyes
Ooh I love the way you
Love the way you love me
There's nowhere else I'd rather be
Ooo to feel the way I feel with your arms around me
I only wish that you could see the way you love me
Woh woh woh woh the way you love me
Woh woh woh woh the way you love me
Woh woh woh woh the way you love me
Ooh the way you love me
The way you love me
Oh yeah
The way you love me
Woh woh woh woh the way you love me
Woh woh woh woh the way you love me
Woh woh woh woh the way you love me <start> Looking through this keyhole I see myself.
Convictions of the future turn to doubt.
That's when I have to realize that things aren't bad.
I push on feeling I'm never going back.
This keyhole inside my head
Is where I feel I can't begin.
Searching searching deep inside
A meaning to you I will
I will find.
A meaning to you I'll find...today.
Believing in my dreams is sure a start.
Confronting all my fears is very hard.
Everything from school to you is landing on my head. Where can I begin <start> You can't tell me there is no mystery
Mystery
Mystery
You can't tell me there is no mystery
It's everywhere I turn
Moon over junk yard where the snow lies bright
Snow lies bright
Snow lies bright
Moon over junk yard where the snow lies bright
Can set my heart to burn
Stood before the shaman I saw starstrewn space
Starstrewn space
Starstrewn space
Stood before the shaman I saw star strewn space
Behind the eye holes in his face
Infinity always gives me vertigo
Vertigo
Vertigo
Infinity always gives me vertigo
And fills me up with grace
I was built on a Friday and you can't fix me
You can't fix me
You can't fix me
I was built on a Friday and you can't fix me
Even so I've done okay
So grab that last bottle full of gasoline
Gasoline
Gasoline
Grab that last bottle full of gasoline
Light a toast to yesterday
And don't tell me there is no mystery
Mystery
Mystery
And don't tell me there is no mystery
It overflows my cup
This feast of beauty can intoxicate
Intoxicate
Intoxicate
This feast of beauty can intoxicate
Just like the finest wine
So all you stumblers who believe love rules
Believe love rules
Believe love rules
Come all you stumblers who believe love rules
Stand up and let it shine
Stand up and let it shine <start> At the firefly
We all tell lies
And the cleanup kid
Hangs his head
He's the quiet type
Came to la to write
But he never made it out of the fringes
Keeps a low profile you kick him
He'll smile
Thinks blood is his payment for losing
While me I'm hiding here
Pretending that my mind is clear
A rock for the forgotten
But when I pour they smile
And say to me that I'm
A rock for the forgotten
A bottle got broke
In a fight over dope
And the mean old man
Washed his hands
All the troubles he's seen
Seems like a dream
While he washes away his sorrow
But either way I can tell that he prays
There will never be another tomorrow
While me I never change
I try to keep things just the same
A rock for the forgotten
And when I pour their smiles
Say to me that I'm
A rock for the forgotten
Maybe they'll come alive
See the soapbox man
Is at it again
And the girls pass by avoiding his eye
He's the best there is
In the hellfire biz
A black belt in the art of babble
Came from Vera Cruz
When a bottle of booze
Told him he had to rouse the rabble
While me I'm hiding here
Pretending that my mind is clear
A rock for the forgotten
But when I pour they smile
And say to me that I'm a rock for
The forgotten
Maybe they'll come alive <start> I'm not a faceless not a racist
Not a fracture.
I'm not a whore wanting more
I'm not a fraction.
I'm not your teacher not your preacher
Not your hometown.
I'm not an able on your table
Not your background.
Well I'm not obtuse or some excuse
I'm not an open door.
I'm not your killer got my filler
Now I want some more.
I'm not a lover to another
Not a stereotype.
I'm not a rock through your window
On a cold night.
Well I'm not a book I'm not a hopeless
Not an artist.
I'm not a painter not a poet
I'm just short words.
They try to get you try to keep you
Try to pin you down.
Another gun under the table
And a long walk home. <start> See this ancient riverbed
See where all our follies are led
Down by the water and down by the old main drag
I was just some towhead teen
Feeling 'round for fingers to get in between
Down by the water and down by the old main drag
The season rubs me wrong
The summer swells anon
So knock me down tear me up
But I would bear it all broken just to fill my cup
Down by the water and down by the old main drag
Sweet descend this rabble round
The pretty little patter of a seaport town
Rolling down the water and rolling down the old main drag
All dolled up in gabardine
The lashflashing Leda of Pier nineteen
Queen of the water and queen of the old main drag
The season rubs me wrong
The summer swells anon
So knock me down tear me up
But I would bear it all broken just to fill my cup
Down by the water and down by the old main drag
The season rubs me wrong
The summer swells anon
So knock me down tear me up
But I would bear it all broken just to fill my cup
Down by the water and down by the old main drag
Down by the water and down by the old main drag
Down by the water and down by the old main drag <start> When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now.
Will you still be sending me a Valentine.
Birthday greetings bottle of wine.
If I'd been out till quarter to three.
Would you lock the door.
Will you still need me will you still feed me
When I'm sixtyfour.
You'll be older too
And if I say the word
I could stay with you.
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone.
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday morning go for a ride
Doing the garden digging the weeds
Who could ask for more.
Will you still need me will you still feed me
When I'm sixtyfour.
Every summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera ChuckDave
Send me a postcard drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Your's sincerely wasting away
Give me your answer fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me will you still feed me
When I'm sixtyfour <start> Another week in the drivers seat
With your feet up on the dashboard
Rain it kept a steady beat
As I watch you dream of Houston
How you're never going back
Yes sir that's a fact
As you wave your cowboy hat
And sang the Yellow Rose of Texas
Just trying to make high ground
Has kept us on the run
There's no crime in toeing the line
Because vultures aren't on us baby
And we're gonna walk in the sun
I might dream about Houston
But Houston don't dream about me
If I can keep it between the lines
Who knows what will be
Loose change days and motel nights
Day old coffee dollar post cards
State troopers flashing lights
As we listen to the thunder
As we talked about our past
So we see our coming future
You tell me you know love can last
While staring out the window
Just lookin' for
A place to hide
A place to ease our minds
A place away from yesterday
Close to tomorrow
Away from the sorrows
Of living other people's time
I might dream about Houston
But Houston don't dream about me
If I can keep it between the lines
Who knows what will be
How long how long
Til we feel a change
How long how long
Will the skies be gray
How long how long
Will it be this way
How long how long
Will she stay
I might dream about Houston
But Houston don't dream about me
If I can keep it between the lines
Who knows what will be
I might dream about Houston
But Houston don't dream about me
If I can keep it between the lines
Who knows what
Who knows what
Who knows what will be <start> Coming home with a bottle trying not to break the seal.
This Friday evening traffic's about enough to break a man's will.
And I can't wait to see you and see how your week has gone
And tear into Old No. and make love till dawn.
But your Mama she'll be calling if she ain't knocking on the door.
And it won't take me long to remember what I brought that bottle home for.
And we'll all get to fighting just like we always do.
And by Saturday morning I'll be singing these blues.
Last night I slept with my boots on again
One cut on my forehead and one my chin
On the hard old floor with nothi' to cover up with.
You got me real good girl and I must admit
You pack purty mean punch for such a pretty little dish.
And it's a shame to know most folks don't ever know love like this.
Come Monday morning I'll be sore to a faretheewell.
Cussin' God and America wishing them both just to send me off to hell.
But the boss man don't want no excuses when it comes time to get on the clock.
And without that paycheck I'd lose the rest of what sweet love I got. <start> The sun is coming up
But I don't see the light
I keep goin' on and on
Thinking 'bout where we went wrong
I've always heard that love
Could stand the test of time
But somethin' that we had is gone
Maybe we just stayed too long
I wish that I could lie
And tell myself it's alright
It was nothing at all

Somebody somewhere
Is falling in love tonight
Is it nothing at all
Somebody somewhere
Is saying their last goodbyes
I gotta know
Is it the same when it comes
And when love goes
Where do I go from here
Don't know where to turn
Will you find another face
Or disappear in yesterday
Should I hold on
Should I let all the memories go
Was it nothing at all

She comes and goes...
 <start> I noticed you in the photograph
A ghost like you why don't you laugh
Five years on and your baby's got the gun
Picking off the memories one by one
Bang bang bang goes the lovers ideal'
Bang bang bang
She said sit down and shut your mouth
Pack your things and then drive south
Drive south and stay there honey
Keep going in search of the money
How come you're always making fun of them
It's unbecoming and it's cruel
The way they raised you says a lot about who you are
And where you're going and if you've gone too far
A little rain check every now and again
Will do you the world of good so I'll say it again
Sit down and shut your mouth
Pack your things and then drive south
Drive south and stay there honey
Keep going in search of the money <start> why am i drug along i see your point step into my shoes for once. i understand but i see right and wrong. stubbornness won't solve a thing. i'll take a hit from the crossfire. take a hit from you from me from her from him. what do you so desire where will i sleep tonight i won't burn down with you. it's personal because it catches up with me. i won't burn down with you. bite your tongue the numbness with make you see. i'm equally empathetic can you be you can't expect it. i can't explain it and there's no way that i single handedly can. <start> Your breath is sweet
Your eyes are like two jewels in the sky
Your back is straight your hair is smooth
On the pillow where you lie
But I don't sense affection
No gratitude or love
Your loyalty is not to me
But to the stars above
One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below
Your daddy he's an outlaw
And a wanderer by trade
He'll teach you how to pick and choose
And how to throw the blade
He oversees his kingdom
So no stranger does intrude
His voice it trembles as he calls out
For another plate of food
One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below
Your sister sees the future
Like your mama and yourself
You've never learned to read or write
There's no books upon your shelf
And your pleasure knows no limits
Your voice is like a meadowlark
But your heart is like an ocean
Mysterious and dark
One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below <start> I could only be myself with you around
Oh with you around
And now there's nothing left for me to think about
Whoa to think about.
And it hurts like hell
To be torn apart
And it hurts like hell
To be thrown around
We were born to be together
Torn apart
Torn apart
We were born to be together
Torn apart
Torn apart
You stepped with a heavy tread
And left your mark
Oh your mark on me
The space you used to fill is now this great black hole
Oh you're out of sight but not out of my mind
And it hurts like hell
To be torn apart
And it hurts like hell
To be thrown around
We were born to be together
Torn apart
Torn apart
We were born to be together
Torn apart
Torn apart
Oh oh oh oh.
We were born to be together
Torn apart
Torn apart
We were born to be together
Torn apart
Torn apart
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh. <start> I had forgotten all about the case of the three pins
They said I must be cracked
Until the brown paper parcel landed on my welcome mat
Even the pretty secretaries who wouldn't even
Let me hang my hat
All recognize my handwriting
And return to sender as a matter of fact
If I were you id change my name again
They dont care what they do to you believe me
This is the coronation of the king of thieves
His occupation is the king of thieves
He can steal more than you can save
You can take him on but youre not that brave
Ill tell your fortune in a minute or two
I might even tell you what comes next
The moguls want a human sacrifice
And look at that girl young hungry and perplexed
They took away the best years of her life
Ah but its all in good fun
And if you kept you nose clean
You can laugh now at the caring things they've done
Ill write this story down but youll never guess the
Final twist
Blow the whistle on the whole design
As they find my name on that fatal mailing list
I hear the clatter of a typewriter
Another rookie eating up the reams
I think its time to place my feet under the desk
And put my mark on another mans dreams
This is the coronation of the king of thieves
And look at that girl
Look at that girl
Look at that girl <start> Little prince livin' in a dream world
Using everybody at your beck and call
You could have it all
If you only knew who you really are
Little prince livin' in a fantasy
You're lonely though illusion keeps you company
Take a look around
Does your little town exist
Or is it just too far from your reality
I know it can't be very easy
To be brought up treated royally
To have socalled friends all around
Who cater to you loyally
Don't it make you wonder
As you listen for the thunder
Little prince though you may deny it
There's something in the quiet
Of your deepest soul
That's an empty hole
Though I know you don't
Want to hear it
You will never find your spirit
Until you see and be
Who you really are <start> Every year when this day rolls around
I think of the night we both tore up the town
And I wonder if you're laughing with your eyes glowing
And the pretty conversation where the wines flow
They're running your play just like always
Everyday at least one time
I picture your face in the back of my mind
Smiling at the ocean with your eyes shinin'
It has a red river and a 
For a thousand days just like always
Maybe someday our real love we'll forget
If we start to live again the life without regret
Funny isn't it But the men ain't laughin' yet
Does love really last forever
Ocean misses sunset every time
I pass your street I look both ways
So incomplete and I think that I might see
Lord knows how I will I wish that you will call me
Then I know you won't but I love you anyway
Just like always just like always just like always <start> Happy morning theres a light that's finished rising.
When I wake to share my ache
Your eyes are closed and crying.
Up is down and in is out and you are lying.
Summer here is nothing dear
Don't bore yourself with flying.
It was only for an hour 
It was only for us
Put it on a shelf and carry on without it.
Fill your leaving back with drag and never stop to doubt it.
Smells of piles of ginger honey you're allowed it.
Catch the sun and one by bun
And cry because you found it.
It was only for an hour 
It was only for us. <start> We're dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Right on time here's the other shoe.
Clouds overhead start to loom.
Some born to win others fated to lose.
From options we must choose.
My friend dread is right on time can't start to think that it is fine
Watch the tower as it starts to teeter.
New lyrics follow the same old meter.
It can't be comfortable when the whole thing's about to fall.
We're dying on the inside.
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Butterflies my stomach starts to heave.
What joyous blunder waits for me
Finished first but I missed the start.
Hitched the mule behind the cart.
Take the rose by the thorns.
Hope for sun but here's the storm.
So head outside and wait for rain.
Watch it all go down the drain.
It can't be comfortable when the whole thing's about to fall.
We're dying on the inside.
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
We settle in but it's time to go taken to sea by the undertow.
Love the smell but I hate the taste.
Feeling good is such a waste.
Loved the book but I hate the end gained a lover but I lost a friend.
Straight to worst from the best.
Nothing can fill that hole in my chest.
It can't be comfortable when the whole thing's about fall.
To make things worse it all goes so fast and we try to hold on as they go past.
We need a Peter we get a Paul at least Judas had the balls.
To make a move on these building doubts about how this messiah thing would shake out
I feel the nail against my skin wait for the hammer to drive it in.
It can't be comfortable when you know the whole thing is about to fall.
We're dying on the inside.
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
It can't be comfortable when you know the whole thing is about to
It can't be comfortable when you know the whole thing is about to
It can't be comfortable when you know the whole thing is about to fall
We're dying on the inside
Dying on the inside
Dying on the inside

We're dying on the inside

And though I didn't lie I made her mad
Now won't you tell me what to think of that
Let's be friends let's be friends

Pushing me around c'mon c'mon don't push me down

You know I love you girl nothing to add
I know you love me to that's why I'm glad
But don't you think there's something we've forgot

For I just never realised
How I used to take it all on me
Despite the fact it wasn't mine
I don't know you like I used to
I can't accept this state of mind
It don't feel too good I can assure you
To know I never really tried
I'm not begging you no I'm not going to 
Can't find the words today won't help me anyway 
I've got a comment to oh what's become of you 
It's just a bit too late now you're gone
This one goes out to the other
For I just never realised
How I use to take it all on me
Despite the fact it wasn't mine <start> Hey ho hey ho there's something I don't know
Like who I am or where I go
We're on this climb we'll be there for some time
There is no reason I can find
Wagon train what's my name
Can you guess my crime
Wagon train ease the pain
And leave the world behind
Wagon train head 'em up ehoh
A brave new world for all those boys and girls
A universe for us to roam
They cast us out and left us with no doubt
They're never gonna bring us home <start> We praise You oh God for the Son of Your love
For Jesus who died and is now gone above

Bleached black from the smile
On a glimpse of your face
Yeah I ran to her
Blame it on me
That inevitable date
You remember her
I'm putting it off
And I can't control fate
'Cause we're similar
I blame it on you
'Cause that side of me I hate
But you were never hurt
I'm putting it off
And I can't control fate
Yeah I ran to her
Blame it on me
That inevitable game
But you were never hurt <start> Every word from your mouth is a knife in my ear
Every thought in your head is like poison to hear
Every word from your mouth is a knife in my ear
Like a snake in a suit spitting into the air
With a tongue like a needle and we're shot full of fear
White picket teeth and a big red alert
The life of the party and we pulled up our skirt
It's like poison
It's like poison
Every word from your mouth is a knife in my ear
Every thought in your head is like poison to hear
Every word from your mouth is a knife in my ear
A fool is a devil and a devil's a fool
With a forktongue needle and you got us all fooled
A monkey doing tricks and we couldn't resist
If this isn't evil then I don't know what is
It's like poison
It's like poison
Every word from your mouth is a knife in my ear
Every thought in your head is like poison to hear
Every word from your mouth is a knife in my ear
It's like poison
It's like poison
Every word from your mouth is a knife in my ear
Every thought in your head is like poison to hear
Every word from your mouth is a knife in my ear <start> Hope you don't mind
If I just sit here a while
Well I've been off the beaten track
For a long long time
Don't know if I was misled
And just got lost
But I know nothing's ever
Never gonna be okay again no how
'Cause everything is just closing in
Well I don't know that I have one single friend
Not one single friend
My mom thinks I need religion
I think I need a shower and something to eat
Can I bum another cigarette
And thanks for the listening to me
You know I don't like to steal
But I've got needs
And I know nothing's ever
Never gonna be okay again no how
'Cause everything is just closing in
I don't know that I have one single friend
Not one single friend
Not one single friend
Not one single friend
Not one single friend <start> For everything I never had
I made some dreadlocks in my hair
For every word I should have said
without you I feel better
For everytime I should have stayed
Im sorry but its not my way
For every night I should have slept
I drem well without a bed
Should I do the right things
Should I do what I think
Shout louder when I shout
Run faster when I run
Let me live out every day like it was the last one
Ifif you dont understand
Take me as I am
Let me live out every day like it was the last one
For every day I didnt work
I got a job singing this song
For every rule I shouldnt breakIf I canwell I do
For every friend who was no friend
I got my dog
For every lesson that I missed
I got it myself
Lyrics
Should I do the right things
Should I do what I think
Shout louder when I shout
Run faster when I run
Let me live out every day like it was the last one
Ifif you dont understand
Take me as I am
Let me live out every day like it was the last one
Shout
Should I take my own away
Should I take my own away
Shout louder when I shout
Run faster when I run
Let me live out every day like it was the last one
Ifif you dont understand
Take me as I am
Let me live out every day like it was the last one <start> Where you gonna go
Where are you gonna hide
You go on leaving out your heart
And all it's saying deep inside
I can feel your love heart beat
You got me all wrong
You don't have to worry
You just been lonely too long
I know what it means to hide your heart
>From long ago 

It keeps you running
It keeps you running etc.
I know how you feel
You know I been there
But what you've been keeping to yourself
Well you know it just ain't fair <start> You are a loser just like I was
You are a loser like the rest of your friends
You're a loser in the worst way
I think you're losing just to make up
Yeah I've seen the light
All around your face
I see you dying in the highway
I see you climbing up the hill
I see your sunshine on your blond hair
I see you worshiping the thrill
Yeah I've seen the light
All around your face
Yeah I've seen the light
Shine in your eyes
Yeah I've seen the light
Light from another place
Now I know its not real
Yes I know it's not real...
Yes I know it's not <start> You've been identified
You've been exemplified
I see you standing there playing with your hair
I'm talking to you but you don't even care
I talk to people but most don't listen
They have a hard time dealing just with themselves
most people are just narcissistic
or they're just temporarily disconnected
These people got lots to say
but they don't have much to hear...Split Split
This girl had a sign on her face
I get worse just ad beer.
You've been identified
You've been exemplified
I see you standing there playing with your hair
I'm talking to you but you don't even care
I don't have time for your vanity
Just how much do you think you can change
Don't want to see you on just sunny days
and I'd never want to buy your lunch again
Don't want to hear how fat you are
when you're as skinny as you can be
Don't want to hear you asking
Is she cuter than me
I'm getting on my way
'cause I can see that it's not your day
I'm getting on my way from you...
You've been identified
You've been exemplified
I see you standing there playing with your hair
I'm talking to you but you don't even care
I talk to people but most don't listen
They have a hard time dealing just with themselves
most people are selfcentristic
or they're just temporarily disconnected
I don't think in any situation
I could help you veer from your destination
I don't think in any situation
I could hang with you without frustration.
I'm getting on my way
'cause I can see that it's not your day
I'm getting on my way from you... <start>  <start> Groovy little daddy left home have you seen him
Groovy little brother blowing his mind
Groovy little momma got her eyes on Jesus
Groovy little sister says it's all fine
You feel like you want to cry
You eat the bread you drink the wine
Give me something not just nothing
Pull ourselves together groove it lightly
And crucify the peacemakers
Criticize and analyze
Crucify the peacemakers
Groovy little family left out have you seen it
Slaves to the machine blowing our minds
Groovy little nation turning on it's TV
A little prayer of love becoming our crime
You feel like you want to cry
You eat the bread you drink the wine
Give me something not just nothing
Pull ourselves together groove it lightly
You crucify the peacemakers
Criticize and analyze
Crucify the peacemakers <start> You never told me of your other faces
You were the widow of a wild cat
And now I know about your special kisses
And I know you know where that's at
I guess I recognize your destination
I think I see beneath your makeup
What you want is so separation
This is no ordinary
This is no ordinary

What a criminal world
The boys are like babyfaced girls
What a criminal girl
She'll show you where to shoot your gun
What a typical mother's son
The only thing that she enjoys
Is a criminal world
Where the girls are like babyfaced boys
You've got a very heavy reputation
But noone knows about your lowlife
I know a way to find a situation
And hold a candle to your highlife disguise
You caught me kneeling at your sister's door
That was no ordinary stickup
I'm well aware just what you're looking for
I am no ordinary
I am no ordinary

What a criminal world
The boys are like babyfaced boys
What a criminal girl
She'll show you where to shoot your gun
What a typical mother's son
The only thing that she enjoys
Is a criminal world
Where the girls are like babyfaced boys
Babyfaced boys
Babyface

Hear the joyful sound
See the heavens open up
Hear the music coming down
Nothing's gonna separate us from the Father's love
I can't help but celebrate
'Cause we're not alone
If God is on our side
Who can be against us
If God is on our side
We won't be afraid
Though the mountains may fall
And the sky will crumble
There ain't nothin' gonna stand in our way
Come on down to the riverside
Wash it all away
Leave behind your troubled mind
For an uncloudy day
Nothing's gonna separate us from the Father's love
I can't help but celebrate
'Cause we're not alone. <start> Is it not enough for you to be alive
Did you have to create God to survive
This is all we have and all we have is everywhere
There are so many stars

Life seems so much better
Life seems so much deeper than before
Does it make you feel much better to stay unaware
Are you living for a heaven that might not be there
This is all we have and all we have is everywhere
There are so many stars
The church and state are lethal killers
If this is all we have
Life seems so much better

Nobody every paid the rent there was never anything done
Than one day I killed her now I'm on the run
But living with Linda used to be fun
Living with Linda she did what I wanted her to do
But living with Linda wasn't always easy to do
So one day I killed her now I'm on the run
But living with Linda used to be fun
Laying up with Linda never had responsibility
She was a dancer at night where I was rock 'n' rolling 'till 
We drank we never saw the daylight that was the death of her and me
Then one day I just got bored and killed her but she used to be fun
Laying up with Linda we still fuck fuck
Never had a quarter everything we owned was in Hawk
Then I got pissed and killed her so now I'm on the run
But let me tell ya living with Linda used to be fun <start> If I seem a little jittery I can't restrain myself
I'm falling into fancy fragments
Can't contain myself
I gotta breakdown breakdown yeah
I gotta breakdown breakdown yeah
I can stand austerity but it gets a little much
When there's all these livid things
That you never get to touch
Feels my brain's like porridge coming outta my ears
And I was expecting reverie
Taken leave of my senses and I'm in arrears
My legs buckle over I'm living on my knees
I gotta breakdown yeah
You gimme breakdown yeah
I'm gonna breakdown yeah uhhuh
Whatever makes me tick
It takes away my concentration
Sets my hands trembling gives me frustration
Breakdown yeah
I hear that two is company
For me it's plenty trouble
Though my double thoughts are clearer
Now that I am seeing double
Breakdown yeah
Oh mum can I grow outta
What's a little too big for me
I'm gonna give up that ghost
Before it gives up me
I wander loaded as a crowd
A nowhere wolf of pain
Living next to nothing but my never mind remains
I gotta breakdown yeah
I'm gonna breakdown yeah
You gimme breakdown yeah <start> I hear it doubly clear
There's a doubled exposure
Just waiting to happen
I'm sitting and fading
Rain tapping together
Two licks of the dog bone
Me slipping through belt loops
You running ahead of
The sound coming after
I hear it doubly clear
Two mannequins in the window
Suit up like twins on day one
Loud harks in the grandest canyon
Natural slap the world back at ya
It's placing the mirror
And you will hear her
Throw two hacks attempting to chip it
Return of the bat crack
In a place called Camden
 the two of us together
 the sweet of the double
 me right behind you
 my steps will follow
 two eyes that appeared there
 you saw them both times
 looking at reflections
 and you were one of them
And it was nice
And it happened twice
And it was nice
And it was nice
And it happened twice
And it was nice
And it happened twice
Ant it was
And it was
A place that's thrice best leading me into a feedback zone
In which I lose time I'm finding new rhythms to hold on
A place that's thrice best leading me right into the feedback zone
In which I lose time I'm finding new rhythms to hold on
 two links in a weapon
 shooting in a foul mood
 you're running ahead now
 the sound coming after
So turned on by the delay
So turned on by the delay
So turned on by the delay <start> How can I sit and eat my tea
With all that blood flowing from the television.
At a quarter to six
I watch the news
Eatingeating all my food
As I sit watching the red spot
In the egg which looks like
All the blood you don't see on the television.
Still body nowno movement yet
Five men lie die flat on their backs
Were they born to lie in state
Defend the ever stagnate great
Down on the street assassinate
All of them look so desperate
Declared blood war on the bourgeois state
Watch new blood on the  inch screen
The corpse is a new personality
Ionic charge gives immortality
The corpse is a new personality
Down on the street assassinate
All of them look so desperate
Declared blood war on the bourgeois state
Watch new blood on the  inch screen

I heard your glockenspiel pounding soft
I climbed on top of you you said get off
Must this drag on forever
I tripped and stumbled in the dead of night
Flashing my endless stream of kryptonite
I lit my brain with rainbow crystal light
Must this drag on forever
Then things got so quiet
Like I should not be here
You said I had to try it
Don't let me interfere
Just get me out of here
Your waxy face is melting on your lap
I sat there trying to crush a ginger snap
Your scream was sounding like a thunderclap
Must this drag on forever
Your coconut windows hid the light so well
Your testimony put me in a spell
You look so wasted that I could not tell
Must this drag on forever
Then things got too quiet
Like I should not be here
You said I had to try it
Don't let me interfere
Please go out of here
Must this drag on forever
Must this drag on forever
Must this drag on forever
Must this drag on forever <start> Holy Man so lucky

ese cuerpo que est esperando
en la ventana por ti.
Y t ests donde no te ve

La pared de ladrillo gris
siempre junto a ti
siempre junto a ti
la conoces muy bien
muy muy bien.
Y siguen all
y siguen por siempre all
sin hablar
tus bellos ojos asustados
.
Un portal en la oscuridad
bajo su balcn
sabes muy bien dnde te conducira.
Sin pensar
oyes al entrar pasos al sonar
risas al chillar dentro de su portal.
Si te vas pierdes la ocasin
de volverla a ver como debe ser
y no sabes pensar al temblar.
Y viven all
y nunca se cansarn de mirar
a la ventana encendida.
Subirs sin poder parar
sin mirar atrs
un segundo ms y la conocers.
Al sonar tu respiracin contra la pared
en un cuarto piso su voz te asust.
Ella fue una suave piel una dulce voz
ojos de cristal un segundo de amor
para ti.
Y all seguir
de nuevo le has vuelto a ver
al pasar en la ventana encendida. <start> Gangster girl your love has got my guns firin'

Well none of your crimes have been violent
What do you say I love you.

And the right to legal counsel too
Oh Gangster Girl you stole my heart away
I'll get it back from you someday

Not for fame or fortune do they strive.
But the fruits of their labor are worth more than their pay.
And it's time a few of them were recognized.

You work a forty hour week for a livin' just to send it on down the line.
Hello Pittsburgh steel mill workers let me thank you for your time.
You work a forty hour week for a livin' just to send it on down the line.
This is for the one who swings the hammer driving home the nail.
Or the one behind the counter ringing up the sale.
Or the one who fights the fires the one who brings the mail.
For everyone who works behind the scenes.
You can see them every morning in the factories and the fields.
In the city streets and the quiet country towns.
Working together like spokes inside a wheel.
They keep this country turning around.
Hello Kansas wheat field farmer let me thank you for your time.
You work a forty hour week for a livin' just to send it on down the line.
Hello West Virginia coal miner let me thank you for your time.
You work a forty hour week for a livin' just to send it on down the line.
This one is for the one who drives the big rig up and down the road.
Or the one out in the warehouse bringing in the load.
Or the waitress the mechanic the policeman on patrol.
For everyone who works behind the scenes.
With a spirit you can't replace with no machine.
Hello America
Let me thank you for your time. <start> In my shoes my toes are busted
My kitchen says my bread is molded
I got a good job at the dollar store
One foot in the hole
One foot gettin' deeper
With a broken nail and a blown out speaker
I ain't got much else to lose
I'm faded flat busted
Been jaded I've been dusted
I know that I've seen better days
One foot in the hole
One foot gettin' deeper
Crank it to eleven blow another speaker
And I ain't got I ain't got much to lose
'Cause I've seen better days
I've been the star of many plays
I've seen better days
And the bottom drops out
I've seen better days
I've been the star of many plays
I've seen better days
And the bottom drops out
Now my cup's filled up with five buck wine
I find myself here all the time
Another rip in the glass
Another chip in my tooth
Rained on I've been stained on
Found another goat I try to put the blame on
And now I'm steppin' on all the cracks
So I guess there ain't no use
'Cause I've seen better days
I've been the star of many plays
I've seen better days
And the bottom drops out
I've seen better days
I've been the star of many plays
I've seen better days
And the bottom drops out
I'm bent like glass
Second hand like glory
Missed the bus but I'm in no hurry
Molasses fast no business born
One foot in the hole
One foot gettin' deeper
Crank it to eleven blow another speaker
And I ain't got I ain't got much to lose
I've seen better days
I've been the star of many plays
I've seen better days
And the bottom drops out
I've seen better days
I've been the star of many plays
I've seen better days
I've seen better days
I know that I've seen better days

I've been the star of so many plays

I walked on the edge without a hold whole way

'Cause I know I know that I've seen better better days
 <start> Instrumental <start> Turn on the lights
It's the anthem
For the strange it's a party for you
By the numbers
Here is the proof that they're taking control
That they're twisting it into the hate and the loathing we have for ourselves
By the hand that they wipe their own ass they will die from the stench of the shit they will sell
To reach for the sun
And only find the bottom rung
To reach for the sun
They have no answer for your personal holocaust
Your only reason to exist is to pay the cost
They don't care about you no one cares at all
When underneath the bottom feeder falls
Now we are live
At the centre
of the scene it's the crime of the year
You want an answer
Here's the headline
Burning the bodies and leaving them festering
Always avoiding averting their eyes from the cross that they hang
Their example's a person who knows how to answer their cries
To reach for the sun
And only find the bottom rung
To reach for the sun
They have no answer for your personal holocaust
Your only reason to exist is to pay the cost
They don't care about you no one cares at all
When underneath the bottom feeder falls
Tune out the screams
Tune out the noise
You try but it seems so loud
It seems so loud 
Under your feet
There's a voice that's speaking softly now
But it seems so loud
It seems so loud 
We will not fall
We will not wait for you to see
We will not fall
We will not let you take our dreams
We will not fall 
We will not let you take our lives
We will not fall 
We cannot take this anymore
We will not fall 
To reach for the sun
And only find the bottom rung
They have no answer for your personal holocaust
Your only reason to exist is to pay the cost
They don't care about you no one cares at all
When underneath the bottom feeder falls <start> Daisies in the chain
Woven in your hair that falls
Into a braid
Woven' round the statue's toes
In the gardens you made
Bells that sing and chime
Little crystal bells that toll
All through the night
Never once did angels break
Away from your side
Won't ya hurry home
Won't ya hurry home
Hurry down that lone eight mile road
Won't ya hurry home
Now your seeds are sewn
Hurry down that lone eight mile road
Poppies red and gold
Growin' wild as weeds beside
Yellow Brick Road
Growin' in the ditch where I
Sailed a milk carton boat
But how can you deny
When the spirit wraps in broad
Daylight
And it looks you right between
The eyes
Won't ya hurry home
Won't ya hurry home
Hurry down that lone eight mile road
Won't ya hurry home
Now your leaves are strewn
Hurry down that lone eight mile road
Ooh
All those talkin' sculls
Ma they don't scare me much
Not anymore
Think I finally got my head
'Round the door
Won't ya hurry home
Won't ya hurry home
Hurry down that lone eight mile road
Won't ya hurry home
While the breeze is blowin'
Hurry down that lone eight mile road
Won't ya hurry home
Now won't ya hurry home
Hurry down that lone eight mile road
Hurry home
Down that lone eight mile road
Hurry home
Hurry home
Down that lone eight mile road
Hurry home
Ooh ooh
Hurry home
Ooh ooh ooh <start> you say
you like to sleep alone
and i say
i miss the way you
breathe
you say
i get away with murder
but you know i've paid
for hurting
someone i cant leave
behind
Do you feel something
pulling you back in
do you see something
you wanna see again
i could be the one
i could make it up to
you
take me back im the
lonely boy who
who loves you
you say
my broken heart becomes
me
i say
i'd sell it cheap to you
you say
i should
wrap all the lies i've
told in
 dollar bills and
smoke the
money doesnt burn so
clean
Do you feel something
pulling you back in
do you see something
you wanna see again
i could be the one
i could make it up to
you
take me back im the
lonely boy who
who loves you
 <start> I'm not waiting I'm not waiting.
I have pictures in my troubled past
And their shaped like broken glass.
I have memories I kept of you
I return them with goodbyes.
Cause I'm not waiting for you anymore
I don't care what might have been.
I'm not waiting for you anymore
I give up my love can't win.
Chorus
But in my heart my heart I know that though I go I'll love you still.
But in my heart my heart I know that though I go I always will.
I'm not waiting I'm not waiting.
I still think about what used to be
I have dreams that might have been.
Someone else will walk beside you soon
Now I know my love can't win.
So I'm not waiting for you anymore
I don't care what might have been.
I'm not waiting for you anymore
I give up so why pretend
Chorus <start> The wheels forever spinning
The dice are thrown and scatter
The words are all of winning
But only numbers matter
We bet on our existence
We'll last another round
The lucky go the distance
The losers go to ground
From birth to death we gamble
The lots are daily cast
No warning or preamble
Which one will be your last
There is a great comfort in pure hatred
For envy's not enough not enough
The soothing joy of malice
Is made of sterner stuff sterner stuff
The failure of a father
The torment of a son
Is a recipe to justify
The worst that could be done
He'll destroy us unless we call a halt
Should the bastard steal our birthright
It will be our fault
The race is won by cunning
A terrifying dance
Too complex in the running
To leave it all to chance
But chance is all we're given
So chances we must take
The gambler's stake is driven
Through hearts that dare not break
But all save one are broken
As fatal points are scored
And one surviving token
Holds sway across the board
There's a moment when the game's balance
Tilts the other way the other way
When the odds begin to favour
Outsiders in the play in the play
The failure of incumbents
The sleazy tricks they use
Mean that those who think they call
The tune can only lose
Deal the cards it won't matter how they fall
Because nothing is a gamble when you want it all <start> Close the city and tell the people that something's coming to call
Death and darkness are rushing forward to take a bite from the wall oh
You've nothing to say
They're breaking away
If you listen to fools
The Mob Rules
The Mob Rules
Kill the spirit and you'll be blinded the end is always the same
Play with fire you burn your fingers and lose your hold of the flame oh
It's over it's done
The end is begun
If you listen to fools
The Mob Rules
You've nothing to say
Oh they're breaking away
If you listen to fools
Break the circle and stop the movement the wheel is thrown to the ground
Just remember it might start rolling and take you right back around
You're all fools
The Mob Rules <start> You said love was just a
Fantasy nothing you need
In your life
That little weakness in
Humanity you never
Thought you would try
In my experience you must
Agree what all the world's
Tryin' to find
Only looking for that special
Someone to turn the water
To wine
So wake up look around
Time is slippin' through our
Fingers so fast
If it's love that you've found
Welcome to the real world
At last
Could it be you've had
A change of heart even if it's
Hard to admit
Every day you're getting
Closer to me why must
You try to resist
So wake up look around
Time is slippin' through our
Fingers so fast
If it's love that you've found
Welcome to the real world
At last <start> Deeper than the deepest deep blue sea
High as a girl in a redwood tree
Lonesome as a cowboy on TV
That's what it feels like to be me
Hey ho I wanna let go
To everybody I ever did know
Swing your partner dosey do
Save me from tomorrow
Ba ba ba
Swinging like a rope on a southern breeze
Shaking like a pilgrim beyond belief
Falling like an angel endlessly
That's what it feels like to be me
That's what it feels like to be me
Hey ho I wanna let go
To everybody I ever did know
Swing your partner dosey do
Save me from tomorrow
Hey ho I wanna let go
To everybody I ever did know
Swing your partner dosey do
Save me from tomorrow
Ba ba ba
Hey ho I wanna let go
To everybody I ever did know
Swing your partner dosey do
Save me from tomorrow
Ba ba ba
Ba ba ba
Ba ba ba
... <start> There was a wicked messenger
From Eli he did come
With a mind that multiplied
The smallest matter
When questioned who had sent for him
He answered with his thumb
For his tongue it could not speak
But only flatter
He stayed behind the assembly hall
It was there that he made his bed
Often times he could be seen returning
Until one day he just appeared
With a note in his hand which read
The soles of my feet I swear they're burning
The leaves began to fallin'
And the seas began to part
And the people that confronted him were many
The leaves began to fallin'
And the seas began to part
And the people that confronted him were many
And he was told these last few words
Which opened up his heart
If ye cannot bring good news then don't bring any
If ye cannot bring good news then don't bring any
And opened up his heart <start> Sai
Nascono cos
Fiabe che vorrei
Dentro tutti I sogni miei
E le racconter
Per volare in paradisi che non ho
E non  facile restare senza piu' fate da rapire
E non  facile giocare se tu manchi
Aria come  dolce nell'aria
Scivolare via dalla vita mia
Aria respirami il silenzio
Non mi dire addio ma solleva il mondo
S
Portami con te
Tra misteri di angeli
E sorrisi demoni
E li trasformer
In coriandoli di luce tenera
E riuscir sempre a fuggire dentro colori da scoprire
E riuscir a sentire ancora quella musica
Aria come  dolce nell'aria
Scivolare via dalla vita mia
Aria respirami il silenzio
Non mi dire addio ma solleva il mondo
Aria abbracciami
Voler voler voler voler
Aria ritorner nell'aria
Che mi porta via dalla vita mia
Aria mi lascer nell'aria
Aria com' dolce nell'aria
Scivolare via dalla vita mia
Aria mi lascer nell'aria <start> creating laws creating bills

Chorus
American justice it aint for us it aint for us
they waste your money they waste your time
down in court the poor don't count
the laws they make are to protect the rich
the land of the free is not for me
Chorus
american justice for the rich
american justice for the ties
american justice full of ties
american justice it's not for me
Chorus <start> They mess you up early on
Put you in the shackles
You don't know what is going on
But it's going on strong
Yeah yeah
It's alright
Keep on pushing the cart
They give you this god
The god you must believe in
It's the holy bible
It makes perfect sense
Yeah yeah
It's alright
Keep on pushing the cart
Magic paper
That's all that you need
To get yourself a good life
To get yourself some happiness
Yeah yeah
It's alright
Keep on pushing the cart
Find yourself a woman
You better not find a man
You don't know how strong it is
The family hate <start> There's a room in a hotel in New York City
It shares our fate and deserves our pity
I don't want to remember it all
The promises are made if you just hold on
Hold on hold on hold on hold on
I just need enough of you to dull the pain
To get me through the night until we're twins again
Until we're stripped down to our skeletons again
Until we're saints just swimming in our sins again
And there's a jet black crow droning on and on and on
Up above our heads droning on and on and on
Keep making trouble 'till you find what you love
I need a new partner in crime and you shrug
A birth and a death on the same day
And honey I only appear so I can fade away
I wanna throw my hands in the air and scream
And I can just die laughing on your spiral of shame
And there's a jet black crow droning on and on and on
Up above our heads droning on and on and on
Hit it never quit it I have been through the wreck
But I can string enough to show my face in the light again
Hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on
Hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on <start> Ma cried like a lady
Pa cried like a man
  one less kennedy
And I was too young to understand
And the years flew by in colours
Each one a little faster than before
And as the war caused some to cry
I'd identify
My tv keeping score
Growing up  in the shadow of the u.s.a.
Trying to find  the meaning of life today
America  it's a heavy kind of role you
Play
You're the hero  you're the villain
Your every move is on display
Ma cried like a lady
Pa cried like a man
  one less kennedy
And I was too young to understand
We were all too young to understand <start> Goodnight my angel
Time to close your eyes
And save these questions for another day
I think I know what you've been asking me
I think you know what I've been trying to say
I promised I would never leave you
And you should always know
Wherever you may go
No matter where you are
I never will be far away
Goodnight my angel
Now it's time to sleep
And still so many things I want to say
Remember all the songs you sang for me
When we went sailing on an emerald bay
And like a boat out on the ocean
I'm rocking you to sleep
The water's dark and deep
Inside this ancient heart
You'll always be a part of me
Lulululululu
lululululululululu
Goodnight my angel
Now it's time to dream
And dream how wonderful your life will be
Someday your child may cry
And if you sing this lullabye
Then in your heart
There will always be a part of me <start> Start tearing the old man down
Run past the heather and down to the old road
Start turning the grain into the ground Roll a new leaf over
In the middle of the night there's an old man treading around in the gathered
rain
Well mister if you're going to walk on water
Could you drop a line my way
Omaha Somewhere in middle America
Get right to the heart of matters
It's the heart that matters more
I think you better turn your ticket in
And get your money back at the door
Start threading a needle
Brush past the shuttle that slides through the cold room
Start turning the wool across the wire Roll a new life over
In the middle of the night there's an old man threading his toes through a
bucket of rain
Hey mister you don't want to walk on water
Because you're going to just walk all over me
Omaha Somewhere in middle America
Get right to the heart of the matters
It's the heart that matters more
I think you better turn your ticket in
And get your money back at the door
Start running the banner down
Drop past the color come up through the summer rain
Start turning the girl into the ground Roll a new love over
In the middle of the day there's a young man rolling around in the earth and
rain
Hey Mister if you're going to walk on water
You know you're only going to walk all over me.
Omaha Somewhere in middle America
Get right to the heart of matters
It's the heart that matters more
I think you better turn your ticket in
And get your money back at the door <start> There's a heaven for you

Destroyer of hopes and dreams
Young judas fall away

Fresh meat children
Swallow those close
It's gone my innocence
Thief in the night
Do you even remember my name
It's gone my innocence <start> Do you feel wide open
Close your eyes and smile
Rest your head now it's alright
You were born before you needed
Never locked this world away
Open child
Let it know you
Make it warm make it home
Do it fast do it slow
Either way you wanna go
Just a dream we are
Focus on what's all around you
Leave your mind alone
See life working on its own
Touch the Balsa that grows above you
Buried toes in sand
We are water delicate green
Make it warm make it home
Do it fast do it slow
Either way you wanna go
Just a dream beyond
Either way you wanna go
Just a dream beyond
Either way you wanna go
Just a dream beyond <start> It's crawling with idiot
I'm itching to leave
I'm soft with fatigue I need something
I've never seen anything quite like you
In here
Come on it's not serious
I just need arms tonight
You're blue collar pride
And you're loose cotton cool
You're wilting a little
Nothing grows down here <start> Dej la estepa
cansado y aturdido
pasto de la ansiedad
no hay otros mundos
pero si hay otros ojos
aguas tranquilas
en las que fondear.
Mar antiguo madre salvaje
de abrigo incierto que acuna el olivar.
muge mi alma confusa y triste
ojos azules en los que naufragar.
Te he echado tanto de menos
patria pequea y fugaz
que al llegar cruel del norte el huracn
no se apague en tu puerto el hogar.
Mar antiguo madre salvaje
en tus orillas de rodillas rezar.
tierra absurda que me hizo absurdo
nostalgia de un futuro azul en el que anclar.
Triste y cansado con los viejos amigos
el vino y el cantar
mientras quede un olivo en el olivar
y una vela latina en el mar.
Viejos dioses olvidados
mantenednos libres de todo mal.
Mar antiguo dios salvaje
de la encina y del gris olivar. <start> Ah one two three four one two three four
At sixteen she quit high school
To make a fortune in the promised land
She got a job behind the counter
In an allnight hamburger stand
She wrote faithfully home to Mama
Now Mama don't you worry none
From small things Mama big things one day come
It was late one Friday
He pulled in outta the dark
He was tall and handsome
First she took his order then she took his heart
They bought a house on the hillside
Where little feet soon would rock
Well from small things Mama big things one day come
Oh but love is fleeting
It's sad but true
When your heart is bleeding
You don't want to hear the news
She packed her bags
And with a Wyoming County Real Estate man
She went down to Tampa
In an Eldorado Grand
She wrote back dear mama
Life is just heaven in the sun
From small things Mama big things one day come
Well she shot him dead on a sunny Florida road
And when they caught her all she said
Was she couldn't stand the way he drove
Back home dear Johnny prays for his Betty's parole
He waits high on the hillside where the lonely waters roll
At his feet and almost grown now
Blue eyed daughter and a handsome son
Well from small things Mama big things one day come
Yeah from small things Mama big things one day come <start>       
It's uncanny the way you always call
Every time I think about you
It's uncanny baby the way you always know
Just what I'm going through
Sometimes you take me by surprise
And I don't know what to say
When I'm not alone
You always find me where I lay
When you call my name and take my breath away
It's uncanny baby it's uncanny baby
Please don't you know
When I was lonely you were my friend
When I needed you you took me in girl
When I was crazy you bring me back home
When I see you I'm in love
I'm in love I'm in love again
It's hard to talk about all the trouble that I feel
And I can't always see what's fantasy
What's real
But when you call my name
The wave disappears
It's uncanny baby uncanny baby
You keep on doin' it girl
You do it to me you do it to me
When I think about you don't you know
I hear that doorbell ringing in my ear
You do it to me you do it to me
Your love's so good and interesting
Shows no sign of ending
Just keeps on taking me higher
Uncanny baby uncanny baby please girl
Uncanny baby you know it's uncanny
You know it's uncanny now
Every time every time I think about you
You know it's uncanny
Oh you always come through girl
You know it's uncanny you know it's uncanny baby

I should be sailing away on a liner
I was knocked on my back on a dock at Yangtse
It's a hell of a way to see China but I'm ready
You must be crazy
And you got no money
And you're a liar
My straits are dire from the the wok into the fire
I'd like to trust you but I've broken my rickshaw
Sometimes there's no hope in in chasing opium
I'd like to love you but I'm not sure what's in your eyes
Mm Shanghai surprise
Whatever you're saying I want it anyway in
Been hanging 'round like a kid at your back door

You could be kinder and show me Asia minor
I'll let you love me let you see what's here in my eyes
Shanghai surprise
You must be crazy

And you got no money

And it seems like madness
Back streets so crowded that no room to swing a cat
I'd like to know you but you're acting so coolie
I'm finding out pursued by evil looking dudes it's
Getting hot for me like tofu when it deep fries
Oh Shanghai surprise
But baby you look like any common crook
That's hanging 'round in those real shady places

While you assess me why not try to impress me
Step over here let me see what's there in your eyes
Oh Shanghai surprise
I don't understand how I got delayed
I should be sailing today on a liner
Was kicked in the ass on a dock at Yangtse
It's no way for a man to see China but I'm ready
You must be crazy

And you got no money

But you're a trier
My straits are dire from the the wok into the fire
I'd like to meet you but I've broken my chopstick
Sometimes there's no hope in in chasing promises
I wanna love you though it could prove to be unwise
Shanghai surprise
Whatever you're saying I want it anyway in
Been hanging 'round for a ride on your rickshaw

You may correct me now that you've inspected me
Come over here let me feel you cut down to size
Oh Shanghai surprise
My straits are dire from the the wok into the fire
I'd like to know you but I'm not really social
Sometimes it's no joke can't cope with opium
I'd like to love you but I'm not sure what's in your eyes
Shanghai surprise
Shanghai surprise Shanghai surprise
And you got no money
But you're a trier <start> I saw you last night...alone in your dreams
You were so peaceful there...or that's how it seemed
But something is wrong...you feel it inside
No one can reach you there...but still you can't hide
'Cause dreams never lie
You can't if you try
It's not often easy to wake up...sometimes
Don't say goodbye...don't say it's over
Don't say goodbye to the dreams of our love
Don't say goodbye...keep dreamin' for us
A shot in the dark...like ships in the night
So we're both older now...well that's all right
'Cause visions live on where memories have died
We've walked that road before...we'll get there this time
Now I know you tried
You tell me that you've had enough
You think it might be easier to just give up
Don't say goodbye...don't say it's over
Don't say goodbye to the dreams of our love
Don't say goodbye...lean on my shoulder
Don't say goodbye...keep dreamin' for us
Tell ya baby...I can't stop thinkin'
'Bout all those times you walked on out my door
Now I don't want you...say I don't need it
But I'll neverno never...let you go
Don't say goodbye...and don't look back
Don't say goodbye to the dreams of our love
Don't look back...and don't say why
Don't turn back...keep dreamin' for us
Don't don't oh yea
Don't don't say why
Keep on dreamin'
Keep dreamin' for us <start> Looking at her phone desk tappin her feet
The kind of girl your mama likes to meet
A Sunday school dress buttoned up tight
When the weekend comes she's like a red taillight
She likes to get outta town
Yeah she likes to get outta town
Shes got a little red rag top she just bought
Just fortyfive minutes from her two days off
Shes watching the clock just counting it down
That girl likes to get outta town
Shes got a little glove box with everything she needs
Got some red lipstick and some Mardi Gras beads
Got some party girlfriends like to keep it unwound
That girl likes to get outta town
She likes to get outta town
Yeah she likes to get outta town
They've got a motel room with a single bed
Just a singing down the road going out of their heads
Gonna turn it on up

That girl likes to get outta town

Big fun's close as the city limit sign
Yeah yeah do tell
Daddy's little angel gonna raise a little

Oh but it wont hurt em what they don't know
What goes on the road
Stays on the road
She likes to get outta town
Yeah she likes to get outta town
She was born to shake it and its not her fault
But the competition just loves to talk
Shes so tired of them putting her down
That girl likes to get outta town

Its time to crank it on up
Time to party on down
That girl likes to that girl likes to get outta town
Gonna crank it gonna crank it <start> Alright
Running on like the rising sun
Like a wild horse thundering on
Fly fly fly through the wind and storm
Now I'm running free
Heart and soul
That's my old bag
I leave behind a trial of sorrow and pain
Cry cry Lord he calls my name
Not even you could take the blame
Ride on silver horses
Drive drive past the wind
A candle burns for my tortured soul
In a chapel where she whispers my name
Pray pray pray just to pay my toll
For sins of yesterday
Ride on silver horses
Drive drive past the wind
Ride on silver horses
Drive on past my sins

Ride on silver horses
Drive drive past the wind
Ride on silver horses
Drive on past my sins <start> You look like such a mess
You better shut your gaping mouth
A little bit less than ordinary
We're full of loathing and selfdoubt
I'd like to get behind you once
To get a glimpse of that intoxicating light
And shove you all the way in it
I bet you'd hardly fight
Fourteen fiftynine
It shouldn't be too long before you die
Fourteen fiftynine
I hope it won't be long until you die
This is a hate song
Will you please shut your gaping mouth
But don't leave us out of the conversation
Yeah I know what you're all about
I'd like to get behind you once
To get a glimpse of that intoxicating light
And shove you all the way in it
I bet you'd hardly fight
Fourteen fiftynine
It shouldn't be too long before you die
Fourteen fiftynine
I hope it won't be long until you die <start> You stare through a tunnel of
Solid wall that should be broken down
And you can't see the field of green
Has been turned into a raging battleground
And you'll live with the consequence
Tell me why don't you understand
You'll destroy all the love that's been created
Be a miser with an empty hand
And it's all such a simple thing
Changing everything
Listen to the one who brings all this love to you
Some other world some other world that's where you live
Some other world some other world that's where you live
Don't you care stop and think about us and what you feel
I'll be there don't you cut yourself off from what is real
Don't live in some other world
You don't live in some other world
There's a boat bound for paradise
If you hurry you can ride it back
'Cause once the bait hits the water
It don't take long 'till the sharks attack
Oh but it's all such a simple thing
Change is everything
Let me be the one who brings all this love to you
Some other world some other world that's where you live
Some other world some other world that's where you live
Don't you care stop and think about us and what you feel
I'll be there don't you cut yourself off from what is real
Don't live in some other world in some other world
Oh you don't live in some other world in some other world
Got to stop living in some other world
Let me help you with a change of mind
And it's all such a simple thing
Changing everything
Listen to the one who brings all this love to you
This is our world not some other world
You don't live in some other world
Live in our world not some other world
You don't live in some other world <start> Winter wind is blowin' in
Makin' me feel low so low
Even though the fire's in my heart
It doesn't warm the soul
We had it all but it wasn't enough
You played a dangerous game
You made your move
Now you got to choose
Between me and the pain
You run for cover you run with another
Run for cover from me yes you do
Can't believe you got a heart of stone
It's such a cold surprise
Don't try and hide behind those empty words
It's right there in your eyes
Said you wanted to name the dance
To face the world on your own
I ain't givin' you a second chance
You gotta dance alone
You run for cover you run with another
Run for cover from me
You run for cover you're runnin' with another
Run for cover from me yes you do
Now you've had your final dance
Go face the world on your own
I ain't givin' you a second chance
Now you're all alone
You run for cover you're runnin' with another
You run for cover from me yes you do
Run for cover run with another
Run for cover from me yes you do
Run for cover run with another
Run for cover from me yes you do
Run for cover run with another
Run for cover from me yeah <start> There is a house down in New Orleans they call the rising sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl and me oh God I'm one
My mother was a tailor she sewed these new blue jeans
My sweetheart was a gambler Lord down in New Orleans
Now the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time when he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town
Oh tell my baby sister not to do what I have done
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the rising sun
Well with one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain
I'm going back to New Orleans my race is almost run
I'm going back to end my life down in the rising sun
There is a house in New Orleans they call the rising sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl and me oh God I'm one <start> Verse 
I hear it again when the fear sticks out.
Well I'm thinking about what you wanted more.
Do you think that the wind doesn't carry your words
'cause I can hear everything you say.
Well I'm thinking about how I don't want to go back
to those horrible days when we would bleed.
Chorus
Would you tear me away
Would you think about the days
all the other ways that you would bring me down
Bring me down.
Verse 
Memories cloud every thought of loving me
but you know that loving me is everything you want.
So send down the red carpet and polish the way
you know for us to reclaim.
Break
Over it's over it's over you'll see
you loved me so much when will I be free
Thinking about what you are to me
well more than just love we all really need
heavy inside you fall to your knees
living is more for tonight <start> Burn me alive
From the inside out
Your all I have
Don't let me down
Clutching my chest
Just tear it out
Useless to me...
Found faced down sprawled out across your floor
Drink your poison but you'll have to pour your own
Hold your breath won't care that I don't know
When you never come back home
Burn me alive
From the inside out
Your all I have
Don't let me down
Clutching my chest
Just tear it out
Useless to me...
Spark my heart take a breath and numb the pain
Into the tracks listen waiting for the train
Can you hear me now My screams echo in your brain
Count the stars before they fade
Burn me alive
From the inside out
Your all I have
Don't let me down
Clutching my chest
Just tear it out
Useless to me...Now...
Hold me I'm Bleeding...
Kiss me I'm Lying ... in your arms
Hold me I'm Bleeding...
Kiss me I'm Dieing ... in your arms
Burn me alive
From the inside out
Your all I have
Don't let me down
Clutching my chest
Just tear it out
Useless to me...
Burn me alive
From the inside out
Your all I have
Don't let me down
Clutching my chest
Just tear it out
Useless to me...Now... <start> You took me from my mother's lovin' arms.
I still had about a foot to grow.
Whoaooh I must have been only maybe seventeen.
It was a very long time ago.
Actually we raised each other
You our kids and myself.
You wait 'til you become a part of me
Then you wanna put me on the shelf.
Put me on a shelf
Woah that first kiss you gave me I still remember.
I was just a child dear.
Your lips were so warm and tender.
That kiss I'll always remember.
That was the first day we met.
I remember what the preacher said
'Girl will you be his wedded wife
Forever and ever
'N' stand beside that boy forever
Like for the rest of your natural life'
For the rest of your life
You took my darlin' babies from me
You really broke my heart in two
God in heaven heaven knows knows that I love them
And in your heart you know it's true
Know it's true
Oh that first kiss you gave me I still remember.
I was just a child. Your lips were so warm and tender.
That kiss oh I'll always remember.
That was the first day we met.
Always remember it's a kiss that I'll never forget
I don't remember too much about my cradle days. remember
Guess you could say I became a woman too fast. you grew up too fast too fast
Whoa what did I know That you were the right man for me. that's what I knew
What did I know I knew that I loved that man
Love that love that love that love that man
Whoa that first kiss you gave me ohoo how I still remember
I was just a child dear. Your lips were so warm and tender.
That kiss I will always remember
'Cause that was the first day we met.
The first day we met darlin' darlin' darlin' darlin'
Whoa darlin' the first day we met.

Oh how can I forget you
Branded me Scarred by your love
Remember when
That first kiss you gave me boy <start> Let's go round again
Let loose again
Off the wall again
Across the floor again
and come on in his chair
We can make believe he's there
Make our bodies answer our unspoken dread
If he walked in the room
I would slap him with his slipper
Would we laugh Would we scream
What What What What
I walk the streets again
until it's day again
I nearly try again
I'm at your door again
All your need and regret
forms a new breath of angel
Forming joy world without love
What What What
You don't understand
We don't understand

Let's play again
and we will laugh again
We'll forget it when
we let it loose again
and I gasped at the view
as we pushed it where we're going
And the words burst out
Why When What What What What
Try just again ...
What What <start> I can't see your face in my mind
I can't see your face in my mind
Carnival dogs consume the lines
Can't see your face in my mind
Don't you cry baby please don't cry
And don't look at me with your eyes
I can't seem to find the right lie
I can't seem to find the right lie
Insanity's horse adorns the sky
Can't seem to find the right lie
Carnival dogs consume the lines
Can't see your face in my mind
Don't you cry baby please don't cry
I won't need your picture until we say goodbye <start> When you're tempted by another who could thrill you through and through
Think of all the love I'm giving love I'll share with only you
Hold to my unchanging love hold to my unchanging love
Don't go looking for another hold to my unchanging love
There are men who long to hold you and they'll promise you the world
Don't be fooled by all their wooing I want you to be my girl
Baby hold to my unchanging love
Baby won't you hold to my unchanging love <start> Take my life take it all
I lay it at Your throne
I am rich satisfied when I am Yours alone
I have learned to live to lose
I have found my home in You
And I count it all as lose it true
'Cause I have learned to live to lose
Precious One crucified
Died to set me free
I hold nothing back from You
Who gave it all for me
I have learned to live to lose
I have found my home in You
And I count it all as lose it true
'Cause I have learned to live to lose
Jesus You're the One You're the only One for me
Jesus You're the One You're the only One for me
Jesus You're the One You're the only One for me
Jesus You're the One You're the only One for me
I have learned to live to lose
I have found my home in You
I count it all as lose it true
I have learned to live
Yes I have learned to live to lose
I have learned to live to lose <start> Restless little one
Comfortable and warm
Let me fall apart
Crippled in your arms
Chase me through the dark
Ready on your mark
First to reach the stars
Wins a broken heart
One that broke apart
Shattered from the start
Are you there
Do you read me
Are you there
I don't feel you anymore
Cages and alarms
Keeping us from harm
I will be the guard
Hope to rest upon
Could I be the one
To break a will so strong
Pray it won't be long
Til your will is gone
Everything is done
Nothing left at all
Are you there
Do you read me
Are you there
I don't feel you anymore
Are you there
Will you give in
Are you there
If I give out
Over and out
Cages and alarms
Keeping us from harm
I will be the guard
Hope to rest upon
Everything is done
Nothing left at all
Are you there
Do you read me
Are you there
I don't feel you anymore
Are you there
Will you give in
Are you there
If I give out <start> My mother was just  all alone with a son of gun she roamed
Spent some nights sleeping in our car cheap hotels and seedy bars
As it came to pass so was my road
She's a goodhearted woman with a heart of gold that always understands
That good hearted woman is making life the best way she can
My grandaddy said when I was  boy I raised you on that the Southern pride and so
Taught me how to fish and how to fight when I was wrong and what was right
But the greatest story that he ever told
Was of a goodhearted woman with a heart of gold that always understands
That good hearted woman is making life the best way she can
Pretty wife and fancy cars I've paid my dues and got some scars to say
There ain't a thing that I regret and I hope to laugh at all of this
When I'm sitting on my front porch old and gray
With my goodhearted woman with a heart of gold that always understands
My good hearted woman is making life the best way she can
My good hearted woman sure loves a hardheaded man <start> You know I woke up this mornin' people
The first thing I did was to look into your eyes
And in that space where I used to find so much truthfulness
There was a stone cold pack of lies
You know that somethin' goin' on
Somethin' goin' on but I don't know what it is
Somethin's goin' on people
All right
I went on down to the mailbox
Seems I got the phone bill yesterday
Charging me for some hour conversation
From someone in L.A.
I know there's somethin' goin' on
Somethin' goin' on but I don't know what it is
Somethin' goin' on behind my back
I better get to the bottom of this
Now wait a minute I wanna hear you blow now
Go ahead go ahead I want you to blow for all the men
Whose women who don't keep a true love now
I want you to blow for all the people who have to face an empty bed now
Go ahead blow one for yourself blow one for me too
Yeah listen you got to love your woman in the morning
You got to love your woman every night
You got to love your woman all the time and make her feel all right
You got to give her what she wants
When she wants it how she wants it
And anytime she might think she wants it
Ah when your lovin' your woman people
Both you know the score
You know it makes a longtime man suspicious
To come home to an unlocked door
Your bound to know somethin' goin' on
Somethin' goin' on but you don't know what it is
Somethin' goin' on people
I better get to the bottom of this look out <start> I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
A guaranteed personality
I wasn't born so much as I fell out
Nobody seemed to notice me
We had a hedge back home in the suburbs
Over which I never could see
I heard the people who lived on the ceiling
Scream and fight most scarily
Hearing that noise was my first ever feeling
That's how it's been all around me
I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
A guaranteed personality
I'm all tuned in I see all the programs
I save coupons from packets of tea
I've got my giant hit Disco tech album
I empty a bottle and I feel a bit free
The kids in the halls and the pipes in the walls
Making noises for company
Long distance callers make long distance calls
And the silence makes me lonely
I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
A guaranteed personality
I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
A guaranteed personality

I'm all lost in the supermarket

I can no longer shop happily

I came in here for the special offer

A guaranteed personality
I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
A guaranteed personality <start> I'm so tired of being alone
I'm so tired of on my own
Won't you help me girl
Just as soon as you can.
People say that I've found a way
To make you say
That you love me.
But baby
You didn't go for that
Ha it's a natural fact
That I want to come back
Show me where it's at baby.
I'm so tired of being alone
I'm so tired of on my own
Won't you help me girl
Soon as you can.
I guess you know that I uh
I love you so
Even though
You don't want me no more
Hey hey hey hey I'm cryin' tears
Through the years
I tell you like it is
Honey love me if you can.
Ya baby
Tired of being alone here by myself now
I tell ya I'm tired baby
I'm tired of being all wrapped up late at night
In my dreams nobody but you baby.
Sometimes I wonder
If you love me like you say you do
You see baby I I I I've been thinking about you
I've been wanting to get next to you baby
Sometimes I hold my arms and I say
Oh baby yeah needing you has proven to me
To be my greatest dream yeah
Awh <start> Who was it who asked about the last mile being the hardest mile
Trying not to spend more time looking back
There's still a bit more to go
Can't stop measuring strike outs to home runs
Trying to justify these compromises that have piled up and dulled my blade
Maybe we stayed too long didn't say enough swing hard enough
The years just sort of ran away
And the ones that follow won't be as fun
I'll never love anything else the way that I loved this
So you know its not gonna be easy
To just let go
But the credits they will roll
It's getting harder and harder
To give too much of my body and soul to a mess overrun by morons and thugs
Who's only purpose is to break this not hard enough to make it
Fighting on their own
We stand bound and gagged as they pee on our rug
The end result of not a single motherfucker willing to take the hard road
Makes it easier to watch as the door swings slowly shut
Then there are those I'll carry with me forever live deep in my chest
Watched as you took your last breath on that floor in WilkesBarre
The room loved you so deeply our hearts broke as you faded
And i can never repay the lesson you left me as we rolled outta town that night <start> I heard a rumor that you
died and went to hell but
it was too cold for you and
you never kiss and tell
So you came back up to me
just lookin' for something to do
now aren't you glad you found me
Have I got just the thing for you
Put your dirty love in a ball
and bounce it off me
Push me up against the dirty wall
and squeeze it out of me
My stance is too wide for that stall
Are you gonna out me
Put your dirty love in a ball
and bounce it off me
Your face was a petunia
Your body was glistening
I tried and tried to tell ya'
but you weren't listening
You don't seem like yourself
IS something wrong with you
Cause I've got just the thing
to turn your grey skies to blue
Put your dirty love in a ball
and bounce it off me
Push me up against the dirty wall
and squeeze it out of me
My stance is too wide for that stall
Are you gonna out me
Put your love into a dirty ball
and bounce it off me
Cool times and tasty love await you
Good vibes and Budweiser invade you
Thank god my ball will never hate you
Bounce
Bounce
Like a dog that don't come when ya call
So goes my bouncing dirty ball
When love gets angry and love gets mean
You'll need a ball that's never clean
Like a double down when stakes are high
My dirty ball will never die
When love consumes you in its fire
Let the bouncing ball bounce you higher
Let the bouncing ball bounce you higher
Let the bouncing ball bounce you higher
Let the bouncing ball bounce you higher
Let the bouncing ball bounce you higher
Put your dirty love in a ball
and bounce it off me
Push me up against the dirty wall
and squeeze it out of me
My stance is too wide for that stall
Are you gonna out me
Put your love into a dirty ball
and bounce it off me
Cool times and tasty love await you
Good vibes and Budweiser invade you
Thank god my ball will never hate you
Thank god my ball will never hate you
Thank god my ball will never hate you
Thank god my ball will never hate you
Thank god my ball will never hate you
Thank god my ball will never hate you
Thank god my ball will never hate you
Thank god my ball will never hate you
Thank god my ball will never hate you
Thank god my ball will never hate you
Thank god my ball will never hate you
Lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala
Never hates you
My ball will never hate you
It never hates you <start> Thought I was awful tough
Been knocked down in the dust
A few more times than I would care to say
Then you came blowin' in
Like that old Texas wind
And girl you blew my heart away
Oh I've tamed wild horses
Rode the meanest bulls
Broke a few bones
And kept my cool
Baby I've been thrown
A time or two
And I thought I'd fallen hard
'Til I fell for you
I know it's dangerous
To take a chance on love
That's why I never dared to get too close
Then deep inside my heart
You had to go and start
A feeling I just can't control
Oh I've tamed wild horses
Rode the meanest bulls
Broke a few bones
And kept my cool
Baby I've been thrown
A time or two
And I thought I'd fallen hard
'Til I fell for you
The way you look at me
Makes this cowboy weak
I'd try to walk away
But I ain't got the strength
Oh I've tamed wild horses
Rode the meanest bulls
Broke a few bones
And kept my cool
Baby I've been thrown
A time or two
And I thought I'd fallen hard
'Til I fell for you
And I thought I'd fallen hard
'Til I fell for you
'Til I fell for you <start> Pat we need your brains back
Pat we need your fire and your imagination
Pat we know you fucked up
But we don't care you fucked up everybody's fucked up
Thought I heard your voice the other night
And sure enough it came from you
Thought I'd be surprised that you weren't dead
But all I was was glad
Just sitting by your bed
And talking to your head
And hearing what you said
As if you'd never left
Can't you see yourself yet can't you see through our eyes
Can't you see the truth
Nothing's worse than ever falling in a dream's where
We can see each other
Saw you the other night
Have to say something wasn't right
Of course but I didn't mind
'Cause seeing you being all alive
Just walking in the room made me so relieved
Like everything was fine and you had never died
Or secondguessed your mind or gave up on our trust
Thought you'd gone too far for us to take you back
But distances like that Pat don't exist in fact <start> The long gone breezes are blowing down the sky.
From my window to the street I cast my weary eye.
Everything is quiet in the lonesome dusky night.
I'm feeling so alone in the darkness of my night.
I remember the days when the sun was warm with love
Softening as the day grew old in dazzling streaks of gold.
Now my days are bleek the sunset's the cruellest time
I'm feeling so alone in the darkness of my night.
I feel I want to ramble to the shores of the mighty sea
Pounding in my ears the wind so wild and free
To stumble in the high grass the sand aglowin' white
My eyes they fill they break and spill the darkness of my night.
My sorrow is confusing my love will never know
My empty hands they lie down by my sides so low
I walk this sleeping town and the highway inbetween bright
I'm feeling so alone in the darkness of my night.
Riding feathered wings to make like I'm a dove
Oft I've heard the world as it cries out for some love
Cries out for some warmth a little compassion and light
They're feeling so alone in the darkness of their night. <start> Originally by Descendents
I'm not a cool guy anymore
As if I ever was before
I took a look at all the signs
Then rolled it over in my mind
The feelings I could not release
Became a bitter part of me
What was I thinking of
It couldn't stay the way it was
I looked at my reflection And I saw a stranger's face
I saw where I was going and had to walk away
I lost a girl it's just as well
She tried to save me from myself
I've still got her on my mind
Tossing and turning in my bed
But if she had stayed another week
I would have dragged her down with me
She took it till she had enough
Is that what I thought love was
I told her See you later But it's hard to see at all
At the bottom of the barrel
With your back against the wall
I'm not a cool guy anymore
Left it behind and locked the door
I know you can't escape the past
Now I look back and have to laugh
I was my worst enemy
It almost got the best of me
What was I thinking of
It couldn't stay the way it was
I looked up one day and saw it was up to me
You can only be a victim if you admit defeat <start> When I wake up in the morning
And the clock gives out a warning
I don't think I'll ever make it on time
By the time I GRAB my books I give myself a look
I'm at the corner just in time to see the bus fly by
It's alright cause I'm saved by the bell
If the teacher pops a test I know I'm a mess
And my dog ate all my homework last night
if i sit low in my chair she won't know that I'm there
If I can hand it in tomorrw it'll be alright
It's alright 'cause I'm saved by the.
It's alright 'cause I'm saved by the .
It's alright 'cause I'm saved by the bell. <start> May Day
 <start> Lost out of control
Nowhere to run  terra firma 
Losing all time of living in this world
No chance gone insane
We're living in a dead man's world
Time seems to fade away
Further everyday  terra firma 
Losing all time of living in this world
No chance gone insane
We're living in a dead man's world
Eyes to eyes
In a battle of lost control
Lead our world
Knowing that the bomb is going to blow
Feel the world come to mend
Images  ill repent  violent remedy
Feel the world come to end
Violent remedy 
Mass confusion
Dying are the people that lost their soul
Dying for the people of minds of stone
They rot  they rot
Dying are the people that lost their soul  the blood
Dying for the people of minds of stone  the blood
Feel the world come to mend
Images  ill repent  violent remedy
Feel the world come to end
Violent remedy 
Eyes to eyes
In a battle of lost control
Lead our world
Knowing that the bomb is going to blow
Lost out of control
Nowhere to run  terra firma 
Losing all time of living in this world
No chance gone insane <start> Cruel bagged then snagged is how I want things done
I want the best in my life and I will please anyone
I'm strapped into this chair watching TV that's aired
Live across the globe I smell
Throw your attention over here I've got nothing to say
It won't change your life but that's cool these days
And now an ad is on the show is gone
From the box in front of me
My eyes are burning radiation
From the microwave that's on
It's cooking my meal it's a TV dinner
And I think it's fake veal
You can't burn it in the microwave
And if I did hey I would order out anyway
You can't burn it in the microwave
And if I did
You've been created from an image of love
You've been created in an image of God
You've been created from an image of love
You've been created in an image of God
You've been created from an image of love
Too complex I go to rest I can't seem to get things done
Well I'm a woman with a mouth and I'm prepared to switch it on
I've just come back from all this walking 'cause I'm losing weight
Was talking with a friend of Sharon's mum fat was in out I looked dumb
I saw myself in the mirror and I guess I'm getting thinner
I've been taking all the pills I better eat some meals
But what's the point
Will I see clearer or will I be bigger
You've been created in an image of love
You've been created from an image of God
You've been created in an image of love
You've been created from an image of God
You've been created in an image of love
You've been created you've been created
You've been created you've been created
I go to church every Sunday but when it comes Monday
I'm back at work where I scream and curse
I talk real dirty to people make them think I'm real cool
My life's so simply complex
I leave small groups are on but what is that
As I slam down the phone
You've been created from an image of love
You've been created in an image of God

In that very special way
Oh oh oh it's true
You fell for me too

It's not a trick at all
You taught it to me too
Exactly what you do
And now you love me too
Oh oh oh it's true
We're in love we two
And when I tried it

Does she really love me I think she does

Because when the sky is bright

And I think we're over the storm
Well I been pickin' it up around me

Do you really love me

Everything's all right <start> Een beweging een ogenblik
we zijn hier samen jij en ik
In mijn kop knippert een lichtje aan en uit
Als in een stomme film
dus enkel beeld en geen geluid
Mijn hersens niet mijn herder
Is dit mijn hand telkens ietsje verder
Die hand beweegt maar ligt noch stil
En ik weet niet wat ik ermee wil
Wil ik je strelen of liever een glas
Om vast te houden aan wie ik was
Mijn hersens niet mijn merder
Is dit jouw hand telkens ietsje verder
Ik voel het nu
Ik raak de wereld aan
Ik voel het nu
Het is nooit gedaan
Altijd vanavond
Onder de hemel
Altijd vanavond
Onder de hemel
Mn ogen open m'n ogen dicht
Zo is het donker zo is het licht
De wereld draait draait om een spil
Alles beweegt alles staat stil

And it's going round
Can you hear it on the street
If you realize that the pleasure lies
Between surrender and the heat
Just take a walk
On the wild side babe
And I'll meet you halfway there
And if you're talking about paradise
There's no need to say a prayer
'Cause baby I'll take you there
Hey girl
Haven't you heard
Heaven is a four letter word
One touch is never enough
You'll find out when you enter the world
Heaven is a four letter word
Lose your innocence
For experience
But you've got to take the chance
Can you rock and roll
Can you get down babe
Cause it's tough for you to dance
Don't need to ride in a limousine
To feel like a millionaire
And if you're talking 'bout fantasy
It could happen anywhere
Baby I'll take you there
Hey girl
Haven't you heard
Heaven is a four letter word
One touch is never enough

Looking for something
Tired of everything
Searching and struggling
Are you worried about it
Do you wanna talk about it
Oh You're gonna get it right some time
There's so much to be scared of
And not much to make sense of
Are you running in a circle
You can't be too careful
And you can't relate it
'Cause it's complicated
Oh You're gonna get it right some time
You're gonna get it right some time
It's how you see the world
How many times can you see
You can't believe what you learn
It's how you see the world
Don't you worry yourself
Your not gonna get hurt
Oh
Is there something missing
There's nobody listening
Are you scared of what you don't know
don't wanna end up on your own
You need conversation
And information
Oh
Gonna get it right sometimes
You just wanna get it right sometimes
It's how you see the world
How many times have you heard
You can't believe a word
It's how you see the world
Don't you worry yourself
'Cause nobody can learn

Sometimes you walk alone there's no one else around
Don't care about the rules there telling me
I know that things aren't always what they seem
I want something more
You could be what I've been looking for
Drinking like this just you and I
Living each moment passing by
Watching the starlight in the sky
I want something more
I want something more
Sometimes your heart gets buried underneath
Sometimes your soul is just a raging see
I saw your face under the northern lights
And if you ask I couldn't tell you why
I want something more
You could be what I've been looking for
Drinking like this just you and I
Living each moment passing by
Watching the starlight in the sky
I want something more

Sometimes the dreams you have are burning down
Sometimes you walk alone there's no one else around
Sometimes you walk alone sometimes your walk alone
I don't want to walk alone I want you to take me home
I want something more
You could be what I've been looking for
Drinking like this just you and I

Watching the starlight in the sky

itsumo me no mae wa tozasareteita no
aitai aenai hibi wo kasaneru tabi ni

Unable to move forward across just a little more distance
The way I see before me is always blocked
Every time the days I want to see you but can't pile up
My strong heartbeat turns into heartbreak.
moshimo eien to yuu mono ga aru nara
toomawari shite demo shinjite mitai
bukiyou dakara KIZUtsuku koto mo aru to

If there is such a thing as eternity
I want to believe even if I have to take the long way.
Although I know that I've been hurt before because I'm clumsy
I won't stop I won't give in to anyone.

I always always wish
that these fleeting thoughts

I've known all too well about pretending to be strong.
But since then my doubts have vanished.

And so many words I want to hear
I want to see all sides of you when you laugh and cry
So I'll stop waiting
and seize my chance.

under the stars
Do you know we exist
Have you forgotten the keys
to the kingdom
Have you been borne yet
 are you alive
Let's reinvent the gods all teh myths
of the ages
Celebrate symbols from deep elder forests
Have you forgotten the lessons
of the ancient war
We need great golden copulations
The fathers are cackling in trees
of the forest
Our mother is dead in the sea
Do you know we are being led to
slaughters by placid admirals
 that fat slow generals are getting
obscene on young blood
Do you know we are ruled by T.V.
The moon is dry blood beast
Guerrilla bands are rolling numbers
in the next block of green vine
amassing for warfare on innocent
herdsman who are just dying
O great creator of being
grant us one more hour to
perform our art
 perfect our lives
The moths  atheists are doubly divine
 dying
We live we die
 death not ends it
Journey we more into the
Nightmare
Cling to life
Our passion'd flower
Cling to Cunts  cocks
of despair
We got our final vision
by clap
Columbus groin got
filled wgreen death

We have assembled inside this ancient
 insane theatre
To propagate our lust for life
 flee the swarming wisdom
of the streets
The barns are stormed
The windows kept
 only one of all the rest
To dance  save us
Wthe divine mockery
of words
Music inflames temperament

Where are the feasts
we are promised
Where is the wine
The New Wine

resident mockery
give us an hour for magic
We of the purple glove
We of the starling flight
 velvet hour
We of arabic pleasures's breed
We of sundome  the night
Give us creed
To believe
A nightr of lust
Give us trust in
The Night
Give of color
hundred hues
a rich mandala
for me  for you
 for your silky
pillowed house
a head wisdom
 a bed
Troubled decree
Resident mockery
has claimed thee
We used to believe
in the good old days
We still receive
In little ways
The things of Kindness
 unsporting brow
Forget  allow
Did you know freedom exists
in school books
Did you know madmen are
running our prisons
win a jail win a gaol
win a white free protestant
maelstrom
We're perched headlong
on the edge of boredom
We're reaching for death
on the end of a candle
We're trying for something
that's already found us
Wow I'm sick of doubt
Live in the light of certain
south
Cruel bindings
The sevants have the power
dogmen  their mean women
pulling poor blankets over
our sailors
I'm sick of dour faces
Starong at me from the T.V.
Tower I want roses in
my garden bower dig
Royal babies rubies
must now replace aborted
Strangers in the mud
These mutants bloodmeal
for the plant that's plowed
they are waiting to take us into
the severed garden
Do you know how pale  wanton thrillful
comes death on a stranger hour
unannounced unplanned for
like a scaring overfriendly guest you've
brought to bed
Death makes angels of us all
 gives us wings
where we had shoulders
smooth as raven's
claws
No more money no more fancy dress

until its other jaw reveals incest
 loose obedience to a vegetable law

You see me with that black dog
You know that's when you walk into my ghetto
Cause its Hungary and no ones let in

you walk into my ghetto
my ghetto sucks in sad bad trash slaps you on the back and says howdy glad you could come on down
my ghettos gonna treat right
The sunshine rolls in with bad timing
My ghetto gets horny and it sucks you in
Cause were all tripped out and no ones let in
My ghetto gets desperate and it drags you in

Stay with me stay with me

I gotcha where I want'cha and I'm never gonna let'cha

Or if it's gone
Off centered when the world is spinning
Makes you dizzy right in the beginning

Another dreamless state
Another whispered cry
A love that died
A hollow face
Another diamondback girl
Another death in the world
Another open wound
A bleeding smile

Another demon heart
I've got to kiss it quick
'Cause if I linger too long
My soul is gone
The devil denied
Oh it's on
With a hint of her blood
She goes
Oh it's on
With the speed of a gun
She's off
Another dead embrace
A big kiss of mace
Another rush of hell
Makes me start to swell
Another dead embrace
Another dead embrace
Oh it's on
With a hint of her blood
She goes
Oh it's on
With the speed of a gun
She's off
A glance of evil grace
A look of mock disgrace
Another soulless dance
Where minds collide
Another devil denied
Another devil denied
Oh it's on
With a hint of her blood
She goes
Oh it's on
With the speed of a gun
She's goes
Oh it's on
With a hint of her blood
She goes
Oh it's on
With the speed of a gun
She's goes <start> Search my heart search my mind
Search my soul
Make me clean make me new
Make me whole
All of my plans all of my dreams
I lay them down before Your feet
All of my time all that was mine
I now submit to Your design
'Cause You are the one and only one
Who dared to give it all away for me
You dared to give it all away for me
You are my strength You are my God
You are my King
You make me laugh You make me dance
You make me sing
All of my plans all of my dreams
I lay them down before Your feet
All of my time all that was mine
I now submit to Your design
'Cause You are the one and only one
Who dared to give it all away for me
You dared to give it all away for me
Everything inside everything outside
I give it all away
You never change but You rearrange
My heart more everyday
All of my plans all of my dreams
I lay them down before Your feet
All of my time all that was mine
I now submit to Your design
All of my plans all of my dreams
I lay them down before Your feet
All of my time all that was mine
I now submit to Your design
'Cause You are the one
Who can make my life complete
You are the one
Who can give light to my feet
You are the one and only one
Who dared to give it all away for me
You dared to give it all away for me
You dared to give it all away
You gave it all away for me
You gave it all away for me
Search my heart search my mind
Search my soul <start> Hear the coyote howl
He's found his prey at last
In one moment of weakness
The chase is over so fast
He celebrates his kill
No mercy in his eyes
When you're born with the hunger
The hunger never dies
Midnight is on the prowl
And I hear it call my name
Danger lurks in the shadows
But it's all part of a game
Until I quench this thirst
I will not close these eyes
When you're born with the hunger
The hunger never dies
You and I we're the same
We both carry this flame
To depths of our souls
Once this fever awakes
We can never escape
It's beyond our control
We're all born with the hunger
We're all born with the hunger
Temptation bites your lip
One kiss ignites the fire
So begins the seduction
As we succumb to desire
Your body aches for more
Why are you so surprised
When you're born with the hunger
The hunger never dies
When you're born with the hunger
The hunger  it never dies <start> Para ahuyentar la soledad
Para espantar la decepcin
Porqu estas ansias de vivir
No caben en una cancin
Porqu no importa el porvenir
Cremos en el rock 'n roll
Por eso estamos aqu
Equivocados o no
Y dime sientes lo mismo
Y dime si estas conmigo
O contra mi o contra mi
Porque la misma confusin
La sientes tu la siento yo
Yo me limito a seguir
La ley de mi corazn
Y dime si sientes lo mismo
Y dime si estas conmigo
O contra mi o contra mi
Y dime si sientes lo mismo
Y dime si estas conmigo
Y dime si sientes lo mismo
Y dime si estas conmigo
O contra mi
Porque estas ansias de vivir
No caben en una cancin
Que me importa el porvenir
Cremos en el rock 'n roll
Un vuelo kamikaze a la eternidad
Estela de su paso quedara
Y dime si
Y dime si <start> Hoy tengo miedo de salir otra vez
Tengo miedo de encontrarte como aquella vez
Los nervios me traicionan me derrota el stress
S que puedo arrepentirme despus
Hoy tengo miedo de salirte a buscar
Tengo miedo de poderte encontrar
Tengo miedo de tus ojos tengo miedo de hablar
Tengo miedo de quererte besar
Me digo no seas tonto
No seas tan escptico
No trates de escapar
Hoy tengo miedo de volver a bailar
Tengo miedo que te puedas burlar
Me dan miedo las personas no quiero manejar
Tengo miedo que me pueda gustar
Hoy tengo miedo de salir otra vez
Tengo miedo de volver a caer
Me dan miedo las mentiras ya no tengo ms f
Tengo miedo de volver a creer
Y digo no seas tonto
No seas tan escptico
No trates de escapar
No todos son tan malos no todo est mal
No todos son villanos querindote matar
No todo est perdido ni se va a acabar
La vida es un picnic
No todo son tan malos no todo est mal
No todos son villanos querindote matar
No todo est perdido ni se va a acabar
La vida es un picnic
Y digo no seas tonto
No seas tan escptico
No trates de escapar
No todos son tan malos no todo est mal
No todos son villanos querindote matar
No todo est perdido ni se va a acabar
La vida es un picnic
No todo son tan malos no todo est mal
No todos son villanos querindote matar
No todo est perdido ni se va a acabar
La vida es un picnic <start> Now I I want out of the circus
Since the girl in the blue sparkly dress
On one knee I confessed
Put an end to that exchange of glances
Now I I want out of the circus
That old gang of dwarfs
Sometimes they're downright feral
When they they've been around that old beer barrel
The old lion's teeth
Seems like a smile to me
With some sweet relief
I just stick my head in
Now my tale it's too ordinary
For anyone to care at all
Not like the man repeatedly struck by lightning
When he bears his scars we all know <start> You should've seen
By the look in my eyes baby
There was somethin' missin'
You should've known
By the tone of my voice maybe
But you didn't listen
You played dead but you never bled
Instead you lay still in the grass
All coiled up and hissin'
And though I know all about those men
Still I don't remember
'Cause it was us baby way before then
And we're still together
And I meant every word I said
When I said that I love you I meant
That I love you forever
And I'm gonna keep on lovin' you
'Cause it's the only thing I wanna do
I don't wanna sleep
I just wanna keep on lovin' you
And I meant every word I said
When I said that I love you I meant
That I love you forever
And I'm gonna keep on lovin' you
'Cause it's the only thing I wanna do
I don't wanna sleep
I just wanna keep on lovin' you <start> It takes a hundred miles of love
To heal a mile of pain
I never say goodbye to the sea
I never blow out a flame
And I've got white lies for dark times
And I don't need your crutch
I'm kicking out the stained glass windows
And I'm tender to the touch
Shimmer and shine
We leave it all behind
Shimmer and shine
When you tell me that you're mine
Shimmer and shine shimmer and shine
Bring me the music for the revolution
It puts my mind at ease to know
We're the problem we're the solution
The cure and the disease
But life is trying to force me force me to trust
I've done all I can I'll do what I must
Shimmer and shine
We leave it all behind
Shimmer and shine
When you tell me that you're mine
We shimmer and shine
Shimmer and shine <start> Never been the kind to stay at home
Even when I'm feeling down
So every night I go out on the town
Circulating around
Well I thought I could forget about you
But every night I find
It's not as easy as I thought it would be
To dance you out of my mind
You've got me dancin' with tears in my eyes
Dancin' with tears in my eyes
You've got me dancin' with a hurt in my soul
I can't control my emotions
Ever since we said our goodbyes
Don't you know you can find me any old time
Dancin' with tears in my eyes
Dancin' with tears in my eyes
Dancin' with tears in my eyes
Dancin' with tears in my eyes
Now anything can happen in this day and age
Just take a look at me
My body keeps moving to the happy beat
While my spirit's in misery
You can't see it with the strobe lights flashing
No I don't look out of place
But there's a whole different picture you'll see of me
When you get a look at my face
You'll see me dancin' with tears in my eyes
Dancin' with tears in my eyes
You'll see me dancin' with a hurt in my soul
I can't control my emotions
Ever since we said our goodbyes
Don't you know you can find me you know you can find me
Don't you know you can find me any old time
Dancin' with tears in my eyes
Dancin' with tears in my eyes
Dancin' with tears in my eyes
Dancin' with tears in my eyes <start> Divided soul
Of a troubled man
The final fight
The final need to understand
These tangled roots
Ripped from the ground
Abandonment and worry
Forever to be found
Rain rain rain
Take this hand of sorrow
Take away my darkest days
Rain rain rain
Take away my darkest days
Return me for I feel they're here to stay
For just one moment
Of peace I long to know
I can see the storm clouds
Calling me back home
The blood of the hurricane
Where the water is never still
Life is a loaded gun
Love is a bullet that sometimes kills
Rain rain rain
Take this hand of sorrow
Take away my darkest days
Rain rain rain
Take away my darkest days
Return me for I feel they're here to stay
Take you far away
Rain rain rain
Take this hand of sorrow
Take away my darkest days
Rain rain rain
Take away my darkest days
Return me for I feel they're here to stay <start> Calm animals expect nothing
Live suspicious to balance out
The effect of reason on their sunrise
There's a moving hide
Calm animals with no shackles
Free on a shrinking plain
So presented it's economics
Small wonder the pastures die
Calm calm calm calm animals
Free on a shrinking plain
Calm calm calm
Adventures to roam alone
So civilized the code stifles
A race with gestures has lost its way
The chance was given to think social
But we choke on greed and excess
Going by going by
Just for politics we live the lie
You cry we cry
Part of history will wonder why <start> algunas veces vuelvo a recordar
lamento tanto que sea asi
perdoname si alguna vez
yo te llege a incomodar
pero de estar sin ti prefiero
prefiero no respiraaar...
y si algun dia te acuerdas de mi
sabes que siempre estare aqui
aun que entiendo mui bien
para ti soi alguien mas
no te eh dicho la verdad
pero no quieres ablar...
sinceramente no se que paso
asi de facil termino
es tanto el miedo de no verte mas
y de no poderte besar
aun que entiendo mui bien
para ti soi alguien mas
no te eh dicho la verdad
pero no quieres ablar.
y la verdad es que no pienso
en nadie mas te quiero tanto
que no dejo de pensar
en tiiiiiiiii...
entiendo mui bien
para ti soi alguien mas
cuando tu te vas no es facil
poder respirar
pero si asi eres feliz
mejor no quiero molestar... <start> When I walk
A thousand miles from home
And when I've lost
All I used to know
It seems that I've got nothing left
I find that I'm undone
You are here to break me
And you've only just begun
With open arms
You came running so far
To show who you are and who I am
Only you can change a heart
Like a shooting star
You soar through the darkest of nights
To catch my eyes and guide me to the father's arms
When I wonder
Where you're leading me
With no direction
Walking aimlessly
Still you're ever faithful
Still you're ever strong
Now I can call you father
You're calling me back home
With open arms
You came running so far
To show who you are and who I am
Only you can change a heart
Like a shooting star
You soar through the darkest of nights
To catch my eyes and guide me to the father's arms
You're arms they're always wrapped around me
You're arms they'll never cease to hold me
Hold Me
With open arms
You came running so far
To show who you are and who I am
Only you can change a heart
Like a shooting star
You soar through the darkest of nights
With open arms
You came running so far
To show who you are and who I am
Only you can change a heart
Like a shooting star
You soar through the darkest of nights
To catch my eyes and guide me to the father's arms <start> It was many years ago by the sounding sea
There lived a maiden known as Annabel Lee
And she fell in love with the mariner
What he said lingers in her memory
She heard him say
Long ago in the kingdom by the sounding sea
For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
Of the beautiful beautiful Annabel Lee
And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes
Of the beautiful beautiful Annabel Lee
And the Chosen One sailed away on the sounding sea
Leaving behind the Darling Annabel Lee
Every night I sing his words before the sea
For I am what is left from Annabel
Annabel Lee
Long ago in the kingdom by the sounding sea
For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
Of the beautiful beautiful Annabel Lee
And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes
Of the beautiful beautiful Annabel Lee
And so at the night tide
I lie down by the sea
Where my Darling my Darling set my soul aside
In my sepulchre there by the sea
In my tomb by the sounding sea <start> Come to the door Ma and unlock the chain
I was just passin' through and got caught in the rain
There's nothin' I want nothin' that you need say
Just let me lie down for a while and I'll be on my way
I was no more than a kid when you put me on the Southern Queen
With the police on my back I fled to New Orleans
I fought in the dockyards and with the money I made
I knew the fight was my home and blood was my trade
Baton Rouge Ponchatoula and Lafayette town
Well they paid me their money Ma I knocked the men down
I did what I did well it come easily
Restraint and mercy Ma were always strangers to me
I fought champion Jack Thompson in a field full of mud
Rain poured through the tent to the canvas and mixed with our blood
In the twelfth I slipped my tongue over my broken jaw
I stood over him and pounded his bloody body into the floor
Well the bell rang and rang and still I kept on
'Till I felt my glove leather slip 'tween his skin and bone
Then the women and the money came fast and the days I lost track
The women red the money green but the numbers were black
I fought for the men in their silk suits to lay down their bets
I took my good share Ma I have no regrets
Then I took the fix at the state armory with big John McDowell
From high in the rafters I watched myself fall
As they raised his arm my stomach twisted and the sky it went black
I stuffed my bag with their good money and I never looked back
Understand in the end Ma every man plays the game
If you know me one different then speak out his name
Ma if my voice now you don't recognize
Then just open the door and look into your dark eyes
I ask of you nothin' not a kiss not a smile
Just open the door and let me lie down for a while
Now the gray rain's fallin' and my ring fightin's done
So in the work fields and alleys I take all who'll come
If you're a better man than me then just step to the line
Show me your money and speak out your crime
Now there's nothin' I want Ma nothin' that you need say
Just let me lie down for a while and I'll be on my way
Tonight in the shipyard a man draws a circle in the dirt
I move to the center and I take off my shirt
I study him for the cuts the scars the pain
Man nor time can erase
I move hard to the left and I strike to the face <start> Ricky Wilson drivin' like a sports car
God I want you like a fuel engine
Energized line like a road
You ride me
Like a road
You ride me
Foot on the peddle
Feet in the air
Sand in my hair
Oh don't look back
Don't look behind you
Reckless drivin' on
Dirty back Road

If the sun refused to shine
And your love's no longer mine
And if I never get no more snow
I couldn't care if the winds don't blow
She said to satisfy my soul don't you carry on
And love me all morning and love me when I get home
Love me all morning and love me when I get home
You know that time won't wait
And pretty soon it's gonna be too late
Still you're drivin' me insane

Love me all morning and love me when I get home
She said love me all morning and love me when I get home

Gettin' funky in here
Now here we go
Whoo
Ah come on
Ha ha
Ah come on
Fields of glory straight ahead
But you veerin' to the left
Why don't you pick your ass up off the ground
'Cause you'll never know what's next
Sometimes you go uptown nun out of money
And ain't live all kinds of funny
Justify don't analyze the possibilities

It's been a long time
Been a long time coming

So get ready get ready

So get your shit together
Pussyfootin' like a feather
Ain't no time to stop halfway
Get ready
Haha
Ah come on
Spread your wings and don't look back
'Cause you're better off that way
And when your train heads off the track
You know there's hell to pave
I said great expectations
So make your reservations
Change is coming
So you better start running running running
Whoo

It's been a long time
Been a long time coming

Whoo
I said get ready get ready

Whoo
So get your shit together
Pussyfootin' like a feather
Ain't no time to stop halfway
Hoo yeah <start> Good eats smells tickled my nose
In the morning as the sun rose
Had a great big bite of green tail
But I couldn't chew through those tough scales
So I called up el Vaca de Spacio
He taught me cow so I finally know
How to say moo on the moon
Heart beats fast in my caffeine dream
I can't sleep in my caffeine dream
Palms get wet in my caffeine dream
Open up my eyes caffeine dream
They told me that it could not be done
But I made headlines when I froze the sun
And sold scoops of it for .
Yeah it's spicy but the taste's divine
It was so cold we set the moon on fire
Through the icy air came the angel's choir
Singing Hey who burned the cheese <start> Heavy eyes heavier skin
Can't describe this place that I'm in
Don't look down don't look back
Can't lose hope can't lose track
Reach inside pull out the cold
'Cause I get tired and that gets old
I'm not scared my head's on straight
It's right here and I can't wait
Yesterday so far away
Tomorrow so far to go
I can't stay no time for fun
The long road awaits
And I'm on the run
I'm on the run
Last in line first to the red
Distant light somewhere ahead
All alone caught in between
The world gets cold and I get mean
The world wakes up the light's so strong
The daylight fades it won't be long
The night gets dark and I get wild
I can't help it that's my style
Yesterday so far away
Tomorrow so far to go
I can't stay no time for fun
The long road awaits
And I'm on the run
Yesterday so far away
Tomorrow so far to go
I can't stay no time for fun
The long road awaits
And I'm on the run
Yesterday so far away
Tomorrow so far to go
I can't stay no time for fun
The long road awaits
And I'm on the run
I'm on the run
I'm on the run <start> The touch of your lips next to mine
Gets me excited makes me feel fine
The touch of your hand your sweet hello
The fire inside you when you're holding me close
Your love so warm and tender
The thrill is so divine
It is all these things that make you mine
If you would leave I surely would die
When you were ten minutes late I started to cry
I've got it bad it's alright
As long as you're here every night
Your love so warm and tender
The thrill is so divine
It is all these things that make you mine <start> Why is this window so dirty and gray'
I can't see you through it anymore
It may be the smoke it's hard to say
The fact is this place has too many doors
I can't find a handle on any of them
Maybe I see one but I don't want to turn it
What if I did and it opened on him
Ain't truth a bitch when you're having to learn it'
Before a heart breaks it has to bend
It's the last one to know when love comes to an end
And here I sit crazy lonesome and sad
Watching me dark and mad
Watching me dark and mad
This cigarette burns like the pain in my soul
When the fire gets too hot the ash turns to coal
The smoke tells a story that's sad but it's true
It turns into a ghost that looks just like you
I close my eyes and I silently scream
My mind comes and goes it drifts and it dreams
The cold hand of death is welcome and warm
It's the essence of love in its darkest form
Before a heart breaks it has to bend
It's the last one to know when love comes to an end
And here I sit crazy lonesome and sad
Watching me dark and mad
Watching me dark and mad
Watching me dark and mad
Watching me dark and mad <start> Musica por Paulo Carvalho
meianoite baby
Sesso vampiro j
Pula a janela e vem.
hora de rodar
A noite chama a gente
Pra ver o que ela tem
'T todo mundo quente
Pra ver se cruza algum
Eu nem sei o seu nome
E nem quero saber
Eu sei que tenho fome
E fome de voc
Esquece o namorado
Que te respeita tanto
Quem 't aqui do seu lado
tudo menos santo
Nem pensa no marido
Que come a secretria
Eu sou muito mais bonito
E muito mais canalha
Tome um gole de gim
E suba na canoa
Como se sente assim
Dando prum tipo toa
Vamos beber vamos transar
Eu e voc at o dia clarear
'C vai grita vai ficar louca
S vai parar quando eu puser na
sua boca
Pode gritar meu bem
Dizer o que pensar
Eu vou gritar tambm
At perder o ar
Crave essas unhas baby
Faa o sangue descer
Eu mato a sua sede
s voc beber
Sangue suor saliva
E o que mais tiver
No cho na mo na lngua.
Onde voc quiser
Sent by Carlos Andr Branco <start> Oh I've been looking for a girl
Who wanted something more than makeup and dresses
She wouldn't care about hair styles nail files
It just might take a while
But I've got all the time to wait
I'm not afraid of being alone for awhile
'Cause I don't need no alibis pretty lies
I have no need for compromise
I want you believe me
I need you deceive me
I'm fading don't leave me
I'm begging don't let me down
Don't let me down don't let me down
Then I saw you in the street
And I just knew I had to make your acquaintance
Something like an old friend start to end
I could feel my heart start to mend
Last night I dreamt that I had drowned
Beneath the water on the floor of the ocean
As I lay among the shells and sand
Your hand pulled me up to dry land
I want you believe me
I need you deceive me
I'm fading don't leave me
I'm begging don't let me down
Don't let me down don't let me down
Don't let me down
Its almost funny when you're all alone for too long
You start to feeling that there's something that you've done wrong
When you find the one in all the worlds corrected
You never plan it out its when you least expect it
Now you're protected even respected
I want you believe me
I need you deceive me
I'm fading don't leave me
I'm begging don't let me down
Don't let me down don't let me down
Don't let me down <start> Here we go
Thinking of the moment we first met
I looked in your eyes I can't forget
All the loving that you made me feel
I had the chance to look the other way
My love for you grows stronger everyday
Understand your all I really need
Chorus
I know you're the one for me
Together we were meant to be
Can't you see
You're the one for me
Everytime I start to look around
The thought of losing you just brings me down
Is it something I should care about
I got something I just can't let go
Stay close to me I want to let you know
I love you so
Chorus 
So many nights i'd lie awake
Thinking of a way
And baby I just want to say
I love you
Chorus  <start> Today's the day we're gonna leave all our problems
Just get up and go
So forget them you don't need them
Leave it alone
When the good mornings are long
I can never go wrong
There's a storm coming our way
But not today
Tonight's the night you can make it
Tonight's the night you can make it
Tonight's the night you can make it
So alright with me.
You asked for silver and I gave you gold
I'm asking nothing from you
If these people had a clue what we knew
They'd be feeling it too
The time's passing us by
But I've never risen so high
The day is moving so fast
So we got to make it last
Make it last
Tonight's the night you can make it

Tonight's the night you can make it

Tonight's the night you can make it
Tonight's the night you can make it
Tonight's the night you can make it
Tonight's the night you can make it
You can make it all right
You are alright with me <start> I put my best foot first and it got burnt
Communication always hurts
I've got myself so deep inside a hole
I taste the air go thin as I get old as I get old
I don't think so
Chorus
She's my hands she's my hands
Picks me up when I crash down
Build me wings so I can glide
She's my novocaine ride
Pick up the pieces of my world
Glue thme together I wish I could
I can't believe it as the picture fades
Just like a t.v but the sound remains
I don't think so no I don't think so
Chorus
Feel it as I shake
Shatter illusions fade
Taste my bitter tears
Cut my heart with shears
I don't think so I don't think so
Chorus <start> She'd shake it up was hard to make out.
Now it's plain to see
I couldn't cook to save myself
found my life a recipe.
I never looked at her this way before
but now she's all I see...
Alison's starting to happen
Alison's starting to happen
Alison's starting to happen to me
It's so mesmerizing
can't describe it
all that inside hey.
No one's heard her last name I ain't asked
So who am I to blame
An earthquakes started forming underneath my feet today...
Alison's starting to happen
Alison's starting to happen
Alison's starting to happen to me
Oh this world is topsyturvy
and it is mine to eat.
She's the pebble in my mouth and underneath my feet.
She's the puzzle piece behind the couch made the sky complete.
Alison's starting to happen.
Alison's starting to happen.
Alison's starting to happen.
Alison's starting to happen.
Alison's getting her tit pierced.
Alison's growing a mohawk.
Alison's starting to happen to me. <start> I know your bad for me
It makes me want you more
I will do anything
'Cause I'm your filthy whore.
You keep me down
And I can't face the day
You keep me bound
And can't escape the fray
I'm much more than this
But I don't mean much
I don't matter to you
'Cause I'm just a fuck
I should've never believed those things you said
Everything I felt inside is dead
I thought I meant something
I guess not I'm a precious nothing to you
I keep on losing face
Until I'm erased
Welcome to the trends
And spread the pop disease
You can't lose the friends
That spread their legs to please you
I should've never believed
The things you said
Everything I feel inside is dead
Wear The Mask <start> Cuando amanece el dia
Why el cielo pinta tus ojos negros
Vaya suerte la mia
Que pueda verte en ese momento
se me nublan los ojos
Se me envenenan los pensamientos
pensabas que vivias
Dentro de un cuento con argumento
Pensabas que sentias
Lo que yo siento siempre por dentro
why a mi se me nublan los ojos
Se me envenenan los pensamientos
te beso why no me responden los huesos
Why se me para el tiempo
Se me para el tiempo
why yo te quiero besar
Besar tus labios de caramelo
Why que me lleve el demonio si no te quiero
que yo me pongo a pensar
Ser un poquito mas libre
Why poder remontar el vuelo
contigo quiero volar
Para poder verte desde el cielo
En busca de lo imposible
Que se escapa entre mis dedos
busco la sabiduria
En el cofre de tus pensamientos
Con tu llave yo abriria
Todas las puertas del universo
why yo que vivo soando
Mi corazon late a contratiempo
pensabas que abriria
Todas las puertas del universo
Pensabas que sentia
Lo que yo siento siempre por dentro
why a mi se me nublan los ojos
Se me envenenan los pensamientos
te beso why no me responden los huesos
Se me para el tiempo
Se me para el tiempo
why yo te quiero besar
Besar tus labios de caramelo
Why que me lleve el demonio si no te quiero
que yo me pongo a pensar
Sere un poquito mas libre
Why podre remontar el vuelo
contigo quiero volar
Para poder verte desde el cielo
En busca de lo imposible
Que se escapa entre mis dedos
contigo quiero volar
Para poder verte desde el cielo
En busca de lo imposible
Que se escapa entre mis dedos
Sere un poquito mas libre
Why podre remontar el vuelo <start> There's been a riot down on mainstreet tonight
They just went crazy set this whole damn town alight
Chorus
Whisky to water turn water to wine
Run for your life run for your life
There's been a riot
The boy was running he had nowhere left to hide
They cut him down to the ground
Still they didn't find the knife
They say it's murdermurder in the first degree
They have no suspect now those hound dogs follow me
Chorus
Whisky to waterturn water to wine
Run for your life run for your life
There's been a riotnowhere to run
There's been a riotnowhere to hide
They've got an innocent boy for an innocent crime
They cut him down to the ground when he
Didn't have nowhere to hide
You gotta fight to surviverun for your life
No way did I commit this crime
No way am I about to die
No way can I forgive myself
For the things I've never done
There's no way you're gonna make me pay
No way I'm coming back today
No way you're gonna bring me back alive
There's been a riot they say it's murder
There's been a riot
He's just an innocent boy for an innocent crime
There's been a riot no way you'll get me
To come back alive <start> See another day
I try to kill the time but this time it stays alive
You could say I'm a long distance caller
 minutes action and ten hour drive
Some dreams come true
That's one thing I know
And girl I've got  more days to go
I see another day
Same old situation but in a different place
I'm just a kid out on a mission
I look out through the window and start dreaming away
Tonight I'll be alright
Yeah I'm gonna be okay
There's nothing standing in my way
When the night arrives
And the sun comes down
To put a final ray of light on a dirty town <start> This kid is wasting his life away
He thinks the guy outta Green Day
Is living in his soul
He's playing at the bowl
His mother shouts him down for tea
He's gotta get a grip on reality
Faking life with something he'll never be
You've gotta be yourself and never someone else
And fit in with society
He's  but thinks he's 
He can't relate he's got no girlfriend
He'll never change
He'll never change
He's always getting high
He's living one big lie
His head is in the sky
His mum and dad he lives with never care
Never care
He's always getting high
He's living one big lie
His head is in the sky
His mum and dad he lives with never care
Never care
He said he's gonna be famous
And buy a house and live in Las Vegas
Party every night a private jet to fly
Hanging round with Madge and Guy
The way he spoke you gotta believe it
In my mind I was reliving it
Hugh Hefner was there
I asked him if he'd share
This is getting all too much
He's recognised wherever that he goes
It must be nice to be such a hero
He's really changed
He's really changed
He's vastly overpaid he's always getting laid
He drives the best cars ever made
He's always in the papers everyday
Everyday
He's vastly overpaid he's always getting laid
He drives the best cars ever made
He's always in the papers everyday
Everyday
I call him and ask him for tickets
He tells me to go and sling it
He's really changed
He's really changed
He's vastly overpaid he's always getting laid
He drives the best cars ever made
He's always in the papers everyday
Everyday
He's vastly overpaid he's always getting laid
He drives the best cars ever made
He's always in the papers everyday
Everyday
At twentybloodyeight he's hanging round with millionaires
Designer clothes he always wears
His face is on billboards everywhere
But I don't care <start> That boy is gone
Sometimes I miss the way he wept at night
To be still and not run
To be rocked to sleep in your light
These days there is not much that will bring tears to my eyes
But when I remember who I am and who you are
When I remember
A cloud moves in rain falls thunder strikes and sunshine breaks through the clouds
I am walking blind
So distracted that I don't even feel when you hold me
When did I grow such thick skin
You are my sunshine and rain
My joy and sweet pain
I'm a spotless stain
That boy is gone
But nobody moves me like you do
When I remember
A cloud moves in rain falls thunder strikes
And sunshine breaks through the clouds
I can cry out of sorrow and joy
Every drop of rain turns into a crystal in the sun
So wash my eyes my clothes my skin my bones my soul
My feet my love
I'm not forgotten
I'm in your thoughts cause I feel sunshine in the rain
To this day nobody moves
Nobody
Nobody moves me like you do <start> Theres some people hangin' outside
Got the goods got enough for a ride
It took three whole days to get me out
Thats what Im fuckin' talkin' about
Could you get me something
To fuck around with my head and my mind
Could you get me something
Could you get me something
I could use I could use
Theres a little girl I know
She called me up on the telephone
And she said boy you got something to prove
So come on and make your move
Could you get me something
I could use <start> Voc me seduziu
Mas voc me seduziu
No era pra seduzir
Mas voc me seduziu
Agora eu t seduzido
Pois voc me seduziu
No era pra seduzir
Mas voc me seduziu

Si busco en el todo encuentro el sino
Liberar y disolver mi yo en el vaco
Si busco en el todo encuentro el sino
Liberar y disolver mi yo en el vaco
Cuando no deseo nada tengo todo tengo mas  <start> Monday morning you look so fine
Friday I got travelin' on my mind
First you love me then you fade away
I can't go on believin' this way
I got nothing but love for you
So tell me what you really want to do
First you love me then you get on down the line
But I don't mind I don't mind
I'll be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
Got to get some peace in my mind
Monday morning you look so fine
Friday I got travelin' on my mind
First you love me then you say it's wrong
I can't go on believing for long
But you know it's true
You only want me when I get over you
First you love me then you get on down the line
But I don't mind I don't mind
I'll be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
Got to get some peace in my mind <start> Spin it. <start> Take what you've got take comfort in that
Everything you know or seen will soon be a non existent dot
Who'll save the world that claims there is no saving
An illusion or delusion of grandeur
Half of what I say is bliss the other half is meaningless
Comfortable lines waiting for the clock to heal us
Lost and found but never touched another beating heart is lost
Interesting lies waiting for the clock to heal us
Alone in our rooms miserable
A tornado or an owl come back and isolate the balance
Nothing is real your heart on your sleeve
Just another lie transcend the pride of the chemicals
Half of what I say is bliss the other half is meaningless
Comfortable lines waiting for the clock to heal us
Lost and found but never touched another beating heart is lost
Interesting lies waiting for the clock to heal us
Take your time nothingness is something
And something is nothing
Take your time nothingness is something
And something is nothing and nothing is nothing
Half of what I say is bliss the other half is meaningless
Comfortable lines waiting for the clock to heal us
Lost and found but never touched another beating heart is lost
Interesting lies waiting for the clock to heal us
Half of what I say is bliss the other half is meaningless
Comfortable lines waiting for the clock to heal us
Lost and found but never touched another beating heart is lost
Interesting lies waiting for the clock to heal us <start> I heard a street singer play a song I knew that brought me closer to you
I heard a street singer play a song I called my own that brought be to my childhood home
Chorus
Did you go back from where you came
If i get there will they have my name
If they don't I'll only have myself to blame
for all these things
True happiness is having wings
Life is a grey eyed heavy hearted whirlwind of a storm
Something they just hurt too much to cry
Memories are like shadows the light won't make them disappear
So I still see you smiling with your eyes
Chorus
So did you go back from where you came
If I get there if they have my name
If they don't I'll only have myself to blame
For all these things
True happiness is having wings
Did you go back from where you came
If I get there will they have my name
If they don't I'll only have myself to blame
For all these things
True happiness is having wings
True happiness is having wings
True happiness is having wings <start> High On A Hill
The Valley Below Me
The Blue Sky Above Me
My Dream Was So Real
I Could Not Hear
The Hum Of The Highway
Or The Drums Of The Foundry
Pounding Out Steel
I Didn't Need No Money
I Didn't Need No Time
I Didn't Need Nothing But My Own Piece Of Mind
And You Know That
A Voice Like A Whisper Is Bound To Be Heard
For Just One Moment
I'm The King Of The World
For Just One Moment
I'm The King Of The World
So I Close My Eyes
I Let The Power Defeat Me
Because The Real World Can't Free Me
From This Dirty Old Town
Where The Four Winds Blow
I Sent My Troubles Rollin'
And Since The World Just Kept On Turnin'
I Let It Go Round
I Didn't Need No Money
I Didn't Need No Time
I Didn't Need Nothing But My Own Piece Of Mind
Where The Four Winds Blow
I Sent My Troubles Rollin'
And Since The World Just Kept On Turnin'
I Let It Go Round
I Didn't Need No Money
I Didn't Need No Time
I Didn't Need Nothing But My Own Piece Of Mind
I'm The King Of The World <start> Head is pounding in a daze
Bruised wrists and your body aches
If you be mind. I'll be your mirror
Glide inside pull your trigger
Violent mind violent mind violent mind
Violent mind violent mind violent mind
I know what you want to do
We're on the line
I know what you want to do
Got a violent mind
I know where you're going to
Eyes black and wide

Got a violent mind
Hedonistic narcissistic
Erotic nihilistic
Pupils wide gonna slide inside
Gonna blow your mind
Violent mind violent mind violent mind

I know what you want to do

Eyes black and wide

Got a violent mind <start> No one said it would be easy
You once could call this place your own
It took a single day
It seems like your whole life has changed around
But one thing I know
So oh
Nobody can take your life away
No
No one is standing in your place
It's your time
You're where the world can see
The way it's gonna be
Maybe things can turn for better
Maybe your dreams will come true
The future seems unclear
But if you let me hold the mirror
I'll shine back the best of you
So oh
Nobody can take your life away
No
No one is standing in your place
It's your time
You're where the world can see
The way it's gonna be
Try to see the world getting bigger
We both have our roads and much farther to go
But it won't have to feel so hard when you're not alone


Oh
Nobody can take your life away
No
No one is standing in your place
It's your time
You're where the world can see
The way it's gonna be
Way it's gonna be <start> Spot lion theme
The songs of the world escape me
The moment you crack
Now you driving
Down the highway of regret
Your a victim
Of your rapids eye
Promises broken
Yeah
Your that restless kind
Only you only you can stop this
Stop this from pulling us under
Baby no one can do this but you
Blue dreams about you
My eyes wide open
You think you lost it
My heart for you
The sfeer of you're not being here with me
Were moving slowmotion
I stop and rewind
Back to better times
Only you only you can stop this
Stop this from pulling us under
Baby no one can do this but you
Only you oooh <start> Don't know many things in my life
Which seem to be unreal
But one certain vision controls
My mind for several years
It leads my thoughts every day
It's my guide to find my way
I know you
I know who you are
I walked through the city last night
To see a now born day
But at the end of the road
I somehow lost my way <start> Doctor my eyes have seen the years
And the slow parade of fears without crying
Now I want to understand
I have done all that I could
To see the evil and the good without hiding
You must help me if you can
Doctor my eyes tell me what is wrong
Was I unwise to leave them open for so long
'Cause I have wandered through this world
And each moment has unfurled
I've been waiting to awaken from these dreams
'Cause people go just where they will
I never noticed them until I got this feeling
That it's later than it seems
Doctor my eyes tell me what you see
I hear their cries just say if it's too late for me
Doctor my eyes tell me what you see
I hear their cries just say if it's too late for me
Doctor my eyes I cannot see the sky
Is this the price for having learned how not to cry <start> Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know I don't know
You stick around and it may show
I don't know I don't know
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how <start> I walk along the strand
To catch the late ride home.
Shuttle through the evening gloom
Knowing I forgot to phone.
The back door's open.
There's a chill blowing in.
Take your warm hands off me.
Let the night begin.
Shush your mouth.
Listen to me.
I won't say nothing
Just let me be your
Toad in the Hole.
Kicking through the wet leaves lying
All along the station road.
Past tired graffitti wailing
Raw emotion to unload.
There's coal in the fireplace
And money in the bank too.
Deeppile carpets tinsel wallpaper.
Still got the back room to do.
Don't be late.
Got a day's work behind me.
Feel a little devastated
But my nights are assigned
To you.
No tomcat creeping now
Could ever be so bold
To hang around our place tonight
When I come in from the cold.
There's a straightsix in the garage
And some fine wine to cool.
Laboursavers in the kitchen
Room in the garden for a pool.
Shush your mouth.
Let imagination run
Here in bedsit heaven
Where all the best wishing's done
To warm Toad in the Hole. <start> One by one the teardrops fall as I write to you
One by one my words come falling on the page
One by one my dreams are fading in the twilight
One by one my schemes are failing fast away
One by one the flowers fade here in my garden
One by one the leaves are falling from the trees
One by one my hopes are vanished in the clouds dear
One by one like snowflakes melting in the breeze
One by one my hair is turning gray
One by one my dreams are fading fast away
One by one I ready your letters over
One by one I lay them all away
One by one the days are slipping up behind you
One by one the sweetest days of life go by
One by one the moments stealing up behind you
One by one she'll come and find not you or I
One by one I hear the soft words that you whispered
One by one I feel your kisses soft and sweet
One by one I hope you'll say the words to marry
One by one to one by one forever be <start> This feeling haunts me
Behind these eyes
The shell seems so empty
Does anything live inside
I want to live
I wish I was dead
I don't even want to think I'm stuck here
And I know it
I don't want to see
Make me close my eyes
I want to live I wish I was dead
I look in your eyes
And see it's always this way
Live the lie and take a dive
Just to make it die
I've just got to close my eyes
I've got to close my eyes
I've got to close my eyes <start> It's gonna rain outside
I can tell by the clouds
In the sky whoa whoa
Uhuh oh uhuh
You used to come
And see me baby all the time
People see you walking down the street
They say you were mine
We use to love each other baby
Ah that's all
Well I can still remember
Your skin so soft
It's gonna rain outside
I can tell by the clouds
In the sky whoa whoa
Uhuh oh uhuh
You would come and see me
Baby gave you all I had to give
Sometimes when you left me
I didn't know if I was gonna live
Used to watch the suns come up
And the moons go down
We used to take off our shoes
And stamp our feet in the ground
Oh yeah <start> Last night was bad my doubts were all I had realizing I was alone
And trying to think of someone to phone but no one came to mind
There was nothing for me to say
That just anyone would understand
I was scared and afraid I was so alone
We're neurotic we've had it
Surround myself with people but I'm always alone human props small talk keeps silence from imposing my own mind my worst enemy it will destroy me slowly more coffee more coffee more coffee
I'm going numb
We're neurotic we've had it
It's hard for me to explain
It's hard to understand all the fear and phobia that lays inside and traps this man when I'm surrounded I wanna scream and kick down the walls destroy what hold me I wanna smash it all
We're neurotic we've had it <start> Mama grapped onto the milkman's hand
And then she finally gave birth
Years go by still I don't know
Who shall inherit this earth
And no one will know my name until it's on a stone
This could be your lucky day in hell
Never know who it might be at your doorbell
This could be your lucky day in hell
Waking up with an ugly face
Winston Churchill in drag
Looking for a new maternal embrace
Another tired old gag
Am I just a walking bag of chewed up dust and bones
This could be your lucky day in hell
Never know who it might be at your doorbell
This could be your lucky day in hell
Father Theresa you can't make me into you
I never want to be like you
Why can't you see it's me
You know it's time to let me go
This could be your lucky day in hell
Never know who it might be at your doorbell
This could be your lucky day in hell <start> Im warm when Im cold
Im cold when Im warm
And nothing seems to be alright
Im down on my knees
And Im easy to please
When I think bout what I did last night
When you told me to share
And ran my fingers through my hair
Infinity Yes I do
But when I cry in your arms
Or dress up in my charm
Im not the one sayin' I love you
Yeah life is a bomb
And it hits so hard
It will bring out the tears from my eyes
Yeah love is a drag
Yes it can be that bad
When at the end of the rope is your dad
Im not the one who loved you
Im the one who left you behind
Fedex my life
Exfile and access denied
You out me up on a stand
And read the palm of my hand
What makes you think you know what I've been through
All the phonies and the gold
Are you scared of gettin' old
Welcome to planet fuckin' dejavu
Im the one <start> Thusly and so beneath a blood moon shine
Upon the world so crystalline
Until a loud cry crossed the night
Over the iced white shred of light
A universal beginning
A minature echo of the birth of time
Will tumble upon abominable life giving delusional mind
The rain of limbs and babies
Of which they were a part
And the terror of the destiny rushing them from below
Becoming a cancer
You have become a plague upon yourself
Life's but a walking shadow
A tale told by an idiot
Full of sounds and fury signifying nothing
The more I see the more am I disgust
Hale and detest that animal called man <start> The world is neither fair nor unfair
The idea is just a way for us to understand
But the world is neither fair nor unfair
So one survives
The others die
And you always want a reason why
But the world is neither just nor unjust
It's just us trying to feel that there's some sense in it
No the world is neither just nor unjust
And though going young
So much undone
Is a tragedy for everyone
It doesn't speak a plan or any secret thing
No unseen sign or untold truth in anything...
But living on in others in memories and dreams
Is not enough
You want everything
Another world where the sun always shines
And the birds always sing
Always sing...
The world is neither fair nor unfair
The idea is just a way for us to understand
No the world is neither fair nor unfair
So some survive
And others die
And you always want a reason why
But the world is neither just nor unjust
It's just us trying to feel that there's some sense in it
No the world is neither just nor unjust
And though going young
So much undone
Is a tragedy for everyone
It doesn't mean there has to be a way of things
No special sense that hidden hands are pulling strings
But living on in others in memories and dreams
Is not enough
And it never is
You always want so much more than this
An endless sense of soul and an eternity of love
A sweet mother down below and a just father above
For living on in others in memories and dreams
Is not enough
You want everything
Another world
Where the birds always sing
Another world
Where the sun always shines
Another world
Where nothing ever dies <start> You and me we're like the fire in the trees
We're like the pollen in the breeze
Summer with a freeze you and me
Just you and me we're like the fire in the trees
We're like the pollen in the breeze
Summer with a freeze you and me
There is something you should know
Something you should think about
Where you wanna go Do you want me in or want me out

We're like the pollen in the breeze
Summer with a freeze you and me and you and me yeah

Yeah you and me yeah
You and me yeah <start> Don't look at me and shake your head.
Its pm you should be in bed.
And Just because you're old and wise
doesn't give the right to criticize.
The clothing that I wear
The color I decide to dye my hair
Exactly how much ink covers my skin
or how many holes are in my head.
This is My Life.
I may not think before I act
but never ask to take it back.
You say responsibility and I say..
F work lets party.
The chances that I take
All the choices I decide to make
I know that you will not always agree
but your advice is the last thing I need.
This is My Life if you can't tell.
You've got your own so leave me alone.
This is My Life last time I checked.
It's not up to you don't tell me what to do..
This is My Life
This is My Life if you can't tell.
You've got your own so leave me alone.
This is My Life last time I checked.
It's not up to you don't tell me what to
It's not up to you don't tell me what to do..
This is My Life
This is My Life <start> Since we met
We have been as thick as thieves
And you could bet
When they say you then they saw me
Not far away
Probably holding down the beat
To your licks
Cause that's the way we told them it has to be
So say hello
To my little friend
Where he goes
I'll be right there til the end
So say hello
To the closest bestest friend I ever had
And I don't know where I'd go
Or what I'd do without you
Remember when
We took off with that one band
All the gigs
And all the miles we put on that van
And radio
Trivia would pass the time
Little did we know
Those would be some of the best times of our lives
So say hello
To my little friend
Where he goes
I'll be right there til the end
So say hello
To the closest bestest friend I ever had
And I don't know where I'd go
Or what I'd do without you
Back and forth to Wesiana
Crossing the great Huck Fin
Pack a bag we'll meet at AM
And do it all again
Now here we are
Living all those dreams we talked about
We never though we'd get this far
And if I could not do it with you
I'd do without
So say hello
To my little friend
Where he goes
I'll be right there til the end
So say hello
To the closest bestest friend I ever had
And I don't know where I'd go
Or what I'd do without you
So say hello
To my little friend
Where he goes
I'll be right there til the end
So say hello
To the closest bestest friend I ever had
And I don't know where I'd go
Or what I'd do without you <start> Well they moved away from the farms they did not own
To live happily ever after on a G.I. loan
The future was looking bright back in '
'Neath the shadow of atomic bombs and the baby boom
You could take a walk downtown without being afraid
Hey who's the better center fielder Mantle or Mays
There was chicken in every pot even when times were lean
We thought everybody had a shot at the American dream
Every mother was supposed to look like Donna Reed
father knew what was best for you and me
Our lives were etched on eight millimeter frames
As we grew up in houses that all looked the same
But there was trouble on the other side of town
It was a time when people began to stand their ground
As the eyes of the world were opened by a man named King
Everybody wanted their share of the American dream
Dream on children dream on
Don't let anybody tell you the dream is gone
As long as there's a God above
Keep praying we never wake up
Keep on dreaming the American dream
Now there's medals on the wall I got back in '
And a quarteracre piece of Heaven
Where my kids can run
As I turn off the cable and put my babies to bed
I kiss 'em goodnight and I whisper under my breath
Dream on children dream on
Don't let anybody tell you the dream is gone
As long as there's a God above
Keep praying we never wake up
Keep on dreaming the American dream <start> Suddenly the dawn was here and so the winds
These were the magic winds from a foreign land
It may take time to learn to fly again
Ooh mighty winds listen to my heart
I know you feel the eagle inside of me
I am the skyborn son please take me home
Home to the clouds from where my heart belongs
Now I see the light of the stars that will guide me home
Ooh mighty winds listen to my heart
I know you feel the eagle inside of me <start> Well the eagle's been flyin' slow
And the flag's been flyin' low
And a lotta people sayin' that America's
fixin' to fall
Well speakin' just for me
And some people from Tennessee
We've got a thing or two to tell you all
This lady may have stumbled
But she ain't never fell
And if the Russians don't believe that
They can all go straight to hell
We're gonna put her feet back
On the path of righteousness and then
God bless America again
Chorus
And you never did think
That it ever would happen again

You never did think
That we'd ever get together again

Yeah we're walkng real proud
And we're talkin' real loud again

You never did think
That it ever would happen again
From The Sound up in Long Island
Out to San Francisco Bay
And everthing that's in between them
Is our own
And we may have done a little bit
Of fightin' amongst ourselves
But you outside people best leave us
alone
'Cause we'll all stick together
And you can take that to the bank
That's the cowboys and the hippies
And the rebels and and the yanks
You just go and lay your hand
On a Pittsburgh Steelers' fan
And I think you're gonna finally
understand
Chorus x <start> Why you never trusted me I fully understand
You never liked me jammin' with yo' brother's funky band
You build your trust on honest of which I ain't got none
If you can't keep up with me then baby I'll be gone
This little girl's for takin' so take her if you can
Ya better be sure to treat her good or she'll find another man
This little girl's for takin' so take her if you can
Ya better be sure to treat her good or she'll find another man
I got juicy Lucy on my mind
Juicy Lucy all the time
Juicy Lucy on the line
Give it to me Lucy one more time
Man know my conscience is sittin' pretty neat
I never once made out to be no pretty Mr. Petite
'Cause this little girl's for takin' so take her if you can
You better be sure to treat her good or she'll find another man <start> Some rainy days you know I dig the rain
It's rollin' down my window pane
And some rainy days I have no love
Some rainy days you know I have no love
And some days I can't get up Lord I have no love
And the sunny daze are few and far between
Right before your darkest hour it seems it seems the sun may never shine
And right before you think that everything it may never change
Surely the sun will come out to shine
Some rainy days you know I dig the rain
It's rollin' down my window pane
Some rainy days I have no love
Some rainy days you know I have no love
And some days I can't get up hell I have no love
And the sunny daze are few and far between
Right before your darkest hour it seems it seems the sun may never shine
And right before you think that everything that it may never change
Surely the sun will come out to shine
Surely the sun will come out to shine
Surely the sun will come out to shine <start> I'm getting bored
Being part of mankind
There's not a lot to do no more
This race is a waste of time
People rushing everywhere
Swarming around like flies
Think I'll buy a forty four
Give 'em all a surprise
Think I'm gonna kill myself
'Cause a little suicide
Stick around for a couple of days
What a scandal if I died
Yeah I'm gonna kill myself
Get a little headline news
I'd like to see what the papers say
On the state of teenage blues
A rift in my family
I can't use the car
I gotta be in by ten o'clock
Who do they think they are
I'd make an exception
If you want to save my life
Brigitte Bardot gotta come
And see me every night
I think I'm gonna kill myself
'Cause a little suicide
Stick around for a couple of days
What a scandal if I died
Yeah I'm gonna kill myself
Get a little headline news
I'd like to see what the papers say
On the state of teenage blues
On the state of teenage blues
Kill myself suicide
What a scandal if I died
Suicide headline news
On the state of teenage blues <start> Well I've got to run to keep from hiding
And I'm bound to keep on riding
And I've got one more silver dollar
But I'm not gonna let them catch me no
Not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider
And I don't own the clothes I'm wearing
And the road goes on forever
And I've got one more silver dollar
But I'm not gonna let them catch me no
Not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider
And I've gone by the point of caring
Some old bed I'll soon be sharing
And I've got one more silver dollar
But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me no
Not gonna let them catch the midnight rider
No I'm not gonna let 'em catch me no
Not gonna let them catch the midnight rider
No I'm not gonna let 'em catch me no
I'm not gonna let them catch the midnight rider
But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me no
Not gonna let them catch the midnight rider <start> I can't sleep tonight
I won't sleep tomorrow
I'm goin' deep and tight
I don't need no excuse
I feel mean tonight
Oneeyed jacks and aces
Read 'em and weep tonight
I'm gonna let all hell break loose
I want drums like thunder
Gimme guitars that scream
One woman who could shake me
Yeah be my love machine
I need a love machine
to keep my motor running
Upon the big wide screen
I want to see it all
Yeah we'll be lean and mean
We'll be synchronized together
Me and my love machine
We're gonna do it all
I want drums like thunder
Gimme guitars that scream
One woman who can rock me
Yeah my little love machine
We're gonna make tonight
A night to remember
We're going hard and strong
Again and again
Yeah we're gonna make tonight
A night to remember
Yeah we're gonna take tonight
Right to the end
I need drums like thunder
Gimme guitars that scream
One woman who can rock me
I need a love machine
We gotta make tonight
A night to remember
We're goin' hard and strong
Again and again
Yeah we're gonna make tonight
A night to remember
Yeah we're goin' for a night
A night without end
We gotta make tonight
A night to remember
We're goin' hard and strong
Again and again
We're gonna make tonight
A night to remember
Yeah we're gonna take tonight
Right to the end <start> If I had a dime for every time I heard my old man say
One of these days
I wouldn't be like my old man today
Talking bout places that he'd been
Back in his younger days that he was gonna go back to again
One of these days
Dropped out of school when he was just sixteen
Fell right in to a tire plant
Building the very things that make the asphalt sing
And put Alabama far behind you
I remember him saying that Chicago was a hell right here on earth
And twenty five years later I was saying the same thing about Memphis
It's no wonder every body's scared of downtown Birmingham
It's just a little too close to home
But there's more crooks down here and the cops don't care
While old white men wearing ties can do anything they want.
Once a country boy's seen the way the steam rises
Off a man's insides on the sidewalk
Tends to change the way he thinks the way he sees everything
And he goes back to where he came from
One of these days when my face looks like a road map gonna find my way back home.
And I'll go walking on the west side after dark and leave my gun locked in my car.
One of these days you'll take one look at me and run. One of these days you'll take
One look at me and run. <start> Written by danny kirwan.

Oh... <start> Tom johnston
It's late at night
Can't go to sleep
Eyes open wide
Doin' the midnight creep
Well it's just a holiday
For a circus dream
'cause I'm a music man baby
Hangin' from a wire with no net below
You know I'm gonna catch you if you fall
Swirling dancers
Driftin' in the night
Make you go crazy
Forget what is wrong and what is right
'cause the melody gonna make you high
Float you away like a cloud in the sky
And the music man with a song for you
A sweet georgia minstrel who loves to sing the blues
Get it
Come and get it
When you get back home to your flat in the city
Notice that your neighbor has the radio on
Out of nowhere you gonna hear a sound
Movin' through your head spinning 'round and 'round
And the music man with a song for you
A sweet georgia minstrel who loves to sing the blues
Get it
Come and get it <start> Save the drama for your mama
I'm standing here on my pyjamas
The synagog
Now it is out time
It's our time to get all sticky
I know it sounds a little creepy
The synagog
Now it is our time
Feel me up. It won't be tricky
Falls apart when you get picky
No Let's give it a try
The same old song
Just you and me
Your heart and soul
It's all I need
Na..Na..Na..Na..Na.. <start> Your money's dripping like honey sticking
Just as foreign to me
Been wasting my time convincing you to buy
What you can't afford to need
Oh I've come through this phase
I'm out your race
I said I'm washing my hands of you with my industrial broom
Sweeping you under my carpet it covers the room
I've been clearing my head for days
Of the incredible waste
Making it easy to forget you darkened the place
Oh you're a coward and I'm empowered
To keep track of everything yeah
Those who you can trust those who become dust
It's more fun than you might think yeah
I said I'm washing my hands of you with my industrial broom
Sweeping you under my carpet it covers the room
I've been clearing my head for days
Of the incredible waste
Making it easy to forget you darkened the place
So I killed your pride for fear of suicide
I think it's all for the best
I'm only human that's more than you've been
I'm leaving you to the rest yes
I said I'm washing my hands of you with my industrial broom
Sweeping you under my carpet it covers the room
I've been clearing my head for days
Of the incredible waste
Making it easy to forget you ever darkened the place
You ever darkened the place
So fucking easy <start> I stare into the sunrise
Cold
A face of fear
A void of soul
Inside
This hole
Where I feel safe
Inside this storm
This empty place
This crown of clouds
I wear alone
This dust of rain
Stays on and on
Nothing can stop the rain
It gets in everything
Nothing comes from everything
I am
Nothing can stop the rain
I climbed the stairs
Upon my knees
Penance of glass
A drop of peace
Nothing I do
Can fill this hole
Can clear this storm
Can give me hope
This crown of clouds
I wear alone
This dust of rain
Stays on and on <start> Look here I just tattooed
A wedding band
On what looks like to me
My mother's hand
I'm no blushing girl
No innocent dove
It took me a long time to find love
But now I have no doubt
And I never will
That I am meant to be loving you
And it fairly blew my mind
To be so sure
When that little needle said I do
My love gives me hope
My love gives me pride
My love gets me past
The land mines inside
When I am next to you
I am more me
Inside me is a room to which you hold the key
Look at that honeymoon
In the albacore sky
Look with all of you
Not just your eye
Look at its dancing light
Through the whispering trees
Look how I love you and you love me
Look how I love you and you love me <start> Every now  then I feel this place is going down
I'll catch the next train into town
There's romance on the streets tonight
 every lonely hearts alright
And I think that I could find my way if I could find my way to you
So many pathways I have roamed
Will I ever feel at home
So many streets for a burning heart
But fewer roads to get a brand new start
I think that I could fin my way if I could find my way to you
I'm looking forward to not looking back
Trying to find a way to get on track
Sitting in this room all by myself
Oh lonely boy  what you gonna do
Every now  then I feel I'm a burning heart in a place where nothings real
Pouring rain all around me but I don't care
Have you got a hope for me to steal <start> These days you're doing very well no time for me I can tell
You live in heaven I live in hell come down to earth angel
These days you're moving very fast
You treat me like I'm second class
You try and pass me by but I won't' let you pass
Come down to earth baby come down to earth come down to earth
These days you seem to be on a roll
No matter what the cost you must reach that goal
Well business is business no time for the soul
Come down to earth baby
Sometimes it's easier to forget
Pretend you don't know me easier yet
You think you don't' have to pay your debts
Come down come down come down to earth
Come down come down come down to earth
I wish you should
I remember you do you remember me
And all the things we were going to do
Do you remember but I remember
These days you're doing very well no time for me I can tell
The word heaven I want to yell come down to earth angel
These days you're moving faster you don't treat me as classier
But I won't' let you pass it on to her come down to earth angel
Come down come down come down to earth
Come down come down come down to earth

Dobedobedo
Struck by lightning
Dobedobedo
Never again dobedobedobedobedo <start> Theres something about the way you move tonight
Gliding across the floor like you dont feel at all
Theres something I need to say can we move aside
The glass of your eyes shows me you dont care
Please tell me you need to stay
Youve had enough time to think
Do you intend to change
Im not ignoring you just blocking you out
I wont accept apologies from someone who is dead inside
Bleed me out leave me dry you suffocate the tears I cry
Four cursed words Lets try being friends
Bitterness embraced the devils might care
Your calloused heart feels no remorse
Its blackened out Its blackened out.
Theres a distant light that burns your eyes
That light is the truth that youre scared of
Dont tell me you feel the same as you did before
Your lies draw me in to false comforts once more
If only I had no shame
Id burn your ears with my rash words
You plague my thoughts and say
Im ignoring you and blocking you out
I wont accept apologies from someone who is dead inside
Bleed me out leave me dry you suffocate the tears I cry
Four cursed words Lets make this work
Bitterness embraced the devils might care
Your calloused heart feels no remorse
Its blackened out Its blackened out. <start> A reason A victim
A shadow vacant in the sky
You yearn for what's missing
Your power hidden in the night
An angel or demon 
Your Gods you prayed on lonesome nights
The damage inflicted
The pain in us they leave behind
Never give in
Never back down
Never give in
We're soldiers instinctive
We can bring change before we die
Through tails of the demons
To feel what lies beneath our eyes
Never give in
Never back down
Never give in
Never back down
When your life feels lost

Never give in

Never give in
Never back down
Never give in
Never back down
When your life feels lost

Never give in
 <start> Atrvete
Atrvete a viajar conmigo
Atrvete a vendar los ojos
Atrvete
Atrvete a las cosas nuevas
Y en esa quimera me propongo yo
Seamos estupendos amigos
Dejemos la crtica de lado
La msica no tiene mensaje para dar
Atrvete
Atrvete a lo poco claro
Atrvete a querer lo raro
Atrvete
Atrvete a surcar el caos
Que del otro lado te espero yo
La msica no tiene moral <start> Instrumental <start> Is it true you don't want to Feel a thing
Then stay in the underground Remain elusive I'm higher now than when I broke down It's wrong I don't think about you Is it wrong I don't think about you
Took a walk to the bridge again last night Gave no thoughts to mistakes I've made I felt cleansed for once in my life The sky was perfect clear I walked home again last night And got a feeling that I rarely question Rolled right over the thought of a breakdown And smiled without a care
If I never see you again I'm counting my blessings I'm higher now than when I broke down It's wrong I don't think about you Is it wrong I don't think about you
Impurites Accepted <start> You can't judge an apple by looking at a tree
You can't judge honey by looking at the bee
You can't judge a daughter by looking at the mother
You can't judge a book by looking at the cover
Oh can't you see
Oh you misjudge me
I look like a farmer
But I'm a lover
You can't judge a book by looking at the cover
Oh come on in closer baby
Hear what else I gotta say
You got your radio turned down too low
Turn it up
You can't judge sugar by looking at the cane
You can't judge a woman by looking at her man
You can't judge a sister by looking at her brother
You can't judge a book by looking at the cover
Oh can't you see
Oh you misjudge me
I look like a farmer
But I'm a Lover
You can't judge a book by looking at the cover
You can't judge a fish by lookin' in the pond
You can't judge right from looking at the wrong
You can't judge one by looking at the other
You can't judge a book by looking at the cover
Oh can't you see
Oh you misjudge me
I look like a farmer
But I'm a lover
You can't judge a book by looking at the cover <start> Those little golden birdies look at them
And the mystic Egypt tossle dangling down
Old sleeperman shish dont wake him
Up one hand broom star was an obiman
Revered throughout the boneknob land
His magic black purse slit creeped open
Let go flocks of them
Shish sookie singabus
Snored like a red merrygoround horse
And an acid gold bar swirled up and down
Up and down in back of the singabus
And the panataloon duck white goose neck quacked
Webcore webcore <start> Crawl crawl as a child
Move like a man
Pushing like a father
Pulling like a friend
Whatever it takes forever it seems
But in spite of all that all is well
Sexing like stone
Hot as the sand
Entering a life
Exiting with a man
Whatever it takes forever it seems
But in spite of all that all is well
Sometimes i spin around for days
Skip and chase and say
Forget about tomorrow
Until i realize
This valid and logic motion
Is what keeps me from moving
I don't know i understand
Running running on tracks
With feet on the ground
It will only slow me down
And which way the wind blows
I run like a man ready to go anywhere <start> A thousand times I've seen you standing
Gravity like lunar landing
You make me wanna run till I find you
I shut the world away from here
Drift to you you're all I hear
As everything we know fades to black
Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending
I never thought that I
Had anymore to give
You're pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But love remains the same
Find a place where we escape
Take you with me for a space
The city bus sounds just like a fridge
I walk the streets through seven bars
I have to find just where you are
The faces seem to blur
They're all the same
Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending
I never thought that I
Had anymore to give
You're pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But love remains the same
So much more to say
So much to be done
Don't you trick me now
We shall overcome
So all that's left is praying
But we should have had the sun
We could have been inside
Instead we're over here
Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending
Too much time too long defending
You and I are done pretending
I never thought that I
Had anymore to give
You're pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
Everything will change
I oh I
I wish this could last forever
I oh I
as if we could last forever
Love remains the same
Love remains the same <start> Newman
Old lady lost in the city in the middle of a cold cold night
It was fourteen below
And the wind starts to blow
There wasn't a boy scout in sight
Pull down the shades cause he's coming turn out the lights cause he's here
Running down the street
Through the snow and the sleet
On the coldest night of the year
Beware beware beware of the naked man
Old lady head up toward broad stree shuffling uptown against the wind
She'd started to cry
Wiped a tear
From her eye
Looked back to see where she had been
Old lady stand on the corner with a purse in her hand
She does not know
But in a minute or so
She will be robbed by a naked man
Beware beware beware of the naked man
Old lady lean against a lamppost staring down at the ground on which she stand
She look up and screamed
In the lamplight's beam
There stood the famous naked man
He say they found out about my sister they kicked me out of the navy
They would have strung me up if they could.
I tried to explain that we were both of us lazy
And were doing the best we could.
Well he faked to the left and he faked to the right
And the purse was snatched from her hand
Someone stop me he cried
As he faded from sight
Won't nobody help a naked man Oh Lord
Won't nobody help a naked man
Beware beware beware of the naked man <start> Deep from the shadows
They watch and they wait
I can see eyes all around me
Waiting for just the right second to take
Take my life away
And I can't help but fear them
Terrified and defenseless
But it's too late to turn back now
Spamming your Guard
They're here to erase me
How can I stand
Outnumbered and bleeding
I don't have the slightest of chances without you
I can't win this fight on my own
Quicken the pace
As the footsteps draw near
Caught in this state of confusion
Wishing that all this would just disappear
I run to you
I can feel my arms burning
All the tables are turning
But I won't surrender I won't back down
Spamming your Guard
They're here to erase me
How can I stand
Outnumbered and bleeding
I don't have the slightest of chances without you
I can't win this fight on my own
Broken bones
Their cheers so close
We're all they'll have
We're all they'll know
We'll raise our cups
We'll raise them high
We'll toast their death
And watch them die
Broken bones
Their cheers so close
We're all they'll have
We're all they'll know
We'll raise our cups
We'll raise them high
We'll toast their death
And watch them die
Spamming your Guard
They're here to erase me
How can I stand
Outnumbered and bleeding
I don't have the slightest of chances without you
I can't win this fight on my own
Save me God <start> She came to the coast from the show me state
With her daddy's blue eyes and her mama's blind hate
Guess she didn't know much but she knew the rules
What she needed to learn she would find in l.a.
Not back in that school
Didn't wanna read about it
Guess she wanted to see
Carolea she's carolea
Yeah yeah never quite sure what she wanted to be
Just a little girl alone in a big bad place
With a devious mind and a beautiful face
Ever since she was a baby she learned how to play
Wanted money in her hands from the easiest way
All her friends said stop girl you can't pay the price
But the hard way out don't appeal to the beast inside
She don't wanna hear about the better life
Guess she's ready to be
Hey carolea
She never tells the truth to the folks back east
Truth about the drugs and the men she gets paid to please
Well they don't know
Yeah they don't see
Yeah that finally now after all these years
She's let the beast inside roam free
Carolea <start> Deep down in Mississippi
I found my sweet delta blues
She weaved a little southern spell on me
Made a little voodoo
She was born the bright side of midnight
When her mama was seventeen
She was a hot blooded God fearin' gospel girl
The finest that I've ever seen yeah
She's black coffee little bit of cream
Sweet brown sugar my midnight dream
Black pearl yeah my kinda girl
Just the kind of thing to rock my world
Black pearl oh my kinda girl yeah
Met her in a Dixie diner
Put on the southern hospitality
I can still smell her sweet molasses
Running all over me
They started rollin' like the river
Like a twister tearin' through the town
We were tongue tied satisfied and southern fried
As she drove this old Dixie down yeah
She's black coffee little bit of cream
Sweet brown sugar my midnight dream
Black pearl my kinda girl
Just the kind of thing to rock my world
Black pearl she's my kinda girl yeah
Yeah she's alright yeah she's okay
Yeah makin' love night yeah really made my day
She was born the bright side of midnight

On your old town
Then you began
See I had these walls
Built up so strong
Built when I was young
In wars I've won
But if I'm alone
Stone upon stone
So tall I could not see
Beyond my wall
But your walls fall down
And your walls fall down
And when walls come down
On your old town you began
A bit unassured
A bit insecure
I climbed up to the top
And saw I lacked
And my fist stone cracked
Foundation collapsed
Standing on the ground
In stones I found
That your walls fall down
And your walls fall down
And when walls come down
On your old town you began
In other lands
From where you stand
Beneath a shelter
Built by many hands
There is a stone
And you've locked the door
Of people you were swore
You came for war
And your walls fall down
Walls fall down
Walls fall down
Like a stone falls down
I'm no stone
I'm no stone
It's just a stone
Stone falls down
Says he's a stone

No man's a stone <start> Instrumental <start> Look at me when I'm feeling down
All my emotions being puked on the crowd
Do you think anybody cares
I'm society's sucker of your great welfare
Sick of being on the Dole
Society hates me leave me alone
Sick of being on the Dole
No pub will give me alcohol
Look at me when I'm robbing you
Got no money but I need food
The system stopped sponsoring me
What the fuck am I gonna do
Sick of being on the Dole
Society hates me leave me alone
Sick of being on the Dole
No pub will give me alcohol
There is work they say every day
But not for me so I've got no pay
It's easy to judge from your side
But do you know how hard I've tried
Sick of being on the Dole
Sick Sick Sick Sick..... <start> Trying to find where trouble ends
I've found out it's in your friends
People looking for success
Think it comes in cash and Phecks
I know dove don't grow on leaves
Trusting something comes with apease
Women move like crumbs and eggs
Trying to find someone to blame
Even you you do it too
You just don't see the harm you do
Trying to find where trouble ends
I've found out it's in your friends
Ambitions spreading like disease
Affects the way that people see
Even you you change the ways
You just don't seem to care these days
Trying to find where trouble ends
I've found out it's in your friends
I've done things I shouldn't do
Taken things to get me through
I've been sinking in the sand
Always had a helping hand
Trying to find where trouble ends
I've found out it's in your friends <start> Ah viene la noche
Lo mas probable es que duermas
Ah viene la noche
Lo mas seguro es que mueras
Hoy llueven martillos
Los mas probable es que peguen
Hoy bajo la marea
Se fue llevando sus restos
Ay tortuga vete mar adentro
Y djanos y olvdanos
Ay tortuga vete mar adentro
Y djanos en este infierno
Ah viene la noche
Lo mas probable es que mueras
Hoy la arena es testigo
De tu peor enemigo
Y no sabes
Como duele
Y no te imaginas
Como lastima
Ay tortuga vete mar adentro
Y djanos y olvdanos
Ay tortuga vete mar adentro
Y djanos en este infierno <start> Do you know that you know me like nobody else
All of my secrets and lies
Do you know that you made me believe in myself
Made me believe I could fly
All the things that you say
That I wait for each day
You're almost too good to be true
Chorus
It could have been anyone oh anyone
A stranger out of the blue
It could have been anyone oh anyone
That I gave my heart up to
But it was you
Well you just never know when
the moment will come
When love is about to begin
Something about someone reaching out
And letting someone in
And I'm glad I was there
When out of thin air
We both had nothing to do
Chorus
One day we'll find out
Why you were sent to me
Now we're together
It must be the way it was meant to be
Chorus <start> A child of winter
A child of the snow
I'm making a snowball
That someone will throw
I'm making a snowman
With charcoal for the eyes
A scarf draped in red
And a derby on his head
Here comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer are pulling on the reins
Bells are ringing children singing
All is merry and bright
Hang your stockings and say your prayers
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight
The evening of Christmas
Presents have been passed
The wood in the fireplace
Is glowing its last
I'm closing my eyes now
In my bed I'm snuggling
Outside my window
The carolers sing
Christmas comes and the snow covers all
Trees are decorated with tinsel and lights
Mama's in the kitchen making cookies and bread
The children are hungry they're waiting to be fed
A child of Christmas
A child of snow
A wonderful feeling
Underneath the mistletoe
And may your Christmas
Last all year
With laughter of children
Peace and cheer
A child of Christmas
A child of snow
A wonderful feeling
Underneath the mistletoe
Merry Christmas to you
Ding dong ding go the bells
Ding dong ding go the bells
Ding dong ding go the bells
Ding dong ding go the bells
Ding dong ding go the bells <start> I got a sharp stick I keep in my pocket
I speak volumes never utter a word
When you strike a match a fire will happen
But the line between the smoke and the flames gets burned
Don't you see the writing on the wall
You're in way over your head
You're gonna drown in the things that you said
Time has come and gone for words
A thousands threats I've heard before
Words are cheap but lies are big to take
Time has come and gone for words
A thousands threats I've heard before
And all your words are too big to take
It's a paradox A mystery A riddle
A door in your face and only I have the key
Do understand you'll be caught in the middle
Caught in a web by being spun by me
Don't you see the writing on the wall 
Your just a victim of your own conceit
The architect of your own defeat
Time has come and gone for words
A thousands threats I've heard before
Words are cheap but lies are big to take
Time has come and gone for words
A thousands threats I've heard before
And all your words are too big to take
Never walk away from a fight that's worth fighting
Never hesitate when you know you're gonna act
Never waste your words on a fool you won't listen
Never sell your soul cause I'll never buy it
Time has come and gone for words
A thousands threats I've heard before
Words are cheap but lies are big to take
Time has come and gone for words
A thousands threats I've heard before
And all your words are too big to take
Time has come and gone for words
A thousands threats I've heard before
Words are cheap but lies are big to take
Time has come and gone for words
A thousands threats I've heard before
And all your words are too big to take <start> I've had just enough of the spotlight when it burns bright
To see how it gets in the blood
And I've tasted my share of the sweet life and the wild ride
And found a little is not quite enough
I know how I can stray
And how fast my heart could change
Chorus
Empty me of the selfishness inside
Every vain ambition and the poison of my pride
And any foolish thing my heart holds to
Lord empty me of me so I can be filled with You
I've seen just enough of the quick buys of the best lies
To know how prodigals can be drawn away
I know how I can stray
And how fast my heart could change
Chorus
'Cause everything is a lesser thing
Compared to You compared to You
'Cause everything is a lesser thing
Compared to You so why surrender all
Empty me of the selfishness inside
Every vain ambition and the poison of my pride
Empty me of the selfishness inside
Every vain ambition and the poison of my pride
And any foolish thing my heart holds to
Lord empty me of me so I can be
Lord empty me of me so I can be filled with You
Oh filled with You empty me <start> Anybody why I can't fufill my selfish angst tell me something I just can't find anything to fight it's all I need fuck the greed and anything in sight it's killing me and I can't breathe and I don't think it's right cause you say and I don't like it start a revolt now it's coming I don't think I'm ready so I won't anybody give me reasons tell me why it's wrong tell me something. what's it mean and what's it mean to me yeah believe me cause i won't leave you standing there while I run the show and I can't lie I think I'd die if you knew me you'd just wanna go. <start> Du tratst in mein Leben

This day is a high heeled click
But not one to miss
Lackluster boulevard
Hell bent on leaving your mark
Cured only by the dark
The hero is in
Just go
Give in give in
Now that you know
My manic mad mad man
Is loneliness your cane
Reckless just for the fame
Parading color starved
Spit out that piece of your heart
Oh no it's just the start
The hero is in
Just go
Give in give in
Now that you know
But don't blame it all on me
Oh can't you see
That you caressed the seed
Now wonder why you fiend
And why you bleed
But not for me
Oh oh oh <start> As sure as anything
As sure as I can be
That   pure as Ivory
I caught the scent followed the smell of it
Couldn't Ignore
Hey why did you pick on me
What's that pretty flower I see
Tall and wild it waves at me
Mother says it's just a weed
Golden Rod Golden Rod
Growing Wild not in the city
Gave me an allergy
And my reaction's what's gonna happen
It gets no help from me
I can't explain it
Maybe I shouldn't try to
That old genetic code
Had a hold on me
We go inside it ran head long into it
And mothers' warning useless to me
What's that pretty flower I see
Tall and wild it waves at me
Mother says it's just a weed
Golden Rod Golden Rod
Another blonde not from the city
Gave me an allergy
And you can see me drinking the poison
Taking it happily.

My love won't be over
This is just beginning
Till we get much older
Everything will
Everything will be all right
You will never lose me
Distance shouldn't be the enemy
I will be there for you
Patience should be friendly
Everything will
Everything will be all right
Problems will come
And problems will go
Just trust in what future holds
We're anything but ordinary
We're brave
Not ashamed
We're starting something new
Countries apart
We'll make the whole world
fit in the palm of our hands
This is our battle
I said it won't be easy
Together we'll make it work out
Together we'll make it work out
Everything will
Everything will be all right <start> She moved back around here thirtyfive weeks ago today
Oh down the lane
At night she walks on the banks and remembers how she
Dreamed of rowing away
And how she left one day
She left with a driven look in her eyes
Came back around with it still inside
They said give it some time and you'll forget about it too
We know they always do
Well I know
Some fine day
You will find your way across the river
Row down slow
There's a long way to go
Across the river
She was proud and so strong
And she tried not to listen to idle talk
Downtown where she walked
They sit around and they say
That she came back with her tail between her legs
Like they always said she would
Well I hear it's better on the other side
They say you'll never do it so don't even try
Well you may be beaten down with your closed mind
But don't try and make it mine
Well I know
Some fine day
You will find your way across the river
Row down slow
There's a long way to go
Across the river
Your wild days are through is what they said
I dreamed she came when I was down and
I walked where she led
Standing on the shore
She looks to the west with a look of longing
To where the grass seems greener
There's a hard and distant prize
It probably won't happen but I think I'll try
Well even if it doesn't happen for me
It still beats hanging around here
Well I know
Some fine day
You will find your way across the river
Row down slow
There's a long way to go
Across the river <start> I've got a girl in a box
Keep her under my bed
It sure must get hot in the summertime
I get her out when there's nothing else to do
When there's nothing on TV when I can't see you
Wife don't mind if I give her a child
My wife don't mind she thinks it's pretty wild
I've got this girl in a box I got a girl in a box
I'll keep her till the day
I'll keep her till the day
I'll keep her till the day that I die
And I hope I die in the nighttime
With my TV on and a beer in my hand
And you by my side
I got a girl in a box
We play games I'm anything I'm not
But I wanna' be yeah I wanna be
She'll be a slut or a dirty little whore
Or the girl next door or my bride instead
Or I'll cut off her head
If I want to yeah I want to
I'll keep her till the day
I'll keep her till the day
I'll keep her till the day that I die
I've got a girl in a box
I've got a girl in a box <start> So you're out to change the world
You can do it none too fast
You don't want to see your future
Wash away into the past
Now a change is gonna come...
Say it's written on the streets
But there's a monkey on your back
...try to put him on a shelf
And you try to find in others
What you hide inside yourself
And you worry 'bout the war
And you try to understand
But forget about tomorrow
When you're playin' in the band
Stay young at heart
Stay young at heart
Now you've been around the world
Seen the shape of things to come
You begin to feel the damage
From the crazy things we've done
Now the lines are overdrawn
...see 'em bleedin' down your face
And there's a sore and scary monster...
She'sa comin' after you
Stay young at heart
Stay young at heart
You can't be too wise
So open your eyes
Stay young at heart...yea
Now you're weary from the war
But it's time to start again
And you don't know what you're fightin' for
But you'll fight until the end
Now forget about the future
Don'tcha try to understand
There's no need to fear tomorrow
Just keep playin' in the band
Stay young at heart
Stay young at heart
You can't be too wise
So open your eyes
Stay young...stay young
Stay young at heart <start> Stayin' at home waitin' for you
Just won't get it 'cause you say we're through an'
I'm lookin' for someone to love
I'm lookin' for someone to love
Well if you're not here
My baby I don't care
Because I'm lookin' for someone to love
Playin' the field all day long
Since I found out that I was wronged now
I'm lookin' for someone to love
I'm lookin' for someone to love
Well if you're not here
My baby I don't care
Because I'm lookin' for someone to love
Drunk man street car
Foot slipped there you are now
I'm lookin' for someone to love
I'm lookin' for someone to love
Well if you're not here
My baby I don't care
Because I'm lookin' for someone to love
Caught myself thinkin' of you
You can't love me and an other one too
Well I'm lookin' for someone to love
I'm lookin' for someone to love
Well if you're not here
My baby I don't care
Because I'm lookin' for someone to love <start> It's the thing you least expected
When I got back up and the world neglected me.
Well I got the best of them
Ladies I'm now the main event.
Take a hint from me
This is not what you came to see
This is only a minor threat
Ladies and gentleman place your bets
Hold your breath and shut your mouth.
The scene will be the death of us.
I told ya so Hey
Told ya so Hey
Everyone's out to get me
Nothing left to prove to you
Well no one's gonna stop what I do.
Told ya so Hey
Told ya so Hey
Cause everyone's out to get me
Say hello to the brand new me
I gave out all apologies.
I am NOT kissing ass again
Say goodbye to all my faced friends. Goodbye
I'm the one your parents tell you not to hang around
At any moment I could snap and then choke you out.
They need an enemy
Who better than me
Hold your breath and shut your mouth
The scene will be the death of us.
I told ya so Hey
Told ya so Hey
Everyone's out to get me
Nothing left to prove to you
Well no one's gonna stop what I do.
Told ya so Hey
Told ya so Hey
Cause everyone's out to get me
Everyone's out to get...
Ha ha ha
Welcome to the shit show
Introducing yours truly
I'm dependable predictable at watching others fall.
Expect the least you'll get the best
I'm sure you've seen it all.
So confident and comfortable
They call me unforgetable.
Refined at times I never hide
And always so presentable.
Hold your breath and shut your mouth
The scene will be the death of us.
I told ya so Hey
Told ya so Hey
Everyone's out to get me
Nothing left to prove to you
Well no one's gonna stop what I do.
Told ya so Hey
Told ya so Hey
Cause everyone's out to get me
Everyone's out to get... me <start> I've tried to do this on my own
Without the help of telephones
The only place I need to be
Is right here where I'm forced to see that
I can fight against disease
Or let it take me out to sea
Either way I just might drown
I'd rather swim than hit the ground
I'm willing now to do what it takes to see
That the boy looking back in the mirror isn't me
So take back the  step self set help programs
And let me tell you all about how
It was myself that got me here in the first place
And myself that taught me how to replace
Everything I know with every other option
But the only right way to go
Yeah I'm pretty sure that now it shows
I could never see far past my nose
And I'm almost positive these pills
Are the only thing that ever made me ill so
I'll make it through another week
Despite the fact that I can't sleep
The only problem I can see
Is this is not who I'm meant to be and
I'm ready now to do what it takes to see
That the boy looking back in the mirror isn't me
The only thing I have to hold to is a promise
You put another life inside of me
That's not my own
So take back all your self help programs <start> I was standing by my window
On a cold and cloudy day
When I saw the hearse come rolling
To carry mother away
Will the circle be unbroken
By and by Lord by and by
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky Lord in the sky
I said to the undertaker
Undertaker please drive slow
For this lady you are hauling
Lord I hate to see her go
I will follow close behind her
Try to hold up and be brave
But I could not hide my sorrow
When they laid her in her grave
Went back home and home was lonesome
Since my mother she had gone
Found my brothers sisters crying
What a home so sad and lone
Will the circle be unbroken
By and by Lord by and by
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky Lord in the sky <start> The first time
Was the worst time.
The second time
Was worse than the first.
The last time was a great crime
On all things great and small
But this time is gonna be the best.
It's gonna take the other ones off my chest.
It was just in a rut
To fall into a rut.
To fall into a plan greater than mankind.
All the others hate it
All the others set you up.
Can't you smell the satisfaction on thier breath
It's too bad that your music doesn't matter
Your music doesn't matter in a favorite dress.
Sure it wins a blue one.
Stick it on a runnerup.
That's the way to let the loser melt your...
All the others hate it
All the others set you up.
Can't you smell the satisfaction on their breath
All the others hate it
All the others set it up.
Can't you smell the satisfaction on their breath
Sure it wins a blue one.
Stick it on the runnerup.
Pick the way to let the loser melt your mouth.
It's too bad that your music doesn't matter.
I can smell the satisfaction on your breath. <start> oh oh oh oh

Heading for another town
And wish that I was on my way
Looking back on those summer nights
I was wasting time fooling 'round
And there was nothing here to make me stay
Oh but that night I met you
The night you came through made me realize
There's no way I could leave
You made me believe and now when I look in your eyes
I could walk through fire I could feel it burning
And I could walk through fire right back to you
And as the flames get higher you know I'll get stronger
Baby I would walk through fire
It's crazy how these things work out
I used to think I had no chance
And I somehow thought you'd slip away
You pulled me through the fear and doubt
Gave me all I'm looking for
Everything I needed to stay
How could something so good
Something so simple get serious
How could someone so right come into my life
And now I just want you to know
I could walk through fire I could feel it burning
And I could walk through fire right back to you
And as the flames get higher you know I'll get stronger
Baby I could walk through fire
And I would go anywhere I would do anything
I do what you want me to you know that I would
I want you to know that whenever you need me yeah
Ooh wherever you are no matter how far
You know I'll be coming for you
I could walk through fire I could feel it burning
And I could walk through fire to get right back to you
And when the flames get higher you know I'll get stronger
And baby I could walk through fire
Baby I could walk through fire right back to you
And I could walk through fire and I could walk through fire
And I could walk through fire right back to you yeah <start> I climb the marble stairs that lead away
Away from everything I used to know
I try to keep my eyes down on the way
The way my mother told me not to go
Well all I ever wanted was
A hand to hold me down
To keep the sky from swallowing me up
And all I ever needed was someone to come around
And tell me that I've suffered long enough
So take me away
Find me a home
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I wonder when I'll see the stars again
I thought that they had faded long ago
With every step I'm closer to the end
I'm climbing 'cause I don't know where to go
Well all I ever wanted was
A place to store my faith
I thought that I could keep it locked away
It burns my eyes to look at him
And see the truth inside
And so I turn my broken face away
So take me away
Find me a home
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I always dreamed of Sundays together with you
Only your echoes can break my heart
I need a hand to hold me to keep me on land
I fear I'm drifting too far apart
Well all I ever wanted was
A hand to hold me down
To keep the sky from swallowing me up
And all I ever needed was someone to come around
And tell me that I've suffered long enough
Oh take me away
Find me a home
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
On my way
I'm on my way
And now I'm gone
I'm gone
I'm on my way <start> I I walk this Earth
Until I stagger and fall
To my knees
I won't rest my bones
If I'm awake or asleep
There'll be no relief
They say we're tired of love
That we're running away
Leave no stone unturned
Leave no stone unturned
Believe and you shall arrive
The trust has gone bit by bit
'Cause they've been twisting the truth
But our skin is too thick
They say we're tired of love
That we're running away
Leave no stone unturned
Leave no stone unturned
Believe and you shall arrive
They say we're tired of love
And that we're running away
Leave no stone unturned
Leave no stone unturned
Believe and you shall arrive
You shall arrive <start> I've got the urge and soul to go
I've got the green for my juiceride
spent time in sad machines
I've got my kicks on Orleans time
the clock went dead at zerozero
the crowd went dead at dawn
running with my head
you got a million miles to run you got a million miles to go
to get a ticket for the freakshow <start> Wir waren wie Pech und Schwefel
Und wir standen zueinander
Fr uns gab es nur einen Weg
Den man zusammen geht
Wir haben uns durchgeschlagen
Durch die Straen durch Asphalt
Und es war die beste Schule
Innen warm und auen kalt
Vieles ging daneben
Und fr viel hat man gezahlt
Viel geschah mit Liebe
Viel mit Hass viel mit Gewalt
Was ich jedoch lernte
Und was sich auch niemals ndert
Das ist unsere Freundschaft
Ist Zusammenhalt
Sind und bleiben Feinde deiner Feinde
Bis wir sterben
Feinde deiner Feinde bis ins Verderben
Sind und bleiben Feinde deiner Feinde
Bis wir sterben
Freundschaft in die Ewigkeit durch Feuer Dreck und Scherben
Du sagst du hast nur Freunde an deiner Seite
Und darum sage ich zu dir
Du ziehst mit deinen Feinden um die Welt
Denn all die Leute die dir immer nur den Arsch ablecken
Wollen was von dir
Sei es Leistung oder Geld
Missgunst oder Hass
Egoismus oder Gier
Kenne deine Sorte
Darum halt ich nichts von dir
Eines kann ich sagen
Eine Sache ist gewiss
Dass du nichts als nur ein Arschloch
Und schon gar kein Kumpel bist
Sind und bleiben Feinde deiner Feinde
Bis wir sterben
Feinde deiner Feinde bis ins Verderben
Sind und bleiben Feinde deiner Feinde
Bis wir sterben
Freundschaft in die Ewigkeit durch Feuer Dreck und Scherben
Es gab nichts was man nicht wusste
Es gab nichts was man verschwieg
Oh ja und wenn es einem schlecht ging wurde aus Niederlage Sieg
Ich vermisse das Gefhl was all die anderen nicht hatten
Wir alle waren das Licht und die anderen unser Schatten.
Sind und bleiben Feinde deiner Feinde
Bis wir sterben
Feinde deiner Feinde bis ins Verderben
Sind und bleiben Feinde deiner Feinde
Bis wir sterben
Freundschaft in die Ewigkeit durch Feuer Dreck und Scherben
Zusammen Seite an Seite bis wir irgendwann sterben
Weg von falschen Freunden raus aus dem Verderben
Auf denselben Fhrten vereint erwachsen werden.
Feinde deiner Feinde durch Feuer Dreck und Scherben <start> No sign of life
Pulsing through these aging veins
I bet it's your age that's easier for you to say
Forcing answers into questions
And worrying that you might stop breathing
On and on we sift through alphabets of life
That never get us anywhere anyway
I'd like you to feel we have the best intentions
I want you to know that I know it's not easy
I want you to know that I know it's not easy
Easy easy
Then there's a peak you reach
Out to somebody that's never even there
Somebody that you may hope that they might care
For nearby health or distant welfare
I'm pleased to hear that you're warm 'cause I'm freezing
Yeah I'm freezing
Coold
I don't want to be alone is that out of the question
I'd like to have you home is that too obvious
Quit being pushed around stand on my feet
And kick all these losers out of my street
I've been losing confidence in the heat
Just when I'm feeling the strength I get weak
I've been losing confidence in the heat
Just when I'm feeling the strength I get weak

Dubadadubadadoo <start> you're whole again now
its an obvious reflection
can see it in my neck
taking slow dancing lessons
nervous laughter filled the voids
when I declared you your own holiday
your voices sound different though I've heard it before
remember the winters that we slept in the car
you said your crooked legs don't walk so well
I said my eyes were tired and declared
you your own holiday
you'll be here <start> I never knew she's gone she's flown away
Everyone said she's not your kind of girl
I'm so alone this girl is flowin' fear
Everyone said she fucked up this time
It's my brand new world today
And it's my brand new world this way
I'll never change it's wrong so go away
Everyone said she's not your kind of girl
I've tasted love it burns I'm so afraid
Everyone said she fucked up this time
I think this fucking witch knows the way
And everything I feel
It's all mine <start> There was a lonesome cowboy who rode his horse all day
At night he slept in the moonlight till he heard that midnight train
And then that lonesome cowboy looked up at the stars in the sky
I will leave my land and my horses on that midnight train I will ride
To the city far across the plains
To that city on that midnight train here it comes
Choo choo choo on that midnight train
And then that lonesome cowboy stepped into a bar
A pretty girl slid over nice and easy Boy your money won't go far.
She took him outside to an alley he got dragged into a fight
And a bullet sent him dying and he cursed that moonless night
In that city far across the plains
In that city he should hear that midnight train down the line
Choo choo choo he could hear that midnight train
And now that lonesome cowboy is lain beneath the clay
His horses they're still waiting for he is gone away
Now if you think the grass is greener on the far side of the hill
All you cowboys take it easy there's no grass there at all
In that city far across the plains
In that city you'd better miss that midnight train here it comes
Choo choo choo you'd better miss that midnight train
Choo choo choo that train is coming for you. <start> The aftermath is worst
But you were never to cease
The burdens you breeze allover the sheets
There's no light fall in your eyes
We'll get left
Let go let go

You should've saved my sorry ass
You should've been available
You should've been available
You should've been available
You could've saved my life my life
I love you you should've been available
You should've been alive
But this lecture's in reverse
But this lecture's in reverse <start> Well I see you got your
Brand new leopardskin pillbox hat
Yes I see you got your
Brand new leopardskin pillbox hat
Well you must tell me baby how your
Head feels under somethin' like that
Under your brand new leopardskin pillbox hat
Well you look so pretty in it
Honey can I jump on it sometime
Yes I just wanna see
If it's really that expensive kind
You know it balances on your head just like a
Mattress balances on a bottle of wine
Your brand new leopardskin pillbox hat
Well if you wanna see the sun rise
Honey I know where
We'll go out and see it sometime
We'll both just sit there and stare
Me with my belt wrapped around my head
And you just sittin' there
In your brand new leopardskin pillbox hat
Well I asked the doctor if I could see you
It's bad for your health he said
Yes I disobeyed his orders
I came to see you but I found him there instead
You know I don't mind him cheatin' on me but I
Sure wish he'd take that off his head
Your brand new leopardskin pillbox hat <start> kissing you winter morning I don't have the strength to say goodbye. Sat around and drank all day knowing that tomorrow I'll be gone. Cause I'm so in love with you
and tonight when they played our song on the radio and tonight I thought everything I loved you're the girl that I'm dreaming of
kissing you in winter morning thinking back to how it felt last night. I love you seems to hold it's meaning even though they're just words after all. And these words seem to mean
tonight I'll sing you songs until you fall asleep whisper every word into a smile and think of just how good this life could be with me... <start> I took a trip
On a gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I passed through the shadow of jupiter
And I thought about you
I shot my spacegun
And boy I really felt blue
Two or three flying saucers
Parked under the stars
The winding stream
Moon shining down
On some little town
And with each beam
The same old dream
I took a trip
On a gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I shot my spacegun
And I thought about you
I pulled down my sun visor
Boy I really felt blue
You jumped into your gemini
I jumped into mine
We'll orbit the moon
For just one time
Tomorrow night
Tomorrow night
Will you hold hands
With me in the moonlight
I took a trip
In a gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I shot my spacegun
And I thought about you
I took
I took a walk in space
Boy I really felt blue
Well I peeked through the crack
And I looked way back
The stardust trail
Leading back to you
What did I do
What could I do
Yes what did I do
Well
I thought about you
I thought about you
Took a trip
On a gemini spacecraft
Thought about you <start> Inside...
The dark is fading away
I don't want to feel alone anymore
Inside...
The light of dawn is here once more
The light...
Darkness is slipping away
Of dawn...
I don't want to be alone
Is here...
Won't you stay
Not a word passed your lips
Just a golden kiss
As I whispered silently
Help me through this <start> She Wolf  You can tell by the way she moves
She Wolf  You can tell she dont't play games to lose
She Wolf  She eats men who can't pass her by
She Wolf  She's on the prowl another's gonna die
DIE
She's the blonde queen of the silver screen 
Smashing the weak of the single's scene.
Is she the hawk the hunter or the hunted
Will she cut them down from the hangin tree
Dressed to kill in black and red 
Wanders late at night she wants to be fed.
Men can't resist her they haven't got the will
She Wolf moves in for the kill.
She Wolf grabs her men by the throats and yells
This is what i need
She Wolf rips their heads off shrieking
Open up and bleed
Take the strange case of the missing husband
Of the widow at the end of the street
Friday night he went to the pub with his buddies
To have a couple of drinks.
As his eyes started to wander
She Wolf spun her web.
As harmless as a spider
She offered him her bed.
She Wolf grabbed him by the throat and yelled
This is what i need
She Wolf ripped his head off shrieking
Open up and bleed
Mother's life was stolen
By the wicked hands of man.
Unholy maggot on her soul to the end
In death she made her last stand
I was raped of love of life 
Man took from women ALL.
No more subservient wife
No longer do I bid your call.
As a blood oath then
I offer you my girl.
NEVER AGAIN WILL WOMAN BE
NIGGER OF THE WORLD
She Wolf grabs them by the throats and yells
This is what i need
She Wolf rips their heads off screaming
Open up and bleed
She Wolf  You can tell by the way she moves
She Wolf  You can tell she dont't play games to lose
She Wolf  She eats men who can't pass her by
She Wolf  She's on the prowl another's gonna die
She Wolf

Crow of two Mirth
You see crow of three Wed
Crow of four Birth
You see crow of five Rich
Crow of six thief
You see crow of seven Leave
Crow of eight Grief
If you see crows high in the sky
Call out their number
You'll know the reason why
You see crow of nine Shh

You see crow of eleven Love
Crow of twelve Tomorrow <start> A man out of country
A fish out of string
A square in the circle of souls
Its been way too long since Ive been home
Lord get me back to my roots <start> If you'd like to make a call please hang up and try again
If you need help hang up and then dial your operator
Those times
When there was something inside
Something to fight for
Something in you
 I don't care
Anymore....
I've wasted too much time already
I can't take anymore of your manipulation
I can feel my patience breaking
You wanted me to come down with you
Well here I am
You said somewhere that I oughta know
And you weren't gonna let me forget the pain I left you in
I can see your promise breaking
Isn't it ironic
You oughta know
There isn't anything left in me
That your sick repulsive ways haven't taken away
Stop your suicidal faking
Oh you're so persecuted
You oughta know
You oughta know
You oughta know <start> And wondering where it's at
When down came a dragon
With a wizard on his back
He said to us
Step up wanna take you for a trip
Then up we flew off into space
And the astral gates we slipped alright
Looking back behind us
To the freaks and heads we wave
And off beyond our system out
Until they're deep in space
And on the edge of time and space
There stood two towers black
But on we flew the wizard knew
There was no turning back <start> Phone Rings




Try to get you on the phone
But your mother always says you're gone
And you ain't coming home
Girl I'm sleeping alone
Try to get you on the line
And ask you to be mine
But you're so hard to find
Girl I'm sleeping alone
Baby girl she makes the good motion
Make no mistake she's deep as the ocean
Jake never sleeps in the heart of the city
And God'll never make another woman this pretty
And I can never guess why she even messed wit' me
Word to P.Diddy
I treated her shitty
I'm sick of cliches like opposites attract
When they drop the drum track
Screaming Baby come back
Reality bites like pit bull fights
I jump outta bed and throw on my lights
Your clothes are all gone
And you ain't there
And your makeup drawer is empty
I found an old picture of you washing your hair
And now we ain't even friendly
Try to get you on the phone
But your mother always says you're gone
And you ain't coming home
Girl I'm sleeping alone
Try to get you on the line
And beg you to be mine
But you're so hard to find
Girl I'm sleeping alone
Ain't too many kids that bang like this shorty
She'll sip champagne
She'll come drink a forty
Got a smell that intice
Dress kinda sporty
In public she's nice
In private she's naughty
I had every man's dream in the palm of my hand
And fucked it all up like the Taliban
She left town with my ring and wrecked all our plans
And I don't even care about the fifty grand
Man the hell with the cash cause that ain't the point
We used to sit around and laugh as we smokin' the joint
We used to watch TV and eat chicken wings
We had tickle fights
We did the wild things
Now I'm all alone up in my room
This house is feelin' empty
We used to talk about being bride and groom
And now we ain't even friendly
Try to get you on the phone
But your mother always says you're gone
And you ain't coming home
Girl I'm sleeping alone
Try to get you on the line
And beg you to be mine
But you're so hard to find
Girl I'm sleeping alone
Me corazon
Ain't comin' home
The sweetest thing I've ever known
Turned off her phone
Left me alone
The pain that cuts down to the bone
It can't be fixed
Scars don't heal
None of these chiks out here is real
Some of these chicks got sex appeal
But their souls all come up empty
Put me in the mix girl what's the deal
All I'm trying to be is friendly
Try to get you on the phone
But your mother always says you're gone
And you ain't coming home
Girl I'm sleeping alone
Try to get you on the line
And beg you to be mine
But you're so hard to find
Girl I'm sleeping alone <start>

Muscles and fields of green
Shovel the last few crumbs
Of generosity
Open heart open mind open mouth open vein

Someday the rains will come
My blistered hands tell me

I'll keep coming back
smaller and smaller and smaller
squash me
smaller and smaller and smaller

smaller and smaller and smaller
under the topsoil
smaller and smaller and smaller
under the fingernail
smaller and smaller and smaller
then small becomes all becomes all.......

 <start> Thirteen valleys he has wandered for her love
For he thinks he is the one that she dreams of
But her bed was made elsewhere
From the first day she got there
Now he wanders thirteen valleys crying out
Now he wanders thirteen valleys crying out
It could've been me
I said it could've been me.
A broken heart needs someone new to blame it on
A broken heart needs someone new to blame it on
Thirteen valleys she has gone since morning came
For she gave so much that only love remained
But her lover is long gone
With the money she sent home
Now she wanders thirteen valleys crying out
Now she wanders thirteen valleys crying out
It could've been me
I said it could've been me.
A broken heart needs someone new to blame it on
A broken heart needs someone new to blame it on
That broken heart will be forever and a lifetime
That broken heart will dry up love that's gone before
And you may fight and you may run
But what was past is now undone
A broken heart needs someone new to blame it on
A broken heart needs someone new to blame it on
Thirteen valleys lie in silence in the haze
Filled with promises and spirits that we raised
But the spirits all are ghosts
Of the ones we hurt the most
And they wander thirteen valleys crying out
And they wander thirteen valleys crying out
It could've been me
I said it could've been me.

First I'm fallin' to my knees then I'm hangin' by my tail
Asked the doctor for some medicine
He said there's nothin' we can do
Preacher said it's gonna kill you son
Mama dropped the chicken soup
Chorus
I'm gonna need a little help help help
While I'm getting' over you
I'm just a flicker of my self self self
Your hurt has cooled my fire into
If you could spare a little touch touch touch
I might survive a week or two
I'm gonna need a little help help help
While I'm getting' over you
Ever since you made me leave can't remember wrong or right
When I'm up I wanna sleep When I'm asleep I wanna fight
Dialled the number for emergency sheriff said to tough it out
I called my psychic friend on channel three
And she confirmed without a doubt
Chorus
Bells are ringin' in my ears wolf is howlin' in the yard
But the only thing I hear is the poundin' of my heart
I saw my picture in the evening news I had a caption by my head
They polled the people for the public view
And nearly everybody said

I'm gonna need a little help help help
I'm gonna need a little help help help <start> Solitary views of the other side of a plane we've yet to know
Will we ever get the chance to walk alone
In this life or when we find out that we're home
What will we hear there
Love me love me
Why don't you know me know me
Hold me hold me
And trust me trust me
Inhabitations through
I can finally forget a past you say you never knew
I reach my hands to the sky
Love me love me
Why don't you know me know me
Hold me hold me
And trust me trust me
Love me love me
Why don't you know me know me
Hold me hold me
And trust me trust me
There's a time and place
An unknown region of space
I can meet you all there
Throw your arms in the air
Hands towards the sky
And you'll hear
Hands towards the sky
And you'll hear
Love me love me
Why don't you know me know me
Hold me hold me
And trust me trust me
Love me love me
Why don't you know me just know me
Hold me hold me
And trust me trust me <start> You're playing tug of war with your tongue.
You're playing Russian roulette with a loaded gun.
I don't think you realize we have no time to waste.
Do you even understand
We're going over the same old thing
You take and take will you ever give
It's been the same for so long
Same old song just tagging along.
Don't think you're getting the best of what I got
You've got it coming one day.
Maybe maybe not.
The outcome will show in the end
I never called you a friend.
Said what you said more than enough
I don't have the time the going is getting tough <start> We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there in the balcony in summer air
See the lights see the party the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say Hello
Little did I know
There I was Romeo I was throwing pebbles
And your daddy said Stay away from Juliet
I was crying on the staircase
Begging you please don't go
'Cause you belong with me
If you could see
That I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along
So why can't you see
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know
Baby you belong with me
You belong with me
So glad you made time to see me
How's life Tell me how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good busier than ever
Small talk work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
It's still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December all the time
Someday I'll be living in a big ol' city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Oh someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Why you gotta be so mean
The stakes are high the waters rough
But this love is ours
We are never ever ever getting back together
This love is ours
We are never ever ever getting back together
This love is ours
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
We are never getting back together
Shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
We are never getting back together
Shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
I'm feeling 
Losing her was blue like I'd never known
Missing her was dark grey all alone
Forgetting her is like trying to know somebody you never met
Loving her was red so red
Loving her was red so red
Loving her was red so red
Loving her was red so red <start> You've got your priorities
Respect and loyalty
You've got your job and all your things
Your house and company
Look around it's what you wanted
Look around it's what you started
You're giving up on what we had
On what we had
Runaway with me
And don't look back
Spend your days with me
And make this last
It's something that you never see
My sadness or my plea
This isn't how you used to be
A boy run by his greed
Look around it's what you wanted
Look around it's what you started
You're giving up on what we had
On what we had
Runaway with me
And don't look back
Spend your days with me
And make this last
Runaway with me
I know you can
Find a way and please
Forget the past
There are changes in our lives
There's a way we can survive <start> Blinded but now I see my choice is my destiny
I got back what I lost but was it worth the cost
My back is turned you can't wait to speak
No balls to back up what you preach
BLINDED YOUR BLINDED
The time will come when someone calls your bluff
Your gonna burn enoughs enough
CAUSE YOU ARE BLINDED BY THE LIGHT AGAIN x <start> Una vieja de Madrid con un sombrero
un paraguas de papel de arroz y cana de bamb.
Capitanes valerosos listos contrabandistas noctmbulos.
Jesuitas en accin vestidos como unos bonzos
en antiguas cortes con emperadores de la dinastia Ming
Busco un centro de gravedad permanente
que no vere lo que ahora pienso de las cosas de la gente
yo necesito un centro di gravit permanente
che non mi faccia mai cambiare idea sulle cose sulla gente.
Over and over again.
En las calles era Mayo y caminbamos juntos
contando entre bromas manojos de ortigas.
No soporto ciertas modas
la falsa msica rock la new wave espanola
el free jazz punkie ingls ni la monserga africana.
Busco un centro de gravedad permanente
que no vare lo que ahora pienso de las cosas de la gente
yo necesito un centro di gravit permanente
che non mi faccia mai cambiare idea sulle cose sulla gente.
Over and over again. <start> From the album sutras
Walking talking along a lonely shore
With your hair blowing soft on the breeze
I do dream you into my life
Gift me your love if you please
Please don't bend my heart
Made of glass
I can't promise to be here for you
Please don't bend my heart
She said to me
I can't promise to be here be here be here for you
Oh what a night the moon shining bright
Your kisses are sweeter than wine
Music floats on the breeze from the town
I lead you holding your hand in mine
Now you're trembling beneath my lips
Soon I'll be gone to the south
We say nothing we two just know
No words of woe from our mouths <start> Is that you crawling
Outside My Window
Creeping me out tonight
How come you
Choose me to suffer
Everytime I turn out the lights
I thought I got free
I thought I got away
But you come back
To fight another day
You drag it out
You drag me down
Its always the same
When you come around
You drag the skeletons
Out of the closet
I gotta move on
But you gotta knock it
You drag the skeletons
Out of the closet
Somehow youbring
Out the worst in me
Im a victim of your split personality
Youre the nightmares
Inside my head
Youre the monster
Underneath the bed
You drag the skeletons
Out of the closet
I gotta move on
But you gotta knock it
You drag the skeletons
Out of the closet
Dont wanna turn off the light
Dont wanna turn off the light
Dont wanna turn off the light <start> We went to where the bodies were sent
Cause the askes fall like rain
Smoke fills the sky with bodies in line
With numbers fr their names
Relapse in time is all to familier
When i hear the sounds of trains
Where's everybody
Where's all the bodies go
Where they go
And the world will fall asleep again
As the new plague spreads and marches in
With your new eyes you won't see your graves
With your new ears hear them say...
We've gouged out our eyes
Stabbed in our ears
So the noise won't carry pain
Lock up the doors close in the curtains
And pretend the world is safe
When they starve for death
We'll give them hunger and they'll
Forfit all their screams
Where's everbody
Where's all the bodies
Where they go
And the world will fall asleep again
As the new plague spreads and marches in
With your new eyes you won't see your graves
With your new ears hear them say...
The bodies are burningbodies are burning.....
Death fills the room we gasp out for air
And they chamber our last breath
So lay down with the world
Her eyes had blackened while the fires settle in
The face pile in we patch up the holes
And let the sirens be the end
Where's everybody
Where's all the bodies
Where they go
And the world will fall asleep again
As the new plague spreads and marches in
With your new eyes you won't see your graves
With your new ears hear them say... <start> Are we safe alone tonight
The ... moans an eagle crying out but trying not to choke
He looks for somewhere safe to die
His never trying heart you bullshit me to give it one more time
Although my instinct wants him to survive
All of the digits stand and look up height
Look at the light That's like something
And I'm sorry I caught you in my life
Eagle on my head tonight...
That always seems a bit too high
I could touch you with my...
And now the mountains I can't climb
I'm just eating for something
And I'm sorry I caught you in my life
I'm hunting and I don't know why
Now my heart is taking over
Now my heart is taking over
And evil start talking
It's hard to know why
Are we speaking our mind
Or just passing the time
It's addictive like ...
But that holds up the...
But I liked you ... and talking to you <start> In the not very distant future
When everything will be free
There won't be any cute secrets
Let alone any novelty
You can say anything you want to
In your fetching cloak of anonymity
Are you feeling out of breath now
In your desperate pursuit of infamy
Two lovers rocking up and down
In an elevator
 minutes later
They'll make a killing in the market
They knew how to work it
On that close circuit
My my it's a terrible disgrace
You'll find these days that there's
No hiding place
How proud you are
You have the knack
You're howling in a vacuum
Whatever I said about you
I didn't say it behind your back
I paid for my immortal sins
I know the enemy within you
As it seems these days
There is no hiding place
Next time someone wants to hurt you
Or set alight your effigy
Don't call on me to help you out
Don't come crying to me sympathy
You stay there with your daubs and scratches
While I summon up the red machine
I'll be handing someone matches
And carrying a can of kerosene
Walk up to me
And say what you said
See how brave you are
When I'm about this far away
You sit in judgment and bitch
Well baby that's rich
You're nothing but a snitch
Na na na na na  na na
Na na na na na  na na
Na na na na na  na na
My my it's a terrible disgrace 
You'll find these days that there's
No hiding place <start> There's a place I must go
There's a place I must go
It's not a place I have seen
But I'll get there in a blue dream
Down an ocean road
Past a sign that says 'good love town'
Into a darkness where the stars do drown
Where the starry me needs to be free
And when the battle was done
I was promised my sun
But with a thousand nights gone
To any kingdom I run
And when the battle was done
I was promised my sun
But with a thousand knights gone
To any kingdom I run
There's a place I must go
There's a place I must go
For my heart is a child
That stumbles lonely for the arms of the wild
Hear the desert sigh
Sing the city's lullaby
The giant iris of the wide blue sky
Showing me the way
And when the battle was done
I was promised my son
But with a thousand knights gone
To any kingdom I run
And when the battle was done
I was promised my son
But with a thousand knights gone
To any kingdom I run
You know that it's time to go up up up up up
Had a big machine riding your shoulders
You know that it's time to go up up up up up
Had a big machine riding your shoulders
You know that it's time to go up up up up up
Had a big machine riding your shoulders <start> Some stupid guy with his head in the clouds
Thinks the world is a wondrous place
Next thing you know as he's looking around
Plane hits him in the face
A sight for sore eyes are couples who think
Marriage is not for them
They want their children to know their dad
Is only their partner's friend
I'm going backwards the way I came in
Going forward the same way out
I've got some blue chips to go with my fish
Which is still swimming round about
The sight of a pedophile being abused
A stalker being followed home
Who wouldn't give their right arm to see
A scientist being cloned
What do you do when your think you're in love
And she tells you you must be sure
How do you manage to get out of that
When you know that her heart is pure
On the wings of a dove fight has broken out
Someone flew in a rage hurling drinks about
I'm gonna love you as long as I can
For as long as we both agree
I'm gonna leave you the rest of my life
Along with some jewelry
A sight for sore eyes are couples who think
There's no need for men
If they want a child they just go to a lab
Get it artificially insemmed
Some stupid guy has his arm in a lock
And he can't seem to find the key
Someone should tell him it's probably where
The key to his heart would be
And I'll cry like a big girl
And I'll kick like an ass
Who needs 
 plus is a gas
I'm gonna love you as long as I can
For as long as we both shall live
I'm going to leave you the rest of my life
For as long as it's mine to give
As long as it's mine to give <start> Shell fix you with an iron cross
And cover you up with petals
And hang you up with some amber beads
And four or five precious metals
And in that black flamingo chair
Youll sit among her trophies
And pray to be abandoned
Till you dont know what hope is
Chorus
But theres one thing that I had to keep inside
Because I was shaking
Why dont you get some pride
There was a clown strike
And the clowns threw down their tools
But you dont have to play so hard
And Im nobodys fool
You dont have to go so far
Cause I love you as you are
The big top is deserted now
And the circus girl rehearses
She knows how to turn their heads
And not fall between two horses
But all that seems a simple step
If only I were able
To love you like I want to do
And not by some times table
Chorus
And its pandemonium
For the humble and the mighty
You dont have to tumble for me
Even a clown knows when to strike
Tell me what you want of me
Or are you terrified of failure
You put on a superstitious face
Behind all this paraphernalia
Were not living in a masquerade
Where you only have three wishes
It isn't easy to see
In a lifetime of mistaken kisses
Chorus
In this pandemonium
For the humble and the mighty
You dont have to tumble for me
Even a clown knows when to strike <start> My world is empty without you
Sometimes I feel so empty without you
Without a soul to help me thru these dark and lonely days
of wishing I could be more successful in my own ways
I sleep so little again
I get sick every morning from the evenings grain
And my eyes just hang so heavy
over the smile that hides my pain
and my heart lies in the basement
While my thoughts go thru the roof
I only wish that I had told the truth
This is such an empty world such an empty glass
There's not enough words in this world to forget the past
I only wish that I had told the truth
My world is empty without you
Sometimes I feel so empty Betty blue
Without my soul without my mind
Without my heart I am hard to find
Sometimes I feel so empty in this world without you <start> It was a teenage wedding and the old folks wished 'em well
You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle
And now the young monsieur and madam have rung the chapel bell
C'est la vie say the old folks it goes to show you never can tell
They finished off an apartment with a tworoom Roebuck sale
The coolerator was jammed with TV dinners and ginger ale
And when Pierre found work the little money comin' worked out well
C'est la vie say the old folks it goes to show you never can tell
They had a hifi phono boy did they let it blast
Seven hundred little records all blues rock rhythm and jazz
But when the sun went down the volume went down as well
C'est la vie say the old folks it goes to show you never can tell
They bought a soupedup jitney it was a cherry red '
And drove it down to New Orleans to celebrate their anniversary
It was there where Pierre was wedded to the lovely mademoiselle
C'est la vie say the old folks it goes to show you never can tell <start> Siempre tuve un defecto no se decir q no
y pasadas las cuatro mi cara era un error
entrancado como un idiota fui
con el moo en la cabeza
buscando en esas tetas el calor
para poder sobrevivir
a la agona d la noche
a la desdicha d sentirme un mercenario del alcohol
y alejarme entre los gritos y los tragos
otra vez solo un perdedor
Salimos d aquella histeria hacia otro lugar
huyendo d los colmillos d la soledad
regalado ofrec el sabor d aquellos k en albergues
se hacen tibios y no llevan al orgasmo ganador
que ganador
Fue ahi q comprobe q siempre puede haber algo peor
fue as q comprobe q la angustia es prima d la desesperacion
y que a veces tal vez estar solo es mejor
y q al cielo no se llega nunca d a dos
Me quede dormido y con ganas d mear
no existe peor remedio q la enfermedad
fin del turno lo molesto seor
a este animal nocturo la maana lo encotro al huir
sin higado sin pecho y sin amor <start> defacto segregation
seperates the nation
it won't bring me down
no they won't bring me down
they got fourty one bombs on dynamite hill
where they aim to shoot
shoot to kill
they will not bring me down
no they won't bring me down
back when the bean town lost the beat
a southern mentality
somewhere out there somewhere usa
i don't mind what i read today
kick it out the back door
look at your usa <start> Ich seh' von Natur aus eigentlich ganz gut aus
War eigentlich immer ganz zufrieden mit mir
Doch von einem auf den anderen Tag
Ist pltzlich alles ganz anders
Ich red' mir ein was Besonderes zu sein
Will ich das wirklich sein
Und ich sag' eher ja als nein
DENN MDCHEN MGEN SIEGER
WIE DU'S AUCH DREHST
WIE DU'S AUCH WENDEST
ES WIRD IMMER SO
Was ist eigentlich blo mit meinen Freunden los
Fhren sich auf wie beim Sommerschluverkauf
Alles war so einfach
Wir haben nie viel nachgedacht
Mu das denn wirklich sein
Und ich sag eher ja als nein
REFRAIN
Red' Dir ruhig ein was Besonderes zu sein
Will ich das wirklich sein
Und ich sag' eher ja als nein
REFRAIN
Wer will schon 'nen Verlierer
Verlierer als Freund
Ich kann das wirklich gut verstehen
REFRAIN <start> What if I could reach outside these walls
What if I could loose my doubt
And rise above it all
For just a moment
To see what's waiting for me
And not be dreaming
Look into the eyes of Jesus
And feel the touch of sweet forgiveness
Hear the voice that bids me come
Into His open arms I'll run
Oh won't that be heavenly
To be known
To know You face to face
To be home
To let go of my fear
And know I'm safe
For just a moment
To see it as it will be
It's more than I could dream
Look into the eyes of Jesus
And feel the touch of sweet forgiveness
Hear the voice that bids me come
Into His open arms I'll run
Oh won't that be heavenly
In one heartbeat
I'll feel the air of Heaven as it breathes in me
The strength to run to fly
Not just a moment but for all time
Won't that be heavenly
Oh He bids me come
Into His open arms I'll run
Oh won't that be heavenly
Oh what a day that will be
Won't that be heavenly
Won't that be heavenly
Won't that be heavenly <start> You could have been all I wanted
But you weren't honest
Now get in the ground
You choked off the sorriest of favors
But if you really loved me
You would've endured my will
If you're just as I presumed
You're a whore in sheep's clothing
Fucking up all I do
Yeah and if oh here we've stopped
Then never again will you see this in your life
And onto the glory at my right hand
Here laid to rest is our love ever low
With truth on the shores of confession
You seem to take premise to all of these so
You stormed off to scar the armada
Like Jesus played leader
I'll drill through your hands
The stone for the curse you have blamed me
With love and devotion I'll die as you sleep
But if you could just write me out
To never this wonder
Happy will I become
Be true that this is no option
So with I condemn you demon pray demon out
And on to the glory at my right hand
Here laid to rest is our love ever low
With truth on the shores of confession
You seem to take premise to all of these so
One last kiss for you
One more wish 'til you
Please make up your mind girl I'll do anything for you
One last kiss for you
One more wish 'til you
Please make up your mind girl before I hope you die <start> Here we are with our backs against the wall
We've got big city dreams
But we don't move from the asphalt
We run away from our own imagination
But at the same time we got this amazing fascination
We've got hopes on the horizon
We can't stop from climbing the mountain
We're sick and tired of keeping silent
We are we are we are
We are gonna come together
We're gonna come together now
We are gonna run together
We're gonna turn it upside down
'Cause with the smoke in the mirror
I can't see your face
So let's run to the fire escape
Come together
We're gonna come together now
Who are they with their socalled innovations
They hold on like they've found their own salvation
They shy away from the slightest alteration
But at the same time we got the same fascinations
We've got hopes on the horizon
We can't stop from climbing the mountain
We're sick and tired of keeping silent
We are we are we are
We are gonna come together
We're gonna come together now
We are gonna run together
We're gonna turn it upside down
'Cause with the smoke in the mirror
I can't see your face
So let's run to the fire escape
Come together
We're gonna come together now
Just let go it's a free fall
We're almost home it's a free fall
We are gonna come together
We're gonna come together now
We are gonna run together
We're gonna turn it upside down
We are gonna come together
We're gonna come together now
We are gonna run together
We're gonna turn it upside down
'Cause with the smoke in the mirror
I can't see your face
So let's run to the fire escape
Come together
We're gonna come together now <start> Strive for power after hours
All the kids have been devoured
We slipped away through all the trash and traffic
To catch a glimpse gazing up at the stars
But all we saw were satellite advertisements
Reading 'You're ours'
Got consumed by all I consumed
They say nature hates a vacuum
We slipped away through all the trash and traffic
To catch a glimpse gazing up at the stars
But all we saw were satellite advertisements
Reading 'You're ours'
Drive with the throng make the old young
Make the weak strong improve our complexion
We slipped away through all the trash and traffic
To catch a glimpse gazing up at the stars
But all we saw were satellite advertisements
Reading 'You're ours'
We get faster and louder
We get deeper and farther
With insatiable hunger
Give us all of it all or nothing
All of it all or nothing

Sarsaparilla <start> Don't talk I will listen
Don't talk you keep your distance
For I'd rather hear some truth tonight than entertain your lies
So take you poison silently
Let me be let me close my eyes
Don't talk I'll believe it
Don't talk listen to me instead
I know that if you think of it both long enough and hard
The drink you drown your troubles in is the trouble you're in now
Talk talk talk about it if you talk as if you care
But when your talk is over tilt that bottle in the air
Tossing back more than your share
Don't talk I can guess it
Don't talk well now you're restless
And you need somewhere to put the blame for how you feel inside
You'll look for a close and easy mark and you'll see me as fair game
Talk talk talk about it you talk as if you care
But when your talk is over you tilt that bottle in the air
Tossing back more than your share
You talk talk talk about it you talk as if you care
I'm marking every word and can tell this time for sure
Your talk is the finest I have heard
So don't talk I was sleeping
Don't talk let me go on dreaming
How your eyes they glow so fiercely I can tell you're inspired
By the name you just chose for me now what was it Oh never mind it
We will talk talk talk about this when your head is clear
I'll discuss this in the morning but until then you may talk but I won't hear <start> Happy death men stand in lines
Happy death men
Happy death men polish and shine
Happy death men

Okay
Here we go... <start> This is actually a Ray Charles version. I don't know if Dr. Feelgood is the
same song or not.
Ive Got News For You  Ray Charles
You said before me met
that your life was awful tame
Well I took you to a night club
and the whole band knew your name. Oh
Well baby baby baby
I've Got News For You
Oh somehow your story don't ring true
Well I've got news for you.
Well you phoned me you'd be late
cause you took the wrong express
and then you walked in smiling
with your lipstick all a mess
Oh let me say to you little mama
Wo I've Got News for you
Ah your story don't ring true lil girl
Yeah I've got news for you.


Oh you wore a diamond watch
claimed it was from Uncle Joe.
When I looked at the inscription
it said love from DaddyO.
Oh well baby wo lil girl I wanna say
I've Got News For You.
Ah if you think that jive will do
Let me tell you oh
I've Got News For You
Well somehow your story don't ring true
Wo I've Got News For You. <start> I've seen a love that rolls like thunder
I've seen a love that falls like rain
That kind of love it makes me wonder
Why my love causes me so much pain
I see my ring as it spins on the table
A perfect circle on the dusty wood
Tells of a life the love and the laughter
Cries my tears for the times that were good
I've seen a love that rolls like thunder
I've seen a love that falls like rain
That kind of love it makes me wonder
Why my love causes me so much pain
One gets lost one gets lonely
In another world love remains
That kind of love takes away all your empty
That kind of love takes away all your shame
I've seen a love that rolls like thunder
I've seen a love that falls like rain
That kind of love it makes me wonder
Why my love causes me so much pain
And our kind of love it burns like summer
Like I'm rolling down some old heartache road
And all my running and my demons
Can't seem to lift it
Can't seem to lift that love
I've seen a love that rolls like thunder
I've seen a love that falls like rain
That kind of love it makes me wonder
Why my love causes me pain <start> Verse  Alex Varkatzas
It's the end of the world and nobody cares
We got problems of our own
So nobody stares at themselves in the mirror anymore
A good hard look can shake you to the core so
Chorus Brandon Saller
Do you know who you are
Part of the solution or the one at fault yeah
Look in your heart
Verse  Alex Varkatzas and Marc McKnight
Pull the pin be careful where the fragments go
Live for yourself don't care about collateral
Damage and such dont mean too much
When your heads stuck up in your own asshole
It's easy not to see 
To be blind to the fact that the problems
That lay before us as a we 
Were created by a lack of our respect so
Chorus Brandon Saller
Do you know who you are
Part of the solution or the one at fault yeah
Look in your heart
In your heart
Do you know yeah who you are
In your heart

Outro Brandon Saller and Alex Varkatzas

The twenty second of loneliness
And we've been through so many things.
I love my man with all honesty
But I know he's cheating on me.
Look him in the eyes
But all he tells me is lies to keep me near.
I'll never leave him down though I might mess around.
It's only 'cause I need some affection oh.
So I creep yeah just creepin' on
On the down low 'cept nobody is supposed to know.
So I creep yeah 'cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show oh.
So I creep.
The twenty third of loneliness
And we don't talk like we used to do.
Now this is pretty strange
But I'm not buggin' 'cause I still feel the same.
I Keep giving loving till the day he pushes me away.
Never go a stray.
If he knew the things I did he couldn't handle me.
And I choose to keep him protected Oh.
So I creep yeah just creepin' on
But I'll know. 'cept nobody is supposed to know.
So I creep yeah 'cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show oh.
So I creep yeah just creepin' on
But I'll know. 'cept nobody is supposed to know.
So I creep yeah 'cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show.
So I creep yeah just creepin' on
But I'll know. 'cept nobody is supposed to know.
So I creep yeah 'cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show. <start> Back then long time ago when grass was green
Woke up in a daze
Arrived like strangers in the night
Fab long time ago when we was fab
Fab back when income tax was all we had
Caresses fleeced you in the morning light
Casualties at dawn
And we did it all
Fab long time ago when we was fab
Fab you are my world you are my only love
And while you're in this world
The fuzz gonna come and claim you
But you mo better wise
When the buzz gonna come and take you away
Take you away
Take you away
The microscopes that magnified the tears
Studied warts and all
Still the life flows on and on
Fab long time ago when we was fab
Fab but It's All Over Now Baby Blue
Fab long time ago when we was fab
Fab like this pullover you sent to me <start> I've seen the ocean
Break down and lay its hands on to you
And it won't hurt you
You're swimming sideways
Taking breath nothing left for you
And it won't hurt you
I'm seeing you sideways
Everything new
I wish I'd never seen your face
Wishing I was you
See what I'm turning into
Craving that you were art
So I could tear your frame apart
And it will not hurt you
I want you back again
Place my face within your skin
If it don't disturb you
I'm seeing you sideways
Everything new
I wish I'd never seen your face
Wishing I was you
See me turning
Believe it's coming
See what you're learning
See what you turned me into
I'm turning into you <start> I drink alone yeah
With nobody else
I drink alone yeah
With nobody else
Yeah you know when I drink alone
I prefer to be by myself
Now every morning just before breakfast
I don't want no coffee or tea
Just me and good buddy Wiser
That's all I ever need
'Cause I drink alone yeah
With nobody else
Yeah you know when I drink alone
I prefer to be by myself
Yeah the other night I laid sleeping
And I woke from a terrible dream
So I caught up my pal Jack Daniel's
And his partner Jimmy Beam
And we drank alone yeah
With nobody else
Yeah you know when I drink alone
I prefer to be by myself
Yeah the other day I got invited to a party
But I stayed home instead
Just me and my pal Johnny Walker
And his brothers Black and Red
And we drank alone yeah
With nobody else
Yeah you know when I drink alone
I prefer to be by myself <start> I climb the ladder of those black and white keys
They take me out and into places
Some are real some are imaginary
And though she sways between a mystery and light
She walks with me she walks with me alone into the night
Tonight I see the sunny moon is rising again
Three seasons passed since you were here then disappeared a friend
Yet now exploded from its dream back in that place oh how it beams
And I see that you were glowing in the shadows
And you've been here all along
Ah you never left my side and now I feel my arms grow stronger
You may forget the details and you can forget the dates but never
Forget the moment when the light revealed her face
To be poor by lack of money but by God be rich in prize
I found my youth's desire dark within her eyes
And the tent kept breathing something and then she cried
Hold on we're going somewhere else tonight
We're going somewhere else tonight baby yeah
And my friends they are the heroes of the loneliness that's life
And though everyone has a weakness only some they are defiant
While most of us can see only a few have the gift of sight
Would you walk with me
Would you walk with me alone into the night
The sun is set <start> Es larga la carretera
Que conduce a ningn lado
Pasaporte prestado
Pocas ganas de andar
Es duro subir las cuestas
Y bajar por las pendientes
Cruzar las turbias corrientes
Que nadie quiere cruzar
Pero hay que llegar hay que llegar
Hay que llegar al fin del mundo
Al paraso prometido 
Hay que llegar al horizonte
Donde se pierden los sentidos
Comer la fruta del rbol escondido
Y hay que llegar al horizonte
Donde se pierden los sentidos
Comer la fruta del rbol prohibido
Hay que llegar hay que llegar
Hay que llegar al fin del mundo
Al paraso prometido
Hay que llegar hay que llegar
Hay que llegar al fin del mundo
Al paraso prometido
Hay que llegar hay que llegar
Mas all de las montanas
Al paraso prometido
Hay que llegar hay que llegar
Deja que tu paso siga
Mas all de las montaas
Al paraso prometido
Hay que llegar hay que llegar
Hay que llegar al horizonte
Al paraso prometido <start> Cathy came home and no one cared
Even her friends were unaware
That s how it is when they lose track
I always say hey don t look back
Lassie got loose and made it home
No one had even telephoned
That s how it is out of the pack
I always say you don t look back
Sometimes I think of how things were
Right at the start
When she made a wildland in my heart
The seven returned and no one cheered
We don t think you re magnificent round here
Even if you look great in black
I should have told them don t look back
Sometimes I think of how things were
Right at the start
When she made a wildland in my heart
I was young I didn t care
I would have followed them anywhere
You know I was young I didn t care
I would have followed you anywhere
The ranger is finally on his own
Tonto got married and went home
That s how it is when your first name s Lone
Keep on the track hey don t look back
You know you don t look back
You don t look back I say you don t look back
Sometimes I think of how things were
Right at the start
When you made a wildland in my heart
You know you don t look back
Sometimes I think of how things were
Right at the start
When you made a wildland in my heart
You know you don t look back
You don t look back you don t look back
You know you don t look back
You don t look back you don t look back
You know you don t look back
You don t look back you don t look back <start> Down by the river
Where the lights hung from the trees
Midnight swallows sunlight
Muddy water runs between your knees
Everybody wants to be down at Soul Creek
Yeah yeah
Baby won't you come with me
Yeah yeah
Babe I wanna come with you
Such a sweaty situation
Why don't you talk a walk with me
Too hot
Need some coolin'
You know still water sure runs deep
Everybody wants to be down at Soul Creek
Yeah yeah
Baby won't you come with me
Yeah yeah
Babe I wanna come with you <start> Just picture a penthouse way up in the sky
With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by
A sweet slice of Heaven for just you and I
When we're alone.
From all of society we'll stay aloof
And live in propriety there on the roof.
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth
When we're alone.
We'll see life's mad pattern
As we view old Manhattan
Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.
In our little penthouse we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive
When we're alone.
We can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.
In our little penthouse we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive
When we're alone. <start> Imagine this we make things right
So beautiful we cling tonight
To all our dreams we pin them up
We lose our minds if we lose our hope
We swear to change but we bottle it
Stick to our guns and all our sins
We bury fear we drink to it
We might cheat death if we worship it
So we can stay alive
Our sex our power our drive
We lose ourselves inside
So we can feel alive
You're the one who should be on trial
For all your hate and your denial
Be careful what it is you break
Every broken thing can't be fixed
And all those fragile things we are
They find their voice they find their power
They take a grip around your throat
They keep squeezing till your life runs out
So we can stay alive
Our sex our power our drive
We lose ourselves inside
So we can feel alive

All alone we fight the fear 
By ourselves in every way 
All our lust all our greed
All our hate we're on our knees
Hear us beg hear us pray 
We can stay alive
We can stay alive
We can stay alive
We can stay alive
We can stay alive <start> Staring into the distance
Screaming out at the walls yeah
I'm so so invisible
Can't see my hands in front of me
Your sick and beautiful yeah
Falling into your silence
You know you waste your pretty face
Having a breakdown
So strange and violent little show
Having a breakdown
Having a breakdown
Are you having a breakdown
I don't wanna be part of the scenery
I got to break through all the machinery
It's so cold like a gun up to my head
It's no use I can't breathe and I'm feeling dead
Tell me your little nothings
You read between the lines then
I'm full and tainted even more
You don't think I'll find you anyway
Having a breakdown
Having a breakdown
Are you having a breakdown
Having a breakdown
I don't wanna be part of the scenery
I got to break through all the machinery
It's no use I can't breathe and I'm feeling dead
It's so cold like a gun up to my head
Staring into the distance
I'm so so invisible
Screaming out at the walls yeah
Can't see my hands in front of me
Are you having a breakdown
Having a breakdown
Having a breakdown
Having a breakdown
I got to break through all the machinery
I don't wanna be part of the scenery
It's no use I can't breathe and I'm feeling dead
It's so cold like a gun up to my head <start> Lay down softly in our sorrow
Lay down sister to die
And cover over my sweet Father
Cover over her eyes
Your broken body it cannot weather
The years your youth still longs to spend
So go down graceful sleep with the angels
And wake up whole again
'Cause it was not your time that's a useless line
A fallen world took your life
But the God that sometimes can't be found
Will wrap Himself around you
So lay down sister lay down
Slower passing are the hours
To tell this tale that takes its time
But the finest moment no man can measure
Is to look your Savior in the eyes
So take her tender to Your table
Take her from this killing floor
To taste the water that is forever
Let her be thirsty no more
It was not her time that's a useless line
A fallen world took her life
But the God that sometimes can't be found
Will wrap Himself around you
So lay down sister lay down
And the God that sometimes can't be found
Will wrap Himself around you
So lay down Rita lay down <start> It's all right once you're in the air
Just hope there's altitude and prayer
And if we survive the takeoff
The chances of accident are small
As long as there's some procedure
For fighting the stall
Fighting the stall
So now we're drawing straws to see
Just who will get the duty free
When you're on autopilot
And running on fumes and alcohol
The moment of truth deciding
Fighting the stall
Fighting the stall
And I'll go down in flames just for the hell of it all
Because I couldn't take
Standing in place
Waiting to fall
Fighting the stall
Fighting the stall
So we'll attempt the landing
And spiral into a fireball
Cause that was the understanding
Fighting the stall
Fighting the stall <start> We've only just begun to live
White lace and promises
A kiss for luck and we're on our way
Before the rising sun we fly
So many roads to choose
We start our walking and learn to run
And yes we've just begun
Sharing horizons that are new to us
Watching the signs along the way
Talking it over just the two of us
Working together day to day
Together
And when the evening comes we smile
So much of life ahead
We'll find a place where there's room to grow
And yes we've just begun
Sharing horizons that are new to us
Watching the signs along the way
Talking it over just the two of us
Working together day to day
Together together
And when the evening comes we smile
So much of life ahead
We'll find a place where there's room to grow
And yes we've just begun
And yes we've just begun <start> My stain glass soul all consumed
Drown in denial choke on the truth
My swollen tongue has left me dumb
Tune in on my confusion
Bitter words not meant to hurt
Game over start again
Waiting that was my mistake
Timing too little too late
Courage is pressure over grace
Freedom a smile on tortured face
My golden tongue from blackened lung
My tears are the color of your tongue
All's not well that ends not well
The credits strike the side
Waiting that was my mistake
Timing too little too late
I can't see you
Won't you save your breath
I can't hear you
Won't you save your breath
I can't hear you
Won't you save your breath
Drown in denial choke on the truth
Drown in denial choke on the truth
Drown in denial choke on the truth
Drown in denial choke on the truth <start> Hands on a window pane
Watching some children laugh and play
They're running in circles
With candy canes and french braids
Inspired to question
What makes us grownups anyway
Let's search for the moment
When youth betrayed itself to age
So let the children play
Inside your heart always
And death you will defy
'Cause your youth will never die
Never die
In searching for substance
We're clouded by struggle's haze
Remember the meaning
Of playing out in the rain
We swim in the fountain
Of youth's timeless maze
If you drink the water
Your youth will never fade
So let the children play
Inside your heart always
And death you will defy
'Cause your youth will never die
Never die
Never die
Never die
I won't let go of that youthful soul
Despite body and mind my youth will never die
I won't let go of that youthful soul
Despite body and mind my youth will never die <start> She was once an attraction at the county fair
And now she sleeps in a box at the top of the stairs
And she loves it here make no mistake
Cause she can earn her keep by chasin' snakes
And if I wake up late at night
I know that everything will be alright
Cause crawling round on my roof
Is the woman who is also a mongoose
She was born in May nineteen years ago
In a little town outside Buffalo
But the town folk feared her and they chased her away
And now she's happy with a place to stay
And if I wake up late at night
I know that everything will be alright
Cause crawling round on my roof
Is the woman who is also a mongoose
She trapped a rattler out behind the barn
And she let it go without any harm
Then she came inside for a cup of tea
And she spoke for a while with my brother and me
Chasing after field mice running through the high grass
That's what she loves to do
And if she's happy as a mongoose
It shouldn't bother me or you
And if I wake up late at night
I know that everything will be alright
Cause crawling round on my roof
Is the woman who is also a mongoose <start> Some plans were made and rice was thrown
A house was built a baby born
How time can move both fast and slow
Amazes me
And so I raise my glass to symmetry
To the second hand and its accuracy
To the actual size of everything
The desert is the sand
You can't hold it in your hand
It won't bow to your demands
There's no difference you can make
There's no difference you can make
And if it seems like an accident
A collage of senselessness
You aren't looking hard enough
I wasn't looking hard enough at it
An argument for consciousness
The instinct of the blind insect
Who makes love to the flower bed
And dies in the first freeze
Oh I want to learn such simple things
No politics no history
Till what I want and what I need
Can finally be the same
I just got myself to blame
Is everything up to fate
When there's choices I could make
When there's choices I could make
Now my heart needs a polygraph
Always so eager to pack my bags
When I really wanna stay
When I really wanna stay
When I wanna stay
When I wanna stay
When I wanna stay
When I wanna stay
The arc of time the stench of sex
The innocence you can't protect
Each quarter note each marble step
Walk up and down that lonely treble clef
Each wanting the next one
Each wanting the next one to arrive
Each wanting the next one
Each wanting the next one to arrive
An argument for consciousness
The instinct of the blind insect
Who never thinks not to accept its fate
That's fate that's happiness and death
You get to the next one
You get to the next on down the line
You get to the next one
You get to the next on down the line
The remedy of longing that
Distills each dream and the song I had
By morning watered down again
On silver stars I wish and wish and wish
From one to the next one
From one to the next one down the line
From one to the next one
From one to the next one down the line
You get to the next one
You get to the next on down the line
You get to the next one
You get to the next on down the line <start> He had a room in the best part of town
He got a chocolate on his eiderdown
Staring out over roofs at the cross
Suppose he must have felt somewhat at loss
This is it oh this is it
This is it oh baby this is it
You couldn't say he was feeling very vibed
What had the quack in London prescribed
You couldn't really say he seemed to care
Sometimes he acted like he wasn't anywhere
This is it oh baby this is it
This it it oh this is it
Watching films before it start to crash
Even though you've got a fistful of cash
Watching the future it bursts on through
I was one of those who used to envy you
I knew a wise man didn't know a thing
I knew a happy man who made me feel sad
You never know what the other guy is thinking too bad
Sometimes you come upon a fork in the road
What was waiting there he never could have known
Splitsecond difference one tiny percent
Yeah he came and he went
This is it oh baby this is it
This is it oh this is it <start> I cannot leave here I cannot stay
Forever haunted more than afraid
Asphyxiate on words I would say
I'm drawn to a blackened sky as I turn blue
There are no flowers no not this time
There'll be no angels gracing the lines
Just these stark words I find
I'd show a smile but I'm too weak
I'd share with you could I only speak
Just how much this hurts me
I cannot stay here I cannot leave
Just like all I loved I make believe
Imagined heart I disappear
Seems...no one will appear here and make me real
There are no flowers no not this time
There'll be no angels gracing the lines
Just these stark words I find
I'd show a smile but I'm too weak
I'd share with you could I only speak
Just how much this hurts me
I'd tell you how it haunts me
I'd tell you how it haunts me

I'd tell you how it haunts me

You don't care that it haunts me...Oh
There are no flowers no not this time
There'll be no angels gracing the lines
Just these stark words I find
I'd show a smile but I'm too weak
I'd share with you could I only speak
Just how much this hurts me
Just how much this hurts me
Just how much you... <start> Shout shout
I'm shoutin' about the world outside
I'm shoutin' because you just can't hide
I'm shoutin' from the plain honest truth
I'm shoutin' there's so much we could do
Shout i'm shoutin' shoutin' shoutin'
I'm shoutin' because it's hard to believe
I'm shoutin' it's so easy to see
I'm shoutin' we're waitin' for a reply
I'm shoutin' for the very last time
Shout well baby this one's for you
Shout for everything that you do
Shout until the battle is won
Shout we'll live to fight on and on
And when you add it all together
And when you roll it in a ball
And when you watch another pyramid <start> There's trouble on the riseyou can see it in the eyes of the livin'
There's an order to defythere's a room at the back of your mind
Word gets outwhat's it all about
Some take it in and some can do without
Don't hang out in the shadow of a doubt
It's time you split before they sign you out
They'll have you sing the blues...
Take a look behind ya
Take it on the run
Take a look behind ya
Look into the risin' sun
You can dance you can sing but it doesn't mean a thing without rhythm
You can slipslidestumble through the rest of your life
Time won't stopnever gonna stop ya
You push the limit 'til the day you drop
Time don't stoprace against the clock
You shun the riskcan you stand the shock
You got a lot to lose...
Take a look behind ya
Take it on the run
Take a look behind ya
Look into the risin' sun
Take a look behind ya
Take it as it comes
Take a look behind ya
Don't forget the things you done
You can runyou can hide but you never put aside what you're feelin'
Keep your balancekeep your stridelet it run through the heart of your life
Time don't stopready or not
You've got to give it everything you got
Life don't stoptake it to the top...
You miss a step feel the anchor drop
It all comes back to you... <start> It's all too much
When I look into your eyes
Your love is there for me
And the more I go inside
The more there is to see.
It's all too much for me to take
The love that shines all around me
Everywhere it's what you make
For me to take it's all too much.
Floating down the stream of time
From life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are
Or where you'd like to be.
It's all too much for me to take
The love that shines all around here.
All the world is birthday cake
So take a piece but not too much.
Sail me on a silver sun
Where I know that I am free
Show me that I'm everywhere
And get me home for tea.
It's all too much for me to take
There's plenty there for everybody
The more you give the more you get
The more it is and it's too much.
It's all too much for me to see
The love that shines all around you
The more I learn the less I know
But what I do is all too much.
It's all too much for me to take
The love that shines all around you
Everywhere it's what you make
For me to take it's all too much. <start> Get me out of this place before I cause more damage
A small price to pay for building houses out of matchsticks
And when things get too hot you've got me to blame for
Every fire that breaks out in every lover's name so
Don't forget we've got unfinished business
Stories yet to unfold
Tales that must be retold
And I regret not knowing when to put an end to all this madness
Keeps me wanting
Keeps me wanting more
Sell me out I'm yesterday's old news
Phrases left on paper
Black ink bleeding through
The pages where we made our history.
Call me foolish
I feel hopeless
Like a dear caught in the headlights
I won't know what hit me
Running from lions
Never felt like such a mistake <start> Poor old granddad
I laughed at all his words
I thought he was a bitter man
He spoke of woman's ways
They'll trap you then they use you
Before you even know
For love is blind and you're far too kind
Don't ever let it show
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger
The can can's such a pretty show
They'll steal your heart away
But backstage back on earth again
The dressing rooms are gray
They come on strong and it ain't too long
Before they make you feel a man
But love is blind and you soon will find
You're just a boy again
When you want her lips you get a cheek
Makes you wonder where you are
If you want some more and she's fast asleep
Then she's twinkling with the stars
Poor young grandson there's nothing I can say
You'll have to learn just like me
And that's the hardest way
Ooh la la ooh la la la yeh
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger <start> The crowd without a face
Begins to fill the space
In the arena
Flashlights at his feet
The lion from the street
Awaits the Christians
A blinding flash of light
A single strobe ignites the night
The smoke begins to rise
A sea of staring eyes
Gaze on the sunburst
His weapon at his side
He flashes it with pride
Before his legions
Fires begin to rage
And they engulf the stage
All right
Bring on the night
He's in complete control
He's stepping proud and bold
And everything he touches
Turns to gold
He's got girls by the score
He's got 'em screaming for more
But when they get too close
He bars the door
He bars the door
He makes his great escape
Leaves them in his wake
Without a warning
The ritual is done
A night no longer young
Fades into morning
The sun begins to rise
As he begins to close his eyes <start> It's a reflection that you see in me
But I know it's not reality
Beneath the glitter and behind all the lace do you see my face
I'll be the mirror the spaces in between
It's not the truth it's just a dream
I guess we all have to believe in something in anything.
Do you love me 
Just the way I am
Do you need me 
Will you take a chance 
Do you see me for all that I can be 
Do you believe 
Live in me
Sometimes you need to be lost just to be found
You need to go to come back around
You need to set somebody free for them to return.
You live and learn
Do you love me 
Just the way I am
Do you need me 
Will you take a chance
Do you see me for all that I can be 
Do you believe 
Live in me
I've heard it said that true love is blind
Or this is just a state of mind
If you're not looking you will never find
You'll be left behind
Do you love me 
Just the way I am
Do you need me 
Will you take my hand
Maybe you'll see through the mystery
Do you believe 
Do you love me 
Just the way I am
Do you need me 
Will you take a chance 
Maybe you'll see all that I can be 
Do you believe 
Live in me <start> Musica por Paulo Carvalho
Toca o telefone latem os cachorros choram as crianas
E eu no consigo dormir
Ser que no percebem voltei da bebedeira minha cabea di
Acho que vai explodir
Eu bebi tudo aquilo que encontrei
No bebi mais porque no achei
At a pouco 'tava tudo bem
Agora me sinto debaixo de um trem
Toca a campanhina gritam os vizinhos no sei o que fao
Sei que de hoje no passo
No vou pro trabalho no vou pra escola dme uma esmola
Me deixe dormir em paz
Eu bebi tudo aquilo que encontrei
No bebi mais porque no achei
At a pouco 'tava tudo bem
Agora me sinto debaixo de um trem
Maldita ressaca
Dedo na garganta
Sou trapo humano
Jogado no cho de um banheiro
Passarinhos cantam
Por quem os sinos dobram
Garanto que no por mim
Eu nunca mais vou levantar
Eu nunca mais quero trabalhar
Prometo at que no bebo nunca mais
Mas nunca sempre tempo demais
Maldita ressaca
Tambores da frica
Na minha cabea
Bateria da Mocidade
Na minha cabea
Motores dos carros bombeiros cidade
Morteiros puteiros boates...
Maldita ressaca
Sent by Carlos Andr Branco <start> Can you explain to me how
You're so able 
It's too late for me now
There's a hole in the earth 
I'm out
There's a hole in the earth 
Can you explain to me now
If you're still able 
I think you know the truth
There's a hole in the earth
I'm out
I hate all of my friends
They all accept our time
There's a hole in the earth 
There is a hole in the earth
Let's think about
This is the end

This is the end

There's a hole in the earth 
There's a hole in the earth 
I hate all of my friends
I'm out
There's a hole in the earth
 <start> Turning into my mind
The mirror's eye smiles back at me
Fed me with your madness
Burnt the cradle to the ground
Created a beast of sadness
Now I'm searching to be found
Reaping the seed you sowed
Left alone to grow yeah
Where do we go
I don't know
Reaping the seed you sowed
Time has come no longer care
I wanted love you gave me fear
Fed me with your madness
Burnt the cradle to the ground
Created a beast of sadness
Now I'm searching to be found
Reaping the seed you sowed
See my life broke in half
Frozen sea you left for me
Reaping the seed you sowed
Time has come no longer care
I wanted love you gave me fear
Fed me with your madness
Burnt the cradle to the ground
Created a beast of sadness
Now I'm searching to be found
Reaping the seed you sowed
See my life broke in half

Sweet child more than I could bare
For the years gone by traveled through the year
Sweet child more than I could bare
We shared some hard times
Oh yes we have
We've been through the sad times
But they're the best I ever had
Yes it was
Well I seen blue skies headin' on my way
Take my hand walk that extra mile
Story's almost over
Pages are still turning
Aahhh the fire lasts forever
Let it be my baby girl
It's time to set me free
Travelin' on this road for much too long
Long line long line long line
Until the search that I fly
Long lines tellin' in these hands
Shared some hard times
Oh yes we have
Been through sad times
But they're the best I ever had
Well I seen blue skies headin' on my way
Take my hand walk that extra mile
Story's almost over
Pages are still turning
Aaahh the fire lasts forever
Well I seen blue skies headin' on my way
Take my hand walk that extra mile
Story's almost over
Pages are still turning
Aaahh the fire lasts forever
Well I seen blue skies headin' on my way
Take my hand walk that extra mile
Story's almost over
Pages are still turning
Aaahh the fire lasts forever <start> All this time I've been unclean
Watching you 'cause you're watching me
Shotgun knives into my heart without a reason
All I want is to never die
Fuck the beats of a different heart
What I'll do if you never tell
Bleed me an answer
We got chills
I break it down and build again sit still
Line me up so I can burn
My heart knows you won't return
Make some sense of being alone
'Cause I'm wasted
Blackout rescue from my faults
Take away my sober stare
Pay phone prayer give me what I want
Give me an answer
Trying to stare through you
I can't get past your eyes
Locked to the inside
We got chills
I break it down and build again sit still
Let me inject
Trying to stare through you
I can't get past your eyes
Sweating through the nights
Again again again watch out they fall
We got chills
I break it down and build again I sit still
I've got pills I got chills
I got chills I got chills <start> I took my bucket down to the well
There's a unverified woman sweet mystery
She let the rope fall down in the well
Like it was meant to be
She put the jug upon her head
Walked with her back to the wind
I followed her tracks the moment she said
Why don't you come in
She killed the light
She dropped her glove
She said Are you looking for trouble
Or looking for love love love
I woke in the morning dying of thirst
Headed straight back to the well
There she was with a jug on her head
The rope had just fell
The well in her eyes was deep and black
With no question or answer
She wiped my brow and I followed her back
To the Tropic of Cancer
She killed the light
She dropped her glove
She said Are you looking for trouble
Or looking for love love love <start> Melancholy mood
Forever haunts me
Steals upon me in the night
Forever taunts me
Oh what a lonely soul am I
Stranded high and dry
By a melancholy mood
Gone is every joy
And inspiration
Tears are all I have to show
No consolation
All I see is grief and gloom
Till the crack of doom
Oh melancholy mood
Deep in the night
I search for a trace
Of a lingering kiss
A warm embrace
But love is a whimsy and flimsy as lace
And my arms embrace an empty space
Melancholy mood
Why must you blind me
Pity me and break the chains
The chains that bind me
Won't you release me set me free
Bring her back to me
Oh melancholy mood <start> This may seem out of place
Your subtle glance brings a smile to my face
And I thought it was so bizarre
The way the sun hit your eyes
Thinking of you is like waking up to the sunrise
The sun is rising with the tide
Sitting by the water's edge
Underneath this pale light
I wish I could pause this moment forever
You said we needed time
I'm already there
And now you left me waiting
The sand on my feet
Just the sound of your voice
It brings me comfort inside
Sitting by the old side with your hands in mine
Underneath this February sky
You said we needed time
I'm already there
And now you left me waiting
The sand on my feet
Viewing the ocean from the sun's point of view
I miss the reflection and the contrast
You said we needed time
I'm already there
And now you left me waiting
The sand on my feet <start> Fifteen years Le Bing Son
Fought side by side with the Americans
In the mountains and deltas of Vietnam
In ' Saigon fell
And he left his command
And brought his family to the promised land
Seabrook Texas and the small towns
In the Gulf of Mexico
It was delta country and reminded him of home
He worked as a machinist put his money away
And bought a shrimp boat with his cousin
And together they harvested Galveston Bay
In the mornin' 'fore the sun come up
He'd kiss his sleepin' daughter
Steer out through the channel
And casts his nets into the water
Billy Sutter fought with Charlie Company
In the highlands of Quang Tri
He was wounded in the battle of Chu Lai
And shipped home in '
There he married and worked the gulf fishing grounds
In a boat that'd been his father's
In the morning he'd kiss his sleeping son
And cast his nets into the water
Billy sat in front of his TV as the south fell
And the Communists rolled into Saigon
He and his friends watched as the refugees came
Settle on the same streets and worked the coast they grew up on
Soon in the bars around the harbor was talk
Of America for Americans
Someone said You want 'em out you got to burn 'em out
And brought in the Texas klan
One humid Texas night there were three shadows on the harbor
Come to burn the Vietnamese boats into the sea
In the fire's light shots rang out
Two Texans lay dead on the ground
Le stood with a pistol in his hand
A jury acquitted him in self defense
As before the judge he did stand
But as he walked down the courthouse steps
Billy said My friend you're a dead man
One late summer night Le stood watch along the waterside
Billy stood in the shadows
His Kbar knife in his hand
And the moon slipped behind the clouds
Le lit a cigarette the bay was as still as glass
As he walked by Billy stuck his knife into his pocket
Took a breath and let him pass
In the early darkness Billy rose up
Went into the kitchen for a drink of water
Kissed his sleeping wife
Headed into the channel
And casts his nets into the water
Of Galveston Bay <start> Oh Lord wish my bed wasn't silken sheets so tight
I got to keep my strength up got to do a show tonight
I'll have a cup of coffee while I'm taking in the news
No need to have a shave 'cause I'm gonna sing the blues
Well I think I'll get a massage maybe lose a little fat
So I'll have to go downtown in my brand new Cadillac
My valet comes and dresses me I light a big cigar
Because I like to look like Nimrod when I'm riding in my car
Can blue men sing the whites
Or are they hypocrites for singing woo woo wooh
And now it's getting near the time I gotta make the scene
I change out my dark gray mohair suit put on my dirty jeans
The band comes round to pick me up I holler Hello boys
I gotta mess my hair up I'm gonna make some noise brrr
Can blue men sing the whites
Or are they hypocrites for singing woo woo wooh
Oh Lord somebody help me <start> Hey I said you're godless and
It seems like you're a soulless friend
As spotless as you were back then
I swear that you are godless
Hey I guess you're lonely when
I gave you all it took so then
A stranger there is ever been
I guess it's what you wanted
It seems lonely I would be
I begged I plead but this is all
That I have gotten
Hey as for the day my friend
To hope that you could ever bend
I swear you are I swear you are
I swear that you are godless
Hey I said you're godless
Hey and you're a soulless friend
Hey I said you're heartless
And I swear I swear
Godless godless you're godless <start> Every kiss every hug
Seems to act just like a drug
You're getting to be a habit with me
Let me stay in your arms
I'm addicted to your charms
You're getting to be a habit with me
I used to think your love was something that I could take or leave alone
But now I couldn't do without my supply
I need you for my own
Oh I can't break away
I must have you every day
As regularly as coffee or tea
You've got me in your clutches
And I can't get free
You're getting to be a habit with me
Can't break it
You're getting to be a habit with me
You've got me in your clutches
And I can't get free
Like getting shuteye
You are what I need
Eternally ohhh my

We gonna roll the dice
We gonna slip and slide into paradise
We gonna grind some gears
We gonna ring some ears
We gonna drink some beers

Drink the good times down
Little buzz in a cup

Miles of moonlight by my side
Old dirt roads go straight to heaven

Little buzz in a cup

Sip a little whiskey come on baby kiss me

Tonight we gonna fly with them 's
Get high high
Gonna kill another  pack just to watch it die
Turn the party up up up
Turn the party up up up <start> Excuse me Mr. Apathy.
The guillotine has dropped another victim of you is what I see.
The whole town eggs obnoxiously
forcing you out on a killing spree.
It's not enough to spill the blood of those on the soil.
In microwaves go torsos covered solely in foil.
Excuse me Mr. Simple Mind you're the kind that kills.
Another victim of you is what I see.
The whole crowd eggs obnoxiously.
Rebels gagged and bound lack their pride.
And receive no respect at all. <start> Water for the thirsty wholeness for the meek
Shelter and foundation for the weak
Friendship for the lonely riches for the poor
Fulfillment for the ones that yearn for more
You are what I long for
You are what I need
When it's You and I then my heart can sing
When it's You and I then my soul is free
You are all my life You are all my strength
You are all my hope You are everything
So take me to the inside the inside of Your heart
Take me to the depths of who You are
Shake me with Your wonder stir me with Your grace
Lighting every dark and empty space
You are what I long for
You are what I need
When it's You and I then my heart can sing
When it's You and I then my soul is free
You are all my life You are all my strength
You are all my hope You are everything
You are here You surround me
Glory falls from the fountain of Your beauty
You are now and You surround me
Glory falls from Your tender hand of mercy
You are God You surround me
Glory falls from Your love
When it's You and I then my heart can sing
When it's You and I then my soul is free
You are all my life You are all my strength
You are all my hope You are everything <start> and i hear the stars have fallen he finally rests his eyes on the contract he finally laid his eyes on her red dress he finally lost his eyes in the contrast the steel rides up again he finally his line on the man he finally claims his ties on the land he finally rests his eyes on the contract he finally lost his eyes in her red dress he finally lost his eyes in the contract he slowly runs his eyes through her red dress the steel rides up again he finally lays his line on the man he finally lays his ties on the land he finally lost his eyes on the contract to feel the same and i hear the counselors on his way to make this cancer change and i hear the counselor on his way and i feel tip top and full of shame i feel the counselors on his way and i feel the stars will change and i feel the counselors on his way to fill the contract fill it with these days feel the contrast fill it with these days with a breath it tenses with a breath you tense on me feel that contract a portrait in the light of same if this is alive keep me honestly recognize I'm a man recognize what i could have been <start> I went down to Old Joe's Bar
On the corner by the square
All the men were having drinks same as usual
And the same old crowd was there
Oh no...
On my left stood my good friend Joseph McGinley
Oh his eyes were bloodshot and red
And he turned to the people standing by him
And these are the words he said...
I went down to that St James Infirmary
They had my baby there
She was lying on a long long white table yeah
So cold so still... She was dead
Oh no...
Let her go let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She can search search this whole wide world over
But she'll never find another man as good as me
No she'll never never find another man
Who'll treat her like I did <start> Stole a key
Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me
To set me free
I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
I saw the lights go down and standing in front of me
In my scarecrow dreams
When they smashed my heart into smithereens
Be a bright red rose come bursting the concrete
Be the cartoon heart
Light a fire light a spark
Light a fire a flame in my heart
We'll run wild oh
We'll be glowing in the dark
We'll be glowing in the dark
All the boys all the girls
All that matters in the world
All the boys all the girls
All that matters that occurs
All the highs all the lows
As the room is spinning oh
We'll run wild
We'll be glowing in the dark
Living innocent wild
We'll be glowing in the dark <start> Maybe there's no use
In things being like they used to
And maybe there's no use
In the way it was before
And if I found time
We'd go away with your way
And if we found time
I'd want it more and more
And maybe there's no harm there's no harm there's no harm in
Maybe there's no harm there's no harm in you
And maybe there's no harm there's no harm there's no harm in
So watch what you say
There's a beast that's in me.
I'm the true recluse
Blissful as a loner
And all that we have left
Is never like before
Delivered on a word
Never near the target
Seen for what it was
And never eye to eye
And maybe there's no harm there's no harm there's no harm in
Maybe there's no harm there's no harm in you
And maybe there's no harm there's no harm there's no harm in
So watch what you say
There's a beast that's in me.
You stand by watching the world let me down
And maybe there's no harm there's no harm there's no harm in
Maybe there's no harm there's no harm in you
And maybe there's no harm there's no harm there's no harm in
So watch what you say
There's a beast that's in me. <start> do you know

By the side of a northern sea
The army had my father
And my mother was having me
Military Madness was killing my country
Solitary Sadness comes over me
After the school was over and I moved
To the other side
I found a different country but I never
Lost my pride
Military Madness was killing the country
Solitary sadness creeps over me
And after the wars are over
And the body count is finally filed
I hope that The Man discovers
What's driving the people wild <start> If I were your woman and you were my man
you'd have no other woman you'd be weak as a lamb.
If you had the strength to walk out that door
My love would over rule my sense and I'd call you back for more
If I were your woman.
If I were your woman and you were my man. Um baby.
She tears you down darlin' says you're nothing at all.
But I'll pick you up darling when she lets you fall.
You're like a diamond but she treats you like glass.
Yet you beg her to love you but me you don't ask.
If I were your woman If I were your woman.
If I were your woman here's what I'd do
I'd never no no stop loving you.
Yeah yeah um
Life is so crazy a love is unkind.
Because she came first darling will she hang on your mind
You're a part of me and you don't even know it.
I'm what you need but I'm too afraid to show it.
If I were your woman If I were your woman
If I were your woman here's what I'd do.
Never no no no stop loving you ah yeah.
If I were your woman here's what I'd do.
Never never stop loving you if <start> When you have these blues
And there's someone you're about to lose
There'll be a time yeah you can't sleep at night
She won't believe in you oh if you don't treat her right
I say everyday when the sun is almost down
You remember when your baby left the sound
Some people were born to lose
That's why lovers have the blues
I say everyday about five you'll hang your head and cry
That it's the time when your baby said goodbye
And you wanted to put your traveling shoes on
Yeah you feel like crying when you get these kind blues
Yeah all these blues I said all these blues now <start> I believe in your purpose baby
Coming up to the surface and maybe
I'll never see you again then again who knows
Make me quiver hands'll shiver
Still got all the things that I woulda give her
Yeah yeah but it's slow going
Something's showing yeah yeah
They say love is a stream that will find its own course
Making due is a thing a thing I will do no more
Whenever you come back I'll be waiting
Trifling the slack no head gating
This is all pure fiction you know that's right
Just pure fiction that's all right
I believe in your purpose baby
Coming up to the surface and maybe
I'll never see you again then again who knows
Make me quiver hands'll shiver
Still got all the things that I woulda give her

hearing all the things we say
looks like another day of wasting life.
I ned a simple place where I can go and
my face won't be shown for a long time.
All I want is an ice cream cone a convertible car
and a country home in the hills and you know why.
Things the way they are make me sit right here and cry.
I'm lost
seeing all the things we see can't be right for me
they say I'm blind.
They're making fun of my shoes shorts shirt
just blows my mind.
If you follow I'll cherish us
and we'll never be alone.
But if you turn me down
I'm gonna leave your ass at home
so now I got my way I crowned myself king for a day
and I finally got to implement my changes.
I wake up in the trees with my queen next
to me cause a king needs to know his place. <start> The downside of being up is my inside is empty of
The one thing my heart truly needs
When I feel invincible a million miles from miserable
It's always all about me
I don't know why I don't love You like I should like You would
Through bad and good oh
Funny how we figure out where happiness is found
In the midst of this sadness I'm closer to You now
And that's the upside of down the upside of down
It's all switched around I lost and I found
The upside of down
You are more in my less You are strength in my weakness
I'll never go back again
And then Your sunshine ends the rain and I return to my old ways
Why am I a fair weather friend
I wanna be the one to love You like I should like You would
Through the bad and good oh
Funny how we figure out where happiness is found
In the midst of this sadness I'm closer to You now
That's the upside of tragedies knowing You're holding my heart always always
I may be down but I'm finding there's joy in the pain in the pain
Funny how we figure out where happiness is found
In the midst of this sadness I'm closer I'm closer to You now and oh
Funny how we figure out where happiness is found
In the midst of this sadness I'm closer to You now
And that's the upside of down the upside of down
It's all switched around I lost and I found
The upside of down
The upside of down
It's all switched around I lost and I found
The upside of down <start> Do you wake up without speaking
Outside in a shallow state of mind
You come down  you're slipping on your feelings
This breakdown may one day lead to healing
All the while the eyes of God shine on us
The broken smile and the eyes of God shine on us
Do you wake up without breathing
Rub on your faded smile 
You wanted to be perfect
You'll have to wait a while
Dress yourself all up in Heaven
Let the angels dance inside these feelings
All the while the eyes of God shine on us
The broken smile and the eyes of God shine on us
Feel the pain you need to show
Take the time now let it go
Embrace this day of healing
His tears of love redeem us
The eyes of mercy shine on us
All the while the eyes of God shine on us
The broken smile and the eyes of God shine on us
Even now His tears of love redeem us
The broken smile and the eyes of God shine on us
Shine on us 
Shine on us 
Shine on us <start> Some of my old friends say I'm self possessed
I hope you don't mind if I get something off my chest
Between you and me I only go out at night
Sunlight in my eyes just makes me uptight
In the backroom we be drinking all night
We be living in a vacuum
We be looking for a fight
In the backroom we be drinking all night
We be running out of headroom
We be looking for a fight
Crowd was thinning out
And he came through the door
I look right at him
He looks at the floor
Awkward glances catch the thread long ago
I'm seeing red
Does your sister dress you up
Does the devil know you're dead
I don't know if Gabriel keeps a place for me
I still want to go to heaven  see what I can see
I don't want to have St Peter close the gate on me
I still want to get to heaven  be what I can be
We had moved to the place
I heard them say 'Last Call'
I stepped over all of them
And walked on down the hall
The man says not to wait for judgment
It comes everyday
Absolution at a price
And we all have to pay
In the backroom we be drinking all night
We be living in a vacuum
We be looking for a fight
In the backroom we be drinking all night
We be running out of headroom
We be looking for a fight
I don't know if Gabriel keeps a place for me
I still want to go to heaven  see what I can see
I don't want to have St Peter close the gate on me
I still want to get to heaven  be what I can be
Shoo sha doo
Shoo sha doo
Shoo sha doo

In the backroom we be drinking all night
We be living in a vacuum

Hey man oh Henry get off the phone I gotta
Hey man I gotta straighten my face
This mellow thighed chick just put my spine out of place
Hey man my school days insane

Ain't good well she's total blam blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she and then she
Don't lean on me man

Back in Suffragette City

Back in Suffragette City
Doo wah Suffragette City
Woo ha Suffragette City
Way down in Suffragette City
Suffragette City Suffragette <start> With a pocket full of reasons
And empty hands that used to hold
The comfort of a life ance filled with hope
But now the hope is fadin'
And you're losin' faith in purity
Torn between what's right and what you need
Nobody ever told you how dark the sky could turn from blue
Nobody sold you on more than one mistake
Nobody ever told you how deep the water gets
When you jump in
Reachin' out for something
Taht amounts to nothing once again
A solid life degraded even more
The you that you now love is a lie
Nobody even warned you no one could even reach you there
Nobody ever thought you could ever lose control
And nothing ever drove you so out of my mind
Rise on water
Rise on water
Rise above and breathe <start> Human bark
Beautyless hide from beauty
Bow your eyes 'n heads to the duty of the dead's
Suck the ground
Breathe life into the dead dinosaurs
Let the past demons rear up 'n belch fire in the air of now
The rug's wearing out that we walk on
Soon it will fray 'n we'll drop
Dead into yesterday
Must the breathing pay for those who breathe in 'n don't
Breathe out
There'd be no gain brothers if no one would play
'N for your games count me n' all that can see
Breathe in 'n out hungry today 'n eat hearty tomorrow
Or eat away 'n be eaten some day
No seed shall sow in salt water
If the dinosaur cries with blood in his eyes
In the dinosaur cries with blood in his eyes
'N eats our babies for our lies
Belches fire in our skies
Maybe I'll die but he'll be rumbling through
Your petrified forest <start> She said we could just sleep together
There'd be nothing wrong.
We could just hold each other with our clothes on.
I went to answer I don't think we should.
Then I heard a voice say yeah I guess we could.
She kissed me lightly and said you know sometimes when you're down
It's the little things that count
It's the little things that count
It's the little things...
She said it was too late I really shouldn't try to drive.
She unbuttoned my shirt and whispered just close your eyes.
Here let me take your boots off you know sometimes when your luck's run out
It's the little things that count
It's the little things that count
It's the little things...
Bridge her dress rode lightly as she walked
Then she pulled the covers down.

Well I was so dry she held a water glass to my lips
And the polish on her nail was chipped.
She said she had a boyfriend that I reminded her of.
His hair was the same muddy brown she stuck her tongue in my mouth... <start> The scenery decays
Through vacant eyes
Fading all I see
To black and white
No colors to describe
No voice to reply
My emotions slowly die
No lows or highs I'm flatlined
The writing on the walls
May be foreign to us all
'Cause the casualties of war
Haven't changed us much at all
Reality replays through strain and strife
Causing crashing waves to change the tides
Wash away the lines
Erase the space in time
New emotions show a sign
Hold to life down a flatline
The writing on the walls
May be foreign to us all
'Cause the casualties of war
Haven't changed us much at all
I won't let you bury me
You're not ready to bear the weight
I won't let you bury me
You're not ready to bear the weight
I won't let you bury me
You're not ready to bear the weight
I won't let you bury me
You're not ready to bear the weight
I won't let you bury me
You're not ready to bear the weight
The writing on the walls
May be foreign to us all
'Cause the casualties of war
Haven't changed us much at all <start> Schauen sie mich ruhig an
ich bin die No. von Flingern.
Blaue Augen wilder Gang
so war ich schon immer.
Es ist 'ne ganz spezielle Aura die mich umgibt.
Es ist mehr als nur Sex Appeal
aus meinem Blick spricht Lebenserfahrung
und eine tiefe Melancholie.
So was kriegt man schon mit der Muttermilch
wenn man in diesem Stadtteil lebt.
Ja so was hat man oder man hat es nicht
Und ich hab' davon sehr viel.
Wo ich bin scheint die Sonne
Und alle warten schon auf mich.
Die No. aus Dsseldorf Flingern
das bin ich.
Ich habe keine besondere Masche.
Ich geb mich einfach wie ich bin
und wenn sich jemand an mir verbrennt
ist das nicht mein Problem.
Ja die Herzen der Frauen sie fliegen immer zu mir
doch was kann ich schon dafr
Und die Herzen ihrer Mnner fliegen meistens auch noch hinterher.
Wo ich bin scheint die Sonne
Und alle warten schon auf mich.
Die No. aus Dsseldorf Flingern
das bin ich.
Und die Frauen auf meiner Strae
ja irgendwann da kriegen sie mich.
Doch mein Herz mein Herz das kriegen sie nicht. <start> Standin' on the corner
Of Toulouse and Dauphine
Waitin' on MarieOndine
I'm tryin' to place a tune
Under a Louisiana moonbeam
On the planet of New Orleans
In a bar they call The Saturn
And in her eyes of green
And somethin' that she said in a dream
Inside of my suit I got my mojo root
And a true love figurine
For the planet of New Orleans
New Orleans  the other planet
With other life upon it
And everythin' that's shakin' in between
If you should ever land upon it
You better know what's on it
The planet of New Orleans
Now I'm tryin' to find my way
Through the rain and the steam
I'm lookin' straight ahead through the screen
And then I heard her say
Somethin' in the Limousine
'Bout takin' a ride across the planet of New Orleans <start> Once in your life you find her
Someone that turns your heart around
And next thing you know you're closing down the town
Wake up and it's still with you
Even though you left her way across town
Wondering to yourself Hey what've I found
Chorus
When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
The best that you can do
The best that you can do is fall in love
Arthur he does as he pleases
All of his life he's mastered choice
Deep in his heart he's just he's just a boy
Living his life one day at a time
And showing himself a really good time
Laughing about the way they want him to be
Chorus x <start> No one ever told me
It would come to this
What began with such a promise
Would end with such a twist
I lean into the whisper
But I don't hear a thing
It's a tear in the dark
All alone in the car
In pieces in pieces
It's the sound of mistake
As I lie here awake
Sleepless sleepless
This is the sound that made
When a heart breaks
Everybody's laughing
Maybe that's just me
Does something unrequited
Mean it will never be
I lean into the whisper
But I don't hear a thing
It's a tear in the dark
All alone in the car
In pieces in pieces
It's the sound of mistake
As I lie here awake
Sleepless sleepless
This is the sound that made
When a heart breaks
Please don't leave me here
Life for now I've come to fear
You've dropped me off and left me here
With nothing here to find my way
But the lights you take as you pull away
Far ahead the brush is moving
There's others here and good is proving
Nothing's wrong it's in my mind
Nothing's wrong and I'll be find
It's a tear in the dark
All alone in the car
In pieces in pieces
It's the sound of mistake
As I lie here awake
Sleepless sleepless <start> It's three miles to the river
That would carry me away
Two miles to the dusty street
That I saw you on today
It's four miles to my lonely room
Where I will hide my face
And about half a mile to the downtown bar
That I ran from in disgrace
Lord how long have I got to keep on running
Seven hours seven days or seven years
All I know is since you've been gone
I feel like I'm drowning in a river
Drowning in a river of tears
Drowning in a river
Feel like I'm drowning
Drowning in a river
In three more days I'll leave this town
And disappear without a trace
A year from now maybe settle down
Where no one knows my face
I wish that I could hold you
One more time to ease the pain
But my time's run out and I got to go
Got to run away again
Still I catch myself thinking
One day I'll find my way back here
You'll save me from drowning
Drowning in a river
Drowning in a river of tears
Drowning in a river
Feels like I'm drowning
Drowning in the river
Oh how long must this go on
Drowning in a river
Drowning in a river of tears <start> What That Firm shit that Firm shit
What That Firm shit that Firm shit
Everyday I'ma polli 'bout who's the best hotty out
And will they ever let Gotti out

Guaranteed eternally you signin' out

Than a dime rhyme like a crime scene reporter
Thought shorty would lose but the game taught her
Hoodrat just like Thelma James's daughter
Killer put you on got you laced in Bucon
Bledest stone where the place you call home
Brooklyn girl plotted then I took the world
You know the whole drill Na Na so ill
Make mills and escro decimals
Cancoon Mexico XandO
Bracelets got all along with gold
Now it's platinum rings songs is sold
Hot from the jumpstart let the gun spark
Thriller will I shot to the top of the charts
Head honcho cat Esco
Push everythin' from the Coupe to the Fo'
Never love a ho get my dick sucked
Smoke the chocolate trick my chicks up
Pass all the ki's to mami whip it up

Can't get enough <start> When I wake up in my house
I get dressed when I get lost
I don't know which way to go
I guess I'll have a cup of Joe
Where the hell was I anyways
So I end up on the street
Walkin' talkin' to my own beat
In a fog in a haze
I've been trippin' out for days
Can you help me find my way home

Don't rock the boat now just let it slide
Groovy people walking back and forth that's right
So I hop onto this bus
Destination reads please save us
Not a soul that know
To be found in this dark hole
Can you help me find my way home
Can you help me find my way home
I'm so tired of looking for the door
Please help me find my way
Please help me find my way
I can't find the door
Where I am now where I am now
I find myself just out there floating <start> I used to be a King and everything around me turned to gold
I thought I had everything and now I'm left without a hand to hold
But it's all right I'm O.K. How are you
For what it's worth I must say I loved you
And in my bed late at night I miss you
Someone is going to take my heart
But no one is going to break my heart again
I used to be a King and everything around me turned to rust
It's 'cause I built my life on sand
And I watched it crumble in the dust
But it's all right I'm O.K. and I want to know how you are
For what it's worth I must say I loved you as you are
And in my bed where are you
Someone is going to take my heart
But no one is going to break my heart again
I used to be a King and everything around me turned around
But I know all I have to do is sing
And I'll life myself way off the ground
But it's all right I'm O.K. How are you
For what it's worth I must say I loved you
And in my bed where are you
Someone is going to take my heart
But no one is going to break my heart again <start> On the silent night so out of place
I almost lost my nerve
When I saw you walk into my space
A woman like you I could not replace
It took some patience to catch your eye
Patience to win your heart
Now it feels like I don't have to worry at all
It's finally forever
There's no hill I would not climb for you
No bridge I wouldn't cross
Not a moment passes in my life
That you're not on my mind
Together or apart
And it took some patience to catch your eye
Patience to win your heart
Now it feels like I don't have to worry at all
It's finally forever
Anytime you're lost
Anywhere you're found
Anytime you want
I will be around
Anywhere you seek
Anywhere you stand
Anytime you fall
Anywhere you limp
Even if you break
Anytime I can I will be there for you
I know that you'll understand
You'll understand
Now I never would have imagined this
So I thank my lucky stars
As I see you in your wedding dress
Never would have guessed you'd fill my open arms
It took some patience to catch your eye
Patience to win your heart
Now it feels like I don't have to worry at all
Yeah it feels like I don't have to worry at all
Yeah it feels like I don't have to worry at all
It's finally forever
Finally forever <start> everyday I fade away
everyday I'm walking into danger
a magic force drowns myself
all fear is gone
I'm addicted to you stranger
seems like the quest gains some sense
all i knew changed
i will never go back and close my eyes
chorus
be my angel
burn my eyes with your light
be my fallen angel
kiss my soul with your shade
be my fallen angel
more and more I disappear
and more and more I feel the creeping danger
I wanna taste just a piece of the forbidden
I just wanna be close
chorus
be my angel
burn my eyes with your light
be my fallen angel
kiss my soul with your shade
be my fallen angel
be my angel
burn my eyes with your light
be my fallen angel
oh be my angel... <start> I know that you are worth waiting for
But I don't have the time
I've been waiting for years already
But that didn't make you mine
My clock is ticking faster
Than I ever thought it would
So I can't wait for your love
God knows I wish I could
Right there in the mist before me
I see its ghostly scheme
Stretching castiron fingers
Upon a bloodred stream
This bridge has been the hope of many
For just as many it has been the end
Now I'm the next in line to lay my life
Faithfully into this hand
I know that you are worth waiting for
But I don't have the time
I've been waiting for years already
But that didn't make you mine
My clock is ticking faster
Than I ever thought it would
So I can't wait for your love
God knows I wish I could
There's a bridge ahead that spans a river wide
If you don't dare the walk you won't reach my side
If you walk that bridge the bridge may break
But that's a risk that you will have to take
If it breaks the river takes you in
And a whole new journey will begin
There's a secret down in that river deep
But those who find it don't come back to speak <start> Well I'm sorry bout the weather
And I'm sorry that the drive was much too far
Seems like everything is business
And we're sorry all the time
When we're home 
What is home 
Home is home 
Where we love the weather
Are you sorry that you love me
Am I sorry I love you too
Seems it doesn't make a difference
That we're sorry all the time
When we're home 
What is home 
Home is home 
Where we love the weather <start> Que donde el punto de mira pones
La bala disparas todos lo saben
Jugando a policas y ladrones
Ya no caben discusiones
Que no sepa tu mano izquierda
Lo que har la derecha
Que el uniforme te sienta mejor
Y la amenaza practicas
Embargo bloqueo boicot
Para Amrica Latina
Que no sepa tu mano izquierda
Lo que har la derecha
Y no hay mal que por bien no venga
Aunque el mal siempre quede fuera
Que con cerrar luego bien la frontera
Puedes hacer lo que quieras
Que no vale la pena discutir
Si lo podemos arreglar a tiros
Que en esta escalera de vecinos
El quinto patio no puede decidir
Que no sepa tu mano izquierda
Lo que har la derecha
Que no sepa tu mano izquierda
Lo que har la derecha
Que los salvajes campan por la selva
Con ignorantes no se conversa
No hicieron bien la tarea
Que la respuesta no es la correcta
Que no sepa tu mano izquierda
Lo que har la derecha
Que no sepa tu mano izquierda
Lo que har la derecha <start> Straight from the ghetto streets of Harlem
came two brothers Willis and Arnold
black goldfish swims in the bowl
he's three feet high four with the afro
stealing cookies from the cookie jar
droppin' water balloons on cars
I hope Mrs. Garret won't see
just play sick for Mohammed Ali
now the Gooch is coming
to steal milk money.
Arnold and Willis and Mr. Drumondd
and don't forget Kimberly
They just canceled Dukes of Hazard
Different Strokes is all I want to see.
Way up high in the penthouse apartment
making us laugh its Willis and Arnold
Mr. Drumondd's got the dough
they get to ride in a limo
Different Strokes its almost time.
We just watch 'cause Kimberly's fine.
half hour long it never fills us
when he says What you talkin' 'bout Willis.
write the cable company
Different strokes all the time. <start> You shine
Where others fade
You dare
To be so brave
Don't compromise
No one can touch you
Just believe
Just believe
Come to heaven silva halo
Come to heaven silva halo
Silva halo
Silva halo <start> You said you're a wreck you get so upset
You said that you'd ruin everything
the first chance you get
But your chances come day after day
as I drunkenly slander your name
Is it possible you've become fond
of the lushes we've become
Don't make love so hard
You said that's enough you've been acting so bored
You said it's too much
You can't take anymore
but day after day that I'm gone
You anxiously wait for that call
it's almost as if you would miss me
if I never returned at all...
Don't make love so hard
I sit at the bar you're off playing pool
still you keep a close eye on which
girls I've been talking to..
But day after day stumbles by
and I've yet to abandon your side
has jealousy's venomous dart poisoned
the well of your heart
Don't make love so hard
La la la la
La la la la  I love you <start> Oh my dear what have we here
An endless drift and a silent affair
I can't understand what's in my heart
All was bliss all has gone dark
Since I killed my idols melted down my vinyl
Made a black hole to another world
Got homicidal now my heart ain't in it
I don't like to fake it
Got a part time wonder
Please don't ever tell my lover
Please don't ever tell my lover
Please don't ever tell my lover
Please don't ever tell my lover
And on I've went conceal and repent
I've lost the charm and the spark I had left
The hole has a dance alone in my chest
Every hour my brain is undressed
And so I killed my idols they're dead in the vinyl
Oh the piece came out of my soul it's a recital
Now she won't understand
The dark side of my heart
All the part time wonders
Please don't ever tell my lover
Please don't ever tell my lover
Please don't ever tell my lover
Please don't ever tell my lover
Alright now
Every now and then I wander back
Every time I keep comin' back
Every now and then I wander back
Please don't ever tell my lover
Please don't ever tell my lover
Please don't ever tell my lover
Please don't ever tell my lover <start> Law  order throughout the land on which our future's already planned to
serve the leaders quest for power to remember our position to respect that
shower who decide the masses th rich v the poor the left and the right

heard of freedom but it Just don't exist Systematic force rules right

A stand everday we support the shower the office boy the dole girl gets

hold the people back fight one another and you fuck yourself fool so If
you're looking for the answer then the answer is you. <start> The reason why oh I can't say I have to let you go baby and right away
After what you did I can't stay now
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone
Baby for a long time  you had me believe 
That your love was all mine  and that's the way it would be
But I didn't know  that you were putting me on
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone when you're gone
Now I gotta say  that it's not like before 
And I'm not gonna play your games any more 
After what you did I can't stay on
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone
Oh when you're gone oh when you goneoh when you gone <start> Ten feet high
I can't fly and
Stand on
Facedown
Can't be gone
Fell for 
Missing my luck

I can't stop my fall
For your eyes
Not for an hour
And not for your smile
Please don't be late
'Cause you know I can't wait
And don't blame
And be insane <start> Im rambling at the end of my rope
How everybodys cheap with their hope
That Ill believe in bullshit
And Im in it pretty deep
Everybody wants me to die
The ones that worship headlights
Wont know that Im the hero
In this good tragedy
I killed a man who had no concern
Im civilized and he was absurd
I guess I didnt mean it
But Id do it once again
You borrowed something Id never loan
He stayed the night when I wasnt home
I shot him in the morning
And in the afternoon
Id have done it in the evening
But then he didnt move
Oh I dont mind
Oh I dont mind
What you took from me
What you owe to me
Cause Ill see you again
You ripped from the end of the road
And tied me to the bed post
Incited me with murder
Condemning me to die
You battled for the truth in your lies
Youve tidied up my heart with a knife
And somehow Im the murder
A victim of your crime
Oh Id never take it further
Than taking his damn life
Oh I dont mind
Oh I dont mind
What you took from me
What you owe to me
Cause Ill see you again
And now you are the cure
And now it is my time
And Ill become your burden
The rest of your damn life
Oh I dont mind
What you took from me
What you stole from me
Cause Ill see you again <start> Get psycho I wanna get psycho

Por tanto amor por tanta emoo
A vida me fez assim
Doce ou atroz manso ou feroz
Eu caador de mim
Preso a canes
Entregue a paixes que nunca
Tiveram fim
Vou me encontrar longe do meu lugar
Eu caador de mim
Nada a temer
Seno o correr da luta
Nada a fazer
Seno esquecer o medo
Abrir o peito  fora
Numa procura
Fugir s armadilhas da meta escura
Longe se vai sonhando demais
Mas onde se chega assim
Vou descobrir o que me faz sentir
Eu caador de mim <start> Corra vagabundo olha a polcia a
Porque eu no quero ficar na cadeia
o dia inteiro a noite inteira
o dia passa na doideira e tambm passa do ponto
Chegamos onde deveria ser
Vagabundo deitado mo na cabea identidade
No minta no porque se no vai ser pior pra voc
Corra vagabundo olha a polcia ai
Corra vagabundo olha a polcia ai
Vagabundo e pol...
Vagabundo e pol...
Vagabundo e pol...
Vagabundo e pol...
By RafaelHitman <start> Put your dreams away for another day
And I will take their place in your heart
Wishing on a star never got you far
And so it's time to make a new start
When your dreams at night
Fade before you
Then I'll have the right
To adore you
Let your kiss confess this is happiness darling
And put all your dreams away <start> I won't laugh at you when you boo hoo hoo
Coz I luv you
I can turn my back on the things you lack
Coz I luv you
I just like the things you do ooohhh
Don't you change the things you do ooohhh
You get me in a spot then smile the smile you got
And I luv you
You make me out a clown and you put me down
I still luv you
I just like the things you do ooohhh
Don't you change the things you do ooohhh
When you bite your lip
You're gonna flip your flip
But I luv you
When we're miles apart
You still reach my heart
How I luv you
I just like the things you do ooohhh
Don't you change the things you do ooohhh
Only time can tell
If we get on well
Coz I luv you
All that's passed us by
You can only sigh hi hi
Coz I luv you
I just like the things you do ooohhh
Don't you change the things you do no no no <start> Welcome to the VIP room
Full of hypocrites and phonies
But no need to fear
Everyone kisses ass
Until you walk away that is..
Before coming any further
Here's a mirror for you to see
Be sure your costume and mask are straight
We won't want to see the real you
WE ARE LIVING IN A WORLD THAT'S FULL OF FAKES..
WE ARE LIVING IN A WORLD THAT'S FULL OF RUMORS..
WE ARE LIVING IN A WORLD THAT'S FULL OF EVIL..
WE ARE LIVING IN A WORLD THAT'S FULL OF HATE
Next we raid the beverage bar
Relax unwind impair your judgment
Guarantees comfort once you've had a few
How else do you think we can tolerate each other
Alcohol not doing it for you
Just visit the bathroom
exclusive for drug users
I don't know his name
But he looks damn cool
WE ARE LIVING IN A WORLD THAT'S FULL OF FAKES..
WE ARE LIVING IN A WORLD THAT'S FULL OF RUMORS..
WE ARE LIVING IN A WORLD THAT'S FULL OF EVIL..
WE ARE LIVING IN A WORLD THAT'S FULL OF HATE
Loss of sensation
Live entertainment
No waiting in line
Special treatment
The scene is no longer
For the poor and the exploited
What has been created
You destroy
WE ARE LIVING IN A WORLD THAT'S FULL OF FAKES.. YOU WONT GET ME
WE ARE LIVING IN A WORLD THAT'S FULL OF RUMORS.. YOU RICH BRATS
WE ARE LIVING IN A WORLD THAT'S FULL OF EVIL.. TWO FACED SCUM
WE ARE LIVING IN A WORLD THAT'S FULL OF HATE
Now that you're settled down
We can follow the conversation
Nice belt nice shirt
Thank you very much I like your shoes too
The night is almost over
you missed the entertainment
Didn't you know you were it
Sex  drugs  glamour
Is that what it's about
WE ARE LIVING IN A WORLD THAT'S FULL OF FAKES.. YOU WONT GET ME
WE ARE LIVING IN A WORLD THAT'S FULL OF RUMORS.. YOU RICH BRATS
WE ARE LIVING IN A WORLD THAT'S FULL OF EVIL.. TWO FACED SCUM

FUCK YOOUUU <start> Estoy hablando de una perra
una perra que conoc
solo yo segu tras sus pasos
aquella noche de calor.
Hablando de vos
tan solo de vos
no hay nadie mas
por la que quieras llorar.
El humo de su cigarrillo
me invitaba a saltar
es su cuerpo de pantera
y no lo puedo soportar.
Hablando de vos
tan solo de vos
no hay nadie mas
por la que quieras llorar. <start> It's a long long way from where I am
To where I ought to be.
I can't remember where I made this turn
Into noman's land as far as I can see.
Stranded being and abroken down
With only one way from this place.
I always find the strength I need
In the arms of my Angel and my saving grace.
And I ain't sure how you carry me
Through the darkest hours so easily.
And I ain't sure how you carry this load
Down a hundred miles of bad road.
I handed you what was left of me
Prayin' it would be enough.
This black and blue and aworn out heart
Was empty 'til you filled it up with your love.
And I ain't sure how you carry me
Through the darkest hours so easily.
And I ain't sure how you carry this load
Down a hundred miles of bad road.
Is all I'll ever see.
If there's an easier way it ain't shown itself to me.
But the burden ain't as heavy as it used to be.
And I ain't sure how you carry me
Through the darkest hours so easily.
And I ain't sure how you carry this load.
I ain't sure how you carry me
Through the darkest hours so easily.
And I ain't sure how you carry this load
Down a hundred miles of bad road.
Down a hundred miles of bad road.
Yeah.
Yeah down a hundred miles of bad road. <start> Jackson was an actor
At least he was when he was well
Stephanie was good to me but not so much to herself
We were holed up in a hotel room from August to November
It was Jackson me and Stephanie
The rest I don't remember
Stephanie appeared to me in the back half of the theater
We met up with Jackson on the strand a few days later
We pooled our funds and made a run
We were foolproof when it counted
It was Jackson me and Stephanie
And it didn't seem all that crowded
Now why you asking about Jackson
It was a long time ago and nothing really happened
Why you asking about Jackson
Jackson just got restless
Couldn't take the lack of action
He was sort of like a shark
He just had to keep on swimming
And the sailors kept on coming off the boats down at the harbor
It was difficult to stop
It was easy to get started
Stephanie came on strong but suddenly went weak
She seemed a little speedy and her tongue worked at her teeth
The sirens came behind us
It was a bit be fore we heard it
It was Jackson me and Stephanie
And for a while it felt just perfect
Now why you asking about Jackson
It was a long time ago and nothing really happened
Someone said he ended up in Denver
Someone said he went to Kansas City
Someone said he went off the deep end
Some said he was living there already
One day Jackson just didn't show up to the party
One day Jackson just didn't show up to the party
Stephanie was long on looks and short on mental health
She said depression is an ocean and it's prone to tides and swells
Anxiety's persistent
It's an ambitious politician
It keeps knocking on your door
Until you come and let it in
I think that Jackson let it in
I think Jackson let it in <start> Well my room has got two windows
But the sun don't ever shine through
And I've been so sad and lonely
Since I broke off baby with you
Chorus
I live on a lonely avenue
Since you said that we were through
I feel so sad and lonely
And it's all because of you
I could cry or I could die
I live on a lonely avenue
Yes I do lonely avenue
Well my pillow is made of lead
And my cover is made of stone
And I toss and turn every night
I'm not used to being alone
Chorus
Baby
I could cry yeah I could die
I live on a lonely avenue
Don't you know children it's a lonely avenue
Play your guitar
Oh children this is a lonely avenue
Well my pillow is made of lead
And my cover is made of stone
But I toss and turn every night
I'm not used to being alone
Chorus
I could cry or I could die
Oh I live on a lonely avenue
Lord ain't this a lonely avenue
Well well it's a lonely avenue tell him now
I live on a lonely avenue <start> Take care beware you need protection
Like the monkey in the jungle don't slip watch the curb
You need protection there's a car coming your name's on it
Like the whales in the ocean you could be come extinct
Don't let them haunt us
You know what I'm thinking
You better believe all the animals need protection
You need protection
A careless cigarette slip with the matches
brush fires burning
Animals on the run who's gonna help them now there's nowhere to go
You need protection
You need protection I need protection too
In a square package some call it prevention
Do you wanna have some fun You need protection
There's a killer disease running wild it's out to get you
All those people they need protection
Standing still in great masses lead them some shelter
There's a nuclear rain coming soon get your lead umbrella
You need protection I need protection too <start> You know those things I said
All those things that made you cry
I didn't really mean that stuff
I didn't really mean that stuff
All I ever really mean
When I scream and shout the way I do
Is I don't know
I really don't
I'm just the same as you
You know those things I said
All those things that made you
Run away from me
I didn't mean a word
I didn't really mean I don't believe
All I ever really mean
When I rant and rave the way I do
Is I'm scared
I'm scared
I'm just as scared as you
And sometimes it's so hard
Not to just throw it all away
Sometimes it's so hard
Not to just throw it all away
Like all those things I said
All those things that made you cry
I didn't really mean that stuff
I didn't really mean to say goodbye
You know those things I said
All those things that made you
Run away from me
I didn't mean a word
I didn't really mean I don't believe
All I ever really mean
When I scream and shout the way I do
Is I'm scared
I'm scared
I'm just as scared as you <start> 
Hey mister can you tell me
What this world's about
It might just help me out
I used to be a dreamer
But my dreams have burned
You know how luck can turn
Sometimes it's hard to find a friendly face
Feel like a stranger to the human race
It's such a lonely lonely place
I walk alone in the darkness of the city
Got no place to call home
I might be dyin'
But you can't hear a sound
'cause midnight rain is comin' down
I'm just a stranger a stranger in this town
Everybody loves a winner
Till the winners lose
And then it's front page news
Nobody loves a loser
When you're down and out
You know there ain't no doubt
I'm just a victim of circumstance
Please mister give me a helping hand
Brother won't you understand
I walk alone in the darkness of the city
Got no place to call home
I might be dyin'
But you can't hear a sound
'cause midnight rain is comin' down
I'm just a stranger a stranger in this town
I'm just a victim of circumstance
Please mister give me a helping hand
Brother won't you understand
I walk alone in the darkness of the city
Got no place to call home
I might be dyin'
But you can't hear a sound
'cause midnight rain is comin' down
I'm just a stranger a stranger in this town
I mean no danger I'm a stranger I'm a stranger
I'm a stranger in this town...
I mean no danger I'm a stranger...
I'm just a stranger in this town <start> Relations are artificial will we give it a new beginning
Find the essence in ourselves and escape through the tunnel
Transferring spirits. The second coming
Shattering bodies and rising fire
A broken man came our way. He'd lost his harvest
Sunken he gazedThere lies the blessing
Forthcoming shadows are unfulfilled
Striving forward and deliver innocence <start> You couldn't tell from my tone that I want you
You couldn't guess from the vibe that you're mine
Shot glasses burnt out cigarettes
You wanted nothing baby get in line
I couldn't stay though I thought you'd be waiting holding your breath while I wore out the crown
Clock freezes no change in scenery
I closed my eyes and you opened the ground
So I watch and I wait and I pace
You gave rope so I'm hanging around
Bad blood is maybe what we need tonight in our veins
Bad blood we're dancing on the edge of the knife
Can you feel it
Tonight we bring our bodies to life
I come crawling back through the cracks in your windows
I'm seeping into your skin through the walls
Grand delusions of petty criminals if I'm not everything I'm nothing at all
So I watch and I wait and I pace
You gave rope so I'm hanging around
Bad blood is maybe what we need tonight in our veins
Bad blood we're dancing on the edge of the knife
Can you feel it
Tonight we bring our bodies to life
Bad blood is maybe what we need tonight in our veins
Bad blood I'm crashing right in front of your eyes
Can you feel it
Tonight we bring our bodies to life
Where was I when you thought I crossed the line
Where was I when the gears began to grind
Where was I while the band kept playing on
Where was I when you knew I was wrong
Bad blood is maybe what we need tonight in our veins
Bad blood we're dancing on the edge of the knife
Can you feel it
Tonight we bring our bodies to life
Bad blood is maybe what we need tonight in our veins
Bad blood I'm crashing right in front of your eyes
Can you feel it
Tonight we bring our bodies to life
Come on baby get in line
Tonight we bring our bodies to life <start> Goodbye there's a word I've hated all my life.
Unanticipated tears can hurt so much
My friend it's so sad to see you at love's end
I've been through the pain myself it's really wrong
To play it strong.
Go on and cry till you run dry it's alright.
Go on and scream at broken dreams it's alright.
Let sorrow have its day and when its done
Life will go on.
In time thoughts of might have been will leave your mind
And sweet forgetfulness will come
Don't worry now just when or how
Go and cry till you run dry it's alright
Go on and scream at broken dreams it's alright.
Let sorrow have its day to cry out is no crime
In no time life will go on.
Go on and cry till you run day it's alright.
Go on and scream at broken dreams it's alright.
Let sorrow have its day and when it's done
Life will go on and on.
It's alright oh it's alright.
Let sorrow have its day and when it's done
Life will go on and on <start> Well my head is spinnin'
Like a spinnin' top
I got rhythm in my feet
And I really wanna hop
I wanna jump with you baby
I wanna jump with you baby
I wanna jump with you baby
Babe I mean tonight
I got money to waste
A car to drive
We'll go out and play
The joints a little while
I wanna jump with you baby
I wanna jump with you baby
I wanna jump with you baby
Babe I mean tonight
And we'll take in a show
And go to a dance
You won't be lonesome
'Cause I'll make romance
I wanna jump with you baby
I wanna jump with you baby
I wanna jump with you baby
Babe I mean tonight
Now wait let's have a little taste
'Cause haste makes waste
We might wanna stop
At another little place
I wanna jump with you baby
I wanna jump with you baby
I wanna jump with you baby
Babe I mean tonight <start> Once I was a shadow of a man
Most dark nights my head was in it's hands
I begged God to cure my aching limbs
But he did nothing he gave me no advice
Didn't this God abandon Jesus Christ
Oh if it comes to you I'll die for your sins
I am the drug that you've been waiting for
An urgent craving you cannot ignore
I am the fix that you come back for more
I am the drug
Bring out the dead I'll show them how to live
Free their souls and watch them slowly drift
Like feathers of a wounded bird
I was wrapped up in a wooden box
Ball and chain head out on the block
Oh I wonder if you could say the final word
I am the drug that you've been waiting for
An urgent craving you cannot ignore
I am the fix that you come back for more
I am the drug
This is not a flash a figment of your imagination
I am much more then a first degree of separation
Without me all the lines of reality will blur
And the wall will breathe close in like some forgotten curse
I am the drug that you've been waiting for
An urgent craving you cannot ignore
I am the fix that you come back for more
I am the drug <start> How does it feel to lose at your own game
How does it feel to know that you've been played
Now when you see me I'm your everything
Now at your need me I've got alibi

I don't play games if I want you
I just take things when I want to
What I like when I like if I want
Who I like how I like when I want
You never thought that I could get control
I should've warned you I've done this before
If I wanted that I could get it right now
Put you on your knees take what I give out
Make you do things you would never do
Just because I can I thought that you knew

Who I like how I like when I want x
 <start> hey you got to take on the tide if you will if you want all the best of me
got to shake out the pride if you dare if you want all the best of me
got to choke on the strife if you can if you want all the best of me
got to take on the life if you tend if you should want the best
Don't you care that your heart will loose its grasp for reality
Do you cry for yourself in the darkness of apathy
new sun will rise through the cracks in the darkness
though i may fall alone  they will feel my clarity
why destroy why
you thought the price and a blood you put down could buy all of the of me
you thought the slice you made without regret would cut out all of the best in me
you sought to pry through my armor and light to get to what is best in me
you ought to cry through your anchor and lust to get to what is best
don't you care that your heart will loose its grasp for reality
do you cry for yourself in the darkness of apathy
new sun will rise through the cracks in the darkness
though i may fall alone  they will feel my clarity
why destroy why <start> H A M L E T yeah

How they shimmer shine so bright
Against the black they look so white
Coming down from such a height
To reach me now you reach me now
You should see the moon in the flight
Cutting 'cross the misty night
Softly dancing in sunshine
Reflections of this light
Reach me now you reach me now
And how could such a thing
Shine its light on me
And make everything beautiful again
And you should feel the sun in the spring
Coming out after a rain
Suddenly all is green
Sunshine on everything
I can feel it now I feel you now
And how could such a thing
Shine its light on me
And make everything beautiful
And you should hear the angels sing
All gathered round their King
More beautiful than you could dream
I've been quietly listening
You can hear 'em now I hear em now
And how could such a king
Shine His light on me
And make everything beautiful
And I wanna shine
I wanna be light
I wanna tell you it'll be all right
And I wanna shine and I wanna fly
Just to tell you now
It'll be all right it'll be all right
It'll be all right.
'Cause I've got nothing of my own to give to you
But this light that shines on me shines on you
And makes everything beautiful again.
It'll be all right it'll be all right. <start> What about my philosophy my philosophy
You gotta be your own you gotta be your own dog
You know you know what I'm talking about That's right
You're supposed to say yes like a James Brownthing yeah 
You gotta go sniffin' on your own turf
Be your own dog don't let nobody put a leash on you
Rubbadub a tub fish ping pong
Sneakin' in the dead zone boneyard
Sippin' on a catlap sing song
Trimming off my nostril hairs headcase
An angel in a mellowcake courtpie
Rubbin' like a pussycat gridlock
A stone within my eyeball too too
Dancin' with my socks on oh man
Singin' like a tomtit stop cab
You've been listening to the doors tip top
Entering a smoky barroom hey you
Smuggling a wombat what a day
Chewing on my necktie tweedoll
Tumbling in the margarine heroine
Hidden in the ribbonbrass too too
Actin' like a baby headcase
I don't need no thoughts in me don't you want to rescue me
There's a little light below go there when I want to go
Want to buy the bubblegum ping pong
Trying to pry the red shoes off headcase
Licking on my ice cream cone heroine
Surfing in the kitchen sink what a day
Sippin' on a diet coke hey dude
A toodle to the innercrop tip top
Shopping with my scapegoat top fish
Change a tenner for two fivers too too
Fell off the floor fell off the floor man 
Rita hayworth 
Rita hay
Don't strap yourself to a Volkswagen in a weird harness
Get a harness because it could be dangerous
Don't try this at home
Going out to steal a ruby 
Looking like a rayon love to do it indoor
They all got a say on falling off the damned floor
Succulent but sucked in always I'll be in for
Wanted to be tucked in falling off the same floor
 <start> I've been here before
I know this shade of blue it's you
I've felt your touch before
I know your way
A ghostlike sense of state you're gone
So it seems you know me
I will wait for you I do
I don't care if you can take it
I can't take it anymore I'll die
Don't mind if you can take it
I can't take it anymore I'll die
Slowly I relive a better past a time
I thought I knew I blew
Now I'm patient now I know I'll last
I'll last
I've always known it's true with you
I don't care if you can take it
I can't take it anymore I'll die
Don't mind if you can take it
I can't take it anymore I'll die <start> You see me
Do I look okay to you
Give me your hand
I'll shake it and shake it again
I'll smile 'till my face falls off my head
If it's good for you
It's good for me too
What did I say
Why do you give a shit
They're trying
To pry in
To my brain
But I'm cut on my knee
Down highways
'till I see
Your face
I just need to see you now
I just need to see your now
I don't care about anything else
I don't care about anything else
Their words are flying over my head
I'm trying here
I'm someone else again
You laugh and I smile back to humor you
If it's good for you
Then it's good for me too
What did I say
Why do you give a shit
They're trying
To pry in
To my brain
But I'm cut on my knee
Down highways
'till I see
Your face
I just need to see you now
I just need to see your now
I don't care about anything else
It's raining outside
There's a storm front on my back
Trying to keep
Trying to keep me away from you
A strangers up ahead
Holding up a knife
Trying to keep
Trying to keep me away from you
It's raining outside
There's a storm front on my back
Trying to keep
Trying to keep me away from you
The stars are falling down
Breaking up the road
Trying to keep
Trying to keep me away from you
I scream 'till I bleed
I scream stay away from me
You can't keep me back
Keep me back
I scream 'till I bleed
I scream stay away from me
You can't keep me back
Keep me back
What did I say
Why do you give a shit
I just need to see you now
I just need to see you now
I just need to see you now
I don't care about anything else
I just need to see you now
I don't care about anything else <start> Lord I must be dreamin'
What else could this be
Everybody's screamin'
Runnin' for the sea
Holy lands are sinkin'
Birds take to the sky
The prophets all are stinkin' drunk
I know the reason why
Eyes are full of desire
Mind is so illatease
Everything is on fire
Shit piled up to the knees
Out of rhyme or reason everyone's to blame
Children of the season don't be lame
Sorry you're so sorry
Don't be sorry
Man has known and now he's blown it
Upside down and hell's the only sound we did an awful job
And now they say it's nobody's fault
Old San Andreas
Seven years ago
Shove it up their Richters
Red lines stop and go
Noblemen of courage
Listen with their ears
Spoke without discouragin'
When no one really hears
One of these days you'll be sorry
Too many houses on the stilt
Three million years or just a story
Four on the floor up to the hilt
Out of rhyme or reason everyone's to blame
Children of the season don't be lame
Sorry you're so sorry
Don't be sorry
Man has known and now he's blown it
Upside down and hell's the only sound we did an awful job
And now we're just a little too late
Eyes are full of desire
Mind is so illatease
Everything is on fire
Our shit's piled up in debris
California showtime
Five o'clock's the news
Everybody's concubine was prone to take a snooze
Sorry you're so sorry
Don't be sorry
Man has known and now he's blown it
Upside down and hell's the only sound we did an awful job
And now we're just a little too late <start> How long now have I been here
And how long will I stay
Got a little more work to do
Before I'm on my way
Tying all of my loose ends
Still got debt to pay
Picking up the pieces
Before I'm on my way
Before I'm on my way
Before I'm on my way
Chorus
Before I get there
Before I show up
Before I'm somewhere
Before I grow up
I'll be here taking in right now 'til I'm ready to go
When my time comes along to move on then I'll already know
I'll be ready to go
All the coming and going
I see it everyday
But I got a little more work to do
Before I'm on my way
While I'm still here in the place I lay
I'll be soaking up the moments
Before I'm on my way
Chorus
Before I get there
Before I show up
Before I'm somewhere
Before I grow up
I'll be here taking in right now 'til I'm ready to go
When my time comes along to move on then I'll already know
I'll be ready to go
I do believe that the measure of a man
Is the length he will go from the place he began
And I remind myself as I walk across the land
That the less I overstep means the more I understand
Chorus
Before I get there
Before I show up
Before I'm somewhere
Before I grow up
I'll be here taking in right now 'til I'm ready to go
When my time comes along to move on then I'll already know
I'll be ready to go <start> Watch me closely catch my eye
If you do I beg you to remind me
Who is stronger who is weak of those who seek
And don't know where to find me
Ask me why I don't know
You ask me why and I say
Now you see me now you don't
I thourght by now you'd learned
You're gonna get your fingers burned
Watch me closely understand
That what you see is only an illusion
If I'm wrong and you are right
Then I will light your darkness with confusion
Ask me why I don't know
You ask me why and I say
Chances are you're playing with fire
I thought by now you'd learned
You're gonna get your fingers burned
Watch me closely be aware
That all I do is only to suprise you
Every move is sleight of hand
And every word is planned to mystify you
You ask me why I don't know
You ask me why and I say
Don't get fooled a second time
I thought by now you'd understand
You're gonna get your fingers burned <start> I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me
Funny but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love
Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love
Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one I'm not afraid
If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight forget it
I'm in the mood for love <start> Shes  in  inch heels
and when shes dressed shes always dressed to kill
a flat black car and a big fat ass
shell turn the head of every man shell pass
one mans poison is another mans girl
you can give her loving but she wants the world
Shes real black widow and shes out to get you
and when she sinks her teeth in you are through
Shes got skulls on the wall of the men shes erased
and shes ready to kill by the look on her face
Shes a real black widow and shes out to get you
shes out to get you
With big brown eyes and long red hair
shes set her sights upon a trillionaire
say the devils name and shell appear
if you dont got money the you sure got nothing to fear
one mans treasure is another mans past
shell leave you broken like she did the last
Shes real black widow and shes out to get you
and when she sinks her teeth in you are through
Shes got skulls on the wall of the men that she erased
and shes ready to kill by the look on her face
Shes a real black widow and shes out to get you
shes out to get you
 shes out to get you
 leaves you dead on the floor
 shes ready to call it
shell look a lot taller when shes standing on your wallet
 shes out to get you
 leaves you dead on the floor
 no one to rescue
whos that knocking on your door
Shes real black widow and shes out to get you
and when she sinks her teeth in you are through
Shes got skulls on the wall of the men that she erased
and shes ready to kill by the look on her face
Shes a real black widow and shes out to get you
shes out to get you <start> Was it you who took the money
to the land of milk and honey 
Your past is catching up on you
put it on a conveyor belt.
The chips are down the cards are dealt
you won't be calling trumps no more.
Everone's getting decent
and that's what I regret.
Don't want no mass production
don't want no mass production blues.
I believe in quality
liberate the quantity.
Not like battery hens in a cage
the selfhelp seekers soldier on.
They won't stop 'till the war is won
got no industrial spies 'round here.
One a penny two a penny
blocking up all the roads.
One a penny two a penny
trucks are ditching their loads.
Piling 'em here piling 'em there
blocking out the light of the sun.
One a penny two a penny
and that's just about as cheap as they come. <start> There's a place
A local roadside shack
A poor man's Paris with a parking lot in the back
There's a girl there
She knows how to unwind
She don't talk much but she knows just how to act
I said don't tell me she don't love me
The money's just a mere formality
Every day every night
Somethings going on something's going on
Down the road over yonder
Any place any time when I'm fading
My love lies waiting
Down the road tonight
When I was younger
All the older boys
Would drive me way out past the county fair
They'd laugh and point out
This roadside trailer
And say something wild's going on over there
They said what they're doing
Don't mean nothing to you now
But someday it'll mean everything
There were movies in the parlour
They were dealing oneeyed jacks
And when I said I loved her
She said just keep coming back <start>   .

. <start> I wish I had a wad of cash
I'd throw it in a hat and take a cab
And I'd roll all the way to you yeah
And if I could I would get there fast
Because I want this feeling to last
I think I'm in love with you yeah you
Oh it's a beautiful thing
How you always try to make
Every little thing alright
And oh I am watching you be
Everything you are to me
And it tells me hold on tight
I've got everything everything
I've got everything for you
I've got everything everything
I've got everything to lose
I'd wish for a four leaf clover
I could wish that this would never be over
I don't want to be away from you yeah you <start> one two fk you <start> It's a drunken midnight on the streets
Brightly dusted with a neon light
We duck behind the corner store
Smoke your smokes while I keep
A watchful eye
Right here right now
I hope before the night is through
One fumbled touch will finally hit the spot
You've got everything going for you
So I'll go for you with everything I got
Right here the best days of our lives
Is this coincidence or a sign
Is there anything I missed
Is there anything I missed
Tell me if I'm wrong
But why would we change a thing
When the morning light fights through the cracks
Cascading across the bed and you are mine
When your parents start to wake for work
Between the sheets I'll keep a watchful eye
Right here the best days of our lives
Is this coincidence or a sign
When we met I was on my back
I swear we spent most afternoons
Somewhere in the act
We were part of something ours
And ours alone
Anywhere was home
We're almost here again
We're almost here again
We're almost here again
Right here right now <start> Stuffed my heart in a bag slammed the back door
If I get home it'd be a home no more
Took off runnin' in the middle of the night
I was aimed for anything that felt half right
Look out baby I'm gone a little ride
I see my name written on the center line
Moon looks good air is cool
Every bone been broken in the golden rule
Well I'm flyin' through Dothan with radio
Taylor's ole time opry's playin' hank snow
Sing's my nightmares in his song
I say I'm with ya man I'm just movin' on
Look out baby your wish came true
You got your freedom the house and the whole canoe
I got the things that I need
I took the car my pride and three pairs of jeans
My brain is bleedin' got nails in my spine
But I ain't gonna stop for that empty line
Radio's fadin' road's like a snake
It's two in the mornin' and I'm wide awake
Look out baby gates of Eden got closed
But New Orlean's open see the pretty lights glow
I'm goin' in to get myself lost and found
It didn't take too goddamn long to tear a good thing down
It may not be ideal but at least we're not running at the mouth
I to San Anton' woke up and went south
Fleeced at the border for thirty five and some change
But that's a small price to pay runnin' from the pain
Look out baby I'm gone a little ride
There's a brush fire on the highway gonna burn both sides
Wish I could throw our sins in the flame and smoke
I'll call you up if and when I reach hope <start> Love is the connection
That join two people together
What a sweet connection
When it's right it will last forever
But if you give it a try
And you can't get a vibes
Take my advice
If your heart's not in it let it go
Chorus
Stop wasting time
Don't fool yourself it won't grow
Now if you heart's not in it let it go
Stop wasting time don't fool yourself It won't grow
It's not like a game
Where you loose today
And win tomorrow
Use up your brain
You don't want your world
To tumble over
Don't you rush in
Cause you'll never win
Take my advice
If your hearts not in it let it go
Chorus... <start> Instrumental <start> Oh I will paint my car pink if you like
I will sell my self  for you I would fight
Wanna do everything to get you  now
When you want me on time I wouldn't be late
But be aware  don't let me go
And history shows what men can do
For women they love  they can even start a war
We act we live by this longing for love for girls like you  so...
Gimme your blood  gimme your flesh
Gimme your love  don't treat me like trash
This is what I want  you have to pay the price
Gimme your blood  gimme your flesh
Gimme your love  don't treat me like trash
Gimme a proof of your love
And not a compromise  not a compromise
I would rob a bank for the money you need
I would cool you with ice if you can't stand the heat
Let me be your one and only till I die
I would meet your friends that I don't like at all
Wanna give you a hand when you're about to fall
Would believe in you even if you lie
And history shows what men can do
For women they love  they can even start a war
We act we live by this longing for love for girls like you  so...
Gimme your blood  gimme your flesh
Gimme your love  don't treat me like trash
This is what I want  you have to pay the price
Gimme your blood  gimme your flesh
Gimme your love  don't treat me like trash
I just wanna live out what men dream at night
You are my drug you are my hell
In spite of all I'm feeling well
I'm addicted I am sick I'm in love
Gimme your blood  gimme your flesh
Gimme your love  don't treat me like trash
This is what I want  you have to pay the price
Gimme your blood  gimme your flesh
Gimme your love  don't treat me like trash
Gimme a proof of your love and not a compromise
Gimme your blood gimme your flesh gimme your love
You have to send me signs tonight  we live it up let love be dynamite <start> Roq critic Kent Tucke believes that we're in the midst of a new creative flowering of PopRoq

 <start> It won't be darker
Everyone told me
It won't be darker
A flowery phrase
Some friends are leaving
They simply go to sleep
And shaking darkness
Slowly ripening
I saw a weary man
He watched the playground
Where children dreamed of things he used to dream of...
One says that every sort of human being loses after reaching
a certain age his ability to see
The world with amazing eyes. But who can maintain this without the knowledge
Without the wisdom of infinity We're still dazzling ourselves with
sparks of ignorance.
I won't go that way
I saw the weary man
He turned his heart away from the playground
He looked so sad  as sad as me <start> Another sleepless night
On a foreign shore
Candle flickers by my bed
Locks bolt my door
I drink too much wine
But it gives my brain relief
Stops the meanderings
That root me from my sleep
I stare out at the night
From a sweatsoaked bed
The Queen lays plots in London
But she won't have my head
The candle gutters
The smell sweeps me back
To the icy fields of Kinsale
The bodies burning black
Fire and lightning protect Tirconaill
Fire and brimstone rain down on London
They'll long remember Red Hugh O'Donnell
I could not join that battle
I gave orders from my horse
Wick low snows had withered
The toes inside my boots
Still a fever of anxiety
Racks my bones
All my friends dead
On Kinsale's icy roads
Oh were I back in Ulster
I'd dive in Swilly's foam
Her crystal waters
Would soothe my soul
Dispatches from O'Neill
He grows old and cautious
Our allies are deserting
My blade would rip their stomachs
If Philip won't help
I'll return alone
O'Neill longs for an armistice
What profit in a peace
With a queen who'll break her word
I swear to God
That bitch will taste my sword
I'll drag her red wig from her head
Pull out her poisoned tongue
I must get back to Ulster
The candle is dead
There's footsteps at my door
They halt
I'm tormented by that whore
Who waits at court in London
For word of my demise
Her agents hunt me everywhere
But I will not be taken
By any of her men
My head will not grace London's spike
I'll fight her to the end
Tonight I sup with James Blake
An honest man is he
He's promised me three ships of war
We'll sweep Lizzie from her throne
I will take my place
High King of the Irish
Defender of my faith
With O'Neill as my adviser
O'Byrne at my side
I'll rule with justice
But now the dawn is breaking
On this foreign shore
I will arise and say my prayers
Tomorrow I'll go home <start> I'm gonna make a mistake
I'm gonna do it on purpose
I'm gonna waste my time
'Cause I'm full as a tick
And I'm scratching at the surface
And what I find is mine
And when the day is done and I look back
And the fact is I had fun fumbling around
All the advice I shunned and I ran
Where they told me not to run but I sure
Had fun so
I'm gonna fuck it up again
I'm gonna do another detour
Unpave my path
And if you wanna make sense
Whatcha looking at me for
I'm no good at math
And when I find my way back
The fact is I just may stay or I may not
I've acquired quite a taste
For a wellmade mistake
I wanna mistake why can't I make a mistake
I...
I'm always doing what I think I should
Almost always doing everybody good
Why
Do I wanna do right of course but
Do I really wanna feel I'm forced to
Answer you hell no
I've acquired quite a taste
For a wellmade mistake I wanna
Make a mistake why can't I make a mistake
I...
I'm always doing what I think I should
Almost always doing everybody good
Why <start> Stepping outside
there's no turning back.
Looking behind
there's no turning back.
Nowhere to hide 
watch out for the man in drag
she's got you tagged
Checking all around
there's no turning back.
Listen for a sound
there's no turning back.
Keep your head down 
watch out for the gobetween
The Cloak and Dagger Man
Follows 
Run undercover and
trust in no one you know.
Watch what you say
there's no turning back.
Lover's will betray
Watch out for the promise of...

 <start> Between us I feel this undeniable thing
Between us so real this unavoidable thing
Between us I see this undefinable thing between us
Everytime you say the words it's real
And everytime you say the words I feel
The night is long today my love for you has changed
The night is long today a hope has been replaced
All the steps we take the ones that lead away a little
When we walk away we only grow more near
When we turn away it all becomes so clear
This unavoidable thing joining us
Everytime you say the words it's real
And everytime you say the words I feel
The night is long today my love for you has changed
The night is long today a hope has been replaced
All the steps we take the ones that lead away a little
A little too late a little too soon a little
To give a little to take a little to lose a little
To find a little to die a little to live a little
And it won't be long... x
'Cause it's falling down and I'll take you there... <start> The speculators made their money on the blood you shed
Your momma's pulled the sheets up off your bed
Profiteers on James Street sold your shoes and clothes
Ain't nobody talkin' because everybody knows
We pulled your cycle up back the garage and polished up the chrome
Our gypsy biker coming home
Sister Mary sits with your colors but Johnny's drunk and gone
This old town's been rousted which side you on
They would march up over the hill this old fools parade
Shouting victory for the righteous for you must hear the grace
Ain't nobody talkin' but just waiting on the phone
Gypsy biker coming home
We rode into the foothills Bobby brought the gasoline
We stood around the circle as she lit up the ravine
The spring hot desert wind rushed down on us all the way back home
To the dead well it don't matter much 'bout who's wrong or right
You asked me that question I didn't get it right
You slipped into your darkness now all that remains
Is my love for you brother life's still unchanged
To him that threw you away you ain't nothing but gone
My gypsy biker's coming home
And now I'm out countin' white lines
Countin' white lines and getting stoned
My gypsy biker's coming home
La la la la <start> Cool hearted love turnin' around
You brought me to the move
You were sure to turn them down
Your streets are filled
Confused again which one is your enemy
And which one is your friend
Look what you've done to your brothers lately
Look what you've done look what you've done
Look what you've done to your brothers lately lately
Caught in a trap caged in by walls
You threw me scraps but I turned them into darts
And now they flew from side to side
They past is gonna get you if the future steps aside side
Look what you've done to your brother lately
Look what you've done look what you've done
Look what you've done to your brother lately lately lately
Out on the bridge dancin' around
I caught you standin' there
You threw away your doubts
While I was gone you hit it out
But then I turned around
And found out what you lied about
Look what you've done to your brothers lately
Look what you've done look what you've done
Look what you've done to your people lately
Sing me your songs over your rows
Look what you've done to your sisters lately
Brothers and sisters won't you turn me up around sayin'
Look what you've done to your brothers lately now <start> Oh whoaoh well the pony was funky

Raging rivers of shark attack
Find love
Then give it all away
Wrestle bears bring 'em to their knees
Steal the honey from killer bees
Find love
Then give it all away
Don't be scared to connect the dots
Dig for gold in the parking lot
Find love
Then give it all away <start> Coming in from London from over the pond
Flyin' in a big airliner
Chickens flyin' everywhere around the plane
Could we ever feel much finer
Comin' into Los Angeles
Bringin' in a couple of keys
Don't touch my bags if you please mister customs man
There's a guy with a ticket to Mexico
No he couldn't look much stranger
Walkin' in the hall with his things and all
Smilin said he was the lone ranger
Comin' into Los Angeles
Bringin' in a couple of keys
Don't touch my bags if you please mister customs man
Hip woman walkin' on the movin' floor
Trippin' on the escalator
There's a man in the line and she's blowin' his mind
Thinkin' that he's already made her
Comin' into Los Angeles
Bringin' in a couple of keys
Don't touch my bags if you please mister customs man
Comin' in from London from over the poll
Flyin' in a big airliner
Chickens flyin' everywhere around the plane

I heard the news there's good rockin' tonight <start> You don't need no love in
You don't need no bed pan
You don't need a horoscope or a microscope
The see the mess that you're in
If you open up your heart
You will know what I mean
We've been polluted so long
Now here's a way for you to get clean
By chanting the names of the Lord and you'll be free
The Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see
Chanting the names of the Lord and you'll be free
The Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see
You don't need no passport
And you don't need no visas
You don't need to designate or to emigrate
Before you can see Jesus
If you open up your heart
You'll see he's right there
Always was and will be
He'll relieve you of your cares
By chanting the names of the Lord and you'll be free
The Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see
Chanting the names of the Lord and you'll be free
The Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see
You don't need no church house
And you don't need no Temple
You don't need no rosary beads or them books to read
To see that you have fallen
If you open up your heart
You will know what I mean
We've been kept down so long
Someone's thinking that we're all green
And while the Pope owns fifty one percent of General Motors
And the stock exchange is the only thing he's qualified to quote us
The Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see
By chanting the names of the Lord and you'll be free <start> Clap until you hands hurt
standing ovations or boobooboos
Wawatch us until we blur
Walk off into the sunset
Tell Rock'n'Roll
I'm alone again
I want to pick the mid west home again
Your time has passed
They say never means never
So the fast dance won't last
Clap until you hands hurt
Standing ovations or boobooboos
Wawatch us until we blur
Walk off into the sunset
Tell Rock'n'Roll
I'm alone again
I want to pick the mid west home again
Your time has passed
They say never means never
So the fast dance won't last
But never means forever
Never means forever
ALPHAdog and oh OMEGAlomaniac
Eh eh eheh eh eh
ALPHAdog and oh OMEGAMEGAlo
Welcome to the new dj vu
I can almost see the wizard through the curtains
ALPHAdog and oh OMEGAlomaniac
Eh eh
Eheh eh eh <start> I'm a little older now
There's scars and there are frowns
There's memories in the dust
The skin that I live in is cool and paper thin
It's got a swan song to sing
I've blushed and I have bruised
Felt the passing of youth
I've bled and I have healed
Held babes in my arms
Counted lovers counted scars
The prayers when I had you
Cause I have my time
It dances in the skin when I smile
And for the years that pass me by
My body's an old good friend of mine
And when the nerves are warmed
In tiny hairs and rows
In cells that call my name
I feel those echoes out
And you are in the scars under my shirt again
Cause I have my time
It dances in the skin when I smile
And for the years that pass me by
My body's an old good friend of mine
My body's an old good friend of mine <start> All our times have come
Here but now there gone
Seasons don't fear the reaper
Nor do the wind the sun or the rain

Come on baby

Baby take my hand

We'll be able to fly

Baby I'm your man
La la la la la
La la la la la
Valentine is done
Here but now they're gone
Romeo and Juliet
Are together in eternity

 men and women every day

 men and women every day

Another  coming every day

Come on baby

Baby take my hand

We'll be able to fly

Baby I'm your man
La la la la la
La la la la la
Love of two is one
Here but now they're gone
Came the last night of sadness
And it was clear she couldn't go on
Then the door was open and the wind appeared
The candles blew and then disappeared
The curtains flew and then he appeared

Come on baby

And she ran to him

They looked backward and said goodbye

She had taken his hand

Come on baby
 <start> Tell me is my time is wasted Or am I ok Would you be friends with me on any other day Well. I know we've been through this before. But I remember thinking that we were through. NNNNothing would matter if it was me and you. If we were naked we'd make it yeah me and you. Don't ever fake it or baby I say we're through. If I could shake it I'd shake it just for you. If we don't make it we'll just fake it and see this through. When this is going down I see you running out. You better keep your word or you can shut your... <start> Livin' and dreamin' in a world full of fear
Playin' with feelings that carried me here today
Lost in the memories of days gone by
Runnin' on empty and the wells run dry today
It's so far away
That I could fade away
 I'll fly
Cross this river of tears
And I'll fly
Cross this river of tears
'Cause a lonely heart could die alone
In this river of tears
I could hear thunder but I couldn't feel the rain
I fell down under this dangerous game
We play
It's so far away
That I could fade away
 I'll fly
Cross this river of tears
And I'll fly
Cross this river of tears
'Cause a lonely heart could die alone
In this river of tears
So I could fade away
 I'll fly
Cross this river of tears
And I'll fly
Cross this river of tears
'Cause a lonely heart could die alone
'Cause a lonely heart could die alone
In this river of tears
In this river of tears
I'll fly
I'll fly
I'll fly
I'll fly
Cross this river of tears
I'll fly
I'll fly... <start> Listen listen
I'm listening carefully
to where exactly you might be
'cause I've had enough waiting
I've had enough waiting for you
I'm thinking I'm thinking
Of growing old with someone
as beautiful as you
Just ask me to
and just ask me to
You
I'm recalling recalling
Putting on jackets way too thin
To fight against snow way too thick
And it coming down sideways
and you clearing my eyes
Oooh
Ive had a little too much to think
I've had a little too much to think
And empty rooms tend to make me believe in you
Surrounded by everything I own
boxed and labeled ready to go
And not before time and not before time
I'm listening
I'm listening <start> I married Isis on the fifth day of May
But I could not hold on to her very long
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
For the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong
I came to a high place of darkness and light
Dividing line ran through the center of town
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down
A man in the corner approached me for a match
I knew right away he was not ordinary
He said are you lookin' for somethin' easy to catch
Said I got no money he said that ain't necessary
We set out that night for the cold in the North
I gave him my blanket he gave me his word
I said where are we goin' he said we'd be back by the fourth
I said that's the best news that I've ever heard
I was thinkin' about turquoise I was thinkin' about gold
I was thinkin' about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace
As we rode through the canyons through the devilish cold
I was thinkin' about Isis how she thought I was so reckless
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
And things would be different the next time we wed
If I only could hang on and just be her friend
I still can't remember all the best things she said
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice
He said there's a body I'm tryin' to find
If I carry it out it'll bring a good price
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind
The wind it was howlin' and the snow was outrageous
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn
When he died I was hopin' that it wasn't contagious
But I made up my mind that I had to go on
I broke into the tomb but the casket was empty
There was no jewels no nothin' I felt I'd been had
When I saw that my partner was just bein' friendly
When I took up his offer I musta been mad
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed
I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes
I cursed her one time then I rode on ahead
She said where ya been I said no place special
She said you look different I said well I guess
She said you been gone I said that's only natural
She said you gonna stay I said yeah I might do
Isis oh Isis you mystical child
What drives me to you is what drives me insane
I still can remember the way that you smiled
On the fifth day of May in the drizzlin' rain <start> It's under control but the sun and the moon
Have been after each other from night until noon
Chasin' around like a couple of fools
In a race of the clouds like a bloody cartoon
I hope I find my way home someday soon
Comfortable creatures and wonderless moves
Have been tirelessly learning their lines and their rules
turnin around in their colorful shoes
and surprising themselves with their wonderful moods
You know I would do anything for you
I hope I find my way home someday soon
So where are you going when you know where you belong
What do you think you're going to find
Follow the moon until the morning plays along
Same as it happens every time
Every time every time
Forget to remember there's nothing to prove
And I get to the end and it must have been true
I mostly remember the way that you look
And the only thing left is i'm lonely for you
Everything reminds me of you
And I hope I find my way home someday soon
So where are you going when you know where you belong
What do you think you're going to prove
Follow the moon until the morning plays along
Same as you always do
It's under control but the sun and the moon
Have been after each other from night until noon
Chasin' around like a couple of fools
In a race of the clouds like another cartoon
I know I'll find my way home someday soon <start> Upon a veil of midnight blue
There hung a crescent moon
To light the view
But I don't whisper the words
When the moment arose
I wonder how he knows
You say your tongue is tied
Your words escape and hide
But he's so patient and kind
He's prepared to read your mind
That's very well till you find
Because of the wine you drank
Your mind is still a blank
I wonder how he knows
I guess I will wonder until
I pluck up the courage to tell him
How I feel
So close I can feel his heart tremble
That look in his eyes as they close
I wonder how he knows
I wonder how he knows <start> Lets start with just the basics then
Im sure that we could fake it when
Its time to say how much it meant
And we walk out so innocent
You can be so persuasive
When you say its more than a day trip
And convince me Im condescending
When I ask Will this be ending
How quickly lust can pretend it's love
Were just the boys and girls
That think they always know
With answers for the world
The ambiguity shows

Were just the boys and girls
That dance with all their clothes
Hiding under the sheets
Believing nobody knows
All the suspense that we've created
Now its wasted and we cant change it
The beginning to the ending
I find myself remembering
How quickly lust can pretend it's love
Designing words to help us believe
Its so much more than just tonight
So we have got to get this right

How quickly words can become our hands

Designing everything we believe more


Were just the boys and girls
That think they always know
With answers for the world
The ambiguity shows

Were just the boys and girls
That dance with all their clothes
Hiding under the sheets
Believing nobody knows
You could be the one to stay
Made from birth for just this day
But something tells me its not right
That we could lose it all tonight
Im no better on my own
Leave the message on your phone
Always trying what I can
To be a child and not a man

Were just the boys and girls
That think they always know
With answers for the world
The ambiguity shows

Were just the boys and girls
That dance with all their clothes
Hiding under the sheets
Believing nobody knows
My hands across your clothes

And me with all the plans

To keep us boys and girls

Another woman and man
 <start> Any other time and any other place
You and me would be so easy
But when you lay me down in your warm embrace
I should feel much more than empty
And god knows you deserve better
And god knows I'm watching you slip away
When you say
Why'd you put on the brakes
You say it's only love only love
Why'd you put on the brakes
It's only love only love
Waiting on our hearts I wish I had to give
You're wide awake while I'm sleep walking
Try and understand I don't wanna close the door
The storm rolls in there's no one and
God knows you deserve better
And god knows I could use a little faith
When you say you say
Why'd you put on the brakes
You say it's only love only love
Why'd you put on the brakes
It's only love only love
It's only love only love
Why'd you put on the breaks
It's only love only love
Isn't love isn't love isn't love
If your heart's not in it
No if your heart's not in it
Gotta walk away
Why'd you put on the brakes
Why'd you put on the brakes
Why'd you put on the brakes
It's only love only love
Why'd you put on the brakes
It's only love only love <start> as i went down to the river to pray studying about that good old way and who shall were the sorry crown good lord show me the way <start> One two three four
You love me through to time
And I don't even know who you are
I know you're probably heading this group
But now that you tell me with you
You say that it's unfruitful
To sit here and daydream
But I sure know what I'm hearing
Is as good as you seem
You say it's unfruitful
To sit here and daydream
But I sure know what you give
Is as good as you seem
The police put down who he says
And throw me a ringer
Why should I follow diplomacy
Your traveling little show
You say that it's unfruitful
Laying down and daydreaming
But I swear you another world of
As good as I've ever seen
You say that it's unfruitful
To sit here and daydream
But I should not hear
It as your life seems so grim
I only get to see you once or twice a year
Just about too many years and you came around here
Why do you think this girl's stupid
Why do you dream I doubt it
The sob broke initially
What else is there What can you do about it
Talkin' to me invade my thoughts
You just don't ever know
I like you but you're far away
In the school where it really shows
You're talkin' to me feed my thoughts
With a grace I need show
I guess this is how it's going to be
I like you and you won't know
You did great
Thanks <start> LOVER TO LOVER

Tell me is there something that I should know
Are we wasting time have nowhere to go
Why do we say that everything's all right We'll take the tears
Those wasted nights sit without a sound
Inside our world that it's breaking down we lie there
Lover to lover face to face tearing apart all that we made
Thinking each other's the one to blame lover to lover there's nothing  gain
Give me something back so we can hold on
And keep it together we must stay strong
Did we let go as time moved on oh the same old line
The lights go out lying wide awake
The words don't come how much will it take we lie there
Lover to lover face to face tearing apart all that we made
Thinking each other's the one to blame lover to lover there's nothing  gain
No one could take away that feeling
Lost in our world we found a dream worth building
Oh and all of it felt so right so much of life to live oh oh oh
Whoa oh lover to lover face to face tearing apart all that we made
Thinking each other's the one to blame lover to lover there's nothing  gain
Whoa oh lover to lover face to face tearing apart all that we made
Thinking each other's the one to blame lover to lover there's nothing  gain
Lover to lover face to face tearing apart all that we made
Thinking each other's the one to blame lover to lover <start> Oh my name it ain't nothin'
My age it means less
The country I come from
Is called the Midwest
I was taught and brought up there
The laws to abide
And that land that I live in
Has God on its side
Oh the history books tell it
They tell it so well
The cavalries charged
The Indians fell
The cavalries charged
The Indians died
Oh the country was young
With God on its side
The SpanishAmerican
War had its day
And the Civil War too
Was soon laid away
And the names of the heroes
I was made to memorize
With guns in their hands
And God on their side
The First World War boys
It came and it went
The reason for fighting
I never did get
But I learned to accept it
Accept it with pride
For you don't count the dead
When God's on your side
The Second World War
Came to an end
We forgave the Germans
And then we were friends
Though they murdered six million
In the ovens they fried
The Germans now too
Have God on their side
I've learned to hate the Russians
All through my whole life
If another war comes
It's them we must fight
To hate them and fear them
To run and to hide
And accept it all bravely
With God on my side
But now we got weapons
Of chemical dust
If fire them we're forced to
Then fire them we must
One push of the button
And a shot the world wide
And you never ask questions
When God's on your side
Through many a dark hour
I've been thinkin' about this
That Jesus Christ was
Betrayed by a kiss
But I can't think for you
You'll have to decide
Whether Judas Iscariot
Had God on his side.
So now as I'm leavin'
I'm weary as Hell
The confusion I'm feelin'
Ain't no tongue can tell
The words fill my head
And fall to the floor
That if God's on our side
He'll stop the next war <start> We rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin
We rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin

what do you think about Jesus he's alright
what do you think about Jesus he's alright

Jesus came from heaven for us all
to save the sin sick and the lost
love is what was needed to set the captives free
whom the Son sets free is truly free indeed

he's the Alfa and Omega wonderful savior
eternal Christ lamb of God the only creator
the beginning and the end take away all sin
Almighty God everlasting King he's a wonderful friend

what do you think about Jesus he's alright
what do you think about Jesus he's alright

Jesus is my shelter in the time of storm
he is my deliverer protects me from all harm
when i feel discouraged he's there to pick me up
i don't ever have to worry cause there's safety in his love

he's the Alfa and Omega wonderful savior
eternal Christ lamb of God the only creator
the beginning and the end take away all sin
Almighty God everlasting King he's a wonderful friend

what do you think about Jesus he's alright
what do you think about Jesus he's alright <start> No hands on the wheel
Nothing can touch you
When you can't even feel
No one you can trust
Cause no one's for real
No one's for real
Father forget us
Or father forgive us
Giving us faith
And then calling us sinners
Mixing up the losers
With all of the winners
Tonight yeah yeah yeah
Chorus
Kneeling at the crossroads
All my bridges burning
Down the river my life flows
Took another wrong turning
Knows what she feels
But he's never felt her
Wanted a home
But he needed shelter
Never gonna win
With the hand he dealt her
Aces low tonight
Yeah yeah yeah
Chorus
I will find youi know you only want to share my pain
But I've got something weird
Pumping through my veins
Got the type of blood
That can't be changed
Can't be changed
Chorus <start> Well down in New Orleans at the Golden Goose
I grabbed a greeneyed dolly that was on the loose
Well I dig that music well she said me too
I said pretty baby come on and let's do
The Dixieland Rock
Well the Dixieland Rock
Let your hair down Sugarshake it free
And do the Dixieland Rock with me
With the blue light shining on her swinging hips
She got the drummer so nervous that he lost his sticks
The cornet player hit a note that's flat
The tromboner hit him while the poor cat sat
The Dixieland Rock
Well the Dixieland Rock
Let your hair down Sugarshake it free
And do the Dixieland rock with me
I was all pooped out and when the clock struck four
But she said no daddy can't leave the floor
She wore a clinging dress that fit so tight
She couldn't sit down so we danced all night
The Dixieland Rock
Well the Dixieland Rock
Let your hair down Sugarshake it free
And do the Dixieland Rock with me
Let your hair down Sugarshake it
And do the Dixieland Rock with me <start> When I crossed my fingers
You crossed your heart
Where there's a tattoo of Jesus
And Cupid shooting his dart
All covered and colorful
Stories and stars
You bet I go crazy
An odyssey blazing
With daggers and fire
Uh oh oh whoa
Chorus
You're incurable for me
And yet you mock me easily
But not for the naked eye
To see

I say we rob from the rich
And blow down the door.
On to the next
To dance with the poor.
Jump on my shoulders.
You can jump on my shoulders.
We rob from the rich
And blow down the door.
On to the next
To dance with the poor.
Jump on my shoulders.
You can jump on my shoulders.
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
Everybody it's OK if
You're mad at what I'm saying.
Make peace baby shake my hand 'cause
I'm pretty sure I'm staying. Oh
What to do oh
Look at you when the walls begin
To crumble.
It's a mad man with a mad plan
And he waits for us to stumble.
Oh but our eyes are open
Yeah they're really open

I say we rob from the rich
And blow down the door.
On to the next
To dance with the poor.
Jump on my shoulders.
You can jump on my shoulders.
We rob from the rich
And blow down the door.
On to the next
To dance with the poor.
Jump on my shoulders.
You can jump on my shoulders.
La la la la la la la la

I'll say the devils lost control
Live in the water
I'm scared of the city
Stay in the water
I'm scared of the city
Live in the water
I'm scared of the city.
I'm scared of the city
Live in the water
I'm scared of the city
I'll pray for you
I say we rob from the rich
And blow down the door.
On to the next
To dance with the poor.
Jump on my shoulders.
You can jump on my shoulders.
We rob from the rich
And blow down the door.
On to the next
To dance with the poor.
Jump on my shoulders.
You can jump on my shoulders.
Seriously
It's not supposed to be easy
That's why it feels so fucking good.
Jump on my shoulders yeah. <start> I don't know when it all began to simmer down
But suddenly I don't want you around
And I'm sitting here.
I'm drowning in the worry and the fear
Cause I am starting to forget now
It disappears so fast
I'm waiting for the question to be asked
And if you saw me now you'd not be disappointed.
Some how I've gotten to the point
I'm not ever comin back.
My minds made up I'm stayin' clear as long as it has taken
Chorus
To get close to you
I want to get close to you and I need more time
I want to get close to you
I just want to get close to you and I'm not sure why.
Sometimes I I get up in the morning so surprised
Yeah it takes me some time to realize
That lately I lately I have really wished that you were still around
Here to pick me up off of the ground
Cause I am starting to forget now
It disappears so fast I'm waiting for the question to be asked
And if you saw me now you'd not be disappointed.
Some how I've gotten to the point
I'm not ever comin back.
My minds made up I'm stayin' clear as long as it has taken
Chorus
I'm losin' it whoa whoa whoa
You make me sick whoa whoa whoa
My minds made up I'm stayin clear as long as it has taken
Chorus <start> Flying o'r the sea
My guitar and me.
Thirty thousand feet
What a brilliant feat.
Go west don't go east
A famine or a feast.
We're treated better there
A homeless one is rare.
I feel
The city's lure.
The apple of my eye
I cherish her.
Everybody's here
From all across the earth
Tongues and tribes galore
There isn't any war. <start> I wake up it's dark
It's cold but I'm not freezing
I don't know where I am don't know how I came here
I try to get up but I'm paralyzed
The last snow is melting it's march
It's always cold in march isn't it
I'm trying hard to remember
What happened yesterday or was it the day before
I see blood beside me and on my hands
I see your face
It's raining heavier and life is coming back to my body
I try to find the moon but it's too cloudy
I try to move  and I can move
I try to make out where I am
There's a lake with silent waves and there are trees
I see your body with dislocated limbs
And I see your face
My shivering hands vainly try to touch your face
Something holds me back approaching your face...
Your eyes are open are you crying
But these tears are rainwater filling your eyes
You don't move you don't answer you don't react at all
It smells like burnt rubber I see a car
And I remember it was ours
And now the fog is clearing
Very slowly I begin to understand
Begin to understand
We wanted to end our lives
Of sorrows and agony
We wanted to escape
And now you're dead
Now you're dead and I'm alive
Why do I live when you're dead
Why should I live when you're dead <start> We don't talk like we used to.
The perfect present is no longer the future.
And I can't find it trust me I looked around.
Seems like all the sand is at the bottom now.
We gotta know know when to fight know when to hold and when to let it go.
I hope we survive because it's passing by
I won't be surprised if it all up and blows.
Time time time  time time time time 
Time time time  time time time time 
We are the shore the wave is rising
We are the dust made out of diamonds
When metal rusts we are all drowning
Island of man we are surrounded
We gotta know know when to fight know when to hold and when to let it go.
I hope we survive because it's passing by
I won't be surprised if it all up and blows.
Time time time  time time time time 
Time  time time time time time time 
Make a little love make a little war tell me how it feels dreaming without a future
Have a little laugh have a little cry each moment gets us closer to saying goodbye
Make a little love make a little war tell me how it feels dreaming without a future
Have a little laugh have a little cry each moment gets us closer to saying goodbye
Big hand keeps getting closer to the little hand all good things come to an end and turn around again
The big hand keeps getting closer to the little hand all good things come to an end
We gotta know know when to fight know when to hold and when to let it go.
I hope we survive because it's passing by
I won't be surprised if it all up and blows.
Time time time  time time time time 
Time time time  time time time time 
Time time time  time time time time 
Time  time time time time time time 
I wish we could rewind
 Repeat x
 Repeat x <start> Day
Has begun
And I stumble
To the front
There's no
Real control
Of a random
Event
And I will take my chances
Cause anything can happen
I don't believe it's over
Cause anything can happen
I could never
Give it up
I could never relent
And I can't
Wait to see
What will happen
To me next
I will take my chances
Cause anything can happen
I don't believe it's over
Cause anything can happen
It doesn't matter
What we did wrong
Makes no difference
To me
I see the light in your eyes
And you're dancing free
And I'm coming down today
To gather in the pieces
Give in to the mystery
And I will take my chances
Cause anything can happen
Don't believe it's over
Cause anything can happen
One day I
Someday I
Anything can happen
Yeah anything can happen
I will make it shine
I will make it rain sometime <start> Blaze the night lift the stake
'Cause your world is broken
Everything's on the floor
Whenever the word is spoken
Lonely bed your awake
Falling asleep your hoping
Faith will come through the door
Open up 'cause there's still time
If you closed your eyes
If you took a breath
When the knife is on the ground
If you feel erased
When he's in this place
Then your life it will be found
You will fall to your knees
It's a tragic sickness
Just a step to the grave
Walk to the other side
Your a slave when your free
'Cause the remedy says
You will never be saved
Open up 'cause there's still time
If you closed your eyes
If you took a breath
When the knife is on the ground
If you feel erased
When he's in this place
Then your life it will be found
Lights fall it's clear
Your words are here
If you closed your eyes
If you took a breath
When the knife is on the ground
If you feel erased
When he's in this place
Then your life it will be found
Motion started breathing wanted
Close your eyes
Motion started breathing wanted
Close your eyes
Motion started breathing wanted
Close your eyes
Motion started breathing wanted
If you closed your eyes
Open up open up
Open up 'cause there's still time
Open up 'cause there's still time <start> Look the sun is rising I can taste the end.
Wake up my sleepwalkers it's time for you to scatter.
The kiss of death fresh on his lips
the enemy brings his best.
Yes I will submit I'll bend before you now.
Hit me again I know who I am.
Hit me again the power is mine.
Hit me again my blood's not my own.
Where are your nails now
Salty sweat stings my wounds
burning with the heat of your hate.
Wounded for your transgressions I lift up the weight.
I carry death to the altar
and I sacrifice myself <start> The millionaires are closing ranks
Taxdodging in the race to the bank
Listen for the slamming of the stable doors
After the horse has bolted
Trapped fingers and someone's to blame
The Jockey Club is tightening the reins
All the wealth and power
Owned by a handful of people
With YTS workers
In the starstudded stables
I have no sympathy for the Inland Revenue
But Lester Piggot I'm glad they caught you <start> Stay away from the future
Back away from the light
It's all deranged  no control
Sit tight in your corner
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control
If I could control tomorrow's haze
The darkened shore wouldn't bother me
If I can't control the web we weave
My life will be lost in the fallen leaves
Every single move's uncertain
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control
I should live my life on bended knee
If I can't control my destiny
You've gotta have a scheme
You've gotta have a plan
In the world of today for tomorrow's man
No control
Stay away from the future
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control
Forbidden words deafen me
In memory no control
See how far a sinful man
Burns his tracks his bloody robes
You've gotta have a scheme
You've gotta have a plan
In the world of today for tomorrow's man
I should live my life on bended knee
If I can't control my destiny
No control I can't believe I've no control
It's all deranged
I can't believe I've no control
It's all deranged
Deranged

I never thought and i never dreamed he'd have blue eyes and blue jeans
He must have tapped my telephone line. He must have knownI'd bespending my time alone <start> Why are the world's biggest sinners
Always saints when they're gone
It's all about losers and winners
Not about who's right and who is wrong
Who's the thief who's the traitor
Who's the one to save the day
And who will be in the spotlight
While the good ones fade away
Yes I realize it's just a fact of life
Nothing's ever really free
And if I have to I will gladly pay the price
We can't escape our destiny
It's the curse of being good
The curse of doing right
It's the curse of being good
The curse of doing right
The price we pay for our honour
No more Mr Nice Guy
No more Mr Right
Should I be like all the others
Should I give up the good fight
This neverending struggle
Has been part of me so long
Is it a curse is it a blessing
We know who's right who is wrong
I'm not complaining this is how I lived my life
I keep my pride my dignity
And if I have to I will gladly pay the price
You can't cheat your destiny
It's the curse of being good
The curse of doing right
It's the curse of being good
The curse of doing right
The price we pay for our honour
Yes I realize it's just a fact of life
Nothing's ever really free
And if I have to I will gladly pay the price
You can't cheat your destiny
It's the curse of being good
The curse of doing right
It's the curse of being good
The curse of doing right
The price we pay for our honour
It's the curse of being good
The curse of doing right <start> I was born the son of a car shark
With a deck in my hand
I'm the best at playing the game
I'm known throughout the land
At the tables you'll find me
A stack of chips by my side
Poker Gin or 
A wining hand is my pride
Just cut the pack
I'll take the oneeyed Jack
There's no holding back
I call your bluff
It ain't no crime
Winning all the time
The money's on the line
I play for blood
I'm the five card stud
Don't try to con me
Let's get it understood
You'll never get one past me
I know every trick in the book
I'll play you double or nothing
If you think you're so good
Lets go for broke
Afraid you're gonna choke
Got one slim hope
That ain't enough
Well you're outta luck
Lost your bottom buck
I hit a royal flush
And I smell blood
I'm the five card stud <start> For all time
Looking for something to remind me
Something out the corner of my eye
Why can't I feel it
Why should I try
Bump into a stranger
But that stranger is strangely familiar
How could I let it slip by
Why can't I feel it
Can you tell me why
When I nearly had the connection sussed
It slips right off my tongue
And timing is off things get jumbled up
In a fever when you are young
But I know who's in there behind those eyes
So say goodbye
There can never be an ending
We are endless like the sky
Why can't I feel it
Is it just a lie
Why can't I feel it
For all time <start> I've been keepin' my eyes on you
I finally found the nerve to talk to you
There's something that you ought to know
Don't you know that I love you so
Our life together could be eternal bliss
If we could just get close enough to kiss
And you know I'd like to get a crack at your love
Crack at your love
Crack at your love
You make me feel so warm inside
A sense of humor you can't hide
Who taught you darlin' how to move that way
And when you smile I know the world's okay
And when I see the twinkle in your eye
It sends my heart all the way to the sky
And you know I'd like to get a crack at your love
Crack at your love
Crack at your love
Lonely nights lonely days
Lonely nights lonely days
I'm reachin' out for you
In my mind in my mind
I'm goin' crazy now would you be my baby
I'm gonna need a little help from above
Would you say no if I asked for your love
I can't afford to get hurt again
Like the time I remember when
But I know I'd like to get a crack at your
And you know I'd like to get a crack at your
Don't you know I'd like to get a crack at your love
Crack at your love
Crack at your love
Crack at your love
Crack at your love
Crack at your love
Crack at your love
Crack at your love <start> Some things never change
Hang your head
I saw the news today o boy
A thousand stories that we've seen before
Small minds play at some big time games
And everybody else pays
Make no mistake they're on the take
They like to keep it that way
Some things never change
I saw the light today o boy
It come on flashing bright in red and blue
The man steps in with a terminal grin
Blue skies turn to grey
Young men die and children cry
Why is it always the same
Life must be eaten
Or at least bitten into
To get past the surface
The moment of truth
You know when its right
Its sweet deep inside
Its real and its better
That some things don't change
I saw the news today o boy
A thousand pictures of the lies we live
Small minds play at some big time games
And everybody else pays
They're on the take and they don't give breaks
They like to take it away
Some things never change
Hang your head <start> Love is higher than a mountain
Love is thicker than water
You are this dreamers only dream
Heaven's angel devil's daughter
Say my mind should I go with her on silent nights
She'll drive me crazy in the end
And I should leave this paradise
But I can't leave her
while I need her more than she needs you
That's what I'm living for
Love is higher than a mountain
Love is thicker than water
You are this dreamers only dream
Heaven's angel devil's daughter
Say my thought should I find out she don't care at all
She'll leave me crying in the end
Wandering through the afterglow
But I can't leave her
While I need her more than she needs you
That's what I'm praying for
Love is higher than a mountain
Love is thicker than water
You are this dreamers only dream
Heaven's angel devil's daughter
Love is higher than a mountain
Love is thicker than water
You are this dreamers only dream
Heaven's angel devil's daughter

And sure enough the walls of the prison did rever berate with all sorts of screamin' sounds as lawyers and execs and promo per sonages all decide to jump on joe for a spectacular high speed ga
Ng leading to... <start> I'm much wiser now
A lifetime of memories run through my head
They taught me how
For better or worse alive or dead
I realize there's no turning back
Life goes on the off beaten track
I sit down with my son
Set to see the crimson sunset
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may
Many years have come and gone
I've lived my life but now must move on
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may
He's my only one now that my time has come
Now that my life is done we look into the sun
Seize the day and don't you cry
Now it's time to say goodbye
Even though I'll be gone
I will live on live on <start> Instrumental <start> Take the river to the highest mountain
Take the ocean to the farthest sea
I'd take back everything I've said to hurt you
If you'd come back to me
I'd bring you fire from the frozen waters
Leave a flower 'neath a fallen tree
I'd take back everything I said to scare you
Away from me
Two hands can feel so much more
That's what I'm loving you for
I was too blind to see fear was inside of me
I'm not afraid anymore
Chorus
It's never too late it's never too late
To forgive and forget
Tell me that it isn't over tell me that it isn't over
I'll never hold you again
If a broken wing can still be mended
Then a foolish heart can still be true
Take the river to the highest mountain
That's where I'll wait for you
Two hearts can feel so much more
That's what I'm loving you for
The man that you tried to free
Is still locked inside of me
And your heart must open the door
Chorus <start> Say you're
One man's taste
Want what Fall and break
We've seen the dream folks
In our day
What
Fought the Father the Pope
Finally sent away
Warden
Lock it
Free love's
Fought our battles through the day
We were full on idle
A lot of them say
Obey
Your colorist
Bleach it all away
Free reign
Good rest
Break
Every brunette in the way
We were full on idle
A lot of them say
Obey
Your violence
It's kinda late
Say You're
One man's date
Want what
Fall and break
We were full on idle
A lot of them say
Obey your violence
Look close
Hate
Tide all white
Row
On the glass surf
He pulled the paddle
It's okay with me
What I'd like to do
With your violin
And it's bow <start> Burn the shops oh don't think it over
Kill the cops oh don't think it over
Steal the lot oh don't think it over
Let's show 'em what we got
In this lawless country we run free and we are jolly
We have no long term depression instead we have revenge
A man in black apparently killed my uncle's uncle
That's what I heard from some itinerant kid
So we send down a band of happy brothers
And they burned him till he could no longer beg
This is real democracy this is what the people want
Put your feelings into action a statement of intent
We speak clearly
You will know just what we meant
Revenge
We'll smash the parking meters so the lawyers won't defeat us
They held us slave to taxes we've come to grind our axes
At the customer service center they're trying to drive us mental
Let's take it back to fundamentals
This is real democracy this is what the people want
Put your feelings into action no paperwork distraction
We speak clearly
You will know just what we meant
Revenge
You won't believe your eyes
No more diplomatic lies
No intermediary body working to fudge one eye for a eye
C'mon
Its there in the window that thing you've always wanted
Just take it
Burn the shops oh don't think it over
Kill the cops oh don't think it over
Steal the lot oh don't think it over
Let's show 'em what we've got
This is real democracy this is what the people want
Put your feelings into action a statement of intent
We speak clearly
You will know just what we meant
Revenge <start> I am trying to be heroic in an age of modernity
I am trying to be heroic because all around me history sings
So I enjoyed and I devoured flesh and wine and luxury
But in my heart I am lukewarm nothing ever really touches me
At Les Trois Garons
We meet at precisely
 o'clock.
I order the foie gras and I eat it with complete disdain
Bubbles rise in champagne flutes
But when we kiss I feel nothing
Feasting on sleeping pills and Marlboro Reds

Oho How our how our parents they suffered for nothing
Live the dream live the dream live the dream
Like the 's never happened
People are afraid are afraid
To merge on the freeway
Disappear here
Stroll the pier
Into the magazine launch party
I am handed a pill and I swallow with complete disdain
Kickdrum bangs off the highhat remembered to look bored
We suck each others' faces and make sure we are noticed

Because East London is a vampire
It sucks the joy right out of me
How we look for corruption in these golden years
Oho How our how our parents they suffered for nothing
Live the dream live the dream live the dream
Like the 's never happened
People are afraid are afraid
To merge on the freeway
Disappear here.
Disappear here.
Disappear here.
Disappear here.
Disappear here. <start> This war is cold and silent
Our love has turned to violence
You've got three years to live for something
You've got three years to die for something
This war is warm and vibrant
Our love has turned to silence
You've got two months to tell him something
You've got two months to tell him something
And if you love let him know
Or if you leave him tell him so
Or you will break his heart in two <start> You can never understand me.
'Cause I I felt this in my...
I felt this in my soul.
You never made an understanding.
'Cause I I felt this in my...
I felt this in my soul.
This this never meant shit to you.
I could prove that.
My my moist eyes..
You broke a sweat and I belong here.
You can never understand me.
'Cause I I felt this in my...
I felt this in my soul.
You never made an understanding.
'Cause I I felt this in my...
I felt this in my soul.
This never meant shit to you.
I could prove that.
My my moist eyes..
You broke a sweat and I belong here.
I belong here now.
You took my hand and led me wrong
Now I'm back and I'm sad.
And I... I wanna know why.
It's always on my mind I can't get it out..
I wake up at night in my bed and its on my mind.
It's always on my mind.
And I can't get it out. <start> There's a road ahead
Past a stormy sea
There I will return
That's just what you mean to me
'Neath a darkening sky
Where no soul is free
There my lover lies
That's just what you mean to me
Just exactly what you mean to me
What you mean to me
Just exactly what you mean to me
Have no need for fate
I've got destiny
All things come to pass
That's just what you mean to me
Just exactly what you mean to me
What you mean to me
Just exactly what you mean to me
I contemplate every moment
Let's make history
Tired of sharing my loneliness alone
That's just what you mean to me
Just exactly what you mean to me
Someday soon you'll know
One day soon you'll see
Why I sing this song
That's just what you mean to me
Just exactly what you mean to me
What you mean to me
Just exactly what you mean to me
This whole crazy world
Don't amount to more than a hill of beans
Tired of sharing my loneliness alone I wanna live my dreams
I contemplate every moment
Let's make history
It's time now to be the future
That's just what you mean to me
Just exactly what you mean to me
What you mean to me
Just exactly what you mean to me
It's time now to be the future
Let's make history <start> And when the day ends I'm sure she feels sorrow
The lonely guy I am I wait for her change
I've been here two days I'll sure be here tomorrow
I'd eat her out if she were on my dinner plate
Chorus

I wish she'd be more kind now
I'm out of luck 'cause the shades are pulled down
I've seen everything there is to be shown
I followed her all the way home
I can't be too cool in a tree with my pants down
The air is cold and I've got splinters in my feet
She caught me once but I don't think that she cares now
Unlike before her view is now blocked by a leaf
Chorus
I bet this last time's the one time too many
The rush of waiting is burning through my head
Right after supper her brother shower's twice a week
He kicks my ass so much that filthy white inbred
I've made mistakes by looking in the wrong window
Her dad is big and I've never seen his face
I've been here two days and I'll sure be here tomorrow
My lady's so sweet she likes to entertain
Chorus
I bet this last time's the one time too many
The rush of waiting is burning through my head
Right after supper her brother shower's twice a week
He kicks my ass so much that filthy white inbred
 <start> Dance with your feet so light
Watch her toes God bless her might
Carved in a bloody show
Welcome to the world unknown
Pleased to meet you my name is Angie
Can I shake your hand
Coming through you nature commands me
And woman carries all of man give it all you can
Tamed by a cruel white light
Screaming blue going pink tonight
One more beginning told
Welcome to the world unknown
Pleased to meet you my name is Angie
Can I shake your hand
Yeah coming through you nature commands me
And woman carries all of man
Welcome to the world unknown
Yeah the world unknown
Dance with your feet so light
Watch her toes God bless her might
I saw it was carved in a bloody show
Welcome to the world unknown <start> Come into bed switch off the light
Close your eyes sleep tonight
Think of all the things we did today
You touch me then we fall apart
I lose control the hardest part
I wish that it could be another way
Huuaa
Losing I'm losing I'm losing my miind
Ruining I'm ruining you're ruining my miind
You cut me deep like broken glass
I wonder when this time will pass
Or will I fall asunder everyday
Sitting here beside the fire
The flames they grow just like desire
Will I fall asunder everyday
Huuaa
Losing I'm losing I'm losing my miind
Ruining I'm ruining you're ruining my miind <start> I'm tired Lord and I'm drawn
And I'm chilled right to the bone
I crawled home from my work
And this note said she was gone
Said your dinner's in the cat
And your love is out the door
I'm goin' back to my momma
And I don't want you no more no more
She said she don't want me no more
She's gone back to her momma
Said she's never never comin' back no more
Now a man can take so much
And only heaven knows his limit
But a naggin' bitchin' woman
Digs a hole and puts him in it
A sophisticated man
Needs a little something on the side
So what you don't get at home
You've gotta get outside hey
She's gone
I'm spending all of my money
She's gone gone gone
And I can swing with my honey
She's gone
I'm so glad my woman's gone
Now time goes marching on
And it won't wait for you
You've gotta take it when it's offered
And get it when it's due
Now a man can move much faster
Without a millstone around his neck
So if you get the chance to lose it
You've gotta drop it and run like heck hey
She's gone
I'm spending all of my money
She's gone gone gone
And I can swing with my honey
She's gone
I'm so glad my woman's gone
She's gone
I'm spending all of my money
She's gone gone gone
And I can swing with my honey
She's gone
I'm so glad my woman's gone <start> london streets burning

the system is broken and soon you'll be turning on
the future is at war with something it can't recall

I'm telling you it's alright

Eyes cast like steel
I drank the wine that they left on my table
I knew the morning was too far
I smoked my last cigarette
I stay only to get by
The night was dark and the land was cold
I was frozen right to the bone
Just like fire would
I burn up
Just like fire would
Just like fire would
I burn up oh
Five hundred miles I have gone today
Tomorrow it's five hundred more
Outside my window the world passes by
Its stranger than a dream
Just like fire would
I burn up
Just like fire would
Just like fire would
I burn up
I go to work and I earn my pay lord
My sweat falls to the ground
I see you now but we may never meet again child
The ice is hanging on the door
One night in a motel room
Eyes cast like steel
I drank the wine that they left on my table
Knew the morning was too far
Just like fire would
I burn up
Just like fire would
Just like fire would
I burn up
Just like fire would

Just like fire would
Just like fire would
I burn up <start> I wanna sing like I'm driving in the car all by myself
I wanna dance like I just won the lottery
I wanna lift my hands and spin around
I wanna throw my head back and shout
Like a prisoner who's just found out he's free
I will give my everything
I'll be a fool for You
Because I am in love with You
I wanna sing and shout
I wanna dance around
I wanna forget who I used to be
And embrace Your truth
So when I sing and shout
Or when I dance around
When I lay my pride down
It's all for You it's all for You
I wanna live learning how to make my life a sacrifice
I wanna die to find my true identity
I wanna answer at Your beckon call
Wanna do my best and give my all
I wanna hold on to You and let go of me
So let me give my everything
I'll be a fool for You
Because I am in love with You
I wanna sing and shout
I wanna dance around
I wanna forget who I used to be
And embrace Your truth
So when I sing and shout
Or when I dance around
When I lay my pride down
It's all for You
With sweet success already gained
Self righteousness is not my aim
I'm raised from death into Your life so free
Not on my own but by Your grace
I'm gazing long into Your face
And I can't keep this passion bottled up inside of me
I wanna sing and shout
I wanna dance around
I wanna forget who I used to be
And embrace Your truth
So when I sing and shout
Or when I dance around
When I lay my pride down
It's all for You
Sing and shout
It's all for You
Dance around
It's all for You
Sing and shout
It's all for You
Dance around

Wind tearin' through the backstreet I hear the rhythm of my heart beat
Rain blowin' to my face I'm tired of being in the wrong place.
Blues knockin' on my back door I can't jump from the second floor
Turn up the radio higher and higher rock and roll music set my ears on fire.
When I was stone blue rock and roll sure helped me through.

Laid off work and I can't be free I need some rock 'n' roll therapy.
Put on a  and let the needle ride jukebox jumps and I'll be satisfied.

She's eternal spotless on the mind
Sun burnt on a battlefield
Walking on the Mason Dixon line
Soaking in a burned up journal
Couple entries cut me down to size
I could see the story ending
Already written in her eyes
Don't fall asleep
Don't fall asleep tonight
Don't fall asleep
Don't fall asleep
So I buried my convictions so deep
Had to leave a map to get back home
Rebel with a fear of flying
It's time to try a new time zone
And the coast of Marseilles calling
Late at night I hear it in the wind
In my dream I'm always falling
She asks me if I'm coming in
Don't fall asleep
Don't fall asleep tonight
Don't fall asleep
Don't fall asleep tonight
Don't fall asleep
Don't fall asleep tonight
Don't fall asleep
Don't fall
I'll keep you warm
Someone to hold you if he won't
I'll keep you warm
Someone to hold you if he won't
I know you're so afraid
Of frozen notes and wet parades
I'll keep you warm
Just going through the normal changes
Just seeing what summer's gonna briong
If I had to do the whole thing over
I wouldn't change a single thing
Don't fall asleep
Don't fall asleep tonight
Don't fall asleep
Don't fall asleep tonight
Don't fall asleep
Don't fall asleep tonight
Don't fall asleep

Donovan
The continent of Atlantis was an island
which lay before the great flood
in the area we now call the Atlantic Ocean.
So great an area of land that from her western shores
those beautiful sailors journeyed
to the South and the North Americas with ease
in their ships with painted sails.
To the East Africa was a neighbour across a short strait of sea miles.
The great Egyptian age is but a remnant of The Atlantian culture.
The antediluvian kings colonised the world
All the Gods who play in the mythological dramas
In all legends from all lands were from fair Atlantis.
Knowing her fate Atlantis sent out ships to all corners of the Earth.
On board were the Twelve
The poet the physician the farmer the scientist
The magician and the other socalled Gods of our legends.
Though Gods they were 
And as the elders of our time choose to remain blind
Let us rejoice and let us sing and dance and ring in the new
Hail Atlantis

Way down below the ocean where I want to be she may be

Away we're bound away
Cross the wide Missouri <start> How can I explain to you
What I am going through
It's such a shame
And how could I have left that girl
I'd walk the world for her
I guess things change
It's not the same
When she cries she says my name
She knows her arms could hold me closer
Believes her love can dry the tears
Falling easy like rain
Why did she so easily
Fall so in love
That she could not let go
And why did I so carelessly
Let her mean more to me
Than all I know
I loved her so <start> May the path that I walk Be the path of righteousness
May the words from my mouth Give you praise
May my heart be Your home And a place of holiness
I worship You in love
I lift You lift You up

So what do I do right now
Give up and let it go
Need time to take it in
Lean back and breathe me out

So what do I do right now
Give up and let it go
Just like the other day
Need time to ride it out
Not going back again

Give up and let it go
Last stop on the bullet train

This time I'll make her scream
So what do I do right now
Give up and let it out

Lean back and breathe me out
Hell yeah do that again

Lean back and take me in

Not going back again
So what do I do right now
Just give me all or nothing
Thanks to Martin  for these lyrics <start> Now its time now its time
Unfolding right in front of us tonight
Your denial your denial
Kept folding all around my thoughts
But tonight
Suddenly its clear that is your life or mine
So why dont you let me just go and Ill be just fine
Wont you try
Wont you
This is time now its time
Folding all around
Ticking and shrinking and
Now its time now its time
Ill lie to hide my hands grabbing the knife
Terrified terrified
If you had know my hands grabbed on to the knife <start> I can not hang on to this bullshit forever
Can you
If you can that's up to you
We are so foolish
All this coolness can be fickle
Lacking in information
And I'm quickly loosing patience
I'm jaded just like you
And if you want me to
I'll show you all of my bank statements
Just got off the welfare payments
I'm not going back to having nothing
Just to make you happy
Just to make you happy
I don't want to be the one
Who tells you what you want to hear
I don't want to be the one
I don't want to be the one
Who tells you what you want to hear
I don't want to be the one
I do this for the love of it
While jealous people email bullshit
But it's okay
We get to play our songs
And we've done nothing wrong
So sit at your computer screen
Think of something safe and mean
'Cause I'm not going back
To having nothing
Just to make you happy
Just to make you happy
I don't want to be the one
Who tells you what you want to hear
I don't want to be the one
I don't want to be the one
Who tells you what you want to hear
I don't want to be the one
I can't believe that we can
Hang on to this bullshit forever
Together
I do this for the love of it
While jealous people email bullshit
But it's okay
We get to sing our songs
And we've done nothing wrong
So sit at your computer screen
Think of something safe and mean
'Cause I'm not going back to having nothing
Just to make you happy
Just to make you happy
I don't want to be the one
Who tells you what you want to hear
I don't want to be the one
I don't want to be the one
Who tells you what you want to hear
I don't want to be the one
Just to make you happy
Just to make you happy
Just to make you happy
Just to make you happy
Just to make you happy
Just to make you happy <start> LOLA

I want to take you out
I want to wine and dine youoo
I want to twist and twist and shout
I want you hard in my arms
So soft on my bed
You get the keys to my heart
When you wear that sweet dress

You're so physical physical for me
You're just too physical physical for me
I want your rough house baby
I want this night in your ear
Let me feel you danger
I want to make this feeling clear
I want the touch of your charms
The heat of your breath
I want to say all those things

That would be better unsaid <start> When I think of heaven 
I think of flying down into a sea of pens and feathers
and all other instruments of faith and sex and God
In the belly of a blackwinged bird
Don't try to feed me
I've been here before and I deserve a little more
I belong in the service of the Queen I belong anywhere but in between
She's been crying I've been thinking And I am the Rain King
Mama why am I so alone
I can't go outside
I'm scared I might not make it home
I'm alive but I'm sinking in
If there's anyone at home at your place
Why don't you invite me in
Don't try to bleed me
I've been there before and I deserve a little more
I belong in the service of the Queen
I belong anywhere but in between
She's been lying
I've been sinking
And I am the Rain King
Hey I only want the same as anyone
Henderson is waiting for the sun
Oh it seems night endlessly begins and ends
After all the dreaming I come home again...
When I think of heaven 
I think of dying Lay me down in a field of flame and heather
Render up my body into the burning heart of God in the belly of a blackwinged
bird
Don't try to bleed me
I've been here before and I deserve a little more
I belong in the service of the Queen
I belong anywhere but in between
She's been dying
I been drinking and I am the Rain King. <start> I should have learned my lesson
But what was I supposed to do
You brought a reputation
And I'm just not over you
Cause you let me fall
You let me fall so far
Uuuh
You had it all
Now I don't know where you are
Oo oo I've just about had it with you
I'm so sick of all your games
I don't know what I was thinking
Your just a bad habit and
and I've just about had it with you
I wish I left you alone
Never let you get close to me
I was so much better on my own
You're just a sad song I don't need
Cause you let me fall
you let me fall so far
Uuuh
You had it all
Now I don't know where you are
Oo oo I've just about had it with you
I'm so sick of all your games
I don't know what I was thinking
You're just a bad habit
and I've just about had it with you
Wooo I thought you were different
No you're all the same
Don't know what I was thinking
You're just a bad habit and
I've just about had it with you
And after all the wrongs
When it's all said and done
I should have seen this coming on
Should have known all along
Now the curtain's closed
We can all go home
Never make the same mistakes
It's almost over
Oo oo I've just about had it with you
I'm so sick of all your games
I don't know what I was thinking
You're just a bad habit
and I've just about had it with you
Wooo I thought you were different
No you're all the same
And now now I can see
You're just a bad habit and
I've just about had it with you
I've just about had it with you <start> Well the winter it came my love
And I did not know my own name
So I drove down that old country road
And the spirits conjured something
Grey clouds over storms did roll
And I searched for you in the cyclone
For my love I will bleed
And I drive till I set myself free
To land's end
Oh oh
To land's end
Oh oh
To land's end
Ask a soothsayer and old men wives
Where the witches burnt for all our lies
Past the motorways and city lights
That my soul be free and spirit fly
To land's end
Oh oh
To land's end
Oh oh
To land's end
To land's end <start> When the sun grows on your tongue
You won't want to stop him.
You're gonna die we're all gonna die
We won't want to stop him. <start> You say the same things every night to the same face every night
You wear the same clothes every night to the same plave every night
You're looking forward never looking back
Headed down a one way track
One for sorrow
Two for joy
We're going out tonight
We're going out tonight
We're going out tonight
Chorus
Everythings changing today
Getting further and further away
State you're in sink or swim
Plans you've made plans you've made
We've never made a difference but tonight it will be different
It's opened up in front of us and it can change for every one of us
I'll take a look into your private life
I'll take a look and I will make it mine
With the excitement of a child
We're going out tonight
We're going out tonight
We're going out tonight
Chorus
And you know that it's easy to get lost in these dark places
And you know that it's easy to get lost in these dark places
But you never ever know
Never ever know what you might find
Chorus <start> Yes she likes it
Yes she needs it
Yes she gives not
Now she's down ill
Yes she likes it
Yes she needs it
Yes she gives not
Now she's down ill
Now she sees she's oversized
Now she knows she'll overcome
Long last run to fight <start> There are men in shades just standing around
These bleeding stars the paradox
Let the eyes of god be our guide to find a gentle path
There's a broken record playing a tune
To the floating waves of the antennas
And you were just a little guy and I was little too
And everything is just floating freely
Just rocking around like a rocking horse
Just jiggling around like silly putty
And who are you and I
And you were looking at me smiling
The aliens were just arriving
Wherever they are headed next
Speaking secret tongues <start> When I was young
way back in Sicily
you should have seen me
My hair then was long
There was this one young man
who always came around
and gave me this ribbon of velvet brown
Waiting for Valentino
His dark eyes lock on mine
Waiting for Valentino
Then you did what you were told
Married a cousin I didn't know
He'd fallen in love with my photograph
Oh why worked harder then I could bare
and he never seemed to care
I bore his only son at the end of that year
There is a place I can slip away to
out in the desert of sand and dune
My she's tan she looks like a mirage
Someday I'll escape there like Scherazade
Waiting for Valentino
His dark eyes lock on mine
Waiting for Valentino
To carry me off through time
I had lived long as I can
Made three generations American
Now my daughter takes my hand
and whispers to me
There is a place I can slip away to
out in the desert of sand and dune
My she's tan she looks like a mirage
Someday I'll escape there like Scherazade
Waiting for Valentino
His dark eyes lock on mine
Waiting for Valentino
To carry me off through time
To carry me off through time
To carry me off through time
To carry me off through time <start> Deliver us from evil
We go with the flow
But here's a little secret
I think you ought to know
Providers and abusers
They know where to go
With Sunday refugees from Sunday TV shows
Downtown all of the way down
Downtown all of the way downtown
Let's sink imagination
Past your wildest wild

Go way below below below
Is it such a crime
The uptown can't teach you how to live
They don't have the time
Cuz where I'm gonna take you
Is a state of mine
Downtown all of the way down
Downtown all of the way downtown
Downtown all of the way down
Downtown all of the way downtown
You better learn to use your heart
You got to loose your money
You better use it all up
Coz you can't take it with you
When you're going down...
You'll never come home babe
You'll never come home baby
And you'll never be alone
All of the way downtown
All of the way...
Down
Down
Down
Downtown... <start>   
Walked in through the brass door
Of an unassuming bar
Bought a drink mixed around
Same routine so far
I saw her she saw me
Then she smiled openly
I sat too long
The chance was gone
But she didn't wait
Saw me hesitate
She drew right in
I'm in love I'm in love
I'm in love I'm in love
Said she'd seen to many
Mixed up scenes before
To ever think of love
Til tonight you walked in
I saw you you saw me
You got those things I've never seen
Said she knew I'd take all night to make a move
She had more in sight than being polite
I said me too
I'm in love I'm in love
I'm in love I'm in love
Oh baby what'cha do to me
Everything feels alright
I never knew it could be this way
Til we got lucky that night
I'm in you you're in me
Just one thought just one need
Then I knew what it was I had to do
Cause it came to me
That all I need in life is you
I'm in love I'm in love
I'm in love I'm in love
Love
I'm in love I'm in love
Love
I'm in love <start> I'm not the way that you found me
I'm never here or there
One day I'm happy and healthy
Next I ain't doing so well
Let's go walk to the border
Let's go walk along the inch
Let's go when no one can see us
And find the difference between us
You can cry like a baby
Just let me do what I need to
It might be to me or to you
Just let me do what I need to
I'm not the way that you found me
I'm neither here nor there
One day I'm happy and healthy
Next I ain't doing so well
Let's go walk to the border
Let's go walk along the inch
Let's go when no one can see us
And find the difference between us
I'm not the way that you found me
I'm neither here nor there
One day I'm happy and healthy
Next I ain't doing so well
Let's go walk to the border
Let's go walk along the inch
Let's go when no one can see us
And find the difference between us
You can cry like a baby
Just let me do what I need to
It might be to me or to you
Just let me do what I need to
I'm not the way that you found me
I'm neither here nor there
One day I'm happy and healthy
Next I ain't doing so well <start> We turned water into wine but that didn't last
We were the victims of our age
Now we live on different floors
And go our separate ways
And talk behind closed doors
We changed our world waiting for it all to end
It's such a shame but who's to blame
When two worlds drift apart
We used to sit around the fire
And whisper words the world outside would make no claim to hear
But now we talk an octave higher
In droning tones that don't relate at all to yester year
We changed our world waiting for it all to end
It's such a shame but who's to blame
When two worlds drift apart
Do you remember when we were seventeen
We took a boat out for an hour
But we preferred the greenery to the scenery of the sea
And tied up in some cozy cove
Till harbour lights appeared across the bay
Into love and out of mind
A poet claimed that loving you has only made me blind
But love is really crystal clear
It's only when you need someone the clouds will soon appear
We changed our world waiting for it all to end
It's such a shame but who's to blame
When two worlds drift apart <start> You wasted it you fell asleep
It was not late you missed the point
You wasted it you fell asleep
It was not late you missed the point
You wasted it you fell asleep
It was not late you missed the point
You thought that you could disappear
You thought it easier to be here
You thought that you could disappear
You thought it easier to be here
You wasted it you fell asleep
It was not late you missed the point

      <start> Thinking about last night
Can't remember the last time I cried that much Holding this pillow tight
Sitting here thinking what have I done
I hate to say you were my best mistake
It hurts to see you walk away
I can't ask you to stay
My pride won't let me do it But you captured me
And I could never show it 'cause I'm far too young
To say that you're the one But are you now
Are you now
I wanna know
For our love
Will you Wait
I believe we could have forever We can take our time together I'm really not ready for it
So will you Wait
For our love
Will you Wait
I believe we could have forever We can take our time together I'm really not ready for it
So will you Wait
Holding your hand so tight
I can almost feel it when you're not here Thinking I hear your voice
When I look around I find you're not there I hate to say you were my best mistake
I can't believe you walked away
I can't ask you to stay
My pride won't let me do it But you captured me
And I could never show it 'cause I'm far too young
To say that you're the one But are you now
Are you now
I wanna know
For our love
Will you Wait
I believe we could have forever We can take our time together I'm really not ready for it
So will you Wait
For our love
Will you Wait
I believe we could have forever We can take our time together I'm really not ready for it
So will you Wait
Tell me that you're waiting
Tell me that you'll stay
Tell me that you'll hold on
To the memories we made 'cause someday when I'm ready For the trouble we could make We could steal forever
So will you wait
For our love
Will you Wait
I believe we could have forever We can take our time together I'm really not ready for it
So will you Wait
For our love
Will you Wait
I believe we could have forever We can take our time together I'm really not ready for it
So will you Wait <start> Well it's knowing that your door is always open and your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to keep my sleeping bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch
And it's knowing I'm not shacked by forgotten words and bons
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you in the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind
It's not clinging to the rocks and I'd be planted on their columns now that binds me
Or something that somebody said because they thought we fit together walking
It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind
Though the wheet fields and the clothes lines
And the junk yards and the highways come between us
And some other woman cryin' to her mama cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And a summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walking on the back roads
By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind
I dipped my cup of soap back from a gurgling crackling caltron in some train yard
My beard a roughen coal pile and a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands round a tin can I pretend I hold you to my breast and find
That you're waving from the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry
Ever smiling ever gentle on my mind mhm <start> Y atrapado en mi mundo
Mgico trgico

Y que hay mucho trfico

Yo te lo como todo

Atrapado en dos notas
Gotas que se agotan
Sonidos que explotan

No me conformo con vivir

Porque este ritmo me llama <start> The lock upon my garden gate's a snail that's what it is.
The lock upon my garden gate's a snail that's what it is.
First there is a mountain then there is no mountain then there is.
First there is a mountain then there is no mountain then there is.
The caterpillar sheds his skin to find a butterfly within.
Caterpillar sheds his skin to find a butterfly within.
First there is a mountain then there is no mountain then there is.

Oh Wanita oh Wanita oh Wanita I call your name.
Oh the snow will be a blinding sight to see as it lies on yonder hillside.
The lock upon my garden gate's a snail that's what it is.

Ah mymy. <start> Everybody dance oh yeah
Crazy and a nighttime angel
She had a colorful career
Always doing it right
And her laugh was so original
Dealing with a lawless villain
He lacked discipline and mind
Always smoking the kind
And his thoughts were purely physical
c'mon yeah
Chorus
And now that dreams are nearing the conscious clearing
Crazy about your love
Another change of direction and the motivation
King and queen of the nighttime world
Working hard and pounding the pavement
She lacked discipline and mind
Always doing it right
And her love was so dependable
Oh yeah and then the villain came to terms with
All the wreckage of his past
He was loving his life
And his thoughts were beautiful and your beautiful
Lawless and Lulu
Lawless and Lulu
Lawless and Lulu
Lawless and Lulu <start> He met the world as a Dalmatian boy
Raised from a shaft at Moncton Hall
In a well oiled cage
That locked away his dreams
An  veteran face from the gallery
A ghost from the civil war in the family
He stood his ground on the picket line
Til all that he was left with
Were his fathers cough
And his mothers eyes
That would hold a tear
For the very first time
When the government took his job away
Now fist in hand hell stand in line
Declare his name and mark his time
To some the only proof that theyre alive
He could have been you
He could have been me
He could have been anybody
But he was born lucky
He made his first down payment
On a sharp Italian suit
He sewed razor blades into the lapels
See him sweating on the dance floor
Cool dust oozing out of every pore
A hard man with a hard life
And thats a story that hell tell you
Down at Easter Road till his throat is raw
On a Saturday he knows the score
Till the whistle blows and
The colors with their tempers fade away
He could have been you
He could have been me
He could have been anybody
But he was born lucky <start> In walking sleep and faded sight
In countless desperate steps
Trudging crossed a dead end world
Clawing to the depths
Competing on the treadmill
But grieving where they stand
An ordinary circumstance
An ordinary man
They gathered all possession found
They consummate their plans
Bleeding at their fingers
From digging with their hands
They all congratulate themselves
But nothing have they done
Their vessels lined up on the shelves
But empty every one
The point of no return
The closing of the door
The coldest days of Winter
The center of the storm
Before the dust has settled down
Before the spiral turns a twist
Before the numbers of your bank account
Are carved into your wrist
One by one we'll walk away
And watch the towers fall
Before the season old in Winter cold
Makes cretins of us all <start> Give it your all girl give it all ya got.
Take your chance at a second hand shot.
Say what you want girl
Do what you do.
He's never gonna gonna make it with you.
Pulling petals off a flower trying to get your way.
Keep pulling til' it says what you wanna say.
Girl you can pick a field full of daisies.
But he'd still be my baby.
I know you can hardly wait till I'm away from him.
Instinctively I know what you're thinking.
You'll be giving him an open invitation.
But my baby won't be taken in.
You can pout your cherry lips.
Try to tempt him with a sweet kiss.
You can flirt your pretty eyes.

You're the kind of girl that is always up for do or dare.
Only want him just because he's there.
Always looking for a new ride.
The grass is greener on the other side.
You're the kind of girl who's not use to hearing no.
All your lovers try to take you where you wanna go.
It doesn't matter how hard you try never gonna get with my guy.
No chains to unlock.

All the pleasure and pain
I'm still waiting for you
Lyrics Written By A. Wasiliev <start> Wanna pack your bags Something small
Take what you need and we disappear
Without a trace we'll be gone gone
The moon and the stars can follow the car
and then when we get to the ocean
We gonna take a boat to the end of the world
All the way to the end of the world
Oh and when the kids are old enough
We're gonna teach them to fly
You and me together we could do anything Baby
You and me together yes yes 
You and I we're not tied to the ground
Not falling but rising like rolling around
Eyes closed above the rooftops
Eyes closed we're gonna spin through the stars
Our arms wide as the sky
We gonna ride the blue all the way to the end of the world
To the end of the world
Oh and when the kids are old enough
We're gonna teach them to fly
You and me together we could do anything Baby
You and me together yes yes
We can always look back at what we did
All these memories of you and me baby
But right now it's you and me forever girl
And you know we could do better than anything that we did
You know that you and me we could do anything
You and me together we could do anything Baby
You and me together yeah yeah
Two of us together we could do anything baby
You and me together yeah yeah
Two of us together yeah yeah
Two of us together we could do anything baby
The sun is falling
Till it leaves the end of the world <start> Someday they won't let you now you must agree
The times they are atelling and the changing isn't free
You've read it in the tea leaves and the tracks are on tv
Beware the savage jaw
Of 
They'll split your pretty cranium and fill it full of air
And tell that you're eighty but brother you won't care
You'll be shooting up on anything tomorrow's never there
Beware the savage jaw
Of 
Come see come see remember me
We played out an all night movie role
You said it would last but I guess we enrolled
In  
 

I'm looking for a vehicle I'm looking for a ride
I'm looking for a party I'm looking for a side
I'm looking for the treason that I knew in '
Beware the savage jaw
Of 
Come see come see remember me
We played out an all night movie role
You said it would last but I guess we enrolled
In  
 



 

 
 <start> I ran around the room again
I ran outside and ran back in
And I just couldn't get away from myself
I don't care what tomorrow brings
I won't back down for anything
I want to think that I was made for something else
I can't wait anymore
I'm ready to reach
So I'm closing the door behind me
All that I can do is hold onto you
And follow where you lead
Where you're leading me
All that I can do is hold onto you
And let you bring me through
It's all that I can do
There are days I think I don't need you
There are days when I can't see the truth
I need you to save me from the lies
Because every thought that's in my head
And even when I draw my next breath
You knew it all before there was time <start> State trooper thinks I drive too fast
Pulled me over to tell me so
I say out here on the prairie
Any speed is too slow
I miss Brooklyn I miss my crew
Let's start over
I missed my cue
Guess I just forgot
Who I was talking to
I should have recognized
That fierce look in his eyes
I've seen it in the mirror
So many times
He's going to put his two cents in
'Cause he's got a gun
But I'm gonna put in three
'Cause history owes me one
Guess I came out here to see some
Stuff for myself
I mean why leave the telling
Up to everybody else
This may be god's country
But it's my country too
Move over Mr. holiness
And let the little people through
Thank you for serving and protecting
The likes of me
Thank you for the ticket
Now can I leave
You know I have left everywhere
I have ever been
I don't really recommend it
Though not like anyone asked me
Maybe you and I
Will meet again someday
I've been known to
Come down this road
Call it destiny
And then again
Maybe not
I don't know <start> 
When we made love tonight
I swear it felt just like the first time
You took me all the way
I heard you say
You know we can't be wrong
So take me all the way
I need you now
I've wanted you so long
In all of my life there's no one else
You're still the one
And when you touch me now
The world stands still just like the night when
You took me all the way
I heard you say
You know we can't be wrong
So take me all the way
I need you now
I've wanted you so long
In all of my life there's no one else
You're still the one
I recall when I looked into your eyes
Ooh I knew it was meant to be
Then you pulled your body close to mine
Ooh I shivered when you whispered
Please

Please

I need to know what it's really like come on

Come on

I'll show you what it's really like
I'll show you what it's like
I'm gonna show you my love
You took me all the way
I heard you say
You know we can't be wrong
So take me all the way
I need you now
I've wanted you so long
In all of my life there's no one else
You're still the one
You took me all the way
I heard you say
You know we can't be wrong
So take me all the way
I need you now
I've wanted you so long
You took me all the way
I heard you say
You know we can't be wrong
So take me all the way
I need you now
I've wanted you so long <start> What does it take to be a man
What does it take to see
It's all heart and soul
A gentle hand
So easy to want and so hard to give
How can you be a man
'Til you see beyond the life you live
Oh what does it take to be a man
We can be blind but a man tries to see
It takes tenderness
For a man to be what he can be
And what does it mean
If you're weak or strong
A gentle feelin'
can make it right or make it wrong
What does it take to be a man
The will to give and not receive
The strength to say what you believe
The heart to feel what others feel inside
To see what they can see
A man is somethin' that's real
It's not what you are
It's what you can feel
It can't be too late
To look through the hate and see
I know that's what a man can be <start> Friends the fun the cigarettes and the sun came out today
And they're waiting for the turn of your back
The lies deceit the dirty looks and the things they'd like to say
It's the curve that made your confidence crash
Chorus
This is your life it's all been ordinary
Until you find all you're worth
Then you find your life is all but something ordinary
And you're longing for home
You're gonna find yourself at home
Bags that hang below your eyes
And the full length mirror never lies
And it all comes so disgustingly clear
But you stand up straight now start to try
And it cleans up right in a suit and tie
But your money is no good around here

At home yeah
Find yourself at home
At home
Life and death the money that's left
And the vultures dive to intercept
And the friendship rolls onto its side
And you wait for it to die
 <start> Janelle Janelle Janelle
So far away
Goodnight sweet dreams
The world is well
Janelle Janelle Janelle
Lookin' through your photograph
Talking through the telephone
I'm thinking through my plans for me
And you so all alone
Janelle Janelle Janelle
So far away
Goodnight sweet dreams
The world is well
Janelle Janelle Janelle
Someday we'll wake up laughing
Put on our dancing shoes
You won't believe the tales I tell
That time Janelle's not mine to choose <start>  old haunts
I found a home in the darkness found a home in the darkness found a home in the darkness
Empty stomach empty head a body fills a vacant bed
And the thunder rolls by and the rains come and the days gone and I wonder where I am.
Found a place in the darkness found a home in the darkness in the darkness home in the darkness.
A crowded room of passers by and in the shadows strangers cry and the ghosts try to hide
When the rains come when the storms form when I wonder who I am in the darkness
Home.
 digging deep.
Digging deep in the darkness digging it deep down deep down deep down digging it
Deep in the darkness digging it deep down deep down deep down digging it
Deep in the darkness digging it deep down down down down digging it
Deep in the darkness digging it down deep down deep down deep digging it
We watched an insect stray to the edge of it's world a lily pad stretched over a green mirror
In which the ghost carp swirl like clouds before a storm.
This is the season of the rains
This is incoming.
And when it came their was no cover no place to hide
Vision blurred hard to breathe trying hard to hold onto something that's real.
Nothing left nowhere to go no open road it's washed away by swollen streams
Carried off downriver with all my broken dreams.
Digging deep in the darkness digging it deep down deep down deep deep digging it
Deep in the darkness digging it deep down down down down digging it
Deep in the darkness digging it deep digging it digging it digging it
Deep in the darkness digging it deep down deep down deep down digging it.
A tethered goat bleats from the corner of the graveyard where the lizards hang motionless as the angels of stone above them their broken wings throwing long shadows into the grass where the scorpions hide.
The tigers are running out of jungle.
In the end I was tired of being asked if I could say that I was happy now
As if you need me to convince you that everything's ok.
Would you take me back
Digging deep in the darkness digging it deep down deep down deep deep digging it
Deep in the darkness digging it deep down down down down down digging it
Deep in the darkness digging it deep deep down deep deep digging it
Deep in the darkness down down down down down down digging it.
Are you happy now you keep asking asking am I happy now
Why can't you tell me that I'm happy now are you happy now
Happy now happy now
. chocolate frogs
The bloated corpses of unsolved murders and old revolutions pirouette and dance amongst the swirls and eddies in their final procession down the muddy river to the delta where they're thrown up by the surf onto sterile beaches or are trapped in the roots of mangrove cathedrals of the islands that gather in the bay.
These are the first arrivals on this new horizon that will be coveted by strangers who will deposit themselves on these shores to build towers to the heavens. the storm will come and the rains will fall and remove their dreams and hopes once again to the waters that surround them. and while they pray the frogs will chant in the darkness
A heid full of chocolate frogs a body full of rush a pocketful of shrapnel and a skinfull of bush
An eyefull of the future and a belly full of the past how beautiful the present when you know it cannae last.
A tumblerful of voddie two fingers in a glass a handful of promises a heart full of remorse
Mindful of your manners when you're brought down to your knees
A heid full of chocolate frogs is all you gave to me
That's all you gave to me that's all you gave to me
A spoonful of miracles a nostril full of dust a lung full of virginia the needs we have we must
A pill to put your heart right a nose out for a deal for a heid full of chocolate frogs what can you give to me
What did you give to me
What did you give to me
What did you give to me
 waving at stars.
You cracked up too soon before the punchline hit home and at the end of the joke did you notice that noone was laughing with you.
You were out on your own
Waving at trains waving at cars waving from bars waving from aeroplanes
Might as well be waving at stars
You called out her name as the darkness hit home raised up your zippo and opened the skies till the crowd melts away at the end of the day you ran out of light
Praying for rain praying for signs praying for time praying for endless night might as well be wishing on stars
. raingods dancing
Empty churches empty pews in the subway nothing moves and the static on the radio is drowning out the sound of raingod's dancing
Empty playgrounds empty bars I can't remember how it was before the flood when all I had to do was recognise the love that's trapped inside.
I gave it all I took it back and in the end there's nothing left except a shell surrounding emptiness and loneliness a core of pain
I see my pathway shining.
Raingods with zippo's a tinman hides a broken heart
Raingods with zippo's he knows the flame has gone that soon he'll fall apart
So I lay me down to lie and with the rain my lullaby I drift away to dreamless sleep leave behind a life that died a victim of a plague of ghosts
I was wrapped up in my guilt buried deep within my memories a shelter of selfpity that I know the rain will wash away I sense the storm arriving.
Raingods with zippo's a tin man rusts away and slowly falls apart
Raingods with zippo's and all he leaves behind a bleeding broken heart.
 the wake up call 
In the end I found beginnings not a vision a wake up call
Raised from the dead by a beating heart and at last I can see it all
And my eyes were opened to the darkness in my hand a burning flame
A spark of life to touch the fuse and blow these clouds away
I can make it happen if I want to
Make it happen if I try
Forgive forget forever never means as much as it does today
Make it happen we can make it happen we can make it happen.
When I wake up will you be there it can never be the same.
If we can take our lives slowly step by step we can be dancing in the rain
We can make it happen we can make it happen make it happen
Forgive forget forever means today make it happen we can make it happen
We can make it happen forgive forget forever means today
Make it happen.

I cultivate evil that's living within
A preacher tried saving my black damaged soul
Possessed by a demon that had full control
The time it is coming when all life will end
With doomsday approaching to hell we'll descend
Religion won't save me the damage is done
The future has ended before it's begun
Death's hand and the crazy I can't stand the light of day
Watching all the victims on their knees as they pray
God of the almighty never answers their call
Satan is just waiting for the righteous to fall to him
I don't mind dying 'cause I'm already dead
Pray not for the living I'll live in your head
Dying is easy it's living that's hard
I'm losing the battle between Satan and God <start> Tell me what to do now the light in my life is gone from me
Is it always the same is the night never ending
Tell me what to do all the hopes and the dreams went wrong for me
There's a smile on my face but I'm only pretending
Taking my life one day at a time
'Cause I can't think what else to do
Taking some time to make up my mind
When there's no one to ask but you
The same old sun would shine in the morning
The same bright eyes would welcome me home
And the moon would rise way over my head
And get through the night alone
And the same old sun would shine in the morning
The same bright stars would welcome me home
And the clouds would rise way over my head
I'll get through the night on my own
Tell me what to do now there's nobody watching over me
If I seem to be calm well it's all an illusion
Tell me what to do when the fear of the night comes over me
There's a smile on my face just to hide the confusion
Taking my life one day at a time
'Cause I can't think what else to do
Taking some time to make up my mind
When there's no one to ask but you
The same old sun would shine in the morning
And the same bright eyes would welcome me home
And the moon would rise way over my head
I'll get through the night alone
And the same old sun would shine in the morning
The same bright stars would welcome me home
And the clouds would rise way over my head
I'll get through my life on my own on my own
On my own on my own <start> Chorus
Shine a light shine it bright on the days gone down
Shine a light shine it bright on the days gone down
Shine a light shine it bright on the days gone down
Shine a light shine it bright on the days gone down
You still got that light in your eyes
And our day is comin' by and by
I'm jailed on this long road here with you
We still gotta long way
We still gotta long way to go
The first time I set eyes on you
I listened to you sing yeah yeah
We didn't have to speak
'Cause the words said everything
Yes you walked right into my life
And we were on our way yeah
So long ago
But it feels like yesterday
And I just want to tell ya...
Shine a light shine it bright on the days gone down
Shine a light shine it bright on the days gone down
Shine a light shine it bright on the days gone down
We won't forget the days gone down
They're written in our hearts yeah yeah
And we're as much in tune as we were right at the start
It all seems so much harder now
It seemed so easy then yeah yeah
Well someday just for fun we might do it all again
I just want to tell ya...
You still got that light in your eyes yes you do
And our day is comin' by and by
I'm jailed on this long road here with you
We still gotta long way

Mug shot nut house crack house black out
Black out <start> Well I crawled outta bed
With a ringin' still in my ear
Lord I feel lucky just to be alive
You see I guess I forgot to duck
Little Susie had a little too much
And I guess I still ain't had enough
Even if it kills me
I'll leave that girl behind me
Well here's lookin' at ya baby
'Til my dyin' day
Chorus
If it's the last thing I ever do
Gonna make you want me
Like I want you
If it's the last thing I ever do
Ain't no denying
What you know is true yeah yeah
I had to come back tonight
Was it love at first sight
Or am I just out of my mind again
Don't ask me to throw in the towel
'Cause I'm tellin' the truth girl now
You're the only girl that ever knocked me dead
Even if it kills me
You got me where you want me
Well here's lookin' at you baby
Until my dyin' day

Falls through the coconut trees
Twilight claims me
Inching calmly.
Through restaurant radios
Came a calypso
Stood with elongo
Inside a shadow.
Elongo how long though
from here to san pedro
we draw lines in the sand.
Elongo how long though
Until we will get back home
The sun is setting low.
Will youth come and go
Singing the songs they know
Like Mother Teresa
And 
And you fly paper planes
A cow wake is where they lay
The roots of your family
The guns of your history.
Eloongo how longo
From here to san pedro
We draw lines in the sand.
Elongo how long though
Until we will get back home
The sun is setting low.
Is it sailing away
Or am I waiting in vain
Do you break all your chains
For it to all wash away.
Elongo how longo
From here to San Pedro
We draw maps in the sand.
Elongo how long though
Until we will get back home
The sun is setting low.
Elongo how longo
From here to San Pedro.
Elongo how longo
From here to San Pedro
We draw lines in the sands
We draw lines in the sands. <start> Corina Corina

Never did believe it 'til you showed up there and proved me wrong
Everyone is here and they're all cheering the end of another day
Whoa ohohoh ohohoh
It's Friday night everyone's asleep and now were walking home
Our shadows grow underneath the streetlights 'til they're over grown
A perfect end to a perfect night and I feel so alright
Whoa ohohoh ohohoh

That's three times more than I've ever felt before
And  AM and I'm too sucked in 'cause it's three days later
I can't stop thinking about you
Call up your friends and let's go down to the beach
Bring your stereo and all your favorite CDs
We'll bring out the guitars sit on top of our cars
And sing the night away just like rock stars
It's wide open everyones scopin'
Hopin' to have a night when nothing gets broken
I will believe in you tonight
Oh I'll believe in you tonight
One she makes me feel not too much like anything
That's three times more than I've ever felt before

How quickly the glimma fades
Spread spreading out my stone wings
Why I I become the storm
The finest marble
Like a raven heading for the sun
Spread spreading out my stone wings
Why I I become the storm
Forth from the river with the yellow tide
Don't get toothed at the cliffs
I'm sad sad about somethin
And there's no soul left to grate here
Like overstaying
A welcome that has been denied
Take me to the opium benign
Where the light took time
Ahh steamrollers paved over life
All I can say is what a pim it's been
Will the clouds carry my tears to you
Carry my tears to you
Carry my tears
Will the clouds carry my tears to you
Carry my tears to you
Carry my tears <start> Aea

The class of '
I'll never forget the way you gave
Your book and pen to me
It was all talked out and settled
You new I'd understand
A girl with dreams as big as yours
Just had to make some plans
So I turned to your best picture
Most likely to succeed
The only one in the whole damn book
That didn't show you with me
And it said that you liked inner strength
So I tried to be true to form
And I hid my teenage broken heart
Instead I signed this poem
I hope you always drive a Cadillac
I hope you always drink champagne
I hope you always shine with the sunshine
I hope you never have to face the rain
Unless the clouds are lined with silver
May every heart you meet be gold
And may you find the world as kind as you've been told
At the ten year class reunion
They read your personal note
And displayed your cover photograph
In your full length sable coat
But the words underneath the picture
Were what mattered most to me
There was something in between the lines
That no one else could see...
It said
I always drive a Cadillac
I always drink champagne
And if you make time while the sun shines
You never have to face the rain
I travel fast because I go alone
Everybody gets bought and sold
And I wondered if you'd really become that cold
That was the last word anyone heard from you
Until I got your card today
A single line and signature
That said I'm coming home to stay
I wonder what life has done to you
I wonder why you thought of me
But if you stop by to say hello
I wonder what you'll think if you see
An old ragged high school yearbook
That falls open to just one page
With a picture of a young girl's face
Full of beauty dreams and rage
But the words underneath the picture
Is the verse that's still so true
It's the one I swore no one would read
Unless I showed it to you
I hope you always drive a Cadillac
I hope you always drink champagne
And you'll carry my heart wherever you go
Even if I never see you again
But if you bring it back home to me
Maybe then it'll mean you know
That the strongest love's the love that let's you go...
I hope you always drive a Cadillac... <start> You wrestle with your conscience
to free your better self.
But did you think for one moment
you could be someone else
Between a rock and a hard place
is where you seem to be.
You've been caught in a trap
between the devil and the deep blue sea.
All those nights so lonely
all the tears that you cry.
You can't hide
from the hurt inside.

You're in a situation
pray this time it will pass.
But it feels like you're walkin'
over miles and miles of broken glass.
Painted into a corner
where the sun never shines.
Somebody's turned on the spotlight
you forgot to learn your lines.
In the place you once called your heart
there's a wound that's open wide.
You can't hide
from the hurt inside.
.
When you're thinking 'bout the hard times
everyone's been through.
But it won't make no difference
seeing things the way you do.
In this blue condition
you must search for the light.
Don't believe them when they tell you
you can't hold back the night.
Between a rock and a hard place
is where you'll always be.
Caught in a trap
between the devil and the deep blue sea.
So many words unspoken.
So many times you never tried.
You can't hide
from the hurt inside.
.
No you can't hide
from the hurt inside.
.
There's one thing you can't hide
it's the hurt inside.
. <start> I I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins
Like dolphins can swim
Though nothing nothing will keep us together
We can beat them forever and ever
Oh we can be heroes just for one day
I I will be King
And you you will be Queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be us just for one day
I I can remember

Standing by the wall

And the guns shot above our heads

And we kissed as though nothing could fall

And the shame was on the other side
Oh we can beat them forever and ever
Then we could be heroes just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be heroes <start> Ray as of today
I can't say things will ever be the same
And that could be a shame
'Cause though I think I know
Another lonely exile when I see one
And you appear to be one
Still
I'm playing it down 'cause I could really be found
If you've got it to spare
I'm playing it cool but it's terribly cruel
'Cause I ought to be there
And Ray what can I say
You don't know me and it's just wishful thinking
To keep myself from sinking
And hence no evidence
To support any theory I have handy
That you could understand me
And so
I'm playing it down 'cause I could really be found
If you've got it to spare
I'm playing it cool but it's terribly cruel
'Cause I ought to be there

And Ray can we repay
Ourselves for days that we've
lost through indecision
With one of recognition
If so then here I go
'Cause some things you know
And some you just believe in
And hope it comes out even
I'm playing it down 'cause I could really be found
If you've got it to spare
I'm playing it cool but it's terribly cruel
'Cause I ought to be there
I ought to be there
I ought to be there <start> Oh it's hard to love somebody when there's no more love to give
Oh you took away my sunshine now rain is all there is
And it's easy to get lost when you got nowhere left to go
Oh it's hard to let somebody when all I want is all I want is you
Can we talk for a bit bought you a minute to Yorkie
When you walk I mean you switch it engulfs me
Lick you off my lips like salt n' vinegar chips
But now you act salty verbally you assault me
Often I'ma AllStar marksman yeah my star ship
Take me up tonight darling I beg your pardon
This wasn't part of our arrangement
Now you're bangin' on my door I need an order of estrangement
Oh it's hard to love somebody when there's no more love to give
Oh you took away my sunshine now rain is all there is
And it's easy to get lost when you got nowhere left to go
Oh it's hard to let somebody when all I want is you
What you did to the kid ain't a bit as capital punishment
You wanna split that quick already done with us
You're the one I spend money with when it's the summer with
Thought it was more than sexual we was on some other 'ish
Vision your silloute while in Tuscany
Luxury when you trusting me stressing me
I just up and leave I'm staying sucker free
Hard to love somebody else but you
But now I'm missing you Arlissa
Oh it's hard to love somebody when there's no more love to give
Oh you took away my sunshine now rain is all there is
And it's easy to get lost when you got nowhere left to go
Oh it's hard to let somebody when all I want is you
You you you you you
All I want all I need yeah
Is you you you you you you you
Just you oh
Oh it's hard to love somebody when there's no more love to give
Oh you took away my sunshine now rain is all there is
And it's easy to get lost when you got nowhere left to go
Oh it's hard to let somebody it's hard to let somebody
When all I want is you when all I want is you
You you you you you you you you you
When all I want is you <start> If I make a mark in time I can't say the mark is mine.
I'm only the underline of the Word.
Yes I'm like him just like you I can't tell you what to do.
Like everybody else I'm searching through what I've heard.
Chorus
Whoa Where do you go
When you don't want no one to know
Who told tomorrow Tuesday's dead
Oh preacher won't you paint my dream won't you show me where you've been
Show me what I haven't seen to ease my mind.
Cause I will learn to understand if I have a helping hand.
I wouldn't make another demand all my life.
Chorus
What's my sex what's my name all in all it's all the same.
Everybody plays a different game that is all.
Now man may live man may die searching for the question why.
But if he tries to rule the sky he must fall.
Chorus
Now every second on the nose the humdrum of the city grows.
reaching out beyond the throes of our time.
We must try to shake it down. Do our best to break the ground.
Try to turn the world around one more time.
Yeah we must try to shake it down do our best to break the ground
Try to turn the world around one more time
Chorus <start> Shrivelup
Well it's a godgiven fact 
It's a godgiven law that
You're gonna lose your maw
It's a godgiven fact you gotta
Buy 'em by the sack
It's a godgiven law that
You're gonna get small
May be just another rap but
You're running out of sap
Well you better take the rap
Dying under daddy's cap
It's at the top of the list
That you can't get pissed
It's rule number one living right isn't fun
Timetested and true you
Gotta pooty poopoo <start> This is the ghouls night out
Suffer unto me
Devils born in angels arms
Ghouls in heavens fall
This is the ghouls night out
All ghouls go to hell
Humans held on eating flesh
It's my destiny
Ghouls ghouls ghouls night out
Ghouls ghouls ghouls night out
Ghouls ghouls
Ghouls ghouls destiny
Hell is where you want to be
I feel the hell on you and me
I feel it every day
Hell is where you want to be
I feel the hell on you and me
It never goes away
Ghouls ghouls ghouls night out
This is the ghouls night out
Suffer unto me
Devils born in angels arms
Ghouls in heaven fall
This is the ghouls night out
All ghouls go to hell
Humans held on eating flesh

Don't want this bridge to break again.
In this winters cold embrace the love we used to know
Wherever you get wherever you go I'll follow you
With every new breath and every new test I'll be with you
As the sharks start swimming circle at your feet again
In this new beginning we repeat mistakes again
Wherever you get wherever you go I'll follow you
With every new breathand every new test I'll be with you
Wherever you get wherever you go I'll follow you
With every new breathand every new test I'll be with you
I follow I follow I be with you
I follow I follow I be with you
I follow I follow I be with you
I follow I follow I be with you <start> I was sittin' in a truckstop
Watchin' tumbleweeds roll by
Tryin' to read the menu
When the waitress caught my eye
She pulled a pencil from her hair
And leaned across the bar
I did my best not to stare
But man she made it hard
I asked that trucker next to me
Hey what looks good today
He said I know what's on your mind
And boy there ain't no way
Get yourself some apple pie
And something cool to drink
I know you want the special
And I like the way you think
But you can't have the waitress
Boy everybody's tried
There's a cowboy down in Abilene
Who keeps her satisfied
They got a hundred acre dream
That's gettin' closer every day
Just a few more plates of ham and eggs
And a few good rides away
Hard times hit West Texas
Damn near everything's for sale
But there's somethings we hold sacred
When everything else fails
When we're down to nothing
Out here everybody shares
Most of us have lost our dreams
So we bought into theirs
I've seen her walk a hundred miles
Up and down this floor
I've never seen her fail to smile
When he limps through that door
So when you're done you leave a tip
And make it nice and fat
And feel lucky you can own a piece
Of something like that
But you can't have the waitress
Boy everybody's tried
There's a cowboy down in Abilene
Who keeps her satisfied
They got a hundred acre dream
That's gettin' closer every day
Just a few more plates of ham and eggs
And a few good rides away
But you can't have the waitress
Boy everybody's tried
There's a cowboy down in Abilene
Who keeps her satisfied
They got a hundred acre dream
That's gettin' closer every day
Just a few more plates of ham and eggs
And a few good rides away
Just a few more plates of ham and eggs
And a few good rides away <start> Four to five and we're still waiting for the call tonight
And we can hide the distant feeling buried in our eyes
And stand down there's no place to run
Stand down it's come undone
And reach out and say what you've done
For everyone
He who takes a beating more than once can last forever
And we can stand this rain but ever lasting stormy weather
And stand down there's no place to run
Stand down it's come undone
And reach out and say what you've done
For everyone
One and half three quarters build it back with bricks and mortars
And stand down there's no place to run
Stand down it's come undone
And reach out and say what you've done
For everyone
It's everlasting
It's everlasting
It's everlasting
It's everlasting
It's everlasting
It's everlasting
Lyrics Written By A. Wasiliev <start> You live your life in a state of confusion
Never finding your way.
You've had the breaks
But you're so disillusioned.
You only live for today.
You never stopped for a red light
You never even tried.
You're on the wrong side of midnight.
Too fast to live but too young to die.
Keep on rockin' and rollin'.
Keep on singing the blues.
Keep on rockin' and rollin'.
You've got nothing to lose.
You say that you've got a hot reputation.
You never built it on trust.
I say you're part of a lost generation.
You got left in the dust.
You never stopped for a red light
You never even tried.
You're on the wrong side of midnight.
Too fast to live but you're too young to die.
Keep on rockin' and rollin'.
Keep on singing the blues.
Keep on rockin' and rollin'.
You've got nothing to lose.
Keep on rockin' and rollin'.
Keep on singing the blues.
Keep on rockin' and rollin'.
You've got nothing to lose.
Yeah nothing to lose.
You never stopped for a red light
You never even tried.
You're on the wrong side of midnight.
Too fast to live but you're too young to die.
Keep on rockin' and rollin'.
Keep on singing the blues.
Keep on rockin' and rollin'.
You've got nothing to lose.
Keep on rockin' and rollin'.
Keep on singing the blues.
Keep on rockin' and rollin'.
You've got nothing to lose.

You've got nothing.

No no you've got nothing to lose.

Nothing nothing nothing.

You've got nothing to lose.

No no no no no no no no.

Nothing to lose.

Wooh.

You've got nothing to lose.

Nothing nothing nothing.

You've got nothing to lose. <start> Aint no sense in worryin bout me
Aint no sense in worryin bout me
What if I vanish tomorrow
Life still goes on without me
Aint no sense in crying over me
I lived to be all I knew to be
Just keep my words that you borrowed
Publish them for the whole world to see
What I do with my time
Is work on me Its my life
Gotta be sure that Im right
Cross my Ts and dot my Is
And if I miss dont be confused
Im not a hypocrite. That aint cool
Youve got an optimist in the room
And all Im trying to do is tell you
Aint no sense in worryin bout me
Aint no sense in worryin bout me
What if I vanish tomorrow
Life still goes on without me
We cannot suspend a prophecy
My friend what will be it sure will be 
If Babylon falls tomorrow
Then thats how it was supposed to be
Cant control every circumstance
Some things are out of your hands
Youve got to believe theres a bigger plan
Or youll make yourself a madman
Take the coast walk the shoreline
Search your soul free your mind
Try to be right in all you do
Cause only you can account for you
Aint no sense in worryin bout me
Aint no sense in worryin bout me
What if I vanish tomorrow
Life still goes on without me
We cannot suspend a prophecy
My friend what will be it sure will be 
If Babylon falls tomorrow
Then thats how it was supposed to be
Aint no sense in crying over me
I lived to be all I knew to be
Just keep my words that you borrowed
Publish them for the whole world to see
Aint no sense in worryin bout me 
Aint no sense in worryin bout me
What if I vanish tomorrow
Life still goes on without me <start> 
You just can't mold me
I'll be what I wanna be
And I'll see what I wanna see
Even if two plus two you means three you can't hold me
You know my name
You got my number
I'm just a somethin
You wanna put under
When I'm a walkin
Down the empty street
You put up a barrier
That I have to meet
You send me a message
You want me to stop
The things I'm takin
From what you got
Your talktalkatalkin
Bout what I do
But ya better stop pushin
Or it'll be all over for you <start> lyricsJason Kohnen
I hear the music
sweet tunes that caress my soul
music begging for music
it woes my soul ...so...
it enchants me...
...feeding my hunger
but I'm hungry for more
...so much more..
food for the poets thought
ink for the thirsty pen
lust like the ravaging whore
bringing on her final encore <start> She's my baby she's my love
Pixie Queen of Bible Club
Seen her round the fountain sipping cokes
Crafting brand new Polish jokes
And I can't explain why my accent changed
I guess there's still some hope to score some dope
She needs to be changed inside
She's my waitress she's the boss
Lips and teeth of scented cloths
Pencil in the dentist clean the crops
Have you seen my soda pop
There was a Polish priest
Who thought that he could please me
He got me so whacked down I nearly lost my house
'Cause nobody needs me yeah <start> Madeleine hears the bohemians say
She's selfish and crazy
Which isn't so far from the truth
She's the essence of youth
The flower you place on eternity's grave
The romantic who isn't afraid
Of the beat of her heart
She raises a glass to your art
And when she gets drunk she says...
Oh give me the autumn give me the trees
Gather up everything I ever wanted
And give it me please
Give me the ocean give me the sea
Gather up everything I ever wanted
And share it with me
How many hearts are knocked down in the street
How many poets are driven
To drink and to verse
By her singular eyes piercing out through a flightpath of
Rarified air
Where all the shiny black birds of the west
Make a rest in her hair
She raises a glass to your love
And when she gets drunk she says...
And you ask where she comes from
And she tells you the earth
Like the place that you come from
Is a whole different world
She says life is a banquet
So why hang around
Catching crumbs from a table 
Come share it with me <start> I savor every minute that you're here
That you're here with me
Close my eyes and remember every breath
Every memory
Through all these sleepless nights alone
I still feel you
Across these miles away from home
That I never get used to
Every time you go you take a part of me
A part of me with you
Every time you go
I feel it in my soul
Every every
Every time you go half what I used to be
You were in my arms
Every time you go
You take a part of me a part of me with you
Every time you go
I count the days until you're back again
Back here by my side
When we're apart it feels like something in me
Something in me dies
I hear your voice over the phone
And God I miss you
Still all these miles away from home
That I never get used to
Every time you go you take a part of me
A part of me with you
Every time you go
I feel it in my soul
Every every
Every time you go half what I used to be
When you were in my arms
Every time you go
You take a part of me a part of me with you
Oh I'm there with you in your heart
No matter how far apart we are
You're with me everywhere you go
Every time you go you take a part of me
A part of me with you
Every time you go
I feel it in my soul
Every time you go you take a part of me
A part of me with you
Every time you go
I feel it in my soul
Every every
Every time you go half what I used to be
When you were in my arms
Every time you go
You take a part of me a part of me with you
Every time you go <start> We found his diary today
He wrote in great detail
How cleverly he planned
All of the killings
How precisely he executed
His insane fantasies
It was all so perfect
Except for one thing one thing
One thing one thing one thing
I like to watch from my car
I like to make sure you don't go far
I know the hours you sleep
Don't approve of the company that you keep
While you're in work I'm alone
In your room on your bed and you'll never know
I like to go through your things
The touch the smell the joy it brings
I know where you live
I know where you hide
I know what keeps you alive
I know where you go
I know who you know
I know where you're spending your nights
I don't like the guy in the suit
Or that street punk in the combat boots
You may not see them again
I showed them a quick but a painful end
I know where you live
I know where you hide
I know what keeps you alive
I know where you go
I know who you know
I know where you're spending your nights
I see I feel I watch over you
I see I feel I watch over you
I want to know what you say
I need to hear the prayers you pray
I like to play with your hair
When you sleep and you dream
And there's no one there
I know where you live
I know where you hide
I know what keeps you alive
I know where you go
I know who you know
I know where you're spending your nights
I see I feel I watch over you
I see I feel I watch over you
I see I feel I watch over you
I see I feel I watch over you
I see I feel I watch over you
I see I feel I watch over you <start> Red NailsHigh HeelsShes Reckless with the hearts she stealsSpends MoneyShe doesn't earnAnd sets fires just to watch 'em burnThat girl's made of matches and she wants to light her name untill itcatchestoo close to be playing around She's gonna burn herself to the ground.Cool as icebut flammableShe's kept her pretty little hands full.Has enfella sacrificeat the alter of burning your name in light.That girl's made of matches and she wants to light her name until it catchestoo close to be playing around She's gonna burn herself to the ground.She likes the feel of ashes in between her fingertipsbut her lungs are fillin' up with smokeHeyShe likes the feel of ashles in between her fingertipsbut her lungs are fillin' up with smoke Fillin' ayyyThat girl's made of matches and she wants to light her name until it catchestoo close to be playing around She's gonna burn herselfDown <start> how did you find a way to break my heart

I don't believe what you were saying I tired to sleep it all

falling down everything is falling down
I'm feeling like I'm losing ground

falling down where am I gonna go from here
do you really care I guess it doesn't really matter now
cause I'm falling down
I thought everything would always be
we used to fit perfectly
pen and paper
black lines circling around your heart
you built a wall to protect it
but you kept out all my love
I hope that you know that it won't give you any fair

cause I'm falling down completely and you're nowhere
why did you leave me badly out of breath now <start> When we fall out I like to go
Driving in my car
Listen to something ironic and
End up in a bar
Get an ear full of shit from a stranger
Who's got a broken heart
Weighing up what would
Be more painful
Staying with her man
Or going back to her
Chorus
Doesn't everybody feel this
Way sometimes
It's a lose lose situation
For a shitty little crime
You can never win with women
It's pointless trying to try
It's a lose lose situation
Until the day you die
Everybody knows the score
She'll be crying to the mother in law
Then I'll be sleeping out with the dog
Must give Inter Flora a call
Chorus
Then we make up I'll be walking
On egg shells for a day
I'll clean the house in the hope
That I might get a lay
I think back to that drunken stranger
Something that he said
You made your bed so lie in it she'll be
Quiet when your dead
Chorus
It's a lose lose situation
Until the day you die <start> Chorus Elton
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I..
got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window..
and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
it's not so bad..
Eminem as 'Stan'
Dear Slim I wrote but you still ain't callin
I left my cell my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn you must nota got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or something
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
but anyways fuck it what's been up Man how's your daughter
My girlfriend's pregnant too I'm bout to be a father
If I have a daughter guess what I'ma call her
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Ruckus too that shit was phat
Anyways I hope you get this man hit me back
just to chat truly yours your biggest fan
This is Stan
Chorus Elton
Eminem as 'Stan'
Dear Slim you still ain't called or wrote I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad  I just think it's FUCKED UP you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
you didn't have to but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
four hours and you just said No.
That's pretty shitty man  you're like his fucking idol
He wants to be just like you man he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though I just don't like being lied to
Remember when we met in Denver  you said if I'd write you
you would write back  see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
so when I have a shitty day I drift away and put 'em on
cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real and I respect you 'cos you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 
But she don't know you like I know you Slim no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin up
You gotta call me man I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours Stan  P.S.
We should be together too
Chorus Elton
Eminem as 'Stan'
Dear MisterI'mTooGoodToCallOrWriteMyFans
this'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word  I don't deserve it
I know you got my last two letters
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now I'm doing  on the freeway
Hey Slim I drank a fifth of vodka you dare me to drive
You know the song by Phil Collins In the Air of the Night
about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning
but didn't then Phil saw it all then at a show he found him
That's kinda how this is you coulda rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late  I'm on a  downers now I'm drowsy
and all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped ALL of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim we coulda been together think about it
You ruined it now I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you SCREAM about it
I hope your conscience EATS AT YOU and you can't BREATHE without me
See Slim screaming
Shut up bitch I'm trying to talk
Hey Slim that's my girlfriend screamin in the trunk
but I didn't slit her throat I just tied her up see I ain't like you
cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well gotta go I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit I forgot how am I supposed to send this shit out
Chorus Elton
Eminem
Dear Stan I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now how far along is she
Look I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
and here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show I musta missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too
I say that shit just clowning dog
c'mon  how fucked up is you
You got some issues Stan I think you need some counselling
to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter I just hope it reaches you in time
before you hurt yourself I think that you'll be doin just fine
if you relax a little I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
why are you so mad Try to understand that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
and had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid
and in the car they found a tape but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about his name was.. it was you
Damn <start> Baby please don't you drive me away
Baby please don't you drive me away
Now you know I need you want you by my side
My love for you I'll never hide
Now if you love you will hear my plea
Put me out and that's the end of me
Baby please don't you drive me away
One more thing honey
You know I want you I love you so
I never never never never never let you go
Baby please don't you drive me away oh yeah
Oh please please don't you drive me away
Don't you hear me telling you
Don't drive me away
Let me tell you
You know I need you want you by my side
My love for you I'll never hide
Won't you love me won't you hear my plea
Put me out and that's the end of me
Baby please don't you drive me away <start> Vor zwei Wochen hab' ich dich zum ersten Mal gesehen.
Du warst so betrunken du konntest kaum noch stehen.
Aus Mitleid hab' ich dich nach Haus gebracht.
Du sagtest zrtlich Mein Schatz gute Nacht.
Mein Schatz hast du gesagt vielleicht war's nur ein Scherz
Amors Pfeil durchbohrte mein Herz.
Jetzt weiss ich nicht was ich denken soll
ist es wirklich Liebe oder finde ich dich nur toll
Ich weiss nicht ob es Liebe ist
wenn man nicht mehr trinkt und isst.
Wenn man etwas hrt und es sofort vergisst
ich weiss nicht ob das Liebe ist.
Am nchsten Tag habe ich dich besucht
als das Bier alle war hast du laut geflucht.
Du lagst auf dem Bett und warst ziemlich breit
aber immerhin waren wir allein zu zweit.
Ich wollte mit dir reden ber deine Frisur
und ber Liebe aber du lachtest nur.
Jetzt weiss ich nicht was ich denken soll
ist es wirklich Liebe oder finde ich dich nur toll
Ich weiss nicht ob es Liebe ist
wenn man alle Frauen an einer misst.
Wenn man an eine denkt und eine andere ksst
ich weiss nicht ob es Liebe ist.
Ich weiss nicht ob es Liebe ist
wenn man beim Pinkeln stndig neben's Becken pisst. <start> sevdim desem

Way up yonder great will be her reward.
Covenant woman shining like a morning star
I know I can trust you to stay where you are.
And I just got to tell you
I do intend
To stay closer than any friend.
I just got to thank you
Once again
For making your prayers known
Unto heaven for me
And to you always so grateful
I will forever be.
I've been broken shattered like an empty cup.
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up
And I know He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true
He must have loved me so much to send me someone as fine as you.
And I just got to tell you
I do intend
To stay closer than any friend.

To stay closer than any friend.

Slippin' and a slidin'...
Slippin' and a slidin'... <start> There's something new in my way
I thought about him all that day
Sitting at home dying alone
Then again who am I to say
We both know I've been down that same road
I know it gets lonely when that phone rings
It's the last thing you wanna hear
I should know better by now
But after all I'm so tired of explaining
All the things I should have said
I secretly always knew
But that news came way too soon
I was sitting at home and wondering why
I couldn't even look you in the eye
I heard all those things that your father told you
You know it's not right but taking your own life
Might be the only thing that you see through
I should know better by now
But after all I'm so tired of explaining
All the things I should have said
It's alright to complain
It's alright to feel pain
I thought I had the answers to all of my problems
With one thing but it's always the same
I go in one door and right out the other
I'm left with me and James and a million little pieces
It's not that I want them all
To be sorry when I'm gone
I'm just tired of waking up
I'm gonna try the pills tonight
I'm gonna try and do it my way
And watch it all fall apart
I should know better by now
But after all I'm so tired of explaining
All the things I should have said <start> smack
my head hits the wall
dont know why this is happening to me
a role model for me in this world
do as i say and not as i do
another slap across my face
just to show me that you care
how can i fucking love you
what love do you have to share
none
someday theres gonna be hell to pay
for treating your son this way
you cant take my dignity
without destroying your love for me
and you wonder why i hate your fucking guts
no time left for apologies
fuck you
grown apart from you
im told that i am stupid
you taught me all i know
that im so fucking worthless
and that my lives a joke
curled up in a ball
is how i spent my fucking life
i tremble in fear and im bloody
and i cant stop the tears from flooding my eyes
what have i done to deserve
the agony you call love
i got a broken arm and stitches
while other kids got kisses and hugs
love  abuse
ever since i was born
i get them confused
you never cared
you never will
when i die
dont come to my funeral <start> Throw yourself in front of this
before it goes to long.
Ask the questions that you want
when they all seem wrong. Because
I saw you first drift right by.
I saw you first drift right by.
Open up let us in
when you shut down you
open up listen here
when you shut down you
open up stay right here
when you look down you slide.
Keep the pace for every move
when it goes too fast.
Take the place the absentee
if they're running back.
Because because.
I saw you first drift right by.
I saw you first drift right by.
Open up let us in
when you shut down you
open up listen here
when you shut down you
open up stay right here
when you look down you slide.
Don't throw it all away
I can be your guide
Don't throw it all away
I can be your guide
I saw you first drift right by. <start> Ain't no loving tonight
My woman says she ain't my woman
I sure put up a fight
To keep it right
I used a whole lot of pride to get her
I used a whole pack of lies and begged her
She just threw me the key
And said she's free
Thunder in the night
Thunder in the night again
Thunder in the night again
Thunder in the night
Thunder in the night again
Thunder in the night again
Frightening lightning hit me again
It's burning much deeper this time
I got them storm clouds hanging right over my head
And it's gonna rain harder this time
Thunder thunder
Thunder thunder
Out here searching the streets
I gotta find my woman and tell her
I never wanted to cheat
But she cheated me
I never knew just how much I loved her
I never knew till I went and lost her
Now it's all too late
She's gone away <start> I don't get what people do.
They lie and they cheat and they steal from you.
So I I made my own world.
I'm not sayin' I'm perfect yet I've got my share of regrets.
But I I'm doin' my best.
You make me feel like I've gone halfway around the world.
And you let me know that I'm not such a crazy girl.
All that it takes to make you happy whatever you need to know
that you make me feel like I've gone halfway around the world.
I know what some of 'em say. Let 'em talk let 'em chip away.
You're not real without a broken heart.
Remember lyin' beneath the stars
We could be on Earth or Mars.
I'm so good because I'm in your arms.
Oh you make me feel like I've gone halfway around the world.
And you let me know that I'm not such a crazy girl.
All that it takes to make you happy whatever you need to know
that you make me feel like I've gone halfway around the world.
When did we all get so distracted
I think we've gone insane.
You make me feel like I've gone halfway around the world.
And you let me know that I'm not such a crazy girl.
All that it takes to make you happy whatever you need to know
that you make me feel like I've gone halfway around the world.
I don't get what people do.
They lie and they cheat and they steal from you. <start> Ah loving you is easy you are on my side
We play the game strictly to our rules
We led the field a love affair
Which made all other lovers fools
Oh
How can you ever let me down 
How can you ever let me down 
How can you ever let me down
These promises are made for us 
We promised that we'd always have time for each other
Whenever I needed you'd be there
We promised to be true there'd be no other
We promised that for ever we would care
Oh
How can you ever let me down 
How can you ever let me down 
How can you ever let me down
These promises are made for us 
We had to change
Oh but you stayed the same
You wouldn't change
Oh what a shame
'Cause loving you's not easy you're not on my side
We play a game with two sets of rules
We lead the field in a love affair
Ah strictly meant for fools
Oh
Why did you ever let me down 
Why did you ever let me down 
Why did you ever let me down
Those promises were made for us 
You never have any time for me
Whenever I need you you're not there
You've never been true and it's plain to see
The fact is you never really cared
Oh
Why did you ever let me down 
Why did you ever let me down 
Why did you ever let me down
Those promises we made for us  <start> There was a friend of mine on murder
And the judge's gavel fell
Jury found him guilty
Gave him sixteen years in hell
He said I ain't spending my life here
I ain't living alone
Ain't breaking no rocks on the chain gang
I'm breakin' out and headin' home
Gonna make a jailbreak
And I'm lookin' towards the sky
I'm gonna make a jailbreak
Oh how I wish that I could fly
All in the name of liberty
All in the name of liberty
Got to be free
Jailbreak let me out of here
Jailbreak sixteen years
Jailbreak had more than I can take
Jailbreak yeah
He said he'd seen his lady being fooled with
By another man
She was down and he was up
He had a gun in his hand
Bullets started flying everywhere
And people started to scream
Big man lying on the ground
With a hole in his body
Where his life had been
But it was
All in the name of liberty
All in the name of liberty
I got to be free
Jailbreak jailbreak
I got to break out
Out of here
Heartbeats they were racin'
Freedom he was chasin'
Spotlights sirens rifles firing
But he made it out
With a bullet in his back <start> You're like a lonely statue
The wind and rain comes at you
You'll stand and take your chances
Against the world's advances
You rely on a flimsy virtue
No man can stand alone
Does it offend you
That I got a Friend who
Knows what you've been through
And says that He loves you
I wanna sing His name
Of how He became
Jesus the Friend of mine
How long will you be posin'
How long can you stay frozen
You'll crumble from the inside
Your pride will be your demise
Won't you let someone help you
Everybody needs a friend
Does it offend you
That I got a Friend who
Knows what you've been through
And says that He loves you
I wanna sing His name
Of how He became
Jesus the Friend of mine
Does it offend you
That I got a Friend who
Knows what you've been through
And says that He loves you
I wanna sing His name
Of how He became
I wanna sing His name
Of how He became
I wanna I wanna sing
I wanna I wanna
I wanna I wanna sing
Jesus the Friend of mine <start> Stranded
In a life in which your struggle for acceptance
Is a neverending chore
Upbraided
For your actions past and present and rewarded for ideas
Of the future's bright open door
The henchman
Is the human analogue of the suffering multitudes
Who like good dogs sit and lick for their reward
So what good advice have I got for you
To insure against your likely metamorphosis into this reprobate
Don't be a henchman
Stand on your laurels
Do what no one else does
Praise the good of other men for good man's sake
And when everyone else in the world follows your lead

That's when the entire world shall live in harmony <start> can you tell me the sound when you try to remember
crushing doves in the palm of your hand...
i really need to try to not forget
without you leaning over me
reminding me to always let go.
it's not working
and no matter how hard i try
goodbye..
never sounds the same
as when you try to
remember
it. <start> Fear
Agony

Fear
Agony

Me <start> Well they took me to the hospital
And I swore I wouldn't go
My blood was running much too high
My heart was much too slow
The doctor had some questions
Some things he had to know
My lady shook her head and said
The boy's got no control
Well I wasn't born in trouble
My adopted middle name
When you're running with the devil
You've got no one else to blame
He says I'm okay
He might say I'm alright
But I lose control
When he keeps me up all night
No control

I got no control

I hope they don't know no no no
I got no control

No control

No no no no no control
She always makes me feel so good
I gotta make things right
I'm watching all the boys check her
And I don't want a fight
But I've got a temper
That's one thing she knows
And if there's some trouble
I lose my control
I got no control

I got no control

I hope they don't know no no no
I got no control

I said no control

I ain't got no no no control
No control
No no no no no no no
I got no control

I got no control

I know they don't know
I got not control

No control

I got

Oh oh

No control
No no no no no no no

No no no no no no no

No control
Incomprehensible
I wanna tell you now
I got no control now
No no no no no no no

No no no no no no no

No control <start> Their on the side of caution
They're taking in the new girls
Two faced too poised to shed a tear
No memory to speak of
Past in the night we didn't hear
The fading breath of your love
We lose control of the moments
Another trend goes out of season
A new love forever
Look the other way
You see through me
A new trend indifference
You are a child of privilege
Your reputation leads you
All trace of light will disappear
You're falling into season
Their every word is insincere
There is no time for reason
We lose control of the moments
Another trend goes out of season
A new love forever
Look the other way
You see through me
A new trend indifference
Remember our childhood
It's not quite the same
A pale hue of new blood
They all know your name
We lose control of the moments
Another trend goes out of season
A new love forever
Look the other way
You see through me
A new trend indifference <start> Pre>

pre> <start> My father told me he told me Son
There was one year in my life I felt so close to God.
He said I lost my way on and off again
Since that time oh but you can be sure.
When my well runs dry I return
To the reservoir.
This life is a river cruel and then kind
Yes it can cradle or kill you protect you or leave you to die
I said the river runs cold and merciless
Headlong past every shore
But in the end it returns by and by to the reservoir
Oh my body's battered
Oh my soul is anything but pure
So I go drawing from the reservoir
Heaven is a perfect blue reflection of the reservoir
It's a perfect blue reflection
More perfect than perfection
We're born into this life our bodies glistening from the reservoir
Our bodies shiny with the water
Each of us heaven's sons and daughters
I said
Between that moment and the journey's end
We lose the knowledge that we had back then
Innocence like sunlight
Sunlight falling on the field in which we gather
The field that gathers up our hearts
And leads them homeward past the stories of the sycamores
Sense of wonder over yonder lies the reservoir
My father told me he told me Son
There was one year in my life
I felt so close to God.
He said he felt so close to God
Now he's returning to the reservoir
He's always returning to the reservoir
I guess we're all just returning to the reservoir. <start> It's a shame the rules change not the game
Such a shame It's the same
Now everything is in vain
All in vain it's such a shame
Could it be true that there's nothing left to do
For me and you can't be true
We all can't be such fools
Could life be so cruel
Could life be so cruel
Maybe I don't even try fearing what I'd find
Guess I am a number on the line
Could you please tell me why
We're on the same line and we're fallin' behind
On life
Life is great I'm walking in the sun and everything is cool
Yeah it's true there's so much we can do
It feels so right
Yeah it's all right
Maybe I don't even try fearing what I'd find
Guess I am a number on the line
Could you please tell me why
Baby I don't even want to try fearing what I'd find
Guess I am a number on the line
Could you please tell me why we're on the same line and
Fallin' behind
Fallin' behind on life <start> I I I didn't sleep last night.
No you you you never really got me.
I I'm not the kind of girl that kisses and tells the world
And I'm not the kind of guy you need but somehow we both keep believing.

Can't you feel my heartbeat listen up disaster boy I'm tellin' you.
Don't you pin your heart on my sleeve don't you pin your heart on my sleeve.

Don't you pin your heart on my sleeve don't you pin your heart on my eyes.
Yeah every girl has given up but I'm the one who'll stand by you.

  <start> I've got a bad connection
It seems there's nothing more that I can do
I've been staring at a wall since noon
There's nothing more that I'm used to
With all these fucked up difference
And not to mention points of view
What we don't' see what out of sight
Not out of mind
We're told to just sit back and listen and not say a word
Just do what you tell me and never be heard
That's just the type of bullshit that I'd expect from you
You're driving me crazy
Siempre Loco
I've got that good old fashioned feeling running through my bones
They call it free will now taking control
I'll speak my mind and my actions
Live the way that I choose
I'm tuning you out and I will never <start> If you're looking for trouble
You came to the right place
If you're looking for trouble
Just stare in this face
I was born looking out
From my Momma's sack
My daddy was the
Demon Werewolf Jack
Because I'm evil
My middle name is Misery
Said I'm evil child
Yeah don't you mess around with me
Never look for trouble
And I never am
I don't take no orders
From no kind of man
I'm only made out of
Flesh and blood
But if you're looking on
Some trouble
Why don't you try it on your own
Because I'm evil
My middle name is Misery
Said I'm evil child
Yeah don't you mess around with me
Yeah
And I'm evil
My middle name is Misery
Well I'm evil child
Yeah don't you mess around with me
I said I'm evil
I said I'm evil
I said I'm evil evil evil evil woah
Don't mess around don't mess around with the evil
I said I'm evil
I said I'm evil evil evil evil woah
Don't mess around yeah don't mess around with my evil
I said I'm evil <start> One way one way to the center of your heart
Slow down the world is too loud and this loneliness too hard
We should let it out just to be closer
Well I need you now over and over
We could stay up in the Sunday room
As we share these words unspoken
When you ask me if I'm in love with you
I would say you must be joking
I would say I I would say I am
Slowly show me what you hold and what you hide
Tell me that you really believe and I'll see it in your eyes
But when you've hurt so much you're scared to get closer
You can let it out over and over
We could stay up in the Sunday room
As we share these words unspoken
When you ask me if I'm in love with you
I would say you must be joking
I would say I I would say I am
I could show you the river we'll wash in the water
Give me your faith there's so many waves
We could stay up in the Sunday room
As we share these words unspoken
When you ask me if I'm in love with you
I would say you must be joking
I would say I I would say I am
I would say I am
I could show you the river we could wash in the water <start> Went to a party and caught you fucking my mate Went to a party caught you in bed with my mate
I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I I I HATE YOU
You told me that you loved me And I believed your lies But you gave my friend his first dose Then I knew it was a pack of lies I didn't think you could hurt me But I was such a fool My mates said you would never change But now I know you whore When I opened the bedroom door I couldn't believe my eyes You were giving head to my best friend You filthy whore <start> Tonight you said that we were through
I've lost again and it is you
I walk alone and think of things
we've said and done
Our love has flown
like spring it came and now has gone
Do you remember summer days
Walks on the shore and date caf
It's winter now and like the leaves
these tears are falling for you
I've lost your love
now I must face this world alone
And soon the night skies turn to dawn
And still my memories linger on
Your world goes on it's true
but my world stopped when I lost you
Here comes the dawn my life my love
now are gone. <start> He never thought he cared so much about the minute hand
Until he started praying for a second chance
If he could only do it all again
He'd trade the long nights that he spent behind his desk
For all he missed
He tells his wife I wish that this moment in this room
Was not me dying but just spending a little time with you
You only get just one time around
You only get one shot at this
One chance to find out
The one thing that you don't wanna miss
One day when it's all said and done
I hope you see that it was enough
This one ride one try one life to love
She never thought she cared so much about those little hands
That held on tight the day she left 'til she was scared to death
Sitting all alone on a hotel bed the end of the road
The sun has set on her big plans to feel young again
She picks up the phone dials a number hears that little voice
That's haunted every single mile since she made that choice
You only get just one time around
You only get one shot at this
One chance to find out
The one thing that you don't wanna miss
One day when it's all said and done
I hope you see that it was enough
This one ride one try one life to love
You only get just one time around
Only get one shot at this
One chance to find out
The one thing that you don't wanna miss
One day when it's all said and done
I hope you see that it was enough
This one ride one try one life
One ride one try one life to love to love <start> I turn around from whining sounds
Don't give us shit for making it
If your band's not signed don't put us down
Try playing hard you stupid clown
It's Poison with some different hair
It's crap that comes from everywhere
It's stupid loser Kmart rap
With more concern for coloured hair than music.
Wanna be a rock star Have a limo with a juice bar
With an undisputed killer for a girlfriend
So I guess I'd better
Spit it Barf it Spew it Sell it Roast it Toast it
Oats peas beans and barley will grow
Why we sell nobody knows
You can say just how you feel
But look who's got the record deal <start> So you don't wanna hear about my good song
You don't wanna hear about how I am getting on
With all the things that I can get done
The sun is in the sky and I am by my lonesome
So you don't wanna hear about my good day
You have better things to do than to hear me say
God it's been a lovely day everything's been going my way
I took out the trash today and I'm on fire
So you don't wanna hear about my good friends
You don't have the guts to take the truth or consequence
Success is in the eye of the beholder
And it's looking even better over your cold shoulder
I'm not suggesting you get to line me up for questioning
But Jesus think about the bridges you are burning and I'm betting
That even though you knew it from the start
You'd rather be a bitch than be an ordinary broken heart
So go ahead and talk about your bad day
I want all the details of the pain and misery
That you are inflicting on the others
I consider them my sisters and I want their numbers
God it's been a lovely day everything's been going my way
I took up croquet today I'm on fire
I picked up the pieces of my broken ego
I have finally made my peace as far as you and me go
But I'd love to have you up to see the place
I'd like to do more than survive I'd like to rub it in your face
Hey it's been a lovely day everything is going my way
I had so much fun today and I'm on fire
God it's been a lovely day every thing's been going my way
Ever since you went away hey I'm on fire
I'm on fire I'm on fire I'm on
I'm on fire I'm on fire
I'm on fire I'm on
So you don't wanna hear about my good day <start> Close those eyes down we all fall down into the space gone with no trace feel your heart slow where will we go into the sunlight or the dead of night.
There's nobody here for me now there's nobody here for me now there's nobody here for me now.
So much running scared living breathing dead.
There's nobody here for me now there's nobody here for me now.
Silence fills you through time to tell the truth see the words on signs it ends with a blink of an eye. <start> Later on that evening when
I thought I'd had enough
I sat down in a restaurant and
Over powdered drugs
I ordered up some dewsoaked lettuce
Picked by virgin hands
Nestling on a bed of
Pearl encrusted clams
Well the waiter's name was Renee and
He told me how his aunt
Who had  children
And how they'd always planned
To grow the smallest vegetables in
All the kingdom's land
They're poor he said but happy and
Well that's what really counts
And every evening after
Their  hour day
They'd sleep content imagining
That restaurant far away
Where fat fucks in designer suits
Would order over deals
The smallest portions of these
Tiny morsels for their meals
Still the blood it clots
And the hearts get stricken
See everybody's searching for...that attitude chicken
My Porsche got stuck in traffic and
My girlfriend said get real
How dare you get me stuck here
How d'you think that made me feel
I got a Yamaha  Million
A bike was what I needed
With my name spelt on the number plate
Like Paul Revere on speed
Yes my girlfriend's name is Anne
But she says the K is silent
Put the H after the A or
She gets rilly violent
She wears designer jewels
And she's got designer clothes
Which go with her designer mouth
Eyes ass tits and nose
And she does another line
And she's talking finger lickin'
And that's my signal to send our for...that attitude chicken
A special breed
That fills the need
Is bred to feed
The endless greed
Yes it's poultry time
For all you little kittens
Let's get hip and do...attitude chicken
Now when she comes she screams designer screams
At precisely the right moment
Loud enough so the neighbours hear
And think I'm really potent
She's considerate like that
Which is why I guess I love her
And by that I hope you don't think
That I am trying to smother
Her uniqueness or her freedom
To find some other lovers
And express herself sexually
In attempting to discover
The inner self that every modern woman
In the land
Has a democratic right to
Which I as modern man
Of course respect and understand
And indeed can empathise with
Appreciate articulate
Feel for and sympathise with
And any reference I might make
To her sexually
Has been vetted and approved of
by the Woman's Commissary
Still the plans get hatched
And the plots the thicken
See everybody's looking for...that attitude chicken
Neatly packaged politics
For all the little minds
it's the special interest lobby
For these multicultured times
The Politically Correct
Are the Nazis of our time
When it's the freedom of ideas
That makes man civilised
Let's drag out the old scapegoat
If he's still alive and kicking
And go riding off in glory for that...attitude chicken
Gobble gobble gobble gobble
Cluck cluck cluck cluck
Attitude chicken
I'd rather be a hammer than a nail

written by Bob Geldof
taken from the album The Happy Club <start> I'm lucky I can open the door and I can walk down the street
Unlucky I've got nowhere to go and so I follow my feet
A choice is facing you a healthy dose of pain
A choice is facing you as you stare through the rain
A choice is facing you but I choose to refrain for today
Tomorrow we'll be back in trouble again
Dream one you had a whole lot of fun with a comedian
Stop short of going all the way you'll have to make it someday
Why is this happening to you you're not a child
Why is this happening You have too much on your mind
Things creep up on you when you are fast asleep
You are dreaming you are sleepy
You are stuck to the sheets
In a town so small there's no escaping you
In a town so small there's no escape from view
In a town so small there's nothing left to do
Intellectual and perspiring
Dirty dream number two
Dream two you couldn't see her face but you saw everything else
Dream two was pretty special easily beats loving yourself
Could you put a name to someone else's sigh
Could you put a face to someone else's eyes
Is it someone that youd maybe recognize
But it all fades into morning when you open your eyes <start> I've been afraid of you for so long now

I've been dead to you since we fell out

I've been bitchin' my whole life long
Now I'm itchin' to take you on
Want to take you down
Want to make you hurt like I hurt
If you'll let me...
Love you 
Let me...
Love you 
Stretch my arms out to the one

Who left me all alone alone alone

Kiss the face of all I hide
Loveydovey little twist of fate
I want to take you down
Want to make you hurt like I hurt
If you'll let me...
Love you 
Let me...
Love you 
warbly chanting
Let me...
Love you  <start> Share bright failing star
Careline
Careline
Careline
Careline
Riding these shelly shelly shelly umm
Share bright failing star <start> Fading in the afterglow
I wrinkle in my mind another fear
With ears beside the bedroom door
I close my eyes to keep inside the tears
The question of its worth won't iron out
It's tearing at the very thing I feel
I'm still Pablo at the park
Where's my Gloria when it's hard
How my mind has changed so much
But my heart's the same
He loves and then he hurts some more
It takes a generous man to lose something
Will I know what it means to see the pain through different eyes
But nothing seems to work this time
I'll live inside the burden till I've healed
I'm still Pablo at the park
I'll find Gloria when it's hard
How my mind has changed so much
But my heart's the same <start> Daylight won't stop the flashing lights
It feels like a thousand years have gone by without you
I miss someone like you
I wanna tell you secret things
My lips won't say anything that make sense
I wanna run to you
But my legs won't respond
I wanna know
Exactly what you are
If you come dance with me
I think you will like my moves
If you get next to me
I will have nothing left to prove
Here I am
There you are
Just inches away
But still too far
Look in my eyes
You'll see the reflection of you
In me On me my eyes
I have nothing left to prove
I wanna run to you
But my legs won't respond
I wanna know
Exactly what you are
If you come dance with me
I think you will like my moves
If you get next to me
I will have nothing left to prove
Here I am
There you are
There's nothing left between us
Nothing left between us
So dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me <start> I've been travellin' for so
many days
through' the valleys I have gone
I've been searchin' in so many
ways
for the things that I have
done
now I ask you  do you love me
and don't tell me any lies
Chorus
I will keep on ridin' in the
early morning light
'til they lay my body down
behind the conscience of every
man
is a thing we all must trust
as I look across the land
I see shadows in the dust
so how can you judge me
when you don't know me
I know you'll miss me when I'm
dead and gone
I will keep on ridin' in the
early morning light
'til they lay my body down
so close your eyes and you
will find me
i'll be watching over you
I will be with you you'll feel
my spirit
I know your faith will put you
through'
now I ask you  do you love
me...
by AleisterCrowley <start> Laurel was a girl i knew
Made of dirt and stone
Pretty hip in younger times
Now she sits alone
With a hundred thousand
Beat up architectural disasters
She calls homes
Beverly glen was pretty
All the rich boys loved her curves
She tried to get the credit sometimes
More than she deserved
Like those cheesy 's movies
She epitomized all things
We'd come to know
Beachwood was a boheme
From the sexy 's scene
Grew up east of w. hollywood
And somewhere in between
All the madness laurel puts up with but
Somehow always tolerates a scene
Nicols had a lot in common
With performing arts
A and r guys having cookouts
On her back with super stars
But she had some nasty habits and some
Roadwork to repair this drama queen
Sometimes beachwood yelled at laurel
On the terms of selling out
Then laurel yelled at beverly
For not knowing what life's about
With her trust fund friends and family
It felt just like an earthquake
When she'd shout
And silverlake just stood there
With her nose up in the air
Pushing up her horn rimmed glasses saying
I dont fucking care
Bout the drama all you idiots are buying
Selling leasing up there
San fernando was a struggling actor
Drove a deli truck to the sets of porno
Movies just trying to make a buck
While his pilot sits in escrow he dreams of
Dating beverly one day <start> Akaku nureta yubisaki de sai wa furare

Tonight can you get us a ride
Gotta make it through the tunnel
Got a meeting with a man on the other side
Hey Eddie this guy he's the real thing
So if you want to come along
You gotta promise you won't say anything
'Cause this guy don't dance
The word's been passed this is our last chance
We gotta stay cool tonight Eddie
'Cause man we got ourselves out on that line
And if we blow this one
They ain't gonna be looking for just me this time
And all we gotta do is hold up our end
Here stuff this in your pocket
It'll look like you're carrying a friend
And remember just don't smile
Change your shirt 'cause tonight we got style
Cherry says she's gonna walk
'Cause she found out I took her radio and hocked it
But Eddie man she don't understand
That two grand's practically sitting here in my pocket
Tonight's gonna be everything that I said
And when I walk through that door
I'm just gonna throw that money on the bed
She'll see this time I wasn't just talking
Then I'm gonna go out walking
Hey Eddie can you catch us a ride <start> The future holds a mystery
We talk but don't know
We hope but can't tell
We share but not all
The mystery holds fast
The future scary
It eludes us though we try to find meaning everywhere
We want to make plans
But to make another mistake
So difficult we care enough to try
So crazy
So we sit and wonder... <start> Follow me into my world
Let your worries fade with every step you take
Baby Whatcha' waiting for
Let the tango take control
Feel the music inside your soul 
My hand is out just grab a hold
Watch time fade away
My arms will keep you safe
It's just you and me
Dancing in this dream
Whatever you do don't wake me up
The feelings real won't let it
Stop no
Don't be afraid take my hand
Forget the world
Will you dance dance with me
Puedomos bailar eternamente
Now I have you next to me
Everything is how it should be
Baby don't fight the feeling
We're floating on the clouds
If I could I'd never come back down
Baby Let's just keep on groovin'
As time fades away
MY arms will keep you safe
It's just you and me
Dancing in this dream
Whatever you do don't wake me up
The feeling's real won't let it
Stop no
Don't be afraid take my hand
Forget the world
Will you dance dance with me
Puedomos bailar eternamente
Dance with me

For this moment in time

Dance with me
If only for one night
Don't be afraid take my hand
Forget the world
Will you dance dance with me
Puedomos bailar eternamente <start> I touch your lips and all at once the sparks go flying
Those devil lips that know so well when I am lying
And though I see the danger still flames go higher
I know I must surrender to your kiss of fire
Just like a torch you set my soul within me burning
I must go on along the road no returning
And though it burns me it turns me into ashes
My whole world crashes without your kiss of fire
I can't resist you what good is there in trying
What good is there denying you're all that I desire
Since first I kissed you my heart was yours completely
If I'm a slave then it's a slave I want to be...
Don't pity me don't pity me
Give me your lips  the lips you only let me borrow
Love me tonight devil take tomorrow
I know that I must have your kiss although it kills me
Though it consumes me your kiss of fire
I know that I must have your kiss although it kills me
Though it consumes me your kiss of fire <start> Wasted paralyzed
Beneath ten thousand layers of disguise
Built to save
What's left that has already worn away
Inside this vacant madeup plastic life
Only your heart survived for one last cry
One last cry one last cry
How long until it's my day to die
These broken animals useless as they are
These broken animals as useless as they are
These broken animals as useless as they are
Gravity gets to me
Holds me here without release
Now's the time to cut the line
Cross my heart I realize
Nights are long and hope is gone
God help me make it home
Make it home
Yeah make it home
This time yeah yeah yeah <start> There's something wrong there's a chill in the air
And the blood in my vein's running colder.
The Eastern sky is beginning to silver
And the words that you speak start to falter.
The seal is broken the oath has been crossed
In the house of the dead there's a taker.
Some say that this is the ultimate sin
When the spirit world turns to the alter.
There's been a kill in the spirit world
There's been a kill in the spirit world
Behold the dead clutching at fading hands out of reach forever
In glory die calls the voice from the void
You assasin has cursed every spectre
The seal is broken the oath has been crossed
And the house of the dead seeks the master
Stretching every muscle I wait for the end
And the kiss on the wind whispers murder 
There's been a kill in the spirit world
There's been a kill in the spirit world
There's been a kill in the spirit world
When heaven is closer it's pleasure and pain
Blood kill in the spirit world ah
Did ya see another in black
Is the blood in your veins running colder
If ya did then there's no turing back
As the spirit world turns to the alter.
The seal is broken the oath has been crossed
And the house of the dead seeks the master
Stretching every muscle I wait for the end
And a kiss on the wind whispers murder
There's been a kill in the spirit world
There's been a kill in the spirit world
Oh here it comes no no nooh oh
Your seal is broken the Eastern sky is beginning to silver oh oh oh.
There's something wrong there's a chill in the air ah.
You feel the evil I feel the evil.
Oh somebody whispers murder.
A kiss on the wind whispers murder <start> st century boy

I can't run this time
am I under a spell
fighting for my life
so far gone
can't turn it round
I feel buried alive
I am screaming out
Terror in your eyes your heart is racing
for the innocence we lost will not return
we know we can't go on
but we're still holding on
don't let me be the one to drag you down
In the silence
in the lonely night
when you're frozen with fear
when you're paralyzed
too delicate
your fragile mind
it's so hard to stay
in love with life
Terror in your eyes your heart is racing
for the innocence we lost will not return
we know we can't go on
but we're still holding on
don't let me be the one to drag you down
I was fighting at your side
a knowing partner in this crime
a beating heart a distant star
we lost all we were fighting for
all the hurt I kept within
I blamed myself for everything
for all the regret that remains
for all the pain
Terror in your eyes your heart is breaking
for the innocence we lost will not return
we know we can't go on
but we're still holding on
don't let me be the one to drag you down
to drag you down... <start> I was ridin' down that highway
Silver Harley by my side
When I thought I saw my lady
She was headed for the Berkely Hill
Pistol on her hip in case she needed a thrill
I don't believe it
Don't believe a word
I don't believe it
Don't believe a word
I said come on with me baby
Don't you want to ride with me
She put her hand into her bag now
Pulled out a half pint of red eye sauce
Sneakin' 'round the corner drinkin' whiskey from a jar
I don't believe it
Don't believe a word
I don't believe it
Don't believe a word <start> I wrap around you skin to skin
We sleep inside this curl
And after how alone we've been
It's like a whole new world
My heart had felt like years at sea
Freezing and afraid
Breathe the life back into me
Kiss me warm that way
Chorus
New world  big horizon
Open your eyes and see it's true
New world  across the frightening
Waves of blue
The old world had attractions
But hunger in my soul
Resumes and power plays
Where lust was just control
Roll me over slowly
Warm sunbaked sand
The ocean of my loneliness
Has carried me to land
Chorus
New world  sun is rising
We were wise just to see it through
The new world second chance
For me second chance for you
A mile or more of shoreline
And no one else around
And the way my heart is pounding now
I feel as if we've found <start> I'm wearin' thin
I couldn't tell you
The city I'm in
The streets and the buildings
The places I've been
Or where the star's go
When it's daylight again
Or where the time went.
Oh who can save me now
My life in the rear view
I'm running from Jesus
Don't know where I'm goin' to.
Got nothin' to lose I'm fightin' my demons
Been lookin' for someone like you
I've been lookin' for someone like you.
So sing me a song
I know all the words to
And I'll sing along
Could you be my savior
Been out here too long
And I've just been lookin' for somewhere to belong
Barely be holdin' on
So can you save me now
My life in the rear view
I'm running from Jesus
Don't know where I'm goin' to.
Got nothin' to lose I'm fightin' my demons
Been lookin' for someone like you
I've been lookin' for someone like you.
When the stars explode
And I'm all alone
When they start to see the smoke
When I'm finally burnin' out
I'll need someone to carry me home safe and sound.
My life in the rear view
I'm running from Jesus
Don't know where I'm goin' to.
But I got nothin' to lose I'm fightin' my demons
Been lookin' for someone like you
My life in the rear view
I'm running from Jesus
Don't know where I'm goin' to.
Got nothin' to lose I'm fightin' my demons
Been lookin' for someone like you
I've been lookin' for someone like you
I've been lookin' for someone like you. <start> Last night you fell asleep and left me awake to dream. One guitar in the corner I could hear the buzz of the strings. The heater was broken and it was ten degrees. If you were there you may have seen. It looked like I smoked when i breathed. And i lost my mind. Thinking about the rest of our lives. Then again now that i think maybe i was alseep. Last night you fell asleep and left me awake to think. That clock on the kitchen wall was serenading me. My half time pulse was relaxing me. I find if i'm worried its still worth singing. And i lost my mind. Thinking about the rest of oulives. Even if its just in my head I can still scream. Even if its am i can still scream. <start> 











Girl I never thought thought you would be my ex
'Cause what we had was so so deeper than sex
And I threw it all away for just one night
From the streets
To the sheets
Damn why the hell I cheat
Because I knew your favourite song was 'to the left' 
I want you back but I know there's nothing left 
And girl I swear its like you're haunting me inside
I'm doing everything I can to get you off my mind
Chorus
I'm doing everything I can to shake ya'
Still see ya face when I know you ain't there
You're like a ghost 
Ghost yeah
Ghost
All I wanna do is
Move on along
I gotta get my mind off you
But when you're still in love
Tell me why it took so long to do
You're like a ghost 
Ghost yeah
Ghost 
Ghost
Girl I never ever wanted to 
Imagine my life without you
Tell me why did I have to be such a fool
When you play with love You're gonna lose
Now where ever I go it feels like you're there with me
Even when I'm with her Its your face I see
Now all I want to do is get you off my mind girl
Wish I could go back in time And make everything right girl
Chorus
Move on along
I gotta get my mind off you
But when you're still in love
Tell me why it took so long to do
You're Like a Ghost 
Ghost yeah
Ghost 
Ghost
Eveywhere I go I still see ya face
Even though I know your still far away Why
Are you still on my mind 
Somebody Tell me what I gotta do
I really wanna get get over you






And all I wanna do is get you off my mind girl
Wish I could go back in time And make everything right
Chorus
Move on along
I gotta get my mind off you
But when you're still in love
Tell me why it took so long to do
You're like a ghost 
Ghost yeah
Ghost 
Ghost <start> Today I am your chariot horse
Tomorrow I'm your albatross
Suspended by the finest thread
No one could ever see
And when there's breathing in your ear
You put your faith in all you hear
But just how deep those feelings go
I have no way to know I'll never know
And if I was blind
Would you still be my eyes
Or hide everything you see
Pretending to care about me
When all the time
You're just wishing I'd fade away
You just can't bring yourself to
Say out loud the reasons why
You won't admit you realize
The promise you've been living by
Is just an empty shell
You'll come to bear it like a cross
And then start to tear it like frayed gauze
Though I'm ashamed to be afraid
I just can't help myself can't help myself
And if I was blind
Would you still be my eyes
Or hide everything you see
Pretending to care about me
When all the time
You're just wishing I'd fade away
You can't bring yourself to care about me
Please don't let me down
Why don't you care Why don't you care about me
'Cause I know all the time you're just wishing I'd fade away
You can't bring yourself to say <start> IF YOU COULD JUST GET YOUR MIND TOGETHER
THEN COME ALONG WITH ME
HOLD HANDS AND WATCH THE SUNRISE
FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA
BUT FIRST ARE YOU EXPERIENCED
WELL HAVE YOU EVER BEEN EXPERIENCED
WELL I HAVE I HAVE
I KNOW I KNOW
YOU'LL PROBABLY SCREAM AND CRY
YOUR LITTLE WORLD WON'T LET YOU GO
BUT WHO IN YOUR WORLD
ARE YOU TRYING TO PROVE
THAT YOU'RE MADE OUT OF GOLD
AND CAN'T BE SOLD
LET ME PROVE IT TO YOU
BEAUTIFUL MUTANTS I CAN HEAR IN THE DISTANCE
I THINK THEY'RE CALLIN' OUR NAME
MAYBE YOU CAN'T HEAR THEM BUT YOU WILL
IF YOU'LL TAKE HOLD OF MY HAND
OH NOT NECESSARILY BEAUTIFUL
BUT MUTATED <start> Censorship on the left and right
watch what you think
watch what you say
Enforced Orthodoxy
Enforced Orthodoxy <start> When the time comes I put my feet in the water
It's not as warm as I expect
Will I go down like a preachers son
Or will I come back up like a world war vet
Will I watch my brothers die
Speak true words into their lives
Will I hold them close and tell them why
The life they led was sacrifice
I don't know much
But I know about love
And how it hurts me to give up
It hurts me to give up
When the time comes I put my hands on the table
They are examined for what they are
A long life line that's been cut short
By the road the time the battle scars
What I would give to be back home
Where the sunsets over the water
Someone save me from these preachers sons
Save me from their daughters
Still I don't know much but
But I know about love
And how it hurts me to give up
It hurts me to give up
Why do we always say we're fine
When it's obvious we lie
Why don't we ever tell the truth
What do we got to lose
And I don't know much
But I know about love
And how it hurts me to give up
It hurts me to give up
And I don't know much
But I know about love
And how it hurts me to give up
It hurts me to give up <start> Where the earth recieves
The seeds from the sky
Where the ancient fill the newborn
With the breath of life
I will run once more
Before this body dies
I go running and I feel my muscles
Burning in the light
In our innocence the world is young
And strong beating at the center of perfection
Is this heart of mine
Feel the mountain move to hear our song
See the children stand where they belong
Follow in My Footsteps now
Follow in My Footsteps
Follow in My Footsteps
Follow in My Footsteps
I am the lightening streak
Across the brooding sky
I am witness to the spirit
of your sunrise
Call if your fevers rage
Is in need of tenderness
Feel that I am Feel that I am
Feel that I am the medicine
Feel the mountain move to hear our song
Hear the thunder rolling for our song
Call the wind
Call the rain
Call the first ones by their names
Call the moon
Call the sun
Call the blood back to my veins
Follow in my footsteps now
Follow in my footsteps
Follow in my footsteps
Follow in my footsteps
Feel the mountain move to hear our song
Hear the thunder rolling for our song
Call the wind
Call the rain
Call the first ones by their names
Call the moon
Call the sun
Call the blood back to my veins
Follow in my footsteps now
Follow in my footsteps
Follow in my footsteps
Follow in my footsteps
You can follow in my footsteps
Follow in my footsteps
Follow in my footsteps yeah <start> Synapse to synapse the possibility's thin.
I'm dressed up for free drinks and family greetings
On your wedding your wedding your wedding date.
The figures in plastic on the wedding cake that I took were so real.
And I kept a distance the complications cloud
The postcards and blip through fiber optics
As the girls with pigtails were running from little boys wearing bowties
Their parents bought and I'll catch you this time
Crashing through the parlor doors what was your first reaction
Screaming drunk disorderly I'll tell you mine.
You were the one but I can't spit it out when the date's been set.
The white routine to be ingested inaccurately.
Synapse to synapse the sneaky kids had attached
Beer cans to the bumper so they could drive
Up and down the main drag.
People would turn to see who's making the racket.
It's not the first time.
When they lay down the fish will swim upstream
And I'll contest but they won't listen
When the casualty rate's near  percent
And there isn't a pension for second best or for hardly moving
Crashing through the parlor doors what was your first reaction
Screaming drunk disorderly I'll tell you mine.
You were the one but I can't spit it out when the date's been set.
The white routine to be ingested inaccurately.
You were the one but I can't spit it out when the date's been set.
The white routine to be ingested inaccurately.
You were the one but I can't spit it out when the date's been set.
The white routine to be ingested inaccurately. <start> Tomorrow you will ask me if I do
Know that the sorrow will drop away
Like June from a flower in bloom
When you say I do
When you say I do
Tomorrow you will take me for your bride
And know that the grey skies will blow away
We're forever and I feel it inside
When you say I do
When you say I do
When you say I do <start> Time I always need more time
to figure what I've lost
to learn what I should find
Soon always hoping soon
I'll figure what to add
I'll learn what to remove
New sunrise new sunsets
New stories I haven't lived through yet
With you
It's always been you
There's never been good days
There's never been bad days without you
Choose I'm always made to choose
I'll figure what to share
I'll learn from what I've used
New sunrise new sunsets
New promises I haven't made quite yet
To you
It's always been you
there's never been good days
there's never been bad days without you
There's never been a day without you
There's never been a day
There's never been a night without you
With you
It's always been you
There's never been good days
There's never been bad days without you
It's always been you
There's never been those good days
There's never been those bad days
without you <start> Here comes the icecream man
Parked at the end of the road
With a swish of his magic whip
All the people in the party froze
Scribble chocolate chip umbrella and his white glove and
Shade from the sun was his intention
Here comes the icecream man bouncing up the hill
With a whip the pumpkin lit happy valley clumsy fill
All the lantern men marching down 'til dawn
Falling come before I'm gone
Something new
Something new
Something new
Here comes the icecream man
Parked at the end of the road
With a swish of his magic whip
All the people in the party froze
I was only twentyone
When I watched it on T.V.
I was racing in my heart
Something new
Something new
Something new
Something new
Something new
Something new
Something new
Something new
Something new <start> You're slicing my throat
You're breaking my heart
It could have been you and I
But now we've have fallen appart
Now I just sit
Alone and so cold
Feeling so far from home
But now you've got a new start
I don't think I can see you
I don't want to see you this way
I don't think I can see you again
Get me out of this place
Words can't describe
What I'm feeling inside
Torn between rage and tears
Now something has died
I don't think I can see you
I don't want to see you this way
I don't think I can see you again
Get me out of this place
When you're alone
Alone and so cold
Will you think back on me
And hope the storm will subside
I don't think I can see you
I don't want to see you this way
I don't think I can see you again
Get me out of this place <start> You make my life a mess
I feel like losing control
I know you gave your best
But for me baby not enough
I don't need your help
I'm right to find myself
So go find someone else
Don't bother me yet
Don't cry don't claim
I don't want you to stay
Oh no don't tell me who I am

Don't bother me yet
I hate me just for loving you
But hard choices make us better
I know I'm gonna solve my issues
That's why... why I'm letting you go
Forever
I don't need your help
I'm right to find myself
So go find someone else
Don't bother me yet
Don't cry don't claim
I don't want you to stay
Oh no don't tell me who I am 
Don't bother me yet
Don't fight don't blame
I just want that you walk away
So please don't tell me who I am 
Don't
I don't need your help
I'm right to find myself
So go find someone else
Don't bother me yet
Don't cry don't claim
I don't want you to stay
Oh no don't tell me who I am 
Don't bother me yet
Don't cry don't claim
I don't want you to stay
Oh no don't tell me who I am 
Don't bother me yet
Walk away
So please don't tell me who I am  <start> I've been drying for it
Bugging again
Now it won't bend
You've been frying for it
A mound of smack
Won't fill the crack
They always come in two's
All the space they always use
All the steps I've taken hidin'
Not sure now what's left inside me
So I've taken nappin's
All the things I left unspoken
The one that fits still got me joking
Hope it don't mean I'm still nappin'
I've been drying for it
Bugging again
Now it won't bend
You've been frying for it
A mound of smack
Won't fill the crack
They always come in two's
All the space they always use
All the steps I've taken hidin'
Not sure now what's left inside me
So I've taken nappin's
All the things I left unspoken
The one that fits still got me joking
Hope it don't mean I'm still nappin'
Can't face the unverified
The ones you left can trace me
Sky broke down that rainy sound
Gotta save me <start> Youve got a lot of
Tings to say about the
Big world and the
High skies so you
Walk a little in a
Long mile to be
Sure your eyes can see the
Right sights
I see a
Pale girl in a
Blue room with a
Pink dress and a
Wide smile I see a
Pale girl in a
Blue room with a
Pink dress and a
Wide smile
Youve got a little
Way to go before you
Find the knowledge that youre
Searching for so youll
Turn the big world
Upside down
To find the things that you
Never wanted
I see a
Pale girl in a
Blue room with a
Pink dress and a
Wide smile I need a
Pink smile on a
Dark night from the
Right girl to be
Sure its right
Youve got three million things to get mad about
Another hundred things to get glad about
Junk food
The whole world overs good as standing round
So baby twist and shout baby
Find out baby
Find out baby
Find out baby
So its April and the
Tings you say dont
Seem as certain as on
 when we
Kissed at midnight and a
Wee wee Bells had
Gave me courage for my
My heart to tell
I see a
Pale girl in a
Blue room with a
Pink dress and a
Wide smile I need a
Pink smile on a
Dark night from the
Right girl to be
Sure its right
Twist and shout
Come on come on baby <start> Daddy wants to take me for a ride
Daddy likes to drink when daddy drives
He's pounding on my door
He wants to come inside
Yeah daddy wants to take me for a ride
That's just the way it is when I'm left alone
Yeah that's when hell comes home
Mommy says that everything is fine
Mommy hides her bruises all the time
She always makes excuses but I know that she is lyin'
Mommy says that everything is fine
That's just the way it is he's evil to the bone
Mommy says that everything is fine
That's just the way it is when we're left alone
'Cause that's when hell comes home
I hear those footsteps on the stairs
Mom's bleeding out or maybe she don't care
We live in darkness and despair
I'm just so tired of being scared


Daddy's gonna get a big surprise
I'll put one right between his eyes
And in his blood I'll write his last goodbyes
Yeah daddy's gonna get a big surprise
That just the way it is he'll be deader then a stone
That's just the way it is he'll leave us both alone
That's just the way it is when hell comes home
Home <start> Every lie you've ever been told
The greatest story ever told
The circling bird of prey
Above a church on a Sunday
I wrap myself in you
A little something that I can cling to
Oh there you are my love
There you are my love
Rain down through my hands
Scream out like children
My heart is a church bell ringing
You are a shiver
The gold and the silver
My heart is a church bell ringing
Every lie you've ever been told
The greatest story ever told
The circling bird of prey
Above a church on a Sunday
Rain down through my hands
Scream out like children
My heart is a church bell ringing
You are a shiver
The gold and the silver
My heart is a church bell ringing
To the birds <start> I think I'm goin' back
To the things I learned so well in my youth
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth
Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win
I can recall a time
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift
Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears
And live my life instead of counting my years
Let everyone debate the true reality
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom all we're left
So catch me if you can
I'm goin' back
I can recall
I can remember
I can recall
I can remember
I can recall
I can remember <start> I'd be a fool to want to get to know you better
and I'd like to think I didn't know you well
I'd be worried if I knew you to the letter
so I've forgotten to remember how to spell
I don't want to know you blindfold
but I'd love to close my eyes and never know
What's goin' on in your heart
What's goin' on in your heart
The way you fool around with me girl
Can't you see how it's driving me mad
I'll never know how one as sweet as you girl
can find it in your heart to be so bad
I don't want to understand you
but I'd be happy with the chance not to know
What's goin' on in your heart
What's goin' on in your heart
What's goin' on in your heart
What's goin' on in your heart
There are places it's better not to go
The more you find the little that you know
Spaces it's better not to see
I wouldn't want to find out that there wasn't much to me
What's goin' on in your heart
What's goin' on in your heart
What's goin' on in your heart
Instead of being changing the weather
the weather stays exactly the same
Your sometimes now is maybe never
We may never have this sometime again
I don't want to know you inside out
but I'd love to be outside and not to know
What's goin' on in your heart
What's goin' on in your heart
What's goin' on in your heart
What's goin' on in your heart <start> You and your smile
Hold a strange invitation
Somehow it seems
We've shared our dreams
But where
Time after time
In a room full of strangers
Out of the blue
Suddenly you are there
Wherever I go
You're the glow of temptation
Glancing my way
In the gray of the dawn
And always your eyes
Smile that strange invitation
When you are gone
Where oh where have you gone
How long must I stay
In a world of illusion
Be where you are
So near yet so far apart
Hoping you'll say
With a warm invitation
Where have you been
Darling come in into my heart
Wherever I go
You're the glow of temptation
Glancing my way
In the gray of the dawn
And always your eyes
Smile that strange invitation
When you are gone
Where oh where have you gone
How long must I stay
In a world of illusion
Be where you are
So near yet so far apart
Hoping you'll say
With a warm invitation
Where have you been
Darling come in into my heart <start> They don't even have to kick down our doors
We let them in with a smile and a thank you
Media ingrained police state
Our fears create the cycle of reliance
And if you think for one fucking second
That they're not bleeding you for all their worth
Dig your grave now and save them the trouble
Tie yourself down to the fairy tales
The Holocaust will not be televised
That is unless it becomes marketable
In the market of fear
In the market of flesh and blood
Sold to you by the new improved Jack booted thugs
We've lost direction Senses rot away
Kneel and beg for safety
Just forget the whip marks on your back.
Around the world and in America specifically we are being subjected to a regularly scheduled program of fear and violence brought to us by a twin attack of the media and politicians who feed our fears on each other
Blacks fear whites whites fear anyone different and we all fear that which we do not know even
though according to many studies violent crime statistics are down
We keep adding more police and giving those police more and more power
We are trading our rights for the illusion of safety and in doing so we give the real criminals even more potency <start> Uno dos uno dos tres quatro
Hey now honey I'm about to begin
Hear the intention near me again
Been too impatient and I'm ready to spill
So tired of waiting for my turn to thrill
Trying to fly trying to get a break
A space to move and a movement to make
Triangle toes two loves continue
Why in the world I'm a circular girl
Ooh baby I feel the spin
Turning me 'round and 'round
Taking me out of town ooh I feel the spin
Messing me 'round and 'round
Making my madness drown
Hey now honey
My rotations set in to a driving dimension
Do it again hey I'm standing on top of the world
Grinning and spinning free as a bird
I'm dizzy from pressure I hold out for pleasure
A space to move and some music to make
I'm spellbound from watching your radio hula hips over me
Oh I'm a circular girl
Ooh baby I feel the spin
Turning me 'round and 'round
Taking me out of town ooh I feel the spin
Messing me 'round and 'round
Making my madness drown
Ooh I feel the spin
Taking me 'round and 'round
Throwing me out of bounds
Ooh I feel the spin throwing me around
I'm dizzy from pressure I hold out for pleasure
A space to move and some music to make
I'm spellbound from watching your radio hula hips over me
Oh I'm a circular girl
Ooh baby I feel the spin
Turning me 'round and 'round
Taking me out of town
Ooh I feel the spin
Messing me 'round and 'round
Making my madness drown
Ooh I feel the spin
Taking me 'round and 'round
Throwing me out of bounds
Ooh baby I feel the spin
Throwing me around
Driving me out of town <start> Pour me floatin' out to see
An opportunity that went by
Pour you now what you gonna do
Now what you gonna do You just cry
Pour me so blind I couldn't see
The flowers for the trees I don't know why
Pour you you split yourself in two
Now what you gonna do You just cry
I hear you come nearer
I hear you but I don't understand
I hear you come nearer
I hear you but I don't understand
Pour me floatin' out to see

For feel 
Strong at alley I'm gonna feel it now
I'm gonna feel it now sing say say <start> Let me hear let me hear the way you feel
I been gone so long I been riding on a spinning wheel
Flashin' and scratchin' just afeeling my pulse
Yellin' and screaming and pound on the wall.
Coast to coast I been travelin' and I got to get more
I been up all night just trying to make a score
Hustle it so fuss it just make it some chick
Pickin' on dolls and makin' that trick.
She's the piece of heart and I'm screamin' and kickin' it down
Faster and harder keep on drivin' it down the line
Lookin' for head and feelin' so free
Rubbin' my own in this ecstasy.
Tell me tell me tell me tell me if you see
It's the only way the only way that I want it to be
I can't explain it's just not fate
I got to keep on this time I just ain't late. <start> Pehli nazar mein kaisa jaadu kar diya
Tera ban baitha hai mera jiyaa

Baby i love u baby i love you baby i love you
Baby i love you so <start> Life is better than the days behind
What's mine is yours and what's yours is mine
No aggravation that we can't get through
A situation for the lucky few
And everyday is just a little more
Of time together to be happy for
I'm happy even when the times are rough
'Cause any time with you is good enough
When we love like we do
Love like we do
I don't believe in hatred anymore
I hate to think of how I felt before
When anger overwhelms your very soul
It's hard to realize you'll ever know
When we love like we do
Love like we do
Love like we do
Love like we do
Life is better than the days behind
What's mine is yours and what's yours is mine
No aggravation that we can't get through
A situation for the lucky few
When we love like we do
Love like we do
Love like we do
Love like we do
Love like we do
Love like we do
Love like we do
Love like we do
Oh love love
Oh oooh love love
Oooh <start> Everybody loves you when you're dead
And everyone is suddenly your dearest friend
Nobody talks no dirt about you
But life  it just goes on above your head
When you're dead
Everybody misses you when you're gone
They'll reminisce about you
When they hear your favorite song
They'll think that they said something wrong
They'll wonder if there was something they should've said
When you're gone
And I'm never gonna tell a lie
And I'm never gonna wear a tie
And I'm never gonna say goodbye
Goodbye
Life is so much better when you're dead
Conversation's easy when there's nothing to be said
But it can get a little lonesome
Maybe you should take along a friend
Like I said <start> Railway tracks
Mountain tops
Frozen fields
A church a dog
Icicles
On a fence
That reminds me
Of my heart
And you're in my head
Only in my head
Roadhouse
Parking lots
Factories
Stones and rocks
Metal sky
Crispy air
I'm halfway gone
I'm halfway there
Villages
In white disguise
Lakes as green
As your eyes
Railway tracks
Mountain tops
I'm breaking through
These tunnel walls
And you're in my head
Only in my head
I'm waving goodbye
Only in my mind <start> Music Pat Johnson  Andy Prietto
Lyrics Pat Johnson
Another notch upon the drainpipe repressed but not extinct
A forced pry with nothing left but blame i i will not
Submit to numbness
Gripping throatless curled in agony
Fight the damaged one i will not submit fight the damaged one i will not submit
Fight'fight'fight'fight'fight' fight'fight'fight'fight'fight'
With five minutes so much change
I can never be the same
Fight
Shadows burnt on flesh
A plankless walk over chanceless bruised syntax
I won't submit my fucking life to this <start> I can't sleep nights
Wishing you were here beside me
Can't help feeling
That's way it ought to be
You know we could run  away
And i couldn't bear to hear
The things they'd say
Oh no
Chorus
Baby let's pretend
That tonight could live forever
If we close our eyes
And believe it might come true
Baby let's pretend
We could always be together
But for now just let me
Spend the night with you
Somehow someday
Things are gonna be so different
Don't cry
Some way
I promise it will be all right
So now that we're all alone
I couldn't bear
To ever take you home
Oh no
Chorus
Baby let's pretend
We could always live together
But for now just let me
Spend the night with you
So take me now
My love can't wait
We're almost there now darlin'
Darlin' hold me hold me
Hold me
Chorus
Baby let's pretend
We could always live together
But for now just let me
Spend the night with you <start> If I end up alone
Across the barren sand dunes
I see my true self
I am burning inside for you
Live in a curse
lost in desire
your touch
I can not hurt
I can not cry I can not I am numb
Don't say it
Don't say it loud
Don't say it
Don't say it now
Oh I know I came in here myself
To here and ever after
Oh you sent me a kiss with a spell
I fear the ever after
A sting to the eyes
The trace here of you
Still has bite
It can weaken the legs
buckle knees
In a fight <start> You never feel it until it's too late
You never see it coming
It hurts my head when you tell me that everything's alright
I've tried to write something meaningful but I feel I've lost my stride
Can't think of anything witty or flattering tonight
You lie to me and I'm getting bored of this stupid conversation
It's no fucking interrogation so quit while you're behind
Open your eyes and look outside
It's gonna fuck you up and leave an empty shell
Dressing better is a bigger tell
Your best lipstick for annihilation
I've tried to write something meaningful but I feel I've lost my stride
Can't think of anything witty or flattering tonight
You lie to me and I'm getting bored of this stupid conversation
It's no fucking interrogation so quit while you're behind
Keep on closing closing your eyes
Keep on closing closing your eyes
Keep on closing closing your eyes
Keep on closing closing your eyes
I've tried to write something meaningful but I feel I've lost my stride
Can't think of anything witty or flattering tonight
You lie to me and I'm getting bored of this stupid conversation
It's no fucking interrogation so quit while you're behind
I write some words on a scrap of paper
Tied it tightly round my little finger
Can't think of anything that would make it worth the fight
Falling slowly with the little numbers
Every time I feel like hating someone
Can't think of anyone that would make it worth the fighta <start> Kuddel Daddel Du kommt von der Reise
Kuddel Daddel Du jumpt an Land
Kuddel Daddel Du piekfein in Schale
Kuddel Daddel Du ist braungebrannt
Kuddel Daddel Du will nach St. Pauli
Kuddel Daddel Du da ist was los
Kuddel Daddel Du sieht schon die Lichter
Kuddel Daddel Du fhlt sich famos
Und Kuddel knnte die ganze welt umarmen
er atmet tief durch und singt das schne Lied
Was kann die Welt dafr
da ich sie liebe
ich lieb sie nur wegen dir
was kann denn ich dafr
da die Welt so gro ist
aber heut Nacht mein Schatz
geh ich vor Anker bei dir
Kuddel Daddel Du trifft alte Freunde
Kuddel Daddel Du wirds warm ums Herz
Kuddel Daddel Du spendiert ne Runde
Kuddel Daddel Du sorgt fr Kommerz
Und alle trinken auf das Wohl von Kuddel
Kuddel Daddel Du sprt festen Boden
Kuddel Daddel Du stampft den Beat
Kuddel Daddel Du ist musikalisch
Kuddel Daddel Du summt'n Lied
Und um was fr ein Lied mag es sich
hierbei wohl handeln 
Kuddel atmet tief durch und singt das schne Lied
Was kann die Welt dafr
da ich sie liebe
ich lieb sie nur wegen dir
was kann denn ich dafr
da die Welt so gro ist
aber heut Nacht mein Schatz
geh ich vor Anker bei dir
Kuddel Daddel Du sieht seine Liebste
Kuddel Daddel Du gert in Braus
Kuddel Daddel Du sie trgt ein Baby
Kuddel Daddel Du war lang nicht zu Haus
Und Kuddel wei nicht ob er weinen oder lachen soll
aber dann besinnt er sich eines besseren
er spendiert noch eine Runde und er singt noch einmal
Was kann die Welt dafr
da ich sie liebe
ich lieb sie nur wegen dir
was kann denn ich dafr
da die Welt so gro ist
aber heut Nacht mein Schatz
geh ich vor Anker bei dir
Wer hat dem blonden Hans sein Toupet geklaut
wer hat der feschen Lola die Frisur versaut
oh  da gibts nur einen und der heit Kuddel
Was kann die Welt dafr
da ich sie liebe
ich lieb sie nur wegen dir
was kann denn ich dafr
da die Welt so gro ist
aber heut Nacht mein Schatz
geh ich vor Anker bei dir <start> Over the skies of Bethlehem appeared a star
While angels sang to lowly shepherds
Three wise men seeking truth they traveled from afar
Hoping to find the child from heaven
And falling on their knees they bow before the humble Prince of Peace
We bring an offering of worship to our King
No one on earth deserves the praises that we sing
Jesus may you receive the honor that you're due 
O Lord I bring an offering to you
The sun cannot compare to the glory of your love
There is no shadow in your presence
No mortal man would dare to stand before your throne
Before the Holy One of heaven
It's only by Your blood it's only through Your mercy Lord I come
I bring an offering of worship to my King
No one on earth deserves the praises that I sing
Jesus may you receive the honor that you're due 
O Lord I bring an offering to you
I bring an offering of worship to my king
No one on earth deserves the praises that we sing
Jesus may you receive the honor that you're due 
And O Lord we bring an offering to you
We bring an offering to you
We are an offering to you 
 we are an offering to you Jesus

 
We are an offering of worship to our king
No one on earth deserves the praises that we sing
Jesus may you receive the honor that you're due 
O Lord we bring an offering to you
O Lord we bring an offering
Jesus my king  an offering to you
An offering to you  we bring an offering to you
 we are an offering to you
Oh Lord unto the King <start> Honey I saw you yesterday
On my way home
Baby I craved for you today
So I decided to phone
So why don't we get together soon
And er get on our own
Just think of what me and you could do
If we get on our own
If we could get on our own
If we could get on our own
Honey I saw you again today
And I er liked what I saw
So why don't meet tonight
Then I could er see a bit more
So how's about we get together soon
Well why be alone
Just think of what me and you could do
If we get on our own
If we could get on our own
If we could get on our own
Just think of it
Me and you
Us together
Yes just we two
Think of all the things
That me and you could do
If we get on our own
If we could get on our own
If we could get on our own
Just me and you
Ah <start> All dressed in black
Eyes of attack
Coming with one hand in pocket
To take from me
Sin in the eyes I see
Sin is nice of me
Nothing left for me
Reality
Forget it
You have messed up
Can't do anything
And I have messed up
Can't do anything
You're just a fuckup
I'm just a fuckup
We're just two fuckups
At least we're fucked
Up together
So sad to see you go
I said to myself you
Know
So sad to see a mind
Disappear through
Time
Lunacy's an argued
Taste
I guess there's no time
To waste
Oh passing times it's a
Passing phase
Reality
Forget it
You have messed up
Can't do anything
And I have messed up
Can't do anything
You're just a fuckup
I'm just a fuckup
We're just two fuckups
At least we're fucked
Up together
We are two fuckups
You have messed up
Can't do anything
And I have messed up
Can't do anything
You're just a fuckup
I'm just a fuckup
We're just two fuckups
At least we're fucked
Up together
Together together
Together together...on

Happy New Year <start> I can barely feel my fingers anymore
Since the continental drift 
How quickly things can shift in front of me
All this ice flow and drift 
To know you was a gift 
Before the continental drift 
How quickly things can shift 
And now Antarctica
It was always tshirt weather 'round you
Hot wind blowing through your hair
It was always topdown weather with you
So  somehow
And now Antarctica
Antarctica
I can sense the coldest shoulder in the world
Where's the thermostat controls your soul

No amount of insulation will protect me
I've got frostbite from my head to my toes
I sensed that you were miffed 
I bought a thousand gifts 
I sometimes ask what if 
In Antarctica
It was always Acapulco around you
Temps kept rising somehow
It was always  weather
Sunlight glaring somehow
And now Antarctica
It was always Acapulco around you
Temps kept rising somehow
It was always  weather
Sunlight glaring somehow
And now Antarctica
Antarctica
It was always tshirt weather around you
 somehow
It was always topdown weather
Hot wind blowin' through your hair
And now Antarctica
It was always tshirt weather around you
It was always topdown weather around you
And now Antarctica <start> Im a lone wolf in a cage
Lost my partner to a lie
Like a bird with broken wings yeah
Its impossible to fly
I tried to live for two
But only trust in one
Is there nothing that we can do
Are we truly done
Every day we do or die
As were sailin across the sky
Now were comin home
On these blades of glory
Settin fire to the ice
Is the dream that keeps us alive
Now were comin home
On these blades of glory
Could this be the end
of our mythic story
I dont know what to say
I dont know where to turn
All I know is if I stay
Ooh this ice it sure can burn
A man whos scared of truth
Can only trust in lies
A boy whos scared to dream
Can never touch the sky oh yeah
Every day we do or die
As were sailin across the sky
Now were comin home
On these blades of glory
Settin fire to the ice
Is the dream that keeps us alive
Now were comin home
On these blades of glory
Today is the first chapter
Of our mythic story
Well never part
On these blades of glory
And well cross our hearts
On these blades of glory
What do you say
Tonight we celebrate
By going out our way yeah
Ooooh lets go all the way yeah
Its our calling
Every day we do or die
As were sailin across the sky
Now were comin home
On these blades of glory
Settin fire to the ice
Is the dream that keeps us alive
Now were comin home
On these blades of glory
Blades of glory
Well go all night
Til we finish the story
Now were comin home
On these blades of glory
The dream is alive
And well never be sorry
Now were comin home
On these blades of glory
 <start> September ' I was  inches high
Mom said someday I would have
A bad ass mother G.I. Joe
For your little minds to blow
I still got beat up after class
Now I'm big and important
One angry dwarf
And  solemn faces
Are you
If you want to see me
Check your papers and your T.V.
Look who's tellin' who what to do
Kiss my ass goodbye
Don't give me that bullshit
You know who I am
I'm your nightmare little man
Vic you stole my lunch money.
Made me cry.
Jane remember second grade
Said you couldn't stand my face
Rather than kiss me you said
You'd rather die
Now I'm big and important
One angry dwarf
And  solemn faces
Are you
If you want to see me
Check your papers and your T.V.
Look who's tellin' who what to do
Kiss my ass goodbye
You'll be sorry one day
Yes you will yes you will
You shouldn't push me around
Cause I will yes I will
You will be sorry when I'm big
Yes you will be sorry <start> One two
Devil in the kitchen
Snake in the grass
Sat naked at the table
And filled his glass
He said Take my hand
Your answer will be here
Take my hand
And walk this way out of here
There was a fire in the basement
Claimed your youth
Did you make your choices
Based on truth
And the man he bought the land
In his dying bed
The angel voices
Were ringing in his head
They say Can you get the truth from a liar
Can it keep you warm without the fire
The walking blues was laughing I heard him say
The answer is inside your skull ring
Incomprehensible
Well my good book tells me I don't need ya
I can get the honey without the sting
Don't need more than fear well it don't mean a thing
The answer's right inside my skull ring <start> I know it's wrong and I'm sure you don't appreciate my tone
I just get so mad
I'm not afraid as I tell myself I am
I love to be wanted but all I want is to be loved
Is that so much to be remembered
Never swept under the rug
They say the soul don't die
But mine's been dead for my whole life
And I wouldn't trade it for anything
There will be a day when I sadly outlive all my useful tricks
And when I look back I want to know
that we were more than just a fad
I love to be wanted but all I want is to be loved
Is that so much to be remembered
Never swept under the rug
They say the soul don't die
But mine's been dead for my whole life
And I wouldn't trade it for anything
Cult chanted x
I love to be wanted but all I want is to be loved
Is that so much to be remembered
Never swept under the rug
They say the soul don't die
But mine's been dead for my whole life
And I wouldn't trade it for anything
I wouldn't trade it for anything
I wouldn't trade it for anything <start> I believe in karma I believe in soul
I believe in heaven I believe in rock and roll
I believe in wrestlin' I believe in sleep
I know I ought to quit now I believe I'm in too deep
I believe in gangster rap gays and geeks and ghosts
I believe that we doubt up all the things that we hate the most
I believe that we all learn to love before we get through
I believe in letting people do what people do
I believe in everything

Yes I do
I believe in everything
I believe in everything everyone everybody hey hey hey

Tell me what you want
I believe you
I believe that all my friends
Really are my friends
I believe that jesus christ
Died for all of my sins
I know that the devil gets
Exactly what he's due
I believe in the truckers
I believe in my girlfriend too
People I believe in everything

Yes I do
I believe in everything
I believe in everything everyone everybody hey hey hey

Tell me what you want
I believe you
I believe in people
White and black and blue
I believe in people
That believe the same way I do because
Because I know that some day
Love is going to shine its own way through
I believe in letting people
Do what people do
I believe in everything

Yes I do
I believe in everything
I believe in everything everyone everybody hey hey hey

Tell me what you want
I believe it <start> I'll fight your war
Promise not to lose
Give in to circumstance
Not gonna prove to you
Learn of patience worth to you
Many teacher no student
We go by name not by rank
Too many sighs incompetent
There's no bond between some men
A concept already known
What little time you try to give
A big cheer for you alone
Relax and try again
Broke off broke up and spent
He's choking in left field
Can't tell this place is doomed
Now no place like home
Doomed now
No place like home <start> 
With flu
I dream of you
In light as blue as neon when it's blue
Past visions of rolling hills
In movie stills
A panoramic stew
Above the scientific
Element content
We spy the view

A fever's brought me close to you
In ways we can not be
A fever's brought me close to you
In ways we can not be
Even in memory
Sublime
In double time
We climb to where convention swerves and leans
'Coupleabeers
In a tent by sears
By a giant plastic nativity scene
In color dogs endure
I'm sure
The light you've given me is green

I mouth petitions
Oh those soft renditions
Of the ones I've come to lean on
For you
Again in blue
And straightening a photographic dawn
May I experience
The sense of
Where I dream you when I'm gone
 <start> From the burning fires
The flame of intuition
The leader of the Zodiac he screams
The god of new beginnings
The lord of war and killings
The Mars ruled Aries rules my dreams
The rise of swords precedes Aries dreams
The flags and the march and the colors of the battle call
I have done more than they have dreamed
Protect your world and never let it fall
What's the point of waiting
What's your conscience saying
The ram never waits for you to move
I call it like I see it
No I'm not gonna take it
Oh Lord I got something to prove
The rise of swords precedes Aries dreams
The flags and the march and the colors of the battle call
I have done more than they have dreamed
Protect your world and never let it fall <start> I'll never understand

Who was that standing in the rain
If only I could if only I could remember
What he said

Happy the man
With the face that smiles
Happy the man
With the face that smiles
But it has to have a name

How does he look so safe
He'll never he'll never turn away
Happy the man
He'll never turn away
Happy the man
Happy the man
Happy the man <start> Opium of the people
TV now the modern chapel
Gave it up for a walkabout
Skyline compared to pyramids
Lame backdrop for a junkyard
Compacting cars with a grand machine
Spraybomb ya junkie
Spraybomb it's lovely
Spraybomb your creed after creed after creed
Spraybomb it's lovely
Spraybomb graffiti
Spraybomb eclipse over lips
Yes lovegun
Licence age is bitter wisdom
Lifespan you swing near dead
Exploited in maturities apron
My cologne doesn't kill my breath
Fashion mask don't kill my emptiness
Raise my voice to teenage media
Sellout sellout sellout sellout sellout
Spraybomb ya junkie
Spraybomb it's lovely
Spraybomb your creed after creed after creed
Spraybomb it's lovely
Spraybomb graffiti
Spraybomb eclipse over lips
I wish I'd never heard them speak
Love or lie
Kings live in the wrecking yard
Happily raping cars for parts
Raise a shrine to another mans grave
Stars burn brighter in the graveyard
Stars burn brighter in the graveyard
Spraybomb ya junky
Spraybomb it's lovely
Spraybomb your creed after creed after creed
Spraybomb ya junky
Spraybomb it's lovely
Spraybomb your creed after creed after creed
Spraybomb graffiti
Spraybomb it's lovely
Spraybomb eclipse over lips
I wish I'd never heard them speak
Love or lie <start> Despair and Deception Love's ugly little twins
Came aknocking on my door I let them in
Darling you're the punishment for all of my former sins
I let love in
I let love in
The door it opened just a crack but Love was shrewed and bold
My life flashed before my eyes it was a horror to behold
A lifesentence sweeping confetti from the floor of a concrete hole
I let love in
I let love in
I let love in
I let love in
Well I've been bound and gagged and I've been terrorized
And I've been castrated and I've been lobotomized
But never has my tormenter come in such a cunning disguise
I let love in
I let love in
I let love in
I let love in
O Lord tell me what I done
Please don't leave me here alone
Where are my friends
My friends are gone
O Lord tell me what I done
Please don't leave me here alone
Where are my friends
My friends are gone
I let love in
I let love in
So if you're sitting all alone and hear aknocking at you door
and the air is full of promises well buddy you've been warned
Far worse to be Love's lover than the lover that Love has scorned
I let love in
I let love in
I let love in
I let love in
I let love in
I let love in
I let love in
I let love in <start> Ich fahre mit dem Auto durch die Gegend
Und denke ber alle Dinge nach
Sie hat mich heut' verlassen
Ich kann's noch gar nicht fassen
Kann nicht vergessen was sie zu mir sprach
Ich gehe jetzt und komme nie mehr wieder
Ich kann nicht mehr ich mu hier endlich raus
Ich habe schon 'nen neuen Freund
Von dem hab' ich schon lang getrumt
Darum ist es mit uns beiden aus
Jetzt fahr' ich mit dem Auto durch die Gegend
Die Welt saust schwarz und grau an mir vorbei
Durch meine Trnen seh' ich
Nur noch sehr wenig
Doch das ist mir wirklich Einerlei
Der Baum vor mir taucht pltzlich aus dem Nichts auf
Doch ich rei' das Steuer nicht herum
Ich fahre jetzt dagegen
Und gebe Gas deswegen
Wenn sie mich nicht will bring' ich mich um <start> Oh this burden
I cant bear its weight anymore
Oh this everlasting battle
Ive grown tired and yearn for sleep
Once more again I raise my voice
To bleed the symphony of Sol
Once more again I raise my sword
To save the garden of the lord
Once more again I call the knights
To guard the portal to our world
Once more again I raise my sword
To save the garden of the...LORD
Dryaden tanzen lngst nicht mehr
Verschleiert weint das Marmorbild
Lilienglanz versinkt in Schlaf
Und Sommerblten sterben
My goldfairies sleep...in the garden
My goldfairies dream...in the garden
All tunes starve to grey
...in the garden of slumber
Auf goldgetrnktem Boden
Wo Menschen Gtter sind
Wo Bltenstrme toben
Brennt still das Zauberkind
Es ist ein Hauch von Leben
Ein warmer Feuerschein
Ich will ihm alles geben
Mein herz als Brot und Wein
Die Welt wird es verschlingen
Sein weies Kleid wird rot
Mit blutgetrnkten Schwingen
Umhllt mich dann der Tod
I dance towards a marble sky
In restless search for fairytunes
On silent ruins of human dreams
My tears fall as endless rain
I danced through spheres of dying tunes
With empty hands I must return
I set ablaze my chaliceheart
This death is my rebirth in tears <start> No restrictions
Unmade roads leading nowhere
That's what I want
To break the shackles and forget them
No one around to tell me where I belong
This independence is making me stronger
A sea of trees
Surrounds me
Gone for good
Building up my sanity
By unlearning
Renewed for good
Learning to live
By unlearning
Resurrected from absence
Reborn on the run
Arisen from the mist
Cherished by the sun
How can a single thought of bliss
Redeem my time in the abyss
Resurrected from absence
Reborn on the run
Arisen from the mist of fearsaturated sun
How can a single deed
Give me all I need
Unlearning to give my life away <start> I see people walking down the street
Got their heads so high
They can't see their feet
With their blinders on
They walk the endless mile
Working for that perfect life of style
But I'm lookin' for a better way
Something in my life
Nothing ever seems to satisfy
I reach my hands out to the sky
And I'll be climbing for the rest of my life
I'll be climbing for the rest of my life
I'm still climbing oh yeah
I'll be climbing for the rest of my life
I hear people talkin' all day long
Got their minds made up
They can't do no wrong
With their hearts so cold
They never ever feel
Losing touch with everything that's real
But I'm lookin' for a better way
Something in my life
Nothing ever seems to satisfy
I reach my hands out to the sky
And I'll be climbing for the rest of my life
I'll be climbing for the rest of my life
I'm still climbing ooo yea
I'll be climbing for the rest of my life
Oh in the darkest hour
Feel I'm sinkin' low
But I'll reach higher
Now I'm lookin' for a better way
Something in my life
Nothing ever seems to satisfy
I reach my hands out to the sky
And I'll be climbing
Oh I'm still climbing
Oh yeah
I'll be climbing for the rest of my life
I'm still climbing ooo yea
I'll be climbing for the rest of my life
I'll be climbing for the rest of my life
I'll be climbing for the rest of my life
I'm still climbing
I'll be climbing for the rest of my life
I'll be climbing for the rest of my life <start> Mama said Watch out son Skinny top heavy bottom
Oh I see it's easy to tell that girl is putting you through hell
Papa said my turn step outside you gotta learn
women and girls will make your head turn
but Daddy I'm doing fine without her
Love is unkind 
Couple comes up to me
they're in love it's plain to see
take a step back and start to laugh
you know love can never last
Love comes in then falls out
that's when you learn what's it about ... Love is unkind 
I wanna talk about love I wanna talk about love
because all my life I've been told that love will keep you together
love is all you need and all you need is love
love is the answer
and I remember the time when my mama sat me down
and she looke me in the eye the little peabone with a smile
and her smile turned into a laugh and her laugh turned into a cackle
and you know what she said you know what she said 
Love is unkind  It don't like nobody it don't got no friends
Ladies and gentlemen I'm gonna prove my point tonight
I'm gonna tilt my head up to the sky
I'm gonna look at the good lord in the eye
and if the good lord wants to strike me down tonight
and I haven't found my true love if I haven't found her
if I haven't found my true love then baby....
if the good Lord wants to strike me down tonight
and I haven't found my true love
I'M GONNA DIE A HAPPY MAN  <start> City swallows trees
And I am responsible
'Cause I am indifferent to these things
I got blood on my windshield
And what must be hundreds of movies in my head
'Cause I like the glow of the screen
Excuses not to speak and darkness surrounding me
And the way the sun feels
When you step out in it after the credits
And float back to your car on cinema air
And please tell the whole world I am here
Here to be their hero
With a perfect body and straight teeth
And strings swelling every time I blink
With a perfect body and straight teeth
And strings swelling every time I blink
On the big screen with my big dreams
'Cause you know I am the drama king <start> Amigos fieles hoy
alientan con su canto
nos vemos sin mirarnos
te encuentro saltando a mi lado
otra vez 
Sentimos casi igual
sabemos en que pensamos
Dios quiera que el destino
nos lleve caminando siempre a la par.
Amigo con vos esquivo el temor
no hay nada mejor que un pacto
de amistad respeto y lealtad en el corazn
vamos a formar nuestra comunidad.
Recuerdos de otros tiempos
componen nuevos das las huellas
que nos guan escritas en nuestra
esperanza estarn.
Amigo con vos esquivo el temor
no hay nada mejor que un pacto
de amistad respeto y lealtad en el corazn
vamos a formar nuestra comunidad ya  Hoy  <start> It's the good life full of fun seems to be the ideal
Yes the good life lets you hide all the sadness you feel
You won't really fall in love 'cause you can't take the chance
So be honest with yourself don't try to fake romance
Yes the good life to be free and explore the unknown
Like the heartaches when you learn you must face them alone
Please remember I still want you and in case you wonder why
Well just wake up kiss that good life goodbye
Please remember I still want you and in case you wonder why
Well just wake up kiss that good life goodbye <start> First thing I remember was asking papa why
For there were many things I didn't know.
And daddy always smiled and took me by the hand
Saying someday you'll understand.
Well I'm here to tell you now each and every mother's son
That you better learn it fast you better learn it young
'Cause someday never comes.
Well time and tears went by and I collected dust.
For there were many things I didn't know.
When daddy went away he said try to be a man
And someday you'll understand.
Well I'm here to tell you now each and every mother's son
That you better learn it fast you better learn it young
'Cause someday never comes.
And then one day in April I wasn't even there
For there were many things I didn't know.
A son was born to me. Mama held his hand
Sayin' someday you'll understand.
Well I'm here to tell you now each and every mother's son
That you better learn it fast you better learn it young
'Cause someday never comes
Ooo someday never comes.
Think it was September the year I went away
For there were many things I didn't know.
And still I see him standing tryin' to be a man
I said someday you'll understand.
Well I'm here to tell you now each and every mother's son
That you better learn it fast you better learn it young
'Cause someday never comes
Ooo someday never comes. <start> Hay hombres que se atreven
Hombres que se quejan y
Est el dueo de la pelota de hoy
Ese que maneja los riesgos de mi tierra
Mis vueltos y mi produccin
Hay vboras que curan hay frases que te matan
Y est la telaraa de lo que qued
Pero en la punta del rbol ms alto haremos nidos
Y buscaremos otro viento mejor
Uno que nos devuelva la voz
Y habr estrellas como huellas del destino
Del camino de los que siempre gritaron y nadie escuch
De los que siempre buscaron un viento mejor
Hay villas de emergencia
Emergencias en mi gente
Y no hay ni un solo cargo que venga a hablar hoy
Y as en la punta del rbol
Y no habr que pagar despus
Las deudas de no s quin
Locura de pensar a un rbol gigante como mi lugar
Ms loco voy a andar
Si cambio ilusiones por la cuenta del bienestar <start> I drifted around knowing
And I drifted around knowing
Got the nerver got the feel that we're going to die
Ever learn ever feel that your going to die
Ever learn got to feel that we're going to die
We're all going to die
We're all going to die
We're all going to die
We're all going to die
Got to learn how to feel when your going to die
Got's to learn ever feel how your going to die
Got to learn how to feel when your going to die
Got to learn how to feel
I drifted around knowing
We're all going to die
We're all going to die
We're all going to die
We're all going to die
The rhythm in the riddle
Put the pedal to the metal
Is the middle of the puzzle
Put the peddle to the metal
Is the rhythm of the riddle <start> Living in a town that's on the brink of being a city
Won't satisfy my soul though the women may be pretty
My mind is made up
I have had enough
I'm leaving here today
Shops walls pavements streets
Is all that I could find
From head to foot and toe to eye
I looked till I was blind
No matter what turns up
I'm leaving here
This place ain't good enough
You might think that I'm being funny
Just 'coz I won't spend my money here
Well let me tell you I have no obection
Except that I can find correction
Everywhere I go
Jump high in the sky unless you're feeling bitter
About walking down an empty street
With gutters full of litter
My mind is made up
I have had enough
I'm leaving here today hey hey
I'm going away
You might think that I'm being funny
Just 'coz I won't spend my money here
Well let me tell you I have no objection
Except that I can find correction
Everywhere I go
jump high in the sky unless you're feeling bitter
About walking down an empty street
With gutters full of litter
My mind is made up
I have had enough
I'm leaving here today hey hey
My mind is made up
I have had enough
I'm leaving right away hey hey
I'm going away
Getting out of this place
I know I've said it before
But this time I mean it
I'm leaving
Packing my bags and going away
Getting out of this place <start> I lost myself in a bottle of gin and I'm wasted all the time.
One more shot for all my fucking failures.
I might just end my life.
And I think if I'm not mistaken
I may be breaking down.
I might be acting a fool and I'm breaking the rules but I truly believe that I'll never be cool.
I feel neglected
Young and reckless now.
I'm so crazy
But I just may be
The type of personality that compliments your style.
And I'm just waiting
For the day you'll save me
From myself 'cause I can't help the way I feel for you.
For you.
I found myself in a world of hurt and I'm lookin' for a friend.
The devil called me up with a proposition
Forgave me for my sins.
And I don't know but I've been told that rock'n'roll is dead.
I've been losing myself but I never have dealt with the problems I've had not needing the help.
I feel neglected
I'm young and reckless now.
I'm so crazy
But I just may be
The type of personality that compliments your style.
And I'm just waiting
For the day you'll save me
From myself 'cause I can't help the way I feel for you.
For you.
I feel like I'll be okay and
I hope I can just maintain it.
I will not let myself become my problem.
And I know that If I can try it
I might one day really find it.
I will not stop until I truly solve this.
Solve this
I'm so crazy
But I just may be
The type of personality that compliments your style.
And I'm just waiting for the day you'll save me
From myself 'cause I can't help the way I feel for you.
For you.
I'm so crazy
But I just may be
The type of personality that compliments your style.
And I'm just waiting
For the day you'll save me
From myself 'cause I can't help the way I feel for you.
For you
For you
For you.
For you. <start> I won't be so what will we wait
and our reasons sew away
then we crawl out of our holes into the open air
take us so long we cried away
in corners they may feel
but oh no what I see
but I know it's not fair
baby say you love me
and don't leave her waiting
by the any one word
you call me up and say a lie
so child take'em I call to come again
and now I'm watching you
why and it's all into the old way back
we swing our hands and hope
that everyone comes back
I don't believe you're saying
I don't believe what you're doing here
tell me good intentions
and what you hang from your tree
I don't believe what you said
but walkin by my door
I find all these smilin' faces
locked up and tied
oh the rhythm an old song I heard
wild and afraid I'll sail away again
memories fall
hey we feel so cold
I really thought it was cool winter day
not to buy
we buy the air down the wall
say this one time
we all they could do it for a week or more
then they wait and buy it
I don't care no matter what
I will mend me one too
pour the soul out in an open page
crushed by our memories
so my happiness fell away
and tore my mind and darkness fell here <start> Sometimes I feel like a man that has two broken hands
All of this thrown at me sinking me neck deep in sand
They can't kill me no more I don't know what to say 'cause it's lies
Lies
Underneath all this they should see the man that I am
All of my life I've been tried and then persecuted
They can't kill me no more I don't know what to say 'cause it's lies
Lies
Underneath all this they should see the man that I really am
I've been tried and persecuted
Lies
Undenied
Cold shackles inches from the knife
I defy
What's mine shall be but nothing stands the time
Not surprised
It's the same to sleep as it is to rise
Lies
Undenied
Cold shackles on my hands inches away
Death or life
Look deeply into my eyes
Fire on fire
Way to be and get a fucking ride
Some desire
A fuck you soars through the sky
Lies <start> loud screams torments my ears
bloodcurdling I'm going insane
female figure not already dead
incredible bleedings head trisect
her face is torn beyond the bone
howling unbearable in a shock
be victim of a killer dog
is screaming with no face
purest horror
stupid little girl
no fodder for the dog
die in a sea of blood <start> Falling on your broken bones
Hitch a ride to get you home
Stormy road and rocky path
Every step we take a chance
Cause in your heart and in your mind
Sometimes lost now sometimes blind
Well it's sometimes blind
See the wonder of it all
Take a breath before it falls
The wonder the wonder of it all
The wonder of it all
Innocence wasn't meant to fail
Stretched it out on a bed of nails
All your rights and all your wrongs
What it meant now to belong
Cause in your heart and in your mind
Sometimes lost now sometimes blind
Well it's sometimes blind
See the wonder of it all
What we had and lost before
The wonder the wonder of it all the wonder of it all
Did you see the wonder like a crash of thunder
It's the spell we're under now
The wonder the wonder of it all
See the wonder of it all
What we had and lost before
See the wonder of it all
What we had and lost before
The wonder the wonder of it all <start> She makes the place a jumpin'
The way she move around
She like a romp and rollin'
That when she get it out
And when she start a rockin'
She bring me to the boil
She like to give it up some
New satellite blues 
New satellite blues 
A picture clear for watchin'
The dish is running hot

New satellite blues 
New satellite blues

New satellite blues 
This thing's nothing but a load of crap

You can stick it where it hurts Mac
Oh yeah

Yeah <start> God bless America again you see all the troubles that she's in
Wash her pretty face dry her eyes and then God bless America again
God I sure to wish you bless America again
You know like you did way back when it all began
You blessed her then but we just sorta kinda took it for granted
And never did ask again
So just hold her hand God that's all
And if she should stumble please don't let her fall
God bless America again...
You know I don't understand every thing I'm readin' here
About what's wrong with America
But when you don't have a lotta book learnin'
I guess there's a lotta things you don't understand
But let me say this God she's like a mother to me
And all I am or ever hoped to be I owe to you and to her
Wash her pretty face dry her eyes and then God bless America again <start> In the early mornin' rain
With a dollar in my hand
And an aching in my heart
And my pockets full of sand
I'm a long ways from home
And I missed my loved one so
In the early mornin' rain
With no place to go
Out on runway number nine
Big  set to go
Well I'm out here on the grass
Where the pavement never grows
Where the liquor tasted good
And the women all were fast
There she goes my friend
She's rolling out at last
Hear the mighty engines roar
See the silver wing on high
She's away and westward bound
For above the clouds she flies
Where the mornin' rain don't fall
And the sun always shines
She'll be flying over my home
In about three hours time
This ol' airport's got me down
It's no earthly good to me
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground
Cold and drunk as I might be
Can't jump a jet plane
Like you can a freight train
So I best be on my way
In the early mornin' rain
So I best be on my way
In the early mornin' rain
So I best be on my way
In the early mornin' rain <start> Holding on when it seems that your grip is failing
Whos to say that you cant take it back
Live your life as if you know this is your last day
Make the choice to live forever
The decisions weighing the answer is yours
You cant wait forever dont let yourself hit the floor
The prodigal one wont you return
The light is on the door is open
Your bed is made your home is here
Come back and laugh and we will forget
Everything youve done wrong is gone here
Stepping back to see footprints youve left in your path
Stepping up for everything youve done
Now move on pack up your thoughts and keep on going
Keep the faith and you will be all right
The decisions weighing the answer is yours
You cant wait forever dont let yourself hit the floor
The prodigal one wont you return
Receive the letters sent from here
Receive the prayers prayed for you here
The decisions weighing the answer is yours
You cant wait forever dont let yourself hit the floor
The prodigal one wont you return
The light is on the door is open
Your bed is made your home is here
Come back and laugh and we will forget
Everything youve done wrong is gone here
Everything youve done wrong is gone here
Everything youve done wrong is gone here <start> Hippies are squares with long hair
And they don't wear no underwear
Country Rock is on the wane
I don't want music I want pain
Dictators can swing
Make you dance and sing
Cause an oil spill
You don't know us but you will
We're the members of the master race
Got no style and we got no grace
Sleep all night sleep all day
Nothing good on t.v. anyway
Gasoline shortage won't stop me now Oh no
We've reached a higher spiritual plane
That is so high I can't explain
We tell jokes to make you laugh
We play sports so we don't get fat
We can sweat and stink
We can eat and drink
Don't do what we're told
And we're scared of growing old
We're the members of the master race
We don't judge you by your face
First we check to see what you eat
Then we bend down and smell your feet
Hope you don't pick your nose
My favorite part of growing up
Is when I'm sick and throwing up
It's the dues you've got to pay
For eating burgers every day
Take my vitamin see
No one's good for me
Life can take it's toll
When you're living
ROCK N' ROLL
We're the members of the master race
Got no tact and we got no taste
First you put your sneakers on
Going outside to have some fun
don't forget to wipe your ass
c'mon guys

I could bind your beautiful wrists
And shut your beautiful eyes
With the drugs with the drugs with the drugs
And kick your beautiful doors in
Oh shame on your beautiful friends
'Cause it's all over

We've been traveling over rocky ground rocky ground
We've been traveling over rocky ground rocky ground
We've been traveling over rocky ground rocky ground
We've been traveling over rocky ground rocky ground
Rise up shepherd rise up
Your flock has roamed far from the hills
The stars have faded the sky is still
The angels are shouting Glory Hallelujah
We've been traveling over rocky ground rocky ground
We've been traveling over rocky ground rocky ground
Forty days and nights of rain have washed this land
Jesus said the money changers in this temple will not stand
Find your flock get them to higher ground
Flood waters rising and we're Caanan bound
We've been traveling over rocky ground rocky ground
We've been traveling over rocky ground rocky ground

Tend to your flock or they will stray
We'll be called for our service come Judgment Day
Before we cross that river wide
Blood on our hands will come back on us twice

Rise up shepherd rise up
Your flock has roamed far from the hills
Stars have faded the sky is still
Sun's in the heavens and a new day's rising
You use your muscle and your mind and you pray your best
That your best is good enough the Lord will do the rest
You raise your children and you teach 'them to walk straight and sure
You pray that hard times hard times come no more
You try to sleep you toss and turn the bottom's dropping out
Where you once had faith now there's only doubt
You pray for guidance only silence now meets your prayers
The morning breaks you awake but no one's there
We've been traveling over rocky ground rocky ground
There's a new day coming
We've been traveling over rocky ground rocky ground

We've been traveling over rocky ground rocky ground
There's a new day coming
We've been traveling over rocky ground rocky ground

Did I give you up No
So what's it all about now
Was it not enough
No no no
It's alright yeah
It's okay yeah
It's alright with me
I'll be fine yeah
I don't mind yeah
I'll pretend at least
But if you give me something that I'll believe in
Give me something and I will wait
But if you give me nothing
I can't help feeling I'm in stalemate with you
Stalemate with you
Used to pick me up yeah
Like a sunken pill
And I've been thinking it through
And we worked so well
But it feels wrong yeah
When I'm strong alone yeah
Strong alone by you
And the words you say yeah
Just to get your way yeah
Well they just won't do
You got to
Give me something that I'll believe it
Give me something and I will wait
But if you give me nothing
I can't help feeling I'm in stalemate with you
Oh I'm in stalemate
Oh I'm in stalemate baby

I need more
I need more
What are you waiting for
It's so frustrating

You got to want it

I'm so frustrated with your love
What you do to me
Oh yeah yeah
Hey
You got me in stalemate
Ooh
Hey hey hey
You got me in stalemate
Hey yeah
Ooh don't mug me baby
Don't mug me love
You breakin' my heart now
Don't you break my heart no
Don't you break my heart <start> Long distance affair can't you hear my heart keeps calling for you
It's hard to show that I care it's hard to tell if you want me there
I call your name there's no reply don't you feel the same
Can't you hear my heart calling you
I got love on the line but I can't get through
Sometimes love don't seem fair
Guess I was wrong thinkin' you would always be there
I must be dreamin' I thought I had you feelin' the same
I'm callin' your name
Long distance affair with just a spark you stole my heart from me
No one ever compared we'll never touch the memories
I call your name there's no reply don't you feel the same
Can't you hear my heart calling you
I got love on the line but I can't get through
Whatever your friends may say what's it worth to you anyway
You can listen to them and throw it away yeah
If you're thinkin' how it might have been
Don't think of me like I'm one of them
'Cause friends like that you got no one at all
There's love on the line baby answer the call
'Cause you know that I love you can't let go baby can't you hear my heart
I keep on calling your name there's no reply don't you feel the same
Can't you hear my heart calling you
I got love on the line but I ain't got you
Can't you hear my heart calling you
I got love on the line but I can't get through to you
Tell me it's true <start> So we waved our hands as we marched along
And the people smiled as we sang our song
And the world was saved as they listened to the band
And the BannerMan held the banner high
He was ten feet tall and he touched the sky
And I wish that I could be a BannerMan
Glory glory glory
Listen to the band
Sing the same old story
Ain't it something grand
To be good as you can
Like a BannerMan
And the drums went boom as the cornets play
And the tuba Umba'' D all the way
And the kids and the dogs were laughing as they ran
And the BannerMan held the banner high
With an Allelujah in his eye
And I wish that I could be a BannerMan
Glory glory glory
So we reached the square on the top of the hill
And the music stopped and we stood still
And a few were saved and the people said
Amen
Then we all got up and we formed a queue
And the drums went bang as the trumpets blew
And we marched back down into the town again <start> Shy boys sitting near the tracks
Of an unknown station
Still theyre waiting for that train
Guess they call it Hope
In this world that blows away our own words
In this world that breaks down promises
In this world that turns us into robots
In this world be stronger than your mask
Born to losealive to win
Born to losealive to win
We are just like open books with a secret code
We put lots of pages deep inside our soul
Though we were born to lose
With many tracks to choose
Since tonight
Were alive to win
Rifles in a baby carriage
When the moon gets bloody red
Serious as a prayerbook
Riots in the avenues
CHORUS
Lets wake our hidden nests up
Lets wear what we have inside
Though it could be not in style
Its what we really are
In this world where people are forgotten
In this world remember who you were
And where you came from <start> I feel hot  red  wired I feel burned out like I've expired. freaky dreams  you are there  I'm not even dreaming with glowing eyes  burning hair  violent. every nerve  every cell they gotta fight to stay alive  well I'm in a world of chronic discontent screaming metal  burning rubber always shoving  raping  cursing each other exploding into violence. try some buy some wheel  deal it if it makes you feel it buy or steal it we want it intense get ready to take it all the way we want our violence. the things they do ready to get violent the words they say it's all so chocolates  candlelight wedding bells all pink  white k i s s i n g you  me  we makes three that never played quite right like a comedy it seems so easy  it looks so clean all the shiny happy people in the magazines what it meant. but nothing seems to mean a flood of blood  a burning pain broken hearts  throbbing brains the message has been sent  it's violent try some buy some wheel  deal it buy or steal it if it makes you feel it we want our violence. we want it intense get ready to take it all the way the things they do the words they say it's all so ready to get violent <start> You know I think it's a funny thing
People talk without listening
People listen without hearing
I do it all the time
You know it's a funny phenomenon
People on their constant run
So obvious to me and yet
I never stop to get set
Listen to the silence
You might hear what you're looking for
Hearing nothing but the sound of your mind
Chorus
Listen to the silence
A little quiet time
You just might find what you're after
If you close your eyes
There's a jackhammer here and a speech maker there
Here a gun there a gun everywhere
See my man go tearing his hair
When everything's fine
I don't pretend to know a lot
I'll do the best with what I've got
Clear my head and give it a shot
'Till the stars line up right
Chorus
Listen to the silence
A little quiet time
You just might find what you're after
If you close your eyes
This isn't deep it's not profound
It's just something that I think about now
Had to find a new way around
The old way's not right
Selfhelp books and the latest moves
Who knows what will get you through
Don't know about me less about you
I don't know but I'll try
Chorus
Listen to the silence
A little quiet time
You just might find what you're after
If you free your mind
It's a noisy life I'm living right now
Believe I've done my time in the loud
Noisy life I'm living right now
I've played my joyful song with a loud sound <start> She probably still keeps herself inside herself
Her head it ruled her heart with a tune I'll never hear
Summer like selfportraits we were hit or miss
Never the same hues twice
The second layer's applied before the first one's were even rendered
I guess her wall's still high and wide
With the writing on the inside
Its meaning's reapplied to who's in fashion
CHORUS
Time's a perfect crime for a mystery girl
The veil distorts the rhyme for a mystery girl
Somewhere tonight a lonely shadow's painting in the rain
And most of what is captured will be in vain
You try to keep away the dogs of memory
The hungry and the restless ones just come at different angles
A cigarette at midnight in a slow dark room
And they're scratchin' at your door
The corner of your mind you pared to eloquence now rambles
And the rain sounds like a freight train
Don't it always come the same
When your hunger meets the pain of her resilience
CHORUS
I guess her wall's still high and wide
With the writing on the inside
Its meaning's reapplied to who's in fashion
CHORUS <start> What's new pussycat whoa
What's new pussycat whoa oh
Pussycat pussycat I've got flowers
And lots of hours to spend time with you
So go and powder your cute little pussycat nose
Pussycat pussycat I love you yes I do
You and your pussycat nose
What's new pussycat whoa
What's new pussycat whoa oh oh
Pussycat pussycat you're so thrilling
And I'm so willing to care for you
So go and make up your big little pussycat eyes
Pussycat pussycat I love you yes I do
You and your pussycat eyes
What's new pussycat whoa
What's new pussycat whoa oh oh
Pussycat pussycat you're delicious
And if my wishes can all come true
I'll soon be kissing your sweet little pussycat lips
Pussycat pussycat I love you yes I do
You and your pussycat eyes whoa
You and your pussycat nose <start> Last night
A room full drunk
Sang along to the songs I never had
The courage to write.
Given the chance
I'd stay in this chorus forever
Where everything ugly in this world
Is sadly beautiful
In our desperate memories.
No we're not
Gonna call everyone on their shit tonight
Even though the half of you won't even smile
The next time we pass on the street.
Maybe somehow
This scam will still save us all...
Still save us all...
Still save us all.
Still save us all...

Still save us all.
Then I saw you
Dancing at a punk rock show
And for a moment
We walked the streets that everyone else
Had given up to  AM
'Cause promises
And spray paint marking
Everywhere we went
And every direction
Only going as far
As we let it.
There's so many things
We try to do truthfully.
By the time it's through with us
It all falls apart.
Maybe somehow
This scam will still save us all.
Still save us all...

Still save us all.
Still save us all...

Still save us all. <start> Come a little closer if you can
just forget your fears
Come to me
cause where I want to be
is closer to you
Put your little hand into my hand
throw off this disquise
Come to me
cause I just want to be
closer to you
I'm oh so tired of this awful fight
cant get by without you
I dont know how I'm gonna be alright
But I'm all messed up
ya I'm all messed up
ya I am
Dont you wish we were younger
these things go to fast
Come to me
because I used to be
closer to you
Oo come to me cause
I need to be
closer to you <start> I want to be with you you know that I do
But theres nothing I can do to keep you around
I always knew theres power in you
And one of these days it would all shine through
In one of these ways itll all shine through
Under a black sky I can hear you calling out my name
And just like an asteroid our light just burned out into space
No matter how we try this gravity keeps us in our place
But under a black sky all we have is change
Our little talks spin round in my head
So many words but nothing said
You know your loss but I bear the cost
Only so many secrets I can keep
But I love you more than you can see
Under a black sky I can hear you calling out my name
And just like an asteroid our light just burned out into space
No matter how we try this gravity keeps us in our place
But under a black sky all we have is change <start> I've seen your evil ways
And your corrupting mind
Lay the hourglass over
So we don't waste our time
Now throw your burdens out
And throw your heart to me
I don't know what'll come
We'll have to wait and see
Like a shooting star
And you're falling from me
And as you fade away
My heart skips a beat
I know you're down on love
But we can love again
So open up
Come on invite me in
Now throw your burdens out
And throw your heart to me
I don't know what'll come
We'll have to wait and see
Like a shooting star
And you're falling from me
As you fade away
My heart skips a beat
I've seen your evil ways
And your corrupting mind
Lay the hourglass over
So we don't waste our time
Like a shooting star
And you're falling from me
And as you fade away
My heart skips a beat
I'm a howlin' wolf
You're a shooting star
Yes I am
You're a shooting star <start> Freedom for the scapegoat leaving Reading Jail
Rheumy eyes just pierced his heart like crucifixion nails
Shaking fists and razors gleamed you never stood a chance
When the ink ran red on Fleet Street
You turned your eyes to France
Humbled far from Dublin chased across the waves
Your biting wit still sharp enough
To slice through every page
Destitute and beaten by the system of the crown
The bitter pill you swallowed
Tasted sweeter going down
And looking back on the great indifference
Looking back at the limestone wall
Thinking how beauty deceives you
Knowing how love fools us all
A golden boy in velveteen landed in New York
The past was so seductive
When they paid to hear you talk
Baccarat and champagne flutes
Tobacco from Virginia
Long before the lords and law
Branded Oscar Wilde a sinner
And looking back on the cold bleak winter
Looking back on those long dark days
Felt like the head of John the Baptist
In the arms of Salome
Don't turn around it's a white gull screaming
Don't cry out loud you never know who's listening
You've seen it all the exiled Unforgiven
From the stately homes of England to her prisons
And looking back at the hardened lifers
Looking back on the wretched poor
Thinking maybe they were my saviors
Strange to think I'll miss them all
Strange to think I'll miss them all
And looking back on the great indifference
Looking back at the limestone wall
Thinking how beauty deceives you
Knowing how love fools us all <start> forfeit the game or play to win i made my bed and now i'm sleeping in woke up late to find you gone hope i wasn't wrong i think you caught me thinking out loud would i be crazy if i burnt my own house down then i could rebuild to my liking close cover before striking breaking ground for the new me breaking down every time i think about it breaking ground for the new me getting up from these past catastrophes i'm always using words like maybe and someday maybe someday i'll learn that tomorrow's always a day away i always knew it would feel like this but i can't say i was ready for it out of state out of mind at least i can pretend i'm fine could this cup of coffee really keep me company for another winter alone i'm always using words like maybe and someday and sorry i'm sorry i couldn't say you remind me of everything i ever wanted to be maybe we were meant to be <start>  <start> I was young when I left home
And I been out a'ramblin' 'round
And I never wrote a letter to my home.
To my home Lord to my home
And I never wrote a letter to my home.
It was just the other day
I was drinkin' on my pay
When I met an old friend I used to know.
He said your mother's dead and gone
Your baby sister's all gone wrong
And your daddy needs you home right away.
Not a shirt on my back
Not a penny on my name.
Well I can't go home this a'way.
This a'way Lord Lord Lord
I can't go home this a'way.
If you miss the train I'm on
Count the days I'm gone
And you'll hear that whistle blow a hundred miles.
A hundred miles a hundred baby
Lord Lord Lord
And you'll hear that whistle blow a hundred miles.
When I's playin' on the track
Maw would come and whip me back
On them tressles down by ol' Jim McKay's.
When I pay the debt I owe
To the commissary store
I will pawn my watch and chain and go home.
Oh home Lord Lord Lord
I will pawn my watch and chain and go home.
I used to tell my Maw sometimes
When I see them ridin' blinds
Gonna make me a home out in the wind.
In the wind Lord in the wind
Make me a home out in the wind.
I don't like it in the wind
I want to go back home again
But I can't go home this a'way.
This a'way Lord Lord Lord
And I can't go home this a'way.
I was young when I left home
And I been all a' ramblin' 'round
And I never wrote a letter to my home.
To my home Lord Lord Lord
And I never wrote a letter to my home. <start> In Friday's tiedye nightmare
I was trying to get from here to there
Walking to passing through people everywhere
I got on at my station running through the fire
Looking for an elevation that would get me a little higher
News of people dying someone lying on the stair
Crying for the nation can we offer up a prayer
There'll be a coronation a fancy dress affair
We'll be lined up in formation but we won't be going anywhere
Down the hellhole trying to make my way
I couldn't get where I wanted due to an unforeseen delay
The man was apologetic as he turned his head to say
Sorry kid you're not gonna make it home today
Hey mister why'd you take my ticket away
Even more to the point how come I let you
I could blame it all on you or make up my mind to stay
I wish I knew a way I could forget you
I didn't read the fine print y'gotta be on the ball
Some days I'm less confident up against a wall
I wonder where my mind went I should have made the call
I like to think I'm innocent but then don't we all
I got to the next location hoping for the best
But another situation put me to the test
A man in black pants a white shirt and a red vest
Had fallen on the track and no one even got depressed
Or even guessed he wasn't putting on an act
Someone said he'd drunk too much
'Cause he was lying on his back
It was also duly noted that he happened to be black
There was a serious lack of anything right at all here
What's the differenceI didn't stop
The very least I could have done was call a cop
But I passed the news vendor pursuing my agenda
And I like everyone else I dropped the ball here
Still trying to get home I saw a telephone
And put some coins I had found
They were supposed to work they did for the man beside me
But when I dropped them in they wouldn't go down
What is going on here
Will I ever know the truth
How do to deal with the time stealing away your daddy's youth
Story after story of disaster barely missed
You see common miracles somehow do exist
And anyone can be kissed by lady fortune
So I gathered up my skirt and tucked my wallet in
Grabbed my bag and the sling I carried my girl child in
Funny she didn't cry she wasn't scared at all
She could see a happy outcome in the patterns on the wall
And y'know
The next train was the right one but not for the vested man
I try but there's too many things I'll never understand
Y'gotta keep on going knowing someone's got a plan
For Friday's tiedye nightmare and Monday's promised land
And there it is <start> On behalf of Dr. Timothy Leary
In association with the legions of illuminated social rejects
And as an influential administrator and creator of musical chaos
In these so called United States
I stand as a messenger of strangeness this evening
In order to impress upon or at least to instruct
The honorable musicians as to the methods and motives
Of the truly bizarre reality The weird revolution
Thomas Jefferson confounder and president
Of this normally corrupt nation said
If God is truly just I tremble for the fate of my country
Secondly there are some dynamics at play
Which I must familiarize you with
The socalled weirdos in this country
Stand as completely freaked out by the normal man
As the normal man is completely freaked out
By the weird masses reaction to him
Which came first you may ask
Chicken or egg you may ask
Well the chicken of course
And its time to break this weirdass chain
The weird masses dont want to be normalized
Weirdos want to be abnormal
The freaks cant be formally normalized
Nor can we normally formalized
What we want is complete weirdification
Basically we dont want weirdness from the normal man
We dont want to be freaked out by the normal man
We want to out freak the normal man
The normal man entices and prostitutes
And performs surgery on our weird women
Yes even your brother could be a victim of his plastic fantasies
And if you weird out his daughter hell plast your ass
Whats good for the goose is good for the gander
Are you freaking with me
What is good for the goose is good for the gander
So you can pluck out his feathers and smile
Because you are defending our weird women
From the freakyass thoughts of the bugeyed
Bowlegged normal man <start> Tiptoeing through the used condoms
Strewn on the piers of the westside highway
Sunset behind the skyline of Jersey
Walking toward the water
With a fetus holding court in my gut
My body hijacked
My tits swollen and sore
The river has more colors at sunset
Than my sock drawer ever dreamed of
I could wake up screaming sometimes
But I don't
I could step off the end of this pier
But I got shit to do
And an appointment on Tuesday
To shed uninvited blood and tissue
I'll miss you
I say to the water to the son or daughter
I thought better of
I could fall in love with Jersey at sunset
But I leave the view to the rats
And tiptoe
Back. <start> The sun is shining
We should be making hay
But we're dead from the waist down
Like in California
Victory is empty
There are lessons in defeat
But we're dead from the waist down
We are sleeping on our feet
We stole the songs from birds in trees
Bought us time on easy street
Now our paths they never meet
We chose to court and flatter greed
Ego disposability
I caught a glimpse and it's not me
Make hay not war
Make hay not war
Make hay not war
Or else we're done for
When we're D from the W down
There's no contracts binding
No bad scene beyond repair
But when you're dead from the waist down
You're too far gone to even care
We stole the songs from birds in trees
Bought us time on easy street
Now our paths they never meet
We chose to court and flatter greed
Ego disposability
I caught a glimpse and it's not me
Make hay not war
Make hay not war
Make hay not war
Or else we're done for
When we're D from the W down
Make hay not war
Make hay not war
Make hay not war
Or else we're done for
When we're D from the W down
When we're D from the W down
When we're D from the W down
D from the W down
D from the W down <start> Vor zwei Wochen hab' ich dich zum ersten Mal gesehen.
Du warst so betrunkendu konntest kaum noch stehen.
Aus Mitleid hab' ich dich nach Haus gebracht.
Du sagtest zrtlichIst da noch Schnaps in der Pulle.
Ist da noch Schnaps in der Pulle hast du gesagt. Vielleicht war es nur ein Scherz
Amos Pfeil durchbohrte mein Herz.
Jetzt wei ich nicht was ich denken soll.
Ist es wirklich Liebe oder find ich dich nur toll
Ich wei nicht ob es Liebe ist
Wenn man alle Frauen nur an einer mit
wenn man etwas hrt und es sofort vergit.
Ich wei nicht ob es Liebe ist.
Am nchsten Tag habe ich dich besucht.
Als das Bier alle war hast du laut geflucht.
Du lagst auf dem Bett und warst ziemlich breit
aber immerhin waren wir allein zu zweit.
Ich wollte mit dir reden ber Literatur
und ber Liebe aber du lachtest nur.
Jetzt wei ich nicht was ich denken soll.
Ist es wirklich Liebe oder find ich dich nur toll
Ich wei nicht ob es Liebe ist
wenn man an eine denkt und eine andere kt
wenn man nicht mehr trinkt und it.
Ich wei nicht ob das Liebe ist.
Ich wei nich ob es Liebe ist.
Ich wei nicht ob es Liebe ist.
Wenn man beim Pinkeln stndig nebens Becken pit. <start> Bloodthirsty sadists seek out their sick fun
now the ritual of death has fucking begun
in a so called sport you pursue in your leisure
you maim and you torture and kill for your pleasure.
Youve taken a life that is worth more than your own
our hatred for you has grown and grown
for the innocent life you have taken away
revenge will be sweet with your life you will pay.
Screams pierce the silence as another kill is made.
Another innocent victim is sent to an early grave.
The valleys echo painfully to the sound of tortured death
The voice of terror screaming with final batedbreath.
Hounds they rip and tear at the bloody lifeless form.
The signal for the kill is blown on the huntsman's horn.
The ground runs red with blood as the faceless bastards smile.
Another death sentence is passed without a fucking trial. <start> Shove all your problems under the rug
Then you wonder where the smell came from
Rotting out from the inside
This is your fucked up family
So many minds that nobody ever speaks
Rotting out from the inside...rotting out.
Nuclear family falling out
Winter forever in this house they're
Rotting out from the inside
So put me out of my misery
If it ever happens to me no
Rotting out from the inside...rotting out
Rotting out...Rotting out
Rotting out...Rotting out
Beat my head till I can speak
Not gonna let it happen to me no
Rotting out...Rotting out
Rotting out...Rotting out <start> My love is like a red red rose
That's newly strung in June
My love is like a melody
That's sweetly played in tune
As far art thou my bonnie lass
So deep in love am I
And I will love thee still my dear
Til all the seas gang dry
Til all the seas gang dry
Till all the seas gang dry my dear
And the rocks melt with the sun
I will love thee still my dear
While the sands of life shall run
And fare thee well my only love
And fare thee well a while
And I will come again my love
Though it were ten thousand miles
Though it were ten thousand miles <start> If you change
Change your mind
If you think it's worth it
Just call me
You'll find me  I need you.
If you get mistreated
If your heart is bleeding
I still want you so bad  I need you.
I tell you words
That no one will hear
Make a diamond out of tears
Believe me.
Forget it all it will break your heart
Come to me and trust in me
Baby
You will never find a love like mine.
I need you
I need you
If you think it's worth it
Day and niqht I'll be there  I need you.
If you get mistreated
If your heart is bleeding

You'll never find a love like mine.
I need you

If you think it's worth it

If you think it's worth it

If you get mistreated
If your heart is bleeding <start> I've been sittin at the border of love
When dots connectin there's an order above
And there is no one that can touch me
When it's the same thing comin again I feel I gotta say
I'm gonna walk
I won't quit
Until I get
To the bottom of your heart
I'm gonna walk
I won't quit
Until I get
To the bottom of your heart
Whoa

Walkin hour after hour if I could
Use a walkin super power I would
Use it just to come and find you
Then it's the slow and steady again never goin away

To find you I wouldn't mind to

He just wanted her but she wants more
So build a wall
Keep it all to herself oh
Always never seemed to be too much
Reaching out became a spider's touch
Wrapped in chains
Sad remains
Another victim of
Over love
Over love
He was just the devil in a thing disguise
Jealousy behind the greenest eyes
Turn the page
Close the cage
On another victim of
Over love
Over love yeah
Over love
Over love
Over love over love
Mamma never left her baby all alone
Baby never knew when she was grown
Now mamma's gone
And come the dawn
You got another victim of
Over love

Over love
Over love love love love love
Over love <start> Attention battalion
To rank right face
Forward march
As fearless leader of the Ravenskill Militia
The blood of warriors flows throughout my veins
My brother's gift remains my secret ammunition
It is our hope our pride a catalyst for change
Still the fires of revolution burn within my eyes
On this perilous road to freedom he's our one and only guide
For many years I've seen
Our people starve and suffer
How many more will die before we stand and fight
They ask me Arhys could things be any tougher
The answer's no surprise yes you bet your life
Now the fires of revolution won't burn forever more
I see liberty in our future and it's one we're fighting for
We all long for a better life
Like a dream that can't be denied
This is the moment now is the time
Freedom if we live or if we die
I shall give him a better life
I swore this vow to my dying wife
Sure she would not survive
Peacefully she slipped away
The meaning in my life
Was born that day
And so I found the strength to carry on with this crusade
It is my fate
Evangeline you lived a life of misery and pain
Evangeline I'll never let your memory die in vain
Evangeline my heavy heart still bleeds
I dedicate my life to set you free
And I will carry on to plant the seeds
I promise in the name of our new son
This battle won't be over until it's won <start> They say that hell hath no fury
A fact that I can't deny
I see the victims of circumstance
Convicted without a crime
Call it aggressive behaviour
Call it the need to be free
Call it the cry of the innocent
That noone can believe
Rebel rebel woman I know you well
Rebel rebel woman I know you well
They say there's truth in the old truths
No reason to cheat or lie
We're caught in the crossfire
Convicted without a trial
This mother's scorn is a strange thing
She pays her children for love
She heeds the cry of their innocence
They pay her with their blood
Rebel rebel woman I know you well
Rebel rebel woman I know you well
They say that hell hath no fury
A fact that I can't deny
I see the victims of circumstance
Convicted without a crime
Another plane in the ocean
Another wall in the sky
The victims of circumstance
Convicted without a trial
Rebel rebel woman I know you well
Rebel rebel woman I know you well <start> You get it up
You get it up
You get me feeling so hot
Mama I'm your buttercup

Keep your eyes on the road your hands upon the wheel
Yeah we're goin' to the roadhouse we're gonna have a real a good time
Yeah at the back at the roadhouse they got some bungalows
Yeah at the back at the roadhouse they got some bungalows
And that's for the people who like to go down slow
Let it roll baby roll

Well I woke up this morning and I got myself a beer
The future's uncertain and the end is always near
Let it roll baby roll
Let it roll baby roll
Let it roll baby roll
Let it roll all night long <start> I'll never forget
The first time we met
On the beach by the sea
Just opened my eyes
Voila a surprise
You were looking at me
And I wished I owned
A heart of stone
And I knew it was over then
I knew that I was through
You don't have to believe me
But I know it's true
And when you go and I'm all alone
I'll wish I owned that heart of stone
I was taken aback
I was thrown off my track
By your beauty and joy
The wind blew your hair
I just lay there and stare
Like a stupid schoolboy
And I wished I owned
A heart of stone...
And I knew it was over then
I knew that I was through
You don't have to believe me
But I know it's true
And when you go and I'm all alone
I'll wish I owned that heart of stone
Then we'd sit holding hands
Lay so many plans
Of the places we'd go
But the years quickly passed
And then it came to the last
We never left home
And so now we are old
Both our stories are told
And we wait for the end
And if you're the first to go
I will follow you know
That my heart will not mend
And I wish I owned
A heart of stone <start> The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today
Is Christians who acknowledge Jesus with their lips
Then walk out the door and deny him by their lifestyle.
That is what an unbelieving world simply finds unbelievable.
What if I stumble
What if I fall
Is this one for the people
Is this one for the Lord
Or do I simply serenade for things I must afford
You can jumble them together my conflict still remains
Holiness is calling in the midst of courting fame
Cause I see the trust in their eyes
Though the sky is falling
They need Your love in their lives
Compromise is calling
Chorus
What if I stumble what if I fall
What if I lose my step and I make fools of us all
Will the love continue when my walk becomes a crawl
What if I stumble and what if I fall
What if I stumble what if I fall
You never turn in the heat of it all
What if I stumble what if I fall
Father please forgive me for I can not compose
The fear that lives within me
Or the rate at which it grows
If struggle has a purpose
On the narrow road you've carved
Why do I dread my trespasses will leave a deadly scar
Do they see the fear in my eyes
Are they so revealing
This time I cannot disguise
All the doubt I'm feeling
Chorus
What if I stumble
Everyone's got to crawl when you know that
You're up against a wall it's about to fall
Everyone's got to crawl when you know that 
I hear You whispering my name You say
My love for You will never change never change
Chorus x
What if I stumble what if I fall
You never turn in the heat of it all
What if I stumble what if I fall
You are my comfort and my God
Is this one for the people is this one for the Lord <start> No promises no guarantees
When you come down here
You're already on your knees
You want to ride White Lightnin'
Then sign your name
If you want to dance with the devil
You gotta play his way play the game
You gotta taste that sweetness
Cause you can't say no
But are you ready for the nightmare
When you can't let go
Like a soldier of fortune
When the money runs dry
You got rivers of bitter tears in your eyes
You want to leave but you can't let go
You want to stop but you can't say no
You'll never laugh about it
You just can't live without it
You had enough but you just want more
You never get what you're lookin' for
You'll never laugh about it never
You got both ends burning
You're like a moth to a flame
You're going off the rails
Like a runaway train
It's a nowin situation
And there's no way out
And no one will ever hear you scream and shout
You want to leave but you can't let go
You want to stop but you can't say no
You'll never laugh about it
You just can't live without it
You had enough but you just want more
You never get what you're lookin' for
You'll never laugh about it never
Run he's coming to claim you
Run nowhere to hide away
Run oh you dance with danger
Run oh you gotta ride the

White Lightnin'
On a dead end street
White Lightnin'
Where the deadbeats meet
White Lightnin'
It's a oneway ride
White Lightnin'
Oh there's nowhere to hide
Such a lonely road you ride
It's not easy when you don't know why
Such a heavy load you hide
You never leave no matter how you try
Run he's coming to claim you
Run nowhere to hide away
Run you dance with danger
Run oh you gotta ride the
Chorus
White Lightning
Can you feel it can you feel it
White Lightning
It's so dangerous
White Lightning
No promises no guarantees
White Lightning
When you come down here
You're already on your knees <start> I've done it I've blown it again
Gone and lost my one true friend
If I can't stop it it's gonna end
I've done it I've blown it again
I've done it I've blown it again
Finally I'm seeing clearly
I'm writing this so you can hear me
How did I get it in my head that you could do me wrong No.
Since I got to know you better
I found that I was glad I met ya
Why did I listen to those lies when you were standing there for me
Why did I never tell you Why did I not say Why did I push it away
Why did I never trust ya I could have told you all my fears
All those years now I'm ashamed of my ways
I've done it I've blown it again
Gone and lost my one true friend
If I can't stop it it's gonna end
I've done it I've blown it again
I've done it I've blown it again
Diggin' up the heart within me
Dismay is the only feeling I see
I have to say my heart ain't what it could be
Open up the box and tell me what it should be
You can't free you boot if it ain't gone fly
You can't live a life if you don't ask why
Such a thing as too much information trapped inside this condemnation.
Why did I never tell you Why did I not say Why did I push it away
Why did I never trust ya I could have told you all my fears
All those years now I'm ashamed of my ways
I've done it I've blown it again
Gone and lost my one true friend
If I can't stop it it's gonna end
I've done it I've blown it again
I've done it I've blown it again
Gone and lost my one true friend
If I can't stop it
Sorry you said it my motor mouth done and did it again exceeding speed limit and now I'm
Feelin it.
I'm knee deep in it ready to roll like a jeep with the keys in it so give me three minutes.
'Cause I admit it I was wrong with no right to expect maybe you might just accept my apology
Even though it feels funny 'cause when a penny dropped I'm like Oh my gosh I killed Kenny
I can't believe I'd end up dissin' a friend man I shoulda known better than to listen to them.
With their see through poisonous lies deceitful made you the last one on my list to speak to
Yeah.
Sticks and stones break bones and kill. Word wounds take long to heal.
I was wrong for real and I ain't even gon' try to deny 'cause I missed the mark and I missed
It wide.
I've done it I've blown it again
Gone and lost my one true friend
If I can't stop it it's gonna end
I've done it I've blown it again
I've done it I've blown it again <start> Encuntrame en el ro

Postrado ante Ti me entregare
Aunque no te vea y solo este
Encuntras en ro ah estar

I am that thou art that all this is that

This is that ooh
Daybreak and I take a glide
Into the pool of peace inside
To waves and I both travel by
Life supporting waves of bliss
Mother Divine's precious kiss
Brings with love the light of wisdom
And the gift of eternal freedom
To waves and I both travel by
And that makes all the difference to me
All this is that
I am that thou art that all this is that
I am that thou art that all this is that
This is that ooh
Dusk time the shadows fall
Into the timeless time of all
To waves and I both travel by
Golden auras glow around you
Omnipresent love surrounds you
Wisdom warming as the sun
You and I are truly one
To waves and I both travel by
And that makes all the difference to me
I am that thou art that all this is that
I am that thou art that all this is that
I am that thou art that all this is that
I am that thou art that all this is that
I am that thou art that all this is that
I am that thou art that all this is that
I am that thou art that all this is that

Come on you've got to let me know
Should I stay or should I go
If I go there will be trouble
And if I stay it will be double
So won't you come on and let me know
Should I stay or should I go
It's always tease tease tease
You'll have me when I'm on my knees
One day it's fine the next it's black
So if you want me off your back
Won't you come on and let me know let me know
Should I cool it or should I blow
This indecision's bugging me
Please baby please set me free
I don't think I can repel off your attack
So if you want me off your back
Won't you come on and let me know
Should I cool it or should I blow <start> I was so much an outcast
No one ever liked me cause I wasn't wanted
I was so different from the rest of them all
Fucked up on the drugs from all the speed
And I never got no sleep
Cause I kept on trippin' over what they said
And everything that my mom said made me mad
And everything that my dad said made me sad
Why am I even trying
I'm crying out I'm crying out
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
Spinning round spinning round I've fallen down
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
You keep shootin' those glances
Relating to the rawness I'm a fuckin' lost kid
Trying so hard to become just like me talk like me walk like me
You keep trippin' on everything I wear every time I swear
Even when it comes to my hair
It seems like you don't have the time to relate to my kind
I'm not a dope pullin' your life
Why am I even trying
I'm crying out I'm crying out
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
Spinning round spinning round I've fallen down
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
I'm trippin' out I'm trippin' out
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
Draw me down breaking down
I've hit the ground
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
Your dreamy dreads
Are you still tripping on me
You're drinking dread
Are you still tripping on me
Now do you drift
Are you still tripping on me
Now do you drift
Why are you tripping on me
I was so much an outcast
Find a way to make it right
I was so much an outcast
I can't seem to find a way to make it right
I was so much an outcast
No ever liked me
I can't find a way to make it right
I was so much an outcast
I can't seem to find a way to make it right
Why am I even trying
I'm crying out I'm crying out
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
Spinning round spinning round I've fallen down
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
I'm trippin' out I'm trippin' out
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
Draw me down breaking down
I've hit the ground
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out
I'm crying out I'm crying out I'm crying out freaking out
Draw me down breaking down
I've hit the ground
I cannot seem to keep from freaking out <start> Oh I used to be disgusted
And now I try to be amused
But since their wings have got rusted
You know the angels want to wear my red shoes
But when they told me 'bout their side of the bargain
That's when I knew that I could not refuse
And I won't get any older now that angels want to wear my red shoes
Oh oh I was watching while you're dancing away
Our love got fractured in the echo and sway
How come everybody wants to be your friend
You know that it still hurts me just to say it
Oh I know that she's disgusted 
Because she's feeling so abused 
She gets tired of the lust 
But it's so hard to refuse
Can you say that I'm too old
When the angels have stolen my red shoes
Oh oh I said I'm so happy I could die
She said Drop dead then left with another guy
That's what you get if you go chasing after vengeance
Ever since you got me punctured this has been my sentence
Oh I used to be disgusted
But now I try to be amused
But since their wings have got rusted
You know the angels want to wear my red shoes
But when they told me 'bout their side of the bargain
That's when I knew that I could not refuse
And I won't get any older now that the angels want to wear my red shoes
Oh I won't get any older now the angels want to wear my red shoes
Red shoes the angels want to wear my red shoes
Red shoes the angels want to wear my red shoes
Red shoes the angels want to wear my red shoes
Red shoes the angels want to wear my red shoes
Red shoes the angels want to wear my red shoes

I see her footprints in the snow
Mmh I used to drag my feet
Now I know which way to go
It's been a year now I can't wait
Only one month love a fair
To see your pretty face
I missed you so much and I swear
If I could keep you here then I would
'Cause we both know we can't stop
I've been thinking about you for  months now
I can't let you go like last time knowing that you're not mine
And then miss you for  months again
Little sunshine on the street
I'm smiling at you till you blush
There should be more days like these
My one and only Christmas crush
And I won't let you go back
I've said that every year
And we're both not fine with that
Just let me make this clear
If I could keep you then I would
'Cause we both know we can't stop
I've been thinking about you for  months now
I can't let you go like last time knowing that you're not mine
And then miss you for  months again
Now baby look at me tell me what you see
We both know you're gonna leave
So let's make the best of the time we have
'Cause we'll never get it back
I wanna see you smile baby don't you cry
Let's remember tonight
Maybe it's the last one that we ever have
And we might never get it back
If I could keep you then I would
'Cause we both know we can't stop
I've been thinking about you for  months now
I can't let you go like last time knowing that you're not mine
And then miss you for  months again <start> The End Of The Lyin'

You took me for a fool
Then you took me for a ride
You really had me going
Till I looked into your lies
I let you keep me hangin' on
But honey here's where I get off
It's the end of the lyin'
And I can't stand no more denyin'
It's all over but the cryin'
Honey it's the end of the line
Don't tell me a story
I don't care where you've been
Girl I'm out for glory
And I won't be back again
I let you keep me hangin' on
But honey here's where I get off
It's the end of the lyin'
And I can't stand no more denyin'

Empty roads to nowhere
Unlocked cars life's so far
There's no here to get there
As fast as I run
Could you catch me for once
It's the last time I learn my lesson the hard way
Because you lost
Because I just love to hate you
Because you lost me
Cold and clean perfect dream
I don't ever want them
Hand me down white washed town
Another bully anthem
As fast as I run
Could you catch me for once
It's the last time I learn my lesson the hard way
Because you lost
Because I just love to hate you
Because you lost me
You lost
You lie to me
You lie
You lie to me
You lie
You lie to me
As fast I run
Could you catch me for once
It's the last time I learn my lesson the hard way
Because you lost
Because I just love to hate you
Because you lost me
You lost
Because I just love to hate
Because you lost me <start> Im sorry my friend if I've become drunk with power.
Im sorry my friend if I blame it on being drunk 
Truth of the matter is I'm turning into a sexist
A fucking asshole pretentious snob
And all the shit I talked behind your back I'm never gonna say it to your face
I'm sorry my friends if we're asking for money.
I'm sorry my friends if its a thousand a show 
Truth of the matter is I'm not here to make a living
But Jay Navaro told me once he had to feed his baby
So four more at the door means your putting more food in my mouth.
And if you help my band well then we can be friends.
But I've never seen your band I was too busy drinking.
I don't wanna think about yesterday
And all those stupid games we played were not okay.
I don't wanna be that tomorrow
I don't wanna think about yesterday.
And if we pull that shit today I swear I'll say
I am gonna be here tomorrow
I'm sorry my friends for this record I'm signing.
I'm sorry I swear its not an ego thing 
Truth of the matter is I thought I was immune to it
But turns out like everybody else I'm looking for acceptance.
This autographs a contract claiming you'll accept my word as law
Listen to the Clash D Pet Sounds buy shirt buy disc posters mailing list.
Yea I know I wasn't at the show.
I was too busy drinking by myself.
I don't wanna think about yesterday
And all those stupid games we played were not okay.
I don't wanna be that tomorrow.
I don't wanna think about yesterday
And if we pull that shit today declare with me
I am gonna destroy my local rockstar
Can you promise me one thing
Will you let me go under in a sea of my own hype
And if I reach for your hand to get my feet back on the ground will you please not help me up
Will you just let me die in my own web of lies
Like money's not an issue and this music's not for sale.
Don't be fooled.
Everything's for sale.
I am gonna destroy my local rockstar <start> I'd love to take a ride with you But I'm scared that I might say the wrong thing
You you'd be cool Too cool to care Too cool to care about me
And I don't know what you see in me Well I don't know what you see here
And I don't know what you see in me I don't know what you see here
Oh oh but it's clear I'm here
I want you to say... I'd love to be alone with you I only know a thing or two You
you'd be cool Too cool to care about me. <start> You take a simple part of history
And then you feed it back to me
I'm smart enough to know
We try we're living under plastic skies
Reality personified
And everyone's the same
Is it a lie living a lifetime is reverse
Is it alright living a lifetime in reverse
Like nothing's wrong and everything's okay
You watch images on movie screens
They contradict your memories
And everything you know
Deny the stories that are never told
Now culture can be bought and sold
To anyone today
Is it a lie living a lifetime is reverse
Is it alright living a lifetime in reverse
Is it a lie living a lifetime is reverse
Is it alright living a lifetime in reverse
Like nothing's wrong and everything's okay
Okay everything's okay
Is it a lie living a lifetime is reverse

Now don't you go looking at me like that
You might see I'm ashamed what's your name
Talk with me won't you talk with me
Chorus
Oh pretty girl
It ain't too hip faking lines you ain't taking
But your lips make me say it that way
Now there's no use you resisting
This is the Cradle Thief insisting
I think you better let me have it my way
Fool around with me come on mess around with me
Chorus
Will you survive learn to drive
I know you can't describe the dreams you want to be
Either stay or get away
I'm not playing around can't you tell the way I'm squeezing
Your hand
I'm just a kid don't make me feel like a man
Silly girl I'm just playing
Now did you think that I'd be nuts enough to try an' pick you up
Don't you know it's a game it's all a game I've been playing
But what'd you say your name was
Walk with me just around the corner baby maybe you could even
Try to talk to me
Damn you talk to me
Damn you talk to me <start> So you wanted to take a break
Slow it down some and have some space
Fuck you too
Give me my money back
Give me my money back you bitch
I want my money back

I wish I hadn't bought you dinner
Right before you dumped me
On your front porch
Give me my money back
Give me my money back you bitch

To give me back my black Tshirt
So you wanted to take a break
Slow it down some and have some space

Yet the unfit may live
Let 'em wear gaudy colors
Or avoid display
Hey it don't matter

So I do this and I do that

Oh you got a nickel
I got a dime
I'd like to get to know you
But I haven't got the time
You gotta walk like a mannequin
Roll like a tire
Act on reaction
Dodge the big spud fryer
So wiggle on the bottom
Wiggle on the top
Wiggle up the middle
And laugh a lot
Cause I've been living in a wiggly world
Wiggly world a wiggly world
I got to tell you
I've been living in a wiggly world now
Wiggly world a wiggly world
Well I've been living in a wiggly world
Wiggly world a wiggly word
I got to tell you
I've been living in a wiggly world
WiggIy world a wiggly world <start> Was like I walked inside your mind
A darkened place with no windows
Was like through you I saw me
A gaping hole inside
The words never come out right
We must leave this room take my hand and...
Come fly away at last forever
All this can wait
All those times we appeared holding out our hands
All you'll know and all you'll see
Is wrapped within a mirror
See our souls all our fears far away from here
And the shadows fading
The mysteries upon my wall
Are there any angels anywhere
I hear the cries all the time
Baptized by fire in the holy light...
Come fly away at last forever
Heaven can wait
All those times we appeared holding out our hands
And all you'll know and all you'll see
Is wrapped within a mirror
See our souls all our fears far away from here
We can be healed
And we can be sacrificed I know

We can be healed
And we can be sacrificed I know
Come fly away at last forever
Heaven can wait
All those times we appeared holding out our hands....
Do I hear you laughing now
Is that a sword I see
This saga has an ending after all
Endless halls...It's so hard to see the answers
Burning dreams...A life for me you are falling....
Come fly away at last forever
All this can wait
All those times we appeared holding out our hands
All you'll know and all you'll see
Is wrapped within a mirror
See our souls all our fears far away from here
Come fly away at last forever
All this can wait
All those times we appeared holding out our hands
All you'll know and all you'll see
Is wrapped within a mirror
See our souls all our fears far away from here <start> A timeless and forgotten place
The moon and sun in endless chase
Each in quiet surrender
while the other reigns the sky
The midnight hour begins to laugh
A summer evening's epitaph
The winds are getting crazy
As the storm begins to rise
As the storm begins to rise
Wild were the winds that came
In the thunder and the rain
Nothing ever could contain
The rising of the storm
In the wings of ebony
Darkened waves fill the trees
Wild winds of warning
Echo through the air
Follow the storm now I've got to get out of here
Follow the storm as you take to the sky
Follow the storm now it's all so crystal clear
Follow the storm as the storm begins to rise
She seems to come from everywhere
Welcome to the dragon's lair
Fingers running through your hair
She asks you out to play
For all of nature's sorcery
The most bewitching entity
Hell can have no fury
Like the rising of the storm
Follow the storm now I've got to get out of here
Follow the storm as you take to the sky
Follow the storm now it's all so crystal clear
Follow the storm as the storm begins to rise
Follow the storm now I've got to get out of here
Follow the storm as you take to the sky
Follow the storm now it's all so crystal clear
Follow the storm as the storm begins to rise
As the storm begins to rise <start> Don't have no penpal to write to

I don't know where it ends
I look up to the heavens
Where do they begin
From way down here
My feet stuck on the ground
And the wonders in and around me
Can it be
You who made the moon
You who made the stars
I cannot express the sum of who you are
You who spoke the word
Living in my heart
I cannot explain it but some how you are
Somehow You are
Peering out my window feeling pretty small
A perfect cosmic light show
And I know you made it all
It makes it all the harder to wrap my
Mind around
How you gave up heaven to be with me
Can it be
Nothing high or low above below
Not anything
Can take that away away from me
Take that away from me <start> Fun Fun Fun in the fluffy chair
Flame up the herb
Woof down the beer
Hi
I'm your video DJ
I always talk like I'm wigged out on quaaludes
I wear a satin baseball jacket everywhere I go
My job is to help destroy
What's left of your imagination
By feeding you endless doses
Of sugarcoated mindless garbage
So don't create
Be sedate
Be a vegetable at home
And thwack on that dial
If we have our way even you will believe
This is the future of rock and roll
How far will you go
How low will you stoop
To tranquilize our minds with your sugarcoated swill
You've turned rock and roll rebellion
Into Pat Boone sedation
Making sure nothing's left to the imagination
M.T.V. Get off the
M.T.V. Get off the
M.T.V. Get off the air
Get off the air
See the latest rejects from the muppet show
Wag their tits and their dicks
As they lipsynch on screen
There's something I don't like
About a band who always smiles
Another tax writeoff
For some schmuck who doesn't care
M.T.V. Get off the air
And so it was
Our beloved corporate gods
Claimed they created rock video
Allowing it to sink as low in one year
As commercial TV has in 
It's the new frontier they say
It's wide open anything can happen
But you've got a lot of nerve
To call yourself a pioneer
When you're too goddamn conservative
To take real chances.
Tineared
Graphpaper brained accountants
Instead of music fans
Call all the shots at giant record companies now
The lowest common denominator rules
Forget honesty
Forget creativity
The dumbest buy the mostest
That's the name of the game
But sales are slumping
And no one will say why
Could it be they put out one too many lousy records
M.T.V.Get off the air

All the best from my friends
You will get over it

Just find another reason
I pay more attention
Everywhere I go
All cities all centuries
Reading tarot
Looking just everywhere
Where is the glow
The only logic reason
To live for
Tell me why it hurts
Why can't I turn it into laughter
Know that time should heal my pain
My heart is back together
With bandaids I found
Drinking lots of vodka
Untill I pass out
Will I get over it
Not really sure
Just find another reason to live for
To live for
Tell me why it hurts
Why can't I turn it into laughter
Know that time should heal my pain
Tell me why I'm lost
There's no question
And there's no answer
Know that time should heal my pain <start> Dark no moon
Dark moon
The moon sheds light when all is dark
The dog's reaction is to bark
Is that the moon's fault
Tell me true
'Tis the dog's nature
So to do
The moonlight fills all heaven with mirth
The dog's a vapor
Belched by earth
The dog's a vapor
Belched by earth
Dark dark oh
There's something in you
'Tis the dog's nature
So to do

You just need someone near
I'm not looking forward to the night
I'll spend thinking of you when you're not here
How many times will I think about the things
I'd like to do
Always denied the right to live my life the way I want
I want to share it with you
Close your eyes
I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes
I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams
I'll think of your kiss as the days roll by
And I'll write the words you love
What I can't say in a letter
Will just have to wait till I get home
There's not much time to tell you
Half the things I should
Only that I'm so glad I fell in love with you
And I'd do it again if I could
Close your eyes
I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes
I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams
Sleep like a child resting deep
You don't know what you give me I keep
For these moments alone <start> Simplistic domestic shit life
Processed to fit in place
The pathetic ascetic shit life
Depressed to fill in space
Neglected rejected
Who wants this anyway
Defected directed
Hating life everyday
Who asked you to cry for me
Who asked you to lie for me
Who knows who I wanna be
You ask but you don't ask me
She's pretty how 'bout me Shit life
Your looks all that you see
Plastic elastic
Who wants this anyway
Dynamic satanic
And all the things you say
Who asked you to pray for me
Who said to believe in me
Who has to pretend for me
I'm asking you answer me
You think you're something
You're fucked in the head
You think you're something
Well I don't think so
You think you're something
You're already dead
You think you're something
Well I don't think so
Irritated frustrated shit life
Won't hear a word I say
Who asked you to write to me
Who asked you to try for me
Who asked you to live for me
Who asked you anything
You think you're something
You're fucked in the head
You think you're something
Well I don't think so
You think you're something
You're already dead
You think you're something
Well I don't think so
Well I don't well I don't

A billion years for just this night
In a way it will be alright
A blackness then the light of a million stars
As you slip into in my car
The evening sky strikes sparks
This life this life and then the next
With you I have been blessed
What more can you expect
At night at my telescope alone
This emptiness I've roamed
Searching for a home
The stars a brief string of shining charms
Rushing in right out of our arms
Into the drifting dark
This life this life and then the next
With you I have been blessed
What more can you expect
This life this life and then the next
I finger the hem of your dress
My universe at rest
We reach for starlight all night long
But gravity is too strong
Chained to this earth we go on and on and on and on and on
Then a million sighs cresting were you stood
A beauty in the neighborhood
This lonely planet never looked so good
This life this life and then the next
With you I have been blessed
What more can you expect
This life this life and then the next
I finger the hem of your dress
My universe at rest <start> Tears fall discard your innocent dreams
Loves fall they kinda leave you empty
Leaves fall the seasons pass you by
And you think that maybe you can fly
Ceilings fall with each romance you repair
Clouds fall with each moment of despair
Buildings fall the pavement is their bed
But what's the last thing that goes through your head
You take the elevator to the top the next thing you know
There you are standing on the edge
And all the flashing lights and futile cries they're all for you
Now just close your eyes and take that final step
Rains fall they dampen your will to live
Gods fall with each pleasure that you give
You fall and take the whole world with you
But will you even bother to look down
You take the elevator to the top the next thing you know
There you are standing on the edge
The circumstance it turns you inside out
So we can have peace before you find out what's inside your head
What's inside your head
You take the elevator to the topthe next thing you know
There you are standing on the edge
The circumstance it turns you inside out
So we can have peace before you find out what's inside your head
And all the flashing lights and futile cries
They're all for you now
Just close your eyes and take that final step
Just close your eyes and take that final step <start>

'Till I realize the moon
It seems so distant yet
I felt it pass right through
And I see what I see
A new world is over me
So I'll reach up to the sky
And pretend that I'm a
Spaceman in another place and time
I guess I'm lookin' for a brand new place
Is there a better life for me
Subtle wind blow me gone
Let me rest upon your move
I trust I'll end up sleeping
Cradled in my doom
And I feel what I feel
I can't grasp what is not real
So I'll get myself real high
And imagine I'm a
Spaceman in another place and time
I guess I'm lookin' for a brand new place
Is there a better life for me
And I remember in my mind
They say I'm a daydreamin'
Is it all that it seems
Or am I all the things I'm looking for Yeah
yeah and I see what I see
A new world is over me
And I'll reach up to the sky
And imagine I'm a
Spaceman in another place and time
I guess I'm lookin' for a brand new place
I remember living in a different life
Is there a better life for me <start> Good morning good afternoon
And what have you got to say
Well I'm waiting but I can't stay long
It's such a lovely day.
There's a time to be talking
And a time when it's no use.
Right now I think the things you say
Are liable to confuse.
I've just gone solo.
Do you play solo
Ain't life a solo
What a wonderful way to live
She's travelling all over the world.
Why the fame and all the golden
Opportunities unfurled.
No time for the gent with the mulliner bentley
And heaven knows what else.
Why he wouldn't even stand a chance
With all his oilwells.
She just went solo.
Do you play solo
Ain't life a solo
I've always lived in a mansion
On the other side of the moon.
I've always kept a unicorn
And I never sing out of tune.
I could tell you that the grass is really greener
On the other side of the hill
But I can't communicate with you
And I guess I never will.
We've all gone solo.
We all play solo.
Ain't life a solo <start> She brings the sunshine to a rainy afternoon
She puts the sweetness in stirs it with a spoon.
She watches for my moods never brings me down
She puts the sweetness in all around.
She knows just what to say to make me feel so good inside.
And when I'm all alone I feel I don't want to hide hide hide.
Today she brought me in told me where she'd been
She put my mind at rest put the sweetness in.
I'll ask her for some time to go and look around
She puts the sweetness in with a sound.
She knows just what to say to make a sunny day.
And when I'm all alone I really don't feel that way.
Tell me how would you feel with no world of your own and nobody to
hold
I just can't see the way I'm so glad it's today and you're here you're here.
She brings the sunshine to a rainy afternoon
She puts the sweetness in stirs it with a spoon.
She watches for my moods never brings me down
She puts the sweetness in all around.
She knows just what to say to make me feel so good inside.
And when I'm all alone I really don't feel that way.
Oh how I need her so
I know she'll never go. Doo doo doo doot n doo.
She'll never leave me believe me no. Doo doo doo doot n doo.
She'll never go no no no no no no no no no no no no. <start> Don't you ever stop
Long enough to start
Take your car out of that gear
Don't you ever stop
Long enough to start
Get your car out of that gear <start> Night
And the world is fast asleep
I will hold you here and keep
All our secret dreams and plans
You
Never thought our love could last
Now you've put that in the past
Cause you finally understand
That after all
The times you told me that we'd never be good together
After all the things you said
That made me think that you'd never call
Now you've turned around and told me
That you want to stay here forever
And you're back here in my arms
Where you belong
After all
We
All the promises we made
All the words we never said
Never knowing what was right
You didn't know
That the love we used to share
Wasn't cause it wasn't there
We'll make up for it tonight
That after all
The times you told me that we'd never be good together
After all the things you said
That made me think that you'd never call
Now you've turned around and told me
That you want to stay here forever
And you're back here in my arms
Where you belong
After all
We were young
And your dreams took you places far from me
I was wrong
To believe
That you'd go
Cause here you are
That after all
The times you told me that we'd never be good together
After all the things you said
That made me think that you'd never call
Now you've turned around and told me
That you want to stay here forever
And you're back here in my arms
Where you belong
After all <start> If youve given up would help you out if you could know
That theres more in store if you look the other way
If you get it all would you ever hope for something more
Would it make you whole with half a life ahead
Before you give it away you gotta take a little back
And find another way
Before you go it alone you gotta learn to let to let it go
Face another day
If it's getting old are you better off here than before
If you cant ignore when you look the other way
So just let it go take a look around and you will know
That theres something more when theres half a life ahead
Before you give it away you gotta take a little back
And find another way
Before you go it alone you gotta learn to let to let it go
Face another day
Even after all thats said and done you worry
Even those the odds look good you still look down
Even after all thats said and done you worry
Even those the odds look good you still look down
Before you give it away take it back
Before you give it away take it back
Before you give it away take it back
Before you give it away take it back <start> She traps a Velvet moth between her harmless hands.
Then builds an Atrium to perch on her night stand.
She lays to watch her fly.
Attracted towards the light.
She's all mine.
It's now another day in search for anything.
She'll take advantage of any human being.
She loves to watch me fly attracted toward the light.
She's not mine.
If she'd only leave the light on.
Breathes under my Velvet wings if she only left the light on.
She brings all that she used to be if she only left the light on.
I swear it's hard to tell if I'm the only one.
I found a photograph next to the Atrium.
It's faded black and white.
He's holding her so tight.
She's not mine.
If she only left the light on.
She breathes under my Velvet Wings.
If she only left the light on.
She brings all that she used to be.
If only she left the light on.
All the powder on your wings make me feel i'm everything.
And every single evening I love you with the way I sing.
I sing.
Apaga la Luz <start> The sunshine blinded me this morning love
Like the sunshine love comes and goes again
I love you I love you
The sea air it's flowing through my room again
Like the thoughts of you fill my heart with joy again
I'm sorry
I miss you
All things that live one day must die you know
Even love and the things we hold close
Look at love look at love look at love
Look what we've done
Loneliness is a very special place
To forget is something that I've never done
Silently silently you touch my face <start> I remember every bitter word.
All your tears flood my mind.
I been starin' at this empty glass.
And all my fears come to life.
Here I stand.
Alone in the dark.
Shout your name.
I will sing to the stars.
I can't love you anymore.
I surrender this war.
There's no words.
There's no time.
There's no way.
There's no fix
For the scars.
That we made.
Alone together in a broken dream.
Fast asleep in our bed of lies <start> Verse 
So if you're gonna leave me
I got a few words to say
I'm trouble in the morning
But you knew that anyway
And truth is you're the reason
That i wake up each day
I don't need anybody else
To tell me
Chorus
You are my soul rock
When the tide is up
And the waves are crashing in on me
Soul rock when I've had enough
Of the wreck of everything
These streets got an undertow
And the city is sinking
Oh you're the only hope
I hold on to
When I'm drowning
Verse 
This is for the damage
And the madness that i made
I know i can be thoughtless
But i promise that'll change
My heart may be bulletproof
But it's still gonna break
Don't say theres anybody else
Tell me
Come on tell me
Chorus x
You are my soul rock
When the tide is up
And the waves are crashing in on me
Soul rock when I've had enough
Of the wreck of everything
These streets got an undertow
And the city is sinking
Oh you're the only hope
I hold on to
When I'm drowning <start> The sun came up with no conclusions
Flowers sleeping in their beds
The city's cemetery's humming
I'm wide awake it's morning
And I have my drugs I have my woman
They keep away my loneliness
My parents they have their religion
But sleep in separate houses
I read the body count out of the paper
And now it's written all over my face
And no one ever plans to sleep out in the gutter
But sometimes that's just the most comfortable place
So I'm drinking breathing writing singing
Everyday I'm on the clock
My mind races with all my longings
But can't keep up with what I got
So I hope I don't sound too ungrateful
What history gave modern men
A telephone to talk to strangers
Machine guns and a camera lens
So when you're asked to fight a war that's over nothing
You know it's best to join the side that's gonna win
And no one's sure how all of this got started
But we're gonna make 'em God damn certain how it's gonna end
Well I could have been a famous singer
If I had someone else's voice
But failures always sounded better
Let's fuck it up boys make some noise
The sun came up with no conclusions
Flowers sleeping in their beds
The city's cemetery's humming
I'm wide awake it's morning <start> Words and music by randy owen jeff cook and richard scott
I got something cookin' and I'm boilin' way down deep.
While I'm hot and bothered why don't you give me what I need.
Your kind of lovin' really hits the spot.
The things you're doin' baby make me want what you got.
So get it get it get it while it's hot get it while it's hot.
Well standin' here beside you I can really feel the heat.
I feel your body tremblin from your head down to your feet.
I know my mind is in it but my body's almost shot.
If you want my lovin' babe better get it while it's hot.
So get it get it get it while it's hot get it while it's hot.
Get it get it get it while it's hot.
Get it get it get it while it's hot.
Get it get it get it while it's hot. <start> I set all my regrets on fire
Cause I know I'll never take the time
To unpack my missteps and call all of our friends
I figure they would take your side
I make the bed just not that well
Your name comes up a lot
When I talk to my mom
Oh I think she can tell
I was out on the town
So I came to your window last night
I tried not to throw stones
But I wanted to come inside
Now I'm causing a scene thinking you need a reason to smile
Oh no what have I done
There's no one to keep me warm
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
So maybe I should put up a fight
I'll call them back and borrow a box knife
So I can learn to live with all the stupid shit I've been doing since ninety nine
And I know I could be more clever
And I know I could be more strong
But I'm waiting for the day you come back and say
Hey maybe I should change my mind
I drink a lot
I'm not sure if that's new
But these days when I wake up from a night I forgot
I just wish that it never came true
I was out on the town
So I came to your window last night
I tried not to throw stones
But I wanted to come inside
Now I'm causing a scene thinking you need a reason to smile
Oh no what have I done
There's no one to keep me warm
And I know I could be more clever
And I know I could be more strong
And I know I could be more clever
And I know I could be more clever
I knew there would come a day when all was said and done 
Everything I was is everything but gone 
All my big mistakes are bouncing off your wall 
The bottles never break the sorrow never comes 
So come on let me in I will be the sun 
I will wake you up I am who I was 
Just open up your heart open up your heart open up your heart 
I was out on the town
So I came to your window last night
I tried not to throw stones
But I wanted to come inside
Now I'm causing a scene thinking you need a reason to smile
Oh no what have I done
There's no one to keep me warm
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh <start> All around the room your things are placed
And next to you he fills the space
And so it seems your saving grace is only saving face
The pictures of the two of you on holiday on honeymoon
You thought that he was wanting you
But he was only wanting you to
Let him off the hook
He was your imaginary friend
You were partners 'til the end
Then something bends and then it breaks your worst mistake
Accepting enemies on bended knees a litany of tragedies
You're vexed it seems you're hexed and after sex he expects
You'll let him off the hook 'til
Something that you heard while you were sleeping left you
Shaken while he stirred. When you awaken you will
Make him eat his words right off the hook...
And line every time
The credit card receipts the dirty sheets
The souvenirs of men who cheat
It all makes sense  with each offense
You wanted to believe him
He could get away with murder one
And you would clean the smoking gun
With every crime you bought each line
But not this time you'll make him
Eat his words 'cause
Something that you heard while you were sleeping left you
Shaken while he stirred
When you awaken you will
Make him eat his make him eat his
Words while he's alone 'cause you won't be around and
From now on the phone stays off the hook
And line every time
Hook and line every time <start> Cast your eyes into the distance
Try to focus on it all
Find a spirit of resistance
Instead of pride before the fall
Forge some opposition
From disparate strands
It ain't the prettiest position
As a century ends
Unstable situation
Faces made of wax
Streams of melting glass
Sheets of butchered facts
The roar of the machine
Hooded hearts and jeweled hands
And anger spilling out like gasoline
As a century ends
Everything I seen
Everything that I heard
Ain't even the tip of the iceberg
Fire down memory lane
So pass me my rose tinted glasses again
Through a fog of contradiction
Out to the lake of tears
See society admiring its own reflection
Chase a light that shines and disappears
Careful what you say 'cause reality offends
Just sit back and let your soul decay
As a century ends <start> Everything's blue in this world
He couldn't believe how easy it was

Bang

Problems do have solutions you know
A lifetime of fucking things up fixed
In one determined flash
Everything's blue
Everything's blue in this world
All fuzzy
Spilling out of my head
The deepest shade
All spilling
He couldn't believe how easy it was
The deepest shade of mushroom blue
Everything's blue in this world
A lifetime of fucking things up fixed
A lifetime of
The deepest shade
All fuzzy
Spilling
Bang
He couldn't believe how
Bang
He couldn't believe how easy it was
Bang
He couldn't believe
Bang
The deepest shade of mushroom blue
The deepest shade
The deepest shade
Bang
All fuzzy
Spilling out of
The deepest shade of mushroom blue
The deepest shade of mushroom <start> I watch the way he looks at you
He don't see you like I do
He'll never speak the words I long to say
He don't know that what he's got
Is everything I'll ever want
I can't keep this inside one more day
If you were my girl
My feet would never touch the ground
If you were my girl
My heart would shout your name out loud
I could conquer the world if you were my girl.
You're the prayer I pray when I'm on my knees
The oxygen that lets me breathe
The flame that burns inside me all the time
Every note of a beautiful melody
The perfect rhyme in poetry
Baby you are everything but mine
If you were my girl
My feet would never touch the ground
If you were my girl
My heart would shout your name out loud
There's nothing that I could not do
If it was you I came home to
I could conquer the world if you were my girl
Baby I swear this flame will burn eternally
So keep your eyes open jump on in
You will see what you need is me
If you were my  girl
Oh I'd never want to see you cry 
But you're with him and I don't know why
What a different world if you were my girl
I would conquer the world if you were my girl <start> Am I drowning you out
Bursts of defection
If everything was up to me I would be gone by the first sign
The first sign of hope I'd be packed up and out of my way
Time has been spread so thin
It's just hours till the day begins
And the things that are you keeping you here are not keeping me here
The things that are keeping you here are keeping me away
You'll be sorry isn't that what they'll say
Don't follow your heart cause it just seems to get in your way
Don't ever leave here
And mope at your leisure
And straighten out your crease dear
And truth is in a tall beer
Are you drowning your fear
With a glass of deception
When everything is easy then everything will be okay
When everything is easy then you won't be sad that you stayed
Time has been spread so thin
It's just hours till the day begins
And the things that are you keeping you here are not keeping me here
The things that are keeping you here are keeping me away
You'll be sorry isn't that what they'll say
Don't follow your heart cause it just seems to get in your way
Don't ever leave here
And mope at your leisure
And straighten out your priest dear
And truth is in a jar here <start> There's a light in your eyes tonight
You know I'd know that look anywhere
You've got plans and I'm one lucky man
Before we get so carried away
There's just something I've been wanting to say
When we make love
It's more to me than just an affair
I want you to know how much I care
When we make love
Oh it's such a precious time
We share our hearts our souls and our minds
When we make love
Watching you make your little moves
I can tell it's gonna be a long night
All day long we keep holding on
It couldn't be any better than this
I got it all at my fingertips
When we make love
It's more to me than just an affair
I want you to know how much I care
When we make love
Oh it's such a precious time
We share our hearts our souls and our minds
When we make love
These moments these feelings
Mmmmmmm
When we make love
It's more to me than just an affair
I want you to know how much I care
When we make love
Oh it's such a precious time
We share our hearts our souls and our minds
When we make love
Now let's make love
Sweet love <start> I've seen the end of the day come too soon
Not a lot to say not a lot to do
You played the game you owe nothing to yourself
Rest a day for tomorrow you can't tell
You can't tell
I've seen the end of the day come too late
Seen the love you had turning into hate
Had to act like I didn't even care
But I did so I got stranded standing there
Standing there
It's nothing that I haven't seen before
But it still kills me like it did before
No it's nothing that I haven't seen before
But it still kills me like it did before
I've seen the end of the day come too soon
Like the prison dogs they set out after you
You owe nothing to the past but wasted time
To serve a sentence that was only in your mind
In your mind <start> Just wanted you to know the kid you beat up at the show
he just happened to be my brother.
It was his first but I don't think there will be another.
Because of you and all your friends
you made sure he knew where he didn't fit in.
Is this what it comes to
I thought we dropped this shit in high school
Just wanted to thank you for intimidating everyone in the scene
are the doors closed
No more applicants being accepted
Just wanted to thank you for being the jock I always hated in high school.
Now here's another story to tell all of your friends.
Tell them how you brought hardcore to an end
for the kid that thought he had found something new
what if this happened to you
When you first started coming around
and we made you feel like you couldn't be down
my guess is that you wouldn't be down.
It's time to give it up
because I've had enough of your shit and the kids you beat up on
it's not about who's been here and for how long
since when did style and social status decide whether you can like a band
what about what's inside <start> Will you come to my rescue once again
Will you search through the wreckage once again
Will you turn on your flashlight and scan for signs of life again
Wooooo
Will you come to my rescue once again
Will you send down some water oxygen
Will you come to my rescue come to my rescue once again
Sometimes I get lonely sometimes I get lonely Sometimes I get lonely
Noo I never thought that it would be this hard to find love
Woooo I never thought that it would be this hard to find love
Will you come to my rescue once again
Maybe give me the will to sing again
Will you come to my rescue Come to my rescue once again
Sometimes I get lonely sometimes I get lonely sometimes I get lonely
Noo I never thought that it would be this hard to find love
Ohhh I never thought that it would be this hard to find love
Ohhh nanananana
Oh I really messed it up my friend
Well I hope you can help me hope you can help me once again
Woooo I never thought that it would be this hard to find love
Wooooo I never thought that it would be this hard to find love
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah  Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
To find ..
Come to my rescue once again
Come to my rescue once again
Come to my rescue once again
Come to my rescue once again
Sometimes I get lonely <start> Two hearts throwing off sparks
Young and in love with our freedom
Moonlight those soft Southern nights
We were both ripe to fall
Well I was out on my own
Playing for all who would listen
And you were as free as a bird
Flying from nest to nest
But somewhere our eyes met
And our hands reached out
And we felt a kindred spirit
And as our faces touched
I could feel the fire
And needed so to just be near it
Oh Lord those moments we soared
Borne on the wings of our passion
It seemed then like theyd never end
But times like that always must
Cause then one day I flew far away from you
I never knew how Id regret
My sweet Magnolia belle you know Ive loved you well
Even if I never said it
Magnolia now I see
That freedom isnt free
And loves the only true redeemer
And when this journeys through
Ill be coming back for you
If youll have this foolish dreamer
I spend a night now and then
Passing through town on my travels
But someday Im gonna come back to stay
Magnolia Im coming home <start> Completely colorblind these red lights are going unseen
Fall behind with words unsaid you know they're always obscene
'cause my ears they bled before I need to let them heal
She fell out her broken legs won't let her walk away
From this town that couldn't give a single shit either way
And her fears they bled before she's convinced that they're real
What are you looking for
Are you looking for something more
It's not me
It's not me
Lost her way from everything she swore she knew a friend
Run away from start to finish though it never ends
In her mind she is blinded by all she sees
Close your eyes just pretend the bullet isn't there
No surprise no need to pretend that no one really cares
But in her eyes you will find the very best in me
What are you looking for
Are you looking for something more
It's not me
It's not me <start> Once so mysterious
Now decoded and used
Now according to you you
What's so mysterious
Once so mysterious
Now decoded and used
Now according to you you
What's so mysterious
Wear it well well you have worn it out
Give it all well could you give it up
Where's the fun in holding all the cards
Everyone gets up when you sit down
I don't get it just don't get it
I don't get it just don't
I don't get it just don't get it
I don't get it just don't
I don't get it just don't get it
I don't get it just don't
I don't get it just don't get it
I don't get it just don't
I don't get it just don't get it
I don't get it just don't
I don't get it just don't get it
I don't get it just don't
When the party's over we can call the dogs
Dare to keep our shirts on rolling in the muck
Weekend in the dust
Weekend full of blood
If you're real I'll be a hologram
Why have none when you can have it all
I don't get it just don't get it
I don't get it just don't
I don't get it just don't get it
I don't get it just don't
I don't get it just don't get it
I don't get it just don't
I don't get it just don't get it
I don't get it just don't
I don't get it just don't get it
I don't get it just don't
I don't get it just don't get it
I don't get it just don't <start> I save all my suffering for myself
I won't share the things I feel with anyone else
Try to bury the night leave it far behind
Don't want to call it by name but I think it's the end of the line
End of the line
With a loveless heart I'll face you up tonight
Cause you're the only true thing I have left in my life
I'll carry those demons wherever I go
There's a hot wind blowing but it won't bring me home
End of the line
We're all losing grip we're all on the edge
High above the street on our own personal ledge
I don't know your problems and I can't life your life
We've got a different ball and chain and I can't stop the night
Give me air I need room to breathe those demons are in me
And I can't make them leave
I'm coming up for air and I get pushed back down
It's all up in flames and I can't put them out
Thought I was ready but I watched my chance pass by
And the road I've chosen is coming to the end of the line
End of the line <start> Stereo
We hear both sides
We sympathize
We live our lives in stereo
The left and the right
The dark and the light
We wrestle with the balance
We change our tone
We leave our phone
And tape record our absence
In lovin' memory
Stereo
We're livin' it in stereo
We fix it so our love is high fidelity
Mix it so we never lose the melody
We try to equalize our lives in stereo
So on we go
From side to side
As we divide
A single life in stereo
The far and the wide
We override
The feedback from the others
The unkind phrase
We lock in phase
We're only really listening to the stereo
Stereo
We're livin' it in stereo
We tune it till we have a perfect parody
Commune with such a finecut crystal clarity
It seems to symbolize
Our lives in stereo
Oo  yeah yeah yeah
Oo  yeah yeah yeah
Oo 
Stereo
Stereo
We fix it so our love is high fidelity
Mix it so we never lose the melody
We try to equalize our lives in stereo
Stereo
Stereo
We fix it so our love is high fidelity
Mix it so we never lose the melody
We try to equalize our lives in stereo <start> You always said that I'd be back again
That I'd come running to you in the end
I thought that you were on your own
And now I find you're not alone
I'll see you through the rain
Through the heartache and pain
It hurts like never before
You're not alone any more
You always said that I would know someday
Just how it feels when your love walks away
I let you down I let you go
I lost you how was I to know
I'll see you through the rain
Through the heartache and pain
It hurts like never before
You're not alone any more
I never knew I could feel this way
I never could see past yesterday
You feel that everything is gone
I feel it too you're not alone
I'll see you through the rain
Through the heartache and pain
It hurts like never before
You're not alone any more <start> Neverending always You will never end
Because Youre always neverending
You were there before there was beginning
Always You were You are neverending
Here You are now with us
Here we are found in You
And this makes all the difference
This changes everything
Making our whole existence
Worth something so we sing

Just to get on level ground
Shake your seasick legs around
Dead of winter in a logo town
Signs of life are soft and flickering
Need a bed to lay my body down
Dead weight to carry down
Some static is lulling me to sleep
Hang your clothes on a chain link fence
In a junkyard say amen
Your mouth is full of wordless hymns
And runon sentences
And they're helpless and forgetting in the background
Holding nothing
And they're youthless and pretending with their bare hands
Holding nothing
There's a million horses dragging down a monolith
With these trademarks so bereaved
Tied my leg to a barricade
With a plastic hand grenade
They tried to turn emotion into noise
Need a teleprompter for my life
Need a pipeline to the night
My body can't get no relief
And this life it goes by fast
You're treading water in the past
Trying to reanimate something that you can't understand
And they're helpless and forgetting in the background saying nothing
And he's youthless and forgetting with his bare hands touching nothing
And he's helpless and forgetting in the background saying nothing

And all the songs we used to play
The thing that sticks in my mind most
Is not how badly each one goes
But what they mean to me
This one especially
When I'm alone with you it seems all my dreams
come true
It makes me feel so good I just can't help loving you
'Cause your everything I could hope for
That's why I love you
Sometimes I tell myself this girl don't love you nomore
And that someday with someone new she'll walk from your door
But if you did my world would break in two
That's why I love you
And anytime I see your face
Something very unusual takes place
All my inhibitions disappear
Now that you are here <start> Burning all your bridges to the ground
Forgetting all your omens lay them down
calling in the darkness
but i cant see your face
i will stay here tonight
praying for your grace
cause i sold my soul to the devil I remember
choking on that cold dark december
i would do it all again for you for you
Burning all your bridges to the ground
Forgetting all your omens lay them down
Just to hear you breathing is all I need to hear
Don't you turn away dear
there's nothing left to hear
cause I sold my soul to the devil I remember
choking on that cold dark December
I would do it all again for you for you
coz I sold my soul to the devil I remember
choking on that cold dark December
I would do it all again for you for you
where are we going there's no way of knowing
I'm kneeling and praying so scared to believe in
what you are saying and walking away
to a place I've been saving
where no one can reach me
so where are we going there's no way of knowing
I'm kneeling and praying so scared to believe in
what you are saying and walking away
to a place my home

Puttin' them back in a sack his mama packed
With a sticker that say's 'Jesus Loves You'
He's jumpin off the bus runnin' in the house
Talkin' to mom about his day
Hidin' that paper sack in a baseball glove
Ridin' his bike straight to the freeway
Where there's an old man with a shoppin' cart
With a dirty face and a purple heart
Who's sayin' son you'll never know how much this means
Boy say's
Wouldn't you do this for me
If I were reachin' out to you
Wouldn't you give me food to eat if I were hungry to
Wouldn't you do this for me
Tonight that little boy's dad is flyin' down the freeway
It's pourin' rain as he leaves the road
He's rolling down that concrete bank
Through the flames and the broken glass
An old man takes his hand
Finds a cell phone on the backseat
He's sayin' get here fast as you can
Now the bum that lives beneath the bridge
Pulls him safely from that flooding ditch
Man asked why'd you risk your life to save mine
He said
Wouldn't you do this for me
If I were reachin' out to you
Wouldn't you try to save my life if I needed you to
Wouldn't you do this for me
Now he's layin' in that hospital bed prayin' a silent prayer
And he can't help but ask him
Lord did you put that beggar there
As a nurse pulls back the curtains
All he can see is a billboard sign
A sixty foot Jesus hangin' on the cross
At the bottom just one line
Wouldn't you do this for me
Wouldn't you do this for me
Wouldn't you <start> Tak pernah ku fahami ertimu padaku

Cinta yang tak akan pergi
Menyesal ku akui tak terima cintamu
Dan kini engkau pergi meninggalkan hidupku

There ain't a cloud up above
I got a picture in a locket
That says baby I love you
Well if you didn't look then boys
Then fellas don't go lookin' now
Well here she comes awalkin'
All that heaven will allow
Say hey there mister bouncer
Now all I want to do is dance
But I swear I left my wallet
Back home in my workin' pants
C'mon Slim slip me in man
I'll make it up to you somehow
I can't be late I got a date
With all that heaven will allow
Rain and storm and dark skies
Well now they don't mean a thing
If you got a girl that loves you
And who wants to wear your ring
So c'mon mister trouble
We'll make it through you somehow
We'll fill this house with all the love
All that heaven will allow
Now some may want to die young man
Young and gloriously
Get it straight now mister
Hey buddy that ain't me
'Cause I got something on my mind
That sets me straight and walkin' proud
And I want all the time
All that heaven will allow <start> Like a man on a wire
I balance between
A heart filled with desire
A head that knows everything
Somewhere out in the middle
You found me
I've got one foot in the clouds
One foot on the ground
You keep me steady somehow
Keep me from looking down
Somewhere out in the middle
You found me
Falling into you
Is safe and sound
You open up my eyes
I see it now
You're my saving grace
You're my saving grace
I run to my hiding place
My saving grace
My life hangs on a string
But I'm not afraid
I feel your love down below me
If it starts to break
Somewhere out in the open
You found me
Falling into you
Is safe and sound
You open up my eyes
I see it now
You're my saving grace
You're my saving grace
I run to my hiding place
My saving grace
My saving grace
Carry me now
On your shoulder
I won't look down
Pull me closer

On your shoulder
I won't look down
Pull me closer
Pull me closer
You're my saving grace

It's you I come round to see again
You know that I'll always be near
You're flesh and blood and you're my memory
Live on in my memory.
I send you nothing but love
Just wait and see
I send you nothing but love
Just wait for me
Wait and see
Wait and see.
Great words you know all the right words to say
You don't always lean in my way
You don't always mean what you say.
Whenever I need a friend
It's you I come round to see again
An' everything that you do
Is everything I will ask of you
You could ask me too.
I send you nothing but love
Just wait an' see
I send you nothing but love
Just wait for me
Wait and see
Wait and see.
Great words you know all the right words to say
You don't have to lean in my way
We don't have to mean what we say. <start> Pontius Pilate came to our town
Up to the dockyards to see the
picket line
We asked him to help but he just
turned around
He's the leader of the union now
Leader of the union
All of our questions he ignored
He washed his hands and he
dreamed of his reward
A seat in the House of Lords
One by one
The ships come sailing in
One by one
The ships go sailing out
We live for words and die for words
Principles we can afford
When all our Brothers turn to Lords
Whose side are you on
You tell the world your hands are
tied
History three times denied
A sea of changes three miles wide
Whose side are you on
One by one
The ships come sailing in
One by one
The ships go sailing out
This conspiracy of shame
Murder by some other name
Play up and play the game
Whose side are you on
If any ask us why we died
We tell them that our leaders lied
Sold us out down the riverside
Whose side are you on
One by one
The ships come sailing in
One by one
The ships go sailing out <start> When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I would offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love.
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love.
I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong.
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong.
I'd go hungry I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love.
The storms are raging on a rolling sea
Down on the highway of regret.
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.
I did make you happy make your dreams come true
There's nothing that I would not do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love.
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love. <start> There's nowhere left to hide
from the fatman and all his lies
a TV puppetpolitician
He thinks his words so fine
great important and divine
a th century magician
in reality he's nothing but a shark
He appears to be a shadow in the dark
He's making rules and laws
to satisfy his greed paws
He's got this art down to perfection
Ideals improvised
what's good for him is legalised
for he's the leader of the nation
but a dog that bites
will seldom ever bark
all his slogans fade to nothingness
for he is but a shadow in the darkness
every step they take
every move they make
everything is fake
just an illusion
madmen rise and fall
many heads may roll
but they don't care at all
and sow confusion
Their perverted schemes
are reaching their peak
insanity reigns
Simple parasites
they feed off the weak
posessing their brains
undercover of the titles they hold
that makes them so bold
another blindman trips and falls
and deaf men cannot hear at all
they smile towards
their self destruction
yesmen nod and bow their heads
could own their own minds but instead
they're just like puppets of corruption
and they play their game while corpses
pave their way
and they'll force a smile
until the day the racing shadows
finally fade away
there's a fire burning in our hearts
it throws a light upon their dubious talk
let the fire burn
to disclise all their lies
let them play their games
but be true to yourself
and the flames will rage
until the day
the racing shadows finally fade away <start> I was working in a shithole one day
Some fool came up to me and said
you'd make a star with that band
I said it's not why we're doing this
Why can't you fucking get it
'Cause all I've got to do is release through
These obstacles I've got to beat
Release from the man who manipulates me
By the breaking of my back
With nothing left worth saving
All I gotta do is release through the
Obstacles I've yet to beat
Take us to a sturdy ship
Where we raise our glasses
No pints too dodgy here
We don't need our problems here
Away from all these people
They're posing about waiting for the next scheme
To tip them off and leave them drowning
In what they think is real
All that's ever been and all that's been said
It's not to my regret you gotta
Face the edge of yourself
And they say if you got humor through it all
You'll find the will to survive what seems like hell
Take me to the water launch me out to bloody sea
'Cause all you gotta do is release
Through these obstacles you've got to beat
Take us to the water
Launch us out to sea
And may the drunken mad ones follow me <start> The roof the roof the roof is on fire
We don't need no water let the motherfucker burn
Burn motherfucker burn
Hello my name is Jimmy Pop and I'm a dumb white guy
I'm not old or new but middle school fifth grade like junior high

'Cause she all fly
But I can take the heat cause I'm the other white meat known as 'Kid
Funky Fried'
Yea I'm hung like planet Pluto hard to see with the naked eye
But if I crashed into Uranus I would stick it where the sun don't
Shine
Cause I'm kind of like Han Solo always stroking my own wookie
I'm the root of all that's evil yea but you can call me cookie
The roof the roof the roof is on fire
We don't need no water let the motherfucker burn
Burn motherfucker burn
Yo yo this hardcore ghetto gangster image takes a lot of practice
I'm not black like Barry White no I am white like Frank Black is
So if man is five and the devil is six than that must make me seven
This honkey's gone to heaven
But if I go to hell then I hope I burn well
I'll spend my days with J.F.K. Marvin Gaye Martha Raye and Lawrence
Welk
And Kurt Cobain Kojak Mark Twain and Jimi Hendrix's poltergeist
And Webster yea Emmanuel Lewis cause he's the antiChrist
The roof the roof the roof is on fire
We don't need no water let the motherfucker burn
Burn motherfucker burn

An uncertain day starts
Another fake war
What will it take

Your hand on the blade

Are you ready

An uncertain day starts
Another fake war
What will it take
Are you ready
While you wait
You're at the neighbours
Your hand on the blade
Of the mother's slave
First they sold you
A threat to your life
Imminent phase
Of a fear unknown
Then they told you
Best that we strike now
Before them others do
It becomes you
Empathy slides
You will know hate
Of the fear alone
Then they own you
Better just strike now
Before them others do
While you wait
An uncertain day starts
Another fake war
What will it take
Are you ready
While you wait
You're at the neighbours
Your hand on the blade
Of the mother's slave
You believe what you want to
Remove what you know
When your heart is the truth from the lie
And the dream that you know
Is the furtherest thing from the fates of the hopeless who die
As you sell the machine
Are you certain you are not the face of the world you despise
You know that's the truth
You're indifferent

While you wait
An uncertain day starts
Another fake war
What will it take
Are you ready
While you wait
You're at the neighbours
Your hand on the blade
Of the mother's slave
Are you ready
While you wait
An uncertain day starts
Another fake war
What will it take
Are you ready
While you wait
You're at the neighbours
Your hand on the blade
Of the mother's slave
Are you ready
While you wait <start> All wound up
On the edge
Terrified
Sleep disturbed
Restless mind
Petrified
Clouds of fear
Permeate
All I see
Heightening
Nervousness
Threatens me
I am paralyzed
So afraid to die
Cut of cord
Warning signs
Never show
Tension strikes
Jokingly
Worries grow
Why do I feel so numb
Is it something to do with where I come from
Should this be fight or flight
I don't know why I'm constantly so uptight
Rapid heartbeat pounding through my chest
Agitated body in distress
I feel like I'm in danger
Daily life is strangled by my stress
A stifling surge shooting through all my veins
Extreme apprehension suddenly I'm insane
No strong hope for redemption
A grave situation desperate at best
Why do I feel so numb
Is it something to do with where I come from
Should this be fight or flight
I don't know why I'm constantly feeling...
Helpless hysteria
A false sense of urgency
Trapped in my phobia
Possessed by anxiety
Run try to hide
Overwhelmed by this
Conflicts delirium
Helpless hysteria

Trapped in my phobia
Possessed by anxiety
Run try to hide
Overwhelmed by this
Conflicts delirium <start> When was it that you lost your youth or traded
It for something more for them to use so jaded
Why is it that you never said
I love you more than just a friend
I pray this gridlock never ends
And when we get there just depends
I found out recently that you are leaving
For good I hope I softly tell me ceiling
It's better now to be alive
Sleeping is my nine to five
I'm having nightmares all the time
Of running out of words that rhyme
Everything that you could never say
Would never matter anyway
I took a hammer and two nails to my eardrums long ago
Before that steak knife took my eyes
I looked up to the sky
For the last thing I would ever see
For the last time I'd cry
When was it that you sold your life or wasted
Every bite of that small slice you never tasted
I guess I should be one to talk
There's nights that I can't even walk
There's days I couldn't give a fuck
And in between is where i'm stuck
From blocks away I heard somebody screaming
That small child inside of you that you left bleeding
You stabbed him up not once but twice
Cubicles will now suffice
Some say it's the roll of the dice
I think they're wrong I know I'm right
Every breath that I could barely breathe
Could barely make it past my teeth
I took a blowtorch to both of my lungs a long long time ago
Every step that I could take
Every one more difficult to make
Mr. Chainsaw came and took my legs a long long time ago
In case you're wondering I'm singing about growing up and giving in
In case you're wondering we're singing about growing up
About giving up and giving in <start> I want to show you that anything is possible
I want to show you that your wildest dreams can come true
And I swear someday I'm gonna figure out how to do just that
But until then I guess trying is all I can do
Chorus
Maybe I'm wrong thinking you want something better
Maybe I'm wrong thinking you got no problem making it through the night
Maybe I'm wrong about every little thing I'm talking about
Maybe I'm wrong but just maybe maybe I'm right
No it's none of my business but I think I can make you happy
But it really doesn't matter if it's me or it's someone else
All that I know is that I think you're kinda special
And one way or another gonna see that I can treat you well
Chorus
You seem to think that Lady Luck just doesn't like you
Well I've been trying to believe that the Lady just ain't that dumb
Oh just give her time to get here
And I'm sure that when she gets here
She'll be really glad to be here when she comes
Chorus x  <start> Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo
Well they closed down the auto plant in Mahwah late that month
Ralph went out lookin' for a job but he couldn't find none
He came home too drunk from mixin' Tanqueray and wine
He got a gun shot a night clerk now they call'm Johnny 
Down in the part of town where when you hit a red light you don't stop
Johnny's wavin' his gun around and threatenin' to blow his top
When an offduty cop snuck up on him from behind
Out in front of the Club Tip Top they slapped the cuffs on Johnny 
Well the city supplied a public defender but the judge was Mean John Brown
He came into the courtroom and stared young Johnny down
Well the evidence is clear gonna let the sentence son fit the crime
Prison for ninety eight and a year and we'll call it even Johnny 
A fist fight broke out in the courtroom they had to drag Johnny's girl away
His mama stood up and shouted Judge don't take my boy this way
Well son you got a statement you'd like to make
Before the bailiff comes to forever take you away
Now judge judge I had debts no honest man could pay
The bank was holdin' my mortgage and they were gonna take my house away
Now I ain't sayin' that make me an innocent man
But it was more 'n all this that put that gun in my hand
Well your honor I do believe I'd be better off dead
So if you can take a man's life for the thoughts that's in his head
Then won't you sit back in that chair and think it over judge one more time
And let 'em shave off my hair and put me on that execution line <start> Down south in New Orleans
The prettiest girls I've ever seen.
Sparkling eyes lips so sweet
we make love to the Rumba beat.
Ship's at anchor my suitcase packed
Got a one way ticket ain't comin' back.
Life's a pleasure love's no dream
Down south in New Orleans.
My dark eyed baby I'm on my way
Back into your arms to stay.
I'm tired of work I wanna play.
I'll make sweet love to you night and day.
Down south in New Orleans
The prettiest girls I've ever seen.
Sparkling eyes lips so sweet
we make love to the Rumba beat.
Ship's at anchor my suitcase packed
Got a one way ticket ain't comin' back.
Life's a pleasure love's no dream
Down south in New Orleans.
I want to get too loose on Toulose Street
I wanna kiss all the Creole girls I see.
Drink all day dance all night.
Do it wrong 'til I do it right. <start> I never knew love was so nice
I never kissed anyone twice
I never wanted a beau
Poor me I just didn't know.
You came along I got a thrill
One kiss from you I feel it still.
Now each time you look my way
You're gonna hear me say
Come on and do what you do
It seems so new what you do
It thrills me through what you do
So do what you do some more
You know I love what you do
Keep dreaming of what you do
Don't be above what you do
But do what you do some more
Can't get enough of the kisses you throw me
I need a big supply
Give me the kisses you owe me.
Oh me oh my
Do I adore what you do
More and more and more and more what you do
I'm crazy for what you do
So do what you do some more <start> Drowsy eyes
Waves are crashing on the shore
No longer make out any form
Drift to sleep
Beneath cool sheets
As when I was a boy
Waves rolling on the shore
In distant sound
Dark in heaven baby that's for sure
Dark in heaven baby that's for sure
Settling voice
Endless depth in my ears
Tongue that sears
Hopes and fears
The voice is infinite
Starlit seas
Midnight breeze beneath cool sheets
The surf sighs in sympathy
Drift to sleep
Dark in heaven baby that's for sure
Dark in heaven baby that's for sure <start> Mary Ann
I'm really crazy about you
Do what I can
I just can't live without you
Mary Ann
Mary Ann
Mary Ann
My life was built around stars and sound
Your eyes were pools of laughter
Mary Ann
I thought you were my man <start> I won't need much
Just my own space
A little time
With my own thoughts
And my own space
Some place to run
Some place to hide
Where there is no one else
But me to meet inside
I love you more
Than I can ever say
I love you more and more and more
With every passing day
Allow me light
A breath of air
Leave me the only thing
I own we cannot share
Just leave me that
Sweet love of mine
Just leave me that
Just my own space
And we'll be fine
I love you more
Than I could ever say
I love you more and more and more
With every passing day
Allow me light
A breath of air
Leave me the only thing
I own we cannot share
Just my own space
Sweet love of mine
Just leave me that
Just my own space
And we'll be fine <start> Five o'clock fade away the shadows
Leaving by the window or the door
And they're laughing
Laughing at you anyway
Yeah they're laughing
Laughing at you every day
Eight o'clock underneath the lamplight
Slow poison from a tiny little wound
And they're laughing
Laughing at you anyway
Yeah they're laughing
Laughing at you every day
I understood before I knew
I realized I'd spend my life coming back to you
Laughing at you
Laughing at you
Twelve o'clock in the building of the mirrors
Recoil from my elongated twin
And he's laughing
He's laughing at you anyway
Yeah he's laughing
He's laughing at you every day
I understood before I knew
'Til I realized I'd spend my life coming back to you
I understood before I knew
I realized I'd spend my life coming back to you
I understood before I knew
I realized I'd spend my life coming back to you <start> Do what you must
Blow off the dust
All these shackles and chains
And growing pains
So many lives secrets and lies
In minutes and hours memories devoured
One look in your eyes sound in your voice
Speaking to me a sequel to me
Across the ocean a thousand seas
Cannot disguise your unfaithful Key
Picked a lock and it wasn't me
Picked a lock and it wasn't me
Look what you've done the cowardly run
No holy water can wash away aura
Or the loose lips to sink our ship
Or the loose lips to sink our ship
You blew out the candle on someone's cake
Happy birthday disgraceful mistake
I'll throw you a party invite top dog

And I don't know about you
But I am alive
Lately it seems
That I need a hand
In a fallen world
I just want to stand
What would Jesus do walkin' in my shoes
Workin' at my job and goin' to my school
And I hear people say Jesus is the way
I believe and that is why I'm asking you
What would Jesus do
And as we all know
Life can be tough
And all that we need is lovesweet love
So where do we go Well here's what I see
To change my world

What would Jesus do walkin' in my shoes
Workin' at my job and goin' to my school
And I hear people say Jesus is the way
I believe and that is why I'm asking you
What would Jesus do
Sometimes choices don't seem black and white
And they can leave you black and blue
What would Jesus do walkin' in my shoes
Workin' at my job and goin' to my school
And I hear people say Jesus is the way
I believe and that is why I'm asking you
What would Jesus do

What would Jesus do He'd give His life for you
If you follow Him you'll give your life to them
Shine on shine on follow with Jesus
Shine on shine on follow with Jesus <start> Well yeah yeah yeah One of these mornings it won't be long
Captain's gonna call and I'll be gone
I'll be nine hundred miles away from home
You can count the days I'm gone
You can tell the train I'm on
You can hear the whistle blow as she rolls by
She rolls by she rolls by
Hear the whistle blow as she rolls by
My olden shoes are worn
My olden clothes are torn
And I hate to go home now thisaway
Thisaway thisaway
Hate to go home thisaway
Well if my Mama she says so I'll railroad no more
I'll sidetrack my train and go home
And go home and go home
Sidetrack my train and go home
If I die a Railroad Man
I want to be buried in the sand
So I can hear old No.  as she rolls by
She rolls by she rolls by
Hear old No.  as she rolls by <start> Issa <start> Have you told her son about the alcohol and medicine
Or the wasted days while friendships frayed
Where you could barely carry your weight
Flip the lights down or pretend you're not alone
And spill the secrets
You bought and sold for rock and roll dreams
Flip the lights down or pretend you're not alone
And spill the secrets
You bought and sold for rock and roll dreams
Have you told her son how you up and leave all your loved ones
How all the lies slip past your tongue
You choke them down like smoke in your lungs
Flip the lights down or pretend you're not alone
And spill the secrets
You bought and sold for rock and roll dreams
Flip the lights down or pretend you're not alone
And spill the secrets
You bought and sold for rock and roll dreams <start> Everybody's gonna catch their death
In the pouring rain
Everybody better hold their breath
In the pouring rain
Everybody's gonna walk on by
Everybody hide away
Everybody's gonna pull their blinds
And stay inside and pass these days
I know I've seen a lot
Lord knows sometimes I've cried
But I know we can't sit like this and shake our fists
While lovers kiss and die in the pouring rain
In the pouring rain
I was hungry and I'm hungry still
And now it's pouring rain
I look okay but I've been feeling ill
And now it's pouring rain
Well hush now baby don't you cry
Tears won't wipe away the pain
There's a storm been blowing through the night
That's washed us down with lethal rain well
Sometimes this world's too big
Sometimes we feel too small
Sometimes you'll have to pick me up
When I grow tired stumble trip and fall
In the pouring rain in the pouring rain
In the pouring rain in the pouring rain
I'm gonna walk on by

I'm gonna walk on by

Walk

I'm gonna walk

I'm gonna walk on by

I'm gonna walk on by

In the pouring rain

Don't wanna see you cry

I'm gonna walk on by

I'm gonna walk talk
Incomprehensible

I'm gonna walk

In the pouring rain
 <start> A thousand dreamers crept as one
Journey'd by the colder sun
Knocked at the chamber's gate
Yet this sleeper does not wake
In the oracle overhung
With careless whispers ivystung
Their tiny fingers cling to warmth
A home for the love weary heart
Onward sacrarium time sojourns
Polanquin leads this path adorned
While reverent creatures soft prepare
The slumberous beauty carried there
And lay their hands on silken skin
As through these veins the gods did run
Two thousand arms in twilight
Endless dream and endless night
Past echoed ruins overgrown
Small voices drift in ancient tongue
Mindful to their deepest wish
For a home to the love weary heart
In soft embrace I now arise
And search for peace in hungering eyes
Thy faces change my love renames
Our starlit world the past remains
Forgotten by linnear spite
One thousand pairs of second sight
Who through my eyes at last may see
We are divinity
We choose to be <start> Adam ant

SO PLEASED TO MEET YOU
I'VE WAITED FOR YOU
MY WHOLE LIFE NOW IT'S HERE
AND WE CAN NEVER BE
ALWAYS KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU
MY WHOLE LIFE TILL I DIE
A SONG AWAY FROM YOU
Beethoven's Sweethearts it's our song
I haven't told you yet I'm not that strong
some say some say I have a lot to say
when I'm around you I say nothing at all
I'll save the world to be with you
SO PLEASED TO MEET YOU
I'VE WAITED FOR YOU
MY WHOLE LIFE NOW IT'S HERE
AND WE CAN NEVER BE
ALWAYS KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU
MY WHOLE LIFE TILL I DIE
A SONG AWAY FROM YOU
SO PLEASED TO MEET YOU
I'VE WAITED FOR YOU
NEVER HAD A CHANCE LIKE A STAR IN THE SKY
AS THE LIGHT THAT SHINES INSIDE OF YOU
ALWAYS KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU
AS THE TRAINS COLLIDE EVERYTHING IS FINE
THE BROKEN STOP SIGN POINTS TO YOU
ALWAYS KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU
MY WHOLE LIFE TILL I DIE
A SONG AWAY FROM
ALWAYS KNOW
AS THE MAIN FRAME KEEPS IT
I'LL HAVE THIS SECRET
A SONG AWAY FROM YOU <start> Cast away all the enemies of yesterday
To alleviate all the memories that come our way
There's a better life now you know that I am on your side
Your beady eyes burn a hole right through the back of mine
I am out of time
chorus
I'm an ordinary man
Like everybody else
Just a common counter fan
I'm an ordinary man
Hesitate while the world is just a step away
To recreate all the innocence that time can take
I am wide awake
Chorus <start> I've watched my dreams all fade away
And blister in the sun
Everything I've ever had is unraveled and undone
I've set upon a worthless stack
Of my ambitious plans
And the people that I've loved the most
Have turned their backs and ran
This is the good life
I've lost everything
I could ever want
And ever dream of
This is the good life
I found everything
I could need
Here in your arms
Loneliness has left me searching
For someone to love
Poverty has changed my view
Of what true riches are
Sorrow's opened up my eyes
To see what real joy is
Pain has been the catalyst
To my heart's happiness <start> 



 

 
  <start> I just finished putting my seventh drink away
A week now since her death and a drink for every day
Soon it will be fifty and I won't be worrying about ulcers
No longer do I dream and my mind is far away
I'm thinking like an animal  almost unconsciously
Soon I'll be nocturnal and knocking over your garbage
And I'll walk and I'll find solace
And the sun will shine upon me like a mother keep me warm  my pulse
goes...
I see hallucinations of figures like yourself
I feel like I'm on acid and you're alive and well
Hope you get well soon  wait 'til you see your new grandson
We'll walk and we'll part in a nice way
Because I don't think I was ready when you left so suddenly
And if I could just set this date up
It would out my mind at ease to say the things I had failed to say
and my pulse would slow hut hut hut hut hut hut...
Dirty water
Drink it all down  smell the surprise
I just finished putting my fiftieth drink away
I think I've been patient and waiting for this day
I'll have another before I go into the party
I think I've been patient in waiting for this day
After putting my fiftieth drink away
Forget the girl and take the drink like a real man
And I walked and I found solace
And the sun it shined upon me like a mother kept me warm
And I walked and I found solace
And the sun it shined upon me like a mother kept me warm
And my pulse goes hut hut hut hut hut hut...
And the sun it shined upon me like a mother kept me warm... <start> Kimi ni ageru.
Yume wo Hako wo.
Kienai yume wo.
Kienai yume wo. <start> Yeah
Turn around take a look at my life
I'm a lot like you are
Try to hide from yesterday
Still the pain never went away
Could it be history
All the time just repeatin' on me
Thought that I could break the chains
The tears and pain but here I go again
Over and over
On and on
Keep on singing that same old song you know
Is that the way the story goes

Hey

Round and round
This world keeps turning me inside out you know
Is that the way the story goes

C'mon
Turn around take a look at your life
Thinkin' that you're living right
Judgin' only on what you see
Just reflections of your misery
All the shame from all the names
Build the walls when we're all the same
You think you got an alibi but it's a lie
Don't even try
Over and over
On and on
Keep on singing that same old song you know
Is that the way the story goes

Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Round and round
This world keeps turning me inside out you know
Is that the way the story goes

And you don't know baby
How you're gonna survive
In these troubled times
But if you see than you shall find
Yeah
I say
Sing it with me y'all
Yeah
Turn around take a look at my life
I'm a lot like you are
Try to hide from yesterday
Still the pain never went away
Could it be history
All the time just repeatin' on me
Thought that I could break the chains
The tears and pain but here I go again
Over and over
On and on
Keep on singing that same old song you know
Is that the way the story goes

Yeah

Round and round
This world keeps turning me inside out you know
Is that the way the story goes

No no
Over and over
On and on
Keep on singing that same old song you know
Is that the way the story goes

Yeah

Round and round
This world keeps turning me inside out you know
Is that the way the story goes
 <start> Awake in my sleep
And I hear the sound the endless scream
I try to break out
 The flames around they burn me to the ground
It's not the way that I can't control the pain
My soul's too tired to crawl thru' the vagabond life
Freakin' out what it does to please me
Within' me I hope that I'll stay strong
Drainpipe dreams of life
Awake from my sleep
Still i hear the sound
Of an endless scream
I hate to be afraid
This insanity leads me astray
It's not the way that I can't control the pain
My soul's too tired to crawl thru' the vagabond life
Freakin' out what it does to please me
Within' me I hope that I'll stay strong
Drainpipe dreams of life
Drainpipe dreams of life 
Facing out into the unknown
State of mind lays crushed on a floor
Glacial life rephrase what you are
Rephrace replace replace...
It's not the way that I can't control the pain
My soul's too tired to crawl thru' the vagabond life
Freakin' out what it does to please me
Within' me I hope that I'll stay strong
Drainpipe dreams of life <start> I woke up shaking in a room that I shared with  strangers
And it was visiting day
So I walked down the stairs and then into that room
I felt your presence first and then impending doom
I spoke without a sound but you heard every word
I'm more sorry than you know for everything I put you through
Three weeks passed then you came back
You picked me up and drove me home
To the city over that bridge
Then you put your hand on the back of my neck
You said I'm proud of you
And nothing was ever the same again
An overwhelming resonating voice
Secondguessing every single choice
Now I've gotta find a new escape
For this blood that itches and this head that aches
I've got no reaction
Every action is true <start> Last time you're breaking my heart
It's the last time
Last time I'm falling apart
It's the last time
Took a while to even up the score now
Last time baby once more
Last time you're breaking my heart
It's the last time
Last time once again it's the
Last time I'm on my own again
How could I be so blind
How could I be so blind
How could you take me for granted all these years
You kept telling me no it won't happen again
But every time I turn around you stab me in the back
Your perfect smile ain't flashing anymore
You're magic is gone boy
This time I'm breaking your heart
It's my turn now
It's my turn to let you fall apart
I'm gonna make your eyes burn
And what I really have learned from this
Is that I'm never gonna follow my heart again
And that theyre people living in this world
Who'll treat you like a dog like they just don't care
And cause I don't deserve this
I'm gonna watch my steps before I get me some ass
This is this is the last time
How could you take me for granted all these years
You kept telling me no it won't happen again
But every time I turn around you stab me in the back <start> The clown came down to meet me
With a smile upon his face
He fired the starting pistol and
Began the human race
There were faces all around me
They were running everywhere
But everywhere is nowhere
And nowhere isn't there.
Chorus
It's a game a game a game that we're playing
But I don't mind but I don't make the rules
It's a game a game a game that we're playing
Just a game for lovers and fools
Well there's snakes upon your ladder
And there's dice upon your skirt
There's lipstick on my collar
And there's sweat upon my shirt
The neighbors will start talking but
You know that I don't care
For the neighbors they are nowhere
And nowhere isn't there.
Chorus <start> Shakin' 'em down and drunk on a holiday.
Dishin' them 'lectric blues in an old school way.
Lucy and Glenda Jones and an old beef bone.
Drinkin' that whisky juice till they all alone.
They was blues conquistadors soul conquistadors.
Old Betty Mae was movin' it and doin' it right.
Muddy and John Lee rockin' in the house of blue light.
Trouble and worry come back on another day.
Nellie's aunt Bee got down and began to pray.
They was blues conquistadors soul conquistadors.
You got to mess around to feel right.
Then you slow it down sometimes just enough to get me home.
You got me digging in a coal mine diggin' in a blues mine.
Jesus gonna help me get there with them blues conquistadors soul conquistadors.
Been twenty odd years since they burned that Checkerboard lounge.
Listen that Howlin' Wolf make a nasty sound.
Muddy and John Lee you know they passed away.
But the Gin room boogie still make you shake a leg. <start> Oh Madelaine ich bin keiner
der sein Herz so leicht verliert.
Doch ich glaube wir beide passen gut
das hab ich gleich beim Tanzen gesprt.
Und ich habe auch kein Vorurteil
es ist toll dass wir uns trafen.
Ich bin zum ersten Mal in Ldenscheid
und ich will mit dir schlafen.
Ich will dich ich will dich
aber nicht bevor ich weiss
gibt es irgendwelche Nazis
in deinem Bekanntenkreis
Du weisst ja es gibt Menschen
die da empfindlich reagiern.
Ich habe nicht viele Freunde
und die will ich nicht verliern.
Da gibt es leicht dummes Gerede
und sowas muss ja nicht unbedingt sein.
Und es ist ja nur ne Frage
du sagst einfach Ja oder Nein.
Tut mir leid dieses Gequatsche
htte fast die Stimmung versaut.
Wo sind blo die Kondome
Du hast so superweiche Haut.
Und jetzt kannst du's mir ja sagen
nur damit ich's weiss
gibt es irgendwelche Nazis
in deinem Bekanntenkreis
Ich will dich ich will dich
aber nicht bevor ich weiss
gibt es irgendwelche Nazis
in deinem Bekanntenkreis <start> All the pumping's nearly over for my sweet heart.
This is the one for me
Time to meet the chef
Oh boy The running ma s out of death.
Feel cold and old its getting hard to catch my breath.
Its back to ash now you've had your flash boy
The rocks in time compress
Your blood to oil
Your flesh to coal
Enrich the soil
Not everybody's goal.
Anyway they say she comes on a pale horse
But I'm sure I hear a train.
Oh boy I don't even feel no pain
I guess I must be driving myself insane.
Damn it all Does earth plug a hole in heaven
Or heaven plug a hole in earth  how wonderful to be so profound
When everything you are is dying underground.
I feel the pull on the rope let me off at the rainbow.
I could have been exploded in space
Different orbits for my bones
Not me just quietly buried in stones
Keep the deadline open with my maker
See me stretch for God's elastic acre
The door bell rings and it's
Good morning Rael
So sorry you had to wait.
It won't be long yeah
She's very rarely late. <start> Toss and turn all night in the sheets
I can't sleep
Night after night don't know what it means
In my dreams
What can I say or do
You won't come back we're through
I've realized too late
That baby your love has turned away
In my dreams it's still the same
Your love is strong it still remains
In my dreams you're still by me
Just the way it used to be
Calling your name but you're turning away
Please don't leave
Running in circles waiting to see you
In my dreams
What can I say or do
You won't come back we're through
I've realized too late
That baby your love has turned away
In my dreams it's still the same
Your love is strong it still remains
In my dreams you're still by me
Just the way it used to be
In my dreams it's still the same
Your love is strong it still remains
In my dreams you're still by me
Just the way it used to be
In my dreams it's still the same
Your love is strong it still remains
In my dreams you'll always be
In my heart and in my dreams
In my dreams it's still the same
In my dreams you're still by me
In my dreams just the way it used to be
In my dreams what can I say
In my dreams You're still by me
And in my dreams You'll always be
In my dreams You'll always be
In my dreams your love is strong
In my dreams You're still the same
In my dreams <start> Lines form on my face and hands
Lines form from the ups and down
I'm in the middle without any plans
I'm a boy and I'm a man
I'm eighteen and I don't know what I want
Eighteen I just don't know what I want
Eighteen I gotta get away
I've gotta get out of this place
I'll go running into outer space
Oh yeah
I've got a baby's brain and an old man's heart
Took eighteen years to get this far
Don't always know what I'm talking about
Feels like I'm in the middle of doubt
'Cause I'm
Eighteen I get confused everyday
Eighteen I just don't know what to say
Eighteen I gotta get way
Oh lines form on my face and hands
Lines form on the left and right
I'm in the middle the middle of life
I'm a boy and I'm a man
I'm eighteen and I like it
Yes I like it
Well I like it love it like it love it
Eighteen eighteen eighteen
I'm eighteen and I like it <start> Heaven made a killing
Well they're an angel more
And we're an angel less
Fate had made arrangements
Playing a hand again
Now the one I love's a mess
Tell me mother when you cry
Can she hear your sorrow sigh
Sister sleeping in the breeze
You are all she ever sees
Laid to rest in tears
Rained in time for May
But a year's not time enough
If she falls I'll catch her
And though I may be weak
I will hold her up with love
Tell me mother when you cry
Can she hear your sorrow sigh
Sister sleeping in the breeze
You are all she ever sees
Tell me mother when you cry
Can she hear your sorrow sigh
Sister sleeping in the breeze
You are all she ever sees <start> Yes be careful with a fool
'Cause someday he may get smart
Well be careful with a fool
'Cause someday he may get smart
Well he'll treat you so cold and chilly
Till it will hurt you to your heart
Well I hate to remember
What a fool I used to be
Well I hate to remember
How foolish I used to be
Well you know the way I used to love you baby
And how bad you treated me
I used to cry about you baby
Yes and walk the streets late at night
Oh I used to cry about you baby
And walk the streets late at night
Well if you love me a little bit darlin'
Why in the world don't you treat me right
Yes look out <start> First they told me
That they loved me
Dressed me up in the light of gold
All they wanted was to know me
Gotta get me on before I get too old
Then they told me I was big time
Lots of favors of limosine
This might be what they told me it would be
But I'm not sure it's what I need
Not what I need
Now won't you tell me
Oh my lady
Where's my lady
All this glory
Where's my lady
To share it with me
Oh to share it with me
First they told me
I could love you
And then they told me never mind
Never mind
Gotta keep those cards and letters flowing in my friend
Gotta try and have a real good
Real good time <start> ooooooooooh
Look at where we've come
a boy becomes a man
But for the first time in our lives
we come without a plan
Careful when you look
for my heart has leprosy
All I want is to see Jesus
just one touch and I'll be free
Oh I feel I feel it's coming on
When you call my name it feels like heaven
Reach inside of me
deeper than before
Would you tear away this old man
bring peace to this old war
See your piercing eyes
burn me like a fire
If you have me I will run
to finish all that you've begun
Oh I feel I feel it's coming on
When you call my name it feels like heaven
Hold me tonight will you hold me tonight
Will you hold me tonight it feels like Heaven

Can you feel it can you feel it
Feel it comin' on
Can you feel it can you feel it
Feel it comin' on
Yeah believe it do you believe it
Feel it comin' on
Hold me tonight will you hold me tonight
Will you hold me tonight
Feel it comin' on
Hold me hold me hold me tight as you walk into the darkest night
Hold me hold me hold me tight as I walk beneath your shining light
Hold me hold me will you come To be with me when the day is done
Hold me hold me hold me tight as I walk into your burning light
Hold me tonight
Will you hold me tonight
Will you hold me tonight <start> Walk little walk
Small talk big thoughts
Gonna tell them all just what I want
That street two streets I see you and me
Hanging on the empty swings
'Count high low don't worry my eyes are closed
I'm a superman and it's my show
One shoe two gonna kick with my new shoes
I'm going to kick until I need new shoes
Yeah yeah I said don't stop don't stop don't stop
Talking to me stop don't stop don't stop
Giving me things
I run they run everybody run run
And we're all just having fun
Sleigh ride boat ride piggy back ride
I'm going to show them all how I can ride
One two three close your eyes and count to four
I gonna hide behind my bedroom door
Crayon on the walls
Color on the wall
I'll draw until I've broken every law
I said don't stop don't stop don't stop
Talking to me
Stop don't stop don't stop
Giving me things
Stop don't stop don't stop
Laughing about it
Stop don't stop don't stop
Don't stop don't stop don't stop don't stop
Talking with me stop don't stop don't stop
Giving me things stop don't stop don't stop
Laughing about it
Stop don't stop don't stop I said
Stop don't stop don't stop I said
Stop don't stop don't stop
Stop don't stop don't stop
Stop don't stop don't stop me <start> originally by Creedence Clearwater Revival
The Anniversary occasionally plays this song live
Traffic in the city turns my head around
No no no no no
Backed up on the freeway backed up in the church
Everywhere you look there's a frown frown
Com commotion
Git git git gone
Com commotion
Git git git gone
People keep atalkin' they don't say a word
Jaw jaw jaw jaw jaw
Talk up in the White House talk up to your door
So much goin' on I just can't hear
Com commotion
Git git git gone
Com commotion
Git git git gone
Hurryin' to get there so you save some time.
Run run run run run.
Rushin' to the treadmill rushin' to get home
Worry 'bout the time you save save.
Com commotion
Git git git gone
Com commotion
Git git git gone <start> The man who stole the water will swim forevermore
But he'll never reach the land on that golden shore
That faint white light will haunt his heart
Till he's only a memory lost in the dark
Dig a hole in the ground straight down to hell
Till there ain't no more water in the well well well
When you're down on your knees with nothing left to sell
Try diggin a little deeper in the well well well
Well well well
Well well well
Take care of your body like you care for your soul
Don't you dig yourself into a hole
Until you've paid the price you can't know what it's worth
The air and water the fire and earth
Dig a hole in the ground straight down to hell
Till there ain't no more water in the well well well
When you're down on your knees with nothing left to sell
Try diggin a little deeper in the well well well
Well well well
Well well well <start> The evening winds are still
I've lost the way and will
Can't tell you where they went
I just know what they meant
I'm always on my guard
Admitting life is hard
Without you near me
The friend you used to be
So near and dear to me
You slipped so far away
Where did we go astray
I passed the old schoolyard
Admitting life is hard
Without you near me
Ever since the day
The day you went away
I felt that emptiness so wide
I don't know what's wrong or right
I just know I need strength to fight
Strength to fight that world outside
Since we've been out of touch
I haven't felt that much
From day to barren day
My heart stays locked away
I walk the boulevard
Admitting life is hard
Without you near me <start> I turn on the T.V. as switch off my head
It's almost like bad fiction I have already read
Well I think I'll come around and shoot your parents instead.
But then I'd go to gaol and I don't like being cooped up inside.
I may have lost my selfrespect but I've still got my pride.
I would steal a car but I don't know how to drive.
The common law that binds us and that keeps us in place
Is often misconstrued as a godawful waste
And it starts to unwind with a kick in the face.
Legal. That's just not.
I would take a cricket bat to a jewellery store
That's if I had a spine and it was within the law
I would give you the keys to the whole shopping mall.
I would take a cash machine and run down the street
That's if I had some muscles and was quick on my feet
I'm afraid it's a fact that I'm inherently weak
And that's just not legal.
I turn on the T.V. as I switch of my head
I wonder should I go out or just rot here in bed
Or I could burn down a school just to show that I cared
Senseless acts of violence are not really my game
I'm much too scared of getting caught or even worsemaimed
And to swim with no arms well it's just not the same. <start> Every night I hope and pray
A dream lover will come my way
A girl to hold in my arms
And know the magic of her charms
'Cause I want
A girl
To call
My own
I want a dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone
Dream lover where are you
With a love oh so true
And the hand that I can hold
To feel you near as I grow old
'Cause I want
A girl
To call
My own
I want a dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone
Someday I don't know how
I hope she'll hear my plea
Some way I don't know how
She'll bring her love to me
Dream lover until then
I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do
Till all my lover's dreams come true
'Cause I want
A girl
To call
My own
I want a dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone
Dream lover until then
I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do
Till all my lover's dreams come true
'Cause I want
A girl
To call
My own
I want a dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone
Please don't make me dream alone
I beg you don't make me dream alone
No I don't wanna dream <start> The city in defeat
With no one left to beat
There's still a fading desire
To burn a naked light
Just to defy the night
Come on and call me a liar
A crumble tumble down
In fumble bumble town
Our lives a ruin
We reconstruct a bit
And pretty up a bit
We hardly know what we're doing
Chorus 
But me and my baby
Make the best of this world
She's like a diamond
Innocent girl
We watch the sign of the times
Writing on the wall cities may fall
Back through the city fog
I was another cog
For the machinery there
Now the machines have gone
The silence hanging on
I sit I stare
Chorus 
Come on and take your aim
I feel the mildest pain
Protecting something so rare
'Cause there's a gem or two
Inside the human zoo
If only you are aware
Chorus  <start> No creas que no me he dado cuenta
De las cosas que no me dices
De las formas que me has cambiado
De las cosas que me has robado
No creas que no me he dado cuenta
De que miras otros cuerpos
De que juegas con otras sombras
Que te esfumas cuando oscurece
Me estas enseando a ser
Una bestia humana
No creas que no me he dado cuenta
Que tu lengua es una rapia
Que tus huesos me destrozan
Que tu cuerpo me incinera
No creas que no me he dado cuenta
Que contigo me estoy pudriendo
Que contigo me da lepra
Que necesito un exorcismo
Me estas enseando a ser
Una bestia humana <start> Always got one foot out the door

It's making it so hard to say

It's making it so hard to say

Only kissing me when she's not around

You should stay baby
One more night
Here we go again

Making new plans

Changing seasons

Holding new hands

Blue skies follow

Every footstep

I'm still waiting

Hoping I'm not wrong

Second to the second
Oh oh oh
I'm sitting in a parking lot and where is god
I need someone to take the pain away
Always got one foot out the door

It's making it so hard to say

It's making it so hard to say

Only kissing me when she's not around

You should stay baby
One more night
Let your hair fall

Just like water

Come together

Love each other

Work it all out

Soak it all in

Trust your instincts

Joy is waiting

Second to the second
Oh oh oh
I'm sitting in a parking lot and where is god
I need someone to take the pain away
Always got one foot out the door

It's making it so hard to say

It's making it so hard to say

Only kissing me when she's not around

You should stay baby
One more night
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
I swear I saw that sparkle in your eye
The last time you cried the last time you cried
I swear I saw that sparkle in your eye
The last time you cried the last time you cried
Always got one foot out the door

It's making it so hard to say

It's making it so hard to say

Only kissing me when she's not around

You should stay baby
You should stay
You should stay baby
One more night <start> A Bridge That Just Won't Burn
I threw away the pictures of those better days in Dallas
But I can't throw away these pictures in my mind
She's a page of precious memories
I've tried hard to turn
She's standing on a bridge that just won't burn
If only time will heal the hurt
Then this may last forever
I may never know how it feels to forget
Every time I think about her
Those old feelings still return
She's standing on a bridge that just won't burn
I've burned a lot of bridges in my time
But the one I just crossed over
It ain't the burning kind
She's that once in a lifetime <start> Too many believe
In some 'master plan'
'cause it's hard to accept
What's not shapen by hand.
But here under the sun
Where events can't be undone
Once superstition's spent 
You gotta know
We want our brothers back.
The hurt came down
From the clear blue sky.
The sands of time
Went rushing by.
It came as a shock
We'd shut our eyes.
Is this all that's left
Just a slow goodbye
The curators frown
And they wax abstract.
But man if you've found love
What could matter more than that
It's a crime and a shame 
To try to justify this pain.
I guess they'll think what they will 
But before the dawn
They'll want their brothers back. <start> Don't let this call bother you in any way
I just had to hear your voice one more time
I know you found a new life
A new life without me
But I'm alright
I just had you on my mind
I just had you on my mind
Oh you sound so close
I can almost feel your touch
And remember the way you loved me.
I don't know what went wrong
All I know is that you're gone
But I'm alright
I just had you on my mind
I'll hang up now
It's been good talking to you
But I bet you want to go now
You got better things to do
Oh please don't think I'm Blue
I just happen to think of you
But I'm alight
I just had you on my mind
I just had you on my mind <start> from one island to another
wind shifting
currents cover the navigations
these separations
rowing home alone
a beach a blazing fire
lighthouse eyes nighttime desire
she walks alone
skips a stone
from one island to another
so what have I to give her
stars shine
waves whisper
the constellations conversations
one island to another <start> Hoy tu cara me lo dice todo
En silencio me hablas de algn modo
Algo no te deja ser feliz
S la vida no es cuento de hadas
Y vamos de la fe a la nada
Tratando de sobrevivir
No hay difcil camino
Cuando estamos juntos t y yo
Si vas en cada libre
Y te sientes derrotada
Yo me entregar en el alma
Para curar tu dolor
No te dejar rendirte
Yo te sanar las alas
Corazones invencibles
Por la fuerza del amor
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh
Por la fuerza del amor
Hoy te pido no pierdas confianza
Aunque sientas que la luz se apaga
Aqu yo sigo junto a ti
Si nos lleva el destino
Lo mejor est por venir
Si vas en cada libre
Y te sientes derrotada
Yo me entregar en el alma
Para curar tu dolor
No te dejar rendirte
Yo te sanar las alas
Corazones invencibles
Por la fuerza del amor
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh
Por la fuerza del amor
Si vas en cada libre
Y te sientes derrotada
Yo te entrego toda el alma
Para curar tu dolor
No te dejar rendirte
Yo te sanar las alas
Corazones invencibles
Por la fuerza del amor
Hoy te pido ya no tengas miedo
Que yo me quedo junto a ti <start> One step  I make an imprint
Two steps  is commitment
Three steps  I'm not done yet
Draw my other leg up
And the pace is set
Gotta believe in what's real
You gotta go with what you know
You can leave here with a good feeling
'You never know' you told me so
Jesus Christ and Heaven's always been there
Gotta believe in what's real
You gotta go with what you know
One step  I make an imprint
Two steps  is commitment
Three steps  I'm not done yet
Draw my other leg up
And the pace is set
Gotta tell you what I feel
Although your tank is running low
Over the split line for real
Pat the hood you're good to go
Hear you now
You're cut from the cords of the wicked
Gotta believe in what's real
You gotta move on down the road
One step  I make an imprint
Two steps  is commitment
Three steps  I'm not done yet
Draw my other leg up
And the pace is set
One step  I make an imprint
Two steps  is commitment
Three steps  I'm not done yet

And the pace is set <start> You have a winning way so keep it
Your future your future your future...
You are an angel heading for a land of sunshine
And fortune is smiling upon you
Prepare for a series of a comfortable miracles
From fasting to feasting
And life to you is a dashing bold adventure
So sing and rejoice sing and rejoice
And look for the dream that keeps coming back
Your future your future your future...
Pat yourself on the back and give yourself a handshake
'cause everything is not yet lost...
Does life seem worthwhile to you
Does life seem worthwhile to you
HERE'S HOW TO ORDER
Yes hmm hmm now for the next question
Does emotional music have quite an effect on you
Do you feel sometimes like age is against you
Sing and rejoice and sing and rejoice
Yes hmm hmm that's interesting.
But tell me do you often sing or whistle just for fun
Do you feel sometimes like age is against you
I I can help  I can help you  I can help you help yourself
Does life seem worthwhile to you
Does life seem worthwhile to you

pasabas por la esquina solo sin mirar
Los Glingons acorralan al perdedor
disparos y corridas por la televisin
En Uruguay o en el infierno

No hables de Bosnia y Ruanda
si en la esquina de tu casa tiran a matar
La trampa esta tendida desde tiempo atrs
no hay reglas cuando largan y la empiezan a dar
En Uruguay o en el infierno
en cualquier parte igual
El barrio esta desierto
perros humo y silencio
despus que pasa el tiempo
no hay llantos para vos
Banderas del infierno
no salvan a sus muertos
despus que pasa el tiempo
no hay cantos para vos
Unos pocos meses y nada paso

Look at the mess I've got it in
I'm trying to trust in You
To know that you'll see me through
Through my pride
Through my shame
Into Your love
Into Your grace
I'm not looking back
Till I see Your face
And I'm running straight to You
Because
All I really want to do is to fall into
The emptiness that is
The space inbetween us
To break this division
All I really want to do is to fall into
The emptiness that is
The space inbetween us
Erase it and bring us together again
My life's like an open book
Nothing is hidden when you look
You break through my boundaries
Revealing my insecurities
But through my pride
And through my shame
You show me love
You show me grace
I'm not looking back
Till I see your face
And I'm running straight to you
Because
Here I am saying I need you
I know I need you
Here I am I'm coming to meet you
'Cause I want to see you <start> I am scared I'm afraid
Mercy me with Your grace
My heart said in brokenness
I want to see Your face
Don't You hide don't You leave
Don't You turn away from me
Cause if You go I'll be forsaken
Who will be my souls salvation
Lord hear my cry hear my heart
Here I come to where You are
I'll be there for You You'll be there for me
Lord though I'm weak You are strong
So I'll go back where I belong
You'll be there for me I'll be there for You
You'll be there for me
Answer me in my place
You told me to seek Your face
My heart spoke with heaviness
Your face I will seek
Don't give up don't forget
Remember me and I won't quit
What good am I if I'm not taken
And who am I without salvation
Lord hear my cry hear my heart
Here I come to where You are
I'll be there for You You'll be there for me
Lord though I'm weak You are strong
So I'll go back where I belong
You'll be there for me and I'll be there for You
You'll be there for me
Lord hear my cry hear my heart
Here I come to where You are
You'll be there for me I'll be there for You
You'll be there for me <start> What can a poor man do you know when the blues keep bothering him around

You know sometimes I feel I feel like drinkin' me some gasoline
You know sometimes I feel I feel like drinkin' me some gasoline
Strikin' me a match and blow myself up in steam

And bring with you the sun to me
In winter will you come
And bring for everyone to see
Winter comes again
Time to think of when you'll send your love to me
Summer is so cold for you
Dress yourselves in leaves of red and blue
In leaves of blue
In summer will you grow for me
The thoughts that now belong to me
In summer you will find
Someone who needs you more than me
Winter comes again
Time to think of when you'll send your love to me
You're gonna send you love
Summer is so cold for you
Dress yourselves in leaves of red and blue

As baby took to the stairs
With all my loving
Heard your voice in the Dresden
Now it follows me everywhere
Dear woman at the gates of the dawn
It's my birthday may I come in
I'll tell my brother and if I had one
I'd tell my sisters too
You alone may sing my hymns and
Raise the warning
Raise the warning
He's bottled his tears
Raise that warning
The warning
Raise the warning
The beginning is near
Oh I heard your voice in the Dresden
As baby boarded the liner in Paris
Now I heard your voice in Dresden
And now it follows me everywhere
Dear land from the giant
Speakers of all man
Time from the swollen mountain tops
The stolen sun thoughts the solar wind chimes
To ring the morning the morning up
Oh ring the morning the morning up
Oh I heard your voice in Dresden
And now it follows me everywhere
Now let us together sing the sun
To the home in the heavens
From the sea from the sea
Oh yes and to our loving mother
We'll say yes we will see you another day
Oh yes oh yes for I can't hold my life can't hold my life
Can't hold my life in the march on glory glory glory glory Gloria
We march on glory glory glory Hallelujah
Oh I heard your voice in the Dresden
As baby took to the air with all my lovin'
Heard your voice in Dresden
Now it follows me every
Follows me every
Follows me everywhere

Except for this recurring dream
Of losing total feeling

When all the kids are having kids today.
Back seat like toast midcentral coast they grow up so quickly. No more Friday night drinks in the park no matter what they say.
Coz all the kids are having kids all the kids are having kids today.
Terminate or church doorstep sell them on the internet or up for adoption. Or there's no more rock shows drugs or cigarettes stunt their DNA.
When all the kids are having kids all the kids are having kids today
Forgotten dreams and wasted plans 
Memories airbrushed on a panel van. 
Replaced with frowns and wagging tongues 
Washing lines and soccer mums. 
Fast track up no time for cool there must have been a hole in the golden rule. At least you get the week off school.
When all the kids are having kids all the kids are having kids all the kids are having kids today. <start> Here we are in the best years of our lives
With no way of knowing when the wheel'll stop spinning
'Cause we don't know where we're going
And here we are on the best day of our lives
And it's a go let's make it last so cheers you all to that
'Cause this moment's never coming back
I used to know her brother but I never knew I loved her
'Til the day she laid her eyes on me
Now I'm jumping up and down she's the only one around
And she means every little thing to me
I've got your picture in my wallet
And your phone number to call it
And I miss you more whenever I think about you
I've got your mixed tape in my walkman
Been so long since we've been talking
And in a few more days we'll both hook up forever and ever
And here I am on the west coast of America
And I've been trying to think for weeks of all the ways to ask you
And now I've brought you to the place where I've poured my heart out
A million times for a million reasons to offer it to you
I used to know her brother but I never knew I loved her
'Til the day she laid her eyes on me
Now I'm jumping up and down she's the only one around
And she means every little thing to me
I've got your picture in my wallet
And your phone number to call it
And I miss you more whenever I think about you
I've got your mixed tape in my walkman
Been so long since we've been talking
And in a few more days we'll both hook up forever and ever
I used to know her brother but I never knew I loved her
'Til the day she laid her eyes on me
Now I'm jumping up and down she's the only one around
And she means every little thing to me
I've got your picture in my wallet
And your phone number to call it
And I miss you more whenever I think about you
I've got your mixed tape in my walkman
Been so long since we've been talking
And in a few more days we'll both hook up forever and ever <start> Ein flchtiger Blick durch das Fenster
Ob es nach Sonne oder Regen aussieht
Dann zieht man ihnen Mtzen und Mntel an
Bevor es nach drauen geht
Sie steh'n im Garten bei den Blumen
Und glotzen auf den Ententeich
Dreh'n einmal tglich ihre Runde
Und das zu jeder Jahreszeit
Fr eine Stunde im Park in Freiheit sein
Begleitet von einem Engel in wei
Und dann zurck ins Haus wo man auf morgen warten kann
Am Abend gibt es Tabletten
Damit schlft man fest und tief
Bis es morgens gleich wieder ans Fenster geht
Ob es nach Sonne oder Regen aussieht
Fr eine Stunde im Park in Freiheit sein
Begleitet von einem Engel in wei
Und dann zurck ins Haus wo man auf morgen warten kann
Die Zeit vergeht das Wetter ndert sich
Nur die Mtzen und Mntel nicht
In dem Haus in dem man auf morgen warten kann
Nach dem Frhstck geht es gleich wieder in den Park
Was hat sich heute bei den Enten getan
Man kann durch sie hindurch schauen  Jahre lang
Mit sich allein im Selbstgesprch
Wie viel Minuten  Jahre sind
Kopfrechnen im Haus in dem man warten kann
Worte haben kein Gewicht
Niemand da der widerspricht
Das Leben ist s im Haus in dem man warten kann
Immer ja und niemals nein
Alles wird so federleicht
In dem Haus in dem man auf morgen warten kann <start> The lines I have written that you read between
The lines on the pages
The lines on the screen
Of lines spoken  I say what I mean.
It's parallel lines that will never meet.
Ship in the desert
Ships in the night
Ships that pass in the night.
Evangeline stream  Evangeline's dream
It's parallel lines that will never meet. <start> Everlast
What you think it can't happen
Soul Assassins twothousand word
It goes somethin' like this
I'm VisionQuest Fresh Fest era terror
Krush Groovie like a low budget movie
I'm Wild Style like Lee Quiones
Stop ridin' on my cajones
I talk with a speak that's much unique
While you desperately seek for that Susie freak
Yo word to Rob One he used to like the big ladies
My name's Everlast I started back in the eighties like
All up in your nostril actin' hostile thirteenth apostle
Going postal holy ghost mode
While you walkin' on the host strow actin' bicoastal
Bitch try to play the middle snitch wind up in the hospital
Cat on a hot tin roof with no fiddle
Put your money in the middle get broke like coal
Chorus
Two deadly assassins makin' the fall
I'm Real I'm Everlast and I'm takin' 'em all
Just when you thought it was safe to make a tape
Two deadly assassins sealin' your fate
BReal
I spit out the fire you won't know what hit
Watch me lace you up quicker than the joint gets lit
I got years in this shit what do you got a couple
If you gotta hustle what do you want trouble
Lookin' at the two who go way back like chucks 
With a hand on the pump by the big black trucks 
You can't trust a soul in the City of Angels
The strange hoes want a piece look at these lame hoes
I stained those with hot blood and changed clothes
And main fools who want to rock the same clothes
And use the same flows these unoriginals
Niggas all of a sudden if anyone wants to run up
You get chastised and baptised and blood
When the gat lies it don't matter you scatter
You run you ungrateful most hateful leech niggas
Swallow in your misery I'm out of reach niggas
Chorus
Two deadly assassins makin' the fall
I'm Real I'm Everlast and I'm ready to brawl
Just when you thought it was safe to make a tape
Two deadly assassins sealin' your fate
Two deadly assassins makin' the fall
I'm Real I'm Everlast and I'm takin' 'em all
Just when you thought it was safe to make a tape
Two deadly assassins sealin' your fate <start> MINAMI

Shooting Star <start> I just dreamed what it's like for me to be dead
my icy body sunk in a black lake
with the leaves swirling around me
the fall can leave such a bad sting in the water
my dream ended my life because
no stays for the winter
all these dreams never really meant that much to me
always brings a hand of security
my life was spare because it was only a dream
suffice to say the water was not as cold
as the vision is old
God why can't things live when it is freezing
ironic when I'm forced to my cave when
It's my favorite season
I don't wan't to freeze
something's missing <start> 
I saw you on the corner yesterday
I couldn't think of anything to say
But you just walked right by me
So I felt that I was standing in your way
I saw you at a party just last week
I tried to talk but I could hardly speak
But you jsut walked right by me
So I ran to mix myself another drink
Zeppelina you are all that is dear to me
Zeppelina I'm so proud that you're in my family tree
I wish that I was handsome and was wise
But you won't listen to my alibis
I'll have to wait for Halloween
So that way I can see you in disguise
Zeppelina you are all that is dear to me
Zeppelina I'm so proud to have you in my family tree
I used to dream about you in my sleep
That when I woke up you'd be mine to keep
But now that I am married to you
I've been counting pigs instead of sheep <start> Sometimes her love explodes in me
As I watch these pieces fall
Was it something that was said
Sometimes mouths are so full of words
That nothing is ever said to him
They've been sent alone
No one talks to him
Everyone walks by
So I wonder if she's happy
Wonder what it'd be like if we all smiled
Wonder if she's happy
Wonder when I'll be happy
As little girl's tears resist fall
Was it something mother said
Sometimes the words just fall out
As more move goes in him to cloud nine
Sad dog bites his leash
Little girl she sympathize
They both yearn
They both yearn to be free
Sometimes their love explodes me
Wonder if she's happier
Wonder what it'd be like if we all smiled
Wonder if she's happier
Wonder when I'll be happy
And her love explodes me in the morning
As I watch the leaves resist the fall
Wonder if to feel something that you said to me
Cause sometimes my mouth is too full
of words
Repeat x
Happy
So I wonder if she's happy
Wonder what it'd be like if we all smiled
Wonder if she's happy
Wonder when I'll be happy <start> Rain
Coming to cleanse
Will she fall
Stares
Into the wind
And she cries
Her tears mark every time
That I swept the pain aside
Too much to withstand
When the rain is coming
She will face it all
It's all on me all over
And when it's overflowing
Can she break her fall
Until I deal I can't move on
Rain
Coming to vent
All she hides
Unable to move
Though we try
Her feet off of the ground
My will can bring them down
If I'd open my eyes
When the rain is coming
She will face it all
It's all on me all over
And when it's overflowing
Can she break her fall
Until I deal I can't move on
Can the sun break through the clouds
To reveal what we've found
When the rain is coming
She will face it all
It's all on me all over
And when it's overflowing
Can she break her fall
Until I deal I can't move on
And when the rain is coming
When it's overflowing
And when the pain is showing
When the rain is coming
Flowing down <start> Sugardaddy took me to wonderland
Gave me so many presents I could not stand
To see you
I really couldn't stand to see you
Sugardaddy took me far away
On a holiday I didn't have to pay
Just be there
All I had to do was be there
Sugardaddy comes with his pockets full of fun
Sugardaddy's blowing kisses from his gun
What will he do and where will he run
When the real world comes to town
Sugardaddy took all my pain away
Now I have to say
I'd let him get away with murder
I'd let him get away with murder
He drives a car that doesn't have a roof
He dares the big ol' world to tell him the truth
By buying silence
He buys you silence
Silence so you'll never ask him why
Silence so you'll never say he makes you cry
Silence so you'll never look him in the eye
And say you want his time 'cause time is money
Sugardaddy can't help but overfill my cup
Sugardaddy always rides heavy on his luck
What will he do when his baby grows up
And doesn't want the toys that he's provided
Sugardaddy comes with his pockets full of fun
Sugardaddy's blowing kisses from his gun
What will he do and where will he run
When the real world comes to town <start> Goodnight my angel time to close your eyes
And save these questions for another day
I think I know what you've been asking me
I think you know what I've been trying to say
I promised I would never leave you
Then you should always know
Wherever you may go no matter where you are
I never will be far away
Goodnight my angel now it's time to sleep
And still so many things I want to say
Remember all the songs you sang for me
When we went sailing on an emerald bay
And like a boat out on the ocean
I'm rocking you to sleep
The water's dark and deep inside this ancient heart
You'll always be a part of me
Goodnight my angel now it's time to dream
And dream how wonderful your life will be
Someday your child may cry and if you sing this lullaby
Then in your heart there will always be a part of me
Someday we'll all be gone
But lullabies go on and on
They never die
That's how you and I will be <start> Look around and tell me what you see
A place surrounded by the hate
That hides in the shadows
Inside of you inside of me
What can we ever hope to see
If we're not looking
Don't you want to find your own way home again
Just leave your hate behind
When will you learn to just be you
Find your own way
When will you learn to follow through
Make your own way
Looking for something to believe
I find the answer starts with me
Each time I follow
Inside of you inside of me
What can we ever hope to be
If we're not trying
Don't you want to find your own way home again
Just leave your hate behind
When will you learn to just be you
Find your own way
When will you learn to follow through
Make your own way
When will you learn to just be you
Find your own way
When will you learn to follow through
Make your own way
Find another way to get inside me
Find another way to get inside me
Find another way to get inside me
find yourself
Find another way to get inside me
Find another way to get inside me
Find another way to get inside me
Find yourself
Don't you want to find your own way home again
Just leave your hate behind
When will you learn to just be you
Find your own way
When will you learn to follow through
Make your own way
When will you learn to just be you
Find your own way
When will you learn to follow through
Make your own way

When will you learn to just be you

When will you learn to follow through

And showed up at your door
Says I'm here to take good care of you
And your children four.
He stayed with you all day and night
And took you as his wife
He showered you with gifts of gold
And loved you with his life
I've got treasures of gold
And then one day the soldiers came
And said there was a war
He grabbed his gun and turned to kiss
The family he adored
The woman said her last goodbye
While falling to the floor
She took all his photographs
And hung them on the door
I've got treasures of gold <start> I will fight for the glory and future of Christmas time

Your hair full of glass
Throw your clothes in the hallway again
Just a sheet on your back
So you're superconnected now
All the freaks gather 'round
And the crowd in your bedroom waits
For a piece of your personal space
Are there heartstrings connected
To the wings you've got slapped on your back
Better climb in the window
'Cause I'm closing the door
On your third broken window
Hair full of glass
Saw your clothes in the hallway
Just a curtain on your back

Are there heartstrings connected
To the wings you've got slapped on your back
Better climb in a window
'Cause I'm closing the door
Now I'm spinning on a dime
Like you claim to do
Like right now
Like now
Are there heartstrings connected
To the poison coming out of your mouth
Are you superconnected
Are you superconnected now
I'm spinning on a dime
Throw your clothes in the hallway
Now I'm closing the door <start> Riding on the City of New Orleans
Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
Three conductors and twentyfive sacks of mail
All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out at Kankakee
Rolls along past houses farms and fields
Passin' trains that have no names
Freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles
Good morning America how are you
Don't you know me I'm your native son
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done
Dealin' cards with the old men in the club car
Penny a point ain't no one keepin' score
Won't you pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor
And the sons of Pullman porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpets made of steam
Mothers with their babes asleep
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they dream
Good morning America how are you
Don't you know me I'm your native son
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done
Nighttime on The City of New Orleans
Changing cars in Memphis Tennessee
Half way home we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness
Rolling down to the sea
And all the towns and people seem
To fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his song again
The passengers will please refrain
This train's got the disappearing railroad blues
Good night America how are you
Don't you know me I'm your native son
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done <start> Face against the ground
Torn but you can stand
Your will is strong but you have now
I know you can save us
Faith is on your side
Fears you can't deny
It's burned a hole right through your soul
But I know you can save us
Save us now
Don't say goodbye
I know you can save us
Don't wave goodbye
But nothing can break us
Don't say goodbye
I know you can save us
You can bring us back again
Born to be as one
Turn to face the sun
Your will is strong but you have now
I know you can save us
Save us now
Don't say goodbye
I know you can save us
Don't wave goodbye
But nothing can break us
Don't say goodbye
I know you can save us
You can bring us back again
You can bring us back again
Face against the ground
Torn but you can stand
Your will is strong but you have now
I know you can save us
Don't say goodbye
I know you can save us
Don't wave goodbye
But nothing can break us
Don't say goodbye
I know you can save us
You can bring us back again
Don't say goodbye
I know you can save us
Don't wave goodbye
But nothing can break us
Don't say goodbye
I know you can save us
You can bring us back again
You can bring us back again <start> Way back when we were young
We're still the same here now under the sun
Basket full of Easter grass
A little boy runs across the path to find
Mercy in the hearts of souls
Who never had no mercy shown to them
Will you please forgive me
I want to be forgiven
A vacant engineer rides on a train
Of thought that will now take him home
And waving from the windows is the innocence
That has no place to go
A boomerang of birds flies high
Over your head and I look to the sky
Will you please forgive me
I want to be forgiven
Given another chance to show you I love
Another chance to show you I feel
Another chance to show you I love
Another chance to show you I feel
Here I am like I always was
Here I am like I'll always be
Here I am like I always was
Here I am like I'll always be
Forgiven <start> it rains and pours in twos
I wonder if I'll come home
no strength left to battle you
run to the open arms
of anyone
of anyone
I'm watching you fall from grace
breaking a heart of gold
don't ever try saving face
run with your heart of stone
it rains and pours in twos
I wonder if I'll come home
no strength left to battle you
run to the open arms
of anyone
of anyone
I'm watching you fall from grace
breaking a heart of gold
don't ever try saving face
run with your heart of stone
don't keep waiting up for me
don't keep hoping I'll come home
I'm watching you fall from grace
breaking a heart of gold
don't ever try saving face
run with your heart of stone
I'm watching you fall from grace
breaking a heart of gold
don't ever try saving face
run with your heart of stone <start> imagine that i am onstage
under a watchtower of punishing light
and in the haze is your face bathed in shadow
and what's beyond you is hidden from sight
and somebody right now is yawning
and watching me like a tv
and i've been frantically piling up sandbags
against the flood waters of fatigue and insecurity
then suddenly i hear my guitar singing
and so i just start singing along
and somewhere in my chest
all the noise just gets crushed by the song
imagine that i'm at your mercy
imagine that you are at mine
pretend i've been standing here
watching you watching me
all this time
now imagine that you are the weather
in the tiny snow globe of this song
and i am the statue of liberty
one inch long
so here i am at my most hungry
and here i am at my most full
here i am waving a red cape
locking eyes with a bull <start> Sing to me and I'll whistle along
Because I haven't learnt the language
And I might get it wrong on your face
Is a profile of you I can see you know
The right things to do
Congregation words and music <start> You always come around this time of year with your big ole bag that's full of Christmas cheer
And when it starts to snow the little boys and girls all know soon they'll hear the sound of your reindeer
Now sometimes grownups grow up to believe that you don't really come on
Christmas Eve
But I don't think that's true 'cause I know I see you in sparking little eyes
around the tree
Oh Santa Claus I still believe in you
And there's still a kid inside of me that still believes you're true
Oh Santa Claus the kids are tucked in tight
And it's time to play ole Santa Clause tonight
Well I don't see how anybody could ever doubt that there's really a Santa
Clause.
Not if they've ever seen a little girl with her arms wrapped around her baby
doll so tight both of 'em waking up Mama and Daddy way before daylight
And Grandma and Grandpa are looking young and full of life just knowin' that
their grandkids are gonna be alright
And Mama and Daddy they'll be waitin' up to answer ole Santa's call.
Cause tonight they ain't worried about the bills Lord they're just lovin' it all <start> I've heard a thousand stories of what they think your like
But I've heard the tender whisper of love in the dead of night You tell me that your pleased and that I'm never alone

You're a good good father It's who you are it's who you are it's who you are
And I'm loved by you It's who I am it's who I am it's who I am
I've seen many searching for answers far and wide
But I know we're all searching for answers only you provide Because you know just what we need before we say a word

You're a good good father It's who you are it's who you are it's who you are
And I'm loved by you It's who I am it's who I am it's who I am
You're a good good father It's who you are it's who you are it's who you are
And I'm loved by you It's who I am it's who I am it's who I am
You are perfect in all of your ways
You are perfect in all of your ways
You are perfect in all of your ways to us
You are perfect in all of your ways
You are perfect in all of your ways
You are perfect in all of your ways to us
Love so undeniable I can hardly speak
Peace so unexplainable I can hardly think
As you call me deeper still As you call me deeper still
As you call me deeper still Into love love love

You're a good good father It's who you are it's who you are it's who you are
And I'm loved by you It's who I am it's who I am it's who I am
You're a good good father It's who you are it's who you are it's who you are

Looking for freedom born to be tamed
Once in a lifetime one of these days
Gonna grab me a lifeline swinging my way
I'm swimming out on a blue blue ocean
You're sailing out on a blue blue sea
Silhouettes and a vulture hoping
He's gonna pick the bones of you and me
You and me
Hearts of fires hearts of bone
Beating stronger beating home
Where there's wanting there is need
Where there's having there is greed
I'm swimming out on a blue blue ocean
You're sailing out on a blue blue sea
Silhouettes and a vulture hoping
He's gonna pick the bones of you and me
You and me
Girl I want the gold dust in your fingers
And your klondike touch
Girl I want the goldmine as it shimmers
In your solemn eyes
I'm swimming out on a blue blue ocean
You're sailing out on a blue blue sea
Silhouettes and a vulture hoping
Licking the bones of you and me
I'm swimming out on a blue blue ocean
You're sailing out on a blue blue sea
Blue blue sea

You're sailing out on the sea

I'm swimming out on the ocean

The years won't end for the cripple hand
What's so great when your years grow late
You can't control your shit as you disintegrate
Force fed through a tube geriatric food
You only take a bath when you're in the mood
There's a tumor over here and clot and a gland
Keep your teeth in a dish next to your bed pan

A lost spirit on a trip to outer space
Bye bye Granny Bye bye
Such a cruel joke you're gonna die
Bye bye Granny Bye bye
Born to rot a way who the hell knows why
What's so fine about father time
He's a grumpy old man with a mind of crime
Here's a pill for your heart and a shot for your head
If it wasn't for your whining I'd swear you were dead
Another cardiac or is it a stroke
You better lay down on that hip you broke
Time to change your diaper well it's just depends
It all turns to shit when it nears the end

Why cant I put it down instead I raise the stakes
Heaven hear my call heres my soul to take
Because Im in over my head and I cant get away.

Im playing roulette but the wheel dont love me at all
Im playing roulette and my heart is a tumbling ball
And the wheel turns me over again Im a helpless soul with a hopeless hand
And my hearts going deeper in debt thats what I get
When Im playing roulette.
What happens in this town dont stay here for too long
I take my winnings home but in the morning hes always gone.
Should I run away I wish I could change
Theres a lion in my heart and I know he cant be tamed

I feel like Im always running Im just as lost as my mind is
Maybe one more spin will save me if I lost you know where to find me

Im playing roulette Im playing roulette Im playing roulette. <start> this will die out.

You left me here with the coldest of feelings
Weight kind depression
Blessing the floors with the places you've stepped in
Will they ever measure up
To the way you left
Here on the roadside
The bloodiest cadaver
Marked in your words
I'm the joke
I'm the bastard
Here wait so I guess that you knew
That you're a selfish little whore

With urgent hands
We excited
A fire so hot
Two lives were ignited
Now I'm left here on my own
But I'll never be alone
Down forbidden streets I talk with
Every single step I walk with
All the lovers in the world 
Though the lonely night's returning
I can feel the flame that's burning
All the lovers in the world
Virgin lips I have tasted
Love so pure not a drop was wasted
Paradise we shared together
Lives inside of me forever
Down forbidden streets I talk with
Every single step I walk with
All the lovers in the world 
Though the lonely night's returning
I can feel the flame that's burning
All the lovers in the world 
Since you touched me
I can't be free
This is every lover's destiny
Down forbidden streets I talk with
Every single step I walk with

But I'm still standing up

 That if you can't be good  Be careful
To achieve your happiness
On this terrestial ball..
Gotta have a clean conscience
But even better None at all
But if you can't be good  Be careful yeah

Let the wind carry
Im so lost help me
I cant see whats in front of me
Have to say you cant save me
Verse  Ive watched you throw your life away
For the past nine months this charade
And I sat back never said a word
Now its killing me inside
Watching everything you worked for flushing down the drain
Down let the pills you take today force a life in vane
Cant you see Im running away
Chorus Let the wind carry
Im so lost help me
I cant see whats in front of me
Have to say you cant save me
Verse  Been down this road once before my friend
It almost led to my death
I remember when you put the gun against your head with a final breath
When this way didnt work I remember those tears you shed
Thanking God for a second chance I vow not to waste again
Cant you see Im running away.
Chorus Let the wind carry
Im so lost help me

I'm not going out like that
I don't want to hear about the summer of love
I'm not going back in time
I don't want to even let love rule
I want to break the back of brotherly love
I don't want to go back in time
I wanna kill jerry garcia
I wanna take the past and throw it away
I want to burn the bridge between then and now
I'm not going back in time
I wanna kill jerry garcia
I don't want to sew the seeds of love
I want to punch marty balin in his eye
I don't wanna go back in time
I wanna kill jerry garcia

Don't want no dead blood on my hands
I wanna shake the flesh and bone
I don't wanna kill the myth
I wanna kill jerry garcia
I wanna kick that skeleton in his teeth
I'd wanna kick pigpen if he were alive
I don't want to go back in time
I want to kill jerry garcia
Kill jerry <start> I think I'm sophisticated 'cause I'm living my life
like a good homosapiens
But all around me everybody's multiplying and
they're walking round like flies man
So I'm no better than the animals sitting
in the cages in the zoo
Cause compared to the flowers and the birds and the trees
I am an apeman.
I think I'm so educated and I'm so civilized
'Cause I'm a strict vegetarian
But with the overpopulation and inflation and starvation
and the crazy politicians
I don't feel safe in this world no more
I don't want to die in a nuclear war.
I want to sail away to a distant shore and make like an apeman.
I'm an apeman I'm an ape apeman oh I'm an apeman
I'm a King Kong man I'm a voodo man oh I'm an apeman
Cause compared to the sun that sits in the sky
Compared to the clouds as they roll by
Compared to the bugs and the spiders and flies I am an apeman.
In man's evolution he's created the city
and the motor traffic rumble.
But give me half a chance and I'd be taking off my clothes
and living in the jungle.
Cause the only time that I feel at ease
Is swinging up and down in the coconut trees.
Oh what a life of luxury to be like an apeman.
I'm an apeman I'm an ape apeman oh I'm an apeman
I'm a King Kong man I'm a voodo man oh I'm an apeman
I look out the window but I can't see the sky
The air pollution is afucking up my eyes
I want to get out of this city alive and make like an apeman.
Oh come on and love me be my apeman girl
And we'll be so happy in my apeman world.
I'm an apeman I'm an ape apeman oh I'm an <start> La la la la la la la la la la

Eighteen times a week love
Ha ha ha ha ha <start> Saturday night burns
A redness on my face
I tasted you
You tasted me
You were never my taste
Now left alone
With precious thoughts of half  assed half an hour stops
And talk so small I can't remember every single word
Laced with think naivete
Firm delusions can't be swayed
Tell yourself you're happy
We both know the truth
It's false behind the dirty talk
The dirty sheets
The sexy walk
Your eyes are closed
Your heart is open wide
And that's no good.
There is something up my sleeve
There is nothing in between
You and me that you can't see
So beg my pardon.
Honesty's a virtue that can hurt you
Let it be
The thought that counts is
Counting down the minutes 'till I leave
And when I do you'll be looking for security in words
Though you know that you won't get it for the better
For the worse.
There is something up my sleeve
There is nothing in between
You and me that you can't see
So beg my pardon
I apologize for me
Then I'm back in a couple weeks
I'm too weak to help it
Don't know how to end it
I apologize for me.
There is something up my sleeve
There is nothing in between
You and me that you can't see
So beg my pardonThere is something up my sleeve
There is nothing in between
You and me that you can't see
So beg my pardon <start> When you move in right up close to me
That's when I get the shakes all over me
Quivers down my back bone
I've got the shakes down the kneebone
Yeah havin' the tremors in the thighbone
Shakin' all over
Just the way you say goodnight to me
Brings that feeling on inside of me
Quivers down my back bone
I've got the quivers down the thighbone
Yeah the tremors in my back bone
Shakin' all over
Quivers down my back bone
Yeah I have the shakes in the kneebone
I've got the tremors in the back bone
Shakin' all over
Well you make me shake and I like it baby
Well you make me shake and I like it baby
Well you make me shake and I like it baby <start> I'll finish the master you started
Just likely a vow brokenhearted
My heart got a nervous kind of feeling
Black white but my heart still beating
I'm living a morning ever after
Keep begging an anything's better
Time's ticking and ticking like a time bomb
You're already gone but I want it more
Operator tell me is gonna end
Hey ho
How the hell you've been
You got me in a coma but I'm alright about it
I'm living the life that you started
Just likely a vow brokenhearted
You think I'm sleeping at the dream
It's all about to get real
So shut up and don't you ride crashing
It's all about anything can happen now
Operator tell me is gonna end
Hey ho
How the hell you've been
You got me in a coma but I'm alright about it
A bow straight to my heart
A bow straight to my heart

I can't recall how it all began
Tell me who am I
Fictional stars in lost Galaxies
Synthetic dreams and false Memories
Is it all a lie
There is no escape
There is no way out of here
I'm locked in this universe
The real world will disappear
Where fantasy dies
You will see our dreams
Material lies
Materialize
Computer eyes
Computerize
Virtual reality  computer Override
Actual fantasy locked away Inside
Am I no more than a Program
An artificial dream
A river of electrons flowing With the stream
A parallel dimension battle Simulations
Mind over matter brain Stimulation
I don't know if I exist I think Therefore I am
Without emotions I'm but a Hologram
There's no escape I'm locked In this universe
Where fantasy dies material Lies
Computer eyes <start> A promise is what you keep
I thought it was with you and me
So Why'd you leave me tangled up inside
All these things I believed
We were always meant to be
I can't see
I'm wasted in your lies
It's gone away
to burn burn down
But im okay
Cause I cant hear those words you say
This is the day
I'm taking back that life you stole away
This is the way I'm leaving you
It's okay You don't have to change
Goodbye Goodbye..
A fantasy is what you need
Another's life to live and breathe
Well how am I supposed to even try
You wear me out  you dig in deep
You hardly make your own deceipt
Consequence will find you at the line
It's gone away
to burn burn down
But im okay
Cause I cant hear those words you say
This is the day
I'm taking back that life you stole away
This is the way I'm leaving you
It's okay You don't have to change
Goodbye Goodbye..
It's gone away
to burn me down
But im okay
Cause I cant hear those words you say
This is the day
I'm taking back that life you stole away
This is the way I'm leaving you
It's okay You don't have to change
Goodbye Goodbye.. <start> I'll travel the whole night through to be near you to be near you.
A part of me is wanting more than I could dream of I could dream of
Now that a part of me believes it's coming true.
And I miss you.
I'm gonna see you again
I'm gonna see you again
I'm gonna surprise myself like I've never seen your face.
I'm still traveling across what feels like yesterday like yesterday
to find out that tomorrow feels like home like home like home
I'm gonna see you again
I'm gonna see you again
I'm gonna surprise myself like I've never seen your face.
And I miss you terribly too <start> I wasnt afraid until the day I saw you that way.
Youre falling apart wondering how many second chances there are.
Grace it doesnt work that way and faith is not a step we take.
Heres our chance we can fall in love again.
It wont have to be that way.
We can run from the lies were living in.
And make all the right mistakes...
Come away...
Your choice is the same but every time you make it you change.
If you give I will take all the little failures away.
Heres our chance we can fall in love again.
It wont have to be that way.
We can run from the lies were living in.
And make all the right mistakes...
Come away...
Youre in the middle of a nightmare but you will never be alone there.
I just want you to know what healing is.
If you want we can start all over again.
Heres our chance we can fall in love again.
It wont have to be that way.
We can run from the lies were living in.
And make all the right mistakes...
Come away... <start> My highs are high
My lows are low
And I don't know which way to go
Every time you leave this house everything falls apart
I can't get myself off the couch
I don't wanna talk to anyone else
Every time you leave this house
Everything falls apart
I lost my job
I miss my mom
I wish my cat could talk
Every time you leave this house everything falls apart
Well I don't love you and I don't hate you
I don't know how I feel
Well I don't love you but I don't hate you
I don't know how I feel
I don't know how I feel
I don't know how I feel
And nothing makes me happy
Not even TV or a bunch of weed
Every time you leave this house everything falls apart
And every time you go away I feel like I could cry
But I would never really cry because you're the worse at goodbyes
You're the worse at goodbyes
You're the worse at goodbyes
Goodbyes at goodbyes
Goodbyes at goodbyes
Goodbyes at goodbyes <start> I'm reaching out without a sound
My pride falls to the floor again
Inside my mind I search to find
A place just to call my own
Deep inside your eyes
I am blinded by your love
Still I run so far just to find that
I'm alone again
In my head
I hear you calling me
And I can't run cause there's nothing left for me
When I fall you always follow me deep inside
Deep inside
Deep inside of my head
I just can't last as these feelings pass
Once again I hide the pain inside
The smile wears thin and the lies begin
To bring me down again
When I run I run so far away from you
I hide the pain and all the lies deep inside again
And all my faith I put in you
This time you take it all away
Inside my head
Deep inside
My head <start> This is the new revolution we're building a brand new society
It's about time we find a solution and not let it slip away
It's time that we all work together
This little thing we call unity has the power to make it all better
And that is why today
We'll all be on the streets
Saving the scene from the forces of evil
Side by side living our dreams
All the positive people
We'll fight our way through the frustration
Overcome negativity
To us it is not a temptation
Because that is not the way
All that is needed to start this is a healthy dose of positivity
We've found our way through all the darkness
And on this brand new day
We'll all be on the streets
Saving the scene from the forces of evil
Side by side living our dreams
All the positive people <start> When a problem needs a problem solver
Guess who gets the call
Me that's all
You're duelling with a plugged revolver
Guess who dropped the ball
The writing's on the wall
The French sent us copper lady
Long since turning green
From New York to Los Angeles
And all points inbetween
Burning  million MegaWatts of
Gasoline
I accept my destiny
I shall start a legacy
The likes of which you've never seen
Make them rip it
Rip it clean
I accept my destiny
I am a ripping machine
So help me
Rip it Rip it
Rip it Rip it
Rip it Rip it
You're listening to your politicians
They claim to speak to God
Can't you see it's just a fraud
You're rituals and superstitions
Don't you find them kind of odd
Might as well kneel before Zod
The French sent us a copper lady
Long since turning green
From New York to Los Angeles
And all points inbetween
Burning  million MegaWatts of
Gasoline
Oooh
I accept my destiny
I shall start a legacy
The likes of which you've never seen
Make them rip it
Rip it clean
I accept my destiny
I am a ripping machine
So help me
Rip it Rip it
Rip it Rip it
Rip it Rip it
Put me in motion
Drink the potion
Use the lotion
Drain the ocean
Cause commotion
Fake devotion
Entertain a notion
Be Nova Scotian
Drink the potion
Put me in motion

you and me <start> I pulled over to the side of the road
I was feeling kind of sad I was feeling kind of blue
And I walked across this farmer's field
And I looked up to the bluewhite sky
And your eyes they were in my mind
And I just want to hold on to you
Yeah your eyes they were in my mind
And I just want to hold on to you
I'm gonna hold on to you I'm gonna hold on
I started singing this song in my head
Just because the sun was high shining bright
And I could smell the fresh cut grass
As I looked up to the blue white sky
And your eyes they were in my mind
And I just want to hold on to you
Yeah your eyes they were in my mind
And I just want to hold on to you
I'm gonna hold on to you
I walked across this farmer's field
And I looked up into the bluewhite sky
I started singing this song in my head
Just because the sun the sun was high
And your eyes they were in my mind
And I just want to hold on to you
Yeah your eyes they were in my mind
And I just want to hold on to you
I'm gonna hold on to you <start> The landlord's here to visit
They're blasting disco down below
Says I'm doubling the rent
'Cause the buildings condemned
You're gonna help me buy City Hall
But we can you know we can
We can you know we can
Let's lynch the landlord man
I tell them turn on the water
I tell them turn on the heat
Tells me All you ever do is complain
Then they search the place when I'm not here
But we can you know we can
Let's lynch the landlord
Let's lynch the landlord
Let's lynch the landlord man
There's rats chewin' up the kitchen
Roaches up to my knees
Turn the oven on it smells like Dachau
Til' the rain pours through the ceiling
But we can you know we can
Let's lynch the landlord man <start> In the dead of the night
On the wings of the wind
I hear the ocean bell
With a flash of the light
In the beat of the dark
The sound I know so well
I shall never forget you
It's been so long
I should never have left you
The call so strong
Chorus
It's a far cry from a wild world
I want to get back to you
Such a long road to the homeland
I must make my way to a far cry
From the chords of the earth
To the depths of the sea
I will return
As I look to the hill
Through the eyes of the storm
I touch the flame
I shall never forget you
It's been so long
I should never have left you
The call so strong
Chorus
It's such a far cry <start> I look down the street but there's no one there
In the cold in the dark in the night air
I call out for life but my heart feels despair
There's no sign of a light in the cold dismal night
The lights have all gone the clothes are all torn
The people are gone but the victory's won
I call out for life but it's after the day
Now the people are gone just the city alone
Eyes look from the second floor
Down to the street below
Calm now the wind is slow
See posters once on the wall
Now washed away in the rain
Peeling from buildings tall
I'll follow you friends to where life never ends
Make our mistakes again as our life lines descend
Time is like dust and the dust is like snow
As it covers the ruins of the life that you know
Trees once green now turned to stone
Objects that look like ghosts
All of them overgrown
Mist all sight and mind is blurred
Lie on your back and cry
Words uttered never heard
I look down the street but there's no one there
In the cold in the dark in the night air
I call out for life but my heart feels despair
There's no sign of a light in the cold dismal night
The lights have all gone the clothes are torn
The people are gone but the victory's won
I call out for life but it's after the day
Now the people are gone just the city alone <start> Thinking of the mess was made
You became a part of me
Thinking of the wish you made
To break free
Playing you like I can
Shoving it in your face
This doesn't break your heart
I'm the one to blame
I never wanted to change your world
I always wanted the simple things
And whatever happens now
It can't be real
Thinking that you might betray
My own private fantasy
I'm the one that gives
What you need
Playing you like I can
Shoving it in your face
If this doesn't tear you apart
I'm the one to blame
I never wanted to change your world
I always wanted the simple things
And whatever happens now
It can't be real
I never wanted to change your world
I always wanted the simple things
And whatever happens now
It can't be real
Now you're gone
I feel betrayed
You can't blame me
You walked away
Now you're gone
You can't blame me
You walked away
I never wanted to change your world
I always wanted the simple things
And whatever happens now
It can't be real
I never wanted to change your world
I always wanted the simple things
And whatever happens now
It can't be real
I never wanted to change your world
I always wanted the simple things
And whatever happens now
It can't be real
I never wanted to change your world
I always wanted the simple things <start> Fat Mike Gave Me Strep

I Think So <start> Why must you say goodbye
Why don't you stay a while
All of the time will fly
You only make me smile
Come on now
Stay a while
Please don't you go away too far
You make me smile
Give me just one more day
Baby stay
Baby stay
Always been racing through
Every day pushing in
Listen now me and you
Wont you say you feel it too
Come on now
You're wondering
when it might settle in
Give us time
Day and night hoping and wondering
Why must you say goodbye
Why don't you stay a while
All of the time will fly
You only make me smile
Come on now
Stay a while
Please don't you go away too far
You make me smile
Give me just one more day
Baby stay
Used to be  years old
Little girl stumbling through the world
And every day was ours to give away
But it's a crying game
Rigged and a real shame
The way the time goes by
How could it find us here
Why must you say goodbye
Why don't you stay a while
All of the time will fly
You only make me smile
Come on now
Stay a while
Please don't you go away too far
You make me smile
Give me just one more day
Baby stay <start> Mary won't be comin' 'round no more
I won't touch her violet hair
That fell like rain and filled the air
With roses
Mary won't be comin' 'round no more
She won't look into my eyes
And tell me I'm the only one
Who knows her
Mary won't be changing me no more
She won't reach into my mind
And fill those gutters with red wine
And reason
Mary won't be changing me no more
I guess that I knew all along
That she'd be leaving with the song
Of season
Sunshine rain
Mary won't be comin' 'round no more
She won't reach into my mind
And fill those gutters with red wine
And reason
Mary won't be comin' 'round no more
She won't look into my eyes
And tell me I'm the only one
Who knows her
Sunshine rain
Sunshine rain
Sunshine rain <start> Now when I need you
You're nowhere around
Just when I'm going then
You're taking a trip down town
How do you fly so far
With the world in disguise
Do the people around you
Put you to where they need you
Where do you go
When the wind doesn't blow
Are you still like the trees
Only bend with a breeze
I long to smell you
To feel you within
I need you near to me
Just the touch of your skin
I want to hear you
And tell you again
But so much can happen
Makes it harder to explain
Where do you go
When the wind doesn't blow
Are you still like the trees
Only bend with a breeze
You think I need no one
You're always around
Turning on a sixpence
Locked in the crowd
Now when I need you
You're nowhere around
Just when I'm going down
You're takin' a trip down town
Where do you go
When the wind doesn't blow
Are you still like the trees
Only bend with a breeze <start> Mom I'm dying
Mom I'm dying again
And I didn't notice I didn't notice
I didn't notice I didn't notice
Mom I love her
Mom I love her again
And I didn't notice I didn't notice
I didn't notice I didn't notice
Mom I'm helpless
Mom I'm helpless again
And I didn't notice I didn't notice
I didn't notice I didn't notice <start> I don't know where we're going but I'll follow you until I get there
you know I will. 'Cause I have no way of knowing which direction it
is going but it shows.
And it's a good thing I brought my eyes to see it happen. And it's a
good thing
I brought my eyes to see the world turn.
It only happens once in this fool's life.
And I can be it
if I can see it
in the clouds.
And I can't be it
if I can't see it
in the crowd.
I can feel the earth below me start to tremble before me my heart's
beatind I must be dreaming. 'Cause I have no way of knowing which direction it
is going but it shows.
And it's a good thing I brought my eyes to see it happen. And it's a
good thing
I brought my eyes to see the world turn.
It only happens once in this fool's life.
And I can be it
if I can see it
in the clouds.
And I can't be it
if I can't see it
in the crowd. <start> I've been tryin' to tell you baby
Just how good life could be
If I just had you by my side for eternity
But you're always goin' somewhere
You've got something on your mind
I know I know I can make the time
But it's gotta be right it's gotta be at night
When we're all alone and I'm holding you tight
And I'm lookin' in your eyes with the stars out up above
I know I've tried but there's no
No words for love not my lovin'
No words for love no not my love
When I'm lookin' in your eyes
With the stars out up above
I swear I tried but there's no
Now there you are baby in your Disney little world
When I look at you I see a tired little girl
Tired of waitin' tired of waitin' for a chance
A chance to let go and find some real romance
But it's gotta be right it's gotta be at night
When we're all alone and I'm holding you tight
I look into your eyes with the stars out up above
I swear I've tried but there's no
No words for love
Not my love baby not my love baby
No words for love
All my love baby all my love baby
No words for love
Not my love baby not my love baby
Not my love babe
No no no no no not my love
No words for love
For my love for my love for my love
No words for love
For my love baby no no no no no no
No no no baby no no no baby <start> Try the morning rain it tastes the same
Pulled one over but I stole her fair and square
You must admit
Pierced the morning rain
She can't go if I don't know I'm goin' in
Had a look around  the town
And I refused to quit
Causing quite a stir all over her
Our bed you must admit
Pierce the morning rain
Others wouldn't stay
I stuck to you my friend
I won't abide
I'll bet on sky to get me through this life <start> Summer nights and long warm days
Are stolen as the old moon falls
My mirror shows another face
Another place to hide it all
Another place to hide it all
And I'm lost behind
The words I'll never find
And I'm left behind
As seasons roll on by
Sleeping with a full moon blanket
Sand and feathers for my head
Dreams have never been the answer
And dreams have never made my bed
Dreams have never made my bed
And I'm lost behind
The words I'll never find
And I'm left behind
As seasons roll on by
Now I want to fly above the storm
But you can't grow feathers in the rain
And the naked floor is cold as hell
This naked floor reminds me
Oh the naked floor reminds me
And I'm lost behind
Words I'll never find
And I'm left behind
As seasons roll on by
If I should be short on words
And long on things to say
Could you crawl into my world
And take me worlds away
Should I be beside myself
And not even stay
And I'm lost behind
Words I'll never find
And I'm left behind
As seasons roll on by <start> I've been trapped
I'm all for giving
But you've got me wrapped
I got my reasons
But I won't explain
I'll get my highs a better way
I watch you sinking
As you're filling up
Like your door's just been ripped off
In a storm you'd never start
'Cause you always say the same thing
You say yeah
All you brothers and sisters come on
You're not down because you're looking up
And they ask you to jump and you jump
'Cause you know that your time's gonna come
All you brothers and sisters come on
You're not down because you're looking up
And they ask you to jump and you jump
'Cause you know that your time's gonna come
Brother sister
Brother sister
I feel lapped
You've only made it
If you make it back
I got my feelings
But I won't explain
I'll get my highs a better way
I watch you sinking
As you're filling up
Like your door's just been ripped off
In a storm you'd never start
'Cause you always say the same thing
You say yeah <start> you speak of love girl
know how to touch girl
you want to trust girl
then wanna...girl
like nothing I have felt
lipstick and nothing else
you speak to jesus girl
dance under bed sheets girl
cuz
it's all part of you
all I want is every part of you
I wanna see everything that you are
I wanna know everything that you know
I wanna be everything that you want
I want to take you where you wanna go
we go to the edge of the world
you look like they want to
speak how they wish they do
then the air leaves the room
at any thought of you
it's all part of you
all I want is every part of you
you speak of love girl
know how to touch girl
you want to trust girl
then wanna...
it's all part of you
all I want is every part of you
I wanna see everything that you are
I wanna know everything that you know
I wanna be everything that you want
I want to take you where you wanna go
we go to the edge of the world <start> Here's a taste of the even sins
Driven to distraction waiting on you call.
I am getting trigger happy
But it doesn't help at all.
No and I can't even think
With you still in my head.
No and I cannot do anything
I want you in my head.
Envy envy envy.
Breathless weak I'm distracted
I want to get under your skin.
A fever you leave my mouth dry
But I can't do anything.
Can't stop this burning from within.
C'mon baby c'mon baby c'mon baby c'mon.
Fingertips in the honey dipped
You know it set my soul on fire.
From her sultry hips to her velvet lips.
You know I couldn't get much higher.
I lose my concentration walk around in a dream.
So come on give me some of your reaction
I want to know explicitly.
How it feels so dirty sweet.
Envy envy envy.
Envy envy envy.
C'mon baby c'mon baby c'mon baby c'mon.
Too much too much
Got struck by a lightening bolt
Between the eyes got paralysed.
Way before I realised hypnotised.
Conspiracy mystery the air she breathes
Controversy I'm heading for the deep freeze.
Envy envy envy.
Envy envy envy.
From the east to the west
The north to the south
I want you so bad
Want to turn turn you inside out
I want to all night long
Feel the sweet sensations
Sassy temptations
Of her hot vibrations. <start> Whiskey and wimmen almost wrecked my life
Whiskey and wimmen almost wrecked my life
Were'nt for whiskey and wimmin I'd have money today
Nightlife nightlife nightlife
Ain't no good ain't no good for me
I had a good start but wimmen and whiskey tore it down
Whiskey and wimmen ain't no good for me
Whiskey and wimmen ain't no good ain't no good for me
I had a lot of money and big fine car but I lost everything I had
Aww I did <start> 

Backstage in Detroit
And the room is full of smoke and apprehension
We'd been playing shows
As the warmup and the band for Beck Hanson
In walks Jack says How'd ya do 
Then he handed me this wonderful statue
And I said Thank you Jack White
For the fiberoptic Jesus that you gave me.
It shined so bright
That I couldn't help believin' it would save me
When I finally got it home
My whole neighborhood was aglow
And I said Thank you Jack White
For the fiberoptic Jesus that you gave me.


Jack and Meg are funny
They got a modern backwards liberal family code
Brother and sister
Playing rock 'n' roll and doing it on the road
I bet that van begin to stink
But then I wonder oh what Christ would think
I said Thank you Jack White
For the fiberoptic Jesus that you gave me.
It shined so bright
That I couldn't help believin' it would save me
And when I finally got it home
My whole neighborhood was aglow
And I said Thank you Jack White
For the fiberoptic Jesus that you gave me.
 <start> Day is dawning
Almost sounded like a warning
Wind was rushing through the trees almost falling
I never thought that I'd become
The proud father of my three sons
Years of fragment
Between the shame and the sentiment
For all the years that I might have been absent
I can't do what can't be undone
Oh no my three songs
I love you more than I can say
What I give to one the other cannot take away
I bless the day you came to be
With everything that is left to me
Here's your pillow
Go to sleep and I will follow
May you never have anymore sorrows
That's not something that you can count upon
Still I want it for my three sons
My my my three sons
Deep in the night I turn cold and sick
But I only curse arithmetic
I bless the day that you came to be
With everything that is left to me <start> Nowhere here
To call my home
No one near
To call my own
All that's left
Is for me to roam
Somebody please
Help me hang on
Homeless child
Homeless child
What is left
For the homeless child
There is no night
And there is no day
It is all
One shade of gray
Some will pass
And some will stay
Is this the end
Or just one more day
Homeless child
Homeless child
What is left
For the homeless child
Sure not much
But it's my best
I just need
Some place to rest
If you could just
Let me be your guest
I won't burden you
For very long
Homeless child
Homeless child
What is left
For the homeless child <start> you took em by surprise you roll those crazy eyes
like the letter the things inside your head
i can't make up my mind you know that that's a lie
i really have no decision to be amde
you took me by surprise
you took me by surprise
and then you amde me laugh and now i have a question
did you have to do that
i feel so dumb inside i'm tryign to decide
but you'd never await my arrival
you took me by surprise
you took me by surprise
i lke to put myself pretend i'm soneoen else
someoen who could write better words than this
you took me by surprise
you took me by surprise
you took me by surprise you roll those crazy eyes
like the letter the things inside your head
i can't make up my mind you know that that's a lie
i really have no decision to be made
walking in the park
when everything went dark
i thougth i saw your picture i the shadows
but i wasnt that at all in fact
it was my car
it was someone laughing making me feel small
maybe i shuld explain the best that i can
but that would get me in trouble
maybe more than i could handle i feel bad right now
i know that i'm not lucky so i'll keep my mouth shut and i'll just save it for anyone
and what's that you might ask and i will say i really don't know
i was just being dramatic like a television show
some day i will slip and i'll say the wrong thing
and the credits will roll and reality will kick in
and i say some day i will slip and i'll say the wrong thing
and the credits will roll and reality will kick in <start> i hear i see the people fall down at your feet
to look to you to feel to feed
i watch i fear how empty we've become
to feast on what a dog would leave

famous envy
envy the famous
integrity left you can you blame it
two faced friendly
what would you sell to be famous
here's your trophy come and claim it
i sense i taste the falseness that you put on for me
how deeply buried is the reality
what will you be if you become as they are
you'll be a nothing 'cause a man can not be a star

can i be more famouser
please make me more famouser
can i be more famouser
even more famouser
make me even more famouser than you with the hardest core of all
to the very top where i can start my fall
back down to the ground where it all began
the pain of it all being real again

approval of man an empty trap
the corperate perspective it makes me laugh
latest sensation fool of the week
respect undeserved with a real heavy beat
 <start> All I know is I want it gone.
It's wasting my time with all it wants.
And if it's a game well then I'm done.
You know you don't win when you play for fun
But I'm all in this one.
Timing was good to me
The lowly old man who was always lost and sold everything.
And if it's a game then I play it well
Running away with a pot of gold from somebody's guilt
Somebody's guilt.
It's time for me to move away
To pack it up and run with grace.
Along the way I treat myself
With some new lungs to clear my chest.
Timing was good to me
The lowly old man who was always lost and sold everything.
And if its a game well then I played it well
Low and behold will I never know when to quit.
I'm going in .
I'm throwing down
I'm coming out 
To start from scratch . <start> 
I bought no gift this year
and I slept with your sister
I know I should have thought twice
Before I kissed her
But with the year we had last
And the dress that she wore
I just went along for the ride
And I came back for more
And I'm sorry baby.....

That's all ok honey cause see...
I bought no tree this year
And I slept with your brother
I wrecked your Daddy's car
And went down on your Mother.
I set your record collection on fire
And said I never knew
Felt kind of bad about that
And I know you did too
pre chorus  
So whatever you say it's all fine by me
Who the fuck anyway wants a Christmas tree
Cause the snow keeps on fallin even though we were bad
It'll cover the filth we should both just be glad
Chorus  
And spend spend spend this chris Christmas together
verse 

I married you last year
Bet you thought I was sober right
But I was drunk as a skunk and I made a mistake
This could all have been over

Ah honey please don't
Excuse your behavior
Cause I hired a hit man and changed your will
It's now all in my favor
pre chorus  
So whatever you say it's all fine by me
Who the fuck anyway wants a Christmas tree
Cause the snow keeps on fallin even though we were bad
It'll cover the filth we should both just be glad
Chorus  
And spend spend spend this chris Christmas together


Holding on without any reason
Cause something's strong this holiday season
pre chorus  
So whatever you say it's all fine by me
And who the fuck anyway wants a Christmas tree
Cause the snow keeps on fallin even though we were bad
It'll cover the filth we should both just be glad
Chorus  
And spend spend spend this chris Christmas together
 <start> Sometimes I say things that I don mean
Sometimes the words come out wrong
Sometimes I take things too far
I haven't said I sorry in so long
How does one reconcile what they regret
After all is said and done the parties done the dust sets
In time I know things work out
I'm sorry so sorry I know I let you down
I let you down...
Chorus
And I never wanna make that mistake again...
True friendship is a bond you never wanna break
But I can t take it back I can only...
Make it up to you
Oh how many times have I sat here and sworn
I'll stop tearing you down while our friendship I've scorn
With my harsh words of judgment condescending ways
I'm sorry so sorry how could I make this mistake
So humble so caring yet so demeaning and crass
Friendship with out trust is just a ship sinking fast
Ie learned in my life what goes around comes around
I'm sorry I've realized I just never want to let you down
Like Ie let you down

If I had a button I could push 
To take it all away I would 
And I swear I wouldn make that same mistake... <start> Mad sounds in your ears they make you feel alright
They bring you back to life
Mad sounds in your ears they make you get up and dance
They make you get up
Yeah they make you get up
Love buckles under the strain of those wild nights
Run but you cannot hide
Mad sounds in your ears they make you get up and dance
They make you get up
All night long they reappear
They make you get up and dance
Yeah they make you get up
Suppose you've gotta do what you gotta do
We just weren't feeling how we wanted to
You sit and try sometimes but you just can't figure out what went wrong
Then out of nowhere somebody comes and hits you with an
Ooh la la la ooh la la la
Ooh la la la ooh
Ooh la la la ooh la la la
Ooh la la la ooh
You got those mad sounds in your ears to make you get up and dance
Mad sounds in your ears they make you get up and dance
They make you get up <start> You've taken this too far
Now it has to stop
You've taken this too far
Once again the table's turned
And I'm behind
Picking up the pieces from the night
My face is scarred sometimes I feel
That I can't trust myself at all
And every time the sky

Breaks open with sunshine
As streaming swords collide

It takes me back in time
I float away to another place
Where heaven is waiting right outside
This is war
Can I take it anymore

I'm falling faster and bleeding more
Than I have bled before
Certain death

Lingers on the other hand

But I will fight you
And victory will be mine in the end
Circumstances mean nothing
When it's over we will be
Heroes constantly
Pushing forward without any fear
If I erased the line between
Forgotten days and memories
I'd never change
Resolutions made in vain
To face play out the day
Life is yours to save save it
Or take take it away <start> You go to my head and you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning 'round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne
You go to my head like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two
The thrill of the thought that you might give a thought to my plea
Casts a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be
You go to my head with a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand julys
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes
Though i'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance <start> Swept away by the wonder of it all
So many never saw it coming
Left me dead
And I don't know where to turn
Here and now seems I'm standing on the edge
Looking down
I can clearly see your face in the crowd
Makes me feel I'm not alone
If I fall
If I fall
If I fall will you catch me
Seems to me I'm exactly where I dreamt I would be
And if you for here is something to see
But I need a hand to hold onto
If I fall
If I fall
If I fall will you catch me
If I fall
If I fall
If I fall will you catch me
If I fall 
If I fall 
If I fall will you catch me
If I fall 

If I fall
If I fall
If I fall will you catch me <start> do not be alarmed by the inordinate
amount of human excreta <start> Verse 
Get it before
It goes to waste
Lick on my knife
And honour the taste
Taking my time
Running in place
Leaving the house
Was a mistake
PreChorus
I don't know if I dare
I don't know if I care
You are all I want
I am all I know
Chorus
Broken bones
Broken bones
Broken bones
Set at home
Broken bones
Broken bones
Broken bones
Set at home
Verse 
If I see only what I believe
Reality's bound
By what I conceieve
Pickin' the scab
And watching it bleed
Behind the wall
Where I can't be seen
PreChorus
I don't know if I dare
I don't know if I care
You are all I want
I am all I know
Chorus
Broken bones
Broken bones
Broken bones
Set at home
Broken bones
Broken bones
Broken bones

   ... <start> Looking back in anger
On this dirty little town
It stained your dress carved up my face
Put a wedge between our state of grace
Somethings so young and pretty
Should never be released
We place our bets we take our pick
They wind up in the belly of the beast
And when you can't get what you want
You take anything you can
So I wear this suit of wolves at night
I slip it on how come it feels so right
I get a hungry man
When I can't get what I want
I take anything I can
I wear a suit of wolves
Just across from Friday
The weekend circus rolls
I cross my heart turn on the charm
I say my prayers between two hungry arms
There's a string of dangerous flowers
All around my bed
There's some want rings and some just want
And those who'd like to see me dead <start> They say don't go on Wolverton Mountain
If you're looking for a wife
Cause Clifton Clovers has a pretty young daughter
He's mighty handy with a gun and a knife
But her tender lips are sweeter than honey
And Wolverton Mountain protects her there
The bears and the birds tell Clifton Clovers
If a stranger should wander there
All of my dreams are on Wolverton Mountain
I want his daughter for my wife
I'll take my chances and I'll climb that mountain
Though Clifton Clovers may take my life
Her tender lips are sweeter than honey...
I'm a goin' up on Wolverton Mountain
It's too lonesome down here below
It's just not right to hide that daughter
From the one who loves her so
Cause her tender lips are sweeter than honey...
But I don't care about Clifron Clovers
I'm a gonna climb up on his mountain
I'm gonna take the girl I love I don't care about Clifron Clovers <start> I want you to know
How extraordinary you are and
How much I want you to have
Because of that <start> She works at hot topic
His heart microscopic
She thinks that its love but to him its sex
He listens to emo but fat mike's his hero
His bank account's zero
What comes next
Same song different chorus
It's stupid contagious
To be broke and famous
Can someone please save us from punk rock 
My Dickies your sweatbands
My spiked hair your new vans
Let's throw up our rock hands for punk rock 
She bought him a skateboard a rail slide his knee tore
He traded it for drums at the local pawn shop
She left him for staring at girls and not caring
When she cried because she thought Bon Jovi broke up
Same song second chorus
It's stupid contagious
To be broke and famous
Can someone please save us from punk rock 
My Dickies your sweatbands
My spiked hair your new vans
Let's throw up our rock hands for punk rock 
Don't forget to dely...on the very last word
Seven years later he works as a waiter
She married a trucker and he's never there
The story never changes just the names and faces
Like Tommy and Gina they're living on a prayer
Did you just say that
I just said
It's stupid contagious 
To be broke and famous 
Can someone please save us from punk rock 
My Dickies your sweatbands
My spiked hair your new Vans
Let's shoplift some sweatbands for punk rock  <start> Lost inside I will stand alone
What I really need is what I really want
Talking to my deep side
Talking to my heart
Everything's so easy
Melancholy day
Melancholy day
I'm calling your rain
Rain for my heart
I'm calling your rain
Like the desert does
Take me away
Running through time
I'm calling your rain
I'm calling your rain
I've been right maybe I've been wrong
Hiding all the mistakes hiding what is gone
Talking to the black clouds
Talking to the sky
Everything's so easy
Melancholy day
Melancholy day
I'm calling your rain
Rain for my heart
I'm calling your rain
Like the desert does
Take me away
Running through time
I'm calling your rain
I'm calling your rain
Rain
I wait for every drop
I'm calling your rain
I'm waiting for the storm
I'm calling your rain
Your I wait until it comes
I'm calling your rain
I'm waiting I'm waiting
Melancholy rain
Melancholy rain
Melancholy rain
Melancholy rain
Rain
I'm calling your rain
Rain for my heart
I'm calling your rain
Like the desert does
Take me away
Running through time
I'm calling your rain
I'm calling your rain
rain
Rain for my heart
I'm calling your rain
Like the desert does <start> I need a car when I'm driving
A plane when I'm flying
A call takes a quarter and dime
I need a radio playing
When there's nothing worth saying
And some help when I'm falling behind
Extra rest on occasion
Holiday or vacation
But I need you all the time
Every beat of my heart
Every thought in my head
Points straight to you
Underlined in red
Every move I make
Every minute of mine
I need you all the time
I need boots when I'm walking
A southern drawl when I'm talking
And I run when I wanna unwind
Some cash when I'm going
Some freedom for growing
And some preaching to keep me in line
They could build it or dream it
I could take it or leave it
But I need you all the time <start> I found you falling into old routines
As you layed the final straw across my back.
Familiar with the ending
The sickening returns
And I've come to find out the equation stays the same.
Every time I think it's different
You turn and face me with the truth.
With your eyes so blank and distant
But that's nothing new and looks more like the habit is breaking you.
I should know better than to trust myself.
When guilt and failure bring me back.
I take the beatings for you.
You never felt the fall.
It's been hard to tell who been sicker all along.
And it is hard to stay indifferent
As you fall apart in front of me.
Then I choke on the resentment
But that's nothing new and it looks more like the habit is breaking me.
We all break down and we break the promises we make. <start> In the solitary moment of His birth
On this barren dusty land
All of heaven kissed the face of the earth
With a miracle of love
God became a man
But He was sent away to draw His final breath
When He was only thirtythree
And in the shame of dying a criminal's death
He cleansed an angry world
And in His suffering I see
The glory of the blood
The beauty of the body
That was broken for our forgiveness
The glory of His perfect love
Is the heart of the story
The glory of the blood
Now I have tried to find salvation on my own
In a search for something real
But there's a guilty heart inside this flesh and bone
Fall upon His grace
And I begin to feel
And when I close my eyes I can see Him hanging there
Oh the precious wounded Lamb of God
All the majesty in this world cannot compare to the glory
The beauty of the body
That was broken for our forgiveness
But He was sent away to draw His final breath
When He was only thirtythree <start> I am Emperor Ronald Regan
Born again with fascist cravings
Still you make me president
Human rights will soon go 'way
I am now your Shah today
Now I command all of you
Now your gonna pray in school
I'll make sure they're christian too
Chorus
California Uber Alles
Uber Alles California
Ku Klux Klan will control you
Still you think it's natural
Nigger knockin for the master race
Still you wear a happy face
Chorus
Welcome to 
Are you ready for the Third World War
You too will meet the secret police
They'll draft you and they'll jail your niece
You'll go quietly to boot camp
They'll shoot you dead make you a man
Don't worry it's for a cause
Feeding global corporations' claws
Die on a brand new poison gas
El Salvador or Afghanistan
Making money for President Regan
And all the friends of President Regan
Chorus <start> You look so good
You look like jello
Oh me and you could get down
If it were yellow
Yellow jello
Me and you
We would make quite a pair
People would stare
And they'd dare to ask
'What's up with that'
I said 'Jello'
Let's get some yellow jello 'n mellow
We could beat that fellow
Jello
You and me
We we'd be so slippery
If we were covered in jello
Yellow jello
You and me
We look like quite a scene
When we walked about on the street
Covered in jello
Yellow jello
We could be red fellows
Covered in yellow jello
Just you and me
We wouldn't mellow
Watch the television
Yes officer some kind of show
Any kind of show you know
That makes us jello
That makes us yellow
Mellow some jello
You like jello pudding pops
Well I do too
That's pretty sweet <start> Well Ive been around for a pretty good while
Ive been on the move since I was just a little baby child
Been with I've been without never been no doubt
When that good time feelin' comes around
Well Ive got my temper just like you
A little fussin' and fightin' well that ain't nothing new
But for a little while tonight everything gonna be all right
When that good time feelin' come around yeah
Well I cant get enough of that wonderful stuff
Never felt so fine hey now drivin' me out of my mind
Somebody said it can't be done
We're gonna mess around and have a little fun
When that good time feelin' comes around yeah
Incomprehensible
Well I cant get enough of that wonderful stuff
Never felt so fine hey now drivin' me out of my mind
Somebody said it can't be done
We're gonna mess around and have a little fun
When that good time feelin' come around
When that good time feelin' come around
When that good time feelin' come around oh yeah <start> Don't tell her that you want her
Don't ask her to be yours
Don't tell her she is everything
Or she might see the fool behind the frown
And then the heart behind the fool
Don't tell her that you need her
Don't tell her that you care
Don't ask her to hold you
Or she might see the fool behind the frown
And then the heart behind the fool
Behind the cool there's a dreading that
Someday she'll betray you
Someday she will dispose of
All her photographs of you
So don't tell her when you're lonely
Don't tell her when you're blue
Don't tell her she means everything to you
So don't tell her that you need her
Don't tell her that you care
Don't ask her to hold you
Or she might see the fool behind the frown
And then the heart behind the fool <start> My eyes with your vision
My choice but always your decision
My play with your direction
Well it's my lead but always your connection
But when I look into your eyes you don't believe me
B
I can see it in your eyes you don't believe
My words your expression
My land always your possession
My song your production
Moby expense is always your deduction
But when I look into your eyes you don't believe me
I can see it in your eyes you don't believe
And the face I see before me
Is both sides of a mirror
You really know you've got a hold on me
And the face you're looking into
Is both sides of a window
And any way you look you see through me
My fame your reflection
My weakness always your protection
Well it's my terms on your conditions
And they're my tunes but they're your compositions
But when I look into your eyes you don't believe me
I can see it in your eyes you don't believe <start> Hear my voice and listen well and a story I will tell
How duty brought a broken heart and why a love so strong
Must fall apart
She was lovely she was fine daughter of a royal line
He no equal but for them it mattered little for they were in love
Rose of England sweet and fair shining with the sun
Rose of England have a care for where the thorn is
There the blood will run
Oh my heart oh my heart
Through the summer days and nights stolen kisses and delights
Would thrill their hearts and fill their dreams with all emotions
That true love can bring
But black of mourning came one day when her sister passed away
And many said on bended knee she has gone and you must be our Queen
Rose of England sweet and fair shining with the sun
Rose of England have a care for where the thorn is
There the blood will run
Oh my heart oh my heart
To the abbey she did ride with her lover by her side
When they heard the church bells ring she was Queen
And one day he'd be King
But men of malice men of hate protesting to her chambers came
A foreign prince will have your hand for he'll bring peace
And riches to our land
She said Do you tell me that I cannot wed the one I love
Do you tell me that I am not mistress of my heart
And so with heavy weight of life she kissed her lover one last time
This land I wed and no man comes for if I cannot have you I'll have none
Rose of England sweet and fair shining with the sun
Rose of England have a care for where the thorn is
There the blood will run
Oh my heart oh my heart. <start> Only three stops to make in Alabama
Everyone a one night stand
Workin' for a man down South Louisiana
'Cause ZZ ain't his only band
Business has been good or bad
But sittin' here will drive me mad
And I'm gonna get back where they want me
Get back where they want me
Get back where they want me
Make a stand
I'm gonna take it like a man
Met a stray woman I think it was in Texas
She was made for those who'd pay
Gotta little drunk and raised a mild ruckus
The city said I could not stay
I guess I'm gonna have to change until my life is rearranged
You know I'm gonna get back where they want me
Get back where they want me
Get back where they want me
Make a stand
I'm gonna take it like a man <start> Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you Julia.
Julia Julia oceanchild calls me
So I sing a song of love Julia
Julia seashell eyes windy smile calls me
So I sing a song of love Julia.
Her hair of floating sky is shimmering glimmering
In the sun
Julia Julia morning moon touch me
So I sing a song of love Julia.
When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind Julia.
Julia sleeping sand silent cloud touch me
So I sing a song of love Julia.
Hum hum hum hum calls me
So I sing a song of love Julia Julia Julia. <start> As soon as youre born they make you feel small
By giving you no time instead of it all
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
They hurt you at home and they hit you at school
They hate you if your clever and they despise a fool
Till youre so fucking crazy you cant fallow their rules
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
When theyve tortured and scared you for  odd years
Ah then they expect you to pick a career
When you cant really function youre so full of fear
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
Keep you doped wit religion and sex and TV
And you think youre so clever and classless and free
But youre still fucking peasants as far as I can see
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
Theres room at the top they are telling you still
But first you must smile as you kill
But if you want to be like the folks on the hill
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
If you want to be a hero well just follow me
If you want to be a hero well just follow me
Just follow me <start> Mark volman

A regular picturesque
Postcardy mountain
Residing between lovely
Rosamond and gorman
With his stunning wife ethel
A tree a tree.
Billy was a mountain
Ethel was a tree growing off of his shoulder
Billy was a mountain
Billy was a mountain
Ethel was a tree growing off of his shoulder
Ethel was a tree growing off of his shoulder

Billy had two big
Caves for eyes
With a cliff for a jaw
That would go up or down
And whenever it did
He'd puff out some dust
And hack up a boulder hack.
Hack up a boulder hack hack.
Hack up a boulder hack hack.
Hack up a boulder.

Oh I forgot to mention this is where we take our intermission.
We will see you in a few minutes
Thank you we'll be back. <start> The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh I beg I beg and plead singing
Come out of the things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed singing
You are you are
Confusion that never stops
The closing walls and the ticking clocks gonna
Come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know singing
Come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities am I
A part of the cure
Or am I part of the disease singing
You are you are

You are you are
And nothing else compares
And nothing else compares
And nothing else compares
You are you are

Kissing girls in English at the back of the stairs
You're a honey with a following of innocent boys
They never know it
Because you never show it
You always get your way
They never know it
Because you never show it
You always get your way
Have you and her been taking pictures of your obsessions
'Cause I met a boy who went through one of your sessions
In his blue velour and silk
You liberated
A boy I never rated
And now he's throwing discus
For Liverpool and Widnes
You liberated
A boy I never rated
And now he's doing business
The stars of track and field you are
The stars of track and field you are
The stars of track and field are beautiful people
Could I write a piece about you now that you've made it
About the hours spent the wilderness in your training
You only did it so that you could wear
Terry underwear
And feel the city air
Run past your body
Your terry underwear
And feel the city air
Run past your body
Could I write a requiem for you when you're dead
She had the moves she had the speed it went to her head
She never needed anyone to get her round the track
But when she's on her back
She had the knowledge
To get her into college
But when she's on her back
She had the knowledge
To get her where she wanted

Hell I just want to cross the line with you

You got me rocking rolling like New Orleans

Little bit a drink little wink wink
Tell me what you think

To wind up on this bar stool next to you
Shooting quila with a hottie

Good Lord has blessed me with a hell of an angel tonight

Hides so many worlds away

This is the track that we have laid

All these angels scared to walk the wire line.

They get you in a corner shut your eyes
They come at you at night.
They get you in a corner shut your eyes
They come at you at night.
One less bell to warn ya
One more chance to say goodbye.
I don't think I understand you.
I don't really think I do.
I don't think I understand you.
I don't really think I do.
Hey louise what's the barrier between love and me
And how far is it from long and need
What are you supposed to mean to me
What do you mean to me
They get you in a corner shut your eyes
They come at you at night.
They get you in a corner shut your eyes
They come at you at night.
One less bell to warn ya
One more song to play
I'm going back to california
Gonna get your chance to say goodbye
Hey matthew is anybody mean to you
And don't you harbor points of view
Secretly believe you're due
I don't think I understand you.
I don't really think I do.
I don't think I understand you.
I don't really think I do.
Well ya got one less bell to warn ya
One more song to play
I'm going back to california
Gonna get your chance to say goodbye
One less bell to warn ya
One last chance to say goodbye. <start> I need a bigger mood
To block out the sun
I don't want to see what I've become
And you could fight your way
Give back what you really want
It's nothing special anyway
Chorus
Yeah you're always in my way
I'm falling faster everyday
Yeah you're always in my way
I gotta spit you out
You bring me down
Everything just crashes to the ground
'Cause you were always in my way
I can feel a brake
A bruise from another day
It's hard to say just what I feel
It all seems broken now
When I'm stuck on the inbetween
Staring at something out of reach
Chorus <start> Blue Guitar
Blue guitar
Fortune of my ways
Making of my days.
New chord
Counting up the ways
Happiness is lazy.
If you don't know the song
If you can't put the words to the tune
Tell the rhyme from the reason
What should it matter
To the fool or the dreamer
New hope
Travellers in a storm
Finding love is warm.
New day
The world has just begun
Our eyes have seen the sun.
If you don't know the way
If you can't see the wood for the trees
Taste the wine from the water
Well what should it matter

No one asked me but that's my advice. Thanks to that soulclapping audience of Yale Rep on . MB
My friend Steve he wears his heart on his sleeve
All the girls seem to leave him lonely
Well I'm a nice guy with a shoulder to cry on
With one bit of advice only
You gotta inch your way working every day
Showing her all your love
Lighten her load but keep it on the road and you'll grow it
So don't you blow it
Take another baby step up the mountain of love
It's a long long ways and so high up above
Hold her hand so tightly and up up you will climb
That wonderful mountain of love one baby step at a time
Icarus standing on the shore with his dad saying that he wants to fly
Dad says son I can hook up the wings if you promise not to go too high
But he forgot what he said and he lost his head
He headed straight for the sun
That sealed his fate he was a little too late for returning
Now he's burning
Take another baby step up the mountain of love
It's a long long ways and so high up above
Hold her hand so tightly and up up you will climb
That wonderful mountain of love one baby step at a time
Keep a walking. Little bitty steps are gonna work it brother
Keep a walking right on
Putting one foot in front of the other take it
Take another baby step up the mountain of love
It's a long long ways and so high up above
Hold her hand so tightly and up up you will climb
That wonderful mountain of love one baby step at a time <start> Dentro en m

Like the lightning that burns down houses
Or the wind that blows down doors
Oh I see it in the distance
It moves much faster than I think
Yes this storm will wreak much havoc
Bring my sanity to the brink
Once I was so young and careless
Never strayed much from the path
Now I find myself in trouble
Never knowing when to laugh
And as my eyes sink in my skull
I am wired to the max
Gonna pull myself together
You can see I'm coming back
If the storm is coming the storm is coming
The storm is coming
It's gonna make a beautiful sound
I hope it turns your life upside down
Now the wooden gate is creaking
And the windows loudly rattle
Yet I still venture towards it
Like I'm marching into battle
Oh I could heed your good advice
And stay in comfort back at home
Yet there it is in splendor
And it's chilling me down to the bone
Once I was so young and careless
Never strayed much from the path
Now I find myself in trouble
Never knowing when to laugh
And as my eyes sink in my skull
I am wired to the max
Gonna pull myself together
I got to pull myself together
If the storm is coming the storm is coming
The storm is coming
It's gonna make a beautiful sound
I hope it turns your life upside down
If the storm is coming the storm is coming
The storm is coming
It's gonna make a beautiful sound
I hope it turns your life upside down

I hope it turns your life upside down <start> I'm not in your house
But I'm not in your head
You're not even listening.
It's so hard to know
When you're not scared.
Please don't help me
Please don't hate me.
Stop putting me down
'Cause I won't ever understand.
I see it in your eyes
I see it in your mind.
I'm trying not to speak
'Cause you can't hear my voice
Nothing seems familiar here.
On the other side
Of this town.
Please don't help me
Please don't help me.
Stop putting me down
'Cause I won't ever understand.
I see it in your eyes
I see it in your mind.
Hold on
Hold on
If I see this all again
I'll try to take my time
I wonder how fast you could try.
All this time I thought you knew
All this time I thought you knew <start> Standing in the bog of a west end bar
Guy on the right leaning over too far
Money in my pocket gonna put it in the slot
Open up the pack see what type I got
I didn't want to hold you
I didn't want to use you
Protex protex blue
All I want to do
It's a fab protective for that type of a girl
But everybody knows that she uses it well
It's a therapeutic structure I can use at will
But I don't think it fits my V.D. bill
I didn't want to hold you
I didn't want to use you
Protex protex blue
All I want to do
Protex protex blue
All I want to do
Sitting in the carriage of a bakerloo
Erotica my pocket got a packet for you
Advert on the escalator on my way home
I don't need no skin flicks I want to be alone
I didn't want to hold you
I didn't want to use you
Protex protex blue
All I want to do ooh ooh ooh

My separate kingdom
I lead you to
Your certain freedom
I'll be there soon
Where I have seen them
I'm on my way
To my separate kingdom
First time in years
Facing something for your worst fear
Mother ship so high
So what for the knees we rise
Round and down
And round we go
To this place I do not know
A sudden turn
And quick to learn
Of our future
I see right to
My separate kingdom
I lead you to
Your certain freedom
Scrabbled in alone
Being waiting for years to go
Better keep from the side
Or bit to the world unknown
Round and down
And round we go
To this place I do not know
A sudden turn
And quick to learn
Of our future
Round and down
And round we go
The time is place to land of known
Miles to past
Here at last
In our future
Round and down
And round we go
To this place I do not know
A sudden turn
And quick to learn
Of our future
Round and down
And round we go
The time is place to land of known
Miles to past
Here at last
In our future
I see right to
My separate kingdom
I lead you to
Your certain freedom
I'll be there soon

Everybody in the house
Stomp your feet clap your hands

Kick it with the band
We're all about tradition
We don't mind the twang
We've got just one condition now
Chorus
We like it loud
We like it honkin'
The party won't be revvin'
Till we crank it to eleven
Get it rockin'
Our boots are knockin'
We're gonna say it proud
We love our country and we like it loud
Calling all the cowboys
Don't be scared to make some noise
Think you're bad think you're strong
C'mon people bring it on
Calling all you sexy mommas
All the girls next door
Don't say we didn't warn you baby

From out in California
New York to Tennessee
Come on if you're with us
Let us hear you scream
We like it loud
We like it loud
We like it loud

Life without love is meaningless
To live in love is all there is
Life without love is meaningless
Life without love is life denied
To live in love is life defined
To take a life or I'll give you mine
Is to see life where life was blind
To live in love is all there is
One life without love is meaningless
And all you are and all you'll be
And all you think and all you'll feel
And everything you'll hear or see
To live in love is to be <start> I hope you know how the pain i went threw
trying to clean up everyone elses act
and figure out my life
watched you walk out
watched the leave
knowing ive tried to forget those moments
it is forgiven
but not forgotten
chorus
If I wrote a letter to you
heres what it'd say
Your pathetic
your a miserable image of what a man should be
my mom took your place and still did hers
now theres a real woman
i love you
but i really don't like
Verse
So I used your image of a man
of an example of what not to be
I am good and broken

but now your gone

Not so funny I gotta scam
Home cooked meals are not for me
I gotta eat out tonight can't you see
Jack in the Box Dairy Queen Pizza Hut Burger King Taco Bell  Foster Freeze Baskin Robbins
I'm on a fast food diet I need that greasy diet
On a fast food diet maybe you should try it
Mom works late so she won't cook
She wants me to read the recipe book
Shine that mom give me some money
Betty Crocker's way too funny. <start> Ya el sol se esta escondiendo la calle calentndose
Las babys llamando al celu reportndose
Salgo guillado para la calle a dar la vuelta
Mucho efectivo para romper la discoteca
La calle esta buena para romperla
Muchas mujeres solteras estn en lista de espera
Sola piden carretera para romperla
Adicta a perreo adicta al sateo al maleanteo 
La noche esta para quebrarla duro reventarla
Le gusta el guaya guaya por eso llego en falda
Y yo que soy sato rpido la pongo espalda
Veinticuatro hacia arriba ms cuarenta de nalgas
Siempre hablando de cortas pana aqu no hay breacke
Siempre pagamos cacho ustedes con
No es nada con los Jocker pisa las Jordan 
Siempre con ms de treinta para el que no haga un Feat
La calle me gusta por eso campeo
Botellas en la hoca gatas para el jangueo
Ustedes me roncan de aqu no los veo
No tienen estilo y ni palabreo
La calle esta buena para romperla
Muchas mujeres solteras estn en lista de espera
Sola piden carretera para romperla
Adicta a perreo adicta al sateo al maleanteo 
Hoy rompo como terremoto la calle la disco y lo combos
Ustedes caminan y yo como que floto
Vistiendo tu sabes que yo siempre me boto
Viviendo como millo sin jugar la loto
Salte que nos fuimos la movie nos vivimos
Si me hablan de gastar mami yo no escatimo
Llegamos los rino con un porte asesino
Tequila Black Leybol caprica en padrino
Ya se esta escondiendo el sol y cae la noche
Me puse el prendn y acicale el coche
Si te saco a bailar no quiero reproches
Esto es para matarnos ya tu me conoces
La calle esta buena para romperla
Muchas mujeres solteras estn en lista de espera
Sola piden carretera para romperla
Adicta a perreo adicta al sateo al maleanteo

Up the hill to my safe holding
I find my blood in such low standing
I blame these sad things on me but I
Cut a smile in my face
So youll intake some fleeting comfort
And still
P
You say I
Contaminate your world with my touch
And I feel
That you brandish the weapon of passive aggression
Seems like
C
Your idea of perfect and mine
Are perfectly aligned
So lets be enemies
Till we see the sun go away
Whatd you think Id let you win
Ive grown to suffer you
Lashing out at me
Till I see the sun goway
B
Dont deny my tolerance
Dont take away these sad things from me
That aint nothing
You should see what I do to me
V
 Cut a smile in my face
So youll intake some fleeting comfort
Youve built a wall of beauty to help
Tolerate any discomfort

C
Your idea of perfect and mine
Are perfectly aligned
So lets be enemies
Till we see the sun go away
Whatd you think Id let you win
Ive grown to suffer you
Lashing out at me
I will stand alone
Your idea of perfect and mine
Are perfectly aligned
So lets be enemies
Till we see the sun go away
My idea of life sublime is having you
Far away <start> Everybody is tired
And poor and sick of trying
If you see me
On the corner
Will you stop or will you splash me
Take a look at
What we've become
Nothing more than silhouettes of
A pretty family
On a post card
Picture perfect I don't want it
So I hold my breath 'til my heart explodes
Cause this is how it is and this is how it goes
You can steal my body but you can't steal my soul
Cause this is how it is and this is how it goes
Shitty weather bad timing
Lucky penny glued to the ground
Dirty look from total stranger
Hope you get lost and you're not found
Take a look at what we've become
Nothing more than silhouettes of
A pretty family on a postcard
Picture perfect I don't want it
So I hold my breath 'til my heart explodes
Cause this is how it is and this is how it goes
You can steal my body but you can't steal my soul
Cause this is how it is and this is how it goes
This is how it it goes
This is how it it goes
This is how it it goes
This is how it it goes
So unscrew my head
And rinse it out
Polish my thoughts
Turn into doubts
Unscrew my head
And rinse it out
Polish my thoughts
Turn into doubts
Turn 'em into turn 'em into doubts
So I hold my breath 'til my heart explodes
Cause this is how it is and this is how it goes
You can steal my body but you can't steal my soul
Cause this is how it is and this is how it goes <start> Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
Angels on my left and right
To keep me safe all through the night
There's a place way up high
Starry bright there through the night there
Close your eyes let your wishes fly
You'll be in Dreamland by and by
Dimpled and drowsy off you go
Over the treetops sliding down a rainbow
Sleepyhead curl up in your bed
And 'til the sun says Rise and shine
Sleep warm in Dreamland baby mine
There's a place worlds away
Time has wings there green with springs there
Smiles and songs bloom on every tree
Only in Dreamland just wait and see <start> Blessed be
Messed up me
Should I feel different Was I
Crying to get my face wet
To discern what I did from what I thought
It's hard to discern what I gave from what I got
It's part of me.
Blessed be.
Low lit theater
Quiet crowd
I'm on the screen projected
I'm in the aisle yelling fire. <start> Biting down feeling the pressure again
It's no more than we deserve eyes closed to collect sun
Tearing it down burning bridges away
There's no return now leaving home today
We turn to face the storm
Just a sign of life to bring us home
Turning around trying to face the strange
It's no more than we deserve no more words to say
Coming around there's no distance to go
Lying face down on the floor reaching out for something new
We turn to face the storm
Just a sign of life to bring us home
We burn to face the storm
We lose everything and everyone
Farther... Slower...
We burn to face the storm
We lose everything and everyone
We turn to face the storm
Just a sign of life to bring us home
We burn to face the storm
We lose everything and everyone <start> Can't remember my name can't remember at all
Finding you from past times I think
How did we ever fall
Never knowing the answers calling myself names
Now is not the question for us
Will it ever be again
Why don't you just fly fly to me
How long will you wait for me Never
Now or never again
Feel me up inside you how you quiver and shake
Can I rape you back to my life
Will you trust me again Now or never
I'll never let you down so fly to me
How long can I wait
Why don't you just fly fly to me
How long will you wait for me Never
Now or never again <start> I got a feeling inside
About to drive me half wild
I'm not afraid of it
Kinda like the taste of it
We're gonna get it on tonight
Things are feeling oh so right
It makes me tingle inside so gimme more gimme more
Chorus
I'm a stranger in a strange land
I'm not afraid of it kinda like the taste of it
You really got to understand
I'm not abusing it girl because I'm choosing it
I'm a stranger in a strange land
I'm not afraid of it want a little more of it
It's only ten o'clock
Really fell the need to rock
I think I got it now
No one has to show me how
I'm feeling more at home
I don't feel the need to roam
Everything is in the right place
So gimme more gimme more
Chorus
When the feeling is right there's no need ot fight
I'd rather make love to you
So come along for the ride don't want to see you hide
You can please me while I'm pleasing you yeah
Chorus <start> Please excuse my point of view
And allow me to intrude
I have given up on what I thought I knew
And our ignorance is bliss
So we're hiding out in it
Wnd I guess it doesn't matter what we've missed
Would it scare you away if I was sixtyfive feet tall
Would it make you afraid if there was nothing left al all
It's nearly impossible
Highly improbable
But not hopeless
We are swallowed up in it
And it's neither here nor there
So it makes no sense that anyone would care
And it feels like innocence
When you choose to not resist
We fulfill our needs at everyone's expense <start> I was born in the state where my mother was raised
With the children of soldiers the children of slaves
And it's too much to take the mind how it breaks
The lessons the stories the shame and the glories and all
They linger 'round
Foxes and hounds
Our souls are bound
To older ground
Fell in love with a girl who's found love before
In the hands and the hearts of the people she wore
She's all that I see but there's things in between
The fractures and fissures of all of the pictures we leave
They linger 'round
Foxes and hounds
They're with me now
Can't lay them down
And I feel it all around I'm surrounded
And I feel it all around I'm surrounded
And I feel it all around I'm surrounded by ghosts
So we keep them at home the secrets and bones
The voices we hear so we're never alone
They tease and they taunt comfort and haunt
My mother and father and so many I'll never know
They linger 'round
Foxes and hounds
My hands are bound
And I feel it all around I'm surrounded
And I feel it all around I'm surrounded
And I feel it all around I'm surrounded by ghosts <start> instrumental
this song consists of snatches of Processional and Chairman Mao Reminisces About His Days in Southern China  <start> One step for boys and one step for girls

One step for you and one step for me
Step away
But don't take the third step
'Cause that's just the sad lover's waltz
But don't take the third step
'Cause that's just the sad lover's waltz
One step for anger and one step for pain
Step away
One step for right and one step for wrong
Step away
But don't take the third step
'Cause that's just the sad lover's waltz
Don't take the third step
'Cause that's just the sad lover's waltz
One step for boys and one step for girls
Step away
One step for you and one step for me
Step away
One more step makes three
And three step's a waltz
Don't take a third step
'Cause that's just a sad lover's waltz <start> So the light grew dark
And they hid their hearts
They didn't think that it would ever get better
And now the kids are all dancing
A lightning trance
And the young hearts are told to surrender
And now they want us to make this clear
That it's all right here
But now the psychics are gone don't I know it
And we're becomin' aware
There's something charged in the air
It feels like love but we're so afraid to show it
So now it's all war
Can you remember how you lived before
Was there a time in your life without a war
You never think that there might be something more
Yeah they're coming alive tonight
They be preparing now.
They're ready to fight
The sky is electric my skin don't feel right
But either way it's gonna end all right end all right
Oh they're comin' around now
They're comin' <start> If money talks than I'm a mime
If time is money than I'm out of time
And I was once with a million quid
Have a seat I'll tell ya what I did
Can't sit down because I'm a dancer
And you know that I'm the answer
Die slow die fast now
Cause its never going to last now
We'll karaoke all night long
We'll Macarena 'til the break of dawn
We'll drive around until the morning light
All night all night all night all night
Baby you got to single before you turn
I think you're heading for the disco burn
Cause the future is in the future
And the past is a big brick wall
You know I need to make you understand now
I'm a man not a disco ball
Can't sit down because I'm a dancer
And you know that I'm the answer
Die slow die fast now
Cause its never going to last now
We'll karaoke all night long
We'll Macarena 'til the break of dawn
We'll drive around until the morning light
All night all night all night all night
We'll karaoke all night long
We'll Macarena 'til the break of dawn
We'll drive around until the morning light
All night all night all night all night
All night all night all night all night
All night all night all night all night
All night all night all night all night
All night all night all night all night <start> You tried out for the high school team
So you would have some childhood dreams
That you and your father could share
Football coach said you're too small
Don't even think of basketball
You knew you were destined to fail
Went to the track meet
Wanna be an athlete 
Get back in your seat they said
Go to the dugout
Three strikes you struck out 
And home runs flew over your head
Looking down on rock 'n' roll
And you dreamed of scoring goals
You're saving those dreams for your bed
Thought it was cool to be a jock
You ended up a rentacop
A dozen donuts in your hand
You're a loser
A sore loser
Now it seems the tables turned
The game of life you should have learned
So try using some of your brains
All your high school friends are stars
Driving really fancy cars
The irony drives you insane <start> In a perfect storybook the world is brave and good
A hero takes your hand a sweet love will follow
But life's a different game the sorrow and the pain
Only you can change your world tomorrow
Let your smile light up the sky
Keep your spirit soaring high
Trust in your heart and your sun shines forever and ever
Hold fast to kindness your light shines forever and ever
I believe in you and me
We are strong
When 'once upon a time' in stories and in rhyme
A moment you can shine and wear your own crown
Be the one that rescues you
Through the clouds you'll see the blue
Trust in your heart and your sun shines forever and ever
Hold fast to kindness your light shines forever and ever
I believe in you and me
We are strong
A bird all alone on the wing
Can still be strong and sing
Sing
Trust in your heart and your sun shines forever and ever
Hold fast to kindness your light shines forever and ever
I believe in you and me
We are strong <start> Goin' down to Rosie's
Stop at Fanny May's

Now don't you start me talkin'
I'll tell everything I know

'Cause somebody gotta go
She borrowed some money

'Cause somebody gotta go <start> Oh it's a message in crumbles

In un mattino sovrannaturale
Fra cavalieri sieropositivi
E nuova luce e verit
Che noia devo violare
Verr come un rapace
A mutilare la pace
Dentro nel tuo cuore eppoi
Se vuoi la mia reazione
Essia
Essia
Essia
Essia
Essia
 nuovo piacere
Che si avvolge
A tutto quello che credi
E il serpente che dorme ai tuoi piedi
Ti disintossica le vene
Dai resti del mio seme
Verr come un rapace
A mutilare lo scorpione
Dentro nel tuo cuore eppoi
Se vuoi una mia reazione
Essia
Essia
Essia
Essia
Essia
Nei sogni che sogni
Ci sono I tuoi amici
Il re la regina
Sono vuoti lo sai
Sono pi vuoti che mai
Sono pi vuoti che mai

Sono vuoti lo sai <start> Sweetheart the ocean has its gold and has its fear in its skies each night
In glory are the weights that pull me far and deeper still to the end
my destiny
Hunting for thrills for gold and silver
Honey they bury me today for gold and silver
Gold and silver for gold and silver
For gold and silver
For gold and silver
Silver
They buried me in light caught and shackled to the aisle cannonball that takes with me
Here at the bottom I dreamt of creatures far beyond your wildest sparkling dreams
How I love the sea
No glory in my spirit breaks Ill never taste your lips or touch your skin our end is here
Hunting for thrills for gold and silver
Honey they're burying me today for gold and silver
Gold and silver for gold and silver
Gold and silver for gold and silver <start> I thought that you were over with it
Told me it was time to quit it
And now you're saying you regret it
Just a little late
So listen I was really in love
Then I went and found a new drug
Something that was legal enough
Just a little late
One more time I tell you so you know that this is real
One more time I tell you so you know just how I feel
I fill you in
I got a new love oh what a fase
Holding it down she's running the place
I got a new love talk of the town
I I I said it now
I got a new love just couldn't wait
All of my friends are calling it fate
I got a new love you might have met
I I I'm saying it
You make me feel like going insane
Call me every cuss you can name
Now you want it back in the game
Just a little late
Some people never learn how to cope
Think everything will come that they hope
Sorry but the answer is no
Just a little late
One more time I tell you so you know that this is real
Well I said one more time I tell you so you know just how I feel
I fill you in
I got a new love oh what a fase
Holding it down she's running the place

All of my friends are calling it fate
I got a new love you might have met

You're gonna need to know me to know that means no 
So you don't no you don't need to know
But you keep asking me begging me
Baby please be careful what you wish for
This will only hurt you more
I got a new love oh what a fase
Holding it down she's running the place

Me pierdo un poco en el juego
De quererte enamorar
Trato de hacer lo que puedo
Tu sonres desde lejos
Y no se disimular
En intentar no soy bueno
Y a veces me desespero
Siempre me gusta ganar
Tu siempre sales delante
Con tu mirada elegante
Yo tan poco natural
Ay mira que me gusta todos
Los colores claros tu melancola
Ay mira que nada me importa
Ms que tus secretos tu fantasa
Qu bueno estar a tu lado mi amor
Y ver pasar la vida
Luego cantarte tu bolero mi amor
Hasta que llegue el da
Yo con mi voz de bolero
Siempre algo lo que ms quiero
Tan poco me va mal
Me gusta ver la maana
Quedarme un rato en la cama
Y sentirte respirar
Aunque el da no sea bueno
Salgo a buscarte y te espero
Para poderme escapar
Entre tu boca y tu pelo
Con mis ganas y sin miedo
Nadie nos puede parar
Ay mira que me gustan todas
Tus verdades claras
Y tu fantasa
Ay mira que nada me importa
Ms que tu mirada
Y tu poesa
Qu bueno estar a tu lado mi amor
Y ver pasar la vida
Luego cantate un bolero mi amor
Hasta que llegue el da
Ay mira que me gustan todas
Tus verdades claras
Y tu fantasa
Ay mira que nada me importa
Ms que tu mirada
Y tu poesa
Qu bueno estar a tu lado mi amor
Y ver pasar la vida
Luego cantarte un bolero mi amor
Hasta que llegue el da <start> Sleep my little baby while you can.
Stay up all night and be tired.
Sleep my little angel like a lamb.
But unlike the sheep follow no man.
Tomorrow's your big day to show off your smile.
Smile. Smile for everyone.
You may fly to Paris in a dream.
Free in the sky like a real bird.
You may not accomplish anything.
If you don't sleep you'll be lazy  baby.
Tomorrow's your big day to show off your smile.
Smile. Smile for everyone.
Drift like a little boat on a wave.
Drift like a little boat on a wave.
Drift like a little boat on a wave.
Tomorrow's your big day to show off your smile.
Smile. Smile for everyone.
Sail through the sea of sad faces with love.
Love. Love for everyone.
Drift like a little boat on a wave. <start> Caps lock can eat my fuckin' arse
You you hear
Get out from under my finger cunt
Don't want to type like I'm shouting
AHHHHHHHHH <start> The time is now and I'm running so thin
I got thin I got thin while the others got fat
So fatten up and deliver your secrets
Those secrets those stories untold
Sorry to say love is a game
We're all just pawns in the way
Lost lost lost move the rookEeight
Eliminate and get this game underway
Too many secrets are shattering our lives
While others are stuck in expansive time
I've been trying to get out of this
Goddamn fucking game
So back it up and up to down
Down downtown don't you tell me wrong
Choose your battle of words that rule the world
It's in our heads anyway
Speak of the devil and I just may appear
I appeared in your dream when you dreamed of getting ahead
Headless chickens that are missing their exes
So axe this and go to the next next chapter
Too many secrets are shattering our lives
While others are stuck in expansive time
I've been trying to get out of this
Goddamn fucking game
So back it up and up to down
Down downtown don't you tell me wrong
Choose your battle of words that rule the world
It's in our heads anyway
Incomprehensible
Which shall I be a warlock or a priest
A pagan Christian or an evangelist
Pledge my alliance in the name of science
Follow the moth into the fire
Getting my head in a bit of a twist
What does it matter when your enemies are my friends
Self serve friends who are friends for a second
I second that notation it feels so intense
Intensely fishing without a hook line and sinker
I sank to bottom we'll bottoms up to you
Please inject some instant karma
Into my instant coffee
Soon soon soon with the rope in the kitchen
All the answers will be on there way
Too many secrets are shattering our lives
While others are stuck in expansive time
I've been trying to get out of this
Goddamn fucking game
So back it up and up to down
Down downtown don't you tell me wrong
Choose your battle of words that rule the world
It's in our heads anyway <start> There she goes there she goes.
All dressed up and walking you found somebody new.
I don't want nobody I was happy with you.
There she goes.
I never said I love you but you know that I do.
I can't believe it's over I keep thinking of you.
I see her everywhere everywhere I go.
I see her everywhere everywhere I go.
There she goes there she goes.
There she goes.
Don't know why she left me don't know what I'll do.
I don't want no council I was happy with you.
I see her everywhere everywhere I go.
I see her everywhere everywhere I go.
There she goes there she goes.
I want to cry over you.
There she goes there she goes.
There she goes there she goes.
There she goes there she goes there she goes. <start> Suddenly it all occurred to me
Lost as I am
There's breathing room
On both sides me
So what if we beg to differ my friend
That dissolves away as fast as gravity will take me
Suddenly I came to be lost in my head
A victim of anxiety
So what if I beg to differ my friend
Let's fall away as fast as gravity will take us there
Guide me way beyond this
Way beyond this world
Thought you would
Guide me way beyond this
Way beyond this world
Suddenly what all occurred to me got to my head
Your broken words inspire me
So what if we beg to differ my friend
We dissolve away too fast as gravity takes us there
Guide me way beyond this
Way beyond this world
Thought you would
Guide me way beyond this
Way beyond this world
You taught me to face what I've never seen
Then you let me lie 
You taught me to hate above everything
Then you sold me lies 
I'm trying to erase what you've done to me
Guide me way beyond this
Way beyond this world
Thought you would
Thought you would
Thought you would
Guide me way beyond this
Way beyond this world
Thought you would
Guide me way beyond this
Way beyond this world
Thought you would
Thought you would

Guide me way beyond this

Together like a lion
The kind everybody wants to know
She can fool you with her ways
Leave you with nothing much to say
And you try not to hang around
But you really don't want to see her go away
She's the kind of girl
Mary golden time
Sunshine and flowers in her hair
Simple ways she don't complain
She likes to move
She won't explain
And you wonder in the night
If everything was right with you
She might remain
Doesn't everybody want to hear
Doesn't everybody want to know
What it is to be so near
And watch it go
She's the kind of girl
Really has to see
What it is that's on your mind
She takes the time and understands
She makes no judgments no demands
But she makes you feel the fool
When you wonder how she slipped
Right through your hands <start> What if the world splits into two
Would you lie in the fracture or look for the glue
What if the bomb drops out of the sky
Would you watch the explosion or just run and hide
I know it seems easier than it really is
What if the liar once told the truth
Would it destroy your conceptions by the skin of your tooth
What if your friends turned out to be fakes
Would you say that you knew or admit your mistakes
What if your friends were lying to you
Would you see through the reason or think it was true
What if the liar once told the truth
Would you hear the protesting or destroy the youth <start> Ooh baby can you hear me
Down the phone
Do you still wear that precious stone
Just maybe you wanna talk to me
You'll never guess where I have been
I'm livin' with an alien
Where everything is green
A simple twist of fate again
As I slip into my dream
If you're wonderin'
And you don't know where I've been
I'm on another road
I did not hear the bell
Now I'm flyin'
I'm not livin' in my skin
I'm on another code
I'm in a cosmic spell
 <start> There's a red light on the hill
And a bridge out going down
There's a city limits marker
Of an unfamiliar town
With my head slightly bent
I can see it in the light
Unknown passage
Cuttin' like a knife through the night
Headlights on the highway
There's a mist coming down
I can hear someone crying
I know that sound
It's the morning before daybreak
A hundred miles down the line
Unknown passage
Cuttin' like a knife through the night
Asked Where are you going 
Somewhere far away
She was standing at the window
I won't forget her face
With my suitcase and my old car
I'm driving somewhere blind
Unknown passage
Cuttin' like a knife through the night
Cuttin' like a knife through my eyes <start> I like punk and i like sham
I got nicked over at west ham
I'm a fool i guess its true
For all i know I'll be in the back with you
In a Police Car Police Car Police Car Police Car
Police come in one hour later.
They've been looking for a guy named Freddy Jesper
Show me my freedom they know i lie
For all we knew we were going for a ride.
In the back of a Police Car Police Car Police Car Police Car <start> Empty fields move me so much more then rooms filled up with friends
The way the trees look dead
Reminds me that there's more to life then living
Maybe giving ups not bad but part of letting go of you
If I surrender to this feeling maybe all the aches
And pains will go and I can close my eyes
Never again to have them open till I bleed out all I've been
I don't want to be alone no more
No more
So take this razor sign your name across my wrists
So everyone will know who left me like this
Show me all my scars scars run deep
Maybe mine are not to forget the times that we've had
Empty fields move me so much more then rooms filled up with friends
The way the trees look dead
Remind that there's more to life then living
Maybe giving ups not bad but part of letting go of you
So take this razor sign your name across my wrists
So everyone will know who left me like this
Show me all my scars run deep
Maybe mine are not to forget the times we've had
Never wait another second I have wasted so much time
And I have wasted so much time
So much time
So much time
So take this razor sign your name across my wrists
So everyone will know who left me like this
Show me all my scars run deep <start> When you gonna grow up
Momma always said
Are you gonna walk around with a silly grin
And a bubble on your head
A spaceship landed by the mall
There was a big parade everybody got laid
And they burned all the books and the Chevrolets
And they grow so fast they never crawl
If you get tired of satellite fliers
And fame has let you down
Under the wire and over the moon
I'm alive
When you gonna grow up
Momma always said
But I just want to walk around with a dollar bill
And a coat that never sheds
A spaceship landed on the water
It was a holiday for the underpaid
Everybody got a haircut and lemonade
And they smiled just like it was their father
If you get tired of satellite fliers
And fame has let you down
Under the wire and over the moon
I'm alive
I'm alive
Play me a 
One for my radio
One for my love that came and went
So many stories
Hey man I'm sorry
This is just a song to pay the rent
To pay the rent
If you get tired of satellite fliers
And fame has let you down
Under the wire and over the moon
I'm alive
When you gonna grow up
When you gonna grow up
When you gonna grow up
When you gonna grow up <start> If I hear you knockin' hard upon my door Ain't no way that
I'm gonna answer it. 'cause cheating is a one thing and lying is another
And when I say it's over that's it I'm gonna quit Yeah yeah yeah yeah.
Now I ain't complaining just try'n to understand
What makes a woman do the things she does.
One day she'll love you the next day she'll leave you Why can't
We have it just the way it used to be Wooo. Why can't we have it baby.
'cause I'm a man I got my pride I don't need no woman to hurt me inside

Pack up and going to go
I'm gonna leave here by plane darling
Because railway is much too slow
I'm goin' back to my hometown
Where I'm better known
'Cause you haven't done nothing darling
But ruin a happy home
Now when the sun sinks in the hillside
The one you love will be gone
And I know I will be blue darling
But somehow I'll just travel on
Now would you rather care to kiss me
Or would you prefer to just say goodbye
'Cause I will turn and leave you darling
I don't want to see you cry <start> I feel like a quote out of context
Withholding the rest
So I can be for you what you want to see
I got the gesture and sound
Got the timing down
It's uncanny yeah you think it was me
Do you think I should take a class
To lose my southern accent
Did I make me up or make the face till it stuck
I do the best imitation of myself
The 'problem with you' speech
You gave me was fine
I liked the theories about my little stage
And I swore I was listening
But I started drifting
Around the part about me acting my age
Now if it's all the same
I've people to entertain
I juggle onehanded
Do some magic tricks and
The best imitation of myself
Maybe I'm thinking myself in a hole
Wondering who I am when I ought to know
Straighten up now time to go
Fool somebody else fool somebody else
Last night I was east with them
And west within
Trying to be for you what you want to see
But I can't help it with you
The good and bad comes through
Don't want you hanging out with
No one but me
Now if it's all the same
It comes from the same place
And if my mind's somewhere else
You won't be able to tell
I do the best imitation of myself
Yes it's uncanny to see
You'd really think it was me
The best imitation of myself
Do the best imitation of myself <start> Silent Is The Rain

Oh my friends keep on askin'
Boy what's wrong with you
I say I'm worried
Worried down with the blues
Try to be a good man
Work my fingers to the bone
And you return the favor
By messing up my happy home
You played so many dirty tricks
Till I lost my faith in you
Now you want me to take you back
What's a poor man supposed to do
Worried down with the blues
Oh yes I am
Worried down with the blues
Oh I feel like I was born to lose
Used to walk with pride with my head held high
Now I'm starin' down at my shoes
Yes I am worried
Worried down with the blues
You made me turn my back
On my very best friend
And when my back was turned
You were messin' around with him
I'd give up everything
To have you by my side
'Cause in the cold cold night when I reach for you
I'm holdin' to my foolish pride
Worried down with the blues
Oh yes I am
Worried down with the blues
Feel like I was born to lose
Used to walk with pride with my head held high
Now I'm starin' down at my shoes
Yes I am worried
Worried down with the blues oh yeah <start> Will we ever know if falling backwards could save us
Why not try it just once and hope that we survive
Even though we're running from what once was behind us
We still stand a chance to change our lives
For you I'll take one breath
And leave you with the memories you'll forget
For you I'd wait my life away
Just to be with you and to never feel this way
I'll pick up the pieces from whats gone and broke now
I'm sorry you're left with what I've become
We're lost in the moment our chapters are finished
Regret every minute I miss you so..
As each day will pass
We'll stop to take this time to find it in our hearts to share this night
A piece of you is here with me
But now you're gone
And I'll pick up the pieces from whats gone and broke now
I'm sorry you're left with what I've become
We're lost in the moment our chapters are finished
Regret every minute I miss you so..
I'll take one breath....
to forget.... <start> I used to hide my Camels in a paper bag
I only took them out when it was safe to drag
My first sixteen years in a Catholicboy suit
One father with a sixer and a steeltoe boot
He said son we're all...
Here today gone tomorrow
Here today gone tomorrow
One night in the mirror I saw a movie star
So I flew to Hollywood in a neighbor's car
A pack of NoDoz I'm a bundle of nerves
Laughing out loud as the highway curves
'Cause you see we're all just...
Here today gone tomorrow
Here today gone tomorrow
Twentytwo miles out of Pasadena
I picked up a hiker named Tina
Now we've only been here a couple of weeks
Soakin' up the sun the drugs and the freaks
We hit it off so we moved in together
Got a cat named Ringo and it purred like leather
We robbed a bank in Santa Monica
Bought a Caddy and a gold harmonica
We'd ride by day we'd play by night
We're makin' love every night
Here today gone tomorrow
Here today gone tomorrow
So we went up to Hef's to meet some bunnies
I saw Hugh he was actin' funny
He handed me some grass and a vodka  gin
That was about the time that Jack Webb walked in
He said Son I'm gonna tell you something
And it ain't pretty
There's a thousand ways to die in this naked city
Here today gone tomorrow
Here today gone tomorrow
Here today gone tomorrow
You know we're
Here today and gone tomorrow
Don't worry about it pop <start> I keep on runnin baby
I keep on runnin
But I just can't hide
No I just can't hide
I keep on hurtin baby
I keep on hurtin so deep inside
So deep inside
Lord I need your smile
Child like the one I once knew
Made my grass green
And my blue skies blue
Lord was time when  was 
Tell me now girl
Whereve all the good times gone
Cry me a river
Wash my blues all away
Cry me a river
Girl you is my riverboat
Take me away
Is reachin out my hand
won't ya please help me to my feet once again
Tears fallin like rain
Lord its a time
When everybody needs a friend
Girl whereve you been
Lord I need your smile
Child like the one I once knew
Made my grass green
And my blue skies blue
Lord was a time when  was 
Whereve all the good times gone
Cry me a river
Wash my blues all away
Cry me a river
Girl you is my riverboat
Take me away <start> A's for the anchor that lies at our bow
B's for the bowsprit and the jibs all lie low
C's for the capstan we all run around
D's for the davits to lower the boat down

Merrily merrily
So merry sail we no mortal on earth like a sailor at sea
Heave away haul away the ship rolls along
Give a sailor his grog and there's nothing goes wrong
E's for the ensign that at our mast flew
F's for the forecastle where lives our crew
G's for the galley where the salt junk smells strong
And H is the halyards we hoist with a song

I's for the eyebolts good for the feet
J's for the jibs that stand by the lee sheet
K's for the knighthead where the petty officer stands
L's for the leeside hard found by new hands

M's for the mainmast it's stout and it's strong
N's for the needle that never points wrong
O's for the oars of our old jolly boats
And P's for the pinnace that lively do float

Q's for the quarterdeck where our officers stand
And R's for the rudder that keeps the ship in command
S is for the stunsells that drive her along
T's for the topsail to get there takes long

U's for the uniform mostly worn aft
V's for the vangs running from the main gap
W's for water we're on a pint and a pound
And X marks the spot where old Stormy was drowned

Y's for yardarm needs a good sailor man
Z is for Zoe I'm her fancy man
Z's also for zero in the cold winter time
And now we have brought all the letters in rhyme
 <start> When I was the one with the ruined look
Clustering around my face and
Every last corner of the day was bruised and gray
Who drove tired in the rain
Just to dump my gin down the drain
Arguing me back from the ledge I can still hear you say
Every single thing is bound to come and go
Woah everything collides
and the rain starts falling down
It's a longshot longshot
but underdogs don't drown
Woah step into the bullets
but never touch ground
It's a longshot longshot
but we won't be shot down
So who's this with the car collision ache and the very last dime
telling me they can't keep guard one more blood night
Don't you know I am coming
With the lucky strikes and something
You used to say now tell me if I got it right
Every single thing is bound to come and go
So people do weird things to each other
That the consolation book doesn't cover
And if this night's been practicing you
In a page of rain on the old war wound
Flatline blue and the taste of loss
Call me I'll wade the tides with you boss
We will take this flood apart
And drag this lake for its watery heart <start> Fariz RMBintang Altris
Di kesuraman suasana malam
Kucari dimana bayang dirimu
Lelah ku bertanya pada angin yang berhembus
Adakah salam rindumu untukku
Tujuh purnama usaiku lalui
Rinduku tiada tertahankan lagi
Cinta harapanku walau hanya sekali
Kau datang membasuh rinduku
 Jangan kau buat diriku begini
Tenggelam dalam kerinduan tiada bertepi
Boleh saja kau membisu
Namun kau harus tahu
Batas rinduku tak jauh lagi
Mungkin salah kita berdua
Terjerat emosi buita belaka
Kini kusadari ku tiada dapat berpisah
Kerinduan terasa menyiksa
 <start> I don't owe you anything
What now
Not again
You're a person I will never comprehend
I've listened
I've tried
I can't change enough
To make you change your mind
I don't owe you anything <start> Dream... it was all a dream

I can't believe this is happening
Hmm hmm hmm...
Dream...
Uh... Dream
Uh... it was all a dream...
It was all a dream... 
Now it's reality... 
Just like it should be... <start> I am a voice
Inside your head
Telling you to let go
I fill a void
Inside your bed
I'm someone you'll never know
You know what keeps me by your side
The random acts of suicide
So I can come to save the day
I can't decide  which way to turn
I'm a son of a bitch  sometimes
I'll never learn
Somebody make up my mind
My heart will beat
You to the ground
As long as it beats alone
Scratch the surface
To hear the sound
Of somebody you'll never know
You know what keeps me by your side
The random acts of suicide
So I can come to save the day
I can't decide  which way to turn
I'm a son of a bitch  sometimes
I'll never learn
Somebody make up my mind
It feels so good to stand on someone that you love
I'll love you more when I feel like I've had enough
It feels so good to stand on someone that you love
I'll love you more when I feel like I've had enough
I can't decide  which way to turn
I'm a son of a bitch  sometimes
I'll never learn
Somebody make up my mind <start> When I close my eyes
I can see your face
And I want to scream
And I want to chase you out of my dreams
But there is no bed where he used to sleep
And it gets so cold where the one as heat
Now only in dreams
But there's nothing to say
At the end of the day
I'm wasted away
I found necklace that you used to wear
I found a sweater I still smell you there
Now only in dreams
I want to save you anyway I can I'll steal your rings and make these your hands
Yeah only in dreams
But there's nothing to say at the end of the day.
I'm wasted away
Wasted away
I'd rather waste away
I'd rather waste away
Id rather waste away than see you
Only in dreams
Oh
Oh
Oh
But there's nothing to say
At the end of the day
I'm wasting away
Wasting away
I'd rather waste away
I'd rather waste away
Id rather waste away than see you
Only in dreams
Only in dreams
Only in dreams
Only in dreams
Only in dreams <start> Was it destiny I don't know yet
Was it just by chance Could this be kismet
Something in my consciousness told me you'd appear
Now I'm always touched by your presence dear
When we play at cards you use an extra sense
You can read my hand I've got no defense
When you sent your messages whispered loud and clear
I am always touched by your presence dear
Floating past the evidence of possibilities
We could navigate together psychic frequencies
Coming into contact with outer entities
We could entertain each one with our theosophies
Stay awake at night and count your R E M's
When you're talking with your super friends
Levitating lovers in the secret stratosphere
I am still in touch with your presence dear
I am still in touch with your presence dear
I am still in touch with your presence dear dear dear dear dear <start> This day special day
You're beautiful
And this day special place
Your diary's locked
And this face the freshest face
In the world
And oh don't dignify their hatred
With any kind of response at all
And oh don't dignify their cruelty
Girls are the cruelest of them all
This day a special day
Your high school prom
And this time you won the game
You weren't even trying hard
And oh don't dignify their hatred
With any kind of response at all
And oh don't dignify their cruelty
Girls are the cruelest of them all
Girls are the cruelest of them all
You're beautiful
And oh don't dignify their hatred
With any kind of response at all
And oh don't dignify their jealously
'Cause you've got it all
Girls are the cruelest of them all
The cruelest of them all
Girls are the cruelest of them all
The cruelest them all
You're beautiful <start> I've got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world what a life I'm in love
I've got a song that I sing
I can make the rain go
Any time I move my finger
Lucky me can't you see I'm in love
Life's is a beautiful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly soandso
If I should ever let it go
I've got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world what a life I'm in love
Life's is a beautiful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly soandso
If I should ever let it go
I've got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger <start> You are standing on top of the world
With the rich on one side and the poor on the other
There's an ocean between them before your eyes
Is all of humanity ready to rise up
You are standing for love in the land
And all the people are searching for something
There's a notion that all can fulfill their dreams
Of living in freedom with all of their families
In your open arms giving grace
Holy palms wiping their faces of tears
To see your face and your open heart
Is comforting all of our fears
Jesus of Rio
And if everyone opened their eyes they'd see
That loving feeling is waiting within us
And if everyone opened their hearts they'd see
That every human is holy to someone
With your open arms giving grace
Holy palms wiping their faces of tears
To see your face and your open heart
Is comforting all of our fears
You are standing on top of the world
A sacred symbol of love everlasting
Devotion can lift us up to the skies
With all of humanity ready to rise up <start> It's a new day
Wasting away
Nothing to lose my friend
By the street lamp
Watching them move
On to the bus again
You're the old school
Breaking the rules
Party till the end
So you feel more
Something for
Hoping to make amends
Do you need
Somebody
Could it be anyone
But I know the answer
You're somebody
And if you feel this way again
These days you know they get better
If you feel this way again
These days can only get better
Star grace
Over your face
Into the night again
It's a cruel life
With nothing to bear
When everyone's a friend
It's a sweet song
All gone wrong
Don't seem like it will end
Put the blue sky
Into your life
Hope to make amends
And if you feel this way again
These days can only get better
If you feel this way again
These days can only get better
Sink sink it's coming round
Living it up
When you're feeling down <start> In the beginning since the dawn of man
In forest green and in desert sands
The yearning of humanity
To know that God is a reality
Is there a heaven is there a hell
Where angels sing and demons dwell
To know all this I used to think was wise
But then magoomba opened my eyes
Magoomba magoomba
Voodoo God of Africa
Magoomba
Magoomba magoomba
Voodoo God of Africa
Magoomba
Holy holy be his terrible name
Utter it once and go up in flames
Adorn his crown with butterflies
Ayin' the sign of the opened eye
The words of madness and mystery
The very power that he brings to me
I rave I rape I rip I rend
Is everlasting world without end
Magoomba rides upon the whirlwinds
Spawn from nature's ancient dream
He moves upon the world of mankind
Like the siren's scream
Does he like Buddha or Jesus Christ
Can he promise you a paradise
Does he bring light like Lucifer
Bestowing power by the rite of birth
The day of cross and trinity is done
The twilight of the Gods has come
It is the morning of magic and mirth
Magoomba lives upon the earth <start> How did we get left so far behind
well that's the question that is killing me
How could I relieve this son of mine
well that's the question that is killing me
The truth is arduous
I said I want to know the truth
the truth is arduous
you said yourself
How do they expect us to survive
when they have taken every breath from me
How will I relieve this son of mine
Well that's the question that is killing me
We've got to face our future enemies
or one day they'll take away everything. <start> So open promise fades
And the sun forgets to rise
I'm lonely and I'm thirsty
But it's better I stay dry
No more than two drinks away
From crying
Stare into the glass
And wait for the time to pass
And thank you for the offer
But you know I must decline
No more than two drinks away
From crying
There used to be a time
When I could hold my head up high
My life stretched out before me
And rivers flowed with wine
And had my love beside me
And everything was fine
But now the ride is over
It's hard to say goodbye
So open promise fades
And midnight turns to day
I'd love to drown my sorrow
But I cannot tell a lie
No more than two drinks away
From crying <start> I said take it easy baby
I worked all day
And my feet feel just like lead
You got my shirt tails
Flyin' all over the place
And the sweat poppin' out of my head
She said hey bossa nova baby
Keep on a workin' for
This ain't no time to quit
She said go bossa nova baby
Keep on dancin'
I'm about to have myself a fit
Bossa nova bossa nova
I said hey little mama
Let's sit down
Have a drink and dig the band
She said drink drink drink
Oh fiddle de dink
I can dance with a drink in my hand
She said hey bossa nova baby
Keep on workin' for
This ain't no time to drink
She said go bossa nova baby
Keep on dancin'
'Cause I ain't got time to think
Bossa nova bossa nova
I said come on baby
It's hot in here
And it's oh so cool outside
If you lend me a dollar
I can buy some gas
And we can go for a little ride
She said hey bossa nova baby
Keep on workin' for
I ain't got time for that
She said go bossa nova baby
Keep on dancin'
Or I'll find myself another cat
Bossa nova bossa nova
Bossa nova bossa nova
Bossa nova bossa nova <start> Are they at war who can justify
Are you so holy have you got the right
Who is the judge and who is your jury
Or let them get it by decree
What do you hold in front hold in front of them
It's only your Democracy.
There a killer on the street a killer on the trigger.
And who is the winner and who is the winner.
Theres a bomb gone off in Brighton a bomb gone off to kill.
Theres a bomb gone off in Brighton a bomb gone off to kill.
Killers Unite killers with the right.
Do you hold the pistol or cut by the knife.
So cry to me of cowards and countries with the right
The right to take up a fight.
Wiped out in a sea of hate as dust falls in the night.
Never to learn till disaster strikes.
There a killer on the street a killer on the trigger.
Theres a bomb gone off in Brighton a bomb gone off to kill.
Theres a bomb gone off in Brighton a bomb gone off to kill.
Are they at war who can justify
Are you so holy have you got the right
Who is the judge and who is your jury
Or let them get it by decree
What do you hold in front hold in front of them
It's only your Democracy.
Theres a bomb gone off in Brighton a bomb gone off to kill.
Theres a bomb gone off in Brighton a bomb gone off to kill.
Theres a bomb gone off in Brighton a bomb gone off to kill.
Theres a bomb gone off in Brighton a bomb gone off to kill. <start> We're killing ourselves and we know
Yet we can't escape the air
And seeing this all come to pass
We're convinced that we won't last
So seeing these patterns we act like it don't matter
Apathy is our tomb
Beyond all our reasons watching changes in seasons
Here we sit as it falls
I wanna see the comets fall to the ground
I wanna be there when it all comes down
I wanna see the blood that stained on their hands
I just wanna be I can't understand
So watch it go dark now
We can't take it back now
Sit relaxed as it burns
You say you want out now
Gotta save yourself somehow
Case and point you reap what you sow <start> I met you through a common friend
in the attic of my parents house
and though I didn't know it then
I soon was finding out
you are the roots that sleep beneath my feet
and hold the earth in place
each time a faucet opens
words are spoken
the water runs away
and I hear your name
no nothing has changed
there was this book I read and loved
the story of a ship
who sailed around the world and found
that nothing else exists
beyond his own two sails
and wooden shell
and what is held within
all else is sure to pass
we clutch and grasp
and debate what's truly permanent
but when the wind starts to shift
there's no argument
I sing and drink and sleep on floors
and try hard not to be annoyed
by all these people worrying about me
so when I'm suffering through some awful drive
you occasionally cross my mind
it's my hidden hope that you are still among them
well are you
Oh you are the roots that sleep beneath my feet
and hold the earth in place
each time a curtain opens
sunlight pours in
a lifetime melts away
and we share a name
on some picturesque grave <start> Te pido me perdones
Por mis desapariciones
El no verte por das
No es lo que tu supones
Que no es gusto no es mi voluntad
Que es lo que te digo
Que aunque no me veas yo voy a estar
Siempre contigo
La semana me parte en dos
De viernes a domingo
Tu visita me repara cuando nos conecta entonces vivo
Quiero que te vengas a vivir todos los das conmigo
Quiero que te vengas a vivir todos los das conmigo
Es el viernes y su amanecer
No quiero que te asustes
Al despertar no me vas a ver
Te ruego no me busques
Vive como si estuviera all
Ya vendr domingo
No te olvides nunca de quien fui
La semana me parte en dos
De viernes a domingo
Tu visita me repara cuando nos conecta entonces vivo
Quiero que te vengas a vivir todos los das conmigo
Quiero que te vengas a vivir todos los das conmigo
La semana me parte en dos
De viernes a domingo
Tu visita me repara cuando nos conecta entonces vivo
Quiero que te vengas a vivir todos los das conmigo
Quiero que te vengas a vivir todos los das conmigo
Quiero que te vengas a vivir todos los das conmigo
Quiero que te vengas a vivir todos los das conmigo
Quiero que te vengas a vivir todos los das conmigo
Quiero que te vengas a vivir todos los das conmigo
Quiero que te vengas a vivir todos los das conmigo
Quiero que te vengas a vivir todos los das conmigo <start> This year for Christmas
There's something I'd really like
So if you're up there somewhere Santa
Please don't bring me another bike
I don't need any ugly sweaters
And I don't play much basketball
But there's something kinda special
That I want most of all...
I want an alien for Christmas
Bring me an alien this year
I want a little green guy
About three feet high
With seventeen eyes
Who knows how to fly
I want an alien for Christmas this year
He can live in the bath tub
So don't worry about a thing
And I'll take him out for walks
When it gets nicer in the Spring
I'll always keep him company
He'll never be alone
And we can hang around the house all day
And watch the Twilight Zone
I want an alien for Christmas
Bring me an alien this year
I want a little green guy
About three feet high
With seventeen eyes
Who knows how to fly
I want an alien for Christmas this year
I want an alien for Christmas
Bring me an alien this year
I want a little green guy
About three feet high
With seventeen eyes
Who knows how to fly
I want an alien for Christmas this year
I want an alien for Christmas this year <start> One more mile one more detour
That's the way goes tears and smiles
I may miss you and I may wish that I have stayed
But I'll be moving it one more mile
And then one more I gotta keep moving
I was born a traveling child
It's my way and it's the nature of my mind
I gotta keep dogging it one more mile
Storms won't stop me wind won't do it
A little rough ride that fits my style
When the sun sets in the window of your world
I'll be dragging it one more mile
And then one more I gotta keep moving
I was born a traveling child
It's my way and it's the nature of my mind
I gotta keep dogging it one more mile
 <start> As we all marched ahead
In the early hours it began
Letter in my pocket still unread
The fire lit the sky went red
As we drew near the smell of death
Treading through the heavy silence left
I told myself I'd never lift a hand in hatred
I was wrong
Torn up reborn the way they made me
It's not long now
I tried in vain to look away
From the tragic sight of what remained
Wiped off the atlas our birth place
Those of us who still survived
Took to the hills before they came
Me my knife and my rifle sat in wait
I told myself I'd never lift a hand in hatred
I was wrong
Torn up reborn the way they made me
It's not long now
My love letter folded out
My last chance I did it now
I began to hear her read aloud
don't you fill your heart with hate
No matter what this world will take
Our love must not be disgraced.
I told myself I'd never lift a hand in hatred
You were right
Torn up reborn the way they made me
It's not long now it's not long now <start> Where do you wanna go
Now that we're apart and all alone
'Cause we can't go back
No we can't go back
What do I have to say
To make up for all my dumb mistakes
'Cause I can't take back
No I can't take back
You treated me so bad
So now that we're apart
How could you even be mad
Remember better days
All those memories I won't erase
But I won't look back
No I won't look back
Efforts and hopes I left
In a home where my whole life was kept
At least you're off my back
Now you're off my back
You treated me so bad
So now that we're apart
How could you even be mad
You'd want to fight
Most every night
Now that we're done
How will you have fun
Where are you gonna go
Where are you gonna go
Where are you gonna go... <start> Can you hear me
As I'm calling out your name
When you touch me
Do you feel it just the same
Cos you dance like no one's watching
And you love like no one's there
Can you see me here I am always there
If all of this feelings come and go
Then life is wasted on you
I'm not gonna throw it all away
Chorus
Can you see me now
Am I coming throughAm I invisible
Could we have had something incredible
Is this the way it's meant to be
I'm the man that you will never see
Can you help me
Deal with all this pain
In one moment yeah eveything can change
Are you waiting for the hero
You know heros often fall
Can you see me as I'm after all
If all of this feelings come and go
Then life is wasted on you
I'm not gonna throw it all away
Chorus
Can you see me now
Am I coming through
Am I invisible
Could we have had something incredible
Is this the way it's meant to be
I'm the man that you will never see
Like two large souls and broken heart
Is it destiny that's keeping us apart
I could live my life in this transparency
I'm the man that you will never see
Cos you dance like no one's watching
And you love like no one's there
Can you see me here I am always there
Chorus
Can you see me now
Am I coming through
Am I invisible
Could we have had something incredible
Is this the way it's meant to be
I'm the man that you will never see
Like two large souls and broken heart
Is it destiny that's keeping us apart
I could live my life in this transparency
I'm the man that you will never see <start> There are people going hungry far away
They've got nothing on their plates
And you're filling your fat face
With every different kind of cake
If you ever go lardy or go lame
I will drop you straight away
Oh that's the chance you're gonna take
For every stupid thing you say
There are people going lonely and they'll stay
Lonely far into the year
Cause you're making blinkers fashionable
And fashionably you'll say
All is equal in love and war
And I'm sorry but I've got some things to do
And you pretend to read a book
You'll never finish till the day
That the author dedicated
To a century of fakers
They took your mold and they burned it
On the fire in history today
Yeah the author dedicated
To a century of fakers
He was an anarchist
He tried his best but it wasn't good enough
La la la la la
Did I say I would see you soon Well I'm sorry
But I just came off my bike
And my face is scarred
And chance has barred me seeing you tonight
I was over the other side of the city
And if the truth be known I'd say
That you look great from there
Before you shaved your golden hair today
Everybody's trying to make us
Another century of fakers
They took you mold and burned it
On the fire of history today
Everybody's trying to make us
Another cool decade of fakers
And everybody's trying to make us
Another century of fakers
Everybody's trying to make us
Another century of fakers <start> Her glance can make you short of breath
Your heart stop dead inside your chest
She has what words just can't express
She gives a kiss that's cursed and says
I hate to love
A word a song a smile a tear
She doesn't care for me it's clear
I'll never tell but it hurt like hell
To see her turn and disappear
I hate to love
I hate to love
She's laughing beside someone else
And I'm alone beside myself
She's like no one else
Hung by my rope strung out hurt
Let it drop it just won't work
Stretch my neck across the block
Heart in my hand axe in hers 
I hate to love
I hate to love
So I do without and die within
Once we were two it wore too thin
It just wore too thin
I hate to love
It hurts too much
Everytime
The time is up <start> One more time
As we lie by the firelight
Let me hold you
'Til you have to go away
Don't let it end
Let me pretend you'll stay
One more thrill
While we're still in our solitude
One more moment
I can touch you tenderly
Can this be real
Doesn't it feel like a fantasy
When the night moves on
I'm afraid you'll be gone
With no reason or rhyme
So if I borrow
A bit of tomorrow
Is that such a crime
Why can't we make believe
That the evening has just begun
Close your eyes to the rising sun
And hold me one more time
When the night moves on
I'm afraid you'll be gone
With no reason or rhyme
So if I borrow
A bit of tomorrow
Is that such a crime
Why can't we make believe
That the evening has just begun
Close your eyes to the rising sun
And hold me one more time <start> I can't believe that we thought we were through
We said some things and acted like a couple of fools
Let's rekindle the fire while there's still a spark
Let me uncry your tears and you unbreak my heart
I saw you last night with somebody new
I know that you saw me with somebody too
You know neither one of us is happy where we are
Let me uncry your tears and you unbreak my heart
We'll undo all of the damage we have done
Back up and get back to square number one
We need to be together 'cause we're no good apart
Let me uncry your tears and you unbreak my heart
I'll take back I'm leaving and I don't love you
And you'll take back It's over and Honey we're through
We'll both say we're sorry and make a brand new start
Let me uncry your tears and you unbreak my heart <start> New York winter Traffic squeals
The city feels...so old
Late December taxi ride
Then run inside it's cold
Got your letters Monday
I think or Tuesday
I lose track
Since then I've been thinking of you
And I've been looking back to
London
Can you believe it's so many years since
London
Hitching a ride and carrying knapsacks
London
In the park by the Thames Drinking tea
London
Sitting in pubs and living in walkups
London
Learnin' the accent learnin' to love you
London
We were young we were sure
We were... free
Was it really ages
Ago the memories Never fade
Can you hear Big Ben where you are
And are you glad you stayed in
London
Dodging the rain with broken umbrellas
London
Readind the Times on Saturday picnics
London
Counting stars 'till the stars
All were gone
London
So many plans and nothing but time in
London
Nothing to fear 'cause nothing could last in
London
We grew close we grew scared
I moved on
Oh London
What were we scared of
Why did I run from London
Part of me still has
Never come back from London
Is it fair that I miss
You so much
Take good care all my love
Keep in touch
New York winter taxi ride
Then run inside it's cold <start> I only wanted to play
I thought what he didn't know wouldn't hurt him anyway
But he found out and someone else gave him her hand to hold
And suddenly I find myself out in the cold
He trusted me all the time
I thought I could see another man and he would still be mine
Well yesterday I had a good thing worth more than gold
Today he's got a truer love and I'm out in the cold
I had a love warmer than fire
But I listened to my desire
Now yesterday's dreams are tomorrow's heart aches
I'm payin' for my mistakes
Now girl take a tip from one who knows
If you open up a new door you may find the old one's closed
So be true to your good man
Take a lesson from the story I have told
Or you just might geta left now out in the cold
You just might geta left now out in the cold <start> I was born in the wagon of a travelin' show.
Mama used to dance for the money they'd throw
papa would do what ever he could
preach a little gospel
and sell a couple bottles of Doctor Good.
Gypsys
Tramps  thieves.
We'd hear it from the people of the town.
They called us Gypsys
Tramps  Thieves
and ev'ry night all the men would come around
and lay their money down.
We picked up a boy just south of mobile.
We gave him a ride
filled him with a hot meal.
I was sixteen
he was twentyone.
Rode with us to Memphis
and Pa woulda shot him if he knew what he'd done.
Gypsys
Tramps  Thieves...
I was born... <start> Do you have the will to walk on water
Do you have the strength to part the waves
Do you have the lips to kiss a blood red rose
Before the colors start to fade
But are you tough enough to walk through the fire
Are you suss enough to slip the hangman's noose
Wanna ride gonna slide take it over the line
Hit the pin kick it in I'm gonna win again
I don't wanna live forever
I just want a slice of the pie to call my own
I don't wanna live forever
Do you wanna be like I wanna be
Immortal
Do you have the bread to feed the hunger
Do you have to choose to turn water to wine
Do you have the tears to cry me a river
Build a bridge to the other side
But are you holding out for the late edition
Gonna read all about it 'cause it's front page news
So high bone dry got a thirst for life
Kiss the skin drink it in I'm gonna win again
I don't wanna live forever
I just want a slice of the pie to call my own
I don't wanna live forever
Do you wanna be like I wanna be
Immortal
Just like the gates of heaven
There's no way back there's no way back
I'm ten miles high got the keys to the kingdom
I'm back on track got a life and I'm living it
Do you have the to the tell me a secret
Or will I read all about it when
It's front page news
Wanna ride gonna slide
Take it over the line
Hit the pin kick it in
I'm gonna win again
I don't wanna live forever
I just want a slice of the pie to call my own

Read it off one sentence at a time
I'm tired of all the lines
Convictions and your lies
What right do you have to point at me
Well I'm sitting alone thinking about it all over coffee
And still crowdin' my space are the things you still hold against me
You cannot save me
Well it's not the time to breakdown
Well it's not the time to breakdown
Well it's not the time to break up this love
Keep it together now
It's not the time to break
Read it all no need for separating here

All your little lines
Convictions and your lies

Breakdown <start> So I always get nostalgic with that song
But in my room its forced
It has to be in some car across the street
And I always catch the back of your head in the crowd
Don't turn around its never you
And you ruin those memories
And those photos are great
If I catch them with the sun in my eye
But if I stare
Just turns into you and me
We're just standing there
And now its over
Would you hear me
Scream at the top of my lungs
And when you go there
Would you hear me
Scream at the top of my lungs
So I always fool my friends
And we head down there
They think that we are rude
We just drove by your old house
And you weren't there
And I'm always great
When I'm with your buds
And they lie
They think that I'm just fine
Its always been that way
Just a pocketbook brando
And when you hold him
Would you hear me
Scream at the top of my lungs
You love my whisper
But did you hear me
Scream at the top of my lungs
So you crank that song
And it might sound doomed
So just leave the room
While l sit and stare
Cause this is a rare
I really love that tune
Man I love that song
I really love that song
I love that song
So when you go
Would you hear me
Scream at the top of my lungs
And when your hated
Would you hear me
Scream at the top of my lungs
So you crank that song
And it might sound doomed
So just leave the room
While I sit and stare
Cause they that's rare
I really love that tune
Man I love that song
I love that song <start> Culture souvenir shop
Lying on the chopping block
World wide space wide
In a small house wife
Motor bike horse ride
In the general market
Imagination gun is playing on the tv
It's falling away
It's falling away
Sunrise darkness in an empty lunchbox

There's a cold man can you give him a blanket

War isn't everything but complex economics

Underline gender in the new pop culture

It's alright it's alright but it's so long
To pretenders in the new scene
To the falling of your head
Well it's alright well it's alright
But it's so long
Falling so far <start> Help me Satan
The lord has his grip upon me
I have fornicated with loose women
I have drunk myself into a state of inebriation
I have acted criminally upon my fellow man
And I am glad
Satan can I get an amen
Amen
Do not listen to anyone <start> 
I I don't know why
Why you need some reason to feel lost inside
You you know that I'm alright
You know that I'm just the kind of girl that feels so hurt inside
I don't do excuses
I don't ask why
It's just a breakdown
It happens all the time
So get out of my face
Don't even try
Ya want to help me just let me cry
Yeah I loved you all my life
But you don't even know a thing I feel inside
No by the look in my eye
That I'm just fine but I might need you to hold me tight
I don't do excuses
I don't ask why
It's just a breakdown
It happens all the time
So get out of my face
Don't even try
Ya want to help me just let me cry
I don't do excuses

So get out of my face
Don't even try
Ya want to help me just let me cry <start> You never say what you feel
You're like a cog in a wheel.
You better be quiet never rebel or riot.
Could it be that you are free
When their eyes can see
What you're doing all day long
Whistle hum or sing a song.
Don't start to run they've got a gun.
Whatever you say
Whatever you do
Agent X is watching you.
You come home early you come home late
There's only someone who will wait.
Someone knows if you're for or against
What you think and what you say.
They try to look inside your head
You're in a cage until you dead.
You never say what you feel
You're like a cog in a wheel.
Whatever you say
Whatever you do
Agent X is watching you.
Don't be afraid
Try to escape.
Whatever you say
Whatever you do
Agent X is watching you. <start> I feel like a world gone crazed
At the thought of you
Your hot ways still chill
I'm closing in on you
Temptation never leaves me
But leaves me every once and a while
And it's you it's you
That leaves me dry every time
And I only need to take it so far
Before all these tears leave their smears
And the thoughts of you disappear
It's you it's you
That leaves me dry every time
Torch my soul and leave the core
You take it all you take it all
And you can take this and more
Just before you shut the door
All these tears leave their smears
And the thoughts of you disappear
We gotta go down south
Just about as far as you gotta go
Across the border
You know the way it goes <start> They tied me up they stripped me down
Against the world I'll stand my ground
I'll sell my songs but not my soul.
They'll chew you up they'll spit you out
Yeah follow me we'll ride it out
I'll sell my songs but not my soul.
I'll take dignity over industry
My wardrobe has never meant shit to me.
I'll sell my songs but never my soul
And what the fuck happened to rock and roll
I've got bruises on my hands and knees
And a list of failures in between.
Always dirty I am never clean
Music is what you hear and not what you see.
There's something wrong this isn't right
I make the rules or I'm gone tonight
I signed the line but didn't lose control.
They'll tell you lies right to your eyes
Before you know they'll suck you dry
I signed the line but didn't lose control.
We've got families and mouths to feed
I'll take pride over profit
And guts over greed.
I signed the line but didn't lose control
And what the fuck happened to rock and roll
I've got bruises on my hands and knees
And a list of failures in between.
Always dirty I am never clean
Music is what you hear and not what you see.
And if there's one thing left to tell
It's that I am being real.
And you should know yeah you should know
Just how I feel
Oh just how I feel
You should know you should know just how I feel.
I've got bruises on my hands and knees
And a list of failures in between.
Always dirty I am never clean
Music is what you hear and not what you...
I've got bruises on my hands and knees
And a list of failures in between.
Always dirty I am never clean

Is inspired and in dedication to the memory of
General Leon Degrelle a true warrior <start> Got a brand new face
So brittle it falls to pieces
My bones are charred and soon I am ash
And I'm clinging to all my soft wickedness <start> You got your feelings
Your old fashioned feelings
About the world and its ways
No retribution
No simple solution
I think we're caught in a maze
And all the plunder
That feeling down under
It tends to gnaw at you
We're in the grip it's a total Eclipse
The tyre fitter's got you
Now let me explain
This feeling of pain
Comes from the man at the top.
His grip is so tight
His political might
The tyre fitter will not stop
He's bleeding your brain
He'll drive you insane
Nobody making a move
He'll give you a pen
But he's got him a gun
The tyre man is oh so shrewd
I'm licking my wounds
And mending my bones
And catching the wind out of town
We're all in the grip of a tyre fitter's hand
It's only doing me harm
Running away
Just isn't the way
You got to get it yourself
Watch what we do
We just gotta make do
And hide away on the shelf <start> Discontent in this life as is our mechanisms deviate
Rust derided inspires change and leaves behind exhausted dreams ignition engaged
So save your wishes for the sky diluted and disguised as a perfect fuel that won't ignite
But hope will heal us all
Set to action our forward thought
To allocate and stabilize
The truth for so long can only hide
In shadows of our own design amend and revise
A wish will leave you empty handed 
Shun your responsibilities 
A dream alone will bear no seed 
And wishes will leave you dead and buried
Lost and forgotten
With your lives <start> Let me take you on a trip
Around the world and back
And you won't have to move
You just sit still
Now let your mind do the walking
And let my body do the talking
Let me show you the world in my eyes
I'll take you to the highest mountain
To the depths of the deepest sea
We won't need a map believe me
Now let my body do the moving
And let my hands do the soothing
Let me show you the world in my eyes
That's all there is
Nothing more than you can feel now
That's all there is
Let me put you on a ship
On a long long trip
Your lips close to my lips
All the islands in the ocean
All the heaven's in the motion
Let me show you the world in my eyes
That's all there is
Nothing more than you can touch now
That's all there is
Let me show you the world in my eyes <start> Here comes Mr. Misery
He's tearing out his hair again
He's crying over her again
He's standing in the supermarket shouting at the customers
Here comes Mr. Misery
He'll never be any good with a mouth full of gold and blood
He's contemplating murder again
He must be in love
Chorus
But you know she doesn't want you
But you can't seem to get it in your head
Oh and you can't sleep at night
And she haunts you when you go to bed
When you're tired of talking and you can't drink it down
So you hang around and drown instead
Home isn't where it used to be
Home is anywhere you hang your head
You hang your head
Home is anywhere
You hang your head
Home is anywhere
You hang your head
Home is anywhere you hang your head
Here comes Mr. Misery
Looking for a place for his mouth to shoot
Saying You'd look cute in your birthday suit
You tore him out and screwed him up
Like a bad page in a naughty picture book
They day ended as it began
As he was seconds older than the man he was this morning
And the world has wiped it's mouth since then
Or maybe it was yawning
Chorus <start> If I could tell you one thing
Then I'd tell you everything
I'd probably say that you've been on my mind
Since we held hands out in the rain
Smoking cigarettes to play
Off all the butterflies I had inside
And now I think that you should know
That you've got everything
That I've wanted for so damn long
And that I wouldn't hesitate to trade away everything
If you tell me that I'm not wrong
So know I think that you should know
That I've been waiting for you
Since we sat underneath the stars
As I held you in my arms
Killing just another summer night
It's funny how the best things happen sometimes
And how I'll always remember those endless nights
But don't forget I regret the fact that I have to leave you
Right as the best part starts
So I thought I'd take the time to say <start> If she wants to dance and drink all night
Well there's no one that can stop her
She's going till the house lights come up or her stomach spills onto the floor
This night is gonna end when we're damn well ready for it to be over
Worked all week long now the music is playing on our time
Yeah we do what we do to get by and then we need a release
You get mixed up with the wrong guys
You get messed up on the wrong drugs
Sometimes the party takes you places that you didn't really plan on going
When people see the track marks on her arm she knows what they're thinking
She keeps on working for that minimum
As if a high school education gave you any other options you know
They don't know nothing about redemption
They don't know nothing about recovery
Some people just aren't the type for marriage and family
No mother ever dreams that her daughter's gonna grow up to be a junkie
No mother ever dreams that her daughter's gonna grow up to sleep alone
No mother ever dreams that her daughter's gonna grow up to be a junkie
No mother ever dreams that her daughter's gonna grow up to sleep alone
She's out of step with the style
She don't know where the action's happening
You know the downtown club scene ain't nothing like it used to be
You reach a point where there's not a lie in the world
That you could use to make the boys believe you're still in your twenties
But they keep getting younger don't they baby
She's not waiting for someone to come over and ask for the privilege
She can still here that rebel yell just as loud as it was in  you know
There ain't no Johnny coming home to share a bed with her and she doesn't care
No mother ever dreams that her daughter's gonna grow up to be a junkie
No mother ever dreams that her daughter's gonna grow up to sleep alone
No mother ever dreams that her daughter's gonna grow up to be a junkie
No mother ever dreams that her daughter's gonna grow up to sleep alone
No mother ever dreams that her daughter's gonna grow up to be a junkie
And if she had to live it all over again you know she wouldn't change anything for the world <start> Come with me
And we shall run across the sky
And illuminate the night
Oh I will try and guide you
To better times and brighter days.
Don't be afraid
Go up the ladder to the roof where we can see heaven much better.
Go up the ladder to the roof where we can be oh closer to heaven.
Stay with me
And we shall let expressions sing
Hear freedom virtues ringing
Oh memories of yesterdays broken dreams
Don't you know they'll all fade away
If you'll come
up the ladder to the roof where we can see heaven much better.
Go up the ladder to the roof where we can be oh closer to heaven.
We'll laugh and I'll tell you the story of love
 and the happiness in it baby
We'll combine our thoughts and together we'll travel
to the fountain of loveliness.
I will never ever ever leave you alone to wonder
As we go on
Our love it will grow much stronger stronger.
Don't you wanna
Go up the ladder to the roof where we can see heaven much better.
Go up the ladder to the roof where we can be oh closer to heaven. <start> Area life concrete mission with a black light

Area life cultural etiquette that bites back
Do what you're told weapon traffic without warning
Do what you're told execution with a cause
Uncontrolling yourself only seconds to spare

Dear uncle Sam you got a lot to do
But I just want to have a little talk with you
You probably don't remember even who I am
But I build your cars and I till your land
While you're busy giving out all that cash
While your politicians talk all that trash
While you're busy cleaning up your own mess
Maybe you could honor my small request
Take off the tax on a cold six pack
Add another day to make the weekend last
Get your head out uncle Sam somebody needs a hand
Toss a little bone to the working man
Toss a little bone to the working man
Make it a law that we all get a raise
And prices go a little lower every day
Where pretty women can't judge a man by his car
And if you keep your nose clean then you'll always go far
I build your bridges and I carry your loads
I move the big rigs over your roads
Hate to spend my money like I got it to burn
Seems like I ought to get a little return

... <start> Foolish people everywhere
They're thinking that somebody else can
They say do your thing boy they don't lie
Cause they don't care if you live or die
It's a plastic world coming down around me
People melting everywhere
Just a plastic world coming down around me
Nobody seem to care no no no
This place is really such a drag
With all you hippies in the same old bags
You preach love and peace all the time
But you're so stoned you don't know you're alive
It's a plastic world coming down around me
People melting everywhere
Just a plastic world coming down around me
Nobody seem to care no
So you say you love me is that what you said
Is that coming from your heart and not just your head
Cause i know I know you're just like the rest
Cause you love yourself yourself the best
It's a plastic world coming down around me
People melting everywhere
Just a plastic world coming down around me
Nobody seem to care no <start> You are sultry dirty soft and hard
You are close to me and youre so far
And Im thinking of the time we spent together
Now Ill bury this in my backyard
Sometimes I sit and wonder
But Ill never dial your number
'Cause Im having fun looking out for number one
And Im doing all the things I like to do
Im having fun 'cause I knew it all along
Id be better off without you
You are guilty pretty high and low
Youre a place to stay and a time to go
And Im searching through the things you left behind here
But its time for me to let it go
Sometimes I sit and wonder
But Ill never dial that number
'Cause Im having fun looking out for number one
And Im doing all the things I like to do
Im having fun 'cause I knew it all along
Id be better off without you better off without you
Late at night you pick up the telephone
Call me up and cry 'cause youre all alone I dont care
Apologize for taking my cigarettes
Now its time to feel all the side effects
Missing the life you had
Now Im having fun looking out for number one
And Im doing all the things I like to do
Im having fun 'cause I knew it all along
Id be better off without you better off without you
Better off without you <start> I am believing
Their hearts are gold
The lion paws his own teeth now
So you you can love him now
I am believing
What if it were all a dream
What if we were demigods
They'd take to our knee
Raging at the half of our sins
I am believing
Their hearts are gold
The lion paws his own teeth now
So you can love him now
I am believing
Their hearts are gold
So go and pick your poison
Before I pick it for you yeah <start> I guess I thought you'd be here forever
Another illusion I chose to create
You don't know what you got until it's gone
And I found out a little too late
I was acting as if you were lucky to have me
Doin' you a favor I hardly knew you were there
But then you were gone and it all was wrong
Had no idea how much I cared
Now being without you takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it but I don't want to
Being without you is all a big mistake
Instead of getting easier it's the hardest thing to take
I'm addicted to you babe you're a hard habit to break
You found someone else you had every reason
You know I can't blame you for runnin' to him
Two people together but livin' alone
I was spreading my love too thin
After all of these years I'm still tryin' to shake it
Doin' much better they say that it just takes time
But deep in the night it's an endless fight
I can't get you out of my mind
Now being without you takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it but I don't want to
Being without you is all a big mistake
Instead of getting any easier it's the hardest thing to take
I'm addicted to you babe you're a hard habit to break
Can't go on just can't go on on
Can't go on just can't go on on
Now being without you takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it but I don't want to
Being without you is all a big mistake
Instead of getting any easier it's the hardest thing to take
I'm addicted to you
You're a hard habit to break  
Such a hard habit to break  
I'm addicted to you
You're a hard habit to break  
Such a hard habit to break  
I'm addicted to you baby <start> Some lie about who they love
Some lie about the truth
Some lie to save their lives
Some lie about their youth
Some lie about age and beauty
The conquest of sex
Most lie about the night before
A woman lies for a party dress
I've lied for a stolen moment
I've lied for one more clue
I've lied about most everything
But I never lied to you
And we lie lie lie on a streetcar named desire
Oh we lie lie lie for that sweet bird of youth
I could be great like Tennessee Williams
If I could only hear something that sounds like the truth
Some lie in the face of death
Some lie about their fame
Some kneel and lie to God
Some lie about their name
Some lie in words and speeches
With every living breath
The young lie with their guitars
The old lie for a little respect
I've lied to lie with danger
I've lied for a drug or two
I've lied about most everything
But I never lied to you
And we lie lie lie on a streetcar named desire
Oh we lie lie lie for that sweet bird of youth

Lazy Saturday like a kitten in the sunshine warm as Arkansas
I wash your tires with rose water after the mud bog I bathe you in my love
And you are my entity you are my dream
Yeah you're my dream
Remember the first time I met you I spilt apple juice all over you and you were all wet and
Sticky.
Then I took you and I rolled you through the forest through the mud and leaves
And tied you to a tree and you liked it
Next time I met you I sat on you and rolled and rolled and rolled and rolled and rolled
Back to the forest in the mud in the leaves
And I tied you to that same tree 'cause you liked it in my dream <start> Si te vas no hay oxgeno

I will wait for your sun to shine
Now you've got me goin'
Somewhere no one could find
All in my life
It's the world that makes me cry
Oh summer day
Go back home give your body away
Milky arms and legs
Wrap around this neglected frame
And the world will make you cry
Yeah the world won't tell you why
But this world won't make you die
'Cause I loved you right
Oh gypsy rose
You got me swallowed up in your streets
Bring your food money shoes
Just to lie here with you beneath your sheets
I see hope in your eyes
It's the world that makes you cry
Rose I got no friends
I got no kids and I don't got kin
My one salvation
Is the warmth of your skin
And this world will make you cry
Yeah the world will make you lie
Oh the world will suck you dry
Oh but I love you right
Oh summer day
Go back home give your body away
And when I wake
You'll have saved my life <start> Tear me apart to gain control
You know I have two faces
You can choose the one you want
Oh I know I climb too high
I want to see the sun
Drown in my world
Drown in my world
Drown in my world
Drown in my world
Drown in my world
All those ghosts we thought were gone
They all came back to stay
To stay for evermore
Oh I know I fly too close
I want to feel the flame
Drown in my world
Drown in my world
Drown in my world
Drown in my world
Drown in my world
Oh I know I fly too close
I want to feel the flame
Drown in my world
Drown in my world
Drown in my world
Drown in my world
Drown in my world <start> You walk in and I can hear the whisper
As a hush fills the crowded room
You stand there looking just like heaven
Lord I've never seen the likes of you
From the doorway your eyes search every table
As every man turns to look at you
Ah you're special and anyone can see it
You know I've never seen the likes of you
And then I catch your eye from across the room
And you smile back at me as I walk up to you
I say Hello there and put my arms around you
As I remember the day I married you
And now three kids later you're more beautiful than ever
And babe I've never seen the likes of you <start> Schne Gre nach Dsseldorf und Berlin
Wir ham lange berlegt ob wir reagiern
sollen wir schweigen sollen wir euch ignoriern
Doch da wir sowieso dabei sind uns mit allen anzulegen
kommt das was wir von euch hren grade gelegen.
Ihr wart immer schon kacke schon immer zu weich
und eure Pseudomoral erkannten wir gleich.
Ihr spuckt ganz schn groe Tne knnt ihr euch das leisten
Was wollt ihr damit bezwecken was beweisen
Refrain
Opium frs Volk Scheie fr die Massen
Ja ihr habt es geschafft ich beginne euch zu hassen
Wenn ich so etwas sage ist es nicht gelogen
ihr sollt den Tag nicht vor dem Abend loben
Ich dachte erst noch 'leckt mich' doch ihr habt es bertrieben
ihr habt zu viel geredet beschissene Lieder geschrieben
Wer nicht hren will muss fhlen
ihr habt zu lange provoziert
zu viel Scheie erzhlt und nichts kapiert.
Legt euch nicht mit uns an denn wir fhren wahren Krieg
gegen Lgen und Dummheit und das macht uns nicht beliebt.
Doch im Gegensatz zu euch kann uns nichts passieren
denn wer keine Sympathie hat kann sie auch nicht verlieren.
Refrain
Ganz anders als ihr sind wir Stress gewohnt
wir suhlen uns darin nur so fhlen wir uns wohl.
Genug geredet nur eins will ich euch noch sagen
Wenn ihr wenn ihr rger wollt den knnt ihr haben <start> As the midnight moon was driftin' through
The lazy sway of the trees
I saw the look in your eyes looking into the night
Not seeing what you wanted to see
Darlin' don't say a word I've already heard
What your body's sayin' to mine you're tired of fast moves
You've got a slow groove on your mind
You want a man with a slow hand
You want a lover with an easy touch
You want somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush baby believe me I understand
When it comes to love you want a slow hand
On shadowed ground with no one around
And a blanket of stars in our eyes
Hey we're drifting free like two lost leaves
On the crazy wind of the night
Darlin' don't say a word I've already heard
What your body's sayin' to mine if you want all night
You know it's alright I've got time
You've got a man with a slow hand
You've got a lover with an easy touch
You've got somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush baby believe me I understand
When it comes to love you want a slow hand
You want a lover with an easy touch
You've got somebody who will spend some time with you baby
Not come and go in a heated rush baby believe me I understand <start> and i'm here and i'm special and i'm the one who turns you out. and i'm here and i'm a wreck for the total loss of our last crash. you are the savior you are the woman bleeding me. you're the stigmata that i starve for and i pray the lord i keep the sign that keeps reminding me. and i move too close when heat embodies me. and i stop to call beating hearts i ring. and i assume too much like breathing when i sleep. may not be innocent may not carry you on the way. may not be innocent you'll walk the miracle mile with me. and i soothe the warmth that keeps in time with me and i assume you know it keeps time with me. and we consumer it all and breed like gods last men and i assume you know i'll see you when i wake. and i see the right direction got miles to go with miles to go with miles around. and i see the time is right for the time is yours the time is now. <start> I want you to stop right there baby
Baby and try to understand
Hey I might have been your fool for a while baby
But I know I'm a good loving man
And you shouldn't lie to me baby
Makes me mad as a man can be
I know when you got home last night
Your kissing me was your plan
I know you were just faking me baby
'Cause you'd been out with your other man
And you shouldn't lie to me baby
Makes me mad as a man can be
Hey I can't quit you baby
'Cause you're honey but the bees don't know <start> Standing in the darkness
Waiting for the light
The smell of pure adrenaline
Burning in the night
Random blinding flashes
Aiming at the stage
Intro tape begins to roll
Igniting sonic rage
Still they keep me between these hollow walls
Hoping to find in me
The answers to the test that stumped them all
The boy is just simply crazy
Suffering from delusions
We honestly think that maybe
He might need an institution
He lives in a world of fiction
And really could use some help
We have just the place to fix him
To save him from himself
Curled up in the darkness
Searching of the light
The smell of sweat and shit
Steaming through the night
Random urine testing
Pills red pink and blue
Counseling and therapy
Providing not a clue
Still they keep me between these hollow walls
Hoping to find in me
The answers to the test that stumped them all
We can't seem to find the answers
He seemed such a clear cut case
We cannot just let him leave here
And put all this work to waste
Why don't we try shock treatment
It really might do some help
We have just the tools to fix him
To save him from himself <start> Caught up in silence
Denying your conscience
Afraid to give up yourself
You live in your own world
Keeping your distance
We all have a story to tell
Maybe it's time you give it to me
Chorus
You've got something inside
What ya tryin' to hide
Let me in your isolation
You've got something to show
Close your eyes and let go
Let me in your fascination
The reason you're faking
The road that you're taking
You swore you'd never go down again
If there's no one to trust in
Then all is for nothing
Can you live with that 'til the end
Maybe it's time I give up on you
Chorus
I have tried so long to make you feel like you have a home
But I want you to know that you don't have to go through this alone
Open your soul you need to let go
I only wanna show you what you've never known
Chorus <start> I'm dancing round and round
Acting just like a a clown
I know I'll never be free
I'm just a puppet on a string
I've lost my pride and everything
It began on the day we met
She'd kiss me once and I was lost
She thrills me now I'll pay the cost
Dancing the Nancy's Minuet
I'm dancing round and round
Acting just like a a clown
I know I'll never be free
The music's deep within my heart
She looks at me and the dancin' starts
I'm just a foolish marionette
I'll never break a single string
To stay with her means everything
Dancing the Nancy's Minuet <start> Ordinary
ways to go.
Drop my head
that's all I know.
Empty's all I seem to say.
What's come over me
Lost that bravery
locked in without a key.
To smile again would feel so good.
Caught up in every minute
bored within it
Can't I just breathe
Can't I just breathe
Can't I just breathe
Scared behind a cheerful smile.
Broken by lust I'm here for my trial.
Where's the strength you stole from me
Take my dignity.
Go on laugh at me.
Where's your sympathy
To smile again would feel so good.
Caught up in every minute
bored within it
Can't I just breathe
Can't I Just breathe
Can't I just breathe
To smile again would feel so good... <start> lucy's hiding
i was a teenage werewolf taken
taken by your scene
lucy's hiding
don't be afraid of what you are
if it was only a dream
and if i fall fall down
and if i sound a little too proud
decision's made are you coming around
it's difficult times i've found
lucy's frightened
i was a teenage werewolf taken
taken by your scene
lucy's fighting
open a vein and paralysed
but it was only a dream
and if i fall fall down
and if i sound a little too proud
decision's made are you coming around
it's difficult times i've found
i've found <start> Even when I think she is hiding from me
Even when it's so hard for me to brake the ice
I can see there's something in her eyes
Something missing in her smile
Even when she's hiding from me
I'm gonna find the way x
To her Elena don't worry
Someone will help you to forget
Don't you worry Elena
No Elena
You have to have that all inside your heart
And I'll help you find it
I'll help you find it x
Matching perfectly the weather
She wears gray and black as winter
Showing very little care
For all those who'd die for her
Bearing gray as past as winter
But I'm gonna find the way <start> What a wonderful hesitation
Who would bear to feel sorry for me
Dropped another pill just to calm me
Collapsed to my knees and fell fast into sleep
There I was drifting
Way out into the sunshine
Expecting to crash but I'm tied to a string
Look at me I'm a tangled puppet
I might be a mess but I'm sure can survive
Find myself awake counting sad days
One two three that's too many for me
Dropped another pill just to find me
Reached for my hand but it was already there
Then I started believin'
That I fell out of a tiny raindrop
That lost its way when I decided to roam
Chasing me was a hungry dweller
But I had escaped it by pretending to die
Come follow me you won't expect the illusion
You'll see it's my imagination
Hand me your eyes
I will put them in front of mine
You'll see a little better
You'll see a little better
What a wonderful destination
Where I am now
I can no longer see
Dropped another pill just to kill me
Collapsed to my knees and fell fast into sleep
There I was drifting
Way out into the sunshine
Expecting to crash but I'm tied to a string
Look at me I'm a tangled puppet
I might be a mess but I'm sure can survive
But I had escaped it by pretending to die <start> I cannot focus here I cannot find my way
My mind is blurred by all the things that people say
I dream of bliss I dream of heaven here on earth
Won't you please set me free
Cause I need love and I need light I need to keep my faith in sight
But what I need seems so far away
Cause I need you here cause I need to breath your air
But what I need seems so far away
Another night another day a brand new way
Just open up my heart and give me words to say
I wasted so much time hiding from the truth
Won't you please set me free
Cause I need love and I need light I need to keep my faith in sight
But what I need seems so far away
Cause I need you here cause I need to breath your air
But what I need seems so far away
Well I'm on my knees again... in the middle of the road
I've waited for days and nights alone
I won't let you down again
No time's not on my side
I'm trying my best just to stay alive
I need a year a month a minute of your time
I need to sink into your infinite sunrise
I need to know the universe was made for me
Won't you please set me free
Cause I need love and I need light I need to keep my faith in sight
What I need seems so far away
Cause I need you here cause I need to breathe your air
But what I need seems so far away <start> He don't leave when it's time to go.
He don't leave at the end of the show.
He's no friend an acquaintance at best.
A scary guy in a leather vest.
Cause he's a nuisance. 
Nuisance 
Nuisance 
Nuisance
When he speaks it's a scary sound.
It's hard to keep him from hanging around.
Girls won't give him the time of day.
They just hope he'll go away.
Cause he's a nuisance. 
Nuisance 
Nuisance

Why won't he go away.
Why does he always stay.
Cause he's a nuisance. 
Nuisance 
Nuisance 
Nuisance
I wish he would move to another place.
Or at least get out of my face.
It seems that there is nothing left to do.
I wish he would just get a clue.
Cause he's a nuisance. 
Nuisance

Nuisance
Why won't he go away.
Why does he always stay.
Cause he's a nuisance.

Nuisance <start> One word one heart
One night is all I want
One word one heart
One girl is waiting there for me
Midnight and all is well
I hear the mission bell
Out on the road nothing is moving
As I speed from town to town

Two hearts are beating fast
But they are still many miles apart
Oh the mood was shining on a distant shore
Burning like a fire in my heart
I've got to see her I've got to say hey hey
One word one heart
One night is all I want
One word one heart
One girl is waiting there for me
I never knew I cared so much before
I've got to tell her tonight

I'm gonna to tell her tonight

I've got to tell her tonight

Like a cannonball
Headlights are blazing through
Turn on the radio I hear the news
Hand on the wheel foot on the floor
And on and on and on we go

This car is like a friend
Bring her the message that I want to send
Oh the dawn was breaking and I saw the sun
Burning like a fire on the bay
I'm nearly there now I'm gonna say hey hey
One word one heart
One night is all I want
One word one heart
One girl is waiting there for me
I never knew I cared so much before
I've got to tell her tonight

I'm gonna to tell her tonight

I've got to tell her tonight

Like a cannonball
One word

One heart
One night

One girl

I've got to tell her tonight

I've got to tell her tonight

I've got to give her my love

I've got to give her my love

I've got to tell her myself

I've got to tell her tonight

Like a cannonball
Yes <start> Two feet have I
Pillars of putrid meat
Standing so tall among my
Icons of filth
With gargoyle eyes
I see
The Christ he's smiling at me
His phosphorous grin
An absolution for all my sins
And in this room
The walls covered with flies
I'm seen through their myriad eyes
The alien eyes
I'm seen somewhere else
Seen through the windows of Hell
Few million light years from home
I am searching for a different kind of
Insanity
The Babylon astronaut
Could you leave it all behind

I see the stars painted on the window's glass
Seven planets supporting the nothingness
And I am happy
Nothing more nothing less

Something came to my room
As flies on the ceiling
Coming down on me
One by one
And their hairy limbs
Crawling on my naked skin
The motherfuckers screwing on me
Insect sex
No
I won't move
As my ears are laden with eggs
Close my eyes
And dream of being back in the womb
Under the juniper trees
Talking cats and silver boots filled with
Blood
Could you leave it all behind
Under another sun I'll grow saturnine
Lay siege to heaven in fever dreams
And I smash my head
Into the window's glass
And see the stars coming down at last <start> My feelings are a work of art
A picture frame around my heart
Sometimes it falls right off the wall
But I'm not damaged goods
I'm priceless understood
I'm one of a kind
You won't give up on me
I know You won't give up on me
It's plain to see that
We are one big family
And when I'm on my own
I'm out my comfort zone
My comfort zone
I feel like it's my destiny
To show the world Your love
You always see the best in me
So I'll give You all my love
Push and pull and compromise
I try to improvise
You know I've been through this before
Yeah we go back a ways
Let's turn a brand new page
Oh it's time for me to change
You won't give up on me
I know You won't give up on me
It's plain to see that
We are one big family
And when I'm on my own
I'm out my comfort zone
My comfort zone
I feel like it's my destiny
To show the world Your love
You always see the best in me
So I'll give You all my love
I feel like it's my destiny
To show the world Your love
I feel like it's my destiny
To show the world Your love
You always see the best in me
So I'll give You all my love <start> On a day like this the feelings are so strong
Blinded by the dream it's hard for us to see
Will we count the cost of always wanting more
Never satisfied with what we had before
Don't let it bring you down
There's no need to hide
From feeling inside
You've got to hold on
And if you're on your own
And the walls are closing
Remember the love
You've got to hold on
Deep inside ourselves we always feel the truth
That if we learn to give we could learn to live
This could be our fade creating something new
Just give up all the past and all that you knew
Don't let it bring you down
There's no need to hide
From feeling inside
You've got to hold on
And if you're on your own
And the walls are closing
Remember the love
You've got to hold on
You've got to hold
Everybody needs someone
Gotta be a place we belong
Everybody needs something
All you need is to believe
Everybody needs someone
Gotta be a place we belong
Everybody needs something
All you need is to believe
Don't let it bring you down
There's no need to hide
From feeling inside
You've got to hold on
Don't let it bring you down
There's no need to hide
From feeling inside
You've got to hold on
And if you're on your own
And the walls are closing
Remember the love
You've got to hold on
And if you're on your own
Don't let it bring you down
You've got to hold on <start> I know this bar
With a jukebox full of medicine
And Christmas lights blinking
Around a clouded mirror
It's not that far
From old voelkers bowling alley
Just go up there and turn right
It's about four blocks from here
You'll probably find grace
Her shift starts at happy hour
She's got this sweet face
Easy as tea leaves to read
You gotta know what to look for
You gotta know what's there to find
But then I guess you don't really know her
So nevermind
I used to hang out a lot around there
In that part of town
Where all the white kids
Still have feathered hair
I know this song
With this one really killer line
I don't remember it exactly
But it slays me everytime
It's on the jukebox there
I know it's number 
Go put that song on for me won't you
And make gracie think of me <start> Now it could be a spoonful of diamonds
Could be a spoonful of gold
Just want a spoon of your precious love
Satisfy my soul
I'm just wild about it crazy about it
Everybody's talking about
Well that spoon that spoon that
Well that spoon that spoon that
Now it could be spoonful of coffee
Could be spoonful of tea
Just want a spoon of your precious love
That's good enough for me
I'm just wild about it crazy about it
Everybody's talking about
Well that spoon that spoon that
Well that spoon that spoon that
Now it could be a spoonful of water
Shade from the desert sand
Just one spoon of my good good love
Will save you from another man
I'm just wild about it crazy about it
Everybody's talking about
Well that spoon that spoon that
Well that spoon that spoon that <start> The room is dark it's quiet peaceful like a wasteland forest say
A bloodred light shines on the walls of your apartment
As you step into the room
And you can't hear the sound of laughing from your friends
Downstairs cause then you'd bother all too much
When you're sitting down you hear a knocking on your door
And Anemone comes in
She tells you once again to reflect over your heart and feelings
Well here you go again
Losing all support the devil's wisdom comes and
Turns your heart to stone so cold...
And you know It doesn't have to be
So unfortunately It's just that
You don't have to be So unfortuned Nataly
Anemone is asking questions to the viper in your mind
She puts her arms around you Death is all too near
Suddenly the picture is changing
Feel like going somewhere else
The need of strangers comfort will push away your fear
Don't you think that someone knows and do you think
That noone ever cares
Once more the room is quiet The black dress lies
On the floor Anemone puts on her veil and walks gently
To the door
You lie in silence upon the bed You see her
Shining light and you know
You will close the door behind
You scream out loud You feel the pain is fading out
And once again the room is dark
And you know it doesn't have to be
So unfortunately
And you don't have to be So unfortuned Nataly

In a darkened room
Just to gather folks opinions
Can you stand the heat
Can you wrong the rights
And I love you thanks a million
And if there's a god
Let him strike you down
Knowing that you can't deliver
But you held me up
And you hung me out
And we're waiting still for you to bring
Light to a darkened room
But I know you will
It'll make my day
When I see your face
On a dollar bill
And they counted you out
Then they counted you in
And they're counting still
And for all the lies you're about to tell
May the lord make us
Truly thankful
In a two horse race
If you bet each way
Could you maybe stay the distance
And if I should hide
From your puppeteers
Will they make me look ridiculous
Did you like the game
Can you take the blame
After all the dust has settled
Did you ever hope
For a hopeless world
Hungry for the time that you'd bring a
Light to a darkened room
But I know you will
It'll make my day
When I see your face
On a dollar bill
And they counted you out
Then they counted you in
And they're counting still
And for all the lies you're about to tell
May the lord make us
Truly thankful
We could talk all night
Never touch the side
But I don't mean to demean you
Ever felt the cold
When you saw the light
Did the mirror show that dream of you
All the endless miles
And the babies smiles
While the mothers pledge allegiance
To uphold the wrong
To opress the right
Ready to sign up when you bring the
Light to a darkened room
But I know you will
It'll make my day
When I see your face
On a dollar bill
They counted you out
Then they counted you in
And they're counting still
And for all the lies you're about to tell
May the lord make us
Truly thankful <start> The cold reality of this
Is the safety bar just slipped
But still we held on
While the panic settled in
You've got your demons
You've got your daggers
I've got a feeling
It doesn't matter 
We both know how this goes
Up and down again
Like a rollercoaster
I would love to show you
Not all hope is lost
I can see where you call the end
Over and over
Cause the best part of me
Is when you get off
I sold my soul to write this rhyme
In a frantic state of mind
Took you for granted
Left you on the sidelines
I'm not a saint
You're not either
You're the pain
You're the fever 
We both know how this goes
Up and down again
Like a rollercoaster
I would love to show you
Not all hope is lost
I can see where you call the end
Over and over
Cause the best part of me
Is when you get off
It's not what we pictured
Not what we planned
There weren't no exceptions
So lets start it over
I can't protect you
If you're jumping ship
But we were perfection
Lets start all over again
Lets start all over again
Up and down again
Like a rollercoaster
I would love to show you
Not all hope is lost
I can see where you call the end
Over and over
Cause the best part of me
Is when you get off
You're the best part of me <start> You said it youself  you can't help but flirt and I'd be the first to admit that I'm easily hurt. I can't take things lightly  you said I'm always in a huff. I know it was just the once but what if that's enough Just shut the fuck up and tell me bit by bit Cause all I can see is his hand grabbing a tit. I do one four seven one the minute I get in And if your number's not there you stuff stays in the bin. <start> You you wear me out
'Cause you're the fix that I can't learn to live without
I love how you string me along
You're the score and I want more each time we go on
Your lips they poison my veins
And your hips always calling my name
Look at what you did to me
Uh uh oh

Greenfields

Once there were greenfields...kissed by the sun
Once there were valleys...where rivers used to run
Once there were blue skies with white clouds high above
Once they were part of an everlasting hope
We were the lovers who strolled through greenfields
Greenfields are gone now...parched by the sun
Gone from the valleys...where rivers used to run
Gone with the cold wind that swept through to my heart
Gone with the lovers who let the dreams depart
Where are the greenfields where we...used to roam
I'll never know what made you run away
How can I keep searching when dark clouds hide the day
I only know there's nothing here for me
Nothing is now left for me to say
But I keep on waiting...until you return
I keep on waiting until the day you learn
You can't be happy when your heart's on the roam
You can't be happy until you bring it home
Home to the greenfields...and bleed once again

Winnie May sits in her rockin' chair
Well she dreams of me while she combs her hair
She's on her front porch and I'm on mine
She's got a big ol' bud and a jug o' moonshine
I love hot hot women
And I love cold beer
I like hot hot women and cold cold beer
I love red hot women and ice cold beer
Yeeoh
One day is bad the next is worse
The Devil gave me an awful curse
He makes me crave women I can't get
So I sleep all day wake up and fret
But I love hot women And I love cold beer
I like hot hot women and cold cold beer
I love red hot women and ice cold beer
Yeeohoooh
It's nights like this that I can't breathe
Lord I can't sleep and I can't read
So I sit on the porch and dream of a dream And then the girl next door she's lettin' off steam
She's not too skinny but she is too fat
She's a real hum dinger I don't like 'em like that
She's got a upturned nose and a piggys' ear
But her daddy's got a fridge full o' nice cold beer
And I love hot women
And I love cold beer
Well I love hot women
And I love cold beer
I love hot hot women and cold cold beer
I love red hot women and ice cold beer <start> I want it all I need to see
My own eventuality
I heard the call I need to be
All that's expected out of me
That reminds me
I can't stay
I take the fall I start to bleed
I learn to recognize me greed
I need to see my stark reality
My always present entity
That reminds me
I can't stay
Because I'm home

Walls peeling around me
Crumbling falling
Can't hold them up
Walls peeling around me

Can't hold them up to Your light

When you're powerless and pained
And shalom's far away
See the mighty walls will tremble
With nothing left to keep this front alive
Held up to the light

Forgotten like some used to be remembered like a song
Where all the words are so easy to recall
Hmm this old hat
It's seen day fade to night in an open sky
Beneath the fury of the heavens
Kept the rain out of my eyes
Yet somehow don't look as weathered as I
Hmm this old hat
This old hat's been down some dusty trails
And may not look as good as it did new
The crown is stained the brim is torn
It's even been walked on a time or two
This old hat's just like an old friend
Misplaced from time to time but it still fits
They don't make 'em like they used to
There was a time this old hat was in style
But it was different then
It turned a few heads for awhile
But what the hell I might try it on again
Hmm this old hat
This old hat's been down some dusty trails
And may not look as good as it did new
Crown is stained the brim is torn
It's even been walked on a time or two
This old hat's just like an old friend
Misplaced from time to time but it still fits
They don't make 'em like they used to
This old hat's hung on the bedpost way too long <start> Take away...
You take away what you have made.
I don't know you.
I don't know why you've betrayed.
I don't know you anyway.
I don't know you anyway.
Hand me something I can hold on to
That is something I don't have from you.
Hand me something
I can hold on to right now.
I don't need this.
I don't need the run around.
I don't need this anyway.
I don't need this anyway.
Hand me something I can hold on to
That is something I don't have from you.
You can't feel me.
You can block away my life.
This is madness.
This is poverty and strife.
You don't love me anyway.
You don't love me anyway.
Hand me something I can hold on to
That is something I don't have from you. <start> Volcano pierce the air ashes block out the sun.
Down in the lair well I met her there
With a price for everyone.
I paid eighty dollars for this wedding ring
I couldn't take it off if I tried.
And the cactus sure tastes strangely sweet
As it goes down inside
I dream I'm safe in my hotel womb.
Soft and soul made it's a wonderful room.
I wish I'm back in my hotel womb.
Slip through the crack to that wonderful room.
Sudden voltage in the night with a rainforest girl.
As we float downstream to the Amazon River
Where the black waters swirl.
I say why are you people wearing those masks
I say can we be reconciled
She says the mother of the storm has to roam the sky
Searching for her child. 
Morning comes at last and she's lying by my side.
She's got the face of the widow who keeps following me
And the body of my bride.
I say why are those buildings swaying like trees
I say can we stop for a while
She says can't you hear the city that's hidden in there
It's just another mile.  <start> Dzi zadzwoni do mnie kumpel

Leave me be
Left as though I can see through the
mindsided it shivers with joy
I have overcome you
I have overcome you
Thanks for nothing
I have waited
Comfort is arriving now
Thanks for nothing
I have waited
Comfort is arriving now
Thanks for nothing
I have waited
Comfort is arriving
What a beautiful sight unseen
Never felt the welcomed surprises
Breathe new air and pull away
Far from you
If you even apologize
it's pointless if you ask me
I am one with myself
I am one with myself
Thanks for nothing
I have waited
Comfort is arriving now
Thanks for nothing
I have waited
Comfort is arriving now
Thanks for nothing
I have waited
Comfort is arriving
Thanks for nothing
I have waited
Comfort is arriving now
Thanks for nothing
I have waited
Comfort is arriving now

Comfort is arriving now <start> Don't attempt to explain this incredible strain
now confusion's become far too simple a word for it
is what you make
that's the usual mistake
if you're happy with pain you can take it from me
that they're all out to get you
they're painting your life in a permanent grey
they're all out to get you
it takes more than tears to get rid of the stains
sometimes
you're scared you might slip when you're holding a knife
lose your fingers or more in a lathe on the nightshift
you're scared that your babies
get born with no legs
you're so scared of death
you don't know what life is
so they're. . .
all out to get you all over nothing
they're painting your life in a permanent way
they're all out to get you but all out forgetting
it takes more than tears to get rid of the stains sometimes
until you accept that you're just like the others
you're a boy or a girl
then a man or a woman
and your clothes never fit
and your skin's the wrong colour
so you make do with fear
you get more than you need.
yes they're all out to get you all over nothing
they're painting your life in a permanent grey
they're all out to get you but all out for getting
it takes more than tears to get rid of the stains
sometimes
it takes more than tears
it takes more than tears
it takes more than tears
to get rid of the stains. <start> You aint alone so why you lonely

Cause i'm scared the bomb gonna take me away...

or are you scared out on your own two feet
We really aint that different you and me.

That all I ever do is stand and stare
But if you'd seen what I have seen
Maybe then you'd feel the same
I can't explain
That's why I'm looking for another sign
Was she for real or only in my mind
All I saw was just a face
It's been haunting me for days
There's no escape from her
She could be the one
Can't deny I lost her
Must be too far gone
'Cause I can't forget her face
There's no trace
I never thought there would be days like these
It could be just because I'm hard to please
It's not that no one else will do
It's not their fault they're just not you
What can I do about it
You could be the one
Can't believe I lost you
Must be so far gone
Imagining I with you
You could be the one
But there's nothing I could do
I can't find you
This ain't no story
This is not a movie
Playing on a street in black and white
This ain't no love song
You wouldn't hear my crying
All I've got is a face without a name
You could be the one
Can't deny I've lost you
Most be so far gone
Imagining I'm with you
You could be the one
I can live without you
You could be the one
There's nothing I can do
Where are you <start> Two for one five for four half ounces

Big up to all the hands with the fat blunt sack
Chill with indica and Guinness steer clear of white powder
Check and you sit in innerspace contemplating outer
Raid my brain with no cocaine
I don't wanna I don't wanna go insane
Roll up the bones and feel the effects of Mota smoke
I'm smoking the doobs in the morning wake and bake gettin lifted
I get up to the sun and then I smoke down
It's beginning to smell like Mota
And I'm high with no doubt sing
Plague my brain with no cocaine
I don't wanna I don't wanna go insane
In every country around the world the people smoke the herb
Our mission is absurd but people want it <start> Man in a wheelchair
Lobby of the forest
With freighters hustlers hard up millionaires
Mobsters cops
Whores pimps and Marxists
All human life is there
In the forest all you need is eyes and ears
Man in a wheelchair listens to the chatter
Writes down all the insane crap he hears.
He can't move around but it doesn't really matter
In the farthest stall you needed his eyes and ears
And out they pour the hits and the misses
Turn me loose lonely avenue
And down in Nashville Elvis sings Suspicion
Pomus Shuman 
And he could never be one of those happy cripples
The kind that smile and tell you life's okay.
He was mad as hell.
Frightened and bitter
He found a way to make his feelings pay.
Back at the forest in the steakhouse of a lobby
A diner gets  bullets in the head.
Doc looks down eating his linguine
Thinking up a lyric for the dead.
And out they pour the hits and the misses
Turn me loose lonely avenue
And down in Nashville Elvis sings Suspicion
Pomus Shuman 

Friendly Jack Benny crazy Phil Spector
 and Eydie Gorme
Damon Runyon Junior and the  orchestra
All super human life is there
In the forest all you need is eyes and ears
And he could never be one of those happy cripples
The kind that smile and tell you life's okay
He was mad as hell frightened and bitter.
He found a way to make his isolation pay.
And out they pour the hits and the misses
Turn me loose lonely avenue
And down in Nashville Elvis sings Suspicion
Pomus Shuman 
And out they pour the hits and the misses
Turn me loose lonely avenue
And down in Nashville Elvis sings Suspicion
Pomus Shuman  <start> Hanging in a crystal tree
A love light shines for all to see
'Cause in our hearts we know the way it goes
Sharing all that we can give
And living all that we can live
With freedom as our only cornerstone
Mystic traveler he's the unraveler
And he will always bring you safely home
Mystic traveler he's the unraveler
And when he takes your heart you're not alone
And when he takes your heart you're not alone
Time is on our side I feel
The light of truth will soon reveal
A reason for our fears of letting go
All of our life energy flooring between you and me
Where together though we're quite alone
Mystic traveler he's the unraveler
And he will always bring you safely home
Mystic traveler he's the unraveler
And when he takes your heart you're not alone
And when he takes your heart you're not alone
No more sailing on the sea of broken hearted memories
Understanding is the key loving you can only be
A love for all eternity two much time has passed
Thank the Lord you're here at last
Hanging in a crystal tree
A love light shines for all to see
'Cause in our hearts we know the way it goes
Sharing all that we can give
And living all that we can live
With freedom as our only cornerstone
Mystic traveler he's the unraveler
And he will always bring you safely home
Mystic traveler he's the unraveler
And when he takes your heart you're not alone
And when he takes your heart you're not alone
And when he takes your heart you're not alone

Creeping up
Hold it down
Can't hold it down
Hold it down
Here it comes
Creeping up <start> Stranded in the storm trying to see through the rain
Looks like my life's coming 'round again
I wouldn't stop it now even if I thought I could
I was one of the remnants from a burned out scene
Trying to recover from the years between
What they didn't want then is what they think they want now
Down the road down the road
I can still remember being here a long time ago
I'd been pickin' up the pieces from another hard fall
Waitin' by the phone for an overseas call
They wanted my past and they wanted it now
I could sense it in the air feel it in my veins
Something was coming to take me away
I'd been lost for so long maybe it's the price we all pay
Down the road down the road
I can still remember being here a long time ago
I looked in the mirror trying to see
What it was they had killed in me
And why can't I no longer believe
I wandered around and I swore by God
I would never give in no matter how hard they fought
I've waited too long to have it any other way
Down the road down the road
I can still remember being here a long time ago <start> I'm on a million dollar trip
And it's making me sick
Infected and tired
I'm in need for help
I'm in need for help
In need for trust
In need for love
In need for lust
Yeah
Get me up help me out yeah
All the things I did was for you
Yeah you
Yeah you
Get me up help me out
Get me up help me out
All the things I did was for you
All my energy is lost
I think I've used it all too much
I'm pale and I'm sore
I'm in need for help <start> All of those wild american bilinguals
Who talk to you in paris of their lonely lives
School days and last days out there in the midwest
They climb on their liners and rejoin their wives
Walking down boulevards electric eyes
Would gaze at the waveforms and gasp at their size
Let them be lonely and say you don't care
Astro boy I'm watching the proles on parade
Astro boy I'm watching the proles on parade
Una with long hair will stand by your side
And the friends who were hungry could swallow your pride
Chromium pets that video screens would show
Pictures of helplessness old kings and queens
Radio stations that fade as in dust
All their transmitters are crumbling with rust
Let them be broken and say you don't care
Astro boy I'm watching the proles on parade
Astro boy I'm watching the proles on parade
Astro boy I'm watching the proles on parade
Let them be broken and say you don't care
Astro boy I'm watching the proles on parade <start> You found a way to change the world
A simple gift for every boy and girl
Always a piece for everyone
You showed them all that giving can be fun
Giving can be fun
Connor you've got the life I want
Connor I got it all so wrong
You'll never know
Connor
You've got the life I want
You've got the life I want
You've got the life I want
Connor
Those poisoned pills we passed around
They made us heavy pulled us to the ground
But you were built from beams of sun
Naive and unaffected by a world that's come undone
Oh what can be done
Connor you've got the life I want
Connor I got it all so wrong
You'll never know
Connor
You've got the life I want
You've got the life I want
You've got the life I want

Connor you've got the life I want
Connor I got everything wrong
You'll never know

Connor <start> Hey kids shake it loose together
The spotlight's hitting something
That's been known to change the weather
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight
So stick around
You're gonna hear electric music
Solid walls of sound
Say Candy and Ronnie have you seen them yet
Uh but they're so spaced out BBBBennie and the Jets
Oh but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh Bennie she's really keen
She's got electric boots a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine
BBBBennie and the Jets
Hey kids plug into the faithless
Maybe they're blinded
But Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive let us take ourselves along
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong
Oh Candy and Ronnie have you seen them yet
Oh but they're so spaced out Bennie and the Jets
Oh but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh Bennie she's really keen
She's got electric boots a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine oh
BBBBennie and the Jets <start> I'm the addict on the corner
I'm the lawyer in the tower
I'm the body with the coroner
No the leader with all the power
You're the pillow the cool side
The sand during high tide
The cocktail poolside
The water when clouds collide
From the inside out
We were formed
From the inside out
We will fall
Soon this all will come to an end...
I'm a local but a foreigner
Still the addict yet I'm sober
Still the body with the coroner
Many friends yet still a loner
You're the pillow the cool side
The sand during high tide
The cocktail poolside
The water when clouds collide
From the inside out
We were formed
From the inside out
We will fall
Soon this all will come to an end...
Soon this all will come to an end... <start> How did Camus really die that night
Were they right
When he died was it really his time
Or was it suicide
And Holden Caulfield is a friend of mine.
We go drinking from time to time and I find it gets harder every time.
Chorus
Three went down 
The minimal is criminal but less is a sin
Though three went down 
I'm not going to play if there ain't no way I'll win
Hemingway never seemed to mind the banality of a normal life and I find it gets harder every time. So he aimed the shotgun into the blue placed his face in between the two and sighed
Here's to Life
Chorus
Hey there Salinger what did you do
Just when the world was looking to you to write anything that meant anything
You told us you were through.
And it's been years since you passed away
But I see no plaque
And I see no grave and I can't help believing that you wanted it that way.
And Vincent Van Gogh why do you weep
You were on your way to heaven but the road was steep.
And who was there to break your fall
We're guilty one and all.
And I don't know much
But I do know this
With a golden heart comes a rebel fist and every single soldier wasn't fired
Some have quit.
And it makes me sick when I think of it
All my heroes could not live with this and I hope you rest in peace because with us you never did. And KDC you were much too young and you changed my life but I draw the line at suicide
So here's to life <start> From down below you can see the mountain
Raging high through the cloud burst to the sky
Wind blows cold through your mind and your soul
Can't break free from the fear that's surrounding me.
Want to love you baby
All night long.
Want to hold you baby
So strong
Lose control lose your soul
And try to touch the rainbow
Lose your soul and get out of your mind
Lose control lose your soul
And try to touch the rainbow
Lose your soul and touch the rainbow
Time goes by as we passed the raindrops
Fire and snow such a long long way to go
Movin' on in a world of shame
Don't know why but the sandman said
Goodbye
repeat bridge
repeat chorus <start> Miedo 
Para empezar
Dir que es el final
No es un final feliz
Tan slo es un final
Pero parece ser que ya no hay vuelta atrs.
Slo te di
Diamantes de carbn
Romp tu mundo en dos
Romp tu corazn
Y ahora tu mundo esta burlndose de mi.
Miedo
De volver a los infiernos
Miedo a que me tengas miedo
A tenerte que olvidar.
Miedo
De quererte sin quererlo
De encontrarte de repente
De no verte nunca ms.
Oigo tu voz
Siempre antes de dormir
Me acuesto junto a ti
Y aunque no ests aqu
En esta oscuridad la claridad eres tu.
Miedo
Ya se que es el final
No habr segunda parte.

Mink he pretty so mink he must die
Must die must die.
Sun he giving life in his light
Part of the system.
Friend to man and friend to the trees
No friend to the snowman.
Where does he go What does he do
Does he meet with the mole the stream the cloud
And end up at the bottom of the sea
Fish he got a hook in his throat
Fish he got problems.
Where does he go What does he do
Does he hope he's too small to poor a haul
Who'll end up bein' thrown back in the sea
I'm back in the sea.

Only one eye only needs one boot.
Sweet lady she know she looks good.
Vacuum coming for the bright and the brute.

At all at all.

In a thousand ways it's just
A disappointing loss of time
And energy
My need for control
Even down to your very soul
Has me soing things I wouuldn't do
Even if I were me
Chorus a
When it gets really bad
And I know the way I am
Then an avalanche of trouble starts
And I'm thankful again
Chorus b
What's this good luck happening to me
It's just a golden opportunity
What's this good luck happening to me
It's just a golden opportunity
My hot water's deep
All the lies I've tried to keep
Have me worried constantly
It's a sad thing
Then the drama lights the fuse
And I discover my own ruse
Then a guilty voice speaks to me
And I'm humbled by the shame
Chorus a
Chorus b <start> Here we go
Dance with the devil inside of me
I'm longing for a second chance
And taste what seems to remind me
Of all my skulls and skeletons
Live and let live
Die and let die
War and peace in my hand my temptations
This war and peace inside will take me to the end
Hell awaits
Its closing in on me
It strokes its hand down on my back
And no more mistakes
My intentions are finally clear from how I've always been
Live and let live

But I swear I stare into the face of adversity again
There's no turning back now
So take your best shot it's all that you've got
Won't quit with the pressure
You know I'm never gonna be defeated
This is a test a wake up call
It's a mission to talk
Shock to the heart blow to the head
You said you said
That this is just the beginning of the end
But I swear I swear
I will never let you get to me again

And all she's asking
Is for comfort and can't you see
Well I can't give it
I never could
So let me breathe
And please don't dye your hair
Raise your hands and say you're free
'Cause I would jump for joy and scream
But that's not me
You used to like it
You used to like me
What has happened
What is wrong
What could be wrong
The Pied Pipers will sing their song
The Little Lepers sing along
They'll sing along
CHORUS
You amount to nothing

CHORUS <start> Don't want to fall in love
Don't want to fall in love again
And you don't know where I've been
Don't want to fall in love again
I will not fall
Is it a matter of love or a matter of pride
Can't stop a broken heart from bleeding
Don't make it harder than it has to be
Nothing worth love is ever easy
Love is never easy
So if you want my love tell me now
And if you need my love I'll show you how
Just open up your heart and let me love you
Learn to love again learn to love again
Better to love and lose than never ever love at all
So tell me something new tell me why do fools fall
Tell me why yeah why do they fall
Ain't a matter of love it's a matter of pride
Can't stop a broken heart from bleeding
Don't make it harder than it has to be
Nothing worth love is ever easy
Love is never easy
So if you want my love tell me now
And if you need my love I'll show you how
Just open up your heart and let me love you
Learn to love again learn to love again
I should have known it all along
I should have know that I...
Can't stop a broken heart from bleeding
Don't make it harder than it has to be
Nothing worth love is ever easy
Love is never easy
So if you want my love tell me now
And if you need my love I'll show you how
Just open up your heart and let me love you
Learn to love again learn to love again
So if you want my love no need to ask
And if you need my love forget the past
Just open up your heart and let me love you
Learn to love again learn how to love again <start> You've got the father who can get everything
and being in possession and being envied makes you
feel like you're feeling something.
How am I just a merchant you can
steal from without regret
Know that you are not forgotten.
Know that this merchant prosecutes.
Know that empty tables and full hearts are fine for
beggars and prostitutes.
Who is the outsider
Sunglasses cause the world got brighter.
The day we stepped out of school.
I wanna be you I want to grow up faster.
Nineteen my unfeeling mistress the pimp
circumstance a cruel bastard.
I wanna be a man and you can be a woman.
Can you dig from where I'm comin'
I really hope you can.
Oblivious to the drift apart.
Never feel so slowly broken hearts.
Better off without the gang anyway.
Some of us die and some just move away. <start> You put your army on the street
But I can't see the peace they keep
They beat you up and gun you down
The mayor wears the golden crown
Call it Justice Call it law
It's just another lie
They prey on the poor they prey on the weak
These vultures that patrol the streets
They'll take a bribe and they won't think
They'll shoot you down won't even blink
Don't go outside the cops are there
There's law and justice everywhere
Look out for justice dressed in blue
'Cause next time they'll be coming for you <start> Everybody knows that you've got the coolest clothes
You've got everybody on your side.
Anyone can see you can hang around with me
You'll be by your self on Friday night.
Chorus
It's hard to understand if you never lose
You never want to win when it all comes down all around you now
Don't let it bring you down.
You had all the moves
You had all the coolest dews and you always had the coolest car.
I never learned to dance
I had hair down to my ass
And now I'm gonna be a rock star.
Chorus
Raise your hands stomp your feet
I love everyone and now they love me.
Raise your hands stomp your feet
I love everyone and now they love me.

Oh yeah don't let it bring you down <start> includes a quote from Wooly Bully  and part of the leather conversation

Identify your last port of entry space wanderer . . . <start> Hey would you dig to be alone
And tell me when will you be back home
And why did you leave me all alone
You blew my mind
Fool listen on to yourself
You don't know even when you been left
Tomorrow maybe you'll see the rest
I told you so
You gotta believe in something
If you don't you will be lost
You gotta believe in someone
No matter the cost
Well hell if I've been had
Then Jesus why's it got to hurt so bad
And when could something come and make me glad
To be alive
Look you got a mind of your own
So listen when it says you could be wrong
The first time is usually when you hear the song
That sets you free
Too late you realize that burning bridges behind you
Every time you lose insisting on something
That perhaps cannot be
You blow it away
You gotta believe in something
And give it some time
You gotta believe in someone
Go over the line
So love isn't lost so easy
And livin' ain't gonna be so cool and breezy
Look in my eyes know that I am speaking freely
I give you give blind I give you give blind
I give you give blind oh yeah I give you give blind
Hey would you dig to be alone
And tell me when will you be back home
And why did you leave me all alone
You blew it away <start> He's got nothing to say he's got no excuse
He's just made that way and he's gonna stay that way
Like a dog on the loose in a firework display in a world of his own
No no no he won't back down or go running back home
He's come a long way in life
He's got a long way to go
He don't even know he don't care because
He's growing up the hard way
In and out of trouble every day
Growing up the hard way
Now no tellin' where you'll end up boy
And he's got nothing to say like he's lost for the worlds his mind is in a daze
That's his way it's just a little game he plays
He's got nowhere to run while the city sleeps he wanders alone
Cuttin' through the steel and the hearts of stone
He's come a long way in life
He's got a long way to go
He don't even know but he don't care because
He's growing up the hard way
In and out of trouble every day
Growing up the hard way
You'd better walk the straight and narrow
Growing up the hard way
In and out of trouble every day
Growing up the hard way
Never know what you're in for boy
He's come a long way in life
He's got a long way to go
He don't wanna know and he don't care because
He's growing up the hard way
In and out of trouble every day
He's growing up the hard way
Yeah and he's gonna stay that way
You see he's growing up the hard way
Walk the straight and narrow yeah maybe someday
But still he's growing up the hard way
It's just the way he's grown up
Yeah growing up the hard way
There ain't no other way
Growing up the hard way <start> Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you life was so unkind
But your love was the key to my peace of mind
'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel
Like a natural woman
And when my soul was in the lostandfound
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful
Of what I'm living for
'Cause if I make you happy I don't need to do more
You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel
Like a natural woman
Oh baby what you've done to me

You make me feel so good inside

And I just want to be

Close to you you make me feel so alive
You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel
Like a natural natural woman
You make me feel
You know you make me feel
You make me feel
Like a natural woman
You know you
You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel
Like a natural woman
Natural woman <start> How cold am I
I feel so tired
I'm in your arms
I'm in your care
Too long
This hand is mine
I've been unkind
I'm in your arms
I'm in your care
Too long <start> Not that long ago
Seems like yesterday
We were caught up in love
We were swept away
Seems like over night
From out of the blue
Something went wrong
Between me and you
Chorus
Oh I'll move on
I'll be strong
Do what I have to do
No matter where you are
You'll always have my heart
I may never get over you
The hopeless dreams insanity
I'm just a fool with a fantasy
I close my eyes
I feel your touch
Just as real as it ever was
Chorus x <start> Sweet euphoria mine is the heart you own
You lost the grace of the hands that harmed you
In the daze of a thousand yawns
Lost my love as it is I'm truly gone
In you morning I will sleep
Fire on an open palm
Death for Jesus and plastic armies
Wouldn't bring me back again
Sweet as ether eyes I'm blind to them
Gone are your dandelions falling like mine
Falling on landmine pillows
Tired angels save my love for the lasting one
Sweet euphoria mine is the heart you stole
Touched and broken are the things you love
Using stars to light your candles
Warms my face but I can't remember yours
Gone are you dandelions falling like mine
Falling like daydream mangoes
Diving swallows
Save my love for the lasting one <start> I can't forget the night you told me that you loved me
The stars were shining so bright
How could I constantly resist you when you're lips were sweet
And your arms held me tight
You said you'd give me your heart
But you just lied to me from the start
Won't you please please stop pretending
And just say goodbye
No I won't sigh and I won't cry
You're not my guy just say goodbye
I can't forget how soft you're voice was when you told me
You needed my sweet caress
And when you begged me for my love I though at last I found
My whole life's happiness
You said you'd give me your heart
But you just lied to me from the start
Won't you please please stop pretending
And just say goodbye
No I won't sigh and I won't cry
You're not my guy just say goodbye just say goodbye
You're not my guy so just say goodbye <start> Words  music dick gaughan <start> Woke up this morning feel 'round for my shoes
You know 'bout that babe had them old walkin' blues
Woke up this morning I feel 'round for my shoes
You know 'bout that babe Lord I had them old walkin' blues
Leavin' this morning I had to go ride the blinds
I've been mistreated don't mind dying
This morning I had to go ride the blinds
I've been mistreated Lord I don't mind dying
People tell me walkin' blues ain't bad
Worst old feeling I most ever had
People tell me the old walkin' blues ain't bad
Well it's the worst old feeling Lord I most ever had <start> Salimos de la crcel
Metemos la primera
En el loro deep purple
Chirran las cuatro ruedas
Vamos marcando el paso
Vamos rompiendo el hielo
No hacemos ni puto caso
De las seales del cielo
Que no tenemos pasta
Pues dormimos un rato
Porque el dormir no gasta
Sale mucho ms barato
Nos comemos la noche
Cacho a cacho gramo a gramo
Enroscamos el coche
Y a maana no llegamos
La vida en un minuto
No pasa tan deprisa
Por si acaso disfruto.
Corre que me da la risa
Acelera un poco ms
Porque me quedo tonto
Y vamos muy lentos
Acelera un poco ms
Corre ms que el veneno que llevo dentro
Y acelera un poco ms
Ahoga en tu laguna
El pedal del freno
Y acelera un poco ms
Cmo djame que piense..
Qu el pensamiento
Viajamos en volandas
De cuerpos plastificados
Dormimos la garganta
Porque an no se ha despertado
Bajamos la mirada
La luz del sol nos quema
Pero no pasa nada
Porque an nos queda tema
De conversacin.
No me seas baciln
La solucin mira p'alante
Y a la carretera pon atencin
Que llevas el volante
Y eso es lo ms importante
Mira p'alante mira p'alante
Sufrimos consecuencias
Que todos esperamos
No tenemos paciencia
Y nos desencajamos
Nuestra piel es de hierro
Los ojos son de cuero
La risa la del perro tensa
Como el acero
La vida en un minuto
No pasa tan deprisa
Por si acaso disfruto.
Corre que me da la risa <start> So unaffectionate so insecure
You claim to know a thing or two about heartache
And what it's like to have your insides torn out
And I believe you
I see it every time your pallbearer's palor is obscured by the darkness
Dancing across your face and when the blackness veils your eyes in pain
I know what it's like when memories make you wince
And love letters read like obituaries
And photo albums are the books of the dead
I need no reminders no more reminders
I'll forget the past and lay it to rest
If I had my way
I'd cut the calluses off your breaking heart
If I could get past the sternum
Cauterize those wounds with
Every kiss I could give to you
I'm holding your heart in my hand
The reason it still beats
Am I being too cryptic
Am I being too obscure
Love kills romance is dead
And I don't even trust myself
But I love you
And you can pull my wings apart
And pin me down under glass
Until the end of days if it can help you
Discover that we share the same pain
I just hope you write your thesis
Before your subject is dead
No life after death <start> I met you at the club that night
around was spinning records
and my heart said
hey now
hey now
hey now
hey now
yaaow
you said you pleased to meet me
through the sweet smell of your perfume
blew me
away now
away now
away now
away now
yaaow
later on that week we went out
talked under the stars until the next
day now
day now
day now
day now
yaaow
you drank your fruitopia
and we never ran out of things to
say now
say now
say now
say now
yaaow
any minute i'm not with you
i hope I'll see you soon
there's just something that happens
when you walk into the room
and instantly i feel so complete
it hits me right about the time you kiss my cheek
and you give me this feeling
its like no other feeling
but it knocks me off my feet
please don't ask me what i like about you
cause its every little thing you do
and that's just the way you make me feel
and i don't think
that there are any others out there like you
and i won't blink cause that would mean
I'd miss a second beside you
and maybe you know what i mean
or maybe this is just a dream
i pinch myself just to make sure
but I'm still here and there you are
i wonder why we just met now
it just kind of happened somehow
but here we are together and
that's all that matters in the end
and instantly i feel so complete
it hits me right about the time you kiss my cheek
and you give me this feeling
its like no other feeling
but it knocks me off my feet
please don't ask me what i like about you
cause its every little thing you do
and that's just the way you make me feel
you can never ask for too much
cause I'd travel the world just to feel your touch
And that's just the way you make me feel <start> CHANT 
Brother
Oohooh
Shake it up shake it up
Move it up move it up
Bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro  <start> What have I told you
Nobody ever shuts up
Rather than listen
They hear themselves talk
Godawful habit
Try to behave yourselves
Nothing the matter
Just trying to get across
Why don't I go home
I'll put a record on
Like a Ray Charles song
What have I told you
Nobody ever shuts up
Could be a bad time
Now that my hightech hope is lost
Live for a starry sky
Under a Holly Hunter moon
What is the matter
You're feeling homesick too
Why don't I go home
I'd like to be alone
Got me worried now
If I could block it out somehow
It's too loud too loud <start> Wysteria did you change your face again
Those of us who loved you when
Can't even find you.
Wysteria did you lose another man
Did you make him understand
That he can't touch you.
Wysteria did he take you to the fair
Were the folks that you met there
The same that we met
Wysteria did he teach you how to dance
Did he bring you paper fans to hide your secret
Was he just like all the rest
When he got to the sad part
Did he stay a bit too long
To save his heart.
Wysteria are your lips still lily white
Do they still bloom just
At night and die at sunrise <start> instrumental <start> You're sorta stuck where you are
But in your dreams you can buy expensive cars
Or live on Mars
And have it your way
And you hate your boss at your job
Well in your dreams you can blow his head off
In your dreams
Show no mercy
And all your bad days will end
And all your bad days will end
You have to sleep late when you can
And all your bad days will end <start>  <start> When you told me that you loved me
And I thought I could tell that you did
My heart told me all was well
From the deepest part of me
There came a melody complete with harmony
As my heart played for me a symphony
I remember all the times
You told me that you were mine
And I remember what it did to me
From the deepest part of me
There came a melody complete with harmony
As my heart played for me a symphony
But when I read your goodbye note
When I read the things you wrote
When I knew that you had gone from me
From the deepest part of me came tones of tragedy
No trace of harmony no symphony
For there was no heart left in me <start> there are too many people in this world
trying to shove their names
how am i supposed to know where to run
but i don't know who's to blame
and i give people something along the way
is it ok to be afraid of love if you don't understand it
and the nights are so long without you
and the days speed up
my god i'll never let go of you now
cause some things are not worth changing
my heart swells to the size of an orchid
it takes the rest of my heart with it
going down down down...
but i'm never going back home
we've sent people into space without even really knowing
if there ever gonna come back down
and there are people asking
just where i am
is it ok to be afraid of hope if you don't know how to keep it
and the nights are so long without you
and the days speed up
my god i just can't lose you now
but things are about to change
my heart swells to the size of an orchid
it takes the rest of my heart with it
going down down down...
but i'm neverrrrr going back home
if people on earth could just get together
then maybe we could find a place for each other
if people on earth could just stand together
then maybe we could find a place for each other
if people on earth could just get together again
maybe we could find a place for each other
if people on earth could just get together again
maybe we could find a place for each other now... <start> Instrumental <start> I don't care what you're thinking
As you turn to me
Cos what I have in my two hands
Is enough to set me free
Set me free
I could fight the feeling to resist it over time
But when it's just too much to take you sneak from behind
Is it me you said you're looking for
Let me show you who I am
And what I'm here for here for
Hey
Try to reach inside of me
Try to drain my energy
Let me show you just
What I'm made of
Simple curiosity
Try to take a bite of me
Let me show you just
What I'm made of now
Like a million faces
I've recognised them all
One by one they've all become
A number as they fall
As they fall
In the face of reason
Oh I can't take no more
One by one they've all become
A black mark on the floor
Is it me Is it me
You said You said
You're looking for
Let me show you who I am
And what I have in store in store
Hey Hey Yeah
Try to reach inside of me
Try to drain my energy
Let me show you just
What I'm made of
Simple curiosity
Try to take a bite of me
Let me show you just
What I'm made of now
You can take another lifelong try
You can take another try
Hey

Yeah
Try to reach inside of me
Try to drain my energy
Let me show you just
What I'm made of
Simple curiosity
Try to take a bite of me
Let me show you just
What I'm made of now
Yeah try to reach inside of me Show you what I'm made of
Let me show you just Show you what I'm made of
What I'm made of <start> Bring out your weeping weeds
Put on your tenpint bowlers
Bring out your weeping weeds
We're burying Davy
We're burying Davy
Gather the screws and spades
Oil up your mudbrown slicker
Gather the screws and spades
We're burying Davy
We're burying Davy
Who'll plane the old pine boughs
Who'll set his legs uncrooked
Who'll plane the old pine boughs
For burying Davy
For burying Davy
Mother wept no tears
His brother grew unruly
Mother wept no tears
At burying Davy
At burying Davy <start> If you talk to Mary please don't look at me
'Cause she's never seen me before
Don't call attention to the man outside of me
'Cause she can cut my head off with the blinking of her eye
And I'm not supposed to be here and I'm too young to die
See she carries my confusion in the pocket of her jeans
Bouncing like a pinball in between extremes
I'm not surprised this happens all the time
And my hand lights her cigarette inside my mind
And she's never seen me before
So if you talk to Mary please don't mention me
'Cause she's never seen me before
Just let me hide behind the smoke and pleasantries
'Cause I do my best work with the mannequin brigade
I just peek around the statues spitting art and foreign trade
And she looks a hole right through me to a shadow on the wall
Till I'm sick of my surroundings while I'm not here at all
I'm not surprised this happens all the time
And my hand lights her cigarette inside my mind
And she's never seen me before
Warhol monotone robotic talk
We're all so smart we're so perceptive
But her mouth doesn't move
Except to smile to be polite to be receptive
She burns me with a glance I look away
I'm safely cool I'm so deceptive
I'd give my right arm for a different situation
I look around I see everybody watching me
I set myself up for this stupid situation
If you talk to Mary please don't look at me
'Cause she's never seen me before
Don't call attention to the man outside of me
'Cause she can cut my head off with the blinking of her eye
And I'm not supposed to be here and I'm too young to die
See she carries my confusion in the pocket of her jeans
Bouncing like a pinball in between extremes
I'm not surprised this happens all the time
And my hand lights her cigarette inside my mind
And she's never seen me before <start> There there's a place where I can go
When I feel low when I feel blue
And it's my mind and there's no time
When I'm alone
I think of you the things you do
Go 'round my head the things
You said like I love only you
In my mind there's no sorrow
Don't you know that it's so
There'll be no sad tomorrow
Don't you know that it's so
There there' a place where I can go
When I feel low when I feel blue
And it's my mind and there's no time
When I'm alone <start> Some will learn many do
Cover up or spread it out
Turn around had enough
Pick and choose or pass it on
Buying in heading for
Suffer now or suffer then
It's bad enough I want the fear
Need the fear
'cause he's alone

He's alone

Well if they're making it 
Then they're pushing it 
And they're leading us along
The hassle of 
All the screaming fits 
That panic makes remorse
After all what's the point
Course levitation is possible
If you're a fly achieved and gone
There's time for this and so much more
It's typical create a world
A special place of my design
To never cope or never care
Just use the key cause
He's alone

He's alone

Well if they're making it 
Then they're pushing it 
And they're leading us along
The hassle of 
All the screaming fits 
That panic makes remorse
Over and over a slave became
Over and over a slave became
Over and over a slave became
Over and over a slave
Well if they're making it 
Then they're pushing it 
And they're leading us along
The hassle of 
All the screaming fits 
That panic held before
Well if they're making it 
Then they're pushing it 
And they're leading us along
Like a cancer caused 
All the screaming fits 
And their panic makes remorse <start> Feeling curious I started planning
Just 'till I solve the local laws.
Pushing buttons wearing dirty gym shoes
Fingerprints line the hallway walls.

To keep me occupied while on parole.
Ten years later I saw the ceiling
Reflecting back through my toilet bowl.

  <start> Audrey had no right to say she's not quite comfortable today.
She's got a long road 'til she's whole.
Someone told her less than human.
Just here to serve and to create a better bed for him to lay.
I'd like to hear what she'd say had they let her speak her mind.
However insane it may sound. Walk through the door.
Welcome home. Welcome to the den I built.
What will he do when she is gone
Just like a real person she has a mind.
Imagine that But she can't use it in his home.
They keep her where they want her.
Step on her toes and beat her down. Can't let her fulminate her rage.
Last in the race off the line running still she stays in place.
A target for the weak you aim. Why would she want to be him
a neanderthal at best. What will he do when she gone <start> Good night Mrs. Grinch
We sure had a wonderful time
Thank you Mrs. Grinch
You really helped me ease my mind
That was wonderful Mr. Grinch
Thank you
You did a damn good job Mr. Grinch
Thank you

 <start> The Boatman calls from the lake
A lone loon dives upon the water
I put my hand over hers
Down in the lime tree arbour
The wind in the trees is whispering
Whispering low thar I love her
She puts her hand over mine
Down in the lime tree arbour
Through every step that I take
And every place I go
There is a hand that protects me
And I do love her so
There will always be suffering
It flows through life like water
I put my hand over hers
Down the lime tree arbour
The Boatman he is gone
The loons have flown for cover
She puts her hand over mine
Down the lime tree arbour
Through every word that I speak
And everything I know
There is a hand that protects me
And I do love her so <start> Late last night I went for a walk
Down by the river near my home.
Couldn't believe with my own eyes
And I swear I'll never leave my home again.
I saw a man walking on the water.
Coming right at me from the other side.
Calling out my name do not be afraid.
Feet begin to run pounding in my brain
I don't want to go I don't want to go.
No no no no no
I don't want to go.
Mm <start>

Talk to me girl
What Is that all you got to say
What what You're rubbing me the wrong way
See your lips moving
But I don't catch a word you say
Shut up your chatter
I need for you to go away
And all I ever hear is ay ya ya ya ya
You're talking way too much
I can't even hear me now
All your noise is messing with my head
You're in my head get outta my head
Outta my outta my head
want you outta my head
Outta my outta my head
get outta my head
Outta my outta my head
want you outta my head
outta my outta my head
that's what i said
What
You looking at me for
Show me respect or I will show you the door
Get out that door
Lately I've a problem with the way that you behave
You're too much
And all your questions don't leave
me no time for me
And all I ever hear is ay ya ya ya ya
You're talking way too much
I can't even hear me now
All your noise is messing with my head
You're in my head get outta my head
Outta my outta my head

Outta my outta my head

Outta my outta my head
want you outta my head
outta my outta my head
that's what i said
All your opinions keep them to yourself
Just let me think so I can hear myself
Wouldn't it be nice if I could just go solo take a day off
I'd be all right if you would leave me to it back out the door
Ay ya ya ya you're talking way too much
You tell me one more time how I should live
I swear I'll bite your head off
I am who I am and I can't be no one else
You've got nothing left to say keep your comments to yourself <start> Maybe we were together in another life
Maybe we are together in a parallel universe
Maybe our paths are not supposed to cross twice
Maybe your arms are not supposed to go around me
I hear about you now and then
I wonder where you are and how you feel
Sometimes I walk by and I look up to your balcony
Just to make sure that you were real
Just to make sure that I can still feel you
When I see you again
As I always do
It appears to me that
Destiny rules
And the spirits are ruthless with the paths they choose
It's not being together
It's just following the rules
No one's a fool
Six weeks in a foreign country how the time flew
I didn't speak the language but somehow I knew
That that would be the only time that we could be alone and foolish
We said we'd never come home
When I see you again
As I always do
It appears to me that
Destiny rules
And the spirits are ruthless with the paths they choose
It's not being together
It's just following the rules
No one's a fool
I like the coastal cities I like the lights
I like the way the city blends into the ocean at night
It's like living on a working river the coastline is glittering
Like a diamond snake in a black sky
When I see you again
As I always do
It appears to me that
Destiny rules
And the spirits are ruthless with the paths they choose
It's not being together
It's just following the rules
No one's a fool
Just following the rules no one's a fool
Just following the rules no one's a fool
Just following the rules no one's a fool
No one's a fool <start> Random blobs of power expressed as that which we all disregard
Ordered states of nature on a scale which no one thinks about
Don't speak to me of anarchy of peace or calm revolt
Man we're in a play of slow decay orchestrated by Boltzmann
It's entropy it's not a human issue
Entropy it's matter of course
Entropy energy at all levels
Entropy from it you can not divorce
And your pathetic moans of suffrage tend to lose all significance
Extinction degradation
The natural outcome of our ordered lives
Power motivation temporary fixtures for which we strive
Something in our synopsis assures us we're okay
But in our disequilibrium we simply can't stay
It's entropy it's not a human issue
Entropy it's matter of course
Entropy energy at all levels
Entropy from it you can not divorce
A stolid proposition from a man unkempt as I
My affectations major I can not live by
But we are out of equilibrium unnaturally
A pang of consciousness of death
And then you will agree
It's entropy
Entropy it's matter of course
Entropy energy at all levels
Entropy from it you cannot divorce
Entropy
Entropy

Entropy <start> When I'm five
I will wash my face me hands all by myself
When I'm five
I will chew and spit tabacco like my grandfather jones
'cause I'm only four and five is far away
When I'm five
I will read the magazines in mummy's drawer
When I'm five
I will walk behind the soldiers in the may day parade
'cause I'm only four and grownups walk too fast
Yesterday was horrid day 'cause raymond kicked my shin
And mummy says if I am good she'll let me go to school in August
Daddy shouted loud at mummy and I dropped my toast at breakfast
And I laughed when bonzo licked my face because it tickled
I wonder why my daddy cries and how I wish that I was nearly five
When I'm five
I will catch a butterfly and eat it and I won't be sick
When I'm five
I will jump in puddles laugh in church and marry my mum
And I'll let my daddy do the washingup
If I close one eye the people on that side can't see me
I get headaches in the morning and I rode on freddie's tricycle
And everywhere was funny when I ran down to the sweetshop
Then I fell and bleededup my knee and everybody soppied me
I saw a photograph of jesus and I asked him if he'd make me five
I saw a photograph of jesus and I asked him if he'd make me five
When I'm five
When I'm five
When I'm oah <start> In the fields of sweet ambrosia
I've been told
You can sit down by the river
And watch yourself unfold
You can drink right from the river
And purify your soul
Oh ambrosia pour it sweet and slow
I need to be replenished
I need to overflow
Let my senses know your power
Let your holy mix distill
Oh ambrosia
Let my spirit drink its fill
Oh I've been like those people
Who need pain to feel alive
But now I'm kind of like a child
Who's been slowly reconciled
To waiting on the wisdom that
He knows will soon arrive
In the hills above ambrosia I have seen
A lovely place of mystery with
Meadows emerald green
And the colors of ambrosia
Are as real as any dream
Just as real as any dream
Oh ambrosia pour it sweet and slow
I need to be replenished
I need to overflow
Let my senses know your power
Let your holy mix distill
Oh ambrosia
Let my spirit drink its fill <start> This uphill battle I've been fighting my whole life
Somehow this melody cuts deeper than their knives
These three chords can win this war
And it's not even a fair fight
Forget about yourself for just a while
I didn't really feel like singing this song
I've finally made it back where you were all along
It almost ended tragically
It almost all went wrong
I didn't really feel like singing this song
If I was afraid to fail I wouldn't even try
I won't be written off
I won't let them decide
For what it's worth
This doesn't work unless you're hanging on these lines
Forget about yourself for just a while
I didn't really feel like singing this song
I've finally made it back where you were all along
It almost ended tragically
It almost all went wrong
I didn't really feel like singing this song
Do you ever feel
Like we were meant for something better still
Well maybe not
But forget about yourself for just a while <start> Don't call my name out your window I'm leavin'
I won't even turn my head
Don't send your kinfolks to give me no talkin'
I'll be gone like I said
You'd say the same old thing that you been sayin' all along
Lay there in your bed keep your mouth shut 'til I'm gone
Don't give me that old familiar cry 'n' cuss 'n' moan
Understand your man
I'm tired of your bad mouthin'
Understand your man
You can give my other suit to the salvation army
And ev'rything else I leave behind
I ain't takin' nothin that'll slow down my travelin'
While I'm untanglin' my mind
I ain't gonna repeat what I said anymore
While I'm breathin' air that ain't been breathed before
I'll be as gone as a wild goose in winter
Then you'll understand your man
Meditate on it
Understand your man
D'ya hear me talkin'
Understand your man
Remember what I told ya
Understand your man . . . <start> Jenny was the girl that I once called my own
Then came the day my Jenny left me all alone
She died 'neath the wheels of a midnight train
Trying to find the high school ring
And that's when I first heard the sound of an angel's wings
Oh how my poor heart cried the day they took her away
And then something deep inside me seemed to say
Goodbye my love remember me I'll wait for you in eternity
And again I heard the sound of an angel's wings
I slowly walked back to my home down by the sea
And there on the shelf was a picture of my Jenny and me
And I fell to my knees as the teardrops streamed
And I cried Oh Lord let it all be a dream
But again I heard the sound of an angel's wings
I ran down to the sea so deep and wide
I just had to be by my darling Jenny's side
And I cried Oh Jenny please wait for me
Then jumped into the angry sea
And again I heard the sound of an angel's wings <start> The boy stood in the burning slum
Better times had to come
Fate lay in the hands that clap
The muscles that move and the power that raps
He went up on money street
Waving an popping to the beat
Off his wits an on his feet
He worked a coin from the cold concrete
Movers and shakers come on you got what it takes to make it
Movers an shakers come on even if you have to fake it
Where the highway meets the lights
With a red bandanna and rapid wipes
He shines Glass and he cleans chrome
He'll accept what he gets thrown
This man earns 'cause its understood
Times are bad and he's makin' good
Down on him but he's got it beat
He's working coin from the cold concrete
Movers and shakers come on....etc
And when I see you down and I say
That ain't no way through that ain't no way through
Movers and shakers come on...etc
Way back in some city heat
When a friend was anybody with food to eat
It was lousy life with a leaking roof
We got up to find that truth
Make a drum from a garbage can
Allow your tongue to be a man
When the beat propels you off your seat
You got it made in the cold concrete
Movers and shakers come on <start> She said she'd meet me in the bar
At the Plaza hotel
Wear a jacket and a tie
What's the occasion
She just smiled and she wouldn't say why
So here I am standing waiting in the lobby
Sweating bullets in this stupid old suit
And when she sees me she busts out laughing
You're a sad sight honey but you look so cute and

I don't want to be alone anymore
I was checking you out
I was just making sure
No I don't want to be alone anymore
And I want you tonight
Although you hurt me before
It didn't matter that I felt like a fool
'Cause I forgot when she walked through the door
I said I'm sorry but she said it was cool
And I don't want to be alone anymore
It's so confusing choosing sides
In the heat of the moment
Just to see if it's real
It's so erotic having you
Tell me how it should feel
But I'm avoiding all the hard cold facts
That I've got to face
So ask me just one question
When this magic night is through
Could it have been just anyone
Or did it have to be you
And will you still be saying

But don't you know that it's wrong
It's wrong it's wrong
But like the song
Being caught by the wink of an eye
I can't be sure we'll get along
But I'm willing to try
As long as you can tell me
 <start> I'm dead headin' down from Tulsa
Goin' back to San Antone
My baby called me up this morning
Beggin' me to come back home
Haulin' high hopes and thin air
Losin' money by the mile
I'll get there a poor man
She'll make it worth my while
I was a white line casanova
A love bandit of the road
I got the one I can't get over
I miss her more with every load
I got these eighteen wheels
Singin' home sweet home
I been too long gone
Oh I'm comin' home to you
I ain't left the fast lane
Since I hit the last toll gate
I know she's out there waitin' in that Lone Star state
She'll be standin' on the front porch
Reachin' out with open arms
This woman's out to get me
Shoot the dog and sell the farm
I was a white line casanova
A love bandit of the road
I got the one I can't get over
I miss her more with every load
I got these eighteen wheels
Singin' home sweet home
And I been too long gone
Oh I'm comin' home to you
I got a white knuckle grip
On this wheel in my hand
I'm rollin' down the highway
Just as fast as I can
I'm blowin' smoke from both stacks
Pickin' 'em up I'm puttin' 'em down
There won't be no time at all
'Til I'll be rollin' into town
I was a white line casanova
A love bandit of the road
I got the one I can't get over
I miss her more with every load
I got these eighteen wheels
Singin' home sweet home
And I been too long gone
Oh I'm comin' home to you
Yea I got these eighteen wheels
Singin' home sweet home
I been too long gone
Oh I'm comin' home to you <start> No thought no breath no eyes no heart
Everyone I see is missing something
Everyone I see is missing something
This dark and secret crime
Cruelty masked as something kind
Sharp against the tenderness
Cold against the emptiness
Everyone I see is missing something
Everyone I see is missing something
Split open to the wound
Send another saviour soon
Eyes closed torn apart
Body separate from the heart
You wouldn't notice I have no skin
You wouldn't notice I have no skin
Held down on the bed
This is what I think he said
The face of Jesus hung above
I will teach you how to love
You wouldn't notice I have no skin
You wouldn't notice I have no skin
And I can find you anywhere
Even if you run from there
Eyes closed torn apart
Body separate from the heart
Everyone I see is missing something
Everyone I see is missing something
Balance reaches beyond itself to lay hold of intelligence
So that it's satisfactions brought to the surface of consciousness
May become profounder more intense and more compelling
Violent we take a step away from awareness
And by striving to grasp the significance of our own violent impulses
We move further away from the frenzied raptures violence instigates
Everyone I see is missing something
Everyone I see is missing something
Burned with a cigarette
Some things you don't forget
Well trained in going numb
Well prepared for what's to come
You wouldn't notice I have no skin
You wouldn't notice I have no skin
No thought no breath no eyes no heart
In order to reach the limits of the ecstasy in which we lose ourselves in bliss
You must set an immediate boundary
Pain can carry me nearer to the moment
Bring me to a state of bliss bordering on delerium
No thought no breath no eyes no heart
And I can find you anywhere
Even if you run from there
Eyes closed torn apart
Body separate from the heart
You wouldn't notice I have no skin
You wouldn't notice I have no skin <start> I haven't come to please like all the times before
The arms I used to need can't hold me anymore
I haven't come to blame I do even ask you why
This time it's not the same I've come to say goodbye
No begging on my knees like all the times before
Are just the memories I'm leaving at your door
Don't ask me to explain so I won't have to lie
I've gotta go away and I've come to say goodbye
No begging on my knees...
Yes I've just gotta go away and I've come to say goodbye <start> Growing up today
There's many mountains you must climb
You're not the only one
'Cause everybody's on that line
Hey mister know it all
What do you recommend
You think you know the answers
But the questions never end
Young hearts better hold on
Beyond the innocence
Your youth is gone
Better look in your mirror
You got nothing to lose
Don't waste your time away
Thinkin' 'bout yesterday's blues

Born outta passion
To a world gone cold
Ya wear it on your shoulders
It's a heavy heavy load I know
Love and its emotions
Come knocking at your door
Young hearts will be broken
And time's the only cure
Young hearts better hold on
Beyond the innocence
Your youth is gone
Better look in your mirror
It'll tell you the truth
Don't waste your love away
Thinkin' 'bout yesterday's blues

Woah oh
Temptation makes us fall from grace
But the angels were sinners
And the sinners saints
Forgive yourself 'cause we're all the same
Everybody rides on the karma train
Young hearts
Better hold on
Beyond the innocence
Your youth is gone
Well look in your mirror
It'll tell you the truth

Don't waste your time away
Don't waste your life away no no
Live today there's no time to lose
'Cause when tomorrow comes
It's all just yesterday's news
All just yesterday news yesterday news
Yesterdays news yesterdays news <start> You talk and talk's so cheap

So ideas and stipulations put us right back. Applauds
ring out for your performance as respect slowly draws
Your prominent passion for passing
Off all the problems you've caused
While taking on all of the pages
Of all of the truth as were robbed
Over and over again sewn for a quick fix
Over and over resend recycle again
Struggle for something when you don't know the cause
Your prominent passion for passing
Of all of the truth that you've robbed
Well here I am

The desire that you will not find
Well here I am

Smooth and it's
A hard shade of white
And everybody needs to lick the surface clean
But it never tastes better
White blooms to white and freezes white again
Close it before something crawls in
Commit it leave it get away  we always
Drop our good side
Being good gets you stuff
Being stuff gets you good
Good stuf gets you being
And wheelin' and dealin' and squealin'
Shit lives forever
They have no legs but chase us anyway
Wipe the shadow of your best friend
Gave birth to something we don't want to be
We drop our good side
You can't kill it
Eat is just as deep as you can fuck it
So cough it up or go down
And there's only one thing that separates
A man...
Shit lives forever
We'll retire with a turd on our lips
Under a pair of knowing eyes
I'm gonna take a few down with me
And drop my good side
You can't kill it
Take it from our drummer Puff
Being good it gets you stuff <start> Use your head
That's what it's for
All i want is some more
Shave your legs
I don't want to be one...
One of those
Yeah and it takes so long
Yeah and my back is starting to hurt
I don't know how i feel anymore
Was that you who used to say
Never do it with a boy
Cruelty and sincerity are just the same
I had in mind telling you
I lost the faith <start> That man I shot
He was trying to kill me
He was trying to kill me
He was trying to kill me
That man I shot I didn't know him
I was just doing my job maybe so was he
That man I shot I was in his homeland
I was there to help him but he didn't want me there
I did not hate him I still don't hate him
He was trying to kill me and I had to take him down
That man I shot I still can see him
When I should be sleeping tossing and turning
He's looking at me eyes looking through me
Break out in cold sweats when I see him standing there
That man I shot shot not in anger
There's no denying it was in selfdefense
But when I close my eyes I still can see him
I feel his last breath in the calm dead of night
That man I shot
He was trying to kill me
He was trying to kill me
He was trying to kill me
Sometimes I wonder if I should be there
I hold my little ones until he disappears
I hold my little ones until he disappears
I hold my little ones until we disappear
And I'm not crazy or at least I never was
But theres this big thing that can't get rid of
That man I shot did he have little ones
That he was so proud of that he won't see grow up
Was walking down his street maybe I was in his yard
Was trying to do good I just don't understand <start> My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear
The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky

All together now <start> It is the th century. This is where it all began. My tired body has passed away but my
oncetortured spirit is finally free now. My name is ... Ayreon.
Arjen Lucassen
I've crossed the edge where time disappears
My life has been taken by the charm of the seer
My conscience is clear I committed no sin
My spirit roams free now carried by the wind
My mission has failed the spell has been cast
I wasn't the first one and I won't be the last
This can't be the end so let it begin
My message will reach you carried by the wind <start> In the morning I raise my head
And I'm thinkin' of days gone by
And the thing I want out of life is...
I want you
You can run you can hide but you'll never get away
You can lie and deny but you know you're gonna pay
Never loved never thought you could
Treat you right girl you know I would
You can fight but tonight there's nothing you can do
I want you
You can walk in the heat you can travel 'til you die
You can live in a dream and your life will pass you by
Every day that you hesitate never changes the hand of fate
You can fight but tonight there's nothing you can do
I want you
In the morning I raise my head
And I'm thinkin' of days gone by
And the thing I want out of life is... <start> Halfway to crazy not far from sane
Fuckin' sick and tired of all your games
All I ever wanted was you to take care of me
Honor thy mother and father too
But I know there ain't no way in hell that God mentioned you
All I ever wanted was you to care for me
Now I'm stuck in this hotel room your grandson and me
Tomorrow we're gonna find out our destiny
All I ever wanted was you to be there for me
All I ever needed was you to be here for me
This time is the last time you're gonna see us around
This was your last chance to prove you wouldn't let me down
So go on get going and get away from here
All alone is how you're gonna spend the rest of your years
No farmer's daughter anymore mommy dear.
Remember back in high school my brothers and me
Willie put his head through the door to find clarity
You'd come home with bourbon breath Jack in the air
And when you broke my bones I told the school I fell down the stairs
All I ever wanted was for you to be there for me
All I ever needed was for you to be here for me
This time is the last time you're gonna see us around
This was your last chance to prove you wouldn't let me down
So go on home get going and get away from here
All alone is how you're gonna spend the rest of your years
No farmer's daughter anymore
I ain't no farmer's daughter anymore
No farmer's daughter anymore mommy dear <start> THE BOY
I was cast adrift without a hope
My only friend is my old boat
With an empty sea and an open sky
A void no man can justify.
THE OLD MAN
Your sacrifices will ensure
A port of refuge ever more.
Lost and drowned
We'll wait 'till England's found
Again.
THE BOY
I was torn between what was good and right
And those who told me when to fight
So they left me here and they sailed away
To sink or swim 'til Judgement Day.
THE OLD MAN
Your sacrifices will ensure
A port of refuge ever more.
Lost and drowned
We'll wait 'till England's found
Again.
THE BOY
I was cast adrift. <start> Something like giving Time it flies so don't delay
When she's needing Today will soon be yesterday
Giving all there is Tommorrow she might
And remember this Not even be there
Something like staying When she does what she does
When she's lonely And it doesn't fit
Even though youre late You'll get by if you try
Everything will wait You'll get over it
Ooh it's something like loving
If she means so much to you
There's not a thing you shouldn't do Ooh it's something like love
If it will help to show her that you care. It's something like accepting
Everything about a woman
All the bad things too
She can change for you
Something like loving
Oh it's something like love yeah.
It's a brand new morning
Of a brand new day.
It's a brand new chance
To make it all work out some way.
To right the wrongs
Within the songs of yesterday
It's a brand new morning
Oh it's a brand new day. <start> un freddo pi pungente

twisted wings

broken heart
forsaken  forgotten

Been across the whole Atlantic and back again
I had it with your antics your childish games
Baby I call your number twice but it rang and rang
Against my best friends advice I should be ashamed
You did it to me once you'll do it again so she says
Love long distance is testing me trying my patience
I need more of your assistance now
Love long distance is testing me trying my patience
I need more of your assistance now
I heard it through the bass line
Not much longer would you be my baby
You work yourself into a panic bent outta shape
And then take me for granted like nothing's changed
All my friends are asking why you're that way but I can't explain
Why I call your number twice but it rang and rang
Against my best friends advice I should be ashamed
You did it to me once you'll do it again she promises
Love long distance is testing me trying my patience
I need more of your assistance now
You're making me crazy but way that you've been acting lately
I need more of your assistance now
Breaking up or breaking down when I need you you can't be found
I want someone who's around for me
Does it have to be so complicated Either way I'm devastated
I could use a little comforting
Love long distance is testing me trying my patience
I need more of your assistance now
Love long distance is testing me trying my patience
I need more of your assistance now
Love love love love I need some assistance now
And I will thank you for your cooperation
And I will thank you for your cooperation
And I will thank you for your cooperation stop playing with me <start> 
When you first open your eyes
don't be afraid I'm here to guide
in a world of vampire light
with me you'll live eternal night
I seek you out through the light of night
searching for my darkness bride
when I see that beauty's eyes
no longer alone will I hide

Let the sunlight cease to shine
in this vampire sight
sunrise beauty once was mine
now I'm seeing only night
in this vampire sight

I take you in my arms so white
your flesh burns mine with it's blood heat
razor kiss suck out past life
give you death life with my heart beat
I know you love the dark night life
I see it shining in your eyes
if you would come and be my bride
night will be yours all the time


 <start> no matter how many times we paint over these walls
the writing still shines through
in the stream of commerce we're afloat
a thousand washedup rockers trash the banks.
oh no.
in the stream of commerce we're afloat
and unafraid to sail a sinking boat
honestly my hand is on the plug this time
it says here right on my dotted line
haste creates waste
keep your eyes on the road
you might be able to drive
but you're so lucky to be alive
in the stream of commerce we're afloat
miles of red tape have choked us dead
now it's building like a nasty mold
and everybody can't help but catch the cold
aah aahh aaahh
all the writing on the wall shines through...
all the while we knew. <start> Natural disaster brought us together
In the name of science let me go
This town was built with honest labor
Sometimes it's all that people know
You could help us out
Would you help us out would anybody help us out
Would you help us out could anybody help us out
Children play at doctors and nurses
Grown men work at pest control
Have you lost all of your senses
Leading the way is all about taking control
You could help us out
Would you help us out would anybody help us out
Would you help us out could anybody help us
Out out out out
You never help us out
You never help us out
You never help us out
You never help us out
Banks are broken the shops are looted
Science warned this was bound to happen
Water in every quarter
All the world is waiting for action
You could help us out
Would you help us out could anybody help us out
Would you help us out could anybody help us
Out out out out <start> Note words in  are sung by Billy
You and me we should get out of this town tonight
Cause everywhere I put my foot down
It's just another concrete block waiting for me
And it's a...

And it's a...

My spirit is freezing to ice in this heat
Could you turn around and say
Hooray it's a beautiful day L.A.

But now it's time
To pack your bags and go
Hooray it's a beautiful day L.A.
But I think I'll be gone today
I've been traveling at the speed of gasoline
And stopped by the color of electricity
We've been trying for too long
To cover up his fingerprints
From a distant past
And it's a...

And it's a...

My spirit is freezing to ice in this heat
Could you turn around and say
Hooray it's a beautiful day L.A.

But now it's time
To pack your bags and go
Hooray it's a beautiful day L.A.
But I think I'll be gone today
And it's a...

And it's a...

My spirit is freezing to ice in this heat
Could you turn around and say
Hooray it's a beautiful day L.A.

But now it's time
To pack your bags and go
Hooray it's a beautiful day L.A.
But I think I'll be gone today <start> Well I'm craving for a cigarette hey give me a light
Feeling kind of thirsty give me something that bites
Sure been hanging 'round here for much too long
All you crazy people waiting for my song I said
Well here I am
I'm just another onenight stand
Anyway I don't know why I'm sad
For my fan club
Waiting for an autograph well you must be mad
Standing in the pissing rain must be a drag
If that's what you wanna do I won't say no
Wanna see more of me see me after the show I said
Well here I am
I'm just another onenight stand
Anyway I don't know why I'm sad
For my fan club
Well you send me pretty flowers while I'm slashing my wrists
Read those little letters through my smashedout mist
The dream I shock you is my nightmare
I'm the freak that's on display so stand and stare I said
Well here I am
I'm just another onenight stand
Anyway I don't know why I'm sad
For my fan club <start> Sometimes I'm fightin' with myself
And take it everywhere I go
Nothin' really matters much
Gets harder not to show
There is no use in complainin'
When it's others who decide
Take it as a given fact
Then lost is wrong or right
It is hard to believe in
A vision bound to fail
Every road leadin' nowhere
Takes your dream away
Let me find my way
No longer I can stay
Let me find my way
Each and every single day
And luck may shine
On everything you do
May it shine over you
And it's clearer now to see
That this ain't no way to win
For much too long this story goes
The light is gettin' dim
And all the high goals that we had
Call them precious memories
Up in smoke they went this time
But someday you will see
It is hard to believe in
A vision bound to fail
Every road leadin' nowhere
Takes your dream away
Let me find my way
No longer I can stay
Let me find my way
Each and every single day
And luck may shine
On everything you do
May it shine over you <start> And it's still freezing out.
I wanna tear down the walls.
I wanna make it summer.
Listen to Dillinger Four.
Go can your fucking emo.
You know I know we know that it's bullshit.
It's never been nothing more.
They'll turn their backs on you like you turned yours on me.
There's nothing you could ever say to make me change the things I play.
I happily accept the fact that nothing's ever gonna change.
Na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na
I'm going to fuck things up for everyone else.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Life is unfair. <start> Well I went out with that girl
Wanna know the reason why
That girl likes doing things on the sly
Sat down for dinner to be soft and hot
She never even put a stew bone in the pot
She's on the road again sure as you're born
Natural born he's been on the road again
He's on the road again sure as you're born
Man comes 'round here he's looking for his hat
Wants to know where your husband's at
I don't know he's on his way to the pen
Come on pretty mama let's get on the road again
She's on the road again sure as you're born
Natural born he's been on the road again
He's on the road again sure as you're born
Went to my house the front door was locked
Went 'round to my window
But my window was locked
Jumped right back shook my head
Big old rounder in my folding bed
Jumped into the window broke the glass
Never seen that little rounder run so fast
She's on the road again sure as you're born
Natural born he's been on the road again
He's on the road again sure as you're born <start> Getrunken hab ich wenig das Tanzen liess ich sein
Und uebrig blieben nur wir zwei
Die letzten sind die besten
Und ich bin immer gern dabei
Die Kueche ist ein Chaos der Flur ein Strafgericht
Was fuer Schweine laedtst do dir bloss ein
Ein Salat darf nie mit Nudeln sein
Denn sowas raecht sich bitterlich
Vom Biervorrat ist schon lange nichts mehr da
Doch alten Resten eine Chance auf eigene Gefahr
Denn was ist schon eine Party ohne Schmetzen hinterher
Die Suenden wiegen schwer und leiden kann man nie genug
Gib mir einen Zug
Von dem Kraut mit dem sonderbaren Duft an dem do rauchst
Nein das werden wohl alte Socken sein
Was auch immer da verbrennt
Das ueberlass ich dir allein
Was bessres wuesst ich schon das ist auch dir nicht unbekannt
Das zeigt das Laecheln das um deine Lippen schleicht
Vielleicht wird dieser Morgen
Ja doch noch irgendwie charmant
Der Lack ist bei uns beiden zwar schon ab
Doch alten Resten eine Chance mal sehen ob es noch klappt
Und was nuetzt das viele Leiden wenn man sich nicht auch vergnuegt
Die Suenden wiegen schwer doch begehen kann man nie genug
Egal wer oben liegt
Deine Hand in meinen Haaren mein Gebiss an deinem Hals
So stolpern wir duch das Morgenlicht
Doch genug der schoenen Worte
Es geht auch ohne dass man spricht <start> Tear drops on the city Bad Scooter searching for his groove
Seem like the whole world walking pretty and you can't find the room to move
Well everybody better move over that's all
'Cause I'm running on the bad side and I got my back to the wall
Tenth Avenue freezeout
Tenth Avenue freezeout
Well I was stranded in the jungle trying to take in all the heat they was giving
The night is dark but the sidewalk's bright and lined with the light of the living
From a tenement window a transistor blasts
Turn around the corner things got real quiet real fast
I walked into a Tenth Avenue freezeout
Tenth Avenue freezeout
And I'm all alone I'm all alone

And I'm on my own I'm on my own
And I can't go home
When the change was made uptown and the Big Man joined the band
From the coastline to the city all the little pretties raise their hands
I'm gonna sit back right easy and laugh
When Scooter and the Big Man bust this city in half
With the Tenth Avenue freezeout
Tenth Avenue freezeout
Tenth Avenue freezeout
Tenth Avenue freeze
I'm talking 'bout a Tenth
Oh nothing but a Tenth
I'm talking 'bout a Tenth
I'm talking bout a Tenth Tenth Tenth Tenth Tenth Tenth Tenth Tenth
Tenth Tenth Tenth Tenth Tenth I'm talking 'bout a
Tenth Avenue freezeout... <start> Red sun go down way over dirty town
Starlings are sweeping around crazy shoals
A girl is there high heeling across the square
Wind blows around in her hair and the flaqs upon the poles
Waiting in the crowd to cross at the light
She looks around to find a face she can like
Church bell clinging on trying to get a crowd for Evensong
Nobody cares to depend to depend upon the chime it plays
They're all in the station praying for trains
Congregation late again
It's getting darker all the time these flagpole days
Drunk old soldier he gives her a fright
He's crazy lion howling for a fight
Strap hanging gunshot sound
Doors slamming on the overground
Starlings are tough but the lions are made of stone
Her evening paper is horror torn
But there's hope later for Capricorns
Her lucky stars give her just enough to get her home
Then she's reading about a swing to the right
But she's thinking about a stranger in the night
I'm thinking about the lions tonight
What happened to the lions <start> When you love someone you'll do anything
You'll do all the crazy things that you can't explain
You'll shoot the moon put out the sun
When you love someone
You'll deny the truth believe a lie
There'll be times that you'll believe you could really fly
But your lonely nights have just begun
When you love someone
When you love someone you'll feel it deep inside
And nothin else could ever change your mind
When you want someone when you need someone
When you love someone
When you love someone you'll sacrifice
You'd give it everything you got and you won't think twice
You'd risk it all no matter what may come
When you love someone
You'll shoot the moon put out the sun
When you love someone <start> A rainy afternoon
Spent in the warmest room
She lay before me and said
Yes it's true that I have seen some naked men
As she made for the door
Leaving me on the floor
I wish I'd done biology
For an urge within me wanted to do it then
And here she comes again
And I'm sitting on my hands
And she sings to me that siren song
Here she comes again and I'm biting my lip
But it won't be long
As Brother Barry said
As he married Marion
The wife has three great attributes
Intelligence a Swiss army knife and charm
But that's not enough sometimes
And she did speak her mind
And told them all that she believed
The only way to disarm is to disarm
I know people whose idea of fun
Is throwing stones in the river in the afternoon sun
Oh let me be as free as them
Don't let her pass this way again
Though you cannot be blamed
But I've become inflamed
With thoughts of lust and thoughts of power
Thoughts of love and thoughts of Chairman Mao
We have such little time
At your place or mine
I can't wait till we take our blood tests
Oh baby let's take our blood tests now <start> So hard to find somebody who completes you whole
So hard to find a man
who conquest you with a word
And I found this word
So hard to breath
when a desire hold you tight
So hard to breath
if I needed and I could not treat you kind
Treat you kind
But I had you in my life
And I had you by my side
Chorus
I feel guilty wrong
I did not want to lose you baby
I feel ashamed
It wasn t my wish hurt you
So hard to find somebody who completes you whole
So hard to find a man
who conquest you with a word
And I found this word
But I had you in my life
And I had you by my side
Chorus
I feel guilty wrong
I did not want to lose you baby
I feel ashamed
It wasn t my wish hurt you
I should confess
It wasn t my intention I swear
Look around
There s no one like me
Who did everything to you
Who take the moon and bring for you
Forget the past
And let it go
Sorry I feel bad
Sorry I beg you
Give me a chance please listen my heart
I know
I Know you you know me
So now you know you have to come back We
But we were... we went
sorry baby I can't
Don't look back
Just walk and take my hand
I need you I miss you
I need you I miss you
My heart my arms
Miss you baby
My eyes my mind
Miss you honey <start> How can you see into my eyes
Like open doors
Leading you down into my core
Where I've become so numb
Without a soul
My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead
It back home
Wake me up inside
Wake me up inside
Call my name and save me from the dark
Bid my blood to run
Before I come undone
Save me from the nothing I've become
Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real
Bring me to life
Wake me up inside
Wake me up inside
Call my name and save me from the dark
Bid my blood to run
Before I come undone
Save me from the nothing I've become
Frozen inside without your touch
Without your love
Only you are the life
Among the dead
All this time I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years it seems
Got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought without a voice without a soul
Don't let me die here
There must be something more
Bring me to life
Wake me up inside
Wake me up inside
Call my name and save me from the dark
Bid my blood to run
Before I come undone
Save me from the nothing I've become
I've been living a lie there's nothing inside
Bring me to life <start> Well alright react
I'm forced out to atack
I was backed into a wall
Where i was no longer to see
Your lies that create
A feeling that i evade
Evaporated strentgh
To search out for securities
Well alright react
My limbs are unattached
I can't carry faith
For anyone or any anything
What words did you choose
On your last breath to use
Her bed was warm
And the sheets stank of rotted flesh
And its your reaction
Don't panic now
And its your reaction
Your reaction
Don't panic now
And its your reaction
Your reaction
Don't panic now
And its your reaction
Your reaction
Will you react
Well alright last verse
Our sound sets out to curse
Her blood coagulates
When I ended all her hopes and dreams
Her pulse rates down
I took love one last round
If what I've done is wrong
Then why hasn't guilt murdered me <start> Who do you believe can put some meaning in your life
Meaning in your life
Meaning in your life
Who do you conceive to provide you guidance and light
Guidance and light
Guidance and light
Are they waiting for you in the by and by
Do you even have to try
Headed for eternity and destined for nothing
The future isn't difficult to see
It's easy to confuse grand design with life's repercussions
Lament not your vanquished fantasy
It's only destiny
Why do you consent to live in ignorance and fear
Ignorance and fear
Ignorance and fear
Ancient people succumbed to it can it happen here
Can it happen here
Can it happen here
Does it make you suffer 'cause you have to die
Is it best to live a lie
Headed for eternity and destined for nothing
The future isn't difficult to see
It's easy to confuse grand design with life's repercussions
Lament not your vanquished fantasy
It's only destiny
Why can't you see
There ain't no destiny
For you and me
There ain't no destiny
Why can't you see
There ain't no destiny
For you and me
There ain't no destiny
Headed for eternity and destined for nothing
The future isn't difficult to see
It's easy to confuse grand design with life's repercussions
Lament not your vanquished fantasy
It's only destiny <start> Do ya know me
I'm the driving rain.
And my Momma was a hurricane.
Dear old Daddy 'fore he stormed out
high on window pane 
Said You my one and only boy child
Call you the Drivin' Rain.
Drivin' Rain
Drivin' Rain
T t talkin' 'bout the drivin' rain
Pretty women say it drives them insane
They all want to know me
I'm the drivin' rain
It all started
Back in 
Yeah I hit the ground runnin'
Couldn't wait to hear those gears grind
Just like my Daddy
I'm stone cold outta my mind
I've been 'round this world
One two three four five hundred times
Drivin' rain
Drivin' rain
I'm talk talktalkin' 'bout the drivin' rain
Pretty women say it drives them insane
They all want to know me
Yeah I'm the drivin' rain
Do you remember
First time you heard that thunder call
Wind was moanin'
Creepin' through your bedroom wall
Moonlight splashin'
Enough to make a rich girl fall
Lightenin' crashin'
Make a strong strong woman crawl
Drivin' rain
Drivin' rain
Tttalkin' 'bout the drivin' rain
Drivin' rain
Drivin' rain
Tttalkin' 'bout
Tttalkin' 'bout the
Drivin' rain
Drivin' rain
Tttalkin' 'bout the drivin' rain
Pretty women say it drives 'em insane
Well they all want to know me
Yeah I'm the drivin' rain <start> Should the image change
Would the rest look better
Surface dissolves skin and bone
We're on the other side
It might be better
If I left you now
Talk for hours
But it doesn't change
This feeling won't go away
Should the image change
Cost effects the measure
It does explain a second chance
I keep it all inside
It might be better
If I left you now
Talk for hours
First impressions last
And cast shadows on the rest <start> Living everyday
Trapped behind the walls
And it's something you defend
Pain is in your eyes
You're holding back the tears
So why is it that you pretend
And all this time you've hidden the abuse
But now you have a way out
It's your life just choose
So afraid but not for long
You'll brave the sea despite the waves
Now it's time to shear your fears
And trough them all away
You braved the sea despite the waves
Walked amongst the shadows
Through the chilling air of dusk
Once again but not alone
Waiting all your life for destiny
To shatter these four walls
And set you free
So afraid but not for long
You'll brave the sea despite the waves
Now it's time to shear your fears
And trough them all away
You braved the sea despite the waves
Visions in deep sleep
Racing through the mind
Will he ever dream again
Visions in deep sleep
So vivid and serene
How he wants to dream again
Waiting all your life for destiny
To shatter these four walls
And set you free
So afraid but not for long
You'll brave the sea despite the waves
Now it's time to shear your fears
And trough them all away
You braved the sea despite the waves <start> Truth is that you're near
Laugh is all on you
Now you're so alone
And nothing you can do
yeah
I know your lie
repeat
bled yourself too long
Fall is all too true
The master calls the hand
Payment now come due
yeah
I know your lie
repeat
false friends all depart
Your emptiness arrives
The world you made is gone
Your hollow lullaby
yeah
I know your lie
repeat <start> The art of blowing holes in a heart
Are what keeps me going
I need another love
And it's time you noticed me
It's time you noticed me
It's time you noticed me
It's time you noticed me
It's time it's time it's time it's time
The soft showing it can be as hard
As rocks and stones
And I need another love
And it's time you noticed me
It's time you noticed me
It's time you noticed me
It's time you noticed me
It's time it's time it's time it's time <start> It seems the scene is set
No time to turn around
But I will always wake
Before I hit the ground
Fear that silent serenade
That twisting of the blade
Of different elements Im made
Save your tears
As traitors run and heroes die
Fire rages bullets fly
I cant deny that
The war zone
The unknown
Its my home
Stare at the setting sun
Before the stars shine in the sky
Its time to rise or run
And I plan to live before I die
Fear that silent serenade
That twisting of the blade
Of different elements Im made
Save your tears
As traitors run and heroes die
Fire rages bullets fly
I cant deny that
The war zone
The unknown
Its my home <start> Bitter tea
I've got a special category business
Down by the multifunctional Dr. Sun yatsen memorial rollerblade rink
Down by the home of bitter tea
Bitter bitter bitter tea
Bitter bitter bitter tea
I've seen you slinking off of snake alley
Why not come up through the hall of butterflies
And past lane 
Into our dragon protector layout
And try some bitter tea
Bitter bitter bitter tea
Bitter bitter bitter tea
On the th day of the th lunar month
Outside a hot spring bath
The old banyan tree looked down on me
Aren't you curious
Aren't you curious
A little curious
About what the osmanthus blossoms taste like
I think you're curious
Yes you're curious
A little curious
About what the osmanthus blossums taste like
With a cup of bitter tea
Bitter bitter bitter tea
Bitter bitter bitter tea
On the th day of the th lunar month
Outside a hot spring bath
The old banyan tree looked down on me
I am a crazy crane
I lost my true love in the rain
I am a crazy crane
I lost my true love in the rain <start> Ten ten years
Ten years too young to die
Too many times I tried to talk
You still don't understand
Too many times you tried to say
I'm not your kind of man
Still it's time for me to come
I really want to know
Is it time for me to come
Or time for me to go
Sunday morning got to settle down
Got to get my feet back on the ground
Ten ten years
Ten years too young to die
Ten nine eight aseven six
Too many times you tried to talk
I still don't understand
Too many times you tried to say
I'm not your kind of man
Still it's time for me to come
I really want to know
Is it time for me to stay
Or time for me to go
Someday Monday got to settle down
Got to get my feet back on the ground
Thursday Friday got nothing to show
Got to be this punk I just don't know
Someday Monday got to settle down
Got to get my feet back on the ground
Wednesday Thursday got nothing to show
Why don't you tell me something I don't know <start> There was a game we used to play
We would hit the town on Friday night
And stay in bed until Sunday
We used to be so free
We were living for the love we had and
Living not for reality
It was just my imagination
Just my imagination
Just my imagination...
There was a time I used to pray
I have always kept my faith in love
It's the greatest thing from the man above
The game I used to play
I've always put my cards upon the table
Let it never be said that I'd be unstable
It was just my imagination
Just my imagination
Just my imagination...
There is a game I like to play
I like to hit the town on Friday night
And stay in bed until Sunday
We'll always be this free
We will be living for the love we have
Living not for reality
It's not my imagination
It's not my imagination
It's not my imagination
Not my
Not my
Not my...... <start> Treetops spinning at the outskirts of my vision
In the back yard of a stranger on the edges of my mind
I lay broken with my belly up to heaven I guess
Drinking hard for seven days can turn your blue eyes blind
Held that tragic destiny
Like a puppet on my knee
Blurred the line 'tween him and me
And nearly lost my soul
'till I realized I could
Get that puppet get him good
I used that doll for kindling wood
To warm me from the cold
Chorus
Oh my Dylan Thomas days are finally over
I'm through with all those selfdestructive ways
And though I ain't exactly clean at least I'm sober
I made it through my Dylan Thomas days
Lord have mercy it's a sunny Sunday morning
And I am not in a coma and there's nothing I regret
I did not wake up thirsty or to the sound of my own snoring
And the not so faint aroma of tequila on my breath
What a concept can it be
I feel a little like Dorothy
When she woke up and found that she
Was safe in her own bed
But oh that nightmare sure seemed true
And you were there and you were too
I don't know how I made it through
Thought sure I'd end up dead
Chorus
God rest his soul and his broken heart
Time has ticked a heaven 'round the stars.
Watch over me now wherever you are
Probably drinking whiskey in the Sweet Hereafter Bar
There's angels in the atmosphere
Crying sympathetic tears
To wash away our doubts and fears
And help us on our way
I used to run from their concern
Light the bridge and watch it burn
I took a while at last I learned
That ain't the only way . . .
Chorus <start> Well I came upon a child of God
He was walking along the road
And I asked himTell where are you going
This he told me
Said I'm going down to Yasgur's Farm
Gonna join in a rock and roll band.
Got to get back to the land and set my soul free.
Chorus
We are stardust we are golden
We are billion year old carbon
And we got to get ourselves back to the garden.
Well then can I walk beside you
I have come to lose the smog
And I feel like I'm a cog in something turning.
And maybe it's the time of year
Yes and maybe it's the time of man.
And I don't know who I am
But life is for learning.
Chorus x
By the time we got to Woodstock
We were half a million strong
And everywhere was a song and a celebration.
And I dreamed I saw the bomber death planes
Riding shotgun in the sky
Turning into butterflies
Above our nation.
We are stardust we are golden
We caught in the devil's bargain
And we got to get ourselves back to the garden. <start> Oh baby you know I may be a fool
I'm wastin' my time by goin' to school
The way you got me holdin' your door
I can't do my homework anymore
I can't do my homework anymore
Oh baby I said you got me so blind
I'm walkin' 'round in circles I could loose my mind
The way you got me holdin' your door
I can't do my homework anymore
Now baby your as sweet as you can be
Everything you do keep on sending me
Just the kiss of your lips or the touch of your hand
Everything you do is really grand
Oh baby oh now what can I do
I'm walkin' round in circles in love with you
The way you got me holdin' your door
I can't do my homework anymore
Now baby your as sweet as you can be
Everything you do keep on sending me
Just the kiss of your lips or the touch of your hand
Everything you do is really grand
Oh baby oh now what can I do
I'm walkin' round in circles in love with you
The way you got me holdin' your door
I can't do my homework anymore
I can't do my homework anymore
I can't do my homework anymore
I can't do my homework anymore
I can't do my homework anymore <start> No home
This is not any form of home
Home is where the heart is
No home no heart
No home no heart
This is your viewing room
Your room no view
Nothing seen nothing heard
Your home no heart
Shut up I'll kick out you shut up I'll do you in
This is your trap your crap
This is not my thing
No soul no heart
No home no heart
Shut up I'll kick you out shut up I'll do you in
Old wounds heal slowly they grow in to mold me
Home
Can 
you 
Trust me 
Can you trust me 
Can you trust me 
I've lived here for so long and it's been my way
It's always been the way to be like myself
Now you want me to change
Can't you trust me anymore
I can't change for you
I can't change I can't change for you
Can we just be enemies
I've lived here for so long
I won't change
So long sometimes
Can we just be enemies
Old wounds heal slowly they grow in to mold me
Shut up I'll kick you out shut up I'll do you in <start> I saw you sing out your praise
Come on and lay
The sunshine of my life's been burned
And I didn't see the way
Swallow down your pride
It's wrong and I'll
Help you hide
I feel sincerely you're too much
You're too much
All at the same time
Oh I
Know much more
Of what I can
Than what I can't do
If I should fail
I'm gonna nail
The blame on you
All my blame on you
Get it wrong and it makes you sore
But you're
Never right
I see it clearly you're too much
You're too much
We're all on the same side
There must be a time
Between the well meaning
When the good will come out
And start the healing
You won't know
How well you've played
Until you've won
And if at first you find
You can't imagine
How good can heal
When you've got nothing worth healing
You won't know
How well you're made
Until you're done
All you have is gone
The good will come out
The good will come out
The good will come out
Na na na na na <start>

 <start> The president was passing laws
Gave a call to santa claus
He said get that toy machine on high.
Economy is in a slump
I know what could pick it up
This year let's have christmas in july
Oh we'll have a christmas  a summer christmas
We'll have one fine funtime unwinding
In the sunshine christmas
Oh we'll spend yuletide down by the poolside
This year let's have christmas in july
I'm dreamin' of a hot christmas
Jingle bells jingle bells on the ice cream truck
Rudolf the sunburned reindeer
Have yourself a very steamy christmas
Who says christ was a capricorn
Maybe he perhaps was born
On the hottest sunday of the year
His birthday might have been the time to be
On the beach at galilee
Watching him change water into beer <start> Fuck racism.
Fuck that braindead scum.
Fucking boneheads too.
Go fuck em all to hell.
Fucking bigotry its to 's this is the year .
So this is relevant how come
The fact that I might need to remind you
that racism is ridiculous
justifies the premise for us writing this song.
So everyone please sing along.... FUCK RACISM. <start> I'm only sleeping Repeat x
Woke up this morning going back to bed
Alarm clock ringing in tune with my head
The to leave my boredom
Just 'cause I cannot
TV is my TV
Because the council after me
And when it's on it's pictures
I numb to the war in a distant country
I'm only sleeping
So I cover myself my quilt
My power's run down and so is my guilt
At times like this I'm at a loss
Drifting in dreams
My face and I the fact
The dss is on my back
I used to care a lot
Now the world spins before me
These days consist of sleep
Days TV

I'm only sleeping Repeat x
Don't wake me don't wake me
I'm only sleeping
Don't call me don't wake me
I'm only sleeping <start> I once had a dream
A feeling inside
A yearning so bad
You have to shout it out
Hey kid look at me
You can make it real
You can get it if you want
Hey you know when
When I first started out
They shut all the doors
But I laughed at all the doors
And I kicked them down
Here's my energy for you
Step into the light
While you still feel young
When I look in your eyes
And I reach for your hands
Well I'll do anything
To make you understand
That I'm still the seeker
For your English dreams
Don't you give up trying
And don't you let me down
The English dream
Don't let me down
The English dream
Don't let me down
The English dream
Don't let me down
The English dream
Don't let me down
Tell them
I look in your eyes
And I reach for your hands
Well I'll do anything
To help you understand
That I'm still the seeker
For your English dreams
Don't you don't you give up trying
And don't you let me down
The English dream
Don't let me down
The English dream
Don't let me down
The English dream
Don't let me down
The English dream
Don't let me down
The English dream
Don't let me down <start> You are the sun I am the flame
You are the blood I am the same
We are the love that rises again
They are the snake that bites on your veins
We are not chained to the wheel
You are the tear I have no fear
You are so strange I feel the same
Sorceress mind we ride again
We are not chained to the wheel to the wheel
It's the way that you feel
It's the truth in your eye
You got wings upon your back and you can fly
It's the way that you feel
It's the truth in your eye
'Cause you're up against the world and still you rise
And still you rise
You are alive and high in my dreams
You are the stars that mystify me
And you are the wolf that frightens the thief
And you are the voice that they disbelieve
We are not chained to the wheel
And you are the spark that sets us all free
We are not chained to the wheel to the wheel
It's the way that you feel
It's the truth in your eye
You got wings upon your back and you can fly
It's the way that you feel
It's the truth in your eye
'Cause you're up against the world and still you rise
And still you rise
Whoa baby
It's the way that you feel
It's the truth in your eye
You got wings upon your back and you can fly
It's the way that you feel
It's the truth in your eye
'Cause you're up against the world and still you rise
And still you rise
Still you rise
Still you rise <start> I love you so
you are my life
i'll never leave you
yeah...
yeah...
my world is for you
oh babe I want you now
thank you for everything
yeah...
yeah... <start> There is not a river wide.
Not a mountain high.
And neither sin nor evil.
Could change how I feel inside.
Could change how I feel inside.
Not all the strength of the ocean.
Not all the heat from the sun from the sun.
Now others have tried I just can't deny.
For me you are the one.
For me you are the one.
The true love is priceless.
For true love you pay a price.
But there's nothing can keep me from loving you.
Not fire no not ice.
Not fire no not ice.
Like a hero or a champion.
You are the best you're the best.
Like religion or superstition.
With you I am blessed.
With you I am blessed.
Now the river may grow wider.
The mountain may reach past the sky.
And whether or not you feel the same.
My love shall never die.
My love shall never die.
The true love you give and take.
The true love is sacrifice.
But there's nothing can keep me from loving you.
Not fire no not ice.
Not fire no not ice.
Not fire no not ice. <start> Okay this is a song about killing everybody let's all sing along now
Dream machine
John and exene
Smear campaign
And a swat team.
Let's have a feudal lord
Let's have a fascist regime
Side effects
Coupled with withdrawl bleeding.
This is a riot right
Let's all riot riot
Let's tear this place to shit
Commit pact suicide.

Kill kill kill kill kill.
Put your hand to my mouth
And a gun to my head
Let's stop this false pretence
Become real friends.
Let's have a mustard gas war
Because a fuck's a fuck
Richter scale madness
Join the gun club join the gun club <start> Osbournes
Ha ha ha ha ha
Aie aie aie aie aie aie
Ozzy puts bats down his throat
Real different people live in his home
Cosby he's not you complain
He's burned out from drugs and forgets his own name
Censors soon start bleeping What did he just say
I know enough to tell it's not a statement of faith
I know enough to tell Ozzy may need saved
Let's go
I've listened to Priest and I've listened to Cre
I've watched Alice Cooper get saved out of booze
One person's addictions can ruin his soul
But Jesus saved Alice so you never know
Metal groups still screaming. Why are we so tame
They're going off the trail but thy ain't insane
They're going off the trail 'cause we're lazy brains
Why don't we think 'bout Romans  through 
You gotta listen to God's Word
Yeah yeah
There was a cola war and Ozzy succumbed
He'll sell Mr. Bubble when MTV's done
Lately I just am not scared
The devilish Ozzy  he just isn't there
Maybe he's not really who and what you claimed
I know what Ozzy says but he may still change
So don't underestimate God's amazing grace <start> Smoke curls through my hands
These one night stands
Are making me crazy I know
Morning I'll go
Crowds in the rain all passing by
Faith gone from your eyes
Each word it flies
Taking you further away
And come that day
There ain't no easy way to cry
And as I watch you leave I stand
Inside my house of straw
And everywhere I go I find
Things recollecting to my mind
How right it all could be
Faith gone from your eyes
Each word it flies
Straight to the heart and I know
Watching you go
There ain't no easy way to cry
So right now
So right now
So right now
And as I watch you leave I stand
Inside my house of straw
And everywhere I go I find
Things recollecting to my mind
How right it all could be
Could be
So right now
So right now
So right now
So right so right
So right <start> The tactful cactus by your window
Surveys the prairie of your room
The mobile spins to its collision
Clara puts her head between her paws
They've opened shops down the West side
Will all the cacti find a home
But the key to the city
Is in the sun that pins
The branches to the sky oh oh oh <start> hey hey let's get over this I'm crushed by the push and when I listen I still don't hear kiss me and it will be fine my lips are well its my heart that's recovering your sweet saliva I prescribe life gets in the way of living I'm a teacher and the student a significant insignificance but still as everything changes kisses and hugs are all I want to <start> I'm never shy but this is different
I can't explain the way I'm feeling tonight
I'm losing control of my heart
Tell me what can I do to make you happy
Nothing I ever say seems to come out right
I'm losing control of my heart
And I wish that I could be
Another better part of me
Can't hear what your thinking
Maybe if I just let go
you'd open up your heart
But I can't read you
I wish I knew what's going through your mind
Can't touch you your heart defending I get left behind
I can't reach you
I wish I knew what's going through your mind
Can't touch you your heart protecting I get left behind
I like you so much I'm acting stupid
I can't play the game I'm all intense and alive
I'm losing control of my heart
I'm not supposed to be this nervous
I should play my hand all cool and calm
I can't breathe
I'm losing control of my heart
And I wish that you could see
The other better parts of me
Feel this fire I'm feeling
Then you'd see me in control
And baby then you'd know
But I can't read you
I wish I knew what's going through your mind
Can't touch you your heart defending I get left behind
I can't reach you
I wish I knew what's going through your mind
Can't touch you your heart protecting I get left behind
And I wish that you could see
The other better parts of me
Feel this fire I'm feeling
Then you'd see me in control
And baby then you'd know
But I can't read you
I wish I knew what's going through your mind
Can't touch you your heart defending I get left behind
I can't reach you
I wish I knew what's going through your mind
Can't touch you your heart protecting I get left behind
But I can't read you
I wish I knew what's going through your mind
Can't touch you your heart defending I get left behind
I can't reach you
I wish I knew what's going through your mind
Can't touch you your heart protecting I get left behind
But I can't read you
I wish I knew what's going through your mind
Can't touch you your heart defending I get left behind <start> I dream about stars here
I dream about bringing you a parade
We read foreign papers
Pretend we're hiding from an air raid
But I can't know
Why I always  Stutter
And she doesn't care
Breathe the same air
I don't have a hope in hell
Doesn't see
We could agree
This could be so blissful
And I will do magic
Houdini's rabbit lives here under my sleeve
I'd saw myself in half
There'd be two of us always ready to please
But I can't know
Why I always  Stutter
And she doesn't care
Breathe the same air
I don't have a hope in hell
Doesn't see
We could agree
This could be so blissful
This could be so blissful
This could be so blissful
This could be so blissful
This could be so blissful
This could be so blissful now ...
And she
Doesn't care
Breathe the same air
I don't have a hope in hell
Doesn't see
We could agree
This could be so be so be so be so
And she doesn't care
Breathe the same air
I don't have a hope in hell
Doesn't see
We could agree
This could be so
Good <start> If somebody's askin' I've gone away
Yeah somebody's packin' and gone today
The summer was lovely and I enjoyed my stay
Maybe I'll be back one day
Sorry to hurry but I'll miss my plane
Don't worry about me I'll be okay
See ya the next time maybe I'll stop by
Maybe well I'll try
Hopefully but I guess
I never cared that much
I never kept in touch
And most of all what really sucks is
Everything and all of us
So and so called me yesterday
So and so tells me that's me that so's okay
I don't know took me far away
Hopefully I'll be back one day
So many places so many faces
Everything changes and
Everything's the same as
So many places so many faces
Everything changes
Yeah typical I guess
I never cared that much
I never kept in touch
And most of all what really sucks is
Everything and all of us
Everything sucks
Everything sucks
I never cared that much
I never kept in touch
And most of all what really sucks is
Everything and all of us <start> Wake up little darlin'
I got some news for you tonight
Wake up little darlin'
I got my mud boots on
Chorus
And I'm ready to go
I'm workin' at the slaughterhouse
Well I'm workin at the slaughterhouse
Workin  to 
Keepin' you alive
Workin' at the slaughterhouse
Bye bye little baby
Why do you have to bitch so much
Bye bye little baby
Five pounds of lead keep me way out of touch
Chorus
Bye bye little baby
Why do you have to bitch so much
Bye bye bye bye bye baby

Chorus
Well I'm workin'
Yeah I'm workin'
Baby I'm workin' <start> Instrumental <start> Here he lies before me
My friend for many years
He saved me from the water
Now I'm drowning in my tears
Grief is but a poor word for everything I feel
There can be no greater love
He was there to guide me through the follies of my age
Always there beside me everything forgave
Held me as a father showing me the way
There can be no greater love
No fear did he have before the storm
The fate of others was his only thought
And though it was the way to certain darkness
To save my life he gave his own
For my life he gave his own
And these words are writ in stone where he lies
greater love hath no man than this
That a man lay down his life for his friend
greater love hath no man than this
That a man lay down his life for his friend
greater love hath no man than this
That a man lay down his life for his friend. <start> To your common sense firm arguments
I won't listen to your voice of reason trying to change my mind
I mind my feelings and not your words didn't you notice
I'm so headstrong even when I know I'm wrong
Take this to your heart and into your head now
Before you waste your time call a truce and call a draw
What's the use in mapping your views out in orderly form
When it does nothing but confuse and anger me more
I mind my feelings and not your words didn't you notice
I'm so headstrong You're talking to a deaf stone wall
Take this to your heart and into your head now
The old wives' tale is true I'll repeat it
'All is fair in love and war' that's how the famous saying goes
Open up your eyes see me for what I am
Cast in iron I won't break and I won't bend
Take this to your heart and into your head now
The old wives' tale is true I'll repeat it
'All is fair in love and war' that's how the famous saying goes
If I told you we were out to sea in a bottomless boat
You'd try anything to save us you'd try anything to keep us afloat
And if we were living in a house afire I don't believe
That you could rush out and escape it and not rescue me
Take this to your heart and into your head now
The old wives' tale is true I'll repeat it
'All is fair in love and war' that's how the famous saying goes
Listen I think they were talking to you <start> I am gross and perverted
Im obsessed n deranged
I have existed for years
But very little had changed
I am the tool of the government
And industry too
For I am destined to rule
And regulate you
I may be vile and pernicious
But you can't look away
I make you think Im delicious
With the stuff that I say
I am the best you can get
Have you guessed me yet
I am the slime oozin out
From your tv set
You will obey me while I lead you
And eat the garbage that I feed you
Until the day that we don't need you
Don't got for help...no one will heed you
Your mind is totally controlled
It has been stuffed into my mold
And you will do as you are told
Until the rights to you are sold
That's right folks..
Don't touch that dial
Well I am the slime from your video
Oozin along on your livinroom floor
I am the slime from your video
Cant stop the slime people lookit me go <start> Gave up trying you've been seen lying around
Hoping someone would tell you where to go
You swing your partner God's your partner now
And you just dipped him on the floor
If you see me going by
Then you've seen me going by
I thought life meant you were living
I thought death meant you were dying
Now I sit around and I stare
How dare call this a living room my living room
Gave up caring you've been seen staring out
Did you expect the paneling to glow
You're looking for a savior to take things over now
Seems you don't want to try
If you see me going by
Then you've seen me going by
I thought life meant you were living
I thought death meant you were dying
Now I sit around and I stare
How dare call this a living room
I thought time would always be there
I thought my life might go somewhere
Now I sit around it's a big despair
How dare call this a living room
If you see me going by
Then you've seen me going by
I thought life meant you were living
I thought death meant you were dying
Now I sit around and I stare
How dare call this a living room
I thought time would always be there
I thought my life might go somewhere
Now I sit around it's a big despair
How dare call this a living room
I thought life meant you were living
I thought death meant you were dying
Now I sit around and I stare
How dare call this a living room
I thought time would always be there
I thought my life might go somewhere
Now I sit around it's a big despair
How dare call this a living room
I'm sending you a post card
Yeah I'm sending you a postcard
I stare in my living room <start> Could you try to keep it down I was up kinda late last night
Yeah I'm feeling like I usually feel after I feel alright
I don't wanna hear another word about morning
I can't take the light
Could you try to keep it down I was up kinda late last night
There's something inside this world that's gone so wrong
There's a gap between the rich and the poor a million miles long
I dig the fact that you and your friends you wanna stand up and make it right
Could you try to keep it down I was up kinda late last night
I was down at the bar like the fool I am
Dancing on the table to Son of Slam
I met a whole lot of people I still don't know
I just rolled in an hour ago
Could you try to keep it down
Try to keep it down
Try to keep it down I was up kinda late last night
I don't wanna hear about your Lollapaloza tour
Man I just woke up and where I am I couldn't say for sure
I ain't the kinda guy to come and break all of you records
But then again I might
Could you try to keep it down I was up kinda late last night <start> 















 



 <start> Wenn Freunde nicht mehr sind was sie mal waren
Wenn sie dir nichts mehr geben vergi ihre Namen
Lieber Ha als  gespielte Liebe
ist alles was wir fhlen eine Lge 
Chor Es wird Zeit zu gehn zu gehn zu gehn zu gehn....
Kommst Du mit mir oder bleibst Du stehen 
Trittst Du weiter auf der Stelle oder beginnst du zu sehn' 
Wenn ich nicht weiter wei hilft nur noch eins
die Flucht nach vorne du weit was das heit
Bring mich weg von hier ich will ins Licht.
Ans Ende dieser Welt ganz egal wo das ist <start> I can stand although my bones are breaking
Prop me up and see my soul is aching
Take the dirt upon the ground around me
Bury me inside the grave I built for you
Walk into the room  Feel my stare of doom
Scars that line my face  Lies cannot replace
I can see through you
And I'll tell you
All my life I've heard a thousand lies
Seen myself through someone else's eyes
Kill you with my words  Get what you deserve
I can see through you
And I'll tell you
All my life I've heard a thousand lies
Seen myself through someone else's eyes
Remember what you did to me
For you know I won't forget
Now you've broken everything
Is your heart filled with regret
All my life I've heard a thousand lies
Seen myself through someone else's eyes
All my life I've heard a thousand lies
Seen myself through someone else's eyes
Remember what you did to me
For you know I won't forget <start> I'm standing on the edge of rd and Grand
With a tear in my eye and a bottle in my hand
I walked up and I stared for a bit
I noticed it's the same place that we first kissed
I'm closer than I've ever been
To seeing just how its going to end
It looks good from here love
So tell me
If I come back down
If I do well get higher and higher
So tell me
If I turn back now
If I do we'll get higher and higher
Or will the gravity pull us down
I asked why and he scared me with a smile
He said nothings going right and hasn't for a while
As strange as it seems it was such a prefect view
And the last time I was happy it was just me and you
I'm closer than Ive ever been
Or will the gravity pull us down
It's really not as bad as you make it sound
Anywhere is better than where we are now
I can't live without you
Don't let me go
I won't walk away
Weve been here before
So tell me <start> Wann hatte ich meinen letzten Fick
Ich bin ganz ehrlich ich wei es nicht
Es luft schon lang nichts mehr so wie es mal frher lief
Hchste Zeit das einzusehen
Ich habe Schmerzen im Kreuz wenn ich aufstehen will
Die Achillesferse tut mir weh
Und das Einzige was nicht kaputt an mir ist
Sind die Brcken in meinem Gebiss
Ich bin ein alter Mann schweinealt
Nur ein alter Punk viel zu alt
Schweinealt
Wenn wir Altpunks uns mal treffen
Geht es noch manchmal richtig wtend zu
Wir kmpfen gegen das Vergessen
Und um Respekt fr unsere Generation
Frher schimpften wir ber das Schweinesystem
Und beschworen die Revolution
Heute geht's um Rheuma und um Hodenkrebs
Und unsere Altersversicherung
Wir sind alte Punks schweinealt
Alte Punks viel zu alt
Wir sind alte Punks sterbensalt
Schweinealt
Wir haben fr euch damals den Arsch hingehalten in den er Jahren
Und was ist der Dank
Ihr hrt Techno und Hip Hop
Und wollt uns ber die Strae helfen
Wenn wir noch jung wren wir wrden euch so die Fresse polieren
Da braucht ihr gar nicht so dumm zu lachen
Wir sind alt alte Punks

Heh
Got that tempo
Hm hm
Heh
Gettin' tired
No fingers got stuck <start> Time I've been passing time watching trains go by
All of my life
Lying on the sand watching seabirds fly
Wishing there would be
Someone waiting home for me
Somethings telling me it might be you
And it's telling me it might be you
All of my life
Looking back as lovers go walking past
All of my life
Wondering how they met and what makes it last
If I found the place would I recognize the face
Somethings telling me it might be you
And it's telling me it might be you
And it's telling me it might be you
All of my life
Maybe its you maybe its you
Ive been waiting for all of my life
Maybe its you maybe its you
Ive been waiting for all of my life <start> Lions in the street and roaming
Dogs in heat rabid foaming
A beast caged in the heart of a city
The body of his mother
Rotting in the summer ground
He fled the town
He went down South and crossed the border
Left chaos and disorder
Back there over his shoulder
One morning he awoke in a green hotel
With a strange creature groaning beside him
Sweat oozed from its shining skin
Is everybody in Is everybody in
Is everybody in
The ceremony is about to begin
Wake up
You can't remember where it was
Had this dream stopped
The snake was pale gold glazed and shrunken
We were afraid to touch it
The sheets were hot dead prisms
And she was beside me
Old she's no young
Her dark red hair the white soft skin
Now run to the mirror in the bathroom
Look she's coming in here
I can't live through each slow century of her moving
I let my cheek slide down the cool smooth tile
Feel the good cold stinging blood
The smooth hissing snakes of rain
Once I had a little game
I liked to crawl back in my brain
I think you know the game I mean
I mean the game called 'Go insane'
You should try this little game
Just close your eyes forget your name
Forget the world forget the people
And we'll erect a different steeple
This little game is fun to do
Just close your eyes no way to lose
And I'm right there I'm going too
Release control we're breaking through
Way back deep into the brain
Back where there's never any pain
And the rain falls gently on the town
And over the heads of all of us
And in the labyrinth of streams
Beneath the quiet unearthly presence of
Gentle hill dwellers in the gentle hills around
Reptiles abounding
Fossils caves cool air heights
Each house repeats a mold windows rolled
Beast car locked in against morning
All now sleeping
Rugs silent mirrors vacant
Dust Lying under the beds of lawful couples
Wound in sheets
And daughters smug
With semen eyes in their nipples
Wait
There's been a slaughter here
Don't stop to speak or look around
Your gloves and fan are on the ground
We're getting out of town we're going on the run
And you're the one I want to come
Not to touch the earth
Not to see the sun
Nothing left to do but
Run run run
Let's run let's run
House upon the hill moon is lying still
Shadows of the trees
Witnessing the wild breeze
C'mon baby run with me
Let's run
Run with me
Run with me
Run with me
Let's run
The mansion is warm at the top of the hill
Rich are the rooms and the comforts there
Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs
And you won't know a thing till you get inside
Dead President's corpse in the driver's car
The engine runs on glue and tar
C'mon along we're not going very far
To the East to meet the Czar
Run with me
Run with me
Run with me
Let's run
Some outlaws lived by the side of the lake
The minister's daughter's in love with the snake
Who lives in a well by the side of the road
Wake up girl We're almost home
We should see the gates by mornin'
We should be inside by evening
Sun sun sun
Burn burn burn
Burn burn burn
I will get you
Soon soon soon
I am the lizard king
I can do anything
We came down
The rivers and highways
We came down from
Forests and falls
We came down from
Carson and Springfield
We came down from
Phoenix enthralled
And I can tell you
The names of the Kingdom
I can tell you
The things that you know
Listening for a fistful of silence
Climbing valleys into the shade
For seven years I dwelt
In the loose palace of exile
Playing strange games with the girls of the island
Now I have come again
To the land of the fair and the strong and the wise
Brothers and sisters of the pale forest
Children of night
Who among you will run with the hunt
Now night arrives with her purple legion
Retire now to your tents and to your dreams
Tomorrow we enter the town of my birth
I want to be ready <start> 'S wonderful
'S marvelous
You should care for me
'S awful nice
'S paradise
What I love to see
You've made my life so glamorous
You can't blame me for feeling amorous

That you should care for me <start> Take take your time
Smell the roses but steal the vines
Dont wait for the hands of time
To second guess and change your mind
Now just shine
Heres your moment to shine shine
Lay it down my friend close your eyes breathe in
And Ill take you there and back again
No more questions why Im not so surprised
Why you have been there and back again
Replace replace that line
That spoke to you then showed no signs
To be alive so are you living or dead
Have you made a choice to hear your voice
Or hold on to what they said
Now shine
Heres your moment to shine shine
Lay it down my friend close your eyes breathe in
And Ill take you there and back again
No more questions why Im not so surprised
Why you have been there and back again
Back again back again

And I will take you there and back again
No more questions why Im not so surprised
Why you have been there and back again <start> Brother can you hear me
His life is in your hands
He is just a child and still too young to understand
Show him love and courage
The freedom knows no bounds
Tell him he could never let me down
I always had the answer
All this time I held the key
And now that I see
The reason to believe
I can be the man who I am meant to be
Because of you I live again
Now I can be a voice for change
And help to build a world that's fair and true
So they can live the life they never knew
On the road to revolution
There are lessons to be learned
All the things you thought that mattered
Are lost at every turn
When the light of my existence
Was slipping through my hands
Pride and ignorance receded
To reveal the humbled man
My prince my son
You got lost along the way
In light of this new burden that you face
You are forgiven at this day
People can you hear us
Peace has been restored
The silence has been broken music reigns forever more
We sing the song of freedom
Together we are bound
People we shall never hold you down
We will build a world on common ground
And we'll live once more
Eternally in harmony
Our lives will be astonishing again <start> Since the new world order
played upon our fears
Spreading accusations
of radical ideas
The brotherhood of wisdom
Strength and dignity
Its rituals and secrets
remain a mystery
Beneath an ever watchful eye
The angels of the temple fly
Turn the key walk through the gate
The great ascent to reach a higher state
A rite of passage
The final stage a sacred home
Unlock the door and lay the cornerstone
A rite of passage
Men of wealth and power
Influence and fame
Philosophers and leaders
All members of the trade
Bound by oath and honor
Like the rose and cross
An enigmatic union
of esoteric thoughts
Beneath an ever watchful eye
The angels of the temple fly
Turn the key walk through the gate
The great ascent to reach a higher state
A rite of passage
The final stage a sacred home
Unlock the door and lay the cornerstone
A rite of passage
Turn the key walk through the gate
The great ascent to reach a higher state
A rite of passage
The seven stars the rising sun
A perfect world a new life has begun
A rite of passage <start> Cloud so swift the rain fallin' in
Gonna see a movie called Gunga Din
Pack up your money pull up your tent in the wind
You ain't a goin' no where
Hoo wee ride me high
Tomorrow's the day my brides a'gonna come
Hoo wee are we gonna fly
Down into the easy chair
Genghis Khan and his brother Don
Couldn't keep on keepin' on
We'll climb that bridge after it's gone
After we're way past it
Hoo wee ride me high
Tomorrow's the day my bride's a'gonna come
Hoo wee are we gonna fly
Down into the easy chair yeah
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings
A flute that toots and a bee that stings
A sky that cries and a bird that flies
A fish that walks and a dog that talks
Hoo wee ride me high
Tomorrow's the day my bride's a'gonna come
Hoo wee are we gonna fly
Down into the easy chair
Hoo wee ride me high
Tomorrow's the day my bride's a'gonna come
Hoo wee are we gonna fly
Down into the easy chair <start> We've lost the minds
We came to know
Like cattle out in the cold
We begged for months
We begged to know
Show kindness never found
Now we all belong
In the Saturdays of our youth
Cause we all have lost
So don't feel so alien
We rise and fall
For pride and gain
Just defending ours always defending ours
Well we must relate no well we can't relate
We must relate no well we can't relate
Now we all belong
In the Saturdays of our youth
Cause we all have lost
So don't feel so alien
Live in chaos
Now swinging claws
Closer closer let's see something new
Something new
Something new
Something new
Now we all belong
In the Saturdays of our youth
Cause we all have lost
So don't feel so alien
Now we all
Now we all

Now we all belong <start> Van Dyke Parks
This is so far from China
The star light like to blind ya
A lover's way of saying come home soon
Put it in a letter
Let each star there remind ya
It's time for love to find ya
A palm tree in the moon
When a comet comes out to fall
Why on earth do we feel so small
Must be heaven that we hear call
And in this natural planet
I feel like catching your hand
Out under our palm tree and moon
I put it in a letter
How could I love you better
And dropped it in a bottle in the sea
Put it in a letter
I don't know where it went so
I sent to Sacramento
Said you were meant for me
What a time to be talking small
But a crime not to talk at all
When it's heaven that we hear call
There ain't a cloud in the sky
No allowin' for why
Out under our palm tree and moon
Hoo do you
Hoo do you
Put it in a letter
Put it in a letter
You were meant for me
What a time to be talking small
But a crime not to talk at all
When it's heaven that we hear call
And for us two silhouettes
It's just as good as it gets
Out under our palm tree and moon <start> 
Good morning Mr. Ben.
It's about 
WinstonSalem North Carolina.
Um just laying here in the bed
Half awake half asleep
Thinking about you.
I was
Wondering if you were looking after your
Most valuable
Possession
Your mind.
I was thinking about
John Glenn
His space journey and all.
They said that
When you're in space you lose
Muscle mass
And the body
Mass
And I wondered if there was any
End to it.
Or whether
If you didn't exercise in space
How long it would be before you were just
A head or a mind
And have no body or arms.
You'd have them but you couldn't use them.
I was wondering if
If your body mass would drop to a certain level
And then it would stop right there.
And keep whatever you needed to
Use your mind
Because it would still be working.

Anyway I was just pondering that.
What do you think about that
I hope everything is going alright.
I may well wake up here in a little while
And forget what I was thinking about. <start> Let me call you darlin' maybe call you sweetheart
Don't you hate it when they call you Louise
But isn't it scary when they want to call you Mary
A whore or a saint or a tease.
But you came here in summer you'd been living in Manhattan
You caught me wide eyed and half sane
But you saw to my center past every imposter
And you whispered My True Name
I have been Betty Eleanor and Rosie
I've been the shamed Magdaline
And if the truth be known I've attempted Saint Joan
Donna and Sarah and Jane
For we all have our heros and we all have tormentors
and we'll play them again and again
But you saw to my center past every imposter
And you whispered My True Name
And if you see me standing on the banks of Lake Griffy
Throwing white bits of paper to the wind
I'm just throwing the shards of all my calling cards
And I'm speaking My True Name
I'm just throwing the shards of all my calling cards
And I'm whispering My True Name <start> I can't live without You
I can't live without You
I can't live
The light has gone and darkness has covered me
The moon is hidden and my eyes don't see
Still I follow still I follow
Beautiful is love revealed to me
Through the depths of my disparity yeah
Even when I'm shattering
I know that you've got me yeah you've got me
When everything else is changing
You are constant
Lifting my eyes to see
Far beyond this misery
I am consumed with You
I can't live without You breathe without You
I must confess to You
That I can't live without You breathe without Your love
Perfectly ordained and formed with love
My heart has been designed for Your touch
So I will follow I will follow
Stunning is Your glory revealing
The hope that lives deep inside of me
And I know that You have captured me
You've got me yeah you've got me
When everything else is changing
You are constant
Lifting my eyes to see
Far beyond this misery
I am consumed with You
I can't live without You breathe without You
I must confess to You
That I can't live without You breathe without You
I am consumed with You
I can't live without You breathe without You
I must confess to You
That I can't live without You breathe without Your love
I can't live without You
Lord I am consumed with You
I can't live without You breathe without You
I must confess to You
That I can't live without You breathe without Your love
I am consumed with You
I can't breathe without You breathe without You
I must confess to You
That I can't live without You live without Your love <start> Come take my hand
Let us walk for a while
Your burden of pain
Replaced with a smile
For the peddlers of death
Come calling one more time
Bearing promises
So called friends running loose
Draining you whole
'Ttil you're of no use
Letting go of what you need most
Early wish
Early grave
Early ghost <start> Instrumental Prelude <start> I been thinkin' about the time before
Every time you leave
And the pictures that keep playin in my mind
I declare I swear I can't compare
Simple things we shared
To the pictures that keep playing in my mind
I been thinkin' about the time before
Every time you leave
And the pictures that keep playin' in my mind
And every time you smile that smile
A smile I won't forget
I've pictures of you playin' in my mind.
Yeah I been thinkin' about the time before
Every time you leave
And the pictures that keep playin' in my mind
I can guarantee to some degree
Everything you see
Are just pictures that you playin' in my mind
I been thinkin' about the time before
Every time you leave
And the pictures that keep playin' in my mind
I declare I swear I can't compare
Simple things we've shared
And the pictures of you playing in my mind. <start> Like a whisper you came in the night
Gone forever seems you were right
Long ago thought it was real
Should've believed love's not forever
I'm slippin' away
Can't seem to hold on
I'm slippin' away
Darkness comes so cold
Gentle one so soft and warm
I tried to touch you I meant you no harm
I'm slippin' away
Can't seem to hold on
I'm slippin' away
Darkness comes so cold
I'm slippin' away
Can't seem to hold one
Save me
Save me
Save me
Like a whisper you came in the night
Gone forever seems you were right
Long ago I thought it was real
I should've believed that love's not forever
I'm slippin' away
Can't seem to hold on
I'm slippin' away
I just can't hold on
I'm slippin' away
Darkness comes so cold
I'm slippin' away
Now that you're gone <start> Once I wanted to be the greatest
No wind or waterfall could stall me
And then came the rush of the flood
Stars at night turned deep to dust
Melt me down
Into big black armour
Leave no trace of grace
Just in your honor
Lower me down
Culprit south
Make 'em wash a space in town
For the lead
And the dregs of my bed
I've been sleeping
Lower me down
Pin me in
Secure the grounds
For the later parade
Once I wanted to be the greatest
Two fists of solid rock
With brains that could explain any feeling
Lower me down
Pin me in
Secure the grounds
For the lead
And the dregs of my bed
I've been sleeping
For the later parade <start> There is a town in North Ontario
Dream comfort memory to spare
And in my mind I still need a place to go
All my changes were there
Blue blue windows behind the stars
Yellow moon on the rise
Big birds flying across the sky
Throwing shadows on our eyes
Leave us
Helpless helpless helpless helpless
Babe can you hear me now
The chains are locked and tied across the door
Baby sing with me somehow
Blue blue windows behind the stars
Yellow moon on the rise
Big birds flying across the sky
Throwing shadows on our eyes
Leave us
Helpless helpless helpless helpless <start> It's alright to tell me what you think about me
I won't try to argue or hold it against you
I know that you're leaving you must have your reasons
The season is calling and your pictures are falling down
The steps that I retrace the sad look on your face
The timing and structure did you hear he fucked her
A day late a buck short I'm writing the report
On losing and failing when I move I'm flailing now
And it's happened once again
I'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands
Sees through the master plan
But everybody's gone
And I've been here for too long
To face this on my own
Well I guess this is growing up
Well I guess this is growing up
And maybe I'll see you at a movie sneak preview
You'll show up and walk by on the arm of that guy
And I'll smile and you'll wave we'll pretend it's okay
The charade it won't last when he's gone I won't come back
And it'll happen once again
You'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands
And sees through the master plan
But everybody's gone
And you've been there for too long
To face this on your own
Well I guess this is growing up
Well I guess this is growing up <start> I'm heading for a life in the land of the free
Sending every penny home to the family
Off to find fortunes that can't be bought
Now Paddy's struck down from a single shot
Paddy's struck down from a single shot
They lured the men away
They promised wealth and riches
A thousand miles from home
Lying steel and digging ditches
The work would be a challenge
Nary a soul could stand the trial
These wayfaring boys built the railways toughest mile
Fiftyseven men on the hardest mile
Fiftyseven men on the hardest mile
Murdered for their troubles left to die
Immigrant sons from Donegal Tyrone  Derry
Their numbers were few but they did the job of many
Eight weeks went by and the path was clear
Fiftyseven men had all disappeared
Not a mention of their name
No stone was ever turned
It would be so many years
Before the truth was ever learned
Fiftyseven men on the hardest mile
Murdered for their troubles left to die
Immigrant sons from Donegal Tyrone  Derry
Their numbers were few but they did the job of many
Now ghosts dance a jig on an unmarked grave
A slug full of lead was the price they were paid
Vigilante justice prejudice and pride
No one in this valley
Will be seen again alive
Fiftyseven men on the hardest mile
Murdered for their troubles left to die
Immigrant sons from Donegal Tyrone  Derry
Their numbers were few but they did the job of many <start> Lady Willpower it's now or never.
Give your love to me and I'll shower
Your heart with tenderness endlessly.
I know you want to see me but you're afraid
Of what I might have on my mind.
One thing you can be sure of
I'll take good care of your love
If you will let me give you mine.
Lady Willpower it's now or never.
Give your love to me and I'll shower
Your heart with tenderness endlessly.
Did no one ever tell you the facts of life
Well there's so much you have to learn.
And I would gladly teach you if I could only reach you
And get your lovin' in return.
Lady Willpower it's now or never.
Give your love to me and I'll shower
Your heart with tenderness endlessly.
Lady Willpower it's now or never.
Give your love to me and I'll shower..... <start> Waiting
Upon the dunes of earth and sand
In the morning
The flame appears upon your hand
Swallow
The fears of empty promise hearts
And remember
We only just got to the stars
Save the dying arms of midnight
For the patience and or lapse of light
'Cause it's our time in the universe
Well I don't mind
If we're blessed or cursed
And it's our time in the universe
Yours and mine
Breathing
Beneath miles of earth and sky
And in sunlight
I will appear before your eyes
So don't worry
On what tomorrow holds for you
I'll be waiting
At the end of every road you choose
Save the dying arms of midnight
'Cause it's our time in the universe
Well I don't mind
If we're blessed or cursed
Well it's our time in the universe
Yours and mine
See you don't fall
No matter the end
See it unfold no matter the need
See it fold up whatever happens to be
It's what it will be
It's what it will be
'Cause it's our time in the universe
Well I don't mind
If we're blessed or cursed
Yeah it's our time in the universe
Yours and mine
Yours and mine <start> What we need isn't systems
Or regulating plans
But bigger guns to shoot with
And a bigger type of man
Ill will
For good or ill my iron will
Is unrivaled still evil ill thrill
This is the curse to me and my friends
Ill will no patterns no sense
I hate mental exercise
Thinking gives me pain
I know people don't turn out
That way today but here we go again ohh
Ill will ill will
For good or ill my iron will
Is unrivaled still evil ill thrill
This is the curse to me and my friends
Ill will no patterns no sense <start> When Brooklyn breaks into Saturday
The club rats scurrying away
And closing out and closing in
It's rare that something then begins
With promises like shining lights
Amidst the dawn of dying night
Through ringing amps and flattened beer
And all my cues for getting out of here
But Cara let the moon come in
And windowsills again have room
Cara let the moon come in
And for a time I'm high as noon
Cara let the moon come in
And I was sad I had to run
But Cara let the moon come in
And past upon the evening sun
Now I'm an old and broken me
Too many rides upon the wind
That carries hawks across the sea
To hunt and shiver for their sins
Too many dreams are left to stand
Until the tide can knock them down
But remembering I reach my hand
In case a few are still around
Cause Cara let the moon come in
And windowsills again have room
Cara let the moon come in
And for a time I'm high as noon
Cara let the moon come in
And I was sad our set was done
But Cara let the moon come in
And past upon the evening sun
So pass the bottle Pack the bowl
Let's swap our tales of rock n'roll
We have until the engine strums
And the Prevo sails to Kingdom Come
Cara let the moon come in
And windowsills again have room
Cara let the moon come in
And for a time I'm high as noon
Cara let the moon come in
And a profoundness had begun
But Cara let the moon come in
And past upon the evening's son <start> Citizens of the world rejoice
As of today a new chapter of mankind's history has begun.
We have solved nature's last mystery
It's ultimate secret and have finally found the key to eternal life.
Not only are you now all equal
You are also a priveleged new generation
Chosen to live forever
Welcome to immortality
Behold our world
At last we're all equal
Life and death have now lost their meaning
Time's alive inside of our bodies
'Coz nature's secrets are unveiled so we cry out
Now we've found just what we're all about
So long ago we searched for an answer
Life and death are now just a status
Look around you'll see a celestial glow
There's a high reward to our days of strife
Now we've found eternal golden life
Deep in your soul you'll feel
Doubts setting in
A cry that fills your veins with fear is burning inside
A craving so strong oh so strong for the real breath of life
I feel my heart beat
The icy hand of wind
Brushing my skin in the night
I'm imprisoned inside
A future predestined so far
Takes control of my life
Voyager of the future race
You drew the shorter straw
Chaos reigns all emotions all around
Panic sweeps the mind
And silence rebounds
Bouncing back from afar
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
The nights are cold and long when you're lonely
Wake up your mind right now or your wasted
Times goes by so fast at a steady pace
So desillusioned for the price we pay is high
Don't look down or you might fall
So be deaf to nature's call
Don't think twice and let your mind fly by <start> Mary Jo living alone
Drinking tea on her own
She wants I don't know what you want
Mary Jo living alone
Drinking gin with the telly on
She wants
The night to follow day and back again
She doesn't want to sleep
Well who could blame her if she wants
The night to follow day and back again
She doesn't want to sleep
Well who could blame her if she sleeps
Well who could blame her if she sleeps
Well who could blame her if she's sleeping
Mary Jo back with yourself
For company keep telling yourself you're young
And it'll happen soon
Mary Jo no one can guess
What you've been through
Now you've got love to burn
It's someone else's turn to go through hell
And you can see them come from fifty yards
Yeah you can tell
It's someone else's turn to take a fall
And now you are the one who's strong enough to help them
The one who's strong enough to help them
The one who's strong enough to help them all
Mary Jo you're looking thin
You're reading a book The State I Am In
But oh it doesn't help at all
'Cause what you want is a cigarette
And a thespian with a caravanette in Hull
Your life is never dull in your dreams
A pity that it never seems to work the way you see it
Life is never dull in your head
A sorry tale of action and the men you left for
Women and the men you left for
Intrigue and the men you left for dead
Life is never dull in your dreams
A pity that it never works are meanded
Life is never dull in your dreams
A sorry tale of action and the men you left for
Women and the men you left for
Intrigue and the men you left for dead
The men you left for dead <start> Pumps drunk with oil
Dance like prehistoric locusts
On the hills to LAX
People fill their tanks in flights of fancy
Actors waiting tables with a method they can't share
Waiting for what's next waitin' for the big screen in disrepair
I mean despair
I mean that actor standing there
Are we not all actors and the whole wide world our stage
Nah some are worthy writers with the grit to hit the page
To be or not to be
Now just part of the heartbeat in L.A. <start> Well maybe you're thinkin' I'm outasight
'Cause I know you saw me kickin' at the gig last night
Maybe baby that's why they call
Twang bar king
Rip bash smash burn up a fret
I can keep it in tune and nearly beat it to death
Yes baby baby that's why they call me
Twang bar king
Well I can bash smash beat rip tear out the guts
Burn it up and make it scream
Yeah yeah yeah
Ooohhh listen baby
I ain't braggin' but I'm the twang bar king
Twang bar
King <start> no lyrics
instrumental introduction <start> So many wasted days
Come and go like ocean waves
He hit me like a freight train
And now I can't get off my face
How could I have been so polite
To simply let her die
Who am I to spread my fingers
After you has filled my hands
Watching the moments slip through like desert sand
Respect her ignorance
Just in case she takes offense
The darkness that's killing her
Well that is just not my concern
How could I have been so polite
To simply let her die
Who am I to spread my fingers
After you have filled my arms
Watching the moments slip through like desert sand
You're not guaranteed tomorrow
You're not guaranteed tomorrow
How could I have been so polite
To simply let you die
Who am I to spread my fingers
After you have filled my arms
Watching the moments slip through like desert sand <start> Instrumental <start> I'm sick and tired of this socalled life
Without room to breathe
I toss and turn in my bed all night
Am I the only one who finds no peace
What are you waiting for
What are you waiting for
Escape to the stars
Feeling so free
Just you and me
Escape to the stars
Chasing a dream
All that we need is to believe
Escape to the stars
I've always been the one to speak my mind
Strove against the stream
Take on the system or leave it behind
And you will find a new reality
What are you waiting for
What are you waiting for
Escape to the stars
Feeling so free
Just you and me
Escape to the stars
Chasing a dream
All that we need is to believe
Escape to the stars
Overcome gravity
Holding you down
On the ground
Free from insanity
No one else is around <start> I've got a new age girl 
An environmentalist girl 
She has crystal necklace 
Though her vibes are rather reckless 
Oh her flowing skirt is blowing in a transcendental wind
And she wonders without knowing where did she begin..
Mary Moon... she's a vegetarian 
Mary Moon... will outlive all the septuagenarians 
Oh she loves me so
She hates to be alone
She don't eat meat
But she sure like the bone
You knew she drives a wind car 
It doesn't get her far 
But it gets her to where she's going to 
Where that is I wish I knew
I don't know where she's going
And I don't know where she's been
All I know that loving her has gotta be a sin
Mary Moon... she's a vegetarian 
Mary Moon... will outlive all the septuagenarians 
Oh she loves me so
She hates to be alone
She don't eat meat
But she sure like the bone
Mary Moon will you hesitate
Don't segregate your thought from your emotions
I know that devotion isn't way up there
Mary Moon... she's a vegetarian 
Mary Moon... will outlive all the septuagenarians 
Mary Moon... she's an intellectual 
Mary Moon... despite that fact remains quite sexual 
Mary Moon... she's the one for me me yeah <start> Mesmerized I swallow a piece of your toxic mind a taste of decease.
I don't know why you've chosen me to be one of the guinea pigs in your game.
Now I'm a wreck in hell to please you.
In this life we strive to feel so fine to feel so alive.
On the way there's something new to try.
I swallow a piece and hope it's not a lie.
All around there are people who feel that it's all about the things that we need.
It's not right what you've done to me but it might be a way to make them see.
Now I'm a wreck in hell to please you.
In this life we strive to feel so fine to feel so alive.
On the way there's something new to try.
I swallow a piece and hope it's not a lie. <start> Well she goes struttin' down the street In her sophisticated style
The way she's dressed was a knocking 'em wild
The cats started gazing till they called her out
Her pink pedal pushers was aknocking 'em out
She wears apink pedal pushers pink pedal pushers
Her pink pedal pushers has made her the queen of them all
She goes drivin' down the street in her brand new car
The cats started gazin' from near and far
She don't cause commotion till she steps outside
The cats get hip and holler oohooh man alive
She's wearin' pink pedal pushers pink pedal pushers
Pink pedal pushers has made her the queen of them all

Pink pedal pushers has made her the queen of the mall
She got the number one phones to high school hop
The older folks said she got to favor the mob
She's got more than I've ever had
She's a rock 'n' roll ditty with a brand new fad
She wears apink pedal pushers pink pedal pushers
Pink pedal pushers has made her the queen of them all
Well they gave her a part in a high school play
They all chose her to play the old may
Curtain call had the crowd off the floor
Her pink pedal pusher they stole the show
She wears apink pedal pushers pink pedal pushers
Pink pedal pushers has made her the queen of them all

Pink pedal pushers has made her the queen of the mall <start> Anchor the night open the sky
Hide in the hours before sunrise
Pray for me not I won't lose sight
Of where I belong and where you lie
Heaven's dead when you get sad
I see your wishes flying
Out of time
For the best time you've had
Shipwreck the sun I'm on your side
An army of one onward we'll ride
And whisper your songs birds to the air
We will bury all of our burdens there
Heaven's dead when you get sad
I see your wishes flying
Out of time
For the best time you've had
Heaven's dead when you get sad
I see your wishes flying
Out of time

Hundreds or more to save you from one
Save you from one
And where I'll be
Heaven's dead when you get sad <start> There's something about the way we fit
There's something about this psycho trip
There's something about the way we groove
Something's got me and I just can't seem to choose
I want you
I hate you
The one I love I hate
But the sex is great
The one I love I hate
But the sex is great
The one I love I hate
So I contemplate
The one I love I hate
But the sex is great
There's something about the way we slide
There's something about this psycho ride
There's something about the things we do
Something's got me and I just can't seem to choose
I want you
I hate you
The one I love I hate
But the sex is great
The one I love I hate
But the sex is great
The one I love I hate
So I contemplate
The one I love I hate
But the sex is great
One two fuck you
Never say no
I'm ready to go
We're out of control
But I can't let you go let you go
There's something about the way we fit
There's something about this psycho bitch
The one I love I hate
But the sex is great
The one I love I hate
But the sex is great
The one I love I hate
I could suffocate
The one I love I hate
But the sex is great
I love to hate you
She know I love to hate you
She know I love to hate you
She know I love to hate you hate you hate you

What's that sound what's that sound
Don't turn on be dead or alive
No feeling
Here she comes
Oww yeah

 <start> She came to me
Like a summer breeze
She came to me
Like a summer breeze
Summer girls free and easy
Yeah alright
Summer girls free and easy
She came to me
Like a summer breeze <start> There's so many things
To feel and see while you're awake
They're just out of reach
Out of grasp
Yeah out of reach
And just as many maybe more
The minute that you sleep
So I got to throw my preach
Skeleton breath
Scorpion blush
I have a crush on your skeleton
Watch out unsuspecting stranger
You'll fall off the log
Headfirst into dreams
End up screaming
This will comb the wolf
And that will comb the fog
What will peen the rain
What will preen the hog
Oh you mean earth
And hell over you
And laugh at your tire tracks
If you get up
Skeleton makes good <start> World on your shoulders
Lot on your brain
Enough to drive a girl insane
Well I been thinkin bout maybe headin' southbound
Wonder if you'd do the same
Chorus
Why don't you roll with me baby down to Nowhere Texas
I got nothin but time
Jump in the cab of my  Chevy
Leave Oklahoma far behind
My good friend told me once Texas is big enough
That a man could get lost
Roll down that window
Open that glove box
Give that road map a toss
Chorus
Dallas to Austin
Please come to Boston
Cause I been playin all night long
Turn off that radio
I'm gonna sing to you sweetly
the words to your favorite song
Chorus
Well we'll keep on drivin till we hit that ocean
We'll get there by the break of day
Maybe I should warn you I never could stay sober
When I'm sittin on that Corpus Christi Bay
Chorus X <start> Oh I seen him walkin'
On down that road
He got a broken push cart
With a heavy load
Oh Lord have mercy
Upon my wicked soul
Ah he looked right at me
With his eyes of coal
It's the hoodoo operator
Hoodoo operator
Hoodoo operator
Hoodoo operator
Ah he'll sell you liquids
To cure that whooping cough
And fine liniments
At a poor man's cost
Ah but when your time is up boy
And you feel that chill
He will come softly knocking
To collect his bill
It's the hoodoo operator
Hoodoo operator
Hoodoo operator
Hoodoo operator
Oh I seen him walkin'
On down that road
He got a broken white man
With a heavy load
Oh Lord have mercy
Upon my foolish soul
It is so cold and dark
Behind these eyes of coal
It's the hoodoo operator
Hoodoo operator
Hoodoo operator
Hoodoo operator
Operate
Operate
Operate <start> Today I started home with just a mile ago
And everythin' was goin' on right
And then I heard sock it to me on the radio
And I'll never make it home tonight
Well I made it down on the old crossroad
Where the wrong road leads to the right
Then I thought of many in the mini skirts
And I'll never make it home tonight
Yeah the road to the right is wrong the one to the left is right
I'ma lookin' for the right place to go wrong
And I'll never make it home tonight
Yeah the road to the right
Down in the glad place for the sad
I'm losin' for I'm gonna get fight
I'ma lookin' for good place to go bad
And I'll never make it home tonight
Well I got kinda high and live a little low
Started home about daylight
When I got to the road where I should've get
Left again I turn to the right
Yeah the road to the right
Yeah the road to the right
Yeah it don't look like
I'm gonna make it home tonight <start> Conscience makes cowards of us all
I don't have to say I love you you know I worship you
Oh I would give just anything to share my life with you
But I can't leave her I just can't hurt her my mind would climb right up the wall
Conscience makes cowards of us all
I can't tell her I don't love her bacause I'm so afraid
Through hard times she stood by me and with all the heart she gave
And my little man wouldn't understand God knows I love him and he's so small
Conscience makes cowards of us all
Conscience can make us fall and weak can give a bravest man a yellow streak
I know my arms my lips will beg for you when your mem'ry I recall
Conscience makes cowards of us all of us all
Oh yes conscience makes cowards of us all <start> If God hadn't smiled on me
I could be living pitifully.
I might be committing crime
Or locked up and doing time.
I might be a beggar on the street
Shoved away by those I meet.
Mine could be a dreamless life
I could be a lot I wouldn't like.
Chorus
God blesses me everyday
By the love he sends to me.
He's put friends in my life
And I have a loving family.
I had parents who gave me love
When I was delivered from above.
Many people have loved me
I count blessings I can see.
I have friends that really care
In my heart is love to share.
My life has been a good one
I'm not ashamed of what I done.
Chorus
God blesses me everyday
By the love he sends to me.
He's put friends in my life
And I have a loving family. <start> Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd end up just like me
Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd float down to the sea
Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd say just what you please
Without the sticky little kitten
Your ticket could never be free
Without the tight little denim
Your virtues would all go unknown
Without the room that you live in
Your cancer would eat to the bone
Your muscles would bulge underground
Your demons would all be around
Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd end up just like me
Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd end up just like me
Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd burn all these dying leaves
Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd lift this steaming herd
You would kill all the sick ones
You would bury them deep in the earth
Without the tight little denim
Your virtues would all go unknown
Without the room that you live in
Your cancers would eat to the bone
Your muscles would bulge underground
Your demons would all be around
Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd end up just like me <start> Wer macht da ich nicht mehr alleine bin
Wer gibt der grten Unordnung den Sinn
Wo ist der Engel der mein Leben verschnt
Das Mdchen das ich schon so lang ersehnt
Wer hat genau die gleichen Hobbys wie ich
Wer findet Zwergewerfen kniglich
Wer ist genau wie ich in mich verliebt
Ich hab geglaubt da es sowas nicht gibt
All diese Fragen machen mich verrckt

Ich hab durch Zufall die Antwort gekriegt
Die Antwort bist Du
Die Antwort bist Du
Die Antwort bist Du
Die Antwort bist Du
Die Antwort bist Du
Die Antwort bist Du
Die Antwort bist Du
Die Antwort bist Du
Wer braucht Stunden um sich anzumalen
Fr wen mu ich jetzt immer mitbezahlen
Wer bestimmt das kulturelle Programm
Wer ist mal Schlange und mal ein zahmes Lamm
Mir zu befehlen hat niemand geschafft

Wer wrde es wagen Wer hat die Kraft
Die Antwort bist Du
Die Antwort bist Du
Die Antwort bist Du
Die Antwort bist Du
Wer sttzt mich wenn ich mal betrunken bin
Und seh' ich schlecht aus wer guckt nicht genau hin
Und wenn ich singe wer behlt die Ruh
Ich geb' die Antwort und die Antwort bist Du
Die Antwort bist Du
 <start> what i need is good advice
cooked on plates around me
rubber hands and silly friends
they sit on my worldwand
someone's soul a sweet sea snow  someone sow a sweet sea soup
i could swim in proudly
and we might swim like laughing ducks
in your pink loveglove alone
there we go changing again  here we come changing them
pink love again  here we come again
My hands can make yours's warm again
if not absorb in blanket
are you in need of teething
and they were on your neck
And if I had volcano boots
for swimming in the volcano
do you know the origins of laughing ducks
oh what's the matter with those birds
there you go changing again  here you come changing them
There you go again  here we come again
what you needs a happy farm
with happy goats and sheep
what I need's a happy arm
to swing ya' round like father <start> Incomprehensible
Paddy came down to Voodoo City
Met a lady on Bourbon Street
She was dark she was beautiful
Swept that boy right off his feet
Runnin' from the man in New York City
I fled down south to beat the chill
But the Iceman had me in his sights
For one too many unpaid bills
Oh oh oh oh Voodoo City
Oh oh oh oh Voodoo world
Oh oh oh oh Voodoo City
For God sakes keep your hands off my Voodoo girl
Marie Laveau was the lady in question
I fell beneath her crescent spell
Nights spent drinkin' in the quarter
Soon turned into a living hell
She said she knew how to protect me
From all the evil in my past
But New York is not scorned so easy
Iceman tracked me down at last
Oh oh oh oh Voodoo City
Oh oh oh oh Voodoo world
Oh oh oh oh Voodoo City
For God sakes keep your hands off my Voodoo girl
Moonlight on the lazy river
Mist around the old gaslight
Heard his footsteps on Toulouse Street
Disappear into the creole night
Candle waver on the altar
Marie she dance on the naked floor
Flame light up her sacred body
I hear a key turn in the door
I scream at her You have betrayed me
The hurt explodes inside her eyes
She throws herself across my body
The bullet chokes her Voodoo cries
A raven rises from her body
The Iceman stares in disbelief
I crash through her garret window
Race like fire down Bourbon Street
Oh oh oh oh Voodoo City
Oh oh oh oh Voodoo world
Oh oh oh oh Voodoo City
For God sakes keep your hands off my Voodoo girl
Oh oh oh oh Voodoo City
Incomprehensible <start> You try to make this last
But your candles burn too fast
Divided before you were born
Were you divided from your former you
You'll never make it far
Well it's time so let go of my arm
You're dying north of 
You are destined for its solitude
Just pull the cover over your eyes
Or do what just feels good
It's easy to be content about your life
Until it's over
Why does this feel so good
Won't somebody tell me while I'm alive
Why can't I withstand
my lust is so much stronger than my love for life

Will you take over when I'm bleeding
Watch me squeeze out every pint I've got
It's over
I can feel it
Wellrehearsed accidents prepare to stop
And I am trying
Know what you want before you start
I read your diary 
I skipped right to the end 
Empty pages 
For days you didn't want to live 
Too late to decide my fate or rewrite autobiographies
And though I just woke up I feel that I'm washed up
You're always fake 
Because you've been betrayed 
It's your fault I can believe handshakes
I've gone far enough that's why I'm washed up
It's over I mean it
It's over I believe it now
I'm washed up <start> You and I are living heavyhearted
Are we just another long goodbye
In this land of the left and leaving
We know that we gotta try
How long can we go on
Here in the middle we won't give a little
And how long can we go on like this
Oh won't you tell me
How long can we go on
Heart break is what it takes sometimes you see
But what about you and me
How long
Forgiveness is a heavy promise
Its a language that's so hard to speak
I'm hearing whispers by the darkest voices
But I know what you mean to me 
How long can we go on
Here in the middle we won't give a little
And how long can we go on like this
Oh won't you tell me
How long can we go on
Heart break is what it takes sometimes you see
But what about you and me
How long
And all we are we are
And what will be will be
You and I we gotta find
A burned up bridge to each others side
Its the only way to see
How long can we go on
How long can we go on
Barely living when nobody's giving in
How long can we go on like this
Oh won't you tell me
How long can we go on
Heart break is what it takes sometimes you see
But what about you and me
How long <start> Can ye no hush your weepin'
All the wee lambs are sleepin'
Birdies are nestlin' nestlin' together
Dream Angus is hirplin' oer the heather
Dreams to sell fine dreams to sell
Angus is here wi' dreams to sell
Hush ye my baby and sleep without fear
Dream Angus has brought you a dream my dear.
List' to the curlew cryin'
Faintly the echos dyin'
Even the birdies and the beasties are sleepin'
But my bonny bairn is weepin' weepin' <start> What else can you do
Where else can you go
Why won't they call me back
There is no one in the end
No end in the end.
I'm burning my own hair.
No more cellophane
No more cellophane
No more people.
What else can you do
Where else can you go
Why won't they contact me
When the story's over
The drama's over
I'm singing to myself.
No more cellophane
No more cellophane
No more people oh no.
No more people.
I hate I hate I hate I hate
I hate I hate I hate I hate
I hate I hate I hate I hate
I hate I hate I hate I hate

When the story's over
The drama's over

No more people oh no
No more people. <start> Yeah alright now alright alright alright
Alright alright alright alright alright
Listen
It took me some time to believe my eyes
Well thinking back now I must have been blind
Just sixteen years old and I'm coming on strong
When she said Yes my resistance was gone
So come with me hold on tight
Make it together light up the night
'Cause it's love so strong
And her legs are too long
I don't care if it's wrong
If it's right no no right now
You might think that I'm just having my fun
It's so much more than just a hit and run
You've got to find the stick yeah and my head it'll spin yeah
If loving is wrong I'm guilty as sin
So come with me hold on tight
Make it together light up the night
'Cause it's love so strong
And her legs are too long
I don't care if it's wrong
If it's right no no right now come on
Your vision never fades away
I keep on thinking 'bout you night and day
Hold my hand and let me hold you tight
You know babe gonna love you tonight
You know baby I wanted to ooh you
I wanted to lick you down
So come with me hold on tight
Make it together light up the night
'Cause it's love so strong
And her legs are too long
I don't care if it's wrong
If it's right no no right now
Ooh well it's love so strong
And her legs are too long
I don't care if it's wrong
If it's right no no right now
'Cause our loves so strong
And her legs legs are too long
I don't care if it's wrong
If it's right no no right now
Oh right now oh love's so strong
What an absolute bugger <start> when you're young
life moves so fast 
like a flash before your eyes
it never lasts 
friends you think
they'll be there tomorrow 
but now i'm just left
in fucking sorrow 
friday night we'd go to the shows
but now you feed your habit
and you're addiction grows
whatever happened to the times of the past
cause when you're punks forever
it is meant to last
got a call in the middle of the night 
they found you dead after you lost in a fight
and for some dope you lost your life 
they left you to bleed with a fucking knife ...
Chorus
and now you're dead dead dead dead today
and in a flash you've gone you've gone away 
and now you're dead dead dead dead today
scars forever are left are left to stay. <start> Oye Jose escchame
Que no lo hice queriendo
Yo te fui a buscar y me li
Por cierto qu da ms bueno
Qu buena est la madre de mi amigo Jose
La miro y me recuerda aquel momento que s
Que ella abri la puerta y yo pregunt por l
Me dice que se ha ido que no va a volver
Vuela mi fantasa vuela alto y la ves tumbada en
El sof y yo dentro del chalet
Revivo aquel momento que me hizo perder
Esos pocos papeles que yo puedo tener
Y ahora estoy quedndome muy loco
Qu va qu va
Lo que yo estoy es un poquito nervioso
Es que la madre de Jose me est volviendo loco
Y no la voy a dejar porque lo siento y siento todo
Qu culpa tengo yo si esa puerta no la he abierto
Ha sido su madre que quera que entrara dentro
Sub las escaleras del humilde chalet
Con su madre en mis brazos rodendome
Tumbado en esa cama vi a mi amigo Jose
En un portarretratos ah mirndome
Pas lo que pas y ahora no duermo bien
Lo hice casi obligado no saba que hacer
Espero que l lo entienda que lo sepa ver
Fue un momento muy duro lo va a entender
Y ahora estoy quedndome muy loco
Qu va qu va
Lo que yo estoy es un poquito nervioso
Es que la madre de Jose me est volviendo loco
Y no la voy a dejar porque lo siento y siento todo
Qu culpa tengo yo si esa puerta no la he abierto
Ha sido su madre que quera que entrara dentro
Mira to entindeme
Que no soy un mal to
Que soy muy sensible
Y lo hice con cario
No quiero que pienses
Que de ti me ro.
Que me gusta tu madre Jose <start> I wish that I could touch the sky
Elevate me
I hope that I don't burn my eyes
As I drift free
Don't think that I can help myself
Guess it's true
Polythene Polythene Girl
Wrap me up in a cellophane world
Polythene Polythene Girl
I'm breaking the seal never thought I would
I wish that I could heal myself
Addicted to you
Wrap me up in cotton wool
Just to feel new
Don't think that I can help myself
But it's true
Polythene Polythene Girl
Wrap me up in a cellophane world
Polythene Polythene Girl
I'm breaking the seal never thought I would
Suffocate elevate
Suffocate elevate
But it's true
Polythene Polythene Girl
Wrap me up in a cellophane world
Polythene Polythene Girl
I'm breaking the seal never thought I would <start> Her hair is like a crow's nest she's got glitter in her eye
Her smile is like a jacko'lantern trying not to cry
She's been living been living pretty hard
Since her old man up and died a year ago
And I see her every morning while she's walking to the check
She holds her head like she's got something heavy hanging 'round her neck
Puts some money in her purse
And hides somewhere he won't expect before she goes
Don't you think someone should take you home
Don't you think someone should take you home
Well she stole more than a little from her folks in Cartersville
With that wrong foot in that right boot left a lot of room to fill
With one foot on the platform and a lot of time to kill
They shoulda' known
Don't you think someone should take you home
Don't you think someone should take you home
Well I haven't seen her lately guess I just assumed the worst
But I think I kinda miss her standing there with her lips pursed
First thing in the morning eaning up against the church
Like it's your own
Don't you think someone should take you home
Don't you think someone should take you home
Don't you think someone should take you home <start> I never knew
I never knew that everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a cue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth
But that's how it's got to be
It's coming down to nothing more than apathy
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears
Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on your mind
Let's rearrange
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
Say that we agree and then never change
Soften a bit until we all just get along
But that's disregard
Find another friend and you discard
As you lose the argument in a cable car
Hanging above as the canyon comes between
Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on your mind
Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on your mind
And suddenly I become a part of your past
I'm becoming the part that don't last
I'm losing you and it's effortless
Without a sound we lose sight of the ground
In the throw around
Never thought that you wanted to bring it down
I won't let it go down till we torch it ourselves
Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on your mind
Everyone knows
She's on your mind
Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
I'm in over my head
I'm in over my
Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on your mind <start> Balet naszych serc wci krci si

Odbija twoj twarz
Odkrywa strzpy marze

It's pretty simple no poll tax <start> If you ever change your mind
About leaving leaving me behind
Ohoh bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
I know I laughed when you left
But now I know I only hurt myself
Ohoh bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
I'll give you jewellery and money too
That ain't all that ain't all I'll do for you
Oh if you bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
You know I'll always be your slave
'Til I'm buried buried in my grave
Oh honey bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me <start> Falling down from a rooftop

End <start> I sit beside the dark
Beneath the mire
Cold gray dusty day
The morning lake
Drinks up the sky
Katmandu I'll soon be seeing you
And your strange bewildering time
Will hold me down
Pass me my hat and coat
Lock up the cabin
Slow night treat me right
Until I go
Be nice to know
Katmandu I'll soon be touching you
And your strange bewildering time
Will hold me down
La la la la la la
La la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la
Chop me some broken wood
We'll start a fire
White warm light the dawn
And help me see
Old Satan's tree
Katmandu I'll soon be touching you
And your strange bewildering time
Will keep me home <start> Tell tell me the reasons why
Tell me every secret you've been told
Cause everybody knows they're dangerous
Hey let me try that wonder stuff
The stuff that lets you look at them and nod
Smile and say thank god it wasn't us
When it all goes to pieces
And it won't be long
Once you've had your fun
We'll still be sitting here
Waiting 'til the big push comes
Now the moment we've been waiting for
The moment that you'll finally realise
Your promises are lies
They turn to dust
Time time changes everything
Can turn you from a hero to a dog
Living in a fog like the rest of us
When it all goes to pieces
And it won't be long
Once you've had your fun
We'll all just sit around
Wait until the big push comes
Write write me a pretty poem
Make believe that paradise is here
Future's coming clear
Sun through the clouds
And when it all goes to pieces
And it won't be long
Once you've had your fun
We'll still be sitting here
Waiting 'til the big push comes
And when it all goes to pieces
And it won't be long
Once you've had your fun
We'll all just sit around
And wait until the big push comes <start> Day of exit forever stained
The final choice to pass the pain
Racing heartbeat panicked breath
To trade useless life for death
Passage out strength caves in
Dismal flame flickers from the din
Thread disconnecting you shiver
Away from the sick of it all
Which way is up
Which way is out
Sinking screaming
The abyss opens down
If you could deny
If you could forgive
If you could just let go
Behind those sleepless eyes
Blinding fatal light
From yourself you fall
The day would you deny
The world could you forgive
It's crime that led to yours <start> Nunca hay un adis total
Entre dos nieris
Siempre es nos volveremos a ver
En algn lugar del tiempo
No hay olvido cuando existe
La amistad y el respeto
El recuerdo de momentos entraables
De alegras y secretos
Nos volveremos a ver
Porque siempre hay un regreso
Por eso cont con eso
Pongo mi mano en el fuego por vos
Soy un chico de familia
Y no soy ninguna carlito
Vivi las tumbas de la vida
Soy un poeta maldito <start> VERSE 
Before last night I was down on my luck
There was nothing going my way
Before last night wasn't feeling the love
No reason for a smile on my face
But I was always told You could turn it around
Do it for the light of day
So get yourself together head out on the town
The music gets you feelin' okay
REFRAIN
Now I'm on a roll and I'm losing control cause
I got that sunshine it's like the world is mine
I can't deny I'm feelin' good 
Can't stop from smiling I'm bottled lightning

All my heartbreak my long and rainy days
Are gone and now I can't complain

No one even calling my phone

When you're not near me I miss ya
And nothing could ever replace
The high when I kiss ya
Out of sight but on the mind strong
In the waiting place singing my same old song
It's a lonely lullaby
I wrote it with only you in mind
It goes something like
Lonely days roll on by
When you're not near me I miss ya
And nothing could ever replace
The high when I kiss ya
There's only so much a wallet size picture can do
And though it's nice it's no substitute for you
Oh when you're far I want you near
When you are there I want you here
It's like I told you
Lonely days roll on by
When you're not near me I miss ya
And nothing could ever replace
The high when I kiss ya
Oh I can't wait to get my hands on you
Satisfy a thing or two
Counting the days 'til you know when
Time brings us together again
Lonely days roll on by
When you're not near me I miss ya
And nothing could ever replace
The high when I kiss ya <start> When you're in love
Some things you take for granted
Until someone pulls it apart
And leaves you with half of your heart
How do I trade
The best I had for less
Without giving up
Should I slowly accept that we'll be no more than just friends
How do I know
When to let go
I know what I'm feeling inside
But part of me still wants to try
So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear
When all that you are
Is all I need and more
There's no winning bets
The battle's just begun
I know it's over
But I still feel the same
You'll always remain number one
'Cause letting go
More and so much
I know what I'm feeling inside
But part of me still wants to try
So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear
When all that you are
Is all I need and more
So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear
When all that you are
Is all I need and more
Letting go
More and so much
I know what I'm feeling inside
But part of me still wants to try
So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear
When all that you are
Is all I need and more
So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear
When all that you are
Is all I need and more
So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear
When all that you are
Is all I need and more
So tell me
Where do we go from here

When all that you are
Is all I need and more <start> Over Prudence Hall we fall unassuming quiet all
Peaceful town square we float in on streams of air

White steeple church we perch upon
The fencepost trees poles wire lines
We stay up high birds eye view
Silly Humans why burn your bridges down
Should you go with the flow

Quick kick your feet around
Should you never condone flash flood for medicine
Live where you don't belong
Just 'cause don't judge your weatherman
Every year convention here one by one we come
Survey the quality of your damage done
Blue Jay Jack Daw Logger Head
Kingbird Whippoorwill Blackbird Black Bill ed
Magpie Finch Raven Hermit Thrush Blackcrow
Crush flow floods come from
Rain falls from the sky drinks back the flood
It cycles like the leaves

Silly Humans
Conscientious objectors


We know it's only human nature is not kind
Even birds must take their bath sometimes

We're your bitter partisan familiar welcome enemy
Devoted couriers cleanse and drain binge and purge <start> What do you think they would say
If I stood up and I walked away
Nobody here really understand me
And so I'll wave goodbye I'm fine
Tones of home said
You don't know the way I'm living
You don't like me
Tones of home tones of home
And so I'll wave goodbye.
I'm flyin' I'm flyin' home
And I always thought this would be
The land of milk and honey
Oh but I came to find out
That it's all hate and money
And there's a canopy of greed holding me down.
See I'm so high to you so I'll fade away
I said your on your own
Your mom and daddy said
That your sister said and your brothers saying
Everybody is saying
Everybody is saying I eye God I gotta go <start> I must have dreamed a thousand dreams
Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
They're moving into the street
Now did you read the news today
They say the danger has gone away
But I can see the fire's still alight
They're burning into the night
There's too many men too many people
Making too many problems
And there's not much love to go around
Can't you see this is the land of confusion
This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in
Oh Superman where are you now
When every thing's gone wrong somehow
Men of steel these men of power
I'm losing control by the hour
This is the time this is the place
So we look for the future
But there's not much love to go around
Tell me why this is the land of confusion
This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in
I remember long ago
When the sun was shining
And all the stars were bright all through the night
In the wake up this madness as I held you tight
So long ago
I won't be coming home tonight
My generation will put it right
We're not just making promises
That we know we'll never keep
There's too many men too many people
Making too many problems
And there's not much love to go around
Can't you see this is the land of confusion
Now this is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth fighting for
This is the world we live in
And these are the names we're given
Stand up and let's start showing
Just where our lives are going to <start> Hey cool kid hey cool kid
Why don't you want anyone around
Hey cool kid hey cool kid
Won't you sing to me like I'm on the ground
Won't you sing to me like I'm on the ground

To hang around

Really got me down
Really got me down
Hey cool kid hey cool kid
Why don't you want anyone around
Hey cool kid hey cool kid
Won't you talk to me like I'm on the ground

Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields where they lay
In fields where they
Lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night
That was so deep

Born is the king of israel
They looked up
And saw a star
Shining in the east
Beyond them far
And to the earth
It gave great light
And so it continued both day and night

Born is the king of Israel
And let us all
With one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly lord
That hath in heaven and earth of naught
And with his blood mankind hath bought

Those little boys are just fooling around with your heart
Whatcha gonna do now that you're all alone
You need a rock not a rollin' stone
Yeah so when a boy
just ain't enough
You need a man made of stronger stuff
Get ready
Rock steady all night long
Rock steady till the light of dawn
Slow and easy tried and true
Rock steady
Just me and you
You need somebody who will help you with your heavy load
Well I've been there baby
Lord give me a rock and roll
Well I can bend but I won't break
cause you ain't got what I can take
So when you're tired of those little girls
you want a woman that'll rock your world
Get ready
Rock steady all night long
Rock steady till the light of dawn
Slow and easy tried and true
Rock steady
Just me and you <start> so far so far away
im sorry im absent minded

help build your confidence
im on a hopeless misson
im a walking contradiction
Chorus
i've got a fucking headache
my brain splitting in two
i've gt to much to say
i live my life as a...headache x
time spend involved to deep
we're not in shallow waters
take a chance believe in me
we'll go to a higher level
when faith blinds your eyes
you're looking for the open arms
i'll guide you in my mind
and let you sink to the bottom
i'll take what i wanna take
i have nothing else left to give
my fuse is burning up
i've got to leave this place
i dont want to be your man
dont want to understand
you can say what you feel
my mind is deaf to your fiction
i've got a fucking headache... <start> How did I get here I heard a rumour
From your girlfriend's sister that you knew me
And you end up dancing close up to me
I know that I broke the rule already
She asked me if I'm single going steady
I just trod my head and took a step off into the dark
Standing on the block of my tires
Don't dance on the lights cause the bears eat the pretty ones
We are like the islands divided
Jump to the beat of the party line 
There is nobody here but your body dear
Jump to the beat of the party line
Stay
You stay
I am on this morning quite distracted
The talk of all begins and our emotion
I am leaving many people feeling
Worse than before
People like to drive the cars and smoke up
People like to sit inside and toke up
People like to shoot at things with borrowed guns
And knives
I am happy to look and run
Where were you when I was king in this part of town
Now the days of glory are gone
Jump to the beat of the party line 
There is nobody here but your body dear
Jump to the beat of the party line
Jump to the beat of the party line 
There is nobody here but your body dear
Nobody here but your body dear
Jump to the beat of the party line 
There is nobody here but your body dear
Jump to the beat of the party line
Jump to the beat of the party line 
There is nobody here but your body dear
Nobody here but your body dear <start> Blake says no one ever really loved him
They just faked it to get money from the government
And Blake thinks angels grow when you plant angel dust
He shakes his pretty head
But darling trust me trust me
He's no valentine
Though he said he would be mine
His heart is in Alaska all the time
Blake stays underwater for the most part
He collects loose change for All Tomorrow's Parties
And when Blake dates girls with tattoos of the pyramids
He breaks their hearts
By saying it's not permanent
But in his velvet mind
He believes with all his might
We'll all go to Alaska when we die
Blake makes friends but only for a minute
He prefers the things he orders from the internet
And Blake's been having trouble with his head again
He takes his pills
But never takes his medicine
Like Candy in his prime
He likes his shirts to shine
And when it's two o'clock it feels like nine
Blake says he is sorry he got through to me
If it's okay he'll call right back and talk to the machine
Blake says it looks like acid rain today
He takes the fish inside
He's very kind that way
But just like Caroline
He doesn't seem to mind
The globe is getting warmer all the time <start> I like getting drunk alone
late at night turn off the telephone
let the stupid world pass me by
success or mess I don't care
I just wanna get high
but if you think that I'm running
away from my problems
you must be out of your mind
Walt Disney was right
it could happen tonight
it's small world after all
I want control I'm gonna get it
rip it right out of your hands
don't you ever forget it
you don't like my lyrics
you don't like the way I sing
why did you have to go and to do that
now you've ruined everything
couldn't let it be
couldn't set it free
you took everything away from me
gonna be some changes around here
I want control I'm gonna get it
rip it right out of your mouth
don't you ever forget it
it just comes naturally
as easy as     
I'm gonna rip it right out of your mind
I think you're a little slow on the uptake
we don't have no relief funds
we don't give out handouts here
we don't tolerate fools
we don't need no bodhisattvas
we don't tolerate fools
we don't need no bodhisattvas
the walls are slanted so now that you 're in
you can never get out again
look out control freak
look out control freak
it's happening to you. <start> Hey god told us that we made
a very big sin
You don't know where
to begin
He says turn the other cheek
but that seems kind of weak
I just want to beat up
beat up the meek
He says you be a better man
if you'd stick with the plan
But I don't think I can
not with that kind of man
You love to be cruel
You love to be cruel
I'm not a good tool
'Cause you love to be cruel
What now
The cross has been greased
but I don't feel the heat
nor the peace in the street
everybody feels it
So just bury it in the pit
with the best of the sick
ideological shit
You love to be cruel
You love to be cruel
I'm not a good tool
'Cause you love to be cruel
You love to be cruel
You love to be cruel
You love to be cruel
You love to be cruel <start> Mary pretends she so insane so insane so insane
Mary pretends she so insane so insane so insane
She just sits back and laughs at the pain
Laughs at the pain laughs at the pain
Mary pretends she so insane so insane so insane
Falling down of her mind
Gives her everything she's wanted from the world
Close her eyes drift inside so alive
She wants to know what it feels like
She wants to know how to fly
She wants to know what it feels like to die
Goodbye <start> I memorized the note you sent
Go to all the places that we went
I seem to search the whole day through
For anything that's part of you
I kept a ribbon from your hair
A breath of perfume lingers there
It helps to cheer me when I'm blue
Anything that's part of you
Oh how it hurts to miss you so
When I know you don't love me anymore
To go on needing you
Knowing you don't need me
No reason left for me to live
What can I take what can I give
When I'd give all of someone new
For anything that's part of you <start> Remember last time you know how it went
I thought i served you all too well
And all along i had something in my eye
How long can we go this close
How soon before my laughs die
If i had to tell you something about myself
I don't think that you could have handled it well
You don't put up with so much stuff that you're cool
How long did i really last how soon
Were you sick of me too
Why'd don't we just go and ruin everything by
Taking this westbound i know i seem too keen
We'll only stop to talk about our feelings
How good did you really feel
How much was he willing to spare
I've never written a love song but i will for you <start> Let's try Kids Are Alright
I don't mind for the guy dancing with my girl
Bells chime I know them all pretty well
But I know if I don't I'll go out of my mind
So I leave her behind where the kids are alright
The kids are alright
Sometimes I feel I gotta get away
Bells chime I know I gotta get away
But I know if I don't I'll go out of my mind
So I leave her behind where the kids are alright
The kids are alright
I know if I'd go things'd be a lot better for her
I tried so hard but her folks wouldn't let her <start> You walked in
Just like smoke
With a little come on come on come on
In your walk
Well come on
I've been waitin'
Are you waitin
For my move well I'm makin' it
So tell me baby can you shake it
If I can move it with ya
Will you let me take it
I'll be down on my knees
Screamin' take me take me take me take me
I'm yours
I've never felt so out of control
You don't even know what you're doin' to me
Come on and do it to me
Don'tcha stop
Come on come on
Come on little rabbit
Show me where you got it
Cause I know you got a habit <start> She longs for peace it's her revenge
She's a stark white pale horse rider and hell's just around the bend
She's kids to raise she got bills to feed
And her pride is a higher horse than some bum of a man upon a steed
The handle's rough she works it smooth hardened by the pace
The hands get tough and it transfers through
Before the lines can reach her face
She flies like a kite held at the other end
Tuggin' down on a cinnamon thread she's shreddin' in the wind
But she reads the Bible she believes the light
She thumbs through the pages 'til the Good Book smolders and ignites
She cries late at night
No one to hold her tight like she should be cinnamindy
Hoarse and sore her scratchy voice soars
Through her song like a rusty cello
Now I lay me down to sleep lights out it's time to dream
And days you'll find she make everybody smile with a last good laugh
The days are long but she blows it all off with a wink and a little sass
She flies like a kite held at the other end
Tuggin' down on her cinnamon thread she's dragged in the wind
But she reads the Bible she believes the light
She thumbs through the pages 'til the Good Book smolders and ignites
She cries late at night
No one to hold her tight like she should be cinnamindy
But she reads the Bible she believes the light
She thumbs through the pages 'til the Good Book smolders and ignites
She cries late at night mama just down the hall
She cries late at night mama curled up like a wrecking ball
She cries late at night
There's no one to hold her tight like she should be
But by the morning light the cinnamon's on her cheeks
But by the morning light she's back to being cinnamindy <start> I'm waiting here in patience
Am I waiting all in vain
Will I see you will I touch you
Will I hear you call my name
Come and make
Ten steps to every one step that I take
Nobody comes and nobody goes
No one is happy and no one has woes.
Everything lasting ever the same
Nothing is ending nothing can change.
The good lord always has been
Always will be ever the same.
And confusion mixed with illusion
All years only turn again
With one and one hundred names
Had all the rooms our key is to change.
Nobody comes and nobody goes
No one is happy and no one has woes
Everything lasting nothing can change
Nothing is ending ever the same <start> The man who preached the funeral
Said it really was a simple way to die
He laid down to rest one afternoon
And never opened up his eyes
They hired me and Fred and Joe
To dig the grave and carry up some chairs
It took us seven hours and I guess
We must've drunk a case of beer
I guess I oughta go and watch them
Put him down but I don't own the suit
And anyway when they start talkin' 'bout the fire
And hell well I get spooked
So I'll just sit here in my truck
And act like I don't know him when they pass
Anyway when they're all through
I've got to go to work and mow the grass
Well here they come and who's that ridin'
In that big ole shiny limousine
Look at all that chrome I do believe that
That's the sharpest thing I've seen
That must belong to his rich uncle
Someone said he owned a great big farm
When they get parked I'll mosey down
And look it over that won't do no harm
Well that must be the widow in the car
And would you take a look at that
That sure is a pretty dress
You know some women do look good in black
He's not even in the ground
And they say that his track is up for sale
They say she took it pretty hard
But you can't tell too much behind a veil
Well listen ain't that pretty
When that bugler plays the military taps
I think that when you's in the war
They always hired and played a song like that
Well here I am and there they go
And I guess you'd just call it my bad luck
I hope he'll rest in peace but trouble is
That fellow owes me forty bucks <start> 
You tell me you're leaving well why don't you go
Could it be that your heart keeps telling you no
The door is wide open but be sure when you start
When you walk out that door you walk out of my heart
Why are you waiting you said we were through
Could it be that you need me the way I need you
Walk slowly my darling think it over be smart
When you walk out that door you walk out of my heart
 guitar 
Why are you waiting... <start> It's not like it used to be ancient history
Why are we throwing those stones
Cold sweat and blistering sounds like a plea to me
Don't just go throwing your words save your breath and be still
Save your breath and be still
No other drummers have went quite this dark
There's still light but you can't close the 
You won't know if you're coming in light 'til your ship has arrived
Relish this moment 'til death do us part
I want answers before it's too late
Take your time old man take your time
Take your time old man take your time
These vultures are happy to wait
Savor the sympathy one final victory
Bring me  look it's not hard to find
Scariness under your bed save your breath and be still
Save your breath and be still
No other drummers have went quite this dark
There's still light but you can't close the 
You won't know if you're coming in light til your ship has arrived
Relish this moment 'til death do us part
I want answers before it's too late
Take your time old man
These vultures are happy to wait
I'd like to forgive and forget but I can't
It's just one of the ways that I'm petty
I'll leave you to carry this weight to burden the rest of your days
I'll leave you to carry this weight all alone
And no single regret to the grave
It's not like it used to be ancient history
Why are we throwing those stones
Cold sweat and blistering sounds like a plea to me
Don't just go throwing your words save your breath and be still
Save your breath and be still
No other drummers have went quite this dark
There's still light but you can't close the 
You won't know if you're coming in light 'til your ship has arrived
Relish this moment 'til death do us part
I want answers before it's too late
Take your time old man
These vultures are happy to wait <start> Wash me clean again
And take me down in your water
And try to make me understand
Cause in this life that I live
I might have grown a little harder
But so have these times
Where we just war with words
And fight for rights to take a life
In the name of peace
But we cannot hide behind our picket fences
Abortion lines and worn defenses
I don't understand
Touch and go it survives
In this land of our fathers
The bleeding and the needing
Are left behind
You say one name out aloud
While inside you feel another
But there is some comfort in pleasing the crowd
So you just raise your hands up to the sky
And scream a verse that will make them cry
But when those politics
They don't stick around
Those words fight back
They'll take you down
And you won't understand
So Lord search my soul
And find the need to break this stone
And plant a seed and find me
Find a place for me inside <start> Sayonara
Adios auf wiedersehen farewell
Adieu good night guten abend
Here's one last song you can sell
Lets call it burning bridges
It's a sing along as well
Ciao adieu good nacht guten abend
Play it for your friends in hell
Someone shut the lights off
Turn the page
The stories I could write
I've seen a million faces
And I've lived a couple lives
Here's our history for all to see
The smiles and all the scars
First the rising then the falling
Call this chapter shooting stars
That must sound good from where you are
Sayonara
Adios auf wiedersehen farewell
Adieu good night guten abend
Here's one last song you can sell
Let's call it burning bridges
It's a sing along as well
Ciao adieu good nacht guten abend
Play it for your friends in hell
Check the box
Mark this day
There's nothing more to say
After thirty years of loyalty
They let you dig the grave
Now maybe you could learn to sing
Or even strum along
I'll give you half the publishing
You're why I wrote this song
Everybody sing along <start> Ballad and dagger amazing grace
Sons of rock bottom take your rightful place
Glad tooth and top hat with an ace up your sleeve
Show me that pistol so I can believe
Chorus
Make glad
Find the beauty in the broken
Make glad
May your heart always be open
Make glad
Keep an eye out for your brother
Make glad
And I will see you in the other
Turpentine babies with one foot in the south
Turned out the turnkey for runnin' his mouth
Jump said the sheriff Get up out of that hole
Get in the line and do what you're told
Chorus <start> Drink up baby stay up all night
With the things you could do you won't but you might
The potential you'll be that you'll never see
The promises you'll only make
Drink up with me now forget all about
The pressure of days do what I say
And I'll make you okay drive them away
The image is stuck in your head
People you've been before
That you don't want around anymore
That push and shove and won't bend to your will
I'll keep them still
Drink up baby look at the stars
Ill kiss you again between the bars
Where I'm seeing you there with your hands in the air
Waiting to finally be caught
Drink up one more time and I'll make you mine
Keep you apart deep in my heart
Separate from the rest where I like you the best
Keep the things you forgot
People you've been before
That you don't want around anymore
That push and shove and won't bend to your will
I'll keep them still <start> Did you intimidate her
Her mother says you wouldn't let her use the phone
Or were you intoxicated
passed the point of knowing what was going on

One less and she was gone
And everybody knows by now
They're tired of me whining
But I'm hole now
I'm hole because she's strong
I'm hole now
But I'll break before the dawn
You don't have to know me
You don't have to believe
I'm sick of all you people
I'm sick of what you see
But I'm hole now
I'm hole because she's strong
I'm hole now
But I'll break before the dawn
I don't know what's right
I can't take care of my life
But you don't have to worry
I won't ask you to
There's not much strength in this body
Not much to hold on to
I'm getting weaker now
But I'm still standing
But I'm hole now
I'm hole because she's strong
I'm hole now
But I'll break before the dawn
But I'm hole now
I'm hole because she's strong
I'm hole now
But I'll break before the dawn <start> This trespass
My weaker wings couldn't carry much of anything
But my temptress
You take a toll on the vengeance's oh merciful
Defenseless against this tide
It's the coming storm the counter line
Replace this with just my hands and just my will
You'll all be damned
One small lie a test of faith
Just to testify attempted fate
Repentant a fallen son
The die is cast thy will be done
You got caught in the better lie
You fell off at the fault line into the sun
You got caught in the better lie
You fell off at the fault line
No blood spilled upon this ground
A silent night without a sound
But past this we're reading woe
It's another trial
You got caught in the better lie
You fell off at the fault line into the sun
You got caught in the better lie
You fell off at the fault line
You got caught in the better lie
You fell off at the fault line <start> Saber cosas que nadie sabe
errar contigo mareaditos.
te trajo el viento y te am como un nio.
eso no es gran cosa pero algo hay que escribir.
hierbas de asia de mil aromas
mezclado en ellos an te espero.
como un rey de ajedrez torpe y absurdo
muere otra tarde gris de domingo.
todo lo que hago es quererte.
He perdido el tiempo hundido en la prosa vil
improbables y benignos regresan los mitos de ayer.
he perdido el tiempo que pas lejos de ti.
Mientras cae la lluvia a la luz de una vela
leo tus viejas cartas mis viejas canciones.
sol de inviernos suaves perdidos para siempre
risas que murieron con el viento helado.
vuelve el oscuro animal que hay dentro de m
a pacer en el radiante azul del ayer
vuelve la cancin que nos hizo enamorar
y la noche marroqui de tus besos.
djame oler en tu piel todo aquello que perd.
He perdido el tiempo hundido en la prosa vil
improbables y benignos regresan los mitos de ayer.
he perdido el tiempo que pas lejos de ti.
Saber cosas que nadie sabe
errar contigo mareaditos.
prosa vil de la vida sucia eficacia
que los sueos te borren locos y libres. <start> Well if you wanna rock
I got to be your rockin' horse
If you want to roll lord
I could roll you
Right out the door yes I could
We'll shake the world yeah
When it's time to crash
But when I get home tonight lord
I guess I got to shake myself lookie here
You need some lovin'

You fucked your mind baby
It's a good thing to do
Now do the shake

Do the shake oh
The rattlesnake shake
Now do the shake yeah
Chuck away chuck away
chuck chuck chuck chuck > yakakakaw <start> I turned on a T.V. station and
Lipread with the sound turned down
It was ProCeleb mouthtomouth resuscitation
With Esther Rantzen
Playing the one who's drowned
In a room next door a couple is fighting
But isn't that just one of love's charms
When moods change as fast as lightning
And fifteen minutes later you're
Lying in each other's arms
And you're gone
They say that it's better to have loved and lost
Than never to have loved at all
But if you sit down and count the cost of
All those losses
There's no profit at all
This city gets crazy at Christmas
Glitter guards the crucifix all over the place
Its head gets too big for its body
And its mouth gets
Too big for its face
And you're gone
Never throw away an old newspaper
Everyday's rich with its current accounts
Prince visits Philippines and parliament debates it
Back page column five
Somebody's wedding's announced
Sunday night's the night for loving
And squeezing out the weekend's last drops
Sunday night's the night for forgiving
Maybe that's why
They shut the shops
And you're gone
One day you wake up
And all the pain you've given out gets returned
But I'm not sorry now
I've payed for what I've learned
And you're gone
I turned on a T.V. station and
Lipread with the sound turned down
It was the Church of Christ playing the Price Is Right
Where everybody starves
While Leslie Crowther counts <start> Give me faith in the world faith in the world pull it away
Give me faith in the world faith in the world pull it away
But I don't know how to love
I don't know how to trust myself
But I'll do my best to suffer with some grace
Give me faith in the world faith in the world with our pain
Give me faith in the world faith in the world with our pain our...
But I don't know how to love
I don't know how to trust myself
But I'll do my best to suffer with some grace <start> Well
I have a little dreidel
I made it out of clay
And when it's dry and ready
Then dreidel I shall play.
Oh dreidel dreidel dreidel
I made it out of clay
And when it's dry and ready
Then dreidel I will play.
It has a lovely body
With legs so short and thin
And when it gets all tired
It drops and I will win.
Oh dreidel dreidel dreidel
I made it out of clay
And when it's dry and ready
Then dreidel I will play.
My dreidel is so playful
It loves to dance and spin
A happy game of dreidel
Come play now let's begin.
Oh dreidel dreidel dreidel
I made it out of clay
And when it's dry and ready
Then dreidel I will play. <start> Baby I can't make it straight
My boots got stuck and I can't wait
You're the one who's got no tongue
Look and see which way it's run
Man alive I can't drive my twobit cares away
Obituaries I seen right through
Brochures of the times we knew
Taxes on the days we spent
Repossessed and named and chained
Man alive I can't drive my twobit cares away
Accusations suspects named
Battered husbands cousins blamed
Holdin' up your trophy bones
Sticks and stones and lesser knowns
Man alive I can't drive my twobit cares away
And all your hopes can be derailed
Low salt  in the seas you sailed
No dreams in the night you lie
All the stars stripped from the sky
Man alive I can't drive my twobit cares away
Man alive I can't drive my twobit cares away <start> Tombstone shadow stretchin' across my path.
Tombstone shadow stretchin' across my path.
Ev'ry time I get some good news ooh
There's a shadow on my back.
Saw the gypsy man 'way down in san berdoo.
Said I saw the gypsy man 'way down in san berdoo.
Five dollars on the table ooh
Keep me 'way from my tomb.
Oh oh
Said I got thirteen months of bad luck
Bound to be some pain.
Don't you do no trav'lin'
Fly in no machines.
Tombstone shadow stretchin' across my path.
Every time I get some good news ooh
There's a shadow on my back.
The man gave me a luck charm cost five dollars more
Said put some on your pillow and put some on your door.
He said take a long vacation ooh
For thirteen months or more.
Oh lord
Tombstone shadow stretchin' across my path.
Tombstone shadow stretchin' across my path.
Every time I get some good news ooh
There's a shadow on my back.
Oh oh lord
Oh lord <start> Subway ride a free ride somewhere I can't explain
Another night I climb a story building just to spit on a passing parade
Suspect defeat change the tv station as the media takes over your brain
Expedite unite bring yourself together before you drive yourself insane
Some say I'm crazy but there's no other way
What goes around comes around goes around again
Stolen car  more of a thousand in the city that never sleeps
Another please help me I'm drowning in the sewers running under the streets
Newscast outcast stranger to society stranger to the trends today
Exclaim refrain say what your thinking prison in so many ways <start> I put a for sale sign on the front of my truck
Said call anytime cause I'm always up
Make an offer one that I won't refuse
I bought a one way ticket on a westbound plane
Four hours later I was wearing shades in California
Just hanging loose
I didn't pack one memory
And even though I'm free
Chorus
I can go where I wanna go
Do what I want to do
Be who I want to be
But baby you still own me
Say what I want to say
Hear what I want to hear
Dream what I want to dream
But baby you still own me
I was up all night cause I couldn't sleep
Instead of staring at the ceiling I hit the beach
Took a long walk it didn't help me much
I sat down in the sand with a handful of shells
Kicked off my shoes while me myself and I watched
The Sun come up
Looking out across the sea
It's finally dawned on me
Chorus
Maybe I'm not in your arms

But you still own my heart
Chorus
You still owe me yeah
You still owe me <start> Marble stairs in this cathedral
Built by these hands five hundred years before
We will make good men better
We will make good men better
Draw the right hand across the neck
Drop the arm down to your side.
I hear the voices calling in the night.
Thirtythree degrees
Accepted right of hypocrisy
From this bitter cup we all shall drink
Here I am awake it's AM it's getting late
All I know is something isn't right.
We will make good men better
How can you make good men better
Draw the right hand across the neck
Drop the arm down to your side.
I hear the shadows calling in the night.
Get up get up get out
The fire's burning now
Our bodies burned to ashes
They'll be scattered to the forests.
Does it ever even faze you
That your father's involvement with a cult
Nearly killed your first born child <start> Well there's a long long stretch of highway
Here in front of me
It just seems to keep on winding
As far as I can see
Sometimes these wrong turns are sweet mysteries
Sometimes they take us where were meant to be
Chorus
I love this feeling of freedom running through my veins
Been too long at the crossroads waiting for the light to change
Even if it takes forever and I never find out where it goes
Heaven knows
I love this road
I love this road
Well these days become a lifetime
It happens way too fast
And you miss whats round the corner
If you just keep looking back
Sometimes it feels like you cant find your way
Sometimes all you have to go on is faith
Repeat Chorus
Wind at my back and the sun on my shoulders
Pushing me moving me a little bit closer
Sometime a little trust is just enough to take you there
Repeat Chorus <start> Barcelona 
A cool guy from the land of sun and samba
Came into our lives
White smile white boots funny soul
It's more than ten years ago
But no one here will ever forget him
Ginga around the world spreading your Ginga
Let's show the world your game your Ginga
He steps on the field cheered by the crowds
Heads or tails a whistle the magic on his side
No greed no anger bad vibes on the bench
Rising up after the fouls of life again and again
Outstanding dribbling all your fears
Frustration affection hidden feelings coming out
Blowing out your rage with a  meter shot
Did I really just see that Replay Replay Replay <start> we made our plans to meet tonight under street lights of suburban U.S.A. nostalgia that I keep on playing on the mix will play that life made for you and it's telling me that we've all found something true embedded in nights like tonight and we move on let's wish on stars like we used I'll tell you how much I have missed you
we're spending all our lives like we did tonight knowing we can work this out there are roads and signs that lead us home sometime knowing we will work it we will work it out
we can find where this belongs like summer hymns and punk rock songs we love the outcome of our lonely life cause this season holds it's heart in hand like allergies to swollen glands we know keep growing on nights like to night as we move on let's drive these roads like we used to and pretend that the pavement still knows you
we're spending all our lives like we did tonight knowing we can work this out there are roads and signs that lead us home sometime knowing we will work it we will work it out
this is one night built from our lives in this town we left to love this is my life this is my time and I'll take you there I'll take you all back home <start> You can live in the house and I will find
a little place around the corner
trouble comes from the strangest quarters
it snuck up on us now without a warning
Every night I hang my head outside into the stars
it's a wonder I can even talk at all
I walk by kids that hang on corners tripping out
afraid of what they'll miss
late at night I hear other voices crying out
I never wanted this
I played you all my favourite songs
catch you when you fall
you look at me saying that's not it at all
Oh my I can't help wondering why I blew it again
I let you down
I watched your tears come splashing all around
all my life I feel like I've been blind
but the moments that shine
are so hard to find
Hey look those northern lights are dancing
come on out and we'll sit here on the lawn
we won't talk we'll only listen
maybe we can stop what's going on
Every night we look out on what's left of all our dreams
it's a wonder we still can talk at all
Oh my I can't help wondering why I blew it again
I let you down
I watched your tears come splashing on the ground
all my life I feel like I've been blind
but the moments that shine
are so hard to find <start> you better turn down your music. you've been recorded for the last hour by the authorities. you're gonna get an aggravation harrassment charge filed against you...right away. so you better

Move  <start> Ghetto fight yah don't wanna start a riot yet
No not alone or in these clothes
But they just won't listen to me
Maybe I'm too young or down right naive
Ain't got no time for your rigid rules
Ain't got no time for the gutter or to booze
I made the escape to L.A. I can't just run away
I got to think about tomorrow and the very next day
Ghetto fight yah don't wanna start a riot yet
No not alone or in these clothes
The old town wanted me to stay
But I knew that it's only gonna have its way
They scrub the streets 'cause they're filthy
Can't trust no one 'cause they're all guilty
So I sit and overheat surrounded by the sound of the city street
Red light on the wall now it makes me think about
Who got the culprit and who got the shake
What you gonna do when you're thrown back in jail
Don't worry 'bout the rent now you gotta pay bail
There's that girl down on Nuclear Blvd.
Got a guy outside her window and he's beating up the yard
He can't sleep on the street
Here come the HBT
They're gonna give him the sweep <start> D'oro giada bordeaux si tinge il mondo
Bagliori d'amaranto viola la fine
Segue lo sguardo il montare della sera dal fondo delle valli
Oscura arresa al buio
La terra penetra il cielo
La terra penetra il cielo
Scioglie il suono del tuono la tensione del cuore
In canto in danza in movimento in mille sfumature
Molto elegante il gusto della forma del colore
Solido intenso nulla
Compiuto levitante
E' l'aria l'elemento
Il vuoto la sostanza
Vicini per chilometri vicini per stagioni
Sulle tracce dei lupi che fuggono le guerre degli umani
Vicini per chilometri vicini per stagioni
Traversando frontiere che preparano le guerre di domani
Vicini per chilometri vicini per stagioni
C' modo e luogo di scoprire che il confine d'aria e luce
D'Aria e Luce
Scioglie il suono del tuono la tensione del cuore
In canto in danza in movimento in mille sfumature
E poi tu dici  dormi  il sonno viene
E poi tu dici  sveglia  se ne va
E poi tu dici andiamo
E poi tu dici andiamo
San bai no san buonagiornata
San bai no san buonagiornata
San bai no san
San bai no san
Vicini per chilometri vicini per stagioni
Silenzi di fervore che portano parole quotidiane
Vicini per chilometri vicini per stagioni
Sulle tracce dei lupi che fuggono le guerre degli umani
Vicini per chilometri vicini per stagioni
Traversando frontiere che preparano le guerre di domani
Vicini per chilometri vicini per stagioni
C' modo e luogo di scoprire che il confine d'aria e luce
D'Aria e Luce
D'Aria e Luce... <start> Felt the best that I could feel censored every memory
Give me yours so I can feed mine
Anywhere but far away can't be what you meant to say
I won't miss you in the meantime
All jokes aside you should decide
If it pleases or pains you
You should be allowed but you were beat out
So nothing can save you
Closing up into the end try to start it up again
A lower voice and tired heart beats
Take away the self esteem force it through to get relief
Taking everything that I need
Spirits all keep coming down
Come around with answers
I'll cut my teeth in slivers
You're up and gone and senseless
Broken open your abscess <start> Everyday that you don't get better man you're getting worse
Every drink that you wanna take you know will only feed your thirst
There ain't no bird that'd hit a window if it's covered in dirt
There ain't no way that a kid like me will ever have some kind of worth
So I'm filling all the storm drains up with cigarette butts
So the next time that it rains all the streets will flood
Next time that it does rain all the streets will flood
All the change that you've been dodging is piled up
Yeah nickels dimes and pennies dropping into paper cups
There ain't no seed that could ever grow in the pit that you have dug
There ain't no way you can climb out on a ladder without any rungs
So you're filling up that hole with all those girls you thought you could love
Blonde haired reparation for all the battleships you've sunk
Green eyed medication for all the battleships you've sunk
So you're caught in the teeth of the tyrant king
Another little bird to keep his mouth clean
You're pecking all the flesh off of the people that you've been
Your bones are exposed you've grown too thin
Your bones are exposed you've grown too thin
Your bones are exposed
Your bones are exposed
Everyday I'm getting better at feeling worse
Yeah I call that progress my sadness comes first
There ain't no word that could bang a drum if it didn't fucking hurt
Ain't no way a little boy like me will ever have some kind of worth
So you're filling all those holes up with those girls you thought you'd love
Yeah I'm filling mine up with these cigarette butts
So the next time that it rains all the streets will flood <start> One hundred years from this day
Will the people still feel this way
Still say the things that they're sayin' right now
Everyone said I hurt you
They said that I desert you
If I go away
You know I'm going to get back somehow
Nobody knows what kind of trouble there is
Nobody seems to think it all might happen again
One hundred years from this time
Would anybody change their minds
And find out one thing or two about life
But people are always talking
You know they're always talking
Everybody's so wrong
That I know it's gonna work out fine
Nobody knows what kind of trouble there is
Nobody seems to think it all might happen again <start> When I look outside my window
What do I see
And when I look outside my window
So many different people to be yeah
That it's strange so strange
You've got to pick up every stitch
Two rabbits running in a ditch
The hippies out to make it rich
Oh no
Must be the season of the witch
Must be the season of the witch
Must be the season of the witch
Must be the season of the witch
Well when I look over my shoulder
What do I see
And when I look over my shoulder
Some ancient fellow I'm longing to be
It's so strange so strange
You've got to pick up every stitch
Two rabbits running in the ditch
The hippies out to make it rich
Oh no
Must be the season of the witch
Must be the season of the witch
Must be the season of the witch
Must be the season of the witch
And here we sit immersed in a liquid sea of love
Shimmering rainbows in silver sky above
A looking glass that reflects our past
Tied with seaweed all around like willows
Upside down you caress my heart
Caress my soul surround my limbs
You laugh your laugh and hold my body fast
And we wake up and sit here thinking
Thinking about the times we used to have
And know they're gone forever
We'll never learn never learn
Help me
Somebody help him
As I look over my shoulder
What do I see
And as I look over my shoulder
There's so many pretty sights to see
That it's strange so strange
You've got to pick up every stitch
You've got to pick up every stitch
Those hippies out to make it rich
Oh no
Must be the season of the witch
Must be the season of the witch
Season of the witch
Please have mercy on my soul
No no must be the season of the witch
Incomprehensible
God God hey
If you can't help us you better listen please
Momma I'm cold <start> Have you ever been to American wedding
Where is the vodka where is marinated herring
Where is the musicians that got the taste
Where's the supply that's gonna last three days
Where's the band that like fanfare Gonna keep it going  hour
Instead it's  in the morning and DJ's patching up the chords
Everybody's full of cake staring at the floor
Proper couples start to mumble that it's time to go
People gotta get up early and they gotta go
Ah people gotta get up early and she's got a boyfriend
And this whole fucking thing is one huge disappointment
And nothing gets these bitches going not even gypsy kings
Nobody talks about my super theory of super everything
So be Donald Trump or be an anarchist
Make sure that your wedding doesn't end up like this
I understand the cultures of a different kind
But here word celebration just doesn't come to mind
Have you ever been to American wedding
Where is the vodka where is marinated herring
Where is the musicians that got the taste
Where's the supply that's gonna last three days
Where's the band that like fanfare Gonna keep it going  hour <start> Siento que arranco la carretera
Voy enfierrado por la costera
Mi troque casi se desparpaja
Pero pura madre se me raja
Llevo un fletazo pal otro lado
Y voy a ganarme buena marmaca
Grifando me di cada que tres
Pase bien orneado por culichi
Rosalie marihuana en Guamchil
En Mocorito mate a sunschil
Y cuando iba a aterrizando avin
Me arremangue ya me entro un lineon
Por entre en medio de las parcelas
Bien locochon retorne a la 
Esquizofrnico y bien ondeado
Senta que el troque era jet privado
Llegue al carrizo y al desengao
Y los guachitos me la pelaron
Antes de llegar a Navojoa
En una PEMEX recargue disel
Compre un veinticuatro de Tecate
Me juste y le di raite a una morra
Y la cancin de ojos de Sonora
La resumimos en una hora
Me divorcie de ella en Obregn
En la capital di un bailadon
Me alcoholice como el dios Eolo
Tambin foquie hasta quedar mongolo
Y cuando volv a entrar al planeta
Andaba en Quino y vea sirenas
Tome la calzada de Quinos Mora
Me perique hasta absorb la bolsa
Brinque la raya y no hubo demora
Fume Kush como locomotora
Bien relajado y tambin sonriente
Llegue a las vegas sin ni un pendiente
Misin cumplida le dije al jefe
Me dio seis fajonas de billetes
Arranque rumbo al hotel Pars
Mujeres vino y banda en el suite
Pasado me voy para mi rancho
Y en  das vuelvo volando <start> Silent night Holy night All is calm All is bright Round yon virgin mother and child Holy infant so tender and mild Sleep in heavenly peace Sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night Holy night Shepherds quake at the sight Glories spring from heaven above Heavenly hosts sing Hallelua Christ the saviour is born Christ the saviour is born
Silent night Holy night Son of god Love's pure light Radiant beams from thy holy face Bring the God of redeeming grace Jesus lord at thy birth Jesus lord at thy birth <start> Ooh sha la la la la la la
Ooh sha la la la la la la
Tedium is overcome
From obscurity through melody
And when I'm blind it helps me
See through your key
No one can touch no need to rush
Presented by my alibi
When I'm down it brings me round so easily
At eight o'clock I take my leave
And when I'm done and dusted tonight I'm gonna be
I'll be a karaoke queen it's not me you see
I'm gonna take you down to a place
I know you'd rather be
It's just a  minute song it doesn't last very long
But it'll take you take you to a place
I know you'd rather be
Hey you can dance
Ooh sha la la la la la la
Ooh sha la la la la la la
Common sense has excuses recklessness it's uses
But don't go fusing silence with charisma
At nine o'clock you can count on me
That when I'm up I'm ready tonight I'm gonna be
I'll be a karaoke queen it's not me you see
I'm gonna take you down to a place
I know you'd rather be
It's just a  minute song it doesn't last very long
But it'll take you take you to a place
I know you'd rather be
Where you can dance
Ooh sha la la la la la la
Ooh sha la la la la la la
I'm doomed to fail the stage gives way
It's an apostrophe to my legacy
But though I'm bruised
I'll happily do it all again
At  O'clock don't wait up for me
'cause when I'm up I'm ready
Tonight I'm gonna be...Matthew
I'll be a karaoke queen it's not me you see
I'm gonna take you down to a place
I know you'd rather be
It's just a  minute song it doesn't last very long
But it'll take you take you to a place
I know you'd rather be
And you can dance if you want to
Show appreciation
But step up the mic for the full sensation
And you can dance
And you can dance
And you can dance
And you can ooh la la la ooh sha la la la <start> Wake up in the morning
Get into bed
closing my eyes
I rest my head
There is no arrangement
No time no place
It's gone in the wind
and left no trace
Who can say
maybe or whatever.
It's up to you
You know you can
trust me
I'll make it up to you
You move with the action
You loosen my strings
Your fingers
can smooth out my jangles
and all those things <start> Here I stand Beside you still I somehow stand apart
I'm burdened in my spirita stone is weighing down my heart
I'm riddled in my depths by this halfheartedness
Sundered from the now by selfprotectiveness
Look around in your heart
Cut off from the moment
Divested all the way
No music in this silence
No colour in this grey
I'm rarely fully thereI cloak myself from harm's way
An inmate of my own device who's blinded by the light of day
Summon forth from your heart
Cut off from the moment
Divested all the way
No music in this silence
No colour in this grey
This chasm I cannot bridge
This hole I cannot fill with sand
Summon forthfrom your heartthe whole man
Halfspeedhalftherethus I'm halfalive
Unveiled and unguised then I'm genuine
But why do I die just as I come alive
So used to this armour and how it fits
Cut off from the moment
Divested all the way
No music in this silence
No colour in this grey
This chasm I cannot bridge
This hole I cannot fill with sand
Summon forthfrom your heartthe whole man
Music P.CraddickD.Ott
LyricsP.Craddick <start> Shadows fall in the places we used to play
My toys have all been packed away
The rocking horse rocks in its box
A spinning top and Corporal Clott
Are a dusty lot
Many times I said I'd drop you a line
I guess I'm just a rotten swine
Who takes his time
And walks for fun when she should run
The damaged one is you old chum
Who's the sucker now
Who's the sucker now
Could someone shed some light on this love affair
And help to make me quite aware
Of what is meant by wicked thoughts
That have been sent
My memory is empty
Who's the sucker now
Who's the sucker now
It's too late now there's no time
The truth is locked in my mind
To wonder and look in my eyes
Who's the sucker now
Who's the sucker now <start> I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleighbells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmasses be white
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmasses be white <start> Liberty laughing and shaking your head
Can you carry the torch that'll bring home the dead
To the land of their fathers whose lives you have led
To the station at the end of the town
On the southbound train going down..
Equality quietly facing the fist
Are you angry and tired that your point has been missed
Will you go in the backroom
And study the list
Of the gamblers using the phone
On the southbound train going down
Fraternity failing to fight back the tears
Will it take an eternity breaking all the fears
And what will the passenger do when he hears
That he's already paid for the crown
On the southbound train going down. <start> Well there she goes with a brand new love affair
Dancing with him like she don't even care
Well let her dance with him
Let her dance all night long
Well who would've known that just yesterday
She danced with me the very same way
Well let her dance with him
Let her dance all night long
Well let her dance with him all night long
Let her dance to our favorite song
Well let her dance with him
Let her dance all night long
Well I'll find me a new love
And then she'll see
Someone else will be dancing with me
Then let her dance with him
Let her dance all night long <start> Holding on to the rhythm
I'm standing in my leather and lace
People move to the left and
Move to the right and
The whole place starts to shake
Without a net on a real high wire
I'm stepping out with my wheels of fire
I started dancing with a stranger
Moving to the break of day
Dancing with a stranger
And I just got swept away
Letting go my inhibitions
Is harder to do than say
But I surrender to the beat
I start shuffling my feet
When I hear that music play
I trip the light fantastic
I touch the sky and it feels like magic
I started dancing with a stranger
Moving to the break of day
Dancing with a stranger
And I just got swept away
Give me a dance dance
Dancing with a stranger
And it takes my breath away
I ain't looking for mister right
It doesn't matter to me
There's something in the air
Electric I like
Igniting endlessly
I started to dance...
Without a net on a real high wire
I'm stepping out with my wheels of fire
I started dancing with a stranger
Moving to the break of day
Dancing with a stranger
And I just got swept away... <start> CHORUS
Life is a circus
It's not fair
Life is a hard road
When you're not there
At the fair
Friends come to see me
and with what way shall I go 
To see the show
to help my friend and fall 
oh let them find me down 
When will they realize
To laugh and drag my name on the ground
The circus must go

To the fair
Papa he talks to me
Don't try your heart
Gets deep inside you
Does you real harm
Don't you care
I like the worker
and with what way shall I go 
Stand straight and tall
to help my friend and fall 
 oh let them find me kneel and down 
Don' t lose your balance

A long way to fall

Crowds don't care
 <start> And now I raise my voice... In defiance
To break the chains that have bound these hands
Arrest the fear inside and shed this callous coat
I've got to know just where I stand...
Chorus
I will... not walk silently through this life
I will... never yield the passion in my soul
I will not surrender what's inside I could never
I will... not walk silently through this life this is my promise
And so I'll seize the day because it's all I've got
And I will question everything im taught
Emancipate my life compel my thoughts
Embrace this world I will not be bought so...

And I will stand and I will break the silence
I will  I will not surrender
I will  I will not surrender
No I will not walk silent
No I will not lose hope
No I will not surrender
No I'm gonna break the silence
This is my life and I will not give up 'till I die
No more fear no more lies I've got to know just where I stand
Each and every day... know just where I stand <start> 
You don't retain your calm
Either you're an anvil
Or sell me your aunt
And your car is almost gone
Figure it out
My bag's against the wall
You knocked me up
You didn't knock me out
And I'm God about to brawl
Figure it out
Talk beheads the cat
Shoes off the couch
Or I catch a rat
But I'll rent you a riot hat
Figure it out
My bulk's across the mall
A wounded ham was an animal
And I've got a bout of gall
Figure it out
My back's against the wall
Figure it out
And I'm not about to crawl
Figure it out <start> You'll be given love
You'll be taken care of
You'll be given love
You have to trust it
Maybe not from the Sources
You have poured yours
Maybe not from the directions
You are staring at
So twist your head around
It's all around you
All is full of love
All around you
All is full of love
You just ain't receiving
All if full of love
Your phone is off the hook
All is full of love
Your doors are all shut
All is full of love
In any language <start> I staggered through this criminal reign
I'm not in love no phony pain
Creeping through this tidal wave
No warm embrace just a lover's grain
This symphony
This rage in me
I've got a handful of songs to sing
To sting your soul
To fuck you over
This furious reign
I'm falling man
I'm choking man
I'm fading man
And broke and blind
I'm falling man
I'm choking man
I'm fading man
Just killing a little time
I love the sound of an empty room
The screams of night the end of love
Two beating hearts one labored scarred
One open wound wasted and drowned
No sympathy
This furious reign
I lay in bed
The monster fed the body bled
I turned and said
I get some of you all the time
All of you some other time
This rage in me
Get away from me
I'm falling man
I'm choking man
I'm fading man
And broke and blind
I'm falling man
I'm choking man
I'm fading man
Just killing a little time <start> it's always too early to speak...
the fire found a new gathering place
the day you packed your things
and ran away to save your face
from seeing me this way anymore
and the river you ran through
made silly pools inside of me
wet memories that never seem to dry
i can't believe we've slipped...
no more echoes
when my heart beat faster
no more games
when you'd hide from me
no more hands
clutched tight
and sand stretched far
trickled away
when you found your way home
.. <start> Something always gives
It's the matter of the time you waste
And here I am out of your focus
it comes down to you
The direction that you choose
The choices in our lives
And you choose to live in spite
Far away from mine
choose a hundred possessions you're thankful to own
and those who atone
discount all but one
It stands to reason but I can't be by myself
It makes no different what I have
I'm by myself
intrinsic to your world
the benefit of doubt
Check your messages
through some trivial discord
the code of silence rings
and i can't recall the why or when all i remember
is now we aren't speaking
It stands to reason but I can't be by myself
It makes no different who I am
It stands to reason and it's better left undone.
It makes no different what I have
I'm by myself by myself by myself <start> Best of cruel intentions
Finding what they fail to mention
No truth all pretension
Raise your hand to give attention
You'd give it
We'd take it
You'd build it
We'd break it
You silently erase it
You'd feel it
We'd fake it
It's my red star steal it
It's my red star can't let go
It's my red star conceal it
It's my red star oh no
Wasted education
Celebrating imitation
Misplaced admiration
Speaking for a generation
You'd give it
We'd take it
You'd build it
We'd break it
You silently erase it
You'd feel it
We'd fake it
It's my red star steal it
It's my red star can't let go
It's my red star conceal it
It's my red star oh no <start> Alleine im Lokal wart' ich wieder mal
Darauf dass noch was geschieht.
Da stehst du im Licht. Ich trau' meinen Augen nicht.
Ein Engel der wie du aussieht.
Ich muss handeln und zwar schnell ob ich Whiskey bestell'
Oder soll ich zu dir gehen.
Doch der Typ da mit dem Bier. Was will der denn von dir
Ich hab' dich doch zuerst gesehen.
Ich hab' dich doch zuerst gesehen.
Ist die Chance vertan Warum lacht mir nie das Glck
Trink ich mich heut' unter'n Tisch oder geh' ich nach Haus zurck
Alleine in der Nacht
Alleine in der Nacht
Doch der Typ geht weg und ich kriege einen Schreck
Denn du schaust direkt zu mir.
Ich geb' dir einen aus frag' dich Kommst Du mit nach Haus.
Du sagst Ja so gehen wir.
Ich spr's genau im Knie so verliebt war ich noch nie
Da stoppt uns ein Polizist.
Eine Bank wurd' ausgeraubt und das ist ja nicht erlaubt.
Er sagt dass Du's gewesen bist.
Er sagt dass Du's gewesen bist.
Jetzt bist du eingesperrt doch ich werde treu dir sein.
Leider bin ich dafr sieben Jahre lang allein.
Alleine in der Nacht
Alleine in der Nacht
Alleine in der Nacht
Alleine in der Nacht
Es wr' schn gewesen.
Mir bleibt nur deine Liebesbriefe zu lesen
Mit ihnen decke ich mich zu.
Alleine in der Nacht
Alleine in der Nacht
Alleine in der Nacht
Alleine in der Nacht
Du bist allein ganz allein so allein allein in der Nacht.
Ich bin allein so allein so allein allein in der Nacht.
Du bist allein ich bin allein wir sind allein allein in der Nacht.
Er ist allein sie ist allein es ist allein allein in der Nacht <start> Instrumental <start> You read the papers today
I read the news today oh boy
About a tragic comedy
Newspaper hinted suicide
The letterhead read Dear Johnny
A tainted truth was all it said
Sleep tight now that you've made your bed
An arrow that once pierced your heart
Points to the apple on your head
Three sides to every story
Yours mine and Monday morning's
Cupid's dead headlines read
Cupid's dead oh no no
Cupid's dead headlines read
Cupid's dead oh no no
Papers here
Get your papers here
Extra
Cupid's dead
Oh Romeo Oh Romeo
Where did our love go Romeo
If you read between the headlines
You wouldn't be the last to know
No mystery yet to unfold
A paperboy left in the cold
A love was said to never die
Withered away and just got old
Three sides to every story
Yours mine and Monday morning's
Cupid's dead headlines read
Cupid's dead oh no no
Cupid's dead headlines read
Cupid's dead oh no no
Our top story tonight
is a crime of passion
The victim an unidentified man
is found in bed wearing only a diaper
holding a bow an arrow in one hand
and clutching a letter in the other.
The letter simply read... CUPID'S DEAD.
Extra extra extra extra
read all about it

Cupid's dead
Cupid is dead deceased I got peace of mind
Still it's hard to forget what it leaves behind
A lot of love lost your feelings are wasted
tasted the sweetness but now you're faced with
the thought of being alone no more companionship
you can handle it just abandon it
leave it behind and look for the brighter day
Give it some time cause it won't come right away
You gotta be standing strong hold on to your dignity
Don't sit around saying look what ya did to me
It's time to move on you gotta continue
to look for a love of a life that's within you
Cupid is dead now
It's time to rely on yourself to cope
You got no shoulder to cry on... Dead <start> I used to see you every morning
Even when I didn't want to
You used to like to watch us play downtown
As long as I sang a song for you
Chorus
But nothing stays the same
And it's drivin' me insane
Oh you know we've got it so bad
And nothing you can say
Can make me want to stay
But still you're hangin' on
You say you never saw this comin'
So why does it always fall on you
I think you call me every time you see a phone
You hang up but I know its you
Chorus x <start> Tell me who knows what
Gonna happen today
Weatherman said that the sun is shining but all I see is pouring rain
And the preacher keeps saying
That we're out of time
If you tune in again next week then they'll tell you everything is fine
It's hard to know what's going on
When the right ones get it wrong
Tell me who knows what
Who knows what way is up
How much is too much
Hard to know sometimes just who to trust
Who knows what's going on
How much right they say is wrong
Tell me who knows what
Who knows what
A dollar means today
You can lay it down on the roll of a dice and you can put your money in the bank
You spend everything
To have everything
Then you sit around around my friend and watch it going down the drain
You wake up and its gone
And you don't know what went wrong
Tell me who knows what
Who knows what way is up
How much is too much
Hard to know sometimes just who to trust
Who knows what's going on
How much right they say is wrong
Tell me who knows what
Who knows what way is up
How much is too much
Hard to know sometimes just who to trust
Who knows what's going on
How much right they say is wrong
Tell me who knows what
Tell me who knows what
Yeah tell me who knows what
Baby who knows what
I do know what <start> I want to scream until no sound comes out and you've learned your lesson
I want to swallow these pills to get to sleep
So I don't have to make a bad impression
I need to start to be myself
Cause I'm sick of everybody else
I won't let you bring me down
It's here and now I'm breaking out
I will learn to love again
But I will stand a broken man
I wanna run but only far enough to make you miss me
I wanna take back all the shit that I have done
But I guess you were better off without me
I need to start to be myself
Cause I'm sick of everybody else
I won't let you bring me down
It's here and now I'm breaking out
I will learn to love again
But I will stand a broken man
I took one big step and I looked away
And then I thought of all the things that I wanted to say
I'm always too late
You never got your story straight
I'm always up late
I think I'm everything you hate
I took one big step and I looked away
And then I thought of all the things that I wanted to say
I'm always too late
You never got your story straight
I'm always up late
I think I'm everything you hate
I took one big step and I looked away
And then I thought of all the things that I wanted to say
I'm always too late
You never got your story straight
I'm always up late
I think I'm everything you hate
I won't let you bring me down
It's here and now I'm breaking out
I will learn to love again
But I will stand a broken man
I won't let you bring me down
It's here and now I'm breaking out
I will learn to love again
But I will stand a broken man <start> You
You said you'd come around
Silk stockings can't be found
On my floor no more
You
You're the one I want to see
You could make me happy
If you'd come and live with me
I don't even know that much about losing
I've had some bad times
I've had some good times
I've done ok
You could take it all from me if you wanted
And I'm sure that you'd agree
Well I hope that you'd agree
You
You opened up my mind
I'm standing in the rain
Feeling alright
You
You put a grin across my face
I love the way you taste
I really want you babe
I don't even know that much about you
You've got that magic touch
You've really got it down
I don't even see your face when I want you
But I hear you come around
Well I know you come around
Oh babe I want you
Yeah yeah yeah ohhhh
How I want you
I don't even know that much about losing
But you've got that magic touch
You really got it down
I don't even see your face when I want you
But I hope you come around
Well I know you come around
You
You said you'd come around
Silk stockings can't be found
On my floor no more <start> From the wreckage I pick up the pieces of my life
It's all around me ripped to shreds I'm wounded and that's why
This time I'm taking mine I will not wait in line
I'll bite the hand that feeds me I will do what I must to survive
This time I'm taking mine I will not wait in line
I'll bite the hand that feeds me I will do what I must to survive
I'm growing stronger with each piece that stays there in it's place
Not over powered scared to death but not sure if I care
Chorus
I've found your weakness you'll drown yourself within it
Letting it out right to the heart of it you're going down down to the ground of it
Don't even count no one can stop it now won't help to shout don't even try it
Chorus
I'm taking I'm taking I'm taking mine repeat <start> There are no lyrics to this song <start> What up Mike
Um we almost ready now my nigger
It's El Presidente young hov Jay Z
You know how the fuck we do it

Ladies and gentlemen remember the name
Let me say it again
Fort Minor We Major
You are not ready 
Cause this ride is about to begin
Sit down and buckle it in
For those of you that want to know what we're all about
The real hip hop 
How you doin' y'all
My name's Mike Shinoda
Fort Minor Green Lantern
Internationally known and respected
Machine Shop rockin' when we step inside
How you doin' y'all
My name's Mike
Sick with a BIC pen all up in your shit man
Yeah you can comprehend it or compliment it it's all aunthentic
Wrong nights I perform like Mike
I'm fooling with the new shit I'm doing it all night
Wrong nights I perform like Mike
I can quit and get it back like I'm riding a bike
Wait up a sec give me space to move
Room to prove I'm stupid with the P's and Q's
It's the young Shinoda
I done paid my dues Machine Shop
Is back this is front page news
Fort Minor
We Major <start> I broke the surface so I can breathe
I close my eyes so I can see
I tie my arms to be free
Have you ever been free
She's not breathing
She's not moving
She's not coming back
I burn a fire to stay cool
I burn myself
I am the fuel
I never meant to be cruel
Have you ever been cruel
She's not breathing
She's not moving
She's not coming back
Shut the door so I can leave <start> If I tried
Would you still call me son
If I tried
Would you call me at all
If I say that I'll go regardless of what you want me to do I'm better off without
I'm better off without you
If I change my mind it won't be soon enough for you
But I'm not you
I'll try to compromise for you to see that there's
So many other things for me to find out
Run myself to the ground
Would you please forgive me if I found my way back home
Everything I see
Everything I do
Everywhere I've been
These mean nothing to you <start> Le temps le plus important c'est la premire fois
Le temps le plus important c'est la deuxime fois
et aprs a la troisime fois
et on recommence
j'ai perdu les habitudes de ma jeunesse
et je me sent dsunis et part de ma propre histoire
et on recommence <start> Time and again I've longed for adventure
Something to make my heart beat the faster.
What did I long for I never really knew.
Finding your love I've found my adventure
Touching your hand my heart beats the faster
All that I want in all of this world is you.
You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long.
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song.
You are the angel glow that lights a star
The dearest things I know are what you are.
Some day my happy arms will hold you
And some day I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are are mine <start> You don't care for what we're not
Painted lives on shattered rocks
And you can't see for what is real
Always trapped inside your seals
'Cos you don't care for what we're not
Always tempered always stopped
And you don't see for what is real
Forever trapped inside your seals
Then you join the things undone
Just to say we never won
Then you join the things undone
Just to say we never won
You always take out
'Cos you're afraid mistaken
You always take out
'Cos you've been bound mistaken
You just take from what we've lost
Bind us down with splintered rocks
'Cos you just take us in and steal
Always trapped inside your seals <start> Trade you my girlfriend for your guitar
Know that string will only bend so far
Everybody sells me
Everybody tells me how
'Cause I'm feeling a little wired
I'm not drunk I'm just tired
And I'm not gonna get fired
'Cause perfection's not required
When you figure out what's going on
We'll get drunk and then we'll write a song
When somebody shows me
When somebody shows me how
'Cause I'm feeling a little wired
I'm not drunk I'm just tired
And I'm not gonna get fired
'Cause perfection's not required
Well I'm feeling a little wired
I'm not drunk yet I'm just tired
And I'm not gonna get fired
'Cause perfection's not required
Well I'm feeling a little wired
I'm not drunk I'm just tired
And I'm not gonna get fired
'Cause perfection's not required <start> Last lions roar before they're tamed
I stood out in the glorious reign
Knowing full well I can't go home again
Wise Up Ghost
Wise Up
When are you going to rise up
Wise Up Ghost
Yield some sighs up
Wise Up Ghost
Go on your merry way now if you must
Fool's Gold turns rivets into rust
'Til you don't know who to trust
Wise Up Ghost
Wise Up
When are you going to rise up
Wise Up Ghost 
Yield some sighs up 
Wise Up Ghost 
Old woman living in a cardboard shoe
Lost so many souls she don't know what to do
So say your prayers 'cos down the stairs it's 
Wise Up Ghost
She revolves around a sparkling pole
Stares into the mirrored wall
Sees another woman walking through a market stall

Wise Up Ghost

Wise Up
When are you going to rise up
Wise Up Ghost 
Yield some sighs up 
Wise Up Ghost 
Lost girl found on the radio
Down around Larado
Go direct to hell you murdering soandso
Wise Up Ghost
Trapped within a House of Feathers
Sitting in a Shirt of Wire
Howling at a Wall of Flowers
Saying Wise Up Ghost
Wise Up
When are you going to rise up
Wise Up Ghost 
Yield some sighs up 
Wise Up Ghost 
I walked along an iron pier
Where Rose's kisses turned to tears
Saltwater rushing over the pebbles under there
Wise Up Ghost
Last sigh of passion
Slipped into the room like an assassin
Glad tidings we bring
For you and your King
Wise Up Ghost
Wise Up
When are you going to rise up
Wise Up Ghost 
Yield some sighs up 
Wise Up Ghost 
Last lions roar before they're tamed
I stood out in the glorious reign
Knowing full well I can't go home again
Wise Up Ghost

When are you going to rise up

Yield some sighs up

She's pulling out the pin
She's pulling out the pin
She's pulling out the pin <start> I sent off this morning
Down the road along the river
Which I take but once a year
My walk will take me by the shore
Then inland for a mile or more
From the cold sea spray
A small wood stands upon the hill
An old house near it lies in ruins
Forgotten long ago
And here in a clearing
overgrown with moss and ivy
Is your lovely grave
A dusk I will make my way
Along the lanes and through the fields
To where my cottage is
But before I step inside for bed
I'll look up at the stars as we had
All those years ago
So here's for Uncle Pat <start> Taste you left a bitter taste in my mouth
That will never heal to subreveal
Unkind can never rewind
You play the part that's so unreal
Repercussions now pay the price
Watch me walk away done talking now
Pigeons burning yesterday won't put them out
Never heard a single word done talking now
Try to get through to me it won't happen now
I find that you'll get me back sevenfold decisions in your life
I find gonna get me back sevenfold bury me alive
You're always on the ride your adversaries love the view
Signed and sealed lost sight cannot lead the blind
You point your finger filled with steel your future deal denied
Watch me walk away done talking now
Pigeons burning yesterday won't put them out
Never heard a single word done talking now
Try to get through to me it won't happen now
I find that you'll get me back sevenfold decisions in your life
I find gonna get me back sevenfold bury me alive
You've been riding so high on one big lie all these years
Denied all my pride never thought you'd hear all these years
So crystal clear your promising tears we all did these years
All these years all these years
Watch me walk away done talking now
Pigeons burning yesterday it won't happen now
I find that you'll get me back sevenfold decisions in your life
I find gonna get me back sevenfold bury me alive

Watch me walk away done talking now
Pigeons burning yesterday won't put them out
Never heard a single word done talking now
Try to get through to me it won't happen now
I find that you'll get me back sevenfold decisions in your life
I find gonna get me back sevenfold bury me alive
Watch me walk away done talking now
Pigeons burning yesterday won't put them out
Never heard a single word done talking now
Try to get through to me it won't happen now
Watch me walk away done talking now
Pigeons burning yesterday won't put them out
Never heard a single word done talking now
Try to get through to me it won't happen now
Watch me walk away done talking now
Pigeons burning yesterday won't put them out
Never heard a single word done talking now
Try to get through to me it won't happen now <start> What was our home
Paper not stone
A lean to the most
Oh when you pour
You're half away
Gravity want
Like it always does
Did I wait time
Would it be easier
To just delete our pages
And the plans we've made
Erase me so you don't have to face me
Put me in ground and move the daisies
Ah the memory see how it goes when you
Erase me erase me
So what will you do
With no me for you
I know what we said
What if I left a thing to
We know that you don't seem
To think about what you need to
You reached you'll find that you've
Erased me what the fuck is this
You're crazy
Turn around and do each time
Replace me
Ah the memory everybody knows how it goes
You just erase me
Do me like a pro and taze me
Fireworks puff it's gone amazing
New you've gone solo
Growing mustaches all a photo
Erase me erase me
Aha aha
Aha aha
Erase me this is not shouting baby
Erase me go on call the cops now baby
Ah the memory everybody knows
What the brand new home
Erase me so you don't have to face me
Erase me I'm sure you can never escape me
And if you feel nothing
Guess where I'll be <start> Time  brother publishing co. bmi

I'm thinking about athis whole world
Late at night I think about the love of this whole world
Lots of different people everywhere
And when I go anywhere I see love I see love I see looh oh oh
When girls get mad at boys and go
Many times they're just putting on a show
But when they leave you wait alone
You are there like everywhere like everyone you see
Happy cause you're living and you're free
Now here comes another day for your love


Your love
Woo oo oo oo ooo ooo oo oo

Aummmmm wooo wooooo bop didit
Late at night I think about the love of this whole world
Oomm dot dit it
Oomm dot dit it
Oomm <start> Overjoyed
If laughter's all we had
Overjoyed
There's joy in feeling sad
Now I know...
Lost the nerve
To fight ya over this
And all I want
Is to taste my lover's kiss
Now I know...
All the times to you I lied
Of all the hurt I hold inside
Release me you release me
You release me
You help me get it off my chest
You hold the pain and leave the rest
Release me you release me
You release me
Darlin' you release me <start> New Zealand New Zealand
You caught me on an awful day
My little life is all fucked up
My psyche is in disarray.
New Zealand New Zealand
I wish I could enjoy you more
I wish I had more time to see
Your cliffsides and your blackened shores.
New Zealand New Zealand
I don't know why I tour this way
Trapped inside an aeroplane
And twittering the scenery.
New Zealand New Zealand
I feel like shit what can I say
My period is six days late
My pubic hair is turning gray
But I don't believe in the beauty standard
And there's no way that I'm pregnant
So it's technically okay.
Everything is so beautiful here
The people on Cuba Street drinking their beer
I wish I could stay here and never go home
I wish I could be just like Holly Hunter in 'the Piano'
And not have to talk to anyone
Even though there's technically nothing wrong with my voice
And just play piano and make love to hot local boys.
New Zealand New Zealand
You caught me at the end of tour
My willpower's collapsing
And I cannot do this anymore.
New Zealand New Zealand
My song is coming to an end
I hope you have enjoyed it
And I hope I get my period.
I also hope I haven't grossed you out
But that's what you get
When you ask me to write a song about your country in twenty minutes. <start> Frank zappa

Get out your party dress and fix up your makeup try
To make a good impression this is a new world
Were all the same here well maybe not the same you know what I mean.
I've got everything that you want I've got everything and someday Ill be president.
I've for everything that you want
I've got everything except the single thing you really need.
Separate love from addiction its not the same I know
I see desperation pulling my strings. Hey Eliza now what do you want
I play piano and I sing like a humming bird and oh I forgot
That humming birds don't sing it doesn't matter really you know what I mean.
I've got everything that you want I've got everything
And its a brand new world eliza. I've got everything that you want
I've got everything except the single thing you really need.
Sail away blood and rejection ..they isolate.
I know I see a generation staring back at me..
Wasted away
Wasted my time this picture you see is nothing like the one
I wanted painted of me.
Eliza says it's all right with me if your sure
It wouldn't be the first time you know it's happened a couple of times before
And.. I don't even expect much anymore and anyway
It's not as if I was waiting for you to come and make it all okay.
Shut away to to wing blood and rejection they isolate
I know I see visions of people grabbing hold of me.
Wasted away wasted my time
This picture you see is nothing like the one I wanted painted of me.
Put on your bad self get out your party dress and fix up your makeup try
And make a good impression.. <start> Caused is the sin
And all evil shall win
Bleeding from within
Deeply sinking in
The bottomless depths of pain
Where the hate becomes insane
My path is the one I choose to follow
Which will bring me to my grave.
No one shall give  only greed is real
No one shall stand  only falling is real
No one shall love  only hate is real
No one shall live  only death is real
Everything that was ever meant
Is now worthless and forsaken
Helpless and abandoned
Is how you will forever remain
LET THY CHAOS FOREVER REIGN UPON US
Nothingness is what I feel
And is everything I ever crave for... <start> In the cold of the night the fire burns bright
You long for the unseen
On the edge of the sea your thoughts run deep
You long for a place you've never been
Is anybody there is anybody there
You cry to the full moon
As your thoughts run wild like the thoughts of a child
You wonder if you'll be there soon
I say slow me down slow me down
I want to hear the sound slow me down
Is anybody out there
Is anybody out there
Is anybody out there
Is anybody out there
Anybody anybody
Here I stand letter in my hand
The letter that you sent to me
But as I turn each page like the turning of a wave
I feel you turning me
Slow me down slow me down
I want to hear the sound slow me down
Is anybody out there
Is anybody out there
Is anybody out there
Is anybody out there
Anybody anybody
I don't know anything no more
I don't know anything no more

My lucky graveyard boots and a song to sing
I got a song to sing to keep me out of the cold
And I'll meet you further on up the road

Where the way is dark and the night is cold
One sunny mornin' we'll rise I know
And I'll meet you further on up the road

Searchin' through the dust lookin' for a sign
If there's a light up ahead well brother I don't know

Time to die
Got to keep running...
Stormbringer coming...
He's got nothing you need
He's gonna make you bleed
Rainbow shaker
On a stallion twister
Bareback rider
On the eye of the sky
Stormbringer coming down
Meaning to stay
Thunder and lightning
Heading your way
Ride the rainbow
Crack the sky
Stormbringer coming
Time to die
Got to keep running...
Stormbringer coming...
He's got nothing you need
He's gonna make you bleed
Comin' out of nowhere

'Cause it's coming you way <start> This won't hurt more than a pinch.
So just pour a drink.
Lets talk it over.
I'm back after all these years.
Don't be afraid my dear.
Now I'm older.
Cause people change.
Can't you see my eyes.
Are they not the same after the lies
I know I'm like a machine.
But I still have dreams.
I know one day we will
Sleep for days.
Come over come over.
I won't make the same mistakes.
Come over come over.
I'm dying not to hurt you.
In our dreams we can be complete again.
When you were young you kept a list.
Of the things you'd miss as you got older.
I've known you in every life I've lived.
Yeah I'm still a kid.
Even though I'm colder.
When you were a child.
I was lost in the wild but you built a home for me in the road.
I was born the cold.
Turn up the heat.
I know one day we will
Sleep for days.
Come over come over.
I won't make the same mistakes.
Come over come over.
I'm dying not to hurt you.
In our dreams we can be complete.
If we go to sleep we can wake up home again.
Come on over again.
Sleep for days.
Come over come over.
I won't make the same mistakes.
Come over come over.
I'm dying not to hurt you.
Sleep for days.
Come over come over.
I won't make the same mistakes.
Come over come over.
I'm dying not to hurt you.
In our dreams we can be complete.
If we go to sleep we can wake up home again.
Come over come over.
Come over come over <start> I heard your voice in Echo Park last night
I wasn't sure how many times it rang out through the night
I felt the breeze and the hearts through the air
I felt your eyes lookin' right through me
I heard your voice in Echo Park last night
Was a summer to remember
You were something to behold
A regular Marilyn Monroe
I heard your voice in Echo Park last night
I used to swim in Echo Park Lake all night all night
We took our clothes off stayed out half the night
Well come on now we're gonna do it right yeah yeah
I'll take your hand
And we can swim together right now all night
It was summer to remember
You were something to behold
A regular Marilyn Monroe
I heard your voice in Echo Park last night
I felt the breeze and the hearts through the air
I felt your eyes lookin' right through me
I heard your voice in Echo Park last night
Well if I wanted to come back

I wouldn't change a thing oh no no no
I heard your voice in Echo Park last night
I heard your voice in Echo Park last night
I heard your voice in Echo Park last night
I heard your voice in Echo Park last night <start> Welcome to the first day of the rest of my life
The tension is so think you can cut it with a knife
Something's happened
Things will never be the same
There's blood on the carpet
I'm rewiring my brain
I got some new friends down at West Valley PD
You can change the channel but I'm all that's on TV
The only good news is that he's going to be o.k.
Got a bomb in my stomach but I'm dreaming that one day
I'll be going to a Policeman's Xmas party
Have a couple beers get funky on the dance floor
Going to a Policeman's Xmas party
Gonna have a good time for the rest of my life
 weeks later it's still raining in the park
Marine with a gun guards my house now after dark
I look for clues like I'm Inspector Clouseau
You can have my money honey I just want to go
Go to a policeman's Xmas party
Have a couple beers get my funky on the dance floor
Go to a policeman's Xmas party
Gonna have a good time for the rest of my life...
There's cops on the ceiling
There's cops on the floor
There's cops in the windows
Cops breaking down the door
You'll never feel safer in your life
The captain even likes to get freaky on my wife
We're going to a Policeman's Xmas party
Have a couple beers get my funky on the dance floor
Going to a Policeman's Xmas party
Gonna have a good time for the rest...
Welcome to the best day of the rest of my life
My buddies broke the case and now it's gonna be alright
Moral of the story it don't matter who you are
Be careful what you wish for they'll be calling you a rock star
People from earth there's never been a harder core
Party like this party in a million years or more
The floor itself is hopping like a freaking kangaroo
The D.J.'s in his P.J.'s playing...everybody wants you
Going to a policeman's Xmas party
Have a couple beers get funky on the dance floor
Going to a policeman's Xmas party
Going to have a good time the rest of my life
Take off your clothes
Take off everything you are
Take off your heart
Get funky on the dance floor
Going to have a good time for the rest <start> I bought some rock star ashes
From the back of rolling stone
I guess he wouldn't mind it
They couldn't sell his soul
The tiger in my tank
Is going to go extinct
And I'm not feeling so good myself
I think I'm on the brink of disaster
I had a dream last night
The TV and the phone
Grew some legs and took a walk
And left me all alone
The tiger in my tank
Is going to go extinct
And I'm not feeling so good myself
I think I'm on the brink of disaster
When I grow up I'll be
An angry little whore
I'll give you all the finger
I'll sell you all what for
The tiger in my tank
Is going to go extinct
And I'm not feeling so good myself
I think I'm on the brink of disaster <start> goodmorning sun

goodmorning sun

i'm sorry <start> My lungs are not waking up
They don't listen what the rest of me knows
And I'm counting down the days I have left
Only listening while I'm holding my breath
Till I see you...
Cut it down I will cut them down
They tower over me while I sleep
But I vent too much to just lay around
Only pretending while I'm facing the ground
And these skies my only wish
What's the point to this There's no point to this 
Hold on to me hold on to my back
I'm falling down the hole much too fast
Even even if the light pours in up over my head
Will I see it then or pretend that I'm dead again.
And these skies my only wish
What's the point to this There's no point to this 
'Cause we all change with the morning  after
But these tired hearts aren't beating fast enough
So can I ask you to leave me alone
I'll help when I am able to
Get back up  <start> Please allow me to adjust my pants
So that I may dance the good time dance
And put the onlookers and innocent bystanders into a trance
Give disease so the swine will marry and propagate lies.
Tough luck for elected officials. The beast you see got fifty eyes.
Bring it on home spread the wealth. Play it cool the hand's been dealt.
Now all the odds are in our favor. Save the victory speeches for later.
Streets on fire the mob goes wild.

London Bridge is falling down <start> Words and music by Nancy Delaney
I've heard it many times before
All is fair in love and war
But now I question everything
What together we might bring
What together we might bring
Who are we hurtin' with our love
Contagious love and secret death
Aren't we protected by our loving breath
It feels so good can't we forget the rest
We feels so good can't we forget the rest
Who are we hurtin' with our love
I've seen it now with my own eyes
How a lovin' person dies
A new disease amongst us stalks
Aids is not just chicken pox
Aids is not just chicken pox
Who are we hurtin' with our love
We are all one now nature says
So now we need careful ways
So our love retains its true intent
And nightmare is not how life is spent
Nightmare is not how life is spent
Who are we hurtin' with our love <start> now just where the fuck have I gone.
the days feel so old and cracked and your eyelids closeyou shut me out.
got run over by your words today and everyone's a hazy shade of gray.
and I don't know who I am anymore don't know where I'm coming from
don't know where I'm going to but I kinda want to hate you.
I'm screaming till my bones break but you swear you didn't even hear a whisper.
I'm always left to pick up your pieces.
a room of gold and you see red.
what is there left that I can believe in...
this so useless so dead and so ugly your eyes so disgusting so hating degrading...

it's back to me again.
hair as fire. eyes as sharp as switchblades breathing death into my arms.
fingers dripping scarlet... what is there left that I can beleieve in...
I am so numb. I can't feel anything anymore.
I am trapped in a shell and I can't feel anything anymore.
I am so numb. ican't feel anything anymore.

Up rib of rock donw spine of stone
I dare not slumber where the right winds whistle
Lest her creepingsoul clutch this heart of thistle
O the same God that abandon'd her
Has in turn abandon'd me
And softenin' the turf with with my tears
I dug a Well of Misery
And in that Well of Misery
Hangs a bucket fulla Sorrow
Which swings slow an' achin' like a bell
Its toll is dead and hollow
Down that well lies the longlost dress
of my lil floatin girl
That muffles a tear that you let fall
All down that Well of Misery
Put ya shoulder to the handle if ya dare
and hoist that bucket hither
Crank'n'hoist'n'hoist'n'crank
Till ya muscles waste'n'wither
O the same God that abandon'd her
Has in turn abandon'd me
Deep in the Desert of Despair
I wait at the Well of Misery <start> Thick fog rolls in waves
On the Golden Gate
I was checking my watch
With seven minutes in my shift
When I spot a black skirt on the rail
Straddling the bar like it's a quarter a ride
She's scared to jump but terrified to stay
Walk to her slow extend my hand with a smile and say
Ma'am how was your day
Keep your eyes on my face
I want to help you
If you'll let me
She's startled I look forward
Wrap my arms 'round her legs
Pull her down to the sidewalk
We're both heaving for air and I say
Ma'am how was your day
Keep your eyes on my face
I want to help you
If you'll let me
Most folks think they'll hit the surface
And never feel no pain
Water pulls you under
Back to the womb once again
Bodies float to the shore
Bloated purple and blue
If sharks won't get you first
Crabs will have their way with you <start> Otro pabelln que se abre

Sorcerer of death's construction
In the fields the bodies burning
As the war machine keeps turning
Death and hatred to mankind
Poisoning their brainwashed minds
Oh Lord yeah
Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight
They leave that role for the poor yeah
Time will tell on their power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess
Wait 'till their judgement day comes yeah
Now in darkness world stops turning
Ashes where the bodies burning
No more War Pigs have the power
Hand of God has struck the hour
Day of judgement God is calling
On their knees the war pigs crawling
Begging mercies for their sins
Satan laughing spreads his wings

Shot down back in Christmas kamikaze rain

Like smoke that falls it's caving into you
So put me on a plane and fly me to anywhere
Put me on a plane and fly me to anywhere
Put me on a plane and fly me to anywhere with you

One night when you woke up
You bled til you spoke up
Oh this ain't pretty dear
With clocks watch the time go
Til spring when the sun can finally be free
And I'm sure you've lost that weight again
And I'm sure the pills keeps pouring in
We'll scream at night to make it go away

The word is said
The word is old now
And the stone is bread
The heart is bone now
The heart is flesh
The heart is known now
And the no is yes
And all we hold
Is only in the past
The song is cold now
The song is spent
The song is sold now
And the thought is rent
The bird is flown now
The bird is fled
The bird is gone now
And the wind is fed
And all we hold
Is only in the past <start> In times of meditation
I can hear the sweetest voice
Sounding out across the distance
Breaking through the noise
Then there comes a vision
And then a touch so tender
No more indecision
I surrender
I try and keep my heart protected
I try and keep my cool
But just as I suspected
I don't make the rules
I'm giving myself over
No more great pretender
I want to be your lover
I surrender
I surrender
I surrender
I'm giving myself over
No more great pretender
I want to be your lover
I surrender
I surrender
I surrender
I surrender
I surrender <start> I've got a friend her name is Laura
We took a holiday seven sweet days in Mallorca
We took a plane through to southern Spain
To see the ocean waves blue
We sat and watched the moon
As crickets sung back cover tunes
Way back in May
Seven seven days in the sun...yeah
She's my heaven
She's a spark
Feels like heaven
So light me up
She's got this friend his name is Paula
He likes to cross dress every Friday night in clothes from Prada
We took a train left behind the rain
To see the summer sunset glow
But now she's not around
I'm hanging on with broken hands
Way above the clouds
Seven days in the sun seven days in the sun...sun
She's my heaven
She's a spark
Feels like heaven
So light me up
You really light me up
You really light me up
You really light me up
You really light me up
You really
Staring through the crowd
It's pulling me underground
And who's gonna dig me out
We used to take a walk on velvet sands across the beach
We used to build a fire and stare into the rising heat
You used to set me free lift me from the concrete seas
Seven days in the sun
She's my heaven
She's a spark
Feels like heaven
So light me up
You really light me up
You really light me up
You really light me up
You really light me up
You really light me up
You really light me up
You really light me up
You really light me up
You blow my mind <start> Do you realize that you have the most beautiful face
Do you realize we're floating in space
Do you realize that happiness makes you cry
Do you realize that everyone you know someday will die
And instead of saying all of your goodbyes let them know
You realize that life goes fast
It's hard to make the good things last
You realize the sun doesn't go down
It's just an illusion caused by the world spinning round
Do you realize oh oh oh
Do you realize that everyone you know
Someday will die
And instead of saying all of your goodbyes let them know
You realize that life goes fast
It's hard to make the good things last
You realize the sun doesn't go down
It's just an illusion caused by the world spinning round <start> She woke up this morning and fixed him his breakfast
Just like shes done for so long
She knows when she leaves with the kids for the bus stop
When she gets back hell be gone
She thinks about last night when he turned out the nightlight
How he didnt hold her again
Shes a warm lovin woman feelin unwanted
And shes taken about as much as she can
Shes over thirty and underloved
And shes gettin hungry for the right kind of touch
And if he dont want her he know somebody will
Shes just over thirty but not over the hill
She still remembers the way that he held her
Just a few short years ago
And she dont understand why hes turning colder
While shes still feeling the glow
She starts to wonder if she were younger
How would he treat her tonight
'Cause shes still a woman and if he dont want her
She might just take any love she can find
Shes over thirty and underloved
And shes gettin' hungry for the right kind of touch
And if he dont want her he know somebody will
Shes just over thirty but not over the hill <start> De pobre yo nac
Lo tengo que advertir
Nada se me cedi
Todo cuesta sudor
De mi poca escolar
Ni me quiero acordar
A los Salesianos fui
Qu ms puedo decir
Porque a palos me
Ensearon
Su religin...
Tuve que trabajar
Para ganarme el pan
La empresa era estatal
Yo lo pas fatal
Pero al fin consegu
Escaparme de all
Msico quise ser
Msico me qued
Y si alguien lo ve fcil
Que venga a ver...
Si dejas de ensayar
Es para viajar
Nunca puedes saber
Si habr para comer
Me canso de luchar
Debo continuar
Puede que encuentre al fin
Razn para vivir
Y slo tengo muy claro
Pobre nac... <start> I can tell you what you're lookin' for
But that just makes you mad
You treat me like a fool a stupid bore
You're getting wise to a passing fad
But now you've gone away you're through with me
You no longer need a crutch
And I'm honestly surprised I'm not tickled pink
I can't believe I miss you this much
Chorus
Baby baby baby come back oh come back
Baby baby baby come back oh come back
Baby baby baby come back oh come back
Baby baby baby come back come back to me
You ignore my witty lines and look down your nose
Every time I speak
You try to zap my courage from head to toe
Make me feel so weak
Well I should celebrate but as a matter of fact
The things you say are true
I'm a big pretender I'm not wise at all
I'm nothing without you
Chorus <start> It makes me smile
To think of what we dreamed of
Where are those sons of summer now
With their wildhaired women in their
patchwork gowns
Who could laugh the lights away
Nights on the beach and bay
The course on farms
And the course in the bar
Sweet smokin' in the back of the car
Always the first time shines to last like a morning star
Like a morning star
It's been a while since the last time we were dancing
Where are those sons of summer now
With their longlimber ladies who all knew how
To chase the blues away
I've got the blues today
Your ivy days and your clubhouse ways
Wine mug nights when the music played
Love that is real will not fade away like a morning star
Where are those sons of summer now
The winter has come
And you don't know how to turn your
Dreams into coal
Your books won't hold you
The woods get cold
And I feel too old
I begin to question your schoolboy soul
Clever remarks that once won my heart
When the fire won't light they lose their spark
And I can't help but get a little bit blue
thinking about the precious nothing we
Once knew <start> How many more nails
you gunna drive through my heart
It was different from the...
How many more knives into my back Jack
How many more broken hearts
can you stand through all the rain
How many more nails
you drive into my heart
How many more baby
Haw many more times tried
oh oh oh
How many more baby
Will you go and leave me alone
leave me alone...
How many more times you like me to beg you
to leave e behind oh
How many more nails baby
will you drive into my heart baby
How many more days
you drive in
how many more times
you fill me with life
How many more hours
must I wait at night
for you to walk back through the door baby
How many more nails
How many more knives through the back
Oh How many more nights...... <start> I'm gonna find my way back to you
I lie in bed and watch the shadows
Dancing across the wall
Nothing to do but think of you
And count the tears that fall
Oh how I wish it was real
I wish I could feel you holding me close
The only thing I know for sure
Is I should've never let you go
Chorus
I would walk the world across the sea
Journey beyond the moon
I try anything go anywhere
To find my way back to you
I still don't understand the reason
I think I was just afraid 
All I can do is face the truth
And deal with the mess that I made
Now all I want is the chance to take it back
And go on like this
Because ever since we said goodbye
I've been lost in loneliness
Chorus
Now baby I was wrong
Now that you're gone
The only thing left to do
Is spend every day
Stray every way
To find my way back to you
I know that I was a fool
To push you away
And if you let me back in your life
Baby I swear all my heart
And in your arms I will stay
Chorus
Baby I'm gonna find my way back to you <start> Wide open falsehood
The clan destine truths
Rival till the end
In a series of duels
Pardon the drapery language I choose
Waltz in Vienna has taught me to use
Every tall room a fiction
Leather bound treasure books
Up to the ceiling
Gold spine upon spine
The guile and the treason
The faith and allegiance
Wide open falsehood
The clan destine truths
Rival till the end
In a series of duels
Pardon the drapery language I choose
The author grew fat to imagine
His lead pen careening
Gave voice to the scheming
An Aryan cabale to dethrone
The guile and the treason
The faith and allegiance
To the empire unknown
The baron and his mistress
Dine in a fine banquet hall
As rebel insurgents plot in
The attic space crawl
Wide open falsehood
The clan destine truths
Rival till the end
In a series of duels
Pardon the drapery language I choose
His small hand did strive to explain
All the rants and raves of a people enslaved
By the cant of the shrewdest capable men
The guile and the treason
The faith and allegiance
Now lie in my hand
The guile and the treason
The faith and allegiance
Now lie in my hand <start> Shout with me
and hear the revolution beating
drums leading towards a new world
tear apart all maps cause they will only
lead us to where we shouldn't be
we break the sides of all new worlds
Everywhere I turn I see the flames
It starts to burn but it's okay
cause I've been waiting for today to start this riot
Feel the ground start to shake
all around the world awakes
to the sound my earthquake
when I become a renegade
This is a riot
I'm a renegade
I can't be quiet
I'm a renegade
Start breathing and listen to the drums beating
They're leading towards a new world
I look at my clock tictoc ticking
This is the life we're given
So we take it and make it worthy
Everywhere I turn I see the flames
It starts to burn but it's okay
cause I've been waiting for today to start this riot
Feel the ground start to shake
all around the world awakes
to the sound my earthquake
when I become a renegade
This is a riot
I'm a renegade
I can't be quiet
I'm a renegade
This is a riot
I'm a renegade
I can't be quiet
I'm a renegade
This is a riot
I'm a renegade
I can't be quiet
I'm a renegade
It feels like my heart's about to explode
It feels like my heart's about to explode
It feels like my heart's about to explode
It feels like my heart's about to explodeI'm a renegade
This is a riot
I'm a renegade
I can't be quiet
I'm a renegade
This is a riot
I'm a renegade
I can't be quiet
I'm a renegade
This is a riot
I'm a renegade
I can't be quiet
I'm a renegade <start> For our world the circle turns again
Throughout the year we've seen the seasons change
It's meant a lot to me to start anew
Oh the winter's cold but I'm so warm with you
Out there there's not a sound to be heard
And the seasons seem to sleep upon their words
As the waters freeze up with the summer's end
Oh it's funny how young lovers start as friends
Yes it's funny how young lovers start as friends <start> The warmth of the sun it feels healing
Warming the cold in my mind
An ocean of Space sends me reeling
Easing my passage through time
Leaving it all behind
When she is gone she is gone
And when she just falls she just falls
Far too long
She just falls way beyond
She just falls where she belongs
Cool of the shade feels relieving
Cracks that appear in my hide
The key to the day is withstanding
The Kingdoms that fall and rise
Leaving them all behind
When she is gone she is gone
And when she falls she just falls
Far too long
She just
falls way beyond
She just
falls where she belongs
Cool of the shade
Cool of the shade in my mind
Warmth of the sun
Warmth of the sun in my eyes
Falls way beyond  she just falls she belongs
Falls she is gone <start> Taking it easy taking it slow
Riding home to lay my body down...
Thought about it long enough
to let it slip away yeah...
But I feel like a stranger here today
Lost in who across the water
Took me far away from home
It seems it aint enuff
to get down on your knees and pray yeah
Ive been waiting for the sun to shine
thou the rain took my spirit away
Ill take the sun before the rain anyday oh Lord
Call on the northwinds when any clouds gets in my way
Nothin ever changes the song remains the same
Feel I got a one way ticket
Oh Im sittin sittin on an empty train...
Its been a such a long time on a black and ribbon road
Taking it easy living from day to day...
Sometimes it aint so good when you find it so high
riding on the northwind
youll never get the feeling to try...
Ill take the sun before the rain anyday oh Lord
Call on the northwinds when any clouds gets in my way
Nothin ever changes the song remains the same
Feel I got a one way ticket
Oh Im sittin sittin on an empty train...
Northwinds make it oh so easy
Make me live my life too slow...
It seems it aint enuff
to get down on your knees and pray
Ive been waiting for the sun to shine
thou the rain took my spirit away
Ill take the sun before the rain anyday
Call on the northwinds when any clouds gets in my way
Nothin ever changes the song remains the same
Feel I got a oneway ticket
Oh Im sittin sittin sittin on an empty train...
So the tell how long has the train been gone
So the tell how long has the train been gone
So the tell how long has the train been gone
So the tell how long has the train been gone
So the tell how long has the train been gone
I even missed an empty train... <start> I heard she loved you I heard she cared
I heard she miscarried and you were scared.
Did you run from the one
Who conceived your child
Yesterday's gone there's no return
And she cries all night.
Did you run from the one
Who conceived your child
Yesterday's done there's no return
And she cries all night.
Solo.
I believe that a woman can be a slave to a man.
I believe that love that you gave and we try it again.
Will you return to the one
Who conceived your child
Yesterday's gone there's no return
And she cries all night.
Will you return to the one
Who conceived your child
Yesterday's done there's no return
And she cries all night.
Did you run from the one
Who conceived your child
Yesterday's gone there's no return
And she cries all night <start> badleesjustonemoment

SONG LYRICS
Hypocrisy as it oughta be that's called good business
Sometimes it really bothers me how I got in this
Took this job athinkin' I'd be movin' up someday
Been too busy drinkin' to be carin' either way
The wife she ain't been workin' 'cause her time is growin' near
But the IRS ain't takin' no sabbaticals this year
Been working on commission against weekly guarantees
This soldier's on a mission but it ain't for charity
CHORUS
Give me just one moment with the wheel between my hands
Just one moment I'll make you understand
Don't confuse all the games you lose with failing as a man
Just one moment I'll show you who I am
Went in to see the boss man to ask him for a raise
Never did quite understand all the reasons that he gave
His  x  of Jesus had turned it's back to me
I guess mortal men can't comprehend that dense morality
So I bought my wife some roses and tied them with a bow
Called the boss up at  AM and I told him where to go
Now we're driving down the highway back to where we first began
With me back in the driver's seat and her holding my hand
Repeat Chorus

Spare all the preachin' my secret's worth keepin'

coming up the drive.
Well I listen for your footsteps
but they don't arrive.
Just a waiting for your knock dear
on my old front door.
Well I don't hear it
does it mean you don't love me anymore
Well I hear the clock a'ticking
on the mantel shelf.
Well See the hands a'moving
but I'm by myself.
Well I wonder where you are tonight
and why I'm by myself.
I don't see you
does it mean you don't love me anymore
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't make me blue.
'Cause you know darling I love only you.
You'll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go.
Don't pass me by don't make me cry.
I'm so sorry that I doubted you
I was so unfair.
You were in a car crash
and you lost your hair.
Well You said that you would be late
about an hour or two.
Well That's alright Baby that's alright
I'm waiting to hear from you.
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't make me blue.
'Cause you know darling I love only you.
You'll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go.
Don't pass me by don't make me cry.

And you hide it that it makes you feel alright
See your secret in a mirror
It's black 'n' blue and it happened to you
In the heat of the night
It hurts just the first time
Ooh it hurts
It hurts just the very first time
Screaming for a lovebite
For a lovebite
Hiding that it feels right
Screaming for a lovebite
Grinding makes so uptight
And you gotta face it 'cause it decorates your neck
It's gonna stay there
Stay there for a long time
Just to remind you while you like it
When you went on and on
It hurts just the first time
Ooh it hurts
It hurts just the very first time
Screaming for a lovebite
For a lovebite
Hiding that it feels right
Screaming for a lovebite Repeat x <start> Il sont arrivs par le sentier qui mne au lac

Editions CHAPPELL <start> There used to be a gambler who courted all around
There used to be a gambler who courted all around
He courted pretty Polly such a beauty never been found
Pretty Polly pretty Polly come go along with me
Pretty Polly pretty Polly come go long with me
Before we get married some pleasures to see
She jumped up behind him and 'way they did go
She jumped up behind him and 'way they did go
Down into the valley that was far below
They went a little further and what did they spot
They went a little further and what did they spot
But a newly dug grave with a spade lying by
Oh Willy oh Willy I'm afraid of your ways
Oh Willy oh Willy I'm afraid of your ways
I'm afraid you will lead my poor body astray
Pretty Polly pretty Polly you guessed it just right
Pretty Polly pretty Polly you guessed it just right
I dug all your grave the better part of last night
Then he stabbed her in her heart 'till her heart's blood did flow
He stabbed her in her heart 'till her heart's blood did flow
Down into the grave pretty Polly did go
Now a debt to the devil that Willy must pay
A debt to the devil that Willy must pay
For killing pretty Polly and running away <start> Hey ho let's go hey ho let's go hey ho let's go hey ho let's go

They're piling in the back seat they're generating steam heat
Pulsating to the back beat the blitzkrieg bop
Hey ho let's go shoot'em in the back now what they want I don't know
They're all reved up and ready to go

praise God who has many names
but the devil has many more
and with the love that my mother gave me
I'm gonna drop the devil to the floor
I'm gonna drop the devil to his knees
I'm gonna drop the devil to his knees
there's always someone who'll try to convince you
that they know the answer no matter the question
be wary of those who believe in a neat little world
because it's just fucking crazy you know that it is

walking along in this haze of confusion
sometimes I can laugh but at times it takes all of my strength
just to find enough reason to take the next step
step but I will but I will 'til I do

brother sister brothers sisters
brother sister brothers sisters
praise God who has many names
but the devil has many more
and with the love that my mother gave me
I'm gonna drop the devil to the floor
I'm gonna drop the devil to his knees
I'm gonna drop the devil to his knees
strange evolution that people have come to believe
that we are its greatest achievement
when really we're just a collection of cells overrating themselves
hello God I'm avoiding the truth

I'm gonna drop the devil to his knees
I'm gonna drop the devil to his knees
 <start> Got blood on these hands
Sweat of the brow
I work this land
Til the sun goes down
Preacher man in a black tie band
He's got that fire in his bones
With one word he might save your soul
Snap like a whip he won't quit
That old time religion
Red sky up high ramparts on fire
Try to the pull the wool
Over my eyes
I got no fear of anyone. <start> You were born in a southern fall
it might of been Sunday but I can't recall
all the birthdays I must have missed
your first steps and your first kiss
I don't even know if you know my name
but you should hear the truth before it's too late
so I hope this finds you
on some highway
Cuz I'm an old time rambler
I call the road my home
forgive my indiscretion
it's the only way I know
a million miles from Kentucky
but I will always be around
so turn the radio up when your heart breaks down
I played for tips and I played for less
I played a pretty southern girl right out of her dress
she danced until the lights came on
but there's a reason she's here instead of being at home
she said the songs you sang made the whole room cry
and that night I told a young man's lie
when I said I would call her
and I said I'd write
Cuz I'm an old time rambler
I call the road my home
forgive my indiscretion
it's the only way I know
a million miles from Kentucky
but I will always be around
so turn the radio up when your heart breaks down
turn the radio up when your heart breaks down
I'm sorry for the tears I made you cry
I'm sorry for the promises that turned to lies
if I could turn back the hands of time
I'd take you back and try try try
to make you understand
that this is who I am
I met a devil in an old motel
it seems I ain't got much of a soul to sell
my glass is empty
my hands are blue
and the doctor gave me about a month or two
well I thought I would make it to you this year
so forgive me one last time my dear
and tell your mother
I won't be coming home
Cuz I'm an old time rambler
I call the road my home
forgive my indiscretion
it's the only way I know
a million miles from Kentucky
but I will always be around
so turn the radio up when your heart breaks down
turn the radio up when your heart breaks down <start> It striked me once hard
I've realized
All that I used to be a child
Everything's fine now
Seems ok
Sometimes scared of someday
Don't know where all the years has gone
I guess I've been twenty since I was born
Oh Joe I can't hear you knocking at my door

Oh Joe I can't hear you knocking at my door

Do you know I can't hear you knocking at my door
Oh Joe do you know
It's easier not to think of that when you stand up

I liked him more than I like myself <start> Die Revolution

Refrain  <start> Shape is still asleep with toys
As tall as men the pictures in hallway turning inside
Whispers unseen jumping against the sky
Slipping away he looks for the last time <start> I used to watch you walk away
Til the road you take would bend
I was the man to turn you on
And you knew it after all
Come tomorrow when I'm all weary
You would turn me down again
At least that's the way I can remember
Do it again do it again
Do it again do it again
Every little word you told me got home
I'm still thinking about them
Every little secret we could have known
And we can't live without them
You surely started something
You surely gave me something new
Do it again do it again
Do it again do it again
And I do think about you each now and then
And each time it gets tighter
From the road I can see the last break
And my head's getting lighter
Do it again do it again  <start> Not about to try
Time to please no one
The first and last begins
You mutter you child
You should ask for more
Tired of being your no one
Fame can't hurt my soul
You mutter you child
Leave
This is not for real
Forever pleasing someone
The first and last begins
You martyr you child
You martyr you child <start> Yeah I've been hurt and I've been blue
And I've been thinkin' 'bout the changes love has put me through
I've told myself it's got to end
I've had enough and I ain't goin' back again
I've watched 'em come
I've watched 'em go
Six seven eight and I can still say no
And then tonight you came along
Only a fool would want to be that strong
Temptation number nine
Make a man want to cross that line
Face to face with a chance like this
There's only so much that a man can resist
I walked alone I played it safe
Tryin' not to count the times I walked away
'Cause when you love and love goes wrong
A broken heart just seems too much to gamble on
I first saw you I had to think
Oh another pretty woman just what I don't need
But when I look into your eyes
Hey I see somethin' makes me want to roll the dice
Temptation number nine
Make a man want to cross that line
Face to face with a chance like this
There's only so much that a man can resist
Ooh you got it shakin'
Ooh there's no mistakin'
You're the next trip that I'll be takin'
Temptation number nine
Make a man want to cross that line
Face to face with a chance like this
There's only so much that a man can resist <start> Drive tonight without anywhere to go
Or place to call my home
Looking through time
I could see you but never would feel you
The tears fell every time you refused me
This world always used me up inside
Never could find a true reason
To pass through this season
Now I gotta move on and survive
'Til I find the life
Never again
I'm gonna leave all this behind
I've found the better life
Never again
Believe me when I say my goodbyes
I gotta have the life
I say goodnight
To all that I thought I knew
Now I know what to do
Seeing the world for the first time
It won't be the last time
Now I gotta move on and survive
'Cause I found the life
Never again
I'm gonna leave all this behind
I've found the better life
Never again
Believe me when I say my goodbyes
I gotta have the life
So scream in my face
You're already late
Now I can say
This is all I'll take
You've beat me down
I'm standing my ground
Never gonna give in
Won't break but I'll bend
Now I've gotta move on and survive
'Cause I've found the life
Never again
I'm gonna leave all this behind
I've found the better life
Never again
Believe me when I say my goodbyes
I gotta have the life
The life
The life
Gotta have the life <start> Please oh please let me fall asleep
It's like heaven when I sleep
Until morning I forget her
I lie awake in my lonely bed
In a room without a light
Trying hard to find a dream
That gets me through the night
But
Sleep won't come
It's never there
Since you're no longer mine
And sleep is such a precious thing
With your memory on my mind
Asleep
Oh please let me fall asleep
It's so peaceful when I sleep
Until morning nothing matters
Asleep
If I could only fall asleep
It's like heaven when I sleep
Until morning I forget her
I hate to see the sun go down
And face another night
I watch the shadows climb the wall
As they try to catch the light
Asleep
Oh please let me fall asleep...
Asleep
If I could only fall asleep
It's like heaven when I sleep
Until morning I forget her
Asleep
Oh please let me fall asleep... <start> Blue you radiant blue
I don't know how you can stand next to me
You you talk like a noose
And only confuse my perplexity
Now that I'm so sad and not quite right
I could dance all night
I could dance all night
Shake your rattlesnake skin
And become a part of society
Wait on down the highway
To see how far I'll come arun arun
run running
All that we had salvaged from the fire
Was a waste of time
 what a waste of time
Should I trust all the rust that's on TV
I guess with some distaste I disagree
With quite a fashionable dispassion for
The dispossessed understressed
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
And I don't care if you don't like it
Or just don't see
Now that we fattened the cow
And set out to plow unknown enemies
Wow shouts the startled crowd
How now did you see what I did see
the ravaged cabbage drifts on dark red skies
and it looks so nice
gee it looks so nice <start> I was wrong I was wrong
Thinking my heart can be my own.
I was strong I was strong
When I had a reason to hold on.
Let me fall let me fall for you.
Let me fall for you.
Don't look down don't look down
By now it's too late to take it slow.
Turn around turn around
Give me a reason to let go.
Let me fall let me fall for you
Let me fall for you.
It's almost over
I'm hanging by a thread.
With all the words you never said
I'm going under
So tell me what to do.
I've got nothing to hold on to.
Let me fall for you.
All the time all the time
You were the one that got me through.
Like a sign like a sign
You were the voice that knew the truth.
Let me fall let me fall for you.
Let me fall for you.
It's almost over
I'm hanging by a thread
With all the words
You never said.
I'm going under
So tell me what to do.
I've got nothing to hold on to.
Let me fall for you.
 <start> Chorus
Newspaper got some more people killed yeah
Magazine watch 'em shoot 'em in the field
Radio they turn another deaf ear
Institution stole everything else
Sergeant man he's workin' on the lead
From a skunky at the Double Tree
Five cannons outside the door
Five badges and a labrador
Wanna chase after the dollar bill
Gotta race up the forgotten hill
They don't want you but you still here
God knows thats a miracle
Chorus
They pulled him over on the interstate
In her apartment through a stun grenade
Found a pistol put the house in flames
That's what happens in the world today
Wanna chase after the dollar bill
Gotta race up the forgotten hill
They don't want you but you still here
Lord knows thats a miracle <start> Red lights and caffeine
Shaping up like any day
Same familiar routines
Everybody's on their way
Shuttered and cut off
I thought I was shatterproof
Lost and marooned
Before you
Standing in that open door
Before you
Never had been here
Before you
The world was framed in black and white
So is it any wonder
That now it's in a different light
A burst of technicolor
Sea change emotion
Suddenly is overdue
Nothing to lose
Before you
Standing in that open door
Before you
Never would believe
Before you
Ooo
Ghostland transmission
In the ether coming through
But I never knew
Before you
Standing in that open door
Before you
Never had been here
Before you
Smiling in that open door
Before you
Who would have believed
Before you <start> Way past dusk the sky is fallin'
Far off you can see it comin'
Myst creepin' in starts to rise
Visions gone we're stricken blind.

What can we do to cut through the haze
Rats trapped in a deadly maze
We can't see the through the fog
It's blanketing the sky
We can't see the through the fog
Its shrouding the black night...
Dwindling down one by one
Most of them last most are gone
Gotta get outta the woods
Mother nature's up to no good.
Way past dusk the sky is fallin'
It's up to me ain't no runnin'
Thickening myst starts to breathe
Now the fog is after me...
 <start> I'm sick I've tried not to show it
I pray to God that no one has noticed
But I grow weaker day by day
My face is pale my hair turns gray
It's hard to find the joy I once knew
What has crawled into my bones
Made me brittle made me old
All of my dreams are about God
When I dream about God
When I dream its about God
Confusion is my enemy
Restore my soul of faith from reasoning
Jesus save me from obscurity
From the hour the moment of grief
But I grow weaker day by day
My face is pale my hair turns gray
Hard to imagine the boy I once knew <start> I though I knew it all
Knew it all along
But then I found that one

Where should we go
Hey come on
You can't do that to me
Hey come on back
Come back
Come back <start> Let's face the day like it's our last understanding
We are all alive but don't be naive
Yes you will be judged
Found guilty or not guilty it's out of your touch
Just where you are and why you're alive
Just where you are and why you're alive
If you want anything don't be afraid to be yourself
We aren't gods here only humans with a lot of opinions
Patient when the world doesn't move at the same rate as you do
Sometimes it's good to be misunderstood
And it's so fulfilling when you find someone who understands
Who understands you
Just where you are and why you're alive
Just where you are and why you're alive
If you want anything don't be afraid to be yourself
We aren't gods here only humans with a lot of opinions
If you want anything don't be afraid to be yourself
We aren't gods here only humans with a lot of opinions about other opinions
Cheers to the world
For all it's ups and downs
I like being a socialized animal how about you
How about you
If you want anything don't be afraid to be yourself
We aren't gods here only humans with a lot of opinions
If you want anything don't be afraid to be yourself
We aren't gods here only humans with a lot of opinions about other opinions <start> Bed and a home
Dead trapped on the window lies
Know where to hide tonight
The faces empty you were never alive
Touch too much to never know
You wanna lick some alcohol from the flies
Like a burning child I'll burn for you
And like a mourning child I'll die for you
But I will never
In the valley of the dogs
Are we crawling babies
In the valley of the dogs
Crawling
We can turn forever now
We can burn forever now
Saw you turning waving ready to spill
Know where they belong
Hey do you know the bombs are out
It's the way you stalk the way you move
The way things keep going down
The ways you used to in the bar
Like a burning child I'll burn for you
Like a burning baby too like a burning child
Burnt to tell all the dreams that I set fire to
In the valley of the dogs
And all the dreams that I set fire to
In the valley of the dogs
Crawling
We can turn forever now
We can burn forever now
Riot...riot...riot
In the valley of the dogs
Riot...riot...riot
In the valley of the dogs
Gonna turn out gonna turn them out
Gonna move on murder turn it out
Gonna turn out gonna turn them out
Kill the dogs tonight
Will it

Mi voz mi sombra la luz del da
La caricia eterna que est latiendo
Al nombrarte siempre en el alma ma
Las estrofas de mi amor
Los secretos de una flor
En esta cancin que estoy cantando
Te entrego todo y lo que no tengo
Una gran fortuna la luna el cielo
El mundo entero y mi corazn
El ro y su claridad
Un beso y su inmensidad
Para recordarme cuando me aleje
Slo tendrs que mirar al cielo
Brillar una altiva estrella
Para anidar y alumbrar tus sueos
Las estrofas de mi amor
Los secretos de una flor
En esta cancin que te estoy cantando
Te entrego todo y lo que no tengo
Una gran fortuna la luna el cielo
El mundo entero y mi corazn <start>

Bruises
Smiles
Bruises
Bars in the womb
I hide the dirty minutes under my dirty mattress and they are making me itch
My time
Is split milk
My skin is a layer of soot
I'm spending my days scrubbing
I'm trying so hard to act like nothing happened 
I'm trying so hard to find that fresh clean smell 
Smiles
Bruises

Bruises
Bars in the womb
I hide the dirty minutes under my dirty mattress and they are making me itch
My time

Cruel words sleep above me
Mounting and teasing

Talk about the Virgin Mary
Reminded me of you
Expectations left to come up to yeah
Lady writer on the TV
Yeah she had another quality
The way you used to look
And I know you never read a book
Just the way that her hair fell down around her face
Then I recall my fall from grace
Another time another place
Lady writer on the TV
She had all the brains and the beauty
The picture does not fit
You talked to me when you felt like it
Just the way that her hair fell down around her face
Then I recall my fall from grace
Another time another place
Yes and your rich old man
You know he'd call her a dead ringer
You got the same command
Plus you mother was a jazz singer
Just the way that her hair fell down around her face
Then I recall my fall from grace
Another time another place
Lady writer on the TV
She knew all about a history
You couldn't hardly write your name
I think I want you just the same as the

When I'd be held under your thumb
I'm like a pawn in your hand
Moved and compelled at your command
Whether it's for bad or for good
I would never change it if I could
Maybe I'm right maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm weak maybe I'm strong
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Maybe I'll win maybe I'll lose
And maybe I'm in for crying the blues
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Somehow I know at a glance the terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start then left with a heart that is breaking
Maybe I'll live a life of regret
And maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless I'm in love with you <start> There was peace and quiet for me
Down the walk beside the sea
Things are going wrong boy
Things are going wrong
I used to wake up in the morning
To the sound of the birds singing at my window
Please wait for me
I'll be there at the end of the road
Now the good things gone with the wind
It's back today I've moved away
Things are going wrong boy
Things are going wrong
I used to wake up in the morning
To the sound of the birds singing at my window
Please wait for me
I'll be there at the end of the road <start> Here is the tale it's spoken wordforword
it may be abominable but yes it must be heard.
Nauseating at first you can expect the worst
so listen closely as the plot unfolds...
I might stretch the truth may be a little lie
there was a boy named Brad
he played trumpet and he died.
Too young for him to cease
Why We haven't got a clue
It's on the internet so then it must be true.
The untimely death of Brad
how sad it must have been.
If you see him anywhere
remember to console him.
I curse the day I ever met the boy
Only the good die young they say.
The details of his death are vague
unbelievable it seems
as if his passing was only a dream.
Catastrophe calamity
what will we tell his mother now
Cataclysmic a tragic mishap
I just heard that their band is breaking up.
I hear his trumpet his voice rings in my ears
it sometimes seems he's standing very near.
I don't believe in ghosts
I've never seen one
but isn't the trumpet playing haunting on this album <start> Listen to the grass that's out there blowin'
Look at that tractor just there sittin'
It's my name that the bottle's callin'
Listen to the goddamn song I'm singin'
Drink your wine listen to the crickets
It's so fine out here in the thickets
Sittin' on a tree stump that's the ticket uhhuh
Look at that doggy sittin' on the stairs
Look at that star shinin' way up there
Think of all the things that they're doin' in jail
Think of all the rich ones out on bail
Drink your wine listen to the crickets
It's so fine out here in the thickets
Sittin' on a tree stump that's the ticket uhhuh
Look at the TV it's all crappy
Look at the bald spot on yer pappy
Listen to his wheatfield out there blowin'
Hope its doin' better than his hair at growin'
Drink your wine listen to the crickets
It's so fine out here in the thickets
Sittin' on a tree stump that's the ticket uhhuh <start> Sometimes I wonder where it is loves goes
I don't know if even Heaven knows
But I know we had dreams
That didn't quite come true
And now I'm not the one
Little boy who's keeping you
Chorus
I was either standing in your shadow
Or blocking your light
Though I kept on trying
I could not make it right
For this girl
There's not enough love in the world
I know people hurt you so bad
They don't know the damage
They can do and it makes me so sad
How we knock each other down
Just like children on a playground
Even after that o' sun went down
Chorus
Oh darling this is still a shady little town
And sometimes it's so hard to smile
For the world for the camera
And still you have something left
You don't have to prove nothing to nobody
Just take good care of yourself
I'm not easy to live with
I know that it's true
You're no picnic either baby
And that's one of the things
I loved about you
But a time will come around
When we need to settle down
Got to get off this merrygoround
Chorus <start> These words might mean nothing
But it's a chance I'm willing to take
Cause maybe I'm wrong and lives can change
I'm singing out of my insecurity
So someone somewhere might be impacted by what I've made
I fidget and sway back and forth
Biting my nails down until they bleed
There is a lie that I've believed
I'd tell you but I'm so scared of what you'd think
So I apologize if I've caused you to wake
Just close your eyes and let the beat rock you back to sleep
I'll tell you in the morning
About how this man you see
Often times feels like a child
Selfconscious and weak
I'll still put pen to paper
Try to explain these things
That invade my thoughts in my waking hours
Stories of Kings and princes that have lost their way
God we'd give anything just to feel safe
Deep down we all know our worth
We just need someone to truly love us first
So we tip toe around these crowded rooms
Hoping someone in attendance might be able to dress our wounds
We cry without uttering a single word
So gather close circle round
Cause maybe you've just never heard
And I'll tell you the story of the Love I've found
About the Truth embedded in you long before your birth
I'll ask once more
What are these words worth <start> I've got a mean woman and she's always doing me wrong
Yes you know she's mean and she's always doing me wrong
I believe to my soul I've got leave my home
She is a mean woman oh she never treats me right
Oh mean and evil woman and she never treats me right
Only go around every day and don't come home 'til midnight
Lord if only only she would treat me fair
Oh if i could get my baby if could only get her to treat me fair
Oh she would own me yes she would own me anywhere <start> This this is not my life
This this is not my life
This is not my face
This is not my place no it's just isn't right
This this is not my life
You do you remember me
Remember the way that it used to be.
Do you remember our car
Do you remember our house
Do you remember what it was like
Cause this this is not my life
Chorus
My life my life 
My life my life 
My life my life
My life
You're the only one who can see the real me
You're the only one can't you see can't you see
You took away my world
You took away my world
You took away my smile
You took away my life
You took away my reason to live
You you took away my world
And this is not my life
And this is not my life
My life my life 
My life my life 
My life my life 
My life my life 
My life my life
My life my life <start> Old Raven had a lunch of cheese
And sly fox did smell it in the breeze
The fox looked up and sweetly spoke
O Raven on your perch of oak
Your coat is black and your beak is yellow
If only now your voice were mellow
Yes if only your voice were mellow
You'd be the fairest. Be the fairest
Be the fairest in the woods
Ole raven overjoyed by praise
And sure he'd earned it in all ways
Breathed in deep and let a croak
And dropped the luncheon from the oak
Snatchin' of this tasty prize
Sly ole' fox was very wise
To fall for flattery
Good bird
You know it's vanity it's vanity
It's vanity
It must have hurt <start> Breakin' rocks in the hot sun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I needed money 'cause I had none
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I miss my baby and I feel so bad
I guess my race is run
She's the best girl I ever had
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
Robbin' people with a sixgun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won <start> She asks me for a ride 'cause she lives kinda far away from me
So I take off in my car and roll up her steep driveway
She gets in the car and shuts the door
I step on the gas and let the engine roar
And as she calms down I tell her By the way
Jessicah Bean you're the prettiest girl I've ever seen
Jessicah Bean you are the girl of my dreams
Jessicah Bean you're the prettiest girl I've ever seen
Jessicah Bean you are my queen
I show her my muscles and she gets impressed
I tell her she's rad and she tells me I'm the best
As we're headed on our way down to the lake
We get out of the car and I hold her near
I lay the Johnny on thick and whisper in her ear
What a great wife you would make
Jessicah Bean I really mean I want you for my queen
And I'll be your king <start> So far no one seems bothered But you've seen what i've seen Around here it doesn't take much I'll take the liberty Let's just get to it soon And tell the truth
But if you're afraid of the promise And afraid of the truth it contains I know I haven't always been around But I can help you lead And take the blame anyway
I know you've seen what I've seen We'll group and build some trust Follow and lead Lets just get organized And see it through <start> He's an invader on a misson. Got a built  in weapon.
Gotta stake his claim Leave his mark then go conquer
all over again. He's becoming a weapon A flesh and bone
knife. He's been taught to conquer and kill. A prefect
Student with an animalistic will. His body's a weapon A
weapon of war. He leaves his markand it's deep from his
insides. It's like she's the raw meat and he's drawing the
flies He's not the only one the mindset multiplies the
mindset Multiplies. Like little soldiers with orders from
the hive like a modern primitive tribe. Animus primitized
in the jungle of life. Human but hubris perverted by the
hive. Societal sickness only pigues curiosity Goes without
scrutiny Becomes inherited Victimology history. Heart
grows Cold as stone. Sharpens the soul Works over flesh
and bone till it's tough and unbreakable and all softness
is gone. He takes something away she's dead alive. Afraid
to look his own inevitable death in the eye a beast comes
to life in her blood he's baptised by this soul sex genocide
the thrill is in the taking. He's an invader his body's
a weapon He's going to pillage the flesh frontier. Gonna
stab jab invade penetrate degrade chop slice dice victimize
crack gash stab tear hack till the meat is off the
hook... Warm blood won't wash away a dirty shame.
Split open veins still won't sweeten a sour hate. Can you
hear them screaming..... He's in too deep he's in too deep
She's dead alive. Headless torso arms and legs their ghosts
still remain lifegiving wombsbirthing his pain. <start> Brad
Give me a Bud and a slice
And leave me alone
If I want your advice I'll ask ya
They tell me caviar's nice but I wouldn't know
So what's it to you
Who needs your airs
And your microbrew
together
Look at the sun
See how it hangs
So still in the sky
Brad
Give me the new TV Guide
And get off the phone
Go on and take sides it's not my problem
Waiting for worlds to collide in the comfort of home
They say Lucifer's free
What shall we do
Don't ask me
Joe
But it's not like I never go beyond these walls
I've got culture
I go to the movies
Last week saw the new Tarantino
Starring  shit what's that guy's name again
You know the scene where they put the blowtorch to his balls
Bloody brilliant
My daughter threw up she didn't understand
I told her it's just like the Beano
It's not real
And if it was well so what
Let's all lighten up
Brad
Give me a Bud and a slice
And leave out the book
I've got one of those thank you
As for the guru you prize he might be a crook
And LA's so hot
Still I might go
Or might not
together
Look at the sun
See how it hangs
So still in the sky <start> here she comes maybe this time she will notice me
a simple smile or a wave would mean so much
but she'll just walk right be she never says hello to me
oh well i guess i'm just down on my luck
and i'm trying to be cool
as she walks right by
trying to pretend
that she never caught my eye
as soon as she's out of sight
i'll walk home once again
spend the rest of the night
with her vision in my head
and as she's drawing near
she stops to tie her shoe
here comes the nervousness
of not knowing what to do
i offer her my hand
to help her to get up
tell her that she's beautiful
and then she tells me she's in love
with another guy
why does this always happen to me
why are they always so happy
in love with someone else
before i get a chance
what has he got that i don't have
that i don't have <start> By the end of the Great War the Dandy Warhols had progressed
Far beyond the traditional jug band sound Zia had all but hung up
The washtub bass in favor of her new invention
Which she called the 'Synthesizer'
The Banjo was still there but now it was electrified
Through a flat microphone which Pete had wound tightly
With copper wire and called his 'Pickup'
And in turn made it louder by what Fat Head jokingly called 'Petes Amp'
Well the name stuck and by the time such luminaries
As Gene Vincent Elvis Presley and B. B. King
Had heard this new Warhols sound
They were calling it 'Rock and Roll'
Dandy front man Courtney TaylorTaylor
Would be quoted as saying
I know its only 'Rock and Roll' but I think I like it
Im Bill Curtis and youre listening to a piece of history <start> You don't tell me anything
Its not a dream
Its not a big lie
You're not going anywhere
You don't care
You think that's fine
You don't owe me anything
The offering
Is already mine
Your best friend is everywhere
They don't care
They think you're slime
You don't even know
What it means to
Take your own advice and then
Expect me to look surprised
After a while you know the style and that's enough to kno you suck
And when you know to stop the show because you know they know
I know its sad but don't feel bad they knew they had it coming
After a while it hurts to smile and if you laugh its just a typical miracle <start> Oooooooo
Merry Christmas Saint Nick
Christmas comes this time each year
Well way up north where the air gets cold
There's a tale about Christmas
That you've all been told
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red
And he spends all year workin' out on his sled
It's the little Saint Nick 
It's the little Saint Nick 
Just a little bobsled we call the old Saint Nick
But she'll walk a toboggan with a four speed stick
She's candy apple red with a ski for a wheel
And when Santa hits the gas man just watch her peel
It's the little Saint Nick 
It's the little Saint Nick 
Run run reindeer
Run run reindeer whoaa
Run run reindeer
Run run reindeer 
And haulin' through the snow at a frightening speed
With a half a dozen deer with Rudy to lead
He's got to wear his goggles 'cause the snow really flies
And he's cruisin' every path with a little surprise
It's the little Saint Nick 
It's the little Saint Nick 
Oooooooo
Merry Christmas Saint Nick 
Oooooooo
Merry Christmas Saint Nick 
Oooooooo
Merry Christmas Saint Nick  <start> Her bed is wet with tears
She cries all night
Until this vision disappears
She falls asleep at dusk
Here soul's an empty husk
Her dreams
She tried to stove
They crash and burn
She's all alone
Her green eyes fade to gray
In a way
She tries to smile again
She tries to act like they're just friends
She tries to hide her scars
She puts her conscience
Behind bars
She hates the song he plays
She thinks that he won't stay anyway
Her green eyes fade to gray
In a way
And I'm crying with joy
When I'm looking at you
All the terrible things that
You made me go through
I know my place
I stay on this track
Don't you try to run away 'cause
Until you want me
I will haunt you
Until you want me
I will break your fucking will
Until you want me
'Til I get you
I will never ever let you go
'Til you want me
I will haunt
You <start> You've haunted me all my life
Through endless days and countless nights
There was a storm when I was just a kid
Stripped the last code of innocence
You've haunted me all my life
You're always out of reach when I'm in pursuit
Long winded then suddenly mute
And there's a flaw in my heart's design
For I keep trying to make you mine
You've haunted me all my life
You've haunted me all my life
You are the mistress I can't make a wife
And you've haunted me all my life
And so I wait but I never seem to learn
How to capture your diminishing returns
I still see you through the eyes of a child
Not even thinking we could tame the wild
You've haunted me all my life
You've haunted me all my life
You are the mistress I can't make a wife
And you've haunted me all my life
You've haunted me all my life
You've haunted me all my life
You are the mistress I can't make a wife
And you've haunted me all my life <start> I recall the day when I was in thee
Thee womb I could hear you so soon
I will see your face
I liked to play alone
Never ever all alone
My first day to school was so exciting
Although they all went on and on
Still rest my head for my wrongs
High school days are dark
So light the flame
Walking down those halls
So light the flame
Learning who I'm not
So light the flame
No idea of who I'm to be
My leash was long and so you let me run on
Like all good moms and dads must do
Guess I'll have to do it too
And while I'm cookin' down
So light the flame
My precious torch burns on and on
Set a flame to the daily paper
Cause there is just no justice here
And who really cares
Skipping through your fire
The first flame
Light dispelling dark
Returning to my roots
Our first flame
Of exactly who
Getting to that place
My first flame
Peace runs through my days
Finally crawling through
The first flame
With my source my shield my you <start> Flew in from London
Only to shop th Avenue
They've got what she wants
They just don't get it over there
She's so attractive
And she'll do anything to stay that way
Money's no object to make a boy stop and stare

High fashion model magazines
Runways of ageless beauty queens
Everything for the girl next door
Manhattan styles parisienne look
Lipstick and cheekbones by the book
She'll never leave you wanting more
She looks so cosmo
Her eyes can talk to a camera
No imperfection
Protecting every man's dream
She'll hypnotize you
Right from her hair to her fingernails
In shadows and highlights
She'll make you burst at the seams
repeat chorus
repeat chorus <start> Take what you want
Cause I've been lied to cheated on knocked down and kicked in the head
I think I'll get drunk
Cause there's no reason to stick around feeling down lying in bed
You use to say I was your one and only
That we fit fit like a glove
Now you're goin' and want to leave me lonely

I hate love
You're the reason
You're the reason I hate love
You're pissin' me off
Cause there's no words to break through get you to give in to me
You're stressing me out
Cause I've been so confused self abused crazy's what you want me to be <start> A young girl give me a good luck charm
Put a snake on my neck and a bird on my arm
Got one good leg 'cause the other went south
Got a brand new crutch and a brand new mouth
I got a sheriff's name branded where I should have kept clean
If you get too close you're going to know what I mean
And I know when I'm old the only runnin' gonna come
Away from lips and the fork of my tongue
It only gets to me in times like these
And times like these are getting to me
Put your hand in the oven there's a heaven inside
It burns straight through but the devil don't mind
Because he takes what he wants and he finds what you hide
And it will buy you a place on the Lower East Side
I rolled a number last night and I walked in my sleep
I could feel all the nerves in the tips of my teeth
As they crumbled into dust and washed into the sea
Finally shut my mouth so I could hear myself think
It only gets to me in times like these
It only gets to me in times like these
It only gets to me in times like these
And times like these are getting to me <start> Anthony bullied at school
Get your own back now you are cool
Or are you scared
Bunking off though you're a toff
It's all gone wrong again you've got double maths
And the teacher's got no control so
The boys will run riot you will stay quiet
Or you will die
Tony at the back of the gym
Smoke another one your chances are slim
Cause here they come again
And they got you on the ground
Tasting blood again at least it's your own
When will you realize that it never pays
To be smarter than teachers
Smarter than most boys
Shut your mouth start kicking the football
Bang on the teeth you're off for a week boy
You may as well take it in the guts it can't get worse
Take it in the guts it can't get worse than this
You'll soon be old enough to leave them
And without a notion of a care
You'll lift two fingers in the air to linger there
Tony you're a bit of a mess
Melted Toblerone under your dress
And if the boys could see you they would pass you right bye
Blue mascara running over your eye
When will you realize that it never pays
To be smarter than teachers
Smarter than most boys
Shut your mouth start kicking the football
Bang on the teeth you're off for a week boy <start> I used to be in love with the world
Until I listened to the leaders words
I used to hang around with the guys
When they told me to split I fucking near died
I used to be in love I used to go to the horror shows
Now I don't bother cause I'm one myself
When I go out the people stare
Cause I look like a psychopathic killer
I used to be in love <start> If you're looking for some action
Or just way to pass the time
Looking for adventure
Or a partner in crime
A part time lover
you know it ain't no sin
I never said that you should but baby
You can count me in
Put me on the scene of the crime
let's hit every joint in town
Roll the dice and roll the cash
Till the sun goes down
I'll put my cards on the table
Lord knows I'm bout to win
I never said that you should but baby
You can count me in
Just one last for the road
Make it 'one to go'
pop one for the supper you know
my pulse is running slow
light one up for the sinner
water it down with gin
never said that you should but baby
you can count me in
We'll borrow someone's crib for the night
down on Rampart street
while you make your way over the balcony
I'll call some folks you've got to meet
work out the switch for the stereo
serve some good ole gin
wanna do some living on the edge
than baby you can count me in <start>  <start> You know you know you know I'm a liar
I can't I can't get burnt by the fire
But you had too
I know its you when you come around crying
I cannot sleep with a room full of trying
But you had too
Its not cool
Ohh ohh the things you do
don't make me cry she said she doesn't want to go
Don't make me cry I can't make her so I won't
You come to me in a terrible hour
I can not sleep so I'll go have a shower
But you had too its not cool
Ohh ohh the things you do
don't make me cry she said she doesn't want to go
Don't make me cry I can't make her so I won't
Don't make me cry she said she doesn't want to go
Don't make me cry I can't make her so I won't
you know you know you know I'm a liar
You know you know you know I'm a liar
You know you know you know I'm a liar
You know you know you know I'm a liar
You know you know you know I'm a liar
You know you know you know I'm a liar <start>  <start> I couldn't sleep last night
'Cause I tried to forget you
In the suffocated air
I resolved to let you go
Twisted all our dreams
Til you became the nightmare
Close it off inside
Or else the hurt is gonna rise
I couldn't sleep last night
'Cause I tried to forget you
Heard the old man and the sea
Singing low
And the silver fir she cried
Never forget had gone and died
And the babes that clung to her
Had all let go
My dear she touched my skin
And oh did the skin
Set a burning
My dear she touched my skin
Where once we kissed and ran
The memory scorched the man
I have to tell you dear 
Death has become my breathing 
My dear she touched my skin 
And oh she did she touched my skin 
Where once we kissed and ran 
This madness haunted the man 
Still I'm holding out my hand
Standing by my haunted man
Yes your ghosts have got me too
But it's me and you
I can't run
Still I'm holding out my hand
Standing by my haunted man
Yes your ghosts have got me too
But it's me and you
I can't run <start> How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man
Yes 'n' how many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand
Yes and how many times must the cannon balls fly
Before they're forever banned
The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind.
How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky
Yes 'n' how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry
Yes 'n' how many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died
The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind.
How many years can a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the sea
Yes 'n' how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free
Yes 'n' how many times can a man turn his head
Pretending he just doesn't see
The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind. <start> Forging a difference we summon existence
This distance is not what it seems
Painstaking process it pulls at our instincts
We're living outside of our means
So long
I've hoped
To be strong
Downsloped
And the damage will commence
The beginning of the end
And the damage will commence
All these occurances bring me to life
All that I've sacrificed makes it seem right
Don't underestimate how hard I'll try
This is our final cry
Placing a marker on what I must offer
It's slowly becoming unfair
Will I recover from being pulled under
I'm desperate and gasping for air
So long
I've hoped
To be strong
Downsloped
This is not anything that came from me
You have embedded it within my seed
All of my memories are blending in
Now the real damage will begin
And the damage will commence
The beginning of the end
And the damage will commence
All these occurances bring me to life
All that I've sacrificed makes it seem right
Don't underestimate how hard I'll try
This is our final cry
This is our final cry
This is our final cry
This is our final cry
This is our final cry
It's the beginning of the end
All these occurances bring me to life
All that I've sacrificed makes it seem right
Don't underestimate how hard I'll try
This is our final cry
This is our final cry
This is our final cry
This is our final cry <start> Why is the whole frickin' world against me
And why does it seem that I can't even turn around
Without someone finding disapproval of me
Well I say screw it
I'm so golly gee sick and tired of buying into their lies
When all they do is parade around with fear discomfort and pain in their eyes
And I feel it again yeah I feel it again <start> Pity my brother
For how he's suffered me
Through nameless towns
And cold prairie
For restless women
At the end of the line
Who tendered checks for
A promise divine
Cash as quick as vegas
Like vegas in a dream
I work this charismatic ruse
For my brother's peace and being
Sittin' tight in Moline
The money on the bed
With every memory sharp to me
And the fear of times ahead
Maybe the good book
Came from the divine
Or maybe it was written
Just to keep us in line
The mistakes of the sages
Make the rules for the fools
So father forgive me
For bendin' the rules....
Well mister he improved some
With the money I scammed
Some days his light shines as bright
As the light of the promised land
Death was often something
We freely would discuss
When he was ten and I was twelve
And the spectre would often brush
In and out of treatments
Since twenty months of age
At eighteen the insurance
No longer would maintain
And my old man in the kitchen
His hands upon his face
Did weep to shake his very soul
In the darkness of this place
Maybe the good book
Came from the divine
Or maybe it was written
Just to keep us in line
The mistakes of the sages
Make the rules for the fools
So father forgive me
For bendin' the rules....
Hold me Saint Christopher
Over every county line
Overlook my blasphemy
For the sake of buying time
Grant him days of laughter
Bestow me clemency
He sleeps soft in the backseat
His freedom from ordeal
To every ruddy youngster
Off free in summer's fields
And every young lass poised to claim
Her share of what love yields
To all the grieving angels
And the litany of saints
I am my brother's keeper
To what end decides the fates
Maybe the good book
Came from the divine
Or maybe it was written
Just to keep us in line
The mistakes of the sages
Make the rules for the fools
So father for give me
For bendin' the rules..... <start> Night has fallen
Curtains are drawn
And I've been singing
The same old song
About
How it feels
To be lost and alone
In a faraway place
My love
I see al million lights
And they all blend
Into the night
Visions slip into view
They all remind me of you
And what it is you might be doing
At the other end of the night
Every country I go
I travel the plane and open road
As the sky unravels the truth unfolds
I've been looking in the eyes of love
I see a million lights
And they all blend
Into the night
Visions slip into view
They all remind me of you
And what it is you might be doing
At the other end of the night <start> Here is the news
Coming to you every hour on the hour

The weather's fine but there may be a meteor shower.
Here is the news
A cure's been found for good old rocket lag

Someone left their life behind in a plastic bag.

Toda sua vida em  segundos
Uma volta no ponteiro do relgio pra viver
O tempo corre contra mim
Sempre foi assim e sempre vai ser
Vivendo apenas pra vencer a falta que me faz voc
De olhos fechados eu tento esconder a dor agora
Por favor entenda eu preciso ir embora porque

But I wrote the song that broke your fucking heart.
I'm caught up in 'no sleep' and I nod my head with every tear but they're still drowning me.
It's cold and I can barely see and  AM is here again so hang your head with me.
I was walking next to you in a saturday nighttype light.
The faces blurred in with yours as I stumbled some words on life...
I was breathing thanks to you in a saturday nighttype light.
And when the faceless kids danced towards faceless ends I quit life.
I can't believe that you're not dead
shrugged my shoulders laughed inside nodded my head.
And I don't remember anything but seven songs of chances gone that's all I know.
Anytime you want to go I'm ready to go.
Nothing shines on feeling old this isn't right.
All I want is a reason to smile before I'm dead I'm dead I live in denial.
There's nothing left inside of me.
You say there's more but I don't fucking care. <start> Twelve o'clock
No one around
Traces of shoes
On the ground
Rainy days
Darkness and haze
Puddles and dirt
Days are so short
Nights are long
Going slow
Tonight ain't windy
The nature is greedy
Noise of the package
My senses are damaged
Gloomy and scary
Just crap or something to me <start> Mercy mercy why didn't we hear it
Mercy mercy why did we read it
Buried on the last page of our morning papers
The plan was drafted drafted in secret
Gunboats met the red tide
Driven to the rum trade for the army that they created
But the bullets were bought by us it was dollars that paid them
Please forgive us we don't know what was done
Please forgive us we don't know what was done in our name
There'll be more trials like this in mercenary hey days
When they're so apt to wrap themselves up in the stripes and stars
And find that they are able to call themselves heroes
And to justify murder by their fighters for freedom
Please forgive us we don't know what was done
Please forgive us we didn't know
Could you ever forgive us I don't know how you could
I know this is no consolation
Please forgive us we don't know what was done
Please forgive us we didn't know
Could you ever believe that we didn't know
Please forgive us we didn't know
I wouldn't blame you if you never could
Please forgive us we didn't know
I wouldn't blame you if you never could
Please forgive us
And you never will <start> On fait comme on a dit tu restes encore huit jours
Le temps d'vous trouver un p'tit nid pour votre grand amour
J'ai pas grand' chose  dire pas trop d'conseils  donner
Mais tu devrais rflchir les larmes t'as dj donner
Tu peux prparer l'caf noir
Tes nuits blanches et mme ton mouchoir
Il est pire que moi tu l'sais bien
Et j'suis dj pas un saint
Je n't'avais pas promis mes plus belles annes
Elles sont loin derrire moi mais le pass c'est le pass
L'important aujourd'hui bien sr c'est ton bonheur
Mais je l'vois mal parti avec cet oiseau de malheur
Tu peux prparer l'caf noir
Tes nuits blanches et mme ton mouchoir
Il est pire que moi tu l'sais bien
Et j'suis dj pas un saint
On fait comme on a dit entre nous c'est net
Tu s'ras l'amie d'mon ami j'essaierai de faire avec
Et si j'tiens pas la route je sais o vous trouver
La nuit o l'insomnie f'ra qu'j'ai envie d'vous parler
Tu peux prparer l'caf noir
Tes nuits blanches et mme ton mouchoir
Il est pire que moi tu l'sais bien
Et j'suis dj pas un saint <start> I stood stonelike at midnight suspended in my masquerade
I combed my hair till it was just right and commanded the night brigade
I was open to pain and crossed by the rain and I walked on a crooked crutch
I strolled all alone through a fallout zone and came out with my soul untouched
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said Sit down I stood up.
Oohooh growin' up
The flag of piracy flew from my mast my sails were set wing to wing
I had a jukebox graduate for first mate she couldn't sail but she sure could sing
I pushed be and bombed 'em with the blues with my gear set stubborn on standing
I broke all the rules strafed my old high school never once gave thought to landing
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said Come down I threw up
Oohooh growin' up
I took monthlong vacations in the stratosphere and you know it's really hard to hold your breath.
I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress
Well my feet they finally took root in the earth but I got me a nice little place in the stars
And I swear I found the key to the universe in the engine of an old parked car
I hid in the mother breast of the crowd but when they said Pull down I pulled up
Oohooh growin' up. Oohooh growin' up <start> From the clatter of Honky tonk
To the quiet of the range
Been thinkin bout silence golden
Golden silence change
Burning nights gets damper
And only one moon was cool
As the steam of danger rose
From a rippleless darkened pool
Came to America stopped out in the west
Ain't no shotgun rider alligator on my chest
Hotbed of indifference seedbed of soso
It's push and shove  lord above
what a way to go
Don't say that you love me
Just say you might
You keep holding me
To things you think are right
Yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh
Land of hope and glory
Seen foreign soldiers
Beachhead army ducks
Seen local farmers
In their big red pick up trucks
Seen drugstore cowboys
Who could not find the range
Seen fools in the city
Who could do with a change <start> War made him a soldier
Little Frankie Mear
Peace left him a loser
The little bombardier
Lines of worry appeared with age
Unskilled hands that knew no trade
Spent his time in the picture house
The little bombardier
Frankie drank his money
The little that he made
Told his woes to no man
Friendless lonely days
Then one day in the ABC
Four bright eyes gazed longingly
At the icecream in the hand of
The little bombardier
Sunshine entered our Frankie's days
Gone his worries his hopeless maze
His life was fun and his heart was full of joy
Two young children had changed his aims
He gave them toffees and played their games
He brought them presents with every coin he made
Then two gentlemen called on him
Asked him for his name
Why was he friends with the children
Were they just a game
Leave them alone or we'll get sore
We've had blokes like you in the station before
The hand of authority said no more
To the little bombardier
Packed his bags his heart in pain
Wiped a tear and caught a train
Not to be seen in the town again
The little bombardier <start> I gave up on you a long time ago
How can you blame me
We made plans to meet and you never showed
You kept me waiting
They said everything would work out just fine
They said you'd help me
But as it turns out it was all a lie
And they're off someplace far away laughing at me
You've been there for me one time in my life
But it didn't matter
You came and went so fast all my hope
And faith in you shattered
And now here I sit alone in this room
No one to confide in
You watched all my dreams come apart at the seams
You laughed you left you waited in hiding
Bless me dark father I have sinned
I've done it before and I'll do it again
'Cause it keeps me warm and makes you smile
Been beneath me all the while
Hell yes
You gave up on me along time ago
I can't say I blame you
I rejected the faith in your holy rays
Is what it comes down to
They said everything would work out just fine
I just went crazy
But I'm better now having a good time
Being selfish and drunken and vulgar and lazy
Bless me dark father I have sinned
I've done it before and I'll do it again
'cause it keeps me warm and makes you smile
Been beneath me all the while
Bless me dark father I can't win
Without you I'm as good as dead
'Cause you keep me warm you make me smile
You've been on my shoulder all the while
Whispering sweet nothings
Whispering sweet nothings
Whispering sweet nothings
You've been whispering sweet nothings <start> I lit out from Reno
I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didn't get to sleep that night
'Till the morning came around.
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight.
Ran into the devil babe
He loaned me twenty bills
I spent the night in Utah
In a cave up in the hills.
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight.
I ran down to the levee
But the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill
And vanished in the air.
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight.
Got two reasons why I cry
Away each lonely night
The first one's named Sweet Anne Marie
And she's my hearts delight.
The second one is prison baby
The sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me
I'll spend my life in jail.
Got a wife in Chino babe
And one in Cherokee
The first one says she's got my child
But it don't look like me.
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight.
You can borrow from the devil
You can borrow from a friend
The devil'll loan ya twenty
But your friend got only ten <start> I grew up in North Alabama back in the 's
When dinosaurs still roamed the earth Speaking
Of course of the Three Great Alabama Icons
George Wallace Bear Bryant and Ronnie Van Zant
Now Ronnie Van Zant wasn't from Alabama he was
From Florida He was a huge Neil Young fan
But in the tradition of Merle Haggard writin'
Okie from Muskogee to tell his dad's point of
View about the hippies 'n Vietnam Ronnie felt
That the other side of the story should be told.
And Neil Young always claimed that Sweet Home
Alabama was one of his favorite songs. And legend
Has it that he was an honorary pall bearer at
Ronnie's funeral such is the Duality of the
Southern Thing And Bear Bryant wore a cool
Lookin' red checkered hat and won football
Games and there's few things more loved in
Alabama than football and the men who know how to
Win at it So when the Bear would come to town
There'd be a parade. And me I was one a' them
Pussy boys cause I hated football so I got a
Guitar but a guitar was a poor substitute for a
Football with the girls in my high school So my
Band hit the road and we didn't play no
Skynyrd either I came of age rebellin'
Against the music in my high school parkin'
Lot It wasn't till years later after
Leavin' the South for a while that I came to
Appreciate and understand the whole Skynyrd thing
And its misunderstood glory I left the South
And learned how different people's perceptions
Of the Southern Thing was from what I'd seen in
My life Which leads us to George Wallace Now
Wallace was for all practical purposes the
Governor of Alabama from  until  Once
When a law prevented him from succeeding himself
He ran his wife Lerline in his place and she won
By a landslide He's most famous as the
Belligerent racist voice of the segregationist
 Find more Lyrics on httpmplyrics.orgNEt 
South Standing in the doorways of schools and
Waging a political war against a Federal
Government that he decried as hypocritical And
Wallace had started out as a lawyer and a judge
With a very progressive and humanitarian track
Record for a man of his time. But he lost his
First bid for governor in  by hedging on the
Race issue against a man who spoke out against
Integration Wallace ran again in ' as a
Staunch segregationist and won big and for the
Next decade spoke out loudly He accused Kennedy
And King of being communists. He was constantly on
National news representing the good people
Of Alabama And you know race was only an issue
On TV in the house that I grew up in Wallace
Was viewed as a man from another time and place
And when I first ventured out of the South I was
Shocked at how strongly Wallace was associated
With Alabama and its people Ya know racism is a
Worldwide problem and it's been since the
Beginning of recorded history and it ain't
Just white and black But thanks to George
Wallace it's always a little more convenient to
Play it with a Southern accent. And bands like
Lynyrd Skynyrd attempted to show another side of
The South One that certainly exists but few
Saw beyond the rebel flag And this applies not
Only to their critics and detractors but also
From their fans and followers. So for a while
When Neil Young would come to town he'd get
Deaththreats down in Alabama Ironically in
 after a particularly racially charged
Campaign Wallace began backpedaling and he
Opened up Alabama politics to minorities at a rate
Faster than most Northern states or the Federal
Government. And Wallace spent the rest of his life
Trying to explain away his racist past and in
 won his last term in office with over  of
The black vote Such is the Duality of the
Southern Thing And George Wallace died back in
' and he's in Hell now not because he's a
Racist His track record as a judge and his
Latelife quest for redemption make a good
Argument for his being at worst no worse than
Most white men of his generation North or
South But because of his blind ambition and his
Hunger for votes he turned a blind eye to the
Suffering of Black America. And he became a pawn
In the fight against the Civil Rights cause
Fortunately for him the Devil is also a

Er hat vor zwei Tagen ein Kind umgebracht.
Jetzt ist El Cattivo auf der Flucht
vor dem Vater des Kindes der ihn sucht
Als sich der Halunke am nchsten Morgen sonnt
erblickt er den Vater am Horizon.
Er lauert ihm auf in einem kleinen Wald
und schiet ihn nieder aus dem Hinterhalt
Und Er lchelt denn Er wei
das Bse siegt immer
Ja so mu ein Cowboy sein
dreckig feige und gemein
Heja  ho
Am Abend kommt der Bsewicht in eine kleine Stadt
Er berfllt zwei alte Frau'n weil er kein Geld mehr hat
Seine kleine Beute verspielt er im Saloon
danach bekommt ein Blinder mit ihm zu tun
Nachts schaut er noch einmal beim Freudenhaus vorbei
und wird dort Zeuge einer Schlgerei
als einer der Streitenden zu Boden fllt
da tritt er ihn so doll er kann
und klaut ihm dann sein ganzes Geld
Und Er lchelt denn Er wei
das Bse siegt immer
Ja so mu ein Cowboy sein
dreckig feige und gemein
Heja  ho <start> Contagious like
the rhythm of a record
through my mind
Played slowly to emphasize
the condition of a dead line.
So hopeless so let the record
play on and on and on...
Can I speak
Can I speak now
Without a voice to call my own I'm left
walk these streets alone
Waiting through the afternoon again.
Time can't get the best of me.
Surely I will never be
Waiting through the afternoon again.
Don't rush it
Cause I'm not living my one life without danger.
 and then I'm Left waiting
Let the record play on and on and on...
Can I speak
Can I speak now
Without a voice to call my own
I'm left walk these streets alone
Waiting through the afternoon again.
Time can't get the best of me. Surely I will never be
Waiting through the afternoon again. <start> Night crawls on old San Juan
No person is missing no one knows I'm gone
I'm full of fire never been better never been higher
Both butcher and the baker shake like earthquake
Never felt faker I'm gonna watch the smoke slip into the sky
We are the remnant of the latchkey kids
Assumed to pick up rules but we never ever did
We were running out of mind just to help us unwind
We would run into the field to find the things that were real
Digging tunnels through the sand
Hold the earth within our hand
Spend the night inside a dream
Moving earth and changing things
We would run out to the field to hide the things that were real <start> With a song in my heart
And a chance to be yours forever
I couldn't feel more secure
I know I couldn't feel any better
Oh Lord Heaven knows
How much I love you and
How much it shows
Oh Lord Heaven
Heaven knows
Every time we're together
Your love is moving like lightning through me
It's such a beautiful feeling
Never hearing goodbye said to me
Oh Lord Heaven knows
How much I love you and
How much it shows
Oh Lord Heaven
Heaven knows
I was living without you
Trying to make it alone
But there is something about you
Now your heart is my home
With a song in my heart
And a chance to be yours forever
I couldn't feel more secure
I know I couldn't feel any better
Oh Lord Heaven knows
How much I love you and
How much it shows
Oh Lord Heaven
Heaven knows
Oh Lord Heaven knows
How much I love you and
How much it shows
Oh Lord Heaven
Heaven knows <start> Running down an empty road you're the guiding light
Which takes all my fears but I should have known
That truth disappears as your words became black
Dust in the streets
...and I hear another lie.
With shining eyes and hands of a friend you promised me joy
And heaven on earth but I should have known
That it wouldn't last you pulled my heart out of my chest
...and I hear another lie  empty words are passing by
You sealed my fate.
I curse you with my endless hate
It's all in vain
Your false smile awakes my pain.
No more denials
I've seen you without your masquerade.
I call you a liar.
My trust in you will never be the same.
You used to be the meaning of life you gave me a reason
To keep dreams alive but my future failed
The moment I tried to live my own life with your plans by my side
You sealed..
No more...
You play your game and I am your toy but don't forget bitch
I 'a man not a boy you made the rules
But I am the ace you cannot win 'cause I know your real face
You sealed...
No more... <start> Right in front of me
A couple makes what could melt the snow
Making fun of me
A single look never cut me so
And I know
To save the conversation
I know
A deeper contemplation
Is all I need to make believe
Everyone would love me if I could fool the world
Walk away from me
I see the change in the atmosphere
What a way to be
To turn the page
Just to make it clear
and I know
To change the conversation
I know
A deeper contemplation
Is all I need to make believe
Everyone would love me if I could fool the world
To fear
Or to disappear
What a waste of time
What a troubled mind
A fortune find for another day
As your passing by
You look behind
To see what I would say
and I know
To change the conversation
I know
A deeper contemplation
Is all I need to make believe
Everyone would love me
so I go
And change the conversation
I know
A deep conversation
Is all I need to make believe
Everyone would love me
If I could fool
The world
instrumental break
I can't survive another day in the live
Without a day in the sun
Before you touch me
Here's a word of advice
If I were you I would
Come get it
Come get it
Come get it
so won't you tell mewhy it is
That ever corner of my head is a home
But every fool is the same
It would be tragic if you left me alone
But left me no one to blame
well don't it make you wonder what got us here
The covers that were under could disappear
Promises keep us in chains my dear

What am I feeling
 <start> It's never easy to say goodbye
To the faces
So rarely do we see another one
So close and so long
I asked the room if I'd said enough
No one really answered
They just said Don't go don't go
Well all this leaving is neverending
I kept hoping for one more question
Or for someone to say
Who do you think you are
So I could tell them
With intensity the drop evaporates by law
In conclusion leaving is easy
When you've got some place you need to be
I'm giving up this gig for another seaon
With the TV on mute
I'm listening back to the tapes
On the hotel bed
My my my apocalypse
I realized I had said very little about ways or wheels
Or riding for the feeling
Riding for the feeling
Is the fastest way to reach the shore
On water or land
Riding for the feeling
What if I had stood there at the end
And said again and again and again and again and again
An answer to every question
Riding for the feeling
Would that have been a suitable goodbye <start> You can't disappear anymore
I see your face lurking outside the window
You say you're a trife I'm a bore
You touch yourself put your face in the pillow
But the funny thing about you is
You remembered to leave it behind
And the funny thing about me is
I'm a member of the Right Brigade
Makes no difference to me what side you choose
What side will lose
All there is to perceive is what I want
And I Know how to get it
But the funny thing about you is
You remembered to leave it behind
And the funny thing about me is
I'm a member of the Right Brigade
Right Brigade
Right Brigade <start> I said let's go move 'em out
Whole world's waitin andiamo
I swear to God last night
Heard a beckon at my window
Sayin' Goodbye Bedford fat man so long
If I tie you on a roof tomorrow I'm gone
Last night I heard a beckon at my window sayin'
Wide open wide wide open wide
They said Sit down calm down
Think about what it is you're sayin'
You can't just do anything you wanna to do
You think you still get a shoeshine
Shine your shoes throw a dime
Heat fields wavin' a welcome sign
Well there's a street man walkin' on dead bird shoes
Blind Zen Horatio's coughin' up blues
Sit down and pay the rent
We'll fill you full of coffee in the mornin'
Wide open wide wide open wide
I said let's go move 'em out
Whole world's waitin' andiamo
I swear to God last night
Heard a beckon at my window
Sayin' Goodbye Bedford fat man so long
Tie your dreams on mud or glory
Don't look back until the mornin'
Last night I heard a beckon at my window sayin'
Wide open wide wide open wide
Wide open wide wide open wide <start> When you were a boy
You had no place inside your parents' world
You were falling like the leaves
From an old and dying tree
You went to school
But the teachers made you feel a fool
While the children played with joy
You were the one they would avoid
Some day
You will find a better place to stay
You'll never need to feel this way again
Again again
Show a smile
They'd like to have you in their members' club
They'll buy you drinks and tell you lies
They pour rumbrella with some ice
No one cares
About that fucking pretty face you have
It means nothing much this life
So find the highest cliff and dive
Some day
You will find a better place to stay
You'll never need to feel this way again
Again again
Some day
You will find a better place to stay
You'll never need to feel this way again
Again again
Some day
You will find a better place to stay
You'll never need to feel this way again
Again again <start> Whatever happened to waiting
Numb lips move too fast for care
And it just happens that I'm thinking
Starving for breath of hope in heart I fell asleep to you breathing
Showing signs of wanting what I cant give
Close off my spirit and give in to
Touches too close to be so far
Regrets stay here when you'll be gone
Too dark to see sheets cold to touch
Promise for more hold strong to show yourself that
You want what's given to wait for one
One heart forever will beat for yours <start> To think that you were mine I never thought you'd be so wild
You played around with everyone anytime at all
I thought you were bein' friendly when you took them home to tea
I've been a fool yes a fool to myself
I've been a fool yes a fool to myself
When I used to ring you  you said you were ill in bed
I should've realized yes you were ill but in your head
There's only one thing left for me to say it's this my friend
I've been a fool yes a fool to myself
I've been a fool yes a fool to myself
Life I know is not a dream
A dream of your A T
But must you go  try to make some kind of monkey out of me
If this life you're livin' suits your temperament  your face
I'm ever tryin' to change it I will leave you in disgrace
There's only one thing left for me to say it's this my friend
I've been a fool yes a fool to myself
I've been a fool yes a fool to myself <start> Tengo la sangre fra de tus venas
Entre rosales para m solito
Tengo el tibio soplo de tu aliento
Entre un frasquito para m solito.
Coro
Pero no tengo certeza pero no
Nananananananana
No la tengo no la tengo no la tengo.
Tengo el dulce sabor de tu mirada
En mis anteojos para m solito.
Coro
Tengo el masticar de tus caricias
Saboreando para mi solito
Tengo la lluvia fresca de tu pecho
Refrescando para m solito.
Coro
 <start> I'm just sitting doing nothing
Wondering where I should go
People tell me I'm just lazy
Weather or not it's true I don't know
So I'm just sitting doing nothing
Wondering where I should go
Many people that I've encountered
Say they wish that they were free
And I know that secretly
All those people would really like to be me
So even though they tell me I'm idle
Why should I do what they say
For they're in the same place all the time
But I'm only there for a day <start> When I look out my window
Many sights to see.
And when I look in my window
So many different people to be
That it's strange so strange.
You've got to pick up every stitch
You've got to pick up every stitch
You've got to pick up every stitch
Mmm must be the season of the witch
Must be the season of the witch yeah
Must be the season of the witch.
When I look over my shoulder
What do you think I see
Some other cat looking over
His shoulder at me
And he's strange sure he's strange.
You've got to pick up every stitch
You've got to pick up every stitch
Beatniks are out to make it rich
Oh no must be the season of the witch
Must be the season of the witch yeah
Must be the season of the witch.
You've got to pick up every stitch
The rabbits running in the ditch
Beatniks are out to make it rich
Oh no must be the season of the witch
Must be the season of the witch
Must be the season of the witch.
When I look out my window
What do you think I see
And when I look in my window
So many different people to be
It's strange sure is strange.
You've got to pick up every stitch
You've got to pick up every stitch
The rabbits running in the ditch
Oh no must be the season of the witch
Must be the season of the witch yeah
Must be the season of the witch.
When I look when I look. <start> The stars are fading through the nigth
Falling from in the sky
I tryed to ride may way
But nothing happened
My feelings so confused
Everything was changed
Something was so wrong
I was alone
No friends to talk
No place to hide
Where you gone You don't explained
I finally understand ... I'm alone
But I will hold my heart
Be strenght to carry on
I'll hold my heart
To find the way
Why did you go my only friend
I lost my life I've lost my fate
Sorry mom I was late
Sorry dad I'm not like you...
So I will hold my heart
With strenght to carry on
I will hold my heart
To find the way
Oh I will hold my heart
Be strenght to carry on
I'll hold my heart
I'll find the way <start> Man I'm goin home tonight want to see that full moonlight A million roads lead out of here Success and failure happiness and fear But I'll find my own way back across that railroad track Like a baby at your breast In your arms I'm at my best I said hello C'mon let's go
I been goin back and forth One day south the next day north This road that I've been traveling is littered with confusion doubt and sin But I'll find my own way home tonight I stand alone Like a lover in your arms Full of promise full of charms I said hello C'mon let's go
Honey dance for me nice and slow Sing it darling way down deep and low C'mon kiss me once again Be my lover be my very best friend Do do do do do do do We're gonna feel brand new <start> I'm not mad about anything
You forced on me a hopeless dream
I've been looking for one true thing
Too numb to see I've been sleepwalking
Too horrified to see
Wait and think it doesn't get you down
You're flying now but you'll come back down
And with both your feet on the ground
You'll look around yeah you'll look around
Too horrified to see
I've been looking for some harmonies
Some words to sing that could really bring
The lonelyhearted some company
All the people that were just like me yeah
When a decade is spent searching
For something time will never bring
Something starts to shut down inside
My body and my tired mind
Too horrified to see <start> My woman's been accusing me
Of stepping out
Jealous rumors have her mind filled
With so much doubt
And I've gotta convince her
I'm not doing her wrong
Before she leaves me
Sad and all alone
So when the clock hits five
I'll be gone
There's a matter
That I'm gonna settle later on
So if the boss man talks
About overtime
I'm just gonna smile
And pay him no mind
I've got business with my baby tonight
We're gonna talk things over
And make things right
'Cause I couldn't sleep at all
Since we had our fight
I've got business with my baby tonight
We'll go out to dinner
At our favorite restaurant
I'll hold her hand
And tell her she's all I'll ever want
When we get home
I'll take her straight to paradise
And we'll still be loving
Till the morning light
I've got business with my baby tonight
We're gonna talk things over
And make things right
'Cause I couldn't sleep at all
Since we had our fight
I've got business with my baby tonight
Now don't you start talking
About gossip or news
I'm warning you now
I'll put on my walking shoes
'Cause to me nothing in this world
Is a big deal
When it's compared to the way
She makes me feel all right
I've got business with my baby tonight
We're gonna talk things over
And make things right
'Cause I couldn't sleep at all
Since we had our fight
I've got business with my baby tonight
B.B.'s got business tonight
We're gotta talk things over
And make things right
'Cause I couldn't sleep at all
Since we had our fight
I've got business with my baby tonight <start>   
Ooh yeahyeah

And I'll be rockin' and rollin'

Rockin' and rollin'

About a week ago on Monday
I met this chick called Sue.
She said Come over to my place
I'll show you what to do.
I ended up stayin' the night
she did some things that made me feel allright.
We were rockin' and rollin'
rockin' and rollin' rockin' and rollin'.
Rockin' and rollin'

Rockin' rockin' and rollin'.
Wow. <start> We're throwing all caution to the wind
It's better to think about what's ahead then behind them
Only I have a better chance at failure
But my mind has a clever way of turning all the worst to right I've found
Oh no. So tell them like you did it. No maybes
We'll leave it on the radio we're calling all cowards
Now boy that you made it so
Why are you afraid of what you've done
We'll leave it on the radio we're calling all cowards
Now boy that you made it so
Why are you afraid of what you've done No what you've done No
Return to the dirt with this cursed affair
A lever to pull upon and the buried we'll leave there
Only how will they ever find their way to the road to a better place where the memories
they don't live to fade away
Oh no. So tell them like you did it
Oh no. So tell them like you knew
Ditto. So tell them like you knew no maybes
We'll leave it on the radio we're calling all cowards
Now boy that you made it so
Why are you afraid of what you've done
We'll leave it on the radio we're calling all cowards
Now boy that you made it so
Why are you afraid of what you've done
Like you
Uh oh It's the curse of the radio bye bye
Like you
Uh oh It's the curse of the radio bye bye
Like you
Uh oh It's the curse of the radio bye bye.
Like you knew
Oh no so tell them like you did it
Oh no so tell them like you knew.
Ditto so tell them like you knew. No maybes.
We'll leave it on the radio we're calling all cowards.
Now boy that you made it so
Why are you afraid of what you've done
We'll leave it on the radio we're calling all cowards.
Now boy that you made it so
Why are you afraid of what you've done

We'll leave it on the radio we're calling all cowards now <start> Deep in the heart of Germany
Lucy clutched her breast in fear
She heard the beat of her lover's heart
For weeks she raved in dreams he appeared
From far Transylvania
Only a woman can break his spell
Pure in heart who will offer herself
To Nosferatu
This ship pulled in without a sound
The faithful captain long since cold
He kept his log till the bloody end
Last entry read Rats in the hold.
My crew is dead I fear the plague
Only a woman can break his spell
Pure in heart who will offer hefself
To Nosferatu
Mortal terror reigned
Sickness now then horrible death
Only Lucy knew the truth
And at her window
Nosferatu
So chaste so calm she gave herself
To the pleasure of her dreaded master
He sucked the precious drops of life
Throughout the long and cold dark night
One last goodbye he was blinded by love
One last goodbye he was blinded by love
Blinded by love
He screamed with fear he'd stayed too long in her room
The morning sun had come too soon
The spell was broken with a kiss of doom
He vanished into dust left her all alone
Only a woman can break his spell
Pure in heart who will offer herself
To Nosferatu <start> The waitress is cleaning the bar
It's two in the morning.
She offers some coffee to me
Turns the radio on.
The caster is selling
His voice to the night
The coffee gets cold in a while.
The old man beside me is gone
He showed me a blueprint
Of a house he would build
With the money he never could save.
His father is buried down by the sea
Once he was younger than me.
Why am I sad today
Why am I on the way
Down to the border
Not over the line
Why am I sad today
Why am I on the way
Down to the limit of time
I'm sleepless tonight.
Take me away from the gloom
I'm cold from the inside.
The waitress has turned off the lights
There's nothing to fear.
She's put on her coat and once in a while
The lines on her face disappear.
Why am I sad today
Why am I on the way
Down to the border
Not over the line
Why am I sad today
Why am I on the way
Down to the limit of time
Oceans awake and walls break down
When you are there. Oh.
You take my hand
And you just lead me right out of here. Oh yeah.
Why am I sad today
Why am I on the way
Down to the border
Not over the line
Why am I sad today
Why am I on the way
Down to the limit of time
Why am I sad today
Why am I on the way
Down to the border
Not over the line
Why am I sad today
Why am I on the way
Down to the limit of time
I'm sleepless tonight. <start> Johnny's got a problem and he's outta control...
Johnny's got a problem he's outta control
He's got static of the brain outta control
Chippin' every day chipin' deeper and deeper
The girl she looks like a choo choo train
I don't know what you're trying to do John
Looks to me like you got no brain
'cause we used to look up to you
Johnny's got a problem
Johnny's got a problem and he's outta control...
Johnny's got a problem he's outta control
He's got static of the brain outta control
Chippin' every day chipin' for the gipper
Chippin' on chippin' on down the line
Doesn't really matter who you take with you
Just as long as Johnny feels fine
'cause he used to look up to you
Johnny's got a problem
Johnny's got a problem and he's outta control...
Johnny's got a problem he's outta control
He's got static of the brain outta control
Runnin' everyday diggin' your own grave
Until you wise up will you be saved
Johnny after Johnny you're all the same
You play with fire it's a downhill game
'cause we used to look up to you
Johnny's got a problem and he's outta control...
Johnny's got a problem he's outta control
He's got static of the brain outta control
One more for a different job
Johnny's got a problem and he's outta control...
Johnny's got a problem he's outta control
He's got static of the brain outta control
Johnny's got a problem and he's outta control... <start> Eight miles high and when you touch down
You'll find that it's stranger than known
Signs in the street that say where you're going
Are somewhere just being their own
Nowhere is there warmth to be found
Among those afraid of losing their ground
Rain gray town known for its sound
In places small faces unbound
Round the squares huddled in storms
Some laughing some just shapeless forms
Sidewalk scenes and black limousines
Some living some standing alone <start> From the album the hurdy gurdy man
Get your bearings know your time.
Don't you worry weather's fine.
All the world knows what I'm saying
All the world knows what I'm saying
The world knows fine well.
Get together work it out
Simplicity is what it's about.
All the world knows what I'm saying
All the world knows what I'm saying
The world knows fine well. <start>

 <start> Sunset is an angel weeping
Holding out a bloody sword
No matter how I squint I cannot
Make out what it's pointing toward
Sometimes you feel like you've lived too long
Days drip slowly on the page
You catch yourself
Pacing the cage
I've proven who I am so many times
The magnetic strip's worn thin
And each time I was someone else
And every one was taken in
Hours chatter in high places
Stir up eddies in the dust of rage
Set me to pacing the cage
I never knew what you all wanted
So I gave you everything
All that I could pillage
All the spells that I could sing
It's as if the thing were written
In the constitution of the age
Sooner or later you'll wind up
Pacing the cage
Sometimes the best map will not guide you
You can't see what's round the bend
Sometimes the road leads through dark places
Sometimes the darkness is your friend
Today these eyes scan bleachedout land
For the coming of the outbound stage
Pacing the cage
Pacing the cage <start> Instru <start> When I was born
Lot's of people sayin' I looked like a dead man
But to them there was no kindness
And so I came into the world with my hands in my jacket
Made a whole lotta racket
Couldn't speak but I could beat on a stick
Oh when that aeroplane comes with the lord
Will I be ignored
Will I be ignored by the lord
Will I be ignored
There was a woman she looked on me sweetly
I needed her life to be with mine
But never will they meet
No never will they see
These two vines will twist away away
Will I be ignored by the lord
Will I be ignored by the lord by the lord
What for
I may travel on one leg
My breakfast will be unpaid
And the flapjacks will flap back off the ceiling onto my head
Will I be ignored
Will I be ignored by the lord
Will I be ignored <start> Come to me
Kill for me
Worship me
Follow everything I do
As you bow before me
I'm the one they told you
Would come again
Let me show you all the signs
To bring about the end
I'll take you down
To a hole where you
Will always be alone
I'll turn you out
On a world that doesn't
Care if you belong
I'll push you off
Of the throne that
You erected for yourself
You will be tossed
On a pile of all the
Filth that you created
I watched you take the power
In your hands and
Throw it all away
I knew you would
Fall down again someday
Come on now
You know I won't hurt you
Come on now
I'm here to protect you
Come on now I'll
Lead you to shelter
Come on now you know
I'll take you down
To a hole where you
Will always be alone
I'll turn you out
On a world that doesn't
Care if you belong
I'll push you off
Of the throne that
You erected for yourself
You will be tossed
On a pile of all the
Filth that you created
I'll take you down
To a hole where you
Will always be alone
I'll turn you out
On a world that doesn't
Care if you belong
I'll push you off
Of the throne that you
Erected for yourself
You will be tossed
On a pile of all the
Filth that you created <start> Remember when we saw eye to eye
Bound by the oath until the day we fuckin die
I thought these chains would never break
We outlasted all the weak and the fake
As time went on we saw less of one another
I couldn't understand what happened to my brother
Then that day finally fucking came
You lost the edge but I'll never change
You said you'd never fucking change
You're long gone but I'll never quit
Through think and thin
I'll stick with it
Time goes on or so they say
I see you now
You're not the fucking same <start> There's a greyhound bus
Leavin' the great Northwest
Takin' her tonight
Back down south to Texas
She's been dancing' on tables
To pay rent and be able
To just get by and maybe stay clean.
Abilene Abilene
Abilene Abilene.
Well her daddy'd get drunk
Then he'd hit her hard
And her mama'd lie in bed
High on pills and talkin' to God
But like her beautiful tattoos
These old memories she can't lose
Since she ran away at fifteen.
Abilene Abilene
There's a town ahead that you've never seen
Maybe it's better if you get off there and try to
Forget everything
Abilene.
Starin' out the window
At the long cold night
Ahead on the horizon
Is another string of bright lights
She's dreamin' of a man she's goin' to meet
In a bar on an Austin street
Maybe this one won't be so mean.
Abilene Abilene
There's a town ahead that you've never seen
And maybe it's better if you get off there and try to
Forget everything
Abilene.
In a Texas bar there's a man sittin' alone
Thinkin' of a girl he swore he'd wait there for
But he's drinkin' beers and he's feelin' old
Rememberin' every lie he's told
'Til he changes his mind and he leaves.
Abilene Abilene
There's a town ahead that you've never seen
Maybe it's better if you get off there and try to
Forget everything
Abilene Abilene
Oh Abilene Abilene. <start> Welcome to real life
What's in the cards
Reason has folded
Passion departs
Cause you picked your poison
In the words of tainted hearts
There's a truth behind this folly
End is a start
So break off the bough
You want it all but you don't know how
You're shakin' on an autumn tree
You take a little part of me
What was the point of going insane
Looking for solace but nobody came
And the world waits on notice
Cause the time is running out
And this plan will get you nowhere
By yourself
So break off the bough
You want it all but you don't know how
You're shakin' on an autumn tree
You take a little part of me
Wake up the town
Show them all just what you're about
You're shakin' on an autumn tree
You take a little part of me
No more chasing ever after all
So long wasted life
Now it's your call
So break off the bough

You're shakin' on an autumn tree
You take a little part of me
You take a little part of me <start> Well the woman I love she got a hook in her nose
Her eye brows meet she wears second hand clothes
She speaks with a stutter and walks with a hop
I don't know why I love her but I just can't stop.
You know I love her yeah I love her
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.
If I ever lose her I will go insane
I go half crazy when she calls my name
When she says 'baba baba baby I love you'
There ain't nothing in the world I wouldn't do.
You know I love her yeah I love her
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.
The woman that I love she got two flat feet
Her knees knock together walking down the street
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed
She ain't much to look at but like I said
You know I love her Yeah I love her
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.
I don't mean to say she got nothing going
She got a weird sense of humor that is all her own
When I got low she sets on my feet
Got a five inch smile but her breath is sweet.
You know I love her Yeah I love her
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world. <start> You got me now
You know so c'mon
and pass the message
I feel you now
You know it
so let's get past the wreckage
We go up we go down
we get better
So long so long so long
c'mon you know they're waiting for us outside
It's in the air and all I care about is you
Held in my hands you're all the drugs I need to do
I can't keep quiet feeling indiscreet
We may as well try it got me on my feet singin'
All alone don't leave me far behind
And wherever you go you know you're always on my mind
Let's start it over again
You got me now
You know so go on and pass the message
I feel you now
you know it
I don't need no second guesses
I can't keep quiet honestly
You got me dancing in the street
All alone don't leave me far behind
And wherever you go you know you're always on my mind
Let's start it over again
Even on top of the world we get better
Even if we get caught sometime
You know we're gonna find the way
This night is not over
I can't keep quiet honestly
You got me dancing in the street
All alone don't leave me far behind
And wherever you go you know you're always on my mind
All alone don't leave me far behind
And wherever you go you know you're always on my mind
Let's start it over again
This night is not over

 <start> I got a boss with a crew cut breathing down my neck
He says he's gonna teach me about the word Respect
And at the end of the day I'm barely alive
But ain't it amazin' the trail that I'm blazin'
When that whistle blows at five
Chorus
Tonight is mine
It's party time
When I'm off the clock
I'm ready to rock
And I'm a feeling fine
Gonna give myself a raise
And raise this bottle one more time
And I'll owe my soul tomorrow lord
But tonight is mine
I do an honest days work for an honest days pay
A forty hour week that's the american way
I know I'll never sit on the board of this company
But I never get bored sittin' at the bar
Hangin' with people like me
Chorus
Gonna give myself a raise
And raise this bottle one more time
And I'll owe my soul tomorrow lord
But tonight is mine
And I'll owe my soul tomorrow lord
But tonight is mine
I owe I owe
Off to work I go
But tonight is mine
I owe I owe
It's off to work I go
It's off to work I go
But tonight is mine <start> All winter long while I was locked in my room
Your face at the window and my hair on the floor
I was thinking of you
All winter long while I was locked in my room
Your face at the window and my hair on the floor
I was thinking of you
But the phone rang all night long
To tell me I was wrong
And I watched while the officer
Wrote all their ages down
Strange things happen
When you're not around
Our love is so strong
It moves objects in my house
Strange things happen
When you're not around
Those magical moments
Have found their way back home again
All winter long while I was locked in my room
Your face at the window and my hair on the floor
I was thinking of you
All winter long while I was locked in my room
Your face at the window
And that book of old spells
I was thinking of you
And all the spells we cast
Have lately come to pass
And the flowers in the garden have all fallen down
Strange things happen <start> Will you wait like I wait for you
Will you jump if I ask you to
Oh you fix me with an arctic glare
Making out and you just don't care
Will you wait like i wait for you
Table's set and there's tea for two
Oh you fix me with an arctic glare
Making out and you just don't care
Before you close the book on us
Before you close the book on us
Before you close the book on us
Before you close the book on us
Hey
Are you going out of town
Are you on a white horse to carry you around
Oh you fix me with an arctic glare
Making out and you just don't care
Before you close the book on us
Before you close the book on us
Before you close the book on us
Before you close the book on us

if your boyfriend listens
were building a relation
for the music shakes it
There's that song again
there's that song again
there's that song again
there's that song again...
how come I could not cheat
if you're a colorful lover
I don't mind being one of them
I don't mind my big deal
It's been thrown away again
it's been thrown away again
it's been thrown away again
it's been thrown away again... <start> Last summer in Italy during the festival tour
another band asked a Milanese journalist what I was like
uhh unbenounced to them a ear shot of my crew 
he says oh you know an angry white female
what a cop out what a lazy answer
strangely when I was around any of these press dudes
I was in a very good mood being a ham a comic what gives
No one who has not been in my bed
laming out with uhh premature ejaculation
or cheaters has ever seen me angry.
Ask my last fiance why I put a knife to his throat
that was anger. You people haven't seen it.
You think this is anger
This is mild annoyance and even if
I was angry right this very minute 
So what I should be and so should you.
Look around you the world is thurally fucked
seriously look around you.
A six foot tall anorexic bimbo with plastic breast
is making me feel weird about my own body.
What's up with that seriously
where not completely stupid are we
I know this sounds like some bitchy rant
but I really feel we got to address this
I believe in healthy mind healthy body
I believe in fitness and wholesome food
I believe in makeup for those who chose.
I understand essentially body shape is fashion and
trend of the era and trend of the region.
I understand Marilyn Monroe was size  dress and
no one can deny May Wess was full of sex appeal.
Back then the skinny gurls were kind of rackety
and not vilumptious enough
I mean logistically we know all this but
in are materialistic shallow modern day society 
weh well I I use to think
it was an intelligence quotient kinda thing
seriously or a maturity issue
Is it truly personal preference
Personal priority or is it a heard of cows thing
ya know like were all stupid
shallow conformists with a low enough IQ
to accept of being shown and
told the standard of beauty and blindly following.
There is a lack of individualism and spirituality
an a devote of Kristnia were mascara
Can a Buddhist stain their lips
It would not matter at all would it
What insecure egomaniacs we all are.
What is truly important in life
Health Happiness
Maybe not even happiness certainly not beauty.
And then on top of all of this
There is mainstream media
and the entertainment industry
ZOINKSI'M FUCKED <start> Instrumental <start> Logically appraise the situation
Sizing up the ones who'll do you good
Realize it's not merely position
That gets you to the top that's understood
You can't live with yourself
So live off someone else
You say you're one of us
But you're really one of them
So don't pretend social contender
This rule by ladders hazardous ascent
Your path is strewn with others who have bent
Ambition hides from view those who are falling
Convince yourself you'll not be like those crawling
Laughing in the face of their distress
Believing they're impressed with your success
You'll find out the street you travel narrows
Poisoned by the edge of social arrows <start> Music LaBriePaulyGuadagnoli
Lyrics CashPauly
Give me sundown till the light
Give me just one long night
Watch me work and slave away
I'll be done when you awake
Marvel at my bed of silk
Marvel at the one thing I can build
I will call this place a home
A trap for the drifter on the run
Deep in a corner where I wait
He will find me I'm his fate
I'll enjoy him day by day
Cause he'll never get away
I know you fear me
I know you fear me
Fear my home and fear my hands
Soon you'll feel me
Have reason to fear me
Scared 'cause you don't understand
Watch the dew that follows lines
Trickle through this web of mine
You see me can't comprehend
I'm a killer  a friend
You see me don't be afraid
Of this crystal I have made
It gives life to my own kind
And there'll be nothing left behind
I'm more than a witches pet
I am more than a beast
I know that I hide in shadows
But there's a little light in me
I know you fear me
I know you fear me
Fear my home and fear my hands
Soon you'll feel me
Have reason to fear me
Scared 'cause you don't understand
Build your own world
No regrets you have
And do what you have to do
For survival
Build your own world without regret
Do what you must to survive
Soon you'll kill me
Soon you'll kill me
Crush my home with you own hands
Soon you'll smear me
Why do you fear me
Cause I build the dreams you can't
I know you fear me
I know you fear me
Fear my home and fear my hands
Soon you'll feel me
Have reason to fear me
Scared 'cause you don't understand <start> when i look at the sky it all gets so heavy
and the reason why is an endless journey
and sometimes it just seems so far away
then i look in your eye and i find a place
it seems as vast as outer space
and i find myself with one thing left to say
that you are my only true star
shine with all your might
guide me through this lonely night
and i want whatever you want
and after all we've said and we've done
maybe i think it's time you came with me
sometimes when i wake up i feel so heavy
and getting off the floor can be such a journey
until i remember why we ran away
then i pretend to see your face
and i strike up interesting conversation
to steal your heart when you find me in your doorway
you are my only true star
shine with all your might
guide me through this lonely night
and i want whatever you want
and after all we've said and we've done
maybe i think it's time you came with me
... then i remember why we ran away
... then i remember why we ran away
... then i remember why we had to run
because you are my only true star
shine with all your might
guide me through this lonely night
and i want whatever you want
and after all we've said and we've done
maybe i think it's time you came with me <start> I came upon a butcher
he was slaughtering a lamb
I accused him there
with his tortured lamb.
He said Listen to me child
I am what I am
and you you are my only son.
Well I found a silver needle
I put it into my arm.
It did some good
did some harm.
But the nights were cold
and it almost kept me warm
how come the night is long
I saw some flowers growing up
where that lamb fell down
was I supposed to praise my Lord
make some kind of joyful sound
He said Listen listen to me now
I go round and round
and you you are my only child.
Do not leave me now
do not leave me now
I'm broken down
from a recent fall.
Blood upon my body
and ice upon my soul
lead on my son it is your world. <start> Ich sehe ein kleines Mdchen betteln

Keep her awake Give me a fright
I don't know what goes through her mind
When she takes drugs.
All of the lies she tells herself
Won't be believed by anybody else.
And I can't buy just what she sells
When she tells lies.
And she takes her pills And she tells her lies
And she breaks my heart and breaks her word
But I still act sur surprised.
Every kiss she gives away might be a good time
But you know the sad thing is the boys all say
She's something of a slut. <start> Baby I've never had a single thing in my life I could call my own.
There you were holding a love so true
Now I've got a home now I've got a home.
I found a love hidden in a backstreet
I found a love baby

Hidden away from the world baby

But darlin' Promise me one little thing That you won't let me down.

Keep it for the moments when we're apart
Kisses in the moonlight whispers with the dawn
Memories of this magic with your loving boy
On and on the weels are turning taking me away
But I'll be coming home again and on that day...
There'll be celebrations and for you and me
Time to have a dance around the Christmas tree
On and on the weels are turning taking me away
But I'll be coming home again and on that day...
There'll be celebrations and for you and me
Time to have a kiss behind the Christmas tree
When the dream is over hold it in your heart
Keep it for the moments when we're apart
Kisses in the moonlight whispers with the dawn
Memories of this magic with your loving boy
There'll be celebrations and for you and me
Time to have a dance around the Christmas tree

When your hope is lost
And you can't take it

To live someone else's life

If all you ever wanted
Was to let go yeah

Say those words on baited breath
I'd asked to go i'd asked to go
Obey the form choose it well
Cross the line to a personal hell
I'd asked to go I'd asked to go
To a man like me to a man like me
Words are far too kind
To a man like me to a man like me
There's something missing
I will stop at nothing
I will be loved or die trying
I've been waking up just to sleep again to sleep again
I will stop at nothing
I will be loved or die trying
I've been waking up just to sleep again to sleep again
Cry those tears and hide them well
Say those words on a sharpened breath
I'd asked to go I'd asked to go
Alll my friends don't care at all
After all these years they're dead and gone
I'd asked to go I'd asked to go
To men like us to men like us
Words are far too kind
To men like us to men like us
Ashes to ashes dust to dust

A love that explodes
Convulsing your body
Your only hand extending in the deep
Try then walking away on a bridge to nowhere
To nowhere to no one
Try to explain why you've changed
I don't think I'll understand
A love that explodes
Convulsing your body
Your only hand extending under the

Ang lahat ay masaya
Umiikot ang mundo
At hindi humihinto
Ang lahat ng makita mo ay bago
At ngayon may edad ka na
At lunod sa problema
Nangangarap na ibalik ang kahapon
Hindi mo malaman kung bakit
Kailangang magbago ang lahat
Magbago ang lahat
Magbago ang lahat sa buhay mo
Umaaraw umuulan
Noon pa ma'y sadyang ganyan
At kung ngayon lahat ng panaginip
Mo'y biglang naglaho
Parepareho lamang tayo
Isipin mo walang nagbago
Kung ano tayo noon
Ay ganoon pa rin ngayon
Umiikot ang mundo at hindi humihinto
Ngunit ang kalagayan mo ay hindi nagbabago
hindi nagbabago
hindi nagbabago
Walang nagbago  <start> Oh the avenging angel
Shiver in the way of her stare
I will admit that she never loved me
But I admit that I didn't care
And it's too damned late to buy the gate
And why close it if your heart isn't there
And since you know it all
I could give you a call
I could give you something fine to compare yourself to
My eyes begin to ache in the cold electric light
There are no windows in this room
In which we've been sitting all our lives
Some incredible distance
Some incredible place
Sometimes I think sometimes I sink
In some incredible race
And it's too damned soon for a man of fortune
To have to run or lose his face
And since you know it all
I could give you a call
I could give you a lot more than a taste of yourself too <start> DOWN
Bought down again
Kicking and screaming
Bought down again
Lying and scheming
Love is a demon
Waiting to call
Love is a demon
One for us all
Bought down again
Kicking and screaming
Bought down again
Lying and scheming
Love can be fatal
Tears at the heart
Love can be fatal
And rip us apart
Bought down again
Kicking and screaming
Bought down again
Lying and scheming
Love has no mercy
And we have no say
Love has no mercy
We are it's prey
Bought down again
Kicking and screaming
Bought down again
Lying and scheming <start> Well you think you've got it bad
And you think that you've been had
Well you never were so wrong
If you just listen to this song
Your debts will all be doubled
Iffin' you all be so troubled
You never gonna help your brother
If you can't help yourself
 Get down your line
Get down your line
Get down your line
Get down your line
And you'll be just fine
Get down your line
And don't waste no time
Then you can give everyday that you live
Well get yourself together
Don't ever mind the weather
Then you can help your neighbour
And help him with his labor
If you get yourself together
Then giving is so much pleasure
It makes your life a treasure
If you can do someone some good
Get down your line
Get down your line
Get down your line
Get down your line
And you'll be just fine
Get down your line
And don't waste no time
Then you can give everyday that you live <start> Would you like a woman who's been around the world
Would you like a woman who is like a little girl
Would you like a woman who is strong and tough
Would you like a woman who could never ever get enough
Would you like it on a yacht
Would you like it on the dock
Would you like it in a plane
Would you like it on a train
Do you like it
Do you like it like that
Does it make you hot baby
Is it givin' you a heart attack
Do you like it like it
Would you like a woman who is just a little mean
Would you like a woman who is just a little naive
Would you like a woman who is sensitive to your touch
Would you like a woman who wants to tie you up
Would you like it in a car
Would you like it in a bar
Would you like it on the street
Would you like it on your feet
Do you like it
Do you like it like that
Does it make you hot baby
Is it givin' you a heart attack
Do you like it like it
Would you like a woman who is like a work of art
Would you like a woman who is gonna break your heart
Would you like a woman sweet and shy and plain
Would you like a woman you could never tame
Would you like it in your bed
Would you like it in your head
Would you like it in on the phone
You must cause you're all alone
Do you like it
Do you like it like that
Does it make you hot baby
Is it givin' you a heart attack
Do you like it like it <start> Goodbye dreamer insane stranger on the shore
There is no one left here not a soul
Aid the confusion expecting nothing
Not a soul
O Mother could I come back to you
A terrible vision of order out of control
In accordance with human history
Here in the company of death
We approach  new graves divided for love's sake
Refined in rapture  ready to fly or to die
Mother could I come back to you
I'm lifted up into the presence of divine forces
Mother
Openmouthed in magnificence and beauty
Mother
Or shall we sufer the same fate as all the others
Stuck on a plane which does not suit them
Lost in thought forgetful of primitive desire
Goodbye dreamer not a soul
Mother could I come back to you
Mother could I come back through you
Mother could I come back to you
The animals  I know how you make out
Welling with authority vilely enthusiastic enduring bitterness <start> You've come up in the world
And it's all to your credit
You made something of your life
Like you always said you would
But whatever happened to the girl I used to know
And all those halcyon days of love
You've come up in the world
And it's such a shame
You made a success of a dream
But it seems so empty now
With your weak excuses and
Your condescending ways
And all to frequent nights alone
I've come down in the world
And it's all to your credit
You made something of my life
But you've thrown it all away
For your books and your fancy talk
Your newfound friends and all
Your theories on mankind and society <start> Up in the mornin' out on the job work like the devil for my pay
But that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day
Fuss with my woman toil for my kids
Sweat 'til I'm wrinkled and gray
While that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day
Good Lawd above can't you know I'm pinin'
Tears all in my eyes
Send down that cloud with a silver linin'
Lift me to paradise
Show me that river
Take me across and wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun give me nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day
Up in the mornin' out on the job
Work like the devil for my pay
But that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day
Fuss with my woman toil for my kids
Sweat 'til I'm wrinkled and gray
While that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day
Good Lawd above can't you know I'm pinin'
Tears all in my eyes
Send down that cloud with a silver linin'
Lift me to paradise
Show me that river
Take me across and wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun give me nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day <start> I've got this feeling
Running through my side
I've got this feeling
That you don't like my kind
Slow down
Keep it down
I'm trying to make some noise here
And I know you you've found love
But baby that's no way to show it
Come in take a look inside
'Cause I know
You're gonna like this kind
I said slow down
Keep it down
I'm trying to be an original
And I know you you've found love
But baby that's no way to show it
This is what you wanted to hear 
Come in come in come in
I've been waiting for you
Just take a look inside
See what I can do
I said you might not think that
This is for you
But you're never quite sure 'til you try
And I know you you've found love
But darlin' I don't care
'Cause this is what you wanted to hear
This is what you wanted to hear
This is what you wanted to hear
Ooh this is what you wanted to hear
Ooh this is what you wanted to hear
Ooh this is what you wanted to hear
Ooh this is what you wanted to hear
I said I'm telling you now yes
I'm telling you now
I'm telling you now
I'm telling you now <start> just another way to keep people docile
by feeding them abstract rewards depending on who is in power
by twisting and changing the bileball to mean whatever they decide
the oldest tool of oppression to play on people's conscience
obey the rule accept the horror in return for the afterlife
suffer now obey now or the debt will be payed for eternity
god's socalled word is nothing more than a lie
it is the voice of government speaking to ignorance
as the church influence grows our freedom falls away
by enslaving our minds to the infamous lie there is no hope for
resistance
wills are succumb to the powers above
and conned by the blatant stupidity of a god
smash the churches ignore the word of god
then the road to freedom will begin <start> These days I'm getting older
Before my time
To say I'm getting stronger
Would be a lie
I think you're trying to break me
Seems so unreal
Don't know how to take me
Don't know how I feel
Look around you
Do you see what I see
Other people think you try to
Make a fool of me
It seems to take so long
Till anything gets done
Why do I have to lose to get things
I've never won
I'm defeated again
I see the look on your face
I've got that feeling again
My mouth has a bad taste
My hope in empty promise
Put me to shame
I know its what you wanted
I need the pain
I was gonna be someone
You held me down
Didn't want me to move on
You let me drown <start> Here we go boom boom boom again
I'm caught in my mind somebody's
telling me I'm already dead dead to
my flesh or dead to the spirit if I
were alive then you'd think that
I'd hear it G. It's in his trickery the lie
that he spreads full term in my head
bringing me down making me boy
to this place that I dread.
Cause everytime I look in the mirror
I see the reflection of the one that
I fear turn my back on the love of my
life here I stand now just me and
my pride.
Somebody getting thru  u Better
be thinking twice boy
I try to breathe caught down ripped
asunder feeling the weight that I've
brought from this underworld place
grown cold tear my flesh bring obedience
see this boy I hope that you're getting this... <start> Love  Anouk
It's funny how I blind myself
So I don't have to see
You're taking me down
And bringing me to my knees
Letting me know I'm alone
I'm not afraid to die no more
The house above yeah
Oh heaven won't you pick me up now
Love
All I needed was love
Someone give me some lovin'
I guess it's only meant for some of us
Oh oh yeah oh yeah yeah
Life has made me lose my mind
I'm not doin' allright these days
Lying naked on my kitchenfloor
So cold....well I
I thougt I had a lion's heart
I guess I was wrong
I feel so damn lonely
Yeah yeah
Love
All I needed was some lovin'
Could someone give me some sweet lovin'
'Cause this is more than I can bare
My nights are getting darker as time goes by
How I tried to keep these walls from falling down
Won't we are another
They shut me down
They shut me down
Love
All I needed was some love lord
Could someone give me some sweet love
Some sweet love yeah
I guess it's only meant for some of us
Oh oh yeah oh oh yeah yeah love
Give me love though
Give me love lord
Love love love love love love love
Why why won't you give me some sweet loving
Oh baby oh maybe all right all right yeah
Love
I guess it's only meant for some
Oh yeah yeah yeah
I guess it's only meant for some of us <start> Spending nights trying to find out why kids are dying
Some are cutting themselves
While others rely on pills
Which leads to finding your father's gun
And saying this life's not worth living
We need to learn to defend depression
With our friends before they fade out <start> Dnmekten yorgun
Aklm bir tek sende kald
Hayalimde grdm

Bu yzden hibir ey
nemli deil senin kadar
Benim yaptm senin yapabilceindi
Senin yaptn benim yapabilceimdi

Kopmaz bir btndk
Birlikte doldu tm boluklar
Birimizdeki kilit
brnde aan anahtard
Bu yzden hibir ey
Ayrmazd seni benden <start> She smiled in a big way the way a girl like that smiles
When the world is hers and she held your eyes
Out in the breezeway down by the shore in the lazy summer
And she pulled you in and she bit your lip and she made you hers
She looked deep into you as you lay together quiet in the grasp of dusk and summer
But you've already lost
But you've already lost
But you've already lost
When you only had barely enough to hang on
And she combed your hair and she kissed your teeth
And she made you better than you'd been before
She told you bad things you wished you could change in the lazy summer
And she told you laughing down to her core so she would not cry as she lay in your lap
She said Nobody here can live forever quiet in the grasp of dusk and summer
But you've already lost
But you've already lost
But you've already lost
When you only had barely enough to hang on
She said No one is alone the way you are alone
And you held her looser than you would have if you ever could have known
Some things tie your life together slender threads and things to treasure
Days like that should last and last and last
But you've already lost
But you've already lost
But you've already lost
When you only had barely enough to hang on
Hang on
Hang on
Hang on <start> I'm gonna tell you a story
I'm gonna tell you about my town
I'm gonna tell you a big bad story baby
Aww it's all about my town
Yeah down by the river
Down by the banks of the river Charles 
That's where you'll find me
Along with fuggers lovers and thieves 
Well I love that dirty water
Oh Boston you're my home 
Frustrated women 
Have to be in by twelve o'clock 
But I'm ahopin' and awishin' oh
That just once those doors weren't locked 
Well I love that dirty water
Oh Boston you're my home 
Because I love that dirty water
Oh oh Boston you're my home 
Well I love that dirty water 
I love that dirty water 
I love that dirty water 
I love that dirty water 
I love that dirty water 
I love that dirty water  <start> Tried to make it alone
Didn't get me too much
You can cover your past
Not forgotten at last
Everything that you feel is mine
And the field still holds your sway
I see you in the pouring wine
When the darkness gets pulled away
You make me feel like I'm real
You make it summer all the time
You make me feel like I'm real
You make the raindrops shine like dimes
You make me feel like I'm real
You make it summer you make it good
Well it goes to show that you never know
I can take you to task
But you don't want me to ask
Time will stop like a click
But we're both gonna go
If in time you are flying high
Over fields where we would play
I'd be the colors in your kite
And the strings that hold you safe
And in time we are flying high
As we dance in the headlights laughing
Tears are all spilled behind us
And the bad days have blown away <start> We live just for today
Now is not yesterday
Tomorrow's another day in live.
I heard that growth is slow
That's not the way it goes
Variety's the spice of life.
My life
We're not the same growing came
Who can explain why we change
The wheel in motion now
Prepare for ups and downs
Sunshine and dark and cloudy skies.
Those things we want to say
Allways seem to fade away
This pain is what we recognize.
In time
We're not the same growing came
Try to maintain even plain.
There's a rhyme for every reason
A time for every season
To grow in our lives it's just natural.
Move with the transition constantly in motion
Modify the model feel the physical mutation.
The body grows along with the mind
Compel the soul with cycles and lines.
Sensation pain you feel in your brain
Reduce the strain embrace the gain. <start> Born in a faroff land
A nation of heat and sand
A father who ruled by force
A mother who said of course
A nation of fearful men
And women afraid of them
But learning the family trade
My interest began to fade
I'm a dictator's son
Born with a silver gun
In a country that's half insane
In a country that's banned the rain
He kept his eye on me
Knew I had plans to flee
Strangely today it rained
I hopped a midnight plane
Fasten your seatbelts
We soon will land
At LAX hope to see you again
Fasten your seatbelts
We soon will land
At LAX hope to see you again
Fasten your seatbelts
We soon will land
At LAX hope to see you again
Somewhat reluctantly
I tell her sit down with me
We order drinks and wait
Small talk it's getting late
One thing you ought to know
Before we up and go
Hope it don't spoil the fun
But I'm a dictator's son
I'm into sixties soul
Nat King Cole
Harris Tweed
Bundesliga
I'm into wings and dip
Girls who strip
Diesel icks
Party Mix
I'm into Hugo Boss
Dental floss
Party cruise
Jordan shoes
I'm into Instagram
Bands who jam
Coed knees
BLT's
This is how we roll a dictator's son
This is how we roll a dictator's son
This is how we roll a dictator's son
This is how we roll a dictator's son
Someday I'll return with a rebel force
Overturn my father and change the course
Of history for all of my countrymen
But I cannot tell you exactly when
'Cause this is how we roll a dictator's son
This is how we roll a dictator's son
This is how we roll a dictator's son
This is how we roll a dictator's son
Someday I'll return with a rebel force
Overturn my father and change the course
Of history for all of my countrymen
But I cannot tell you exactly when
I'm a dictator's son
I'm a dictator's son <start> You're my love
You're my angel
You're the girl of my dreams
And I'd like to thank you
For waiting patiently
Daddy's home your Daddy's home to stay
How I've waited for this moment
To be by your side
Your best friend wrote and told me
You had tear drops in you eyes
Daddy's home your Daddy's home to stay
It wasn't on a Sunday

It wasn't on a Tuesday afternoon

But I made a promise
That you treasure
And I made it back home to you
How I've waited for this moment
To be by your side
Your best friend wrote and told me
You had tear drops in your eyes
Daddy's home your Daddy's home to stay
Daddy's home to stay
I'm not a thousand miles away.
Daddy's home to stay
And I'm gonna be here come with me
Daddy's home to stay 
I'm not a thousand miles away.
Daddy's home to stay
And I'm gonna be here come with me <start> With eyes that hide the man within
You see behind the eyes of other men
You've lived and died and come to life again
And now you standin' alone at the crossroads of your mind
You've left your yesterdays behind
But which road leads you to tomorrow
Charro
You've turned your back on yesterday
Betrayed a man who swore he'd make you pay
For when you left you took his pride away
You know he'll never let you break away so easily
You'll have to fight before you're free
But how much more time can you borrow
Charro
Now in a single moment your past grows dim
One thought goes racing across your mind
You ride to meet the woman you stole from him
Oh no Charro don't go
Charro don't go
There's something hanging in the wind
Your past is catching up and closing in
You've been halfway to hell and back again
And now you laugh in the devil's face with your last breath
You'll run a race with life and death
But will you live to see tomorrow
Charro <start> I don't wanna make you come clean
Lay out your life in front
In front of me
Like the stars that shine through your fingers
A simple word
Is all that I need
And i
Won't need to hurt no more
You were all you could have been
It's bad you blamed yourself
Worse I agreed
We got this far by lying like winners
With simple words
That had to be real
Now hush
Don't you make a sound
I'm a believer now
And i
Don't wanna make the same mistakes
I know everything you do comes back
And i
Know it's not over yet <start> Hey What can I say
Something's on my mind like every other day
Hey You slow down I can see you're headed for a breakdown
Go Go Take another pill and a real big swig to forget about me
Don't you know by now you're under my skin like six feet under ground..
Hey yeah oh yeah Let's go the Next Big Joyride x
Now I'm half asleep now I'm awake
Thought it was a daydream
I'm so horrified 'cause now you see the real me deep inside
Then I say it's black she says it's white
I say it's day she says alright
It's time to run it's time to hide get ready for the next big joyride
Hey yeah Oh yeah let's go the next big Joyride x <start> She cried to the Southern wind
About a love that was sure to end
Every dream in her heart was gone
Heading for a showdown.
Bad dreamer what's your name
Looks like we're riding on the same train
Looks as though there'll be more pain
There's gonna be a showdown.
And it's raining all over the world
Raining all over the world
Tonight the longest night.
She came to me like a friend
She blew in on the Southern wind
Now my heart is turned to stone again
There's gonna be a showdown.
Save me oh save me
It's unreal the suffering
There's gonna be a showdown.
And it's raining all over the world
Raining all over the world
Tonight the longest night.

Raining all over the world
Raining all over the world
The longest night.
And it's raining all over the world
Raining all over the world
Tonight the longest night.
You gotta save me girl
Well I'm ready for saving
I'm a fool for you
Ya know I'm ready come on and save me
Can't you feel what you're doing to me now
I'm on the run again.
Gotta save me <start> A second a minute an hour a day and its gone
Little by little it fritters away try as you may you can never replace it
A moment of beauty you stumble upon
As long as you treasure whatever it is whatever it is could never be wasted
So if we all turn to dust
Better to've loved and lost
Cos everything has a cost
So if you're gonna spend time
Spend it upon me
Spend it up on me
Just give me your time
I don't want your money
I'd crawl then I'd walk then I'd run but then I'd stumble and fall
Somewhere between the love and the lust
I tried my best I was maladjusted
And I'm not saying that I know it all
Maybe I'm a little more selfaware
Still get scared but I've learned to trust it
So when it comes to us
I've weighed up all the odds
I bet that this is love
So if you're gonna spend time
Spend it upon me
Spend it up on me
Just give me your time
Don't take it from me
I know hard it is
Getting it right
At a time like this
So you'd better believe
Believe
How right it could be
So if you're gonna spend time
Spend it upon me
Spend it up on me
Just give me your time
I don't want your money <start> Intro  Instrumental <start> Just take it back take it back
You were wrong
You always took from me
You always lied to me
while I tried to fake a smile
Is the only way
That you know how to play
Watch me prove you wrong
You're always telling me to bite my tongue
You were wrong you blamed me
Just take it back take it back
I was blind whoa you were wrong
You blamed me
Just take it back take it back
I was blind you were wrong
You always took away
Never giving anything
So I lied
But trust me I'm alright
I tried to find my way
I tried to find my place
It's so hard 
Cause you've poisoned my mind
You're always telling me to bite my tongue
You were wrong you blame me
Just take it back take it back
I was blind whoa you were wrong
You blame me
Just take it back take it back
I was blind and you were wrong
I finally have a taste
Of what it's like to take away
You're done for watch it slip away
That thing you try to hide
Will eat you up kill your insides
You're fading you've lost your way
You were wrong you blame me
Just take it back take it back
I was blind whoa you were wrong
You blamed me
Just take it back take it back
I was blind and you were wrong
You blame me
Just take it back take it back
I was blind whoa you were wrong
You were wrong you blamed me
Just take it back take it back
I was blind you were wrong
You were wrong you were wrong <start> Crippled by this raw desire
I keep on reaching high and higher
And now the stars replaced the sun
And there's a woman's face
In each and everyone
And it's so blinding
A little goes a long way
A lot of it a long way further
A little goes a long way
A lot of it a long way further
At first it Just affects your skin
But then it takes you over from within
It shines out through your eyes
It starts to Shine out past the drought
Inside of your mouth
And it's all so blinding
A little goes a long way
A lot of it a long way further
A little goes a long way
A lot of it a long way further
So i'm not going home Babe
oh Why should I
A little goes a long way
A lot of it a long way further
A little goes a long way
A lot of it a long way further <start> She lives on Pony Street
And they should scatter flowers at her feet
But when they come calling I think it's appalling
They're sober and they're polite
They're deeply respectful when I would expect them
To keep her out all night
That little martinet
Will get her own way yet
If you need instruction in mindless destruction
I'll show you a thing or two
You used to adore me but now my life flashes before me
For you to view
Oh mother oh mother sometimes you are so mortifying
From the hole in your leopard skin tights I can tell you've been spying
But your generation confesses before it transgresses
Those Super movies of daddy in your disco dresses
If you're going out tonight
I won't wait up
Reading Das Kapital
Watching Home Shopping Club
While you're flogging a dead horse
All the way down Pony Street
Where you live after a fashion
All the way down Pony Street
The life and the soul of every indiscretion
That lives on that lives on that lives on
Pony Street
Daughter oh daughter you know I will love you forever
But spare me the white ankle socks with the lace and the leather
For you and your cartoon threat do no good to resist me
For I am the genuine thing but for you it's just history <start> I can see it in your eyes now
You have come to resent me
Condescension in the silence
Your fingers are tired girl
How they falter against my thigh
Your kisses are pining for the lips of someone else
Your visits getting shorter
Your heart is getting further from me
Your touch is getting colder
Always somewhere you need to be
Boys on your left side boys on your right
Boys in your maths class who'll do anything you ask
You're pulling the trigger and the gun is in my mouth
A subtle annoyance laced with disgust
When you get older and those boys grow tired of you
You can come find me I can never hate you
Boys on your left side boys on your right
Boys by your locker who'll do anything you ask <start> I found my love in the gas light glow
Dreamed a dream by the old canal
Kissed my girl by the factory wall
Dirty old town
Dirty old town
Clouds are drifting across the moon
Cats are prowling along their beat
Spring's a girl in the street at night
Dirty old town
Dirty old town
I heard a siren from the docks
Saw a train set the night on fire
Smelled the Spring on the smokey wind
Dirty old town
Dirty old town
I'm gonna take me a good sharp axe
Shining steel tempered in the fire
We'll chop you down like an old dead tree
Dirty old town
Dirty old town <start> You've got a broken heart that just won't fix
You can't stop crying 'cause you miss your miss
Get her out of your head
Find someone new instead and feel alright
Just look at me man I was just like you
I loved a girl but then we were through
Everytime you commit You only gonna split and say goodbye

So are you in or are you out 
Huckle up baby
To the sound of love
You're quick to fall in love and then you fall out
You say forever but I give you about a month at the most
you always get bored and leave her to dry
You'll find true love with a woman not a girl
You'll know it's her when she becomes your world
when you're together you won't notice time will just fly by
Can you hear that sound 
That's the sound of love

And everytime you see her she'll get a little hotter 
Beautiful girl hve your time
Just relax and wait a while
Ooh I caught you looking let's start the cooking
You know what I'm saying 
Can you hear that sound 
That's the sound of love

Now where the pretty girls at
'Cause I'm the man with the black hat
This is the sound of love <start> Yo te imagino dormido si vuelvo a casa muy tarde
Lo cierto es que no me acostumbro a dormir al lado de nadie
Cerrar los ojos y abandonarse
No pongas un precio que no puedes pagar
No quiero marchantes de arte
No estuve en el casting de estrellas de rock
No soy marioneta en este baile
Sentirse sola sentirse aparte
Prefiero vivir a mi manera
Eso no hace dao a nadie
Solo quiero que me entiendan
Djame vivir a mi manera
Necesito que me creas
Necesito confiar en alguien
Yo te imagino dormido si vuelvo a mi casa muy tarde
Lo cierto es que no me acostumbro a dormir al lado de nadie
Siempre me voy siempre a ninguna parte
Mi vida es un vuelo sin motor
Aun asi quiero vivir a mi manera
Eso no hace dao a nadie
Pero quiero que me entiendan
Djame vivir a mi manera
Necesito que me creas
Necesito confiar en alguien
Necesito confiar en alguien
Siempre me voy siempre a ninguna parte
Mi vida es un vuelo sin motor
Aun asi quiero vivir a mi manera
Eso no hace dao a nadie
Solo quiero que me entiendas
Djame vivir
Djame vivir
Djame vivir a mi manera
Djame vivir
Djame vivir
Djame vivir a mi manera <start> All the small things
True care truth brings
I'll take one lift
Your ride best trip
Always I know
You'll be at my show
Watching waiting commiserating
Say it ain't so I will not go
Turn the lights off carry me home
Na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na
Late night come home
Work sucks I know
She left me roses by the stairs
Surprises let me know she cares
Say it ain't so I will not go
Turn the lights off carry me home
Na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na
Say it ain't so I will not go
Turn the lights off carry me home
Keep your head still I'll be your thrill
The night will go on my little windmill
Say it ain't so I will not go
Turn the lights off carry me home
Keep your head still I'll be your thrill
The night will go on
The night will go on
My little windmill <start> I've been tearing at this gauze over my eyes
and clanging cymbals till I couldn't hear
your screaming anymore.
I used to speak in the tongues of angels
all I ever say now is goodbye.
And I'll set myself on fire as a beacon
through the shadow that my life has been
but I would only smolder
because I would not burn for anyone
when I had the chance.
I used to speak in the tongues of angels
all I ever say now is goodbye. <start> Verse 
Love can be like the pouring rain.
Love can be the sweetest flower.
You can turn love into just about anything.
But if you give it all that you are
Love will change everything.
Chorus
Love can be paradise
When it's real there is no disguise.
Love I see paradise
Every time I look in your eyes.
Verse 
Love can be like a hurricane.
Love can be a gentle breeze.
You can hide love from just about everyone.
But if you give it all that you have
Love will change everything.
Repeat Chorus
Bridge
And don't be fooled
By what others say and do...
Repeat Chorus

Every time I look in
Every time I look in your eyes.  <start> The credits roll the camera pans
And in the mist our hero stands
He starts to speak then folds his hands in prayer.
An awkward pause then What's my line
There's nothing left to say this time 
And what do you say to a bad guy who's not there
In terms of Roman numerals he's IV league with Roman Polanski
He'd win an Oscar every time if he was only given a chance.
He started on the Broadway stage
The product of another age
An offer and a pilot drew him west.
The series bombed commercials came
And though nobody knew his name
They all recognized the potential he possessed.
Deodorants and dental floss
And how much does that new car cost
His acting was methodical in
You Don't Need A Medical.
He's branded like a racing car
He's like a movie star without movies.
The week of Independence Day
The casting agent called to say 
Your smile could save the movie and the world.
Buy buy buy buy
Sell sell sell.
How well you learn to
Not discern who's
Foe and who is friend
We'll own them all in the end.
It goes like this we have no choice.
The minarets the wailing voice
And vaguely Celtic music fills the air.
We choose a foreigner to hate
The new Iraq gets more irate
We really know nothing about them
And no one cares.
Aladdin and the forty thieves
Enhanced by brand new special effects.
Saddam and his cow disease
Spiced up with some gratuitous sex.
A movie's made a war is won
A low speed chase a smoking gun
Distract us while the actor takes the stand.
Buy buy buy buy
Sell sell sell.
How well you learn to
Not discern who's
Foe and who is friend
We'll own them all in the end. <start> What kind of song
I think I can hear a lily white lily calling
she seems to yearn to darken skin and hell
I really know without her force you would be fallen
you wouldn't need to praise mice in hell

This day be gray so take my advice and wait for the dawning
wait for the rise of light tomorrow morning
Look for the highest place in space to rest and stay
you've got to chase the hourly rising sun next day <start> I know this is not what you want to hear
we've built this place together all of these years
if you're filled with confusion we've done nothing wrong
looking at the pieces I realized that we didn't have them all
When we began my mind was young and the sun warmed my touch but it blinded my sight
back then I knew we started to build our home through the summer underestimating the winters night
We kept on We kept on We kept kept on building
I felt like we were too far in too far in too far in to stop
Now we need to salvage what we can
I saw our home approaching cold
walls and a roof that couldn't hold
although our fire provided warmth
the flame and foundations would not stay through the storms
we'll lift and take everything we laid
build with it you'll be glad that we didn't stay
create a home warmer than one we could have made
all the pain that you're feeling resides within me
if I appear unaffected know I'm not empty
as you search for comfort I hope you will see
the guilt that wrestles inside barely lets me breathe
and I can hardly speak about you <start> You know you know you are
Be still and know you are
Your life is meant for joy
It's all so deep within oh
Your life is beautiful
A seed becomes a tree
A mountain into a sky
This life is meant to be oh
Now is the time life begins
Take that simple path
And love will set you free
Live in harmony
And love will set you free oh
You know you know you are
Be still and know you are
You know you know you are
Be still and know you are <start> You can dub me stupid
and you can tag me dumb
but when our tear soaked eyes were washed away
the truth was still as thick as it comes.
How can I be proud of a country
that trades democracy in for a fence
and six thousand cops our nation's finest
rob me of the little freedom I thought I had left.
You can believe what the headlines read
and every corporate funded news anchors you see on TV.
But the fact still remains I was there that day
to witness so many people simply wanting a say.
After all their royal treatment and pepper spray
stripped a piece off my pay.
What are we fighting for you ask.
We were fighting for you.
Armed with nothing but the idea
of putting people before profit and business
the interest of the rich elite. <start> Tell me how did you get so cynical and suspicious minded
If you look for something wrong long enough I'm sure you'll find it
Save your psychic selfdefense
'Cause I don't care what you're against
What are you for
I want to know why don't you tell me so
What are you for
Quit giving me negative what makes you want to live
They shoved shit down your throat and told you that
It smells like roses
But it was just too hard to swallow then you got
Halitosis
Save your evil save your breath
'Cause I don't care what you're against
What are you for
I want to know why don't you tell me so
What are you for
Quit giving me negative what makes you want to live
You're tired of being pushed around
Want to tear the system down
Hey bro  let's go
Just quit your bitchin' about the situation
It's not that tough and it's not enough to point your finger
And I don't know why you should listen to me 'cause I'm just a singer
Your open mouth don't make you tough
I see you and I'll call your bluff
What are you for
I want to know why don't you tell me so
What are you for
Quit giving me negative what makes you want to live
What are you for
What are you for <start> This shining city built of gold a far cry from innocence
There's more than meets the eye round here look to the waters of the deep
A city of evil
There sat a sevenheaded beast ten horns raised from his head
Symbolic woman sits on his throne but hatred strips her and leaves her naked
The Beast and the Harlot
She's a dwelling place for demons she's a cage for every unclean spirit every filthy bird
And makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicate with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the Great
The city dressed in jewels and gold fine linen Myrrh and pearls
Her plagues will come all at once as her mourners watch her burn
Destroyed in an hour
Merchants and captains of the world sailors navigators too
Will weep and mourn this loss with her sins piled to the sky
The Beast and the Harlot
The day has come for all us sinners
If your not a servant you'll be struck to the ground.
Flee the burning greedy city looking back on her to see there's nothin' around.
I don't believe in fairy tales
And no one wants to go to Hell
But you made the wrong decision
And it's easy to see.
Now if you want to serve above or be a king below with us
You're welcome to the city where your future is set forever <start> Rope off another section of the city for the upper class then make another slum 
a place to throw your human trash.
Separate the blacks and whites the rich from the poor.
Create the crime epidemic then sell people locks for their doors.
So no more stabbing each other in the back
stand together and take your city back take to the streets.
We have the numbers unity is all we lack
work together and take the city back
that they infiltrated segregated and took all that we had
Turned communities into battle zones and then built skyscrapers like giant tombstones.
Turned communities into battle zones and then built skyscrapers like giant tombstones
Well I think we've had enough of that so stand together and take it all back.
Take to the streets and take your city back
We have got to learn to recognize the real enemy
because when the poor fight one another over color what is achieved
When we divide they conquer and up goes another condoplex
and unless we stop them now there won't be nothing left .
So no more stabbing each other in the back stand together and take your city back
take to the streets. We have the numbers
unity is all we lack work together and take the city back
that they infiltrated gentrified. But this time we fight back <start> You are here and warm
But I could look away and you'd be gone
Cause we live in a time
When meaning falls in splinters from our lives
And that's why I've traveled far
Cause I come so together where you are
Chorus
And all of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you
 joys and a will to be merry
And all of the things that we say are very
Sentimental gentle wind
Blowing through my life again
Sentimental Lady
Gentle one
Now you are here today
But easily you might just go away
Cause we live in a time
When paintings have no color words don't rhyme
And that's why I've traveled far
Cause I come so together where you are
Chorus
And all of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you
 joys and a will to be merry
And all of the things that we say are very
Sentimental gentle wind
Blowing through my life again
Sentimental Lady
Gentle one
You are here and warm
But I could look away and you'd be gone
Cause we live in a time
When meaning falls in splinters from our lives
And that's why I've traveled far
Cause I come so together where you are
Chorus
Yes and all of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you
 joys and a will to be merry
And all of the things that we say are very
Sentimental gentle wind
Blowing through my life again
Sentimental Lady

I was born in '
in a family of four.
Father had his own band
just after the war.
My brother and I had a radio
and every night we'd share
waves from Luxembourg
that came though the air.
Days were full of music
and nights were just the same.
And though the songs are different now
some things never change... <start> As I glance once upon the foam
Forty feet beneath my feet
The coldest calm falls
Through the molten veins
Cooling all the blood to slush
That congeals around the brain
La la la
Forty feet remain
Salt scales upon my drying arms
Burn my back beneath the sun
But I am cold beneath the burning haze
Looking down looking down
Down down again
La la la
Forty feet remain <start> A rhapsody
Contestants in disguise
A nation of desire
But who will win the prize
The people stand united
Reluctantly aligned
Copying and lying
Are the favorite pasttime
You've got a chance
To confront the world today
Desperate romance
Is the curse of castaways
What good is skill
If you don't make it to the dance
Despite circumstance
You've got a chance
Common life depicted on afternoon TV
Is spiked to give the
Miserable a vogue identity
Hate your neighbors
Cheat your friends
They don't discriminate
Popularity and fame don't care
If you're a reprobate
I'm tired of all this
Shakespearean misinformation
I want to win the game
You've got the right intentions
But who's got time to think
You've got a noon appointment
You've got to hit the links
You're talking in the stratosphere
You're curled up on the floor
With such a wealth of information
Why are you so poor
You've got a chance
To be relevant today
Desperate romance
Is the curse of castaways
What good is skill
If you don't make it to the dance

Despite circumstance
You've got a chance <start> Well it took you seven years to learn my name
And I know it's all the drugs and booze that I took lame

All the drugs all the fools and all the

What a shame
What would it take for me to be your man

Well all the filthy old Mary's and their Chinese dogs
So is a no go oh if you know what I know what

A million common people want to tear your head off
Just to show your bones to the night
Cause the night is when I'm satisfied
Woah oh oh

What would it take to make you understand
What would it take to make you understand
It can't be us cause the worlds gone cold

Well what would it take to make you understand

You was givin' it all to Jesus
How you'd been in the bondage of sin
And then you was ready to cut loose
When you said you wanted to be free
They took you seriously

Angels are watchin' you overtime
They can't understand why a child of the king
Would be happier livin' with swine

To save your life from ruin

Less than twenty minutes later when
I'm catching dirty looks
From the ones who won't admit when they're wrong
Scaring all the girl just by repeating the name of the song
You think you're getting off easy
But you're barely getting along
Playing harder to get
Time to wish you with the time
With the light of your life
The more you try to make a stand the longer you're gonna sit
Too fulling commiting for a full go
Too fulling commiting for a fool

Are you open to suggestion
My educated guess is
No answer
Got to circle yes or
Knowing that i'm right
When you left where you don't want to be
Wasting time blaming
Not admitting that you started the scene
You're not getting off easy
But you're barely getting along
Playing harder to get
Still pretending that you're ending what should've never began
Trying hard to prove me wrong but i ain't seen nothing yet

El patio de mi casa est lleno de tios
unos son malincuentes y otros asesinos.
Eih colega hacemos una banda

quiero ser carnicero con nuestros carceleros.
Ya llega el olor meto la cabeza

Me gustara sonreir
pero no tengo tantas drogas hoy aqu.
Si me quieres arrodillar
crtame las piernas y an podr volar.
Eih to que me tienes harto
Que yo me como a dios por una pata
Que t no sabes con quin te juegas los cuartos
Conmigo y tranquilo
soy un hombre bueno en todos los sentidos.
Pero es que como cada da en el infiemo me aburra
me vine a malear
vi a la virgen Maria cansada de ser virgen
metiendo en un portal.
Si llega la polica no es pecado vida mia
ponerse a disparar
saqu la artilleda y me fall la puntera
y le met al dueo del bar.

Swear no love but yours will do
Then they'll leave you for another
Break your little heart in two.

If I were a little sparrow
O'er these mountains I would fly

Look into your lying eyes.
I would flutter all around you
On my little sparrow wings
I would ask you I would ask you
Why you let me love in vain.
I am not a little sparrow
I am just the broken dream
Of a cold falsehearted lover
And your evil cunning scheme.

And my heart is breaking
Hell is awakened
The souls it's taking
We'll take them back where they belong
You can not make us stop
You'll never make us stop
It's not about the songs
It's about our God
Who will stand to rise against injustice
Take up the cause of the unwanted ones
Who will stand to fight against it
We live we fight
We live we die
We fight for love
We live we fight
We live we die
We fight for love
We live we live we fight we fight
We live we die
We fight for love
We live we live we fight we fight
We live we die
We fight for love
Church windows breaking
From people living outside the walls
The bride must be ready
For Jesus' imminent return
Who will stand to rise against injustice
Take up the cause of the unwanted ones
Who will stand to fight against it
We live we fight
We live we die
We fight for love
We live we fight
We live we die
We fight for love
We live we live we fight we fight
We live we die
We fight for love
We live we live we fight we fight
We live we die
We fight for love <start> Man it's a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday sun
Well I hear you whispering in the words to melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My muequita my Spanish Harlem Monalisa
You're my reason for reason
The step in my groove
And if you said this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Oh it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth yeah
Give me your heart make it real or else forget about it
But I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
In every breath and every word
I hear your name calling me out
Out from the barrio
You hear my rhythm on your radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
It's turning you round and round
And if you said this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Oh it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth yeah
Give me your heart make it real or else forget about it
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Oh it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth yeah
Give me your heart make it real or else forget about it
Or else forget about it
Or else forget about it
Let's not forget about it
Give me your heart make it real
Let's not forget about it
Let's not forget about it
Let's not forget about it
Let's not forget about it
Let's not forget about it <start> 
I've lost count of the ladies I've held in my arms
All shapes and sizes they've come and they've gone
I've found one that's a keeper and I'm keeping every vow
I've never held a lady like the one I'm holding now
She's younger and prettier than anyone I've known
The kind of a lady that makes a man come home
I'm mighty close to heaven as close as God allows
And I'm thankful I'm holding the one I'm holding now
On the streets she's a lady but when she's in my arms
The lady's all woman she's all I'll ever want
Lovin' comes so natural Lord knows she knows how
And I've never loved a lady like the one I'm holding now
She's younger and prettier than anyone I've known
The kind of a lady that makes a man come home
I'm mighty close to heaven as close as God allows
And I'm thankful I'm holding the one I'm holding now
I'm mighty close to heaven as close as God allows
And I'm thankful I'm holding the one I'm holding now
  Sunbury Music Ltd. <start> Trapped  locked in life
Not for long  bound for death
My revenge
I don't belong here
Tear down  The blood clotted walls of reality
Break through  The lies of the living world
Burn your body  your disguise
Face eternity with open eyes
Can't you see that this is not real
Taste my wine drink the darkness of my heart
Ohh Gift of life  pure disgust
I long to die
Singing to praise of Death
Pale worlds of emtiness
Only black is true  only black is real
Written in scars on my heart
Those words of truth  you will feel
That only black is true  that only black is real
This winter of my soul
Is turning my blood into ice
I am death  I kill life
I am here  hungry to kill the light
I kill
In this shape  in this disguise
Sent out  to bring an end to it all
Only death is true  only death is real
Here is nothing like life
Nothing even close
Yeah  Only death is true  there is only death in me
Nothing left but silence
Ashes dust and darkness
Close my soul and scream out the darkness
Of my heart
Spewing forth  the hate for all things holy
In the night the voices cry
In my dreams I hear them call my name
Night after night
This ghostsong rings on and on...
No candles burn
No lights shines on this deep dark lake
And there is no hiding from this pain
We are of stone like statues cold
But did you see the cracks on my white chest
Just above the heart
Drained of life and blackened with dead love
To speak the names  invocation of evil
Satan  beast of me
Rise up  from inside
Of the darkness
Of my heart
The dark disciple of death
And emptiness
I am death  I kill life
I am here  hungry to kill myself
I kill...
It feels so real  this blood is art
Riding high  against the walls of the room
Only black is true  only black is real
Written in scars on my heart
Those words of truth  you will feel
That only black is true  that only black is real
This winter of my soul
Is turning my life into hell.
In memory of Dead. <start> Breakfast in the room continental
So went to find a small cafe
Latin lovers can be temperamental
You have to be careful what you say
God what have I done
Trying hard to leave the past behind me
Hoping to avoid the same mistake
Haunting memories that still remind me
How lonely is the road that I must take
God what have I done
Everything seems so strange
God what have I done
Everything seems so strange <start> Just like mercury jones
Styles change
I stay the same
Just like mercury jones
Message fly
Through the door
And just like mercury jones
Breathing all the evil to your mother's bones
Now he's knocking at your door
Better come back to the giver of the loan
Just like mercury jones
Trap door
And the troubadours
Just like mercury jones
I'm making the myth
Spirits split
Just like mercury jones
Tingling spine
And the razor lips
Now he's knocking at your door
Better come back to the giver of your loan
Now he's dreaming of the daisies
Falling back to the cages of runs <start> Flatfoot Sam bought an automobile
No money down it was a real good deal
Didn't wanna work just ride around town
Finance come they put his feets on the ground
Oh Flatfoot Sam you're always in a jam
Flatfoot Sam stole a ten dollar bill
He told the judge he did it for a thrill
He got sixty days to spend in fine
Thank you judge for being so kind
Oh Flatfoot Sam you're always in a jam
Flatfoot Sam he got him a job
The very same day the place got robbed
The cats got away they couldn't be found
They take it's old Sam and they tagged him down
Oh Flatfoot Sam you're always in a jam
Flatfoot Sam playin' a chuckaluck game
The dice got switched Sam got the blame
He pulled out a gun shut out the light
Everybody hollered run for your life
Oh Flatfoot Sam you're always in a jam
Flatfoot Sam went out on a spree
He met with a gal weighs six stone three
She spent all his money sold all his land
Next thing she did she got another man
Oh Flatfoot Sam you're always in a jam <start> Well I don't think I'm as quite as dumb as
As you might think I am

Nothing else matters to me <start> It is the st century. The Final Experiment has failed. The final devastating war that
was foretold by the blind minstrel Ayreon has indeed come to pass. The war has destroyed
all life on Earth making it completely uninhabitable. I hover above my own dead body...
Lana Lane
Silence fills the air
Echoes fade away
Of sadness and despair
On that cruel and fateful day
My body lies motionless
Upon the kitchen floor
The Earth has died the world's at rest

Many centuries ago
In a dark enchanted land
Our fate had been foretold
By a poor misguided man
We carried on down the road we chose
The path of nevermore
The journey ends the book is closed

And now I have to leave my work on earth is done
I'm heading for the planet known as Mars
To the last of its race the final newborn son
Before I start my voyage to the stars <start> It was a different time
I had others to make up my mind
That and nothing ever seems as kind
As you saying hi
And I still can see your home
I know we walked that line
Of when we stopped being friends
And you became mine
We said until our lives would ever end
I can still see your grin
A ray through the dirt in the hole
No one ever warned me
How hard it is to do
Lie myself through lovers
Cheat my way through school
Nothing ever will be quite as true
Like the way that I love you
I love you
Ohh I know I take things hard
But ohhh this was all that I was living for
Nothing ever will be quite as true
As the way that I love you
I'm staring at my feet
Inside the concrete they poured
On our street
My name just under yours
And I feel fine
Although I'm not fine
When are you coming home
If I could do it over
Before your time was through
I'd take back every lie I spoke
And the hell I put you through
Nothing ever will be quite as true
Like the way that I love you
I love you <start> I drive by your house its late  Your silhouette  In the window  I want to stand on your front lawn  With a radio  Playing our song  Like John Cusack  In Say Anything  But acting scares me  And so does everything  You'll always be my shining star  And I wonder how you are  And why you haven't called  I miss the way you look at night  Standing before me  In just your panties  I want to get lost in your hair  I want to feel you  Like I used to  And do you miss me  Like I miss you  Remember our tree  The way I kissed you <start> Come on I'll take you on a journey through the mind of a madman
With the common misconception that he's got an ace in his upper hand
Sees  but as blind as can be
Why's everybody always picking on me
When insecurity comes aknockin' it plans to take you for a ride
It doesn't come so easy with the devil by its side
Frustration nonfriction this vixen you lose
Ah come on lets face it no one's picking but you
She'll take your lovin' and leave you feeling so confused
She'll take your lovin' boy there's nothing more that you can do
She'll say that she wants to be with you she wised you were dead
She's fucked with your mind now she's got in your head
What more now can you say
What she'll say not always what she'll do
Watch out for things she's never gonna tell you
What she'll say not always what she'll do
Watch out for things she's never gonna tell you
Now jump back baby girl you'd better believe it
You've got the bull by the horns like it as just open season
Faked me out again but I watch your true colors show
Because where I'm standing from hell nobody knows
Can you feel it It's real
You've got me now
You've taken over taken off and taken me down
Through your mind running through your soul
With every look like daggers piercing girl you just don't know
She'll take your lovin' and leave you feeling so confused
She'll take your lovin' boy there's nothing more that you can do
She'll say that she wants to be with you she wised you were dead
She's fucked with your mind now she's got in your head
What more now can you say
The secrets of a madman what can you say
What she'll say not always what she'll do
Watch out for things she's never gonna tell you <start> I can feel the magic
Suddenly it's all around
I can see it clearly
I can even hear the sound
It's all so new to me
I'm not the same
If this is love
Then you're to blame
Mama mama when you look at me
I see love in your eyes
Mama mama softly sweet tender love in your eyes
You are all I live for
Maybe that's enough to say
And you're the one I wrote this song for
Everywhere and everyway
It's all so new to me
I'm not the same
It's words I feel
But can't explain
Mama mama when you look at me
I see love in your eyes
Mama mama softly sweet tender love in your eyes
Mama mama mama mama
I really love you
I really need you
Mama mama mama mama
I really need you mama

Did you know you're my favourite...
Did you know you're my favourite patient here
Did you know that I need you...
Did you know that I need this treatment more than you do
When you find it hard to breathe
And your heart has skipped a beat
We'll rush you to intensive care
AND DECLARE emergency 
Well I'm not gonna lie to you
This is gonna hurt
Like nothing that you've ever felt
This is gonna hurt like hell 
And if it takes us through the night
I'll sleep WHEN YOU ARE ALRIGHT
I'LL SLEEP WHEN YOU'RE FINE
When you regain your vital signs
Do you remember love...
Do you remember love for the first time
I'm sorry TO SAY...
I'm sorry it'll never be like that again
When you find it hard to breathe
And your heart has skipped a beat
We'll rush you to intensive care

Talking to moon and tree
And the tall spring grass
Like waves on a dark green sea
So much of what we are
We will always be
And I don't mind getting lost
In your dream

Your eyes are a mirror
Your grace fills my soul
Your heart like a river
Your tears are my own
They are my own
Well I feel like I'm walking on hot coals
And I don't mind getting burned
But I fear for this soul
You fell into my life
The way a star falls from the sky
Now I'm forever lost in your eyes
 <start> I wonder why this world is sweet Hell
I wonder why this world is in uproar
Everyday you read about somethin' new
They're fightin' all over the world
People fightin' all over the world
Race against race they're fightin' everyday
I wonder when disaster comin' to a end
I wonder when I wonder when
This nightmare comin' to a end
I can't believe it's gonna last always
And every time I pick up a paper
I always read bad news
And every time I pick up a paper
I always read bad news
I wonder when this nightmare is gonna end
You find so many young people
They're fightnin' in every town on campus
You find so many young people
They're fightnin' in every town on campus
I don't know don't know what they're right or wrong
But they're kind of fightin' for their rights yeah yeah yeah
The old people leave the young kids alone
Let them run their own lives yeah yeah
The old folks leave the young kids alone
And let them run their own life
It's a brand new world today
Look at here now you'll find some of them old people
They're not hip to the modern days
They want their kids to live like they live
But no them days are gone
It's a brand new world
One way to solve their problem it takes time
The old coots die out and leave it to the young kids
Be a beautiful world and then
There won't be no fighting on campus any more
'Cause my kids and your kids when they grow up and get drunk
They'll understand all old coots are gone in their grave
But as long as they live there's gonna be figitin' in every town
Hey hey in every campus the young kids walkin' out
Hey hey hey hey the old folks when they're gone when they're gone
It'll be a better world to live in
Couple a young kids is the world today
Thank you <start> It's been a long road
We've walked the last mile
We reach the same conclusion
And we stop for a while
Together we know
The way we must go
We're leaving an illusion
That's for us to share
Only for us to share
We live our separate lives
And go our different ways
'Cause we don't see eye to eye
And we can't stand face to face
We live our separate lives
While counting all the days
Till the two of us arrive
In another time and place
We share the same thoughts
We read the same lines
We meet on sad occasions
And in happier times
A spoken goodbye
And both of us try
To walk away in silence
That's for us to share
Only for us to share
We live our separate lives
And go our different ways
'Cause we don't see eye to eye
And we can't stand face to face
We live our separate lives
While counting all the days
Till the two of us arrive
In another time and place
And always goodbye
But heaven knows why
I can't erase the memory
That's for us to share
Only for us to share
Only for us to share
Only for us to share
We live our separate lives
And go our different ways
'Cause we don't see eye to eye
And we can't stand face to face
We live our separate lives
While counting all the days
Till the two of us arrive
In another time and place
We live our separate lives
And go our different ways
'Cause we don't see eye to eye
And we can't stand face to face
We live our separate lives
While counting all the days
Till the two of us arrive
In another time and place <start> When it's love you give
I'll be a man of good faith.
then in love you live.
I'll make a stand. I won't break.
I'll be the rock you can build on

to have and to hold.
When there's love inside
I swear I'll always be strong.
then there's a reason why.
I'll prove to you we belong.
I'll be the wal that protects you
from the wind and the rain
from the hurt and pain.
Let's make it all for one and all for love.
Let the one you hold be the one you want
the one you need
'cause when it's all for onee it's one for all.
When there's someone that should know
then just let your feelings show
and make it all for one and all for love.
When it's love you make
I'll be the fire in your night.
then it's love you take.
I will defend I will fight.
I'll be there when you need me.
When honor's at stake
this vow I will make
that it's all for one and all for love.
Let the one be the one you want
the one you need
'cause when it's all for one it's one for all.
When there's someone that should know
then just let your feelings show

Don't lay our love to rest
'cause we could stand up to you test.
We got everything and more than we had planned
more than the rivers that run the land.
We've got it all in our hands.
Now it's all for one and all for love.
It's all for love.
Let the one you hold be the one you want
the one you need
'cause when it's all for one it's one for all.

Who put a hole and taken less

I don't know why I must love money
I love you better when there's nobody else
Nothin' to hold me to hold me back

Am I always gonna be this blind
Am I always gonna be this...

And I suck  fine <start> Tin soldiers and Nixon's coming
Tin soldiers and Nixon's coming

What if you knew her and found her dead on the ground
How could you run when you know
Na nanana na na na na
Na nanana na na na
Na nanana na na na na
Na nanana na na na <start> So so you think you can tell heaven from Hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail
A smile from a veil Do you think you can tell
So do you think we can change
Everybody that hates before it's too late
So proud to be free but who can we blame
Don't be ashamed do you think we can change
How I wish how I wish you were here
We're one lost soul swimming in a fish bowl year after year
Running over the same old ground what have we found
The same old fears wish you were here
We don't need need any more pain
We just need to remain on the very same page
So much to gain
No more losing a friend or losing ourselves
We just need your help so glad you're here <start> All for the love of leaving am I
All for the love of grieving am I
Looking for you in the longing of life
When all along you were here by my side
It's a high your
It's a high it's a high your love
Far in the future or in the past
I was a drifting bound to the mast
Searching for you on the ocean of loss
And all along no ocean to cross
It's a high your
It's high it's a high your love
All on the island she danced
Sleep of forgetfulness entranced
Gazing on new some distance star
Om Shri Sai Baba so near so far
It's a high your
It's high it's a high your love
All for the love of grieving am I
All for the love of leaving am I
Looking for you in the longing of life
When all along you were here by my side

Out in cucamonga
Many years ago
Near a holy roller church
There was once a place
Where me and a couple of friends
Began practicing for the time
We might go on tv
And as fate would have it
Later on we got a chance to play.
All we ever really knew
That it was crazy 
To be doin' it any other way <start> Prisoners of ourselves
Desperate little elves
We hide inside a tree
And wear a beard of bees
Chorus
But do you know that when
You're here with me
That's the only time that I feel free
So wrap me in your skin
A holiday of sin
We'll take it when we can
There is no master plan
Chorus
And everything is true
If we think it through
Or maybe it's a lie
We'll find out when we die
Chorus <start> Once upon a time there were five young guys
Hanging in and out of Newcastle
Playing Rhythm and Blues had nothing to lose
They didn't need no tinpan hassle
Over Reeperbahn where the beat was born
Shocking the heart of the nation
A sign of the times a new search of life
Start of a new rock generation
From day one to kingdom come
I'd do it all again
I used to be an animal
I used to be an animal
I used to be an animal
But I'm alright now
Alright now girl alright
Just twenty years ago we were children of war
But we danced to the Bo Diddley beat
There was rockers and mods didn't take it too hard
We had blue suede shoes on our feet
A revolution in France and James Brown's dance
A new world coming our way
We'd talk that talk in the streets of New York
And never looked back to this day
From day one to the risin' sun
I'll do it all again
I used to be an animal

I used to be an animal

I used to be an animal

But I'm all right now
Used to be an animal

Used to be an animal

Used to be an animal

Now all right all right all right
Yeah yeah all right
We were flippin' and trippin'
And rockin' and rollin' and generally havin' a ball
For the price of a drink there was no time
To think about the morality of it all
There was freaks and queens and loveins and has beens
Whiskyagogos and all night flamingos
A psychedelic explosion in slow motion
Dr Strangelove's bomb
From day one to kingdom come
I'd do it all again
I used to be an animal

I used to be an animal

I used to be an animal
But I'm alright now
I used to be an animal

I used to be an animal

I used to be an animal

I used to be an animal

I used to be an animal

I used to be an animal

... <start> Shove me under you again
I can't wait for this to end
Sober empty in the head
I know I can never win
Why should I have to wait
I'll just look the other way
Chorus
We left this land of shiny lights
I wish I may I wish I might
When all these dreams have come to end
You wish you were you're not my friend
I can see you suffocate
I can find no other way
Try to make you saturate
I can be your enemy
Why should I have to wait
I'll just look the other way
Chorus
Whoa no
Chorus
You said you'd love
To see the end
The long hard road
That I have been
When all these dreams have come to end
You wish you were you're not my friend
Blind eyes shine bright <start> Hi ho tripper's out cold
I've got a feeling like a tired old flow
I know what I am they know what they are
So let me be
Gasoline saccharinne
I've got no reason for the state I'm in
But I know what I am they know what they are
So let me be
Hotel Taco Bell
I got the hit but you know damned well
But I know what I am they know what they are
So let me be
Cut teeth bet a belief
I've got a feeling that I'm underneath
But I know what I am they know what they are
So let me be
But it's alright it's okay
I got the time but the time don't pay
It's alright it's okay
I got the time but the time don't pay
It's alright it's okay
I got the time but the time don't pay
It's alright it's okay
Flick flack no slack
I've got the wit that my enemies lack
But I know what I am they know what they are
So let me be
Trick some just begun
I'm givin' you more when you only want one
But I know what I am they know what they are
So let me be
Hot sweat got debt
Keep your licker in the locker 'cos you don't know yet
But I know what I am they know what they are
So let me be
Ship shape ticker tape
Looks to me like a narrow escape
But I know what I am they know what they are
So let me be
But it's alright it's okay
I got the time but the time don't pay
It's alright it's okay
I got the time but the time don't pay

So let me be <start> Fee fi fo she smells his body
She smells his body
And it makes her sick to her mind
He has got so much to answer for
To answer for
To ruin a child's mind
How could you touch something
So innocent and pure
Obscure
How could you get satisfaction
From the body of a child
You're ville sick
Chorus
It's true what people say
God protect the ones who help themselves
In their own way
It's true what people say
God protect the ones who help themselves
In their own way
He was sitting in her bedroom
In her bedroom
And now what should she do
She's got so much insecurity
And his impurity
It was a gathering gloom
How could you touch something
So innocent and pure
Obscure
How could you get satisfaction
From the body of a child
Youre vilem sick
Repeat Chorus twice
Fee fi fo <start> Whoaohoh
Come down from the mountain you have been gone too long
The spring is upon us follow my only song
Settle down with me by the fire of my yearning
You should come back home back on your own now
The world is alive now in and outside our home
You run through the forest settle before the sun
Darling I can barely remember you beside me
You should come back home back on your own now
In the evening light when the woman of the woods came by
To give to you the word of the old man
In the morning tide when the sparrow and the seagull fly
And Johnathan and Evelyn get tired
Lie to me if you will at the top of Beringer Hill
Tell me anything you want any old lie will do
Call me back to you
Back to you <start> Walk away from all the pain
Found the peace with it again
And after all I've seen
And everything in between
My heart's the one to blame
My heart's to blame
So where do we all go from here
It's time to say goodbye you're on your own
And this is where I disappear
So turning back is what I hate the most
It doesn't matter anyways
I guess there's nothing left to say
So where do we all go from here
It's time to say goodbye your on your own
I ran away from my mistakes
Crashed and burned and in okay
The most important thing
Learning what it all will bring
My hearts the one to blame <start> Does the bite still sting
Did it make you feel the world
Did the venom enter your heart
Like a love on the way
Was a killer inside your head
Did your memories often fade
Is it hard to breathe
Did we make you this way
What happens now
Need a hero to save the day
Pick us up and just fly away
What happens now
Need a hero to save the day
Now he's on the way
Did it freak you out
Could you feel it in your veins
When the venom enters your heart
Do the stars shine the same
Did you think you could save the world
Are you far far away
Is there someone made for you
Did we take her away
What happens now
Need a hero to save the day
Pick us up and just fly away
What happens now
Need a hero to save the day
Now he's on the way <start> Verse 
Oh honeybear honeybear honeybear
Mascara blood ash and cum
On the Rorschach sheets where we make love
Honeybear honeybear honeybear 
You fuck the world damn straight malaise
It may be just us who feel this way
But don't ever doubt this my steadfast conviction
My love you're the one I want to watch the ship go down with
The future can't be real I barely know how long a moment is
Unless we're naked getting high on the mattress
While the global market crashes
As death fills the streets we're gardenvariety oblivious
You grab my hand and say in an I told you so voice
It's just how we expected
Chorus
Everything is doomed
And nothing will be spared
But I love you honeybear 
Honeybear honeybear honeybear

Verse 
You're bent over the altar
And the neighbors are complaining
That the misanthropes next door
Are probably conceiving a Damien
Don't they see the darkness rising
Good luck fingering oblivion
We're getting out now while we can
You're welcome boys have the last of the smokes and chicken
Just one Cadillac will do to get us out to where we're going
I've brought my mother's depression
You've got your father's scorn and a wayward aunt's schizophrenia
Chorus
But everything is fine
Don't give into despair
Cause I love you honeybear 
Honeybear honeybear honeybear

 <start> Too many things I've never spoken
I'm not feeling fine
I never told you what to do
I never made you a promise that you could hold me to
That'll be the day you see me crying
Everyday I still say you're dead and broken
Everyday I still say you're dead and broken
You're dead and broken
How many faces can you show me
How many times can you be right
Another world of fantasy
Another reason for dramatizing everything
Taking it all in just one more time
I'm dying
Everyday I still say you're dead and broken
Everyday I still say you're dead and broken
You're dead and broken
Sorry to see that you're underestimated lately
I'd rather be dead and broken than living in your grace
Everyday I still say you're dead and broken
Everyday I still say you're dead and broken
You're dead and broken
You're dead and broken
You're dead and broken
You're dead and broken
You're dead and broken
You're dead and broken
You're dead and broken <start> So douse me in your love
I drown in your water
Burning through minefields
All systems on overload
Falling downwards
This spiral is awkward
I see the danger in your eyes
She promised she'd fix me
Now all she does is miss me
She loves me
She loves me not
She loves me
She loves me not
I was gone when she began to die
This house is on fire
This house is on fire
I been around
But I never been around here
I never been around here
This heart is on fire
This heart is on fire
And I been down
But I never been down here
I never been down here
This heart is on fire
Fire fire fire fire
Get your speed up
Get yourself clean
Get your center back to
Wherever it should be
I wish I could save you
Instead I go insane for you
The emptiness is all mine
This house is on fire
This house is on fire
I been around
But I never been around here
I never been around here
This heart is on fire
This heart is on fire
And I been down
But I never been down here
I never been down here
This heart is on fire
Fire fire fire fire
Kiss me slowly
Love me strong
Need me find us
All night long
Blood stained youth
It was all that I could do yeah
You kill me with silence
The way that only lovers do
I miss you always
But mostly when I'm with you
Art can save us
It does it all the time
Let it come to save your mind
This house is on fire
This house is on fire
I been around
But I never been around here
I never been around here
This heart is on fire
This heart is on fire
I been down
But I never been down here

Now you eat the dust and you taste the
Puppy chow this ain't no standstill hold
Up captain crunch a desperado I take you
Out to lunch I'll yank your milk money
Honey it's a royal treatment no tracks out
Back in the wet cement a broke tooth
And a phone booth and a change of
Clothes 'cause everyone knows I get
Mean in the smoke screen half time going
On the crime scene operation down low
You call your hero but like sweetback I
Got no Afro I'm coming dark creepin' in
Your alley watch your eyes as I make a
Quick getaway gonna trap me slingshot
Happy spider web window with a fatal blow <start> Oh shit unwishful thinking
Unlawful damnation come forth through the crowd
Speak up so loud that the dead can hear you screaming
Your words they have more meaning then you think
That the friendly are listening
But really they're loathing
My world is exploding
Drop em like a bomb
So I'll drop em like a bomb
Ignorance so cliche one hit of pure decay
Wicked wretched catatonic
Lookin' for a place to vomit
Takin' on the fuckin' world
A body at a time
Now ya sit in devils heaven
Just before you know you're dead
I've got this itching sinking feeling
You're in someone else's bed
Now the blood suckers begin to show their teeth
Your true color splattered on these walls in red
Smoke and mirrors they hide the spit behind your teeth
These illusions got me suffering
It's not my fault
You can't be serious
Wicked wretched catatonic
Lookin' for a place to vomit
Take that bullshit elsewhere
You can't be serious
You must be delirious
Sit tight this might get messy
We're painting the walls with these actions
If only they could speak
What happen should never leave
So tragic they won't believe
Now the blood suckers begin to show their teeth
Your true color splattered on these walls in red
Smoke and mirrors they hide the spit behind your teeth
These illusions got me suffering
No one knows
No one care
No one seems to hear what isn't said
Too afraid to stand up
Too ashamed to say
I deserve this
I deserve this
Letting go has set me free
Blood splattered these illusions got me suffering
Blood splattered these illusions got me suffering
I deserve this
I deserve this
Letting go has set me free

Now the blood suckers begin to show their teeth
Your true color splattered on these walls in red
Smoke and mirrors they hide the spit behind your teeth
These illusions got me suffering <start> Lyrics By Bill Stevenson And Karl Alvarez Music By Bill Stevenson Can't Wrap My Arms Around The Pictures In My Head I've Still Got A Ways To Go I'm Always Gone So We Talk On The Phone When I Hang Up Me And My HangUps Are Alone Until Then I Promised You I Wouldn't Bend Until Then I'll Spend My Time Waiting Until Then Until Then I'll Pretend And How About You Can You Promise Me You'll Wait We've Still Got Aways To Go Temptation Rules The Earth And I'm No Perfect Saint My Insecurities And Love Will Have To Wait Until Then I'll Pretend Until Then I'll Spend My Time Waiting Until Then Until Then I Promised You I Wouldn't Bend We're Not The Last To Fail We're Not The First To Try But I Know We Can Succeed We've Got To Hold It Up Of It Will Fall Until Then I'll Pretend Until Then I Promised You I Wouldn't Bend Until Then I'll Spend My Time Waiting Until Then Waiting Until Then Waiting Until Then <start> And did those feet in ancient time
Walk upon England's mountains green
And was the Holy Lamb of God
on England's pleasant pastures seen
And did the Countenance Divine
Shine forth upon our clouded hills
And was Jerusalem builded here
Among those dark Satanic mills
Bring me my bow of burning gold
Bring me my arrows of desire
Bring me my spear O clouds unfold
Bring me my Chariot of Fire
I will not cease from mental fight
Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand
Til we have built Jerusalem
In England's green and pleasant land <start> Lying on our backs
This is your parents' bed
A good place to be laid 'cos it's so neatly made.
Staring at the ceiling
Vein to vein the lines look the same
As the ones that you're seeing
And then you start speaking
Tracing your father's footsteps in your mother's shoes
Going up and over and across your latin roots.
Point points back to its origin
Across the world cogs are clogged with the sand
Here the air breathes freely and our tongues work loosely
Border approaches border
You're using your hands and smearing your r's.
I'm looking over my shoulder
Strained resistance to scour the door for
your father's footsteps or your mother's shoes
Coming up and over cut across your latin roots.
It's time to meet you makers. <start> By the way
By you side I'll stay
If that's okay
Then by your side I'll stay forever
Here I'm standing up
Because I want to fall in love with you
A sunless day
It was a clumsy card house rape
If that's okay
Then by your side I'll stay forever
Here I'm standing up
Because I want to fall in love
Forever...
Here I'm standing up
Because I want to fall
All our kinds will play.
A sunless day.
The rain will come.
The rain always brings our heroes.
All our kids will play.
A sunless day.
The rain will come.
The rain always brings our heroes.
Believe in heroes.
By the way
By you side I stay
If that's okay
Then by your side I'll stay forever
Yeah I said forever <start> Once in a while will you try to give
One little thought to me
Though someone else may be
Nearer to your heart
Will you dream of the moments
I shared with you
Before we drifted apart
Once in a while
In love's smouldering embers
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
The spark may burn again
I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while
In love's smouldering embers
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
The spark may burn again
I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while <start> I get bombed much like Pearl Harbor
The price is white right and I'm Bob Barker
This is your brain on drugs
This is your brain on Jackie Onassis
All you crotch goblins can kiss our asses
Yes siree Bob like corn on the cob
I'm all buttered up ready to hob nob
Daddy is a kraut you're Nazioccupied France
I'm gonna rise to the occasion inside my pants
So yo ass yea you I want to Fraggle Rock your girlie
Coming around the party coming around like Mr. Furley
I'm Mr. Furley you're Jack Tripper
You're dumb ass Gilligan and I'm the Skipper
Tiptoe through my tulips and come and frolic
Cause my name is Betty Ford and she's an alcoholic
So here I am Rock Me Like A Hurricane
Not a Scorpion but my sting will bring your dame a lot of pain
And Daddy's gonna tell ya I'm as cool as Jack The Ripper
Somewhat of a cutthroat but still a big tipper
As I tickle you pink I bet my fingers start to stink
I'm what's missing from your life and you're the missing link
It doesn't matter how you win or lose it's how you lick it
No rest for the wicked
Get down drink it up bring it on take it off
Flips it up in the air like my name was Bob Barker
I always kicks it cold so I gotta wear my parka
Leaving down my marker stalking like a stalker
Using the Force like my name was Luke Skywalker
Left hand's on the wheel and the right one on the bottle
One foot in the grave and the other on the throttle
I'm floating through your atmosphere like the Comet Haley's
As freaky as a freak show call me Barnum and Bailey
So yo ho my Cheerio here I'm coming around the bend
Don't try to shake my hand I'm not your fucking friend
Bodyslam ya to the ground like I was captain Lou Albano
Hit ya in the balls til you're singing soprano
Slide to the dance floor groove til you get sore
Listen to the tiger's roar I'll pump you like a seesaw
I'm a tattooed demon do you catch my meaning
Think that you're dreaming but soon you'll be screaming
I got more senseless violence than a thriller in Manila
Like my hero Gacy I'm a stone cold killer
Got my moves from Thriller I'm Fish you're Barney Miller
I'm spreading out the carnage like I'm Mechagodzilla
Like Jimmy Pop says he's as cool as Jack The Ripper
So take off your panties and kick off your slippers
Do as i say and I will be a big tipper
More smooth moves than my man Jack Tripper
Get down drink it up bring it on take it off <start> Bring tea for the Tillerman
Steak for the sun
Wine for the women who made the rain come
Seagulls sing your hearts away
'Cause while the sinners sin the children play
Oh Lord how they play and play
For that happy day for that happy day <start> These words roll of my tongue like second nature
But Im far from my womb and you know Im far from you
So when do I come back to you
Was this already written or have I fallen so far
I cant tell the light from the dark
I cant tell the light from the dark
I thought you had me forever
But Im sure you thought the same about me
And Im sorry so sorry
Sorry so sorry
Sorry so sorry
Sorry so sorry
These dreams run through my head
That frolic through some tube of my brain
Im going insane Ive forgotten my name
So Ill use yours like a dropped friend I wish I never left
I wish I never left you I wish I never left you
I cant tell the light from the dark
I cant tell the light from the dark
I thought you had me forever
But Im sure you thought the same about me
And Im sorry so sorry
Sorry so sorry
Sorry so sorry
Sorry so sorry
Winters come early this year
Like a bird in the rain Ive tortured my everything
Winters come early this year
Like a bird in the rain Ive tortured my everything
Winters come early this year
Like a bird in the rain Ive tortured my everything

Easy does it don't you know I'm sick to my stomach
So reach your hand back flick the switch on the portable
Lofi radio and kick the beat in
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
I'm fading away but
I don't mind it's so much fun
Getting lost with you in the sun
Ego tryptophane you make me high
You lull me down and I wonder just why
Driving faster so much faster when we get there
Well it be a slow day out in the desert
There's so many daydreams along this road
A fountain in my head is on
I think it might explode
I think it might
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
I can't stay awake
I fall asleep and drift away
But I don't mind it's so much fun
Getting lost with you in the sun
Ego tryptophane you make me high
You lull me down and I wonder just why
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I don't mind it's so much fun
Getting lost with you in the sun
Ego tryptophane you make me high
You lull me down and I wonder why
I wonder why I wonder why I wonder just why
Hold me closely don't you know I'm sick <start> We're the last of the sleepless ones
Left behind by those we left behind tonight.
Quiet now let the boys intake
Were we always just your lost caused mistakes
Wait for me will you wait for me
I need you on my side.
Wait for me Meg wait for me
With arms wide.
Chorus
Alone left alone
Watch us slowly disappear with time.
Alone still alone
Forgotten lost and left behind.
Dark lit streets are no place for kids
But it gives us more of a home than you ever did.
We're the scientists left to our own demise
You're still our last chance to get out of this place alive.
Wait for me will you wait for me with arms wide
Chorus
Alone left alone
Watch us slowly disappear in time.
Alone left alone
Watch us slowly disappear with time.
Alone still alone
Forgotten lost and left
Chorus <start> Start stop and start stupid acting smart
Flirting with the flicks you say it's just for kicks
You'll be the victim of your own dirty tricks
You got yourself to tease and displease
Doors swinging wide you walked in to hide
Looking at your feet failure's complete
Saw you and me on the coinop TV
Frozen in fear every time we'd appear
I'm not surprised at all and really why should I be
See nothing wrong see nothing wrong
So sick and tired of all these pictures of me
Completely wrong totally wrong
Go walking by here come another guy
Jailer who sells personal hells
Who'd like to see me down on my fucking knees
Everybody's dying just to get the disease
Hey hey hey hey
I'm not surprised at all and really why should I be
See nothing wrong see nothing wrong
So sick and tired of all these pictures of me
Completely wrong totally wrong
I'm not surprised at all and really why should I be
See nothing wrong see nothing wrong
So sick and tired of all these pictures of me
Oh everybody's dying just to get the disease
Everybody's dying just to get the disease
Everybody's dying just to get the disease <start> The people and the politics are making me nervous
Attention the buzz master here at your service
I try to sing like there's nobody listening
I never forced anything on anyone
No you couldn't stop the rhino 
Can't take away what I no longer know
You couldn't stop the rhino
Yeah oh alright
You see them in the movies and down at the zoo
Are you watching them are they watching you
It's okay they can't do what other animals can do
'Cause animal's where humans belong
No you couldn't stop the rhino 
Can't take away what I no longer know
You couldn't stop the rhino
Yeah oh look at her run
Run like I've never seen
Out in the fields
Like you're supposed to be
Climb aboard
'Cause I wanna take you with me
All the way down
And I'll never be your soul's safekeeping now
The people and the politics are helping you see
They all take their special little piece of me
They don't take it all only more than they need
With no one left to put away the fire
No you couldn't stop the rhino 
Can't take away what I know no 'cause I know
You couldn't stop the rhino
Yeah couldn't stop the rhino
Oh you couldn't stop the rhino
Can't take away what I know no 'cause I know
You couldn't stop the rhino
Yeah oh look at her run <start> Avenue Park

Hi the captain says
Hello for the last time
We're goin' here and as you see
we're fading there
I'm not willing to satisfy your
small way of thinking
cause my attitude
has changed and now
I'm right out of here
But it makes me happy
Could have been the wrong one
but it makes me happy
I guess it's been the right one
But it makes me happy
somehow it makes me sad
it makes me sad
Hi the captain says
Should have been so lucky
but I was blind
I couldn't see
the man on the man on the run
Yes I know you still believe
believe in what you're thinking
about me
but I'm ok
just little bit afraid <start> Oh Monday morning waking up still too numb to speak
Another night just staring at the wall.
Last night's conversation knocked me off my feet
Guess today I'll fall
I wish that we could find the words to look the other way
Be careful of the things we do and watch the things we say
And maybe then we'd get somewhere we'd never been before
But what's the use in fighting when you know you've lost the war.
Walk the streets in New Orleans shirt soaked to my skin
Through the mess of yesterday's parade.
Thousand times a day I think of calling you again
Come to my senses instead.
And every time we walk away we lose a little time
Pretending to each other now that everything is fine.
I know whatever lies I use to get myself to sleep
I wake up to the promises I know we couldn't keep.
Say you don't see what's wrong
Every night lasting oh so long
And I know I do you're already gone.
I wonder should I get up would but what's the point
Oh once something's gone it's gone for good.
Maybe I could look away back to where we used to be
One more time I wish I could.
Oh never mind the reasons that tore us all apart
We've both done things I know we can't defend.
What's the use in tracing it all back to the start
There's something missing in the end.
I wish that we could find the words to look the other way
Be careful of the things we do and everything we say
And maybe then we'd get somewhere we'd never been before
But what's the use in fighting when you know you've lost the war.
Say you don't see what's wrong
Every night lasting oh so long
And I know I do you're already gone.
Oh I know I do you're already gone. <start> As I'm watching the world turn I go nuts
get sick to my stomach and throw up
this that flow up economy slow up
poor people die while the rich get more bucks
you know what you too blind to see
left behind who you are for what you tryin' to be
so all you really know is them lies you read
its apparently ain't something you need eyes to see
dont nobody give a fuck the government is killin us
tryin to take us out the streets but the street is still in us
I keep rollin I swear I never give it up
Im around till the Lord says send em up
Ask around homie belly is assured
This aint just rap homie you can tell us your all
Son of a gangsta born with a rebellious heart
And this is officially how the rebellion starts
Just follow me I'm the man thats leading ya
Believe in me I will believe in ya
Stop eatin the shit that they feedin ya
Watchin the news and believing the media
Say I'm way too smart for that
I got too much heart for that
Repeat that repeat that
I'm way too smart for that
I got too much heart for that
Just follow me
When the sunset and the moon come out
Thats when my dudes come out
Thats when the goons comes out
In the dark they know how to move about
Thats why my neighbours keep movin out
I got my mind right homie to grind tight
Changed up my life for more than just five mikes
For my future I paid a high price
Its kinda like if the blind could pass sight
I see the truth clearly now you hear me now
This is the point where you smile
Or when the tears comes out
Love me or hate me
The love is that made me
Cause this dirty game tried to fuck me and rape me
They thought that I would never be heard
Now I get a generation hanging on to every word
They thought they had me dead in a hearse
well guess what
now you witnessing my death and rebirth
Just follow me I'm the man thats leading ya
Believe in me I will believe in ya
Stop eatin the shit that they feedin ya
Watchin the news and believing the media
Say I'm way too smart for that
I got too much heart for that
Repeat that repeat that
I'm way too smart for that
I got too much heart for that
Just follow me
Lets just assume how you make your terror
The rap marvel gay or the modern day jay gaevera
How they paint them in your face your terror
Now they got me walk around feelin like I hate the mirror
I was known for the grimmiest rappin
Of them praying a lot more so tsunami to happen
Flashback same place flying to Manhattan
Of them urban signs since the time that happened
Osama bin laden Saddam and Iraq
And the bombs the war so peace is hard to imagine
I cant keep my opinion inside
I'm tryin to keep the innocent children and women alive
Think about all the civilians that died
Bush keeps tradin billion of dollars for millions of lives
I'm the general of the face of the truth
If you with me then move quickly now
Lace up your boots just follow me
Just follow me I'm the man thats leading ya
Believe in me I will believe in ya
Stop eatin the shit that they feedin ya
Watchin the news and believing the media
Say I'm way too smart for that
I got too much heart for that
Repeat that repeat that
I'm way too smart for that
I got too much heart for that
Just follow me <start> Think about me
That's all I'm asking for
Think about this
You know we need to allow for a turnaround
Oh and all these games to solve
To recognise
In the mirror
I wish I could change and make new rules
Conduct myself better
I have no rights and I give none
I should hold myself better
We are hopeless and lost
We subjugate ourselves
We're close enough to stop
I'm looking for common sense
Worry 'bout the same old things
Enough to get close to them
Close enough
In the mirror
I'm looking for common sense

Worry 'bout the same old things

Enough to get close to them
Close enough
In the mirror
Close enough
In the mirror
Close enough
In the mirror
Close enough <start> Corcovado parted the sky
And through the darkness
On us He shined
Crucified in stone
Still His blood is my own
Glory behold all my eyes have seen
I am blessed to be a witness
Some have flown away
And can't be with us here today
Like the hills of my home
Some have crumbled and now are gone
Gather around for today won't come again
I am blessed to be a witness
So much sorrow and pain
Still I will not live in vain
Like good questions never asked
Is wisdom wasted on the past
Only by the grace of God go I
I am blessed to be a witness <start> You already know this won't end with kisses
You already see you won't spare one another
But we'll have fine time not getting there
But we'll have fine time not getting there
It's easy on the ear but it's hard on you
You are no exception you won't end in the castle
But we'll have fine time not getting there
But we'll have fine time not getting there
But we'll have fine time not getting there
But we'll have fine time not getting there
But we'll have fine time
But we'll have fine time not getting there <start> I once met a young girl filled with fire
That saw through my front to this shell of a man
She knew I'd be a handful from the start
This strong willed woman had an angels heart
The holes in these wings don't allow me to fly
So you'd better brace for a life of pain
And if fate is the path to this better life
Somehow I feel you'll never see the faces change
Through thick and thin
She stood by you
She held the key to my broken heart
I look back and wonder
Sit and ponder.
How I could have ever neglected you.
For the blood soaked soil on the old ball field
I gambled on a hand I wasn't ready to lose
But if the tables were turned and I faced the troubles
Tough times and struggles I put you through
I'd of been there as you were through hardship and horror
My life and my love are pledged to you.
Through thick and thin
She stood by you
She held the key to my broken heart
Remember the nights she waited and wondered
fused to a myth that it had taken it's toll.
But this Godless man has mended his way
Never again will she be alone.
I remember it well
Still I always knew that she was destined to be my bride
This woman had pride
She was full of life.
I could see the passion in her eyes.
She thought she found a man
But she fell for the devil
An evil monster in disguise.
Now I'll honor and obey
Forever stay.
True to you my Irish rose
Through thick and thin
She stood by you
She held the key to my broken heart <start> Wide open eye
You serious
You delirious
Kissing chaos
Have you got a heart
You could really lose it in the
Super people mart
You are the most beautiful thing I know
And the most beautiful thing is
When I hear your heartbeat beat beat
Will human be dumb and free
Or some amazing catastrophe
Never too scared to bare
To care to running to the riot
Where the moment meets
The most beautiful thing I know
And the most beautiful thing is
Something new I dunno why
I know all there is I know
Something new I dunno why
I know all there is I know
La la la la la la la la la Baby
Yeah la.
Where is your how
Holding up your frown
A prop to stop you smiling now
Heaven or the heather
Or the miracles of weather
But you listen to
The most beautiful thing I know
And the most beautiful thing darling
Is where you hear your heartbeat beat beat
Is when I hear your heart <start> Eres inmune a mis requiebros
Repeles toda mi pasin
No le escuchas a mi corazn
Te portas como una basura.
Why en el horscopo me predicen
Mal panorama sentimental
Leo en la taza del chocolate
No dejars de ser porquera.
Dispuesto a probar
Este filtro de amor
Para tenerte ya
No dudo que har efecto
Ohohoh...
Orines de sapo negro
Una piedra de la calle
No dudo que har efecto
Ohohoh...
Me amars con este elixir
Te amarrar con este sortilegio
No dudo que har efecto
Ohohoh...
Sortilegio sortilegio
Sortilegioooo
 <start> Can you feel it crush you does it seem to bring the worst in you out
There's no running away from these things that hold you down
Do they complicate you because they make you feel like this
of all the colors that you've shine this is surely not your best
But you should know these colors that you're shining are
Surely not the best colors that you shine
I know you feel alone yeah and no one else can figure you out
But don't you ever turn away from the ones that help you down
Well they'd love to save you don't you know they love to see you smile
But these colors that you've shined are surely not your style
I know you're feeling like you're lost you've drifted way to far
But you should know these colors you're shining are surely not the best <start> I am who I am
I write songs
Not my wrongs
You can say goodbye
But don't consider me gone
'Cause I'll stay where I stand
You're like an hourglass
That needs more sand
How can I trust anyone else
When I can barely trust myself
I write songs baby
Not my wrongs baby
I win you lose
Same song baby
I am who I am
You know I'll bend the truth
I'll break it too
And I am who I am
You know I care for you
But not enough to let you go

But not enough to let you go

But not enough to let you go...
I am who I am
I confess all the rest
Caused a wreck in my chest
Made a mess
Cupid crashed
Now he's back
But if you want me
You can only have half
How can I love anyone else
When I can barely love myself
I write songs baby
Not my wrongs baby
I win you lose
Same song baby
I am who I am
You know I'll bend the truth
I'll break it too

And I am who I am
You know I care for you
But not enough to let you go

But not enough to let you go

But not enough to let you go
Oh yeah
Come on let's go
Yeah yeah yeah
The Cab
Yeah
Eloquent
Bringin' the house down
Let's drive 'em crazy
Over the top
Rock the hands up baby
Full of agression and attention lately
I'm rollin' with The Cab
That's money
Pay me
Lately everybody's hard to hang
'Cause we go back and forth
Like a boomerang
I'm sayin' I don't know how well you'll take this
Your secrets won't leak
Like what happens in Vegas
Face it you're the one that starts the fights
Screamin' loud and until your face
Turns red like brake lights
Balanced on a scale
It was a long race
But you're the first one to call
On the lonely nights
And baby baby
This ain't fair
I'm eloquent
We're goin' nowhere
This love affair
Got plenty of flaws
But I'm never gonna chch change
Because
I am who I am

You know I'll bend the truth
I'll break it too

And I am who I am
You know I care for you
But not enough to let you go

But not enough to let you go

But not enough to let you go <start> Its your bed so please choose a side ill take the one closest to the door and you start to speak the words that try to
Justify do far more wrong then anything you do so grab the coat the keys the tension speaks but we're singing it
chorus
Ill tap the break while you crack the window the smell of smoke is making my lungs explode the  is backed up and too slow
Lets tune out by turning on the radio and this town is dead weve been caught in these sheets way too long lets just see whos
Up on this screen no one i know is more depressing then me or should i say the two of us cause after all we're all weve got
And tension speaks but we're singing it
chorus
And oh my love youre all i need backed behind a frequency they played this
Song an hour ago lets tune out by turning on the radio havent we heard this song about a thousand times before oh well after
Awhile it all sounds the same i guess its better then silence and better then shame
chorus <start> A friend told me yesterday
You've been looking for me
If I've been staying out of your way
I've done it intentionally
Saw you walking with her

Always kept that few steps behind yeah
Wonder if she knows for sure

Her man's going on walking the line
Then I say to myself Beware
It's getting out of hand

It's getting out of hand

It means loving you is like being true
You've got another woman yeah
Look me right in the eye
Tell me I'm the one that you love
Right back into your lies
Forgetting how determined I was
Then I say to myself Beware
It's getting out of hand

It's getting out of hand

It means loving you is like being true
You've got another woman yeah
A friend told me yesterday hey <start>  verse  
Wounds that will not heal
Cover the scars of the tortured soul
Like broken machinery
Rusted and in the rain cannot be the same
 bridge 
I am damaged inside
I am burning inside
The hands of time keep on turning
And it's burning my eyes
 prechorus 
Love has no meaning to those who have never loved
Dreaming decieving phantasmagoria
 chorus 
I am damaged I am damaged I am damaged
Just another slave to the system
In this dying world
 verse  
All that time reveals
Stare at the scars till you're goin' blind
Like broken machinery
Rusted and sitting there far beyond repair
 bridge 
 prech 
 chorus 
 solo 
 prech 
 chorus  <start> I was just  years old
And Maggie's hair was black as coal.
And I felt this heart of mine go slipping away.
Now her eyes were bright as the stars up above.
Every word Maggie spoke was love.
And I felt this heart of mine go slipping away.
Falling in love again
Falling in love again.
We don't care if we don't ever do
Fall back out again
Time went on and my love it got stronger.
Me and Maggie couldn't wait any longer.
We had to go to town right away to see the Ju Ju Man.
I said Please please tell me Mr. Ju Ju Man
Read the cards that you've got in your hand.
I've got to make a plan for me and my Maggie love.
Falling in love again
Falling in love again.
We don't care if we don't ever do
Fall back out again
Maggie's Mama she'd like to hang me.
Maggie's Pa now I know he'd like to chain me
Cause he don't understand a word of what I said.
I said Please Mr. Ju Ju Man
Will I be holding Maggie's hand
When the robin sings again in the Spring next June
Falling in love again
Falling in love again.
We don't care if we don't ever do
Fall back out again <start> Leaping quick on leopard's back
I face the brunt of his attack
In the land of nod i'm king
Until the alarm clock rings
Stepping out from safety's door
I hear the rushing traffic roar
Smiling to myself i say
...hooray its a brand new day
Slashing my way through vine
I'll kill if i have to
I'll be there on time
Clawed through the freeway jam
I curse at the guy who passed me
Last time 'round
In my office settled back
Drink a cup of coffee 
Stretch my mind and try'n erase
The thought of the day to face
Life is like the leopard's den
And once you find you've fallen in
A safari of the heart
Surely comes to an end
Madness is our damnation
Strange is the situation we're all in
To one man it matters nothing
Others it shatters something no one wins
I could not see it myself 
I could not hear it myself 
I could not feel it myself 
I could not hear it myself 
I could not feel it myself 
For there's an animal in us all
The brunt of which you'll see <start> Downtown anywhere in the USA
You can find yourself a Hard Rock Cafe
Put your money on a number anyone can play
Come on and tell us all about what happened to you today
At the Hard Rock Cafe
come to the Hard Rock Cafe
I hope you can find your way to the Hard Rock Cafe
After a hard day's work I guarantee
there just isn't anywhere better to be
If you're unable to find good company
You can always sit down and watch the color TV
At the Hard Rock Cafe
come to the Hard Rock Cafe
The regulars can't keep away from the Hard Rock Cafe
And if you feeling just a little bit lonely
don't sit at home just hoping
Come on down to where the spirit flows so free
You know that door is always open
At the Hard Rock Cafe
come to the Hard Rock Cafe
They will help keep your blues at day at the Hard Rock Cafe <start> An obvious display
Of feelings that have dissipated
And I don't have a clue where to start
You wouldn't let me near you
So I settled for the fear that you'd be
Happy with me six feet in the ground
I will crash when your mood defeats me
Circle of trash swirls around beneath me
I feel paralyzed most every time you come around to meet me
Stuck in a place that I don't remember
Was it Sunday or last November
I feel paralyzed most every time you come around to meet me
Emotions vaporize
They disappear before my eyes
I wish for things that sadly have come true
So if I tried to make it right
And if I found my appetite
I'd eat away at all the pain I seem to bring to you <start> South Street Philadelphia
Out from Avenue C
I seen it in the eyes it was ready to freeze
From the valley hotel
I don't care about you
Fuck you
I don't care about you
Fuck you
I see Hollywood boulevard
Wellfair hotel
I spent the night in jail
In the Well ... hotel
I don't care about you
Fuck you

I see and old man ahve a heart attack in Manhattan
Well he dies while we just stood there lookin' at him
I don't care about you
Ohhhhhhhhh

Bodies the streets
Some man was sleepin' in puke ..... ....... rollin' on th street .... ......
I don't care about you
Oh noooooo
I don't care about you
Fuck you
I don't care about you
Hey Hey
I don't care about you <start> At last I've awakened to see what you've done.
All I can do is pack up and run.
Now I know the rules. Find yourself another fool.
You said that you loved me. I was yours to command.
Your kind of loving my heart couldn't stand.
You played me for a fool. Find yourself another fool.
And now now that we're through you say you wished you'd be true.
Oh but deep down in my heart I know our love could never grow.
And now now that we're through you say you wished you'd be true.
Oh but deep down in my heart I know our love will never grow.
At last I've awakened to see what you've done.
All I can do is pack up and run.
Now I know the rules. Find yourself another fool.
Now I know the rules. Find yourself another fool. <start> Hey Lord take a look all around
And I'd afind where my baby's gonna be.
Hey Lord would ya look out for her tonight
'Cause she is far across the sea.
Hey Lord would ya look out for her tonight
And make sure that she's gonna be alright
And things are gonna be alright with me.
Hey Lord would ya look out for her tonight
And make sure that all her dreams are sweet.
Said now would ya guide her on the roads
And make them softer for her feet.
Hey Lord would ya look out for her tonight
And make sure that she's gonna be alright
Until she's home and here with me.
Hey Lord would ya look out for her tonight
If she is sleepin' under the sky.
Said now make sure the ground she's sleepin' on
Is always warm and dry.
Ummm don'tcha give her too much rain
Try to keep her away from pain
Because my baby hates to cry.
Hey Lord would ya look out for her tonight
'Cause it gets rough along the way.
Said now this song seems strange is just because
I don't know how to pray.
Ummm won'tcha give her peace of mind
And if you ever find the time
Won'tcha tell her I miss her everyday. <start> We're leaving every turn unstoned
And every lesson is unlearned..
With nothing said and nothing done
I know it works on everyone....
Because love cools and friends drift apart
Too old to be shy
But I wonder what to say
 After I said Hi
Are we alive here Are we loosers are we winners
Are we alive here
Sometimes I doubt but if we get it all out it's so clear
But hey what's on for dinner
Are we alive here
Would you please pass the guilt...
Just like a tune on ears of stone
It will be ringing through your bones
It's the push that no one sees..
That gives a mouth of broken teeth yeah
Because love cools yeah and friends drift apart
And the sky's weighed down with clouds of stone yeah
And the mirror stares back on a smile of it's own..
Too old to be shy and I wonder what to say  After I said Hi
Are we alive here Are we loosers are we winners
Are we alive here
Sometimes I'm in doubt but if we get it all out it's soooo clear
But hey what's on for dinner
Are we alive here
Are we alive or not  do we have nothing in our head but..
I know it's time to go now we've said hello
Are we alive here Are we loosers are we winners
Are we alive here
Sometimes I doubt but if we get it all out it's sooo clear
But hey what's on for dinner
Are we alive here
Would you please pass the guilt yeah
Love cools yeah and friends drift apart
And the sky's weighed down with clouds of stoooneeeehhhnnn
Are we alive here Are we alive here Are we alive here <start> Words and Music Mike Connell
And once said please some more
And not even now and then.
Some place I know you swore
That you'd never go again.
I had this feeling once
That nothing was out of touch.
I found some comfort there
But that doesn't matter much.
And did we start digging around
And did we start dragging around
Be my burden
Christ I'm certain I'm already bound.
I'm not ever quite together
I'm not sorted out.
You talked to me some more
And that was worth waiting for.
Sometimes I can't decide
If we're even half alive. <start> You taught me to realign my chakra
speak to my inner consciousness.
You made me listen to John Butler
and other rubbish that bored me to shit
You wanted to move up the North Coast
where everthing is so much better
Where you can play Djembes on the beach
I used to get mad
I used to get angry
I used to hate everyone i met
You taught me love
You showed me kindness
You painted flowers on my face
And that gave me the shits
Fuck i hated that
but it taught me a valuable lesson too
Now i love everyone but you
We had mushrooms in the morning
I was braindead for eternity
I took my clothes off
you didn't like that
and neither did the checkout chick from coles
i tried to pash the store security
I used to get mad
I used to get angry
I used to be cynical i know
You taught me love
You taught me yoga
You threw the fire around my head.
And that gave me the shits
Fuck i hated that
but it taught me a valuable lesson too
Now i love everyone but you
You wont make me live with no shoes.
Now every full moon i think of last year
and when we went to the bush doof party
And how the acid made the music worse.
I know she had a good heart
when she stood in front of trees.
But she talked out her arse
she could see me aura turning bad.
And that gave me the shits
Fuck i hated that
everyone else i know thanks you.
Now i love everyone but you
I passively resist your coup. <start> I thought it was forever
I thought it would last
Gotta try to make it
A page of my past
You didn't even say goodbye
When you slammed that door
Now I'm lyin' here alone
In what once was our bed
Trying to forget
All the cruel words you said
All the radio was playing
What once was our favorite song
Oh enough is enough I won't take anymore
I'm picking myself up off the floor
'Cause you can't keep a good man down
You can't keep a good man down
Oh no you can't keep a good man down
Sugar you can't keep a good man down
Gonna dress up in my finest
Clothes that I own
And take it to the streets
I won't be lonely for long
Gonna put on my best moves
On every single woman I see
Now you thought you could break me
Add me to your list
Notch me on your gun
Let me tell you this
I've got news for you baby
I don't break that easily
'Cause you can't keep a good man down
You can't keep a good man down
Oh no you can't keep a good man down
Sugar you can't keep a good man down
I'll be out there on the scene
Hangin' with my friends
This world's gonna see
Me smilin' again
I'm taking some time
To erase you from my memory
Don't write any letters
Don't call me on the phone
Don't knock on my door
Cause to you I'm not at home
I know there's a woman out there
For a man like me
'Cause you can't keep a good man down
You can't keep a good man down
Oh no you can't keep a good man down
Sugar you can't keep a good man down
Oh enough is enough I won't take anymore
I'm picking myself up off the floor
'Cause you can't keep a good man down
Baby you can't keep a good man down
Honey you can't keep a good man down
Sugar you can't keep a good man down <start> Trippin' on the heart of the bad machine
Rippin' through the shreds of a lameo scene
Layin' out the rules whatcha gonna do
Two zero zero zero baby comin' for you

Just like a teenage freak
And I know I'm blazin' now I'm facin' shitty peak
And I'm dressed in gold
Gonna leave you cold
And I know I move it know I'm groovin' know I'm sold
No godammn' buzzin' I'm so tired of the fuzzin'
Got a pocket full of nothin' and I'm bound for you
It's just a homer and a way to be a loner I'm a legendary
Roamer and I'm comin' through
Gonna play the highest stakes
And I'll make it and you'll break
It's just an all or nothin' split
And I'm a gonna be the winner of it
Sold out on mercy I am sorry closin'shop

Little rock and roller yeah
All aboard come enjoy the ride
As the rock and roll circus comes around one more time
Hey little rock and roller
There is some good times up for grabs
It is such a pity
Your are stuck in anothers past
Hey little rock and roll
Play another number
Go bargain your soul
Living out the lie
Acting out this rotten roll <start> Why is it you must be so very cruel to me in order to be kind Why when I hold you close do you insist your toes are being stood on by mine Why when I kiss your lips do you astound me saying that you won't put your arms around me No one should be that cold Whatever I've done surely I've a right to know Oh why oh why oh why Why is it every time we visit friends of mine You never want to go Why when I'm feeling good you act as if I should be at an alltime low Why after all these years we've been together must you behave as if we'd hardly ever spoken let alone met It seems that you're happy as long as I'm upset Oh why oh why oh why Is it that you don't love me oh why Have you had enough of me Oh why Do I have cry myself to sleep Seven days a week la la la la la la...... Why in the name of God are you so angry Could It be that you can no longer stand me Tell me and I will go You're breaking my heart just in case you didn't know Oh why oh why oh why Oh why oh why oh why <start> Sweet dreams you can't resist

Six days we'll be away from here
We'll steal a car hijack a plane
I've been to Denver
 miles high
I didn't like it
And you know why
Deep down in New Orleans
We met with guns
Those people got a weird idea
Of what is fun
Six days maybe New Mexico
Or would it all just be the same
I've seen El Paso
Ain't goin' back
Spit across the border
And those brothers spit back
I loved it in Austin
I wanted to stay
Cheap rent and lone star beer
Lots a' places to play
Six days we'll be away from here
We'll steal a car hijack a plane
In just six days
In just six days
In just six days <start> Where do we go from here
And what in the world can make you mine
What in the world can make you mine
In my dreams I hold you near
Don't let the feelings pass us by this time
Let them pass us by this time
The feelings that we feel are black and white
How can we subside all that we're in life
All the memories that we share
All the answers they don't care
All the memories and every pain
It's an illusion
Still quite insane
What have we become
And what is real is the thing we feel
What is real is the thing we feel
We might be breathing still
As we open our eyes we watch it heal
Open our eyes and watch it heal
The only thing that makes us feel anything at all
Anything at all
Is what our dreams uphold
What our dreams uphold
All the memories that we share
All the answers they don't care
All the memories and every pain
It's an illusion
Still quite insane
The feelings that we feel are black and white
How can we subside all that we are in life
The feelings that we feel are black and white
How can we subside all that we're in life
All the memories that we share
All the answers they don't care
All the memories and every pain
It's an illusion
Still quite insane
All the memories that we share
All the answers they don't care
All the memories and every pain
It's an illusion
Still quite insane <start> ...you are fragile... <start> I'm the guy that dies at the beginning of the movie
I'm the one who never makes it out of the cave
It's because just when I have got everything going for me baby
You come around and take it all away
It's true I'll do anything for you
She asked if this is cool
I played it like a fool
It's like I've said before
I could die tonight for just one kiss more
On the brink bout to sink I'm drowning baby and I can't think
Of a way to pull myself back to shore
It's your face I can't take and my knees are about to buckle
The same way as they did the night you walked through my door
It's true I'll do anything for you
She asked if this is cool
I played it like a fool
It's like I've said before
I could die tonight for just one kiss more
Every time my eyes are closing there is just one word
Once it's spoken my eyes open and I'm yours to serve
When your world tries to blow itself up from the inside
I will dig a foxhole for two
So you know that I will always be there for you
And maybe you could find a love for me too
It's true I'll do anything for you
She asked if this is cool
I played it like a fool
It's like I've said before
I could die tonight for just one kiss more
One kiss more
Oh my darling my love
Just one just one just one <start> I think about you everyday
you're in my life
you put the wheels in motion
I'm just getting by
For you
I can't stop my heart breaking
You have gone away
And I will keep on dying
A little bit each day
Enter Tomorrow
Come with me
I got a way
I got a way <start> There's a secret I must tell
Of all the love I've found
And it's hidden in my heart
The day you tore my world apart
Hallelujah King forever friend and Saviour
Jesus' blood never fails me
Jesus' blood never fails me
Jesus' blood Jesus' blood
And this secret it will run
To the corners of the earth
Where every woman every son
Will carry high their chains undone
Hallelujah King forever friend and Saviour
Jesus' blood never fails me

Praise the God of heaven
Love that never fails me

My detective darling
My agent hasn't solved a case
My agent never finds a trace
But Charley has always style
Charley is always nice
Poor Charley
He would be nothing without me
Once I clear his memory
But he'll crash into a tree
Once we're getting to the place
Someone else has solved the case

Azules y blancas entre las cenizas
Las alas sin vida de vuelos suicida
Y yo las entiendo por que yo eh sentido
La luz cegadora de un fuego prohibido

Como se va enredando el cuento como se va torciendo el tiempo
Como te quedas ciego y es as y es as y es as
Como te vas metiendo tus propias mentiras

De frente contra el fuego como mariposa
Quien pudo ser tan loco para cambiar

His killing had no purpose
No reason or rhyme
Oh he was a friend of mine
He was in Dallas town
He was in Dallas town
From a sixth floor window
A gunman shot him down
Oh he died in Dallas town
He never knew my name
He never knew my name
Though I never met him
I knew him just the same
Oh he was a friend of mine
Leader of a nation for such a precious time
Oh he was a friend of mine <start> Did you ever have a dream or two
Where the hero is a guy named you
And the things he does are just too much
Does he fly like Mr. Superman speak Chinese French and Dutch
And did you ever have a dream or two
Have you ever woken up one day
With the feeling that you'd been away
If the girl that you dreamed of last night
Had the same dream in the very same scene
With the very same boy hold tight
It's a very special knowledge that you've got my friend
You can travel anywhere with anyone you care
It's a very special knowledge that you've got my friend
You can walk around in New York while you sleep in Penge
I will travel round the world one night
On the magic wings of astral flight
If you've got the secret tell me do
Have you ever had a dream or two
Have you ever had a dream or two <start> They say the neon lights are bright
On Broadway
They say there's always magic in the air
But when you're walkin' down that street
And you ain't have enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere
They say the women treat you fine
On Broadway
But lookin' at them just gives me the blues
How ya gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes
They say that I won't last too long
On Broadway
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home they all say
But they get wrong I know they are
'Cause I can play this here guitar
I won't quit till I'm a star
On Broadway

Christmas you feel it in the air
Better write all your letters to Santa
There's shopping and wrapping to do
I bet you'll never believe it
When you see what I got you
You're gonna love it
Christmas is just around the corner
Candles are glowing everywhere
Can't wait until that night reindeer appear
Christmas and it's just about here
Christmas is just around the corner
Christmas you feel it in the air
All the trees are surrounded with presents
The stockings are filling up too
I'll bet you'll never believe it
When you see what I got you
What did you get me
Christmas is just around the corner
Sleigh bells are ringing in the sled
Too bad December comes just once a year
Christmas time to trim the tree
Christmas can it really be
Christmas yes it's finally here <start> Life can be black and white
We need a little colour
That's what I'm searching for
It's like I'm driving blind
I need a little summer
I need to feel the world
The touch
The taste
I'm feeling all my senses going
off the way that you do
I'm off the flame
I finally got the messages in love
He's in love
It's like I'm burning alive
You are the fuel in my fire tonight
I'm burning alive
I've got a ticket to ride tonight

Her body lights the streets
Sometimes her beauty's blinding
I let her take my soul

To see just what's inside
This tree is dead and cold
This house is not a home
Help me now I'm dying here alone
This is not a new game
So don't think that you know
Casually I confide
Awake and paralysed
Forever in one word
Forever is the longest time
It's the only cure I'm not sure I'll survive
This is not a new game
So don't think that you know
Can you see these blood shot eyes
Can you see
That my strength is failing
And I can't go on this way

So my intentions are known
See I pity in watching you suffer
I know the feeling of feeling of being damned alone
I got a storybook of my own
Don't you see I am your pride
Agent of wealth
Bearer of needs
And you know it's right
I am your war
Arming the strong
Aiding the weak
Know me by name
Shepherd of fire
Well I can promise you paradise
No need to serve on your knees
And when you're lost in the darkest of hours
Take a moment and tell me who you see
Won't tell ya who not to be
Now you know I am your pride
Agent of wealth
Bearer of needs
And you know it's right
I am your war
Arming the strong
Aiding the weak
Know me by name
Shepherd of fire
Disciple of the cross and champion in suffering
Immerse yourself into the kingdom of redemption
Pardon your mind through the chains of the divine
Make way the shepherd of fire
Through the ages of time
I've been known for my hate
But I'm a dealer of simple choices
For me it's never too late
I am your pride
Agent of wealth
Bearer of needs
And you know it's right
'Cause I am your war
Arming the strong
Aiding the weak
I am your wrath
I am your guilt

I am your trust
Know me by name
Shepherd of fire <start> 
Oh you know her would you look at that hair
Yeah you know her check out those shoes
She looks like she stepped out of the middle of somebody's blues
She looks like the Sunday comics
She thinks she's Brenda Starr
Her nose job is real atomic
All she needs is an old knife scar
Yeah she's so dull come on rip her to shreds
She's so dull come on rip her to shreds
Oh you know her Miss Groupie Supreme
Yeah you know her Vera Vogue on parade
Red eye shadow Green mascara
Yuck She's too much
She looks like she don't know better
A case of partial extreme
Dressed in a Robert Hall sweater
Acting like a soap opera queen
Yeah she's so dull come on rip her to shreds
She's so dull come on rip her to shreds
She got the nerve to tell me she's not on it
But her expression is too serene
Yeah she looks like she washes with Comet
Always looking to create a scene
Yeah she's so dull come on rip her to shreds
She's so dull come on rip her to shreds
She's so dull rip her to shreds
Oh you know her Miss Groupie Supreme
Yeah you know her Vera Vogue on parade

Well bye bye sugar
And not a minute too soon <start> Flyin' sideways cause
I can't rely on me to
Get you there
Only one way
I could tell you not to stall
Antique is rare
Flyin' sideways
Cause it's the only way to get to
Where you're going
It's the same day
But I feel it callin' me
Instead I've flown
Flyin' sideways cause
I can't rely on me to
Get you there
Only one way
I could tell you not to stall
Antique is rare <start> Rewrite the book
chapter three will be empty
pure white and hidden in the shadows
one voice moving lips are absent whispers
design for the future
twisting steel frames cells glass walls
observation seating this room
will be full one day
on the rise
shoot when you see the pales of there eyes
climbing up to meet us to take us on
so place your arms back in the sockets for
rebuilding from our losses we wont be taken now
in the open windows smearing portrait across the view
reset the stopped watch two days behind
Did I sleep through it
consciousness takes control semi trucks and white dotted lines car stillin drive
just pull over park getting out to climb the fence
breaks skin falling down on dead leaf covered ground much softer forgiving
from much harder concrete sidewalks I just expected more
or did you forget Did you forget
this was no longer a dream those cold hands on your face
the ones sliding down to your neck and you wont miss the pressure of feet standing on your chest
but thats just how the body reacts when the tear is found
take notice of the trees climbing towards the whole in the sea above limbs have opened the sky
branches cartoon greeting
Thanks to Joe Wiederman  for these lyrics <start> To the wind she stood as her hair blew back
Testing the waters on a one way track
Through the dusk of a High Sierra Storybook
From an East Bay cradle not to mention cool
Oh I didn't see you as a thief
Oh but you stole my heart anyway
And brought me somewhere peaceful to die
In the wash and the wake of a fleeting thought
And you on my lap at  miles an hour
Cheating death eye to eye on her valley floor
Chasing suns to the West and on forever more
Oh I didn't see you as a thief
Oh but you stole my heart anyway
And brought me somewhere peaceful to die
I know you've got me spun round like this world
I'm on the floor begging for nothing more
Than you to understand I'm here to be your man
All in and all revved to drive you home
You home
You home
You home
You home
I know you've got me spun round like this world
Well I'm on the floor begging for nothing more
Than you to understand I'm here to be your man
All in and revved to drive you home
We're not the idle type
You know as well as I
We're thick as thieves on a destined ride <start> Sweet Marie there's a hole where your heart should be
And on the hill she's begging for a harmony
Sweet Marie there's a hole where your heart should be
And on the hill she's begging for a harmony
What beautiful lies you've been told
What terrible truths drown your soul
She hides behind all my lies
Oh you need to be loved
Oh you need to be loved
Oh you need all my love tonight  all my love
Sweet Marie how cold your body can be
And on the hill she's begging for a harmony
Such a beautiful kiss in the face of fear
Such a beautiful song burns through your ears
She hides behind all my lies
Oh you need to be loved
Oh you need to be loved
Oh you need all my love tonight  all my love
Oh you need to be loved
Oh you need to be loved
Oh you need to be loved
Oh you need <start> Hey diddle diddle here's a brand new riddle
What's shallow and cheap with a hole in the middle
Five fingers holding four wise angels
Little heads float by on clouds of goodness
They're playing voodoo with their Kylie dolls
Sing it right or don't sing it all <start> There are things that I'd like to say
But I'm never talking to you again
There's things I'd like to phrase some way
But I'm never talking to you again
I'm never talking to you again
I'm never talking to you
I'm tired of wasting all my time
Trying to talk to you
I'd put you down where you belong
But I'm never talking to you again
I'd show you everywhere you're wrong
But I'm never talking to you again <start> 

Hit git and split I'm coming back home to you
Hit git and split I'm coming back home to you
There's nobody here gonna take the place of you
I got the blues my baby's not here with me
I got the blues my baby's not here with me
She's a little bitty chick and I'm never gonna let her be
Hit git and split I'm coming back home to you
Hit git and split I'm coming back home to you
There's nobody here gonna take the place of you <start> On a lone and windy hilltop beneath a roof of tin
In a little wallpapered bedroom I done my growin'
'Twas there I dreamt my dreams I hung my jeans
And wandered through my puberty as all do
My mother was a tight nut bound up with false guilt
Strapped up in her fearing wall she had built
The independent girl in a dark and cruel world
She'd lost the way to say OK now lay back
We disagreed on most things I shouted peace and love
The family is mankind the symbol of the dove
She only saw the surface of things before her face
But I was young and argued on for hours
My father he liked poetry a scholar he might have made
Had nothing born a poor boy barefoot and underpaid
So the man worked with his hands up and down the land
His dreams forgot he thought that I must follow
With his marks as worker's wisdom he'd read a thing or two
He once had been a Mason but he never followed through
Always kind and thoughtful smelling of mushy oil
And he read me poetry of visionaries
I flunk my way to college a looser kind of school
But we bobbed and played time arty feeling cool
Just to live an artists diggin' the ravin' scene
Reading Kerouac and Ginsberg well deuced
I was not academic Art and English neat
The history of mankind I liked that a bit
And what was I to do The choices they were few
I done right disgrace to the working classes
I done right disgrace to the working classes
I done right disgrace to the working classes
I done right disgrace to the working classes <start> Sleep in now now.
Sleep in now now now.
It's still night out.
Sleep in.
Don't look at me
Looking back at you
Out the window backwards
Out the window backwards.
Sleep.
See this child twice stolen from me
Out the window backwards
Out the window backwards.
Sleep in now now.
Sleep in now now now.
Sleep now.
Now fall to the bed
Put your hand in your hair.
Now fall to the tile
Stick your finger in your eye.
That's the only way you cry.
Hey now.
Hey now.
Full moon pass the window sideways.
Hey now.
Hey now.
Sleep in now now.
Sleep in now now.
Sleep in now now.
Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. <start> For the last time
I watched Old Man Took bait his hook
And then throw his line
Pick up his wine
He's a friend of mine
Known him all my life and his wife
'Neath the swayin' pine
And the clingin' vine
Just before he left
He said now young man
Take good care don't let the bugs bite
Please make sure to say a word at night
For all your brothers feeling blue
Blue blue blue
All the time
So I stayed awhile
Took my tea alone called it home
Like a playing child
Running wild
Heard a bluejay call
Said we got you now
Hope you bow
To the old man's word
I'm sure you heard
Just before he left
He said now young man
Take good care don't let the bugs bite
Please make sure to say a word at night
For all your brothers feeling blue
Blue blue blue
All the time
Now young man
Take good care don't let the bugs bite
Please make sure to say a word at night
For all your brothers feeling blue
Feeling blue
Feeling blue
Feeling blue
Feeling blue
Feeling blue
Feeling blue
Feeling blue
Feeling blue .. <start> Like  till  love  point hit
All you had was your fist if it was in the grim
Some say they're ignorant
They leave a trail spend hard time in jail
And bang their girl through the mail
But now millennium where did the time go
And while the lines show now sit dressed up before Geraldo
Now if you've seen hard times you're not alone
 seven Hoboken upon your telephone
All my time is gone all my time is gone
So familiar I hear the music in my head
All my time is gone all my time is gone
So familiar I hear the music in my head
Now I got myself in with men of respect
I might get off easy or get a broken neck
But when they find me I'll give 'em hell
Not form but 'cause I never fail
Like rocky till the ring of bell
Hard times depression's curve
I think a lot about nouns but nothing in verbs
I wanna run you make me stay
I scured the edge of the map until I get out of range
All my time is gone all my time is gone
So familiar I hear the music in my head
All my time is gone all my time is gone
So familiar I hear the music in my head
All my time is gone all my time is gone
So familiar I hear the music in my head
All my time is gone all my time is gone
So familiar I hear the music in my head
All my time is gone all my time is gone
So familiar I hear the music in my head
All my time is gone all my time is gone
So familiar so familiar so familiar <start> Put the god badge down

There is no us or them
There's only folks that you do or don't understand
Unlock your heart

Love alone was yours to carry
You could lay your gavel down
You could lay your gavel down
Let him light your path
And love someone yeah

You're not the jury or the judge
Quit acting out the fear that you call love

Upon these ashes
In your fear
It will swallow the river that divides
There's no life in here at all
To seek this self decay
There's no life in here at all
To take these dreams away
This burning ever
Will conquer all you see
And this burning ever
Will bury your heart
There's no life in here at all
To seek this self decay
There's no life in here at all
To take these dreams away
So what are we all built upon
Soon fragile in decay
What are we all built upon
To take these dreams away
Why need a
Why need a new faith
When the old is still ok
Will you still
Will you still love this
As the interest in it fades away
As it fades away
As the interest in it fades away
It fades away
The interest in it fades away <start> Stones thrown
Windows broken
Tombstones have growna family tree
Around my feet
Paint a picture
Coloured red and blistered at hte seams
And you'll see me
Darker days
That's what I love
That's what I love
Darker days
That's what I love
That's what I love
That's what I love
Blown to pieces
Winter blooms and freezes down in me
What does it mean
When I love the thunder as I'm going under
The sea again
It starts to fold and swallow
Darker days

You know I gave it I gave it I gave it all I got
Oh oh oh the years have flown by

Get back on you're feet there's a fire in your heart
You've got to live it live it give it what you've got

For a moment
You're my one and only friend
Watch the sun set
From your sedan
Let your hand
Rest on mine
I've lived in every town
But here is where I find home
My mind is open
And my body is yours
Show me the sign
I was so sure
I was fourteen
And not able to lie
But then you
Crept up on me
While I was dreaming
Whispered love into my ears
I've lived in every town
But here is where I find home
My mind is open
And my body is yours
Show me the sign
If you're tired
I can drive us.
We can go back
To my place
My mind is open
And my body is yours
Show me the sign
My mind is open
My mind is open
Show me the sign
Please <start> Meill' on viime aikoina

It's meant to be you can't change fate.
We got a time bomb ..
..  go
The time will come when we gotta say no.
Decide ourselves who's friend or foe.
It's in our hands above your head.
Think carefully or you'll be dead. <start> the course with its gray lanes my body feels to tense
from the lake to the mountaintop takes forever on icy roads
we ain't saying nothing.we're starying at the clouds with tired eyes
too many hours like these messes up everything
and her picture before my eyes stuck somewhere in between
we're doing nothing but staring at the clouds
trapped with each other and the car around
we're shutting each other out with tired eyes
the landscape is beautiful horses are pitiful
and her picture before my eyes won't let go no matter how i try
and i ain't doing nothing but staring at the clouds
so lonesome in this crowd we're shutting each other out <start> I ain't got nobody since she left me.
And I don't know why but I'm startin' to cry.
I ain't got nobody since she left me.
And I can't figure out how I'm gonna' get by.
I ain't got nobody since she left me.
I don't know why I been down all season
I ain't got nobody since she left me.
'cause there ain't no reason for the girl to be leavin' me.
Chorus
I don't know how I'll ever get by without you.
Nobody no ... nobody.
I'm startin' to realize my fate.
Nobody no ... nobody.
I'm ready to make up and give another try to live with you.
Nobody no ... nobody.
I hope for our love and us it's not too late ... too late.
Nobody nobody.
I ain't got nobody since she left me.
Oh and I don't really think that she'll ever come back.
I ain't got nobody since she left me.
If she don't come back I'll have a love attack.
I ain't got nobody since she left me.
And my tears are like rain fallin' down on my face.
I ain't got nobody since she left me.
'cause I know she's the girl that I'll never replace.
Chorus <start>  Decline <start> I'm watching the rain clouds in the sky roll in
I'm sick of these red pills sick of the dealer's grin
Daniel Daniel by the bonfires
On the telephone wire she's callin' you sayin'
Hey I got a lotta love to give
You walked up to me and said did I make a mistake
I feel so naked I could use a twist of fate
There's a sermon that I heard the other day
Confused me so I looked the other way
I'm watchin' you now with a whole lotta love to give
I'm half crazy eyes are heavy
If I can't be with you I would much rather be very dead
Please don't break it could you make it
Into something that fits into your very pretty head
Oh I'm half crazy eyes are heavy
If I can't be with you I would much rather be very dead
Please don't break it ah could you make it
Into something that fits into your very pretty head <start> Dear Matthew I like you a lot I realize you're in a relationship
With someone right now and I respect
That I would like you to know that if you're ever single
In the future and you want to come visit me in California
I would be open to spending time with you and finding
Out how old you were when you wrote your first song
Dear Jonathan I liked you too much I used to be attracted to boys
Who would lie to me and think solely about themselves and you
Were plenty selfdestructive for my taste at the time I used to say
The more tragic the better the truth is whenever I think of the early 's
Your face comes up with a vengeance like it was yesterday
Dear Terrance I love you muchly you've been nothing
But open hearted and emotionally available and supportive
And nurturing and consummately there for me I kept drawing you in
And pushing you away I remember how beautiful it was to fall asleep
On your couch and cry in front of you for the first time you
Were the best platform from which to jump beyond myself what
Was wrong with me
Dear Marcus you rocked my world you had a charismatic way
About you with the women and you got me
Seriously thinking about spirituality and you wouldn't let me get away
With kicking my own ass but I could never really feel relaxed and looked out
For around you though and that stopped us from going any further
Than we did and it's kinda too bad because we could've had much more fun <start> Chorus x

Racquet's <start> As I was awalking along Radcliffe highway
A recruiting party came abeating my way
They enlisted me and treated me 'til I did not know
And to the Queen's barracks they forced me to go
When first I deserted I thought myself free
Until my cruel comrade informed against me
I was quickly followed after and brought back with speed
I was handcuffed and guarded heavy irons put on me
Court martial court martial they held upon me
And the sentence passed upon me three hundred and three
May the Lord have mercy on them for their sad cruelty
For now the Queen's duty lies heavy on me
When next I deserted I thought myself free
Until my cruel sweetheart informed against me
I was quickly followed after and brought back with speed
I was handcuffed and guarded heavy irons put on me
Court martial court martial then quickly was got
And the sentence passed upon me that I was to be shot
May the Lord have mercy on them for their sad cruelty
For now the Queen's duty lies heavy on me
Then up rode Prince Albert in his carriage and six
Saying Where is that young man whose coffin is fixed
Set him free from his irons and let him go free
For he'll make a good soldier for his Queen and country <start> Everybody's got addictions
For me its gotta be you
So slip in to something that don't take long
And slip in and bring me those baby blues
Elderodo shined up gotta little extra cash
And a quarter tank of premium
Lets see how long it lasts
Baby jump in my Cadillac
Slide in the middle or climb in the back
We can dance all over the fm dot
Sweet home country destiny's child
Light turns red light turns green
Sneak a little something in between
Steering wheel is steady when you're ready girl
We can put a new spin on these wheels
Tip a little old mill I kick back
Talkin' bout how damn good it feels
Street lights glowing
Slow rollin' this town with you
I can already hear you singing
I can already see your smile
With fortyfour leanin' on the door
Kick back crusin' down dine and shore
I pass the dollar general
Down to the end of the strip
Make a youie hang a louie
Feel that automatic shift
Baby jump in my Cadillac
Slide in the middle or climb in the back
We can dance all over the fm dot
Sweet home country destiny's child
Light turns red light turns green
Sneak a little something in between
Steering wheel is steady when you're ready girl
We can put a new spin on these wheels
Tip a little old mill I kick back
Talkin' bout how damn good it feels
Street lights glowin
Slow rollin' this town with you
We can put a new spin on these wheels
Tip a little old mill I kick back
Talkin' bout how damn good it feels
Street lights glowin'
Slow rollin' this town with you
Baby jump in my Cadillac
Slide in the middle or climb in the back
We can dance all over the fm dot
Sweet home country destiny's child
Light turns red light turns green
Sneak a little something in between
Steering wheel is steady when you're ready girl <start> Be gone
Be gone
Be gone your olden ways be gone
Don't be afraid of anyone
Like seasons just move on
Aorta liver ventricles
And other winter vehicles
From indigo to crystalline
You've one more chance so get it right
Oh Floreal
Oh guillotine
Oh Floreal
I love your iridescent sheen
As it reflects you and reflects me
Oh don't believe all of your golden memories
They're little more than makebelieve
So listen carefully
Agonic lines ascendances and amatory tendencies
From here to heart arrhythmias
Oh don't you know we're not like this
Oh Floreal
Oh guillotine
Oh Floreal
I love your iridescent sheen
As it reflects you and it reflects me
Oh Floreal
Oh guillotine
Oh Floreal
I love your iridescent sheen
As it reflects you and reflects me <start> I'm leaning on a rail
Letting my eyes roam over the plain
I'm laughing on my break
Feeling like a captive on a long chain
Watch the people pick up sticks
Big boss man cracks his whip
It's serious but we laugh to keep from crying
Spouting out the company line
Everything here's just fine
He says he cares about me but he's lying
Up up in the big house
The king of the hill.
I'm watching the boss man
Talking to his sister with the dirty hands
They sit cussing at the rules
Wishing they could lose me as fast as they can
He's got me in the roughest rig
He thinks I took his brother's gig
People say they've got the game rigged
His daddy gave him everything
A job and a house and his earring
Why does he think that I'm so threatening so bad
And up up in the big house
King of the hill
And there driving the big cat king of the hill
I'm over in my space
Swatting bugs sweat stains rolling down my face
I'm trying not to drink
Knowing I've got to roll out of this place
Watch the people pick up bricks
King of the hill with his nightstick
Caught up in accounting tricks
Throw a bone to the poor hicks
Got some candy take a lick
Great white hope shooting bricks
Time to let us all share the wealth
Getting coffee for the big stick
Hand in his pants at the skin flick
Lots of poisons take your pick
Mama mama mama come quick
Felling like I'm getting sick
Have you noticeed any nervous tics
Think I'd better take care of myself
And up up in the big house
King of the hill
And there driving the big cat
King of the hill <start> INTRO CRAW
Shout out to all my people in the struggle man
Chasing them demons or letting um chase you
Ay yo ay yo
VERSE  CRAW
Can I get a cigarette Let me get a hit of that
Let me burn my mother fucking lung till the shit is black
Crazy with the tongue since I was sipping Similac
Baby with the gums bumping one to the limit nah
It's unidentified when if I get inspired what I might do
Let me take ya'll back to high school
About six of those and I'll take six of those
Oxy's Perc's Vic's and I'll mix um yo
Never gave a fuck walk to the bus stop
Light up in the bathroom I'm yelling fuck cops
Stop the plot I rock like a crack head
No literally I'm in the garage with a crack head
Debating god while the homie catch a nod from the smack yet
I never questioned what happened
Fuck it keep moving you got to run from this
You got to leave you got a need to be numb to this
CHORUS CRAW
Who got the dollar bill Who got the pipe
Who got to go and who got the light uh
I got a void to fill before I come back
So I'ma smoke this shit 'till my lungs black
Who got the dollar bill Who got the pipe
Who got to go and who got the light uh
I got a void to fill before I come back
So I'ma smoke this shit 'till my lungs black
VERSE  CRAW
I'm a doctor weighing out my medication
Exterminator here to poison all the better days and
I swear to god god put me here to die young
So much dope my arm's worth more than Cy Young
What if I run Who you kidding
Lived my life in this figurative prison
Giving division a different name when you literally living
Like a pimple on the asshole of an epiphany's pigeon
Hold up I need a minute
Ah fuck it voices in my head are back
I forgot to tell um that I done been to hell and back
Got clean relapsed and got clean again
Never took the time to fly free within
So excuse me if I'm likely to sin
But I don't think you understand that Mike needs an end
To this madness so let's pretend it could happen
CHORUS X CRAW
VERSE  KUB
Off and running me first trip
Tugging with a heartstring
Love of a dark fling famous
Cost be stunning tha curse rich
Thugging with a tall swing
Cuddle a shark  king painless
Beast be walking about
He's been waiting to pounce
Tears in crazy amounts
Beat  shit taking me out
I fought only thing be winning the fight
And so I've lost what could have been love unlike
I recognize no man in the mirror
The microphone tone demand that I speak clear
Tonight when I go home gonna stand to defeat fear
For I've been a lone stone planting my feet here
Harder the dream seem to be achieved and next chapter
Part of the routine I fiend flipping the page after
All of what I've seen as things have been taken faster
Take my soul and being but please leave me my laughter
I'm asking...
CHORUS X CRAW <start> Etwas an deiner Art zu gehen
berhrt mich wie bei keiner Ander'n.
Etwas an der Art zu verfhren

Etwas an der Art beweist mir

All dies lsst mich deutlich spren

He's get all the women
We'd go kick it at the bar
But his drinkin' went too far
He could see over his belt
The brotha was slim and svelte
But the gut snuck up while he wasn't lookin'
And the beer stood firm within
Beergut  gettin' in the way of things
Beergut  no longer can he see his nuts
Beergut  he will keep drinkin' till he throws up
He's got the dunlap disease
His gut is troubled trapped
When his gut lap over his belt buckle
When he chuckle it pinch the belt buckle
My hommie's arms and legs are thin
His gut is filled with heineken
 ounce chugalugs of old english saint ides budweiser
Beergut  gettin' in the way of things
Beergut  no longer can he see his nuts
Beergut  he will keep drinkin' till he throws up
Then we leave from the bar
We go to the homestead
Get a six pack and turn on the tv
Roll a joint and toke it to the head
Then when the munchies take over
We will raid the convenience store
Grubbin' and scarfin' and fucked up
And the beergut grows some more
Beergut  gettin' in the way of things
Beergut  no longer can he see his nuts
Beergut  he will keep drinkin' till he throws up <start> Bob's on the radio
I'm talking to the ghost of StevieRay
Down by the windmill
And Mr Tambourine man stand up and sing a little
I don't care what your mamma's done or what you're doing here
I'm in this game to save my soul
And I changed my name and I changed everything I am....
I wanna die I wanna die just like James Dean
Things are moving me I'm always stopping and
Things are different things change and I don't know why
I've been flying down the highway .... who's gonna put a stop to me
I'm on the radio
Everyone's gathered round getting down to the fireside
I wanna stand up and say something beautiful
I don't care what you did to get where you are
I never asked you where you're coming from
Did I now I don't think so
I changed my face and I changed everything I am
I wanna die I wanna die just like James Dean
Things are different and things change
I wanna die just like James Dean
I've been flying down the highway .... who's gonna put a stop to me
So bye bye baby I wanna stick around but I can never stay
And bye bye baby I wanna last forever but I can never go that way...
Everyone's on the radio
Everybody gets up and sings their silly songs
And all I wanted was to dance like a king on the TV
I don't care what I have to do  to get there
All that I ever wanted was to save my soul and
I changed my hair and I don't wanna disappear
I don't wanna fade away before I can stand and face myself again
I wanna die I wanna die just like James Dean
Things are different and things change
I wanna die just like James Dean
I've been flying down the highway .... who's gonna put a stop to me <start> Why don't we live together
Only the two of us we'll learn to trust
Don't have to say forever
'Cause we know the rain could start and break our hearts
But we'll never find the future if we hesitate
We'll spend our lives waiting
Why don't we live together
Taking it day by day we'll find a way
To build us a dream that's better
And still have our wings to fly if love should die
We can't spend our lives rehearsing all these lines of love
It's time to raise the curtain
Ho why don't we live together
Whether love lives or dies at least we'll know we tried
We've both been burned before
But now we know this love is sure
And there'll be no more sorrow
This love is burnin' bright it lights up tomorrow
Why don't we live together
Takin' life's rocky ride side by side
Sailin' through stormy weather
Searchin' for sunny skies with open eyes
Sharin' the tears and the laughter
Is the only way we'll find the love we're after
Oh why don't we live together
Whether love lives or dies at least we'll know we tried
Why don't we live together
Whether love lives or dies at least we'll know we tried
Why don't we live together
Whether love lives or dies lets take a chance let's try
Why don't we live together <start> I one eye
I one eye
Why am I here
Why am I here
I don't care
I wild
Sit back down
Sit back down
Sit back down cos I said so
You're so stupid
I would have done anything for you
Honey your reputation is shit in this town
I one
She's sassy
She's walking tall <start>

You tried so hard to please me you have me on your list
Just one more heart to play with I know that you tried your best
Well I'm not the kind to take it I'll turn I'll walk away
Cause you cast your spell upon me but things won't stay this way
I try to love you I try to make you see
But everytime I turn around you're walking out on me
I can't take it no more I say
You're too hot  I've got my hands full
You're so hot  too hot to handle
It's so tough  there's nothin' left to try
I have a thing for your love but we've both had enough
Because you're too hot to handle
They told me all about you that I'd better watch my step
I've had a lot of girlfriends but no one like you yet
I wanna be the only one you say that you want the same
But you're much too restless for me girl I'm tired of playin' games
The change surrounds you can't you see it's all around you
I know I can't take a chance I won't go again
I can't take it no more I say
You're too hot  I've got my hands full
You're so hot  too hot to handle
It's so rough  there's nothin' left to try
I have a thing for your love but we've both had enough
Because you're too hot to handle
Your eyes they dance with fire the flames just tease the soul
Your eyes concede a passion girl but the blood in your heart runs cold
I say I'm not gonna waste my time I don't want you on my mind
I said it's over now we're through I won't waste my time no more with you
I try to love you I try to make you see
But everytime I turn around you're walking out on me
I can't take it no more I say
You're too hot  I've got my hands full
You're so tough  too hot to handle
It's so rough  there's nothin' left to try
I had a thing for your love but we've both had enough
Because you're too hot to handle  you're much too hot for me
You're too hot  I can feel it girl much too lazy 
This boy is gone it's time to run girl you're too hot 
You're much too hot for me can't you see you're 
I've had enough gonna walk away now <start> Donald Swan he was a millionaire
>From a Texas oil family
But he still worked hard and believed in God
He was a man of integrity
He went to France on business
Met a woman there named Simone
She saw love in the eyes of the American guy
And she didn't like to be alone

Now it's a cow town
It's a cow town
For Simone Swann
Living on the Buffalo Bayou
She packed up all her perfume
For the gusty pioneer
On a carefree note he said Forget your coat
There's a chill about every ten years
So they flew hand in hand to Houston
Home of Exxon Gulf and Shell
He said we have an income bigger than France
We all think that's swell
He loved her French accent
And her knowledge of the arts
And she for one had always fancied
Having a millionaire sweetheart
So they got married up in Dripping Springs
Flew her Mama in from Cannes
She said What kind of romance could make
My baby leave France
Donald must be some kind of Don Juan
Now she thinks about France and the nightlife there
And it's cafes and bistros
Donald a hard working simple man
Likes to see the livestock shows
And when he's not off on business
He's off checkin' out cows and pigs
And she gets weary on a twelve mile prairie
Starin' at the drilling rigs
Now it's a cow town
It's a cow town
For Simone Swann
Living on the Buffalo Bayou <start> I woke up and Mary was still gone
Thought if I stopped hurting she would come back to me.
Walk right through the door and say Ah ha
I was only joking didn't you look silly crying.
But I wake up and Mary is still gone.
I looked at the clock and it was still
Lying on the floor exactly where I threw it
Both hands smashed against its silver face.
My feeble attempt to stop time but time goes on
And wake up and Mary is still gone.
Mary was it necessary
To leave before the party
I know its selfish to say
You always brought the cake now
What will I eat with all these tears
I looked at the list and saw her name
Kid myself she never got an invitation
Kid myself I'm sure somehow she knew
My stupid attempt to find some way to move on
But I wake up and Mary is still gone. <start> You'll never get her in the back seat of your car
She'll never ride on that motorcycle
She'll never hang out on the Sunset Strip with you man
Or anyone anyone
She says no no no I won't do that
No no no I can't do that
I'm not that kind of girl
Chorus
She's too nice
She's too nice for that
She's too nice to do those things
That you want her to do
She'll never put that outfit on for you man
She'll never let you put it on either
She'll make you feel that you're so damn sleazy
Just for bringing it up
So don't you bring it up
She says no no no I won't do that
No no no I can't do that
I'm not that kind of girl
Chorus <start> You get the car I'll get the night off
You'll get the chance to take the world apart
And figure out how it works
Don't let me know what you find out
I need a car you need a guide who needs a map
If I don't die or worse I'm gonna need a nap
At best I'll be asleep when you get back
I wanna see it when you find out what comets stars and moons are all about
I wanna see their faces turn to backs of heads and slowly get smaller
I wanna see it now
I wanna see it now
I want specifics on the general idea
I wanna think what I should know
I want you to do me what to show
I wanna see the movies of my dreams
I wanna see the movies of my dreams
I wanna see the movies of my dreams
I wanna see the movies of my dreams
I wanna see it when you get stoned on a cloudy breezy desert afternoon
I wanna see it untame itself and break its owner
I wanna see it now
I wanna see it now <start> I saw you walking up the wall
Like the exorcist
When you saw me there you called
Can you spare a fifth
I used to know you when you were small
How's it come to this
How does a happy bright boy
Fall into the rift
And you carry weight on your shoulders
Won't you see that you are not inside yourself
You put that evil back inside yourself
I saw your Ma the other day
She asked me how you were
Say 'one day you you'll be fine
But now you do it worse'
She told as she cried that
'No one breaks the curse'
As I looked into her eyes
My heart it nearly burst
And you carry weight on your shoulders
Won't you see that you are not inside yourself
You put that evil back inside yourself
And what if you breathe and see you're good
And what if you reach out knock on wood
I'm begging you please won't you be understood
And won't you release I believe you could
And if you ever wanna dream
I'll help you see the sky
And if you ever wanna scream
About some reason why
And if you ever break the seam
That cuts through your disguise
I love you when you're seen
And do my best to try
To carry weight off your shoulders
Won't you see that you are not here by yourself
Please don't put that evil back inside yourself
And what if you breathe and see you're good
And what if you reach out knock on wood
I'm begging you please won't you be understood
And won't you release I believe you could
And what if you breathe and see you're good
And what if you reach out knock on wood
I'm begging you please won't you be understood
And won't you release I believe you could <start> Down on video street
Night hearts beat
Where the fever's burning on
So come on
Just be my sis
One last kiss
Cause our lips are made with glass
They're ready to broadcast rebel trash
But if you wait too long
Keep telling yourself
That moment has already passed
You're gonna miss that song
You might never meet that girl
Then you blink oh
And that night is over too fast
You're making love to the past
Kid the love that we got
The light we're on
Burns bright tonight come on
We belong to something we feel
But we never can see
Do you know that we're always free
That's how we're supposed to be
But if you wait too long
Keep telling yourself
That moment has already passed
You might miss that song
You may never meet that girl
Then you blink oh
And that night is over too fast
Well don't you want it to last
Oh the sun is going down
The night is coming round
There ain't a single sight nor sound
And oh the feeling's coming on
The city lights are gone
The fever's gonna stay till dawn
Oh whoa whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa oh
Do you love her
Do you wonder
Why the star ship shines above
Do you love her
Do you want her
Have you ever had enough
Do you love her
Do you wonder
Why the star ship shines above
Do you love her
Do you want her
Have you ever had enough
Do you love her
Do you wonder
Why the star ship shines above
Do you love her
Do you want her
Have you ever had enough
Do you love her
Do you wonder
Why the star ship shines above
Do you love her
Do you want her
Will you ever have enough <start> She got high on lovin'
Sorry but I'm passing through
Maybe I got a toothpick
In the bottom of my walkin' shoes
This ain't a town for tear drops
Or tattoo regrets
Nah yeah
Sneakin' out the back way
In the middle of a starry night
Ain't gonna be remembered
For all the things that I did right
Can't say I need you can't say I don't
But I won't
Chorus
And no need to miss me when I'm gone
And no need to miss me when I'm gone
And no need to miss me when I'm gone
And no need to miss me when I'm gone
I wouldn't have very long <start> Float from the balcony
We ride the pine top swells
Down from the old hotel
On the lake of Silver Bells
Leading is lonely
When you make alone decisions
Leading is lonely
When you're dancing through derisions
So much left for giving
In the year of living dangerously happy
On the lake of Silver Bells
Light flickers by
A hundred suns behind the trees
Melts us in a lullaby
Our eyelids are like movie screens
And we close our eyes
And feel the warmth come into frame
We close our eyes
Until our dreams become one and the same
So much left for giving
In the year of living dangerously happy
On the lake of Silver Bells
We dance across till we drop
The bells keep time and never stop
We sleep and we wake
To muffled chimes out on the lake
We dance across till we drop
The bells keep time and never stop
We sleep and we wake
On the lake of Silver Bells
We've reached a secret place
To rest and reconcile
We close our eyes
The only change is no change for a while
We'll buy the old hotel
And we will make this place our own
And fill each room with sons and daughters
And never be alone
We dance across till we drop
The bells keep time and never stop
We sleep and we wake
To muffled chimes out on the lake
We dance across till we drop
The bells keep time and never stop
We sleep and we wake
On the lake of Silver Bells
Looking passed the love you face
You miss the place you never had
But what you need's not just the dream
But something on the other end
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.
You're much too fast asleep
We dance across till we drop
The bells keep time and never stop
We sleep and we wake
To muffled chimes out on the lake
We dance across till we drop
The bells keep time and never stop
We sleep and we wake
On the lake of Silver Bells
The lake of Silver Bells
The lake of Silver Bells
The lake of Silver Bells <start> Keep on keep on doing it
Right on right on doing it
Baby keep on
Right on
Keep on doing it
Now my baby keep on
Keep on keep on
Wherever wherever girl I'll do it
Forever and ever yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'll see you through it
I've got to keep you pleased
In every way I can
Gonna give you all of me
As much as you can stand
Make love to you right now
That's all I want to do
I know you need it girl
And you know I need it too
'Cause I found
What the world is searching for
Here right here my dear
I don't have to look no more
And oh my babe
I hoped and I prayed
For someone just like you
To make me feel the way you do
I'm never never gonna give ya up
I'm never ever gonna stop
Not the way I feel about you
Girl I just can't live without you
I'm never ever gonna quit
'Cause quittin' just ain't my shtick
I'm gonna stay right here with you
Do all the things you want me to
Whatever you want
Girl you got it
And whatever you need
I don't want to see you without it
You've given me much more
Than words could ever say
And oh my dear I'll be right here
Until my dying day
I don't know just how to say
All the things I feel
I just know that I love you so
And it gives me such a thrill
'Cause I found
What this world is searching for
Here right here my dear
I don't have to look no more
And all of my days
I hoped and I prayed
For someone just like you
To make me feel the way you do
I'm never never gonna give ya up
I'm never ever gonna stop
Stop the way I feel about you
Girl I just can't live without you
I'm never ever gonna quit
'Cause quittin' just ain't my shtick
I'm gonna stay right here with you
Do all the things you want me to
Oh I'm never gonna give ya up
I'm never ever gonna stop
All the things I feel about you
Girl I just can't live without you
I'm never ever gonna quit
'Cause quittin' just ain't my shtick <start> you could send me a saviour
that lives 'til the end of time
promise the heavens
but that only leaves me dry
too many saviours
fuck with me
i won't die
i've never cried
but i needed more from you
i've found my life
without you now
and i'd never mind
i'm only half as blind
'cause i needed more
from you
you say my reflection
never fades from your eyes
could change my direction
but what i feel can't
disguise my reflection
crushing me
i won't die
i've never cried
but i needed more from you
i've found my life
without you now
and i'd never mind
i'm only half as blind
'cause i needed more
from you <start> I
I wonder why I wonder why
I've
I've come undone
Stay with me lord
Play with me
O.K. I know I missed it
The point I mean I missed it good
And if I could
Good God I would
Stay with me lord
Play with me
Now I've seen the way it's headed
Down and down the truth descended
Have it here and without worry
Baby please there is no hurry
I'm fine
Stay with me
Play with me
Ego it's only a soul
Now I see the way I'm headed
Down and down the youth descended
Hell is here but it hath no fury
Like this woman still there is no worry
I'm fine
Stay with me
Play with me
Without warning brain is burning <start> Don't give up I know you can see
All the world and the mess that we're making
Can't give up and hope God will intercede
Come on back imagine that we could get it together
Stand up for what we need to be
'Cause crime won't save or feed a hungry child
Can't lay down and hope a miracle will change things
So lift up your eyes lift up your heart
Singing mercy will we overcome this
Oh one by one could we turn it around
Maybe carry on just a little bit longer
And I'll try to give you what you need
Me and you and you and you just wanna be free
But you see all the world is just as we've made it
And until we got a new world I've got to say
That love is not a whisper or a weakness
No love is strong so we got to get together
Yeah gotta get gotta get gotta get
'Til there is no reason to fight
Mercy will we overcome this
Oh one by one could we turn it around
Maybe carry on just a little bit longer
And I'll try to give you what you need
Mercy will we overcome this
Have we come too far to turn it around
Ask too much to be a little bit stronger
But I wanna give you what you need
Mercy what will become of us
Oh one by one could we turn it around
Maybe carry on just a little bit longer
And I'll try to give you what you need <start> I feel like I need to apologise
For all the pain I've caused you guys
I never even tried to make it right
It seems that all we do is fight
Maybe one day this will change a family again
I was responsible
For your breakdown and all the hospital calls
It's so hard seeing someone that you love
Fall apart before your eyes when you can't help them get back up
So I'm passing this along
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything I've done
Maybe some day I might be able to tell you this
Without having to hide it in the lyrics of a song
I held you in my arms as you cried
Then you looked at me and said Nick I want to die
Well these arn't the words a son's supposed to hear
From his own mother because deep down she thinks I never cared
You were always there for me I know
And I believe you when you say it's hard to let go
Hard to let go of me
Watching me self destruct with such ease
Depression is the cause this sick disease is killing me
Disease is killing me
So let's let by gones be
And no matter what happens I know you'll love me
And that's all I need
So I'm passing this along
To tell you I'm sorry for everything I've done
Maybe some day I might be able to tell you this
Without having to hide it in the lyrics of a song <start> Joy to the world the Lord is come
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart
Prepare Him room
And Heaven and nature sing
And Heaven and nature sing
And Heaven and Heaven and nature sing
Joy to the world the Savior reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods
Rocks hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat repeat the sounding joy
He rules the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations proof
The glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love
And wonders of His love
And wonders wonders of His love
And wonders wonders of His love <start> Baby I'm through runnin' it's true
I'd be a fool to try to escape you
Maybe I'm beat but oh what a sweet surrender
You keep your rights I'll take your nights
No one can lose when we turn the lights out
Tastin' defeat lovin' that sweet surrender
I'm givin' up myself to you but I didn't really lose at all
I gave the only love I've known and it never hurt me to fall
Now that it's done so glad you won
I know our lives have only begun now
No more retreat only my sweet surrender <start> Well it's hard to be lonely
Feeling everyone is down on you
It's hard to be lonely
Feeling everyone is down on you
And you find out later on
That they care so much for you
And you know it's hard to believe
The condition the world is in
Yeah it's hard to believe
The condition the world is in
Cause you get no way
You can't trust nobody
And every girl you know is insane
And no need to worry
One day things will come your way
And no need to worry
One day things will come your way <start> Stillborn children. Saturn's children the living dead
We have created this abyss darkness surrounding us
Raise the flag of hate against this human race
Rise and kill  wipe them all away....
I Am Nothing
I Mean Nothing
I See Nothing
I Feel Nothing...as I kill you
We the Old Ones did not forget
We are the Supercoven we wait with bated breath
They think themselves as Gods ..now are they free
Mindless slaves to their lusts and technology
I Am Nothing
I Mean Nothing
I See Nothing
I Feel Nothing....as I kill you <start> Well its been building up inside of me
For oh I don't know how long
I don't know why
But I keep thinking
Something's bound to go wrong
But she looks in my eyes
And makes me realize
And she says Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Everything will turn out alright
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
I guess I should've kept my mouth shut
When I started to brag about my car
But I can't back down now because
I pushed the other guys too far
She makes me come alive
And makes me want to drive
When she says Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Everything will turn out alright
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
She told me Baby when you race today
Just take along my love with you
And if you knew how much I loved you
Baby nothing could go wrong with you
Oh what she does to me
When she makes love to me
And she says Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Everything will turn out alright
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby <start> It's not the way you smile that touched my heart
It's not the way you kissed that tears me apart
Oh oh ohh many many many nights go by
I sit alone at home and I cry over you
What can I do
Can't help myself myself
'Cause baby it's you
Baby it's you 
You should hear what they say about you 
They say you've never ever never been true 
Oh oh oh it doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do
When it's true
Don't want nobody nobody
Oh baby it's you
Baby it's you


Oh ohh it doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do
When it's true
I don't want nobody nobody
Oh oh baby it's you
Baby it's you
Don't leave me alone
Come on home
Baby it's you 
Baby it's you 
Baby it's you 
Only you  <start> Hello my friend
It's good to know you're looking after me
On this day I'll plummet to the sea
In my next life will you keep me warm
Listen when I tell you sun the reasons are so clear
The irony is that no one is here
When you're by my side I've got all my friends
But veracity gives me a tender glimpse and then I'm left with nothing
Goodbye my friend
I'm glad I got to share this world with you
Our affinity is now through
In your next life can I keep you warm
Keep you warm
Listen when I tell you sun the reasons are so clear
The irony is that no one is here
When you're by my side I've got all my friends
But veracity gives me a tender glimpse and then I'm left with nothing <start> Djate llevar
por la locura de un beso.
Djate atrapar
por el dulce de un te quiero.
Deja la pasin
abrazar todo tu cuerpo.
Lleva el corazn
lleva el corazn
en tu mano siempre abierto.
Djate llevar
cuando ames en silencio.
Dejte engaar
por lo bonito de un cuento.
Toma el desamor
y llvalo mar adentro.
Trata de olvidar
trata de olvidar
a quien te enga primero
Estribillo
Djate llevar
que la vida pronto pasa.
Djate llevar
o la vida se te escapa.
Y mirame a m
y mrame a m
que hace poco te perd
y como si nada.
Dejate llevar
al lugar de una sonrisa.
Djate engaar
por una buena mentira.
Deja de llorar
por quien no vale la pena.
Y ponte a cantar
y ponte a cantar
porque no hay mal
que por bien no venga.
Estribillo.
Y mirame a m
y mrame a m
que hace poco te perd
y no me ha pasado nada. <start> Seems like another wasted day.
Sometimes I think I think too much.
Or my heart just seems to run away
I thought of you i thought of you
FUCK THE WHOLE WORLD
I just want to sit and cry tonite in the arms that make me happy.
I never thought a smile could my life what a pretty girl on such a
cloudy day.
And i dont care about anything.
Every night I make a wish that i'll see you tomorrow.
Sugar.
Never tasted anything so sweet.
Never felt something so beautiful.
This ugly world needs more beauty like yours.
My star.

Find out why <start> Trying to beat the traffic
Meet the train
Only guessing the time I'd arrive
A game of chance to make it
'Scuse the habit of always being late
Sorry again mate
Does it make a difference an hour in bed
What was it I said that helps to forget about
Can I afford another day on my own
Sat in the kitchen with the radio on <start> I was once a boy in love with strangers
As I watched them smoke their cigarettes I'd wave
I was much too young to think of danger
I was curious and innocent and brave
Now the wrinkles in my face have gotten deeper
I'm an old man that's just  years young
I try to keep myself away from mirrors
They remind me of the stupid things I've done
Cause after all mans intellect and power
All you get is   hours
If you're lucky then you're dead
Says the voice inside my head
Keeps me moving on
Keeps me singing these songs
So sing along 
Here we go 
We've been down this road
About a thousand times before
I'm breathing and bored
So sing along 
Here we go 
Singing songs we wrote
About a thousand times before
I'm breathing and bored
The same four chords
The same four chords
Now the beard upon my face has gotten thicker
To protect me from the storms that come my way
Maybe when life's done I'll be the singer
In the band that plays outside of Heaven's gate
Cause after all mans intellect and power
All you get is   hours
If you're lucky then you're dead
Says the voice inside my head
Keeps me moving on
Keeps me singing these songs
So sing along 
Here we go 
Been down this road
About a thousand times before
I'm breathing and I'm bored
So sing along 
Here we go 
Singing songs we wrote
About a thousand times before
I'm breathing and I'm bored
The same four chords
The same four chords
The same four chords
The same four chords
Even if I die tomorrow I'll be glad my life was filled with songs
And even if I die tomorrow these four chords will keep me living on
Even if I die tomorrow I'll be glad my life was filled with songs
And maybe if I die tomorrow these four chords will keep me living on
Even if I die tomorrow be glad my life was filled with songs
And even if I die tomorrow these four chords will keep me living on
Oh oh the song that we wrote
Are playing back on the radio
Oh oh even if I die tomorrow
These four chords will keep me living on
So sing along
Oh oh the song that we wrote
Are playing back on the radio
Oh oh even if I die tomorrow
These four chords will keep me living on
These four chords will keep me living on
These four chords will keep me living on <start> Sitting in the kitchen
Just staring at the cracks in the wall
I've been sitting here since yesterday
Just waiting on you to call
The cracks remind me of you and I
They're all up down and split apart
And all the cracks in the wall lead to one great big hole
That used to be my heart
Now that I think of it
Nothing ever worked out right
All we ever seemed to do is just cuss scream bitch and fight
All we did was fight
The tears I cried
Fell on a cold and lonely floor
No one to wipe them away
The tears I cried
Will be my own and they'll follow me
And that's the way it's gonna stay
Now that I think of it
Nothing ever worked out right
All we ever seemed to do is just cuss scream bitch and fight
All we did was fight
Oh pretty baby can't you understand
I'm not made up of enough to be your man
Oh pretty baby don't know what to say
I just want you to go away
Well I'd love to sit and reflect on this
But I haven't got the time
Just tell me why you chose to be so cruel mean brutal so unkind
Now that I think of it
Nothing ever worked out right
All we ever seemed to do was cuss scream bitch and fight
All we did is fight
The tears I cried fell on a cold and lonely floor
No one to wipe them away
The tears I cried
Will be my own and they'll follow me
And that's the way it's gonna stay <start> Solace redefined
And I can't even bring myself to try and figure

Rosaries and wine
Trying not to see exactly when and where you failed
Stare into the eyes of blood
They say we chase dreams that don't exist
But you have tried so hard to find what's better than this
Running from myself
I'm running from the maladjusted boy I used to be
In sickness and in health
I would even be here if the walls were caving in
Stare into the eyes of blood
They say we chase dreams that don't exist
But you have tried so hard to find what's better than this <start> Slavin' away all for you my love.
And I've nothing to show for it
except my dusty old book full of pictures.
My dusty old book
Tell me a story
about how I wasn't so tired
from my slavin' away.
I ran off
put on corduroy knickers that I got from the coal shoveling kid
and hitchhiked in a rickety old Ford
hitchhiked in a rattly old Norton sidecar
down strange roads
in the purring rain
as the poet put it
on up to St. Paul
on a cold day in the middle of the fall.
And they picked me up
for not wearing a dress
and suspended my sentence
if I wore something with a strap that was pink
and I scrubbed up good on somebody's sink.
So now I'll catch the Canadian Pacific and not be too specific
to somewhere up north
and get into lumber and slumber when I like
and in the spring ride down into Cheyenne on my bike.
I looked out the window
and I stuck my head out the door.
And the snow was melting so slow
and the sky was light but so grey.
Slavin' away
and all for nothing my love.
Cooking and washing in the morning
and starting at nine twentyfive
I assembled six boxes of little plastic Christmas trees
and put in the blue L.E.D.s
on kid toy cell phones with four batteries.
And then on to the sewing machine
to stick the labels on purple Tshirts
and the arms on pullover jumpers
for the U.K.
Slavin' away
all for you my love
and I've nothing to show for it.
I've nothing to show for it.
I could see her looking in the mirror at me
wondering if it wasn't plain for everyone to see.
Nothing ever seemed to turn out how it might be.
I could see her doubting now that it all had gone and went
that anything she'd got was equal what that she'd spent.
That she never seemed to get back what that she'd lent.
Anyway they did have a son and by that time he was married
and I played at his wedding too at Holy Trinity
I was choir director myself.
Rehearsals in the basement
twice a week
I demanded we be in peak condition.
And everything seemed to be going quite well.
I got along well with the priest. <start> Where the hell did you get that smile
I haven't seen one of them in a while
'Cause these days I'm such a bore
I mope around
Like I seen it all before but something has changed I used to be an open heart
What have you done to me
It could have been anyone it could have been anyone
It could have been anyone it could have been anyone
But it wasn't you and it wasn't him it was me who felt like a fool right then
And I won't be the only one
It could have been anyone yes it could
Yeah yeah
When the hell did you get so wise
Foiled again by attempts to disguise
Do you recall the day we kissed
Upon the curb surrounded by the mist
I gave you my world to tear apart
Another fool another broken heart
It could have been anyone it could have been anyone
It could have been anyone it could have been anyone
But it wasn't you and it wasn't him it was me who felt like a fool right then
And I won't be the only one
It could have been anyone
I know doing it again it's out of line
Trying to catch a fish down the line
I know doing it again I must be blind
I'm doing it again
I'm doing it again
It could have been anyone it could have been anyone
It could have been anyone It could have been anyone
But it wasn't you and it wasn't him it was me who felt like a fool right then
And I can't be the only one
It could have been anyone <start> We talked and smoked all through the night
You led me where I had no sight
Till birdsong broke the morning light
And I was weak with strange delight
Teacher will you show to me
The bond between the land and sea
For I am new to mystery I want everything laid out for me
All of history
All of history
You showed me walls around the world
Where seekers passed and flags unfurled
You wove a tale in silken curls
And blew the mist in silver swirls
Teacher will you show to me
The bond between the land and sea
For I am new to mystery I want everything laid out for me
All of history
All of history
Teacher will you show to me
The bond between the land and sea
For I am new to mystery
I want everything laid out for me
All of history
All of history
All of history
All of history <start> We Expect a battle for humanity is about to begin
Within each uprising a vague sense of safety will ignite you in an unseen
Shadow without a slither of a doubt towards those who protect and defend
You.
Let the thoughts slip away and remain calm.
Stay close to F.E.A.R.
Only we can protect. <start> With all of this I know now
Everything inside of my head
It all just goes to show how
Nothing I know changes me at all
Again I waited for this to change instead
To tear the world in two
Another night with her
But I'm always wanting you
Use me Holly come on and use me
We know where we go
Use me Holly come on and use me
We go where we know
With all of this I feel now
Everything inside of my heart
It all just seems to be how
Nothing I feel pulls at me at all
Again I waited for this to pull apart
To break my time in two
Another night with her
But I'm always wanting you
Use me Holly come on and use me
We know where we go
Use me Holly come on and use me
We go where we know
She's all I need
She's all I dream
She's all I'm always wanting
She's all I need
She's all I dream
She's all I'm always wanting you
I'm always wanting you
I'm always wanting you
Use me Holly come on and use me
We know where we go
Use me Holly come on and use me
We go where we know
She's all I need
She's all I dream
She's all I'm always wanting
She's all I need
She's all I dream
She's all I'm always wanting you
And all again I wait for this
To fill a whole to shake the sky in two
Another night with her
I'm always wanting you
Another night with her
But I'm always wanting you <start> Got the devil in you
Got the devil in me
Play a dangerous tune
Come on and dance with thee
You got to throw your fists up
Shout your mouth out
Beat the walls down
Got to freak out
Rock your little
Rock your little
Rock your little heart out

Got everything you want
Got everything you need
Don't worry about the cost
Just sell your soul to me
You gotta bring the house down
Beat the drums loud
Bleed your life dry
Climb on lets fly
Rock your little
Rock your little
Rock your little heart out
Rock rock your little heart out


You gotta put your foot down
Beat your chest hard
Blow your brains out
Feel her shout loud
You gotta rock your heart out
Rock your heart out
Rock rock your little heart out
 <start> Instrumental <start> Mary Alice had a baby and he looked just like I did
We got married on a Monday and I been working ever since
Every week down at the Ford Plant but now they say they're shutting down
God damned Reagan in the White House and no one there gives a damn
Double Digit unemployment TVA be shutting soon
While over there in Huntsville They puttin' people on the moon
So I took to runnin' numbers for this man I used to know
And I sell a few narcotics and I sell a little blow
I ain't getting rich now but I'm gettin' more than by
It's really tough to make a living but a man just got to try
If I died in Colbert County Would it make the evening news
They too busy blowin' rockets Puttin' people on the moon
Mary Alice quit askin' why I do the things I do
I ain't sayin' that she likes it but what else I'm gonna do
If I could solve the world's problems I'd probably start with hers and mine
But they can put a man on the moon
And I'm stuck in Muscle Shoals just barely scraping by
Mary Alice got cancer just like everybody here
Seems everyone I know is gettin' cancer every year
And we can't afford no insurance I been  years unemployed
So she didn't get no chemo so our lives was destroyed
And nothin' ever changes the cemetery gets more full
And now over there in Huntsville even NASA's shut down too
Another Joker in the White House said a change was comin' round
But I'm still workin' at The Wal Mart and Mary Alice in the ground
And all them politicians they all lyin' sacks of shit
They say better days upon us but I'm sucking left hind tit
And the preacher on the TV says it ain't too late for me
But I bet he drives a Cadillac and I'm broke with some hungry mouths to feed
I wish I'z still an outlaw was a better way of life
I could clothe and feed my family still have time to love my pretty wife
And if you say I'm being punished. Ain't he got better things to do
Turnin' mountains into oceans Puttin' people on the moon
Turnin' mountains into oceans Puttin' people on the moon <start> Can't go on living in yesterday
Why do I long to live in yesterday
Find a way to you
Find a way to you
I know only you can carry me on
I know only you can carry me on
I can't replace the feelings of yesterday
I can't erase the pain from yesterday
I'll find a way to you
I'll find a way to you
I know only you can carry me on
I know only you can carry me on
Find a way to you
Find a way back home
I know only you can carry me on
I know only you can carry me on <start> Spineless bastards Blood caked bones to bang their drums
Resonates in all of us as we dance like suckers In blind delusion
Kissing the master's feet Kissing the master's ring
Sacrifice ourselves and others to their charm
We cheer with every bomb blast ripping through every village
Mourning our parents of disemboweled children
We split their faces
We laugh in their faces
Kill yourself with a noose of your own device
Strangle off the flowers and leave the thorns to fight
Let the peasants eat shit
They're surely used to it
Our lives grow on
And when the next group of unfortunates get their turn at the gas chambers
How loud will you cheer for the soldiers marching them on
The rich stay rich And the poor die of quietly
The power remains the same <start> James Holladay was a working man
He made his living on the land
But living alone was too much to stand
So Jim found a woman to understand
Two years passed living in joy
When out of the blue came a baby boy
Just to keep up the family name
Mister Holladay said we'll call him little James
So you better run run run run 
Jim you gotta get away
You better better run run run run 
Jim you gotta get away
You better better run run run run 
Jim you gotta get away 
Little James became a working man
He followed his pa right across the land
At the end of the day when his work was done
He'd sit and watch the setting southern sun
Nineteen years had come and gone
Little Jimmy had grown up big and strong
He didn't know that his time had come
When they handed him a shiny black gun
So his pa said run run run run run run 
Jim you gotta getaway
So you better run run run run run run run 
Jim you gotta get away
So you better run run run run run 
Jim you gotta get away 
Run run run run run run 
Jim you gotta getaway
You better better run run run run run run 
Jim you gotta get away
You better better run run run run run run 
Jim you gotta get away
 <start> If I thought it would help I would drive this car into the sea.
If the fire and the smoke and explosions could speak for me.
If the words that I used to try to explain
How something inside of me started to break.
Ah but one by one my words just got in the way.
And how many nights did I crash against the waves
With my head going under
How many days did I spend trying to see it your way
If you try you'd remember.
I changed a change and kept on saying
One of these days something inside's gonna break.
And we won't get it back now baby 
And if I thought it would help I would carve your name into my heart.

And if I thought it would help I would carve your name into my heart.

All of the things that I tried to explain
How something inside of me started to break.
We were living proof one by one we drifted away.
One by one we drifted away.
And time after time there were things that would scare me to tears
While you called me haunted.
I paced around the bed where you laid.
One of these days baby something 
And if I thought it would help I would carve your name into my heart.

And if I thought it would help I would carve your name into my heart.

All of the things that I tried to explain
How something inside of me started to break.
We were living proof one by one we drifted away
Drifted away
One by one and day by day
I became the dark in the places where you live.
And if I thought it would help I would carve your name into my heart.

And if I thought it would help I would carve your name into my heart.

All of the things that I tried to explain
How something inside of me started to break.
We were living proof one by one we drifted away.
One by one we drifted away.
We were living proof one by one we drifted away. <start> Anxiety don't pressure us
Faster I dream in speeds of ashes
My heart it beats and crashes
I'm running from the truth
Cause it fucks with my mind
Waiting we're silly we're so reckless
The city it's so heartless
A bottle full of crude
That washed up in the tide
Don't pressure us anxiety
I'm a passenger
So serious anxiety
Just a passenger
Handsome and calloused young believers
Hiding plotting schemers
And rotting out like fruit
That was left here to die
Talking waited after hours
Time is bending outward
I'm falling to my knees
To fall whole safe inside
Don't pressure us anxiety
I'm a passenger
So dangerous anxiety
Just a passenger <start> They ride beneath the waves at  leagues
On stallions stitched to seaweed strands
So smiling so smiling
They herd the fishes of the deep
They ride for you and me
They ranch the rich and the sunken soil
At the bottom of the sea
In the dead of night alive in sleep
I hear them calling me
Them deep sea desperadoes
Them midnight maelstrom freaks
The cowboy of the sea
So on wings of sleep I pierce the deep
And ride like a hurricane
At midnight still I paid my bill
And turned my back on the land
With the help of Old Paint that seaweed nag
It's just Jesse James and me
We ride the depths and rob the banks
At the bottom of the sea
With a seaman's grip on navigation
And some fired hired hands
We set forth to confront the nation
And lend a cowboy's hand
We do the dolphins' dance duet
My mermaid babe and me
Then I ride off into the blue sunset
At the bottom of the sea
And with the seaman's grip on submarining
And some aqualung outlaws
Our guns are made of solid dreamin'
And bullets from a broken cause
And with hand held high to touch the sky
A good Texas Ranger I'll bebut sometimes I feel like a lone stranger
'midst the cowboys of the sea
Oh and men above he cannot make love
He's got to rape his mother the sea
And because of his greed
We're a vanishing breed
We cowboys of the sea <start> What's got you so jumpy
Why can't you sit still yeah
Like gasoline you want to pump me
And leave me when you get your fill yeah
Every time I touch you honey you get hot
I want to make love you never stop
Come up for air you push me to the floor
What's been going on in that head of yours
Chorus
Unskinny bop
Just blows me away
Unskinny bop bop
All night and day
Unskinny bop bop bop bop
She just loves to play
Unskinny bop nothin' more to say
You look at me so funny
Love bite got you acting oh so strange
You got too many bees in your honey
Am I just another word in your page yeah yeah
Every time I touch you honey you get hot
I want to make love you never stop
Come up for air you push me to the floor
What's been going on in that head of yours
Chorus
You're sayin' my love won't do ya
But that ain't love written on your face
Well honey I can see right through ya
We'll see whose ridin' who at the end of the race
What's right
What's wrong
What's left
What the hell is going on
Chorus <start> No one knows you but they all love you
just don't let them get too much of you
careful man
don't forget you're the shadow man
look how many believe they need you
look how many tried to read you
no one can

and so you smile your smile
and fool those fools you care about
you've got it all
you've got the whole thing figured out
well haven't you
just confuse'em with smoke and static
make'em think that you enigmatic
that's the plan
you're the best at it shadow man
and when anyone penetrated
the illusion that you created
off you ran
you're too fast for them
shadow man
no emotional complication
that would ruin your reputation
every fan
needs a fantasy shadow man
if they could see behind the smile
and find the fear and doubt
they'd turn away
they'd have the whole think figured out
well wouldn't they
no one knows you but they all love you
just don't let them get too much of you
careful man
don't you forget you're the shadow man
every day now I see you clearer
you're the mystery in the mirror
man to man
tell me what's the plan
tell me how long can you be
a shadow man <start> All we shared was a mattress and a lie and an address
Baby I don't need you well baby I don't need you
Once occupied by a goddess now it's a room full of boxes
She said it's time to leave you but baby I don't need you
In a perfect world... her face would not exist
In a perfect world... a broken heart is fixed
In a perfect world... I'd see no therapist
In a perfect world... this wouldn't make me sick
I never got the whole story not 'til after she left me
Baby I don't need you well baby I don't need you
Word on the street is she fucked him while we were playing in Cleveland
Well baby I don't need you you're fading in my rearview
In a perfect world... her face would not exist
In a perfect world... a broken heart is fixed
In a perfect world... I'd see no therapist
In a perfect world... this wouldn't make me sick

No time for headaches
He's got this world to prove he's wrong
Slipped through the cracks they just don't know
Finding the relics
It's been his business all along
With bullwhip in hand he goes
Don't compete with Dr. Jones
In his endless search for truth
He just may end up after
Spending his time reading each line
Finding the message
The words are key to moving on
Trapped with the snakes and skulls in the cave
Where is the exit
The road to rescue o he plows his own
With bullwhip in hand he goes
Don't compete with Dr. Jones
In his endless search for truth
He just may end up after you
With bullwhip in hand he goes
Don't compete with Dr. Jones
Out to find what spells the truth
He'll kick McGyver's weak ass too <start> White boy in town
Big black blue sound
Night Club I paid in
I got a stamp on my skin.
Main attraction nearly dead on his feet
Black man rhythm with a white boy beat
They got him on milk and alcohol.
They got him on milk and alcohol.
Stay put I wanna go
Hard work bad show
More liquor don't help
He's gonna die breaks my heart.
I decided that eventually
This ain't doin' a thing for me
They got him on milk and alcohol.
They got him on milk and alcohol.
They got him on milk and alcohol.
They got him on milk and alcohol.
They got him on milk and alcohol.
They got him on milk and alcohol.
Got up I walked out
To the car started up
Feel bad sad night
Never saw a red light.
Sirens were screaming all around
I pulled on over and I shut her down
The black cop gave me a shove with his gun
Sit up against the wall and don't make a run. <start> There you go slipping away into a state of grace
I know the look that comes across your face
It's so familiar to me
Here I am trying to keep you in my line of sight
I'm never certain that you read me right
Sometimes you don't want to see me
Here we are both of us know we're in love
But that isn't always enough
I never could rise above it all down I fall
But darling there you go slipping away into a state of grace
Granted this world is not a perfect place
Still it's the world that I'm in
Here I am talking while
You don't hear a word I say
Knowing you're watching me from far away
Somewhere that I've never been
Don't you see you lived a different life than me
It don't mean you have to be afraid of how
We're not the same don't leave me now
But darling there you go slipping away
How can I get you to stay where you are
Keep you from going too far
Holding you here is so hard to do
I'm losing you
And darling there you go slipping away into a state of grace
Drifting away into your sacred place
Someplace that I've never been
There you go slipping away slipping away into a state of grace
There you go slipping away into a state of grace
Yeah drifting away into that sacred place
There you go slipping away <start> Herr ich bin schuldig

Pass the saints through the heaven gates  we can hide out there

She's got these eyes well where do I start
Like lookin' at the deep night sky
So many worlds inside her eyes
She's a
Spectacular girl
Part of the job of bein' her man
Is knowin' when to let go of her hand
Her kind of power it can't be reigned in
To hold her back would be a sin
She's a
Spectacular girl
She sees the beauty in things we all miss
All good things are defined by her kiss
If you're feelin' like you can't believe
Well then how do you explain the miracle I see
She's a
Spectacular girl
Spectacular girl
Not a desire and not a need
Some things just happen 'cause they have to be
I'm gonna get there I'm tellin' you sir
I'm a man on a mission and I'm all about her

A little dream
About your friends
And their endings

Knowing that my friends
Will not remember me

And present's worth saving
But the past is haunting me

Find a way to rewind it
Stop it deny it

You own every day
Patience please heal me
Come take me away

Wanna turn it around before it comes down on me

Shatter the humility

When the storm clouds gather
And my blood runs cold
If we can't go further
When we get to the shore
Then we have to turn around
And fight some more
We'll go together
I have room in my soul
That's enough of watching people
Trading hearts for gold
I can see you on the beach
On your knees
Spilling more salt in an
Already dead sea
We'll feel the wind and the rain
On our face
You can do it yourself
But I heard of a place
It's got to be now
And it better be together
When spirits make a meeting
You can feel it forever
Bad weather gathers all along the coast
When the storm clouds gather
And my blood runs cold
I can see you on the beach
On your knees
Spilling more salt in an
Already dead sea
Run away with me again
Time for us to grow
Run away with me again
All of us alone <start> You're such a dick you make me feel like I'm
A pinhead  I've fucked it up and dropped the
Ball too many times  but when you start to
Talk I always get the feeling  you like to put
Your foot in your mouth all the time
Always complaining  that you never ever
Going nowhere  it's getting old fast and I
Try so hard to look like I care  don't even
Realize you get an even bigger surprise when
I see you in hell  and when they kick you out
I know you're gonna cry  you're gonna say
You're sorry  but you'll still think you were
Right  and in the end you'll never bend or
Ever see their side
Conceited
You get off on pointing out other people's
Weakness  but don't realize you're the
Weakes one of all  you're living life like it's
A never ending bitch fest  but don't know
You're setting yourself up for a fall
You always complaining  you never ever
Going nowhere  it's getting old fast and I
Try so hard to look like I care
Don't even realize you get an even bigger
Surprise when I see you in hell  and when
They kick you out  I know you're gonna cry
Pretending that you're sorry  but you'll
Still think you were right  and in the end
You'll never bend or ever see their side
And if it blows up in your face I know you'll
Pay no mind  'cause pointing finger is
Exactly what you like to do  you'll say it was
Somebody else but we'll know it was you
Easy to read you always telegraph your
Every move
Conceited
We know you never reckon  that you just
Might be mistaken  you're a never ending
Mess is surely just an understatement
If you could only see what I see  when I look
At you maybe you'd reconsider but I doubt it
Even bothers you  you like to be the cause of
Aggravating situation  doesn't occur to you
You're being such an asshole  I think deep
Down inside you like to be the irritation
I want to be there on the day you pay
And when they kick you out  I know you're
Gonna cry  you're gonna say you're sorry
But you'll still think you were right
And in the end you'll never bend or ever see
Their side  and if it blows up in your face
I know you'll pay no mind  'cause pointing
Fingers is exactly what you like to do
You'll say it was somebody else we know it
Was you  easy to read you telegraph your
Every move
Conceited
Conceited
Conceited <start> Setting sun forgot who I was
Put the garbage where it doesn't belong
All is numb two minutes to one
What's your life like with all that you've done
You've done you've done
Listen close wherever you go
Dull times let'em seep into your bones
Keep it kind always in time
Honest themes every once in a while
In a while in a while
In a while in a while
Filthy room guitars out of tune
Blank thoughts like I promised to you
Underneath is there something to see
Slower clouds only reflecting
On the water on the water
On the water on the water
Feel's like I'm going insane why bother
The home is where the heart is
How long we've apart it's been hard
Or home is where you are
Which side I live on I won't say
Home is where the heart is
How long we've been apart
It's been harder home
Home is where you are
And which side I live on
Long we've been apart
Home is where the heart
Home is where you are
Blank state and maudlin
In need of something to say
Get to solving this thinking problem
Dissolution at the start of the day start of the day
I administered badly
Dreaming mysteries up
The stars spinning around and around me
While the tasks keep piling up
Piling up they're piling up
I might talk to the ceiling
I never need something to do
I never needed a reason to stare into the light the light of the moon 
Staring at the light 
Home is where the heart is home is where you are
Long we've been apart which side I live on
Home is where the heart
Staring at the light 
Staring at the light  <start> I don't want you to be no slave
I don't want you to work all day
But I want you to be true
And I just wanna make love to you
Love to you ooh ooh
Love to you
All I want to do is wash your clothes
I don't want to keep you indoors
There is nothing for you to do
But keep me making love to you
Love to you ooh ooh
Love to you
And I can tell by the way you walk that walk

Crazy little thing called love
There goes my baby
She knows how to rock and roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat

Get hip get on my tracks
Take a back seat hitchhike
And take a long ride on my motor bike
Until I'm ready

And you go for a ride
Till you get to the bottom

No matter how hard I try
Theres something bad baby wrong with me
Whenever I close my eyes
The dreams of Mary keep me awake
With every little curve in place
Everyone walk home in the day
Come back home
Baby wont you give me
Darlin bring on the night
Oh yeah darlin bring on the night
Oh now darlin bring on the night
I walk the street Im lookin for romance
I end up stumblin in some stupid halftrance
As I watch the lovers mix with circumstance
We watch the disco dancers dance
I look for connection in some new eyes
But for protection theyre tranquilized
Forbidding close inspection of whos tellin who
Forbidding close inspection of whos tellin who lies
Bring on the night
Oh yeah darlin bring on the night
Oh now darlin bring on the night well
Is it as simple as it seems
I dont know what Im doin here
Is it as simple as it seems
Is it as simple as I fear well if Im right
I look for connection in some new eyes
But for protection theyre tranquilized
Forbidding close inspection of whos tellin who
Forbidding close inspection of whos tellin who
Baby of whos tellin who lies

All clothed in a snowy shroud
She had no heart so hardened
All under the boughs unbowed
Each feather it fell from skin
'Til threadbare while she grew thin
How were my eyes so blinded
Each feather it fell from skin
And I will hang my head low
A gray sky a bitter sting
A rain cloud a crane on wing
All out beyond horizon
A gray sky a bitter sting <start> speak quickly insecure don't let in a word. i will marvel at your understanding. i'm amazed by the depths of your reason yet if it were for reason alone then what's compelling you i admire your comprehension but i'm failing to find the love in your words it's hard for me to honor the things that you say when it is love that never fails. it is love that never fails that without i am nothing. even if i had all faith faith so that i could remove mountains but have not love i am nothing. i admire your comprehension but i'm failing to find the love in your words it's hard for me to honor the things that you say when it is love that never fails. it is love that never fails that without i am nothing. <start> I have seen my own gravestone
and worshiped the golden statue
I've made my bed in the lion's den
and walked in dead man's shoes
I have witnessed coastline
from a bird's eye view
And I made the request that we plunge to our death
so that I could get to You
I will walk through the fire
I will not be afraid
They can take everything that I have
But they can't give me my name
I have climbed every bookshelf
In search of hardcover proof
And if I am judged by the things I have loved
I hope some of them are true <start> Tuck me into where it's freezing
Tuck me into bed with snakes.
Tuck me in with the tarantulas
I want to let 'em in my mouth and down my throat to lay their eggs.
Tuck me into where there's bleeding
Where it spills out of the walls onto the floor.
Tuck me into where your best friend's apologies amount to shit
They always did for ever more.
I pour out onto the floor like liquid white from fallen glass
Nothing to cry over
My skin went sour long ago
It knew it had nowhere else to go.
Tuck me into where I'm falling
Where I can feel the heat rise underneath my wings.
And all the fallen angels in hell will tuck me away from you
Take me away from everything.
Tuck me into where there's dying
Tuck me in with flames and tuck me in with flies
Maybe then you will appreciate your only friend
With maggots in her eyes or as ashes in the sky.
I pour out onto the floor like liquid white from fallen glass
Nothing to cry over
My skin went sour long ago
It knew it had no place left to go. <start> The curtain thins
Violins announce the score is over
The symphony clears the folded chairs
And walk towards the snack bar
And I forgot what the libretto was all about
At eight o'clock you drop me off
And not a word was spared for us
Drinks at ten we're off again
The crowds and bouncers stare at us
And the last one out the car fills the meter up
Don't say your name just dance with me
Oh no my ride is gone it's time to leave
Then racing for the sink
I shove my head in
And the world looks like heaven
It's all white <start> I heard a battle raging on the other side of the wall.
I buried my head in a pillow and tried to ignore it all.
Every night when I hear you I dream of breaking down your door.
An avenging knight in shining armour to rescue you from it all.
From this family business family business.
How long does it stay family business
It's nobody's business this family business
But tell me how long it remains family business
When I see you at the supermarket sunglasses in the shade
Averting your eyes from those staring questions how were those bruises made
The children clutch tight to your legs they've got so much they want to say
But daddy's sitting home drunk again so they bite their lips and pray
'cause daddy don't like people poking in his private affairs
And if anyone asks from the social well you tripped and fell down the stairs.
It's family business keep it in the family business.
Can you tell me how long it remains family business
It's nobody's business this family business
But tell me how long it should stay family business
She's waiting at the bus stop at the bottom of the hill
She know's she'll never catch it she knows she never will.
The kids are all she lives for she's got nothing left to lose
Nowhere to escape to but she knows she's got to move.
'Cause when daddy tucks the kids in it's taking longer every night.
It's family business keep it in the family business
Can you tell me how long it reamins family business
It's nobody's business this family business
But tell me how long it should stay family business
So I become an accessory and I don't have an alibi
To the victim on my doorstep the only way I can justify.
It's family business family business
How long do we keep it family business <start> Romance the stoned
With squirrly squirm smiles
The brethren fallen
Like treeless leaves left swollen
Wretch wretch wretch
But pickup
New foe revival
The th coming
Let the games bleed
Evel Knievel and Bruce Lee
Geneticallyspeaking
Babydoll who's your daddy
Sprinkle the damned
With tribal claims
Forfeit the savior
And mop the mouth with grout
Wretch wretch wretch
But sit up
The sickness quelled like a gel
For us

Po wielu latach dowiesz si prawdy
Krra spoczywa daleko gdzie przed tob
Na samym dnie przeznaczenia gry
Niewidomy przemierzasz zakamarki istnienia
Patrzc tylko na umare gwiazdy
Jutro znowu wstan twoje oczy
Takie same lecz tak bardzo inne
Oto i ona
Twoja Gra Przeznaczenia
Tyle lat szukae jej
Bdzc po wielu wityniach
Pytajc kapanw mdrcw i bogw
O prawdy lad
Teraz wiesz ju jak bardzo
Bye odlegy od jej bram
Oto i ona
Twoja Gra Przeznaczenia
Teraz wiesz ju jak bardzo
Bye odlegy od jej bram. <start> Night and day you are the one
Only you beneath the moon under the sun.
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter darlin' where you are
I think of you night and day.
Night and day why's it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go.
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you night and day
Night and day under the hide of me
There's an old such a hungry yearning burning inside of me
And this torment won't be through
Till you let me spend my life making love to you
Day and night night and day <start> On the first part of the journey
I was looking at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There were sand and hills and rain
The first thing I met was a fly with no buzz
And a sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound
You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can't remember your name
Cause there ain't no one to a give you no pain
After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed
And the story it told
Of a river that floated
Made me sad to think it was dead
You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
After nine days I let the horse run free
Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There were sand and hills and things
The ocean is a desert with it's life underground
And the perfectest sky is above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love <start> I learned a new word today that word is NO
You don't get all the money I make just cause you own real estate
You don't get forty hours a week from me
You don't get to make my choices for me
You are only your own authority
You don't get possession of me 'cause you got something I need
You don't get to abuse me at all just 'cause you're big and you think that I'm small
You don't get possession of me just 'cause you got something I need
I learned a new word today that word is NO. <start> Farewell to fiction so long to sorrow
No complications no hurt tomorrow
I'm tired of losing time
I'm leaving loneliness behind
I guess I've had enough of giving up.
If we all fall like dominoes
Never look back never look back
If we all fall like dominoes
Never look back never look back
Woahohohohoh
Never look back never look back
Woahohohohoh
Never look back never look back
Farewell frustration so long to sadness
No isolation there's no pain inside us.
I'm through with troubled times
I'm sick of all the sleepless nights
I guess I've had enough of giving up.
If we all fall like dominoes
Never look back never look back
If we all fall like dominoes
Never look back never look back
Woahohohohoh
Never look back never look back
Woahohohohoh
Never look back never look back
Heartaches breakdowns mistakes  come downs
Lost love  bad luck sometimes it all seems too much.
Pitfalls man down world wars don't look now
Four walls small towns you can't let it break us now.
If we all fall like dominoes
Never look back never look back
If we all fall like dominoes
Never look back never look back
If we all fall like dominoes 
Never look back never look back

A donde habrs volado hoy
Al espacio que se yo
Esa mente tuya encanta
Me hace perder la razn
Y en donde habrs estado hoy
Crees que yo podra ser
Aquel chico que soabas que llegaba
Con su espada y un corcel
Una rosa un clavel.
Cualquier cosa puedo dar
Las estrellas regalar
Si solo somos T y Yo mi amor
Cada vez que sale el sol
Tu sonrisa no aparece
Est en la luna que se yo
Y en mis sueos no te vi
Te busque y no te encontr
A donde habrs podido ir
Y en donde habrs estado hoy
Crees que yo podra ser

I've already said this
I might need a medic
I'm trapped in these mornings without you
These mornings without you yeah
I'm more than just nervous
With walls on the surface
I know that you've heard this
I just want a morning here with you
A morning here with you yeah
Ooh ooh ooh nowhere to run to when it gets harder
Ooh ooh ooh no one can find us under the water no no
Ooh ooh ooh sharing a breath under the hurricane
Ooh ooh ooh no one can find us under the water no no
I've been thinking about leaving
Slowly sinking down
But while I'm thinking you keep reaching
Never let me drown
You show me I'm worth it and no one is perfect
We all have a purpose and mine is to love this life with you
To love this life with you
Ooh ooh ooh nowhere to run to when it gets harder
Ooh ooh ooh no one can find us under the water no no
Ooh ooh ooh sharing a breath under the hurricane
Ooh ooh ooh no one can find us under the water no no
Cause in this moment we become free
Two warms hearts under the cold sea
Yeah we float on we float on
And in this time we become one
We could find peace with nowhere to run
Yeah just hold on just hold on
And in the darkness there will be light
Two lost souls in a starlit night
Don't let go because it won't feel right yeah
I hear you calling I'm calling back now
The rain is falling under the light town
Ooh ooh ooh nowhere to run to when it gets harder
Ooh ooh ooh no one can find us under the water no no
Ooh ooh ooh nowhere to run to when it gets harder

And a river runs through it
If you split my mountain wide
You would find many rivers
Among flocks of nonwhite doves
And nontemptable mortals
The kingdom is much more real
And the beauty is endless
Only when tightened beyond recall
Is your necklace a blessing
Leave your pearls in the sea
You undeserved bitch
You are not worthy of such a treasure
My hand on your heart I know there is a beating
In this oh so bleak landscape
There are many mountains
But not so much water.
My kingdom <start> Up around ten with a headache kicking
Guess I fell asleep with a cigarette
My girl's back home with the morning sick
Got a baby on the way not here yet
And I'm alright I think we're good
Yeah I drink more than the doctors say I should
I've been a little hard to reach but my girl is at the beach
And I'll see her on the weekend
I'll see her on the weekend
I'll see her on the weekend
I'll see her at the end of the week
Friday comes lately I'm sleeping
Until the sun fills up my rented room
I pack my things get my car started
Yeah I've been gone but I'll be home real soon
Cell phone's dead and she's calling
Message box is full
Up around ten with a headache kicking
Guess I fell asleep with a cigarette
My girl's back home with the morning sick
Got a baby on the way not here yet
And I'm alright I think we're good
Yeah I drink more than the doctors say I should
I've been a little hard to reach but my girl is at the beach
And I'll see her on the weekend
I'll see her on the weekend
I'll see her on the weekend

Friday comes and she's calling
Message box is full
Up around ten with a headache kicking
Guess I fell asleep with a cigarette
My girl's back home with the morning sick
Got a baby on the way not here yet
And I'm alright I think we're good

Been around since  way before the Union come
Built up on a hill its got a acre view
But there ain't been no cotton there since Sherman's boys marched through
They've come and burned us down
Guess we had it comin'
Jumped out of my pickup truck there was something in the wind
Filled my soul with empty and sent a chill across my skin
Heard the ghost of a black man hollerin' Blue across the field
He said they sold my only daughter to keep that mansion on a hill
And I wanted to burn it down
Aww but it wouldn't do no good
I cried Goodbye Dixie go rest in peace
We've got enough trouble here without you haunting me
We buried that cross now we're looking ahead
So go on Dixie don't bother me I'm tryin' to forget
Drove up to the courthouse that holds the county seat
I walked underneath the poplar trees casting shadows on Main Street
I read the old bronze marker I'd seen many times before
And after all these years I learned what those branches were for
They used to hang 'em here back in the days of ole Jim Crowe
A black man I knew from high school came walkin' out in chains
He used to make me laugh but now his eyes were filled with pain
He got busted sellin' rock down there on MLK
So the county came and locked him up and took his kids away
Oh he used to seem alright to me
Man I wonder what went wrong
I cried Goodbye Dixie go rest in peace
We've got enough trouble here without you haunting me
We buried that cross now I'm looking ahead
So go on Dixie don't bother me I'm tryin' to forget
Way down yonder in the land of cotton oh how times have changed
But I wonder if the truth is marching on
Its hard to be a Southern man and learn your history
Cause it all comes back and hits you close to home
I cried Goodbye Dixie go rest in peace
We've got enough trouble here without you haunting me
We buried that cross now I'm trying to make a dime
So go on Dixie don't bother me
So go on Dixie don't bother me
So go on Dixie don't bother me
Because I ain't got the time <start> Lyrics jones

Lyrics
Standing in the eden garden
Lying in the shade
Sidewinder in the dirt
Grass cutting king of spades
Sidewinder
Adam was combing hair
Eden was bearing fruit

Passion was in pain
Now the politics beware
Pandora's open box
Lock lay broken on the stairs
Eyes are open
Mouths are choking
The glass is broken bare
She said to me
Eyes that glow are yellow gold
Don't cross that sidewinder in the road
Smoke in the flower pots
Evening comes and leaves a blot
Lying to the leaving love
Planted from the jah above
Sidewinder
Took a bite bit her lip
Water running on the trip

Joker's wild eve is heavy
Adam got his lid flipped
Naked bones bright and white
Fruit was juicy tree was stripped
Sidewinder
Fig leaf and fidgety
Better days on adam's eve
 <start> Hey baby it's getting late now
And the years are rollin' on
Ain't no time to take it easy now
We been goin' too long
It's dirty it's a pity
And time ain't exactly on our side
That ain't no reason now
Not to give it a try
Don't look inside the mirror
Your time is drawing nearer
How many dues do I have to pay
Before they take my soul away
Sick of being unforgiven
But there's blue skies overhead
A dirty way to make a livin' yeah
But somebody's got to do it
I'm a lover not a loser
I'm a lonely heart's one night stand
Not a penny in my pocket
Nor a dime in my hand
Don't look inside the mirror
Your time is drawing nearer
How many dues do I have to pay
Before they take my soul away
If you've been hurt by love before
You don't think you can take anymore
I think it's about time you evened the score
Let's hit the door
Nobody said it was easy
Nobody said it was easy
Nobody said it was easy
Nobody said it was easy
Nobody said it was easy
Nobody said it was easy
Nobody said it was easy <start> Wise man you won't be
To follow the like of me
In this world made of stone
Such a long way to go
We may disagree
We all have the right to be
In this world made of stone
Such a long way to go
Such a long long way from home
And we may disagree
We all have the right to be
In this world made out of stone
It's such a long long way to go
The wiser you may be
The harder it can be to see
In this world made of stone
Such a long long way to go
Such a long way from home <start> This temptation
proves to be too much
And all the avenues explode yeah
My situation hard to touch
And you don't want me anymore
And I can't take that anymore
This is my mission statement
Just listen and don't negate it
My woman tis of thee
Sweet land of you and me
CHORUS
I don't want your friendship
I'm still wanting more
Why don't we just end it
It's you I can't ignore
This aggravation's got me stuck
And nothing seems to be alright
My imposition's just bad luck
Explosive feelings rage inside
I've got to talk to you tonight
This is our constitution
Just listen without intrusion
My woman tis of thee
Sweet land of you and me
CHORUS
Chorus Fill
Yeah eplosive feelings rage
I can't move on and I won't contain
How can you just walk away
The life we had is now erased
BRIDGE
It's like I never had her
And it don't matter
It's like I never had her..
This is my mission statment

This is my mission statment

CHORUS
substitute last two lines of Chorus Fill for last two original lines of Chorus
...I threw a rock at window
missed and hit the light... <start> I do them when I'm down in the tub
With avocado cream they'll take a rub
They wrinkle like araisins if I stay too long
I wouldn't want to do it wrong
They'll put you in the driver's seat
And to the table when you want to eat
But when you go to sit down in your chair
Something else has got to put you there
Take good care of your feet Pete
You better watch out what you eat Pete
Better take care of your life
'Cause nobody else will
They'll twinkle when you fall in love
And put you there when you jump up above
When you're on the spot get them right under you
One then the other too
If you want to do the right thing for them
Just take a walk in the grass
But don't you catch yourself fallin'
Or steppin' on a piece of glass

Pete knows all the treacherous blows
The fallen arches and the cramp in the toes
He went to H. E. L. P. and got some sandals new
And dusty old saunas too
Take a load of your feet Pete
You better watch out what you eat
Better take care of your life
'Cause nobody else will
Do do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do do <start> No one would love me
If they knew all the things I hide
My words fall to the floor
As tears drip through the telephone line
And the hands I've seen raised to the sky
And not waving but drowning all this time
I'll try to build the ark that they need
To float to You upon the crystal sea
Give me Your hand to hold
'Cause I can't stand to love alone
And love alone is not enough to hold us up
We've got to touch Your robe
So swing Your rope down low
Swing Your rope down low
The prince of despairs been beaten Lord
But the loser still fights
Death's on a long leash
Stealing my friends to the night
And everyone cries for innocent
You say to love the guilty too
And I'm surrounded by suffering and sickness
So I'm working tearing back the roof
Give me Your hand to hold
'Cause I can't stand to love alone
And love alone is not enough to hold us up
We've got to touch Your robe
So swing Your robe down low
Swing Your robe down low
And the pain of the world is a burden
And it's my cross to bear
And I stumble under all the weight
I know You're Simon standing there
And I know You're standing there
Give me Your hand to hold
'Cause I can't stand to love alone
And love alone is not enough to hold us up
We've got to touch Your robe
So swing Your robe down low
Swing Your robe down low <start> Caricatures of your wrecking ball
In my mind all the time
I wanna be in that damselpatterned alley
Where you go for a smoke
And sorrow slow dances
The phones are lining up
Taking no chances
Close but never close enough
Been watching cowboy films
On gloomy afternoons
Tinting the solitude
Put on your dancing shoes
And show me what to do
I know you've got the moves
All my own stunts
Hiding has changed its tune
Linking arms syncing hearts
And sorrow slow dances
Around the edges of her eyes
Taking no chances
The last one out to win a prize
Been watching cowboy films
On gloomy afternoons
Tinting the solitude
Put on your dancing shoes
And show me what to do
I know you've got the moves <start> Today my baby left me with a smile upon her face
she was talking japanese about some individual space
and now I find myself inside this jumbo bed
I cannot eat not sleep nor move
Oh god I feel so sad
Why did you do it 
She said  lift up your head my boy
Why did you do it 
You know there ain't no need to cry
Why did you do it 
It will be funny when I die
Does anybody know 
Can anybody say 
Will she ever come
Back in anyway 
Does anybody know 
Can anybody say 
Will she ever come
Back in anyway 
Yeah yeah yeah 
She didn't even realize that I changed my mind today
Oh god she was as cold as ice and she didn't melt away
When I told her she's the only one and I would always love her
She said I'll always love you too my boy but more just like a brother
Why did you do it 
She said  lift up your head my boy
Why did you do it 
You know there ain't no need to cry
Why did you do it 
It will be funny when I die
Does anybody know 
Can anybody say 
Will she ever come
Back in anyway 
Does anybody know 
Can anybody say 
Will she ever come
Back in anyway 
Yeah yeah yeah <start> Lost myself in a tangent of words
Can't decide what I've seen or heard
Can not sleep for counting sheep
How long does this river run deep
How long does this river run deep.
Building a map in order to find
What's not lost but left behind
My instinct got bruised
But I still see
I was a victim I'll be no casualty.
Just like coming home
Just like coming home
Just like coming home
It was just like coming home
Coming home.
He said that you weave deadly tricks
Come right back to the worldly hicks
Stare it cold in dull surprise
Spread evil to hell in every tear you cried
Every tear you cried.
Building a map in order to find
What's not lost but left behind
I was a victim I'll be no casualty.
Just like coming home
Just like coming home
Just like coming home
Could be just like coming home
Coming home.
Cut off my toes to spite my feet
Drank your poison
Didn't taste too sweet
Saw that heaven's in my mind
It's there for me to find
It's there for me to find. <start> All the time I took to make it here
you're so unkind
Everyone chose to let us in the back door
Chose to let us in
It's a crazy chord
they call it B
If you play it you will see
you write a song just like me
All the words I chose to write them down
in this book yes I know
I only get around to reading it
I only get around
It's a crazy chord
they call it B
If you play it you will see
you write a song just like me
oh We've come to far
We've come to far
We've come to far
We've come to far
It's a crazy chord
they call it B
If you play it you will see
you write a song just like me
Write a song just like me <start> I am lonely in bed tonight. I am scared because I'm not blown out. Can't you come over and make it all just as colourful as before. Oh baby How fucked up I am... <start> They put my poster on the wall
They watch and wait for me to fall
They think they made me who I am
Well they don't know me at all
I don't change my mind for anybody
I won't waste my time on just anybody
I won't share my life 
It's such a long road 
That I couldn't follow 
Never anyone but
Never anyone but 
It's such a long road 
That I couldn't follow 
Never anyone but you <start> An empty street a quiet smile
Without steady feet
You know the reckless kind
Keep coming coming back
To the same old place
With that wild eyed stare
Up in your face
Chorus
Lay me down let me down
In a big old town
Lay me down let me down
In a big old town
He must have lost his soul
When he found the rent
He wrestles with control
Still hasn't pinned it yet
Once in once in a while
Loose that cigarette
There's always some strange smile
Underneath his breath
Chorus
Passion's fist against a wall
The crush of a kiss the rise and fall
Take me there take me there
To that wounded sound
It's just love's despair
Gone and hit the ground
Chorus
Lay me down let me down Repeated <start> Two three four
Why would a man who believed in no God
Sacrifice all he had
To kill or be killed in pursuit of a cause
Was the fate that called to him
And you can say he might be crazy
And some can't understand
That a life spent doing less
Than all you can would be a waste
There's only one way to truly succeed
And it's not through intervention
To influence the minds of the rest of mankind
Will best serve your intentions
You can say he might be crazy
And some can't understand
That a life spent doing less
Than all you can would be a waste
If you just can't make the world what you want
At least you can make yourself
An example for others to learn from and see
The future for themselves
And you can say he might be crazy
And some can't understand
That a life spent doing less
Than all you can would be a waste
Life would be a waste
Life would be a waste <start> So far so good
Stumble through life so complicated it's nearly Impossible
And i lost my way like i knew i would and keep it Together somehow anyway
And i remember you and me
Climbing over backyard fences diving naked in the Swimming pool
All those faces friends those memories fade so fast
Like every love song on the radio
Is it brilliant where you are
Where the lights are low
Is it brilliant where you are
Where the lights are
Through a million days through a million hazy nights
We sit amusing in our politics
Through wine and talk through sex and art we fill our time
And numb ourselves with what's to come
But i'm older now got a little girl of my own
And her fears are my fears now
I know that it's the end of days for moderates
But thinking people are thinking still
Is it brilliant where you are
Where the lights are low
Is it brilliant where you are
Where the lights are <start> Oh my God how you've grown
Yes sir
They sit upon their hands
Betting there's an easy answer
Right of passages
Someone give rise to hope
Yes sir
Young wicked
Yes sir
Oh my God how you've grown
Death hides holy hidden worlds
And hello wise one your time ain't true
Eating up those satires twilights and ozone
The animals have gone down below
Yes sir
Young wicked
Yes sir


Young wicked x
 Yes sir
 Yes sir
Young wicked x
Yes sir
Yes sir
Young wicked
Yes sir
Young wicked <start> She didn't bat an eye as I packed my bags to leave
I thought she would cry or sit around my room and grieve
But oh the girl she fooled me this time
Acting like I was the last thing on her mind
Now I'd like to start all over again
I just want to change my mind
As I took those steps toward that open door
Knowing all the time oh Lord I just didn't wanna go
She didn't give me no sign
Nothing that would make me wanna change my mind
And I would like to start all over again
Baby can I change my mind
Cause I would like to change my mind
You know I was confused sitting here by myself thinking
watching you walk to the door and walk away
what was I supposed to say change your mind
Oh I've played my game so many times before
But people let me tell y'all that I never reached the door
Oh the wind it is high tonight
I keep lookin' for my baby but she's not in sight
And I would like to start all over again <start> Well I heard John say man she's my gal
I heard another say man she my pal
Well John jumped up then he screamed
Wellshe's may gal man and that I mean
Well whowho who slapped John
Whowho who slapped John
Baby who slapped John when the lights went lowoh
Whowho who slapped John

Well the lights went on then went off
John got slapped tryin' to hold his own
Well whowho who slapped John
Whowho who slapped John
Baby who slapped John when the lights went lowoh
Whowho who slapped John 
Well I heard John say man she's my gal
I heard another say man she my pal
Well John jumped up then he screamed
She's may gal man and that I mean
Well whowho who slapped John
