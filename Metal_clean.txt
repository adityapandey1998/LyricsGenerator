 <start> Tina and I went shopping the other day
Both bought new dresses wore them right away
Cut off the tags  no second thoughts
Can't take them back wouldn't want to of course
Why be sensible  money's dispensable
Don't worry be happy make the most of what's available
Wear your Sunday best on Mondays
Doubt when the weather report says Save it for a rainy day
We could see each other Saturday
Or get together next week  but why wait Use the good china
Tina and I read a poem the other day
We didn't write it but it's so cool that  I'll quote it anyway
You've got to love like you've never been hurt
Act like you don't need money when you go to work
Look before crossing  it's advisable
But jumping in with both feet is what I call admirable ...
Wear your Sunday best on Mondays
Doubt when the weather report says Save it for a rainy day
We could see each other Saturday
Or get together next week  but why wait Use the good china
Wear your Sunday best on Mondays
Doubt when the weather report says Save it for a rainy day
We could see each other Saturday
Or get together next week  but why wait Use the good china
I could wait to say I love you
Until I'm sure you're gonna say it too
Or I could just say it right now
Why that strange need to postpone
Living in the future is wrong
Use the good china
Use the good china  Use the good china <start> Purity shadowed with blasphemy
Worthy of unholy doings.
Blood spills through your followers
Preaching your false word.
Delivered from sin all has lost meaning.
Telling lies of impure ways. A blind religion.
I desecrate your kingdom
All those follow stand before me.
Begging for salvation in tongues
They now kneel and pray to me
Cast down from above injecting Jerusalem
With hatred abomination of all.
Devour the preachers of holiness
Proclaim myself as god. Denying thy summons
I plague the rejoiced to damnation
Manifest thyself unto me crucify then disembowel
The inner circle of Apostles with suffering.
Visions of slaughtering
The weak engaged in demonic sacrilege
Perpetual salvation sent forth to slay
Execution of prophets bring forth the whore
Fornicate delivering the Apostles
A mistake from god.
Extinction of twelve denying the cross
One by one they will perish like the Lord
And we shall let him see restitution is upon him
And he is ignored descending upon mortals
Projecting ourselves as disciples.
Purity shadowed with blasphemy
Worthy of unholy doings.
Blood spills through your followers
Preaching your false word.
Devour the preachers of holiness
Proclaim myself as god. Denying thy summons
I plague the rejoiced to damnation
Manifest thyself unto me crucify then disembowel
The inner circle of Apostles with suffering.

Divine Suffering. <start> Though I've called your name a thousand times my words are blown back
into my face. The wind makes my skin harder still. The clouds race by
overhead and I fight to remain standing the signs of endless journeys
shows in my weakened stance. I wish for the ground to open. I have been
around the world and back I have relived every memory redreamt every
dream and felt every touch . Still the clouds will race the wind
will cut and soon I will fall. The dust will form a mound that shall be my
tomb never to be whetted by the tears of mourning because I was lost
long ago in a colder world and lost you forever.
I believe that each man craves the soul rejuvenation that for centuries
authors and poets of the world have immortalised through the written and
spoken word. I believe that each man wishes to harness the power of the
burning sun and rejuvenate the soul that for many of us lies dead. I too
have traveled these paths and found that most lead to a bare world. <start> Fly forever fly along
Let your wings just breathe the air tonight
To foreign skies fly on a rainbow dream
She's straying from reality
Her imagination leaves her mind
Like a falcon she is passing her old home
She's calling the spirits up there
She's freeing herself from clandestine eyes
Awaiting brightened skies
I will bring this dream to you believe
I will lead you everywhere
Chorus
Fly fly on a rainbow dream
Just glide into the gleaming sky
Eternally away from staring eyes
Fly forever fly along
Let your wings just breathe the air tonight
To foreign skies fly on a rainbow dream
She enters horizons unseen
Away from the whispers of the night
In a reverie she's heading on and on
She's passing elysian fields
Ascending on wings of a glorious ride
She feels the falcon's pride
I will bring this dream to you believe
I will lead you everywhere
Chorus
Is it stardust of time
In these pictures of infinity
All the memories appearing one by one
Are reflections in me
Fly fly fly
Spread your wings and touch the sky
 high high
One more time I face the falcon eye to eye
Before the rainbow's fading
Then gold is at the end
Right on your dream through time
Forevermore fly on a rainbow dream <start> Dig your way to misery
Spark eternal hatred
Burn all bridges
Set it free
Your time here has been altered
Awakening
Free your mind
Insanity made you blind
Awakening
Free your soul
Let your cold winds unfold
See the storm on the horizon
One man against it all
Without fear
Mind control
You are ready for your quest
Awakening
Free your mind
Insanity made you blind
Awakening
Free your soul
Let your cold winds unfold
Bloodline from the Stone Age
Primitive and old
Eyes like reptiles let you see
Brain mass blurs the imagery
I cannot hide from life or death
I want to be alone
My eyes can't see what you can see
I see no flesh or bones
Dig your way to misery
Spark eternal hatred
Burn all bridges
Set it free
Your time here has been altered <start> I watched you die as you left this world behind
Free from this filthy grave free from this world of pain
What do you feel when your last breath is real
Creature of the night
Your beauty humbles my existence
I felt the pain inside...
As I looked into your eyes
Death consumed them as they glistened
A reminder this is all we are...
Just flesh and bone
This is who we are...
Just shackled bones...
Called to the unknown
Forced to walk this path with no way to turn back.
There's no second chance....
Born into a world a fallen world of our ancient fathers
Your innocence is as pure as the air that escapes your lungs final breath tonight.
It's poetic
Like the glow of a midnight moon
Agony but I am here
Suffering but beast I am near <start> Regresando.
Donde duermen mis huesos.
El sol con su cachetada sacude mi plexo.
Obligndome a reflexionar
En que nadie me espera
Y en que corta es la vida
De muchachos calaveras.
Largas son las horas
cuando malo es el momento.
Relojes sin agujas desangran
un desmadre de silencios.
Y dormirme es lo primario
de mi elemental deseo.
Busco el sueo suplicando
con mil padrenuestros.
Me llegue
el sueo reparador.
O llegue
la extraterrestre abdiccin.
La vida no es lo que uno se cree
o lo que se imagina
es lo que es.
Tan slo eso es. <start> Instrumental <start> instrumental <start> I'm here in
I'm living
I'm dreaming
But you can't see me at all
I'm walking close to the wall
I'm here in
My breathing is my screaming
A half concealed look's my boldest
Approach to you
I talk barely
I wake up early
 hours fairly
with spiders of silent pain
weaving cold webs in my brain
I hold on still I long
For the dusk to come
Like after the longest war
A knight on this way home
Lord of an empty place
Reign of one alone
Sham is the only home
I'm feeling friendly
I'm feeling my own
Lord of an empty place
Reign of chill and ghosts
Stage with the curtain down
Where I play the main role
But no one's there to applaud
I've grown old
Thought my world's so cold
Since i fold myself round na icy core
I don't know what I'm living for
If only I'd showed you
How much I loved you
I'd be lord in real world too
A king for the time with you
Lord of an empty place
Reign of one alone
Sham is the only home
I'm feeling friendly
I'm feeling my own
Lord of an empty place
Reign of chill and ghosts
Stage with the curtain down
Where I play the main role
But no one's there to applaud
Take a bow a roaring crowd
Walls come crashing down
Raise your eyes
And find you're just all alone
Lord of an empty place
Reign of one alone
Open or closed it be
No one at the window
No one knocking at the door
Lord of an empty place
Reign of chill and ghosts
Stage with the curtain down
Where I play the main role
But no one's there to applaud <start> Instrumental <start> Staring back
Your disposition will be the end of you
Laying out this one condition
You're going no where
Break your teeth and pour out the lies
They keep on coming
I don't know why you'll never get it
'Til you're alone on an island skipping stones staring back
Staring back to nothing <start> I am the one that has chosen to lead
The power that grows within me
A force that has come to inherit the earth
My calling
A time and a place for sadistic intent
I know for when you will bleed
Saving your life is beyond your control
Wait for my eternal greed
Shortage of time you are next
Prepare to die
Power grows in my look to my supremacy
Force fed in line deathrow
Prepare to die
Coldblooded murderer
Strengthened by the massacre
Destroying the lives of the ones I forsake
Scour the earth as I take
Searching to quench thirst of my soul
It hungers
Cauldrons of blood filing up in the rim
Enemies die by my hand
Feeding is done nothing left but the bones
Left to rot and turn to sand
Building up the walls of the kingdom
Building up the walls of the king
Stronger I grow as I suck out your life
Pleading as I watch you kneel
Abduction of strength
I am now in command I rule
Cities of flesh lay in my path
Watch as the innocent die
My nation is built from
The souls of the dead
Born of life to terrify <start> Ten years ago
I got a call that nearly killed me
Repeat yourself my hands are shaking
When I was told my friend was gone
I felt so guilty
A thousand questions left unanswered

I'll serenade before I do

On and on although you're gone
Candles burn without a flame on
Our final call to you I know you're listening
How could you leave us that way
Where did you go ten years today
Ten years ago
I stood beside the wood that held you
I must sit down my legs are shaking
We let you go
With gifts of plectrums for your journey
And melodies to help you on your way

I'll serenade before I do

On and on although you're gone
Candles burn without a flame on
Our final call to you I know you're listening
How could you leave us that way
Where did you go ten years today
I'll bleed if you want me to

I'll bleed if you want me to
On and on although you're gone
Candles burn without a flame on
Our final call to you I know you're listening 
How could you leave us that way
Where did you go 
Where did you go 
Where did you go
How could you leave us that way
Where did you go ten years today <start> Panic fucking Bachmann just arrived all nations

Everyone loves me
Everyone dreads me
Everyone respects me
Soulless maybe a wizard
Free from... I'm just another god
Everyone knows him
Close at hand shades... a real presence
So far at the stars behind this closed door
A sensation The presence which gets away
Soulless maybe crazy
Free from... I'm just another... god 
I don't have my own existence
But alone I respond to more than a thousand names
I've never appeared physically
But they've portrayed me under multiple appearances
Nestled in your unconscious
I'm born with the night your night
From your obscurest thoughts
I stand out... master or fiend
I'm born with the night
I stand out mirror of your nightmares
I'm born with your night
Ecstasy's angel the Reign of Terror
I can exhaust my soul
I can deride your pride
I'm free from all beliefs
I'm just another god
Everyone knows him
Everyone loves him
Everyone dreads him
Everyone respects him
Soulless maybe crazy
Free from I'm just another god <start> I'd follow endlessly to live the life I've seen
Now every passing moment you die but one degree
Shall I relinquish my integrity
Thereby ensuring that I'll remain unclean
Until my days filled with not untrust and fear
I'll not make one vow to which I won't adhere
I didn't want it this way
But I've never wanted to stay
My life take not for granted yet
Nothings changed in me
The search for true perfection
Will lead me endlessly <start> Ce qui perdure depuis des sicles  Aujourd'hui n'est pas sur le point de prire   jamais l'humanit tournera en cercle  Sans chercher  comprendre le monde dans lequel elle est ne  Chaque tre nat en suivant un modle conu sur mesure  Satisfait par de faux besoins  L'acceptation fait ton succs  Avec facilit je suis droit le troupeau  Pas besoin de chercher je suis endoctrin  Les questions que je pose c'est le mal qui s'impose  Moins je rflchis moins je svis  Cette vote qui fait ombrage  l'imagination contrle tout un monde cltur de sanctions  Ce merveilleux systme qui nous appuie les uns contre les autres tient en fait que par un fil  Mais tous les hommes sont tous trop occups par l'argent pour prendre conscience d'la libert qui les attend  Tout a t maniganc pour que cette divine libert ne vienne pas gcher nos penses sans mme pouvoir l'imaginer  Trop de gens acceptent sans poser les questions qui leur permettraient de passer de l'autre ct  Certains mme ignorent qu'en dehors au del de cette dictature contraire  cette lgislature qu'ils croient si forte et si solide se trouve un monde de cration  Et si on osait affaiblir le mcanisme de la grande socit  Il suffit de dtruire le claveau faiblesse de ce rgiment  Pour qu'enfin on puisse s'crouler et refaire le monde  sa faon  Sans obir  une clef de vote. <start> Many a man bear the scars of laboring to pay a toll

Lay down the bible and take up the rifle
Our blood runs thick down the banks of the crooked creek
These grass roots have all been tilled for generations next in line
Our heaven will never be filled while death overfloweth the mines
The backs that break under the strain of burdens brought on by their lives
Are put out to fend off the rain oppression that cuts like a knife
Lay down the bible and take up the rifle
Our blood runs thick down the banks of the crooked creek

Around the necks the union symbol hangs like a noose

NICE DEVICE
NEVER WANT TO SLEEP WITH YOU AGAIN <start> Between the head and the hands must surely be an heart
Time and space is an illusion for man
One foot in the grave and one to start
Walking against the wind living by the night
We're all thick as thieves sometimes and I know it ain't right
It's in the cards written in the stars
Scratched on the walls of the bars man
Where demons dwell
Where demons dwell
Got scars in bars 
Broke bones in arms 
It's hunters moon and I'll be gone soon
You stare like a goat with a twisted smile
There's another motherfucker wants a fist fight
Bringing knives to a gun fight
We're all thick as thieves sometimes and I know it ain't right
It's in the cards written in the stars
Scratched on the walls of the bars man
Where demons dwell
Where demons dwell
It's in the cards written in the stars
Scratched on the walls of the bars man
Where demons dwell
Where demons dwell <start> She closed her dreams into her teardrops
from reality's sharpclawed demons
She hid her face of tearful eyes
from the scan of this grotesque world
As petals her wings are falling
like angelic curses from eternal welkin
her serene dreams are vanishing
exiled far from the frozen light
She held a dead rose in her hands
passing memory of a divine land
Her mate  darkness  adopted her
shielded her body so frail
Only one place to find peace
pleasant cradle of her dreams
a world within <start> Verse 
After balling I go clubbing

Fortune cookies tell my future

Yo

And some Wonton soup
Get me broccoli
While I play Monopoly
Don't be a busy bee
Cause it's your fantasy
To eat Chinese food
Egg roll and Chop Suey
I use the chopsticks
To eat pot sticks
Put some hot sauce and sweet and sour make it sweet
Because Chinese food takes away my stress
Now I'm going to go eat Panda Express

Some people try to differ from one another
To beat life's quiz is not an easy task
Hot pepper produce an unpleasant pain
Yet fools come back to feel the burn
Are we lost in the garden of hypocrisy
Now we have formed a riot against the masses
Information lost before it reach the point
Now we have formed a riot against the masses
Information lost before it reach the point
All system lock down
Go to self destruct
All system lock down
Go to self destruct
Always in a state of evolution
Some people try to differ from one another
An unpleasant pain when we feel the burn
The future is set the Earth is run by a nuclear sun
Leaders sit high as we live like worms
The circle is closed history reversed
All we have done for you to be
The world has become what we didn't see
It's time to rise there's no easy way out
Now we have formed a riot against the masses
Information lost before it reach the point

Are we lost in the garden of hypocrisy <start> The arrival of the dead mourning souls arise.
Searching for a way to reach humanity.
Couldn't stand the pain left our world too fast.
Caught in light so black and there ain't no turning back...
No
Escaping from the second sky souls cry in despair.
Forgotten lives surrounds me now.
But I don't know they're here.
Jealousy and utter hate fills their empty shell.
Longing back to mother earth where they all deceased.
How will I know who can tell when I'll die
Live live my friend till the end of all time.
No no way out from the spell where you're caught.
So we must be strong holding on to our lives.
Into the void.
Immortal souls will rise.
Rising from the dead.
Fooled by the stronger ones.
Confused they fly around.
Can't break free from the chains of death.
Chains that keep then bound.
They can't control their mourning souls.
Their mind is still alive.
Now they've seen their destiny.
And is trying to break free.
Stronger forces take control and bring them back to earth.
Hoping for a second chance.
Longing for a rebirth.
Life life ain't fair for thy one's who have lost <start> There is a land in the middle east region
ruled by black gold and a crazy religion
There is a satan with certain charisma
he instigates thousands to play the Kamikaze game
the tyrant has the power of words
His bible is built on barbaric foundations
laws from a forgotten century that live again
to die is a straight way to glory
Black widows march proclaim their own slavery
and even children grow to fighters in war
David fights Goliath Uncle Big Satan
the banner of the holy war
blood for blood
life for life
Mr. Inferno he is responsible
makes the blood boil in the veins of his land
Mr. Inferno he is responsible
Holding the lifes of his man in his hands
A hellish old man plans the overkill riot
he letz his land bleed till end in a war for his pride
it's his demonstration of might
The distinguised expression on face of the old man
his hiding ideas full of madness for a
damned deadly game
We won't retain to fight it back
save the ballance land he rules
We'll hold the power on the border
they've sworn the oath
and die on his order
Mr. Inferno he is responsible
makes the blood boil in the veins of his land
Mr. Inferno he is responsible
Holding the lifes of his man in his hands
So it's destroyed the work of a century
the iron towers melt down in the fire of hate
No survivor in a war out of gain
pain or glory described in the book of all fates
Mr. Inferno he is responsible
makes the blood boil in the veins of his land
Mr. Inferno he is responsible
Holding the lifes of his man in his hands

He is responsible <start> Under pressure
Under control
Feeding the living
With the limbs of the dead
Long before the dawning
Longing for the fall
Hell we keep the motor humming
I am humming running dry
Black on fire arrows
Aiming in the sky
Searching for a shelter home
Hiding from each other's pain
Wake me take me
Turn around and hate me
I may not be good company
But I can kill your apathy
Near the end of the stay
Near the bottom of the line
We all follow the animal
And escape the pain
Now tell me more about the girl
That I'm supposed to be
Sometimes it seems I've had enough
To make me walk away
If this is what you want
Then this is what you want
Who would even bother
Say who wouldn't want it too
Love controls with silence
As it does with words
You used to say that I have fire
Now you're gonna see me burn
Bleeding desire
Beat inside outside memory
Burning empire
Like a fever turning blood into fire
What I fake
In my head
Alone
Bleeds
Wherever
I go
Now is just
A matter of time
And we are less
Than a moment
Of high tension
Once bitten twice shy
One is wrong and almost done
One is one plus one plus one
One is one more than just none
Another is just one
Another is just one <start> One single night one single day
Before it all just sweeps away...
With the paradise I do not know
Through the joy I never had
I'm all alone on my isolated throne
Why have you forsaken me
The days outnumbered themselves into the grey
And life cries a dream dies out into the blackness
Stretches for an empty cup a chalice to collect the tears
That I keep to myself
I gaze upon the mystery this lovelorn identity...
Frozen beyond the echoes of laughter
This morphine cloud hanging over me
Like a snowwhite curtain
This beautiful haze overruns me
So I erase myself from you the cure for my sanity...
And here I am unwilling to forgive myself
So lost in this remedy your spirit is haunting me
consumed by indifference
I scream in your silence where shadows conceal me...
I'm cursed to search for you
Oh feeble ungrateful heart
Paralyzed you drown with me
Intoxicate this bitter reality
Under the screens of apathy
Oh feeble ungrateful heart
Paralyzed you drown with me
Intoxicate this bitter reality
Under the screens of apathy
The dream died before it was born
Innocence is lost...And so am I
But still I pretend to be strong
Still I wonder where I belong
You whisper to me gently in my sleep
To this world behind
And I gaze upon the mystery this lovelorn identity...
Frozen beyond the echoes of laughter <start> Wo schmerzlich Zeit musst heftig wogen
da thronet ein erforner Bogen.
Stille bereitet sich endlich an
mden Wandrern zart zu nahn.
Kein Lichtstrahl trifft die Schatten hier hinein
ins blaukristallne Kmmerlein. <start> These eyes they will gaze and reflect
And gauge every thought I reject
Now sway of stance in changing times
Just a narrow mind commanding respect
We stand on the words of the wise
And languish every call to despise
We know the hollow side of their lies
No reformed edition never losing vision
Now into forever only getting better
Ways of now spiral down
How much more we allow
Keeping sight of the vow we made
Never changing
Holding fast to the hope
Never losing ground
So when we stand in the line of wrath
Never changing
True and righteous will know
Never losing ground
The foundations that we used to uphold
Now regarded as the madness of old
Every alteration made to the standard of truth
Is a nail in the coffin we hold
We embody everything they despise
'Cause they see us through degenerate eyes
So when they cast you down as intolerant filth
Stand firm never bow to the lies
No reformed edition never losing vision
Now into forever only getting better
Ways of now spiral down
How much more we allow
Keeping sight of the vow we made
Never changing
Holding fast to the hope
Never losing ground
So when we stand in the line of wrath
Never changing
True and righteous will know
Never losing ground
See the scorn inside my eyes
No reformed edition never losing vision
Now into forever only getting better
Keeping sight of the vow we made
Holding fast to the hope
So when we stand in the line of wrath
Never changing
True and righteous will know
Never losing ground
Keeping sight of the vow we made
Never changing
Holding fast to the hope
Never losing ground
So when we stand in the line of wrath
Never changing
True and righteous will know
Never losing ground <start> Falling by numbers before my very eyes
The Kin of the Dragons I've slain by birthright
And seer grant me courage for I know not the peril
That lie ahead down my twisted path
... So rise oh Lord...
... Grant me strength to uphold...
Thy kingdom to come
Thy death be undone
Sleep no longer
For the land below both King and foe
Awaits this final day
And though fear roams I do know I do understand
What must be done...
Be seated be afraid for what may come this way
For behind these shutters and behind these doors
Our story's about to unfold
I gather the will to end my mission
With the seven witches tied at the stakes
And as the audience is ghasping for air
I prepare to revel in the flesh
And now the feast is here as the maidens fair
Are cleansed by the flames
Preordained
As I falter by every word
Summoning all but the Lord himself
For as the shape reveals as prophesied in the good book
It all seams somewhat twisted to what I've
Learned to believe to be the man not the beast
I've  somehow succumbed to without
Knowing what made me sacrifice
All that's dead to be by the hand of the Lord
... Oh Lord why have you turned on me
... Oh Lord you sought me out
Behind this curtain of my everyday life
And now it seams the only one to die
Is me... <start> I Remember

But I Can't I Can Never Say Goodbye
Cold Still Will Be My Friend
I'll See Your Frozen Tears.
Vault Of Desperation.
Chorus.
Nothing All Around Me
Nothing All Around Me
All Around Me Just A Vision
Just A Vision Slowly Kills Me
Slowly Kills Me From Inside
All That I Can See
Lost In Memory
The River's Flowing In To The Sea
The River's Flowing In Dying Quiet
Chorus.
Wishing You
To Take My Cry
I Keep On Seeing
In Other Eyes
I Keep On Seeing
In The Heart Of Nothing
Where The Lies
Trapped Your Spirit
Rumours Of Darkness
From Northern Story
Taking The Painting
Of Distant Lovers
I Sing In The Winter
Because I Need You
I Sing In The Winter
In The Frozen Memories.
Chorus
Dark Sirens In My Eyes. <start> The curse beyond expression
Disgrace over your head
Fear of meeting your downfall
Peace alone from human hand
The Magic  Flee from life
The Shadows  Time to say goodbye
The Sorrow  Revelation of the youth
The Curse  Look into the face of truth
Blood of your ancesters
Satisfaction for justice
In the face of anger  In the eyes of fury
The fight for eternal existence
The Magic  Flee from life
The Shadows  Time to say goodbye
The Sorrow  Revelation of the youth
The Curse  Look into the face of truth
Revenge of the preacher
Victory the goal of choice
Life blown out like a candle
The day will get you  say farewell
The Magic  Flee from life
The Shadows  Time to say goodbye
The Sorrow  Revelation of the youth
The Curse  Look into the face of truth
The Magic  Flee from life
The Shadows  Time to say goodbye
The Sorrow  Revelation of the youth
The Curse  Look into the face of truth <start> In a town in the east
The parishioners were visited upon
By a curious beast
And his eyes numbered but one and shone like the sun
And a glance beckoned the immediate loss
Of a cherished one
It was the coming of the
 Black Shuck
 Black Shuck
 That dog don't give a fuck
Black Shuck
 Black Shuck
 Black Shuck
 That dog don't give a fuck
Flames licked round the sacred spire
And the congregation's last line of defence
Was engulfed in fire
As the flaming priest stepped into the firing line
On the business end of despair
God he took his own life
During the coming of the

A nimbus of blue light surrounds a crimson paw
As he takes another fatal swipe
At the Blytheburgh Church Door

Woof <start> I am a box I am a screen
I'm every nightmare I'm every dream
I am the window over your land
So turn me on come take my hand
Don't push me
I offer you scandal I offer a wealth
Of gratuitous violence hazardous to your health
I give the vision of how life should be
I choose your heroes come follow me
Come follow me
It's just a box it's just a screen
It's only a nightmare it's only a dream
We give the vision of how life should be
We choose our own heroes come follow me <start> I said shut up
Everybody go Cary Grant's wedding
Champagne hip hip hooray
Thank you folks for coming today
How much was the price of the Dodge
Sure it's worth a whole lot more
I said go to Cary Grant's wedding
All you folks and fools
Cary Grant's Wedding
All you folks and fools
Have been invited to
A newwave personality
Stumbles out of the ruins
'cause he's been invited to
Cary Grant's wedding
Buster Keaton he turned up
He wasn't a woman
He didn't take hallucigens
A poor maid for Cary Grant
Slaughterer of innocents
Add on  years
And you've got Jake Burns
Goes from her
All you're going to
Cary Grant's wedding
A newwave Hollywood
Where everybody's good
But not great
Cary Grant's wedding <start> This mark of impailment burned
on my skin is immoral
The shackle of frailness confines one
to crawl with oneself
a smell of corrosion force
Fully clashes within
Sensorial conditions
Human emmisions grow thin
Chorus
It's burned on your head
It's burned on your skin
It's burned on your eyes
A barcode never lies
A symbol of power
As dark as the night
No measure for intolerance
We'll keep up the fight
This structure of violence
Now becomes Silence is hurtful
Beginning obsession we now
learned our lesson Despite
A world of dominance
Will now pervade
Clouds cover the sun
The light begins to fade
This toilsome aggression is
now getting harder to fight
Solutions of  combustion is right <start> I see the mighty fortress crumble tumble to the ground
Swarms of rumbling bumble bees consume the frantic crowd
Seething breeding mescaline drench the pretty girls
Boredom for excuse there's no more fun in the world
Me outside my window me inside my door
Inside or outside I don't give a fuck no more
Say I'm angry have a lousy attitude
It's hard to be optimistic when I share the world with you
Pretentious asshole time to move aside
Can't survive on your hypocrisy and lies
You're building up but you're tearing down
The mighty fortress crumbles tumbles to the ground
And I can't understand can't understand can't comprehend
Indifference to my fellow man no longer amused
Just pissed off and confused still I laugh
Me eyes are dry and I don't know why I wonder why...
And I'm so fucking happy <start> Music  lyrics by Stan Jones 
An old cowboy went out on a dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of redeyed cows he saw
Plowing through the ragged sky and up a cloudy draw.
Yippie ayeaaa yippie ayeooh.
Ghost riders in the sky.
Their brands were still on fire
and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shining
and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him
as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard
and he heard their mournful cry.
Yippie ayeaaa yippie ayeooh.
Ghost riders in the sky.
Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred
and shirts all soaked with sweat
They're riding hard to catch that head
but they ain't caught them yet
'cause they've got to ride forever
on that range up in the sky
On horses snorting as they ride
and hear their awful cry
Yippie ayeaaa yippie ayeooh.
Ghost riders in the sky.
As the riders loped on by him
he heard one calls his name
If you want to save your soul
from hell riding on your range
Then cowboy change your ways today
or with us you will ride
Trying to catch the devil's herd
across these endless skies
Yippie ayeaaa yippie ayeooh.
Ghost riders in the sky. <start> I can see through the veil
Seeing all I need to
Nothing is hidden here
Deep into the woods
Casting letters that speak of all
Is all is naught
No one but me
Knows of this place
The sanctuary
Where I construct
Where I construct
Dream dream while there is no strife
Anguish pulls no weight
One can see and the other is blind
Through the same pair of eyes
We have lost sight
Of the nightside of the self
Hunted by the fear of reunion
Nightsight is bliss
For he who dares look into
A world where you embrace the opposite
Where you are whole
There is no lasting joy
In numbness and dogma
Too much is too little in knowledge
Driven mystery
We have lost sight
Of the nightside of the self
Hunted by the fear of reunion
Nightsight is bliss
For he who dares look into
A world where you embrace the opposite
Where you are whole <start> Dawn of the biomachines
Experiments to spawn the new breed
Of half living creatures to butcher for organs
Transplants extend another's life span
Recreated twisted in neogod's hands
Animals physiologically altered
To increase their output for human usage
Left immobile as designed
Trapped in a tortuous unexistence
Monstrosities
Brought into being
Behind the walls of laboratories
Crimes go unseen
Dawn of the biomachines
Horrific cruelty inflicted
Demons in white coats leer down on their prey
Trapped in a hell on earth that's unknown
Not heard not seen until death they'll stay
Helpless beings brutalized by madmen
Trained to deny that they're even alive
The basic motive financial gain
Profit estimates drown the cries of pain
Monstrosities
Brought into being
Behind the walls of laboratories
Crimes go unseen
Medical research
Subjects aren't even seen as alive
Behold the dawn behold the dawn
Behold the dawn behold the dawn
Behold the dawn behold the dawn
Behold the dawn of the biomachines
Monstrosities
Brought into being
Behind the walls of laboratories
Crimes go unseen <start> La pilen vandre fra gud til gud

'Cause I'm aware of everyone and everything
They're everywhere
Don't be a fool
Stop spinning around
Spinning around
You're right it ain't safe here
Start using your brain
Your brain
The cautious hare
Cannot be seen as a coward
He's simply aware
He constantly knows what's going on
That the wheel of life turns on
It won't hold on
Silent creature
Filthy teacher's
Spreading the disease
A release
A vanished
Kingdom falls
It goes on
On and on
And again
It goes on
Round and round
Oh I can't get it out of my head
Wish I'd be a bird of prey
A pure and a blessed
A hawk who could ease the pain
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
A place in the dark
A song without hope
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
Oh I wait for an answer
So far
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
I will wait for an answer
So far
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
I will wait yes I will wait
Don't look back
We're the last descendants
In the line of valiant soldiers
We're mistreated angels
We are the blackbird nation
We're the chosen ones
We're the last descendants
We're a tribe of unsung glory
We are the fallen angels
Well the time is right
You shall be on my side
I don't I don't I don't need anyone
Be with or be against me
I'm white I am chosen
There is not the slightest
Doubt it all
Not at all
In lower airs
We're ground down
By their ignorance
Hate will grow like a foul cancer
To find a foe seems to be the answer
Round and round
Oh I can't get it out of my head
Wish I'd be a bird of prey
A pure and a blessed
A hawk who could ease the pain
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
A place in the dark
A song without hope
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
Oh I wait for an answer
So far
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
I will wait for an answer
So far
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
I will wait yes I will wait
Don't look back
Don't be a fool
Stop spinning around
Spinning around
Don't move it ain't safe here
They've stained holy grounds
Oh no
The hopeful he sadly admits
There's no hero no place to hide
There is no shelter from the storm
The maddened crow will spread terror
But I know
Bitterly they will stumble
Find themselves smashed on the ground
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
A place in the dark
A song without hope
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
Oh I wait for an answer
So far
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
I will wait for an answer
So far
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
I will wait yes I will wait
Don't look back
It's you who has said
There's no tomorrow
I don't know but who I am
I wouldn't sit back any longer
It's surely built in sadness
But the sadness surely will go by
So we will all know the answer
The answer's within
It's in your mind <start> Give me one more day. And i'll keep on running.
And i'll keep on hiding. I wish i could have stayed here with you.
I'm on the loose. Looking for the answers.
Looking for the madness. Once again i'll perish in doubt.
Give me one more day... another day... another night.
I'm runningrunning for cover.
I'm runningfar far away  for my life.
Running faster and faster and faster.
And falling. Far away.
Falling down one more day.
I need one more day. To dare my senses.
To cease from thinking.
It meant that much to me. A taste of shame.
Someone did it again. And i'll keep on hiding.
I wish i could have stayed with you. <start> Oh yeah fuck it
Yeah
Oh
I've got a killer's blood
Running deep inside my veins

Don't expect you to understand
I was born without a name

I see right through you your opinions are a fucking joke

I crucify you on a silver spoon I hope you choke
I'm tired of trying to please the world that spins around me
This time I'm doing it for me and me alone
I don't need anyone don't think I ever did
Not trying to be selfish just doing what I know
I'm a menace
Right
Oh
I'll fade the fuck away
Swear to God that I don't care

I'll die a lonely death cause I know that life ain't fair

I can't pretend that I am someone that I'm not
I live for me myself
You can't convince me that I'm wrong
I'm tired of trying to please the world that spins around me
This time I'm doing it for me and me alone
I don't need anyone don't think I ever did
Not trying to be selfish just doing what I know
I'm a menace
Right
Yeah
I'm tired of trying to please the world that spins around me

This time I'm doing it for me and me alone

I don't need anyone don't think I ever did
Not trying to be selfish just doing what I know
I'm a menace
I'm tired of trying to please the world that spins around me

This time I'm doing it for me and me alone

I don't need anyone don't think I ever did
Not trying to be selfish just doing what I know
I'm a menace
Fucking menace
Oh menace <start> The dark veil of a man's hate
Remains as the true glory
Within a warrior's heart
See the blackened sky
The ravens as they fly
Prophecy
Chaos and majesty
Revealed from the dust
Of village that fell
Under stormy skies
Flaming banners
On desolate land
Still  yet alive
Ancient symbols
Arise once more
Blazing  mighty
Empowered by darkness
Shattered remains
Pierced by deep earth
Dreams of mortals
Enclosed in flames
Ruptured images
Awaiting an end
The blood drips endlessly
From battle shrines
To feed the thirst
Of the barren war field
In union  yet desolate
In glory  yet sorrow
Beneath the skies we stand
Awaiting our reign <start> I am the one I am the one that you need
I am the one I am the one that you need
I am the one I am the one
The Devil's son has just begun
To shine to shine
I am the one to do the deed I am
I am the one to do the deed
I am the one to do the deed
I am the one
I am the one I am the one that you need
I am the one I am the one Two
I am the one I am the one
I am the one
The Devil's son has just begun
To shine to shine to shine
What's left unsaid
Yeah things come around
This is the one this is
This is the one this is
The Devil's son has just begun
To shine to shine to shine
Fire <start> two minutes

two minutes
it's all i need
it's not much to ask to ask for
there is nothing left
give all the chance 
i think you do the same
and i gonna take that
no way 
i cannot understand the reasons
and i cannot forgive you
i cannot understand the reasons
and i cant forgive
i cannot forgive you for what you've done
i cannot forgive you for what you've done
two minutes
give in to me
two minutes

i cannot understand the reasons
and i cannot forgive you
i cannot understand the reasons
and i cant forgive
i cannot forgive you for what you've done
i cannot forgive you for what you've done
screaming part
two minutes screaming at end <start> Stand for resurrection  I revive my tears
To feel the bolts of thunder  I fight to exist
Conceived to be rebellious  Persist in a war
Stridden on different path  I've got only scorn
Fighting at war with human waste
I'm burning obsolete ways
Ordered to lead the revolt
I fight to restore my worth
Absence in humanity
I will not stand in your normality
Burning worlds desire
I'm always standing higher
Revolt
Shadows of hate surrounding me
In a world where all is deceit
Aggression in sadness and laughter in pain
Takes control of life everyday
This war we can't ignore
Persevered among the dying souls
Resolved on our way
We must abide and we must adhere
Revolt
Stand for resurrection  I revive my tears
To feel the bolts of thunder  I fight to exist
Conceived to be rebellious  Persist in a war
Stridden on different path  I've got only scorn <start> This wasn't meant to be a love song
Matter of fact this one's about hate.
I fucking said it I don't regret it
A little much or a little too late.
I turned away just one too many times
I'm tired of the reasons sick of all the lies.
I looked away just one too many times
I'm tired of pretending that I'm not here not here to die.
You want my best you get the worst
You're not the last and you ain't the fucking first
You gotta live I live to die.
Still that motherfucker finger to the sky.
I turned away just one too many times
I'm tired of the reasons sick of all the lies.
I looked away just one too many times
I'm tired of pretending that I'm not here not here to die.
I've been hated by better
I've been beaten by the best
It's not a gift
It's a motherfucking test
I turned away just one too many times
I'm tired of the reasons sick of all the lies.
I looked away just one too many times
I'm tired of pretending that I'm not here not here to die.
Not here to die <start> Liar of a priest What could you want from thee is it so
Hard to see I will not believe the truth it sours inside
You hide your head the contradiction I curse your life
With dread
Your dead to me your light is greed leave me alone to
The unknown I have to leave the best to be beyond his
Gates without his grace.
In torment in hell uncontrolled and casting spells
Plotting death and suffering binding souls with misery
Burning Christians begging pleas satisfy my need to
Bleed trample on the lambs of god bow before thy lord
Satan
Stay away from god find out that you are human deity
Born to be deceived You worship cowards a cross for
Which he bled no more empowered the light of god is
Dead <start> This isn't over yet and we've only just begun to create this.
I thought I lost it all.
Not wrapped between the sheets.
Trust in me. You will see.
Believe in me and let the others have their way with you.
Your life forgotten empire erased.
Trust in me. You will see this victory.
We stop defeat this offering.
It must remain catastrophe in this city.
On this day catastrophe. It's still not over yet.
There's something left for the taking.
Forces of nature.
Ruler and judge when will the heavens open up.
Give me a reaction.
Give it all up.
This is the only way we can obey.
This is something that we will never win hope for defeat. <start> You sat there screaming but I couldn't understand.
It flowed from your mouth like a bad dream and it made me sick.
The air is thinning drowning in a sea of black.
You sat there screaming and I can't ignore it.
Words coated in shit I still get trapped.
And now im not returning cover my ears and close my eyes.
There was no connection i've broken the connection.
And now im not returning.
Cover my ears and close my eyes. <start> Open your mind and believe my sayings
Trying to find some reasons why
Eternally i'll pray to find a way to your faith
And pacify your heart
Let me find the door to take <start> So long I wish you well
Where I am going you cannot follow
I can feel them trying to change who I am
I can feel I can feel
I can feel them trying to break my will
I will not come back
But I still mourn
The death of a life
My life reborn
I can feel I'm changing
From me
So long I wish you well
Where I'm going you cannot follow
Temporary visit to see the sights of hell
I will not come back
But I still mourn
The death of a life
My life reborn
I say just fuck 'em all <start> A vision in the sky
Casting a shade on mother earth
They know what it will bring
But no belief  denying the truth
Fleeing creatures everywhere
Each possessed by tremendous fear
Crying like tormented souls
Wishing that they were never born
A thud impact
A raising mushroom cloud
High pressure is filling the air
A flash of fire is dragging life away
Nuclear warfare
Nuclear warfare
Sitting here in the cold
Watching the drizzling snow
Benumbed perceiving the fallout
Looking at the wasteland
You cannot see it
You cannot feel it
You cannot touch it
But it could let you die
You watch yourself and scare
The hair is gone
The skin is black
The radiation is a torment
A torture
Nuclear warfare
Nuclear warfare <start> The road is long
With many a winding turn
That leads us to who knows where
Who knows when
But I'm strong
Strong enough to carry him
He ain't heavy he's my brother
So on we go
His welfare is of my concern
No burden is he to bear
We'll get there
For I know
He would not encumber me
He ain't heavy he's my brother
He's my brother
He's my brother <start> Full moon is shining
so high in the sky
legions of black cloaks are
gathering tonight
Flames are now dancing
in the ancient oak forest
the stars are now in position
HE WILL COME
Been waiting for centuries
for this night to come
ancient dark gods guide
their knives
His spitefilled laughter
will fill the air
thy painful kingdom come
They gore themselves
in honour of return
a tribute to their cruel devotion
the chant will shatter
the doors of time
and their blood shall be the key
chorus
ComeFree from the shadows
Enter our world
give us your blessing
open the door
Come Out of the shadows
possessed by the trance
we will die
Come We bleed for your coming
intoxicate the essence of life
The thunder roars and all at once
a total eclipse of the moon
thier sacrifica is unrewarded
still dead bodies lay on the ground

I think they're just waiting to set something up
Ok
Shall we rehearse
Oh
Shall we rehearse <start> Music Magnusson Lyrics Magnusson Heidgert
We yearn for the battle and the glory...but my heart doesn't stray from home...
We're joined by the dwarves of the underworld the elves of
the deepest forests the highland barbarians and the knights of the most
radiant orders...
Together we will defend this world...
And victorious we shall be
Ride on...
We ride into the sunset
And race towards the dawn
We carry on beyond the horizon
Past the night to see the sun again
For the glory for the splendour
For the honour and the victory
We all hope that someday
We can live in peace again
But for now we must defend
Our people our homes and our lands
We raise our steel to the sky
Journey on with hope held high
Carry on carry on
Brave men you'll fight for your freedom
So Ride on ride on
Ride on with hope held high
Solo N.M E.H O.M
We leave our women and children
We leave them crying behind
But we'll return someday
With happiness and joy
For the glory for the splendour
Journey on with hope held high
Carry on carry on
Brave men you'll fight for your freedom
So Ride on ride on
Ride on with hope held high
With hope held high... <start> all circumstance is sabotage that which does not kill
us makes us stranger command chaotic brute force the
stars in your eyes stolen reprogrammed another
headless blunder with blood up its sleeves the priests
live in the towers they put thoughts in my head making
me sin while sinning through me mold the little shit
figure make it dance break its legs they call it
building character a villain to be exact <start> Sourceless rythmless heartless.
I scan the desert.
Since I in my beasthood saw the dancers there.
As my hands two tiny figures came visible
Like a carniver of flesh.
A union of monstrosities.
Curveless boundless eyeless.
I flee from the source of my agony.
Since I in my beasthood took form
In new alien anatomies.
My limbs towering mounting in celebration.
Murmuring the approval of new glories
New threats new intimacy.
With this I am fit to charm the Devil.
Sneering down my pale face.
I am erect with his anger and lust.
I am the grace of them all.
Still sneering drooling floating.
Breeding curves of hell.
And shreds of prehuman gloss.
This softens those songs to dust. <start> You were the world to me I thought that I would always be there
for you
I was too blind to see I would have clibed the highest mountain
for you
You gave me something to hope for you made me feel like new
But tonight it's over and we're through and we're through
I guess you've taken me for granted
You've filled my world full of lies
I want to know give me some answers
But you can't even look me in the eye
Well I've taken all the shit I will take from you
And I've only just begun to see the light
You're just a big disgrace
Turn around get out of my face
You've got no fuckin' class
Reptile you're a snake in the grass
All the times we had together
Were they real or just a fantasy
So tell me why I wasn't good enough for you
Just maybe you're not good enough for me
Well I've taken all the shit I will take from you
And I've only just begun to see the light
You've been running around having fun with anyone
I don't believe you have the right
Why tell me why you're crying
You've brought this on yourelf
Lie tell me why you're lying
It's time to put you on your shelf
Looks like I've taken you for granted
And I've seen right through your disguise
Tomorrow's going to be a better day for me
You can find someone else to victimize
Well I've taken all the shit I will take from you
And I've only just begun to see the light
You've been running around having fun with anyone
I don't believe you have the right
Why tell me why you're crying
You've brought this on yourelf
Lie tell me why you're lying
It's time to put you on your shelf
Well I've taken all the shit I will take from you
And I've only just begun to see the light
You've been running around having fun with anyone
I don't believe you have the right <start> Thriving on the hate that burns within my soul
Eyes rolled back with sheer disgust my heart is black
I have no home except the dark which is my mind
The downing of my life  is cold
Swarming mass of shadows breeding uncontrolled
Existing to despise and dwell in the darkest depths
Building hatred loathing for the pitiful
Ominous the shroud of black it makes me whole
Blackest of the black
Darkest of the dark <start> Ten heavy feet
Walks the blood soiled ground
With rhythm these
Five warriors march
No matter how much
The bleeding wounds
From enemy sword cuts
Hurts to the bone
The revenge they sought
Was taken in blood
No mercy was showed
No mercy was showed
They ignore the pain
That hammer like pounds
From falls off slain
Horses to the ground
No signs of weakness
No signs of weariness
Not even a glimpse
Of remorse in their eyes
They slew men ruthless
Fed the wolves with flesh
And now they leave
This land side by side
Now they're headed home
Five swordsmen who fought relentlessly
Their story will be told
Of five brave men endlessly
All sorrow is left
For the woman to bare
The children cries
They live in fear
No man was spread
No houses or farm remains
No christian woman unraped
Their church consumed by flames
Their steel shines red
With enemy blood
It sings of victory
Granted by the Gods
And as they return
Bleeding but proud
The horizon burns
And the song is ringing loud <start> i've distorted my flesh... I've open my veins. the twisted joy of my acts
are exalting my sense.
for tonight i meet my father SATAN...
Shall i stop or shall i purchase Kiss me deeply my blade
For Shall i weep but before my arms full of blood i shall distort my penis
and open thy legs OH
My bride gave me my new born messiah son for i must burn him now should i
wait a bit more...
CHORUS
Burn Baby Burn
Burn Baby Burn
lead by nornagest
Burn Baby Burn
WRAPPED IN FIRE
Now the almighty hellfire unleashed upon mankind the new born holy sons
will be consumed alive
into a black coffin and all humanity shall fade away... Alea jecta est ad
limina apostolorum...
BURN 
Ashes of the world dust of holy angels fade on the light forever...
Mors ultima ratio lex est quo notamus ad majorem SATANAE gloriam... BURN
I can feel the hatred the fire burns inside my heart
Incinerated bodies that burning smell excite me so much... BURN 
There's not enough humans to satisfy my pyrodesires kiss me deeply my
blade. For I Shall weep
but before i go my arms full of blood.
I SHALL BURN 
WRAPPED IN FIRE... WRAPPED IN FIRE... WRAPPED IN FIRE...
repeat chorus
Alea jecta...ad majorem SATANAE gloriam... <start> Now from a solar system
To another I fly
I come with life in my veins
Through darkened space I ran
I left a struggle behind
And faced the fear thats alive
I lost a world and traveled
Straight across from the sky
To find the gates of the heart
I come to Sirius see
To learn from you friends of old
And wish to come into being
And behold Im with you
I am ready now to go
The distance and even beyond
Recover all my forces
All the strength of the world
And feel the light into me
From the strength of god
We go to the power of goddess
This place is a throne
For brightness
The age of war is over
For gods sake
The have never heard of you
Youll never reach
This master race
Our force sickening
Killing all the time
Human laws
Already slayed many lives
There was a streak of madness
But now I know
I see its not the only truth
The scars in me are opened
Wont you please call me beyond
Crave affection love and courage
Being courageous
And flying instead of
Falling down
Follow these instructions
Ive been given
In this dream awake
There is no goal to reach now
Leviathans
No complaint it all
Dolphins from upper space
Are in front of me
In present they dwell
This is my way
Ive found my home
My state of real
There is no goal to reach
This is my way <start> Behold the light dividing the sky in two.
The mountains might you'll never make it thru
To the other side.
The night so cold you suffer from thirst and hunger.
Recall the stories told that haunted you when you were youn
Ger.
Wolves are howling in the dark
Evil leaves unholy mark.
As scar too severe to be healed
Rebuild the soul that have been peeled.
Chorus
There is nowhere you can hide
On the other side
The wise man never lied
Unholy soldiers ride
Through the forest wide
Here Where brave ones died
Like the light of day
You should have stayed away
Behold the sky the dawn of burning mist
As the ravens fly a sight you cannot resist.
Evil rules your mind.
March with fear the only way is ahead
Your final tear to evil you are wed.
Demons crawling on your way
Ending silently you lay
Presence of unholiness
The proof of your excess
Chorus <start> Kill a man and you are a murderer
Kill millions of men and you are a conqueror
Kill everyone and you are a God
Born of the best of enemies
Beyond the pearly constellations
Where in heaven has no embassy
And hope no surly grip on reason
Yahweh frankincense
Satan gold and murder
Yahweh frankincense
Satan gold and murder
He is sly bejeweled with sylph
Slick limbs spread wide
To guide you through the filth
And rust crawl to him fueled by lust
He's the horned one in the pentagram
A waste of chaos by the gram
Dark eyes for trouble
Double damned despair
The storm upon lake Lachrymose
Restless never comatose
The thorn upon
The single rose we share
Germination
His a renegade a Capella now obeyed
A shitstorm without warning
The pleasuit King in yellow on parade
Son of the thunderous morning
Yahweh frankincense
Satan gold and murder
Yahweh frankincense
Satan gold and murder
He is high inured with vice
The towercree er on our edelweiss career
A foreign power cut of utter fear
Taught curiosity he s atrocity banned
The taste of chaos by the dram
A tortured course like slaughtered lamb
Best rare
The curse that haunts this thirsting tomb
Disturbed becomes the worst of doom
Rehearsing all his worth for soon he's there
Extermination
He is hatred greed and war
He is everything we ought abhor
Were it not for the fateful truth be sure
We suffer him all the more
And lo his tyrant's eye
Is fixed upon our rich and vibrant sky
Now hear the wind
Herald desolation
As on that eve when angels clad
In nothing but their whispered virtues
They slipped into the valley
Of the dirty serpentine
Hes the horned one in the pentagram
A waste of chaos by the gram
Dark eyes for trouble
Double damned despair
The storm upon lake Lachrymose
Restless never comatose
The thorn upon
The single rose we share
Desperation
Disdainful he selfdeprecates
The mirror's jagged stare
And it's painful how we subjugate
The grinning face reflected in there

you can't understand. Doing stuff that someone says.
It seems you cannot stop. Can't get enough. Mislead
false belief. Not understanding your own grief.
Compromise you've only seen true lies. A controlled
existence within the mind. Corrupting morality of the
heartless torn apart the will is weak only the strong
survive. All is wrong can't comprehend. Don't know
what is real. Bodies are numb they cannot feel.
Manipulation of a population is so unreal so unreal.
Mortal hell. Your feeling anxiety. Confusion. Emotions
of a madman nervous breakdown. Shreds of insanity.
What I've done I was compelled to do. Echoes of cries.
The screaming will soon be dead. Speaker of lies
bringer of true darkness. The forever people shall
drink of bitter waters. Swarming like locust from
darkened skies Plaguing civilization. Burning whispers
of the four winds. Vivid imagination. Only sees what

Entwine a million souls to fight
As we change gear to overdrive
We raise our voices in fear  Unite
Until the threats declined  Delivered
It's an alliance intertwined
Define sensational The actions of a lie
It's like a mirror Crushed in thousand pieces
We're so irrational Your rules do not apply
Confirm your clarity And face a forced divinity
Subjective mental disdain  Regain
Retain the clutch of the pain  Denial
I'm underestimated
Oh why
Won't you believe
Accuse me and strip me of my liberty
Hey look here follow me
It's an ordinary abnormality
Survived a miracle
Dramatically revived
We pull the trigger
Burst into thousand pieces
We're so adaptable
That we could change disguise
Confirm your clarity
And face a forced divinity
The bells will sing as you cry  You die
Unleash your bestial pride  Forever

Restrain the light that burns
Endure the darkest side of fame

Oceans deeper than sorrow
A distance of furious dreams
Random fields of tension
Where the sun comes blinding

Followed the solar dimensions of time
I have seen all the rivers stream
Yes back to the end of the circle
Rivers longer than blood can flow
Horizons wider than complete wisdom
A distance of furious dreams
Isolated fields in convulsive motion
A distance of furious dreams
Random fields of tension
Where the moon comes glaring
When the sun goes dying
I have seen the chaos in every course
Followed the solar dimensions of time
I have seen all the rivers stream
Yes back to the end of the circle

I can taste the soil
I can tame all fire
I can spill all the water
I am the spine of the reversal nature
The blinding forces of complete defeat
Trace the universal steps
The shores by the course <start> Perversity lust decadence
Mankind's prior frustration
My mind hardly can comprehend
Mating the sole destination
This decline of romanticism
I do regret indeed
Replaced by forms of fetishism
It makes my heart bleed
Born in a wrong century
A label that I gladly wear
For there should be room for mystery
And to touch a soulmate's hair
Eroticism a fine form of art
But why share it with the world
For I care for matters of the heart
In this st century world
This decline of romanticism
I do regret indeed
Replaced by forms of fetishism
It makes my heart bleed
Born in a wrong century
A label that I gladly wear
For there should be room for mystery

But they control sloppily stupidly.
Keep that golden celebrity character to your own conscience
Take a breath and rest your jaw
A Vertebrae with no spine.
Our entertainment A mockery
With every laugh and every joke the actor's lungs become more dense with damnation.
Don't mistake my intentions for superiority let's make that clear.
This isn't right and the worst part is were not pretending.
Don't memorize these names
Eternally.
This world will run dry and well watch the clock
Well watch what we'll become.
Don't memorize these names
Eternally.

To everyone to everyone
Go ahead partake in it
Justify it
Become engulfed in it

This is not a one way road
You're headed for the dead end
This is not a one way road
You're headed for the dead end
You might think you're everything to everyone
Well pardon me if I intrude
You might think you're everything to everyone
You're not a perfect man in a perfect world
Look at where your ignorance has brought you
All this will be buried like the fall of Rome
Look at where your ignorance has brought you
You will come crashing down
The truth hurts the truth hurts
The truth hurts the truth hurts
The truth hurts the truth hurts
But denial's what will kill you
All that you loved
All that you treasure
Will pass with time
Will pass with time
Blinded by the inability to see
Beyond flesh and blood

i know my inspiration's dead

and luckily we just have
one throat to choke <start> World Eater
As silence roared through the gathered masses
You stared awaiting eagerly
Approaching darkness decreasing your life expectancy
The tension is now rising
The calm before the storm
See you life flash before you
Will you live to see the dawn
The enemy is now approaching
With bloodlust in their eyes
Intense fear is overcoming
For now death  You will defy
As the battle raged all dead and wounded
Bodies carnage all you see
The white hot blast  Melting flesh
The searing pain is agony
You stand alone
The final parody
As you realise  Your mortality
For you cannot chance your destiny
To die at the hands  Of the unknown enemy
Your death  You can't deter
As the silence  Returns

Home for the wandering man
Dreaming fells with skies so pale
Calm is the glorious land
Flames will send the sign to the sky
That we have come to feast tonight
The lakes are echoing with our song
Shadows are dancing on the forest walls
Enchantment of the fire and moon
Lost in the whispering night
The raven's magic enthralls the woods
Crawling in the sweet starlight
We have gathered in this distant land
Full of wisdom secrets and tales
The morning will never rise again
Roaming wolves are howling for the dead
LAI LAI HEI <start> Words Never thought for a long time
Never spoken Crawling in my mind
Brought to life by their own demise
Their feeble lies

Remeber those days It's never the same again
Hate I feel the demon growing strong inside
Vengeance is screaming in my blood
Like thunder roaring in the sky
The burning sky... <start> I'm a revelation of your future and past

Unfulfilled empty promises mind destroyer

No meaning to this life

Better take cover
Got some advice
You'd better think twice
Arrow's in the quiver

Find them on the drugstore rack
Safe sex
If I abstain
I'll go insane
Safe sex
Give me sleaze
And not disease

Vacuum packed for your protection
Sanitized to fight infection <start> bonus track
In the silence of the darkness when all are fast asleep
I live inside a dream calling to your spirit
As a sail calls the wind hear the angels sing
Far beyond the sun across the western sky
Reach into the blackness find a silver line
In a voice I whisper a candle in the night
We'll carry all our dreams on a single beam of light
Close your eyes look into the dream
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins there another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind
Falling stars now light my way
My life was written on the wind
Clouds above clouds below
High ascend the dreams within
When the wind fills the sky the clouds will move aside
And there will be the road to all our dreams
For any day that stings two better days it brings
Nothing is as bad as it seems
Close your eyes look into the dream
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins there another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind <start> On the day of the De Danann rule
Breas ruled the pagan lands.
He led his people as a fool
under the shadow of Balors hand.
The Tuatha De lived a life of pain
in body and spirit their weakness grew
as though their battle was in vain
this can't go on the people knew.
Dagda All father once God and provider
fell into disgrace with the king.
The food he recieved would not feed a spider.
The best pieces Cridinbel would win.
Aengus was shoked by the state of his father
Crindinbel must die He did say.
He put gold in the food and the food on the platter
Crindinbel fell dead on that sacred day.
Nuada awoke from the otherworld dream
his hand was forged by the gods
water was brought from the healing stream
You will be king. He nods.
Breas journied to the Fomor lands.
And met his Fomorian father.
They held each other in their hands
their kinship would stay hereafter.
The IlDana came to meet with Nuada
the greatest hero of the Tuatha De
The Fomor arrived for their early tax
these savages IlDana did slay.
Balor declared war and sent his tribes
Nuada prepared as did the scribes
Samhain approached and tensions were high
Dagda went to the Fomor spy.
Breas the dishonoured led a Fomor invasion
the IlDana won this first battle occasion.
Back to Moytura the De Danann returned
they set up camp and the pagan fires burned
the first day of battle was a mighty event
druids were chanting as the scouts forth were sent.
A great clash of shields
cries of was frenzy
blood fell on fields
each warrior the enemy.
Nuada killed Indech
the king of the Fomor
the worm god was unleashed
with a taste for war.
Nuada raised his sword of light
against the mighty Cromcruach
Balor caught uhim in his sight
Nuada died a hero's death.
But Balor to the ground was cast
IlDana was the new high king
De Danann heroes won at last
never again to laugh and sing. <start> Basicly I was just born bastard long for green pastures

Anybody could perfrom like a charm when the waters calm
Ya'll don't know nathan 'bout the things I've been faced with
Can ya'll relate how I came from the basement
I make the music and the same time faced it
I've been so close to my dreams I can taste it
Come on and punish me the only thing that keeps me sane
I look to you for things I can not change
I need your blessing do you approve
My best was never good enough for you
So this is how it feels and it doesn't feel so good
To know you couldnt give enough after giving all you could
Its been raining for so long its like the sun will never shine
I've been losing for so long I think I fell too far behind
I've swam beneath the icy waters not comming up for air
I've spent my whole life living for those who didn't even care
So this is how it feels and it doesn't feel so good
To know you couldnt give enough after giving all you could
Its been raining for so long its like the sun will never shine
I've been losing for so long I think I fell too far behind
I sat and thought for a while today
I got depressed and put the smiles away 'cause I've been struggling
Since back in my childhood days I've been walkin' since forever still Im miles away
Maybe ya'll never forgave for my wilder days even though now Im more wise in my ways Im losing faith in myself
Sometimes I doubt I'll even make it myself
Whose gonna give it to me if I don't take it myself
Come on and punish me the only thing that keeps me sane
I look to you for things I can not change
I need your blessing do you approve
My best was never good enough for you
So this is how it feels and it doesn't feel so good
To know you couldnt give enough after giving all you could
Its been raining for so long its like the sun will never shine

Midsummer I wave
A 'V' of black swans
On with hope to the grave
And through red September
When skies firepaved
I begged you appear
Like a Incomprehensible ones
Cold was my soul
Untold was the pain
I faced when you left me
A rose in the rain
So I swore to the razor
That never enchained
Would your dark nails of faith
Be pushed through my veins again
Bared on your tomb
I am a prayer for your loneliness
And would you ever soon
Come above unto me
For once upon a time
From the binds of your loneliness
I could always find
The right slot for your sacred key
Six feet deep is the incision
In my heart that barless prison
Discolors all with tunnel vision
Sunsetter nymphetamine
Sick and weak from my condition
This lust this vampiric addiction
To her alone in full submission
None better nymphetamine
Nymphetamine nymphetamine

Wracked with your charm I'm circled like prey
Back in the forest where whispers persuade
More sugar trails more white lady laid
Than pillars of salt
Fall to my arms
Hold their mesmeric sway
And dance out to the moon
As we did in those golden days
Christening stars
I remember the way
We were needle and spoon
Mislaid in the burning hay
Bared on your tomb
I am a prayer for your loneliness
And would you ever soon
Come above unto me
For once upon a time
From the bind of your holiness
I could always find
The right slot for your sacred key
Six feet deep is the incision
In my heart that barless prison
Discolors all with tunnel vision

In fear and anger
I'll lay down my head
A faithless spirit in a broken man
Everything is burning
Rotten flesh keeps burning
It's MY LAST SUNRISE in fear
The grail's in pieces
All the bliss is gone
The rose has dried out
And the lamb got slaughtered long ago
The hope became another lie
Like the nonexisting father god
I'll close my eyes goodbye
Don't wait for me on the other side
Everything is burning
Rotten flesh keeps burning
It's MY LAST SUNRISE in fear
Don't wait for me on the other side
Golgotha  had seen nothing else but
A carpenter's death
Golgotha  not more maybe not even that

Have driven me insane

To the Gods of fire and ice I will pray
The baptism of blood will now be done
Appeasing their anger with the blood from my wrist
Begging for their mercy from death I'll be kissed
Ascending the altar the last step for my flesh
Oppressive silence surrounds me on this holy place
Now I am feeling the cold wrath of darkness
Forcing me to breathe the odour of putrefaction
Blazing in moonlight
The knife cuts slowly through my veins
I fill the chalice with bloodred wine
This my life will soon be thine
Burn my body  ashes to the past
Leave your soul behind  what was once will ever last

Diversion covert discrete conquered from within
Disown failure no recourse disavow the structure
How could they not know not see
Now broken promise this legacy
Intent to save consuming everything
Before us deceived
No remorse no shame for the failure
Sold out country greased palms for special treatment
Populate the weak mind
When all seems lost we count the cost
We still remain connected
We'll be made strong we are not wrong
We will not be neglected
Utopia false destiny
Now propaganda the lies deceive
When all is given the structure will be torn
Asunder and fall
When all seems lost we count the cost
We still remain connected
We'll be made strong we are not wrong
We will not be neglected
Now take this doubt and cast it out
Weakness will be rejected
And through all wrongs we must stay strong
We will not be neglected
We will not be neglected
We will not be neglected
We will not be neglected
Oh we stop society's decay
We must create
Prevail <start> Strenghtened bravemen hearts
Ride with the pale moon
Reach for the source of wisdom
In the glare of the guiding star
Visions of a pure land
As fires haunt
The chains are unbound
The visions shall be true
A throne is risen
For the bravehearted northmen
Sprung out of the source of wisdom
With pure pagan blood
Ages of the elders return
Fallen upon the traitor's hand
The curs shall be slain
Stain by the Hammer of pride

I want to lose my head go for the bat and crush your head
Relax for a while think it over
All the vicious circles I'm trembling in are going further down
The last words you ever spoke still echo in my head
The world has turned and left me here
So stiff and cold
Find hope find a cure find happiness
For my ragged tortured soul
Tell the world I'm sorry
For blowing it all away
Tell the world I'm sorry
When I'm out of your way
I can feel the weight of the world on my soldiers
And it's crushing me
Faith is not enough give me strength so my heart
Can keep pounding on
It's time to step back a minute or two
To think it over
All the vicious circles I'm trembling in
Are going further down <start> I killed myself today
I wish I could explain
I tried to find another way to tell you how I feel it
I tried to find another way to make you proud of me
I'm numb from kneeling
This cut's too deep for healing
Revealing there's something amiss
Something you missed
Transfer the shame
You will never be the same
I will not accept the blame
'Cause I am what you made me
It's over now
What I've seen makes me

Pray for things I know

To change me make me a whole

My life's so full of shit

In death is where I fit
I killed myself today
I wish I could remain
I tried to find another way to let myself go free
There seems to be no other way to make things right in me
I can't awaken my life has been forsaken
I've taken the easy way out the only way out
Empty my wrist we could never coexist
I will not let this persist 'cause I am what you made me
It's over now
What I've seen makes me

Pray for things I know

To change me make me a whole

Ready for sucking
Ready to die when I'm done
Copulate and kill without reason

As long as they make me cum
Bitches have no power of reason
Never believe 'em just kill and fuck
For fun
You're faceless
You can't fuck anymore
And nameless Sodom was too good for

Skull fucked fuck your fucking face

Midsummer I wave
A 'V' of black swans
On with hope to the grave
And through red September
When skies firepaved
I begged you appear
Like a thorn for the holy ones
Cold was my soul
Untold was the pain
I faced when you left me
A rose in the rain
So I swore to the razor
That never enchained
Would your dark nails of faith
Be pushed through my veins again
Bared on your tomb
I am a prayer for your loneliness
And would you ever soon
Come above unto me
For once upon a time
From the binds of your loneliness
I could always find
The right slot for your sacred key
Six feet deep is the incision
In my heart that barless prison
Discolors all with tunnel vision
Sunsetter nymphetamine
Sick and weak from my condition
This lust this vampiric addiction
To her alone in full submission

Wracked with your charm I'm circled like prey
Back in the forest where whispers persuade
More sugar trails more white lady laid
Than pillars of salt
Fall to my arms
Hold their mesmeric sway
And dance out to the moon
As we did in those golden days
Christening stars
I remember the way
We were needle and spoon
Mislaid in the burning hay
Bared on your tomb
I am a prayer for your loneliness
And would you ever soon
Come above unto me
For once upon a time
From the bind of your holiness
I could always find
The right slot for your sacred key
Six feet deep is the incision
In my heart that barless prison
Discolors all with tunnel vision

Among the blackness icy previaled
I draw the black curtain of death
thousand of lost souls fallen
in the depth of the crypts of pain
through the voices of the past.
The angles of damnation follow me
travel through the  lost paths
the huge black forests
during the eternal nights of a funeral winter.
Drowned in the shadow
light the kingdom of deads
has condemned my soul
has haunted the hibernal forests
My coffin burn in a chapel
by the flames of damnation
will still remain now and forever
in a ceremony of the shadows of the past.
..And the souls will recall the way of my cremation
with the singing the voices of the night
on the threshold at the gates of the kingdom
of the shadows behold the moonlike throne.
I cry for my anterior life
but at dawn of my rebirth
and by the power of my blasphemy
I raise with the forces of evil
my curse is eternal

The wolves howling their song
towards the gates of hell
the Northern abysses let to hear
among these leed north winds
the weeps of victims sacrificed
to bloody rites of ShubNiggurath
the black goat of the eternal woods.
When the night is deep
and the sun is in the sign of Ram
the chant of darkness will be uttered
towards the Northern winds.
The key will be turned

Yo this is the gkagkagenius
And I got the brotha prince rakeem on the side
You know we got the sess bones in the house
And yo God i'ma pass you the bone
Pass the bone kid pass the bone
Pass the bone kid pass the bone
Pass the bone kid pass the bone
Pass the bone so I can rule the micraphone
Verse one prince rakeem
Rakeem is feelin lovely word a pocket full of dough
A little drunk reaction's mad slow
Thinkin should I go to the club scene
And do what and bag a rubadub queen
Another thing beyond the cream I wanted to get ripped
Put my lips on a blunt tip
It's been two weeks since I last sparked it
Went down to the club floors
Five dollar fee plus id
But a brother like me gassed his way in for free
Word took a bar seat
Got a tall glass of sex on the beach
Turned to my left saw this girl she was slammin sir
Oooh what ya do kid I examined her
Pushed up I tried to bag her for her name
What happened I didn't have the game
Overwhelmed by a scent in the air
Could it be yes yeah a potent bag of sess there
It was raekwon and loud jerome
They had a bone you mean a blunt a palmetto
I said pass the bone pass the bone
Pass the bone kid pass the bone
They passed it took one pull I was blasted
Felt kind of stimulated fantastic
We approached the weak cypher
Did you surprise her I tranquilized her
Bagged her for her name and address
Slid to her rest acheived mad success
But did you bone her did I bone her
Did I bone her you shoulda heard her moan
Pass the bone pass the bone
Pass the bone kid pass the bone
Pass the bone kid pass the bone
Yo genius flip the micraphone
Verse two genius
Yo pass the bone kid pass the bone
Pass the bone kid pass the bone
Pass the bone kid pass the bone
Pass the bone so I control the micraphone
Yo check it
Outside a nightclub what we shine some young bloods
Drinkin forties right down to the suds
Ready to flow inside and rip the mic phone
Hmm and all I needed was a sess bone
And guess who come down the block stumbling drunk
Ason with two bags of skunk
Pull out the blunt put the weed inside
Roll it up tight then the flame was applied
Inhale but not pertaining to cough
Exhale you know like two pulls and off
Stimulated kind of toxie
Seen a girl who was foxy yo but she needed
Oxywash oh my gosh yo not to disrespect
But back to the subject
The brothers rolled up on the scene that I had known
Smelled the skunk and said yo pass the bone
I said lounge g there's not enough to pass around
So go get a bag from uptown
I gave a pound to the brothers who was sweatin
What about the wisdoms yo they was stressin me
hey genius genius when ya come do me
Step to me you know screw me
Just another red bone that I had bagged in the red zone
And took home to get my head flown
Forget about the weak cypher so I slid to the back
Leavin tracks of smoke stacks
That originated from the sess crops
Give me the mic and watch me get props
Pass the bone yo kid pass the bone
Pass the bone kid pass the bone 
Pass the bone so I control the microphone <start> Close your eyes what do you see

It makes the passion burn in me
Life it always withers away
Death will eternally stay
Corpses in their coffins
Forever rest in peace
There sleeping with the aspergillus
Is this justice to the dead
The atrocious sight of burial ecremony
Christians weeping for the departed
They won't understand they should envy them
The deceased they know if there's a paradise
Or shall we feel the purgatory
I open the graves admire the rot
I can feel the presence of something beyond
Aureola of nauseating reek
Wings of shriveled skin
Holy beauty of a carcass
Divine sight for me to gaze upon

Necrolatic reverence for the stench

I pray before the dead

Unnamed graves
No light can reach there

And eternal wind

Of those who are now buried in time

A Righteous mind
No sign of fear
Cast aside
Left to die
Just one frozen tear
Unsung heroes
Forgotten valour
Unknown soldiers
Entombed in time
Only shadows grow
Where the forsaken lie
Hope buried in snow
A thousand scars
Regret none
But only the dead ones

What do you know about the truth
Devalued as soon as we're cast

Just bodies made and fabricated

Under the surface we're not machines
Under the surface we're living dreams
Death lives just one breath away
Somewhere my heart beats in silence
I made my way through the violence
Nobody lives forever
It's a shame you won't live. But then again who does
My endless will for resolution
Echoing since my creation
I'm living for my expiration <start> To gods of war

For everytime you try to make me loosen your leash
You know I'll have to punish you
You look at me and throw yourself at me feet
Hoping I might pat you on the back
But I'm not gonna go there I won't fall for that
Not until you cut me some slack
But you're still my bitch <start> No I don't care what they want
I'll never be what you want me to be

Don't give a fuck what you think

Just get the fuck away from me

I swear I tried my best to ignore it all

But it's too late
I want to spit the poison back in your face
No I don't care what they want
I'll never be what you want me to be
Don't give a fuck what you think
Just get the fuck away from me
That's the way of the world
They want to see you live on your knees
When you refuse to conform another door shuts 
No I don't care what they want
I'll never be what you want me to be

Don't give a fuck what you think

Just get the fuck away from me

Yeah you can beg all you want
Cause nothing is going to fucking change
You sealed your fate the day you crossed me
This is my message to a dying world
I fucking hate you
You'll get what you deserve
This is my message to a dying world
I fucking hate you
You'll get what you deserve

This is my message to a dying world

I fucking hate you
You'll get what you deserve

This is my message to a dying world
I fucking hate you
You'll get what you deserve

Left to dirt feed the slime absorb into the sand.
Scratch the ground mute among others joint like a blent.
Ramming a bat in her cunt.
Wrecking as deserving her pleasure.
Stretch no tear it up.
No pain Damn you dryout slut.
Well...

Cause she doesn't blow

Scissors to let her look nice.
Redness between her wellshaped legs.
Still a laugh on her face.
More pain she will get
Left to dirt feed the slime absorb into the sand.
Scratch the ground mute among others joint like a blent.
x <start> Lost in an empty room
The scent of her perfume
Has guided me so far away
Hard to face another day
Time does not help to mend
Continue to pretend
That you can cure as you redeem
Everything's not what it seems
You've been gone for so long
Things have changed not the same
Seems to be that you have lost the way
Those tears have come start falling
Tears have come come crawling
Tears have come
Inept forsaken star
A plan to take us far
A stolen dream is not the same
Dying scream that can't remain
Return to our descent
Follow it to the end
You cannot hide so please don't try
It's hard to stop when you're alive
When you're gone for so long
Something's changed very wrong
You don't see but things are not the same
Those tears have come start falling
Tears have come come crawling
Tears have come
I tried my best to do your part
And in return you crushed my heart
No one will ever see your star
Up and down all around
Close the blind you'll be fine
Touch my heart steal my soul
Now there's nothing to console
Things have changed very strange
Now you're gone seems deranged
Together we were always to remain gone
Those tears have come start falling
Tears have come come crawling
Tears have come <start> There's an evil wind blowing through my soul
a firestorm that makes the mountains roll.
I can feel his might from day to night.
The fires of hell I can see them burning bright.
The time has come to take me away.
Way down deep to where the demons stay.
This day I see is my last up here.
I have no guilt and I have no fear.
I am off the earth. I am off the border.
I am never to return.
Victimized I am his chosen
In hell I shall burn.
Chorus
I AM SACRIFICED.
Deeper down down deeper down down deeper down.
Deeper down.
repeat
I seek for cold in this world of heat
no longer a man in this world I am meat.
I have to pay for all human sins
in this world where only evil wins.
Where evil wins.
I am off the earth. I am off the border.
I am never to return.
Victimized I am his chosen.
In hell I shall burn.
Chorus
The thunder strikes much louder here...
The rain is boiling tears.
You can never guess what hell is like.
Until you're lying in his hearse
chorus <start> Victims of damnation drowning in the lies. Fallen angels of torment father cease the cries. In our time we've slaughtered the innocent raped the world in our discontent. God's creation in disarrary by the father we have betrayed. Need proof just look to our past strangled life amidst our grasp. Self destruction we're lost to see take and take for all our needs. In a time of innocence we have poisoned the Earth. Destroyed the innocent disgraced our birth. Revenge upon us by the father's hand. Witness to apocalypse and the downfall of man. All out war war. All out war redemption for the innocent and the seekers of peace. Ignorance tomb of the masses reaping the piles inside. Wreaking to divine intervention by the father's hand. Welcome to the days of affliction and the downfall of man. Sky's are burning as blood flows. Lost in torment our lost souls creation is in flames. Man's existence is to blame <start> Lessen programs promoting contraception
If it means protection in the next election
Religious groups will keep sending those checks in
So we can start wars and keep sending those jets in
Exactly just what kinda shit did we step in
Exactly just what kinda message we sending
It don't matter if you condemn condoms
It ain't your problem
It's the type of thing that only happens in Harlem
Happens in Compton happens in Newark
It happens in Houston I think we got a problem Houston
Invoke God to camouflage your true sins
Poke and prod private life intrusions
You say it's for our safety when you spy our movements
Huh well I don't buy it doofus
I ain't stupid this is my two cents

Let's spend some real money on real life improvements
Instead of moon men and booing same sex unions
We need to take a look at why society is losing
One room shack a single mother with two kids
They share the same bed and the walls are too thin
So they hear every fight
Fourth grade kids who cant read or write
And all they ever hear is mommy beat at night
They cant sleep at night they cant catch no Z's
So what the fuck they care about the ABC's
It's crazy kids in grades 
Trying to decide whether to be a B or C
Their stomachs are empty theres not enough MD's
But we can spend millions chasing WMD's
Or we can just build a pipeline in the MidEast
And when the bill comes send it to me
You don't know what it's like to pray
You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like to pray
For God to turn the night to day
You don't know what it's like to pray
You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like to pray
For God to turn the night to day <start> Embers burn and light the way to take the steps of those before you
Fearing life and taking what was never yours is far from graceful
Now you'll suffer I'll burn all the memories that you've held on to
Wanting waiting wasting all your life with such anticipation
Blowing out the flames of life it's time
Burning all your flesh I watch the flames turn white
Didn't even ever think to ask you why
Will this stop the lies
Thinking that your life had meaning
That it was someting great
Why don't I choose to believe
You will never convince me
Burn the hatred
Burn the evil
Burn the bitch
It's almost done
Burn the lies
Burn the deception
Burn it all
I'm far from done
Always wanting never learning and you never made the time
Till your life's sudden ending came and now you live to die
Trapped in what you thought it could never ever be worse
Than the life full of misery that you had upon this earth
Searching for the ultimate escape you think you've found
Now you're just a rotting corpse as you lie there in the ground
This is all is and now you've only had to die
This all there is and now there's nothing
You're... The only one
You... The only one
When you're safe we'll hunt you down Ruin you
All the things that I've never wanted or had to
Burn the hatred
Burn the evil
Burn the bitch
It's almost done
Burn the lies
Burn the deception
Burn it all
I'm far from done
Learning nothing doing nothing
Feeling nothing what's the point
All this time that I've stood by you
You're a shell all dead inside
This is all you'll get from me
This is all I have for you
Why must I continue to...
You are now NOTHING
Burn the hatred
Burn the evil
Burn the bitch
It's almost done
Burn the lies
Burn the deception
Burn it all
I'm far from done
Always wanting never learning you never made the time
Till your life's sudden ending came and now you live to die
Trapped in what you thought it could never ever be worse

Searcing for the ultimate escape you think you've found
Now you're just a rotting corpse as you lie there in the ground
This is all is and now you've only had die
This is all there is and now there's nothing

Will this stop the lies <start> Eyes have seen. Ears have witnessed. The unspoken lamentations. To one man's sickness. Incandescent futrescence. A truth is spoken and lost. A life taken. A soul stolen. A memory held in one man's heart on a string. The eyesore of Apoloyons dream. His dancing regrets  they drift away. The bleeding voices they know my name and it hurts. I'll trip the shadow wile you show the leg. He's coming to scare me again. This Dogman's grown horns and made mama cry again. Searching for someone to hurt. This is mine I'll burn it all. <start> Knew I was right all along

The flame of death's design
The solid scheme of fate
Futile to reflect
Steering with empty orbits
At the sinister deed
There is a spectral shadow
Engraved in your soul
...And when the scythe has fallen
There's no turning back
When the light's persistently faded
You're forever embraced in black
Never  You will never recoil
Forever  Locked in the pillory
You will never return
Scald by remorseful flame
Eclipse of greed
Grips the inner sanctum
Precious scapegoat
Clenching every drop of life
Leeches on your back
Refuses you to survive
The way is long and hard
That leads up to the light <start> Instrumental <start> Another sunrise swathes the earth in light.
The sun a symbol of innocence inverse of the night.
Yet with all this energy comes a certain weakness.
'O hear it's silent cries as the blackness envelops.
Amass congregate. Form an ashen shroud asphyxiate.
Secure restraint reigns mummify the sun.
Drag it down to earth with it's age old flame extinguished.
The event of it's demise an invitation to it's rival.
Lord of insanity replacing joy with madness.
Now all life on earth turns it's head towards it's master.
Rationality replaced with numbed mesmerisation. <start> Music M.Carlsson  Ablaze My Sorrow
Lyrics K.Lonnsjo
Faithful believers of a nonexisting god
Waste all your life on your bare knees
Reality a word unknown
Passing your head with a gentle nod
Brainwashed from the day of your birth
Religious fanatic from the cradle to the grave
Christian pedophiliac is that your way to save
Why can't you see beyond the illusion the lie
Just sitting there praying to an empty sky
You are maggots sheep's that walk in flock
Not able to think on your own
Don't come to me begging for mercy
No fucking remorse you are going down
Religious fanatic from the cradle to the grave
Christian pedophiliac is that your way to save
Why can't you see beyond the illusion the lie
Just sitting there praying to an empty sky
I hate you
I curse you
The truth is what I speak
My words is your defeat
Day in day out before your precious icon
Your life is mine to waste
Blindfolded men of god
I deny your lords existence
Holy father nothing more than phantasm
Pestilential lord of lies <start> Do it drive it drink it smoke it
Choke it
Two steps forward
One hundred steps back
We're going the wrong way
It's backwards it's backwards
Cuffed and branded
I can't stand it
Give me the lane I'm gonna play it my way
When I want to
Charged by the pain
I'm gonna scream out my name if I want to
Live it be it hold it touch it
Kick it beat it love it suck it
Two steps forward
One hundred steps back
We're going the wrong way
It's backwards it's backwards
Cuffed and branded
I can't stand it
Give me the lane I'm gonna play it my way
When I want to
Charged by the pain
I'm gonna scream out my name if I want to
I feel like I'm riding shotgun
Not a roll I can play
I would never get on my knees
And walk the walk of the dead
I won't take a back up
I'm gonna get my back up
I won't take a back up
Charged by life and nothing more
Do it drive it drink it smoke it
Live it be it hold it touch it
Kick it beat it love it suck it 
Give me the lane I'm gonna play it my way
When I want to
Charged by the pain
I'm gonna scream out my name if I want to
I'm riding shotgun <start> Hermanos greludos  prenden el lelo

With the foundation of the hopeless empire of  years
Commanded by a ruler of cruelty
A nation captivated by idealism
Why do we take the reponsibility
Of his insanity
Although we've never asked for that legacy
Incriminated  no forgiveness
Incriminated  no forgiveness
Indescribeable inhuman greed for power
Supported by fanatics under his spell
Obsessed by his aim to wipe out nonarayans
He rushed millions of people into desaster
Why do we take the reponsibility
Of his insanity
Although we've never asked for that legacy
Incriminated  no forgiveness
Incriminated  no forgiveness
More than  years after his predestined fall
We still got to take the responsibility
For those events we know from the history book
Why should we feel guilty for deeds
Done in the past
It began about half a century ago
With the foundation of the hopeless empire of  years
Commanded by a ruler of cruelty
A nation captived with idealism
Why do we take the reponsibility
Of his insanity
Although we've never asked for that legacy <start> Between valleys I drown in deepest seas
I'm on the edge of forever
Lost in the twilight collision of darkness and light
A new day dawning it's time to fight

Enchanting voices won't leave me be
Throwing me choices making future so hard to see
Chorus
Voice from the past
Forever lasts
On and on it echoes in me
I've been there done that the story of my life
I need an extension in my bloodline
I wish upon a star but it comes crashing down
I am lost and never found

 <start> Like an animal
Senses fear
Chills up my spine
I know you're here
It's been so long
So what did you expect
I know where you've been
And I disrespect
I feel sickened
I choke and spit up words
They all mean nothing
It's all absurd
Your body has been used up
Your mind has changed direction
I can't believe I touched you
I can't believe it
Inside I wish it wasn't true
It makes it hard to look at you
Ugly I feel
My body's inside you
Tongue in tongue out
I can taste him on you
You're naked as a child
Your innocence is gone
Given away for nothing
And I hate what's left
Inside I wish it wasn't true
It makes it hard to look at you
I close my eyes I close my mind
But it makes nothing go away
Look back in anger
Look back in pain
Look back in disrespect
It's you I can't respect
I look back in anger
And it's so hard to look back
I close my eyes I close my mind
But it makes nothing go away <start> Deep inside the black and winding mazes
I'm running from my ghouls
My own thoughts are replaced by
The hidden faces deep from my soul.
Longing to see time rolling by
To case the thoughts of regret
My bad conscience tears me apart
How will I ever forget
Dark recollections
Gnaw my inside
I've tried to run
And I've tried to hide
Reaching the barrow
Of my memories
To lay the final stone upon the grave
Searching inner kingdoms
For control
To put the lid of oblivion
Upon the grave of guilt
As I look into the mirror
I do not see my face
Two lying hollow eyes is staring back
With the look of shame and disgrace
My past is darkening my future
As my present dies
Every morning is a step towards
The edge of my soul's demise
Yesterday's demons
Is like a plague to my mind
That never seems to cure
Imprisoning me to
What I left behind
Letting my conscience
Unchaine no more <start> Late at night all systems go
You have come to see the show
We do our best you're the rest
You make it real you know
There is a feeling deep inside
That drives you fuckin' mad
A feeling of a hammerhead
You need it oh so bad
Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash
Bang your head against the stage
Like you never did before
Make it ring make it bleed
Make it really sore
In a frenzied madness
With your leather and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around
It is hot as hell tonight
Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash
Here on the stage the Marshall noise
Is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass kick your face
Exploding feeling nears
Now is the time to let it rip
To let it fuckin' loose
We are gathered here to aim and kill
Cause this is what we choose
Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash
Here we go
Whiplash
The show is through the metal is gone
It is time to hit the road
Another town another gig
Again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways
Life out here is raw
But we will never stop
We will never quit
'cause we are MetallicA
Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash <start> Alone in darkness born in hell
Suffocating
Invisible walls the mind is bound
Entombed in my body i live my death
Living in a world of nonreality
Decapitated soulless stare
Comatose the walking dead
Day by day we're dying
In pain we crawl to death
Vicious greedy seething hate
Ensnared a dark hearted fate
An eye of scorn the sardonic grin
Let hate breed war revenge begins
An eye of scorn the sardonic grin
Let hate breed war let revenge begin revenge begin
A silent sickness death unseen
An ignorant choice believe me you'll bleed
The loss of loved one soul will scream
Until then on ego you'll feed
Living in a world of nonreality
Decapitated soulless stare
Comatose the walking dead
Day by day we're dying
In pain we crawl to death
Vicious greedy seething hate
Ensnared a dark hearted fate
An eye of scorn the sardonic grin
Let hate breed war revenge begins
An eye of scorn the sardonic grin
Let hate breed war let revenge begin revenge begin
Alone in darkness Suffocating... i live my death
Alone in darkness born in hell
Suffocating
Invisible walls the mind is bound
Entombed in my body i live my death
Living in a world of nonreality
Decapitated soulless stare
Comatose the walking dead
Day by day we're dying
In pain we crawl to death
Vicious greedy seething hate
Ensnared a dark hearted fate
An eye of scorn the sardonic grin
Let hate breed war revenge begins
An eye of scorn the sardonic grin
Let hate breed war let revenge begin begin <start> From beyond all paths of man I drew my rules
Infamous among gods and low I did fall
And the earth hath cried aloud
Hark For enraged winds and storms now awaken
Now see me naked yet draped in flames
My pent fury to unleash upon men
Of chaos I am the disobedient one
Depraved son who hath dwelt in nothingness
Upon the ninth I fell from grace up above
To taste this life of sin to give birth to the I
I didst create demigods strong in will and deed
That they may stand proud and call out thy names
How dare thou cross the paths of mine
And leave my fallen sons behind
Oh I shall feast in Gutter as king of nothing
I shall feed on thee the Mightiest One
Behold For I am Him
Life giving flower that belongst to the dawn
Hear
Feel
Pray
Kneel <start> Death is drawing near
I know it's true but I have no fear
I know I can't escape my
Fate Turns it's deadly wheel
Judgement day is closing in but still I cannot feel
Remorse Is for the weak
I stand silent while they speak their accusations are all
Lies Spread by preaching men
I'm on trial for being who I am
And praising the Gods of my native land
I will stand firm I refuse to kneel
The fury in me is divine
My dark grave awaits my fate is revealed
But I'm not afraid to die
Death The day to die is here
The sun rides high on the northern sphere
And the executioner sharpens his
Axe Shines in the sun
I smile when they tie me down
And hear the sound of the falling blade
Death Sweet death relieve me from this world
Death Sweet death relieve me relieve
So death finally came to him
The pagan man could not be turned
He faced death with a grin
Now his head rests in the dust
The proud man stood firm he refused to kneel
Then fury in him was divine
Now he is dead his fate has been sealed
He's brought to Golden Hall up high <start> Devoted to your own opiate
In escapades from discontent
Are you shutting off from the outside world
To reflect on your mind shallow gutter
For this is your empire this is your intrigue
Here you own them all here you seal the deed
Contaminated from the spree of self salvation
To keep the fever flowing in the veins
Prominently manipulating heaven and hell
Does your sophistically discreet interlude
Maintain stories not to be revealed
In your search for redemption
Greed and lies become the savior
Through the lecherous eyes disgust withstand
For are not these the windows to your soul
Fatherly fornication of sweat lips in dismay
Repeatedly unlocking the vaults to the holocaust
The dormant prodigy seeks it's reason for rebirth
But it will never never gain the strength
A surrender in superficial scorn
The rape of an ever unborn
Seeds have been planted in the name of the son
Until this day ungodliness is yet to be gone
Sacramental suicide amidst the flow of virgin vine
The only way to comfort the defeat
A surrender in superficial scorn
The rape of an ever unborn
Seeds have been planted in the name of the son
Until this day ungodliness is yet to be gone
Regrets can no longer find it's ways
Streams of innocent bitter tears flowing down the drain
Mirrored in the haze of a partaker's eyes <start> Yo Moose stop the car right here.
Alright give it here give it here.
No man let me do it cool ice.
Stay in the car man stay in the car. Stay in the car.
Uh hi officers um we had a flat tire back there.
Do you think you guys could help us out
Naw that's not my job. My job's not to help your fuckin' ass out.
I mean um you know I don't have any other way to get home.
That's not my job asshole.
Well uh could you tell me what your job is
Right now my job is eatin' these doughnuts or maybe...
hey wait a minute. Aren't you...
Yup. <start> I don't know why I know where the pieces go. suddenly everything makes so much sense we lay our backs across your fence feels like i'm almost human. each gesture nearly commands respect with ringing ears and ringing necks will hit the ground with scattered shots we'll tie your lungs in miles of knots we'll close your eyes. bricks and boards are not enough. they're not enough not even close. goes right through your doors at night. it is a qualitynot often appreciated seldom admired held to bare bulbs we'll see it through short breaths stabbing sighs after all these years still afraid to die. crush your small sense of security. grinding it out underneath the cheapest pair of shoes I own. <start> With one massive breath she was drawn within me
Tunneled through my mouth
A soothing delivery to Hell
Dry gasp
Impossible to swallow from the head first
Eyes rolled and hands shaped to slaughter
Beaten and erased from the inside out
Plague the brain and disable
Plague the blood pump and disable
...and then there was two of her
My eyes could only see one shadow as sunlight dimmed
There is an ice pick after the smile
There is an ice pick when I swallow
Brain matter has been frozen
The blood pump is an inversion
Yet the body will move on as the heart remains in trance
A skeleton has been frozen
There will be no anabiosis
I would rather slit my throat than inhale again <start> Let loose the clockwork dogs. Pathological believers faithful servants. Reduced to servomechanisms with lockstep discipline and kneejerk obedience. Reduced to timereckoners with Newtonian mechanics and a Promethean mandate. Polishing and decorating each ideological cage. Notch by notch hammer by hammer escape from freedom. Prognosis ideologies are habits of thought that defy thought and enable people to avoid thought. Airborne contagions communicable plagues towing the weary down river like rudderless wrecks and we are all sick with them. <start> With giant claws of steel it has arrived
The metal monster it's now alive
It came to take our world and steal your soul
It will find you and take control
Chorus
Scream machine  it will bore inside your head
Scream machine  you will feel it's power
Don't look into it's eyes or you will die
You know it's on the prowl it's getting closer
I see your fear you should beware
The metal giant it will rip your heart out
Repeat chorus
Can you feel it it's getting closer
It's taking over your world
Repeat chorus <start> Every day I get more pissed
Slit my wrist slit my wrist
I hate to care I hate relations
A pile stacked high of complications
Every day I get more pissed
Slit my wrist slit my wrist
I hate the thought that I must give
All my time just to live
Every day I get more pissed
Slit my wrist slit my wrist
I hate the thought of government aid
Across my wrist a razor blade
Every day I get more pissed
Slit my wrist <start> We've heard the sound that ears bleed to hear
The sound of a place the entire universe awaits
Here the strongest fall to their knees
A passion so powerful
That walls crumble to their foundations
Here the strongest fall to their knees
The lost find their way back home
Here the strongest fall to their knees
The lost find their way back home
But the masses buy what will make them rich
Feasting on lies chasing their tails
Truth be told they'll get what they were promised
Crawling away burning with regret
To the deepest darkest depths
Crawling away burning with regret
To the deepest darkest depths of hell
We got news for you we got news for you the day is soon coming
When turning your back won't be an option
We got news for you the day is soon coming
When turning your back won't be an option
Keep telling yourself what you really don't believe
You can compromise what you know to be true
And you can turn off all of your senses
But in the end you'll see but in the end you'll see
Nothing stands between a man and his Maker
Nothing stands between a man and his Maker
No
No matter what is your decision
No matter what is your decision
This isn't something you could do alone
Go
No matter what it's your decision
Give up give in
Give up give in no matter what it's your decision
Give up give in no matter what it's your decision
Give up give in no matter what it's your decision
Give up give in no matter what it's your decision <start> Here they come
No chance of stopping them now
Trudging forward
On a quest  for human flesh
Panic is a catalyst
They crave limbs  to rip and twist
Now soon to be within  their grasp
Run  the chase begins
Terror  they're closing in
Must attempt to refrain from defeat
Done  fallen to the ground
Clawing  disturbing sounds
Cant escape the gnashing of their teeth
Tearing off the outer skin to invade the inside
Sanguinary mastication now the pain is increased
Slashing of the arteries completely defiled
Bleeding out and soon to rot  carrion feast
They cannot stop the craving for more blood
They cannot stop the craving for more blood
Attacking with no sign of remorse
Nothing can stop this showing of force
A virulent onslaught  rotten decayed
As they continue to feed on the corpse
Attacking with no sign of remorse
Nothing can stop this showing of force
A virulent onslaught  rotten decayed
As they continue to feed on the corpse
Onward  to feed
Never will the cycle end
Only bones are left behind
Cannot stop this craving for more blood
They cannot stop the craving for more blood <start> Sore days of emptiness
There's no end to the winter
Twilight carries through
Despair reigns over your heart
You don't know where to start
Frustration eats deeps into you
Prospects of a better future are a cynical utopia
As if everything's been lost
Its just a question of time
You need to find inspiration
Look up and let it pass by
And don't forget that whenever you call me
I'm here for you my friend
There's so much ahead for both of us
There's so many beautiful girls out there
Waiting for you to make your wishes come true
Dont be a hick turn that fucking tv off
Get out of your fleabitten den
Change your shorts and let's go
We're gonna rock tonight
Oh I almost forgot
Im broke could you front me <start> Well here go my big plans
To build up this fortress into the clouds
It's made up of my love and my heart
And my blood we'll make it out
With the weight of the world here I stand
With the weight of the world here I stand
With the weight of the world here I stand
With the weight of the world oh
And this is all I've got I'll make it now or not
It's made up of my love
And I've fought so hard to fake our lives are meant to make
It's made up of my love made up of my love
That's how it goes it goes
Well here goes my big plans
To build up this fortress into the clouds
It's made up of my love
And my heart and my blood we'll make it out
I won't fall down my heart still pounds
I'm breathing now I won't fall down
I won't fall down my heart still pounds
I'm breathing now I won't fall down
I won't fall down my heart still pounds
I'm breathing now I won't fall down
I won't fall down my heart still pounds
I'm breathing now I won't fall down
Well here go my big plans
To build up this fortress into the clouds
It's made up of my love
And my blood and my heart we'll make it out
We'll make it out we'll make it out
We'll make it out we'll make it out
We'll make it our love out
You're not the only one <start> If you can't hear my screams
Who am I to pray for mankind
Feel... Misery
In the silence of fields
Dance of whispers are claiming for their suffering lifes
Lonely tears
Lonely tears falling weak deep inside
Under a burning sky
Brightness will turn in darkness
The stream will end in silence
While my soul feels the human pain
The Night's Cold Symphony
Fall down in velvet ground
The Night's Cold Symphony
This is our fate
...Their lifes passed before their eyes closed...
Smile of death looks within
Our fears and our sins
And his madness lead to mankind grave
Nobody can bring back
The dream of eternal life
Now we sail in a sea of hate
If you can't hear my screams
Who am I to pray for mankind
Feel... Misery
In our cold symphony
Freezing flames cover our illusions in the earth
Lonely tears
Lonely tears falling weak deep inside
Under a burning sky
Brightness will turn in darkness
The stream will end in silence
While my soul feels the human pain
The Night's Cold Symphony
Fall down in velvet ground
The Night's Cold Symphony
This is our fate <start> Honor abide
Choice of words
That I speak today
Consequent evidence
Now they put astray
Conflicts forever halt
Wipe resentment clean
No thoughts of decadence
Life is now serene
I've foreseen
You're now fortified
Take the highest point
Drive it in your side
Keen are they
Who feel the conqueror
Truth of the heart
Or peace will fall apart
Again it's none for this
None for that can we share alike
Positive identity
Creates the oversight
Never erase the light in man
No more blockades
Warfare for at last
Are to soon about to fade
I've foreseen
You're now fortified
Take the highest point
Drive it in your side
Keen are they
Who feel the conqueror
Truth of the heart
Or peace will fall apart
It's taken years to mend
Can't take the high hell
Can't change the way they feel
Honor abide
Choice of words
That I speak today
Warfare for at last
Are soon about to fade
I've foreseen
You're now fortified
Take the highest point
Drive it in your side
Keen are they
Who feel the conqueror
Truth of the heart
Or peace will fall apart
Again
It's done <start> Introspection self perfection
Are you scared of your reflection
Suicide is no solution
Try to make your contribution
Don't believe in resurrection
You won't find the lost connection
Life is only what you make it
So decide if you can take it
There is no easy way out
There is no easy way out
There is no easy way out
There is no easy way out
There is no easy way out
There is no easy way out
Do you like the situation
Can you take the penetration
When you've made your reputation
Take care of your own frustration
Life is hard don't make it worse
Don't tell me your life's a curse
You can't regret the choice you've made
If you decide what chords are played
There is no easy way out
There is no easy way out
There is no easy way out
There is no easy way out
There is no easy way out
There is no easy way out
Can you feel your own frustration
Can you grip the situation
Do you feel determination
Do you feel the suffocation
Do you feel the sterilization
Do you feel the strangulation
Don't say that you don't want to live your life anyway
Don't say that you can't take another day
Don't say nobody cares about you anyway
Do you know what your friends would say
There is no easy way out

Forcing the elimination of hereditary flaws
Licensed breeding protocol man's course decided
Incarcerating violaters their spawn aborted state required forfeit
Human perfection far beyond our grasp
Cut out random flaws leaving glitches behind them
Talents that lay dormant left withered in the womb
Predetermined course they take no chances
Sleep submit obey accept it
Nature rejected culture forgotten
Dwell in their complacency
Drop your defenses swallow your bullshit
Close down all your doubtful dreams
They will not happen you don't have it in you
Their emotions stripped away
The depth of man measured proudly dismissed
Traits that bear malignant traces recognized without a cure
Magnify the scorn upon the disadvantaged
Live off the toil of others the rich inflate themselves
Treading on their laborers burdened by destitution
Sleep submit obey accept it
Nature rejected culture forgotten
Dwell in their complacency
Drop your defenses swallow your bullshit
Close down all your doubtful dreams
They will not happen you don't have it in you
Their emotions stripped away
The depth of man measured proudly dismissed
Born to be slaves from birth the rich own them
Rigid system caste of reproduction
Sequence profile science of misplaced trust
Tyrants protect their own
Propagate subordination
Despondence contrived alignment
Oppression induce class hatred
Insurgents revolt against them
Disregard their vacant morals
Interrupt their hoarded power
They will fall the balance will shift
Overturn their world of shit <start> I feel so good seeing you raise your hands
And shake your body all night long

Only seeing things the way you think they should be
Upholding honor and respect is the way I live
To have trust is the hardest when I've seen it all before
I've known for some time that you're one of them
Wanting nothing and you're giving nothing more
I've dealt with your kind and you're all the same
Let me tell you that you're not alone
Only seeing things the way you think they should be
Never knowing never feeling never hurting me
To have trust is the hardest when I've seen it before
And this is what I have to deal with now
Wanting nothing and you're giving nothing more
I never thought I'd be the one to have to lay the blame
I've dealt with your kind and you're all the same
Let me tell you that you're not alone
Many I know think just as you do
Of nothing of no one... exception... yourself
Biding my time and not getting to close
This is not how I will now die
Committed to nothing you walk with closed eyes
I'm cleansing the world of the scum that resides
Not fearing the ones that will cause me disgust
I know that I am all that I have left
Time waits for nothing no one
Never could understand why
I'll retain my dignity
Never given you a reason to lie
Logic thoughts rule my world and they're running through my head
Only seeing things the way you think they should be
Upholding honor and respect is the way I live
To have trust is the hardest when I've seen it all before
I've known for some time that you're one of them
Wanting nothing and you're giving nothing more
I've dealt with your kind and you're all the same
Let me tell you now that you're not alone. <start> It's never enough
And never will be
All this useless gate sickens me
Fuckin' misanthropigs putting down every race
Never questioning themselves
Only other people way of life
Misantropigs resent every race
Misantropigs hate every colour
Misantropigs want them all to die
It's time Misantropigs
Ask themselves why
It's no good to hate them all
It's a battle they can't win
It's no good always being prejudiced
It's time misantropigs
Respect all the earths kind <start> you placed the sound of silence in my ears when i'm calm
like sleeping underwater with dreams of you swirling around
i'm engulfed
don't let this fade away
never let this go
the storm above us is pounding
ships are cracking at the hull
under all this it's tranquil
wrapped up in you
breathe into me the breath life so i will never die again
breathe into me the breath life so i will never die again
and i will rise to the surface
trying to swim against the beating waves
i slip and fall
the water pounding in my lungs
the fear of failing pulls me
it marks my demise
like salt in open wounds
light burns my sun baked eyes
the sound of silence in my head

you speak without using your words

talking in the background
thoughts are carried up on angels' wings
words speak volumes when they are unspoken
my head is mute
but my heart still sings
you bought me you brought me out
x
thoughts are carried up on angels' wings
take me away
solace is found in this
silence
breathe into me my father
breathe into me my friend

take some time to listen to me
please hear me out
i can't let you go that way
take some time to listen to me
please hear me out
i can't let you go that way
 <start> Every time everything seems to go well
The cold rain reminds you
That all is frail like a dry leaf
So many hopes deposited
So many moments encaged
She who saw my birth
Must now be me goodbye
Like water that runs free
Must free my soul
Within this lake of pain
There are so many
Memories inside my heart
So hard to leave you
Memories engraved in my mind
I need to find
Time to chance has arrived to
Overcome this new situation
It's hopeless to regret
Don't waist time and return to your past
When I feel the daylight fall
Nothing can't scape my return
To the moment
When everything disappear
I'm in need of energy
But I must go on
And I like to smile again
But there are so many
Memories inside my heart
So hard to leave you
Memories engraved in my mind
I must carry on
Cause I'd like to smile again
Time to chance has arrived to
Overcome this new situation
It's hopeless to regret
Don't waist time and return to your past
Shout Until you know
How to difficult it is to forget
What I fought for
Break The chains that keep me
Tied to the past
Freeing my sad soul
Time to chance has arrived to
Overcome this new situation
It's hopeless to regret
Don't waist time and return to your past
Today I felt your kiss upon my soul
Your memory tinges my new life
With colors of joy
Tears of fire
I will be happy again
You'll always been
In my memory <start> Tasting your lips with every kiss. Smelling your scent on your neck. Holding you in my
arms. Every moment with you is written upon the tablet of my heart. Washing to live
this life again and forever. All memories are eternally burning pictures within my
soul. Every day I'm still beside you. Living in memories. Dreaming my life away. Thrust
our hearts. You and me together against the world. Losing myself on you. Losing you.
Losing so much more than just a part of me. Memorable beauty gives birth to my pain.
My world is broken. Life is gone. <start> Oh it's opening time
Down on Fascination Street
So let's cut the conversation
And get out for a bit
Because I feel it all fading and paling
And I'm begging
To drag you down with me
To kick the last nail in
Yeah I like you in that
Like I like you to scream
But if you open your mouth
Then I can't be responsible
For quite what goes in
Or to care what comes out
So just pull on your hair
Just pull on your pout
And let's move to the beat
Like we know that it's over
If you slip going under
Slip over my shoulder
So just pull on your face
Just pull on your feet
And let's hit opening time
Down on Fascination Street
So pull on your hair
Pull on your pout
Cut the conversation
Just open your mouth
Pull on your face
Pull on your feet
And let's hit opening time

Family life
It's like puzzle pieces disconnected
Pictures frames will never find
This broken home my demons still reside
You would think we could have lived together with all this hell inside
Mother I just needed you to know
Something good grew out from all of the cracks inside our broken home
I am a lonely soul a kid flying his kite alone
Or am I just a head in the clouds welcoming wind every time there's a storm
Where do I go now
I grew up in a house God built with the devils blueprints with no foundation found
I went to hell to have some words with the devil about what he did but it was empty
Everyone moved out
Mother I just needed you to know
Something good grew out from all of the cracks inside our broken home
And father I needed you the most
But I'm still a kid in aging skin a hypocrite trying to grow
Every time I try
To bury the wreckage of that old house in my mind
I see the same crow on the power line
He could have flown to any other home
But he'll never stop chasing mine
He'll never stop chasing mine
It's a strange kind of comfort
Learning to always love
The cracks inside broken homes
Mother I just needed you to know
Something good grew out from all of the cracks in our broken home
And father I needed you the most
But I'm still a kid in aging skin and I will always love you both <start> They were experts
Having practised for years
On cattle
What sustained them
Beyond the frenzy
The frenzy of the first attack
Through plain physical exhaustion
And the whole mess of it all
Unending destruction required great ambition
Properly disturbed by the curiosity
Of inflicting
Massive slaughter on
Innocent civilians
Perpetrators needn't enjoy the killing
Above all their victims must die
Extermination underway
They killed all day
At night they feasted on
Looted cattle
Beneath the cries of their victims
After whatever sleep could be had
They went back and killed again <start> Yeah
Giants of stone built up by desire
No one could tell us the secret of fire
The hunger for wisdom deep in your heart
You can't accept that you're living apart
Water runs down the river
Lord you are the only to deliver
Night stay night
In the night nothing's white
Not a knowledge not a light
Lord will you tell me why someday
Fairytale life is one big fairytale
A book of seven seals
Someone tell me why and how
Fairytale life is one big fairytale
A book of seven seals
Someone tell me why and how
I'm always told to kneel down and pray
What shall I do to stay on my way
Questions borrow through my brain
Pound and disturb and drive me insane
Lost in visions of knowledge I'll never owe
Night to night
In the night not a light
Not a knowledge nothing's white
Lord will you tell me why someday
Fairytale life is one big fairytale

Denote the total contrast of
The race made by Morgoth
Stretched elven bodies
Torture pestilencia
Dark side of the distant stars
Unnatural creation
Ironic how they were taken
So far from each other
Deepest dark merest light
From the one and the same awakening
Cunning was the plan of Morgoth
Those foolish did all the work
He came and culled the harvest
Bred the fruits for his purpose
Unaware folk of the stars
Forced into wounds and dreadful scars
To raid the lands under his summons
Destroy the race that they once were <start> You don't like the clothes I wear

But it gives me pleasure to aggravate
The ones I hate
Walking down the Streets
A Bottle grazes off your head
From a window someone laughing
Spitting on your head
Find a weapon bash their skulls in
Don't they make you sick
Kill these fucking pricks
Shins and bangers joing fight or one

Tired of being pressured
To join their plastic army
You conforming clones will be sorry
Suck

I watch your bullshit from the outside in you disrespect and hate
You think you're better than your fellow man
Controlled by fear you seal your fate
How could you step on me violate desecrate and hate me
But I'm just like you flesh and blood I'm only human.
I resist the pressure to be who you want me to be
I resist the pressure I resist so I am free.
I see right through your condescending ways as you look down on me
But I could never stand and judge like you I resist so I am free.
My peace of mind peace of mind will set me free
But I'm just like you flesh and blood in need of revolution.
I resist so I am free. <start> Incarnated transmigration

Black my eyes with poppers Kylie was my first stalker we got over that and fell in love too
So Ill sing it loud and clear Im on the edge of the world and Im thinking of you again
I promised you this wouldnt be an emotional song but thats a promise I cant keep
I hope to God that the only tears that fall are happy tears in your eyes
Because after tonight forever comes to life
Chalking up the schoolyard swinging in Mics backyard she pissed us off one too many times
Listening to Mayday dunce hats for your birthday dreaming of the warmth that youre mine
Wed hope to go to Cali travel around the country graduate and go hand in hand
Your toe thumbs in mine just grazing the sand
Its starting to freeze outside I pull you in and squeeze tight watch the notebook right by the fire
If you say I dont love you or say that I dont trust you thats when you can stamp me a liar
Because Ill be here forever until Hell freezes over until my flat liner holds its beep
Pinky swear it kiss me to sleep <start> In depths so deep I can't believe
Confusion conquers and frustration wins
Into where light does not reach
This is where pain and sorrow meets
Into denial
Baptized into a liar
Give me the power
Would you
Could you
Caught in a world where angels weep
Where hatred battles greed
And frustration wins
Chained to a world where all good sleep
This is where pain and sorrow meets
I'm doubting still denying
The truth was more than shocking
I'm doubting I'm hiding hiding
I'm running knowing they're watching
I'm still in disbelief from what I've seen
Where I'm hiding.hiding. <start> music lyrics vocal patterns Webster
Deathless sin
Led to the place of atonement
Repent through pain
Slicing off proof of guilt
Immortal lust
Blood craving torturers revel
Pain through penance
You will plead for your scourge
Burnt with iron
Retinas scorched
Eyes are blind
Purge the mind
Enter the chambers of blood
Slave to the cruelty inside
Die in the chambers of blood
Cleansed of the sins of your life...bleeding
Walls are stained with blood of vice
Learn through scourge
The errors of depravity
Immortal curse
Inquisitors for eternity
Scourging to learn
The stamina of the condemned
Disembowel
Torn apart
Heaving lungs
Severed tongues
Never to speak evil never again
This is the way it must be
Burnt at the stake or
Stretched on the rack
Burning your soul
Draw out your guilt
Pieces torn off
Pieces that sinned
Tumors that must be destroyed
Chop off a cock or carve out a cunt
Cleansing your soul bleed to atone
Enter the chambers of blood
Slave to the cruelty inside
Die in the chambers of blood
Cleansed of the sins of your life
Bleed on it's infernal walls
Nailed to the prison you made
Scraps of flesh litter the halls
Torture the price has been paid
Disembowel
Torn apart
Never to speak evil never again
This is the way it must be
Burnt at the stake or
Stretched on the rack
Burning your soul
Draw out your guilt
Pieces torn off
Pieces that sinned
Tumors that must be destroyed
Chop off a cock or carve out a cunt
Cleansing your soul bleed to atone
Enter the chambers of blood
Slave to the cruelty inside
Die in the chambers of blood
Cleansed of the sins of your life

This wornout warrior's mind

And forced to make you dead
The chains get tighter around my throat
I can give you no love only deadlift of pain
In the dusk of evening I tuck you up with feather
Forever I'll stand by your side
In the twilight of night I'm laughing
While cutting you hundred and thirteen times
Can't you see I am evil doubleedged razor
Child of eternal hate.
To torment you like a motherfuckin' whore
I'll make you cry forever more
I'd crawl through broken glass to you
And your name is written in my very flesh
With the knife I'm still longing to use
In the night I crave to feel your breath
And your touch like angel of death
In the dawnism in chains of bestial rage
And forced to make you dead <start> Lend me your steelbearing hand
So I may reign the Jewel Throne
My soul feels the gods' demand
As the lost kings uphold my side
Blood and sand
Mark their way
The usurper's tears
Guide my sword
Fantasia slept in my thoughts
As I was a son of infinity
The emperor forgotten rests in my dreams
As back to the wall I start the conquest
Blood and sand
Mark their way
The usurper's tears
Guide my sword
Innocence and wrath
Now lie far beyond
As we cross the deserts
To reach the fortress' gates
Tragical serenades
Are whispered in the wind
As eyes in fury
Grant us our strength
They're throning on the dignity of might
But the successor is to enter the hall
False truth saw them climbing the steps
But I remain the Jewel Throne's choice
Blood and sand
Mark their way
The usurper's tears
Guide my sword <start> You bury me in hills of sand
lie by lie you took my hand
the promises you made to me
now bury me as grains of sand
I'll rip the teeth from the beast
I'll cut the tongue from this deceivers mouth
break the grasp of false prophets hold
Let you fall into your fear
let you fall into your own doubt
there's no way down when you drug yourself to the bottom
there's no way down when you cast yourself as
deceiver deceiver deceiver deceiver
If you were who you said you were
you would already know this
you would be here now and
the things you had done would speak for themselves
Your blindfold is a mirror
you see nothing but yourself
to damn the ones that fight for you
ignore their screams and cries for help
so welcome to the desert
this is the nightmare you've created
No way down when you've drug us down to the bottom
no way down when you cast yourself down in to the ground
If you were who you said you were
you would already know this
you would be here now and
the things you had done would speak for themselves
so reach a hand and grab ahold
to lives you've shattered from lies you've told
so reach a hand and grab ahold
this is your last chance to now grab ahold
Reach a hand and grab ahold <start> Save your souls
We are a new kind of nightmare
Your falling children
Born to show that we don't care
Helpless protest with a weak intention
Is our gift to achieve attention
Our loaded guns need no faked liberty
Will blow away our painful misery
Welcome the ones
That know the only way
To show this world
How to get away
We are the Suicide Crew
Save our souls
This is a god damned nightmare
Where are the ones who show
That they do care
We kill our cries with a wrong intention
Our broken dreams need
The world's attention
Ignored and seen as useless casualties
Can't be the way to better possibilities
Accept the truth
This is our destiny
We are the youth
Awaiting your reality <start> Love like a storm like an ocean endless
Love like a fire like the world is burning
Should've known better should've known better
But you see through all the lines and then
Prove I'm not like all of them
Should've known better should've known better

If your love is just a dream don't wake me up
It's hard enough to face the world alone
If your love is just a dream don't wake me up
It's hard enough to face the world alone
You are the one I waited for I knew it all along

You are the one I'm fighting for I knew it all along
Love like a dream like you're never waking
Love like your last like the sky is falling
Should've known better should've known better
But you see through all the lines and then
Prove I'm not like all of them
Should've known better should've known better

You are the one I waited for I knew it all along

You are the one I'm fighting for I knew it all along
Sing me something that'll bring me to my knees
That'll put my mind at ease
Please tell me anything
We can build this like a dream
Let's make believe just you and me x
If your love is like a dream don't wake me up
It's hard enough to face the world alone
If this love is just a dream don't wake me up
It's hard enough to face the world alone
If your heart stops beating God rest my soul
Dig this grave for two can't live without you
It's hard enough to face the world alone
If your heart stops beating God rest my soul
Dig this grave for two can't live without you
It's hard enough to face the world alone
You are the one I waited for I knew it all along. <start> This is the story of the Antichrist's son born from the union of two.
Not from a virgin alone as for god the son of perdition he will be born in sin.
Like the great serpent in the wayside he sits
Waiting to wound those who justice's path walks.
They will be killed in an agonizing death
Struck with the poison of his wickedness.
God he raises the lowly our king he casts them out.
Instead of condemn all the sinners they will be magnified.
Sin stand for beauty sin stands for life.
Sexual sin is every man's right.
He will exalt the wicked of man
Our king the Antichrist.
Just as the lord and redeemer foresaw
A suitable place for his son to be born.
So did the devil he knew a place.
From which all evil could root
It was Babylon.
He will come to Jerusalem with various tortures
And slay all the Christians he can not convert to his cause.
He'll destroy the human race as far as he can
And on the last day
He will destroy himself.
God he raises the lowly our king he casts them out.
Instead of condemn all the sinners they will be magnified.
Sin stand for beauty sin stands for life.
Sexual sin is every man's right.
He will exalt the wicked of man
Our king the Antichrist.
Sin stand for beauty sin stands for life.
Sexual sin is every man's right.
He will exalt the wicked of man
Our king the Antichrist. <start> Ich verbrenne fr dich
Ich kann nicht atmen ohne dich
Do vergibst weil do liebst
Ich falle fr dich
Kann nicht mehr aufstehn ohne dich
Do verstehst weil do lebst
Was ist die Sonne ohne dein Licht
Was ist ein Bild ohne dein Gesicht
Ich hab das Leben verflucht
Allein zu leben versucht
Doch es geht nicht
Ohne dich kann ich nicht frei sein
Ohne dich endlos high sein
Ohne dich bin ich allein
Ohne dich kann ich nicht fliegen
Ohne dich endlos lieben
Ohne dich kann ich nicht sein
Ich erwache fr dich
Ich kann nichts sprn ohne dich
Do befreist do verzeihst
Ich ertrinke in dir
Spr deinen Pulsschlag tief in mir
Do verstehst weil do lebst <start> Smoke and fire on your lips again
Desire strikes you out and wins
Bang goes your head again locked in chains
Little do you know it's got you bound 'til you go insane
They glorify that feeling in their eyes
They think it's cool but they'll never realize
What a thin disguise
Chorus
Deadlock crawling into the dark they're in a
Deadlock before they realize they are caught
Hot steel the pipe's never cold anymore
The more you feel the more you can't let go
Bang goes your body now cocaine
Harmless though it seems it starts just like a dream
But it end
They glorify that feeling in their eyes
They think it's cool but they'll never realize
What a thin disguise
Chorus
Give me a drink leave me alone I don't care what you think
I don't got a problem no you've got the problem
Deadlock you're dead
Deadlock you better give it up instead
Deadlock deadlock deadlock
I'm never going back never it doesn't last
Reality is hitting me
They think they're in control
But their desire is digging a deeper hole they're in a deadlock
I'm talking to you as a friend
And I love you 'til the very end
It's not the way to go don't follow those who never
Never know <start> It's sad when kids take their lives
In the act kill  peers
What drives a mind to kill
Must have been really catastrophic
To hate violently stockpile guns
Inflictin' revenge gruesomely that oblivious day
Who would foresee media spectacle
Enshroud in tragedy
Victims will beg and plead
Nation in shock copycat's mock
Upscaled high school
Killing of the rich can happen anywhere
Even in your neighborhood
Children are snapping
Peach through annihilation
It kind of sucks
Innocent people died
What made this happen
Condolence to the bereaved
Deranged adolescents
Or victims as well
Society could learn from this
Listen to your kids
Two die brains go splat <start> Twist my fucking arm till i've stabbed you in the back.
The tears you shed are fake it's all part of your act.
Muffled by the sounds of pain
find bleeding hearts to drown your shame
make yourself the victim spread lies to save your name.
What did you just say
What the fuck did you just say
These bleeding hearts can't drown your shame.
Faster and faster your heading for disaster
you're bleeding hearts will dry their sympathy will die.
Question my convictions doubt my sincerity
what the fuck can i say
Fuck you. <start> Freedom is just a breath away
Will you live to see the day
As the heat intensifies
You start to choke your insides fry
Seizure now sets in
Torture will begin
Twisted bodies lie
Waiting now to die
Choke on it  as your tongue goes down
Choke on it  death is all around
Screaming fills your frenzied mind
No way out no more time
Example made for those to see
Your freedom turned to misery <start> Vicious circle's got me down
Days turn into weeks of hanging out
Got to shake these soup kitchen blues
Growing tired of barley cabbage stew
And there being nothing
Nothing new to do
Dumb and hungry we make our way
For free refueling
Like an alarm clock our minds know the times
We plan our lives around the lines
 P.M. at the soup kitchen
Talking politics with the bag men
Forced into their conversations
Pessimistic contemplations
They tell me of their heart conditions
Share with me their D.T. Visions
Damn me with that bad outlook
Or save me with that Good Book
Vicious circle's got me down
Weeks turn into months of hanging out
Got to shake these HaightAshbury blues
Growing tired of Kezar Stadium cruise
And there being nothing
Nothing new to do
Make the midday pilgrimage
We travel far and wide
Going to the soup kitchen
To swallow some more pride <start> Sun comes out  Wakes me up
Wanna sleep need to sleep
Saw your face  In my dreams
Fade away far away
Fade away fade away
You took your time  Passing by
Smiles and tears  No one cares
Had you once  Now youre gone
Want you here Need you near
Dreams and life it seems
Are crushing boundaries in me
Paper waves and seas  Ride the tide with me
Need to see  Youre not far from me
Im breaking time  Crossing lines
I start to run  to catch the sun
from falling down  and burn this town
I try to reach  You slip away
Cant you stay  Please just stay
Cold and warmth collide
Turning dark and light inside
Nights we over fly  All logic gone awry
To know we might not meet again I hardly bare to look at you
In all this mess we dont complain we kind of always knew <start> We all stand together we fight
Is that all sense of our lives
The rich are sitting quite far above
And we are left to blood
Even the poorest of the poorest I know
They strip them down to the last shirt
Only dollars in front of their eyes
Till everything breaks down
Oh God that's our future
Oh God there's no way out
FIGHTING DESPAIRING WE NEVER RESIGN FROM OUR DESTINY
FIGHTING DESPAIRING WE FIGHT TILL THE TIME WE ARE FREE
Any music that they get into
We have to face again
We are the victim of their greed
While they waste everything
Oh God there's a way out
Oh God that's our future
FIGHTING DESPAIRING WE NEVER RESIGN FROM OUR DESTINY
FIGHTING DESPAIRING WE FIGHT TILL THE TIME WE ARE FREE
FIGHTING DESPAIRING WE NEVER RESIGN FROM OUR DESTINY
FIGHTING DESPAIRING SO OUR HOPE AND OUR HONOUR WILL NEVER DIE <start> Raw Sewage in my Veins

Living for the day
Life lights their way
They are all forever free
They will never die
never wonder why
they are all forever free
PreChorus
There will always be sun up in the sky
a raimbow standing high
Red horizon lights their way over the seas
from tears of the trees
Here they always stay
Chorus
Ride on your wings
Children of the sky
Fly on forever
on winds of the free
Beyond reality
a world in harmony
They are all living in peace
PreChorus
Chorus
Solo Nyberg  Dahl
Bridge
We all will die someday
I hope I'll find the way
to the land of glory and
yhen I'll fly on the winds of the tree
Chorus <start> Two in one
Both harbor opinion
One talks faster
The other talks louder <start> From the land which hasn't entered yet
into the history
From the depths of swamps we are bringing
Proudly our name
As night kissing the moonlight
rebel children living in twilight
Like wolves...
...some named us so...
union with people from the sign
Of the half moon
To crush the golden walls of earthly heaven
To strangle the pestilence
Th the lands of mighty Empire
Others even think about us with fear
We invaded a state with a sword
In ours hands Roma means nothing
In the land of Slavs
Today forests sing about the legend
Long forgotten spirits
Whose names nobody remembers now
Waiting their day to reborn
Their visions of past
Are torturing our souls
Whispering in the dark
They will come again
To reign supreme
Believe my woods
From unrememberance
From Fire and Water
Ancient powers gather
From the burnt Arcona
...From the Pagan Vastlands
Black horse rides across the sky
With a sword we will open the amber gates of Nawia
Dzieci Svantevitha nienawidza Chrystusa
Dzieci Svantevitha nienawidza bogakryza <start> Abuse me confuse me
I'm beggin' for a kind of release
Adultery and the misery
They're not the kind of things you can police
Sinking to an alltime low
I'm drowning with a smack in the face
A torture with a slow decay
The devil's wearing leather and lace
Why did all the lovin' turn to anger
How did everything just fade away
Get off of your ass
It's time to get some fuckin' class
Well everybody fucks up
But enough's enough
Depression the obsession
I'm trying not to get out of bed
Bullet proof the invincible
Can someone tell me whether I'm dead
I'm like a zombie like a vegetable
Just withering away in the ground
I took a deep screw from a thin wrench
Pain queen you look good in your crown
Charging like a battering ram
Nobody's ever gettin' in my way
I'll do you like a beast from hell
And then we'll see what you say
Well you can rip me you can tear me
So go ahead and say what you must
'Cause you're a liar you're a bad child
Farewell and you can live in my dust <start> There are many faces of death
But none as horrific as the irrational slaying of innocent infants
The committing of infanticide
New born innocent victim
Killed by Mother's infliction
Psychotropic sickness
There will be no forgiveness
Severe mental psychosis
A state of non compos mentis
Blood that's frozen frigid
A heart of hardened ice
A breath of death to warm her
As she makes the sacrifice
Infanticide
Infanticide
Post Partum depression
The dying child's convulsion
Vicious act of madness
Emotional breakdown and sadness
Cold and callous
Mean and malice
Sad but true
Nothing you can do
Death desire that can't be tamed
Overflow her brain
For this death she's not to blame
You know that she's insane
Psychoactive chemicals affecting all perception
Termination elimination the removal of all conception
From the womb to the grave
How can we conceive
Trauma stricken mother
Sits crying in disbelief
Hormonal dysfunction
The innocent child's destruction
Born to die
Weeping mothers cry
Nothing but waste
Consequences faced
Cold and callous
Mean and malice
Sad but true
Nothing you can do
Demonic possession
Said to leave this message
Overpowering emotion
The mother and child's devotion
Blood that's frozen frigid
A heart of hardened ice
A breath of death to warm her
As she makes the sacrifice <start> Evil congregation born within my death
Devil seeks my soul tries to steal my breath
Fits of anger cry out as I spill my guts
Vomit fills the air as the coffin shuts
Chorus
Possession
Possession
Repeat first verse
Chorus
The Lords Prayer
Mine eyes have seen the glory
Of the coming of the dead
They have ripped my heart out
Stole my soul and took my every breath
I've lost the will to live or die
Or follow in his ways
His death is marching on
Repeat first verse
Chorus <start> Panzer churning smashing burning
Crushing force on chained feet
Armoured beast steelclad terror
Pulverizing grinding meat
Total war
No redemption
Violent death
Mass destruction
From the skies they attack
On wings of steel spewing death
Airborne carnage millions die
Massive bombraids a world on fire
Total war
No redemption
Violent death
Mass destruction
Nuclear hell breaking loose
Destroying all leaving few
Melted flesh bones that dry
Radiation kill those left behind
Total war
No redemption
Violent death
Mass destruction <start> Locked in a world conflict
A species very existence at stake
Forbidden to exit occupied territories
Force to dig their own graves
Machine gunning thousands
Killed in full fury
Horrifying revelations
Heaving like a living sea
The mass starvation
And pain in their eyes
Final solution
Systematic extermination
Of a made to believe inferior population
Scenes of anguish and terror
bassing vans cremation chambers
Deformed experiments
Assembly lines of death
So called detention camps
Imminently became death traps
The healthy slave all day
While the weak whither away
Marches of murder
Killed in full fury
The mass starvation
And pain in their eyes
Burned into history <start> instrumental <start> Staking out the residence
Of the chosen target
Entering the empty home
Lace the food with poison
The hapless victim never had a chance
Precise contamination killed him fast
Shocking news traveled fast
But I have traveled faster
The only clue that's left behind
Poision in the cadaver
Cyanide assassin is my trade
Executing methods are my quarry's bane
Toxic killing tactics stop your breath
Precision dosage leaves the victim dead
Cyanide assassin
Life my task to end
Death I don't regret
Analyze the next assignment
Select the proper tools
Gas will be the most effective
That is what I'll use
Release the vapors in the victims room
Sleeping chambers fast become a tomb
Calculated venting should work fast
Enclosed space filled with poison gas
Cyanide assassin
Life it should end fast
Death he now should pass
Gasping he fights for air
Face fixed with despair
But the end does not seem close
Misjudged the lethal dose
I must return my works not done
He's still alive but to weak to run
A sloppy job must be finished
Can't leave him in a coma
With my mask I won't smell
The almonnd like aroma
With syringe in hand I walk into his room
He's struggling with the damage from the fumes
I plunge the needle deep into his vein
Completion of the murder ends his pain
Cyanide assassin <start> 

Erosion of life I see
It makes the passion burn in me
Life it always withers away
Death will eternally stay
Corpses in their coffins
Forever rest in peace 
There sleeping with the aspergillus
Is this justice to the dead 
The atrocious sight of burial ecremony
Christians weeping for the departed
They won't understand they should envy them 
The deceased they know if there's a paradise
Or shall we feel the purgatory 
I open the graves admire the rot
I can feel the presence of something beyond
Aureola of nauseating reek
Wings of shriveled skin
Holy beauty of a carcass
Divine sight for me to gaze upon 
Necrolatic  reverence for putrefaction
Necrolatic  reverence for the stench
I kneel before a carrion
I pray before the dead
I know they shall rise
I fear for the scourge
I revere power of the dead <start> I just left my house in the old tree
To hide in a place down under the earth
If ever they find the entry
They will reach my shelter <start> I stepped into the red room
I waited for the time to meet
Take me with you
I want to leave this shit
I feel you fill my body
Please hold my hand
I'm scarred but in a minute
I'll be a strong man
But why do you want from me more and more
You didn't want to cause me pain before
Do you like to kill  Look into my eyes
Would you like to kill me  Why did you tell me lies
I'm here again
For the last time I promise
I want your kind of feeling
You can't leave me like this
But why do you close the door
I'm still here inside
I know the Red room is my cage
And you'll never let me out <start> Instrumental <start> Right
Let's move move
In this life I've known nothing but seeds you've sown
I've walked the highways and I've
Combed the side roads
It's been a joy of highs oh the pain of lows
I met the Devil at the heart of the crossroads
I share
A soul with a hunting hound
My blood's a red river that flows through every town
No
Have you ever felt like I have
Cry
For me sky
Cry for me scorned scorned
Live this life insane nothing but pouring rain
I'm an outlaw it's amazing I'm
Sane
Born and dressed in black my soul is fighting back
Fueling Hell and raising cain cain cain
No
Have you ever felt
Like I have
Cry for me sky
Right
Get the fuck up get up
When I'm a ghost and gone I
'll be remembered strong 
By all I've met by friends and family
When I'm lowered down six feet in the ground
There won't be a sound except for crows
Wailing
Cry for me sky <start> Now is your time to die
We've gathered here to say goodbye
No more you'll cry
No reason left for you to fight
Feel pain no more
Emotions never felt before
Where do we go we go she'll never know
Holding on to you
To keep from falling
Your eyes are closing now
Another chapter's ending
Hard times we always saw
There's nothing left of you no more
Fear has no place no place
Cover her face
Holding on to you
To keep from falling
Your eyes are closing now
Another chapter's ending
This is our last goodbye 
This is our time tonight
Holding on to you
To keep from falling
Your eyes are closing now
Another chapter's ending
This is our time tonight <start> This is a barren wasteland
A lonely place
Where inspiration goes to die
Rescue the beauty that's left
Restore the character that's long since gone
Because these colors must never fade
This beat must carry on
We will fight to save this
We will fight to keep it alive
This is a 'cause worth fighting for
We will rescue and restore
We will fight to save this
We will fight to keep it alive
This is a 'cause worth fighting for
We will rescue and restore <start> I bring you life I bring you death.
Moments of happiness years of awful tortures.
You are a devote slave chained.
Pain is a true feeling it is the answer of mistakes you made.
You worship him you cry.
Never he will come back to you.
Lost creature dust in the wind.
Listen to the voice of the deadly abyss.
Your thoughts circle around and your views are full of fear.
It is the taste of your own blood.
Wet is it wet and warm.
I bring you life I bring you death.
Moments of happiness years of awful tortures.
You are devote slave chained. <start> Lately I
Ive been heading for a breakdown
Every time I leave my house
Well It feels just like a shake down
Between the street sweepers and the pushers are the lawyers
Who may as well be butchers
Between the small timing hustlers who all seem to feed upon each other
Oh God why you been
Hanging out in that ol violin
While Ive been waiting for you
to pull me through
Lately I
Every time I try to lie down
Well my mind just gets away
I cant even close my eyes now
Between the big fish ambition and the lovers
Using words as ammunition
Between wood planks Ive been pacing endless
Impossible dream that Ive been chasing
Oh God why you been
Hanging out in that ol violin
While Ive been waiting for you
to pull me through
Oh God
Oh God
Oh God why you been
Hanging out in that ol violin
While Ive been waiting for you
to pull me through
Oh God
Oh God
Oh God <start> It's only me my friend
Your private lucifer
An angel heaven sent down to your deepest fears
Walk with me
Talk to me again
In your sleep
When you're weak astray
I feel you right inside me

All around me

I am the golden calf
Providing hate and greed
I am the other half
Maintaining harmony
Silently violently
But pure in your sleep
When you're insecure
I feel you right inside me

All around me

I feel you right inside me

All around me

I feel you right inside me

All around me
 <start> Circle of Pain
I have no idea strong behind the weak
I have no idea silence covers your life
I have no idea no more sounds to hear
I have no idea kill
Circle of pain
I have no idea different mind in one
I have no idea the unknown depth
I have no idea motherfucking pollution
I have no idea kill
I have power power to kill
I'm stupid I'm stupid to understand
Kill  kill
I have no idea strong behind the weak
I have no idea silence covers your life
From inside
To my dark half <start> I've been so wrong in this.
What does this mean
Where did it go
All is best all is lost.
What does this mean
Where did it go
All is best all is lost all is gone.
Forever in ruin I can't just disappear.
Forever in ruin I can't let go.
Forever in ruin forever decay.
I can't see anything but you.
I can't let this go.
Still searching.
I might be missing you for years .
Every month feels like a lifetime.
When will this pass
Goodnight farewell I'm nearly done with this day.
Goodnight farewell our grace has met it's end.
Forever in ruin forever decay.
She fell in love with the city
And since then I don't mean anything.
She fell in love with the city
And since then I don't mean anything.
Forever in ruin forever decay.
Forever in ruin forever decay.
I've been so wrong in this.
What does this mean 
Where did it go 
All is best all is lost.
What does this mean
Where did it go
All is best all is lost all is gone.
Forever in ruin I can't just disappear.
Forever in ruin I can't let go.
Forever in ruin forever decay.
I can't see anything but you. <start> Back at last from yearning slumber
when the nightly drama came to a close
Hoping that fall will never come
Salute the morning sun
Inviting us to idleness
Hoping that fall will never come
The hour calls for secrecy
silently we'd slip out to the lake
Hoping that fall will never come
And I stumble as of vertigo
Can't await the sound of gentle waves
melting with the rhythm of our crave.
But today there are only elegies
Filling our tainted elysium
Still hoping that fall will never come
This place turned to a fraud mirage
Deceitful and untrue.
Still hoping that fall will never come
Embraces solace me
They hide my tears in pastel drapery
Still hoping that fall will never come
And I cry just as you
Knowing this is coming to an end
But still I am hoping that fall will never come.
But it came. <start> From the remnants of myth I come
A mythago alive once again
I was born from the mists of time
From the legends that whisper my name
I'm the dream of a thousand minds
Come to set things right
And by my honor I hereby swear
Love will conquer all
It's my gift to replenish life
Can you feel the surge of vitality
If you join me and heed my call
Together we'll redraw reality
I'm the wish of a thousand hearts
A wish to set things right
And by my honor I hereby swear
Love will conquer all
'Cause I am the maker of miracles
Chaos awake in my hand
I am your fate
I am darkness and light
In my heart and in my soul I'm divine
'Cause I am the maker of miracles
Chaos awake in my hand
I am your fate
I am darkness and light
In my heart and in my soul I'm divine <start> Instrumental <start> Never seize to be amazed by new technology. there's where i truly feel at home in all hypocrisy. I have been trying to find a place where my toughest issues can rest. Now i find a questioning lifestyle to be the best.
Let's confess we've never been blessed. The acts from our history is now our burden to bear.
Revise revise and renew.
Never stop until we've found the best for both me and you
I want you to take us back to where we started from. we need to trust to carry on.
Never seize to be amazed by new technology. there's where i truly feel at home in all hypocrisy. I have been trying to find a place where my toughest issues can rest. Now i find a questioning lifestyle to be the best.
it doesn't matter what we've done before. What will define our generation is what we've struggled for.
Determination is digging their grave. I am the joker in the game they play.
to hear is not to listen
to watch is not to see
to die is not to care for
to know is not to feel
what they believe in and focus on is fine with me. I have as much respect for them as they should have for me. In this divided world that is how it has to be. Nevertheless i'm always affected by their bigotry.

Enfrente al lado a donde miro

like animals blind in heat
But they're human all the same
copulation compulsion to breed
just anatomy and instinct lust
consumed but the product is a human life.
A malicious maternal seed
spewed forth in precarious
birth from the womb into the trash.
Precious twisting life
crawling on the filth of the dumpster floor.
Only known to the mother in guilt
as she stumbles from the
alley covered in flies.
With a ten mile stare dead to the
world she never gave one fuck
for the child inside...none.
Sucks the crack pipe in shame just to forget.
Yet with another hit she's on
the streets again in another
life she once had hope.
But that went down the drain.
Along with her pride.
Nurses habitually resigned.
Tossing the carcass in the
waste bin death legally designed
Or fixing the future with quick extraction
Conceived and thrown away
from womb into the waste.
Human trash putrid the bodies overrun.
Aborted removal with cold precision.
Tools specifically designed
forcing fetal termination.
Blind the morally enraged.
Bomb the clinic into oblivion.
Kill the killer they will say.
Justice through murder goes both ways.
Conceived and thrown away
from womb into the waste.
One more girl mortified.
Never knew what was growing within.
Obese diseased down on her knees
she gave birth on the toilet seat.
Insert anesthetize.
Late term feticide.
Orphan spawned from rape.
Short lived half a face.
Crackhead whore for host.
Hatching living ghosts.
Pregnant drunk and high.
It was no surprise when
she left it there to die.
One more girl who could never conceive.
Psychopath maternitymad.
Took a steel bat to her mother's head
hacked her up and took the baby out.
One more girl six months in
takes a hanger and a bottle of pills.
The prolife priest has nothing to
say as the embryo's scraped away.
Straight into the trash with the
unborn offspring generations
dead in time progeny unwanted.
Dead flesh pile a mass of cells
 more bags and the landfill swells.
Ripened mass fetal decay

The darkest light
Ancient sigh of the vanish hopes
Drunk from wound
Of a crying bowel
Smeared by bloody
Torment's agony
Sneers my heart demised
Dreadful mistakes
Cloak of untruth embraced me
Silent refuge of a fragile love
Pouring prayer up to be
Silent omen an afraid image
Sneers my heart demised
Dreadful mistakes
They're gonna take me down
Living horror of my face
A reflection deep into my lust
Slowly turning friendly look
My remorse will be washed away
Sneers my heart demised
Dreadful mistake
They're gonna take me down
I keep on to go down  <start> Hope springs eternal in the human being
confront the truth of life

To be free again
To be free again

Burning in his eyes <start> Babylon asleep an everlasting foe
Striving to hurt for flesh becomes dirt
Resting within the sacred fire
I can't withhold the lies untold
Dances and cries a descent to Babylon
Wine in my hand a descent to Babylon
All eyes must foul in stench of fear
Killing to quench Babylon's tears
We are whispering for holy wine
Innocence to reign a world of shrines
This crazy dream raging over ages
For only one belief.
Killing suffer for a thought
In human blood stretched out
A descent to a  deaths
As sweet as snow as cold as dew
A descent to a  deaths. <start> We have the initiative to kill
You will be the prey tonight
Fighting hard shoot you dead at will

Screaming harder this time
Stunning your senses
Blinding your eyes
Submission comes fast when you're hit
Destructor defies

Decieve us  you shall die
Moving fast killing what we can
We are Destructor we will defy

Gleaming swords of metal steal the fight
You shall die a mean  mighty death

Evil embrace of powers unnatural
You're left in silence nothing more to behold
You close your eyes and visualize an evil getaway
It's here it's near
I see it all so clear
Tonight your flight will take you higher
It's here it's near
You live a life of fear
Tonight's the night that will inspire
Crying alone at night your destiny unknown
Your every being full of rage and hate
Seems like you're running but you just can not hide
It's your raging fear of solitude that's left behind

Just never push my back against the wall
Beaten senseless violent relentless
No hope defenseless beaten senseless
Now you pushed me over the edge
Can't take it no more I'm seeing red
Beaten senseless over the head

Times are good or bad happy or sad

Ooh tell me why can't we stay together

No need to fear of the unknown
We made it all the way to this
So get off your knees
Six feet and counting no where but down
Six feet and counting together under the ground
Close your eyes it's time to sleep
A lullaby too haunt your dreams
Can you see the light
At the end of the road
Don't waste your breath no time to speak
A second chance is all we need
All you see is darkness
In a world with no hope
Six feet and counting no where but down
All affairs in order it's time to go
Dead man walking I thought you should know
There's no sign of stopping the bridges have burned
We're left alone the match is our own.
Six feet and counting no where but down
Six feet and counting together under the ground
Close your eyes it's time to sleep
A lullaby too haunt your dreams
Can you see the light
At the end of the road
Don't waste your breath no time to speak
A second chance is all we need
All you see is darkness
In a world with no hope
Say goodbye the time has come
We were promised forever it will not be broke
Say goodbye the time has come
We were promised forever it will not be broke
Say goodbye the time has come

Don't waste your breath no time to speak

Awaken from this dream
Remove this blindfold
Of perfect words
That have done nothing
But deceive

To scream in harmony
Against the stronghold
That has taken so many
By there throats
I hope for voices
To sing in harmony
And for us to stand
With bleeding hearts
And to look away from the sky
That offers us nothing but poison
And to look at one another
And to look at one another

Of purity
This is reality
Do not be deceived
By the shallow beauty of words

Your actions

In this war <start> A barefoot walk everyday on a winding road. Biting dust in my face.
A captured look...down the shore. Youll better breathe before.
And you can cry it out theres no bloom for me.
Without any doubt just to wait and see.
And you should scream and shout to feast on me.
...to feast on me.
Broken steps  stumbling legs falling down deep. Safety bond  crushing heads.
Laying down...on the ground. No more tears to count.
And you can cry it out theres no bloom for me.
Without any doubt just to wait and see.
And you should scream and shout to feast on me.
...to feast on me. <start> instrumental <start> You've got to choose that what side you on boy
To win or to lose to build or to destroy
Move on with this muthafuckin' breakdown
Bring down the whole town

Face of an angel soul of a devil
Learn like a newborn wise like an old man
Your worse self who just can't be beaten
You can't see me
You can't hear me
You just feel me
Invisible enemy a shadow that bites

A part of your mind but I will get out <start> Oh my engine's burning

Bitter things seek meaning
Even if they're madness to behold
Once forbears to horizons
Where the dead stayed dreaming
Now nightmares waken souls
That fear the living's toll
Gova Bosch and Brueghel
Three times moonwise stain thy graves
For words alone are at loss to trace
The face of today's inhuman wraith
One half adrift in the vast abyss
Of despair and misery
The other a mask of rich red lips
Whetted by the fevers of belief and greed
All damned in this inferno
Where even Virgil averts his eyes
From the black mass mutual gang rape
Of Caesing hands an forced divides
Trespass these seven gates
To a world bloodlet to shades
Where Seraphim bleat
Of their cold and coming Master's race
In the seweres of Babylon
Stillborn to a trough anon
Chimiracles will hatch like plots
To dredge faeces to pearl their cross
Enter Penteholocaust
Five aeons past yet still Man grasps
At final straws to save his cast
His Lord is a leper we shall not want
He betrayed us with white lies
His acrid pall as of the tomb
Reminds us how we rot inside
Gutted like fool's paradise
Glutted on cruel appetites
Holding court to chaos
Folding to far graver arms
A downfall fatal to all resounds
As orgies peak in self centred psalms
And nature screams her sufferings
Under bowed and cankered wings
A bleak scorched Earth necrotica burning
Like the robes we've torn from her
She begs us lay her pain to rest
Lest we are left with nothingness
Save for her stripped and ravished flesh
And if her fate is not portent of Apocalypse
Then the comets that graxe nightskies
Will surely cleanse of wrongs and reichs
When you and I and all else dies
It's rotting down
This carcass Maggotropolis
Interdependent as worms to the grave
Allah's true name is naught
Chist cannot save
Locked in a waltz of evermore frantic steps
Spells of regret
Death Magick for Adepts
Be prepared to fulfill prophecies
The glorious fall of a sin dynasty
Gutted like fool's paradise
Glutted on cruel appeitites
We've woven hearts a thorn arbour
Left tear streaked reason upon the shore
And bereft of compass star or more
Set out for this World's end
Few at the prow most slave below
Painting coal a perfect gold
But for all it's worth the engines slow
Dead in the brine again
Come cabin fever sodomy on the bounty
Prey to phallus seas
That hiss and foam to douse disease
A storm roars on the way
Blacker than the Ace of Rapes
Dealt out by Death in darkwood glades
Our ship of fools all boards handmade
Sinks dashed by seismic waves <start> Escape from reality is a good medicine for my mind
There's nothing to think about in the Garden of Eden I feel fine
It takes all my energy to be able to succeed
I lie still and kill then I'll be ready to be the King
Maybe it is too easy but i don't need anybody to save me
Maybe I'm busy but everyone obeys me
To be or not to be
It's now the time to make my choice
To be or not to be God
I wonder if I'll ever answer the question about my life
When I'm not even close to really seeing what we hide inside
Maybe it is too easy but i don't need anybody to save me
Maybe I'm busy but everyone obeys me
To be or not to be
It's now the time to make my choice
To be or not to be God <start> I've got myself deep this time
Tons of frustration builds in mine
And it shows me nothing
It shows me nothing at all
Circle the drain
Backward solace right from your side
And you sit and criticize
Shows me nothing
It shows me nothing at all
Circle the drain
I don't need it I don't
It shows me nothing
It shows me nothing at all
Circle the drain
I don't need it I don't <start> Shadow culture arise a call to arms
The time of burning has come
Armed with bombs and hatred
A new holocaust of Christians has come
Balors one eye is watching us
Our hearts grow cold to all life
The hour for devastation of humanity
Is ours in which to rise and burn
Wrath of the black wraiths
Force of hate devastate
Goat cults rise to strike
Building a Dark Age. Burning the old age
Architect soldiers. Armed with malice and bullets
On into final war. Burning human scum
Nuclear fires rage
Nothing will stop us from burning these fuckers
Reaffirming our stranglehold on humanity
Our webs grow even tighter
A intricate design of a web of laws
To choke you ugly things
We are more beautiful and brighter than your God
You are small and ugly. We detest your weakness
We will obliterate your ugly race
And the devour your God
Holy repulsive humans
We wash your filth in atom fires
Born of hate we will kill you
The ancient signals reaffirmed
Death is our king he is back
 destroyer of man
 billion worms dead at fast
The beast awake man is dead
My hopes are done. I weep with euphoric joy <start> Tragedy seems to come in a pair of expensive shows
Never notice the disguise until it walks up and slaps you in the mouth
Can't say that is very subtle at all
But who knows maybe just maybe just....I might shut you up
Think you can listen for a second
Hope you aren't too bothered or busy
Better do something about that wound
lt festering your reek of decay and its coming from the inside out
Have I got your attention now
I've got your attention now
Well it sure took long enough I can spit in those wounds
That might help
Really I'll bet you thought the world owed you a whole lot more
Sorry to push your not buttons it's what I do
Pretty much perfected this after thousands of years
You should savor these moments <start> From birth we're taught how to survive
We're taught how war is waged
And there are no men now alive
Who stops our wild rampage
Light at heart we bide our bane
whatever death awaits
Norsemen live without regrets
We accept our woven fates
So fearlessly we charge ahead
There is no time to hesitate
Don't despair show no fear
Live your life without regrets
Don't despair and show no fear
In the face of a certain death
A coward thinks he'll always live
If it keeps himself from strife
Old age leaves no rest and peace
though spears may spare his life
We don't mourn a friend that fell
or dread the day we'll fall ourselves
Warriors don't go to Hel
'cause we know Ygg will greet us well
Fearlessly we charge ahead
There is no time to hesitate
Don't despair show no fear
Live your life without regrets
Don't despair and show no fear
In the face of a certain death
So raise your horns to those who died
Let's drink to fallen friends tonight
Let's celebrate their glory life
We'll meet again in Valhall when we die
When we die
When we die <start> Ride a horse that's cleaving through
The air and space of dreams
Travelling through time
All alone I pray
Where am I Who am I
And that old man trust in me
His words are running now
Because we have lost all guides
You're extended now to a world of light
You're not the one
You think you are
Since you were born
You're only love
On a mount I'm standing now
And it's coming over me
That I'm not here
I am on another plane
Humping around hit myself
I returned inside of me
Tears sliding down my face

And the horse is leaving me
Running out of space
Running out of reach
You're not the one
You think you are
Since you were born
An Indian tribe <start> Di setiap langkahku kau slalu membayangi
Gerak gerikmu kadang buatku tersipu

Ingin kuungkapkan tapi malu rasanya
Berkali kucoba sungguh aku tak bisa

I think I'm falling in love <start> Even if I act sometimes
Like a split personality
I am obsessed by you
Like a polypeptide of someone else's mind
But I know I'd better sleep
Sleep into a land where I find
The stairway to my personal void
My possession
Enthused a sudden voice
In a vain attempt
I leave you with this thought
Nothing isn't anything but it's
Tasteless and it's flat
Nothing if it's anything it is
Even less than that
I look around while something is in my head
Like a ton of lard
Like a death at a birthday party
I've got to spoil the fun
Nothing isn't anything but it's
Tasteless and it's flat
Nothing if it's anything it is
Even less than that
I don't want to bleed in vain
In a painful freeze
With a heart disease called love
By the frozen trees <start> Instrumental <start> A long dark tunnel
Lies before me
Through the pain of afterlife
I reach for the light
What was shall be again
Though in a different form
Erased and blank
I enter life
The path lies open I'm free to choose
From the multitude of options
To let my instincts guide me
Through this long and winding walk
Greeted by depressing fear
Can't go forward but can't go back
Cold and dark remembrance
The years that pass before my eyes
My body grows weak and die
The cycle of death is complete
Restrained in moral chains <start> Letting go is the hardest thing i know
like this bullet pierces through my skull
the end
i love the feeling of steel in my heart
like i lobe the bitter taste of your kiss
natural bliss
i'm a sucker for a happy ending
interrupted by a nightmare
here comes love
chivalry
take a knife to your wrists make a bloodbath
cut it deep it's the nes thing
baby please make this last forever
you're the latest fashion theme. <start> An evil face
The eyes so cold
The dark labyrinth of the human mind
Key to a kingdom
A world of bones
New revelation anger is the fuel
I am a sinner
On the last dreadful day of judgement
Heaven
I unbind all spirits who
Abide this hole
In symbols speaking
I woke you from the deepest dream
Open the gates
Behold your sentence
In the sign of the cross
And the crown of thorns <start> Estaba mirando los restos del ayer
Estaba llorando por lo que fue y no es
Su tierra arrasada su origen tambin
Sus antepasados claman delante de el
Y cantan ooeea al recuerdo del ayer
Y bailan ooeea al gran pueblo que siempre fue
La brisa en el rostro la tarde al caer
El espritu del guerrero le recuerda lo que es
El guila vuela tras el ritual
Y danza en el cielo cuando el sol se va
Y cantan ooeea al recuerdo del ayer
Y bailan ooeea al gran pueblo que siempre fue
Y la luna dibuja en la pradera un gran corazn
Y en esos hijos de Amrica la esperanza volvi
Y cantan ooeea al recuerdo del ayer
Y bailan ooeea al gran pueblo que siempre fue
Y la luna dibuja en la pradera un gran corazn
Y en esos hijos de Amrica la esperanza volvi
Y en esos hijos de Amrica la esperanza volvi <start> Magnnimas creaciones
A costa de sangre y dolor
Un reino esplendoroso
Tendrs la vida eterna
Nac con este sello
No habr lamentos si oracin
Un Crisol de aleluyas
Y siempre adoracin
Para ti
Volvers
Las lgrimas del Nilo
Invocan falsos dolos
No encuentro el eslabn perdido
Que anida mi destino
A ti te pertenecen
El da y oscuridad
Pero hay mentes que cambian
Decadencia letal
Lealtad eterna
El bramido de la tormenta
En el desierto seala el final
Y un mar de laberintos
Secretos guardarn
Sueos de libertad
solo Vctor
solo Cecilio <start> This is your ambition your vision
You don't back from your position
You enquire you desire play to win
There can be only one
Every hill feels unclimbable
But the power of will can defeat anything you're unbreakable
It's the moment you choose that you never can lose throwing caution straight to the wind
You will rise to your best when you're put to the test you're unchainable
There can be only
One way one life one chance to make it all count
Show you're fearless let them hear you roar
The roar of the underdog
This is here this is the now
This is the chance to make it all count
Show you're fearless let them hear you roar
The roar of the underdog
This is my revolution my collusion
I will stand for my intrusion
My agenda won't surrender
The will of stone is solid to the bone
Every step feels untakeable
But the fire within can transcend anything I'm unquenchable
If you step to the side you will never get by in a world that runs over you
I will rise to my best when I'm put to the test I'm unbreakable
There can be only
One way one life one chance to make it all count
Show you're fearless let them hear you roar
The roar of the underdog
This is here this is the now
This is the chance to make it all count
Show you're fearless let them hear you roar
The roar of the underdog <start> Let's get it on
It's time to get in the game
You gotta fight 'til it hurts
And then you do it again
Let's tear it up
I'm staying straight to the core
Ain't no room for second place
Go big or go home
Rise
It's dog eat dog
Rise
Man versus beast
Rise
The strong will survive
Rise
I've got no time for the weak
It's time to rise up man up get back up
Never bend and won't be broken
Dust off and then come back for more
You've gotta reach down dig deep and break ground
Show them all you won't be beaten
Brush it off and then come back for more
Come back for more
It's do or die
Time to settle the score
Gotta give it all you got and then you give it some more
There will be blood
You've gotta fight 'til you break
Talk a lot of trash and step up to the plate
Rise
Refuse to give in
Rise
Ashes to dust
Rise
Make 'em remember your name
Rise
'cause in yourself you can trust
It's time to rise up man up get back up
Never bend and won't be broken
Dust off and then come back for more
You've gotta reach down dig deep and break ground
Show them all you won't be beaten
Brush it off and then come back for more
Come back for more
Rah
It's time to rise up man up get back up

Brush it off and then come back for more
Come back for more
Rah <start> I wash my hands of the troubled past
A brand new feast and I trimmed the fat
Our time is precious we start anew
The fruits abundant without you
A chance to deliver prepared to attack
What's rightfully ours and we'll take it all back
No time for reflection just time to proceed
A nonstop mission of force and release
We won't be upended
And we won't be denied
Relentless revolution
Join us or step aside
A chance to deliver prepared to attack
What's rightfully ours and we'll take it all back
No time for reflection just time to proceed
A nonstop mission of force and release
We won't be upended
And we won't be denied
Relentless revolution
Join us or step aside
The selfish remain in a world unjust
The wretched do pay for the power they lust
And they will feel when their world cracks
A blood red sky and seas of black
We won't be upended
And we won't be denied
Relentless revolution
Join us or step aside <start> At night I swim the dark depths
so hard so much of it
oceans drown feelings somewhere
time is not a friend
hearts got empty and don't remember
I cannot fly anymore
the dreamed lands remain far from here
mysterious and unknowing
I can understand so much
I remember only one moment
when the dreams died
and when they left only heavens wept
from the clouds with rain
the thoughts have fallen down
the dreams have fallen down
no way leads to the stars now
no thought will ever enrapture
I dissapear in darkness
no thinking of words of freedom
everything I forgot somewhere <start> Who Will
Measure the dimensions of antumnos
Who can tell the gauge of its veil
Who can manifest the size of its maw
And infer the value of its stones
Yet the glowing wick will not be quenched
The sown fire will nerver die
What ever was
what ever is to come
What would
What ever should
It will remain as it nerver was
Eternity's past was repeated in time
The eternal knot will be unbroken
Whence comes the motion in this picture
Where does the moment go when it steals away
Who will pen the pages of time
Who will be the audience when the curtain rises
Yet the glowing wick will not be quenched
The sown fire will nerver die
What ever was
what ever is to come
What would
What ever should
It will remain as it nerver was <start> Music  Lyrics Sean Peck  Eric Horton  Barber <start> Midnight we kill.
We slaughter the tongue of revolution.
To our graves we are marked by the stain of lust.
How many times can I trust in you my beloved friend
Because every time I trust I lose.
So I believe in nothing nothing.
Because of you I still believe in nothing.
Because of you I still believe in nothing.
I'll always know my place in this world.
No longer fit in your fucking world anymore.
Your lust ruins everything.
Like a growing target on my back I feel the knives are chasing.
See my eyes are no longer blind.
See my eyes are no longer blind.
There is a purpose in life today.
Destroying you every step of the way.
From this point on  no more friends.
I know my role in this world.
Don't fit in your fucking world.
This once meant everything to me.
Now another forgotten effigy.
Because only scars remain.
Broken bones form a hope that's been left grey.
I die every time I hear your fucking name.
Been left grey.
Been left grey.
And there is a purpose in life today.
Rise to your feet as we march to our graves.
Fight back.
There is a purpose in life today.
Rise to your feet as we march to our graves.
I can still feel your thoughts ripping me apart tearing me apart.
Ripping you apart. tearing us apart. <start>

Come to life these walls
Fade before your eyes
Enter a distant realm of
Abnormalities we had the
Same dream only I believe
We belong in the unknown
We belong to fear
For we know
Our time is yet to come
At sunset we will learn
To rise again
One day the dead will come
To life marching on
Black masses every night <start> Spirit A genuine soul to dwell on baleful grounds
Glances wandering around
In the darkness of the world
Clouds have closed a ring around the sky
While the old ones hear the chimes
Through the darkness of the world
A genuine man will realize
He must fawn upon the times
While he shouldn't waste a word
Tender feet on stoney ground
See the young ones stray around
Through the darkness of the world
Aaron Sacred heart will you usher me now
For I'll carry the lantern your way
For I'll bring us home
Spirit Dark is the night scarlet the moon
Sacred the light in the haze reflecting within
Aaron Blazing the trail
Be still my restless heart
Obsidian's the sky
Inward you look as you halt
Spirit Be still restless heart
Aaron I'm on my way
Spirit Under obsidian skies
Aaron Wake to the sound of passing time
How could I quantify it
in the darkness of the world
Wake to the shadow of a dream
Nothing's what it seems
As you brave the darkness of the world
Spirit Ghost lights and matter
You'll know what is real
Perception and fact All the same
Truth's what you feel
Dark is the night scarlet the moon

Inward you look as you halt
Spirit Be still restless heart
Aaron I'm on my way
Under obsidian skies
Spirit And the wind and the rain
that were shaking the pane
move onward along with the clouds
And you're gazing in awe
at the ghost lights above
as if stars cut their way through the shroud
On and on and on...
Spirit Moon shines
Ghost lights
Oh they reach out for you
Blazing the trail under obsidian skies
Aaron Dark is the night scarlet the moon
Sacred the light in the haze reflecting within
Blazing the trail
Be still my restless heart

Spirit Obsidian's the sky
Inward you look as you halt
Be still restless heart
Aaron I'm on my way <start> Since the dawn of time
It has reigned supreme
It's running through our veins
A primal legacy
Deep within a blackened heart
The surge of raw aggression
Rages deep inside
Unavoidable instinct
Waiting to be free
Live for vengeance
Revel in violence
In the heat of conflict
Hatred takes control
Embedded in our genes
Hate lay hidden
Blood is the trigger
To the acts of the forbidden <start> A child is told from day number one
He's a worthless piece of shit bad and dumb
Generations pass down low selfesteem
We're molded by the things we've heard and we've seen
Or punched in the mouth for being uns
ure
Or locked behind a closet door
We learn what we live and live what we learn
Abuse of innocence to evil we turn
Can anybody hear their cries
Can anybody tell them why
You gotta read between their lies
People die when love is denied
One of many lessons I learned to be like
You ain't gonna live like you
You made me what I am today
Close to you yet so far away
The pain you lived with made you ill
An empty hole with nothing to fill
I forgive and love you forever still
A waste of time
a waste of life
Livin' on the edge of a sharp fucking knife
I can't blame you for never being around
I know you never meant to hurt me and bring me down
Look in their eyes to hear their cries
And you will see the all their pain lying dormant inside
Now realise as time passes by
That people die when love is denied

g to rain
Always stand alone hold the wall up with my back
Or else you might get pushed on to the tracks <start> Night falls and dark dreams start rising
They crawl upon me and oppress me silent
Chasing my soul to drink the fear blooming in me  save me
And then a flash awakens me
Alive Alive I scream
Whatever I have seen it crawls after me

The essence of my dream drips into reality  let me be

Caught in a dream there is no escape

When my mind is what's imprisoning me

Caught in a dream they're coming closer

Set me free

Fears become flesh reality is melting
I drown within the seas of endless horror
Sane no more cold claws solidify and grab at me
And then a flash awakens me
Alive Alive I scream 
Whatever I have seen it crawls after me

The essence of my dream drips into reality  set me free

Drown in... drown in... me
Drown in... drown in... me
Caught in a dream there is no escape

When my mind is what's imprisoning me

Caught in a dream they're coming closer

Set me free

Caught in a dream I move in darkness

There's no escape when
Your mind's the prison

Caught in a dream he's coming closer

Set me free
Move on...
Caught in a dream there is no escape

When my mind is what's imprisoning me

Caught in a dream they're coming closer

Set me free

Caught in a dream I move in darkness

There's no escape when
Your mind's the prison

Caught in a dream he's coming closer

Set me free
Move on... <start> Search for my subconscious
Lead me into myself
A need to discover the dark
A will to enter these gates
Oh this temptation
To end this empty life
In my dreams I saw my real side
A journey through forever
My vision's oh so bright
Watching eternity open
As I turn out life's light
Oh this temptation
To leave this earthly shell
Deep inside the toll of death's bell
In the cold winds of nowhere
With a sigh I pass away
Falling into harmonic sleep
Then I'll find my prophecies wasn't lies
Falling into the abyss I come...
I... I am dying...
Death... Does heal me...
In the cold winds of nowhere <start> I've got such a filthy heart sometimes.
When you take me to that place and I never want to leave.
In the middle of the night.
When everyone is sounds asleep.
Where will you be
You'll be waiting with a gasmask in the dark.
I can't stop myself.
She calls home when I'm not there so I won't freeze.
I need to learn how to breathe.
When I'm inside you.
Sever the ripcord sever it.
I drift away further down.
Inside it gets so fucking cold.
I come to you to feel helpless.
Further down.
You know it's hard to free myself and you just keep driving until its over.
Until they swallow every last drop of me and you.
I need to learn how to breathe.
Further down.
I reach inside.
Further down.
I can't hide.
I tried to show you that there's nothing you can take away from me.
Nothing you can take away from me.
Kill me.
You're such a beautiful liar.
Take me to the place where I'm king.
Nothing like the way that you wanted.
When you left me behind <start> Father don't cry
It's not so bad here
I'm doing this all on my own
Everyone else keeps passing me by
I float through this place all alone
I know it doesn't seem like you'll recover
Suffering that never goes away
But I'm here with you
So carry me through
Use me as a light to guide your way
Revisiting this old familiar place
Just to see if you could find a trace
It's time to say goodbye
At least you have to try
For me
Waiting
Wasting
Away without you here
I'll come around just give me a reason
Drifting
Sinking
Searching for a way
To reach out and pull you close
I know it doesn't seem like you'll recover
Suffering that never goes away
But I'm here with you
So carry me through
Use me as a light to guide your way
I know it doesn't seem like you'll recover
Suffering that never goes away
But I'm here with you
So carry me through
Use me as a light to guide your way
Don't you cry now
Go to sleep
Dry your eyes
Don't wait for me
Don't you cry now
Go to sleep
Dry your eyes
Don't wait for me
Don't you cry now
Go to sleep
Dry your eyes
Don't wait for me
Don't you cry now
Go to sleep
Dry your eyes
Don't wait
Don't wait for me
Don't you cry now
Go to sleep
Dry your eyes
Don't wait for me
Don't you cry now
Go to sleep
Dry your eyes
Don't wait for me
I know it doesn't seem like you'll recover
Suffering that never goes away
But I'm here with you
So carry me through

Suffering that never goes away
But I'm here with you
So carry me through
Use me as a light to guide your way <start> instrumental <start> Cast down from heaven

Shredded for consumption
Thrust the sickle

Angels wings torn....

Revelations are coming
Silent lambs slaughtered XVIII <start> Mark how our shadow Mark Movits mom frere
One small darkness encloses
How gold and purple that shovel there
To rags and rubbish disposes
Charon beckons from tumultuous waves
Then trice this ancient digger of graves
For thee ne'er grapeskin shall glister
Wherefore my Movits come help me to raise
A gravestone over our sister
Even desirous and modest adobe
Under the sighing branches
Where time and death a marriage forebode
Twixt beauty and ugliness ashes
To thee ne'er jealousy findeth her way
Nor happiness footstep swift to stray
Flitteth amid these barrows
E'en enmity armed as thou seest this day
Piously breaketh her arrow
The little bell echoes the great bells groan
Robed in the door the precentor
Noisome with quiristers prayerful moan
Blesses those who enter
The way to this templed city of tombs
Climbs amid roses yellowing blooms
Fragments of mouldering biers
'Til blackclad each mourner
His station assumes
Bows there deeply in tears <start> Today I watched the sunset in the East
Turns out it was the sunrise


I watched the sky as the moon was left reflecting on the day
I scared you away so
If I can't have you I'll just close my eyes
And pretend she is you.. Pretend you are mine
I can see the world through your window
And I sing to you every night from here
Today I prayed my plane would crash
You'd hear the news
And you'd think of me as much as I thought of you
And if you never repeat my words
You said them before and I remember the sound
I keep the lights off
I know you're right here
No matter what you can't say no to me in my dreams
Your routine is so divine. I have it memorized
As you walk to your window with your light on inside
I know you'll never find me here
As you admire the view
Do you know how pretty you look with your hair down
I walk to the window admiring the view
 <start> I have seen the god
when world went in decline
When kill of the man
was committed under shadow of the cross
I have heard the god
when cries of child suffering
reached our damned ears
but nobody was to care
I have smelled the god
when victims of gruesome murders
rotted deep in the vast forests
half eaten by beasts
In the mind of weakness
something touches those souls
who crave of power and might
of immortal power <start> The nightmare closed around me
Leaving me to face a universe
As bleak and bare as the scars of my rotten soul
Cutting the silver cord
The beginning of this odyssey
Crushing the skulls of those committing betrayal
I begun the funeral procession requiem for an eternal rest
Even within the tideless seas surrounding me
The fields of graves they call my name my name...
Lead the war lead the battle
With no mercy we reach our revelation

Fanga under is

Fall in flames
Trapped under ice
Ridden by nightmares forever <start> Destiny is calling you passing through your edge of heart

Live to survive live for my life
Just like... those stars <start> 
Once there was
A waste of ice
Where Kadath rested
With its towers
Once there was
An ancient king
Whose emblems were
 globes
Lost in times
Forgotten by mankind
The King has hide
His dark globes
I miss You
Oh my King
Where is your land
Where are your globes
Beyond the highlands of Leng beyond the Mountains of Madness along
the great waste of ice there lie the ruins of the unknown Kadath
surrounded by the great walls of gore with its dark towers that strike
the stars there lies the Abominion gate to the Abyss of the Outer
Spaces
there  lies in the sleep of death dreaming the triumph of his
revenge
but one day even the death will die...
There the globes rest
Keys to their King
the mighty Yugsuduk
Convex gate to the Outer Spaces.
Find'em
He wrote
Unleash me
On his stone.
Where is it
Where are you <start> I remember the time we first viewed the skies
With warmth in our hearts and diamonds in our eyes
I remember the day those diamonds greyed
And what seemed eternal began to fade
I couldn't find that secret place
Where we would go in our embrace
All that I found was I was holding on
To those clear blue skies and the setting sun
You pushed your fingers to my lips
looked into my eyes and walked away
Caught in the dark of our eclipse
I guess nothing gold can stay
My world is so different
there's a void that you once filled
My past feels so distant
I think it's time that I rebuild
The structures left inside of me
Caught outside of myself
I cannot tear my eyes away
The clearest skies that stretch for miles
Blacken and turn to grey
Sever all the ties
Turn on your heel and walk away
As what we have dies I have nothing left to say
Mistakes were made and I admit
its all my fault that it went to shit
But life goes on it was a hell of a show
it could never have lasted you had to go
Hold on
Caught outside of myself
I cannot tear my eyes away
The clearest skies that stretch for miles
Blacken and turn to grey
Blacken and turn to grey <start> These embers turn to flames of yearning
I walked behind for too long
I can't stop the bleeding
These open wounds you left aren't healing
How the days just burn away
For you I wished for something better
Cover my mouth and take my breath away
You killed the life inside of me
You walked away and left me to crawl
These changes in your heart deserving
Nothing more than to say you were right
Cover my mouth and take my breath away
You killed the life inside of me
You walked away and left me to crawl
Open your wrists I'll let you bleed on me
Don't live another day
You walked away and left me to crawl
These open wounds aren't healing
Nothing is forever
And when I dream of the light in your eyes
I still reach for you into the night
Nothing is forever
Cover my mouth and take my breath away
You killed the life inside of me
You walked away and left me to crawl
Cover my mouth and take my breath away
You killed the life inside of me
You walked away and left me to crawl <start> I wish to turn around and return 
but this calling is strong and denial is impossible
No measure of weight can justify what now presses into my chest
To the road your freedom is awesome
but does it compare to the sweet embrace of my love
Our convictions engraved by her marvelous hands
My ears are upon the brink of detonation
and the mud amongst the passage of my throat is drying to permanence
Harvest the crop of memories
To what's true I offer thanks
I've found what's pure and I've found what's sweet
We are not barren <start> Rip it. Tearing me. Need it bad. Need that pain inside of me.
There's no pain without my name.
There is no pain without...
Said rip you baby yeah.
So tight.
Say you wanna make it in the nightime's deadly stare.
Never ever dreamed I'd deliver such a deep forbidden lair.
Tempt you to make it I'll take you for a ride.
Forever down by the river where I'll breathe you deep inside.
Say push... Say push it in... Say push... Say push it... in.
There is no pain without my name.
There is no pain in here.
Said rip you baby yeah.
So tight.
Rip it.
Gonna take you inside of me.
Gonna break you.
See what you can say.
Pain
Strip... In a fever lick my carcass.
I need to rape your shattered bones.
In a fever you were taken from my bed.
I need to suck you in.
My severed sore... you were a victim baby of my pain within.
Tormented twin my pain within.
To live without your presence is but a sin.
Because I need your pain
I need your pumping brain.
I need to break you.
In a fever I let my pain die.
I need to rape your shattered bones.
In a fever you were taken from my bed.
I need to suck... This.
My severed sore... you were a victim baby of my pain within.
Tormented twin my pain within.
To live without your presence is but a sin.
Because I need your pain
I need your pumping brain.
I need to break you.
Rip it ripping... Tearing... Need it yeah
I need to strip the flesh.
For pain.
Pain
Strip flesh <start> A raven came to me
Spoke to me in my dream
A long lost prophecy
A forgotten legacy
Echoes of yesterday
Won't let these dreams fade away
All the beauty I adored
At the edge of the world
Across the universe
Time is to be reversed
No shelter can be found
To this fate we are bound
Behold the final hour
The last times will be dour
All life falls into gorge
Of the end of the world
Burning skies
On the vengeance's night
Devastating scythe
Of the ancient Light
I saw the might
Of the ancient Light
And the beauty of the perishing world
There's no tomorrow
We have been warned
The sky's bird struck fire
Made a flame flare up
The north wind burnt the clearing
The northeast quite consumed it
It burnt all the trees to ash and reduced them to dust <start> It's early morning
And the sun holds no redemption for me
And I then discover
All the scratches running up and down my spine
From the other night
I stagger onward
And the pain is nearly crippling me
Such sweet destruction
I'm a glutton when the decadence tastes right
Like the other night
The euphoric feeling is so right
When it seizes control all my inhibitions are left behind
And I know that reality really won't mind
A benevolent soul who desires to leave all their cares behind
Later in the evening
I can hear all the vices calling to me
So I take another
Little taste to liberate my mind
From the finest kind
Yeah the night's beginning
And the sea of bodies crowd around me
Ready to remember
All the greatest moments lived in their lifetime
For another night
The euphoric feeling is so right
When it seizes control all my inhibitions are left behind
And I know that reality really won't mind
A benevolent soul who desires to leave all their cares behind
I'm not the only one learn a little lesson from me
I'm a leviathan focused on fulfilling a need
The faint of heart observe the bolder ones setting the bar
A feeding frenzy when the starving just forget where they are
You're in denial when you say you never wanted a taste
And you don't really want to let this stimulant go to waste
So don't deny it go on and try it
I'm looking forward to the moment when your mind will fall in love with the haze
The euphoric feeling is so right
When it seizes control all my inhibitions are left behind
And I know that reality really won't mind
A benevolent soul who desires to leave all their cares behind
The euphoric feeling is so right
When it seizes control all my inhibitions are left behind
And I know that reality really won't mind
A benevolent soul who desires to leave all their cares behind <start> Winds of Odin guide us
Over violent seas the silent grave
Gods of thunder
Roaring crackling power
In flashing light they pound the night
Rising winds and howling fury
Towering shadows crashing down
As we awaken and behold
The crystal seas and ships of gold
To the colored winds our sails arise
The distant shore before us lies
Winds of Odin whisper
Over silent waves no trace remains
We have found a new horizon
Far beyond the stars that shine above
Thrashing wings valkyries rising
To the hollowed halls of Valhalla <start> Una unica obsesion atenaza mi interior
Esgrimiendo esa dulce sensacion mas
Persiguiendo mi destino
Es mas fuerte que uno mismo
La calle no me hizo olvidar
Porque la vida me hizo llegar a esta jodida
Situacion sin salida sin manera de volver
Controla mi sangre se lleva todo en mi
La mente viaja hacia ese lugar
Y este mundo real acaba por morir
Mar adentro me llevo
Tentacion que me cego
Atrapado en su poder
Atrapado luchare
El huracan de fuego ya esta aqui
Cabalga sin rumbo Viajando sin fin
Una ola de exceso que me perdio que me llevo
Puta droga hizo que no fuera yo
Manana tal vez logre vencer
Y que este mundo irreal quede tras de mi
Mar adentro me llevo
Tentacion que me cego
Atrapado en su poder
Atrapado luchare
Al filo de la locura me encontre
Sagrado era el aire que un dia respire
Pero un dia volvera <start> I feel the pain blessed is the touch on my face
I can see what you want me to see
This velvet jail has bound me
and now surrounds me
I feel your temptation
awaiting for salvation
Chorus
Blaspheming forgiveness
You'll find no sanctuary here
Deceptions entwining your realm
Your demons suspicions familiar yet they're so estranged
You're haunted by your own regrets
It's drowning me I can't escape
Enslaved it's too late
Breathe near me
Just enough to catch my breath
You stare in your denial
Why don't you just set me free
I wish for temptation
Still waiting for salvation
Chorus
Solo
I feel no pain
Your shame will leave
no scars on my face
I have seen nothing that you wanted
Ilusions I've created
that now surround you
You feel my temptation
There will be no salvation
Chorus <start> Oh yeah
Watching a face and a smile and a light
When yo're walking alone in the street
I know your look always gives you the might
Many miles from your ass to your feet
And I dream what I've seen
Is what I want it to be selfmade reality
How many miles to the gate of reality
How many steps left to go to my dreams
How many miles to the land where my dreams come true
Dreams which come true just have died
Look like a queen but you talk like a pawn and I know you're a fool in disguise
Godfather tell me how to carry on
Blinded by fantasies of lies
And I dream what I've seen
Is what I want it to be self made reality
How many miles to the gate of reality
How many steps left to go to my dreams
How many miles to the land where my dreams come true
Dreams which come true just have died
I see your smile a golden masquerade
And I know my dream it will be my fate
Time has stolen my fantasy
'Cause it has become a pale reality
How many miles to the gate of reality
How many steps left to go to my dreams
How many miles to the land where my dreams come true
Dreams which come true just have died <start> I must leave but will not
Fear clutters thought
Without I am alone
Learn from what is known
I see you within a dream
All to dark to be seen
In the past we have talked through friendship
I'm living thought
Why must it happens to us
Our future will be small
But not enough
To make us part is what you sealed inside my heart
It's coming down again
So hard to breath with these blindfolded eyes
I find myself facind reality
You're not alone
I'm still your friend
Stand right behind you until the fucking end. <start> Back all those years
When all just used to be
Those memories in me
Palisades surrounding
Deep in my torn heart
The reality it won't ever start
When a parting kiss is all that will remain
And the feelings of remorse will retain
Needs must when the devil drives
What is done is final
And cannot be undone
When all was on the verge and on the run
The path is preordained
The workers of your fate
But it's your own world you're free to create
And in the next world I am perfectly alright
All the novels I'm creating day and night
Far beyond dark brooding clouds
Chorus
Take me on and on
I am just a starcrossed dreamer
A fancier is all I wanna be
when I return
I'm flying in the face of reason
Now and for crying out loud
A poet I'll be
Cause the flame burns in me
And the dreamline is my mystery
Forever I'll shine
The whole world is mine
A dreamer a fancier am I <start> In the morning I am empty
Of everything I used to be
I will ride away the feeling
So no one will ever read
If I had all of the answers
I could poor salt on my wounds
I could fill this room with sorrow
So no one would ever see
Chorus
I want to wake up and drink from your river
I want to reach out and tear down the sky
To know I'm alive
I want to learn how to feel without bleeding
I want to learn how to live by your side
You're no longer mine.
Wow
We got to swim against the tides of each other
Find the other side of the river and wow
If I offered you a picture
And the paint is yet to dry
Could you live with just a whisper
A flower is meant to die
If I had all of the answers
I could poor salt on my wounds
I could fill this room with sorrow
So no one would ever see
Chorus
And wow we gotta swim against the tides of each other
Find the other side of the river
And wow we gotta swim against the tides of each other
Find the other side of the river. <start> Lost a lion came and said
Come on the brink of the abyss
Watch my feet
swinging in the great empty one
Babel d'escaliers et d'arcades
C'tait un palais infini
No one else is able now to play
with the answers
And I open my mind is so clear
There's a door in the wall of time <start> Instrumental <start> In hunger and in fury
In all of human race
The evils resurrection
In all time and space
Our faith is getting weaker
Our hopes are dead and gone.
Who is here to guide us
To see right from wrong
To be there for the lonely
Be there for the weak
To show us what we're here for
To make our lives complete
I just want to know what's true in order to survive.
Forever in my heart I will believe the hands of time
Though we fear and though we try to make us strong inside
Maybe he'll never I arrive
As long as we don't try
A fiction or a savior
Fate has chosen you
Mankind needs your guidance
Something to believe into
We're born into a mission
To grow and realize
We're here for something greater
Above ignorance and dimes
To be there for the lonely
Be there for the weak
Show them what we're here for
Make our life's complete
I just want to know what's true in order to survive.
Forever in my heart I will believe the hands of time
Though we fear and though we try to make us strong inside
Maybe he'll never I arrive
As long as we don't try
To be there for the lonely
Be there for the weak
Show them what we're here for
Make our life's complete
I just want to know what's true in order to survive.
Forever in my heart I will believe the hands of time
Though we fear and though we try to make us strong inside
Maybe he'll never I arrive as long as we don't try
We will try <start> Along with the art of conquest and domination we have developed the absolute science of ignorance and bound it in text of generations of the unthinking. Between the lines of a one sided history reads the bitter truth of exploitation. The echoes of dehumanization can still be heard in the hills of Wounded Knee or the streets of Bensonhurst. <start> Been haunted be the paws ov fear
And felt his breath upon my neck
I was granted with the pain divine
And my voice was heard no more in heaven
Great in power
Thus call'st me almighty
In not be first archangel
I shall be the last among thee
Come over to seduce your angels
Been born to rape your mother's holy womb
Rebel
So call me now
As I stand above ye all
Leave me unworshipped
In the dens below forever I shall dwell
Malice in heart was bred and lives again
My legions hid in south eden
My flaming passions
Oceans ov love
And all thou call'st
The evil
I summon thee
Bringer ov war
Bearer ov light
Earth's son <start> My love is dead love is dead
My love is dead
I feel a cold breath of wind
Black sky in morning veil
I see no worth living reason oh no
Ooh it's driving me insane pangs of love
Never thought I would feel this way
Ooh I see your face in every cloud
And I say to myself don't let me
Let me fade away
Love is dead
My love is dead
I walk through desert fields
Black ravens surrounding me
I have no more rest for life no more
Ooh I'm bleeding from inside
A once opened heart never thought
I would feel this way ooh I search for any reason or cause
Which I could never find
So I blame myself for things I don't understand
Love is dead
My love is dead
For all the people who believe
Incomprehensible
Incomprehensible
My love is dead
My love is dead
My love is dead
My love is dead
All my life is pain drowned in tears
Never thought I would feel this way
Everyday I die once more my heart turns black
Never again safe and warm
Love is dead
My love is dead
My love is dead
My love is dead
My love is dead
Love is dead
Love is dead
Love is dead
Love is dead
Love is dead
Love is dead
Love is dead
Love is dead
My love is dead
Onec more
Love is dead
Love is dead
Love is dead
Love is dead
Love is dead
Love is dead
Love is dead
Love is dead
Dead dead dead
Dead dead dead
Dead dead dead
Dead dead dead
My love is dead <start> We drive we drive we're riding on through the universe
We've come to reach our destination planet earth
We come we run you cannot see us flying in our spaceships shooting
cross the sky
We explore and we all know what this is about for us all
So many light years we have travelled far from home
Someday we'll be there I know
Shine on rising star
We travelled such a long way
But still you seem so far
Shine on Rising star for our belief in unity at heart
Rising Star
Come on and shine
Living was torture and dying release
A declining world no future no hope
We were passing the point of no return
So many light years still we travel on and on
And someday we will call you home
Shine on Rising Star
Diamond in the distance still you seem so far
Shine on Rising Star
Forever light the darkness in our hearts
Rising Star Rising Star
Salvation
Damnation
We crawl across the sky with pain
Forever we will fly
 Solo Both 
Out in the darkness
There's a never ending light
Still we are far away
But we'll be there one day
Someday we will call you home
Shine on Rising Star
We travelled such a long way but still you seem so far
Shine on Rising Star
Forever light the darkness in our hearts
Rising Star Rising Star
Shadows in the darkness so far away from home
Standing all alone noone there beside me
Shadows all around so far away from home
I know I'm not alone It seems we're lost in space and time
Shine on
Shine on now and warm the tears we've shed through years
It's our prison final reason for the freedom and the glory that we feel
Are you for real 
Shine on Rising Star
Diamond in the distance
Still you seem so far
Shine on Rising Star
Forever light the darkness in our hearts
Rising Star Rising Star
Shine on Rising Star
Come on and shine for us
Shine on shine forever more
Shine on
Our survival
Rising Star the last chance for us all
The only hope for our future and a home
For us all
For us all
Come on and shine Rising Star <start> This hovering shadow I see
It's touch of death surrounds me
No glimmer of hope in a distant sight
Memories of life
On this vision they feed
Leaving this world
The end is complete
Surely the bottom deep
Visions dark as never seen
Looking down on an empty shell
Bones left for the earth to dissolve
We have reached the end my friend
This is the end
Surely the last descend
Those who enter can never leave
As darkness swallows all light
The end is complete
Surely the bottom deep
Visions dark as never seen
Looking down on an empty shell
Bones left for the earth to dissolve
We have reached the end my friend <start> The Dawn arose the slumbers shadows have passed
The autumnal grace which so kindly has cast
It's sombre yet gracious delight on my grief
Enshrouded and lulled by the winters far deeper relief
As weary my days will grow from leisure apart
I shall wait for your powers renewed
I pray to whatever there be
Let be my heard by your tenderness again imbued.
Cura a die renovato cedit
Dolor et laetitia conjungtus est
Delightful shade was all that I dared hope for
Thy silent charm alone remains to adore. <start> The night will fall the axe will drop
The key will turn the door will lock
The needle will push the pain will stop
The scene is set prepare for shock.
Fade to black
Your mind is full of evil thoughts
Your senses dulled as your body rots
You will go down on my command
Your will is gone fall by my hand.
The night will fall the axe will drop
The key will turn the door will lock
The needle will push the pain will stop
The scene is set prepare for shock. <start> Slowly drifting through the tunnel of light
Away from reality and from all it's spite
From the dreadful day to a safe night
Emotion drain
Through the veins
Feel no pain
Floating in the sky free as a bird
Strange calm sounds that no one ever heard
Reaches the mind like comfortable words
Emotion drain
Through the veins
Feel no pain
Insthroughmental  Like a traveller
Insthroughmental  Hypnotised
Inner secrets betray themselves
Closing in on the eternal answer
Exploring the unknown mental galaxy
Beyond the real world and the fatality
It's the end of mess and complexity
Slowly drifting through the tunnel of light
Away from reality and from all it's spite
From the dreadful day to a safe night <start> the wear and tear
has taken a toll here
we are old
we are alone
and we are dead  dead  dead
less is more
more or less i guess
if you're blessed with a second guess
and did you bring a friend
less is more
more or less i guess
if you're blessed with a second guess
and did you bring a friend
to load down on
so load down on <start> Vi slde vra hemman och gav oss sedan ut
Som fgelen bortflyger nr sommaren tar slut.
Han kommer en gng ter nr vren skrider fram
Men vi fr aldrig skda vrt kra fosterland.
Och nr vi sedan kom till den Liverpoolska hamn
Begynte ngerns trar s stritt att bryta fram.
Det blev en hjrtans sveda i brstet p var och en.
Man talar blott om Sverige och om sitt frra hem.
Vi packades tillsammans uti ett osunt kvav.
Det var fr oss att skda liksom en ppen grav.
Och fdan som vi fraktat ifrn vr svenska jord
Den blev oss nu frbjuden att taga med ombord.
Och nr vi hade seglat en vecka eller tv
Ett mrker dcket hljde och bredde sig drp.
Ej se varann vi kunde knappt andas eller g.
Det var en gruvlig plga fr stora och fr sm. <start> Some are born to sweet delight
Some are born to endless night
So pale and lifeless
What you're doing to me
I'm doing to myself
I close the iris to the sun
It once was open soon its gone
Soon it's gone
Soon it's gone
So pale and lifeless
What you're doing to me
I'm doing to myself <start> You dive into sleep
find roses under the door they seem
to speak in trance of youth
remember who you swore to chose girl ...
I am dead dead in love
I am pale pale enough
to be dead death I got
dead in love.
There may be a sky
could be a sign for me to rise
but without blood and energy
I send my brain waves possibly
they find their aim.
Death I got ...
You float into sourness
infected by my bite you crawl
down in my castle where the beasts
lie in my arms and smile so sweet.
I am dead dead in love
I am pale pale enough
to be dead death I got
dead in love. <start> Hate your goddamn motherfucking shitty ass band
Hate the way you've got my back while you're holding out your hand
Hate the way you pussy's talk shit hiding on the web
Just the fact you think you know me makes me fucked up in the head
Hate your nails hate your hair hate the fact I even care
Hate the way you said you loved me but you fucking weren't there
Hate your friends hate your folks hate your stupid fucking hopes
Hate the way I tried to change when the whole thing was a joke
I hate you
That's an understatement
I hate you
For who you are
I hate you
And all you stand for
I don't care
Anymore
I gave you
One hundred chances
You gave me
A hundred ways to hate
Hate your face hate your lies and the blank look in your eyes
Hate your needs hate your wants hate the way you look and talk
Hate your voice makes me cringe every time I hear you speak
It's uncomfortable to know you share the same air as me
Hate your lack of common sense and I'm tired of compromising
Take a good look in the end 'cause it's just on the horizon
I've been wrong about a lot of shit this I know is true
There's a hundred fucking things that I hate about you
I hate you
That's an understatement
I hate you
For who you are
I hate you
And all you stand for
I don't care
Anymore
I gave you
One hundred chances
You gave me
A hundred ways to hate
I hate you
One hundred ways
I don't care
One hundred ways to hate
I gave you
A million chances
You gave me
A hundred ways to hate
A hundred ways
A hundred ways to hate <start> Patricia Lutz aged twenty Baltimore Maryland
Hollywood bound in 
Leaving trashed marriage behind budding happy full of life
The city of sun and sin the journey to hell begins
Robin D Waters impersonator of the homed one
Cloaked in black shaved head ringleader of misguided youths
Community of misfits surrogate family
Drugs and mind games at St. Griffith Park Observatory
He had made his choice Patricia was the one
He took her by her hand and led her down
His private hell caught in his command
Patricia Lutz took death by its cold hand
She would give him a son the child of Satan
She now had shaved her young head clean
His offspring growing for each day
In the womb of Patricia his darkness queen
Angel dusted flashedout wedding
Midnight hour black magic shop
One hundred black candles lit
By his hand the hour glass would stop
Psycho power thought control
At day time waitress down the coffee place
The letters home but millions of riddles
At night time she'd prostitute herself
Acid hell more money craves
The hold up fails the misfits flee
Refuse to be their federate slaves
It's time to fulfill their destiny
St. Griffith Park Observatory
Midnight hour a psychos last stand
The world is for fools and hell is awaiting
A shiny . in a fragile woman's hand
Just one shot it's all so easy
All will be well just aim at the head
Look into the eyes the eyes of each other
Just press that trigger and you're dead
Six years would pass a Sunday came
Sun bleached skulls laid to rest
Patricia
White bones <start> The scars on my arms remind me
How I got this way
I can taste the stain of your sickness on my lips
Of all the stupid things I did
I fell for this
I'll ask again like you never knew
Lie to me
What the Fuck
Just lie to me
Were gonna make it through
I'm well past wanting the truth
Just lie to me
I'll always love you
Lie to my face <start> The sinners masquerade
An asylum for the weak
A feast for the wolf
Our faces lost in the deep
Empty space our souls to keep
The hour of twilight
As silent as sin
Drifting beyond dreaming
Erasing all therein
Into black nightmare
Cry in vain
The eyes set sail
Towards ebony rain
The mirror cease to live
Images all gone
Cutting through our hearts
A slice of ended life
Will our memories stain the knife <start> I now see you through your own eyes
You are more than you realize
I can't explain what you can't see
But you are all that fills me
Countdown counting down for me
All roads are leading to your town
And it's some place I've never been
Countdown counting down for me
Please don't seduce me with your smile
Because I'm only human
Countdown to you
Countdown to you
I try not to but I'm only falling faster
Countdown to you
Not supposed to but i need you here
forever
It's not like this is meant to be
You are so much better than me
I can't explain what's happening
But I'm losing this fight
Feel a way home but you never
Feel <start> All eyes must be on you.
It's a pity you're addicted too.
Now go ahead manipulate them.
Initiating doubt a new dynamic found.
By sharing all your weightless problems.
All on the outside looking in.
Take this moment to see what you've begun.
Display this moment to see what you've become.
Defined by what you sell those lies packaged well.
But you know that we can see right through you.
Attention's wearing thin so type it out again.
I hope this all made you happy.
Forfeit all of your integrity for a temporary high.
Lay it all out for the world to see.
Manufacture one more lie. <start> Not every life ends with death
some banes outlast the endless sleep.
Sometimes the spirit is too strong
sometimes emotions are too deep.
I scorn you past the end of life
and still from the depth of deepest hell
I'll spit forth my hate against you
mighty and irrevocable.
Here I stand upright I'll die.
I won't submit to anyone.
I won't share servility.
I'm called to account by myself or noone.
To bear witness of the truth 
I call my life my agony.
My tears shall hallow my promise
I curse you for eternity.
You cowards you toadies.
Me
I'm God
I'm Satan
I am
you're not worthy of touching my shadow
as long as you follow your hams.
Here I stand upright I'll die.
I won't submit to anyone.
I won't share servility.
I'm called to account by myself or noone <start> Dream awake eyes open wide
Drain the poison kill the lie
Life is now there is no end
Never know what might have been
Chorus
Spirit never fade away
I can never forget that day
Beyond the grave
Spirit never fade
Never fade away
Spirit never fade
Things that you fear the most
Same damn things you hold so close
Try hard as steel till nothing's left
It'll come when you least expect
Chorus
Beyond the grave
Spirit never fade
Never fade away
Spirit never fade
In your mind suspended in time
Different lives different times
Worlds collide memory blinds
Peace is hard to find
Spirit or ghost
Have I lost my mind
Hope is alive
Carry us through time
Dream awake eyes open wide
Drain the poison kill the lie
Life is now there is no end
Never know what might have been
Chorus
Beyond the grave
Spirit never fade
Spirit never fade
Never fade away
Spirit never fade
Never fade away <start> 



...
As I walked on my own
As I look for my dear home
I felt the sun leaving me
White choruses wait for me
Where shall we our breakfast take
Said the first raven
Down in yonder green field
There lies a knight slain under his shield
Down comes his follow doe
As great with young as she might go
She lift up his bloody head
And kissed his wounds that were so red
She got him up on her back
And carried him to earth and lake
She buried him before the prime
She was dead herself before night time
Do you still see me
Do you still see me <start> If I can't be your friend I will be your enemy
Try to destroy me before I destroy you
Try to burn me yeah burn me yeah burn me yo
But be aware my flame can burn you down
It's too late now to hide  Your soul is mine
You know all sins bring forth a brand new sin
Tear my flesh feed my pain drink my blood I don't care
My evil thoughts will haunt you till your last breath
Your scream won't be heard by no one but the inner man
Who slowly addles you and paints your mind red
It's too late now to hide  Your soul is mine and
my revenge needs blood and pain
I release my demons giving you back
All the pain that you caused
It tears me apart but I don't mind
I can't hold them back anymore
I release my demons and separate
right from wrong it's my escape song
I release my demons and eliminate
everything yeah everything
That holds me back
You can't hold me back
This is my final attack
This is my point of no return I got no way back
My poisoned mind's ready to spread disease
I'm down to zero. Disillusioned. This is how I feel
But my collapse will destroy my enemies <start> The opening of graves an awful sight
Watch morbid villains scream out in fright
The sickening dead nothing but rot
Just corpses of late left and forget
Gutwrench
Doom laden victims obey sick demands
Praying to violence devouring the land
A sickening death committing the sin
Of opening their graves again and again
It's Gutwrench
Gut wrench <start> See a raven flying there the great bird of destiny
Coming from an eternal place where silent river flows
It's my to go to the place unknown... Human harvest
Raven's chore to collect all on board
Endless voyage trip to sorrow bleeding tears for unknown tomorrow
I'm living in sin I am no saint the raven is singing my serenade
My soul in one tear my tears on silent river
Silent river in my soul my river flows no more
Black wind blowing my heart black raven draining my soul
Chaining my heart loosing my soul the raven will follow... <start> De nuevo vi caer la sombra de tu ser
de nuevo al observarte vi que no debias temer
al ver tu cuerpo condenado
al ver la vida desde otro lado
yo te recordare como siempre
el muchacho aquel.
Vendiste tu propia vida
vida que andaba vacia
y se que nunca me entere
y ahora si ahi hay alguien
donde estes que te abrace
y seas lo que aqui quisiste ser.
No quiso contar su triste final
el que ellos nunca comprenderan
el salto que llegaste a dar
de la vida a la eternidad
sombras del dolor
amor ciego
y triste pasion.
Vendiste tu propia vida
vida que andaba vacia
y se que nunca me entere
y ahora si ahi hay alguien
donde estes que te abrace
y seas lo que aqui quisiste ser.
...y se que nunca podre entender
amor por tal mujer.
En su interior no quiso escuchar
un sueno le envolvio
los ojos ciegos de un amor
enganaron su corazon
y ahi llego su perdicion... <start> Instrumental <start> A demon in my blood
In a dark crimson urge
Chained down like a dog
The thirst is my curse
Out for blood  Out for blood
We prowl the streets at night
Blood hot  Heart cold
In the shadows we await
To feast upon your soul
Out for blood  Out for blood
We only come out at night
To drain you of your life
Undead horror alive
Pulling the trigger inside
A demon in my blood
In a dark crimson urge
Chained down like a dog
The thirts is my curse
Out of blood  Out for blood
We only come out at night
To dfrain you of your life
Undead horror alive
Pulling the trigger inside
We only come out at night
To dfrain you of your life
Undead horror alive
Pulling the trigger inside
Out for blood  Out for you
I want blood  I want you
Out for blood  Out for you
I want blood  I want you <start> Monday to Sunday gotta play if you could win.
Someday anyway gotta pay for a new begin
I got the cash and the class I got the power to maximise
A little prayer for my saviour you never know when you could win
Put it in Yeah
Put it in put it in fast
Put it in Yeah stake it all out before I lose my...
Aces  numbers they're the key to every game
Jokers  smokers where do they live they have no names
And when I try to escape they track me down again
A little prayer for my saviour you never know when you could win
Put it in put it in fast
Put it in Yeah stake it all out before I lose my grasp
Bees to honey I choose the challenge
Playcards attract the user tell me who's the loser
Did I wake up with it or did I go sleep with it
Maybe God is one and all fiction what I do have is an addiction
Put it in yeah put it in fast
Put it in yeah stake it all out before I lose my grasp
Stranger than strangers I lose my identity
I had it all inside me but I gave it all away
Today is over but tomorrow could be OK
Another prayer for my saviour you never know when you could win
Put it in
You've gotta put it in. <start> Mother of the everdark
Wearing the cloak of shadows
The skin of the unlight
Wedding gown from the stars
In Arda obeying none
Spinning the web of light undone
Singing her silent song
End the world and the sun
Queen of the last days
Rose from the abyss
The vilest creature ever been
On the soil from the Great Song
In Arda obeying none
Whirling the clouds of light undone
Singing her silent song
For the new world of hers to come
Devour of the jewels
Destroyer of the light
Deadly web of the underworld
Growing her endless might
Terror for the one
Master who stands alone
Poison from her veins
To spoil the earth death's embrace
Forever hunger for more
Known world under her net
Assault against the Dark Creator
The power of gods she bears
Mother of the everdark
Wearing the cloak of shadows
The skin of the unlight
Wedding gown from fallen stars
So spoiled by the master thief
Who shall fall in the Northern war <start> Intro
You need drive

You're kicking back no one's home
Feeling sorry grab the phone
You have no friends you realize
You gotta start with some drive

You need drive to survive

Tomorrow is another day
Well tomorrow was yesterday

Drive <start> Last night I dreamt in a fever
My deeds formed a prison of stone
And to me now this golden throne
Seems made of bone
I gazed up at armies in silver
Clashing with beasts from the sky
And I wept with a sigh yet I know
The dragon's son must die
He'll return to me
That I know
I've seen her in my dreams
The old gods
They spoke to me
Slay them all
And we shall set her free
To light up my life
And keep me from harm <start> Relentless  grief is thy name
Innocence and beauty but the song remains the same
Hatred builds pressure I'm scorned by the flame
All our scars we hide inside
To fit the puzzle we must lie
Leave your innocence behind
Deny
Screaming  but there's no one to blame
You're the one attached to all that is insane
Why keep pretending only you can stop this game
All our scars we hide inside
To fit the puzzle we must lie
Leave your innocence behind
We keep falling lust turns to apathy
Where are we going when grey insaturate our need
To serenity <start> Das Vulture Ans Das NutterWain

A family lies bathed in blood

Sadist and evangelist
Perfect plan of deviant bliss
Rapist and antagonist
Sunken deep in his bloody abyss
Haunting all and taunting men

Our deliverer has come.
This is war.
Our history has led us here.
Creation sings in celebration.
This is war.
This mystery's beheld us here.
He is the voice of liberation.
Now is the age of redemption.
Prophesized by generations past a redeemer for captive Israel.
Our Messiah has been sent at last to take the throne and shut the gates of hell.
We fight for justice the war has just begun.
Our king has come now.
Now I see freedom I see it rising up
like that star after sundown.
With a voice that shake the heavens
and with words that calm the seas
there is one the prophets told us
that the nations would receive.
This is what we've been waiting for.
Rise up.
Never again do we fight alone.
The promised one has come to set his people free.
From the ashes came our greatest victory.
This mystery has been revealed to the discerning
The Lamb was slain. The blood was shed. Let death pass over us.
The sacrifice was made for sinners undeserving.
Now we stand set apart to storm the gates of hell.
The fight for justice it has just begun
our king has come now.
Now I see freedom I see it rising up
like that star after sundown.
With a voice that shake the heavens
and with words that calm the seas
there is one the prophets told us
that the nations would receive.
This is what we've been waiting for.
Rise up.
Never again do we fight alone.
Rise up.
We are the resistance.
Rise up.
Now is the time to rise up. <start> Crawling through depression
A shape without a form
A life locked senselessly
A brain that's dead and gone
Waiting on the bottom
The key to your release
The dose fits your dependency
Sliming through your teeth
Incoming
It's up to you
He's talking
And tells you what to do
Ride the worm
Ride the worm
Double blurred vision
Distorted point of view
Shedding inhibitions
Tomorrow's back and blue
Driven by aggression
When the worms is by your side
Leading you to outlive
The things that you'll deny
Infectious
Cause of your kind
Obnoxious
The mirror of your mind
Incoming
It's up to you
He's laughing
and leaves you when you're through
Ride the worm
Ride the worm <start> I welcome death with open arms
Her soft breath and simple charm
Wandering through memories
Takes my hand for me to see
Tried so hard
Tried so hard
Echoes of innocence
All my thoughts into descent
Tried so hard
Tried so hard
Tried so hard
Tried so hard
When we finally reach the end
She lets go of my hand
Walking into realms of light
There will be no death tonight
Tried so hard
Tried so hard
Tried so hard
Tried so hard <start> Like the arrival of the purest from of life
It sets its course to remain just that
If not for the blatant disregard for its purity
It would never uncover the anger
Stormlit Aqua
The crest of the waves reveal a
Sign of friendship with the moon
Embracing each other with the
Tides and currents that flow throughout
The spaces meant for it to be
Reaching to hold onto the liquid rain
The perspiration on a sweating soul tells
The body what is known
The the water reveals the human effort
It tends to exceed its own demand
By taking the world by the hand
Stormlit Aqua
 <start> Shunned from the light
Born into darkness never knowing
Infant enshrined
Spawn of the alter crush mankind
Never will they see you lurking in my shadow
Unbenign the hands of god

 to finally see it
All my life awaiting this I live my life for this moment and now I see myself as part of it all 
My way in life is gone there's nothing to remake 
To finally see it to finally grab it
All my life awaiting this I live my life for this moment and now I see myself as part of it all 
Bring me where I belong where the path now is gone  bring me where I belong where I can turn to life
Bring me where I belong where I can turn to life

All my life awaiting this I live my life for this moment and now I see myself as part of it all 

All my life awaiting this I live my life for this moment and now I see myself as part of it all 

Bring me where I belong where the path now is gone bring me where I belong where I can turn to life
Bring me where I belong where I can turn to life <start> Under the vault of heavens
I stood alone waiting
The blaze of silver shining in my eyes
My hands of gleaming gold
The red of iron in my veins
The blue of steel in my bones
The sparkle of blackness of coal in my hair
My chest golden with waved
It is my heaven
It has my eyes
It is my space
It has my shape
I knew it was my masterwork
I felt the strength of gods
Revised the soaring heights
Let the heavens be aligned
I listened with care the place for the moon
Made sure of the tones
Painted through void the route for the sun
Made out the locus of stars
I pierced the distant dome
For the lights to seep through
I checked the curves of borders of all
And placed the highest star
It worked and sun and danced
It shone and gloved and gleaned
It circled curved and blazed
It pulsed burned and waned
It flowed from my bones
And bolted from my fingers
And settled on and over me
And made me face my longing <start> You know deep inside me are all out of pain
We're condemning torturing killing again and again
Waiting for deliverance being nailed to the cross
Hanging there like Jesus Christ
But without his graceful sight
Suspected animation antagonized to die
Make your last confession within tonight
Deads I win
Tails you loose
Blackest sin
Trial by ordeal
Foreed smile frozen face annoyed arch enemy
No weakness no fraility even without empathy
Your mind is closed disturbing fortitude
Hatred fear
Melt into a mental beast
Forced to fight
Steel annealed
Prepare to strike
Trial by ordeal
Demolishing anger concentrated violence
Attempt conquest
No mental anguish warrant of distress
Unfailing strength unflagging opponents
At blood hit the inner conflict
Trial by ordeal decides your life or death
Pouring out the vails of wrath and damnation
Taking a delight in an unholy domain
Blasphemous unholy
Benedicted under God's name <start> Rise upHysteria
You have to ask yourself are you ready for this
Is the faith in yourself or in somebody else
Rise upHysteria
Can you rush faster than the juice in the vein
Can you stop a bullet when the gun is at your head
Why don't you ask me  I will tell you
Why don't you follow me  I will show you
Would you steal my money just to crack your pain
Would you pull the trigger even though you're dead
All that you dreamed is over  forget the love you sold her
Rise up  Hysteria
You disgrace me and you abuse me
Why don't you leave me  I can't help you
Because I'm tired nothing left
I feel old not a cent
I want out  had enough
I want out  had enough
Rise up  Hysteria
You have to ask yourself are you ready for this
Is the faith in yourself or in somebody else
You have to ask yourself are you ready for this
Is the faith in yourself or in somebody else
Rise up  Hysteria <start> Landscapes of frozen methane
Vast fields of blue dust before my eyes
I was sent here to describe and tease
The minds of the fantasy kings 
On a ship of curiosity I sail
 what treasure can be found here
And why must eyes face this
Unearthly show of morbid climate
Behind the Neptune hillsides
They say the towers stand tall
Built by hands dissimilar to mine
And Brought alive
By hearts of ancient alien cultures <start> Creation imperfect
Do you defy this
Could you and your swollen ego fit
Into my master plan for failure
I take the shame to heart and lock it away
In a place that sees not the light of day
I will use it when I see your face again
Your head in your hands and this is my cue
If three words could heal you I would only speak two
Your eyelids grow heavy and this is my cue
If three words could heal you I'd only speak two
How could you think and after all you put me through
And all you put on my shoulders that I would answer your cries for help
How could you think and after all you put me through
And all you put on my shoulders that I would answer your cry for help
Unleash the rage built up
Show you how you hurt me and hopefully you see
You have the power to destroy
My will to live <start> 
Stoned I awoke in your temple
To blackness above you
And death beside me
 kitchen knives conspire
Razor blades make bloodless love

The ghost of a pale girl
is solemnly following me
Pale will she follow me
into the sea
I feel the flowers screaming
To consume you

Earth and sky your cradle
Earth and sky entomb you
and death beside me
I burrow through the dust
In your skull
But I cannot seem to find your soul
Bloodless and numb
We orbit the sun
Hungry will this pale thing
Follow me into the sea
On the cold side of her face
The reptiles awake
Locust swarm from open mouths
That sing thy kingdom come
While blackness hums
Nothing is true
and I'm tired of your sad today
your screaming because
There's nothing left for you to say
Bloodless and numb
we orbit the sun
Hungry will this pale thing
Follow me into the sea
Stoned I awoke in your temple
To blackness above you
and death beside me
 kitchen knives conspire
Razor blades make bloodless love
 <start> No there are no easy answers
To sum up the problems which we face
History's a lesson let us learn by our mistakes
Just don't expect to make sense
Out of what you see
For I can tell you now that
Knowing is believing
So if you open your mind you might understand
You're the victim of a bigtime government scam
And though you may not be inclined to believe
The man behind the desk does get paid to deceive
You live in your little dream world
You're much too cool to care
I really have to warn you
I think it's only fair
They await the final hour
As happy as they are sick
Laughing so hysterically
At all those who they've tricked
But then who an I to tell you who to believe in
When all the masks they seem so damn deceiving
How can I say to you You be Free
That would never bring about mass anarchy
Now would it <start> Yeah I yes..I I love you
I know I hurt you so
I'm empty and cold
black shone like gold that night
so I lost myself again <start> Jen you're stuck into my world now
And you're one of god's most precious pearls now
And your blue eyes show a new dimension
That this world has got a new extension
You came to me in days of sadness
There is no young there is no old
You took me into your world of madness
Now twice I don't have to be told
Jen honestly I say I love you
Hair that has the colour of chestnut that
presence I admire you
Happy is your world wide religion
You can't hurt nobody at least with no intention
We are just smiling at each other
Honey you must be from above
And those in sadness we will bother
We sold our souls for love
To everybody
And when you meet her
Then say hello for me
The sweetest child of mine <start> Sitting upon the shore
The waves crash and echo inside my head
Approaching out in the distance
A ship of slaves to bury the dead
This island is a pirson
Of futile desparation
From hunger and calamity
I slip into dreams
The years became mummified
A relic of suicide
The years became mummified
Waiting for what may wash up in the tide
Under the moon out in the sea
What could be out there waiting for me
I swirl the current it pulls me under
I feel the water filling my lungs
The years became mummified
A relic of suicide
The years became mummified
Waiting for what may wash up in the tide
What may wash up in the tide
What may wash up in the tide
What may wash up in the tide
Shades below pluto
Floating in limbo
Orcus and father of phlegethon
The fury and fire
Anointing the worms
Writhing in semen and blood
Visions of heavenly celestial beings in love
Illusion crucified a witness below so above
Lost are the souls that wade in a molten sea
Beg for forgiveness from a supreme deity
The years became mummified
A relic of suicide
The years became mummified
Waiting for what may wash up in the tide
What may wash up in the tide
What may wash up in the tide
What may wash up in the tide
I'm lost though hopeful I'll find a way
I'm lost though hopeful I'll find a way
I'm lost though hopeful I'll find a way
I'm lost though hopeful I'll find a way <start> I'll give you a world I've painted red I'll take you soul apart
I'll cover you with curdled blood I'll show you what's my art
I'll stick a nail right in your tongue I'll poke and chew your eyes
I'll main your body live on stage with my cruel device
In the Grand Guignol
I'll grant blood thrill for all
Violence is my theatre play that shows again 'n' again
Starring freaks and headless corps enough to drive you insane
Creepy crawling and slimy things alla aboard the horror's train
With naked dancers and snarling beasts we'll play the play that's pain
In the Grand Guignol
I'll grant blood thrill for all
So come along for tonight's ride your tremble laugh and pray
All excess are included in the price you'll pay
In the Grand Guignol
I'll grant blood and thrill for all <start> M Thomas Eriksson <start> A captive soul returns
Limited to materialistic boundaries
Repeating the process of learning
As previous knowledge dissolved long ago
Bewildered by totems in nature
We quest universe reflection
But when mind potentialities exhaust
The answers remain untapped
Homosapiens terrorize one another
Conforming like drones
Homosapiens molesters of nature
Homosapiens parasites of the earth
Concepts of existence astonish
Reality resides within myself
Significance is questionable <start> This is a rebirth 
Sharp teeth introduced in me
My red life's drunk energizer 
From vampirism to revelation
My lifetime resumed in a second...
May...seconds be hours 
May...my flight be higher 
Death's like a bside of life
Obscurity is the nowname of light
Enjoying this mutation
Orgasmic feeling for a loss of reason...
May...seconds be hours 
May...my flight be higher 
My body's cold so is my sight
Quiet dead but still breathing
Nothing's changed but everything
From condolences to rebirth
May...seconds be hours 
May...my flight be higher 
I stepped down to the deepest to really know where I was at
Couldn't know how tasty death is but I knew how false life was ...
Can't you feel that shit that makes you live it's there to serve something futile  <start> Blazing to their pikes
Turning to dust
Gusting with the wind
They  dream of an older delusion
Reigning raining
Dampening the empire
Their excursion burns with the ashes
Calm lakes mirrored
Glistening everywhere
They rove through the waters and fires
Silent seas paused
Enlightening low light
Their visions for imperishability
The weakened flesh
Expecting downfall
Their ashes spread through lightless starless skies
The Eminence
Not expecting wind
They  think of a newer illusion
Chorus
PRAISE  The ancient times
AS EARTH  Equates their end
COMMAND  The ancient times
LIKE TARA  Shall never pretend
DIES  Irae dies illa
QUIDQUID  Latet adparebit
NIL  Inultum remanebit
DEPOSE  Towards ancient times
Repeat Chorus
Repeat All Verses In Reversed Order Excluding The First  Last <start> Everything comes to an end.
Castrate my tool store it safely in a jewel case and throw away the key.
Separation has tainted my comely sunny skies.
Regret flows out of these open wounds.
Rain on my parade.
My confidence is soaked.
Laughter has now lost all of its sincerity.
Emptiness persists.
I've never felt this much anger.
A silent nemesis grins.
I've never felt this much anguish.
A pledge to inflict it tenfold.
Shed these butterfly wings.
Regain your larval state.
Converge with every other insect.
Your lips are sown with rusted barbwire.
Swim in guilt to regain my trust.
Stabbed in the back by a bitter secret.
A portrait painted black.
Shed these butterfly wings.
Regain your larval state.
My heart is abandoned on a silver plate.
Her silence is as cold as a lifeless teenage corpse.
Her delicate beauty has lost all of its purity.
Her pale white skin marked by the foul sent of treachery.
Castrate my tool store it safely in a jewel case and throw away the key.
Separation has tainted my comely sunny skies.
I'll remember this day. <start> He's the leader of the land
He just fronts the Manson clan
Power over all death and sin
Storm the ill
He just does this
Can't you see
Leads the weak in my affairs
Twist the army
Spread the fear
Races colors different creeds
Leeches on to whom be needs
All shall parish burn in flames
Storm the ill
Chorus

And none of us say anything but we both think he's wrong
You say we can't choose the path of life we walk upon
I say I already know which path I'm walking on
Simon says to both of us we're not allowed to move
And none of us say anything but we both disapprove
Simon says

You say we can't change the world if it can't change itself
I say I can't change the world before I change myself

Comes a rider for the damned
And he wields the scythe
As he rides across the land
But when he comes you'll never know
That it's time for you to leave the world
Mother Angel tell me why
Is it cool up in the sky
Was it time for you to disappear and go
Is there something I should know
Was it time for you to go
Waiting for a sign
From you to let me know
Here on my own
From the ashes we do come
To the ashes we shall go
And the dust that we were made of
Shall embrace our very soul
All the times that we don't know
Make it harder to believe in God and heaven above
So Mother Angel tell me why
Is it cool up in the sky
Was it time for you to leave and let it go
Is there something I should know
Was it time for you to go
Waiting for a sign
From you to let me know
Here on my own
My hands reach out into thin air
And the truth is hard to bear
No one comes to bring you back again
Mother Ange tell me why
Is it cool up in the sky
Was it time for you to disappear and go
Is there something I should know
Is it time to let you
Waiting for a sign
From you to let me know
I'm here on my own
Here on my own
Here on my own <start> So I live in this city live with this shame
Live with this hate which is growing insane
So I live in this city live with this pain
Live with this hate which is growing insane

Obstruction in your cerebellum
Although that
your mind is strong
Theres a way to succumb
To the blindness
Of your
will
Of your soul that has lost any content and patterns
What the fuck is

What the fuck means Blind
Gave in to this mistake
Sever the
minds eye
To the blindness i've craved
Blind hate and hypocrisy

body is not yet collapsed
Enthrall the havoc
In the name of your demise
the
demise that has siezed your goddamn existance
What the fuck is wrong

What the fuck means Blind
Gave in to these obscene
Actions you have
sought
Dysfunction arise
Within your eyes
Revise
Step down from self
negligence
Disfunction arise
Within your eyes
Unwise
Step down from self
negligence
This generation have grown to be scum
Scum that threat our
fucking existance
Do you think the fact you lost your sight
Makes all
those things go away
Well your wrong they're there.
Disfunction

Within your eyes
Unwise
Step down from self negligence <start> What did you give
Give to the man
Mind that can only fell'n'suffer
Heart made with
With daub smiles
Meaningless words
And bottomless torment.
What did you give to the man
when he with bowed head
With storm of feelings'n'passions
Dives in the whirl of existence.
Is it not to much
Can we stand that whatt a grace is
On the rough wave
Of the seeming might
Full of the pride
Cruel words as the weapon.
When one blow
One blow changes
mighty'n'rapid river
In the slime of the swamp.
When the end of
Dream 'bout life
Is so fast
Fast like cu of knife.
When hedies like an animal
With hate'n'fear in his eyes
He'll tear you heart out if
That will give him his life back. <start> Prometieron construir

In an overthrow of women light
Slid in to rob the prayers
She whispered to the air with thin deliberation
Spare me from the wolves
Clawing past my door
Tear me from the ghouls
That start to gnaw my fingers
Following her heart
And every beat that spoke
I kissed her risen naked
Soft white throat
Soft white throat
Incense lit at perfection's feet
Has never burnt so sickly sweet
As the fragrance of her breath
When her lips met death with such imagination
Bear me to the moon
The dour toll of bells
Scare me with their boon
Of winters bitter graveyards
Swallowing her fear
I veered beneath her coat
Of soft white meat on
Soft white throat
Crepuscular the lust in her
Went supernova
Setting maps aflame
Before her veins ran colder
And muscular the final thrust
In her spilled over
Covering her back
I saw an angel lift her
Coma
I fell to eyes
Of a bestial past that once
Teaching grief through jaded pupils
Now shone like celestial glass in hell
In hell
And doused in the glow from her parting gift
Never there lay with curves like snowdrifts
A beauty so frozen in bliss
Slumped to warm the dead to a standing ovation
Spare me from the wolves
Clawing past my door
Tear me from the ghouls
That start to gnaw my fingers
Following her heart
And every beat that spoke
I kissed her risen naked
Soft white throat
Soft white throat
Crepuscular the lust in her
Went supernova
Setting maps aflame
Before her veins ran colder
And muscular the final thrust
In her spilled over
Smothering her cracks
I was the devil on her shoulder
Dear Lord I cry before I die
Grant me the taste of love
One final time lest I should hide
When seraph call me from above
And should remorse not stay my course
From debt addresses wept
Will ask no more of you my Lord
Save that my soul in hell is kept <start> ...Kun veri peitt maan aseet kohti vihollista nostetaan ja isnmaata puolustetaan

Wherever you are taking me
Whatever you've arranged for me
I don't want your goodness for free
I wanna earn what i want
I will fight again
I will fail again
I will regret
I will forget
You surely know my name
Determination
Don't give in to deceleration
Don't ever lose your motivation
And perish in the aftershocks
Of dead predictions
I will fight again
I will fail again
I will regret
I will forget
You surely know my name
This is a war
The hunt is on
I am caught between
The devil and the deep blue sea
It's a battle of eternal grief
Abandon hope all ye who enter here
All you'll find is loss and fear
You're cold as stone
You're called
Agony
You really live up to your name
Your evil eyes watching me
Give me a moment of clarity
To end this fields of war
I will fight again
I will fail again
I will regret
I will forget
You surely know my name
This is a war
The hunt is on
I am caught between
The devil and the deep blue sea
It's a battle of eternal grief
Abandon hope all ye who enter here
All you'll find is loss and fear
Now welcome the battle with open arms
It's do or die
This is a war
The hunt is on
So everything is alright again
Between the devil and the deep blue sea
It's a battle of eternal grief
Abandon hope all ye who enter here
All you'll find is loss and fear
All you'll find is loss and fear <start> I lived all these years lost in a hallow shell
Darkness clouds the corners of my mind
Will I ever see the truth
Will he ever reveal himself
Will I be gone forever
Will I disappear
Mirrors all around
Destroy me reflections move
Through the darkness
Yet I still stand in fear and suffering
Fear is the only end
I lived <start> John Doe the answer to my prayers
Won't you come alive in
the picture that I painted
Moon and stars won't
you come to my rescue
Let me enslave you owning
you will make me whole
Green leaves won't you
gather around me
Keep me company
and I'll never beg again
Choose your revolution...
Without arms
We've got a war to fight
Can't you see <start> It's  mouth tastes like the corpse of every pregnant teen
The minutes are hours the hours are days
I feel infected by your presence you speak in tongues
I smell the lies dancing on your blackened lungs
I whispered in her ear
Fear me dear for I am Death
I'll take your hope your dreams your love
Till there's nothing left
I whispered in her ear
You better fear me dear for I am Death
I'll take that shit you call a life in a single fucking breath.
I'll take your hope
I'll take your fucking dreams
I'll take your love
I'll take everything you fucking...
BITCH
I'll steal the diamonds
From your eyes
I'll turn your promises
Into lies
I'll steal the diamonds
From your eyes
I'll turn your promises
Into lies.
It's  mouth tastes like the corpse of every pregnant teen
The hours are days the days are dead
I feel infected by your presence you speak in tongues
I smell the lies dancing on your blackened lungs
I hear the fear in your voice
But you shouldn't feel a thing
Your life's already worse than any pain that I could bring
That I could bring
That I could bring
I could make it December every day
But you're so blind it may as well be May
And I whispered in her ear
You better fear me dear for this is Death
And I whispered in her ear
Fear me 'cause I am Death
One more time
I whispered in her ear
Fear me dear for I am Death
I'll take everything you ever loved
I whispered in her ear
You better fear me for I am Death.
For I am Death.
For I am Death
Bitch <start> You ran for your life from the fireball
While death rained down and the skies did fall
Cities wrapped in a fiery shroud
And the land beneath a mushroom cloud
How can you live you twisted thing
Once the great uranium king
What life now in your nuclear bog
You're a twisted wreck a strontium dog
Before your fall a number one guy
But even then you blackened the sky
Polluted rivers and poisoned the rest
Dear mother earth was this incest
Writhe on your back and look at the sky
What do you see with your mutant eye
The skies are black when they should be blue
Who pushed the button you now it was you
Can you cry and will you weep
For the millions now in endless sleep
Dreams of a race immersed in fire
Your final result a nuclear pyre <start> Don't explain to me your philosophy
Cause when you're cut you bleed the same as I do
Understand there is no understanding
Where I've been is who I am
Pain is real
Pain does not heal
Pain is what they make you feel
Do you feel it
Go  Can you stop it
No  Can you take it
Go  Don't need no reason
No  Do you feel it
Go  Can you stop it
No  Don't need no reason
Now
Son of a bitch lying there
Knife in his back
Out of my face
The cause <start> Sun's warming light
Gives way to branches
Gilded in crimson and gold
A subtle chill
As shadows grow long
Autumn arrives
On wind in trees
Rust and firelight
Weave tapestries
Last glimpse of life
As color gives way
To impending gray
The pale approach
Of bitter fucking cold
Winter arrives
On frozen leaves
Frost and candlelight
Autumn's reprieve <start> CCut off my wings and come lock me up
Just pull the plug yeah I've had enough
Tear me to pieces sell me for parts
You're all vampires so here
You can have my heart
You can have my heart
You can have my heart
You can have my heart
The walls are a funeral I run with ghosts
No hint of movement no sign of pulse
Only an echo just skin and bone
Then kick the chair but we we help tie the rope
You can have my heart
You can have my heart
You can have my heart
So come rain on my parade
'Cause I want to feel it
Come shove me over the edge
'Cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry but it's too late
And it's not worth saving
So come rain on my parade
I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed
And there is no way back
You must of made some kind of mistake
I asked for death but instead I'm awake
The devil told me no room for cheats
I thought I sold my soul but he kept the receipt
So leave the lights on I'm coming home
It's getting darker but I carry on
The sun won't shine here it never did
And when it rains it fucking pours
But I think I like it
And you know that I'm love with the pain
I think I like it
So come rain on my parade
'Cause I want to feel it
Come shove me over the edge
'Cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry but it's too late
And it's not worth saving
So come rain on my parade
I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed
And there is no way back
I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed
And there is no way back
So come rain on my parade
'Cause I want to feel it
Come show me over the edge
'Cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry but it's too late
And it's not worth saving
So come rain on my parade
I think we're doomed

Chorus x  <start> Waste the endless days
pondering on how to get away
you're a mask nothing real
just a piece in a spinning wheel
when you're almost there
it steals your thoughts
disturbance surrounds you
then it's gone
in the shades in the weakest of moments
deep in your doubts full of agony
don't forget that we're fuel for the engine
and you're nothing but a spoke in the wheel
the same awakening
strikes your mind every time
it's a shame all this suffering
like you thought you had a life
are you closing in
you forgot one thing
that it's a dead end street
where all the dreamers meet
in the shades in the weakest of moments
deep in your doubts full of agony
don't forget that we're fuel for the engine
and you're nothing but a spoke in the wheel <start> Talking to yourself
You say things
No one ever hears
Knowing yourself better
Than anyone ever could
Bet you never thought you would
Honesty prevails in thought
You just can't lie to yourself
A patch of lucid decisions
A thought of fame and wealth
Chorus
A caravan or process if you will
A stream of conscious waves
A prostitute of ideas
A maze of tracing knowledge
First and foremost feed your head 
Retrieve all that flows with memory
Obtain all you know with sensories
Approaching every act with contemplation
Attacking everyvision with indecision
Conditioning is a routine of minds
Recruiting all the intellect it finds
Insecurity is merely your fear
Of maybe the outside hearing what you hear
Can't let 'em see
Don't let 'em hear
Projecting like an airplane in flight
I dream of things
That just aren't quite right
A projector shines on the back of my eyes
So my position of perception can rise
Chorus
Insecurity is merely your fear
Of maybe the outside
Hearing what you hear
Don't let 'em see
Can't let 'em hear <start> I felt the moon today
Everything is drawn away
Water splashes on my skin it makes me dry
It makes no sense at all
Why didn't I get a call
When the whole world knew but me
There was nothing left to see
Everything reminds me
Of something from my past
Everything I know is in the past
And everything I see is now
Friends are friends until the end
How soon will it end today
Friends are friends close by
How soon they're gone away
An old man tries to run me off
As he stops to wheeze and cough
I seize the fruit
And steal his day away
Everything reminds me
Of something from my past
Everything I know is in the past
And everything I see is now
Everything I know is in the past
And everything I see is now
Everything I know is in the past
And everything I see is now
Everything I know is in the past
And everything I see is now
I saw the moon today
Everything just melts away
The sun beats upon my skin it makes me sweat
It makes no sense at all
Why didn't I hear the call
When the whole world saw but me
There was no where left to be
Everything reminds me
Of something from my past
Everything I know is in the past
And everything I see is now
Everything I know is in the past
And everything I see is now
Everything I know is in the past
And everything I see is now
Everything I know is in the past
And everything I see is now
Everything I know is in the past
And everything I see is now
Everything I see is
Everything I see is
Everything I see is now <start> From blooddrenched earth
The mighty oak arises
From its roots
Flow rivers of death
Shadowed bodiless forms
The rotting cores of the damned
Drifting  howling to blackened skies
On rushing waters of time
Enter the misty depths
Of the underworld
Where blizzards rage
Through fiery storm
Where magic reigns
The waking dawn
Where ram and serpent
Stand guard
Waiting to taunt the souls
Of those who spent lifetimes
Worshipping lies of a false truth
In vain  they sought return
Protesting their fate
They knew not
The course of the wind
Through which region it roared
On which place it died <start> The once lillywhite collar
Stained with sodomized blood
Molested children. Image of Purity
Soiled. Still blinded by their inbred
Faith they pay you rape their young <start> 
Stay awake because theres no sleep when everythings at stake.
Today we pray we pray for better things better things these days.
And if you will be alright then I could be alive then

You would have a star under your bed.
And I would have the lonely nights instead.
Of all the wishes I put in your hands.
Youd have a star for who you are and itd keep you safe and fed. Now.

Its natural but its hard to let it go.
When were doing things for love and not for show.
Our hands they held the deepest part of the soul.
But theyre reaching now for something else to hold.
And if you will be alright then I could be alive and

You would have a star under your bed.
And I would have the lonely nights instead.
Of all the wishes I put in your hands.
Youd have a star for who you are and itd keep you safe and fed. Now.

Would you keep me locked in
Could you keep me alive then
Would you need me if I said
There are better things this life will bring better things for you.

You would have a star under your bed.
And I would have the lonely nights instead.
Of all the wishes I put in your hands.
Youd have a star for who you are and itd keep you keep you yeah.

You would have a star under your bed.
And I would have the lonely nights instead.
Of all the wishes I put in your hands.
Youd have a star for who you are and itd keep you safe and fed. Now.

And if you will be alright then I will be just fine.
And you will stay alive then maybe Ill survive. <start> TORMENTOR cover

The dead girls are courting her

their frosted bodies buried alive
Oh how I love to feel your breath
I lust to be the lover of Death
desires become truths
evil prayers are heard
by Elisabet Bathory
The countess of my fire
You 're also her sacrifice
you will give your blood
Because she must have a bath
welcome my youth a life before...
more complete then ever... by blood
Oh yes by the blood i was encored
Oh I feel the magic...I fly towards the moon..
Countess it is your night
you haunted by your wild desires
posessed by bestial lust
you are the godess of the love
Oh how I love... REPEAT
Her mind is insatiable
she craves virgins blood evermore
Her flames will never die...
surrounded by infernal glory
Oh how I love....REPEAT <start> My approach to danger

Want wars of race to make space
The confrontation is global
Then it's apartheid became the suicide bicoastal
So much drama and stress inside the world for real
Got God looking through his bifocals
I'm ready to die give me the word
I'm ready to shoot
I'm ready to kill my enemies and put 'em in a body bag
While I'm looking at the President and burning the flag
What
Go against the grain break the chains
Get out escape from the killing fields
With the power to form storms
I'm gonna hit 'em with rage and keep on
Go against the grain break the chains
Get out escape from the killing fields
With the power to form storms
I'm gonna hit 'em with rage and keep on
You in a dominion of Holy War
Tension keep the Jews and Palestinians hard core
This is Biblical conspiracy
Written in religion to keep the world in division
Listen in the streets they collide turn rivers to blood
And peace treaties to napalm theories
Governmental to presidential they lie
America still high the killers they multiply
This is final defcon of the Omega
Denominations gang bang for their savior
The wicked supersede the lost system
With diplomatic immunity to murder your community
I'm ready to die give me the word
I'm ready to shoot
I'm ready to kill my enemies and put 'em in a body bag
While I'm looking at the President and burning the flag

To break the sound of tears
Life's fading
To keep the world away
Is not enough to ease the pain
Time is passing by
Time is passing by i see it in your eyes
Fire burns inside
A light that's caught between
Night and day
Sun's been set to die
Hit supernova in your mind
Time is passing by
I see it in your eyes 
Time is passing by
I see it in these eyes
They tell me all
You can't deny
It's in your eyes
Visions disappear
Memories of a dream
Surrender
Give them to the wind
Deny your sorrow live again
Time is passing by
I see it in your eyes 
Time is passing by
I see it in these eyes
They tell me all
Time is passing by
I see it in your eyes 
Time is passing by
I see it in these eyes
I see it in your eyes
You tell me all
You can't deny
You know you tell me lies <start> When icy snow falls cold ground
My naked soul flees from me.
And I give my crown to you
These are my farewells
holy in the name of my spirit

Erotic Rhapsody away take her away <start> Instrumental <start> With every song on this CD
You will feel more and more compelled
To lose faith in yourself
And in everything around you <start> We're hated
We're bleeding
We're loving
You're losing
Our lives are all about to change
There go the lights to the world I've made in my head now.
I'll make the stand.
I'll scratch out my eyes.
I won't stop til you are dead.
I hope that and pray that one day you will realize.
You were always my biggest inspiration.
The pain you've caused has built who I've become.
Now we might as well be strangers.
Won't be a corpse so you can drag your dead.
I've been blessed by the fires.
By the fires of your hell.
We're hated
We're bleeding
We're loving
You're losing <start> sometimes our fingers speak louder than words  I can see right through the back of your head. clearly. if its right or its wrong if this is wrong. I can't be right. dear god I think they're right how long before this dies we'll count the numbers we'll just forget. we've learned to fail. we've embraced regret. that's not an honest answer and we don't wish it was.  sharpened sticks passing hands aimed at hearts passing through. straight through my heart pass my way. sometimes our fingers speak louder than words. sometimes these wires pass right through the nerves if my heart swelled from my chest would you feed it glass or another kiss we'll go on for days for months for years forever. you'll break my heart. if we count on each other over someone else's shoulder. the way we do when people become numbers am I a one a two a three four five or six seven or an eight <start> Will I went on a date last week.
Sean How'd it go
Will It was good.
Sean Going out again
Will I don't know.
Sean Why not
Will Haven't called her.
Sean Christ you're an ametuer.
Will I know what I'm doing. Don't worry about me I know what I'm doing.
Yeah but this girl's like you know beautiful. She's smart. She's fun. She's different from most of the girls I've been with.
Sean So call her up Romeo.
Will Why So I can realize that she's not that smart that she's fucking boring. This girl's like fucking perfect right now. I don't want to ruin that.
Sean Maybe you're perfect right now. Maybe you don't want to ruin that. But I think that's a super philosophy Will. That way you can go through your entire life without ever having to really know anybody.
You're not perfect sport. And let me save you the suspense this girl you met she's isn't perfect either. But the question is whether or not you're perfect for each other. That's the whole deal.
Sean That's what intimacy is all about. Now you can know everything in the world sport but the only way you're finding that one out is by giving it a shot. <start> My memories clear as ever of a little boy
I can see myself so full of wander a child so full of joy
In a field oh way up yonder not so far from home
lived a sweet old man called Mr.Wonder because of dreams he told
He once so philosophically explained
there's a reason we're brought into this world
I wish he was with us today pray hear me say I understand now
No matter how how hard we try we never listen when destiny's calling
we still keep changing our lives stop look and listen
it's destiny calling you 
Looking back remissing changes long gone by
opportunities I keep on missing I've stared 'em in the eye
The gravity of all my actions I try hard to disguise
it became crystal clear we change the future affecting all our lives
An old man philosophically explained
there's a reason we're brought into this world
Funny those words that he said will always be true forever and ever
Each promise we break the choice is yours and mine
each wrong move that we make we're missing chances
each step with each day will get harder harder if we go our own way <start> when my grandfather was dying he rejected a heart tranplant.

Slaves of hate
No light in the darkness no aim without hope
Defeated by the game of violence.

Systems work continuously but nobody knows

I'm waiting for flying it into pieces. <start> Painis deserved

Awayfor the last time And there
For there's one thing you've

searching for something And it starts
to seem like it's a lie The more you run
the less your chances Are you
scared to quit Scared to die
Because it's all my life 
NO Shame you're feeling
what Remains forever Soon you start to lose your sense of Control As its fading
As the choices made reveal
Away like old time
As you sense that it is slipping
within these walls
Now it all comes back to haunt you

Now I'm afraid to be ALONE
Scared to be ALONE
You want and need to be ALONE
Now as you strive to be ALONE
But that goes away
Within these walls I spend
Within these walls I spend

Still that empty feeling won't go away go away
Your puzzle's missing one very essential piece
And I know you'll keep looking in all the wrong places
Until it's too late until it's too late
Slip on the ice again when did you become so cold
Living for the here and now never made so much so much sense
Slip on the ice again when did you become so cold
You've got all the time in the world
But this could all be ending now
How far down will you go before it's too late
Slipping on the ice again you've become so cold
Lucky for you rock bottom is in sight

Your wake up call is set for now
And the trail you have followed

I have never wasted my time. Maybe that's why
one night I felt as if I had been born again. With no
rhyme or reason I began to laugh and behave like a
happy child expecting a beautiful gift. I could not
recognize myself the whole change was so sudden so
quick... And on that unforgettable night I saw death's
face and nothing has ever since been the same. It was
shortly after that close encounter with the grim reaper

to the eclipse of my mind
each breath's a torture I'm sinking
into bittersweet oblivion.
Giants we were inaccessible
out of the reach of gods and demons
heroes we were in shining armour
full of confidence and belief.
And while the red stones cry I fall
into a world of grey.
Into the stiffened silence I call
for me for you for us.
And while the tide is low I try
to get to the other side.
You left me behind I'm crying
while the flood is drowning me.
Majesties we were full of glory
in a crystal solitude
martyrs we were bleeding as one
you for long me forever.
And while the red stones cry I fall

Into the stiffened silence I call
for me for you for us. <start> Wars in the night
Fear in my eyes

I will feel free again

Born in the dark
Fighting with us
There is no reason to let you down
Come with us now
It's cold at dawn
There is no reason
Born in the dark
Power in my hands
Fear in my veins
And calling my brothers right now
Fighting with corpses
There is no return
And moving mountains with faith
I can see the light on me
I can see my destiny
When the fire runs with me
I will feel free again

But I'm still the same deeper down
Under the surface nothing has changed
You can still recognize me

into the thing that bit me
It has scarred my skin

I may seem different
but I am the same
I may seem strange to you
But I know who I am
I am still the same
They tried but failed to strangle my soul
I am not drowning

Calling the souls of a thousand cemeteries.
Bring winds from beyond iced lands.
Guardians of darkness make raging storms in the skies
to carry the screams of victims beiging sacrificed
whose blood flows endlessly into many lakes and seas.
Behind the haunted walls of the purgatory
the innocent gods became my slaves to serve...
..Me and the master on his throne
They call upon the immortal
legions to burn the holy gates of heaven.
Messenger of hate you're the barrier against daylight.
together with the demon's legions
we are ready to launch an attack.
Against the golden walls of paradise to conquer this earth
The Beast
My throne will rise from the bloody seas
surrounded by a thousand impaled angels...
By Lucifers flames bastard Christ is already consumed
with a thousand holy souls deep in Hydra's throat
Open the gates to purgatory
to throw their souls into the abyss of grief
while Christ fuckin' you with so many lies.
SATAN purified your soul in pain.
White souls are falling endlessly one by one.
The throne of doom stands in the centre of frightened cohorts.
Crying their bastards defeat.

We are gathered around a throne of human skulls.

My voice will take me to the sky
Break out <start> The icy winter is getting near
Dark skies above us
Biting frost is in the air
Darkness surrounds us
The cold piercing autumn breeze
Fills the long ships sail
Soon the lakes and seas will freeze
And snow will lay its veil
Many years we have been away
Many oceans we have roamed
Now the North star guides us on our way
As we are heading home
The many hardships we've endured
That brought us rich rewards
Now the North star guides us home
With cargo full of gold
Many friends died on the way
Only few of us survived
But I would gladly trade them place
In Odens hall up high
The icy winter is getting near
Dark skies above us
Biting frost is in the air
Darkness surrounds us
Soon the lakes and seas will freeze
And snow will lay its trail
And we will hope for the summer breeze
When we can set our sails <start> sometimes I wish it would never end
sometimes I wish I couldn't care
sometimes I feel like I'd never see you again
take a walk on an autumn night
inhale the stars and drown in their gleam
does it really take dying children
to see what makes the world go round
sometimes I wish I could drown all them smiles and fears
...but as long as I can drown in my own
I guess I won t give a fuck anyway... <start> Their ways are open
They spread as their wings
They want to be certain
of a warm surrounding
When they fly
Through the night as beautiful
Nighttime birds
The warm winds pick them up <start> Go Yeow
Pain ain't even really what you wanna be
 feet under seeing your humanity
The opportunity to devide
the opportunity of being apart
Soon be there the moon in the sky tonight
We're burning on a purified
Smash your face and then I beat it down
Are we really gonna die
Get up and fight release your rage come on and fight
Standing straight faced it is your fate calling my name
Calling me pain and if you stay you'll bite the scythe
Waiting for you I want to just tell you
If you want peace prepare for war
Fuck
Get up and fight release your rage come on and fight
Standing straight faced it is your fate calling my name
Calling me pain and if you stay you'll bite the scythe
Waiting for you I want to just tell you

Standing straight faced it is your fate calling my name
Calling me pain and if you stay you'll bite the scythe
Waiting for you I want to just tell you
If you want peace prepare for war <start> I'm just a loser in the game of love
I'm just an stray boy in the shade
And how I wish to know what love is like
To find someone to contemplate
There's a voice in a million answers
To the questions I don't ask
A demon  I've got to contain
When I'm walking through the fen
Getting deep into the black
There are whispers that I can't restrain
Don't give in
Rise to fame  time will come
Make your claim  time has come
For the crow to fly away
So you're an angel meant to walk down here
And you believe it's all divine
And you don't play by all those temporal rules
You watch the world begin to die
Alright  when the lamb's been torn to pieces
I've been crashing from the sky
The fallen to care for the prey
They put a spoke right in your wheel
I'm the one to dare the weak
To push you all over the pain
you give in oh
Rise to fame  time will come
Make your claim  time has come
For the crow to fly away
I close my eyes
And I see what's coming my way
He's got treasure in his eyes
That he's gonna turn to clay
Hm I'm a stranger I'm a changer
And I'm danger... maybe...
Fallen Angel  waiting for the prey
The devil has come to take a maimed away
Penetration of the twisted mind
The evil is out for the weaked blind
I can feel it in your voice
Ever so sweet no
Do I really have a choice no no no
Oh you burn your feet on unholy ground
You roam the barren wickd plains abound
In evil lies and evil speak
Abound in all you evil freaks
When you say it's all divine
And meant be
What about your flesh and blood
And defiers like me
Their evil eyes are looking down on you
And those who don't are losing sight of you
Facing the rage to chase away
The specter of disgrace and shame
withered roses dying on the ledge
A withered dreamer standing on the edge
You dream of love but you wake up to pain
You're better off to join in my game
Then she'll be better off to cry contrite tears
One day she'll wonder why
She had to let you disappear oh dear
Rise to fame  Your time has come
Time will come  To take the sun
Make your claim  You're drawn to the sound
Time has come  You're leaving ground
Rise to fame  the flight of the crow
Time will come  Cross the line
Time has come  For the crow to fly away
It's a flight to hell
Can you hear the bell
The devil has come
To take your soul away
A flight to hell  Alright
I'm a stranger
I'm a changer
And I'm danger
Fallen Angel
Waiting for the prey <start> Rarely the rare are seen in the ocean of chaotic reality
This lighthouse gives direction caution and awareness
In the dark and distant this man is still seen
His fierce devotion to what he believes is true
As he feels the weight of this collapsed nation
Staring into the face of adversity 
With courage and bravery
It keeps him walking towards the flames 
In good faith that he will remain
Our existence is an imprint
We all have a legacy to live he says to me

Our existence is an imprint
We all have a legacy to live he says to me

His grace is such a blessing
Surely it's something to write home about
It's presence never recognized while life passes by
never stopping to thank you
Be calm. Just sleep. Let your heavy spirit rest it's knees
You've been running for so many years he says to me
He says to me
A true inspiration a light in the dark and distant
I stop my life to thank you
You have carried me through the storm through it's heavy winds
I stop my life to thank you
Rarely the rare are seen
What's seen as defeat is his philosophy
Better to be a oneman army than a cavalry hurdling the weak
He brings comfort to the masses in the name of compassion
His merit his amour clears the path for the broken down and defeated
To see the masterpiece that's painted in our names
What we see is not all we believe 
He will remain
What we see is not all we believe 
He will remain <start> Early in the morning
We heard the engines roar
In the sky
Thunder breaks the silence
When fire fills the sky
Burning sky
The rivers begin to boil
There's no escape
We're bound to die
Red colored is our soil
The death's falling
From the sky
Detonations around us
We all prepare to die
Die
Dead men don't tell tales
In silence we will lie
Forever lie
The rivers begin to boil
There's no escape
We're bound to die
Red colored is our soil
The death's falling
From the sky <start> Troops are thrashing onwards
To rape all holy land
Seek victims as the sun descends
Damnation is at hand
The sound of killing
Threatens the weak
Slashed wrists greet us
Blasphemous fiends
Merciless
Merciless
We don't oppose evil
We are
We don't oppose evil
We are merciless
Incomprehensible

Graced submissive rectified force
Raining daggers open death's doors

We don't oppose evil
We are Incomprehensible <start> I watched for you by the Eastern gate
Till the bloody break of day
Then I drove the needle deep
And slowly ran away
Dragons to the left of me
Demons to the right
The dark lord smiles with scarlet eyes
As the silver vampire bites
A million stars blaze in my hand
And moon flames in my hair
So like the time you touched me first
But this time you're not there
Instead a rider cloaked in black
With deadly dreaming eyes
Soars near me on a ghastly steed
Whose thunder fills the skies
Now lurking near the Eastern gate
I hold a crystal blade
It's edges greened with venom stain
It's orchilt pitted jade
I feel his will gush through my brain
In endless waves of gore
Yet still the question breathes within
Who am I waiting forr
Into the Ithilstone
Reflection searing bright
Burning in my private hell
Caught in the grip of night <start> our final stand
the last command
our journals final entry
you did so well
none left to tell
about the damnation you brought on
bring down the damned

How about this <start> ... As long as winds will blow
My pride will be
And a star will shine
From far away...
...As long as winds will blow
My pride will be
And hate remains
Inside my heart
At night a star did shine upon
What once was build on my ancestors' land
When once I was young
Willing to learn
From the old and the wise
...As long as winds will blow
My pride will be
And hate remains
Inside my heart
Evening fell unto this land
That once was build by my ancestors' hand
When I was young
Willing to fight
...for as long as the winds will blow... <start> Over mountains I feel safe
sacred were those summers.
And these memories I place in my heart for shelter.
And I modify just to smell the ocean.
And I underline visualizing motion.
And I guess I miss my home
I could not stay.
I'll return it's alright I'm ok.
Reoccurred daydream tie up stern first.
And these gifts I've learned never leave me.
And I redesign family and growing.
And I realign forgetting nothing.
Maybe in a few years it'll come back to you
reflection becoming your virtue.
So sort me out lay me away.
Over these mountains I feel safe.
And bless the sound return the day.
Over these mountains I feel safe. <start> We could blame the world forever
We could just escape together
So are we breaking out or are we breaking down
We can't blame this world forever 
The end will never come
There's still a mountain left to climb
But we will overcome the hurdles placed inside our minds

Each day will bring us a brand new stars

We cannot live like this no more
'Cause in the thick of darkened days we know
We could blame the world forever
We could just escape together
So are we breaking out or are we breaking down
We can't blame this world forever 
Just need some clarity can't seem to open up these eyes
For what your sympathy it took me time to realize

Or how I thought this life would be

So take this shit away from me
'Cause in the thick of darkened days we know
We could blame the world forever
We could just escape together
So are we breaking out or are we breaking down
We can't blame this world forever 
So are we breaking out or are we breaking down
I guess what's done is done
But we will overcome
We could blame the world forever
We could blame the world forever
We could just escape together
So are we breaking out or are we breaking down
We can't blame this world forever 
'Cause in the thick of darkened days
We know <start> Closer than the clothes on your skin wearing thin. You never tried. Sleeping under backyard stars in present tents in your defense I wonder why you never said good bye Resenting the letters. Pretending forever. How many times can this be true You make it sound so easy.  Presenting those pretentious tenses as presents on Wednesdays. Thank you. alone all along all alone. Say goodnight or say good bye Candle light lies to line your eyes Broken words to parted lips just like the last time. Until I find you choke you with your own tongue and watch you slip away. Timed lines hide in empty eyes. This seat you see as empty holds a hole for you to look for when you come through. You're face to face within me when you come through and remember now you've gone too forget false ties. I never had the time to let you go Keep killing with a canvas car crash into continuous call time for empty signs. behind sight fighting for time. The end of another December and another second passes. Don't try this time. we can't rewind. I can stay away if you can stay awake I'll Figure it out and bleed you now give back your heart Tear it apart and let you down you'll see the seasons now Don't forget how to hold your affectation so proud Your lies are too loud never pretend to feel again. Because you can't laugh last if I stab you in the throat with the knife that you left in my back. <start> I saw the future in a tree outside.
There was your heart and there was mine.

Is this what we dreamed
I cannot go.
Take this heart let it die slow.
Tear away from
Tear away from the pain.
Tear away from
Tear away from the red.
Are we trading in our hearts for emptiness
Is this love or human condition

Buying new gear
Believing illusions
Staying always here
Searching conformity
Wanting easy lives
Striving for normality
Embracing the hive
I am god Look at me Feel my rage Bend your knees
No more painful hatred We are lost close to death
Now break Thin Porcelain
And die Give them your last breath
Will you finally reach out for the gate
Learning superstitions
Escaping tears
Getting good mentions There's no answer here
There is a solution beyond this dark sky
A new devotion Allowing us to fly <start> How can we let this happen and
Just keep our eyes closed 'till the end
The only thing that counts is the prosperity of today
Most important to us is that our bills get paid
Our good intentions have always been delayed
How can we let this happen and
Just keep our eyes closed 'till the end
When we will stand in front of heaven's gate
It will be too late
Try to unlearn all that you've learnt
try to listen to your heart
No we can't understand the universe
by just using our mind
We are so afraid of all the things unknown
A must we appease is the lust to get laid
Nothing really matters just devouring our prey
Our good intentions have always been delayed so
Our generous acts have always come too late
We are so afraid of all the things unknown
We just flee into a dream that never comes true
Low to the ground we feel safe
Low to the ground we feel brave
Oblivisci tempta quod didicisti
Open your eyes we're not in paradise
How can't you see this stress is killing me
Fulfil your dreams life is not what is seems
We have captured time
so time made us all hostages without mercy
Seemingly generous fooling ourselves
Selfishly venomous time tells
Too much thinking goes at the cost of all our intuition
Our thoughts create reality
But we neglect to be
So we're already slaves of our artificial world
We shouldn't try to control life
but listen to the laws of nature
We all think we're generous
But we only fool ourselves
The only thing that matters is
Our way and our vision
Selfishly we're venomous
But you know the time tells us
There is more to life than our
Higher positions race for perfection
Better faster
We must return to the laws of the nature
Free ourselves from madness <start> Ass jocks suck off Boston hardcore. <start> In my dreams I've seen brutal scenes of war
Acts of sickness and plague spreading around
I glorify the ground as I wander
The aura of life surrounds me as the day turns to night
My life will never be the same again
Emotions control my every thought
Emotions make my body change
They talk to me from inside
The talk and I combine
As life surrounds
Strength don't turn your face from me now
Can't you see how weak I am without you
Walk with me walk my path enjoy the ride
As everything goes by I lay my thoughts on you
Like a ticking time machine I'm set to go off
Be my enemy be my friend by my side until the end <start> It's a personal feeling how your world is turning
You can blind your eyes but you decide
And something is aching
And your world is breaking down
There's a whole lot more than this
That you're dying to resist
There's a whole lot more than this
chorus
There are stranger days to come
When all the rivers run dry
There are stranger days to come...
You can almost taste it
But you can replace it
There's a homegrown madness going on
Get to know your feelings
The emotion can explode
There's a wider world I hear
Let your conscience disappear
With an easy ride from here
chorus
There's no sun in the sky forever
I see stranger days than these
In my heart in my dreams
When the world stops spinning me forever...
Forever
On and on and on and on and on
Forever forever
Forever and ever forever forever
I see stranger days... <start> Moshi kimi ga ano toki

Vor so einigen Leuten war ich auf der Hut.
Meine Freunde werden immer zu mir stehen
denn was uns verbindet wird niemals vergehen.
Und sie feierten viele Feste.
Rauschende Nchte mit zahlreichen Gsten.
Doch ich war nicht immer mit von der Partie.
Gute Laune auf Knopfdruck da ist man nicht free.
Doch dann verlor ich mein Zuhause.
Mein Vermieter das war ein Banause.

... <start> The witch is dead
Burn black messiah enlighten my path with thy flames
Guide me through thy kingdom in this godforsaken rain
And reveal all my pain
Again and again...
Where the mountains shadow the landscape from the sun
Where there's eternal dusk and the ashes turn to dust
Where the storms of the northern skies call their names
The names of the horned ones the names of their sons
Show me the landscape that will soon be mine
Show me the world where we shall drink blood as wine
I've crossed the oceans I've seen the spots on the sun
I've died a thousand times no way this kingdom
Won't be mine
The blood of a thousand vampires pumps
Through my filthy vains
Like the stormy rivers that hold the secrets of the autumn rain
I've wandered through the darkest lands
And conquered them all
I've destroyed all that's holy and achieved all of my goals
I stand in the pentagram invoking the daimons to rise
In the light of a thousand candles
Shadows dance before my eyes
Naked and with their lips against mine in an infernal kiss
With my eyes closed I step into the darkest abyss
Evil  We adore you
Evil  Finally you have arrived
Evil  We adore you
Evil  Gone are those who once denied
A dusky raven flew through the blackened skies
With the message of a time to come
A time ruled by witches and vampires
A time when all that once was holy is gone
And only when you've cast aside your doubts
Will you be able to be one of us
To become one with the kindred
To join our blasphemous horde
..and I'll be your lord
Forever more...
Burn black messiah enlighten my path with thy flames
Guide me through thy kingdom in this godforsaken rain

Will you be able to be one of us
To become one with the kindred
To join our blasphemous horde <start> When I hold a mic in my hand it's devotion
Then I began flowing in a smooth steady motion
Cause i'mcontended to know that I've invented
Poetry which has been highly complimented
Thus how I rhyme is what I feel on stage
And from a fraction of a thought I can write a whole page
I'll just pull a notebook from off the shelf
And like saltnpepa I express myself
To make most of you know me and some of you don't
But when it comes to cold challenging I bet none of you won't
Arrange a battle improve your style
Against a brother with a totally different profile
Most of you flake cold front ya flex
And hesitate on rhymes that should've been memorex
But you forgot I remember you're an amateur
Mystery worshipper nowi prefer
Thati remind you or tease ya on who's the boss
Cause you suffer amnesia that's memory loss
Well get this just as quiet as it's kept
Mc's on the chart from teh start has slept
Let's shake themwake them they should be woke
For what they take mc'ing for a practical joke
You don't have what it takes to be an mc
Ya just as phony as ya wanna be
You present yourself to be the quiet storm
You're a sneaky littlesnake in a devilish form
But as they say yo to each it's own
And to each one who plays with a microphone
Abbreviate microphone and m.i.c.
Meaning what myself i you see
I invite those to battle me then they're through
Bust it i'mnot prejudiced you're invited too
The rap convention or the mc show
I have rhymes to block those who hit below
The belt that means biting a rhyme
Yes I'll wax you tax you and plus save time
Now who is known to uphold his own
And words are heard like a strong baritone
Freestyle techniques that's wild and bold
That'll smile in your face and still come so cold
That I'll freeze you to the point of nondefrost
Now you're trapped in the land of the lost
Should i could i would I lose
When it's a selfish sore loser like you I choose
To roll your big eyes and suck your buck teeth
Because you're upset that you ever caused beef
Yo homeboy I never meant to tease
But it's a slaughter can someone help him please
Feeling uncomfortable then loosen your belt
Once the genius gets heated up suckers will melt
Then after ya melt ya start dripping like water
Then you can say this was a goddamn slaughter
You don't have what it takes to be an mc
Ya just phony as ya wanna be
Ain't no rhymes like the one I got
They put competitors in a trance y'all
Radio stations ran them a lot
They made children play and dance y'all
How dare ya mention you're an mc
When the crowd disagrees on who claim to be
Cause your battle piece are the rhymes you release
And that only make the crowd boos increase
Hey may I say I'll stay a dj
Mc who try to defeat me or portray
One who claims he gain much respect
But in a battle straight up and down ya getting wrecked
Cauise getting with me is definitely a slaughter
Or diving in a pool head first without water
So don't set yourself up to get brutalized
That only happens when you're not energized
Bit I'm so damn energized I'm energetic
That I can wreck a microphone 'til it's pathetic
Oka got it in your head correct
That I'm victoriouson any subect
You disbelieve then huh call the title
Then after one rhyme you'll be calling me your idol
It's like..zap...another one on my jock strap
Now you walk around praising my name
Cause I'm slamming and I make you feel the pain
You don't have what it takes to be an mc
Ya just phony as ya wanna be <start> I The Dawn Of Steel

II The Pipes Of War
This is The Story for centuries untold
On a misty morning at the break of dawn
Out of the night as shadows of Doom
Black armours shine in the cold morning light
They come from the mountains they come from the seas
They come with a purpose a power to wield
They're ready to die on the battlefield
They're ready to die for the Sword the Gods forged long ago
A sword is laying on an altar of gold
inside a circle of magical stones
Thousands of Warriors behold the Emperor
As he steps inside the circle offering a sacrifice
They come to kill They come to fight
Armies are raised one against the other
Brave men are lead to death like lambs to the slaughter
All of this just for one man's greed and pride
III The Sacrifice Chant
Pre Chorus
Oh Mighty Gods of Chaos
Let the Power descend from the sky
Give me the Ultimate Weapon
I claim what is mine by right
I offer the Blood of the Nations
Souls as a sacrifice
We come from afar
from our City Of Light for
Chorus
IV War 
We come here from far away
From the Mountains and from the Seas
I come to fulfil my Fate
leading men to their demise
Brother against brother
Until no one is left alive
Many souls will sleep in hell tonight
Now it's time for war
V Sword Fight
guitar solo
Fearless in a haze of bloodlust
Riding at breakneck speed
Armies clash one against the other
A sea of blood flooding the field
And as the thunder roars in the distance
The setting sun paints a crimson sky
And as the Tyrant raise the sword
The Silver Sword is Broken oh no
VI The Sword Is Broken
pre chorus
Oh Mighty Gods of Chaos
No Power descended from the sky
I craved for the Ultimate Weapon
I claimed what was mine by right
I offered the Blood of the Nations
Souls as a sacrifice
I came from afar
from my City Of Light to die for...
Chorus

VII The Sunset Of Steel <start> My decision is fixed
The suitcases are packed
I'm laying the letter on the table
Tonight I will be safe and the fears will be over
I shall outline my own way again
I'm walking to the door
Open it and look behind for the last time...
But he's at the doorstep  this can't be real
He's surprised because he notices my bags
Immediately he grabs my wrists and pushes me inside
I realise I'm lost...
O no what have you done
What have you done
Where is your self respect
You've defiled our honour and your throth
You crossed the line
You won't get out this time
You won't get out
There's no other solution
Then requite you for this insult
But he's at the doorstep  this can't be real
He's surprised because he notices my bags
Immediately he grabs my wrists and pushes me inside
While he's reading the letter I realise I'm lost...
Faded beauty her body trembles...
The scars of this dream will always be remembered <start> taken from letters sent by Jack the Ripper
Fired anticipation burns within me.
Revealed in illness at infancy.
Whispering Jack born in a fever.
Twice as sharp as a butcher's cleaver.
Aesthetic blade let death be quick.
Gaslit street a butchers trick.
Whispering Jack born in a fever.
Twice as sharp as a butcher's cleaver.
Your mind is bled hunger's been fed.
Every woman's body par' to some it's meat to me it's art.
I've taken my need left her my seed.
Autumn of terror white chapel homicides.
Addiction for suffering for all the whores that died.
...I send you half the kidney I took...
the other I preserved...
I may send the bloody knife that took it out
if only you wait a while longer
Reveling at Lustmord the second part of me.
Foreplay with a scalpel blade my sexual activity.
Whispering Jack born in a fever.
Twice as sharp as a butcher's cleaver.
Aesthetic blade let death be quick.
Gaslit street a butchers trick. <start> I've got a leg it's made out of wood
I bought it in a tavern from a gnarly old dude
When I got shot to pieces by a cannon ball
It cut me down to size I used to be quite tall
A couple of drinks to dull the pain
I stood up on my leg and began to fight again
When all of a sudden can you believe
A cannonball hit me in the other knee
Ah you spanish bastards
Wooden leg wooden leg wooden leg
I've got a wooden leg wooden leg
Wooden leg wooden leg wooden leg
I've got a wooden leg wooden leg
Wooden leg wooden leg wooden leg
I've got a wooden leg wooden leg
Wooden leg wooden leg wooden leg
I've got a wooden leg wooden leg
Now both of my legs are made of wood
The future's looking grim it doesn't seem good
So I drink all day and I drink all night
I get really drunk and get into a fight
With a samurai guy with ninja skills
He beats me up til I'm nearly killed
I ask him for mercy do me no harm
But the bastard chops off both my arms
Ah you japanese bastards
Wooden leg wooden leg wooden leg
I've got a wooden leg wooden leg
Wooden leg wooden leg wooden leg
I've got a wooden leg wooden arm
Wooden leg wooden leg wooden leg
I've got a wooden leg wooden leg
Wooden leg wooden leg wooden leg
I've got a wooden leg wooden leg <start> Straight forward this all falls into place.
I can do this on my own .
I seem to be the only one awake.
Just please don't give into them . <start> Baktuk Olaf Hayer

My Lord everything is now in place
Our years of planning are bearing fruit
Long have we waited for this day
Now let us set out with our troops
Oh yes I long to pave their streets in blood
And ebb and flow with waves of gore
Long have we waited for this day
Now let them taste of pain of our lore
Sorvahr
Of course your blades are thirsting for pain
But don't your loins hunger for pure flesh
Rip through the maidens slay the men
Let them know the meaning of wrath
But this listen to me when I say
Disturb me not when the battle dawns
Long have I waited now for this day
My eye lies upon other gains
Leave the Castle walls untouched
I forbid you to enter that scene
A score I must settle awaits me long
What lies beyond belongs to me
Your doom is nigh
Though you see it not
Our forces ride
And your hope will rot

Lying under all you believe
Is a darkness to you all but unseen
Skies will be torn and rain

Pray tell
What do you want with all this war
We live in peace and know you not
Please take our surrender and no more lives
We relent and give you all we've got
Sorvahr
What's this so easily you're giving up
Dear brother I expect more from you
For know me well you surely do
But I've long shed my binding to you
Come now I'm only taking what is mine
The score I must settle here for us all
Your land I leave to the will of my men
I care not if your house now falls
Your doom is here
And now you can see
Your every fear
Belongs to me

Vereinigung wie nie zuvor
Kein Glaube kein Respekt
Welch Triumph und Lust
Nail  the christ
Blood  above us
Black crucifixion of their god
Die Ngel werden ausgerissen und

Black crucifixion of their god
Man ffnet ihm die Seite  die Seite

Sound and Fury
Smoke and flames
How can all this be
Studs and leather
Hell's whip flashing
Coming down on me
I've stayed one step
ahead of time
But now the cracks of doom
Snakes across my back
like lightning
Burning bright
My soul is dying
Watch out for the thunder
Throw the lights upon me
Like diamonds on the sky
Music is my magic
And magic is my high
But still they keep on striking
Those flaming whips of steel
Won't you tell me
What you want from me
I'm running
I'm screaming
I'm fling like a fallen
angel for you
Can't you feel my thunder
And there's no rest
for the wicked
No sleep for the metal demon
No rest for the wicked
'Till the Black Knight comes <start> I am the waiting one it seems
Days grow somber quickly
Now how the quiet is released
And I feel so lonely
How did you think I would feel
Throw me aside again
How did you think I would feel
Won't let you hurt me again now
I'm nothing to you I can see
Just walk away from me
I'm torn up but I can't believe
You sat and watched me bleed
She knows the waiting one in me
That I needed to hold me
Still I can smell her hear her breath
Feeling invited inside me
How long I've waited
Waited for you
To come back to hold me
What should I what should I
What should I do
When I feel so lonely
How could you do this to me
Betrayed by my closest friend
How could you do this to me
Won't let you hurt me again now
I'm nothing to you I can see
Just walk away from me
I'm torn up but I can't believe
You sat and watched me bleed
What should I
What should I do
Well how long I have waited
What can I
What can I do
When I feel so lonely
How did you think I would feel
Threw me aside again
How did you think I would feel
Won't let you hurt me again now
I'm nothing to you I can see
Just walk away from me
I'm torn up but I can't believe
You sat and watched me bleed
How could you do this to me
Betrayed by my closest friend
How could you do this to me
Won't let you hurt me again
I am the waiting one it seems <start> It's alright

Hold tight

Tonight

You're gonna love what you feel
Baby you're the one I need tonight
And I wish upon a star

All the time I dreamed about you
Baby I can give you what you want now boy tonight
Oh baby
I'm not like all the rest
I really care for you baby
And a boy like you
Deserves only the best
It's alright alright
We don't have to worry
Hold tight 
This love is for real
Tonight 
Baby there's no hurry
You're gonna love what you feel yeah
I know you suffered way too long boy
Don't you see I have the cure
I could help your heart recover
Listen baby 'coz you know that I can give you
What you never had before
Oh baby
I dedicate my love to you
I will be there for you baby
You know that I've been waiting
For a boy like this

can feel inside of you
Feel my flame your flame
That burns inside of you and me
And I hope from you
I hope honesty condolence
from you and me
And I want from you
I want trust no more distrust
for you and me
to give to receive you know that
nothing is free.
Everything has a price
Hard to find a compromise
Roads part easily everyone
Everyone makes its own way
Brothers tear apart
To feel unique
Friends destroy themselves
Just to end up lonely
Brothers tear apart
To feel unique
Friends destroy themselves
Just to end up lonely
We looked for our common points to find each other
in our opposites we even laid bare ourselves
to carry masks.
But there's nothing true anymore
everything's stopped
The story is over
I shall not forget I've learnt.
I want to live all your experiences.
I want to be with you during the bad days.
And to delight myself in your enjoyments
but Love is a selfsacrifice.
Lovers hate each other
Just to feel free
races kill each other
not to be outcasts anymore
Lovers hate each other
Just to feel free
Even races kill each other
not to be outcasts anymore
Like a double I can see yourself in the mirror
I can see truthlove
hate inside of you and me
Close your eyes I know where we're goin'
my flame your flame
That burns inside of you and me
Why do you suddenly go away from me
I hope from you
I hope honesty condolence
Like a double I can see yourself in the mirror
I want trust no more distrust
for you and me
I could not be the reflect of
someone else
I could not be the reflect of
someone else
I don't wanna love anymore
if we are separated
I don't wanna give my friendship
to be betrayed
I can't feed my roots anymore
my heart has become dry
I could not be the reflect of
someone else
Lovers hate each other
Brothers tear apart
Friends destroy themselves
Races kill each other
I live and let myself one more chance...
...to love stronger even if I know it can open
those old but still living sores one more time
...to trust my friends again those who had
hurtfull words when I wasn't there
...to take up blood ties  I need to know
where I come from
...to accept my fellow whoever he is
And wherever he comes from
Coz like a double
I see myself in you
Lovers hate each other
Double Double
Races kill each other
Double Double
Brothers tear apart
Double Double
Friends destroy themselves
Double Double
Double Double <start> There is no afterlife
We all just decompose
No Heaven's pearly gates
Just tags upon our toes
A slow putrescence
From the time the life is shorn
Feast for the maggots
Reborn
Wet and adipocerous
Our flesh turns in to wax
Enter hypostasis
Pale skin discolored black
Regeneration
When life has adjourned
Insect infestation
Our favors are returned
When from this world we are unbound
We're food for the worms
When they plant me in the ground I'm
Food for the worms
The reaper beats at the gate of every man
Lies fill the Bible Tanakh and Quran
It matters not which dogma you believe
Our bodies are left to rot like fallen leaves
The circle of life it marches on
We fertilize the ground we walk upon
Feast for the vultures' all that's left
While hope spring eternal for the bereft
The throes of rigor mortis
Forensic certainty
Heaven Olam HaBa
Fairy tales of lunacy
We're vessels for the larvae
Not vessels for the soul
Transform to liquefaction
Make all nature whole
Food for the worms <start> Night surrounds me
As I sit alone
In the indecipherable darkness.
I smell the noise of past.
Vivacity of the wind begets clear my mind.
In eternal isolation.
Those that pretend to carekill you
And leave you for being dead.
I seekfor where am I
The throes of death swirl within me
And I smile.....
Liferaped by disease.
Cast out.
No place for me here.
I create my kingdom.
Creation through destruction
Cut out the heart of the Christian disease.
Knowledge my fortune
I channel the strength of my will.
The lure of the moonlight
Streams forthwith abundance of strength.
I bask in it's essence
Devouring the force
Succouring my veins.
I traverse to the beckon of my desire.
Destruction.
This stagnant humanity serves only to frustrate.
Unfit to stand alonehuddled in their masses
Synonymous in their worthless existence.
The time will come to pass.
Creation of life
Destruction of the disease.
LyricsGreg
MusicGreg <start> My face is slack
And kidneys burn
In the small of my back
Will never learn
Well I'm not going back
To the slow life
Because every step is a drag
And pieces of kite
Of materials you never catch
Come up for a snatch
Up from hell
Once in a while
Cause I am Jack
From a burning ring
My face is slack
And I think think think
I just think think think
Too fast to write
Too fast to work
Just burn burn burn
I sat and drank
While my dreams decay
I'm 
Cause I am Jack
From a burning ring
And my face is slack
And I think think think
I just drink drink drink
Too fast to write
Too fast to work
I just burn burn burn
I eat hot dogs
I live on pies
I'm 
Cause I am Jack
And I think think think
Just think think think
Too fast to write
Too fast to work
Just burn burn burn
And put down leftwing tirades
And the musical trade
End free trade
I say eat this grenade
Gonna eat this grenade
Cause I am Jack
Some man from the docks
They are smart
Their brains are half
They never end
Just follow trends
But I am Jack
From a burning ring
My face is slack
And I think think think
Just think think think
Too fast to write
Too fast to work
I just burn burn burn
I am Jack
And put down leftwing tirades
And the musical trade
End all free trade
I said eat this grenade
I said eat this grenade
End all free trade
I said eat this grenade <start> The waking hour of scarlet warfare I will fight for you. Our blood will wash away. Their skin will crack and peel in a thousand fires. We will break every bone we will crush them all to dust. An attempt so frivolous to save your life. Watch you hit the sanguine ground like autumn leaves. With each nail driven you drift away. This somber burial is a calamity. Rise from your casket and kiss new breath from me. To those who can't behold your fading moonlight beauty radiating from your precious eyes a tender gaze. Never witnessing an instance when you held time still forever in your matron hands. Rise from your casket revive this effigy. New life will feed your starving lungs. New blood will surge through collapsed arteries and I'll hold you through it all. <start> i sat down in the dirt i was born again
with a pain in my back
received and sent
a sharp reminder of my favorite approach
he spat in your face and he expected a note
he was a golden boy
i was a problem child
the blood of god is staining my hands
can we sit and cry a while
i beg for position like a broken seam
a permanent argument for another man's dream
i bit down and tasted myself deep in you
with steel in my teeth i look to the sky and said
if this is free then i won't take it
my forgiving tongue remember when i made it
with my broken heart i said i'd look over you
how numb are we
how numb are you
blinking lids on hollow faces
saw this empty situation
this misconception we painted
on a postcard simple and naked
i'm the savior that betrayed you
i'm your maker
i display you.
if this is free then i don't need it
you shook your head
i gave you someone to bleed with
you promised every breath i took that i'd look over you
a subtle smile that i never had
a bleeding heart that i never had
i owe nothing to you
i only suffered with you
if this is free then i won't take it
my forgiving tongue remember when i made it
with my broken heart in hand i look over you
over myself
if i'm free then you won't take me
how impossible do you have to make me
with my broken heart in hand
you look over me
over yourself <start> Music Schulman
Lyrics Schulman
In the skies of the twilight
A millenium of chaos in the land forlorn
The purest hate unleashed
As I'm the reaper of everything that is holy
I gather my bloodlusting forces
Spawned by the slaughter
Devastate the feeble ones
Crush the holy ground
A bloodbath beneath the dark moon
Raise the flames higher
On the path through the night
My scornful laugh echoes
As the sword swings  a scream from the impaled
I spit on your christian ground
I split your enormous lies
I rape and ruin your holy land
I am bloodfreezing devastation
Raging into a deep red battle
The third storm is raising high
The dark dominion is final
As we are gathered forever
I spit on your christian ground
I split your enormous lies
I rape and ruin your holy land
I am bloodfreezing devastation
Revelation  Total destruction and despair
Desaster  Breathing the fear of the wind
Slaughter  Torn are your illusions
Soulrape  Supreme neverending art
Blood flows red from the weak
The season of the ancient
Feed my possessed horde
Stabbing the christian lambs
Raping the whiteblinded whores
The human darkness recalls
The reign of death I follow
A revenge in my subconsciousness
We summon the eternal kingdom
I spit on your christian ground
I split your enormous lies
I rape and ruin your holy land
I am bloodfreezing devastation <start> Awaiting the shining the fire neverseen
Waiting for  mourning light
I raise my hands to the sky
As I see the moon in my eyes
The night falls down on my way
Through the clouds it shines on me
As I walk through eternity
Wolves run by my side
Fullmoon in my eyes reflecting the death
Twisted trees clawing at the skies
Creatures of the night
Frozen winds through the time
Whispers my name
Fly on my wings through the darkest of night
Feel the pain and try to die
Never see the light before
Lost sour sense of a dying world
The black night before me
I stand socluded there
A godless portal to hell
I could see the gate
Rise before me
I entered the reign of death
Shadow appears in front of me
Painfull harmony
Through the winds into the night
I'll proclaim my life
Once again a voice calls to me
A shadow crawled along my side
Eyes of the night gaze at me
Dancing souls of mankind
Fullmoon  in my eyesreflectingthe light
Awaiting the shining the fire neverseen
Waiting for  mourning light
I raise my hands to the sky
As I see the light of life <start> Contined to a lightless cell locked in solitaire
Denied food and water a cruel form of punishment
Expecting me to die I am never to be fed
In thirty days the jailers surprised when I'm not dead
I feed upon myself my body is my repast
In gluttony I carouse in my corporeal cuisine
Taking in nourishment literally from head to toe
Aside from the hair and pain the mainn course is great
Appendages devoured and chewed to stubs
The trunk of my gnawed body projecting nubs
My own flesh and pith taste delectable
As my hunger is satisfied by consuming myself
As the days roll on I ration on fodder
Nibbling slowly upon my shoulders and arms
I have to force myself to selfcannibalize
On my meaty parts I gormandize
Swallowing lumps of my personal provisions
Life prolonged by gorging on my bodily grub
What is to be the billoffair tonight
Will it be my left leg or my right
When the captors finally open my sealed cage
An astonishing appalling sight they find
Their prisoner disarticulated and terrible gnashed
Belly bloated with dissevered bites eaten of my mass
My nipples bitten off and ground between my teeth
Now I prepare to dine upon my bloody severed tongue
Unable to eat belching erupts from my bloody chops <start> Early man walked away as modern man took control
Their minds weren't quite the same to conquer was his goal
So he built his great empire and he slaughtered his own kind
Then he died a confused man killed himself with his own mind
We're gonna die
From our own arrogance <start> Born of laughter
Strangled by sin
No remorse
Mistreat the soul again
No features
The blur of things denied
No return
The cross to bear is my own
Just one sip and life returns
Razorfever
The pollution of your narrow perception
Read into the lines of men's work
Degeneration let the truth be known
Numb the pain with liquid of fire tonight
Numb the pain with the liquid of fire tonight
Razorfever burns
Born a desperation's child
Admist the last descent
Fierce as that of angel's wrath
To lay the soul to rest
Just one sip and life returns
The razor
The pollution of your narrow perception
Read into the lines of men's work
Degeneration let the truth be known
Numb the pain
Just one sip
Just one more
Just one sip
So my world can be restored
The pollution of your narrow perception
Read into the lines of men's work
Degeneration let the truth be known
Numb the pain with liquid of fire tonight <start> Right now
Right here
We stand alone
Against pitiless indifference
We stand alone
Forever confounded
By the burning margins
To get without context
When into denial
Give in to ignorance
When the world responds in kind
Put an end to the search
And nullify the sense of life
Alone in silence
Yes I am frightened and so are you
Against pitiless indifference
We stand alone
Against the ever coming night
So we step back
To reveal a new perspective
When the allure of our gift is worn off
Not the least be curios
When giants steps away
No going back
Our time is running out
Alone in silence
Yes I am frightened and so are you
Against pitiless indifference
We stand alone
Must we resort
To the end of our inquiry
For this to make sense
This to make sense
Right here
Right now
We stand alone
Give up or recount them
The days of your life
The truth was of essence
When time was alive
There is no incentive to
Give in to the absurd
Reality and comfort
Live forever to oppose
Forever opposed
Alone in silence
Yes I am frightened and so are you
Against pitiless indifference
We stand alone <start> Born in a nation
A young generation
Is praying for salvation
Out of damnation
When the power's rising
Light fades the shadows away
Far beyond the gates of time
A revolution's calling
The power of freedom so devine
Saves us all from falling down
Voices from an ancient time
A prayer for the dying
A call for rebellion in the night
The lost souls are crying
Take my hand and fly away across the endless skies
Heal my soul light my heart
The time will wash my sins away
I'll bury all the lies
Take the power and fight for the brave
And the power of freedom remains
I'm riding across the endless skies
And I am watching the spirits flying
The time has come to fight
Brave at heart I'm dying
Take my hand and fly away across the endless skies
Heal my soul light my heart
I'll find the way to paradise
I'll bury all the lies
Chorus
Praise the lord of the glorious land
Time for me to understand
I believe in the sign he sent
Fame and glory I defend <start> Sickened by this apathy
The problems sit in front of our eyes but we do not see
We turn our backs to where the solutions lie
Destroy all that gives us life
Left it for dead we will soon follow
No future no tomorrow
Mankind's natural regression toward self destruction
The sky bleeds as the wound
Becomes infected
The end of a world neglected
Sift through the ashes
Ignored the signs 
Stripped away all that gives us our basic needs
We have already planted the seeds of destruction
Suffocate us for the price of corporation's greed <start> Shallow mind of a weakened kind
Unavoidably falling behind
Eyes open staring blind
Unshaped never divine
Climbing on others
Scarred psyche leader
To fulfill your plans
Insanity breeder
Wishing you had your life undone
Can't lie to the barrel of a gun
Psychologically fractured
Parasite of first degree
Suicidal revelations
Killing yourself to see
Your mistake of actions will come to find you
Unseen amongst the living
Strangeness still in evidence
Continue grave digging
Egoistic line of vision
Serenity seeking
Redundant by all means
An end to your pathetic preaching
Lead Blomqvist
Lead Sahlgren
Living life through others
By laws of exception
Paranoid schizophrenic searching
Your life has no intention
When your spirit is finally leaving
I've seen your demons except no grieving <start> Is there anybody there
Yeah

crawling trains of fragile tribe
cry in me ironic fool
die in me for all the suns you have inside
tidal hate to childish love
swallow the serpent on your tongue
spit me out a fish a rape
and love to drown in fading oils of drying lakes
Spit me out my name drown it all in tidal rage
paint it all the same colours meld to indifferent grey
wash my tears away the serpent's abyss longs for me
drown my words in yours and wish I'd never been <start> As I bake in this rancid oven that we call earth
hard to breathe through filth and muck that rides our air.
All I taste the bile phlegm collects within.
Feeling like shit again again again again
URA FUCKING LOSER AND YOU ARE NOTHING
Never rise stuck within the depths of which I dwell.
No way out feel I'll meet my maker soon.
I'm just waiting to die and take a different form.
I am cold smiling as hate keeps burning my soul.
URA FUCKING LOSER AND YOU ARE NOTHING
You're a fucking loser
That's all that you'll be.
You're just a fucking loser
No not me
URA FUCKING LOSER AND YOU ARE NOTHING
FUCK OFF YOU AIN'T SHIT <start> Es ist die Welt sie zu vergessen

Sieh dich um und siebe Knochen

Ich knnt' es so gut verwerten
die Sieben sie hallt tief in mich hinein
Ich knnte Knochen hrten
schlag' sie mit Gerten
Nur sieben knnen sicher sein
Tote Nacht gibt mir die Macht
gibt mir die Pein so soll es sein

Ein hohler Laut ein Pferdemaul

Ich knnte es so gut verwerten
die Sieben sie hallt tief in mich hinein
Ich knnte Knochen hrten

The root is bitter but the fruit is sweet but not exempt from criticism. Small pox friendship you die I take. You are the new slave. Don't call me God because I don't have a disease. What is cold to you is love to me. Savior seething rolling you in. Cherub in red said there's nothing to see here. Hallowed be who art in heaven. I refuse to call that fucker by name. <start> Do tuae somnum

Ne te font rien
Et toi tu penses et tu pleures
Et les prires que tu caresses
Se prcipitent au loin
O astu trouv l'ivresse ncessaire
Pour oublier de mourir
Tes hanches blanches font plir
Les vieux satans de NotreDame
Et toi tu danses entre les tombes
Enrcitant des pitaphes
Et toi tu danses entre les tombes
En rcitant des pitaphes
Les oiseaux s'lancent
Crevant le silence
Tu ne dis rien
D'autre qu'un vague aurevoir
A tes amants de promesse
O astu trouv l'vresse ncessaire
Pour oublier de vieillir
Ton charme blme fait rougir

Le reflet crach des toiles
Le long des quais tu vas narguant

Elle est loin ta flamme

Pour oublier de mourir
O vastu trouver l'ivresse ncessaire
Pour oublier de mourir
Et toi tu penses
Et tu plonges... <start> Hooks cutting through your flesh
No comparison of pleasure and pain
Black box it's a gory treat
Mutilation from hell
To the gory end
As they make you ride the blade
To the gory end
As your life will now fade
Crave for blood unnatural greed
Stuck in hell forever more
Ultimate pain blooded corpse
Living memory known deceased
To the gory end
As they make you ride the blade
To the gory end
As your life will now fade
See the masters of gore
Stricken with pain in hell
Hooks cutting through your flesh
No comparison of pleasure and pain
Black box is a gory treat
Mutilation from hell
To the gory end
As they make you ride the blade
To the gory end
As your life will now fade
Crave for blood unnatural greed
Stuck in hell forever more
Ultimate pain blooded corpse
Living memory known deceased <start> It's been three fucking days
Since sleep has taken me away
I found the remedy to erase you from my head.
I can't find a pulse to feel this
I'll never feel again
So say your last goodbyes
I'm taking back my sins
I'll take back the heart
I should of never let
let you in.
So say your last goodbyes
Today I'm not coming back
I won't crawl back again
I never loved you
I never cared
I never loved you
You won't fuck the life from me again
Now your hands are filthy with narcissistic identities
A slave another junkie
You're haunting the streets you're looking to feed
But I won't be your carcass
you can't add me to your pile of dead bodies
I'm driving the nails through your hands
So you can't fuck the life out of me
You won't fuck the life out of me
You can't fuck the life out of me
I never loved you.
I never cared
I never loved you
You can't fuck the life out of me
You won't fuck the life out of me <start> I'm in love with a girl and she's you
And I now this time that it's true
So unique so complete
Unlike any love there's been
And the loneliness I felt has gone
Cause I know you care
And I swear I won't let you down
As long as you want me around
Wherever you go whatever you do
No matter how far take my heart with you
Whenever you need however you choose
If ever you leave take my heart with you
>from the moment you wake
Wherever whatever
No matter how just take my heart with you...
Sometimes love though it hurts I must say
I wouldn't have it another way
Though I've lost this time I've won
Cause look what our love has become
They look to the past think it won't last
But that's the mistake that we haven't made...
Wherever you go whatever you do
No matter how far take my heart with you
Whenever you need however you choose
If ever you leave take my heart with you
From the moment you wake
Wherever whatever
No matter how just take my heart with you...
Take my heart with you
So that I can be with you
You know my heart
Can't be apart from yours...
Wherever you go whatever you do
No matter how far take my heart with you
Whenever you need however you choose
If ever you leave take my heart with you
From the moment you wake
Wherever whatever
No matter how just take my heart with you... <start> Walkin' five blocks every day to earn my keep
It ain't easy when you're walkin' on these streets
Runnin' on a tightrope it's a real thin line
Thinkin' that you might die this time
Some things will never change a street education
So close yet so far just a block from the station
Standin' on the corner I might get taken out
Five blocks to the subway just five blocks away
Five blocks to the subway I can do that any day
There's a local wise guy he owns the whole damn block
It's easy doin' business when you're payin' off the cops
Makin' money pushin' drugs wouldn't stop if he could
Killin' kids in his own damn neighborhood
Watch out for muggers and the pickpockets beware
You get to play these games when you pay transit fare
Trials and tribulations a journey made each day
This is my realitythe hardest game to play
Standin' on the platform and I'm waiting for the train
Good thing I'm underground now it's startin' to rain
Always stand alone hold the wall up with my back
Or else you might get pushed on to the tracks <start> Spoken
Ladies And Gentleman  Welcome To The Freakshow
Oh Yeah...
The world around is killing me
No thunder wind and rain
Eels are crawling everywhere
Compounding with the game
Grind the army the living dead without destination
The faceless crowd is out to kill all kinds of variations
You're trying to trample down my dreams
A shot in the dark
Mysteria  the spirit arising
Eldrich cries from the hill
Mysteria  fires are blazing
Their wicked feast is shattering the still oh
Seven days and nights a week
Spinning like a wheel
You try to buckle band and break
And polish stainless steel
Raging fury in the sky burning with desire
Selfdetermination rising from the fire
You're trying to trample down my dreams
My disdained ideals
Beware of the difference
We're savage and mean  we're a...
Mysteria....
Evil is the dreamer to pit himself
Against the forces of the tide
You pay the see to portray
What you wanna hear what he has senn that night
Oh  unholy is the feast
Watch us dance around the the blazing hellfire
And Lucifer arises he appears at my desire
Mysteria... <start> Mechanized death poisoned last breath
In dust realized kill what a thrill
All hell ablaze the furnace gates
Stands open wide for genocide
Genocide  physicians in league with death
Genocide  die this day or do with less
Genocide  hollow eyed and grey charade
Genocide  death head strut and masquerade
Vomiting blood where are you God
Can't you fuckin' smell
The damned stench excrement
Mountains of corpse can't you see Lord
It makes your Gomorrah look small very small
Flames to the sky white Christ is blind
The burning smoke the piles of bones
One final cry last pleading words
Through the chimney high
The prayer is unheard
Genocide  physicians in league with death
Genocide  die this day or do with less
Genocide  hollow eyed and grey charade
Genocide  death head strut and masquerade
Genocide  physicians in league with death
Genocide  die this day or do with less
Genocide  hollow eyed and grey charade
Genocide  death head strut and masquerade <start> Born to bleed with desert dream
With no illusions and no need
Made of steel but not for real
To feel is to sin
Turn blank pages in an empty book
There's nothing left to win
Born to bleed in a desert world
Silent agony everbleed <start> You think that I deserve this after all you
put me through Who the fuck are you to
judge a rightful penance for these ghastly
sins You've got no right nor did I you
fucking piece of shit
Oh what the fuck He backhands me to
the floor.
You fucking slut' He spits at me and
roars Oh Ill fuck up you and your
fucking whore. I dont give a fuck' Now
here's me crying on the floor 'Fuck you'
Gazing over to where my lover lies I hear
him whispering sweetly. 'Do you know
what's coming to you Three nails and
blood for two.' I can't believe my eyes
this fucking guy what the fuck is he
going to do
'I'm going to make you watch him bleed
rip him apart piece by piece. And after all
you've done 'you're sorry' isn't good enough
for me
Thats enough Just shut the fuck up I
don't want to hear from your dirty mouth.
In fact I'll cut it out. How do you like
me now
Good luck screaming bitch with your tongue cut out
Beating and bleeding upon this blood
stained floor I gaze and wonder Will I
ever leave here Carved and speechless
face I scream in silence... I scream in
pain... This fucking psycho has me gargling upon my own dismay
'I'm going to make you watch him bleed
rip him apart piece by piece. And after all
you've done 'you're sorry' isn't good enough
for me <start> Cry  away to heal
Fly  I want to flee
Pride and self  esteem
I will sigh no more
Pain is what i feel
Help is what i need
Please please stay with me
I need your helping hand
Hand I need your hand
How  could I believe
Life  only for me
Now  I'm alone
Near dead  end road
Stare  with empty eyes
Sign  of lifelessness
Why I'm so weak
Just let it all flow
Denial  Worst Enemy
Lies  have wounded me
Love  insanity
Loss of hopes and dreams
I just wanna live
I just wanna live
Denial  Worst Enemy
I just I just just wanna live
I just I just just wanna live <start> Behold me now I'm lost somehow
Summoned up in sorrow from a world beyond
Never let go my crimson rapture...
Can you touch my soul
I see you in every shade
In every moment I breathe
You came as the silent wanderer
Traveling to distant shores
I am the life that learned to die
I have no choice I've lost my voice
I am the tear who broke with fear
I won't return to death I turn
If humans were like swans
I could bear this burden with ease...
Never to witness this heartless disease
As the wounds of time neglect me
Walking the earth as the solitary reaper...
Dressed in the lost voices of time
I bathe in quiet waters of tearful shades
 I suffer in every corner of your sanctuary
Embrace me now for I will die
The pain I feel inside will never leave
But never let go my crimson rapture...
Can you heal my soul <start> It's not my fate to ignore these vicious thoughts.
I act like a stranger I'm not supposed to be strong.
I come undone. Don't even know where to start.
It's like a storm inside my head...
I'ts like a bad storm inside my head... I'm free... Yeah
Existence is futile cause pain is surreal  so real.
I'm free... yeah. Morality is a word i can't accept.
I'm moving in circles.
The hardest things to handle are failure and success.
They are promises worth breaking.
You have to rely on your sanctuary.
You know that you have to.
You have to rely on your mental health.
You know you have to. <start> To the ones that we've forgotten and labelled as insane
In institutions rotting secret mars of family shame
Bound tightly and injected
Subdued by pill regimes
Suspended animation
Pull the rug over the stain
Mistreated and molested
Fed food not fit for pigs
If we're to call them human beings why treat their lives as shit
No chance of contribution to welloiled society
Viewed as manure walking wastes of very air we breathe
Rejected disavowed
Buried beneath our shallow smiles
What do they mean for us and what do they deserve
Four padded walls  their coffins
Underfunded understaffed
In a putrid squalor wallow while the rich and perfect have a laugh
Sons and daughters
Brethren and kin
Sisters and brothers from pictures are trimmed
Out of our sight out of our minds
Where is the kindness on which this world prides
This is the coldest song a voice could ever sing
It's destined to come out wrong
We've done the damnedest things
Oh the humanity
Denial so disgusting
A life shackled rusting
And business is booming
We're vampires and should be ashamed
At birth found unequal
A real living freak show
Throw them in a cell and forget their existence is pain
What a shame
A shrine unto torment
To minds deemed delinquent
Place holding placation
The voiceless damnated can't scream
Can you hear them scream
Mistreated and molested
Fed food not fit for pigs
If we're to call them human beings why treat their lives as shit
No chance of contribution to welloiled society
Viewed as manure walking wastes of very air we breathe
Sons and daughters
Brethren and kin
Sisters and brothers from pictures are trimmed
Out of our sight out of our minds
Where is the kindness in our humankind
This is the coldest song a voice could ever sing
It's destined to come out wrong
We've done the damnedest things
Oh the humanity <start> Screwdriver repeatedly lands in his face
Gouges and hacks at the man of disgrace
Tearing off muscles from the bones of his chest
Rending his flesh with rage I've been blessed
Chopped off the tongue that told the lies
I spit on him and laugh while he dies
Lying there helpless I throw brick at your head
Starving for violence and now I've been fed
His blood drips from my mouth
I bit his larynx out
Biting off fingers when he tried to push me back
His blood drips from my mouth
I bit his larynx out
Biting off fingers when he tried to push me back
Chopping at his face in hate I gouge and hack
Crushing the despised
Under my boot I hear your bones crack
So many things that you want to take back
I won't forget and I won't forgive
Not so long as I allow you to live
Chopped off the tongue that told the lies
I spit on him and laugh while he dies
Lying there helpless I throw brick at your head
Starving for violence and now I've been fed
His blood drips from my mouth
I bit his larynx out
Biting off fingers when he tried to push me back
His blood drips from my mouth
I bit his larynx out
Biting off fingers when he tried to push me back
Chopping at his face in hate I gouge and hack
Crushing the despised <start> I bind us here today we made here a vengeance
tears of the patriarch and the blindness of prophets
silence of impostors the Atheism of confessors
this filth of holy virgins the epiphany of the righteous man
I bind myself today to the powers of Hell
the darkness of the sun and the darkness of the moon
the curingness of fire
the blackness of lightning
the slowness of wind
the shadowness of sea  ability of her
the looseness of rocks
Satan deliver it again
Unto poison
Unto burden
Unto clouded
Unto dead one

AWAITING THE OPENING OF THE ARENA PORTCULLIS
MEMORIES OF REBELLION 
ICENI MESSENGER
Hearken The Ninth Legion has been put to the sword
The warChief of Queen Boudicca Onwards to Camulodunum...
wet your swords Redden the earth with Roman blood
I remember the carnage at Camulodunum...
The glorious clash of Celtic sword against Roman gladius
The pride in the eyes of our warqueen
As we hacked down the Imperial Eagle
And the severed heads of centurions gaping atop our spears.
BLOODSHED AND BATTLE  AD 

We certainly taught the arrogant invading dogs a lesson at any rate.
The omens and portents spoke of vast bloodshed and great carnage
and after our slaughterous victories at Camulodunum  Londinium and Verulanium
the cursed Romans finally dared to meet us honourably upon the field
of war at Mandeussedum. They sent fifteen thousand legionaires
their armour gleaming like gold in the sun... but it would still yield to our
swords and spears no matter how it sparkled.
The Roman scoundrel Governor Suetonius Paullinus
battlescarred from his campaigns against the Druids
was able to choose the ground upon which to make his stand
and so it was that he selected as the battlefield a narrow valley
fronted by a flat plain with dense woodland at its rear. Aye...
Mandeussedum the place of the chariots... I remember it vividly.

We were swelled by our victories
empowered by our noble cause
enraged with the battle frenzy
thirsting to take as many Roman heads
as our bright blades could sever
And yet we were perhaps somewhat overconfident that day...
ABDUCTED FROM THE ICENI
In the aftermath of our defeat at Mandeussedum
I was captured by Romans with a veiled intent...

Nero was growing bored with the gladiators
slaves and lionfodder at his great Circus
and so had requested Suetonius Paullinus
to provide the citizens of Rome with new entertainment...
The Emperor had heard much of the wildness and fighting spirit
of these barbaric Britons who had brought such woe to his farfamed legions
these painted pagan tribesmen who had resisted the Empire's iron fist
where the glorious phalanxes of the East had not.
Agents of the Imperium... hearken to my words Nero had demanded.
Bring to Rome some of these tribesman for the Games. Let us pit them
against our most ravenous beasts and our greatest gladitorial champions.
And so I was taken in fetters aboard a Roman trireme
the blood of slain legionaires still crusted upon my thews
I was taken far from the fens of my beloved homeland
to tread the sun baked sand of the Circus Maximus...
to fight for my life in the Imperial Arena.
ARRIVAL AT THE CIRCUS MAXIMUS
The Circus Maximus was certainly a splendid sight I'll admit.
A vast colosseum with great stone columns and tiers
huge ornate arches and mighty statues of grey marble.
Countless people filled the seats surrounding the sandy floor of the Arena...
and in his opulent royal enclosure flanked by gleaming guards
and grovelling lackeys sat the great Emperor himself...
EMPEROR NERO
Fight barbarian outlander
Please us and mayhap Mars will smile on thee this day
ICENI WARRIOR
Bah I do not hail to your Roman gods and you are not my emperor
By Cernunnos the blood of my enemies shall stain the sand
of this cursed arena red this day
THE COMBAT COMMENCES
They unleashed the lions first. Hunger maddened beasts
goaded into a frenzy by the cruel point of many a pilum...
And yet my own hunger the hunger for revenge was greater
and my honed steel was sharper than bestial fang and claw.
And so they ranged their finest warriors against me.
Three more iron gates around the arena yawned open
and they strode from the colosseum tunnels amidst
a cacophony of cheering from the assembled Roman spectators
urged on and showered with mar tial adulation from the massed
arena crowd who howled their bloodlust without cessation.

Far above upon his great dias
the Emperor gave the signal for the combat to begin
and with the battlelust engulfing me
with the red mist swirling before my eyes
I vowed to my northern gods that I would show these leering
Romans the fighting spirit and battle prowess of my people...
I would leave the arena littered with the bloody corpses of my opponents...
I would cast off the imperial fetters and return to the fens
Aye I would escape and make all Romans fear my name
and compel Nero to rue the day Julius Caesar had first ordered
his legions across the grim grey sea to my ancient island...
Blood For Boudicca... Carnage For Cernunnos
To be continued... <start> You say everything comes if you don't turn your back
And I wait everyday sometimes it's patience I lack
Because it's just more of the same more of the same
And I just need you to remember my name
More of the same more of the same and I just need you
It takes all of me to keep my eyes off of the floor
And this makes tommorow seem harder than ever before
Because it's just more of the same more of the same
And I just need you to remember my name
More of the same more of the same and I just need you to remember my...
Why does this seem to be right in front of me
Intangible dreams we pursue
Why it's so hard to see is eluding me
I can't believe that it's true
More of the same more of the same
And I just need you to remember my name
More of the same more of the same and I just need you. <start> Hilary
Where's the sixty quid you borrowed off me for the gas
I won't give you a kiss
Hilary
Hey Hilary
'New Faces' on Saturday at six
Brought you back to me
Hilary
I'm sure it was you in the new Audi
Outside Sainsbury's
Hilary
Remember when you needed three caps of speed
To get out of bed
And now you're on ecstasy
Hilary
With your daft African pop
And that wine you call bull's blood
Hilary
I thank the lord that you still don't live next to me

A mundus facit nos redire redire ad secessum.

Hear my silent prayer as I weep tonight
Dawn gets greyer thou hast taken flight
Love abandons the soil leaves a shade...
It whispers 'goodbye' as we quietly fade... away
Lacrimae ex oculis meis fluunt
sed crepusculum fletum meum tranquillat.
Please give us wings to fly
Without love our world dies... it dies
To drown in the cold mournful sea...
So lost here in a world not meant to be... for me
The fading moon cries in vain
as the rising sun reflects my pain.
We sail on seas of guilt and shame
but still we feed this lovelost flame... with hope
Hear my silent weeping as I pray tonight...
Night grows colder but I see a new light.
Beautiful night to thee we pray
Let the truest of love come our way
Beautiful night to thee we pray
Let all the illusions just wither away <start> Let the wounded all mourn
They're rotting in the world
Infection and cancer
Are burnt in the world
The sickness is spreading
And threatens to kill
The need for a cure
To reinstall reign
No bound for glory  No small minded sheep
No media whores  No dishonest wimps
No life made of comfort  No ...
No talking for money  No radio waves
No forces of lies  No need to speak
No swolling their egos  just satanic greed
Rebirth of Gorgoroth
Let the wounded all mourn
They're rotting in the world
Infection and cancer
Are burnt in the world
The sickness is spreading
And threatens to kill
The need for a cure
To reinstall reign
The needle of life proudly arise
Leaving behind only he who divines
The music with hate and fear as it's core
Chaos inscribed in every chord
Life and music working impure
Echoes of agony inhuman despair
The gnosis of Satan will leave in the sun
.....knives assures for none
Sorry they're not quite finished but that
should be a good start for you <start> Written  composed by Andy Janssens  Kate Ryan
Hailstorms covering the morning sky
Your ambiguous words floating through my mind
Your heart is burning but you hide the love inside
My head is like a whirlwind turning
I need some clarity in my life
Chorus
'Cause we belong together
Pounding hearts forever
Open your eyes and u will see
That we belong together
Fearless love forever
Diving in a new world u and me
Heeooheeooeeoo
A helpless feeling in my life
Sleepless moments moments I have cried
My heart is burning
But from me you cannot hide
My head is like a whirlwind turning
You are the essence of my life
Chorus
We belong together
Pounding hearts forever
Open your eyes and u will see
Heeooheeooeeoo <start> From the gloving fragments of what remains
The soul shall rise from amongst the flames
From smouldering ruins the power grows
Feel the pulse of fear as we regain control.
From the ashes of a million dead
The children of tomorrow now are led.
Into the darkness as emotions slowly
Memories of the past cannot be saved.
Bowing down to face your new found life
There is no escape you must comply
This resurrected hate can't be denied.
Asking for redemption  we laugh and look away
There shall be no exception  Revenger on man begins today.
You thought that is was all over But its only just begun
For your life is mortal Look to what fate will become.
Learn to live afraid of what may be
For we possess this world  All that you see
Your life is no more than a game to me.
Visions of the future reflected in the past
Existing in the present which surely cannot last.
From the void terror takes its hold
Face the wrath as history unfolds. <start> Streets dawn with empty light.
Bullets clutter the sidewalk.
The gun trembles in a young man's hand.
The mother visits a grave site.
They ask why we suffer.
Oh God please answer.
Rivers run mountains peak.
We all remain scared.
I try to remember
You and me together.
Rivers run mountains peak.
We all remain scared.
It's so abrupt
The life designed for us.
Reach out end fear.
Reach out end fear.
They ask why we suffer.
Oh God please answer.
Rivers run mountains peak.
We remain scared.
The city mourns another loss.
But we'll pray forever.
Rivers run mountains peak.
I know You're there. <start> I see darkness everywhere
In these icy wall of stone
All i can do is sit and stare
I could not feel more alone
I'm your prisoner but beware
You can laugh there from your throne
As long as i will breathe the air
I'm a danger for what you own
My brothers far from here
When they will hear my call
You will all shiver with fear
And you'll see your kingdom fall
Wind Oh Wind
Carry my words away
To the lands where druids and i belong
Wind Oh Wind
I implore you today
Make my brothers of the earth hear my song
No walls can break my will
No darkness no fear no pain
For freedom I would kill
But there is more to gain
My brothers far from here
When they will hear my call
You will all shiver with fear
And you'll see your kingdom fall
Wind Oh Wind... <start> At dawn's first light
Run for your lives
Viking ships come out of the mist
Ominous sight
Flee or stand fast
You won't last
Warlords invade with axe and blade
Attack at first light
Unstoppable force
No remorse
Under attack no turning back
You cannot run
Nowhere to hide
No shelter inside
Under attack no turning back
Slaughter's begun
Nowhere to hid
No shelter inside
Slashing killing
Thrashing spilling
Blood for honor death and glory
Out of the night
At dawn's first light
Longships arrive
Run for your lives
Wounds won't mend your bitter end
Death to all
Flee or fight
No one survives
Bloodshed won't stop
'Til the last drop
You will fall
It matters not how hard you fought
Under attack no turning back
You cannot run
Nowhere to hide
No shelter inside
Under attack no turning back
Slaughter's begun
Nowhere to hid
No shelter inside
Slashing killing
Thrashing spilling
Blood for honor death and glory
The ships bring terror to these shores
Death and all out war
Their oars are cutting through the waves
Like spades are digging graves
At dawn's first light
Run for your lives
Out of the night
At dawn's first light
Longships arrive
Run for your lives <start> Music  Lyrics by Eviga

Mit einem purpurroten Leichenkarren wollen  Tote in die Kreisstadt fahren.

Die Fchen scheppern laut und rein der Russe sauft den deutschen Wein.
Vor mir hockt der Jonathan er starb in einer Kegelbahn...
und liebte eine Jdin gar als er noch quietschlebendig war.
Daneben sitzt der Kinderzar der war ein frischer Brettspielnarr.
Er birgt die Knute in der Hand und spielte Schach im ganzen Land.

BOVINE <start> Alive among the lifeless
How many of us still survive
Stranded in this hell
Cursed by the walking dead
There's not much time left now
The sun has already begun to set
Time to board up the windows and doors
It'll be dark in half an hour
Rising from forgotten graves
The dead returning to life
The corpse walks
Never to be killed again
Bony fingers covered in moldy flesh
It's got you by the neck
A look of hunger in dead eyes
Broken teeth sink into your throat
Too late you saw it too late
Your flesh a feast for fiends
The body scattered on the ground
Blood soaked into gravelly earth
The streets are now empty
I watch the dead as they begin to feed <start> A question has come to my mind
Why do I keep asking myself
Where are you heading like a tumbleweed
Like a rock that falls down the cliff
You are wasting everything
I find it hard to believe but youll always have a chance to turn over a new leaf
Were stuck between our desires
Were taking hold of ourselves
But maybe thats not the key
Thats simply another deadlock
Another delusion
We fucked up
What if were doomed
Whaaaaaaaaat
The outcome is close
It will show you the truth
I know that sucks to be kept in the dark
Were taking hold of ourselves
But maybe thats not the key
Thats simply another deadlock
Another delusion
We are free
We are free to choose and believe in what we want to believe
And hope that we have one more endeavour  <start> LEAD INTRODUCTION  NORGEST

First I'll tear asunder thy mortal garments unmasking your pale delicate

It's an illusion just the devil's trickery
Meant to deceive us to lead us on
To break us down until the will to live is gone
Never move heart
Only death stands between this life and the ever after
Nothing to fear there's no end and there is no final chapter
Feel no pain
The stars have fallen out of the sky
Pay no attention to the devil's evil eye
Meant to distract us lead us astray
To throw us off our course until we've lost the way
Never move heart
Only death stands between this life and the ever after
Nothing to fear there's no end and there is no final chapter
Feel no pain
Time drifts on past is gone
Won't be long must be strong
When the time has come to say goodbye
To all the ones we love
We shall not fear our fate or destiny
The Gods have spoken thy will be done
Foretell the future of thy kingdom that will come
Still we ride onward on wings of black
Long as we live there'll be no end to our attack
Never move heart
Only death stands between this life and the ever after
Nothing to fear there's no end and there is no final chapter
Feel no pain <start> I'm on top of the world
And I see
The pain from a thousand generations to be
Like lambs to the slaughter
Never free
Echoes of fear swirling around me
I'm on top of the world
And I see
The souls from the millions
That will never be free
Caged in their bodies
Down on their knees
Black clouds of fear swirling around me
Suffer forty shades of red
Suffer forty shades of black
Suffer forty shades of red
Suffer forty shades of black

Ad finem temporum <start> The walls of a poem like the foldin' of wings
They burn through the base of the skull
Under the eyelids the night eternal
Down fell the city of words
The blackness throbbin'
Foul  unrestrained
Under the seafloor
Against the white sand
Where the land has been drinkin'
All our blood  regret
Our words are like quicksand
Against the endless sky
The poisonous darkness
In solid silence
Like rivers of ice
We burn like blindin' fires
In the void of my spirit
Deep in the lungs of Hell to sink like lead
In the void of my spirit
Deep in the lungs of hell
Traceless through the air <start> 
Innocent individuals... concerned about nothing but happiness... progress becomes easy to do this social situation. Unfortunate turn of events... collapse this idea of the childish thought.
No judgment towards one another no social status to compare... all as one ...market this change... exploit the idea of innocence... goddamn television god... corrupt me... separate us... groups of difference seem to comfort what we didn't think of... this show was in their head for years... enjoy this life of wonder and imagination... for it will be torn down.
You will be torn down...
time to hate kill fuck conquer...
this is human life at its best... we'll televise this event...
you can learn how to live breathe... then finally die. <start> How do you look into the mirror
When you're too tired to fake a smile
Your misery won't make you look thinner
Reality is bitter
It's your hand and yours alone that has opened
The door to let their voice in
Into your head under your skin
Fix your face or you will never fit in
Do you want me do you want me
To burst your bubble now
Do you want me I will break it
Make it loud

Do you want me do you want me
To break the paradigm
These rules were made by us
They break you up inside
And then will break in down
Army of dolls stole your reflection
Army of dolls stole all your perfect imperfections
Just shut them out don't let them in
Into your head
Do you really think
Misery tastes so much sweeter
Served with perfect smile
Do you want me do you want me
To burst your bubble now
Do you want me I will break it
Make it loud

Do you want me do you want me
To break the paradigm
These rules were made by us
They break you up inside
And then will break in down
Don't you look into the mirror
Army of dolls made you so bitter
Makeup magpul follow the leader
Never have seen a face much sweeter
Don't you look into the mirror
Army of dolls made you so bitter
Makeup magpul follow the leader
Never have seen a face much sweeter
Do you want me do you want me
To burst your bubble now
Do you want me I will break it
Make it loud

Do you want me do you want me
To break the paradigm
These rules were made by us
They break you up inside
And then will break in down <start> So adept was unspoken man
At dusting ledgers of the seraphim
That Lilith swept across the broken land
In a whirl of lust to pleasure him
This bland Adam a reaper of the sun
In bone dry season for Eve was busy sucking thumbs
Pricked in rosy gardens as he spattered into shells
And ran with morning fauna his mastiffs and gazelle
Breathless as the wind Adam prowled fell foul to sin
But not before she spread her grin across his silent lips
At crack of day though what was shame
The raptor's nest wherein they lay
Bore witness to her soft parade of fingers come to grips
His undivine attention won she deftly spun
From 'neath his thrusts to writhe above in ecstasy
Pendulous she swung as if her limbs imbibed his tongue
To spill as with his rod the secret name of God
But no seed passed those fruitful lips

For fearing her who grasped he slit

Her throat from ear to where she fled

With tail and blood between her legs
Paradise paradise paradise
So very kept was the virgin hand
That brushed the treasures of Utopia
And how the greed swept across the desert sands
In late August just to measure her
This hallowed Eve a creature of the moon
A simple dish born with a silver spoon
Giddy sniffing orchids that opened after dusk
Incubus and prudence two such swoon to touch her
Restless as the skies temptation bloomed found room to rise
And snatching breaths between her thighs he crawled to Eve
At dead of night the sticky clime smelt perfect to this serpentine
This shining angel palled in mysteries
Her undivine attention won he deftly spun
A web of for the one great sacred tree
Bejeweled and lit as if a thousand shades did flit
About boughs of forbidden lore hidden for the want of more
And when seeds passed those fruitful lips

And mankind basked in vast eclipse

A devil shot of thin disguise

Surmised to better paradise
It's paradise paradise paradise
Paradise paradise paradise <start> This nonappliance sound

I draw strength from watching you never give up you see it through. That is how i live my life courage to be. Scared screaming helpless as i watched over idly. Blood pumping from the wounds i stared down breathlessly. Frozen in time in disbelief of what went on.

Frozen tears from above

A casket filled with beloved flesh
Cold as the world around

Through clouds of icy breath
No bird sings in dead trees
No sound fills the frozen air
I stand at the angel's tomb alone
A whole world ending to exist
Mirrors of mourning nothing else
Blinded by grief they are everyone

Give me your smile
with tears in your face
Lead me out
of the dark into the light
You let me feel your warmth
You touch me intimately
You look behind my mask
You get under my skin
Tell me
Do you see me do you feel me
Where do you live do you understand
What are you looking for
Why do you love me
Why do you lie in my arms
Come on say it already
Why do you love me
Why do you remain on my side
Come on tell me
why don't you go
Close your eyes
Tell me what you feel
I have no more fear
when I know
that you're leading me
You cover me up
tenderly with yourself
without a sound
You bury yourself deep within me
You get under my skin
Why do you love me
Why do you lie in my arms
Come on say it already
Why do you love me
Why do you remain on my side
Come on tell me
Why you still love me
now like on the first day
Why you forgive of all my sins
Why you still understand me
I know that you still
believe in me
I don't know why you still trust me
Tell me why you don't go
Say why you love me
Why do you still believe in me
Say why you need me

Step into five fold mace
As son as father in a frame

Things that no one hears
Cry now cry now for me again
Tomorrows pride and pain
Why you kneel before my name
Crushing my belief
And make shape to my relief
For who you set your prayers
I can't hear them anyway
Someday fire wipes the rain
Fears are frozen tears whisper
Things that no one heras
Cry now cry now for me again
Tomorrows pride and pain

wearing a charm
made of bones
come here to stare

where the nightfall waits
in a jaded trance

nothing less than soul search
and hear my words to feel
what I believe
what I've learned

in a crimson dance
lying paralysed as I wonder
lying mesmerised as I tremble

He lures them to their death
Morbid thoughts fill twisted mind
A crave for tearing flesh
Friendly face a lollipop
He traps them after school
Flat chested pretty six year old
The type that makes him drool
Lubricates his vile tool
Child tied to the bed
Rams his rod the pelvis snaps
Sheets stained brown and red
Frustration tears his mind apart
The pain in his brain making him insane
His tool shed hosts a magnitude of corpses
Torn and scattered
Bloodied meat strewn on the floor
From bodies slashed and tattered
Sickened brain repulsive lusts
Feeble bodies torn apart
Finger paints with body fluids
Disgusting abstract art
Stark staring mad
Reenacting horrid dreams
Horrors of his mind made reality
More than flesh and blood can bear
Raging uncontrolled
Feeble heartbeat drifts away
Corpse lies still and cold <start> WOKE UP IN THE EARLY MORNING

YOU WILL JOIN OUR GOD <start> Silence is a frustrating answer when all you
want is a sign. It's hard to be surrounded by
the ones that you love when they keep passing
you by. Beneath the tough facade I know that
we are getting through. None of us are ready
to just remember you. Whenever you are lost
I know that we can find you standing outside
screaming at the sky. Don't let the tears of
agony consume your heart. Let it beat on in
hopes and dreams of a new start. No one
knows the weight on your shoulders. No one
knows the burdens you bare. These thoughts
won't stop. It'd be so easy to take the easy
way out. Compassion is a beautiful thing so
show some for yourself. Rock solid from the
outside looking in. Inside you're praying for
help. You're praying for help. It's hard to be
surrounded by the ones that you love when
they keep passing you by. Beneath the tough
facade I know that we're getting through. Life
is a gift. Remember that. Break free. I know
silence is a hard answer when all you want is a
sign. Patience is a virtue. You will be revived. <start> We are primordial sound
Outward and in omnidirectional
We are existence
Salvage the mother sun
Destroy the rift
Bring knowledge back to light
Our vision's detrimental to progressing
Now rise

Moving backward towards the centre sun
Rooted in intuition
We are the language

Sword of power <start> She met her in an ordinary bar
Having the same blue drink and smiling as she turned to her
She had this feeling that they'd met before
She felt she knew this girl and wished to know her even more
She was always on her mind always always there
In and outside all the time and everywhere
She was always in her head always  everywhere
Only sometimes in her bed but always there
Shalalalalalalalalalalala Shalalalalalalalalala
She seemed to stare at her and slightly smile
She was not beautiful but special so she returned her smile
The girl came over asked her for her name
She kissed her once or twice and then she disappeared again
She was always on her mind always always there
In and outside all the time  everywhere
She was always in her head always always  everywhere
Only sometimes in her bed but always there
Shalalalalalalalalalalala Shalalalalalalalalala <start> Satan represents indulgence instead of abstinence <start> In his eyes
The evil spirit rise
Turns to darkness with Satan's name
As the time is right
Dead bodies rise up from their graves
And when the time comes near
Oh I see the prince of glory
Holy month
Sacred hounds
Under the hill
Do you hear their call <start> And still there comes another sunrise again
Clouded by the shades of yesterday
Still I feel naivet's hope for change
Memories endured memory remains
Peel the skin off this walking corpse
Fingernails scrape the skin from off my back
When the pain you feel is deliberate masochistic and integral
And all you know is you lived it fought it but you gave up hope
Never let your pain get in the way
You told me I'd feel no pain
You can always count on it
Not thinking about it
Will never take away
Take away my pain
Feel the things that make your heart turn gray
I wear mine proudly on my sleeve
When all you taste is your own blood filing up your mouth and throat
Thought it didn't taste good you refused to let it make you choke
I've become so much stronger since I've embraced my pain
You can always count on it
Can you live with it
Once you learn to live with it
Nothing can ever take it away
You can count on
You can depend on
You can take from
I'm so proud of my pain <start> Put them in the jars
Stomach will not turn
Waste raw factory matter
Chewed instead of burned
This is rage
Usable resources
The trains will run on time
With coal of placenta
Food of the gods of the mind
This is rage
Toothpick bones in the goo
Eggshell cranium blue
What you eat you were
There is no place for tears
After all that's been cheered
What you eat you were
Pain or no pain
There is a face and name
What you eat you were
The imagery has been played with
Nonpoints wellmade
Illustrating lack of purpose
Win by denying the game
It will take landing in back yards
And stomachs being cut open
And questionnaires filled out
At one's own dying moment <start> I love necrophilia
Slice the rotten flesh
Suck on the entrails
The sweet scent of death
Ripping back the meat
And fucking whats within
You shit as I fuck
And I cum with a grin <start> The cold winds of war numb the nations soul
They taste the bitter fear as a grim future appears
Criminal leaders building hate
Under siege the world segregates
The day has come the end is at hand
The earth a corpse a barren waste land
Cower in fear humanity prays
Blood upon our final days
No god can grant any salvation
There's no escaping incineration
Bound and tortured heads kicked in
Children slaughtered heads kicked in
Nations ruptured heads kicked in
Lives aborted heads kicked in
In this world terror reigns supreme
The earth a carcass with its bones picked clean
Inpending doom too little too late
Clenched inside the fist of fate
With savage bloodlust we feed on the kill
Self destruction our only true skill
Will our children ever get a clean slate
Barbaric society united in hate
The charred remains of war machines
The lifeless twisted bodies
Blind eyes that peer from their heads
The crowded carraiges of the dead <start> Es aendert sich alles
How everything changes
Nichts woran man glauben kann
Nothing in which we can trust
Keinen Halt und heine Helfer
No hold and no more helpers
Etwas wirft uns aus der Bahn.
We have to leave the course so just.
Wo sind die neuen Helden
Where are the modern heroes
Wer sind die neuen Helden.
Who are the modern heroes. <start> Inbossom my head forth lead me into silent poetry
Wretchedness leaves my eyes desired
As labouring claims those golden hairs
Come appetise my tongue to heavenly moistures
Do lend a breast to gaze upon
Have in summers past all pleasures
Or be them winded in my forehead 
Sleepless 
Make thyself aroused to a flood of tears
In streaks of day when owls do cry
And fables tread the primrose path
All that bares in fruit
Sits under the bough that blossoms
Coral lips with a pleasing tale
Touches as a flower with frost
Have like twenty kisses and bide where the billows spoke
Harrow me up with glutton lips make good the yeast
Endeaver thyself as a whore
Then I'll take towards no pity
O sweet dames like infants of the spring <start> Neutralized area
Bright white glow
No smell no sound
No soul
Sterile environment
Immaculate death <start> White coats to bind me out of control
I live alone inside my mind
World of confusion air filled with noise
Who says that my life's such a crime
Trapped in this nightmare
I wish I'd wake
As my whole life begins to shake
Four walls surround me
An empty gaze
I can't find my way out of this maze
'Cause I don't care
Fall in fall out
Gone without a doubt help me
I can't take the blame
They don't feel the shame
It's a madhouse
Or so they claim
It's a madhouse
Oh am I insane <start> Tells the legend there's a magic place
That could nobody find its trace
Land of darkness land of forlorn songs
Where all is mystic all along

Where I am Lost in the stream
Is it real or a dream
My stunned mind listens to a call
Like a spirit into crystal ball
But in depth I see a gleam
Fearful I'll follow the beam
With the shadows I will brawl
So I will arrive to the light hall
Dark Moor Dark Moor
Welcome to the Dark Moor
Dark Moor Dark Moor
Welcome to the Hall

Who comes in the Hall of Olden Dreams

I listen to a voice in my head

Speak And then I just could deem

I don't know why I am here

I read in your fate

Choose your goodness Choose your badness

You must cross the gate

It is too late

Yes I obey the command
Find the gate in Shadowland
If my destiny it wrote
Only the trust wants it to denore
Dark Moor Dark Moor
Welcome to the Dark Moor
City of the dreams where is its gateway
Dark Moor Dark Moor
Welcome to the Dark Moor
Among gothic gargoyles always the Art stays
Dark Moor Dark Moor
Welcome to the Dark Moor
Sleeping in the darkness there's a light
Dark Moor Dark Moor
Welcome to the Dark Moor
Bathing like moon in the silent night

Care with the nice evil lies
Because the greed never dies
Care with the sweet false promise
Which proclaims the paradise

Don't listen to it's false word
Moreover don't fight with it's bejewelled sword
And ever don't play in its black rich board
Remember

Who's there in the dark

I'm who keeps the ark

Why do you talk me

Your friend I could be

Why'll I trust in you

It would be a good view

Move away With your false hopes

Your illusions are your slope

You don't try to cross my way

Riches you can not slay

Perhaps I cannot win
Nor a new world begin
But now and ever in my heart the Art will be my sin
Dark Moor Dark Moor
Welcome to the Dark Moor
Sleeping in the darkness there's a light
Dark Moor Dark Moor
Welcome to the Dark Moor
Bathing like moon in the silent night

I can see
In my soul
The gate's before me
Mystery's real
My destiny

You won't free

Let me go

You can't flee

No
I am falling slow

Then I crossed the Gates of Oblivion
In the dark moor my spirit could fly
I am glad about my decision
As my word could always testify
With the Muses I danced in the night
Beneath the full Moon I felt the Spell
And its poetry gave me its fine old bite
And I could never say farewell
And the music in my heart
Filled my illusions with the Art
And the angels showed me
Which is the way of the stars

Like a dream immortal
You crossed the dark Portal
You will be blasphemer deemer dreamer
This is the gift of the Gods
Which for men will be odd
This is the dream of the demons who envy it

Oh In the end of time
Muses teach me that I'm
Who choose my truth forever
Oh Spirit of the Art
If my soul must depart
My mind will stay with you

Poet of the dark glance
In your eyes a romance
With it I dance
Musician of the dreams

My inspiration will be
All the strength of my destiny
I wake up and my throat screams
Was it real or a dream
But why's tears there in my eyes <start> One more attempt to trick my mind
Sending me a creature able to
to hamper my own life my project
I firmly think now he's behind
this conspiracy but he's too weak
Forever I'll resist against him
What d'you wanna do the next time
Whom you wanna send me again
Woman just a black rose
This has been your role
that brought you to fall
Let me say weren't wise
It's impossible you know
For your lord to rise
Oh my dear enemy you know
What I just did to your sweet white rose
Died trying to make me fall in love
I found her just one month ago
Suffering and begging in a hole
To be saved and to be nursed
What d'you wanna do the next time
Whom you wanna send me again
Woman just a black rose
This has been your role
that brought you to fall
Let me say weren't wise
It's impossible you know
For your lord to rise
You'll never trick me no way have to rise
And to discover it look in my eyes
Woman just a black rose
This has been your role
that brought you to fall
Let me say weren't wise
It's impossible you know
For your lord to rise <start> My mind has been building worlds
Where as a king I reign or lay in slavery
I take the dust of Gods
To hold the divine sand
To see a world in a grain of sand
And heaven in a wild flower
Hold infinity in the palm of your hand
And eternty in an hour
W. Blake
The mind is its own place and itself
Can make a heaven o hell a hell of heaven
J. Milton
Lost in a dream
I wander in my Realms
I don't want awake
Forever in this place
I don't want awake
From a distant landscape
Forsaken in this space hidden by the fog
I can fly away dreaming of my kingdom
Lost in my dreams
I wander in my Realms
Forsaken...
My mind has been building worlds
Where as a king I reign
I'll take the sand of Gods
Or lay in slavery
To see a world in a grain of sand
And heaven in a wild flower
Hold infinity in the palm of your hand
And eternty in an hour
W. Blake <start> The sun has set beyond the western sky
And with the coming night I hear 'em cry
From the fear they were overrun
From the hurricane they were spun
The candle has lost its flame
'cause they play the final game
Out from the dust they danced apart from all
All warnings overheard until they call
The storm has turned the tides
All is changing from left to right
The gloom it came over them
Again and again
Chorus
As we stand here in vain we're awaiting soon
The falling twilight of midnight at noon
There's no sun to see there's only one moon
'cause it's midnight at noon
The sun has set beyond the western sky
And with the coming night I hear 'em cry
From the fear they were overrun
From the hurricane they were spun
The candle has lost its flame
'cause they play the final game
Chorus <start> Forward on Just go on
Directionless rush for close by before
Species specificmotion
No change for equilibriumstop
Fetid persistent stench of the race
Rushes in every slot
Sticking all together into a mass
I hate you
I hate us
You know what I mean Fuck off
This world stigma cries out on your forehead
Antigod prepares your own personal void
The only way to equilibrium
Kill yourself But... <start> Masters are relentless torture is for slaves
Money greed and power drives you to obey
Temperature is rising shakes me to the core
Blood and domination victims of the law
When bloody angels spread their wings
We're drowning in madness the heart of the Unicorn...
Dwelling in sadness the heart of the Unicorn...
...is dead
I see the demons rising beyond their sleeping void
Deep and down the masters take them to the light
Their piercing rays are blazing obliterating fast
All dreams are torn to pieces vaporized at last
When bloody angels spread their wings
We're drowning in madness the heart of the Unicorn...
Dwelling in sadness the heart of the Unicorn...
...is dead
I scan the dead horizon illuminated curse
In squished imagination catastrophies unfurl
Beyond the cataclysm a dream of Unicorns
The purest heart in heaven stabbed by poisoned thorns
Bloody angels searing with fireturn to dust
All through the millenniums I've seen the writing on the wall
Into our oblivion we are the riders on the storm
We're drowning in madness the heart of the Unicorn...
Dwelling in sadness the heart of the Unicorn...
...is dead
Beware  all dead
No light  all dead
No dreams  all dead
No life  you're dead <start> Tongue Tied
Dead Inside
Nothing Left
Not Even Pride
This Isn't How I Thought The Future Would Go
Hell Bent
Soul Is Spent
Nothing left But To Repent
I've Gotta Dig Myself Back Out Of This Hole
This Isn't My Fight
This Is My War  War 
I've Never Wanted Anything More

This Is My War  War 
Everything I Love I'm Fighting For

This Is My War
Crazy Eyed
Certified
Nothing Left But Shit Inside
Nobody Said This Would Be Easy To Do
Drying Out
Crying Out
Nothing Left But Pain And Doubt
I Would Be Lying If I Said It's For You
This Isn't My Fight
This Is My War  War 
I've Never Wanted Anything More

This Is My War  War 
Everything I Love I'm Fighting For

This Is My War

This Is My War  War 
Everything I Love I've Foughten For

This Is My
This Is My War <start> Break up the tide that makes you whole
Break up the mind the heart the soul
I wish I could take a stronger stand
Look up to the one who is more than grand...i bow
For my faith and trail of life
Unbarrallelled your sacrifice
Like every father and son in bloodline we are as one
When the darkness comes still child inside will chase the sun
I reach the stars above and know you never let me fall
Every failure and fault increases the cross I bear
Deep inside the demons feast on me and tear
Into pieces everything and in my ear
I hear your words unspoken and they will cease the fear...in me <start> Bonus Track <start> I saw them dancing in the streets
An innocent play with aclors unknowing
Celebrating this ancient pagan feast
Unleashing my spirit. The shadows are growing
Im weaving their songs to spells once forgotten
And the pictures in their minds to seals that was broken
Sing my hymns and read my invocations
I'm the unexpected guest. I accept your invitation
And alone in her bed
The virgin lies dreaming
The visions in her mind
Wakes her up screaming
The seed is sown
The shadows are growing
The dance goes on
With actors unknowing
The night is young it has merely begun
My waiting is over my time has come <start> Bendita obsesin
Me obliga a avanzar
Me obliga a estar despierto
Si existe una razn
Por la que continuar
Si existe una razn
Por la que avanzar
Esa es servir sufrir y caminar
Planto cara al viento
Clavo mis pies al suelo
Miro al firmamento
Mi vida por un sueo
Un paso ms
Tras la verdad
Slo uno ms
Por mi ideal
Difcil eleccin
Remar sin rumbo ni timn
O contemplar el cielo
Si hoy tengo tempestad
Maana calma habr
Mi voluntad luchar
Mas sufrir igual
Pues eleg remar hasta el final
Siento el aliento
De la muerte tras de m
Sigo vivo por dentro
Con fuerzas para seguir <start> It started as a child
When I first sought to flirt with fate
I'd lay next to the tracks with arms outstretched across the rails
Daydreaming fantasizing of sparks and screeching brakes
The plumes of bright red gushing iridescent in the sun
Adopt a life of struggle
One down three more to go
Desire amputation
Leave me writhing in the limbless throes
It is deficiency I crave
I want so to be helpless
To inferiority a slave
A clump of breathing flesh
Free from extremity
Now replete with nothing left
Disassemble me
Limb from limb oh what a treat
No more feeling incomplete nor encumbered by this lie
My prayer is for calamity
Merciful blades to sever me
Crippling
Detruncating
Immobile by design
Majestic ancient titan
Swims proudly in its tank
I wish to slake its hunger
Flailing my legs as bait
I finally feel complete. I am now whole.
Superfluous gesture
An unnecessary art
Sacrificial offering
Unto the gilded saw
Rid me of my shame
Of what I've overachieved
My envy is the handicapped
Lord I beg of you I plead
I plead
Wheelchairs prosthetics crutches
All stimulus to me
My love beyond mere fetish
Call it disabling
I'd waltz upon a landmine
Feed digits to machines
Phantom limb masturbation
The only way
Dissemble me
Limb from limb oh what a treat
No more feeling incomplete nor encumbered by this lie
My prayer is for calamity
Merciful blades to sever me
Crippling
Detruncating
Immobile by design
Disassemble me
Piece by piece a loving feat
Body image incomplete corrected by a knife
My hope is for catastrophe
A gangrenous limbdectomy
Dismantling
Dismembering
Cut down to perfect size <start> Twisted intention
Lucifer the highest angel
Wanting to overthrone God
No impurity tolerated in God's presence
Like a lightning
Falling down to earth
With his angels now appearing
As pathetic demons of hell
Sly and malicious
Filling man with lies
Greed and perversity
He loves to watch you die
Beware of the vicious serpent
Suffocating the world with poisonous hands
Intoxication of twisted views
On Christianity and the Lamb of God
He knows where you're weak
And tries his best to make you fall
Endless attempts well aware
That he failed two thousand years ago
I'm washed in the blood of Jesus Christ
I'm holy justified by the Lamb of God
Mercy was given undeservedly
The blood was shed the pain endured <start> I know that someday as the light
Blur on my soul
will switch off.
You'll never know how much does your Gaze means for me
Touch of your hand. The whisper of the heart
Passing moments when I
Felt your breath
Whisper of the heart.
You'll never know
How many of a pain
How many of the suffering
Man can stand.
The limits are like an air
Loosin' the pride he's loosin' face.
I cannot feel anything apart of a reality
Tight as the cage of sad
I'm unable to hate
Unable to hate 'couse I...
Where the birds fly
Where the day wakes up
Where the smell of buyin' tomorrow
From traders of the dreams he was sittin'. <start> see you in hell my love
under a palm tree
sucking from a bamboo straw
patiently waiting for me
all night and everyday
i'm in a galaxy far far away

alien skies raining stars

i was crawling in your skin
bathing in your blood
and everything you are
take me to the time
we walked the long way home
through a forest full of wolves
where lovers come to die
what a day to die
all night and everyday
i'm in a galaxy far far away

Strangers From the Distant West Explored the Crypts
Buried for Years under Silent Stone
They Beheld a Netherworld never Seen in a Mortals Eye
A Place meant to be Unentered for Eternity
Here where the Days were Nights and the Nights were Magic Nights
Great Grandious Legends had their throne in these Shadowhalls
Once there were Spirits Lurking like Serpent Tounges
Mist and Dust were now the Kings in this Deathsleep Cavern
The Strangers Hungry Eyes Caught the Portal to the Shrine
Unlocked the Hidden Wrath of Dimensional Deathworlds
The Crypts Descended deeply Down to Ashes under Ground
But the Sphere Raged over Landscapes towards a Castle unknown... <start> Natens myrkr lyses op af manens sorghsna skipilse

Go past the stations and the bars.
Never stop to get out
In case they choose to cruise about.
Well I tell you that boy
He stopped up at the station.
He must be on a mission of passion
Couldn't make out whether he was from
Salford or...ah... Manchester.
And this London visitor had this to say
Cheater
Cheetham Hill.
Only way you stop is for passion at the station.
Why you cruising To be unfaithful.
You want to settle up you want to settle down.
And some man really hurt you.
He isn't around in Cheetham.
You cheated.
Well I tell you
That boy he stopped up at the station.
He must be on a mission of passion.
Cheater.
Cheetham Hill.
Where you going boy Are you cheatin'
Is that why you come from Cheetham Hill
When you stopped up at the station
Was it an excuse to get away from your wife for the evening
Couldn't make out whether he was from

Salford or...ah...Manchester

And this London visitor had this to say
Cheater
Cheetham


And the boy stopped up
At the passion wagon
We couldn't make out where he was from
Salford or Manchester
And this London visitor had this to say <start> Your fears of impending doubt
Your course of action follows reaction
Instinct greed lust sublime
All motivating all progressive
Stand your ground
But will you face the truth <start> What kind of race lack of direction
Just how lunatic to have a nature so deceit
Bewail my reverie a gambol untried
Lure of carnality and silence in forfeit
Animals enslaved to pearls of fictionalized worth
Creatures born from caves into simulated mirth
I'm talking Idols of Chagrin
Born of possession complacement in disguise
Craving and candid as to defy the character's fall
The kisses you drain pedestrian pedigree
What's thought is pain might be desire after all <start> It's not over yet  Consuming flames of the faceless one
There's no time to repent  As you bow before the serpent god
There is no turning back  Festering demons to hatred sworn
And ready to attack  The jaws of death are hungry like a war
Songs of death shall kill the lies forever and ever
Baptized burning  Cold flames will purify my soul
Our hearts are rotten to the core
Behead the prophets  Their skulls  Trophies in the final war
The plague of man  Crowned in terror  Hate and soulless might
It's not over yet  Racing down these deadend streets
There's no time to repent  Festering demons to hatred sworn
What we have sown  Is ours to reap
Songs of death shall kill the lies forever and ever
Baptized burning  Cold flames will purify my soul
Our hearts are rotten to the core
Behead the prophets  Their skulls  Trophies in the final war
The plague of man  Crowned in terror  Hate and soulless might
As we watch the angels die
In the lake of sulphur  We'll watch 'em drown
A massacre divine
Blasphemous locust in genocide reborn
The beating of your heart
Echoing in silence  The sound of death
As your soul is torn apart
A violent cry of pain  Riding your final breath
It's not over yet  Consuming flames of the faceless one
There's no time to repent  As you bow before the serpent god
There is no turning back  Festering demons to hatred sworn
And ready to attack  The jaws of death are hungry like a war
Songs of death shall kill the lies forever and ever
Baptized burning  Cold flames will purify my soul
Our hearts are rotten to the core
Behead the prophets  Their skulls  Trophies in the final war
The plague of man  Crowned in terror  Hate and soulless might <start> Oh I'm that sick I see it that way
I'd rather be dead then have you stay
You pretend that it's OK
Right now it's my time to take
Feeding off my hate today
Feeding off the lives I waste
Now it's time to change my ways
Now it's time to erase my name
Can't see my face
You can't see my face now
Pass out of existence
Gone
Disgusted by your presence now
I wonder what it would be like if you were down
Could you cope Could you really cope
Could you hope Or would you sit and wait for me
Seeking for my placement now
Now it's time to change my ways
Now it's time to erase my name
Can't see my face
You can't see my face now
Pass out of existence
When I close my eyes
I see myself dead
I know you want it this way don't you
When I close my eyes
I see myself
Dead gone now <start> You haven't found it yet
Haven't found it yet.
Look at the glass turn your head
You haven't found it yet.
Moving down the lane inside
It's flashy Camden Town
It's that London lyric again
You haven't found it yet.
Impulses crowd your head
Too much to be absorbed
You're into the top shackle
Mental sawdown of your head
Which bemoans a simple fact.
You haven't found it yet.
It seemed so clear in bed
It's dark but your legs they are dead
Your pen is entombed in mattress
You're not going to get it yet
You haven't found it yet
You're dying but still warm
Put this writing on your tomb
Spit out with dying breath
You haven't found it yet.

Dear Cousin
It's destiny.
The grist that curtails the mill
Shall make us strong <start> 
Hated... time and time again
Force fed suppress senseless fear of difference
True self suppression hollow dreams of misery
Blind wish to see
Indifference to be
Freedom expressionless bouts of legislation
True self repression take a stance of fall to your needs
Corrupt in the system
Laws bent to other needs
God fearing idiocy
Ignore just pleas
Blind wish to see
Indifference to be
Concrete hypocrisy
Weigh heavily
Idiosyncrasy
Ruling powers be
Idiosyncrasy
Never really free <start> My world around me
Lies down so cold and bare
I'm a stranger in this emptiness
Close to deep despair
Where are the sun rays
That light my barren soul
Hear my silent
Cry
At the end of the sunset the night is closing in
I'm prayin' to the queen of the moon
Send me an angel on my way to the sea of tears
Be the path of my destiny
If the quest lasts forever
Out there in the void
Bring the eyes of creation
Back to my world
I'm your master master of the night
Evil Pastor devil in disguise
Save us save us guardian of the light
Save us save us lead us home tonight
I'm the master master of the night
Evil laughter death personified
Save us save us be our guiding light
Save us save us bring us back to paradise
Will my quest last forever
Out there in the world
I'm searchin'
The eyes of the world
And I pray for salvation
I can hear the children cry
Bring back paradise
Back to my world
Until your quest is finally over I'm waiting in the night
And in the end your soul will be my price
I' ll take you far away from time straight into my world
You will stay forever more here in chains
Through the crystal I see my tears
I see human life a world in harmony
Hear the children crying so clear
They are callin' from the sky
Will my quest last forever
Out there in the world
I'm searchin'
The eyes of the world
And I pray for salvation
I can hear the children cry
Bring back paradise
Back to my world <start> Combining the creative efforts that focused on the assassination attempts made upon all presidents  past and future  with the main ideals of capitalism and fears of environmental degeneration. The ozone depletion is a lie. A farce concocted by geniuses to cover up the tracks of wheels long set in motion. We are the seekers of sight. The sightseers seeing what no others have seen. Stop all production dumb down and unlearn. Why lie why deceive corruption is easier when the corrupted are corrupt to relearn is death but the dead have been walking the earth for years. <start> Through sin and selfdestruction I stumble home never alone
My only home is the bottom of a bottle and a rolled up bill and im ready to go
I live the same day in and out and I don't care how long I last
All the girls and drinks and drugs but dont get me wrong Im having a fucking blast.
I am rock and roll living a life you can only dream of
I am rock and roll at its fucking finest
Just like the cigarettes hurt
Just like the whiskey burns wohoa wohoa
I guess im never gonna learn 
Not gonna stop until my heart stops beating
Not gonna sttop untill my last breathe comes
Im gonna go until I hit the floor
Cant find a way back to my feet
Anymooorreeee
Pass me a glass and lets destroy everything in this fucking place life at three hundred miles an hour you pussys cant keep up with this fucking pace
I am rock and roll living a life we can only dream of
I am rock and roll at its fucking finest
Just like the cigarettes hurt
Just like the whiskey burns wohoa wohoa
I guess im never gonna learn 
Ive drunk the last time you stood here your by my side > forgot the text but i know it's different from whats here  studied the booklet i got from AA
You thought that it should be just like the good old days of rock and roll > same here

Without a drink without regret without a second thought
You hit the nail on the head with the back of your fucking throat
I am rock and roll living a life we can only dream of
I am rock and roll at its fucking finest
End <start> Finally the fight begins over the moor
And we know the enemy is much too strong
In the heart I have no fear coward I'm not
I'll be riding with the gods my time has come
Hear the sound of battle horns I have to go
Is there any glory for me I just don't know
Balder will you guide my way give me your strenght
On this field I face the death no turning back
bridge
My sword waits for blood
In the name of Thor
chorus
Open for me the gates of your Valhalla
Father Odin wait for me I'll be there with you
I will not die I'm riding through the sky
Warriors of eternity I'll be there with you
Blood was spilled many were killed
The battle seems over now am I really still live
Heimdall are you watching me from Bifrost
But I'm not dead not this time
Now the fight is over and here on the field
Lie so many broken men but I still live
One day I will meet you Odin but not today
And tomorrow into glory I'll ride again
bridge
chorus <start> Welcome and wake up
This is not a dream but something in between that and reality
Wake up if you dare
This is not the regular nightmare
Before your eyes the world will change
Slowly take you down to unknown places
Welcome to a world that's only yours
Wake up if you dare and just follow me
Leave me alone
My dreams speak to me or am I still awake
Leave me alone
I'm my own threat I'm a victim of my mind
Let go
I fooled you I warned you though
I won't let go before you've dreamed all your dreams
I'll play you
You want me to
You ask for more
You want to know
Leave me now I need to know I'm in control
Leave me alone
Leave me be within my private fantasies
Let go
I told you you I won't let go
I want to show you what dreams can do for you
They'll free you they'll open doors
They show you all you want to know
As some is light and some is dark dreams can be both
They have two sides
Fear
I am your fear deep inside
Fear
Face all your fears deep in this dream
We are the dark side of your mind
Pain
I am your pain deep inside
Pain
Feel all your pain deep in this dream
Feel it's a part of you
You are like your dreams both light as dark
Come with us now and explore
Silence I'm here
No words no sounds no pain or doubts
I'm floating
Even time itself can never touch me
I am free
Silence I'm here
No voices no music
I'm roaming through this soundless place
Leave me here where I am free
Doubt
I am your doubt deep inside
I am all you try to hide
Hate
I am your hate deep inside
I am your mirror your fright
Energized by nightly views
You are the dream the dream is you
Aah
So face it you know I'm right
You have no reason to resent me and fight
You are me and I am you
The other side of the sleepy truth
Leave me please how can I rest with you inside
Leave me alone I'm too tired for these crazy theories
Let go
I'll leave you but won't let go for I am part of all you'll ever do
I'll help you I'll open doors and show you all you need to know
For I'm your dream energizer <start> What is the sound that a froggy makes

Elephant <start> Step up it's time to face
Punishment from a different age
Are you witch or heretic
Wandering lost convicts
Take a look you'll see
It's much bigger than you or me
Future sadomasochism
Leather whips and hardcore rhythm
Make you fear make you tear
Memories that scar for years
Drain your brain of guilt and regret
What's your last request
Endless pain
Living hell
No drawn out trial
No bars no cell
Shut up don't be a fool
Electrocution make you drool
Burn your skin in search of truth
Sink or float either way you lose
Dead man walking straight to die
Eat last supper read last rites
Obsessed erotic with a mind possessed
Hug the blade one last caress
Cut the hand gouge the eye
Hung and whipped and burnt alive
A flood of blood a sea of pain
Torture modern day
Endless pain
Living hell
No drawn out trial
No bars no cell
Dead man walking straight to die
Eat last supper read last rites
Obsessed erotic with a mind possessed
Hug the blade one last caress
Cut the hand gouge the eye
Hung and whipped and burnt alive
A flood of blood a sea of pain
Torture modern day <start> Come here baby
I got something for you
Don't you wanna come with me
Hmm let's go
Ah do you do you do you do you feel the power
Do you do you feel do you do you feel
Ah do you do you do you do you feel the power
I'll tell you straight up
When it comes to real love
My arms are open and my heart knows the score
I've lived and learned now
Sometimes got burned out
But every time I pick myself off the floor
You need good loving like a desert needs the rain
Never make your heart complain
You keep on running like a river to the sea
Look no further boy 'coz I've got just what you need
You need the power of a woman
Of a woman
Taking over you that's what love can do
The power of a woman
Let me take control
Body mind and soul
Ah do you do you do you do you feel the power
Do you do you feel the power
Please don't misunderstand
I need a strong man
Who'll be my soldier never give up the fight
I've gotta know now
Baby let me show you how
Can you keep my fire burning morning to night
You're always caught up in a one way love affair
Never with your heart on the ground
I've got the real thing
Come and get it if you dare
Let me tell you baby don't you know I'm the one
You need the power of a woman
Of a woman
Taking over you that's what love can do
The power of a woman
Of a woman
Let me take control
Body mind and soul
Ah do you do you do you do you feel the power
Do you do you feel do you feel the power
Ah do you do you do you do you feel the power
Do you feel the power
Give me the power
Can you hear me baby
I got something for your mind your body and your soul
You need good loving like a desert needs the rain
Never make your heart complain
You keep on running like a river to the sea
Look no further boy 'coz I've got just what you need
You need the power of a woman
Taking over you that's what love can do
The power of a woman
Let me take control
Body mind and soul
Ah do you do you do you do you feel the power
Do you feel it baby do you feel the power
Ah do you do you do you do you feel the power
Do you feel it
Power of a woman
Taking over you that's what love can do
Power of a woman <start> Minamasdan kita
Nang hindi mo alam
Pinapangarap kong ikaw ay akin
Mapupulang labi
At matinkad mong ngiti
Umaabot hanggang sa langit
Huwag ka lang titinginsa akin
At baka matunaw ang puso kong sabik
Chorus
Sa iyong ngiti ako'y nahuhumaling
At sa tuwing ikaw ay gagalaw
Ang mundo ko'y tumitigil
Para lang sayo
Ang awit ng aking puso
Sana'y mapansin mo rin
Ang lihim kong pagtingin
Minamahal kita ng di mo alam
Huwag ka sanang magagalit
Tinamaan yata talaga ang aking puso
Na dati akala ko'y manhid
Hindi pa rin makalapit
Inuunahan ng kaba sa aking dibdib
Chorus
Sa iyong ngiti ako'y nahuhumaling
At sa tuwing ikaw ay lalapit
Ang mundo ko'y tumitigil
Ang pangalan mo sinisigaw ng puso
Sana'y madama mo rin
Ang lihim kong pagtingin
Sa iyong ngiti ako'y nahuhumaling

Sa tuwing ikaw ay gagalaw
Ang mundo ko'y tumitigil
Para lang sa'yo...

Sana ay mapansin mo rin...
Ang lihim kong pagtingin
Sa iyong ngiti... <start> Once my earthly pass
Over and stuck in the past
I will become one with the ground
Dust I'll be
For those who've seen my earthly pass
Taking place in the past
Coldness will lead to emptiness
Free I'll be from this carnal state.
The stench of mediocrity soars
Once tangible vanish
The lucid pure calmness of ecstasy
The carnal state my only grief
The carnal state
Entrenched in the logical
Carnal state
The epitome of a comfortless epoch
Transcend
Dreamless in this mind of flesh
Mind of flesh
The fragments of a worthless epoch
Collapse <start> High up in the mountains
An old man used to live
He prophesied the future
Long before it had occured
He told them their end
And he told them their future
But nobody gave a damn
They just called him a fool
Under the sign of the cross
He fulfilled their eager wishes
Greedy like hungry wolves
They never saw the end

THE WORLD OF DANGER
BESIDE THE GOOD
WE ALL NOW
TURN AROUND
THE MAGIC TABLE
NOTHING WILL BE
AS IT WAS BEFORE
The humans being blinded
By his own damned desires
Being better than the others
Not second best
As he then was gone
They had all lost their minds
They fought each other brother killing brother
His laughter sounded through the land
STEP IN TO
THE WORLD OF DANGER
BESIDE THE GOOD
WE ALL NOW
TURN AROUND
THE MAGIC TABLE
AND NOTHING WILL BE
AS IT WAS BEFORE <start> Desensitized by the values of life
Maligned and despaired by government lies
Revenge is so strong
I taste it on my tongue
My gun will be
Your angel of mercy
Dislocated by the eyes of disdain
Abused beyond recognition
I can't hope with
The madness abounding
Blasts in my head
Of gunfire resounding
Firing relentless
Killing the senses
I've got no more goddamn regrets
I've got no more goddamn respect
I am the thorn
In your eye
I am the thorn
In your eye
I am the thorn
In your eye
I am the thorn
In your eye
Revenge is so strong
I taste it on my tongue
My gun will be
Your angel of mercy
I've got no more goddamn regrets
I've got no more goddamn respect <start> Blood is my passion
My only obsession
My darkness is everything
The hunger for sins
running through my mind <start> 
Darksome Night and shining Moon
East then South then West then North
Harken to the Witches' Rune
Here I come to call Thee forth
Earth and Water Air and Fire
Wand and Pentacle and Sword
Work thee now to my Desire
Harken ye unto my Word
Queen of heaven Queen of Hell
Horned Hunter of the Night
Lend your Power unto my Spell
Work my Will by Magic Rite
Power of Land  Sway of Sea
Might of Moon and gift of sun
Do as I will  let It be
Chant the Spell and It be done.

Raise the banner to the sky
Saddle the beasts for battle now
Play the tunes of war
Mighty knights grab your swords and fight
Brothers of battle show your hate
United we are the enemies fate
Slaughter is our aim
Blood will flow heads will roll
PreChorus
we are the sons of evil
The call of the wild
We are the gods of war
The great force of death
Chorus
We're riding the glory war
On and on we're fighting with honour and pride
We are crusading now
Now it's time for victory
No surrender  no retreat
Across the battlefield
soldiers are raging tonight
Anger hatred agression pain
Behold the weak that won't remain
Let the ground be covered
with their blood and our pride
PreChorus

PreChorus
Chorus
Oh oh oh we are crusading now <start> When the fog of evil buried the whole world
Dark demons created their forces anew
There were only a few able
To resist the others creep to the gold
Thus they be baited with money and force
Their deepest nightmares awake every night
They resist all temptations of the dark side
The devil wasn't able to flag them alive
HATE AND BLOOD AND CRIME
THAT'S THEIR LAW
AND OUR FUTURE
THE NEW WORLD IS BUILT UPON THEIR LIES
BUT THE HEADLESS FOOLS NEVER SURVIVE
They were branded as heretics with eight
They were hunted they were sent to their doom
Now the Judas had accomplished
Betrayal is their faith and gold their real god <start> Justice by us revenge is a bitch
Now's the time to deal with it
Where the system fails we now prevail
Your innocence is my retribution
Eye for an eye street justice
In my mind
Now's the time to face your lies
You took her life destroyed her dreams
Her sufffering will be avenged
Vengeance is mine
Lynch mob
Your day has arrived
Lynch mob
Justice is now
Lynch mob
Judgement is served
Street cleaner is my name
My justice will be my way
I removed the scum of the earth
Intervention is on it's way
Now you face your judgement day
Vengeance is mine
Lynch mob
Your day has arrived
Lynch mob
Justice is now
Lynch mob
Judgement is served
The lynch mob arrives justified
Your sick and criminal mind must be crucified <start> A Rebel Of Fire  Has Power
To Complicate The World
It's Like A Devil  From Deep Hell
Who Burns Down Souls
Always So Laughingly  So Crazy
He Never  Nevercares
It's Like A Game  Unbelievable
Why Being Surprised
The Unfinished Wars
Have Taken All The Warriors
Memories Have Gone...
And Nations Are Done...
It's So Sad All The Way
Who Will Be In The World Tomorrow
Maybe We Can Trust The Unknown
World Tomorrow

While I'm down in my hatred weird right 
Your god has set you on fire this day the darkness light your way

The jetblack eyes are showing butterflies
They dance in the fire insane so
Chorus
Fire dance with me
Fire come with me
Fire your fire
Of the everlasting flame did burn me
The one we are all off often struggling down down down down
And when you hear me forth to the ever last
Hear me used to bear dreams cast in a silent near
Fire you're killing me
Fire a thorn sweet so rare
We'll praise the Lord to begin it
Until the others will fall
But victims are we all
We will at last destroy human gods
And within us the fire is burning
The dream lives forth we're standing strong to fight
And the everlasting fire is burning
Chorus <start> Are you ready for attack
Yeah Yeah Yeah

Every ordinary morning  This fucking pain you have to ease.
You can't find peace by avoiding life I won't hand my head.
I won't breakdown.
When you have no remorse things will turn around.
How does it feel when you're creeping on the ground
How does it feel when you're creeping
Yeah I'm losing my mind
Yeah I'm losing my mind
Deal with all your demons and play your cards so goddamn right.
Keep your sanity and vision you'll loose it all if you just hide
And the devil may care and feel no shame
When you fall to despair things will stay the same
How does it feel when you're creeping
Yeah I'm losing my mind
Yeah I'm losing my mind
Well I am hungry for life
I don't know who I am I don't know where I am
I just wanna get rid of this burden before I'm gone
Forever gone
Yeah I'm losing my mind
am I counting my days
Yeah I'm losing my mind
That's just the way it goes.
Yeah I'm losing my mind
I am hungry for life <start> Welcome to HELL
This is your worst dream
Open your eyes
Wake up with a scream
Horror inside
Between life and death
Quickgrowing pain
Still holding your breath
Memories flow
Flashing your mind
Staring at them
Like a movie with pride
But don't be surprised
When the tunnel will end
There will be NO light
And there will be NO friends
This is the place
Where violence belongs
It's all in your brain
Damage explodes
He came for your soul
He came for your life
Take a look in his eyes
Smell the blood on his knife
You will never escape
You've got nowhere to hide
There's no place you can run
Get ready to die
Memories flow
Flashing your mind
Staring at them
Like a movie with pride
But don't be surprised
When the tunnel will end
There will be NO light
And there will be NO friends
This is the place
Where violence belongs
It's all in your brain
Damage explodes <start> I Feel The Power Of Hell Once Again
I Can't Deny It I Can't Resist
I Can No Longer Escape From My Past
I'm The Chaos Breeding One
I've Got The Venom It Will Blow Your Mind
I've Got The Cure The Only One You'll Ever Need
I've Got The Venom It Will Blow Your Mind
I've Got The Venom So Step Aside
The Gates Are Open Towards The End We Go
We Will Bleed We Will Burn
But My Infernal Soul Lives On
Can You Feel The Power Of Hell Like I Do
I Can See The Rage In Your Eyes
But We're Not The Same
I've Got It In My Blood
It Runs Constantly Through My Veins
True Hate True Rage <start> So I told you where I hang out

Gang signs that's maile
Seventy two hours incarcerated
All because my hood floss bloody body's
On the pavement

Is what brings that type of drama
What a nigga need to start doin'
Is just kidnappin' your mama
Catch me in the game for  years
So watch my nigga catch stripes
In the middle of the night
Seein' fiends smoke pipes
Dub sacks an Coniac
Helps me deal with these phonies
Busters sellin' for G's that I stack
From the back to ponies
I got hommies with L's on they backs
Who fell through the crack
And hidin' shank's under they mattress
Where were you
When will you realize
When cockin' glocks
To pop those cops
Makes a Mil of these blocks
Ride in drop tops
Be foolin' with Gnocks
don't trust those bitches
They choose to squish and let em squeal
Go ahead and trust em
You'll have no money screamin' Biatch
To tha billi babang
The reflections drummin' like solo
Hold on like En Vogue

Lettin' em know at the do' with the full clip
When you bust at me

They steady runnin'

To keep the nigga off that lay low
Got niggs on the pay roll

Has been this livin' hell
For the thug life up on the street
And to the prison cell
Unlawful use is what
They caught me with a Tec
An do they got probable cause
They never did take no time
Steady use of prison
Took another brothers man hood
They choose next time
Up under the bench
They say its all good
But I was young
didn't know any better
Although I did comp out the bootcamp
Fly to give a brotha seven
Years of prison teirs
My hommies pourin' beers
I guess this henny
Should be life of what a thug lives
My only hurt
Maybe won't be my last
But here's a tip for these cops
Next time I'm goin' out with a blast
So if you look up in this black man's
Eyes of straight madness
Ready to buck you down
Upon the ground
For all my past teachers
Give your souls up

About that pen nigga
To the niggas on the street an in the pen yea <start> Where in Hell did You get so wrong
You're out to ban Rock 'n Roll songs
You want the people to follow You
Rule the masses that's Rock 'n Roll too
A Christian You say You are
I sayin' that You're misusing His name
You're liar You've gone too far
When He comes You'll be the one to blame
The greatest crime of all time
Another fool in time
You say that You will follow the Lord
But when He comes You won't be heard
No no way
Talk about the blind leading the blind
You're not nice You're evil  unkind
Your moral views has caused the pain
That's way
No one loves each other  You're to blame <start> Old folk remember
And those today learn
How before their time
Life was different here
Without the sun people lived
Groped about without the moon
With candles sowing was done
Planting performed with torch
At the time we lived
Without the sunshine
Who had covered up the sun
And who had hidden our moon
Without the moonlight stumbled
With our fists fumbled the land
With our hands we sought out roads
With hands roads with fingers swamps
We could not live without the sun
Or manage without a moonlight
Who would seek out the sun
Who spy out the moon
Who else if not God
The one son of God
Without the sun people lived
Groped about without the moon
With candles sowing was done
Planting performed with torch
At the time we lived
Without the sunshine
Who had covered up the sun
And who had hidden our moon
Without the moonlight stumbled
With our fists fumbled the land
With our hands we sought out roads
With hands roads with fingers swamps
We could not live without the sun
Or manage without a moonlight
Who would seek out the sun
Who spy out the moon
Who else if not God
The one son of God <start> no time for love you don't ask why.
your pillow's warm.
slip on your sandals imagine you are off to the ball.
they weren't awake you close the door
it's so unusual to sleep alone.
your hair in knots your dreams beyond their control.
no time for love  i can't explain. . .
no time for love. . . within these walls.
no time allowed to be a child.
no time for love no time no time for love no time
no chance for romancing
no time to be a child no time.
no time to talk so much to say.
go to the town in your cotton dress.
try all the clothes you know
you'll never afford to buy.
so you gaze at the stars of matinees.
piazza for the rich and the poor
then come home tired with a smile all over your face. <start> The night is drawing on but all the strain not told on him
And he wont fall into the sleep of the just
To be a tumbler or a lonesome intruder
He is as good as gold and searching for trust
 to be the harlequin who shines in dead gold
To kill those idle thoughts about this stronghold
 see the evening star in this sunset glow
Sailing the splendor ships straight on the port bow
Strike the sands of ever
The lingering sound of dreams
In harsh reality
Turn over a new leaf
Ardently desired
And forever
Chorus
 it fired his imagination so far
And he gave rise to hope
 this true ring of conviction will leave a scar
 the dancer on a rope
 so wheres the difference between man and machine 
And who will draw the line 
 the game is worth the candle always been
May all the ways then shine
Sometimes hes worlds apart and elsewhere lies his dream
And he wont never shift the blame on you
Sometimes a parting kiss speaks louder than action
When life turns suddenly like a bolt from the blue
 hes not the silver slave supposed to be
Hes on the rise to fame out of this tragedy
 so now the odds are even literally true
There is no limit to it all there is no taboo
Strike the sands of ever
The lingering sound of dreams
In harsh reality
Turn over a new leaf
Ardently desired
And forever
Chorus
Dont clip those wings of a flying
When wearing your heart on your sleeve
But still there is life among dying
The far cry off and makebelieve
In this palatial hallway
Should all be null and void 
Between the tricks of fortune
In years that he enjoyed
He is the one enigma
Highflown beneath the sun
Is he the last resort 
When future has begun
Chorus <start> Instrumental <start> Raising like brothers
Sharing their dreams
Feeling protested
 it's not like it seemed
Jelousy grew
As time went on by
Nobody knew
That their love was a lie
Unspoken hate
Tor them apart
They had to wait
The fight couldn't start
Slaved by their descent
Unable to slove
Searching the reason
Searching the truth
Destiny paid it's dues
And they have nothing left to loose
 both build a kingdom
Reigning different worlds
They were like
FIRE AND ICE
One have the poverty
One lived in luxury
They ruled
HEAVEN AND HELL
Both ruled their nation
With power and strength
Darkshaded warriors
Waiting to strike
Like vultures who circle
On the top of their victims
Patient they are waiting
'til their time has come
Tagedy took it's all
And the winner took it all
Chorus <start> Don't come on quietly when you draw near
Don't go on lightly
Don't leave me here
I wither quickly in winter's cold but carry onward like I was told
And I wait for a sign
Like blood in the tears of all my enemies 
Knowing the pain the way they should
Blood in the tears of all my enemies 
Leaving a trail to where you stood
And when it's quite when you can hear I beg you take me away from here <start> After times of desolation
Frozen minds will melt
Our buried souls are rising
The deep fall of heaven
Fallen angels are with me
Their shadows darken the sky
Storms are coming
We will enter a new chapter of time
Beyond damnation of soul
We have left our mortal bodies
We will go everywhere
We will live <start> After you my dear
in mutial use we're one you see
You will know how it feels to sing along
with angelsongs and ride the glory winds
Rule the tide
lose all thats you all you can memorize
It's to bad you're stuck in your stupidity
Use your head it's just a game of give and take
Make your choice it's joy versus reality
In a dream a woman cried from high above
Telling me In heaven they don't have enough
Can't you see weOre messengers of higher breed
You and me
We're all that's left of men's supremacy
Chorus
Eyes behold one of these days all my dreams'll enfold
Lies scream It's over...over...
In return for 'all the faith' that you had in me
You all may dig your holes
So in love my dear
By my side while I'm inside of you
Yes it seems IOm seeing others down the side
Don't blame me I'm far to sick to realize
Seventeen virginity on hand and knees
Stick with me
The needle shows just what you mean to me
Chorus <start> Hunted by your lunacy captured mental poverty
Eat me smell me taste my fear catastrophy...
The coldest human steel trapped between my teeth
I'm creeping back more and more and more <start> The gephyr the sullen breath
Horizons of history reerodent
The haven where the stars are set
Constellations of manifestation
Glow expanding through forever
I all with the rain rise with the ocean
Drain to expire the shrine of fortility
Burn as the flame as strong as a came
Twine the existence sense of serene
Thousand senses of virtual faction
Existential inputs production of mind
Instinctive raised to find
As the salt in the sea burns in me
Forever the taste in your mouth is
Eternising the soul soaked estate
Solvable as fractional fragments
Divine gracious divulgence
Pulse rotation the spine of creations
Wane as the circle of zero
As the salt in the sea burns in me
Forever the taste in your mouth is
Eternising the soul soaked estate
Solvable as fractional fragments
The genuine pulse  the link of a thousand senses
The genuine pulse  entire celestial allegiance
The genuine pulse  dense induce of the indomitable
Never to fail thus existence I sail
Through the elements of four
The gephyr the sullen breath
Horizons of history reerodent
The haven where the stars are set
Constellations of manifestation
Glow expanding through forever
Measure the circle of eternity
The treasure of ability
The Genuine Pulse <start> You can wear all their clothes
and watch all the same TV shows.
Little spots of you
dripping down
into the dust.
You can't even form a reflection
in the mirror anymore. <start> Gather 'round all you firestarters
Whirlwind reapers and comet riders
Come sons of Remus
The beast now calls
Wolf sire children
Daughters of Rome  come
Gather 'round all you fire starters
Whirlwind reapers and comet riders
Come sons of Remus
The beast now calls
Wolf sire children
Daughters of Rome  come
Come all you mountain lions
Come to our mountain fire
Come and heed the call
We are what you're looking for
Come all you wild wolves
Women with sharpened claws
Come to our mountain fire
We have what you're looking for
Yes you are what we're looking for
Gather 'round all you firestarters
Whirlwind reapers and comet riders
Come to our mountain hall
Come and heed the call
Come all you immoral seizers
Fire starters and whirlwind reapers <start> The leafs and I entangled dance a harmonie
I dare not stain with vain delight
And thus embraced we roam the passing eve like a
pillgrim who craves a shelters guiding light
I question thee beloved night to calm my joy
so that I not like the weary leaves be strewed
For I submitt to thy solitary grace  even springs
life is by winters gaze subdued
Lost in a dream I beheld a maiden dance
And when she sat down by a sliver stream
Plunging her feet in the shallow waves
A mist descended kissed her and fled
And all that's before been just and fair
Shattered in a rain of crystal shards
Each of them a cry a dream a tear
Nunquam submergiove aut diffugo
Ira inflammata mea vita ad salutem nominarit
Et solitudo meurn robur
Everlasting be the war that I declare
Extinguished thy bewitched spark despair
Torched the pile upon which you
Are gathered  poisoning my weary heart
And as the forked fires tongue licks high I won't
lament thy fall
But dance around the burning branches urged by furys
call
And I again shall not be humble slaves but king to thee
Dreams on the barren field did lay strewed
Spread their wings rise up with solemn hope imbued
Ascend the stary stairs into a plain but dear refuge. <start> Ancient and lifeless like god's perfect idols
The statues looked down and unspeaking saw
The hypocrisy uttered within these four walls
Is this the palace of a just god at all
For many were the wars we saw many fought and
died
God's kingdom prospered upon those corpses
piled high
Giving sanctimony to slaughter the churches
killed for christ
We saw that their religion was the hand that
held the knife
Now the altar is silent and claimed by the
dust
This building crumbles from disuse and
mistrust
The annals of infamy attest to the last great
truth
Religion is a whore  <start> take me from this hell.
when are you calling
tortured and blistered world.
darkness consumes us all.
lessons in civility right before you start to crawl underneath my skin.
well i know how this fucking ends.
darkness consumes us all and i'll break your fucking heart.
i'm torn between right and wrong.
its apathy that wont make this a love song.
I could not care less about you.
there will come a day when prejudice dictates right and wrong.
and darkness consumes us all.
and it'll break your fucking heart.
cant you see that all the songs end the same.
when you try you fail you lose you fightand you win.
well tis too bad life doesnt have simple answers.
and it breaks your heart that everything cant be a love song.
and it breaks your heart. <start> I'm in the place where nothing is alive
Nothing is certain and nothing is seen
To fall upon you is no pleasant choice
I've lost my sight I've lost my voice
Nothing nowhere endless
Hollow airless shameless
Come along and seize thy demons
If you know what you are made of
Enter silence hear it swallow
Inside these realms your soul is hollow
SILENT DARKNESS ETERNAL PAIN
TIME IS STANDING STILL
SILENT DARKNESS ETERNAL PAIN
TIME IS STANDING STILL <start> Oj kak ja vybegu probegu k ruch'ju
Vdol' da po beregu.
Oj kak golovushku svetluju sklonju
Nad oberegami.

Svetom ozari veru vozrodi <start> Lord if you don't help me I can't get through this
I can't
Lord I'm too old for games
Foolish wisdom
And I'm tired of rhetoric meaningless rhetoric that never changes things
Lord just help me
Just help me
I was feeling God's pain and I've never had anything that's been any worse to god
In my fifty years that wasn't born in agony never never
Damn empty
And I know that simons won't do it
I know that revelation won't do it
Comedies won't do it
I know now oh my god do I know it
Until I'm in agony
Until I'm in anguish over it
I'm preaching sermons
Oh God
I broke down and I wept and I mourned
Does it matter to you at all
I can't handle this
I can barely make it into here
Little by little you're losing me you're almost caught
Love with Christ
People I know that were my friends
I've seen them go one by one some of my closest friends
You're changing from what you were
You're changing
Little by little somethings happening to you
Will he bring you to your knees
That's all the devil wants to do take the fight out of you and kill it
So you won't in prayer anymore
So you won't weep before God anymore
Go to HELL
No weeping not one prayer still nothing
This is life and death
And the walls go down and ruin sets in
Where's the tears
Where's the mourning
Where's the confessing
The love of Christ
I had to get the agony of gods heart
We...have sinned <start> Soldier of sunlight
Welcome to the kingdom of ignorance
Where all the tears of ages tell their tales
No one dares to break the spell
No one dares to fly
Time is running out you can't deny
How many times
Have you found yourself under the influence
How many times has a mirror mad you cry
Now it's time to stand upright
Tear down your inner door
The birth of yourself can't wait no more
In your mind there's a battle raging on
Try to find what you're fighting for
Chorus
Wake up the king
From his sleep in your fantasy
Wake up the king
Let him be all you ecstasy
Tears flow to rivers
And rivers to oceans of broken dreams
Have you ever heard of tears of joy
Show yourself a sense of life
Open up your eyes
Let your heartbeat be your best advice
In your eyes I can see the fire burn
Realize now it is your turn
Chorus
Look at the mountain look at the sun
Feel all the pure energy
Birds fly and whisper call out your name
They belong to you and you're the
King of a kingdom light in your hand
Look at what you have never seen
Walk on a rainbow look to the stars
Cry it out and make your dream come true
Chorus x 
Can't you see the crown
 <start> Bloodshed starts twisting and raging
Driven by dirt hidden inside
Fear turns to hatred the core depraved
Desperate people ready to join the lines
Oppose
Divide
Confront
Collide
Far from regret intolerant enraged
self justified
Their bloody slogans fuel the hate
And all that's left is dead bodies for the flies
Diseased machinery blinded masses
Still upholding the cruel and insane
A vicious circle clouds their minds
And no one will ever stop their violent reign <start> A dying romance bleeding for my sensation
Would Death unmask the azure of the creation
Oh stay far from my crown of certainties
A dying romance the blindman's torch of ideals
Men of stories don't try to robe my morning star
Cause it will never shine in your eden
A dying romance withered by your naivety
The scent that I perceive comes from words
Which escaped your mouth of flies
Selfish fetid romance
You lick the shit of this world
Men's quintessence sways in streams of hope
Drowning in silvercups always used at funerals
Marvellous when even Death tries to flee from you
The flames leave their candles soon they will die too <start> Gaze at the leaving clairvoyant
Predicting invasions and pain
A child cansee through the stranger...
The Watcher's eye the noble liar
It's time for the merchant and his help for sale...
Blades to cut wicked flesh
On a merchantman he counts his money
Then he sails away
The sea he'll cruise is blood and fire
Oh father I can't see a lane
They make you a pawn in the game
For we all are deaf dumb and blind
After the storm when the magic has gone
Drown in the tears of a mandrake
Pawn in the game invisible chains
Try to move you'll feel as they graze
After the storm when the magic has gone
Drown in the tears of a mandrake
Fading away the final decay
Try to move break out from your chains
When you're off to the hall of the serpent
See the cynic who's counting his gold
While gun runners priests and clairvoyants
Are dancing around the rising demon
You are taught to eat up all the crap they shit
Parading your nuts on a silver plate
Kill your brother by the blade they sell
For you don't unite
They reap your bondage sowing evil
There's no use to tell what I've seen
They know how to make you believe
Just what they want you to know

The prophet
Many martyrs have fallen
since I passed that what
The truth
Many skies have bled.
The prophet
Many gods did return many prayers
lost their aim many loves have felt.
The truth
Many suns were born.
The prophet
I wonder if the children will forgive ...
When the light dies through infinite darkness
and the children start to cry
when a scream turns to a whisper
when the ages bleed alive ...
Reality becomes illusion
illusion is reality
is this an alliance of the ancient
or the new birth of a prophecy
Unnatural beings morbid existence
resuscitated horror ambigious visions
see the apocalypse  rise ...
We were
banned by the fire in the grip of the ceremony.
We saw
types in our hearts we denied every life we could give
And
infinity grasped out for slaves day by day  year for year.
Why
that prophet spoke to the abyss below him
Have we ever been free
And behind the shade sleeps an apocryphal wisdom
in the hour of twilight
in this legendary times ...
Unnatural beings morbid existence
resuscitated horror ambigious visions
see the apocalypse  rise ...
Now that the breath has gone
the fire claims its might
now that in this dark millenium
no master is alive.
Now that s castle stands
between the ruins of the past
now that the omens wither away
no hope will ever last.
The prophet
I wonder if the children will forgive ... <start> I have paced these forests for so long I don't know if I am man or I am beast.
I though hold deep within me a quest for revenge.
Then I must be a man as much as I can be.
I have learned to speak the tongue of the animal
I have learned to read the signs in bark and snow.
I have taken within myself the spirits of my fathers
long time gone.
In this short time far from home a man of Iron I've grown.
A man of Iron I have grown.
A part of the eternal woods
Late evening
Just after sunset on his way back to his camp after watching the sun unite
with the mountains in the west he sees the flickering of light between the
tree trunks. Approaching he sees an old man sitting calmly by a fire as
if waiting for him. His left eye missing. His beard as if gold. The signs
on his cloak and hood familiar. The one eyed old man matches the
description of the soothsayer as told by the elders of his village by the
fires at night when he only a child. The boy now a young man eager to
know asks the one eyed old man about his dreams. Dreams he cannot
understand. Dreams about strange things he is seeing himself doing. Then
the winds that seem to talk to him. Voices that whisper to him behind his
back. The one eyed old man tells him of the cycles of the stars of the
trail of fate and of the valley where time and space had ceased to exist...
where his world ends and the shadows begin. The one eyed old man tells the
young man that fate has chosen him to interfere with the other world. The
disturbance is already made. The daughters of the four winds have sold
themselves to the shadows distorting the balance of the universe. And the
one eyed old man says he has seen him come for a thousand years and that
the aging gods have told him to teach him all that he has ever known and to
prepare him to ride beyond his world and into the shadows as their champion
to restore the balance. To his aid he shall be given a sword forged when
this world was young. He shall be guarded and guided by two ravens and he
shall ride the eightlegged stallion of his fathers' god. He will encounter
the Woodwoman and he will make a visit to the Lake. One hundred days and
one hundred nights his training shall be hard. And this very night it will
already have begun.
And thus he had met the One Eyed old Man... <start> Turn it on

Venga intentalo es tu ultima oportunidad.

My brain
Desperation of a world when will it change
The need for peace the need for something to
Give me hope
Cause this planet soon will reach the end of its
Rope
Governmental bureaucratic assholes tell me that
All is well
They also tell me that to have peace stockpiles
Must swell
It seems to be though that their logic somehow
Just doesn't work
They must take us for jerks
Insanity by the numbers
Pushing 'til we break
It's insanity by the numbers
How much more will we take
We always sit and let them push us around
This is democracy let's stand our ground
For death is certain and life is not
Don't waste the time we got
The final countdown's slowly ticking away
On a clock that's gonna fucking blow us away
We're fighting for our very lies
Do we die or survive
Funny how we've seen its power yet we still build
Wasn't Hiroshima enough  dead
But still this insanity keeps on dragging me down
What is this fascination they have with zero ground
It's insanity <start> Transylvanian hunger cold soul
Your hands are cruel to haunt to haunt
The mountains are cold soul soul
Careful pale forever at night
Take me can't you feel the call
Embrace me eternally in your daylight slumber
To be draped by the shadow of your morbid palace
Oh hate living
The only heat is warm blood
So pure so cold
Transylvanian hunger
Hail to the true intense vampires
A story made for divine fulfillment
To be the ones breathing a wind of sorrow
Sorrow and fright the dearest catharsis
Beautiful evil self to be the morbid count
A part of a pact that is delightfully immortal
Feel the call freeze you with the uppermost desire
Transylvanian hunger
My mountain is cold
So pure evil cold
Transylvanian Hunger <start> Intro
Hello Monica Gabriela where are you
Last night I left my mama writing this song

Boys were all waiting and the party was on

We love to boogie and were not going to stop

Dancing all night and now we're feeling so hot

Chorus
Get the party on 
Get the party on 
All night long
Singing mama's song
Ooh baby hide me now my mamma has come

She's gonna catch me and a smack a my bum

Turn up the music and my mamma will dance

Lost in the rhythm of this cheeky romance

Hot desire staggering passion
Graving complection and pefection
Made us blind
Greed of completeness made us man
To subject and vassales of ourselves
Presumpteous creatures
How narrow are you 
Selfaggrandized destructive individuals
The believing in yourself
Growing up to selfishness
Egoism discards moral and ethics
Godless years shall arise
Godless years are devined
We provoke the death
We're damned to die
Masscorruption dominates
World of lies and of sin
Godless years
We all live in
Selfnominated gods
You're only god's image
Those who believe in eternal resignation
Await your final downfall
Godless years shall arise
Godless years are devined
We provoke the death
We're damned to die
Masscorruption dominates
World of lies and of sin
Godless years
We all live in
Lost in megalomania unclean human beings 
Drunken by blood
Having the force
To judge about life and death
Never prudent always merciless
Kingdom of waste and poverty unclean human beings
Thirst for power
Might and pride
Glitter and gold rape their intellect
Rejection is calling primitive instincts
Godless years shall arise
Godless years are devined
We provoke the death
We're damned to die
Masscorruption dominates
World of lies and of sin
Godless years
We all live in
Infamous world whore called babylon
Godless years death to us..... and fear 
Hot desire staggering passion
Craving completion and perfection
Greed of completeness made us man
To subjects and vassales
Of ourselves
How much you have
Glorified yourself
So much torment and sorrow you'll get
Horde of protical sons
Await your final downfall
Godless years shall arise
Godless years are devined
We provoke the death
We're damned to die
Masscorruption dominates
World of lies and of sin
Godless years
We all live in
 <start> In my mind demons call to me
Telling me I belong to them
Voices within won't leave me be
Horrid visions they make me see
Voices within bringing my madness
Feeling only pain and sadness
Evil cries haunt my very soul
Making me part of the infernal brood
Voices within won't leave me be
Horrid visions they make me see
Voices within bringing my madness
Feeling only pain and sadness <start> In Fire
She's waiting
To turn the ice away
A liar
Is saving
Up on the mountains of pain
Warrior of light be silent
Rule the earth is meant to be
I am here to reign in violence
For my eyes are of ice
Fighter
Bringing the light to the sky
Warrior
Crashing through the gates of icy times
For she'll return to the bright
For a sign
Coming from a kingdom once defied
This scenery <start> Cuando ests solo la sombra del miedo te invadir
En tus ojos veo tus dudas tus pesadillas y tu voluntad
A quin pudiste vender tu alma para olvidar
Un pasado oscuro que nunca vuelva
Tus miedos perdidos en la eternidad
Cal es la verdad de un sangriento pasado
Un sueo de gloria y una seal
Nunca sabrs cual es la respuesta
Tan distante y tan fugaz
Cuando ves al fin la luz del sol
Cuando intentes encontrar amor
Te arrodillars y llorars
Tu sangriento pasado volver
Noche tras noche postrado
En tus miedos recordars
Que tu vida hace tiempo acabado
Nunca tendrs otra oportunidad
Cuando ves <start> Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full never seems to change
Just labeled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep my friend and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says rage
Sanitarium leave me be
Sanitarium just leave me alone
Build my fear of what's out there
And cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that i'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied it makes him well
He's getting better can't you tell
No more can they keep us in
Listen damn it we will win
They see it right they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell
Sanitarium leave me be
Sanitarium just leave me alone
Sanitarium just leave me alone
Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again <start> Every day it's all the same no matter how I turn or twist my brain
I toss my body and scratch my fckin' mind
I bend and duck but I bounce 'gainst things all time
I'm left in this box I'm firmly and all stuck
I'm neatly tied and shelved I'm choked contained withheld
Outta space I'm growing outta space
I think I'm goin' crazy
Outta space I'm growing outta space
It's driving me crazy
Outta space I'm growing outta space
I think I'm goin' crazy
Outta space I'm growing outta space
I think I'm goin' out of my mind
I open my eyes wide to see some light
I take a breath and feel my box too tight
No matter how I press and push all day
That fckin' lid of mine won't give away
I'm left in this box...
Outta space... <start>

Journey far and journey long
Must I before I rest
I leave the world behind
My world I leave behind
No care have they that evil folk
For souls cast aside
They beat my heart to dust
My heart beaten to dust
Weeks I go over hill and plain
Till I come to the pits of Hell
A barren land of rot
A land of barren rot
A gruesome beast call this their home
Who gladly I befriend
They need someone to rule
I'll be the one to rule
Then feast your eyes upon this jewel
An empire arises
From nothingness I'll come to rule
Over the world's horizons
The beast in you has longed for blood
And blood you now shall taste
Your Saviour has at last arrived
In Nachtok we're embraced
Our day is come
The Krakhon folk I've come to love
Near to my soul they are
We hate and burn as one
We burn our hate as one
In ugliness I've found my core
A festering desire
To loose the pending storm
The doom within the storm
And feast your eyes upon this jewel
An empire arises
From nothingness I'll come to rule
Over the world's horizons
Your wicked souls
Have longed for flesh
And flesh you now shall taste
Your hunger will not be denied
In Nachtok you're embraced
Our day is come
The hand of fate reaching
From the bowels of the Earth
They'll not foresee as it takes hold
And grinds them into dirt
Retribution I'll deal out
No less than they deserve
And claim their shining deity
And on their knees they'll serve
ON THEIR KNEES
The Krakhon Army
Then feast your eyes upon this jewel
An empire arises
From nothingness I'll come to rule
Over the world's horizons
Torek  The Krakhon Army
The beast in us has longed for blood
And blood we now shall taste
Our Saviour has at last arrived
Our hunger will not be denied
A wave of war we all shall ride
And Naschtok we'll embrace
Our day is come <start> Oh how stone became for me this world
The world which once in my heart I liked to carry so.
Oh where has gone the rare flower
Whose thorns haven't stopped to throttle my soul.
My hopes faded and my longings fell into oblivion.
I lived for love but the dream became only suffering for me.
In bottomless despair changed my belief and waiting
In tears is drowned my past and in my eyes the joy isn't yet
Only unfilled longings.
Oh tragedy the mother of my gloomy fate
I can't laugh when my yarn of life
From sadness you began to weave.
Oh how I am afraid afraid of new day
This endlessly bitter pilgrimage through uncertainty.
My heart dies in palm of anxiety and distress
And my life fades veiled in vexing emptiness. <start> Two crayons sat upon a bed
One was green the other red.
The sheets were blue to set the mood
The silly crayons name was Fred.
He told her that he was in love
Outside the window singing doves
Sewed and pressed on bright blue sky
And crawling were two lady bugs.
He nudged her with a giggle
She smiled and scootched in a little.
If she had a hand he would grasp
He gave her a purple skittle.
He poked his girl and lent a hug
As they rolled around ontop a rug.
Two little crayons fell in love
Two little crayons fell in love.
It was the same for you and me
Curled and hunched under a tree
The shade blocked the sun so hot
My hands were in your pocket
I licked my lips I could taste it now
The love for you left me in awe
Two little kids fell in love
Two little kids fell in love.
Oh I fell in love with you.
It wasn't something I was supposed to do
But I fell in love with you.
The wrappers wrapped them up so tight
And held them all throughout the night.
Colors mixed to form a new.
Crayons remind me of you.
He poked his girl and lent a hug
As they rolled around ontop a rug.
Two little crayons fell in love
Two little crayons fell in love.
Oh I fell in love with you.
It wasn't something I was supposed to do
But I fell in love with you.
And now they fall asleep together
Each one holding each other.
Two little crayons fell in love
Two little crayons fell in love. <start> Rows of houses all bearing down on me
I can feel their blue hands touching me
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
And fade out again and fade out
This machine will will not communicate
These thoughts and the strain I am under
Be a world child form a circle
Before we all go under
And fade out again and fade out again
Cracked eggs dead birds
Scream as they fight for life
I can feel death can see its beady eyes
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
And fade out again and fade out again
Immerse your soul in love
IMMERSE YOUR SOUL IN LOVE <start> Compelled to speak when not to speak
My words lead and I follow
I must talk or else I'm weak
Let no one know my shell's hollow
False world created
I just watch it come to life
Your faith's my weapon
And your trust by my side
Lost all my senses
Can't feel can't hear I'm
Blinded
Lost all my senses
Emotionally numb
Blinded
Nothing's sacred and no one's safe
I'm feeding on denial
Getting careless soon bound to fail
Fooled by my own betrayal
Are you lost in fury
Fearing to fail
Are you aching for vengeance
And got lost on the way
Are you hiding your anger
Fearing truth will prevail
Ashamed of the present
And what you've become today
False world created...
Lost all my senses... <start> Wooden grief
lost in silence
dream of life
cold as shudder
Every day from birth
only way I walk.

If today was gonna be his last
An average day in the middle of a life
Terminated by a sharp knife
Killing spilling the liquid blood
As his boyz found him lying face down in the mud
You might say this song is in poor taste
But I must discuss the waste
Chorus I
Of lives of friends that I have lost
Who pays the price who pays the cost
Can't cry just anger till the end
It burns inside to lose a friend
Walking thin lines anything to cop a dime
Labelled habitual a loser three times
Just fucking' around knuckles bloody to the bone
Whatever the future's unknown
Unless you believe in predestination of fate
The letter read termination
It was fucked up I couldn't make out his face
Through the blod what a fucking waste
Chorus I
Chorus II
My friend was there until the end 
Can never be replaced
The pain that I taste 
What a fucking waste
Chorus I
Cold blooded murder suicide another body laid to rest
Untimely demise homicide my faith is put to the test
Is there a god sometimes I just can't believe
My friend who is dead was shot and then robbed
Something quite hard to conceive
People dying everyday there's got to be a better way
The losses blow my mind away the stain of blood will always stay
Like the memory of a friend who stood with me until the end
The losses blow my mind away the stain of blood will always stay
Chorus I
Lead
It's not for me that I grieve but for the families left berieved
I question whether life is fair I wonder if I even care
We think we know what life is worth until they lower us beneath
the earth
Mother crying forever hurt my face like stone I shavel dirt
Chorus II <start> When they are coming
Give us guidance
For they are calling
To erase the damned
Yet after all they praise the coming
To erase the damned
They will return
Now let me take you to the other side
Turn off the light and let it grow
They will set it on fire
They come to fool us all
They are slaves to the Fire you know
Their fire must grow
They have to feed it
We must believe in something
That I would call a miracle
The grail will break the final seal
We must believe in something
A miracle a miracle machine
We just hide it secretly
No belief no belief no belief
Give us what we need
Betrayed by the Nine
I've learned to love the shadows
And now they're coming home
That's why I need you on the other side
And then we we may carry another light
I summon from the inside deeper insight
They don't belong here
Though they claim they're right
Let it grow
Turn off the light
Let reason grow
They will set it on fire
They come to fool us all
They are slaves to the Fire you know
Their fire must grow
They have to feed it
We must believe in something
That I would call a miracle
The grail will break the final seal
We must believe in something
A miracle a miracle machine
We just hide it secretly
For they are coming
Give us guidance <start> Through your eyes I fight for gravity
A place to stand and a place to breathe
When the walls begin to shake
In the home you thought you knew
Will you run Will you stay Will you choose
Do you know who I am
I'm so afraid you'll never understand
There's a part of me still lost out there
And I just want to know
Yeah I just want to know
Am I becoming a hologram
Close your eyes from the darker side of things
A shade of grey hidden under sheets
When the walls begin to shake
In the home you thought you knew
Will you run Will you stay Will you choose
Do you know who I am
I'm so afraid you'll never understand
There's a part of me still lost out there
And I just want to know
Yeah I just want to know
Am I becoming a hologram
Now I think I'm worried that I'm in too deep
Like a phantom that you'll never see
So I just want to know
Yeah I just want to know
Am I a part of the hologram
You have seen this incident based on sworn testimony.
Can you prove that it didn't happen
Perhaps on your way home someone will pass you in the dark
And you will never know it for they will be from outer space

Do you know who I am
I'm so afraid you'll never understand
There's a part of me still lost out there
And I just want to know
Yeah I just want to know
Am I becoming a hologram
Now I think I'm worried that I'm in too deep
Like a phantom that you'll never see
So I just want to know

Wake and do not shed a tear for me
You knew someday that I would have to leave you
Lonely highway
Morning sun will find me far away
You know that if I could I would stay with you
I'm on my way now... I'm on my way
Endless highway
Reaches out to touch the morning sky
The desert wind is rushing through my window
And far away I know she is rising
And far away I know waits for me
And far away she is crying
If there was a way babe
You know that I would be there
Sleep my lady
You know someday we will meet again
We'll dance beneath the moon dream of forever
It seems so far away
That day just seems so far away
Sleep my sweet lady
Wake and do not shed a tear for me
You know that I will always love you <start> Cantinero traiga una botella pa'que me quite el dolor

The outlaws and the lawmen that prevail
The bounty hunter's job is on the wrong side of the law
Intentions of the truth and nothing more
Burn 'em clear the streets as he rides into the town
Cause the nameless one's gonna have some fun
He's gonna bring an outlaw down
Wasted it's over quick he's nailed 'em three for three
Then he with his squinteyed grin and stubbled chin
He rides through history
The jury in his mind the choices weigh
The trials if you're guilty you're his prey
No judgment otherwise can change the lust
That's in his eyes
The sentence will be carried out in stride
No name like a shadow on a moonies night
Real game He'll be there to uphold
Justice law and order
And you'll pay the highest fee
When the gunslinger takes his piece
The money it's the price you have to pay
When he calls drop your eyes and look away
The man has taken life to balance scales of wrong and right
Existence each day a moral fight. <start> The mist is rising over the ocean's waves
Together we leave the shores of hell behind us to find our destination
The sun is hiding behind the horizon leaving its realm to the endless night
Right under the ocean's waves the Leviathan will rise
Technomancia the dark creation of a wicked soul
Brace yourselves for the fury of the ocean wants it toll
Under a crimson sky the danger is revealed
What evil stands behind these eyes
It's in the wind the feeling of sudden death awaits as the Leviathan rises
We were not meant to travel the open seas
Now we are reminded of its mortal nature by this dark creation
The safe way to the shore is denied leaving no choice but to stand and fight
The issue of this confrontation carries through the night
Technomancia the dark creation of a wicked soul
Brace yourselves for the fury of the ocean wants it toll
Under a crimson sky the danger is revealed
What evil stands behind these eyes
It's in the wind the feeling of sudden death awaits as the Leviathan rises
Under a crimson sky the danger is revealed
What evil stands behind these eyes

HOLES FULL OF LIGHT IM ALL RIGHT WITH THIS GUN IN MY HEAD
DESTINED TO FALL LET ME IN.
STAND FOR A CAUSE YOUVE BEEN LOST
IN THE SLUM OF THE DAMNED. CRAWL BACK INSIDE SEPARATE.
YOU CAME YOU SAW YOU CONQUER MY SOUL.
YOU CAME TO TAME. AND LEFT ME
WITH NO SOUL TO SAVE
IM SO UNSTABLE THE FAADE OF A MAN WHO LOST FAITH.
PREACHER OF FALSE LET ME GROW
AN INVASION IN MY INSANITY NO DIRECTION FOR THE LIFE YOU SET FREE <start> Tired and lonely still we stand
On a road to nowhere
Trapped in a world of endless days
My engine's stalling 
Body and mind are breaking down
On a road to nowhere
Destiny silent hear no sound
As I wait forever.
Farewell I'll miss you
I'm sick of these goodbyes
'Cause it tore us apart right from the start
I miss you
Feelings have failed me
Left me cold
On this road to nowhere

Dreams are my saviors
Save me now
'Cause I know I'm fallin' 
Farewell I'll miss you
I'm sick of these goodbyes
'Cause it tore us apart right from the start
I miss you
Candles burn slowly
Flames shine so brightly
Light in the darkness
Save me from madness again
Only the lonely
could possibly know me
Heat keeps on rising
Fire engulfs me again
KEEPS ON RISING
Farewell I'll miss you
I'm sick of these goodbyes
'Cause it tore us apart right from the start
I miss you
Farewell I'll miss you

Suppressing the power inside
Tear away all that was wrong
Something too massive to hide
It's time to rip the chain from your neck
Let go the past as you purge
Free now from everything weighing you down
Open the floodgates and surge with
New found power
Cleansing yourself of the past
Learn from mistakes and move on
Conquering new ground at last
Unite and become twice as strong
It's time to rip the chain from your neck
Let go the past as you purge
Free now from everything weighing you down
Open the floodgates and surge with
New found power
Nothing ventured nothing gained
Hope was all that kept me sane
Rise above and prove myself
I'll survive without your help
Shut you out my strength comes from within
New found power <start> Out one night yo just chillin' out with my crew
We were actin' wild
'Cause I didn't have nothin' else better to do.
Got a nine at my waist
Stay out my fuckin' face.
You fuck with me
Right here'll be your resting place.
Some ol' sucka yo he tried to put a move on me
I shot him in the face
Murder in the first degree.
Now I'm sweatin' regrettin'
That's not for me
They got me locked in the fuckin' penitentiary.
Bowels of the devil
Let me tell you what the muthafucka eats
Its stomach's filled with lost souls
Guts made out of steel and concrete.
Bowels of the devil
Listen close 'cause I've been there before
And you don't want to die there
They call it goin' out the back door
The back door the back door the back door.
Walked in the club all the ho's gave me the sex look
They like a nigga like me 'cause I'm a known crook
And my posse's down we don't mess around
You fuck with us
You'll be six feet underground.
That night they got me locked in a row called death
The governor that muthafucka wants my last breath.
That's right homeboy wanted to pull a switch on me
Up here in this fuckin' penitentiary.

Burning my wings in the same fire from which I'm born
to follow the light to follow myself
burning my wings burning my fate
wouldn't you like to know why the wings of life fade
withered by our own tears burned by a faking grace
A failed grace...a failed grace <start> The line of broken streetlights lit a faint shadow.
And smoke hung in the air like a welcome note to an old friend.
Tonight it seemed that even the blackest of hearts could grow
and that morning was a distant memory.
So let's free this poisoned land
burn it down like a house of cards.
Before the last thread disappears the last memory erased. <start> Consumption of flesh as dead tissue is uncreated Rancid smoke effervesces as
your torpid corpse is cremated Another inert mutilated mess is sent up in
flames An expedient way to obscure the facts figures and names... Flames
unmake flesh and bone as all semblance of life is erased Ensuring ashen
anonymity for my dusty victims untraced Bellows belch forth the stench of
roasted human game As the torso is engulfed in a torrid rush of flame...
Human kindling to burn And then scrape into urns Burnt to a crisp Another
name scratched from my list... After fulfillment of the sadistic whims to
which I aspire Their existence is expunged in the searing burst of fire As
other truncated stiffs await the flames in a torpor My nose is beset with the
reek of blazing corpses... Entrails eradicated by the scorching furnace blast
The blistering temperature leaves you a thing of the past Sweltering in
incandescence as you blister boil and reek Seething in flames as your
complexion turns ashen gray and bleak... Beyond recognition your liquefacted
body is now molten slag Your charbroiled remans are scraped up in ziploc body
bags Nothing to mark your birth life or death Smelted scalded and singed
til there's none of you left... Human broiler pan As flames I fan Cremated
husk Return to dust... <start> Kill your enemies
My brothers dead around me
Wounds are hurting
Death is creeping for me
Smoke is blinding
Hearts are pounding
Chaos soon ignites
The call is made
Its one for all
Will I meet thy maker
Over the top over the top
Right now it's killing time
Over the top over the top
Right now it's killing time
Over the top over the top
Right now it's killing time
The only way out is to die
God has spoken through his conscience
As I scream aim and fire
The death toll grows higher
God has spoken through his conscience
As I scream aim and fire
The death toll grows higher
Fuck this battlefield
The bullets shatter round me
Bodies falling
Voices calling for me
Limbs are flying
Men are crying
Such a hurtful sight
The call is made
It's one for all
Take no prisoners
Over the top over the top
Right now it's killing time
Over the top over the top
Right now it's killing time

Fire <start> Cold obscurity falls on me
Into my soul the winter to return
Whips of the storm shivered i hear
I waited for you but you didn't come
Monotomy of misterious stars
Hit a nail to the coffin of dusk
My soul has crashed down under the beats
Just the loneliness gives shelter to me
A not happened embrace a not happened kiss
One face what charms me in the dark
My knees hit the floor it was a moment only
I'm sleeping i will wake up somewhere else
I can't smell the scent anymore
That her skin breathed above silk pillows
Chorus
I hate when i feel
That the world
Turns its back on me...
And just the loneliness
Gives shelter to me
I feel that the wild burning desire
Is calmed by the steps of happines
The bright shinning rising sun is nice to me
When the first ray comes and rests by my side
Bride of darkness stood before me
Between walls and doubts
Chorus
I hate when i feel
That the world
Turns its back on me...
And just the loneliness
Gives shelter to me <start> What erased this scenery
So that I could fancy ridicule over pity
And enrace whatever mocked the sky
Two hands made these hearts
That trembles before me
My loss of grace

I link the two
In my heretic poetry
Rain falls silently
I am the portal
A layer of dust
A burdened insect that betrayed their lust
I licked their wishes in reverie
And soaked their crystal trust
What screamed so annoyingly
That made you rush through these  coherent purgatories
Gloves and masks are these eyes
To stare so awfully
At my malignant heresy
A rat conducted the angels
To sing hysterically
Songs that whipped their wings
And opened walls of gloss
Rain falls abruptly <start> On wings of tomorrow we're coming to fly
Erasing the sorrow and this is the place where you die
We're shaking the chains off the world of today
We're coming to get you no matter what you're gonna say
This is the time of the ending
It's the dawn of a new world order
This is a new beginning
Where a new world shall arise we scream
On the wings of yesterday you're gonna die
And you know it's gonna be  we're screaming
This is illumination  we are
We are illuminates  beware
This is illumination  we are
We are illuminates
We live inside society our presence is unknown
We plot and we manipulate you to which way to go
Illumination comes across the world to bring an end
Intimidating silent force that puts us in command
This is the dawn of the ending
It's the time of a new world order
This is a new beginning
Where a new world shall arise we scream
On the wings of yesterday you're gonna die
And we know it's gonna be  forever
This is illumination  We are
We are illuminates  Beware
This is illumination  We are
We are illuminates
In the darkness we shall await
Prepare for changes to seal your fate
This is illumination  We are
We are illuminates  Beware
This is illumination  We are
We are illuminates <start> You know its midnight
And the evil apears in the dark
You try to sleep to scream
But my terror takes your breath befor you make it
I'm the prince of darkness the mighty force that keeps you awake
Because i'm your nightmare

And the evil apears in the dark

Flee from false
I have tasted the weight of lust
My hands on the skein of height
A pallid death
Mirage into dark
The horizons echo your glance
Following a detractive sleep
I am the wrath beneath the heavens

Fallen into the vision of effect
Quiet as gods can be

Orgies of fear
Inbreeding and death

And saw it's petrified fall

But carried another life

Wrong decissions running through my veins.
Immortal sorrow scars on my soul.
Rejected and trapped in myself.
Black velvet was the gift of the time.

Hiding behind shadows of anger.

From the grave <start> Darkened necropolis midnight sharp nobody else will see
A six foot dig open the casket there she waits for me
Her lifeless body cracks and splinters as I start to raise her
In eagerness I carry on in lust for my Stargazer
Deterioration rotting flesh violation of a fossilized wench
A degrading thought to seduce a corpse dry reaching from a horrid stench
Parting the thighs a sickening crack festering hole open wide
Enter my partner close my eyes so cold and dry when inside
Ignore the sounds that fill my head the crunching of flesh as I thrust
Sweat profuses my body bare driven by bizarre lusts
Run my tongue across her mouth formaldehyde I taste
Dislodge my member from her hole and head below the waist
As I feast between her thighs her throat emits a deafening cry
A filthy claw grabs my head's back and rams it up her rotting crack <start> The first flush of youth was upon you when our eyes first met
And I knew that to you and into your life I had to get
I felt lightheaded at the touch of this stranger's hand
An assault my defenses systematically failed to withstand
'cause you came at a time
When the pursuit of one true love in which to fall
Was the be all and end all
Love is only a feeling

When I'm in your arms I start believing

But love is only a feeling
Anyway
The state of elation that this unison of hearts achieved
I had seen I had touched I had tasted and I truly believed
The the light of my life
Would tear a hole right though each cloud that scudded by
Just to beam on you and I
Love is only a feeling

When I'm in your arms I start believing

But love is only a feeling
Anyway
Love is only a feeling

And we've got to stop ourselves believing

'cause love is only a feeling
Anyway <start> I'll give you space as you chain me down
I won't let go but you'll let me fall
I'll see your way as you avoid mine
I'll give in so you can walk on me
I'll close my eyes so you can sew them shut
I'll keep the faith or you'll crucify me
If I can believe then you'll believe in me <start> music  lyrics Tobias Sammet  Jens Ludwig
I am the madness carrying the torch
Lighting the wheat in your fields
I am the eyes staring out of the dark
I am the war of your yields
When you give response away I grow
I am more of you than you might know
Burning down burning down
It's a story of deceivers
Burning down burning down
Put the blame on the unbeliever
I am the vision that comes to your mind
When you denounce without regret
God is the word in the bible you say
I am the word that you spread
When you give response away I grow
I am more of you than you might know
Burning down burning down
It's a story of deceivers
Burning down burning down
Put the blame on the unbeliever
I'm born and I lead the weak into the fire
No more pain is what you claim
While you have found your wicked desire
Hahaha...
Burning down burning down
Put the blame on the unbeliever
Burning down burning down
It's a story of deceivers
Burning down burning down
Put the blame on the unbeliever
Burning down burning down
It's a story of deceivers
 <start> Now I'm gonna tell ya a story
A tale of wrong and right
And freedom is the reason
You can't take it without a fight
So now I'm startin' up a posse

To come and look for you
We're gonna put a stop
To what you want to do
You fucking whores 
That's all you are
You say our records are offensive

Our messages ain't right
You say we're gonna label records
So our kids can grow up right
You fucking whores 
That's all you are
Shit fuck satan death sex drugs rape
These seven words you're trying to take
Shit fuck satan death sex drugs rape
Right or wrong it's our choice to make
America the beautiful land of the free
Don't change the words to land of hypocrisy
Now I'm startin' up a posse 
And we'll damn sure make you see
Something that offends you
May not be offensive to me
You fcking whores 
That's all you are
Now you might take offense
To a word like fuck or shit 
But you fuckin' don't have the right 
To discriminate me for saying it
You fuckin' whores 
That's all you are
So now I'm startin' up a posse 
To fight for freedom of choice
To fight for freedom of speech
We're gonna make you hear our voice
And now I don't do this to shock you

I don't do this for spite
You've got the choice don't buy it don't read it
And don't say your opinion's right
You fcking whores 
That's all you are 
You know you can't censor my feelings
You can't censor my thoughts
Censorship's against
Everything america stands for
You fuckin' whores 
That's all you are  <start> What is this death wish we impose on ourselves
Apparently endless display of ill intentions
Look See how far we've come
Global insemination of our practice fucking the masses
We're coming to kill you
Your name is engraved on the knife
Reaping controlling absorbing your life
Look How we've locked ourselves in a selfmade hell from
Which there is no redemption
Through the rise of technology we lost our humanity
Trash heap lobotomy selfimposed sodomy
We are undertakers rapists and future failures
Inter the world with our filth from day one
Should have been killed
We rise to the slaughter
 Of the essence of our being
A species that boasts of overdose
That takes pride in deriding all other forms of life
Even our own
The advent of technology beginning the disease
There is no survival when we are liable for everything that is
Wrong in this world
The lifestalker
Reaping controlling absorbing the
Essence through only our presence
We must be stopped
This is suicide
This is how we die
This is the end of life
The ouroboros
This hill of compost grows by our own gross
Mistakes and the demands that we've made
Execute the life stalkers
Damn us
Kill us
Suck us dead <start> Use your wise head
Use your wise mind
It is not bad
Test immagination
Check your big brain
You won't feel pain
I think you won't fade so...
Anybody home
I got something new what you can use
You you gotta try I do not lie
Don't you feel bad
I can scream help
Your face is red maybe you wanna pray
This way isn't mine
You've got to try
You will feel fine so... <start> Curtains
Steady this won't hurt a bit
I promise this won't hurt a bit
Close your eyes for the fist time
Pray to your god and gorgive me
forgive me father for i have sinned
the streets will run red
no one knows what goes on behind closed eyes
no one knows what goes on behind those eyes
Highlight this valley
The fire will burn us both <start> ...Her eyes...
Bad fat stinking rainy day
I met woman on my way
She said she knows truth
You must know it god bless you
Then she takes my hand and says
I see evil in your face
You're not fuckin'man my boy
You are hunter so destroy
. UUU <start> Instrumental <start> Welcome inside this coil
Mortal and proud complicated gear
This diligent sweat smelt black toil
Barren and vain in it's petty fears
Night comes down and captures them all... fall
Now in this noiseless dark air
Sparks are glares and rustles are dins
While the warm wind is swaying my hair
A fright inauspitious begins
Here under this omniscient still
Something intensely grows
No sound just thrill
Night bird of prey who gazed below
In menacing shape savagely
Up on an eminence quickly saw
Prey that slept in it's fantasies
Then apace
Domineering one
Finished the chase
Exulting in grim fun
And flew to let the sun...
Daylight gifted the rays of truth
Rushing suddenly like a flood
All the fowlers knew none of course
They saw no traces but the blood
A trifling trifling epitaphic loss
For those protecting life
And for those
Endless those who raise the Christian Cross
Against Conqueror Night <start> Mother's milk has soured
My life's a bolted door
And from it runs
A trail of vagrant gore
My wounds are open flowers
Fragrant gifts for my encore
Bouquets of praise for bleeding towered
On the sacrificial floor
I summoned and you came
To the peel of twisted bells
To the gelid whisper of my name
I blanched erotic danger
Had me whirling like a star
To the dark advance of strangers
And then I heard you laugh
A throat of broken glass
Leather stitched to weeping skin
A coat of death and suppuration
Be my truth and agony
An architect for my total destruction
My erector my dissector
My flesh will be wet for your best seduction
Be my truth and agony
Inventive and deranged
Loves proof is in its plain to see
The fluids we've exchanged
Part of these soul killers
The Gestapohood of scars
Carved an ornate invitation on my heart
The scent of French vanilla
With the stench of abattoirs
Past tense of present lay things
On those stained red lips ajar
I summoned and you came
From the churning guts of hell
With your Christmas hiss of chains
Down the endless centuries
Your torture bed of lust
A shrine for us to redesign
And sign in blood and rust
Be my truth and agony
An architect for my total destruction
My erector my dissector
My flesh caressed by your best corruption
Be my truth and agony
Inventive and deranged
Love's roof is in it's meant to be
My cells are rearranged
I suffered and you came
To the splintering of bones
Winning pinnacles for my pain
Raped and racked and mutilated
I raised from dregs again
Autopsyturvy back elated
In brazen arms that sacked my veins
Skinnatra take me to the stars
Thrust me through to paradise
Endorphins breaking fast
Creature from the black abyss
Teacher sadomasochist
Your tortured soul has led me
To this altered state of bliss <start> Cut him
Somebody take flight from this stage to the crowd below
And expose a bloody nose from the the flows of your elbows
No crowd control
This is no holds barred we gonna brawl
Until you knocked out sprawled
In your socks and draws with the paramedics involved
Engage the mosh pit and lose control until the stage fold
Because bionic ain't leaving until you suffocatin' in the front row
I wanna see shoulder blades ricochet off the ribcage
This is new age stress age for boogie down renegades in rage
You wanna body bang this is insane
War games with nothing to gain but pain
If you ready for war then hit the the floor everybody come on
You're in the swarm you're in the swarm
You wanna bang let's go bring the pain let's go
You hit 'em high high I hit 'em low low
If you ready for war then hit the the floor everybody come on
You're in the swarm you're in the swarm
You wanna bang let's go bring the pain let's go
You hit 'em high high I hit 'em low low
This section is reserved for those hard to kill
So shove him in his chest hard enough to turn his lungs to gills
Dislocate your shoulder is the quota
These blows send your head to nova scotia
When animalistic impulse take over
Mosh monster behold the head trauma get down
No do si doe this is the true essence of the underground
From sunshine or rain we toss on asphalt terrain
Till we levitate over the crowd with your eye balls gouged
You wanna body bang this is insane
War games with nothing to gain but pain
If you ready for war then hit the the floor everybody come on
You're in the swarm you're in the swarm
You wanna bang let's go bring the pain let's go
You hit 'em high high I hit 'em low low
If you ready for war then hit the the floor everybody come on
You're in the swarm you're in the swarm
You wanna bang let's go bring the pain let's go
You hit 'em high high I hit 'em low low
I'm goin' insane
I feel the temperature rise but can I maintain
All the pushin' and shovin' it's like we gang bang
It's a thin line between livin' and dyin'
I'm goin' insane
I feel the temperature rise but can I maintain
All the pushin' and shovin' it's like we gang bang
It's a thin line between livin' and dyin'
You wanna body bang this is insane
War games with nothing to gain but pain
You wanna clash with it We can clash with it
And see who be the last man to stand with it
If you ready for war then hit the the floor everybody come on
You're in the swarm you're in the swarm
You wanna bang let's go bring the pain let's go
You hit 'em high high I hit 'em low low
If you ready for war then hit the the floor everybody come on
You're in the swarm you're in the swarm
You wanna bang let's go bring the pain let's go
You hit 'em high high I hit 'em low low <start> If this world is wearing thin
And you're thinking of escape
I'll go anywhere with you
Just wrap me up in chains
But if you try to go alone
Don't think I'll understand
Stay with me
Stay with me
In the silence of your room
In the darkness of your dreams
You must only think of me
There can be no in between
When your pride is on the floor
I'll make you beg for more
Stay with me
Stay with me
You'd better hope and pray
That you make it safe
Back to your own world
You'd better hope and pray
That you'll wake one day
In your own world
Cause when you sleep at night
They don't hear your cries
In your own world
Only time will tell
If you can break the spell
Back in your own world
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay stay with me
Stay stay stay stay stay

I can't hear and touch and see
But I feel it
Though I can't believe it
A master of the observation
Coming up with an explanation
There's no need
Making use of the spirit
We can give you answers you are dying to receive
Keep on dreaming
Keep on screaming
yeah
You might be getting too much for your beating hart to take
Your flesh is malice
Prepare your chalice
Lights
breathe and sleep tight
Will you defy intriguing ghostlights
Seeing through all lies and foolish warnings
There ain't no return
Never light the darkness
It may burn your soul away
As you've been seeing
What you've thought you're dreaming
Never open doors if you don't dare to walk on through
It Maybe your vault
Now it's all your fault
Light
You're off to the light
Will you defy all evil ghostlights
Tell the truth from decoration
Time
Don't waste no time
Prevail against the hands that tick your flesh away
Now delve into your own reflection
Ohhh know that's where I've been to
There's nothing but a void
Out for the sanity of fools
Shine your light into the darkness
And let the storm descend upon you
And I will make you mine
Shine your light into the darkness
Behold and let aurora fall upon you
Oh Let the storm descend upon you
A Journey to the other side
Or just a tripping pleasure ride
And I don't know
But does it really matter
I am he who's always been
Who dares them though I can't be seen
I'm illusion or truth
I'm confusion
Light
Bring me the light
I will bring out uncertainty on a silver plate
Like a mantle piece
I will wipe out darkness
Light
Blessed is the lie
Till there's no time left to spill
To save and kill
To take and seize
You just drift along
Are they reflections of some crazy dream
Or maybe the backside of reality
Shine your light into the darkness
And let the storm descend upon you
And I will make you mine
Shine your light into the darkness
Behold and let aurora fall upon you
Let the storm descend upon you
You gotta pray your God ain't just a ghostlight
You gotta pray you won't be falling down the wayside
Let it carry you away
Cut the gem until it's purified away
The candle burning to the ground
I don't see nothing but addiction to the ridee
Kindles everything around
For all the world we'll see it tower to the stars
And all is melting into one
We give them something to fall back on everytime
They're too strung out to run
Every moment every heartbeat every breath
Leaves you one less to your last
Still you cherish every second of the game
Give me the future you take the past
And what if God is just an image in the mind
A reflection of the will
And what's the matter with a lie you live in harmony with
Falls second for the drill
I pray the lord ain't just a ghostlight in my mind
a reflection of the will
Let the storm descend upon me
Let aurora fall upon me
Let the fire fall upon him
Let the fire purify him
Never judge a thing you see
It's only what your mortal eyes will want it to be
Ohhh bring it on
Let the dark inhale the confusion
Spit out a conclusion
Are they reflections of a memory
Or just reflections in a crazy dream
Shine your light into the darkness
And let the storm descend upon you
And I will make you mine
Shine your light into the darkness
Behold and let aurora fall upon you
Shine your light into the darkness 
And let the storm descend upon you
And I will make you mine
Shine your light into the darkness 
Behold and let aurora fall upon you
Oh Let the storm descend upon you 
Ohhh descend upon you yeah. <start> The selfmutilation
Necrosis of the soul
Dark is the shadows of life
Hot as Hell
You take the matters into your own hands
From now on it's downhill
A single candle burns 
In the vast consuming darkness
Uplifting like a funeral
Through these years you were created
In the void between life and death
A shimmering blade shreds through his flesh
At the peak of his night  time bliss
Misanthropes kings and queens
And a painful vision of Hell
It burns
The blisters on your hands
So nebulous dark as December <start> I swear this time is real I swear this time is real
Stood back and took some copious notes
Observation lent some truth evaluated where I stand
Dove into the midst of what I would never want to be
I'd rather drown than breathe
In what the world expects from me
And I swear this time is real
I know this time is real
Look over the other side of the fence
Of this thing called life
Let me show you how it's done
All resistance hesitance checked at the door
No just one more time
Leave all that behind
Full steam ahead
No hesitance all resistance dedicated life
Steamroll this life
Pave the way through your old ways
Force the mind into another path
Just once this time
Just once this life
With nothing in vain
I took the road less traveled upon
Sorted out what didn't belong
Running through this life
Sorted out what didn't belong
No party line to string me along
Running through this life
Stretched this life apart
Running through this life
I took the road less traveled upon
Thirty years and going strong
With nothing in vain <start> For every child
Touched by her tainted tongue.
For every orgasm
That's reached my ears.
For every night
Children lay to dream of her lust
She'll be fucked to death.
Get fucked to death
That fucking bitch
Is gonna pay
She's heartless
She's empty
She's hollow.
I shoved a vacuum through her cnt
But nothing came out.
She can crawl into my bed
but she can never crawl into my heart.
I'll be the last thing
she sees before she dies.
She's the destroyer of hope. Turning wet dreams
into nightmares.
What's been etched into our skin will be transposed upon her
as I tear at her flesh and rip that fucking slut.
Tear at her flesh
rip that fucking slut
Tear at her flesh
Rest in piece
that fucking slut.
She's buried  feet closer to hell.
She fucked to the grave.
Dig a ditch
and bury the bitch. <start> Perpetuate the sin of the fifth nothing is holy nothing is sacred begging the demons to surge kiss them on the mouth as the martyr is forgotten ascension through sacrilege forgotten benediction glorify embrace as all the angels in heaven weep take me away from here a man most abhorred to the gods my fists clench teeth grit I have witnessed your saviors demise I have watched you slice his throat and I have laughed bathe in infamy lust hypocrisy wretch <start> Are we left all alone
Mother has no time but she cares for me
And she cries all the tears
I am joining now the river flow
I am three days old
Now the time has come you have to be a man
I don't want to destroy
The only chance I have to survive down here
The wind blows I'm so scared
And the waves so big I'm not prepared
I will have to be strong
But for now I cry all the tears
Now enter the storm and feel electric sword
My entire life is about to burn
I am struggling life is illusion
But I keep the dream of a better time
This secret knowledge I receive from where I am
So precious the treasured icons
Extended to this point forget the ones that hurt
They all want they struggle they fight and try to dry their tears
We're all left on our own
We are bound yet by each others lives
Now I'm leaving this world
I will never forget the river flow
The pains and traps of life
I put my scars away and love
I have to face the truth of living
I left my boat behind I am not taking it
Where I go I won't be crying I die <start> dig through the dirt
where I now lay
see the penance
that I now pay
I'm alive in the devil's hatred
where nothing is sacred in me
now kiss the throne
of fist and bone
my apathy invades you
my holy will to be
I'll suck the life out from you
and bring you to your knees
I am the blistered one
the man undone the prodigal son
I  am faceless
I  am soulless
I  am faceless
I  am you
project me deep inside of you
and I will run through you
I am the voice that pulls you down
so profound it leaves you bound
my apathy invades you
my holy will to be
I am purified inside
I am dignified
I am sanctified
purified... dignified... sanctified... crucified
I  am faceless
I  am soulless
I  am faceless
I  am you <start> 
I saw my problems and I'll see the light
We got a lovin' thing we gotta feed it right
There ain't no danger we can go too far
We start believin' now that we can be who we are  grease is the word
They think our love is just a growin' pain
Why don't they understand It's just a cryin' shame
Their lips are lyin' only real is real
We stop the fight right now we got to be what we feel  grease is the word
Grease is the word is the word that you heard
It's got groove it's got meaning
Grease is the time is the place is the motion
Grease is the way we are feeling
We take the pressure and we throw away conventionality belongs to yesterday
There is a chance that we can make it so far
We start believin' now that we can be who we aregrease is the word
Grease is the word is the word that you heard
It's got groove it's got meaning
Grease is the time is the place is the motion

This is a life of illusion lack of control
Laced with confusion  what're we doin' here
We take the pressure and we throw away conventionality belongs to yesterday

Chorus <start> From grace she fell beneath the ashes
That forced her to her knees
Cut her open wide
To bleed her body dry of feeling
The wounds the wounds will form no scars only memories..
Tearing at the scars she's open wide
Screaming 'til her lungs collapse

Behind her cold and vacant eyes
Her innocence that dies inside..
Dies inside
The tears that line her face..
The anguish
The lies she'd fed herself
Closing loveless eyes
To bleed her body dry the feeling
Of breath escaping lips closing lifeless eyes
Tearing at the scar she's open wide
Screaming 'til her lungs collapse

Behind her cold and vacant eyes
Her innocence that dies inside..
Dies inside
She dies inside
She dies inside
She dies in
Tearing at the scar she's open wide
Screaming 'til her lungs collapse

Behind her cold and vacant eyes
Her innocence that dies inside..
Dies inside
Tearing at the scars and now she's open wide
A broken bitter heart that's stained in black
Behind her cold and vacant eyes
Her innocence that dies inside..
Dies inside <start> iganme bien esto es para ustedes
Hermanos pobres y pinches greudos
Estos versos son tuyos no de gabachos
Los que no entienden aprenden
Greudos locos la cuidad te odia
Greudos locos rata humana
Greudos locos prenden un leo de mota
Hecho en Mxico aprendan coyones
Que tienen miedo de todo
Toca este disco si tienes huevos
El radio vale madre la msica mama verga
Greudos locos el pas te odia
Greudos locos rbate este disco
Greudos locos traga pisto y tequila
Porque tienen miedo greudos sin huevos
Canta lo que quieres y chinga los viejos
Mierda nortea rockeros maricones
Porque buscan a los estados unidos

HeyHo let's go  I give my fears a blow
Should I wait
Should I suffer
It hurts way too long
Cannot forgive you anymore
The pain is slowly killing me.
The glas is broken and I will fly
Far far away
To a mountain you'll never know.
I will be free.
I spread my wings and breathe the air
I will be free
I get back to myself
I will be free. <start> Kiss your curves touch your skin
Feel so soft so smooth
Let me begin to make love to you
Candlelight not so bright oh so right
To set a scene between me and you...
I wanna be alone with you
Not on this phone with you
Stuck in this hotel room
I can't eat I can't sleep baby
I wanna be alone with you
Not on this line to you
In a different time zone to you
It's no use I refuse to be here...
I need to show you've got to know
There's no escape I'm in a state
I can feel the walls closin' in
If you were here I don't think
I would feel the same
Coz being apart's the start of the
Emptiness that I feel...
I wanna be alone with you
Not on this phone with you
Stuck in this hotel room
I can't eat I can't sleep baby
I wanna be alone with you
Not on this line to you
In a different time zone to you
It's no use I refuse to be here... <start> When the sun is rolling
Over the horizon
That I can almost touch it
I reach out my hand for the light
That lets my heart chant
I have the feeling like being torn apart
When my pleasure and desire meet
Cries crawl up my throat but
My mind tells met to swallow
Let me enjoy these moments
Until the last second is gone
Until the clouds have come
'Cause they'll take it all away
This sweet passion that you feed
What tenderness a mind can feel
Each time you hit a nail
Into my hand
I want to beg for another <start> I've lost my battle before it starts
My first breath wasn't done
My spirit's sunken deep
Into the ground
Why am I alone
I can hear my heartbeat
Silence's all around
See hat will rise
So don't come closer
Fear your child
Born with a king's heart
But fate fooled me
And changed my cards
No one asked if I want it
If I like it
Pain inside is rising
I am the fallen one
A figure in an old game
No Joker's on my side
I plunged into misery
I'll turn off the light
And murder the dawn
Turn off the light
And murder the dawn
Nothing else
But laughter is around me
Forevermore
No one can heal me
Nothing can save me
No one can heal me
I've gone beyond the truth
It's just another lie
Wash away the blood on my hands
My father's blood
In agony we're unified
I never wanted to be
What they told me to be
Fulfill my fate then I'll be free
God knows how long
I tried to change fate
Pain inside is rising
I am the fallen one
A figure in an old game
No Joker's on my side
I plunged into misery
I'll turn off the light
And murder the dawn
Turn off the light
And murder the dawn
I plunged into misery
I'll turn off the light
And murder the dawn
Turn off the light
And murder the dawn <start> Pink press threat

I am you.
If I am you no life is sacred in my hands.
If I am you no love will prosper in this world.
If I am you I am the faith to end all faith.
If I am you you shall not live to save yourselves.
I bring no God no after world.
I am no more than a lie.
I live your life not for you.
I am a throne made from dust. <start> Nobody is perfect but I'm pretty fucking close
And I'm here to give you all a heavy heavenly dose.
I think you better listen 'cause I know who you are
And I think that you should treat me like a superstar
Because I'm more than just a human I'm the gift to all of you
And I'm here to make sure that my message gets through.
I wonder if you're really all as dumb as you look
Or are you smart enough to learn the rules in my book.
I hope you understand that the knowledge I bring
Puts me in the position of a god or a king
'Cause I'm blessed with the gift of the magic touch
And I wouldn't say that I'm asking for too much.
All you have to do is get down on your knees and pray
And I promise you the remedy is on its way
But you can never be like me so don't waste your time
Because I reign supreme and my position is divine.
What's wrong with being selfpossessed
Nobody satisfied with being second best.
I've got the gift and I know that I'm blessed
And I've got to get it off my chest.
I'm the biggest
The best
Better than the rest
Better than the rest.
I'm the biggest
The best
Better than the rest
Better than the rest.
I'm the biggest
The best
Better than the rest
Better than the rest.
I'm the biggest
The best
Better than the rest
Better than the rest.
I'm not afraid of competition cause I know that I'm best
And you haven't got a chance to even pass my little test.
Even if you wanted to you couldn't pay the price.
There ain't no room for losers in my perfect paradise
'Cause life is always based upon the weight of your success
So I'll make sure that I get the most and nothing less
If I love myself then everyone will love me too
And there's nothing you can do for me that I can't do.
What's wrong with being selfpossessed
Nobody satisfied with being second best.
I've got the gift and I know that I'm blessed
And I've got to get it off my chest.
I'm the biggest
The best
Better than the rest
Better than the rest.
I'm the biggest

I'm the biggest

I'm the biggest

Better than the rest

So welcome to my kingdom and enjoy your little stay
Even if you can't afford it I'll still make you pay.
So you better come and get it and enjoy it while you can
Don't tell me that you're dumb enough to think I give a damn.
I couldn't care less about what you achieve
And there's only one thing that you have to believe
The only thing important that you have to understand
Is that no matter what you say it's still a god I really am.
I'm the biggest
The best
Better than the rest
Better than the rest.
I'm the biggest

Better than the rest.... <start> For what it's worth there's nothing I have learned
I've seen a thousand wars
Desperate cries filled up my ears
sorrowed lands drowned in tears
Prechorus
There's no love in soulless man
we are torn apart like slaughtered lamb
Who possess the power in the final hour
Who will claim your soul
Covered in blood is the future of mankind
crystal ball tells it all
Prechorus
There's no love...
Chorus
Who is The One
who will you turn to
 when the day is done
who's The One you fear
The world is full of wise men and fools
Do as thou wilt choose one of our rules

because all in all we end up the same
pale and naked we wait for judgement day <start> No time for innocence
A child raised in hate
Scarred by violence
A youth betrayed
Mind raped and twisted
Ghosts will never fade
Traumatic awakening
Growth is decay
chorus
Psycho
Son of hate
Life is worth nothing
In tortured eyes
Empty surroundings
A word of lies
Wasted existence
Of one victimized
Life despised Life denied
Live through homicide
chorus
Triggered aggression
Destroy to purify
Violent catharsis
Apocalypse inside
Driven by the vision
Of those who die
Life despised life denied
Live through homicide
chorus <start> Across the northern seas we travel
The cold freezing winds will arouse us
Spells from a woman have sent us to the seas of avagon
Transformed by our mother we are
I am CuChulainn the warrior of Ulster
We'll search the lands to discover the Tir Na N'og
The sea god guides our ship to Ireland
The storms push us to the palace of Visnech
Our swords with fire are rising
Our axes with fire have risen
The call from the silver horn to Visnech splits the air
Warriors answered the horn behind the western lands
Hoofs and steel hammered past the cries beyond the thorned hills
Acknowledging the commands from the king
Our play lies north to the path of Nite
And brings us upon the fortress walls where battles raged
Raise the magick hammer of Mjollnir
Your underworld of Annwvyn draws us through
Emer thy lucious woman I shall sleep with you
I kiss the naked skin of white
I lust your black hair my woman divine
I see a holocaust in your eyes


Feis Mor Tir Na N'Og
In the land of Visnech the darkness never sinks away
All will fall upon the southern steel yet behind the burning fires
Now we bathe at the bleeding coast
while women laugh with the Gailant knights
How sad is it to see my father's fallen halls
Can I feel the pure blast from the frigid winds
I awake the gods Epona Cernunnos and Lugh
Yes I'm CuChulainn warrior fo Ulster
In order to worship with fire and sword
The storms shall force us to the palace of Visnech
Cold cold how cold are the plains of Lugh
You should ask thy Emer to reply
We've finally found the last paradise
It remains in the light of Tir Na N'Og
With the hand of Ler Irish Sea god
We shall complete our long excursion <start> I stick to my sheets like failed reproduction
Soaking up on slowing down and the only thing
worse than being alone is when I'm not alone.
I am in love with what I've lost.
I do not want what I have got.
I release my weakness that flies feed from.
It never is anything until it's over.
Nothing is right but I can't find the wrong.
I always change my mind.
And if there is a need then I need it now.
Cause the closer we get the further I feel.
All of my love is collecting dust.
I'm shivering with loneliness.
An uncomfortable routine of staying
somewhere in between lost and found. <start>  centures ago
The last visitor from earth entered my world
Now its your turn to feel that pain
The gates are open
Painangerhatefearchaosdarknessevilhell
The gates are open
Gate  darkness the world of demons
Gate  my guards are watching you
Gate  only evil lives here

Now fight me again
Fight
And dance with the devil <start> mans fall a cause for my hatred
it turns to rage and is repressed inside
to hide inside
to strike me blind with my anger strickin with rage
but in me a passion dwells to give all that i have
i can no longer hide this hate for the world
i can no longer hide this hate for what you have done
you take your broken path but never expect me to follow
ill take your tired lies and shove them all back down your throat <start> Whispers of insanity bombard my rationale.
Aeons passed since I last did feel
The joy of my tears
Streamingin dissipation of sorrow.
The insidious beautyso quiescent.
Vehemencestronger still
...Yet dying....
...As yet another gorge
Fails to bleed.
I rub salt into mine open wounds
Scars healbut the flesh is then dead.
Pain spillsfrom my mind into my body.
Time expires
And I see what has passed.
Overspent in mourning.
Death came for me in years of past
And left me to live in death.
Life is given to us....obsolete.....
As the dust flewI smelt the ancient past.
From whence did I know what it is that I know
Or what it was that I knew
Time is the carrier of knowledge.
Much can be recalled in time....
...But in a moment.......
Knowledge becomes nothing
When faced with the propensity of time.
Once lost'tis lost forever.
So much to know 
The importance of truth is so much greater
And hidden amongst lies.
.....I am all which mocks virtue.....
Release the shackles of the flesh
What name must I bequeath 
Amidst the slumberI awaken the dream.....
Portals of obscurity burst forth into my eyes
As I plunge into the ascending chaos.....
I journey onthe lights dripping their luminescence.
Crossed dimensions imbibe me
I see allbut can do nothing but see.
....I roam....
I am enraged.
Inspired by my insanity.
These worldsunknown.
I cry for this solitude.
Is it mine fortune to have entered such visions
Canst I decipher the vision to words
Words cannot conceive.
I extol my journey through the vision of sound.
Imbibe thine mind if thou durst see
Travel betwixt the demented seas
....Reflect the journey....

MusicSteveWinterSpring  <start> Morbid Angel cover
A call to take your hand
For I'm at one with the dark
How dare you come for me
And again you must die
So ancient curse known to me
Behold the powers I unleash
Upon your throne
Know my words feel my hate descend
Lord of light
I will swarm against you now
Gods perverse
Wickeds at my side
Misery
Thorns to lance your every word
Nazarene
Now I crown you king in pain <start> Too late this is not the answer
I need to pack in
I can't pull your heart together with just my voice alone
A thousand shards of glass I came to meet you in
You cut the peace out of me
And as you ripped it all apart
That's when I turned to watch you
And as the light went on you went dark
I saw you turn to shadow
If you would salvage some part of you that once new love
But I'm loosing this
And I'm loosing you
And oh I've gotta turn and run
The places that you never see
Oh I've gotta save my blood
From all you've broken
And pack up these pieces of me
It's too late now to stop the process
This was your choice you let it in
This double life you lead is eating you up from within
A thousand shards of glass you pushed beneath my skin
And left me lying here to bleed
And as you showed my your scars
I only held you closer
But as the light in you went dark I saw you turn over
I wanted always to be there for you and close to you
But I'm loosing this
And I'm loosing you
And oh I've gotta turn and run
The places that you never see
Oh I've gotta save my blood
From all you've broken
And pack up these pieces of me
These broken pieces
Pack up these pieces of me
These broken pieces
Pack up these pieces
Maybe without me
You'll return to all the beauty I once knew
But if I stay I know
We will both be grabbed by your 
And oh I've gotta turn and run
From the faces that you never see
Oh I've gotta save my blood
From all you've broken
Pack up these pieces of me
These broken pieces of me
Pack up these pieces of me
These broken pieces of me
Pack up these pieces of me <start>  shots
Take a time to get cured
But time doesn't really matter
Trying to make your soul be pure
Time doesn't really matter
I need to get myself free
It's not important how it happens
As long as it's reality
Janis J. left me a note
I was downtown to see my shrink
And Kurt woke me up
To meet to smoke and sing
Even thought misery's calling
It's singing same old song
Pour me a glass of  proof
Can't be sober all day long.
My body's falling apart
I feed on Acidofilia
It's very dificult art
You better don't ask to heal ya.
What you dream is so important
Inside that bony head
Your heart just keeps on beating
Your desires are not dead
All around your dreams lay shattered
In your eyes that same old shine
You look in mirror seeing
Face a smile sublime
Bony Scott called me up
What Jim was heaving in the bin
I was in mortuary then
Wanted drink with him
Even thought misery's calling
It's singing same old song
Pour me a glass of  proof
Can't be sober all day long.
My body's falling apart
I feed on Acidofilia
It's very dificult art
You better don't ask to heal ya.
I feed on Acidofilia <start> My time was on your time if you were on your own time. Your sleep stole my mind.
A fear in circles through waiting around. But now it's over.
And we aren't always ourselves.
And even after it hurts worse we still make the same mistakes.
Burnt out on being burned and a broken heart always...
Just another empty night with nothing more to kill than time.
I fall in love too easily.
I reorganize myself into cliches to miss you.
With written onesided scripts of us talking to work out perfect in the end.
A divorce invented through window shops and dressed up girls playing games on circuit cables.
The loneliest cold year of sitting with myself and seeing you everywhere when you are gone.
Nothing is ever what it was. Nothing was ever like I thought. <start> Delusion.
Lost astray alone in darkness.
This loveless game of depression.
I still hear voices of you so bury me alive in this hole that you left for me.
Deny everything everything.
Shallow reaching out for your forgiveness.
Hopelessly I cannot see anything.
Now I must take myself.
Now I must take my life.
Now I must rip it back from you.
Now I must take my life.
Now I must take myself.
Now I must rip it back from you.
I've reached the final judgement.
Every thought and every second that you smile
it makes me choke it makes me bleed it was all lies.
Your smile makes me sick <start> Dog day sunrise
Every day of my life
I'm workin' on a scheme
Workin' overtime underground
Girls work under floors
The failures tend the moors
But once the seam is cut
They find out what is learned
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Drag your feet through hollow streets
Drag your feet through hollow streets
Drag your feet through hollow streets
Drag your feet through hollow streets

Don't want to let you go we just want to tell you
Just want to let you know that we'll stay around
So what else can you do you've said all you have to
We're comin' after you so don't make a sound 
I got this feelin' could it be there's someone watchin' over me 
Tell me who you are
I close my eyes and count from nine to try and find this peace of mind
But it's gone too far
You see our faces every time you turn your head round
We'll be watchin' even when you turn the lights down
We will always be around no matter where you are
Chorus
I'm all alone now in the dark just one chance just so we can talk
That is all I ask
I close my eyes and then I dream I always wake up to a scream
Wonder where you are
Don't you know we're always gonna be around you
And there really isn't anything you can do
We will always be around no matter where you are
Chorus
Chorus x <start> Misted windows
Hide your empty eyes
Every moment every whisper
Separates you from me
I've been screaming
Won't you let me in
Let me see a trace
Of the places hidden
Under your skin

I'll be one step behind you
Answer me
Till the day that you do

When you look away
And your silence
Sounds like deafening screams to me
I've been waiting
Won't you open your heart
And let me in
Please let me in

Watch them wheel her in
All she can see is white
face down on a mattress
hurry doctor young won't want to miss the party
Ankle films are back on cupid
a singing telegram slipped on some ice
we need a doc in radiology
inject an IV contrast
a patient named jones
BP's  over  BP's  over  pluse is 
Pupils fixed and dilated she's beginning to flat line
she's not going to make it
i can feel your heart stop
change the paddles to  CLEAR
we need a bandage to stop the bleeding <start> Now lost in darkness
A child of the night
Stalking the streets
In the pale moonlight
Your skin is warm and soft
While mine is white and cold
Come let me kiss you
Mysteries Unfold
I am beyond life
I am beyond death
I will take your life
I will take your breath
Come here my darling
I want you to hold
Come let me kiss you
Mysteries Unfold
We are dancing in fire
Embraced by the flames
We are kissing each other
We are kissed by the flames
And as i dive into oblivion
My mind is scattered in the wind
I drown in the sea of the lost louls
Lord Jesus won't come <start> I see you hand in hand
With my worst enemy
I can't show the anger
That I feel or the jealousy
About all I can do is watch
And wish that he hadn't caught
What I had my hands almost on
But now I'm so far gone
Envy I feel envy I feel envy I feel
I could end things really quick
With a bullet right to his head
But she was the one who left me
So I should get you both instead
But would I really be glad
To know I gave her the sack
And be in prison for life
Over foolish spite
Envy I feel envy I feel
Envy I feel no
Envy I feel envy I feel
Envy I feel
It's a waste envy I feel
To live with such haste envy I feel
For just a pretty face envy I feel
No more <start> Ich denke
ich dachte an diesen stark bezogenen Ort seine warmen gemasteten Arme
wie ringlos die Finger umspulten die Spindel wie zahlbare Jahre sein
Leben fur Muhsal und Wasser Glashals er mal an gezamt gezahlten
Flaschenpfropfen und klopfend er stand vor dem Tor wie schmachtend vor
Schemel und Webrad. Mein Kind fast mutig klang es es dreht um die
schnurrende Spindel sich leidlich ein Faden er schnellt seine Wege im
Kreis und hold bat den Menschen zu denken welch Einklang gegeben wenn
Leben ist Leben und beide sind tot. Ich sal vor dem Rad Weil ich spurte
zu weben wenngleich meine Finger umarmten die Spindel und ein Gewirke die
Hand besal gewarmt ich den Stuhl wo Serjoscha vor Tagen und Nachten
verschwand. Mein Kind und angstigend schon ich webte mein Leben und
kuhn mit Verstand versprach verlogen mich rein mit schummriegen Wachs am
Gewand doch bat ich zugegen nicht Wehleid zu darben wenn Zeiten mich
hegen die ich nich verstrich...
 Oktober  <start> Music by Marco KehrenDeinonychus Lyrics by Shane Davison
Let mother nature sweep me up in her infinite
arms
Let her carry my burden this sorrowful dirge
is to comfort her
Her sweet night lullaby will sooth my sadness
And I'll dream the passions once again for
all my dreams are but of her
And let the moon reside over us tonight like
embracing lovers
Its gentle solace warms me with its light
As giant trees shed their tears before my
path soft colours of cool Autumn nights
And I walk upon the thorns of roses spread
along my path
Blood leaves the innocence far behind and lets
the corrupt aggrandise
Tread this bloodiest path and you'll taste
her infinite love
Into the arms of mother nature and time
beyond.
Her feminine beauty surrounds us at all times
her hate is all I seek
And sheathed are those who are blind to her
darkness her hate is her love
She is always crying out for her children yet
our concious minds cannot hear her cries
My concupiscence for her is great
I am truly one of her cult a spitual one
Whose heart rests in melancholy...Forever the
word itself is etched in my skin
My feet are bloody from walking this path
My face hardened from all my loss
And my tears long dried up and no more tears
will I shed
I just keep walking in the night searching
for knowledge is the key to her wisdom
Into the arms of mother nature and time beyond
I bury myself deep in her bossom
And hold on all throughout the long night
Whilst the chorus of nature lulls me into
sleep and into dreams of the sullen
I'm so tired tired of being alone
I cry out to let her know of my desire she
will answer my call
To pass through into the dismal gloom of death
She will taste my blood tonight the sweet
taste of my blood
The hour of my demise has come the final hour
And the sun is close to dawning
I walk along the path weary and my feet
bloodied and sore
from the fragrant rose thorns underfoot
Deep into the woods
I take the knife and hold it out before my
eyes the gleam from the blade is frightening
And say my last goodbye I'm coming.
I cut deep into my flesh and watch the blood
run forth from my wounds
And fall to my knees when I see the light the
final light before the darkness
And I know I am one with her my mother
nature
And I shall go now into the arms of mother
nature and time beyond... <start> Cross the Triangle of Flames from Under a Funeral Moon
Engulfed in frost
I sailed our dreams
gloomy inner landscapes come to life
I am the wolf in the darkest scene
Phantasms sweep my role
I am Lucifer I bring you light and pride
Three steps for the white
A journey for the black
No flags for the tens lines
 I'll shoot you full of signs
In other dimensions
My visions grew black wings <start> Instrumental <start> I'm the harmony distorted
The jigsaw piece that doesn't fit
The uninvited one who's staying
It's all too sweet it makes me sick
Why rehearse the same old play
And ask forgiveness on our knees
Pray for long life keep on praying
Your mental wounds will never heal
I seem to remember the length of your life doesn't matter
What counts is the kick that you get out of it
If this was meant for me
Why fix what's broken on purpose
Skip the part of the regret
Time for sorry when I'm dead
No repentance
Just goodbye
No repentance
Just goodbye
If this was meant for me
Why fix what's broken on purpose
Skip the part of the regret
Time for sorry when I'm dead
No repentance
Just goodbye
No repentance
Just goodbye
Just goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye <start> Partir un jour sans retour

Breaching frontiers unlocking the gates
To a new world disorder
A fresh balance of terror the equilibrium of hate
All flesh entwined in the equality of pain
Archaic nescience unleashed
Entrenched a bitter legacy
Tempered in mental scars
All flesh entwined in mortal equality
Tangled mortal coil
Twisted and warped
Tangled mortal coil <start> Feverishly savouring my sordid charnel chore The rib cage and sternum I
frenziedly bore Skin flayed and stripped as your torso is wrecked A
grotesquely wrenched cavity now lays bare to dissect... A granular amorphous
mass is all that remains Of the peritoneum which enshrouds the rotted
stomach Tubucular enlargements extend across the abdomen The gnarled cheese
like clumps I now hack... Necrotic tissue converted to casein Omental bursa
caked and dried My dissection kit now quite bedaubed As I further sunder
your rotted insides... Blanketing the organs that once facilitated digestion
Transversing the dead bowels like an apron over the intestine... A dried
crepitated mound of viscera Innards desiccated during caseation I gouge and
excoriate my way through the guts Now ripped and mangled during
desecration... The disfigured gut now totally wasted I regard the disinterred
stiff with a smirk Decomposed dissected and dismembered I resplendently
admire my handiwork... <start> Flowers lift your precious head to me
I have come to her warm embrace
The gentle touch of surreality
A sweet kiss from beloved faith

Dancing with the statues in the pale moonlight
The velveret whisper at play with her hair <start> ...peace

a gun... <start> Come with the bloody moon and the chaos
Gog and Magog triple six reigns over spirits lost
Satanic nations and thrones reign and slay
But solid is supersouls love and righteous pathways
Asking me why I ain't down with the bloodshed
Wicked fool we approve of lies as eternal truth
Worship the mark of the beast demonic feast
Seven the seals sacred faith no need to pack steal
No Geedup rap anywhere up and on me
Strictly KRS Public Enemy Bob Marley
Mad ups to MLK and the infinite Ghandi
Doom to the demons that dominate all around me
Deep in the soul fool
You know you ain't right running around with your eyes shut tight
I know what it's like to not want to see the sunrise
So shattered the pictures on fire the winter never lies
But that chemical won't always keep the empty space full
Bludgeon corrode desecrate the body temple
Half the fools we know yes they sick style sprung
Deeper and further from ourselves I have always watched us run
From the family perspective yes I've watched the dope wreck shit
Deep Veteranos Tequatos fool this childhood knows
Deep in the soul
Fool you know you ain't right going around with them eyes shut tight
Further away from ourselves further away from the truth
You can throw the set in the sky
But the eternal majestic Mount Zion you can't deny
A gat a clip a hollowtip with your name on it
Loving to trip but one day you'll get caught up and slip
So cheap a death but my brother so precious is life

You do like Cain did Abel you love to watch your brother's blood
Flow fool tell me no spirit so cold Denial <start> Behold all the eyes shall see them
All wound that pierce them
Take pleasure in his sins
Take pleasure in her suffering

You shall die with the beast
Behold the eyes that pierce them
So you say your lord had mercy
So you say your lord has faith
Behold the eyes that pierce him
In this synagogue of Satan
Behold this seven spaces sewn
Behold the seven spaces known
Behold the seven spaces
Set apart beside the master's throne
 all good saviors go to heaven
Seven spaces sewn seven spaces known
Seven spaces set apart beside the master's throne <start> Go go away
Get away get away
Go away get away
Get away from me
These demons that I fight
Keep screaming back at me back at me
These skeletons in my closet
Keep screaming back at me they keep torturing
And these voices in my head
Will not leave me alone leave me alone
I will not die alone in this room
'Cause the hole in the middle
Keeps growing bigger and bigger
And I see the faces staring back at me
I see them contorting so I fight with my eyes closed
Afraid to see what awaits me at the bottom of this
Bottom of this deep black hole
Where are You
When the knife is at my throat
Where are You
When the knife is at my throat
Where are You Where are You
Where are You Where are You
Where are You You You
Where are You Where are You
God where are You
What will become of me
What will become of me
I guess Ill never know
What will become of me
Doubt fear desolation <start> Crown the impulse that deliberately fall
Defeat in spiritless action
Isolation  burn the greenwood
Order of the vertical path
Descendant
Crawl in the remnants of one thousand lies
Restaging
Torching a world that was left behind
Zodiackyl light
Cross the sharpest void
Deride the embers of his faith
The bringer that on million horses ride
Waiting for the call within the spark of sin
Ever reminiscent of the coming of storm
Can you see the cosmic face in which disorder lies
Burning of oppression
The inventor
Is the killing hand
Be that of the darkest sin
To frustrate hope and love
I shall not be blinded
I shall not be forced
Resistance
Feasting on debris from celestial wars
Burning in the sky
Beyond the realm of time
Sequence of the nucleus
The glowing dust in flight
Zodijackal light
And they ride they ride
The drama takes the lead
The beast of heaven their guide
Racing through the vastness
Constellation disarray
That darkness could not have existed
That bares no witness to the light
Sweet endless
Perpetually pronge through interior vaults
So seamless
Joints of time cannot shackle the beast
Zodijackyl light. <start> Instrumental <start> it's an instrumentalonly song no voice no lyrics <start> Death defying son of god
Twice you died in vain
No stronger than mortal
That made you relive your pain
And as the crown grows tighter around your head
you will die for our sins
As your own blood stings your eyes
Do you think you will ever win
Your grace shines through the peeling pain
and that will be your death
Damned by the damned
and cursed by the cursed
Deliver the kiss of poisoned breath
Infernal chanting forever after
Undying echoes of devils laughter
Selfchosen leader
You will die by your own hand
Cursed by the cursed
Damned by the damned
You'll be dethroned from your father
No longer god's son
Forever to be condemned
Forever banned you will be
Cursed by the cursed
Damned by the damned
Unblessed you wander with no help for your god
Unwanted in heaven
Unwanted below
So was it worth it
All the pain you suffered for your king
You sacrificed your life to the righteous one of his only son
The denial
The denial of you yeah
The denial of you yeah

Baptised in poisoned water

Lambs leading lambs to the slaughter
Damned by the damned
Damned by the damned
Damned by the damned
Damned by the damned <start> From the waste land
Cold steel under my waste band
Hazardous times
Enemy lines drawn in the middle the streets
The concrete's stained with blood
I still got to eat
When I hit the street I made the man understand
I fought with flesh and I bled like a man
I rode that edge of darkness my friend
Stood up to the enemy so life could begin
You know you got to
Back the fuck up
Back the fuck up

Back up of off me
Off of me
Off of me
Off of me
Back up back up
Traces of ignorance
Offense of hatred
The faces change in the same old places
Dark nights and lost souls
Collide to cross those
The line between a death and dream
I never wanted to lead your leash
To pull around your ton of grief
I'll come back with a fist of lead
To educate your mind with a blow to your head
You know you got to

Chorus <start> De la noche del viernes
al domingo por la tarde.
Fui enjaulado cual misto.
Sometido al amance.
Por legales de oficio
que mi aspecto al parecer.
Les result jodido.
Por metalero y pesado
Amansadora guacha de averiguacin.
Horas amargas del policial encierro.
Otros tantos conmigo
mastican el garrn.
Y buscan el olvido en la conversacin.
Horas perdidas que jamas tendran despues
Etapas de la vida

Con encerrar al rockero adolescente.
Cumplida es la orden por quien obedece.
Esta en las calles y su imagen es pura pasin.
No calza cao es presa facil de someter. <start> Is this what you want my heart on my sleeve
Is this my conscience making my heart beat
We are so over..
Is this what you call desperate
Well I'm desperate for you.
She's all I ever wanted and I'm just a face.
The truth will set you free.
Do you believe in love at first site
'Cause you look so graceful burning alive. <start> I cannot run from myself the man inside knows me well
Wearing thin wearing down my heart is bleeding out
My hands shake as I hold this weight
Of another hard molded face without a name
The reflection of myself goes much deeper within
So I bury the shame of my past underneath this old calloused skin
Will I ever see past the man in the mirror
Is it worthless for me to think that I will ever be anything
Rip off this facade of shame its haunting me
Break inside overcome myself break out of the mold
Throw down the cast of the world on the ground
The broken mirror before me the jagged glass at my feet
Ten thousand faces of uncertainty lay in the bed of defeat <start> Annihilation of our existence
Existing like species before us
The apocalipse is unescapable
Mimic of generations that past
Useless nerves reayd to feel
The infliction of life
The end of all <start> Can you hear the rolling thunder
pounding through the sky
gods revenge will always find you
when you hide in the night
there is no forgiveness for you
when you pray down on your knees
you've got to fight to fight the slavery
in the bad dimension heat
You've got wings
wings of an angel
yeah you've got wings
wings of an angel
To take you to the stars
to take you on your last fight
they're taking you so high
higher  higher  higher  higher  higher
taking you higher
taking you high
Then you meet the evil wizzard
to sell him heart and soul
you should escape from this dimension
before you're getting cold
there'll be no forgiveness for you
when you pray down on your knees
and when the angels sing of glory
you're lost in deepest haze
To take you to the stars
to take you on your last fight
they're taking you so high
higher  higher  higher  higher  higher
taking you higher
taking you high
Thunderbolts are striking
your sword with golden blade
you feel you bleed so badly
but you're fighting till the end
there is no forgiveness for you
when you pray down on your knees
and when the angels sing of glory
you're lost in deepest haze
You've got wings
wings of an angel
yeah you've got wings
wings of an angel
Wings of an angel
taking you high to the sky
Wings of an angel
so you can fight the slavery

Lyrics Sean Peck
Here we are asking again where is GOD 
It's breaking us down we're feeling so lost
In solitude why don't you explore a way that is new that shakes you to the core.
A resonating voice from afar
Listen very close to the stars and then never again will you fall.
What does it mean 
How does it know
It's the final solution.
Just when you think there is no place to go it's the final solution.
Clouded are minds of men
Where is GOD 
Some say we face diminishing odds
Celestial mechanics will restore
Human destiny will be reborn.
A resonating voice from afar
Listen very close to the stars and then never again will you fall.
What does it mean 
How does it know
It's the final solution.
Just when you think there is no place to go it's the final solution.
The secret of the zodiac lies within.
Living a life of sin where is GOD 
Darkest are things before the dawn.
The resurrection of your spirit is near
Feel its' evolution while you hear...
A resonating voice from afar
Listen very close to the stars and then never again will you fall.
What does it mean 
How does it know
It's the final solution.
Just when you think there is no place to go it's the final solution. <start> Last night alone I met the moon
I saw its halo and the love around
Now take the path don't ever lose your time
Just watch the light you have inside
I watched inside and my eyes burned
The moon was right
Roots so deep head so high
I want to be in and watch it out
I know the reasons why I failed
The stars illuminate my being
Behold thy servant you the force around
That makes the planets be <start> Smashing through the boundaries
Storming through the burning fields
Stand before the evil one
Look towards the morning sun
Falling under skies of pain
Soul is searching endlessly
Crashing over seven seas
Torture in the winter skies
Riding over plains of ice
Shadows in the fields of the slain
Crashing steel and raging fury
Smash the glass destroy the army
Crush the legions of the twilight
Give us our steel on the way
Cry far away as we reach for the day
Blasting our way through the punishment and the pain
Reach for the war as the sky begins to fall
Rising through the darkened ashes
We'll never see our world
Far away and ever onwards see the day
For today the everlasting eternal sun
Washed away the dreams of a brighter day
Forever hold the dream inside
The chance to fight another fight
The breaking hearts will stand for all our lives
With tonight woah woah
Watch you die I watch you die inside
While fate controls your life
And reject this animosity
That's piercing every mind
You feel the power do believe
The fear you hold inside
Choose to find a reason for the treason
Now you will be mine
Screams of pain are not the same
And rise again from hell defending
Power of hearts within the fire
Warriors of hell fear the slain
Rise through the pain
And the sun will rise again
Day after day but the memories never change
Stand before the storm as the last horizon falls
Riding on the wings of hell
The innocence of our souls
Far away and ever onwards see the day
For today the everlasting eternal sun
Washed away the dreams of a brighter day
Forever hold the dream inside
The chance to fight another fight
The breaking hearts will stand for all our lives
With tonight woah woah
Far away and ever onwards see the day
For today the everlasting eternal sun
Washed away the dreams of a brighter day
Forever hold the dream inside
The chance to fight another fight
The breaking hearts will stand for all our lives
With tonight woah woah
Yeah <start> You teach us what was
You teach us what was out there
You teach us what was
You teach us what was out there
Lift our limbs to focus
We soon drift through the night
Lift our limbs to focus
We soon drift through the night
The getaway
We drought the cloud of life
A quick escape to velvet
Start to drift in slumber
Smoke fills the velvet room
No more options to cope
A glimpse of the hanging rope
Madness embrace the vault
Cannot wait any longer
A string of lights blink
Mesmerize my senses
A pulse that keeps me together for one last time
No more options to cope
A glimpse of the hanging rope
Madness embrace the vault
Cannot wait any longer
A string of lights blink
Mesmerize my senses
A pulse that keeps me together
Lift our limbs to focus
We soon drift through the night
Lift our limbs to focus
We soon drift through the night
You teach us what was
You teach us what was out there
You teach us what was
You teach us what was out there
Travel through a string of tears
Screams crash down like waves
Flushing my mind of a new world
Climb the hill of the wrist enter oblivion
Oblivion
My last exhale
Knees crash down on
My last exhale
Knees crash down on
Now rewind
You teach us what was
You teach us what was out there
You teach us what was
You teach us what was out there

Vosotros siempre estis ah

Guitarras imaginarias
quemando vuestras manos
melenas al viento estn
sellando nuestra unin
Mecheros encendidos
en la oscuridad
llamas infernales
que me hacen vibrar
Unidos por el rock
Chicas y litros de alcohol

codo a codo trago a trago
gargantas en tensin
cada instante una sensacin

Vuestros puos en alto estn
sellando nuestra unin
mecheros encendidos

Unidos por el rock.
Unidos por el rock. <start> Power fortune and fame
Only a delusion inside your brain
But those who got it all
Fuckin' piss me off they got a lot of balls
To sit there and complain
That affluence is a tremendous strain
Use some common sense
Take nothing for granted not a fucking cent
A word to the wise you should realize
If you don't count your blessings you're in for a surprise
That you got it so hard but life dealt you all the cards
You better count your blessings you better let down your guard
A word to the wise when will you realize
If you don't count your blessings you're in for a surprise
The roles will be reversed and you won't be the first
To wish he counted his blessings
Substantial amounts
Of their money lies in Swiss bank accounts
And more in stocks and bonds
They should consider if it were gone
Just what the hell they'd do
They might have to work to pay for their food
Like every one of us
They'll count their blessings without a fuss
Power fortune and fame
Only a delusion inside your brain
But those who got it all
Fuckin' piss me off they got a lot of balls
To sit there and complain
That affluence is a tremendous strain
Use some common sense
Take nothing for granted not a fucking cent <start> People moving out
People moving in
Why Because of the color of their skin
Run run run but you sho' can't hide
An eye for an eye tooth for a tooth
Vote for me and I'll set you free

Well the only person talking about love thy brother
Is the preacher
And it seems nobody's interested in learning
But the teacher
Segregation determination demonstration integration
Aggravation humiliation obligation to our nation
Ball of confusion oh yeah
That's what the world is today hey
The sale of pills are at an all time high
Young folks walking 'round with their heads in the sky
Cities aflame in the summertime and oh
The beat goes on
Evolution revolution gun control sound of soul
Shooting rockets to the moon
Kids growing up too soon
Politicians say more taxes will solve everything
And the band played on
So 'round and around and around we go
Where the world's headed nobody knows
Oh great Googamooga can't you hear me talking to you
Just a ball of confusion oh yeah
That's what the world is today oh yeah yeah
Fear in the air tension everywhere
Unemployment rising fast the Beatles' new record's a gas
And the only safe place to live is on an Indian reservation
And the band played on
Eve of destruction tax deduction
City inspectors bill collectors
Mod clothes in demand
Population out of hand
Suicide too many bills
Hippies moving to the hills
People all over the world are shouting end the war
And the band played on
Oh great Googamooga can't you hear me talking to you
Sayin' ball of confusion
That's what the world is today hey
Let me hear ya
Let me hear ya

Sayin' ball of confusion

They reached the wall of no return  breeze has stopped
Who wore the crown will never be known might is broken
For all we'll drown into the sand what will remain
Inverted horizons denied truth and blinded eyes
The Titans arise the monuments fall we cannot halt
Wishful pleads at last came true some always knew
The clouds burn  or is it fire The gods wince
Human pride and megalomania
The Titans watched it all
The trace led to nowhere
Wrath had to come
As ushers at the gates
To ecstasy and excess
All turn their backs
They won't give us any rest
 fires won't redeem illuminated's the night  the eternal summer
When they came high from the sphere on shrieking wings
Now they're trapped to the ground to heat and dust
And the eye is glowing above <start> Boston hardcore closes its unsigned eyes
and pretends it's Aaron and Mark
sucking their fucking dicks. <start> What's the reason for our birthand death.
Why is there love
And why is there hate
Have I a place on Earth
Or is life only a dream.
Wake me up
My soul wanna' belive
Where's the peace
If wars still rage
What is life worth
If there areno dreams for a lond time
The past the future
Have alreadyintertwined
In your heart in your soul
You don't know the answer on your own
I live in mistery <start> Do you think you could learn
Do you think you could love
Do you think you could learn to love me
Do you think I can change
Do you think you would mind
Can I change your mind about me
We could spend the rest of our lives
Wondering what might have been
We could set aside our foolish pride
And fall in love
Again
I hope we could try
I hope you could trust
I hope you could try and trust me
Do you think you could ever 
Could you forgive
Do you think you could ever forgive me
We could spend the rest of our lives
Wondering what might have been
We could set aside our foolish pride
And fall in love
Again
We could take a leap of faith
Close our eyes and jump in
Find comfort in a familiar face
And fall in love again
We could spend the rest of our lives
Wondering what might have been
We could set aside our foolish pride
And fall in love
Again
And fall in love
Again <start> Take me home
Imitations surround me
You are all I want to see
So why do I turn
To embrace what will never last
All my life I've tried
All my life I've failed
And one day I will see
Surrounded on every side <start> No one can enter this sacred place
I am the Keeper of this Holy Ground
I master the Power I possess the Force
White lightning flashing from the sky
My magic will obscure the sun
I'll show you my Power I'll show you my glory

Gallery of meathook pierced clits
Provide a macabre view
Burning one retina
Chamber of clits is now revealed

Worshippers of sins sexual pride now put on display <start> Open the portals to darkness
So that the fire of hell
Will previal
Embrace the wicked beauty
Of the darkest instincts
Turn into a tender godess
And the ultimate queen of pain
Follow me on your left hand path
And discover my infernal reign
I will accompany you on
Your abyssic journeys
You will find the pleasure
..Beyond the pain
Be my innocent graceful virgin
Be my lusty gorgeous whore
Never question my power
Do not betray our flame
Deal with my insanity
Eternal you will reign
Oppressed by all gods of light
Adored by the disciples of night
Female soul and body
Finest piece of art
Cannot be god's creation
Bite the apple once more <start> I hate that scary face
in the mirror
Mutilated by your
daily terror
It keeps an eye
all the time on me
It's against the one
I want to be
Have I ever done something
to deserve this pain inside
How could I leave
this damn feeling behind
I can't live in uncertainty
My place I need to find
Will I ever get some rest
and peace in my life
What do I live for
I always want more
What would I die for
Someday you will know
Now prepare yourself
to a journey in me
Take a deep breathe
and sink into this sea
What causes this silence
Oh damn it is so real
I have many things to share
But life's too short to feel <start> Music by Marco KehrenDeinonychus
Instrumental <start> Instrumental <start> Sky is clear and the moon shines bright
The stars  through the trees
The night is black and the snow is white
All things seem to have defeat
The glowing eyes of animals around staring at me
The cold wind blows into my face
Like  does it see
Full moon shines  down
The day shall never come
My tears are running from my eyes
My blood spills from my arms
I am immortal I can't die but I will feel deep pain
My eyes are red my hair is black
Like 
Eternal is dark forest
Eternal is the night
Deep dark forest eternally
The sun rise up I clear believed
The forest sight in me
But winter is. The days are short
And dark are all the trees
The sun goes down the twilight comes followed by the night
Silent stands the deep dark forest and the moon shines bright
Eternal is dark forest
Eternal is the night
Deep dark forest eternally <start> Savagely beguiled of courage
Not equipped for determination
Needed for your journey
Not sure if you were
Thrown in or shit out
The way you see it is the way it is
Maybe not the way its supposed to be
A beginning for other solutions
Led to the same place to find
The bad in the bad
And the bad in the good
Either way
Whatever could go wrong does go wrong
Ending up right back
Where you began
The great escape
Houdini mystique
Sensory multiload
Overstate the obvious
That your situations
Remain in focus never to vanish
Soar and envision sore vision
Trippin at the helm
The illusion of utopia
Wanting more and more
And then youll beg
Soar and envision sore vision <start> downward
the fires burn
our souls thirst
inspired by fire
ever burning
downward
the crows curse
the sound hurts
the hour uncertain
the final curtain
the final chapter
here or hereafter
immortal and invincible
the storm reborn <start> Wounds don't heal right when carved from the inside.
Scars don't go away not even in time.
I wanted to be what you needed from me.
You're blind but when will you see
It feels like I've been down here one too many times before.
It's cold and it's dark and I don't want to feel it anymore.
It feels like I've been down here one too many times before.
And I don't want to know.
Cries go unheard when laid upon deaf ears.
An embrace once shared replaced by a cold stare.
I would give you my heart it's worth everything.
You're blind but when will you see
It feels like I've been down here one too many times before.
It's cold and it's dark and I don't want to feel it anymore.
It feels like I've been down here one too many times before.
And I don't want to know.
Why does it have to be like this
Why does it have to feel like this
Why does it have to end like this
I feel like I've died I've been down so long.
When I've never been so alive. <start> Ener maer pa brghet ganga mtrulskap ok vander ir simet

It's death in vogue in saturnalian nights
The heart we share is a virus in our chests
A black piece filled with darkness and dead meat
Now our hearts beat on
The black is back in the deep
I see a million of nations
In blank and hot leather...
This black syndicate is a burning ballroom
Dirt drinks and pills and Gucci drenched in blood
The flag we raise is held for the dead dolls
So now we'll watch all angels parade in black uniforms
Now our hearts beat on
The black is back in the deep
I see a million of nations
In blank and hot leather
Puppets without strings
Now Join the show
Demons without wings
We are death in Vogue
Ten tons of lungs roar into the black vault
It's disease glam and champagne filled with nails
The syndrome is sucked into white bloodcells
And we march as vamps and wolves on red human oil
The faceless ones...
The leather swept ones that bring hate in tons
The faceless ones...
The subversion of laws through the rule of guns
Here they come as the models and machines
And see the dolls twist inside of their dreams
I see the puppets whisper with manic tongues
Feel it scream it out from the top of your lounges <start> Now that my life is changing
Something is missing
Driving me insane
These feelings in my brain
Dark fear...so real
Sanity lives so far away from here
Dangerous age I'm running out of time
The world is in my stage but I'm running out of
Running out of time
Somehow the light is fading
To unholy darkness
Night destroys the day
It's so hard to find my way
Dark fear...so real
Sanity lives so far away from here
Dangerous age I'm running out of time
The world is in my stage but I'm running out of
Running out of time <start> INTRO
As minds slip into the dreamland of insanity
A pure fantasy for all the lives condemned
The game begins and all morals destroyed
Illusions of perfection plague this reality.
VERSE
Subconscious shackled into the orders of the ignorant
Conforming to stereotypes in pursuit of affection.
Can you hear the voices surrounding me
A swelling chorus of pure insanity
The voices now show reason
The life you lead is fucking treason. X
So fall victim to your dreams
Only seeing what you want to see.
Because I see the real world
And even at the worlds end you refuse to believe.
CHORUS X
Follow the motions
Ignore the signs
Even a blind man
Can see their lies
VERSE
Escape into your mind the one place where youre free
From social obligation to right the wrongs you see.
Practice what you preach mean every word you say
Thats the only wake to make this hell go away. X
A step further a second longer.
Trapped inside a feeble mind.
Memories shatter like glass
And scatter across the seas . X

VERSE X
A step further a second longer.
Trapped inside a feeble mind.
Memories shatter like glass
And scatter across the seas.

And even at the worlds end you refuse to believe. <start> Can't believe there is a future
for the children of today
Corrupted politicians are standing in their way
don't let the system fool You
all that they want is to rule You
They're blinding their eyes for glory
a brief moment of success
Is all their fame and fortune a substitute for happiness
For once in their lives why can't they realize
The answer is love Yeah love
Oh Father whom art in heaven
behold this world in need
of peace and understanding
instead of hate and greed
Choose the way that's in Your heart. <start> Verde tu tierra roja la piedra fria tu agua de cristal

But it's faces and brains
But those slitty eyed birds
Throw bad 
I am not your mother

Oryour father who left
In the last council coach
Keep in the black and stay out of the red
Stick with me stick with me
I am your caterer
I am your caterer
I am your caterer
And dad will keep you warm
But he has left home
And your mother went out
Cos it was too warm
Stick with me stick with me
Chicken and chips off the bone
I am the caterer
I am the caterer
I serve chips to the left of 
Green is the double or treble to get
And turn the card on your pack of cigarettes
Stick with me stick with me
I am your caterer <start> Darkness your surest bet
Wage of sin and blood roulette
Laying the odds against your gods
High stakes and no regret
No parlay in this game of hell
Lose your soul they sound the knell
Nothing ventured nothing gained
The cards foretell
The stakes unclean
Through black 
Whenever you decide
You're gonna let it ride
Salvation a game of chance
Roll of the dice the devil's dance
Speculate and tempt your fate
Life paid in advance
Double down and pull one more
Even money you even the score
Can't renege you pay the vig
You're spoken for
The stakes unclean
Through black 
Whenever you decide
You're gonna let it ride
Eternity on the money line
Cloven one pulls three of a kind
You bet the spread and end up dead
Too late to change your mind
You went all in didn't hedge your bets
Dark bookmaker collects all debts
Death begets the devil's hand
The wheel resets
The stakes unclean
Through black 
Whenever you decide
You're gonna let it ride <start> I'm sitting here n the middle of a meadow
In the nowhere
I breathe the scent of a rayfield
Imagining how it would be to feel closeness around me
A song in my head
Revived by an illusion that ends in a quiet fall
I'm standing here looking down the cliff
My fingertips sink into the streams of the wind
I see this
That I am
My trembling hands are lead by a breeze
Inside it I'm accompanied by a soft strength
Disappointment is the end of deception <start> Inner deformity such a foul deceptive rot.
Conceiving the grotesque. Nothing is but what is not.
Screeds of verbiage never explained. Gazing at the flames.
Inside the dungeon or my skull only mawkish thoughts remains.
Grotesque addict forever shadowed
Darkness clouding me. Absurdity now fate.
Bizzarre dreams an horrendous nightmare
Nothing left but to hallucinate.
Dementia reigns a predilection. Total order cease.
Rescrudescent this condition. Coherency decrease.
Humanity is not to shine in my bloodless face.
Magnified in travesty I have been displaced.
See with the eye of the mind. That the lie will speak.
Traumatic cracks in my addiction made the future bleak.
Paralysed to ruminate embolismic bitter jest.
Ontologically I'm dead reborn as the grotesque.
THE GROTESQUE <start> In my head there is a tiny world
it's so huge
it's so small
When I see the light on the wall
of my room
I get happy
I get so sad
Tightly and slowly I go around myself
And I try to look i try to find something common something else.
The clocks are ticking from one to one
The midnight hour my shadow meets
My own reflection My shadow meets my own reflection
You faded away like a line drawn on the water
I'm fulling again into deep see of my mind
We touched the stones on the ground
And we played those to be the jewels
of our crowns
And you squeesed my hand
And wispered a sentense
And our eyes were bright
And our feet were dirty so dirty <start> Instrumental <start> Return To The Eternal Mindstrip

Defiance <start> father I've seen her through the window
she's been summoning spirits
she's brought a curse on us all
and for that she has to be punished
and I got these voices in my head
telling me I got to stop her
cause she speaks to the dead
Darkness casts upon us all
Gone is the light that used to fall
Darkness casts upon us all
Dead is life buried since old
Sorrow voices
I'm being embraced by the dark black hole
Watched you your blasphemy
Your filthy soul must be cleansed by me
I'm your salvation
I'm your christ
But instead of me you'll be crucified
Father
She speaks to the dead
And I'll crave her confession
Cause she speaks to the dead
There she is
Lighting the candles
I'm watching her again
Becoming at one with the shadows
She must be punished
And I am the one
To exorcise the demons
Make sure it's done
Father
She speaks to the dead
And I'll crave her confession
Cause she speaks to the dead <start> Sprung from total emptiness
Inpenetratable and cold
I'm drawn into the gray
And then only darkness
I can hear the rain again
And feel the fragrance of fall
I can remember the summer no more
Seems like it never was
I try to run back where I came from
But I fail
The gate closes in front of me
Now already earlier than yesterday
Raging tempest has reached me
I'm no longer safe
The beauty I saw
It can't hold me now
The more I walk the more I stray
Long strides in the garden of a withering flower
Trying becomes hard
And hope unnecessary
I'm willing to curse my past curse my dream
With which my demons now dance with me
The one now taken away
I'm led away
Like blind <start> There's a loss of innocence
And of something beautiful
In a look so perverse
In a laugh so horrible
And I should have noticed
That my pain was your pleasure
And that your failures
Were mine to suffer
Again and again and again
Caught you lying through your teeth
Just the same as before
Complete with an excuse
For your fuckedup behavior <start> Lay waste torn asunder weak and lost in the past. Obfuscates the self mind
ripped it away. Cobwebs and motes in the eye of the sun god. I think not
serpent get thee behind me. Eradicated your somnambulant enigma. This field
has lain fallow won't erode won't soak up the sediment from your poisoned
mind. No I won't soak up your misery won't soak up your weakness won't
soak up your banality. Taste vanadium wide awake realizing what you've
done. Taste the frost you chose your own death you know that you choose
well. I hate myself but not as much as I hate you. Tear yourself down. <start> They manipulate and they mold
The rules they should uphold
His ignorance of the law
Is the victim's only flaw
His rights in violation
Through sharp intimidation
He's soon to realize
That their words are full of lies
A scapegoat he now is
Because of the way he lives
He hasn't got a chance
To prove his innocence
People cry for justice
But the law will not take the heed
Innocent victims get the shaft
But what happened to truth
Injustice for all
Coerced to pleading guilt
Their judgments all are built
On bullshit and hearsay
They'll keep him locked away
He rots inside his cage
His oppression and his rage
Now apathy and disgust
Not a soul he can trust
A scapegoat he now is
Because of the way he lives
He hasn't got a chance
To prove his innocence
People cry for justice
But the law will not take the heed
Innocent victims get the shaft
But what happened to truth
Injustice for all
Injustice has subdued him
Deceived repressed unglued him
No one he can turn to
To wait is all he can do
Persecution obvious
Life becomes oblivious
Fate's found him unwary
He's trapped he cannot flee
Injustice
Injustice
Injustice
Injustice for all <start> Unfathomable depths of fanaticism and depravity
Do our choosing without hesitation... Give yourself over to sin.
Your one chance for redemption shall come when the spark is ignited within.
Forced to sever the ties to this world which is bound by lies.
Your free from original sin forced to find what was hidden within.
Breathe you in lead you out.
Inflame your passions within our depravity give yourself over to sin.
You won't emerge without transformation... Flesh our soul will win.
Forced to sever the ties to this world which is bound by lies.
You're free from original sin forced to find what is hidden within.
I am in command
Forced to lay locked away made to serve... another  days.
This will even prevent masturbation
You rise in the presence of our libertinage taste all the pleasures of sin.
Your one desire controlled by perversion compelled by lust within.
Forced to sever the ties to this world which is bound by lies.
You're free from original sin... Release what was hidden within.
Forced to lay locked away made to serve... Another  days.
I slide a glance in your direction
Just what you need and then you'll want to say
fill my hole with your affection
Conditioned to begin
 more hours to save your flowers or watch them wilt away
We'll hunt you we want you
Where forever is one day <start> I wanna be the number one
The One out of a million
I wanna climb the highest peak
And get all the best critique
I wanna be the number one
The special and the chosen one
I wanna be the king of kings
To be the master of the strings
WorstCase Scenario  Get yourself prepared and go
WorstCase Scenario  Much anger you will swallow
WorstCase Scenario  For a war you need ammo
WorstCase Scenario  Stay alert
WorstCase Scenario  Get yourself prepared and go
WorstCase Scenario  Much anger you will swallow
WorstCase Scenario  For a war you need ammo
WorstCase Scenario  Stay alive
Hoping the best but getting the worst
Paying the debt  playing unrehearsed
Is it a test or is it a game
Nevertheless you'll never
Be the same
Be the same
WorstCase Scenario  Get yourself prepared and go
WorstCase Scenario  Much anger you will swallow
WorstCase Scenario  For a war you need ammo
WorstCase Scenario  Stay alert
I walk away now <start> When you said goodnight didn't you mean goodbye.
It's not the way you loved me but definitely how you hurt me.
Your lies like a dagger through my heart.
Pierced me where it hurts the most.
If you were gone would I miss you or would I be greatful.
All I ever wanted was your love. <start> World world
This world is a stage broken bones no regrets this world is a stage
And everyone seems to have their opinion stick around stay for a while
I am choking on someone else's blood and the fingerprints of God
Stick around and let me tell you about it far too many
Incomprehensible <start> You've got a full time job with a minimal pay
You do all of the work but you don't get no say
You never raise your voice or try to run the show
You always get there first you're always last to go
You always take your share no more no less
And when you've had your turn there's always something left
For whoever's next behind you in the line
When there's work to do you always spare some time
you work your hands to the bone but you don't complain
You never push up front just for your personal gain
This goes out to all the zeros to my personal heros
All the losers and zeros you're my personal heroes
This goes out to all the zeros
You never do no wrong you never hurt no one
You always tell yourself the best is yet to come
No matter how things look How bad it all may seem
You always stand your ground and live by your means
you work your hands to the bone but you don't complain
You never push up front just for your personal gain
Chorus
We're all heros we're all zeros.......
Chorus <start> There is no one to save us
Nothing that we can do to change it
We adapt and we fight or we loose our lives
Our dead have risen against us
Eager to feast and gorge upon our flesh
Godforsaken beasts are controlling the night
Eternal Night
I know we're losing this battle
Their numbers grow larger in the dark
To even escape them is no guarantee
No they won't take me easy
I will fight them with everything that I have got
I'll try to have hope where there's none to be found
Eternal Night
Foraging in the city I hear a desperate cry out for help
I leap through the window with weapons in hand
It is then that I see her surrounded
By death and it's slavering jaws I attack
Without warning or fear for my life
If fate decrees this is my last hour
I am prepared to die a man
If on this day I take my last breath
Know you I'll fight you to the death
A wave of fury consumes me
I won't sleep untill I've hacked everything in this room
I stand on a heap of ripped torsos and limbs
Then I take in her beauty
At the same time that she seems to notice my wounds
She says I'm infected.... I tell her I know
Eternal Night
Eternal Night
I'm lost in the darkness of this
Eternal Night <start> The rain kept on falling
And darkened the sky
The dawn was to come with the sunrise
Revealing the shadows
That passed through the mist
The torchlight was flickering the storm
Was chasing them on
A procession of dark coats
Followed the star
Foretold to come since ages
In silence they walked on
Crossing the lands
On their way to Bethlehem to break the
Chains of the spell
Stone they worshiped the stone
In generation from father to son
A star a star is to come
To light them way to the one who is born
The leader he knelt there
To greet the newborn
Holding his pendant before him
Teardrops were falling from his eyes as he said

Into the sundown he returned
The moon was rising and heaven burned
Like shadows disappeared the men
And the black stone wielders were never seen again
Stone they wielded the stone
In generation from father to son
A star a star is to come
And light them the way to the one who is born <start> I slam the door in my own face again
To see if I will ever change the feeling
I separate from my body
Simply just lost in my mind
If I walk and find a stone
Break it open to find my own gold
Making riches out of nothing
There is one thing the way it's spent
Is the challenge or we'll have nothing left.
Fill my stomach with bags of salt
Dissolve like a slug but you know it's your fault
But once my remains are on the floor
I'll blossom like a flower and become a whole
Do you love when you're breaking at the seams
Do you love when you forget what it means
Do you love when you have nothing
An empty pocket doesn't hurt as much as an empty chest
So break the bread and off up
The ones you cared for and loved enough
Because you gave up your water for a fifth of gin
You're like a sailboat with no captain or wind. <start> Thus he died
Nom the Wise
Lord of the caves and friend of man
Fair and noble
Most beloved of the Noldor race
Paid the price he redeemed the oath
Farewell my friend farewell <start> My veins they are open
And yours to fill
The beast of my sins
Ain't easy to kill
Drowning in love by bitterness warped
We sleep in different nights
Ugly and drugged rotten to the core
But I just can't let this die
My intellect bind
My will amputated
It's a sweet little need
Your need to be hated
Ugly drugged and fevered
By bitterness warped
Your beauty rages through my veins
Declaring war
Drowning in love by bitterness warped
Stab your darkness into me
Ugly and drugged rotten to the core
I see a truth you cannot see
As smooth as the skin
The skin of fire
I'm at the mercy of urges
You're my funeral dyer <start> Sechzehntes Kapitel
DER SPIELMANN
DER TOTMACHER
Es haust in mir der Totenmann

und hngt an meinen Knochen dran

DER TOTMACHER
Er sprt verrucht mit Spott betucht
den Werkelmann der nun aus seinem Bettlein kam
DER SPIELMANN 
Es war mir so als schlief ich ein
in Teufels morschen Schrein.
Nun will ich der Clown auf diesem Totenacker sein.
DIE BUCKLIGE
Er schleppt sein verrucht Bein' aus dem Totenbettchen fort
der Leierkastenmann schiebt sein Gerippe dann aus dem Totenhort
Ein Pppchen das froh die Knochen vorwrts trgt
sein Fleisch verlor und mit ner Schippe um sich schlgt.
SCHWARZE PUPPEN
Und was kommt dann
BERTRAM DER TEUFELSKNECHT
Der Leichnam geht dem Ausgang zu
...zerrt sich fort und stockt mit Hohn ein Lied dazu
DAS UNGEZIEFER 
Legt lahm den toten Clown wir woll'n an seinen Knochen kauen
schnappt die Schippe packt den Schalk und legt ihn wieder kalt
DER SPIELMANN
Lasst mich andre Leichen sehen ne kleine Runde drehen...
und just ein bisschen Klee am Totenacker sen

DER SPIELMANN 
Nur nicht auf die Knochen hauen
blo nicht lasst es sein legt die Schippe weg...und schlagt mir nicht aufs Bein
Von der Schippe getroffen sackt das Gerippe schlielich zusammen.
DER SPIELMANN 
DAS UNGEZIEFER 
Legt den Spielmann kalt so lange er noch lallt
DIE BUCKLIGE 
Sie schlugen das Pppchen sie straften es perfid
es konnte nur marode stehen.
Es stand entfrbt und ohne Trnen
ganz mde war's von diesem schnellen Vorwrtsgehen.
Doch dann hebt es die Beinchen und kippelt wie ein  Puppenfratz
klapp klapp klapp im Leichentrab das Pppchen wurd' zur Katz
es stiehlt sich ganz auf einem Bein den Schdel unterm Arme kehrt und heim ins Totenbett.
DER SPIELMANN
Wo ist das Totenbett Ich hielt es doch adrett
bin ein gekpfter armer Totenclown
Die kleinen rosa Schnuzchen piepsten da so nett.
Wo ist die Kiste dieses dieses Loch von einem Bett
DER SPIELMANN 
Mein Kpfchen lacht mir zu Aha es starrt...ja glotzt marod' und singt dazu
Der Tod ist fein  der Tod ist mein  der Tod will nicht alleine sein
er hinkt er stinkt raubt Kopf und Bein und hockt in diesem Schrein <start> As the days grow colder now
And everything is lost
A vision forms of better men
Rising from the cross
Never held the key to life
Finally their loss
Rising from the emptiness
And all that ever was
The battle rages on 'til now
Many men were lost
Dried into an empty shell
Nailed onto the cross
As I lie awake by now
Having never loved
Heaven sent for all of us
So painful our loss
In the eyes of the world a believer
But I'm sure they are turning away
Takes me down to a place below
Can't you see I'm falling
Pain has come and the world will surely hide
In empathy
And then the world's religious fools
Come knocking at your door
Mankind is not wiser now
I've heard it all before
Still the mindless will hail the deceivers
And I'm sure they'll be turning away
Takes me down to a place below
Can't you see I'm falling
Pain has come and the world will surely hide
In empathy
Takes me down to a place below
Can't you see I'm falling
Pain has come and the world will surely hide
Takes me down to a place below
Can't you see I'm falling
Pain has come and the world will surely hide

My gift to you my heart was yours.
In ten weeks you shaped it
In one night you murdered it.
Torn from my chest and laid at your feet
That first step you took was the worst.
Since then you've walked a thousand miles in silence and short remark
I still have these memories
But we'll never see what we could have been.
Remember when we talked about where we'd be a year from now
Remember when you held my hand like you'd never let it go
Remember cause that's all you can do.
We'll never make another memory
We'll never make another memory.
I wish I'd have died in your arms the last time we were together
So I wouldn't have to wake without you today.
This time I thought things were real.
You said they were what happened
You were a priority was I an
option
I let you see a side of me that I don't share with anyone.
Promises are just words unless they are fulfilled.
you knew from the beginning all I had to offer you was my heart
I'm sorry that wasn't enough.
So we'll go our own ways
And hopefully you'll remember the things I've told you
Hopefully you'll understand that everything I said was in sincerity.
A broken heart is not what I wanted from this
But I guess I've learned from it.
But aren't you supposed to learn from your mistakes
I don't consider this a mistake
I just wish the story didn't end this way
Cause I'm still in love with the person who helped me write it.
Remember when you held my hand like you'd never let it go
Remember when we talked about where we'd be a year from now <start> Flg

Whatever you're looking for look somewhere else
I have to take it all and killing you is the best way to get there
Always hiding from the daylight at war with the sun
And you know that I am the fallen one
DESTINY MADE ME IMMORTAL
I'M JUST WAITING FOR THE SUN TO COME DOWN
This warrior will change the world's rituals
Still hung up about what you had and lost
Stay right where you are
You've waited long enough to get that killing blow
Always hiding from the daylight at war with the sun
And you know that I am the fallen one
DESTINY MADE ME IMMORTAL
I'M JUST WAITING FOR THE SUN TO COME DOWN
It must be tiring on your soul
T know that you'll never find shelter
Where is your fire where is your anger
You have lost it all
I'm on a path that I can't change I know it and I accept it
If living is so much better than dying then show me the way...
Always hiding from the daylight at war with the sun
And you know that I am the fallen one

I'M JUST WAITING FOR THE SUN TO COME DOWN
Always hiding from the daylight at war with the sun
And you know that I am the fallen one <start> Forget about yesterday it's moved on from you
Live without the doubt that just won't go away
We've all stood at the edge contemplated jumping
A leap of fear loss of faith we can't go
You see a face you think you know
But it's not the one I show
I feel more more at home
In the places I don't know
I don't belong to my mistakes tired of sleeping wide awake
It's killing me slowly it's crowded and lonely
Even when I crawl I drag my feet when did the world take hold of me
It's killing me slowly it's crowded and lonely I can't feel at all
I find myself back here again
But I'm not emptyhanded
I'm not leaving I'm not done I'm not the kind that would run
Being lost is a lovely place to find yourself again
You see a face you think you know
But it's not the one I show
I feel more more at home
In the places I don't know
I don't belong to my mistakes tired of sleeping wide awake
It's killing me slowly it's crowded and lonely
Even when I crawl I drag my feet when did the world take hold of me
It's killing me slowly it's crowded and lonely I can't feel at all
I owe another shot to the world
It took a shot at me and missed
I owe another chance to myself
Take me back to the beginning
We all come from something
I don't belong to my mistakes tired of sleeping wide awake
It's killing me slowly it's crowded and lonely
Even when I crawl I drag my feet when did the world take hold of me
It's killing me slowly it's crowded and lonely I can't feel at all <start> Under it all
A new world
A new world made with the hands of madness
These hands
They will always do the cutting
Piece by piece the pain gets worse
If only I could see myself right now
The gathering of flesh
Transforming my face into an unrecognizable state
Smooth out the eyes
Smooth out the lips
Every mirror is a past idea smashed upon recognition 
Will it be found
Will the right hands deliver
The heartache I left
Cut until all that is left is new material
Myself
Day in day out
Deep down I know what I must do
So much happens behind closed doors
So much happens behind our closed doors
This key will open them
Expose us all
Crustyeyed symphony
Awakened by my grunts and moans
Why do I do this to myself
I suppose the choice was all mine
God felt so much better before the mirror glimpse
On the surface I know what I must do
The precaution documents
The fail safe way back home.
Should I end it right here and now
That would be far too selfish
I shall end what I've begun
The creation of more
More of us
The skin and bones of destruction
An army of weak souls
Weak minds
Weak life

I wake to my own whimper
Ship is counting down
Must regroup myself
The end starts now <start> Words have come to us with the morning breeze
We can feel the fuss of the wind of the seas
Mother earth in anger lightning in the skies
Mighty force of thunder open your eyes
Our sister cried a thousand tears
Against the wind and tides forget our fears
We must cross the land with the forces of nature
And by our hands let's forge our future
It's a march for freedom
In a world rules by jealousy
Let's walk through her kingdom
And set them all free
It's a march for freedom
Where magic has no place
And this march for freedom
Will change the nature of the human race
Closer to the castle we still hear her song
Enchanting the battle our powers growing strong
On the shaking ground castles walls are falling
No soldiers around brothers spread your wings
Our sister cried a thousand tears
Against the wind and tides forget our fears
We must cross the land with the forces of nature
And by our hands let's forge our future
It's a march...
Words have come to us
With the morning breeze
And this march for freedom
Gave us a kingdom
Our march for freedom oh <start> Ancient beliefs

Your false epiphanies

Hollow morality
Lethal religion
Manufactured lies
Destroying all life

Is this what I'm looking for
And who do I talk to
What do I have to explore

You'll be taking your heaven by force
How could you choose

We might not want to overextend them no more
Our beautiful spook lights are all they will need
All they will want to explore

We won't fear the transcience no more
Cause we don't realize
Idle glance in our eyes

I'm sitting here like a silent bird.
You try to understand the symbols of my hand.
I am like a rock that has turned to sand.
Chorus SILENT. MUTED FOR ETERNAL TIME SO VIOLENT.
BUT I JUST CAN'T CONFESS MY CRIME
Like every human being there is a thing I seek.
For me the day when I can finally speak.
To hear my voice again I still remember when
I could say what was on my mind.
I rule the streets at night against myself I fight.
I am only trying to survive you see.
No man will ever live after what I will give.
His soul will go to meet my voice up there.

Piece by piece I die. Soon there's no
tears to cry. I am fading out just like a star falling
from the sky I hear me in my dreams. I can't deny
I am suffering. Judge from my silent screams.
Without my voice I am withering.
Oh how I wish to scream and to wake
up from this dream but the pain I feel is real.
I try to say my name. But I always hear the same
Silence It drives me insane. To live a life in silence
to live without the word. I'm sitting here like a silent bird.
You try to understand the symbols of my hand. I am like a
rock that has turned to sand. Like every human being there's
a thing I seek for me the day when I can finally speak. To
hear my voice again I still remember when I could say what
was on my mind. Silent.

The written word has no meaning
there is no harmony in my words. <start> You feel the anger
You rise up
You're thinking differently

So get the cure to fight ' cause

So liberate your fucking hate
Refrain
We are the slaves of corrupted rules
Just say fuck it just say you're fucking them
Just be united to change da world

So don't let them stop you and grow

We don't believe the suckers no  x

One finishing touch and the creature is coming alive
As I kneel down and pray
I know God is watching over me
Is he's knocking me out of my stride
And on day number eight
When the sun is about to go down
Here we go what a show
What a nose for blow
You're alive said the maker and smiled at the aardvark
You're divine by the grace of the master above
You're alive said the maker and smiled at the aardvark
You're divine by the grace of the master above
Hey Frankenstein are you the one I think you are
Godfather. If were divine you are bizarre
I hear you laughing from the lodge above

Hey Lord above why don't your armies ever smile
Godfather. Why don't they ever dress in style
And never share the humor that you surely have

Why do they have to get married before they do what they do
Everyday anyway when there's hell to pay
You're alive said the maker and smiled at the aardvark
You're divine by the grace of the master above
You're alive said the maker and smiled at the aardvark
You're divine by the grace of the master above
We fold our hands afraid of what we've done
Fear is the key you're thy kingdom come
You shake your head and have another wine
Don't you almost die laughing wondering why
Running in the dust running in the dust
Afraid of the hail stones
Cold as ice
Running in the dust running in the dust
Straight to the wastelands
Well never read your signs
Running in the dust running in the dust
Afraid of tomorrow
Afraid of what we've done
Running in the dust running in the dust
You're the disciples of the big bad wolf or what
You're alive said the maker and smiled at the aardvark
You're divine by the grace of the master above
You're alive said the maker and smiled at the aardvark
You're divine by the grace of the master above

Vr ondskap skal gro

Den siste krig skal vi vinne

Deres korte sjeler skal samles
Vi skal rde over kaos og evig natt
Vi skal glemme de kvinnelig vikante mdre
og utslette alt
Et rike skal reise seg

What comes as no surprise
To a jaded mind no less
Insight comes from soothing grace
Left to waiting days
Another chord unstrummed
Our secret's safe and sound
Solid now unless it breaks in two
Faithfully unbound
And none of this was ever built to last
With the paleness of a less than life
From a corner watching old paint dry
Never once a break
Into the self again
An endeavor that will flat or fail
What maturity comes to end
Never one to face
Another beat undone
Our secret's safe and sound
Solid now unless it breaks in two
Faithfully unbound
And none of this was ever built to last
Once again
Another instant saved today
Left a print that leads nowhere
Never built to last
What makes it work
A part of life that'll make a weak heart grow
Take it if you're willing to pay willing to kill
Prepared to lay it down
Just know that

Was never ever built to last
Never ever built to last <start> No more tears for those that are dying
for those that are crying
We are soldiers born to fight
for a peaceful world
So if you feel that you're in a fire
than raise your voice
keep on laughtin' keep on lovin'
We are safe in the eye of the storm
We're safe... inside.. in hell
So keep that faith that fills your heart
We're not worlds apart
one world one hope one chance
No one can stop the time <start> music Mustis <start> Into the crypts
The pits of the end
We are thrown towards the black
The earth opens wide for our violent descend
Nightmare visions attack
Tired lives in regression
Vicious circles close
Upon a world of chaos
Lack of time will take its' toll
Sadistic bondage of mankind
Under the whip  a hatred blind
Inject the pain then leave you dry
You're falling back  A feast for flies
Unholy furnace  Your funeral pyre
Perpetual demise  No fucking afterlife
Under the whip
Hunted down hard you beg for relief
From stress  From pressure  From life
Pain will plague uout lives built on deceit
Your dreams of utopia were lies
Sadistic bondage of mankind
Under the whip  a hatred blind
Inject the pain then leave you dry
You're falling back  A feast for flies
Unholy furnace  Your funeral pyre
Perpetual demise  No fucking afterlife
Under the whip
Deafened by the beat of vulture wings
As they circle overhead
They ride the wings of retallation
Upon an unsuspecting prey descend
On the receiving end of a hatred blind
Darkness closes in on tired lives
Hounds of hell encircle thee
Under the whip  Our nightmares come alive
Inject the pain then leave you dry
You're falling back  A feast of flies
Unholy furnace  Your funeral pyre
Perpetual demise  No fucking afterlife
Under the whip
Sadistic bondage of mankind
Under the whip  a hatred blind <start> You're calling me late at night
Spasmodically breathing
You wisper to my tired ear unintelligible message
Sloooooow
Stone it fuck it
Don't creep like a pig
You read me your last will while you're sleeping
Your gabble maybe is charming me
But can't you see  you're drowning
I tell you you must go to bed
I don't know what I know
And I don't call a medicine man
I should know that you drown <start> Would you like to be divine
a healing hand upon your cheek
if you would like to be saved

soon you will bloom
waiting my turn again
the swine became a buzzard
who then turned to a goat
whose sacrificial blood
fed the worms
who emerged and took the oath
animism i believe just as the shaman does
the doctrines of souls
are key principles of life and death
in that i am saved
in that i am tempted
in that salvation is pure and true
fertile eggs incubate in callow innocence
calm and tranquil days had passed
and once at last the storms had stirred the winds
the embryo's in bloom
from the tunnel's warm light
a sunset armageddon sky orange flames of fire night
we'll enlighten you
would you like to be divine
a healing hand upon your cheek
if you wanted to be saved
you should have said so

Churning and warm your insides I gnaw I dribble and fuss over the bubbling
pus... Masticate the foaming carnage Eviscerated human garbage Curdling
innards now ground and chewed Cannibalized torso ensanguined and nude...
Eating the bleeding the reeking splattered limbs Now chomping the entrails
to bits Feeding off seething bowel and intestine The spurting of enzymes
of swill... Innards rent and dribbling Are consumed with sanguinary
delight The organs and offal are so succulent The exquisite flavour of
gastroanal tripe... I drink the viscous lymphatic fluid And delight in
the consistency and flavour The putrid aftertaste of masticated bowel
Meets with my overwhelming favour... I slobber as I dine I suck the marrow
from your spine I gobble the feotid faecal matter With no regard to my
table manners... <start> Spinning mass matter collapses
light contorted and nothing passes
frame dragging photon sphere
light distorted and disappears
swallowed by darkness
we fade into nothingness
tidal force solar masses
endless density cosmic casket
transcending we near the threshold
swallowed by darkness

here we are at the event horizon
growing red within rapid rotation

consuming surroundings

I know the reasons you're afraid. Stand in line you're not that different. Realize you'll never deel this. Stand in line you'll always be this. But you could never be this. Last night I saw dotten lines for days but I couldn't see the look on your face. What are you waiting for That's why you'll never know. I won't compromise for time when I can see that look in your eyes. For all your jealous sides I know you'll never try. You can't disguise. Waste your time. Time to decide. Sever these ties. As these chances are passing you by. Just keep telling yourself you'll be alright. <start> Acababa de vender mi alma al diablo
Desde el primer momento en que te conoc
Why en la frontera donde esta el amor why el deseo
Quede atrapado sin saber donde estaba el fin
Oh oh buscando la llave
Oh oh de tu corazn
Oh oh para que me hable
Oh oh me hable de amor
Hay veces que no es fcil distinguir la tierra del cielo
Pero en el fondo todos tenemos una cosa en comn
Los sentimientos siempre vencen a los deseos
Why tras las sombras siempre llega un rayo de luz
Oh oh buscando la llave
Oh oh de tu corazn
Oh oh para que me hable
Oh oh me hable de amor <start> I took you by surpirse and led you through the night
I knew you never felt that safe
I turn and whisper to you you turn away
I'd never lie to you my friend
But you should know this one thing
This thing may one day save your life
It's real but you can't touch it
In every colour of the light
Blind Evil
Standing in the darkness
Waiting in the pouring rain
Blind Evil
Want to bring you sadness
Beat you to eternal pain
You turn away in anger
And walked alone
You said that I could go to hell
But in the street there's something
You can't deny
The path to death is where we meet
But you should know this one thing
This thing may one day save your life
It's real but you can't touch it
In every colour of the light
Blind Evil
Standing in the darkness
Waiting in the pouring rain
Blind Evil
Want to bring you sadness
Beat you to eternal pain

But you should know this one thing
This thing may one day save your life
It's real but you can't touch it

Standing in the darkness
Waiting in the pouring rain

Beat you to eternal pain

Waiting in the pouring rain
Blind Evil
Want to bring you sadness
Beat you to eternal pain <start> With the snow fallen thick
And bonfires alit
And shooting stars portents of rips
I ascended to spur
A mere glimpse or murmur
From her precious celestial lips
Be it sun to your moon
Be it moon to your sun
Together we promised to come
With a turn of the screw
And a slip of the tongue
We eclipsed one another undone
Through the mists through the woods
With the nightwraiths Ive stood
Atop murderous peaks calling you
On stormlashed beachheads
Where the fishermen dread
The things your bewitchments accrue
Those deep creatures bring
Her cut diamond rings
A girl with a pearl necklace her
Advancing in fevers
Tsunamis and myrrh
Will she wreak bloody vengeance or purr
Or will she burn
She lights the skies
Dressed in silver scales plucked from the ocean
To spite her thighs
That Lucifer snuck inside
And with his pride
Enclaves were upgraded to Goshen
So paradise
Could shine from out her skirts
I adorn myself at dusk
With ornaments to close the noose
A kiss as red as blood and cold as hell
My body glows with lust
Anaemic as the flag of truce
I raised at dawn to catch you in my spell
With every twist I cannot resist her
Fertile female mind control
This wanton witch whiterapids sister
To whom I pour my wine and soul
And here we go again
From a corpse of black pews
Where the moon was drawn through
Like a sword through a Gordian knot
She descended to me
Claiming swift victory
Over the heart I had nearsoon forgot
With every kiss this huntress whispered
Yield to my sweet embrace
One night of bliss. I could not dismiss her
Once her beauty shot me a darker face
You mesmerise my soul Diana
You mesmerise my soul <start> In a future not so distant
The sun and moon will still rise
But mother Earth shall force us to listen
I have seen it written
And so it shall it be done
I have a gift some even call it a blessing
I'm caught in a dream
A dream where I can't run
Where I can't run...
Dreaming dreaming dreaming
Wish I was caught in a dream
But I'm not so I'm
Dreaming dreaming dreaming
Wish I was caught in dream
But I'm not...
I try to hide my visions
Throw'em in and lock'em up
In a room with just four walls
I did not choose this mission
Who pointed me the prophet
With a crystal ball
I have a gift some even call it a blessing
I'm caught in a dream
A dream where I can't run
Where I can't run...
Dreaming dreaming dreaming
Wish I was caught in a dream
But I'm not so I'm
Dreaming dreaming dreaming
Wish I was caught in dream
But I'm not... <start> I lay down my head in deepest sorrow
And feel the emptiness of my soul
Nothing is left but your image
A fading picture is my blackened mind
A black swan dies an it's tears
Get dried from the dust
So only the crimson skies
Can wathc the end of this tragedy
Withing this darkened firmament
The silent moon
He sees my fall my grief
The waves wash away the blood
So that nothing remains of this
Unknown lovelorn fate <start> Ven claridad llega ya

por piedad mata sombras
dame luz resplandor libertad
para no soarla mas no ya no
nunca mas que vuelvo a su esclavitud
ah ah ah que vuelvo a su esclavitud.
Ven claridad quedate
y no vuelvas a escapar
no te lleves el sol
que no quiero recordar
su figura su voz
cada noche que paso
como ayer como hoy
que vuelvo a su esclavitud
ah ah ah que vuelvo a su esclavitud.
Si si si si si si si ven claridad
llega ya tragate la oscuridad
llega ya vuela ya
que el soar me va a matar
basta ya de esperar
de la misma forma
si necesito tu luz
que vuelvo a su esclavitud
ah ah ah que vuelvo a su esclavitud.
Coloreando el cielo de azul
me siento un poco mejor mejor
llena mi ventana de luz
se desdibuja su amor su amor
en la penumbra y en el miedo
llega a quebrarme la razon.
Ella es solo soledad y silencio
no mas regresa claridad.
Sol claridad viva luz
el trabajo la ciudad caminar
y vivir como entonces
como fui claridad quedate
esta noche sobre mi
claridad plenitud
que olvide a su esclavitud
ah ah ah que olvide a su esclavitud.
Ven claridad llega ya
tragate la oscuridad
llega ya vuela ya
que el soar me va a matar
basta ya de esperar

How we used to play like kids in the sun
Nowadays there's no light to see
And we're feeling cold
So the time has come
To say farewell my friends
My fate is calling loud
Now I know it can get tough
And I don't you know where I'll be tomorrow
Do you do you want to know it
I don't care about it
Somebody said that we could never ever die
Oh what a lie
You will see the light again
We'll all be free someday
I know 'cause united we stand
Goodbye my friends I'm leaving you today
My quest is hard but I must be on my way
Now don't ask why
Goodbye dear friends
Don't you try and stop me
All I know is I have to go
There'll be no sense in my life at all
If I stay
You will never see it you will never find it
Oh yes I will
Someone will take my place if I die
An old man said
Some years ago they've tried it all before
Some men of honor left
And searched for that land
They did not return.
Now it's up to you
To play a better game remember
When you're out there
Don't look back at all
Goodbye my friends I'm leaving you today
The quest is hard
I hope I'll find a way home one day
Goodbye my friends I'm leaving you today
The quest is hard
I know I find a way home one day
You will see the light of day
We'll all be free again
All that's left to say is farewell <start> If you only saw it all would your words even change
The torment the angerour last demise
Your truth defeats my time
All and all for what its worth
Would you change your fucking mind
You carry on I'll walk behind
No need to test our time
The story goes on again
It all repeats the same.
The crying screaming loss for words
Your money remains.
All I ask for is a piece of mind.
I numb to ease the pain
You play your part
The victim at heart
Once more repeats the same
The yearning keeps burning <start> In my dream smoke followed me
As on fire the whole world had been
To the yard I walked in
Up the frontstep and opened the door
Cranes flew over to the North
As I walked on dry
And passed through a grove
Yellow with flowers
They had been expecting me
They said so and I believed
I'm my dream smoke came to me
And we became as one
I am smoke <start> Bastards of a lying breed
You've ruled us for too long
Truth to you are lies to me
And your right is so wrong
Moral preached by immoral fucks
All I feel is despise
Lie no more you fucking cunts
You tear me up inside
Your sons die from your abuse
But you're giving us the blame
The easy path's the one you choose
That road will lead to pain
You're trying to control their mind
And strip them of free will
The way you force them to go blind
Will surely get them killed
My mind is free and so is my soul
You can't put me in chains
I won't play the welladjusted role
Or bow my head in shame
So throw your stones of guilt at me
Point your finger curse my name
Your scapegoat I will never be
I won't take the blame
Now we're on trial to serve your crime
And pay for your mistakes
There is no way we'll do the time
The chains of lies will break
Censorship can't stop our truth
We speak straight from the heart
There is nothing you can do
We'll tear your souls apart
Censorship can't stop my truth
We speak straight from our hearts
There is nothing you can do
We'll tear your souls apart
So see us rise we're few but strong
We'll crack your fucking teeth
And feed you with your twisted tongue
Until you cannot breathe
The fury makes our eyes see red
It burns within our hearts
Soon you'll all be stone cold dead
We'll tear your souls apart <start>  An Erotic Ethic Error Portrait 
I gave you to my desert
'said ya' might be lost but not alone
I sold you to my prototype
propensity to scorn is mine to show guess what
Move spoof overweight
heat out of control.
Spring again sin again spittoom chaos
overlapping
don't you step over ... the flood area.
So what's wrong with
a little agony
a harmless game between you the servile
and me the destiny
we love each other as we are
so hateful and depraved
a peaceful pack of pilancy
in any damned direction ...
Could you please
dance my dance
I do we do god for us.

We become our own worst enemy

Boundaries are open
I see clearly all my dreams
I know chance is always near
Make my own reality
Just imagine
Boundaries are open
'Cause you cannot control this
My reality differs from yours
The power of imagination is strong
So we only try to imagine
Will the force be so strong it will control one's mind
Will this power delude or widen the madness that renders blind
So the frontiers of our conceit
Then will become indistinct to vanish in thin air
Boundaries are open
But don't believe it's real
So does faith have roots in imagination
Who is right in the grim and endless fight for revelation
I cannot tell what's right or wrong
For we all dwell in an imaginary borderland
Boundaries are open
But don't believe it's real
Boundaries are open

He prepares for the ambush
I hear his steps
But without trepidation
Hyper aware
I will strike back
When he brandished the blade
Gave his intentions away
Back to the wall I have no choice
It's time to fight or die
I will respond with overwhelming force
A switch turns on and I must survive
Fearless resolve
As I spring into action
Quickly disarm
And remove his advantage
Only one thing on my mind
Stop his attack
Now he's on the defense
Momentum is shifting my way
A savage brawl I hear his voice
Pure terror in his cries
Break his balance slam him to the ground
Following through to stay alive
Landing multiple blows
The blood is starting to spray
Will not stop till I am sure
The threat has been put down
Raining down with forearm thrusts
Torrents of blood flow from his eyes
Bloodstained cement
No weakness to exploit
His ambush failed
Hammer fists break facial bones
Knuckles bleed from shards of teeth
Smash his skull onto the pavement
Make the bastard pay
Don't stop until it cracks
And spills out his brain
Bloodstained cement
When he chose me as prey
A fatal mistake was made <start> Who am I to say what's right
Or for that matter to say what's wrong
What am I but a man
With big ideas but small plans
Guess I'm not much
Different than some
I found it hard to believe
That my brother would deceive me
Am I to assume that he
Meant to do right
I now know he's not what I believed
Who am I but a man
Your eyes see just who I am
Who am I that you are mindful of me
Lord crash down these walls and
Remind me of who I am
I'm questioning
What's in the heart of a man
That makes us cling to what is wrong
Second birth causes me to
See the distance
From flesh to the spirit is long
Who am I but a man
Your eyes see just who I am
Not anything you've done
That I haven't done
Not anything in which Christ
Was not tempted
Not any crime for which
We're not criminals
Deserving to hang from that tree
Crash down the walls Lord <start> The reign of earth will end here utterly
And by the eye of Ra behold its final doom.
The nightless sky burns home and field
As some try desperately to flee into the moon.
From the stars came unknown saviours
To free man from tragedy.
Giant forms of celestial bodies
That took man away from here.
Eternity as I've always dreamed
Thus we've been granted a second chance.
Cries of joy Joyous cries of human tears.
Our own tears The same that bled for many years.
A million cries The voice of children with hoping hearts.
We are free With courage even death we'll beat. <start> As I lay this all to rest
Shadows appear reminding me
Of all things left unsaid by me
Maybe one day you'll believe
That I will crawl
I will crawl on broken knees
It's beyond what you really need
Forcing it all out of you
Will I make your life complete
Come clean
Am I the sorrow
That you won't reap
Am I the secret
That you can't keep
Well I won't stop
Until I'm complete
And I won't stop
Until you believe
I won't stop until you need me <start> Deep in the shadows I'm fighting a battle
The creature wants me screaming screaming
I think I'm losing tired of choosing I'm slipping down
I can't stop screaming screaming
I'm living a lie there's a creature hiding inside of me
Black as the night with a cold dead heart and a lust for sin
So I shut it out I bottle up I hide it from the world
If I let it out I don't know what I'll do
There's a creature inside of you too
I can't just turn to the menace I've clung to
The creature wants me screaming screaming
I can't determine I'm sure that it's hell bent on breaking out and
Hearing you screaming screaming
I'm living a lie there's a creature hiding inside of me
Black as the night with a cold dead heart and a lust for sin
So I shut it out I bottle up I hide it from the world
If I let it out I don't know what I'll do
There's a creature inside of you too
So I shut it out I bottle up I hide it from the world
If I let it out I don't know what I'll do
There's a creature inside of you too
I can't hold back.
I can't hold back.
I can't hold back.
So I shut it out I bottle up I hide it from you
If I let it out I don't know what I'll do
There's a creature inside of you too
So I shut it out I bottle up I hide it from the world
If I let it out I don't know what I'll do
There's a creature inside of you too <start> From birth an existence of agony begins that ends with execution
Intentionally infected with diseases to then try to find cures for humans
Fractured skulls broken bones scalded flesh and blinded eyes
For medical research and cosmetic testing animals suffer and die
Walls conceal the tortured victims of vivisection
Nothing of value can be gained for science or medicine
when the price is a helpless animal's life
An animal becomes a subject  their pain a mere reaction
Harmless testing alternatives ignored  they refuse to end their profit system
The suffering benefits mankind
the excuse for demented scientists whose brutalization
of the innocent denegrates humanity's existance
When education and peaceful protest can't bring their liberation
the strategy for their rescue changes into militant intervention
Every action has an impact
Every life saved is a victory
The truth known by the caring few who wage guerilla warfare to end this atrocity
Severed locks doors wrenched from hinges
the animals deliverance from torment and captivity
Vivisectionists dragged into the street and shot as flames engulf the laboratory
Justice's hammer falls again and again until it ends
when the price is a helpless animal's life <start> Opposer of the one you claim to serve
Your selfrighteousness
Breeding arrogance and pride
Justifying legalism with a distorted
Perception of submission
Salvation by grace
Christianity by performance
Lust for power desire to rule
The beauty of life
The feeling of guilt your weapon of choice
To control the hearts and thoughts
Of the ones you say you love
They are but shadows
In the periphery of your ego
You are the superChristian
Empowered and installed by God
No sin. No mistakes
Psychopath  blinded by hypocrisy
Psychopath  actions of inadequacy
Your moral rearmament of others
Developing shallow minds
With a total lack of identity
Stealing their freedom the one that was
Bought at a high price
No compassion  No love
The intoxication of power feeding your ego
While your  are going to hell
Oblivious to the masquerade
The idyllic facade
Pulled over their eyes
To blind them from the truth <start> Derriba las barreras
Que hay dentro de t
Escapa del hechizo
Que te aprisiona
Tus ojos brillan fuerte
Como un nuevo da
No dejes que se acabe
La magia que hay en t
Es la hora de la verdad
Libera tus deseos
Una vez fuimos uno
Como pudo terminar
Olvidemos el pasado
Empecemos de nuevo
Siente la fuerza otra vez
Coge mi mano <start> I have got secrets but no one to share them with
They might go away if you don't let me in
Sober and speechless alone on the floor again
It's been so long where to begin
Head down rise up breathe in let go and smile
Don't let it tear you up inside
We're bound to fall
Keep climbing and find a place to dive
Above them all
Scheme on you schemers dream on like the dreamers of old
We're not getting lost in what could've been
Head down rise up breathe in let go and smile
Don't let it tear you up inside
We're bound to fall
Keep climbing and find a place to dive
Above them all <start> Lyrics Angela Gossow
This is the age of dehumanization
Perverted creation
Damned misled children
You never stood a chance
Resurrecting a dead messiah
For a paralysed race
Damned misled children
You never stood a chance
Infected
Neglected
The new breed of a generation to come
Rejected
Illfated
The new breed  a generation to kill
Sowing the seed of suffering
Upon these fertile hearts
Damned misled children
You never stood a chance
Chosen to be slaughtered
By the masters of manipulation
Dmaned misled children
You never stood a chance <start> Nothing's all right nothing goes right nothing is right for me.
Nothing goes right nothing ends right nothing put right for me. <start> A shadow I prowl these deadly streets
Perversion degradation my soulmates.
An observer I'm admist the innocent weak
My fascinations are salacious and unchaste.
This netherworld of carnality is my existance
I don't walk alone for this is my home
And my subsistence.
I silently drift through these darkened paths
I'm a witness to human psyche in decay.
There's nothing here but burntout bodies and souls
A breeding ground for the depraved.
I've plunged beyond the sickest depths of pruriency
What is normal to me is far beneath what is seen as
mere obscenity.
Chorus
Can you feel the pain of these souls deranged
I have lived inside these pathetic minds.
And its menacing psychosis and lust is so dangerous
Sexuality at its most diseased has enslaved us.
I wish I could give you severe details
But now's not the time nor the place.
I've sojourned through the vilest combat zones
And been invovled in acts that are debased.
Virtuous lives are crushed in this malevolent den of thieves
There's no escape from the abduction and rape
of virginity.
Scenic nightmares of brutal selfindulgence
Nothing is sacred especially life.
I completely share my amorality
With the hookers and the hustlers that stalk the night.
Shocking disgusting displays of human indignities
Anything can be achieced in sexual iniquities.
Chorus
I've been seduced into this realm
Why I cannot say...
I've cleansed myself from all that's pure
I've now incurred disgrace.
I can't put my finger on the attraction
I'm not an anomally.
In my domain of abomination
Psychosexualuty...
I have a personal obsession with pain
Dealing receiving to me it's the same
tragic game.
Excruciation that goes unrestrained
To others this pleasure may be insane
or at the lease profane.
Virgins forced to perform unspeakable deeds
Immaculate youth placed in impurity.
The screams of pain I have heard the screams
Of quiet exits but forced entry.
Desperate souls of one accord
with their lives in this sordid world.
Women defiled for that veinnumbing fix
Bestiality this is sick.
Orifices committing disgust
Grotesque forays into macabre lusts.
Why am I here I've been drawn
in this shameless world I belong...
Chorus
Men who pluck children from their families
Teaching a man's rules to this younger breed.
To the blackmarket parents sell their young under eight
Anything older out here is too late
Adolescence is their fate
Snuff films with their discreet mutiliations
Anonymous fiends and confused unwilling victims.
Desecrating unblemished bodies and minds
Breaking and torturing then ending their lives
I have watched them die...
You've been given a glimpse of this pornographic scene
Some of it scares me all of it excites me.
This is my horrible demented hell
Once you're trapped down here I wish you well.
Why am I here I've been drawn
But honestly do I belong
Chorus <start> I gave my life to you and I've worked so hard at it too
Would I do anything other than to raise you to be
The finest men
After all these years of ploughing through the weeds
I have turned wise and grey
With every fibre in me
I have lived to see you grow to be
The finest men
I just followed my trail and I found my way back home
In this light of all I wanted to display for you
I will never leave you alone
In the corners of this universal sky
The completion of the day passes me by
As long as the ways of the light
Will reach your bearing hearts
I will find
The finest men
I came and I saw
I will understand this freedom
And remind you of me
Will you pass me on
My pride
I found in life my way home <start> She lay in the air abandoned from the neck down.
Her flesh splintered across the disenchanted earth.
And in the darkness of the hillside where her body hung cold
the decaying night air cast a shadow across her lifeless body.
The neck stretched until the vertebra in her back snapped shut.
The scars across her skin still weeping as her blood fell back into the earth.
But there will be no resurrection tonight.
Death as we know is final and the fantasy would end here. <start> Free at last
Finally tasting happiness
Five years of hell for nothing
Trapped inside the minds of failures
A wise man once said
That which does not kill us makes us stronger
Thought we were dead
So are we now invincible
Determination perseverance resolution resurrection
Determination perseverance resolution resurrection
Final straw
Underlying ignorance
Consumed by greed and hate 
Kept under the feet of tyrants
Reality kicked in
Raced against time just to start all over
Treated like shit
Pushed aside and expendable
Determination perseverance resolution resurrection
Determination perseverance resolution resurrection
We have become so god damn powerful
We have become so god damn powerful
We have become so god damn powerful
We have become so god damn powerful
We have become so god damn powerful
We have become so god damn powerful
All the beatings you gave us we will use them against you
All the beatings you gave us we will use them against you 
Determination perseverance resolution resurrection
Determination perseverance resolution resurrection
Free at last
Finally tasting happiness
The resurrection resurrection resurrection  <start> As I saw the whore From Babylon whispering her perverted lust
all those impotent priests are running to Samaria's hills.
OOoohh my apocalyptic hatred pull down these false allied for the highest
pleasure
of my tremendous being.
As the empty skies are turning into a slaughtery poisoned fog.
The dark one summons the destruction of thy holy kingdom...
No more light nor hope on earth by now just apocalyptic freedom. By my home

RACING THE APOCALYPSE MANIFESTO
OPEN WIDE THE GATES OF HELL 
Nooo  You christian assholes you will never survive to our father wrath not

Mayhem apocalyptic rites our feast will be forever done as the millenium
black bells chime for satan's return.
Kingdom falls and other ones are raising in his eternal glorification.
satan manifesto will gather us his worthy followers all his hordes
numereous as the sand of the seven seas to finally unleash the so long
awaited holocaust.......
LEAD NORNAGEST
Under the banner of the flaming cross the dark one summons the infernal

As the wooden croos percutted the skull of god your so <> lord
darkness powerful storm
hatred as I am are devastating the field of Samaria.
RACING THE APOCALYPSE MANIFESTO <start> No escape there is no way out
Of this constructed existence
A created image of untrue conception
You cannot find the real you.
Manipulated a hyped invention
Who is this false identity
The ideal person perfect role model
Beneath you can feel the cracks
Now your nerves begin to break
Losing grip now its too late
Perceive this no fallacy
This icon faces insanity
On the verge of mental breakdown
Forgotten realms of madness are found
Now you face the final curtain
Your future life is now uncertain. <start> I'm no longer waiting on the sun to rise
I spent too long just to say goodbye
The horizon changed as I lost my pride
I've spent too many years to say goodbye
Even my darkest hour I have some hope
And even though I'm never sure
I've always known
It's darkest before the light
I'll stand and fight this time
Cause I'm no longer waiting on the sun to rise
I spent too long just say goodbye
The horizon changed as I lost my pride
I've spent too many years to say goodbye
There's a fire buring strong in me tonight
Bars and chains won't hold me back this time
From Milwaukee to the Rocky Mountain line
I've lived way more than you would realize <start> Hail to the Seducer

Worshiiped spirit in matter descended
Through the mists ov the highest mountains led
Out ov darkness ov ignorance
Into the light ov reality
Touch and say
This is the flesh and blood ov mine
Look Atmospheric I
Blessed be who have seen
Fools in the slime
Their world shrills with fear
Kali Yuga shells ov gliphoth manifest
Decline Decline
Beyond the dead words
Going across the gnostic waste
Drifting in infinite experience
From Nowhere to Nowhere
In the dreams ov eld heard we atavistic chant
Zos Kia Cultus NagualHoorLam
Certainty not faith
Instinct  desire  and will
Naught in all all in naught
Touch and say
This is the flesh and blood ov mine
Look Atmospheric I
Blessed be who have seen
By the Fire and Force
I command thee spirits ov the deep
Thoughts  theriomorphic shades
Creep and obey me
Demons  perfected dissolution
In non  atomic fact ov universality
This is my sweet solitude <start> Instrumental <start> Dreams of the murdering art
Mary see through the eyes of the dying
Hear their screams horror seed
Wrapped in human skin entangled in pain
She wishes she will never dream again
Opening the chest heart beats cease
Blade so sharp head and shoulders cut apart
Dreams from the underworld
Dreams of a murders art
Tempted by blood Bleed for me
Close your eyes and let my knife set your soul free
A new victim lay by the killers feet
See the dying vision
A pittyful pray for existence
Death bringer enrich her horror world
Dreams from the underworld
Dreams of a murders art
Tempted by blood Bleed for me
Close your eyes and let my knife set your soul free
Murder  the beginning of her end
Blood  of the deceased
Soul  cleansed by victims weep
Dying  Before her feet
Tears forced by pain
Cut them up and drink from their veins <start> The face I'm beating with my fist
Is pulverized and turned to shit
So all that's left when he is gone
Is skin and blood and pulp and bone
This fucker thought that he could try
And fuck with me no reason why
So now he got what he deserved
A coffin with his grave reserved
Where has all the common sense gone
Can't these fuckers leave the shit alone
Always trying to start some stupid shit
The obituary page is full of it
No death's on my conscience
'Cause they challenged and they lost
No final resistance
Fuck it it's not my loss
Gonna fuck it up
Fuckin' bring it down
The motherfuckers dead
Don't ask me why they had to die
I try to live my fucking life
They are the ones that fucked with me
They paid the price with agony
As the force from anger erupts
Out from deep inside of me
Not a fucking chance to live
Just you bleeding
Cause of death can not be found
Corpses layed out on the floor
Hyperviolent chaos rush
Allout fucking total war
You're dead
Adrenaline rush
Unleashed pain feed
You fucking bleed
I kill once
So then I kill twice
Revenge your death
The final ending released
The face I'm beating with my fist
Is pulverized and turned to shit
So all that's left when he is gone
Is skin and blood and pulp and bone
This fucker thought that he could try
And fuck with me no reason why
So now he got what he deserved
A coffin with his grave reserved
Where has all the common sense gone
Can't these fuckers leave the shit alone
Always trying to start some stupid shit
The obituary page is full of it <start> What have I done to feel these fists from heaven
I have to question
Have I done wrong
What's with this reaction
Am I a mad man
If I walked on water would I sink or drown
I I think I'm lost could I ever be found
Oh when this world comes crashing down
I'll be I'll be the soldier
I'll be the soldier
Oh when this place falls to the ground
I'll be I'll be the soldier
I'll be the soldier
Lord I'm alone
No ain't nobody listening
Oh something's missing
What have I become
To fall far from the graces
Look at the faces yeah
If I held your bible
Would my soul set fire
When that dog day come will I be up by your side
Oh when this world comes crashing down
I'll be I'll be the soldier
I'll be the soldier
Oh when this place falls to the ground
I'll be I'll be the soldier
I'll be the soldier
I guess it's you hey
I guess it's you
That makes me be the bad one
That makes me be the mad one
I guess it's you hey
I guess it's you
That puts these thoughts inside me
It's like you wanna hide me oh yeah
I guess it's you
Have I done wrong
What's with this reaction
Am I a mad man
Oh when this world comes crashing down
I'll be I'll be the soldier
I'll be the soldier
Oh when this place falls to the ground
I'll be I'll be the soldier
I'll be the soldier
Oh when this world comes crashing down
I'll be I'll be the soldier
I'll be the soldier
Oh when this place falls to the ground
I'll be I'll be the soldier

Goodbye 
Goodbye 
Goodbye 
Bye bye 
Yo yo who know the game like me who seen it change like me
I'm the MC'n O.G. from the N.Y.C.
And I ain't never leave the streets the ghetto made me conscious
And I've been doin' it since you rappin' cats was still in diapers
But it seems to me these cats are gettin' too big for their britches
And they're barkin' up the wrong tree callin' my women bitches
I remember when we used to rhyme in the park
But things have changed now they bustin' shots after dark
Now that's a shame these youngsters see me in the streets
Ask me O.G. how you do it make it seem like nothin' to it
Well I never lost a dream the hustle's still inside of me
And never even departed me this rap shit didn't father me
I gave birth to a lot of MC's on this earth
But they're too blind to recognize the truth and it hurts
What would you do if I said goodbye and watched the game crumble
But believe me they tease me this rap shit needs me
Chorus
I see you Lil Mizzo
Tell you somethin' check it
Hey yo I never leave the game how could I
When there's so much to accomplish than bein' broke and stuck in the projects
Come through in a green M niggas dickridin'
Like Damn how he do a song with DMC
Don't worry about it just know I'm in the game now
He was such a cute kid why he sellin' cocaine now
But struggling's past tense I'm rappin' now bought myself a house
With a swimming pool backyard and a glass fence
There's no time for celebration mind elevation
If you ain't searchin' for money what the hell are you chasin'
Go against ICU I'll put this barrel to your back
You know who this is Lil Mizzo and Darryl Mack
I been a man since I got in the hood flow so much niggas get jealous
Like I can't stand when he drop his hood
How could you not respect RunD.M.C.
For bein' the first rappers to get they hand prints in Hollywood
They deserve the respect of a legend and I'm tryin' hard
I can be the best rapper in less than a second
I'm takin' over the industry everybody knows us
I'm only  but my mind is all grown up so whats up
Chorus
I would never leave the game my people love me too much
Because rap is my baby and I watched it grow up
Man I'm still here breathin' my eyes seein'
That these rapper cats deceivin' so don't believe 'em
They got the nerve to rap about cars and iced out jewels
Man you rented it from Jacob you ain't foolin' me or schoolin' D
On how to MC I be the pick of the litter
I've been in the game many years but I'll still spit a winner
Champ my people from the streets in Queens know I'm a hitter
Knockin' balls out the park gettin' physically fitter
Don't duck too slow and don't jump too fast
I roll with young soldiers who put a foot in your ass
They be the new sensation the next generation
Hollis Queens Dirty Jersey California situation
If I kiss the game goodbye before I leave
I would go and fix some fake MC's I'm signin' out DMC
Goodbye
Chorus <start> Eleven thousand and five hundred years ago
The realm of the golden age ruling the world
Thousands of warships ten thousands war chariots
Hundred thousands armed warriors
They are near
Shades appear
From north to south
The warlords are coming
They show no fears
From east to west
People start running
They are shedding tears
Atlantean empire empire burning
Atlantean empire empire burning
Eleven thousand and five hundred years ago
The great wealthy empire colonized the world
Temples of gold mounted with brass
Golden paradise land of dreams
They are near
Shades appear
From north to south
The warlords are coming
They show no fears
From east to west
People start running
They are shedding tears
Atlantean empire empire burning
Atlantean empire empire burning
Eleven thousand and five hundred years ago
Eleven thousand and five hundred years ago
Eleven thousand and five hundred years ago
Eleven thousand and five hundred years ago
Empire empire empire empire
From north to south
The warlords are coming
They show no fears
From east to west
People start running
They are shedding tears
From north to south
The warlords are coming
They show no fears
From east to west
People start running
They are shedding tears
Atlantean empire <start> Day of conceptions
God breathed life from love
Divine miracle
Formed in a secret place
Perfection from a perfect hand
His blueprint I await to see
A look a smell a touch of my son
Blessed gift from one Father to another
Anticipation of innocence
Life outside the womb
One thought of your existence
Anxiousness consumes me
The joy of childhood
See the world through the
Eyes of simple faith
Pure at heart fresh and carefree
A calm before the storm
Contraction begins
Beautiful son of mine
You bring life to my soul
Solomon son of mine
I love you
I will never leave you
Nor forsake you
I love you Solomon
Precious son of mine
God will pursue your spirit
I love you <start> Lack of trust all alone
Lookin' down at the bottom of a hole
I've no trust bare my soul
Are we alone or do we have friends
Or are we just searchin' for a means to an end
What up peace out my boys and all that
But as soon as we leave they talk behind our backs
Low selfimage of the way things are
Either way we lose and we can never go far
'Cause always we'll wonder as to just what's the deal
It just depends on what you feel is real
Perception is everything inside our brains
With much bigger problems no time for games
Of people acting down but it's just a facade
Can't say it to my face isn't that odd
Just what exactly does trust mean
Is it about being down with the scene
Or is it about following your own true heart
And being true to your friends to the end from the start
Just what is wealth it's just how you view it
It's not having to wonder whether or not you might lose it
It can't be about material gain
If you're drowning alone neck deep in pain
To trust and lay your soul on the line
May not be the nature of most humankind
Lookin' over your shoulder is no way to go
So stick with true friends and do without the doubt <start> It's time to put it straight
I dislike the way you act
I said Hey
Get off my back
End of discussion
You're not getting used
None will give you sympathy
If you deal with self abuse
Ever thought about getting a Life
Sick of hearing your lies
You burn down my fuse
When it's me it's a mistake
For you there's always an excuse
Stick to the truth or please shut the fuck up
Qualified bullshit that never seems to stop
Try someone else I won't fall for no lies
Get a life
Throw it in my face cut the bullshit
You sit around and bite your fingertips
A bunch of parasites with covered up tracks
Get off my back <start> So much for reaping what you sow
Isn't time the enemy again
Believing cuts deeper than you know
Never was a natural believer in the end
Through these eyes
Images and stories
Left unheard slowly burn
In these skies are centuries of promises
Unlearned never learned
Holding out what's coming in
Keeps the heart from burning
chorus
With those miracles and dreams
Taking all my senses and colouring between
Miracles and dreams
How can I get by without the harmony within do you know
Tomorrow could be taken from your hand
Yes it can
After this wave your world goodbye
And never kiss your love again
If I'm strong enough
And live long enough
I still believe in those
chorus
The distinction between past present and future is only an illusion.
chorus <start> My head hurts like hell
Can't open my eyes
My clothes are all wet
And I'm freezing right through
Don't know where I am
Or how to get home
My arms feel so numb
And it's hard to get up
My muscles they ache
With every move
I stand on my feet
But my knees feel so weak
Somebody wake me
From this horrible dream
Somebody save me
From this terror I feel
I stumble around
On the soft muddy ground
I call out the name
Of the friends I can't find
But only the wind
And the ravens reply
With every gasp
With every breath
Smoke fills my lungs
And my intestines wrench
With every gasp
The sweet taste of death
The air is full of a thick
Pungent stench
So comes the rain
It's colder than ice
I wash off my face
And open my eyes
And then I see
But wish I were blind
They are all dead
There's blood everywhere
The Norsemen they left
Only death and despair
A stench of flesh
That fills the autumn air
Somebody wake me
From this horrible dream
Somebody save me
From this terror I feel
No one can save me
From this horrible dream
No one can hear me
Or my heartrenching
Screams <start> Keep the faith keep the flame
Although dark horizons come to bring us pain
Feel the air feel the breeze
It's just a matter of time a matter of trust we believe
See a land far beyond
Under the darkened skies lost in foreign hands
We will never forget we will never regret
We never complained what ever we had
Open your eyes no reason to cry
We'll find our way to find our way of life
Under the Colours of Freedom
Break the seal of all our sins
We'll never forget we'll never regret
And the journey begins
Under the flag of our Kingdom
In the garden of endless time
We never will leave we'll always believe
In this glorious sign
Mysterious lights victorious signs
Are spinning around are dazing our paralysed minds
Turning the tide turning the time
Out of the dark ride into the light
Open your mind no reason to cry
To find your way to find our way of life
Under the Colours of Freedom
Break the seal of all our sins
We'll never forget we'll never regret
And the journey begins
Under the flag of our Kingdom
In the garden of endless time
We never will leave we'll always believe
In the almighty sign
It's just a matter of time
Or just a matter of faith
We never forget we never regret
Raise the flag of the light
The colours of Freedom you'll get
We'll never forget we'll never regret
And the journey begins
Under the flag of our Kingdom
In the garden of endless time
We never will leave we'll always believe
In this glorious sign
Under the Colours of Freedom
Break the seal of all our sins
We'll never forget we'll never regret
And the journey begins
Under the flag of our Kingdom
In the garden of endless time
We never will leave we'll always believe
In this glorious sign <start> When you're drowning
when you're freezin'
when you're feeling cold
There's a light in the darkness
as the elder always told.
When the winter's coming closer
and the autumn's passing by
Then the world will sink in silence
and I think we all should try.
Oh I want to live my life in a fairy tale
Where the end is always good and never sad.
Show me the way to another world
Where the sun is always shining in the and
And we fight back the tears and we lose our fears
Let the world remain in silence for a while
Sun in our minds in a world full of ice
Let silence remain for a little while.
Somebody came and slammed the door
took the feelin' away from our hearts.
And the horror took hold of a place
in our hearts filled with love.
What is left behind the ice
behind the make up and the lies
Tell me what goes on inside our minds
There is a hole in our sky
getting bigger growing wide
No more answer but we hold the line
See and hear what we have done to us all
we want to be free more than anything
Do you hear what I say to you
We will make it through the sun shall shine.
Hear the words we say and see the light of day
We never will be free until the sun is shining for us all
Carry on carry on and make our dreams come true
And for a little while we stay together
Carry on carry on may all our lovin' stay
And for a little while we stay together forever
Together forever. <start> Itsushika furi dashita kono ame no

Searching for my angel
I know i must believe I'm not wrong
Wanna hear her voice with no hesitation
Just can't hear her voice
Searching for my angel
I know I'm sure now I'm not wrong
Wanna hear her voice with no hesitation
Still can't hear her voice
oh please let me hear your voice the angel of salvation
Wonder if she talks to me and holds my body certainly
so please let me hear your voice the angel of salvation
Wonder if she takes on me wonder if she gives her love to me

Who can balance
Time can not wane any slower than this.
This will be the first and last time that we ever coexist.
We could have had the wealthiest harvest in years
if we had not burned down every single crop we had.
We tested the will as we wagered our pride.
Is this the end of our lives Is this the end
Restrain and repel the future in your hands.
Slowly break the stares.
Tear away the air.
After we are long gone
will we have the chance to remember the times we once shared
the strength we must bare
The strength we must reveal disclose unmask unfold.
It would have been really nice to escort you today
but I can't I decline today is the last day of the world.
We could have been the luckiest people right now
if we had not gambled away everything we had. <start> In the morning you try to recover
But you still got the red in your eyes
Then you get up and look in the mirror
And you see the beast arise
Got a big red nose from the overdose
And somebody else's eyes
And you think to thee is it really me
And you have to realiaze
The price that you pay for a moment like this
Is never too high cause you're still doing it
Don't you know that we all stand in line
Our future dreams are just a waste of time
Our future  is a madhouse and we all are movin' in
Our world  needs some action cause there's nothing left to gain
Take your baggy things are ready
You only need to come
Join this century's schizoid clan
The rooms are primed and done
The price that you pay for a moment like this
Is never too high cause it perfectly fits
Don't you think that you are wasting time
Insanity is just a state of mind
Our future  is a madhouse...
Solo KaiDirkKai
Our world  is a madhouse in the gutter come on in
Our world  needs some action satisfaction till the end
Our world  we need sex and crime to supply our minds
An amazing time come on in
Our world  and we party on till our life is done
Just to waste on time  till the end <start> You're all so fucking hostile you're all so fucking mean
With your triple K complexion screaming keep our country clean
With your triple K superior picknick and your burning cross parade
You're all dressed up in white boys you're real American made
Hypocrite that's the name you wear
But I really don't care what you say
No bullshit you're so full of it
It comes out of your mouth everyday
I don't care what you say I don't care what you say
You want to be somebody special so you take it to the extreme
Waste a Jew a black or two and wipe their race out clean
You practice on a target but your guns still full of lead
You hunt them down ten on one and you aim to hit the head
Repulsive you really make me hate all the things you deny and you fake
Primitive you show no respect for all the lives you take and forsake
I don't care.....
Your mouths are so enormous and your dicks are just so small
You're just to dumb to realize you ain't got no brains at all
There ain't nothing in your deadheads that I could ever even understand
And you've still got the guts to tell us all that we should join the klan
I truly believe you're deaf dumb and blind
I believe you're unable to look
I truly believe you're really out of your mind take a look in the history book
I don't care..... <start> Burn the instructions or plague the inventor
Quick easy and painless
I'm a careless romantic
Wandering the streets
Luring strangers in the dark
If they follow in my footsteps
Then I'll love them all blind
If you want to make a scene
Then you've gotta make a scene
I'll put my hands on you
You put your hands on me
If you want to make a scene
I wasn't looking for trouble
But trouble found me
You fucked with the wrong son of a bitch.
I caught you staring it's not your fault
I killed the lights 'cause I saw it all
I caught you staring it's not your fault
I kissed your lips but not for too long
Tick tock tick tock
the hour is up
Told to be anxious
You're a bit out of line
Sew it up like every other time
Unamused at the table by the bedroom
They're all mine
If you want to make a scene
Then you've gotta make a scene
You fucked with the wrong son of a bitch
You put your hands on me
I'll put my hands on you
You fucked with the wrong son of a bitch
Sew it up like every other time
So in love like every other time
The needle and thread make me shiver
The red on your hands spells out martyr

I killed the lights 'cause I saw it all

I swear to God I watched you fall
Your perfect picture left its mark
I kissed your lips but not for too long <start> Sore am I calling the pyre
pure and light deep down the mire
So goodnight my firefly dancer
wear the light the fire will take your
Heart and love you
heart and drown you
heart and leave you
a sun to carry me home
frail am I free from desire
old and wise my god and so tired
So goodbye my surface dancer
in your light the fire did take my
Heart and loved you
heart and drowned you
heart and burned you
my sun come carry me home <start> Thus the story is told of the war of the rings
Of the dark lord and the orcs and the foulest of beings
Of the plague and the darkness that spread like a fire
Of the eagles in the sky which soar so much higher
Of the wizards and the dwarfs and the mightiest of all men
Of the halfling and the task which carried all the burden
Of the kings and the queens and the forest filled with elves
Thus it is told on the greatest of all tales
Beware the black hand reaching from above
The armies of evil stretching like an ocean
Wolves and men engulfed in a blood bath
The armies of the virtuous will spread their wrath
Majority of the war rests on he who carries the ring
Into the mouth of the malefic king
If the one is cast into the eternal fire
The good will likely triumph and the world will again be brighter
Fiercely fighting raging dying thousands slain cast down not in vain
Day after day night by night mighty catastrophe middle earth has ever seen
Thus the story is told of the war of the rings
Of the dark lord and the orcs and the foulest of beings
Of the plague and the darkness that spread like a fire
Of the eagles in the sky which soar so much higher
Of the wizards and the dwarfs and the mightiest of all men
Of the halfling and the task which carried all the burden
Of the kings and the queens and the forest filled with elves
Thus it is told on the greatest of all tales. <start> I'm still crying
One final touch of your hand
But I just don't understand
You're out of sight out of mind
Not out of my heart
The memory of a kiss
I sit back and reminisce
How we'd laugh a day away
Now my day turns to rain without you
Well I think and I pray
And you show me the way
But I'm still crying

But a laugh and a smile
Only last for a while
'Cause I'm still crying

Can I think of a time
That you weren't on my mind
Inside I'm dying

Should have known from the start
That you'd tear me apart
And my lover lover would break my heart

I hold your spirit within
So precious to me since then
Can I hold on to the dreams
Those sweet memories
Oh Lord help me to move on
Face that my lover is gone
Well I know it had to end
My lover became a friend
And that's you that's you
Well I think and I pray
And you show me the way
But I'm still crying

But a laugh and a smile
Only last for a while
'Cause I'm still crying

Can I think of a time
That you weren't on my mind
Inside I'm dying

Should have known from the start
That you'd tear me apart
And my lover lover

That you left me all alone

Got to save my soul

But I'm on my own

But 'till then I'll still be crying
Well I think and I pray
And you show me the way
But I'm still crying

But a laugh and a smile
Only last for a while
And I'm still crying

Can I think of a time
That you weren't on my mind
But I'm still cyring
Should have known from the start
That you'd tear me apart
And my lover lover would break my heart
ad lib to fade <start> In vein and valor
Be what they fear
Their days are over
Our nights are here
With hate and heartache
I'll strike you down
With rage and rapture
I crush your crown
No more gods
No more graves
No more love
No more hate
Hell hammer comes down
Onto their blade
Our world of widows
Needs to be saved
It's now or never
Victim or victory
Rebel or regret
Who you are and who you claim to be
No more heroes
No more
No more
In my world of enemies
I walk alone <start> You turn off the light
And you won't make no difference
You hear the echoes fade away
When the cries of despair
Turn to a sound in distance
The road ain't divine
Black are the wings that will carry me home
Tower in the night up to the sky
Carry our remains angel of light
To the dark side of Paradise
On wings of fire to the back side of light
From Babylon to Paradise I crawl
On through shadows I've seen iniquity galore
Been worth a detour and some more
The snake in the backyard of heaven
Venus guiding to the back door of love
From Babylon to Paradise I'm drawn
On through shadows I've seen iniquity galore
Been worth a detour and some more
The snake in the backyard of heaven
I feel how I faint as I'm crossing the Acheron
Wash away my innocence
Was I losing my away
When the sky has been blackened
This short cut of evil
Where do they drive me where will I go
Days gone by time after time
I'm going insane losing my mind
To the dark side of Paradise
On wings of fire to the back side of light
From Babylon to Paradise I crawl
On through shadows I've seen iniquity galore
Been worth a detour and some more
The snake in the backyard of heaven
Venus guiding to the back door of love
From Babylon to Paradise I'm drawn
On through shadows I've seen iniquity galore
Been worth a detour and some more
The snake in the backyard of heaven
On wings of fire to the back side of light
From Babylon to Paradise I crawl
On through shadows I've seen iniquity galore
Been worth a detour and some more
The snake in the backyard of heaven
Venus guiding to the back door of love
From Babylon to Paradise I'm drawn
On through shadows I've seen iniquity galore
Been worth a detour and some more
The snake in the backyard of heaven <start> Living all alone do I need security no
I got  locks upon my doors
Do they give me guarantees no
I bought a gun now 
I have a gun now 
I wear a gun now 
And I always keep it loaded
What's going on I hold my breath
To hear the noise yeah 
My heart is beating in my throat
Did I heard a voice no
I bought a gun now 
I have a gun now 
I wear a gun now 
And I always keep it loaded
I'm living with a growing fear
I'm aiming at every single noize I hear
My dog's going crazy
But I'm glad that he's around
Even though we can't communicate
We both listen for a sound
My dog's going crazy
But I'm glad that he's around
Even though we can't communicate
We both listen for a sound
Do I have the door shut my room my windows locked
From the moment I see a stranger
On my property I will blow him away
From the moment I find someone in my house I won't hesitate
From the moment I hear someone
From the moment I see someone
From the moment I'll shoot someone
And I'll do it anyway <start> Richard graduated from a medical academy three months ago. He passed the exams
perfectly. He's been working as a cardiosurgeon for a week now. He was to face
his very first patient at a September night. He was dashing and yet fearful.
His bread and cheese for saving other people's lives. The patient is . It is
his second heart attack. Richard makes the first cut. Scalpel in his hand
moves smoothly like a conductor's baton. Arteries make visible. Richard
feels warm blood drops on his forehead. Then he feels his stomach in his
mouth. He used to see intestines when he served his apprenticeship. But today
he couldn't stand it. The dinner he ate an hour ago flows down from his
covered mouth onto the patient's torso. Pieces of semidigested meal mingle in
a sevencentimetre long surgeon cut. Vomited matter ornaments the patient's
torso and soothes him. Richard though his job would be different. His
conscience exhausted him. <start> Avatars of powers from four worlds
Bathed me in jewels of belief
I drink the nectar of Goddess  my eternal mistress
I am Shiva Hadit or Beast himself
And multitude of forms surpasses myself
I kneel before Isis I  her god and slave
Coiled serpent lifts up his head and looks in my eyes
Third power and third eye create The One
I am who I am not
I negate and confirm
I transgress it is real
Wheels of change turn with my breath
I touch the red  hot firmament 
And stars are falling down onto every side of world
With my tongue I penetrate scarlet abysses of Kteis
Overflowing my body with thrill and heart with warmth
Suddenly I'm shooting forth venom
'Cause I I became a snake who rounds her flesh
Here and now here and now <start> I am standing.
Instead of my face the silent surface of the lake
Reflects the profile of an innocent infant
He used to escape from the world crying
And now he cannot belive it's the end
Hesitating smile on his face bright tear in his eyes
In his glittering glance the life passes
His shadow sinks under the water
As if here the earth and the sky ended
On the corner of a dark room
I silently begin the first steps of a new life
Where there is no light there is nobody to talk to
I build the walls of my loneliness alone
Where the darkness swallows the light
Where the wall up to the sky does not allow
Your words to light a new candle
Chorus
In the cold corner the reminder of your picture
Draws me the fireplace and the chill winter night
Or the stars of the hot summer sky
Where for me the angel left her cold body behind
Walls surround me that i built
When i was a child brick by brick
This world disappointed me
I am afraid there is nothing strange in saying this
Nothing but water if front of me i have my face again
The child is gone i am only gazing
My gregish temple reminds me
That i can depart bound for the unseen
Chorus
In the cold corner the reminder of your picture
Draws me the fireplace and the chill winter night
Or the stars of the hot summer sky
Where for me the angel left her cold body behind <start> She
calls out
to
you
From behind
sin's
doorway
Her  years have left her so calloused so diseased...
Oh
still
she's
begging
you
Like you wish your daughter would...
Half a world away
Betrayal
fills
her
eyes
It's the sick of the unkind years...
And scars start to form
A
tangled
web
of Shame
Across her bleeding tortured flesh...
And you want more
to take her down with you
beneath the crimson tide
Slip...silently...under...the...water
 Lost in the rapture
You're running fast from the past
But it's freeze framed...you can't see what's beyond.
Her voice keeps echoing...your name...you keep remembering.
The world so cold to you
You get what you gave
The world so cold it's
true
When the red...turns...to...grey
Chorus
When she's on her knees...she's saying a prayer for me
And through the frenzied feed...she's saying a prayer for me
And though the waiting tide offered sanctuary...I know
She's saying a prayer for me
She just needed...someone to love her...
She just needed a kind word...
Crawling calling across your memories.
Torture you. <start> From the simple idea of Change Blindness our minds are not as they seem.
An entire existence revolving around what we can't acknowledge.
A brain function we'll never admit as defeat
A constant determination to find truths
To find reason to find comfort.
An unspoken religion in being the alldominant
This is what we call a brain.
This step will allow the universe to run it's course.
We have a short ticket and a lot of it is in hiding
So lets take in what we can for now.
Just like here on Earth
Hide what others can't understand.
The universe is the biggest threat
Overachiever that commands attention.
Brute force of hysterical reasoning's
There will always be a Marfa.
Close one eye.
Step to the side.
As humans we could never be content with knowing all
Yet we can't be content with the fact that our brains will never know.
A mental surgery
A never ending journey a technological drawback.
Pushing us further from our natural minds.
Even things created by other humans should be
Considered in the experiment of an entire species understanding.
A magicians pure joy
A mind bend for the common folk
Follow the straight line

The ultimate deceiver
Close one eye.
Step to the side.
We will always be part of the great misdirect
Stepping in and stepping out.
We will always be part of the great misdirect
Mirrors and Obfuscation. <start> Leave me with my tragedies
those who stick to me like wet leaves
in the  sunlight.
My face is frozen byt my eyes still see
for I am in your dreams and fantasies
Leave me with my misery
the one who cover me with glory
and enter me like a slave in the dry sunlight.
That light that burned my face
to what you can see a tragedy...
...it sculptured me...
For I am your dreams and fantasies.
Dreams like deserts.
Dreams like stone.
Dreams from flesh to bone.
Dreams like deserts.
Dreams that moan
for I am in your twilightzone.
Leave me with my destiny the one who lick my scars.
The one who grants its flesh to me and to my marbled anxiety.
My soul is frozen my flesh is weak for I am dreams and fantasies. <start> Bloody legs and bloody hands
Bloody necks and bloody heads
A smell of sulphur lays over me
A smell of mould also too
What I see I know it's true
A battlefield strewed with dead bodies
Awful sight please give me peace
Deliver me from evil's work
Is it a dream or is it real
Is it illusion or reality
I'm a man
Not an armed murderer
I must leave this state of terror
I must run far far away
Please hear my call I must leave now
I tell no lies that's not a joke
Back from the war
Lay down to the ground
Back from the war
Lay down to the grount <start> Why am I taking all your time
All I want is what was mine
Am I talking to your inner feelings
Time didn't conjure up a cure
Is there anybody more
I can't turn away forever
Who's to lose who's to win
It's all about the state you're in
Who's to know
It's all about to burn wind has changed the fire has turned
It's all about to burn just like it never started
It's all about to burn take away my better days because
It's all about to burn
Nothing's for nothing so I've heard
There's a reason this occurred
I'm not talking 'bout your superstition
Easy or not the time has come

That you've abused for far too long
We're in the hour of the fallout now
And there's nobody who can save our souls
Rise up for the things worth saving
Rise up for what we'll destroy
Rise up for something
Or you will be lost as you fade out inside of the noise
This is our wake up call
We have to pull it together
We have to save what we can
So put aside what you thought that you loved
And face the end
These bars our hearts must hold
Are only locked by those in charge of this broken world
And when their walls fall down
So will the keys to unlocking what we have never found
We are the children of love
Lost inside of this war...
We wear the scars on our hearts
But we don't know what they're for
we don't know what they're for
We are the noise of generation now.
We are the noise of generation now.
We are the noise of generation now.

Which I felt inside
Awaken to a new life
The temple of unborn child
Hollow sounds of world
Like an ancient tales
Were the prophecies
Of great Judgement Day
On that shiny day
The separation came
Like the prophecy
Of my coming End
Acute sharps of the rocks
Which wound my feet
The roots of fear
Have grown into my skin
Sometimes I stop to hide
Underneath the linen of his arms
After that on sleepless night
I sing sweet lullaby
For my lonliness
I will come back there someday
And the rustle me with its prayer
Mother Earth will cover me
The Nature will destroy the body structures
As lightly as she had built them before
The Act of Destruction
Will redeem the miracle of birth
We will rise from dead <start> Fighting our way through
We break through the day

The pain we inflict always takes
Destroy all fear defy all pain
Taking it back we regain
Manifestation our mutilation
The masochist watches and waits
I am awake overthrow rebellion of the mind
Overthrow overthrow overtake
Turbulent unrest with blood on the streets
The pressure that builds detonates
Collapse of the system violent resistance
Fueling the fire of our hate
Destroy your fear defy your pain
Taking it back we regain
Manifestation our mutilation
The masochist watches and waits
I am awake overthrow rebellion of the mind
Overthrow overthrow overtake
Uprising of our time
Overthrow I am awake
Overthrow overtake

Somewhere someday you will stand before it too
Trust me there is a never ending mountainside to climb for you too

Go into your mountainside
To enter one's mountainside

Lust and passion and pain as sinful gift
Wildfire in the heart of man uncontrollable
I'm the creature set ablaze with God's despised sin
Grant me irresistibility power infinite

Sexual rites to praise your name
Sitri Twelveth of the great Ioa Sabao

Lust and passion and pain as sinful gift
Wildfire in the heart of man uncontrollable
I'm the creature set ablaze with God's despised sin <start> Woe
Blame it on the rain.
Whoa
Blame it on the name game.
Sizeup suit up selfesteem.
Tiedown dressdown fight in the dogdays.
Wolf nights
Introspection and longing are a feverish solitaire.
In fact it's a lot like masturbation.
When you win you beat yourself.
Seesaw hear  say.
Saysaw heresy.
Stimulus responsive.
Stimuli responded.
Let's pick a definition
Undue sense of ones own arrogance or a family of lions
Yeah I'm afraid.
I don't want to die.
Not now.
Not ever.
It's a harsh reality right
It's the most offensive truth.
Those songs you'll hear when you're deaf.
What will they sound like when there's no sound at all
Footsteps you see in the dark.
Footsteps you see
Cat and mouse is a game of subterfuge.
The mind scratches itself to pieces.
Spatup.
Chew it down or leave the entrails to dry in the sun.
In summation fright is nothing more than a collection of preemptive suicides.
Do what you do to be alive.
It's a massacre outside that hole wandering threeblind mrs. butcher.
Suspense
it's that cat doc he scares me to death
Confesses the mouse to the shrink. <start> There's something cold inside of us.
There's something empty inside out hearts.
The bittersweet harmony of gentle crimes.
Can't you see it's burning.
Afraid of being honest afraid of showing pride.
The shade of selfdeception it's rising.
A little black devil want's to be free again.
A little black devil yearns for his dignity.
Return... repent... deliver us from evil.
Open your heart open your heart for me.
I'm on the verge of thinking but i can hardly tell.
What drives us on and on i'm shaking.
A little black devil want's to be free again.
A little black devil yearns for his dignity.
Return  Open your arms .
Repent  Await your fallen star .
Remind  Open your heart .
Shine bright like the sun. It's  shine on...
forevermore. Defying what i used to be.
Defying my belief Defying what i sacrificed.
Pretending sanity. <start> Thee I invoke born less one
All woman pure predator
Where in conspiracy and impulse dwell
Like a seething fall from grace
Thee I worship
Thou art darkest Gabrielle
No church shall bar our path
Seductive Evil drink your fill
Of the bleeding Christ in your arms
You are in my dreams
The darkness in my eyes
The rapture in my screams
Black Goddess arise
Nothing will keep us apart
We could kill them all
If our desire tore free
Our union is one sweet sinful Eve
And the night draws in beside her
As we embrace the dark side by side
I pour my soul to those eyes full of fire
To harvest the seed ploughed inside her
Archangel snare the flesh
Suck dry the ebbing wound
Leave them lifeless and broken
My beloved
Oh how I craved for you
You so pure and otherworldly
With your scent of winter
Am I to bleed myself dry to see your delight
And the fear retreats forever

When my secrets are buried in thine

Under seven stars we came together

To plot the new age's decline

Ishtar my Queen come forth to me
And help me seize my future from the House of Death
That in the release of immortality
I should slay their fucking Nazarene
Ah the lies the Jew I kill for you
Hidden lusts will break the gates and swarm
As love secretes the thrill for war
The virgin raped shall seek to whore
Shewolf bare your snarling jaw <start> Tendons and muscles of steel.
And the blaze of lightning in its eyes.
White as the snow on the hills.
And it's reins that I hold they are mine.
This stallion and sword in exchange
for my heart and both of my eyes.
The ravens of swift wings my sight
Surely now victory must be mine.
Eight legged stallion of mine.
Run with the speed of the winds.
Eight legged stallion I stride.
Run as if you carried wings.
I paint thee with the blood from my veins
Images of origin long lost.
I adorn your white mane and tail
With the stars that fell from the sky.
A glade in the Eternal deep dark woods
Midnight hours
Sitting by his campfire alone one night the young man is approached by
the Woodwoman. She asks him to follow her to her den where she promises him
magic for the price of his young heart. Eager to win the upcoming duel he
entrusts his heart into her wooden hands for the ability to survive every
cut or slit by his adversary.
And thus he had met the Woodwoman... <start> all is lost
my will to live was taken today
the fire that used to burn
my heart
blown out cold
by winds too great
to hold at bay
all is lost
purpose and cause
betrayed
humilty torn
from my fingers
snatched
hope has turned
and clouded grey
who will take the pain
and shield me
shape my heart
and never leave me
empty or invisible
who will take the pain away <start> This is how the lucky feel
How the blessed think
Like daybreak in spring
The sun on a spring morning
Like the flat brink of a cloud
Like a dark night in autumn
But how do I feel
In my gloomy depths
A black winter day
No darker than that
Gloomier than an autumn night <start> Music Mikael Dahl  Lyrics Mikael Dahl
A little child has changed our world
A light in the dark a miracle
Forevermore her spirit will illuminate our lives
With open arms and open minds
we make her one of our kind
In unity we now welcome her with our song
Chorus
Spread your wings and fly we will take you high
Child of Rock
You were born and bound to the Heavy sound
Child of Rock
Trust us when we say Take the Metal way
Solo Dahl
Life is too short to throw away
Don't waste no time live here and today
There may be tears along the way but we'll be here for you
There is no right there is no wrong
What you will need is in our song
The Only Rule is all for one and one for all
Chorus
Solo Nyberg Dahl
Bridge
When we're dead and gone
you'll have to carry on
Show them that you're strong
and always remember our song
Chorus
Oh oh child you where born to rock
Oh oh child you where born to rock
Oh oh child you where born to rock
Oh oh child you where born to rock
We were all born to rock <start> Here I'll carve the tale of the land we explored.
Stranded in a place I thought was fertile and calm.
I didn't know what hostile world laid ahead.
We were protected Anubis judge of the dead.
Cursing the insects search for water in a sunburnt land.
We will go forward I will persevere and never look back.
So they called me a son of a god ironically as they laid me to rest.
Twice bitten twice struck.
Lost motherland has swallowed us up.
I didn't know what hostile world laid ahead.
We were protected.
Anubis judge of the dead.
Read the glyphs they tell my story.
I'm the lost Pharaoh's son.
Seeking out the ancient myth of the great southern land.
Never again to see the waters of Mer.
Stuck within this southern land.
We can only defer. <start> Do you believe in honesty
You'll have to find your destiny
There may be times when things go wrong
You're gonna win if you are strong
So many boundaries to break
A million tasks you'll have to take
The road that leads you there is long
But in the end you'll be the one
Just raise your voice and sing
Sing this song
Then you'll be the one
Who takes the victory
Take your time
And try to hold the line
Then you will get it all
The years of innocence are gone
You've gotta show where you belong
You know what's wrong and what is right
Just force your goals and hold on tight
There'll be no mountain that's too high
You'll never fail so won't you try
The battle only just begun
And if you win you'll be the one
So let me hear your voice
Sing this song
Then you'll be the one
Who takes the victory
Take your time
And try to hold the line
Then you will get it all <start> Instrumental <start> What's your pleasure
No one needs to know
No one needs to know
I'm in league with strangers I'm talking all the time
How's the weather
When I need the danger I find it every time
Come whatever
'Cause I'm damned if I'll be chastised
For my healthy wholesome pastimes
And I pray that I'll remain forever more
In the pleasure room the pleasure room
The pleasure room the pleasure room
No one needs to know
Is the weakness winning Scared of what you'll find
Pain or pleasure
If your dream are damning are you the forgiving kind
For now forever
All at once I feel the weight of what I've seen
And how I've prayed
That one day I'll be safe forever more
In the pleasure room the pleasure room
The pleasure room the pleasure room
No one needs to know
As I weep inside my prison cell
I keep alive my private hell
I pray that I'll remain forever more
In my pleasure room my pleasure room
My pleasure room my pleasure room
My pleasure room my pleasure room
My pleasure room my pleasure room
No one needs to know
No one needs to know
No one needs to know
No one needs to know
No one needs to know <start> I'll stand knee deep in your ridicule.
Your tongue flickers as threats are made.
I've saved you a seat in hell.
Lets begin.
You can shove glass down my throat.
I need your fists against my flesh.
That would move me an honest inch.
I am through with you.
Turn your cameras off.
Show me something real.
You are nothing now without your friends.
I'll cut you to ribbons.
My favorite color of confetti.
It's hard to threaten me with a brick in your mouth. <start> I must be out of my mind as I hear you call
My name is even though I can't see you anywhere
Surely this feeling is coming from something
Someone gave me yesterday as I searched for you
And I hear you call
I hear you call my name
But when I turn around
There's nothing to be found
I must be dreaming a dream of a lunatic
My fingers taste like some strawberry icecream
I hear you call my name but I don't think it's
the same I heard you whisper in my ear <start> Instru <start> Supernatural thoughts in my head
Confusing me dead
Like I'm stuck in limbo instead
I'm living ahead FUCK
It's unexplainable I'm irrational
When I go interstellar perpetual
On another dimension get it
Do you see the bright light above
You weren't supposed to be here you know this
But who am I to judge
In the end we're all just foreign beings
Addicted to the touch
I didn't want to like you
But now I'm falling in love
The type of love you give me
Is feeling like the drugs
Let's get abducted
Let's get abducted
Let's get abducted
Extraterrestrial life as our life was taken
It's not that we'd seem to run away and hide
They just want to rage hard
It's unexplainable I'm irrational
When I go interstellar perpetual
On another dimension get it
Do you see the bright light above
Pass the bottle pass the blunt
Press repeat now we're all losing touch
Unexpected unexplored
Go with the flow because I'm getting bored
I didn't want to like you
But now I'm falling in love
The type of love you give me
Is feeling like the drugs
Let's get abducted
Let's get abducted
Let's get abducted
I didn't want to like you
But now I'm falling in love
The type of love you give me
Is feeling like the drugs
Pass the bottle pass the blunt
Press repeat now we're all loosing touch
Unexpected unexplored
Go with the flow because I'm getting bored
Pass the bottle pass the blunt
Go with the flow
Let's get abducted
Let's get abducted
Let's get abducted
Put me in your spaceship and take me somewhere new
Get me out of here
Riding something new <start> Away away. Im asleep.
Don't wake me wake me up this time.
Wake me wake me up this time.
In the end i'll sleep no more.
Don't wake me wake me up this time
Wake me wake me up this time. <start> Finally the purifying storm
First we die then be reborn
So flock the banner of The Return now fight and die
Many head serpent is here at our side
Wagnerian end the grand finale is here
Awash with red blood rebirth is near
Feel wind of Mayhem against your face
Bugle divine can be heard throughout space
If in the heat of battle you will have doubt
Just kill them all and let their God sort them out
The tales of this day will replace tomorrows weep
For when thou wind doth saw then storm thou shall reap
On the final day
The angel heart lies cold Under The Sign
And crimson still the frozen Blood On Ice
Drawn on walls in blood of goats the Octagon
The vagrant souls will chant the Requiem until the Twilight is long gone
Suck the leaves of otherness and lie down with the facces goddes
Eat from her rotten flesh there is no life before death
Now the sky is crimson with blood of angels
Kneel before the voice face the anger of God
Day of wrath <start> bleed...
silent are tombs of our youth
as we lay here exhausted
with pictures of long lost friends
embraced by cold loneliness
I yearn for a breath
in this twilight of my life
as my seasons slowly
turn to grey
weak butterfly children
with broken wings
they try to follow
pale rays of light
so don't you leave me here
for every word is a freezing hurt
swansong of my withered hopes
last departure for my angels <start> Come lama arrigginita
Il mio orgoglio soggiace
Nel fodero
Di una gieriera ipocrisia
Riplender ancora l'acciaio
Tenebre... dell'eternit
Il sangue nemico
Laver la ruggine
E il dolore
Orgoglio
Come lama lucente
Nel fodero brilla
Pronto a colpire
Pronto a morire
Sanza paura...
Brilla nel buio e fendi l'ocsurit.
HAGAKURE 
Il fragore della battaglia
Mi atterrisce
Le grida dei caduti
Echeggian nella menta
La paura incombe
E frena il valore
Nelle orbite vuote
Della Signora Silente...
Nelle orbite vuote della Signora
Silente voglio spingere il mio
Sguardo e rispondere al ghigno
Beffando con un sorriso di sfida
Senza paura
Pronto a colpire...
Con fanatico ardore
Fino alla fine...
Per orgoglio cadr.
Nessun pensiero nessuna
Rifflessione. Vuoto perfecto.
Eppure dentro qualcosa si muove...

Una lama spezzata pu essere forgiata
Combattere e morire
Per onore...
In un'anima assolutamente priva
Di pensieri e di emozioni
Nemmeno la tigre trova posto
Per i feroci artigli

I pensieri bloccano il mio animo
Il volere vinto dalle paura...
Come la luna nel fiume
L'occhio la vede
Ma la mano non l'afferra

Una nova lama...
Un giorno briller... <start> Why do you look at me
And haunt me in my dreams
I don't need this anymore
The things you've done to me
Let's keep them in the past
Chorus
I don't 
I don't need this anymore
Yea yea yea
Some say I'm crazy
Some say I was a fool
I don't need this anymore
The way you used me
Nothing but your tool
Chorus
I've always listened
And it's always about you
I don't need this anymore
The door is open
And it's time for you to finally leave
I don't 
I don't need this anymore
Yea yea yea
Yea yea yea <start> Every one of us is lost against ourselves
And pushing through the constant struggle of forward thought
This thing we call humanity
Has brought us down and has us caught
Is this what I've become A callous uncaring soul
That allows the will of flesh to dominate and control
This is my counter attack
Starve the self and empower the soul
This path I chose once again made whole
Torn between self and soul
With first step forward
I've become a new creation
Free from self and thinking clearly
My soul chokes the last impurities from my flesh
And I'm given a second chance... but this time
I let myself die <start> In the eyes of the mighty domain and its evil
Doctrines there is no trace of romance
But the fears that grow
no one can watch his next into the eyes
You killed the poetry of mine
A long time ago  NOW
How many times have you given me rage
When your words were mendacious
And your laughter insane how many times
Have you written lampoons about my life
And desires about my pleasure and pain
I bare my fangs to you look at my face and
You'll stare into my mind and you'll watch
The eyes of the tyrant  eyes of the night
The eyes of the tyrant  eyes of the night
Back from the hades into the daylight
Back from the hades into the daylight
King of tonight tell me what should I do
Should I die in glory should I raise my fist
The Crime of my deads is the frolic I need
I won't die on my knees I will kill to resist
The chagrin of the damned cries the tears of
Romance lord of uprightness take me now
The empire of the sad the empire of the mad
My feelings were killed so long ago
Yeah we are eternal we are immortal
There is a trace of glory in our hands
Majestic and wild we stand and we fight
Soon your blackened pride will be fading away
You'll realize you'll had been walking astray
Never tame the wicked I'm a tyrant tonight
Back from the hades into the light
Back from the hades into
Uh now here we go <start> So much for breathing my cloud nine fell from grace. Loss of everything where is my identity. If I could only find what is left me. So much for letting go when you have nothing left to hold. The words that slid off your tongue my everything. Your nothing I know that I don't mean much to you but you mean the world to me. Devotion an undying dead. The harrowing bleed you out of me the he said she said falsity. Leave it be I just want to go home. So much for letting go. I won't be dying with me no not this time. Becoming by undoing him. Sacrifice the ultimate devotion. So much for saving yourself. It can never be love. I can never be sold like the blood they call love. I am a stranger. I will not I have not I can never be like him. <start> I can see them running towards me
All the time they steal my dreams
The ghosts of past and sorrow
All the time they steal my dreams
When I take a walk outside whispers will surround my head
I can hear the echo of my voice a hundred times or more
They shout they carry on
They whisper on my sorrow
They shout all night long
But the whispers will not end
And the whispers will not end
The ghost of past is showing me all the good times that have gone
 Now just a shadow on the wall
The rose is so fragile but still so everlasting
The ghost of sorrow is recalling all the damage done
Now just a brick off from the wall
The rose is so strong but
It won 't be 'till the end NO
I can see them running towards me
All the time they steal my dreams
The ghosts of past and sorrow
All the time they steal my dreams
When I take a walk outside whispers will surround my head
I can hear the echo of my voice a hundred times or more
They shout they carry on
They whisper on my sorrow
They shout all night long
But the whispers will not end
And the whispers will not end
The ghost of past is showing me all the good times that have gone
 Now just a shadow on the wall
The rose is so fragile but still so everlasting
The ghost of sorrow is recalling all the damage done
Now just a brick off from the wall
The roses so fragile forever will fade away with the tide of life
But this night will hold them on
Chorus
Oh I want to see when I was a child
All the emotions the smiles and the cries
Now that I see never it hides the neverending nights
Remember the flash the crowd was no more
A light that surrounds you never before
Now that I see never it hides the neverending nights
At the end of this horrid night whispers stopped to haunt my dreams
All emotions cast inside my mind a hundred times or more... no more... <start> Originally released by Darkthrone in  on the album Soulside Journey.

Into the abyss I fall
and Dark is the reich of the dead.
A portal to reach to the side
where bodies fall from the sky.
Solitude and Peace of Mind.
Entombed in Cromlech.
Yes flee over the River Styx
and join the dead with joy.
An ocean of Blasphemy Heathenish realm
and Do What Thou Wilt as decoy.
My Prophecy is true...
We'll all make it through.
Guitar solo <start> All these ideas keep swimming
Running through your
All these ideas keep swimming
Running through your
All these ideas keep swimming
Running through your head
Quick we'll drown them with this fix
The dose to stop your shaking
The one to silence your voice
The dose to stop your shaking
The one to silence your voice
Just take it and you'll be fine
Calm relaxed obedient
Just the way we want you
Just the way we want you
Just the way we want you
Just the way we want you
Your thoughts ours to manipulate
Your actions ours to control
Your opinions are a thing of the past
Your opinions are a thing of the past
So tilt your head back and swallow this

The head between my shoulders
wounded and bleeding badly
I can smell your remorse
Stains all over
Been outside and seen it all
You are the master you know it all
Made yourself a number
And your time is now
Holding tight wish you were nearer
Lost my voice don't want to scream no more
It's like a box and I'm trapped inside
I've been paralyzed
This narrow road ends to a ditch
Been outside and seen it all
You are the master you know it all
Made yourself a number
And your time is now <start> For lost hope and his son I'll avenge what once was for his name and his love
These cold hands spill their blood
Grant me the strength to stand up straight
To make them pay
Spill their blood
Grant me the strength to bear this weight
Show me the way
Spill their blood <start> Forgive me Father I have sinned
Darkness put her painted claws in me again
Her vision drowns like service wine
Whispered kisses so divine
I was blessed but now I've come undone
Storm clouds roll out overhead
Above their master
End of all flesh end of all days
Love predicts disaster
In her precious ways
I was burned a sacerdotal soul
By the Demon Queen of my dreams
Infatuation turned to total control
Her rose was sweet
But her thorns were barbarous
Love me
And worship me
I'll lavish you and ravish you
Fulfill all wishes and fetishes too
Many never want to see
Many never want to know
The truth behind their fantasies
Their deepest needs
Let alone be shown them
Forgive me Father I have sinned
Darkness put her painted claws in me again
Her vision drowns like service wine
Whispered kisses so divine
I was blessed but now I've come undone
Nothing left to do but run
Sodom rolls out modern death
On casters ever faster
End of all Flesh End of all Days
The stars predict disaster
In her bastard ways
Love me
And worship me
I'll nurture you and hurt you too
Fulfill all wishes for my sad Aladdin
She comes to me
Like a sandstorm in an hourglass
A whirlwind of desire
I am hypnotized
To think beyond the pale
Beyond heartstopping eyes
And sopping thighs
I'm won't to fail
A wicked spell cast over me
Addicted to her utterly
Despite the horrors that gestate
Beneath the beautiful
I'll grant you life beyond your ken
The envy of all other men
Whatever vice will make you spend
Eternity with me
Satan's concubine
She makes her crime scenes shine from heaven
Forgive me Father I have sinned
Darkness put her painted claws in me again
Her vision drowns like service wine
Whispered kisses so divine
I was blessed but now I've come undone <start> So now we talk about destruction
A human race that's left to die
Nobody ever will believe it
Until we face it eye to eye
Let's talk about hell
Our future shines in darkest colours
You'll never change it never will
Ain't nothing left now to believe in
And so we face the overkill
Hey mother mercy leave me be
Do you expect me now to cry
Time will wait for no one
Time is short as hell
Time  Time Time is short as hell
All is lost into the underworld we fade
until our life is gone
count the cost
then from the darkness wiped away
into the underworld we fade
where darkness awaits
Time will wait for no one
Time is short as hell hell hell
Time ... <start> Some say a storm is coming
Some say the end is near
Some think it's all so hazy
I think it's all so clear.
If it all ends tomorrow
If it all disappears
Where do you think you're going
Anywhere else but here
I don't claim to have the reasons
All I know is if the world stops spinning tomorrow
I'd never shed a tear
I'd rather be anywhere anywhere
Anywhere but here
Some say they have the answers
Some say they know the truth
Some people live in question
Some people have no clue.
If there was no tomorrow
If there was just today
Would you make different choices
Or would you stay the same
I don't claim to have the reasons
All I know is if the world stops spinning tomorrow
I'd never shed a tear
I'd rather be anywhere anywhere
Anywhere but here
If there was no tomorrow
If there was no tomorrow
If there was no tomorrow
Would you stay the same
If there's no tomorrow
If there's no tomorrow
If there's no tomorrow
Would you stay the same
If the world stops spinning tomorrow
I'd never shed a tear
I'd rather be anywhere anywhere
Anywhere but here
If the world stops spinning tomorrow
I'd never shed a tear
I'd rather be anywhere anywhere
Anywhere but here <start> She's like the young white rabbit with bloodshot eyes
Dreaming of another place inside it's mind
Well it's a lonely place that houses the suffering and feeds the pain
So what would you do for fifteen minutes of fame
Out on your own
Some friends are out to get you
Some out to do you harm
They'll tie you off and shoot you full of sin
They'll tie you off and shoot you full of sin
They'll tie you off and shoot you full of sin
She's been chasing dragons for endless nights
So afraid to live and yet afraid to die
Well it's a lonely place that houses the suffering and feeds the pain
So what would you do for fifteen minutes of fame
Out on your own
Some friends are out to get you
Some out to do you harm
They'll tie you off and shoot you full of sin
They'll tie you off and shoot you full of sin
Another night
Just another night
Some friends are out to get you
Some out to do you harm
They'll tie you off and shoot you full of sin
They'll tie you off and shoot you full of sin <start> What is this world what is this we've created
In the burdens of this life I cannot rest
This world means nothing
Everything we hold will pass away
With a void of completion comfort will ever fade
I long for this wind to cease
We once held undying devotion
Now dead to our thoughts undefined like our love <start> The runes are singing the truth aloud their riddle is now clear
I'm just a pawn in the hands of a fate finally revealed
I stare deep inside my soul to find the reasons why
But for all these years I always knew that
I was born to fight
All I've loved I've lost
Left with no one to share the bitter cost
King of a race that ruled the world
Doomed to suffer and bring the final war
Stormbringer Ruler
Lord Elric Dragon Lord Prince of the Dreaming City
Stormbringer his runesword forged in burning hellfire
Albino dictator last king of the Dragon Isle
Commander of dragons I reigned with pride
'til I saw my Fate
In visions that haunt me at night
Dreams of a time soon to come
I bear the Stealer of Souls
Chorus
I'm the Bearer of the Black Sword Lord Elric
I'm the Bearer of the Black Sword Lord Elric
I'm the Bearer of the Black Sword Lord Elric
I'm the Bearer of the Black Sword
 Stormbringer ruler  Lord Elric
Riding all over the world in search for the signs
With fear they call me the White Wolf with crimson eyes
A sword that will shine with my bone white face
in the moonlight
Bounded by hellforged chains I am one with the sword
Mighty Stormbringer
Give me your power
Give me strength
As you take more souls
The runes are now silent I know what must be done
To sound the Horn of Fate and let a new age rise
I must keep on fighting to keep the Cosmic Balance
For Chaos for Law but in my dreams
I just want to be free
Free of all cosmic designs
Free of all sorrow and fears
Free of the Stealer of Souls but
Chorus
I'm the Bearer of the Black Sword Lord Elric
I'm the Bearer of the Black Sword Lord Elric
I'm the Bearer of the Black Sword Lord Elric
I'm the Bearer of the Black Sword
 Stormbringer ruler  Lord Elric <start> Try to run try to hide
If you don't you'll surely die
Screaming in terror there you'll lie
In Cirith Ungol Tower of Fire
Gorgons are shrieking their bestial cries
Their piercing cry burns you inside
Screaming in anguish there you'll lie
In Cirith Ungol Tower of Fire
Demons circle the smoky skies
Your fate hangs before you on a wheel of fire
As you stand revealed to Satan's eye
In Cirith Ungol Tower of Fire <start> This is the archetype that preexists the man
Evil is an inner voice that transcends the life's principle
It is shameful and sharp but secretly desired
Don't resist the charm of evil let fire burn bright
obscure and contradictory form of bliss and lust
It lives in our heart but awfully beyond us.
Death is certain but its time is a mystery forever unknown
Every drop of my tears is eternal death is eternal
it's the evidence of everything's end and corruption
Suffering is pain don't mistake it for ache
Ache is consciousness everlasting expiation.
You can't defend yourself from the void nothing
Lunacy is a false cure to mask emptiness
Existence is tragic 'cause we begin to see
the dawn only when darkness falls
We have been called to live in the name of archaic myths
To refuse them is like to fly with no fear to sink
Into the eternal and primordial sleep
To sink into the earth's secret heart
We have been given a mask to lay upon our face
to throw off it is like to feast with no fear to drink
at the sacred source to eat forbidden fruits
to learn the mysteries
Of fire of water of human souls of our destiny
The throb is dying out in a vibrating echo
Cosmic memories protect us from the chaos
Choices cannot be erased neither by mind. <start> The astral bodies
Assembled as one
At the call of irrevocable fate
The celestial gathering
Once more sent forth
In a brilliant volley of flame
Forging new paths
Along the worn landscape of eternity
Millions of years are but seconds
In the continuum of forever
Fallen leaves crumble into dust
Fade into the mausoleum
Of memories forgotten
We have grasped at the cosmic puzzle laid before us
Impatient newborns surrounded by dignified giants
The scope of our tears
Would transform valleys into oceans
A feeble attempt to clutch the fragment
That lies forever beyond
Each event shares with its sisters
As all seasons overlap
Spatial boundaries superimposed
In the unfathomable and infinite
Expanse of time
Eons of stone dissolve as we wither
Leaving no trace of existence
Cracks on the faded canvas of history
That languishes alone
A divine ceremony commencing all
Walks upon the frayed path of destruction
And the annihilation watches enviously
Awaiting its turn once more
The weight of centuries
Impedes our steps
Towards the precipice of eternity
As we succumb to unchanging forces of attraction
Our attempts to manipulate the tempest prove unsound
Yet we trudge onward
Rolling our ponderous cargo before us
Until time and space caress each other once more
A new chapter forever unfolds
Before the vacant theater of the stars...
Luminous vapor shining haze
Invisible yet everpresent
Slowly slips into the past
Along the continuum of forever <start> Casualties the world turns evil when you lose
Blind my eyes are filled with blood
Execute this world of myths we've built
Strangled it hacked it to pieces fucking pieces
Destroyed eaten alive by my own fears
Drained all my views of life erased
Wounds that will never heal
Tortured i'm chained inside the crypt
Burning the future an ocean of fire
A world all soaked in blood <start> The Ballad Of Jesse James
I dreamt I was in heaven
among the angel's gold
feeded by a pleasant hand
that dealt the playing cards
no sorts of bones whatever
creeping on the ground
'cause bonds of faith may always sever
but my gun is still around
now I just found a game
like a mortal upper story
play the final showdown scene
'til you are gone to glory
both friends and foes agree
accused of breaking laws
there is no money in this secret box
the fodder to my purse
maybe I am wrong
maybe I am right
maybe I'm not strong enough
maybe I will die
like a tawny snake
in a torrid clime
the twilight
'til the dawn of time
maybe I disclaim my honour
maybe I will jumping down the running train 
jumping down the running train
 jumping down the running train
the ballade of Jesse James
there was a little lady
she was twined in golden hair
don't want to take her to my heart
'cause dollars doesn't smell
she felt down on her knees
I cant forget the sound
'cause bonds of faith may always sever
but my gun is still around
from the deepground of the ocean
to the top of mountains high
where love threw up the sponge
fear got the upper hand
an insidious bullet from behind
the coffin let me learn
there's no money in this secret box
just fodder to the worms
maybe... <start> Sunlight ... is fading ... the season ... of blood will now begin
Burning coffins eyes of fire the dark lords wander through the night
eternal damnation thirst for blood and now they will embrace the dead
essential liquid for immortality but the condition is to kill
the whole existance remains in darkness never see the light of day
There I see you nameless one a woman raped by evil
Come to my Kingdom victim of lust and now welcome the darkside
I cry in pain of my desire but now you're here to heal me
I'll drink your blood and I relief you then you will love the darkness
Ref.
Sunlight is fading the season will begin
Black Moon is rising to survive is no sin
Sunlight is fading the season will begin
Black Moon is rising to survive is no Sin
Hidden lusts will break the gates to light
the night secrets my desire for blood
Burning coffins eyes of fire the dark lords wander through the night
eternal damnation thirst for blood and now they will embrace the dead
essential liquid for immortality but the condition is to kill
the whole existance remains in darkness never see the light of day
Ref.
Sunlight is fading the season will begin
Black Moon is rising to survive is no sin
Sunlight is fading the season will begin
Black Moon is rising to survive is no sin <start> Society I beg of thee
Open your hateful arms to me
For now I am just like you
You see my balls rattle in a jar
'neath smiling mask remains a past
As I recant couldn't help but laugh
Was that really me who had sipped from the glass wrought of all pedophilic sin
Merely the calm thrust between the two most violent storms man's seen or a libido guillotined forevermore
They dangle bait right in my face
That once did make my heart so race
But hormonally my desire replaced to quell all but the faintest roar
Merrily o mother let them play
The boogeyman he has gone away
The slender one who would make his prey from the good little girls and boys
Come tempt the fates I do implore
For I am not He anymore
Subject to all parental scorn
Demon exiled
Threat level number three
A badge to my reign of depravity
If it's only my death that can set us all free then what is it we're waiting for
My crimes of sick lust they've secured me a space
In a man's most befeared and respected of place
In the home of the horned and His torturing flames
I deserve all of this and more
Thwarting the raping beast
That deep inside me sleeps
In a hope that this history will never repeat
My dick my gun now obsolete
Are we all here just grasping at straws
Is the Devil's will absolute is it stronger than laws
Can I walk freely down darkened streets that I've stalked
Is there truly a hope left for me
Down her leg blood trickled
I remember her every breath
Chemically castrated
Normality is mandated for now
Leaden the weight of this arms they could not bear
Gonadal atrophy a product of their care
Reclusive enemy inside me he dwells
Guilt swells abysmally unequaled my hells
Society I truly beg of thee
I should remain behind silver lock and key
Feeling the rip of young tissues 'round my meat
Now a fading dream to this pitchblackened sheep
Threat level number three
A badge to my reign of depravity
If it's only my death that can set us all free then what is it we're waiting for
My crimes of sick lust they've secured me a space
In a man's most befeared and respected of place
In the home of the horned and his torturing flames
I deserve all of this and more
Thwarting the raping beast
That deep inside me sleeps
In a hope that this history will never repeat
My dick my gun now obsolete
Are we all here just grasping at straws
The Devil's will absolute is it stronger than laws
Can I walk freely down darkened streets that I've stalked
Is there truly a hope that is left for poor pathetic fucking me <start> Riffs Nerberg Swano
Lyrics Swano

Gazing at the sky colred with a gelam yet unseen.
Birds no longer fly.
It's not a dream this blinding beam.

Panic someone realized.
Everything is iced the manic depression of the centuries.
The world is soon devastated
With ease.

The temperature decreases.
Watch the frozen sean as my pulse go down.
The king has lost its crown.

Cold sun will never shine

Freezing clouds ready to fall.
Killing us all.
Time after time I hear prophets that yell
We've got life for sale.
Children  mentally deformed.
Remember the sun and how it warmed.
A natural system is wasted.
Earth saw no grace dead.

Everything is captured in capsules of ice.
Still I wonder will they all awake in paradise
Eyes of ice cannot see frozen souls unable too flee.

The maze of my existence there's no resistance.
Finally I leave this shell rotting soul I can feel the smell...
Of hell. Terminal end. Myfinal peace I descend.
Everything is left to infest but even the maggots will rest.
Cold sun.
To be continued <start> Climbing walls of an endless circle
Walking paths you never heard of
Struggling in an endless battle
Searching for a higher purpose
Drowning in betrayals river
The freezing cold will make you shiver
Join the world of greater learning
Crown me king and be my servants
Mislead by beauty
One you rarely find
So loving and friendly
It's one of a kind
Their arms wide open
Willing to take me in
No doubts in choosing
A world free from sin
All the dreams I had
All my future wishes
Put aside for a greater journey
All the things I planned
Left my friends so coldly
Put aside for a
Higher. <start> A coarse exhalation of lungs that pray for pity
My two fingers punching the keys diligently
Trembling ground pushes my glass off the table
Spilling the blood of the son of your idol
If it were not for this
Extensive bug collection
I would know not what I've found
This world would still be flat
Mary would be a virgin
And I would still be sleeping sound
If every word is a dead symbol
Empowered by the carriers expression
I'll bury my instrument citing this incident
I'm a flickering bulb that keeps blaming the filament
The most honest telling of this boyish fable
Is that on level ground I'm never feeling stable
I've got to try to outlast this candle
Or trust department to fight the inferno
If it were not for this
Extensive book collection
I would know not what I've found
This world would still be flat
Mary would be a virgin
And I would still be sleeping sound
It's an endless quest to maintain
When no one is ever right
And out on the fertile plains
We bathe in fractured rays of
Sun sunlight sun sunlight light
If it were not for this
Extensive book collection
I would know not what I've found
This world would still be flat
Mary would be a virgin
And I would still be sleeping sound <start> Leading quiet lives of desperation we maniacally cling to the unreal.
Life pursues its stranglehold upon us its pain revealed.
We as a race are frail and weak crises leave us paralyzed.
We strain to deal with what's thrown at us we're therefore traumatized.
Really I speak for no one but me
And I am losing my grasp.
On that which I must call myself
This burden might be my last.
Stranded and sinking into remorse
The darkest recesses of my mind.
The cavernous tyranny of pain and fear
Is lunacy far behind
I have dealt eternally with anguish
I have learned to live with my distress.
From all this trauma comes profound catharsis
And a way to cope with my life's bitterness.
Loneliness draped around my neck in its sinister seduction.
I pray a light will come from this my frightened introspection.
A lifetime of misery and its brethen has depleted my reserves.
And this has brought me the true conclusion nothing is what I deserve.
My early involvement in sordid acts
Has left me scarred for life.
The road I have taken selfdoubt intact
Denigration is my wife.
Am I a slave to the powers that be
Have I any inner strength
Fleeting struggles of humanity
I pontificate at length.
I have dealt eternally with anguish
I have learned to live with my distress.
From all this trauma comes profound catharsis
And a way to cope with my life's bitterness.
As an outcast I've become innerdependent trapped in a world of lies.
But now I must question my own selfworth that leaves me demoralized.
Possessing fate of mental demons
Surrounds my soul in these masses of pain.
Voices damning all of my thoughts
Selfinfliction capacities retained.
I'm not the only one in this world
Who's suffered through emotional discord.
Intensitiescaustic and penetrating
Is it me I've spent all my life hating
Thinking distorted emotions clouded
By my personal asceticsm.
In condemnation I've been enshrouded
Acetylene baptism.
I have dealt eternally with anguish
I have learned to live with my distress.
From all this trauma comes profound catharsis
And a way to cope with my life's bitterness.
I've expunged a multitude of but sad to say
Not all my doubts and fears.
But I look forward with trepidation
And step with caution into my remaining years.
I am quite sure that in these words
There's not much hope that things will ever change.
Maybe my time for suffering's past
And I can vaguely hope for brighter days.
I have dealt eternally with anguish
I have learned to live with life's distress.
From all this trauma came profound catharsis
And a way to cope with my life's bitterness. <start> Dusk has come to pass
The irreversible darkness surrounds us
Scared away from the light
No mercy will be shown
Your blood will flow
Weakminded you deserve to die
Filled with the purest of hate
My axe rips the air
Deformed beyond recognition
The unpurest of all
Not even worthy of the ignorance
The ignorance of your slayer
Kneel on command
 you you couldn't believe
Couldn't believe it was for real
Until you realize that it is you
The selfdeceiver
There is nothing all must end
For the selfdeceivers
Repeat verse 
repeat
It is you who are crawling
Crawling in a world of shit
And still you enjoy it
But even when there's nothing
Lets to crawl for you're still stuck
In your pile of fucking shit
The blade will fall
To end it all <start> Fractured chess game knights move
Chaos no point to prove
I've been changing my open mind
Self defensive intentions you'll never find
Deviation detour your moral code
You Understand I refuse to play the role
Say have a seat I think I'll stand
Stained glass here I come with brick in hand
No explanations for my deviation
I'll give no explanation for my deviation
See me are you surprised
I symbolize all you despise
Never never your faithful pawn
You run your rat race it's that I spit upon <start> Castle of ice a majestic sight. Falcons eagles and mighty ravens
circling above guarding this enchanting sight built out of dreams and wishes
dreams and wishes from people of the mighty land
Sorcerers finishing this bold creation see what they make
gigantic demons of hate a threat to unworthy worms
The wise men's chants call the wolves out of deep winter forests
winter owls arriving and two mighty goats appear
to the gate they go to defend the castle of ice <start> Where faith has failed
Men's mind has travelled
Throughout of space
His wings might fly
No borders for human's
restless desires
Since science killed faith
God even may die
Our dying pride kneeling
In front of the unknown
Where faith has failed
Gott Ist Tot
Where science prevailed
Gott Ist Tot
In front of the immensity
And grace of a universe
With well hidden secrets
That no one has known
With secrets protecting a cosmic curse
When truth seems a lie
And reality a vision
Where faith has failed
Gott Ist Tot
Where science prevailed
Gott Ist Tot
Where faith has failed
Gott Ist Tot
The lights and the colours of planets and stars
Cannot be revealed with simple human's mind
We might step foot on the ground of Mars
But order in chaos we never provide
We might step foot on the ground of Mars
But order in chaos we never provide
Where faith has failed
Gott Ist Tot
Where science prevailed
Gott Ist Tot
Where faith has failed
Gott Ist Tot
Where science prevailed
Gott Ist Tot  God is dead
Where faith has failed
Gott Ist Tot  God is dood
Where science prevailed
Gott Ist Tot  God is dead
Gott Ist Tot <start> Music M. Petrozza
Lyrics M. Petrozza <start> Your mind's an engine
That drives a wheel
A wheel that burns in the flesh
Like flesh on hot steel
I wanna make you suffer
I wanna make you feel
I wanna make you feel so bad
You'd even kill yourself to heal
Yeah no more
Yeah no more
Now things have changed
Nothing remains the same
Once you were the proud the gift the son
Of your father's game
I wanna make you listen
To the words I found
To hold your throat and see
You scream without a sound
Yeah no more
Yeah no more
Your hands are shakin'
I'll make you dance
Further on now
Kiss the devil's romance
Hate me love me
I hate you love you
I'll use my hands and transform you
Into pieces into pieces I will tear I will tear you
Never had the will
To bring you down
But now that I'm strong as you
I'd like to beat you to the ground
I'm feeling better
I wish that you could see
How I'm doing the same old things
You did you did to me <start> Sin sinful as a sinner I am
Conceived by a jackal
Cunning as a serpent
I'm hiding inside your conscience's parasite
I am the controller
The autocrat of the soul
After me no turning back
Gaining full soul control
Sin
As a
Sinner I am
Conceived by a jackal
Cunning as a serpent
I'm hiding
Inside
Need needle as I am your neediness
Conquering flesh and bones
I'll be
Taking
Over 'till breathing finites
For I am you
I am the controller
The
Autocrat
Of the soul
After me no turning back
Gaining full soul control
Searching
For thy partner in distress
My endless journey continues
The end is
Ending
As there is
Nothing more to take
No more than a shadow now
A splinter
Of
What you used to be
I am the controller
The autocrat of the soul
After
Me
No turning back
Gaining full soul control
Need needle as I am your
Neediness
Conquering flesh and bones
I'll be taking over 'till breathing finites
For I am you <start> lost in the halls of dream
bound by the chains of a scream
here we stand alone
never allowed to know
what's behind the wall of sleep
imprisoned in a web of night
in search of an emerald sky
the astral body flies I stand alone
through the dust of ages forlorn
chased by the wind and the storm
enslaved by the orchids sweet scent
a tear from the dead mans eye
wings of fallen angel burn
where's the gold at the rainbows end
it is there but oh so far away
flames of fire burns so deep
as we fall out of the orchid's sleep
an emerald sky before our eyes
disapearing in the morning sun
is it for real or is it the dream
imprisoned in a web of night
in search of an emerald sky
the astral body flies I stand alone
through the dust of ages... forlorn
chased by the wind and the storm
enslavved by the orchids sweet scent
a tear from the dead mans eye
where is the gold at the rainbows end
it is there but oh so far away <start> Look at you fastened by sheltering blanket.
Did you think I'd forget how sweet you taste
nay my umbrageous heart still yearns for you
and still to peruse your love is such a waste.
You lie there a vision of immaculate purity
yet your eyes reveal the insatiable whore
and now I'll love sucking your vitality
with you my pretty. I just want more.
First I'll tear asunder thy mortal garments
unmasking your pale delicate flesh
then I shall ravage your lovebroken body.
Sinking my teeth upon your tender breast.
Violently I'll fuck your pernicious cunt
while consuming the precious lifeforce
thoroughly enjoying the sweet flavor.
I'll vampirize you Natasha with no remorse. <start> Bobby said Fuck spendin'  on a whip buy a clip
Mental flip got a thousand tracks thought on a chip
Said he had mad toys to make noise
You split and separate drums like asteroids
The concerned producer sampled this question
Hit him with the beat for the answer with extra compression
When sound travel it quickly grab you
And equalizes the pitch up until it have you
Bugged out tryin' to think you can match this
The portrait's too graphic
Panoramic view for you stamp Wu
The feature Gothic the outcome will be catastrophic
We wrote blocktic checkpoints on your next joint
And who the nigga you anoint
 volts on the track to slay
Murderous wordplay displayed for killin' cascades
Throwin' bullets in the air to test wind
And which way the cyclone spins
Counter on clockwise still civilized
Kill spies on the wall that still flies all dies
Give no extension on the lynchin'
It's tension if the name of the Clan is mentioned
It's the aura that's felt that causes one to flash his gun
And reveal how he really feel confirmed
He'll never live after the show see the promoted for the dough
I'm takin' breakin' his wax
Throw my shit on to perform my selection from the Swarm
Day  breaks it's a stormy Monday
My ninjas lay in ravines and ditches
Underneath shrubs and leaves
They breathed through underwater reeds
The enemy walks above
Clan remain subterranean mud
Off shore banks tanks approach the location
Bombarded by the circle of death formation
Telecom lines are sniped from these low altitude strikes
Shatterin' bulletproof helmets with scrap nail fragments of cell
Inhale these venomous thoughts that I propel
Through the north facility the city must suffer at the hand
Of the Chief's command volts is in
At  minute intervals the heat intenses
Deadenin' the power from electrical fences
Defenses are down shake a nigga up
Bounce him off the sound
You know what I'm sayin'
The God cadiver in the streets of Iris
We talk about sex money and drugs
Ruled by power
And y'all cats don't know
What it's about

It goes deeper than what you see on TV
Killah Priest come on
Burnin' desire ebony eyes
Painted toe nails legacys die
Drivin' by the well Egyptian queens Arabian shieks
Are paid to knock off rich kings for the joy some sing
Graveyards filled with scarlet widows
Who stabbed they husbands
Sleepin' on silk pillows blood on they robes
Disguised as beggar in cheap wool clothes
Lambs and wolfs in black hoods pull out they gats
Like magic wands castin' spells sendin' niggaz to Hell
Trappin' they souls in realms baptize 'em with holy water
Springin' on the heads of plenty witches' daughters
Interviews with the richest reporters
Silent nights over the dividers a  Muslim bibles
For the cobbler Hebrews flee to the hills of Masada
For the love of God guns make a loud sound
I'ma show you how thugs get down
Shoot outs bullets turn into bloodhounds and hunt you down
Cursed nation lost generation
XFiles describe them in the future as cosmic rulers
Fallen angels from space intruders
Dyin' saints blood spilled on the floor like wet paint
See it in the pictures read it like the lost scriptures
Dissolve it with your  proof liquor
Ha I shot the sheriff and the deputy secondly
Threatenin' the lives of those who threaten me
Lessenin' my chances of defeat by predeterminin' the victory
As taught by Sun Tzu in the chapter
After the third one I heard my words shall be bombed
Regardless to anything or anyone
I die by the gun my life has just begun
Thought I was livin' all along but I was wrong
This long road I have to travel in countless battles
These filthy snakes with poison fangs and rattles
Kings queens and pharaohs change to cattle
I'm able to subtract the devil's arrow
Singin' at his eyes on the sparrow mind narrow
 positions horoscopes and tarots
Hark harolds angels and Christmas carols
Raven images hang from the mantels
Man made slaves and modern day babbles
Raw from Africa and golden ropes and sandles
By wicked thieves and vandals
Aho manhandled us with leather whips and burnin' candles
And rambled through our castle leavin' niggaz shambles
Stole our golden sodas like some Arab camels
We gazed amazed and baffled as he loaded his ammo
With to the barrel and blasted out our bone marrow
We went to Gretal and the Hansel
Tricked by this wicked jackel
Children of my grand old daddy have me
In mind were they lost in this wilderness blind <start> there were words of lust
in these arms of the stranger
and there in silence though were words of no milder
so in thinking of that madness
that ravage the thoughts
in the loneliest of hours
I resist without control
the demand I get from excellence
the void I felt from answering
not only an addition
it generated need
in these endless nights of freezing
my weight on the other side
I resist without control
feel the thorns of uncontrol
claws that set in sleeps december
let loose on the verge
talked to me as strangers once did
the tone was set for winter
sweet uncontrol
beyond proportion
into the night
so strike me deeper
I resist without control
feel the thorns of uncontrol
the death that craved no life
now ended
in return
drifting uncontrolably
within the night <start> Riding and riding we search across the land
The snow and wind has frozen hearts of man
But we ride
We ride
Many days ago we left our homes
With swords to ride into the night
Fighting side by side to destroy our foes
And leave them without life
We stop consider the land that we travelled
Our map's at home direction unravelled
But we ride
We ride
Many days ago we left our homes
With swords to ride into the night
Fighting side by side to destroy our foes
And leave them without life
So much time has passed since we left our land
That we've become concerned
And we'll never find the battle
That we should have fought and won
But we won't stop searching
Lost but still we ride
Search until we die
We ride
We ride
Hungry and tired the frigid plain yeilds little
We trudge on further eating pride and snow that's brittle
We ride
We ride
We come upon a witch who takes us in
To let us share her mighty fire
She asks of us our story and we lie and say
We ride around for hire
She asks us if we'd like to have her map
And points us in some direction
But we are far too proud and strong so we keep silent
And ignore her suggestion
Lost but still we ride
Search until we die
All the fault of pride
The gods weep in the night
Lost but still we ride
Search until we die
All the fault of pride
The gods weep in the night
We ride
We ride <start> At Hilly's show
they didn't know
that the Ending of Being is near
I can feel their voices
the old man cries
Please save the boy
he's caught in a world far behind
from home
Monster Anne is crying out
Feel my pain I can't escape
Bad chances for me

Is there time
Can you see it
Is there life
Fly away and dream <start> Just come inside and see
It's not just fantasy
It's where you want to be
I lead you through the maze
I give you liberty
I make you feel so free
I'll be your master  You're my slave
I'm like the wind that spreads the fire
A smell of evil in the air
Fire's burning everywhere
You lock me in
So that I'm under your control
You take possession of my soul
I won't give in
Though I have no place left to go
I'm gonna fight you 'till the end
Don't try to run away
I'll make you paralyzed
You know it's no way out
It's time to realize
You need me to survive
You know your soul is mine
I'll be your master  You're my slave
I'm like the wind that spreads the fire
A smell of evil in the air
Fire's burning everywhere
You lock me in
So that I'm under your control
You take possession of my soul

Though I have no place left to go
I'm gonna fight you 'till the end
I'll be your master  You're my slave

A smell of evil in the air
Fire's burning everywhere
You lock me in

You take possession of my soul
I won't give in
Though I have no place left to go
I'm gonna fight you 'till the end <start> Eurovision  Party For Everybody
Eurovision  Party For Everybody
Eurovision  Party For Everybody <start> Eyes cold as ice
Staring into vacancy
Chasing shadow from within
Chase the cool winds
Harassed with remorse
Now that all is said and done
I know that I can't face the old routine
Longing back
To your whelming dark
In spite of my fear
I call your name once again
Blind by the light of day
Save me from solitude
Thoughts come to mind
As the years pass in review
As the soothing rain divides
My emotions
I tremble with awe
The power to destruct
Breathing the conviction that love survives
Through the dark
Through the years
In spite of my fear
I call your name once again
Blind by the light of day
Save me from solitude
Roll the fire I read you now
Roll the fire I feel you now
Roll the fire I know you now
Roll the fire don't leave me now <start> Brave is my courage
High is my sword
Hurry into the open
Rush out the door
Bloodied by the shore
Blind is my fury
fearless in my mind
whispers of the angels
are speaking of a fight
Streaming lights of white
beaming whites of light
Watching as my body
stay where I lay
floating ever higher
I have never prayed
secrets move my way
Now I am all knowing
we are all the same
pieces of each other
fitting into our game
spirits dance and play
dissipate to gray
Soon I will forget all
These visions all I can take
to a new tour of duty
maybe violence I will break
bloodied by the shore <start> Get me done
Clear your arm for another shoot
Inject me
Feel the tension that chills your bones
your step belongs to me
So don't face me  so don't face me
So don't confront me  Don't confront me
So don't face me  so don't face me
So don't confront me  try to do me now
I am the one who makes your stands
I am the nightmare they tried to hide
So keep me close to your heart
You never thought it could hurt so bad
repeat chorus <start> Y auratil un nouveau temps
Pour les mes non humaines

Qui crient pardel les vents
Regrettent les passions mortelles

The age of distrust and hypocrisy that tries
Unemployed living in poverty to divide us
It makes me sick to witness
It's kill or be killed in the street danger
Obscene and rank with defeat murder
Hold true to what you believe of the savior
Beloved Jesus of Christ
We're gonna be extinct so let's prey
Image of death and atrocity
Unconscious unrest and anxiety
End of peace end of love and unity
Deliver us from evil
It's kill or be killed in the street danger
Obscene and rank with defeat murder
Hold true to what you believe of the savior
But the fear...
We need some revolution
We need assassination
Bring on some Armageddon
Rape it hate it love it...
We're gonna be extinct so let's prey
Here we are lost in the lost in the world
A crazy place of consequence
Lost in a wilderness of heroes of another day
We're gonna be extinct so let's prey
Let all your rivers run and take me with the flood <start> Lord below your abysmal horrors we call forth
Awaken  rise up and cleanse this earth with fire
The taste of victory awaits our wicked tongues
As you sleep beyond the light your blessed idol acts agent to your will
For vast aeons has slept lurking 'neath the haunted deep
Sea soaked perversion arise
Named of the foulest tongue his will ebbs within me
Beckoning  what was shall once more be
In the house of the dead you lie and wait
Oh lords of black earth
Controlling the minds of the meek
Staining this planet with visions of murder and hate
For vast aeons has slept lurking 'neath the haunted deep
Sea soaked perversion arise
Named of the foulest tongue his will ebbs within me
Beckoning  what was shall once more be
We pray for the earth to open
Free you of your ageless tomb
Our knees bent in your worship
Oh great gold one I scream for your return
Madness unhallowed
Ascending moon of darkness never to wane
Lurking without end
Behind life in time and space
An evil so vast
Beyond man's power to bear
An essence insane
Dethrone the sovereign  and with your might reclaim
I serve allegiance to your will
I scream the incantations
Lord unholy your horrors I invoke
Come forth my lord
In praise we sing of your return <start> Nowhere to run
Not where to go
Welcome to life damnation
Welcome to fun
Welcome to home
Here is your invitation
Welcome to the gate
To the unknown fate
Waiting for a better day
Jesters dance around
Slowly growing old
Having party while they stay
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to go
Welcome to life damnation
Welcome to fun
Welcome to hope
Here is your invitation <start> love me love me say your gonna love me your my valitine. ohhh ohh.love me love me say your gonna love me your my valintine.ohhh ohh.

your my valintine <start> Deep Green Dark Chaos
Blinded I run down these paths
By heart I know them
They lead to the searing cliffs
Stout they stand above the waters edge
Lifeless
And this is my foundation
Cold stone
Formed only by winds and time
How invulnerable
Lifeless
Ahh...
I have longed to be at one with this
Yet the waters call my name
For once I wish to see
The entity behind the voice
The face of this seduction
The beauty of my pain
Am I blessed or am I cursed by the presence...
What is my crime...
What is my deed...
Is this life my redemption
Shall I repent or proceed
I hate my flesh
It's dimension poisoned my soul with doubt
It made me question the essence of...
The I
Slaves are those of this world
Given freedom to lay chains upon The Master
The wolf is no longer free
Release the chains and come for me
The Elder
Suddenly his mournful cries were stunned. Out of the cold mist
came three entbralling ships. Sails torn by many storm and the
bows adorned by the most fierce gargoyles he'd ever laid eyes upon.
Yet the crew they bore... Three times twelve in numbers. They stood
motionless wrapped in grey worn gowns. And from behind their
shadowed faces the seductive chanting. Bidding him on board.
Without hesitation he accepted. And away they sailed... 
Upon these seas
Wherein I drowned so many times
I scatter the ashes of dignity
Still my flames are in hunger
With fire in my heart
Shall I greet the shores ahead
Though I know not what will burn
Desire...
Ahh...
In the distance
I hear the waves wash over solid ground
And in this momnet I am struck blind
Grant me sight so I can see
That which lies ahead of me
Cursed be my mortal eyes
For dying in the realm of death
Hear my call...
I return to the soaring cliffs
They trylu shine of strenght
even though I nothing learned
With strenght I burn... <start> I can't take this
Forever I've wanted to be a lot more than just a person
Not to play on the side of the humans
We're forced to live and die in this system
I can't see the logic that we are taught
Pleasure is attained through freedom
Pain is the answer
Try to escape from the body
Welcome to the paradox
Can not take this
I thought that pain was my savior
Living a lie from what I'm thinking
I'm chasing my life which must end right here
How can I free myself from this world that I'm forced to live in
We'll see at the end that this idea freedom
that you hold to yourself can never
Retrieve all the things that were meant to be
if they're causing us pleasure
I want to be the pain causing the change to our race
When it hurts you
I want to be the pain causing the change to our life
When it hits
I want to be what I am not the circumstance of how I was born
I can not take this I will not take this
I want to be the pain causing the change to our race
I want to be the pain causing the change to our life
I want to be what I am not the circumstance of how I was born
I can not take this I will not take this
Why should I take anymore <start> Lightning flashers in swollen skies
Thunder rumbles angels cry
Storms are coming from heavens above
The beginning of the end has just begun
You were told 
You've been warned 
You should have known 
It's now too late
She is judge and jury time to ate your fate
Polar caps melting tides on the rise
Volcanos erupting lava slides
Temperatures rising planets dying
End is coming people crying
Lightning flashers in swollen skies
Thunder rumbles angels cry
Temperatures rising planets dying
End is coming people crying <start> Instrumental <start> Chorus gza and rza

Lyrics
I was always taught my do's and don'ts
For do's I did and for don'ts I said I won't
I'm from brooklyn a place where stars are born
Streets are shot up apartment buildings are torn
And ripped up stripped up shacked up and backed up
From fiends cause the bosses on the scene they got it cracked up
Kids are slingin in my lobby
Little steve and bobby
Gettin paid but it's a lifethreatening hobby
Yeah they still play hide and seek
The fiends seek for the crack and they hide and let the cops peep
Grown folks say they should be out on their own
Before the gangs come and blow up their mom's home
Because they lifestyle is hectic so fuckin hectic
Blaow blaow blaow bullets are ejected
My lifestyle was so far from well
Coulda wrote a book with a title age  and goin through hell
Then I realized the plan
I'm trapped in a deadly video game with just one man
So I don't only watch my back I watch my front
Cause it's the niggaz who front they be pullin stunts
Back on the ave of lavonia and bristol with a pistol
Stickin up pamela and crystal
You know your town is dangerous when you see the strangest
Kid come home from doin the bid and nuthin changes
What is the meaning of crime 
Is it criminals robbin innocent motherfuckers everytime
Little shorties take walks to the schoolyard
Tryin to solve the puzzles to why is life so hard
Then as soon as they reached the playground blaow
Shots ring off and now one of them lay down
It's so hard to escape the gunfire
I wish I could rule it out like an umpire
But it's an everlasting game and it never cease to exist
Only the players change so...
Chorus x
Rza  I gotcha back 
I gotcha back so you best to watch your front
Cause it's the niggaz who front that be pullin stunts
I gotcha back but you best to watch your front
It's the niggaz who front that be pullin stunts
Outro 
old man
Your tech nique is magnificent
When cut across the neck
A sound like wailing winter winds is heard they say
I'd always hoped to cut someone like that someday
To hear that sound
But to have it happen to my own neck is... ridiculous

And I'm always worried. <start> I want you chained to a bed
Widespread and open
Like the open sea
Let me the river
To that sea
In my utter weakness
Why do we seethe
hands over my face
Maybe I try
Maybe I'd rather be
In my own waves
Like the dawning of a new day I am free
But my hands are and my feet are
Chained and bound
And it's you behind the rust that's killing me
I want you chained to a bed
Widespread and open
Like the open sea
The feathers will fall and the wings will grow tired
As the summer make way for the autumn of your life. <start> We are all meant to stand in a line
eyes forward
arms to the side
and when your turn comes bow out gracefully
I know what you've come for and your game
you'd better believe that I came to play
Double talk cross the line chatter doesn't matter
I've heard that before
and when our turn comes
we will take this day while this little angel sleeps
his head all filled with dreams
a desperate soul does scream please take me away
spirit drenched
a moment spent contemplating a sacrament
hell awaits for those who take from the one whose soul creates
his visions ride on angels wings
his words are like a summer's breeze
heaven sent and mostly bent restraint
and compassion are already spent <start> I just wrote to tell you this
I did just my very best
I went far but got stuck there
I picked up the pieces I was your vigilant soldier
but the mass of the earth just weighed too heavily on me
How can truth be opinion
How can fact be right and wrong
The familiar turned strange good and evil unhinged.
My utilitarian comfort unsettled
Consequentialist moral reasons categorically examined
Selfknowledge is a loss of innocence
I heard your call to arms
set off the doomsday alarm
but never heard back
So I set out alone
I dont believe all Ive been shown
A quest for truth and fact
I passed a desert town
Uninhabitable pastures of ash brown
Abandoned structures littered like an Aerstan scene
But then desperate people appeared
They had lived in constant drought for ten years
ever since pollution got the best of them wiped them clean
So I thought Ill take their curse away
Let them flourish Ill take the pain.
I lifted their drought and went on my way
So Im asking you help me carry
Im Atlas Jesus and Hades
Wont someone please take this weight off of me
The destination is obsolete
The journey is bittersweet
Logic and consistency do not mix with morality
Justify your atrocities the trump card never fails
Remove the greed and the ego and the consciences prevails
No longer emptyhanded
I stopped at the coast to rest
but found a flood of people drowning in a sea of hatred
They begged and pleaded End this war
Have acceptance and peace restored
So I drank up all their poison oaths
So Im asking you help me carry
Im Atlas Jesus and Hades
Wont someone please take this weight off of me
The destination is obsolete
Theres nothing left but wrong with me
Global systems all degrading
Ill take the problems so the World can breathe
And I have nowhere to take thewm so
forever theyll accompany me
The future is much longer than the past
I picked up wrongs along the way
removed them from the mass
But I still had to jettison things
to outrun gravity and not wanting to further pollute
I just left behind parts of me
Im collecting your tradition your religion your depression
Im trading in your affection to put us all to sleep
So here I lay bent shoulders broken ribs
I sink into the earth and all I can hope is to take this baggage to the grave
one more step I cannot take
by the time you read this Ill have passed away. <start> Won't you believe it
It's just my luck
It's just my luck
It's just my luck
It's just my luck
No recess
No recess

Won't you believe it
It's just my luck

On whom you can depend
Who will never sell you out
Betray you as a friend

Everybody needs a solid rock I know I do
Who'd die to set you free
Is there someone in your life
You trust and never doubt
Thta when you're cryin' out in need
He'd come to help you out
Everybody needs someone sure someone true
Everybody needs a solid rock I know I do
Who'd die to set you free

Who'd give up their all to be
A friend who'd never let you down
Who'd die to set you free
Everybody needs someone sure someone true
Everybody needs a solid rock I know I do <start> Condemned
My regret is not writing more for you lord.
As this ocean comes to be deeper our vessel becomes less stable
Look to the sky.
Encourage the elements of god
Rather than the jars that contain them.
If only the ingredients of man were of such elements.
If only.
With great horror I admit that we all live off the lust and misfortune of others.
All lives off the lust and misfortune of others
This is vision not contradiction.
I see greed in the face of a priest
And deterioration in the walls of cathedrals. <start> SIENTE LA FUERZA DE SATANS
Padre nuestro que arrastras por el suelo
Satanas sera to nombre
Vengan adorar nuestro malvado rey
Animador de voluntad negativo
En el tiempo de cristo asi como en el dia del brujo
Danos hoy poder satanico pa chingarnos este dia
why perdona los necios sin fe negra
Asi como nosotros te rezamos de rodillas
No dejen de creer en satanas
why ayudanos repartir todo maldito
English translate Our Father
Our father who crawls under the soil
Satan will be your name
Come adore our evil king
Champion of negative will
As it was in Christ's day so it is in
the day of El Brujo
Give us today to to be able to be
satanic in order to seize this day
And pardon those fools without black faith
Just as we praise you
Don't turn from believing in Satan
And help us deliver all cursed <start> Taken by force but they kept it with pride
And now we can't breathe in the world they describe
Where silence is golden resistance is numb
We scream our hope straight into the sun
Broken is the world they refuse to see
We won't bow down to a word remembered as liberty
They are preaching on now their time is yet to come
How long before we can make them undone
In the name of believing
In the name of us all
We sing to tell you the stories untold
Can you hear our mourning
They've taken our rights
Don't let the truth out of your sight
Deceiving appearance they're dressed up as gods
Fake that they care their conscience is lost
Denial their craft and riots our goal
They lead those who follow and break those who fall
A future blackened by a change of heart
They'll try to fool us that they will greet us with open arms
A promise as empty as when we were sent astray
Our blood on the pen they used to sign our lives away
In the name...
Honesty replaced by greed they gave us the reason to fight and bleed
They try to torch our faith and hope spit at our presence and detest our goals
They are preaching on how their time is yet to come
How long before we make them undone <start> We stare at broken clocks the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him I slowly lost you too
For when he died he took a part of you
No time for farewells no chances for goodbyes
No explanations no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him I slowly lost you too
For when he died he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun...
I'm ready for my sun to...
I'm ready for my sun...
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season
If only sorrow could build a staircase our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back I would get back the friend that I once knew <start> Ive never since felt life as dry as it was inside you
Ive tasted plenty and it only made me gag
I wanted more now I have it all without you
If I could have only left without that thought
I would have left with him and you a childless wreck
I would have taken it upon myself to leave you
Strapped with the burden of unclear thinking
Thats what you do best youre always thinking
And not acting rationally
You just needed someone to love you
God know I dont I never did so disappear
You gave me every reason to
And still I didnt break your face in
So wheres my son and wheres your scars
Do you still limp from my fist fucking fetish
And my midnight naked messages in your ears
So why didnt they come Why wasnt she born
I would have taken her right from underneath you
She would call you mother I would call you host
And you would just call on every lie
You could to feel just and sane keep your word
How little do I really understand
I knew enough not to touch you there
I should have saved myself for the last but still
I broke in the beginning and broke your hold in the end
And on you went barren and content
And I the other direction experienced in nothing special <start> Memories of loss
memories of fear
are the ones you shall wake
up to my darkest dear
Down into the depths
of your minds wonderland
breathing the air tasting the fruits
you are feeding from my hand
I guide you beyond yourself
your eyes are blinded by desire
come into my world...
welcome to fire
You are screaming in pain
as I am laughing in ecstasy

No matter what's in my heart
You are the One who cares
When I doubt You stand by me
So I'm not ashamed to say the way I feel
I love You You are my Everything <start> The scent of oh purest carnage familiar to these hills. My father hath traversed these lands decades before my birth. A century doth pass by the veins of the earth entrenched with the millions of dead. So few have my eyes seen in passing of glory. The aesthetics of death painted upon the canvas of so bewildering a scene. All sensations seared all of my compassions numbed. My humanity wrenched from behind my lungs. The lusts of my bayonet in crimson display have spilled upon these hands. From beneath my helmet do I glare back in sickening approval of the malice we have sewn. My mind sentiment of no reason my face caressed by this foreign wind. A pulmonary incantation writhes beneath these ribs crying in blood drunk verse and beguiling my conscious thought. The howl of descending mortar fire illuminates this blackest existence a serenity wreathed in flame. The skies were beautiful as they burned. The dead roll over in their graves. Above the mortars my ears discern my father screaming in his grave. <start> instrumental <start> Digerida muy pronto ha de ser

And that I haven't slept well
I bang my head to sleep
With a bottle of bourbonhell
I'm a character living
In a world gone wrong
Don't act so stingy about it
We're all in this song
Put on the face you use as a disguise
I can see it in your eyes
The kick you get from your own lies
I'm a man you can't kid
And a man you can't trust
I promote a lifestyle
You can't really live
Returning to madness
Lose my old skin <start> tonight ill lay here

again youre waving
you swore you could swim but what now when your feet wont touch the ground

my sweet youre drowning
the shore beds my feet and theres no chance of me getting wet
but i swear
as you scream ill laugh
you scream ironic and beg for this fever to break
or the sweet cascading waves to pull you down
hey ocean floor
look how she longs for you
take her now for ive already left her for dead

While the prints are behind your feet you run your mouth just like youre next to me
So think it through.
She mailed the post cards to my address I pictured her wearing that red dress over the Zeppelin tshirt that I somehow managed to never get back
As I struggled to open the envelope it turns out that my eyes can develop a scope
I zoomed in on the line that says Im leaving and Im not coming back.
And youre probably thinking I should be sad but.
Thank God that my hearts in the ground never once been touched just safe and sound
Thank God that youve got it all wrong know the back of my head sings the sweetest song
Thank God that you didnt love me cause honey please know that I never loved you
I know you will be back in the morning so just keep in mind that I was ready to end it to.
Ive got a bone to pick with you so light your match and let it shine through
Remember the bear that you got me for Valentines Day Well I ripped his head off
As the cotton fell to the floor I felt much better than I had been before
I felt as if a weight had been lifted off of my back as a matter of fact
And youre probably thinkin I should be scared no <start> Whispers Travelling with the wind
Like fragments of unbecoming the
Gathering of our sins.
Crying tears from the blind man.
Now you see so much better without eyes
When something dies.
He sees the unbecoming.
The one's nevermade.
The unmaking  he knows them.
This man now weeps and prays.
No. This wasn't meant to be.
In all the dreams that I have dreamt
This wasn't our destiny.
As explorer of earths
And adventurer of the stars I know that
I should've known.
Now the sorrow spectrum
Grows and the world will stay unsaved.
I know that I should've seen.
I know the unbecoming.
The worlds nevermade.
The unmaking I know them.
And now I weep and pray.
Whispers Travelling...
Now the darkday has come.
Now O know now I see that evil
Never dies it just sleeps.
It just sleeps... <start> I live my life
And I despise
Everything you told me
You see Im getting older
Beat me down
Shut your crown
Lets shut down the system
this life is just mine
I will never win this game

And I will never break these chains
I live my life
And I despise
Everything you told me
You see Im getting older
Beat me down
Shut your crown
Lets shut down the system
this life is just mine
I will never let you slide

And I don't wanna step aside

Im looking inside you
Stay away from me
Sick and twisted
Searching for a safe place
Lonley wasted
Shut the fuck up and cry
And Ill be strong to stab
No i can't kill
But i don't want it
Don't leave me
I wait and bleed
blame is my atonement
I'll die for my since
Don't leave me
I will never win this game

And I will never break these chains
I will never let you slide

And I don't wanna step aside
 <start> Lead Holm
Reborn but dead and violent
You'll enslave humanity
Rise reborn in flesh
To become the dreams of eternity
Determined to see their fall
See them bathe in flames
Advanced to a higher priest
Benumb ice floats in veins
Souls of thousand dead warriors
A cost of betrayal
Wiped out and threatened of existence
Contradictions within our beliefs
Disaster is not inevitable
Starting fires and reeking disease
Deception makes us crawl makes us bleed
Bound to collapse fall on our knees
Haunting torment of torture
You will do as I say
Intervene the commands and obey
Frantic I will intersect your soul
I'm profane a delusive design
Pleasure of slavery existent divine
Drastic measure for those that will fail
Chaos will denote my desire

Ill repute is my name
Vile torment and hatred
Bloodthirst seer tremor
Heaven or hell it shall be
Trenchant roar of laughter
Sins existence of time
Water turns to blood
Destruction of paradise
He's to blame I'm your god
Behold my kingdom as I rise
You have seen what I've become
I'm the serpent of lies
Attack in darkest of night
Creatures of the hatred
Respected of those that obey
I'm blessed with the flesh
I'm the future breed I will clone
I have become seer's hatred
Souls of thousand dead warriors
A cost of betrayal
Wiped out and threatened of existence
Contradictions within our beliefs
Disaster is not inevitable
Starting fires and reeking disease
Deception makes us crawl makes us bleed
Bound to collapse fall on our knees <start> When your soul is free to wander where would it go
Do you think it is safe with God in heaven
But what if the angels took over his power and might
They could torment it ofr milleniums to come
Oh angelface who's side are you on
It's a war the second war and the heavens shall burn
You could be the victim of Gabriels jealousy
Escaping Lucifer and his hungry hellish flames
You mortal fool with your naive heavenly devotion
Your beloved guardian angel is now tightening the skrew
It's a war the second war and the heavens shall burn

Hail the Blacksmith  times
We came from the Alliance
Beyond the hills
Where is the Blacksmith who lives here
In the end of path a dungeon exist...
But take care my friend he is a freak
Hail the blacksmith  times
Crossing Helderville we found the one
Are you the blacksmith We're looking for
Demon of steel my army is here
We need your services to save the king
Hail the blacksmith  times
I have all the weapons banished from the kingdom
My magic anvil will lead you to victory
Sword of storms and Hammer of the evil
My mortal steel will destroy your enemy
He is the Blacksmith
Power of Thunder
Made of steel
With the sword of storms you can control
Hurricanes and winds to protect the throne
With the hammer of evil
Brandishing in your hands
The ground will swallow all the trolls of these lands
Hail the blacksmith  times
Locked in his dungeons
Three days and three nights
With his hammer and anvil Forging the strike
March to the victory legion of storm The mighty steel
Will shed the blood
Hail the blacksmith  times
I have all the weapons banished from the kingdom
My magic anvil will lead you to victory
Sword of storms and Hammer of the evil
My mortal steel will destroy your enemy

Intruders live  cast in stone
Intruders die  Forgotten souls

Break down screaming killers
Danger awaits us
Beware of human sacrifice

Lyrics Rafael Bittencourt
Vai como um rei
Voa na presa
Espanta de vez
E a fome vem
Cruzando rios
Montes e cus
Vaga no ar
S outra vez
Morrendo o dia
Respira exausto
Estria sem fim
Matar ou morrer
Atrs da trilha
Olhos de guia
Fitam coelhos
Fogo de palha
No sei bem se sou
Caa ou caador
Hoje e amanh
O rio vai e eu vou atrs
A esperar resposta
Pro que vou dizer
Se o dia foi da caa
Quem ir saber
Espero que o tempo
Faame entender
Que o corpo cai na terra
E ela h de comer tudo outra vez
No sei bem quem sou
Nem pra onde vou
Hoje e amanh
O rio vai e eu
Vou atrs
A esperar que o vento
Tragame o condor
O dia foi da caa
Ou do caador
Espero que o tempo
Faame entender
Que o corpo cai na terra
E ela h de comer
Tudo outra vez
Tudo outra vez
Tudo outra vez <start> To suffer when all hope is denied
Waged down by sorrow marked by grief
To suffer when all hope is denied
Waged down by sorrow marked by grief
A home in flames fathomless night
Seek shelter from pain I wish to forget
At the edge of the world last stand has been taken
Feeding on the enemy with a clean shot
Deadly screams don't reveal your presence
It's hard to ignore the blackened debris
Silence surrounds
A broken voice
Silence surrounds
A broken voice
Unthinkable days man against man
Fighting on plains streams of pitch and soil
The final conflict between the remains of the world
Brother fights brother over poisoned water
Silence surrounds
A broken voice
Silence surrounds
A broken voice
Silence surrounds silence grows
A word so tall brother we are close
A sleep so deep stance wounded ear
Look at the shadows brother we are so close to the goal
Unthinkable days man against man
Fighting on plains streams of pitch and soil
The final conflict between the remains of the world
Brother fights brother over poisoned water
At the edge of the world man against man
Living on fear deadly screams can be heard
A home in flames a child left for it self's to care
Seeking shelter from pain wishing to forget
To forget
Then a strange light came from the north
and light went dark under heavy sky's
Then a strange light came from the north
and light went dark under heavy sky's
A strange light came from the north
and light went dark under heavy sky's
Then a strange light came from the north
and light went dark under heavy sky's
Silence surrounds
A broken voice
Silence surrounds
A broken voice
Watch over yourself brother
Watch over yourself brother
Watch over yourself brother <start> Pulling the last cry I was alive 
While I'm down in my hatred weird right 
Your god has set you on fire this day the darkness light your way
When we reach this final dusk
Bring me fire and insanity
The jetblack eyes are showing butterflies
They dance in the fire insane so
Chorus
Fire dance with me
Fire come with me
Fire your fire
Of the everlasting flame did burn me
The one we are all off often struggling down down down down
And when you hear me forth to the ever last
Hear me used to bear dreams cast in a silent near
Fire you're killing me
Fire a thorn sweet so rare
We'll praise the Lord to begin it
Until the others will fall
But victims are we all
We will at last destroy human gods
And within us the fire is burning
The dream lives forth we're standing strong to fight
And the everlasting fire is burning
Chorus <start> Searching for answers still unfound
Words and lies keep going round
Will I find the golden way
Feeling lied feeling betrayed
The times I've tried the times I've cried
For the ones who've always lied
The times I've tried the times I've cried
For the ones who've always lied
When I look up to the skies
Is there someone out there
When it's time to say goodbye
Where do we go when we die
Only knowing what you fear
Always fearing what you know
If you speak the thoughts you hide
You're an outcast being denied
The times I've tried the times I've cried
For the ones who've always lied
The times I've tried the times I've cried
For the ones who've always lied
When I look up to the skies
Is there someone out there
When it's time to say goodbye
Where do we go when we die
The times I've tried the times I've cried
For the ones who've always lied
The times I've tried the times I've cried
For the ones who've always lied
When I look up to the skies
Is there someone out there
When it's time to say goodbye

And if it takes the death of me to make history
The whole world will remember my misery
I know what I'm tryin to say my words get in the way
They render me speechless oh black Jesus I'm cryin' inside
Couldn't give a fuck if I live or I die 'cause I'm just a slave
Who's brave but fuck pickin' cotton I'd rather see my grave
So I meditated before I was created and if you prefer sorrow
Made me reincarnated now I'm back rulin' MC's

Can't you see
A cog in the wheel
Of their factory
You'll do what you're told
Until you grow old
Or you get laid off
Because the company's sold
Change your mind
To change the way
You've lived up tilll now
Go somewhere
And have some fun
While you remember how
They'll buy a machine
Know what I mean
It punches your holes
At twice the speed
And half the cost
Look at the boss
A smile on his face
He's laughing his ass off
Change your mind
To change the way
You've lived up tilll now
Go somewhere
And have some fun
If you remember how <start> We're armed and ready to attack
To strike the city of all desires
Then calm the waves that lead to passion
When all reality turns back to ashes
Over the hills across the sea
Into the abyss of a bygone time
Lest we forget what really matters
And the bewildered look up to the sky
Fallen comrades lay on the ground
Victors in death they make no sound
Petrify my eyes
Behold the sights of battle lost
In this unchanging world
What does the poor life of a warrior cost
Oh can't you see
Many faces from God's own races are waiting
To fight the good fight
Even thought the animals of time have passed you by you still don't see
Oh you won't see
They've petrified your eyes <start> Aufzug so in Stucke

schmolle ich im kleinen Gartchengetroffen

Was meint ihr dann
Meint ihr die Trane brenne nicht
Was meint ihr dann
Stribt gar die Traubesfrucht
das kleine gierige Gezucht.
Du Rebstock kannst es lohnen verliebt an sussen Saften naschen
verfabren Dein Gemut und all der stet' insektenwirbel ist wohl mehr ein
Lebensbach Doch neinim Lauche baden Deine Fruchte in faulen
Spiegeln dicker Lufte Und all das Antitzgold ist nicht mehr als dann
ein dunkler Fleck Was nun mein Seufzer tragt ist Rieseln verschneites
Obst ein Schneckenhauschen das am Flecke gaz zerschellt.
Was bloss sind die Stiegen eines Schachers
Wenn ich hagerer Poet verbenne wie ein Kerzchen
Verschwinde wie ein Nebelstreich erfriere wie die grune Weinfrucht.
So erteile mir wie Sternen Dauer mir Narr ein Fass des Hasses
aus grossen Eimern mir manch Tropfen Blut zu leeren
das sei fur den entseelten Leib Tot unter Toten
Ein Lichterspielin grunen Meeren ja Gluhend
brennend lobernd und nicht mehr als eine Neigung
Vergiflete Augen diese verseuchten roten und grunen
Sind wute Traubeslust letzte Stimmen und doch getragne Moritaten
Der Greis so sagt man der graue Schelm hat sie versteckt
Er flusterst sie ins Nebelklied und weint fur einst verfemte Tinte Doch
Schlafes Nacht ich hab' verwacht verfemt ihr mir die Abschiedsnacht
So ritzt ich in das Holz Tisches das Bild der grunen Weinfrucht
Blickt hoch ins Himmelblau und zahit des Winters Flocken

Leaves are falling down
The tear maiden will not return
The seal of oblivion is broken
And a pure love's been turned into sin
At the dawn of our living time
Hope may cover all cries
Truth lurks hidden in the shadows
Dreams might be filled with lies
Soon there will be light
Pain remains inside
Suddenly it seemed so clear
All the blindness was taken away
She closed her eyes
And she called out my name
She was never ever seen again
Harvest of Sorrow
Your seed is grown
In a frozen world full of cries
When the ray of life shrinks
Shall cold winter nights begin
She is gone
And I fall from grace
No healing charm covers my wounds
Fooled's the dawn
And so am I
Fooled by life and a bitter doom
To bring you the end of the day
At the dawn of our living time
Hope it soon will pass by
Facing a darkness
I stand alone
Harvest of Sorrow
Your seed is grown
In a frozen world full of cries
When the ray of life shrinks
Shall cold winter nights begin <start> Towers all around us crumbling
They're the monuments we once built
Finding it harder to believe in something greater

OUR FALLEN HEROES
DESTROYING THEIR LIFE IN DAYS

DESTROYING THEIR LIFE IN DAYS

Magic runes once scratched into this tree.
An old man sat down at this mighty oak
Every morning day by day...
And he closed his eyes
While a gasp blew through its leaves...
And he began to speak...
Grimnismal verse   verse  
Roots as deep as the very depths of heart
Source for those who know what's still to come...
Man of wisdom and knowledge great
With hair as white as snow...
The young amongst them in a circle sat
And listened to his voice.

Hey Hey Hey
I know I know I know
In the cars or on the street
If you smile you are a creep
If you don't say it's very cold

I say they've got a bloody cheek
Vanity and presumption
Living in the hard porn shop lately
I say Hey hey hey

I know I know I know
And you're dying for a pee
So you go behind a tree
And a Star Wars police vehicle pulls up
I say gimme a taxi

Say Hey Hey Hey
I know I know I know <start> Let me paint you a portrait of a man
whose very name would define in times to come all things profane
Born unto privilege child of aristocracy
so tender the young mind yet so unclean
His was a heart of darkness that beat within his chest
Bringing life into the crimes he'd manifest
Imp of the perverse on a bloody path he trods
Scribe of the unthinkable the marquis de sade
Outraging the laws of hate and narcissism
That to fight the incubation's but in vain
Nature inspires our tastes bizarre
She paints them only as they are
From the darkest corners of the mind as real
as the morning sun shall rise just the same
He wove his written word with threads of flesh throughout
He promised things so frightening they'll turn you inside out
When terror's grip has set your soul is set aflame
Behold the architect of pain
Unearthing fantasies too savage to reveal
Twisting your world with visions centuries concealed
Was he philosopher or was he just insane
Behold the architect of pain
Each tale black as pitch dressed in the colors of hell
Your dreams will fill with the sounding of the knell
Feel the looming shadow of the hungry guillotine
And you'll be blinded by the blade's fatal gleam
Outraging the laws of both nature and religion
Subjugation in behalf or her domain
Or so he believed with all his hate and narcissism
That to fight the inclination's but in vain
Nature inspires our tastes bizarre
She paints them only as they are
From the darkest corners of the mind as real
as the morning sun shall rise just the same
Nature cannot bind you you only need to serve unto her
Harming without stint or cease at the expense of whosoever may be
Their pain becomes your paradise your <start> It was a dark night I couldn't see
And senses were unbound in ESP
When in dream awake
I'd paint.
Subconscious the expanse I saw
The portal to minds eye open
 I contemplated
Who it was that pulled the strings
Of those things I saw in dreadful masquerade
Of stark madness went merry round with my head
I passed out embraced their world
Savoured the poetry of revolt 
Sheer elegy of menace
I have not been the same since
I took on the profession of a devil
The world I see in a grotesque light
Evil perform with the gestures of a clown
Pure I live in blasphemy
Mephisto I am hidden in Madonnas gown
From the code of common sense I'm free
To bad you are not here to partake my strange horror
'Cause here is where our ways will part
I will not exchange this power
spring of my suffering
I do not envy the conscience pure
of the blind man in his bliss world
I would not be devoid the fruit of guile <start> Desperate cries in the hour of vengeance
Merciless the way of the world
Traumatized by the hours of chaos
No place you can run
Seal your fate a relentless attack
Rising of a foreign flag
Revenge doesn't matter on who
As long as it's one of them
Submission relentless obliterated from the past
Fire destruction now there's no turning back
Show 'em no love
The bastard is ripe and fit for the bleeding
Death from above death from above
The bastard is ripe for the bleeding
Crucified the profit is vanquished
Killing of the newborn king
Justified by those who compel us servants
Of a different fate
Certain death signs of a hysteria
Confusion on the way to the way to the gates
Terror among the ranks
Now you will be laid to waste
Submissionrelentless obliterated from the past
Fire destruction now there's no turning back
Show 'em no love
The bastard is ripe and fit for the bleeding
Death from above death from above
The bastard is ripe for the bleeding
He who shall arise like a Phoenix from the flame
Demon shall arise lay your soul to waste
Show 'em no love
The bastard is ripe and fit for the bleeding
Death from above death from above
The bastard is ripe and fit for the bleeding <start> Instrumental <start> Hey little sister what have you done

I've been away for so long

It's a nice day to start again.
Take me back home
There is nothin' fair in this world
There is nothin' safe in this world
And there's nothin' sure in this world
And there's nothin' pure in this world
ook for something left in this world
Start again
Come on
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again.
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again <start> When Jason was at the table
I kept on seeing him look at me when he was with that other girl
Do you think he was just doing that to make me jealous
Because he was totally texting me all night last night
And I don't know if it's a booty call or not
So like what do you think
Did you think that girl was pretty
How did that girl even get in here
Did you see her
She's so short and that dress is so tacky
Who wears cheetah
It's not even summer why does the DJ keep on playing Summertime Sadness
After we go to the bathroom can we go smoke a cigarette
I really need one
But first
Let me take a selfie
Can you guys help me pick a filter
I don't know if I should go with XX Pro or Valencia
I wanna look tan
What should my caption be
I want it to be clever
How about Livin' with my bitches Hashtag live
I only got  likes in the last  minutes
Do you think I should take it down
Let me take another selfie
Wait pause Jason just liked my selfie
What a creep
Is that guy sleeping over there
Yeah the one next to the girl with no shoes on
That's so ratchet
That girl is such a fake model
She definitely bought all her Instagram followers
Who goes out on Mondays
Ok let's go take some shots
Oh no I feel like I'm gonna throw up
Oh wait never mind I'm fine
Let's go dance
There's no vodka at this table
Do you know anyone else here
Oh my god Jason just texted me
Should I go home with him
I guess I took a good selfie
Let me take a selfie <start> Your hand ran over me
I got your sympathy
But now you broke my neck
I feel it in my head
I see it in your eyes
I feel it in my head
See you're feeling cold
It's cold inside of you
I'm almost sure
You don't know what you do
But now I turn from you
Don't want to be your fool
Nomore for you to beg
See you're feeling cold
It's cold inside of you
My frozen heart nomore for your to feel
Cold... cold... cold
Receive but what you give
In your my devil lives
I wish you all the worst
You feel it in my head
I see it in your eyes
You feel it in your head <start> I am lonelyI am not alone. We are together.
Pleasure concomitant with pain. Joy and sorrow intertwine on life's verdant tendrils. Ever so black.
Dull ached crouches on my chest. Stupidity a curse. Intelligence a burden. Innocence is bliss.
United in our solitude. Contentedly wasting our lives. I want to exchange my gift.
As balck as my life. As dark as my thread. As strong as concrete. As weak as thought.
I scream so loudly. But I cannot hear myself ...Anymore.
Pain dulls through repetition. Part played incessantly. The same night over the next exact.
oin in lonliness. We shall rise...never...eternally. We hang below the neophytes. The strand splitting  Dilemma we only wish for  As we drift into yesterday Will I see tomorrow It's a million years away... <start> In the last time occurences guided me
To the land where the lie lives
It's sovereigns have to humbug us
In such a way that all men's thinking's growing stiff
Joining in the conversation reforming the situation 
This epoch is too weakwilled for this
Lifeless end or endless life
Narcotics affect the senses
Melancholic dreams or hysterical faces
Fascinated in a state without preceptive faculty
Strength of purpose wearies and the complexion fades
Because manipulation's modern methods stamped from cruelty
You're just blinded by a dream that does not exist
You think that you will find your fortune
Appear this feeling NO  feelings disappear
Narcotics signify gloom
Influxes are soporific
Physic and psychic narcotic
Lugubrious I guess I'm sick
Physic and psychic narcotic
At first sight the front's iridescent
Loss of sight but future's earsplitting
'cause awfully the trombones will sound in the end
Consciousness is embedded in illusions
Which are incompetent to criticism
Shades of deception cover relected images
Reality is dimming and the untruth is rising
Sentiment is apathetic and argument just hypothetic
So all responsible men have an easy game
Illness of time and time of illness
Narcotics the braincells wane
Influxes are soporific
Physic and psychic narcotic
Lugubrious I guess I'm sick
Physic and psychic narcotic
At first sight coherence's not to see
Loss of sight earth's dirge frustrating me
I am under the impression that I suffocate
Some people feel passion but they don't premeditate
Addicted to their fashion not considering their fate
Mankind needs a lesson it's imperative and not too late
The wise's providence affect anxiety neurosis
Event's concomitants affect a higher dosis
That is the prce we pay and we all know this
So the afterthought's evanescence entails narcosis

The proclamation of the real present predicament
Would cause people t recognize their passive behaviour
So we reached the point where we have to change our view
Lift the veil of concealed events  and above all 
Reconquer vigilance <start> The cold winds blew into life my adored.
A bleeding heart we share now on Azraels wings.
I fall like autumn rain
You are my everything.
This lovelorn kiss of death in lugubrious silence
Dawn breaks open like a wound and the dreadful sun
Two souls entwined together
Still so alone.
Both you and I are shattered
And frozen in stone.
You begged for air from within this cold tomb
With pain sharp as a knife.
I now lie resting like a child on thy womb
Gave back a part of my life.
For a while it had disappeared but nothing was changed.
A haze fell forever with her fading life.
I leaned my head back then drank of opaline.
The emerald goddess came to me she craved my soul.
And just for a while I had forgotten.
Yes it was all forgotten but nothing was changed.
Suddenly a cold breeze blew across our room
It felt like I wanted to leave this world with her.
Come drink with me the divine nectar of Olympus
Sit beside me and help defy our adversity and loss
This adversity and loss. It all ends with you
I kiss you in your dying breath sleeping quietly now.
Swept away by heavy eyelids forever in my dreams
And you will be safe in my dearest dreams
My love forever in my dearest dreams. <start> And now destined to be
The last one standing here
The past alive to me
And mocking hope is all I had
In weakness it hides from me
And then it infiltrates my heart
So wrong to think I had found
It was so long since I felt that at all
I had dreamed long in days without
I had so long wanted something much more
Those looks so lovingly caressed
My thoughts and still today
They scream to me
Their sweet warmth moistening my breath
I may never get away
I crave I hunger
And still I leave behind
This wreckage in my wake
I was not long inside
But still savor the taste
I'd rather hate myself for failing
Than hate myself for never having tried
Nothing will fill me
The way these passions do
The feeling tempts me and warms me <start> R. Nattefrost '
The toes that you step on today may be
connected to the ass you'll be kissing tommorow.
These feelings are left from you.
Like a vast burning field
and then you submit yourself to me.
Perversion of the flesh.
With needles in thin skinned places.
The warm blood of life poured on the floor
but who gives a shit when your life is a plague.
A rollercoster ride of pain.
I saw the white in your eyes.
Beat me she said.
Cruel violent shotgun love.
I kill you point blank range.
I drank too much of the midnight wine
disregardless of whatever i claim my throne.
Your voice kept ringin in my ears
like little echoes from yesterdays.
I did not want
I did not feel. <start> My father tried to tell me son just get your feet on the ground
You're in deep way over your head just turn your life around
Poor mother all I ever gave to her was pain  I didn't realise
The last thing I remember was the tears running from her eyes
Something happened along the way  I was a bad child
Something happened they'd always say  I was a little wild
I was a bad child
Playing hookey drinkin octane I didn't care anymore  no
Always running against the grain I was rotten to the core
I could live forever  until they threw me out the door
I was sleeping on the floor
Something happened along the way  I was a bad child
Something happened they'd always say  I was a little wild
I was a bad child
My father tried to tell me son just get your feet on the ground
You're in deep way over your head I've turned my life around
My mother was the best to me I guess I never realized
One thing that I'll never forget was the tears running from her
Eyes
Something happened along the way  I was a bad child
Something happened they'd always say  I was a little wild
Some along the way now I'm living for a better day
Something happened along the way  I was a bad child
Running wild <start> Young and confused
Socially abused
Can't find liberation
Fucked up in a hole
Take my life
Hold me until I die
Force feeding me
Umbilical delinquincy
Shoot me in a vein
Fuck me in the brain
'Till the feeling's gone
Then just turn and run
Experiment addiction
Dependency is form
Take my life
Hold me until I die
Take my life
Hold me until I die
Take my life
Hold me until I die
Take my life
Hold me until I die
Take my life
Hold me until I die
On and on and over again
My heart stops beating
And the room starts spinning
On and on and over again
My heart stops beating
And the room starts spinning
On and on and over again
My heart stops beating
And the room starts spinning
On and on and over again
My heart stops beating
And the room starts spinning <start> Agonized terrified horrified
Emotions brutalized
Crucified nailed to the cross
With spikes through my hands
I shall die upon this cross
All by myself
Salvations lost
Soon to be dead
Consider me as another victim
Of their plans
But my choice
Is not your jesus christ
Now I'm dead alone and
Rotting on his cross
But I'll be back
Hell is what I want
Hell is what I get
In the fires I'll burn
But there's nothing I'll regret
Hell awaits me
My soul is raped
I will get them I will kill them
At the end of time
As long they are free
Preaching their shit
I'll never find peace <start> and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep... <start> music Eternal Tears of Sorrow
lyrics Vetelinen
The dance of two free souls...No more masquerades of mortals
Just you and me as nightly guests at the dance hall of our last Autumn
Your look's so faithful so brave...as you feel our common pain
Our lives and love now in a single stream...the stream of our last Autumn's
grief
Together we lived our lives...and together we will leave...
It shall be the final tie of our bloody seal...
We gave our secret promise on the shore of our red streams...
The bloody oath of real love...the oath of red falling leaves...
Your look's full of passion...as the night kisses your skin
You close your eyes and also let me feel our common will
This crimson stream will be the final step on the path of our mortal lives
You know our love is real...and oh yeah so do I...so do I
Together we lived our lives...and together we will leave
It shall be the final tie of our bloody seal
We gave our secret promise on the shore of our red streams
The bloody oath of real love...the oath of red falling leaves
Together we lived our lives...and together we will leave
It shall be the final tie of our bloody seal
We gave our secret promise on the shore of our red streams
The bloody oath of real love...the oath of red falling leaves of the last
Autumn <start> I bear these scars
A constant reminder of my own inadequacy
I've held everything and nothing all at once
And all at once been altogether broken
But even scars fade with time
Only You remain
And my determination is not enough
Even so I bear these scars <start> It was when I realized
that life has no meaning
no purpose no quarry
...no answeres...
And all the dreary night
that had befallen across
the land
I slipped into a revery
a web of human hand
You longed to soar up high
to caress the silky winds
to embrace and kiss as lovers
...the ether...
but fate with cursed hand
has struck wretch apon your head
this wretch has been the day
you were born 
I live my life alone
and all it's misery
until the day I turn to stone
I shall die alone
among the wilderness
It was when I realized
apon my waking eyes
no nightmare of mankind
can harm me...
I live my life alone
among the wilderness
until the day i turn to stone
Life is but a dream
among the wilderness
...I spread my golden wings
set sail my weightless form
and soar into the cosmos
...Forevermore... <start> Strophe 
Jede Nacht steig ich hinab
ins dunkle Nichts der kalten Stadt
Wir sind getrieben von Lust und Gier
Wir brechen aus ins Jetzt und Hier
Im Sog der Snde mit aller Gewalt
wird heie Lust mit Leid bezahlt
Und wieder und wieder
streckst du mich lustvoll nieder
Und wieder und wieder
gerbst du mir das Gefieder
Refrain
Du riechst mich du jagst mich du hast mich
eiskalt erwischt
Ich ruf dich verfluch dich du packst mich
du hast du hast mich
eiskalt erwischt
Strophe 
Jede Nacht rei ich mit Lust
das kalte Herz aus deiner Brust
Wir sind getrieben von Lust und Leid
Zerbrechen an der Wirklichkeit
Im Sog der Snde fr immer versklavt
wird heie Lust mit Leid bestraft
Refrain
Du riechst mich du jagst mich du hast mich
eiskalt erwischt
Ich ruf dich verfluch dich du packst mich
du hast du hast mich
eiskalt erwischt
eiskalt erwischt 
eiskalt erwischt
eiskalt erwischt
und wieder
und wieder
und wieder
und wieder
und wieder
und wieder
streckst du mich lustvoll nieder
Refrain
Du riechst mich du jagst mich du hast mich
eiskalt erwischt
Ich ruf dich verfluch dich du packst mich
du hast du hast mich
eiskalt erwischt 
eiskalt erwischt 
eiskalt erwischt 
eiskalt erwischt <start> Invading your privacy by authoritative rule
Finding a culprit or maybe a mule
Law breaking citizen tries to keep it cool
Keep it cool
You must try to obstain
Nothing to stop the pain
For breaking this law they will incarcerate
Random testing they wait for you to urinate
You must try to obstain
Nothing to stop the
Piss test fill the cup
Piss test filler up
Technology today makes it easy to pry
Well all I can say is Here's piss in your eye
Here's piss in your eye
You must try to obstain
Nothing to stop the pain <start> I always knew I had what it took
To jump over any obstacle
Together or separate we've been through
Fight for me and I'd kill for you
I always knew things were the same
But there's a caution light in your brain
I won't help with your cement shoes
If bailing out is what you choose
You've been spending years and years
Carrying your biggest fears
Too long Too long
You've been sucked in through a hole
With your vision of control
So wrong So wrong
If you leave your defences down
Who'll chew you up and spit you out
If you leave your defences down
Who will pick you up
Chorus
Poison my eyes
Better men have tried
Tried to take me down
A man is a man is a
Man you can't see clear
Now your forced to hear
All that you dread
Better to keep it hidden
believing it's what you deserve
You make me feel everything I do
Betters me and sabotages you
But all it does is leave you behind
As you disconnect from the grind
Drowning in your own denial
Is as simple as a smile
One is strong one insecure
Who dies first in our private war
You've been wasting years and years
Running from your darkest fears
Too long Too long
You've been falling through the holes
Now your vision of control
Is gone Is gone
If you leave your defences down
Who'll chew you up and spit you out
If you leave your defences down
Who will pick you up
Chorus
Be dangerous and unpredictable and make a lot of noise
Be dangerous and unpredictable and make a lot of noise
Be dangerous and unpredictable and make a lot of noise
Be dangerous and unpredictable and make a lot of noise <start> What do you
when the devil looks right in your eyes
and you find out your entire life is a lie
inside capital hill those cowards were laughing
the towers were crashin they allowed it to happen
devoured the fragments and the media's sight
with some of the sickest shit I have ever seen in my life
orchestrated by masons all related
their royal seal and oil fields corporate hatred
but how could I be concerned with world war
Gotta worry about dyin from stickin some girl raw
What you heard before aint as big as a lesson
As George and Jeb Bush rigged elections
press release worldwide west to east
followed by George juniors acceptance speech
Im too stressed to sleep but believe Im alive
cause death just creeps so I sleep when I die
Im screamin out why as I reach for the sky
I danced with the devil God dont even reply
burn weed till Im high with my chest weezin
left breathin shadow of death creepin
my ex beefin layin threats to get even
me dreamin of Russian Roulette left leakin
but if I was left leakin Id be acceptin judgement
so I made my choice I aint acceptin nothing
I dont believe your truth Ive been lied to
So if your ready to fight Im right beside you
If you dont believe you dont see what I do
Just open your eyes the truth is inside you
I run into CBS with a beret and shootin
this way I can televise the revolution
no resolution when cops load up a glock clip
and shoot like  holdin his wallet
luckily bolic was raised in street smarts
taught since birth to evade police narks
prayin to God fightin satans beast mark
hopin one day I could make the seas part
I cross the train tracks and hear an outcry
Like why is the ghetto always on the southside
Skeptics will understand the art of war
when they lock the streets and declare martial law
when a rain of microchips starts to pour
what the fuck do you think the national guard is for
its a bad dream when Big Brother maps genes
and inject technology in kids vaccines
its next to nothin but my blood pressures rushin
and damn right Ill fight sleep cause deaths its cousin
but now maybe youll believe me and listen a bit
when youre all in line to get a microchip in your wrist
we livin this shit governments playin the role
they invented aids for population control
theyve taken a hold and sold satan your soul
while people like you and me are breakin the mold
I dont believe your truth Ive been lied to
So if your ready to fight Im right beside you
If you dont believe you dont see what I do
Just open your eyes the truth is inside you
Its not just my home its real in every place
like anthrax sent from a military base
yall let me lay stakes who imitate the disciples
watchin the catholic church manipulate the bible
I never stood a chance and joined the scripture
freemasons free basin poised in the mixture
my point is true with the boys in blue
got me lookin over my shoulder
tryin to enjoy the view
I got two words for Bloomberg and Giuliani
Fuck you George Bush and the Illuminati
I wanna go to the oval office and pop a few
and act out the cover of Revolutionary Volume 
they watchin you for national past time
believe me Ill be red flagged for the last line
pull down the lockdown for the hood forever
be a bigger gang than the bloods and the crips put together
marines still dying in Iraq it seems ill
Bush already contracted the Lobbyists for rebill
Theyll fund his campaign and be an infallous vermin
Tryin to build a pipeline owned by Halliburton
But Gods watchin us to keep the evidence clear
While Lucifer whispers orders in the presidents ear
Heaven is near but hell is even closer
I live it everyday watchin demons approach us
I dont believe your truth Ive been lied to
So if your ready to fight Im right beside you
If you dont believe you dont see what I do
Just open your eyes the truth is inside you <start>  <start> Her flesh decaying she rises to see
Lecherous ghouls with rotting erections
Her breasts are lactating blood and pus
An orgy of death cadavers of lust
Gray skinned bodies pulsate as one
Grasping her flesh erotic undead
Maggots crawl on their rotting cocks
Into her cunt rigid like rock
Fucking the zombie whore
Unite the dead
Fucking the zombie whore
Fornicate
Breeding the damned
Carcasses writhe
Revel in death
Bleeding and sore
Insatiable corpse
Consummate the bonds of death
Beautiful eyes are now vacant pits
Her body contorts her vagina has fangs
Putrid fluids will mix in her loins
The seed of the undead will grow inside
Hiding from mankind the embryo grows
Nourished by flesh the mother consumes
After the birth the child will grow
Prince of the dead conceived by profanity
Fucking the zombie whore
Unite the dead
Fucking the zombie whore
Fornicate
Gifted with speech
The offspring will lead
Establish their reign
Lusting for flesh
But living not dead
The corpses will rape
Rape
Lascivious legions of blasphemous ghouls
Kill to create whore of their own
Lust of the dead will multiply
Thousands of corpses beginning to rise
Living again for rape and destruction
Ejaculate bile from their erections
Lascivious legions of blasphemous ghouls
Kill to create whore of their own
Kingdom of rot the bastard will rule
Stinking of death zombies will roam
Through the whore the world was crushed
An orgy of death cadavers of lust
Licentious masses rejoicing in sin
Larva faced sluts fucking the ghouls
The rancid bodies will copulate
Their barren world they repopulate
Fucking the zombie whore
Unite the dead
Fucking the zombie whore
Fornicate <start> What will bring me hope
I see the death of my soul
That's sure that not your smile
You can't say me that was all
I see my fear in your eye
That brings shadow to my life
Reality  used to be a friend of lies
Reality  there's no other choice of mine
Reality  that's what I see in your eye
Reality  fuck you  kill me o'right
With your Smiling Killer Eyes
The evil and poor side of your life
That's what I see in killer eyes
Why can't you realize
It's my life what you deny
Yeah that's the aim of my fight
And you can't deny it only try <start> A relapse of my body
Sends my mind into multiple seizures
Psychologically a new human being
One that has never been
Cursed by the shamen
his voodoo spell has my soul
My limbs
go numb
I can't control my own thought
Are his now
his evil consuming me
ever telling me
begin the clit carving
Slowly turning me into a flesh eating zombie
Knowing this spell can only be broken
by the vaginal skins of young women
I proceed to find the meat
their bleeding cunts will set me free
Warmth seeping from this
Body
Rotted
After I sucked the blood from her ass
I feel more alive
more alive than I've ever been
Even though now I'm dead within
My mouth drools
As I slice your perinium
My body smeared
With the guts I've extracted
through her hole came swollen organs
cunnilingus with the mutilated
My spirit returned from the dead
Released by the priest
but I felt more real
when I was dead
The curse is broken
I have a dependence on vaginal skin
It's become my sexual addiction
I must slit the twitching clit
Rotted cavity hold the juice
Between the legs I love to carve
My cock is dripping with her blood <start> What makes you think
You deserve the sediment of my truth
You should expect me to be so honest
I owe you nothing no blue prints for growth
I can barely begin to tackle myself
A friend is a foreign term
Good better best intangible
Please one at a time it's all they can handle
Please let me blend as well it's always too much
Cover at the repercussions of honesty
It means nothing yet still the world hanging on every word
Violence is no motive to communicate
Come unto me in all your glory
All consuming in this childish pride
Your blows so soothing is this proof
This does not cancel any options
Broken idols so comical
I won't accept anything less
Than absence of prostituted smiles <start> Verse I
When the heat becomes too much
And desires not enough
But your defeat
Won't lead you to submission
I can feel the aching strain
Thoughts dulled by the pain
But I can't abandon my obsession
We won't back down
From this life we found
Chorus
I can't promise that you'll enjoy
All the things that I've done
Leaving all my fears behind
The best is yet to come
Dreams become reality
I know it won't be long
It's time for you to burn with me
As I head into the sun
Verse II
We try to find a way out
When your minds consumed by doubt
But in your heart
The only way is forward
I strive to push ahead
despite this sense of dread
There is only one way this is gonna end
We won't back down
From this life we found <start> No more blame
if everyday promises died again.
No more prays
if everyday our game's the same.
I need your warm close to me
I wanna dream to night as well
Should we have chosen once again
another final
You need my hand close to you.
You wanna listen my silence again.
Should we have chosen our losing dreams
or another fantasy
Oh oh ooh ooh oh oh
Waiting the time of our end.
Don't miss my words
if daylight is getting close.
Don't take my love
if everyday you must go <start> Look that this is the dark
The absence of light
Time to riddles and fear
Darkness is calling me
Creatures that you never seen
Mystery and defeat
Looks scary I know
But the darkness is all we have
We are in the dark...
Here I am again
Don't be afraid of the...
I am sure you can't don't be afraid of the dark
Try to control my mind
I can't live with fear
It's like a mystery
What the darkness is...
Look that this is the dark
The absence of light
Time to riddles and fear
Darkness is calling me
Creatures that you never seen
Mystery and defeat
Looks scary I know
But the darkness is all we have
We are in the dark...
Here I am again
Don't be afraid of the...
I am sure you can't don't be afraid of the dark <start> Driving through
A lonely road
I put my mind in a frozen numb mode
A hundred miles
I have to go
Sweetest moment
Leave me on my own
All I feel is true
A thousand miles of freedom running through
All I see is the way
To keep me astray and far away from you
When the night just turns to day
Gather all your sins and run away
Cause you ride so fast to hell
When your fears arrest you as a cell
All I feel is true
A thousand miles of freedom running through
All I see is the way
To keep me astray and far away from you
Now I'm free
So I will let you go
End of winter
Raise the sun
Close the windows
Lock the door
Take the freeway
To the stars
All I feel is true
A thousand miles of freedom running through
All I see is the way
To keep me astray and far away from you
It's all an another night it's all you in another night <start> Coming down from the mountain on high
Towards the battle we go side by side
Our hearts are filled with honour and pride
Cause we know our time has come
Silent voices down from below
Rising up through the ice and the snow
Ancient angers cast upon all
Through the lands of the slain
Through the dark night and through the rain
Fighting machine we have risen again
Stronger than all the world we arise...
Stand and fight join the light
Into the battle with power and might
Sound the guns raise the cannons of war...
With the North Star to guide us
We ride on the sky
Blazing up through the heavens
Like eagles we fly
And the horsemen shall come
They will judge all your lives
Revelations will now be unveiled
Darkened night set to the swallow the light
All is lost there's no one left to fight
Overpowered by the glory and might
Of the ones who stands tall
Fallen heroes scattered around
Deafened ears opens up to the sound
Painful cries rising forever more
From the victims of life and of war
Through the dark night and through the rain
Fighting machine we have risen again
Stronger than all the world we arise...
Stand and fight join the light
Into the battle with power and might
Sound the guns raise the cannons of war...
With the North Star to guide us
We ride on the sky
Blazing up through the heavens
Like eagles we fly
And the horsemen shall come
They will judge all your lives
Revelations will now be unveiled
No more hope of freedom
Our dreams are washed away
The second age is coming
The dawn of a new day
The judgement stands before us
The second king will rise
Our swords will shine with honour
As hatred fills the skies...
With the North Star to guide us
We ride on the sky
Blazing up through the heavens
Like eagles we fly
And the horsemen shall come
They will judge all your lives
Revelations will now
With the North Star to guide us
We ride on the sky
Blazing up through the heavens
Like eagles we fly
And the horsemen shall come
They will judge all your lives
Revelations will now
Revelations will now
Revelations will now be unveiled <start> I gave her eyes my own to take
and round she turned my sake
My hands in need
and gave herself indeed
I met a girl down in the meads
A fading rose was on her cheeks
Her honey eyes dreaming wild
Full beautiful a fairychild
And on the floor she's all alone
I sit upon this cold grey stone
And I dream my time away
yet conversing as I may
And the stars through the spears
My heart waters full of tears
Run in blood down the wall
for another give you ease
Do you know who made you
You are called by what you do
Into spheres spheres we see
Joy reduces to misery
I feel my strenght to fade
Almost asleep my only sake
She spoke the words used the clue
I love you true...
And the fields black and bare
The eternal winter's there
Fed with cold fearless hands
in a rich and fruitful land
And the sun does never shine
Joy another loss of mine
In what distant deeps or skies
burned the fire of your eyes
Never end... <start> Remembering promises
Once made but now unspoken
Born of child like minds
These shadows of the past are now
forsaken.
From the dawn of your first day
To this death bed on which you lay
To survive we must comply
With the ritual of your life.
Can you remember things we said
The dreams our expectations
Like ashes scattered in the wind
There is no recollection.
Throughout the passing years
Faith will allay your years
Follow the holy rites
In the ritual of your life.
Life an endless ritual
Continuation perpetual
Throughout the passing years
Faith will allay your years
Follow the holy rites
In the ritual of you life.
Try to remember if you can
The pacts we made most solemn
Hands of time have brought decay
Those memories are forgotten.
Now as you reach the end
All pain you must transcend
When you die you can't deny
The ritual of your life. <start> Gods Of The Mountains

Feather black against the burning sky
Spread your wings and ride the wind
Gaze down on me with blackest eyes.
Fly my ravens fly ahead.
Over the mountains and endless sky
Fly my ravens fly ahead
Over the mountains over my head.
Let the wind carry you up high.
Fly my ravens it's time to fly
And for me maybe to die.
Valley of Death in the land of no return
The moment of glory or death <start> I'm the family face
Flesh perishes I live on
Projecting trait and trance.
Through time to times anon
And leaping from place to place
Over oblivion
The years  heired feature that can
In cursive and voice and eye
Despise the human span
Of durance  that is I
The eternal thing in man
That no call to die. <start> You took their lives
And you took their souls
To be the king of their land
You brought them misery
Anger and pain
To keep the crown in your hands
But soon they will tear you
Down to the crowd
The prophecy's coming true
It's death and revenge what they shout
The time has come
To face your desteny
Your life is done
And you're burning for eternity
You promised them heaven
And brought them to hell
Behind your blood shedded walls
Why don't you see
You're under a spell
And madness has taken its toll
And they won't forgive you
Soon you will die
And no one will help you through
The price that you pay for your lies
The time has come
To face your desteny
Your life is done
And you're burning for eternity <start> Impulsive necroplasma.
Injected in your veins.
Spiritually deceased.
Bringing life to dead and death do life.
Chemical injection producing immortality.
From this fate you cannot flee.
Suffocate filled with hate pray to die
Suffocate ripping your soul.
Sience abuse has reached its goal.
Filled with hate all feelings are gone.
You are trapped within.
You feel no pain pain is all you feel.
Injection is prepared for eternity.
It circles in your blood rigor mortis course
is twisting impulses your life is but is no more.
Die... Rise high above the low.
Deathless... Still you can feel the flow.
Never know which way you'll fade.
Insane cell will always be.
Dominate ripping your mind.
In the maze of existence... <start> Shadenfreude
Remember me
Remember me through your life of misery
Remember me
Remember me through death and eternity
Damage joy
A continuum of grief and despair
Devastation and harm
A death to the peace in your world
Extract delight
From you and your suffering
Your pain it's my pleasure
To choke all the life out of
I was put on this earth to relish in the suffering of fools
Yes people like you
The reason I exist is to ridicule and torment
People like you
It is my raison d'etre
I exist for no other reason <start> what late forgotten nights to emptiness has given
and now november morning will be taken asunder
the shovel stained with dirt in the hours of belonging
dug into the undiscovered of a life a pest a plague
falling back into the arms  no never
admitting to a life alone  no
claiming there are sparks inside  no
outside looking back  no
so the lie never stopped
cling to the wave it cried and onward to the night
expecting not and nothing in the presence of a lie
the deeper that it dug the more now had to go
surrender was a fact and the room was decoreated
 the lie never stopped
what late forgotten nights to emptiness has given
the strangers may they come in ignorance's disguise
so into the dark walking to leave the last of times
kneedeep in desperation to fill the gap behind
boldly thread the night forever
november thought are right  oh never
taken from the fall  no
frightened by the key but the trail behind the house
felt compelling and new  the lie never stopped
found at loss for words now words aren't enough
someone told a vacancy was open
someone laughed the silence here was broken
dug up to make room
the room which you furnaced and graced
there is no vacancy
the least can fill the fountain
the most will flood the mold <start> Gouge out your eyes pull your heart to the floor
With my heart my skin my kiss stand back drop to your knees
I'll stand back as you bleed my heart my skin my kiss
This blade it feels so cold baby hold me while I'm shaken
This knife has pierced my soul I sit alone while I'm shaken
And yes I'll laugh out loud with blind eyes I'm shaken
Gouge out your eyes pull your heart to the floor
Sweetness love me tastes me hears me
Stand back drop to your knees
I'll stand back as you bleed
Sweetness love me tastes me hears me
This blade it feels so cold baby hold me while I'm shaken
This knife has pierced my soul I sit alone while I'm shaken
And yes I'll laugh out loud with blind eyes I'm shaken
Now take me out of this place
Now take me out of this place
Out take me out take me out take me out
Out take me out take me out take me out
Take me take me take me out
Gouge out your eyes pull your heart to the floor
With my heart my skin my kiss
Stand back drop to your knees
I'll stand back as you bleed with my heart my skin my kiss
Yes I amyes I amyes I am yes I am
My heart my skin my kiss
Gouge out your eyes pull your heart to the floor
With my heart my skin my kiss. stand back drop to your knees.
I'll stand back as you bleed
Sweetness love me tastes me hears me
Wait for them to come again and take you away from me
I can't wait for you to come again and take you black rose dying <start> Go look at the moon
And inspect the sun
Now they are in the sky
Right in their old places
Hail moon for gleeming
Fair one for showing your face
Dear sun for dawning
And daylight for coming up
Dear moon you're out from the rock
Fair day from the cliff
You've risen as a golden cuckoo
As a silver dove
Up to where you used to live
Fare well now upon
Your way upon your journey
Sweetly end your curve beautifully
Come at evening into joy <start> you feed those crimson sorrows
inside my burning veins
you're tearing me out and kissing me dead
as my collection of failures grows
but deep there's a chaosdemon
that's called myself
feasting on vengeance
in mind's pandemonium
in your whore world illusion
unlocked red light dreams
you never wanted to see
how I want you to stay
tired of constant crawling
an aimless odyssey
I stare into your eyes
and watch that something dies
starfall
breaks the silence
let us go
for we're the earthborn phantoms
the eye of the storm that's yet to come
dreamseekers
young night thieves
we steal the tragedies unbearable
false healers
golden frames of innocence stiffle us
soulfever rapes me
the contecst of my movements
misoginistic hell
an icon of regret <start> Monoxide Child
Now that I'm dead and gone
Look at me
I'm floating like the breeze
With my roots strong like trees
I'm filtered in your memories
Holding a candle light vigil
Saying a prayer
My name is graced
Buried with the paint on my face
I put the chase up long enough
I live the lifestyle wrong and tough
And now my life span's up
I give a fuck
I'm about to run it in the after life
And hopefully they put my soul in the butcher knife
Shaggy  Dope
If I was to die
It'd make a lot of people happy
No funeral possesions
No plot at the cemetery
Finally
I can be alone in my own world
The wagons come take me away from the killing fields
If I was to die
Would you finally shut your mouth
Understand what I am
Understand what I'm about
Like curse
Place me up high on your pedastil
I'm about to find out

Chorus x
I wanna die
So I can see the otherside
I wanna die
So I can fly 
I wanna die
Take me to the otherside
I wanna die
So I can fly 
Violent J
I wanna die
Maybe I'll get angel wings
So I can cut them off
Cook them up
I have some helly wing dings
I'd take my hallo off
Get myself a ladder
Hang it on the wall
Maybe you'll think it's a gold record
Death
Everybody follow my hearse
Why does everybody always gotta go and die first
Before their homies are missing them
Family members kissing them
Everybody even enemies stop dissing them
I want to die
So I can haunt my buddies
Stand behind them in the mirror with my eyes all bloody
Stick my long black cold tongue all in the ear
And be like I'm only playing
And disappear
I wanna die
And have everything answered
What happened to my father
Why was I a bastard
What is thunder
Is it really God bowling
And nightime's a blanket
And all the stars are the holes in it
Chorus x
Jamie Madrox
Your answers are unneccesary
You understand
Never question the emotions
Of an unstable man
I got the petals of the Lotus
And the pedal to the floor
Following a black hearse
In the rain through a thunder storm
Never once did I invision
Me being stuck in such a situation
He made decisions
And now his spirit levitating
I can see him waving at me
Through the window of the hearse
He's crying blood
It all stops and it gets worst
Blaze Ya Dead Homie
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
At least that's what I was told
When I was on the come up
Been to the grave and it ain't no joke
Resurfaced to the earth with the spirits I envoke
Cut down in my prime
When my block got hit
Now I'm riding in the back of a hearse and shit
Darkness pitch black
Never seeing no one
And the devil got his darkest demons
Riding shotgun
Chorus x
Take me away
Take me with you
Take me away
Take me with you
Take me away echo <start> 
I have done all my quests.
I am glad more or less.
Last time when I had gone 
She had screamed she would come
And try to recognise
What a deuce... Wench am I
I shalt bring many things
When I spread my dark wings.
So ye wilt scream and cry 
I shalt hurt ye and I'll
Raise your laugh for a while
After that... Whore am I
In the groove
The most of you will never got to be happy at all
Because you can only weep and complain
Because you try to remember your own childhood's days...
I've got to remind you of coffins
And haunt you again and again
And the chain of life won't break anyway...
So eaten bread is soon forgotten 
Taken cares soon disappear
Angel of the dreams and nightmares
Show me the way you have flown this night
What have you seen
What have you heard
What have you done
...At the eventide
I was flying high above the woods
I was going across the hills
Through the trees
I've seen the bloody moon in the midnight skies
I've shed the vampiric mist on the fields
Oh I worked very hard...
But I don't seem to have done a lot...
World needs adversities
Because they give you  hope 
The hope does let you get
Something's like a nice tomb.
Are you silly worm really surprised
Do not you know opportunity seldom knocks twice...
And your cares knock at your door almost everyday
So eaten bread is soon forgotten 
Taken cares soon disappear
Don't cry poor mankind be quiet  I am here.
Soon I'll be feeding you... Guess what I brought
You as the others do need some meal. 
I will have given to you that ideal
I've ruined the human mansions 
Now there's misery and sadness there
Lick up your sweet desperation
Have your bread and have your death
But eaten bread is soon forgotten 
Almost all these brats ate the bread
Devoured the gotten
I worked very hard...
But I don't seem to have done a lot...
And so I shall never stay without my work. <start> Two thousand fattened years like maniacs
Have despoiled our common grave
Now what necrophagous Second Coming backs
From the cradle to enslave
Sickle constellations
Stud the velts that welt the sku
Whilst the Bitter winter moon
Prowls the clouds deadeyed
Like shifting parent flesh
Under silk matricide...
Watchful as she was upon Eden
Where every rose arbour and orchard she swept
hid the hissing of a serpent Libido
In an ancient tryst with catastrophe
Soon to be kept
Hear that hissing now on the breeze
As through the plundered groves of the carnal garden
A fres horror blows
But ten billion souls
Are blind to see the rotting wood for the trees
This is the theme to a better Armageddon
Nightchords rake the heavens
Pandaemonaeon
And what use are prayers to that 'god '
As devils bay concenus for the space to piss
On your smouldering faith
And the the mouldering face
Of this world long a paradise lost
This is the end of everything
Hear the growing chora that a new dawn shall bring
Dance macabre 'neath the tilt of the zodiac
Now brighter stars shall reflect on our fate
What sick activities will be freed when those lights burn black
The darkside of the mirror always threw our malice back...
I see the serpentine in your eyes
The nature of the beast as revelations arrive
Our screams shall trail to Angels
For those damned in flames repay
All sinners lose their lot on Judgement Day
We should have cut our losses as at Calvary
But our hearts like heavy crosses held the vain belief
Salvation like a promised nation
Gleamed a claim away...
This is the end of everything you have ever known
Buried like vanquished reason
Death in season
Driven like the drifting snow
Peace a fragile lover left us fantasising war
On our knees or another fucker 's shore
Heiling new flesh
Read then roared
To a crooked cross and a Holy Cause
What else be whipped to frenzy for
This is the end of everything
Rear the tragedies
That the Seraphim shall sing
Old adversaries
Next of Eve
Now they 're clawing back
I smell their cumming
As through webbed panes of meat
Led by hoary Death
They never left
Dreaming sodomies
To impress on human failure
When we 've bled upon our knees
Tablatures of gravel law
Shall see Gehennag paved
When empires fall
And nightmares crawl
From the cradle to enslave...
This is the end of everything <start> Desde que me mim nasceste  Since you were born within
Naquela noite misteriosa  In that secretive night
No mais morreste  Never haven't withered
Na minha alma silenciosa...  Inside my mute soul...
In a single tear I weep over my entire life
And you angel who remains within
Lay bare my lost happiness
Just for one last moment as I'm towards the end...
My heart lies numb frozen
Out of utter bitterness
For the fire of passion burnt
In its sweet grave of loneliness
I'm the still darkness
I'm melancholy's ache
I'm the loneliness which cannot fill the void
I'm a cry of agony
I feel so lonely so blank
So cold so deaden
Locus Horrendus in a gloomy world
Flame far down from the deep hell
Meu ser habita na Noite e no Desejo.
Minha alma uma lembrana que h em mim.
All I ever wanted was a kiss
All I ever wanted was to draw out
A single teardrop from you
My whole being dwells
On the night and in desire...
My soul lives under the bewitching moon
I'm the still darkness
I'm melancholy's ache
I'm the loneliness which cannot fill the void
I'm a cry of agony
I'm the still darkness
I'm melancholy's ache
I'm the loneliness which cannot fill the void
I'm a cry of agony
My soul is bound to yours
I cannot tear myself away from you... <start> Welcome to my synagogue
Vagrants thieves and underdogs
Welcome inside Satan's church
Come and join the party
Here we wait for Lucifer
'cause tonight he will appear
In the form of a black goat
He will give us the power
Joy for all
No control
Free for all
Body and soul
In the night the bell will toll
Time of sex and rock'n'roll
Madmen sages virgins whores
All delight in the sabbath
In this pandemonium night
All together we'll unite
To praise the god that's not in the sky
The hidden lord of all freedom
Joy for all
No control
Free for all
Body and soul
Sabbath Sabbath Let the sabbath begin
Sabbath Sabbath Let the sabbath begin
We can't stop the scream of pain
Not a saint but just a man
We only try to live this life
With the power of magick
Joy for all
No control
Free for all
Body and soul
Sabbath Sabbath Let the sabbath begin
Sabbath Sabbath Let the sabbath begin
Sabbath Sabbath Let the sabbath begin
Sabbath Sabbath Let the sabbath begin <start> Violent J
I think it's funny how...the toughest criminals and thugs and whatever...
when they're on their death bed...
you know like the day before they fry in the electric chair...
all of a sudden they want to get religious.
I heard that  out of  inmates on death row are all ultra religious.
That's because they know they're about to die.
That they are about the meet whatever's after death.
It's funny...nobody wants to turn to god till it's too late.
Till it's time for you to fuckin' die
Violent J
Baggin me
Pain
Suffering
Bang Bang
Chains
Devices
Torture things
Is this hell
Might as well be
It's what's next and shit
I live life filthy
We sexed every bitch in the gutter
Then we rob or mudda
Find a shutta
And shoot fo or fo each otha
I blame it all on the people around me
It's because of them god never found me
Right 
Blaze Ya Dead Homie
Before I hit the ground
When I got three in the chest
I should've guessed my time was over
Should've worn the fucking vest
But I wasn't thinking straight
Caught up in the thug life
Was the king on the streets
Now I'm asking god to take my life
To the pearly gates
So I can rest peacefully
But he wasn't helping me
Why has he forsaken me
To eternity in hell
Left to rot in the grave
And if it wasn't for the Lotus
I'd still be there today
Chorus
Call upon your gods
Beg for them to help you
Call upon your gods
Religion has left you
Got a final hour
Cross the final line
Life will end
But there is no end to time
Call upon your gods
Beg for them to help you
Call upon your gods
Religion has left you
Got a final hour
Cross the final line
Life will end
But there is no end to time
Shaggy  Dope
Skin seperates from bone
Seperates from bone
One hot flash of metal
Now your on this earth alone
Laying face down in you're own blood
With nowhere to turn
Everything from your finger tips to toes burn
Heat sets skin deep
Open up your eyes
The cold clutch of death's hand
He could care less about your life
As Hell's Chariots come to carry you away
You finally realize
It's to late to pray
Monoxide Child
Help me out
I can't understand the way you think
Or what you're talking about
I see you sitting
Perfect circles
With disciples of Satan
I got my shotgun cocked
Newspapers and revelations
Every bullet is a story
They keep it glorified
The media's the target
And now they gots to die
Son of Sam
Sam of son
Buck you with my shotgun
Wicked work will be done
Fuck it catch a hot one
Chorus
Jamie Madrox
There ain't no end in time
You hear me hethan bitch boy
Bite your devil tongue
Before I stab you with this pitch fork
All that shit you talk about
My God is ashamed
Crying in pain
Calling his name
Your such a hypocrite
Low down inconsiderate
Piece of shit
And you ain't worth an ounce of spit
Blasphemous
Dissing my lord
And clocked out
Where's the tough guy
That told my God to go and fuck himself
Anybody Killa
I called apon my god
He told me which path to take
I just hope it's not another mistake
Confused by the things that I'm feeling
Guns that I carry hoes that I'm drilling
Tell me is this just another fucked situation
Calling on my God cause he's the cause of all creation
Never was told things would be like this
Always visioned that my life would be filled with happiness
What
Chorus
J Speaks in background <start> I am the constant comings and goings of my selves.
Some of them settling within some going on. Others sojourning indefinitely tuning in tuning out.
New attendants join  cynicism misanthropy indifference. Should I embrace them or have them exorcised
Oh this inevitable madness. Let it come. Transmute it by enduring it.
Let sorrow in. It will leave eventually. Otherwise it will stay knocking on your door forevermore.
Are you possessed still Yes Then what about now Possessed still Are you addicted still Yes Then what about now Addicted still
My hour of sanity. The unpredictable.
I meant to lead you away from madness but that's exactly what drove you out of your mind. <start> Just as I've learned your ways you've gone and changed again
A constant evolution I don't know where to begin
I invest my time but it's no use
Twenty years gone by and I'm still confused
I spend the hours lost
Trying to find you in a nameless crowd
Pistol whipped by this quest for perfection
Robbed of my joy
It's hard to continue on
But it's harder to stop right now
Myself  a sacrifice to you and all your parts
Till death do us part <start> Through imperial halls of ice
Where I left bloodstained pillars
Resplendent seem these silver walls
Silent phantoms I burn
Towards the emptiness
Towards the gorge
Onwards onwards to hell to hell
I was the could through which angels fell
Onwards onwards to hell to hell
I was torture death and fatal spell
Onwards through another vortex of colors
To hell where I left devouring darkness
Onwards opaque visions I haunt
To hell impervious seem these delusive lights
My journey begun
As you unveiled my face
As I ripped of my skin
And my demon was roused
Thrones and dominions mean nothing to me
As long as I seek the truth
Thus I break man and ice
On my journey towards beyond <start> 
dads abusing newborn blood prayers
from a priest in heat a piece
of body cut alive sold out for
the highest price
a god dethroned is fucking blind
stupid people fucked up minds
evolution
prostitution of the world
evolution
disillusion of us all
weapons kill your loves and lives
triggers pulled by children's eyes
politicians sell their souls
promise shelter raping minds
feels like violate the dead
shoot the bullet in your head
evolution...
getting obscene on the dead feel desire
for young flesh watch your bloody
lieing screen sacrificed for satans dreams
want to absolute your sins
just kneel down and suck my skin
evolution... <start> I'm not insane
That's how it seems though
Spiteful cruel but wise
Beyond his age
My body fails
My soul will rise
The end of life's immortalized disease and agony
And I see death through golden eyes
Beyond the door
There's something more
It seems there's just one way
On through the heat
I've felt the touch of evil
I still feel the icy claw in me
For a decent price
I've banned kindness from my heart
The spirit of all truth and beauty
Pawned for my desire
And from the flames
As chance would have it
The soulforged will come into light
And from the flames as chance would have it
The soulforged
The stainless will rise
I will never change my mind
I will leave it all behind
And through the hour glass
Everything's grey
Everyone's pale
No colour nor beauty will enlighten my heart
The seat of life's empty and cold
Cadaverous you all seem to me
Stillborn but you're still alive
You're still alive
Truth lies in loneliness
When hope is long gone by
I'll wipe out the bliss of the new age
And welcome you precious night
And from the flames
As chance would have it
The soulforged will come into light
And from the flames as chance would have it
The soulforged
The stainless will rise
From a distant time
Voices echo in the hall
Come and join us
Enter life and everything is gone now
And through the looking glass
I still fear mortality and its loss in the end
Unlimited power in my hands
The claw of the dragon ascends
Mourn for his lost soul
He's cursed and condemned
Each step I take
May it hurt may it ache
Leads me further
Away from the past
But as long as I breathe
Each smile in my bleak face
I'm on my way to find
Back to the peace of mind
And from the flames
As chance would have it
The soulforged will come into light
And from the flames as chance would have it
The soulforged
The stainless will rise
I will never change my mind
I will leave it all behind <start> I see love and I see hate
I see pleasure and I see disdain
I see hypocrisy and sincerity
I see famine and gluttony
And I will never be never be blind
I see torture and I see cure
I see patients and freaks very cool
I see mockery and sympathy
I see greed and I see modesty
And I will never be never be blind
I see yesterday and I see today
I see sunlight and I see dark night
I see meanness and generosity
I see misery and luxury <start> One more dead soul there's a hole in the sky
Illuminating dream quest the prophet's eye
By virtue of madness a sign of faith
Lurking at the threshold you're lost
Between the gates
Death's a solution to life's dead illusions
Stranger aeons stained by recreation
Stranger aeons of hallucination
Stranger things that eternal lie
Awaiting beyond the time to die
In the city of gods in the temple of lies

Plains of otherness
The utter emptiness
Where time have ceased and dark and light collide
Crossing the river of death and water cold
Slowly walking up the bridge
The jeweled bridge I walk for what seems a lifetime
In the night it's jewels glow
There on the other side
On shore of no return
The one for me awaits
Cannot avoid the eyes
In which the fire burns
Comed this far it is too late
And He calls my name
First a whispering then louder
And he wants me to follow
And to Enter the Eternal Fire
I walk this endless night
His eyes the only light
Repeatedly he whispers my name
Fingers move and twist
Through crimson thick dark mist and voices cry of agony and pain
Close now to his kingdom
The bleak world dark and still
I follow the voice whispering my name
Approach the gate of sin
Opened up to let me in and there He stand in flames
The price now I must pay for eternity my soul his claim
For years of pleasures victory and gold
The one who stand in flames
Now rise and walk my way and reach out for my soul
And He calls my name
First a whispering then louder
And he wants me to follow
And to fall down. The Eternal Fire <start> Oh my God what are these
You can hear people puking They're dog meat
In caustic butchery I parent my dominion
In the food chain I Incomprehensible the missing link
Cold temerity confects this splintered for age
Infantile corruption taken to the brink
Making hash of the spumous crubescent
All compassion removed
Newly fully developed boiled as sprouted fodder
Marti linear murder cordon bleu
As salubrious pet food
Human midden is consumed
And I want to mince my words
But now I love to see those churned
In tins they are reared
Ghastly I slake
Bestial appetites to sate
As flesh and steel I mate
To fill the lower species' plate
Des parental primparal goods oozing
The bawling squabbling denied the suckling teat
Sentient bloodletting sprains the sporulate
Makes a choice chimerical treat
Rheological twisted nursery chymes
The fluxing of the defleshed
Paedophilosophical carnage knowledge
As the illegitimeat to the domesticated is fed
So as you breed
They will bleed

Motherfucking torture <start> Sitting under a pine
The deep silence... unbroken around
One dark lake
So placid so cold...
Descended night
Throws shadows over water
Brown leaves fly
Autumn is turning into winter
What happens around me
It has no meaning...
I sleep in my woe
This is not my world...
For my world lies
Beyond other's reach
Shadows dancing  my throne
My dreams' winterland I behold
Through the gates of time unseen
In a silent night
Somewhere deep inside
In the darkest woods
In the darkest nights
Lies my ancient realm
Where are still places
For me to find
Shadows dancing  my throne
My dreams' winterland I behold
Through the gates of time unseen

I'm never taking back a single word I said.
I never meant it.
I never felt it.
I've never takin' back a single word I've said.
I'll never take it back now.
I never meant it.
I'm never takin' back a single word I said. <start> instrumental <start> Again and again and again
You bring me to ecstasy
You have died but I don't care
Burial place is not your true relief
Fistfucks in your backdoor hole
Necropenetrating lust takes command
Path of sin  sin
Create the sin  sin
In darknes we'll always be together
Forever your body belongs to me
Wrapped in pleasure we will burn
In eternity we shall be reborn
Path of sin  sin
Create the sin  sin
Die Sonne schied noch ehe es Abend wurde
Tanzwut und Totengesnge
Der Sabbath des Blutes  des Blutes
 <start> Time What is time
The tale of pain and death the moments of our lives
Pain never dies
You only suffer more when death stares into your eyes
Wounds never heal
The scars are there to stay the memory remains
Lost never found
Your soul is let astray when your body fades away
Never the same again Scarred by the years of pain
Never the fool again Scarred by the years of pain
To be dead is to always live in their memories
And walk alone on a path of grief
To be dead is to always scream at the silence
Forever trapped in a place of pain
Pain what is pain
The tales are the pain. The moments never die
Dead are the lies
The truth is here to stay. As the liars fades away
Lost never found
Their souls are led astray. Their words to be slain
Pain never dies
You only suffer more when death stares into your eyes <start> Silenced in the roar of the flames.
After the screams of the dying nothing remains.
Desecrated slashed burned to
The ground. In the frenzy of greed cries of protest are drowned.
The Earth dies  Ecocide. The Earth's forests laid forever
To waste. Thoughts of the future trampled in their haste.
Corporations with their dollar sign focus ravage the Amazon like a
Plague of locusts. Plumes of black smoke ascend into the sky.
A forest of beautiful creatures senselessly die. Smoking fields
Of devastation left in mankind's wake.
With populations left to grow and greed
They justify this rape.
The power of the dollar can't take precedence
Over the inevitable detrimental consequence.
The time to react is long overdue from protest to
Confrontation by me and by you. <start> Smiling as he speaks of death
destroying lives unknown
Killing 'til his final breath
Protecting his fallen throne
March of the chamber of gas
The line to end their lives
As they die he starts to laugh
Last thing heard are cries
We have fought together side by side
Killing humans as they die
Burning souls once filled with life
Now they're filled with pain and strife
Prisoner of one man's hate
Now facing their final day
Try to reach their wired gate
Who has their god saved
Running from the brightened light
Shots fired as comrades fall
Without guns they cannot fight
Death for one and all
They storm the gates on hopes to be free
Many trampled in the frenzied flee
Many fall as machine guns roar
See yourself but now as a bloody corpse
Escape for you is nothing but a dream
The bullets rip your flesh as you scream
Your final breath is spent on cursed cries
The tortured lives of Hitler take to the sky
Is violence the way to get a point across
If you don't get your way it's your own loss
Don't try to force people to see your way
You shoot people down someday you'll pay
A large racial barrier when will it break
Blacks aren't dumb whites made the mistake
Like to kill them but they wouldn't dare
They'll shoot back what's fair is fair <start> The sound of flowing waters
will wash away my impure thougths
Paintings of saints are burning
A thousand times I join my hands
Evil forces outside
The holy prophecy
But I've broken all my promises
I've found the inner me
Process of annihilation
Another human being
reborn in the regression
for a newer purity
Burning will of skin
Crawling ecstacy
Libido possession
Sane morbidity
Flesh to satisfy my hunger
Eager for sin
So I deny the rules
I forget all your prayers
I've worshipped all the things that today I reject
Following my own path
Raising my soul and feeding my anger <start> cry wake the sleeping lie
pray I'm always there for you
beware of you
die agony inside
pray the rain will fall on you
it's all for you
will I punish your heaven
will I be there to go with you
will I bury the raven
and will I stand to watch you burn
say will we dive in the water
say will I die in your water
say will I cry for this moment to live
say will I cry for the water
cry swear to walk in line
pay the ones who steal your heart
in dreams apart
die melodies all mine
prey the dawn will be your guard
so free to start
will I punish your heaven
will I be there to go with you
will I bury the raven
and will I stand to watch you burn
say will we dive in the water
say will I die in your water
say will I cry for this moment to live
say will I cry for the water <start> Hear me the Antichrist is coming
He who opened his mouth in blasphemy
Against God and His Tabernacle
And those that dwell in the Heavens
He denies the Father and the Son
He refutes that Jesus is the Christ
And it was given unto him
To make war with the saints
And to overcome them all power was given over
All kindreds and tongues and nations
I am an idea I exist
Live and breathe I am real
Call it a moment of inspiration
That allowed my existence
I am a raw and terrible God
I am Antichrist
Sticky white bile
Smeared and splattered
Around gray lipped mouths
Heavy death that rapidly decays
The rich and the poor
The rich and the poor
We are all the same in death
The unmistakable fragrance
Of rigid decomposition exacts no distinction <start> Wake up on fire every day
And I never say goodbye
Predetermined destiny
I've never been afraid to die
Ever since i was a kid
I've seen things my own way with my own eyes
With my hands i turn the screws
In my life i decide
you're bent on under the will of endless dogmatic restraints
I will rage against the machine spewing out blind faith
Think about an end you can live with
Think about an end i can give you
Think about an end that would satisfy
The only thing that's touched my soul
Ever in my life of love
Tangible and Physical visible
Unlike your god above
Where is all the mercy on which your faith has been built
All i see is hatred caused by years of inbred guilt
Resurrecting genuflecting killing in the name
You disavow the right to choose
Its medievally insane
Your god is dead or doesn't care
Tell me which ones worse
An uncaring god or knowing that your alone on this earth <start> Stefan Hertrich VocalsGuitar

Do you feel my coldness It is my way
If you call my name it is my way
Follow me on my way
Into our eternity
Of emotions and thoughts
Close your eyes for my way
Open your soul for my way
Give me your thoughts for my way
Trust lies mistrust truth
Hear silence see the night
Follow me tracks of history
Into the light of space and time
Obey my way and be silent
Listen to my voice it is my way
Feel my coldness it is my way
Call my name it is my way
Hearing feeling and seeing
That is my way I am your way <start> Her memories suffer the kind of death
that's loud enough to wake the dead
Her memories suffer a thousand torments
because of what was unsaid
She walks around a lifeless form
I can tell it's in her eyes
Dissect a living ghost
I swear takes more than a scalpel knife
Standing in the darkness there's a light
Waiting for waiting for another form of life
She forgets her memories tonight
Waiting for waiting for a chance to live her life
Somebody somebody help her help
Tormented alone drowning inside buried by sand
Tormented alone choking back tears at a loss for what she had
Blank stare into nowhere
I swear it's unlikely she'll be revived
Dissect a living ghost
I swear it takes more than a scalpel knife
Standing in the darkness there's a light
Waiting for waiting for another form of life
She forgets her memories tonight
Waiting for waiting for a chance to live her life
She lies there in tranquility forever
She's now a memory
She lies there in tranquility forever
She's now a memory
She lies there in tranquility forever
She's now a memory
Standing in the darkness there's a light
Waiting for waiting for another form of life
She forgets her memories tonight
Waiting for waiting for a chance to live her life
Somebody somebody help her help
Somebody somebody help her help <start> Brain washing a population
Trapped in a dream
insidious machines
Dictate reality
Evolution placed on hold
Degeneration overload
Mentally decayed the brain withers away
Annihilating a population plagued by ignorance
the military stands by
fire fills the sky
all you had to do was look
alittle common sense it took
the signs were plain to see
future catastrophe
Think for yourself
Defy ignorance
Think for yourself
Escape
Think for yourself
Defying disgrace
Think for yourself
Defy Death

Destroying the mind Entertaining Disguise
surgical tools cut through the brain

innocence is no excuse
data stored for future use. <start> Take the bullet between my mandibles
It's the path I chose
Took life and I grabbed the balls
I rose like an animal
And the jungle taught me to handle foes
To all y'all mother Fers
Heffers and half steppers
The best of us is yet to come
So y'all ain't seen the last of us
I am that kid that nobody ever gave a fuck about
Curse words and the worst words
Were the first words coming out my mouth
We started out we had nothing to lose
I never had an option
So there was nothing to choose
It was all about turning
Food stamps into cash
Buy some dipsey doodles
With a food stamp
Get  cents back
What you know about that now
In my darkest hour it seems that I can't make it
I find the strength within to know that I can take it
Finger on the trigger you know you better pull it
Barrel in my mouth I learned to bite the bullet.
I'm right here
Its right now
Finger on the trigger
Barrel in my mouth <start> Lead vocals Eduardo Marques

copyright  <start> All those things that I tried to be
While wandering further from me
I'd choked myself in my apathy
Until I no longer could breathe
My heart and my hand always reaching
Without you within I was searching
For something real
The fear followed me
And tightly closed my eyes
The pain crippled me
And buried deep the will to even try
To see so much standing before me
And think there was nothing here for me
How much more wrong could I be
How much more wrong
The warmth of life had forgotten me
And left me so cold and alone
But you covered me and placed into me
A feeling like none I had known
My heart and my hand I have traded
With you in my arms I am closer
To something real
The fear followed me
And tightly closed my eyes
The pain crippled me
And buried deep the will to even try
To see so much standing before me
And think there was nothing here for me
How much more wrong could I be
How much more wrong could I be
My heart and my hand I have traded
With you in my arms I am closer
To something real
To see so much standing before me
And think there was nothing here for me
How much more wrong could I be
How much more wrong could I be <start> En lo que digo nadie se engaa
Nos libramos del vencido
Todos barremos con saa
A los dolos cados
No sers siempre el primero
la humana limitacin
Cambia a capricho al puntero
de toda competicin
Olfateamos muchas cosas
entre prisas diariamente
Son verdades deliciosas
y verdades pestilentes.
Nadie da nada de balde sabelo.
El candor ultimamente esta muy bravo
Aunque la verdad escalde
sobran cadenas y esclavos
Libertad y sus vestigios
Mas vale ponerse a salvo
Muchos calzan gorro frigio
Solamente por ser calvos
Cubre el cuerpo cualquier capa
El placer tambin demacra
Todo ser busca una tapa
Cuada cual cubre su lacra.
Cada cual su lacra oculta.
Aunque en virtudes abunde
y se juzgue inobjetable
Cuando el humano se hunde
Siempre busca un responsable
A menudo nos engaan
Escondidas apetencias
La culpa ajena es barata
Regalarla no nos cuesta nada nos cuesta
La hipocresa propasa
Todo ejemplo en esta tierra.
Al asesinato en masa
los hombres lo llaman guerra. <start> .
Schroffe Felsen ragen hoch der dunkle Wald steht still
Die Abendnebel senken sich herab
Weie Schwaden wogen durch zerklftets Gesteinsmassiv
's ist alles trostlos grausig wie ein Grab
.
Furchtsam reitet Christenvolk den Weg hinab zur festen Burg
Sie suchen Schutz bei ihrem Christengott
Ein Eichenhain ward abgebrannt so ist ihr Tagwerk wohl getan
Nun frchten sie der Heiden Rache... Tod
.
Und finster wird's nun zu der Nacht der Stahl harrt fest in jeder Hand
Der Sturm bricht los mit lautem Donnerschlag
Die Christen wappnen sich geschwinden ein wildes Kmpen hebt nun an
Und keiner soll mehr seh'n den nchsten Tag
.
Der Nebel dmpft den Schlachtenlrm die Nacht hllt gtig ein
Den Anblick der Erschlag'nen und des Bluts
Die Christen haben nun den Preis bezahlt und leise raunt der Wind
... Von dem Gemetzel in der Felsenschlucht <start> If you get to know
The deepest feeling
You'll know well what pain means
When it's about real
Inner suffering
That bothers you 'til you're down on
your knees
It hurts to lose someone
But on the day of reckoning
I'll be right if the fire lives on in me
The one who gives me faith
I'm gonna get power
I'm gonna get a friend inside
The one who helps me
To find the right way
The one who surely stands on my side
Beside him in the night
Thousands of souls
Are shining bright
So I cry up to the sky
I cry up to the sky
You lead me
Oh so far away
Hand in hand entwined
But the road
Came to an end for me
All that dwells in the present time
Overhead
From the distant sky
I hear you quiet I see you light
I can go no farther
Just walk alone
To the place where silence borns
Big companion
Yet big solitude
And sorrow is yet more and more
Everything disappears slowly
Wellknown faces are greeting me
As I reach the end of my road
At the gates of another world
At the gates of another world <start> In the brain we've found a role
Detach your life from mind control
Evade life of being ruled
DESTROY
the parts that lie unused
Permanence

HATE PURE PURE ANSWER
NOONE EVER AGAIN PURE

Is a directive
Brain found to be
Grossly defective

Sees through the eyes

You need it like a hole in the head <start> Musica Eddy Antonini e Roberto Potenti
Testi Eddy Antonini
Angels cry demons die
black night comes above my room.
Trying to find a feeling blind
an helping hand to drive my doom.
An iced tear a little fear
a lonely heart that beats inside.
A simple pray a mortal race
to win this love to save my pride.
This time I have to remember the meaning of the truth
searching for a shelter where hide my love for you
but looking at the mirror I can only see your face
I'm captured by the darkness while you are walking away.
I'd give my life to find you
to meet and touch your heart
coming out from darkness
but Destiny might tear us apart
I'm dreaming now I hold you
and kiss your lips goodnight
staring at the sweetest
things you've got... <start> Lyrics  Music  Andrea Cipolla
In the Necroromantic's dungeon
there's his display of flesh piles
experimental compositions of body pieces.
There are strong meathooks for his visionary works
a gallery of insane genetic crossbreeding
a gallery underestimated by the great art critics.
Finding corpses is very easy
when you work in the morgue you always get fresh meat.
Mutilation and defilement of cold stiffs
A perfect job for the Necroromantic <start> I look around and all I see is evil
Walking dead disguised as real people
It's kill or be killed 'cause life is not forever
It comes apart and then it falls together
I am what you made me
'Til death do I part
It's the world I've grown to know
Unforgiving and so cold
Take it away
Take it away
I don't want it
It's a life I'm forced to live
I've got nothing more to give
Take it away
Take it away
I don't want it anymore
We're generation dead
We're dead
You see yourself as such a fucking shepherd
But you drift the blind and then you curse the leper
Do you really want my true opinion
You've taken more than you've ever given
You are what you are
Until death do you part
It's the world I've grown to know
Unforgiving and so cold
Take it away
Take it away
I don't want it
It's a life I'm forced to live
I've got nothing more to give
Take it away
Take it away
I don't want it anymore
Generation dead
It's the world I've grown to know
Unforgiving and so cold
Take it away
Take it away
I don't want it
It's a life I'm forced to live
I've got nothing more to give
Take it away
Take it away
I don't want it anymore
It's the world I've grown to know
Unforgiving and so cold
Take it away
Take it away
I don't want it
It's a life I'm forced to live
I've got nothing more to give
Take it away
Take it away
I don't want it anymore
We're generation dead
We're dead <start> What I have in me
In the mind is you

What I'm feeling now
What I'm heading into


All I have is you
It is all that I'm waiting for
All I need is you

All the nights I've prayed
Must this all be untrue

I just can't believe I am losing you



All I have is you
It is all that I'm waiting for
All I need is you

I am losing you forever

I am leaving ground forever

Distant so far destiny is selecting me
I can't be strong life is disconnecting me
Now loneliness infecting me
Gone are the days you were there protecting me
So cold 
All I have is you
It is all that I'm waiting for
All I need is you

I am losing you forever

I am leaving ground forever 
All I have is you 
All I need is you 
It is all that I'm waiting for

 <start> I've just returned from a long round trip
Many tales I have to tell.
Now I don't get high
so you think I'm not hip
But I've seen the gates of Hell.
How can a youth rise above all the shit
When surrounded
by such lousy influence
He clutched his pipe took his last hit
And nobody's heard from him since.
Chorus
In this world of confusion
Drugs were my solution
The pain was breaking my heart.
I shut out my reality
Nearing my fatality
found myself falling apart.
Miserable horrible life such an obstacle
Making my own matters worse.
To end up dead in a dark alleyway
Or to ride in the back of a hearse.
To die for a cause like pride or respect
Or honor would make you quite worthy
A pitiful waste to live in the sewer
And die before you reach thirty.
Chorus 
Cop a bag as a crutch
copping out lose so much
Hangin' out dippin' butts
Lost my mind smoking dust
There and back
Back in the days I was living a lie
Too cool to show my feelings
too cool to cry
Lost in a fog and unsure of my friends
With a one way ticket
headed strait for the end
As the flames burnt the rope
and my spirit cut loose
I found my self wrapped
in an emotional noose
I said to myself continue no longer
Today I face the world with a mind
that is stronger
Spent my time gettin' nice
I crapped out rolling dice
Look at me and my scars
Now I live pure and hard
There and back  <start> Premonitions sadistic murder visions
My future is written in your blood
Excruciating intoxicating
Pain and pleasure mix as death unfolds
I tear your soul apart
Revel in your death
Release you from agony
Exhale your last breath
Watch the gleaming blade as I raise it above my head
And stab it in your racing heart
Let death remove the pain your misery and dismay
The failures and downfalls in your life
Fall down on your knees so we can proceed
With our hate ritual
Your torment will end as your life fades away
And travel to the darkside
The lust for your demise
Implanted in my mind
I cannot rest
Until you are dead
No human emotions
Regret or guilt
Prepare to die
I'm fucking possessed
Lead Sahlgren
Slice you up and remove the organs
Shit and vomit 'til you are full
A bloated corpse filled with vile contents
Pound on you 'til you burst
Trophy collector headhunter mentality
Figures crafted in your flesh
Twisted romance I really love you
Not for what you are but what you shall become <start> Dogs of war are haunting the human flesh
That's not hell that's the paradise
Adrenaline and instincts take the lead
The beast awakes
Sucking all my hate
Terminate wrath
Sucking all my hate
Terminate wrath
The bullets rip through the enemies
Terminate wrath
Dead bodies cover shattered ground
Terminate wrath
Now die you fucking coward
I'll send you to your gods
Your bones are crushed into pieces
And now you get what you deserve
Can you hear the screams for mercy
Sweet music in your ears
Can you smell the stench of napalm
This is your chance to kill
In times of war death is the healing
Now feel the rage and make your stand
Bloodthirst and the lust to kill
Now surrender the beast in you
You sow the death and harvest flesh
Unchain your rage
They call me insane and murderer
I call them prey and hunt them down
Like the wolf among the sheeps
A god among men
Sucking all my hate
Terminate wrath
Sucking all my hate
Terminate wrath
The bullets rip through the enemies
Terminate wrath
Dead bodies cover shattered ground
Terminate wrath
Now die you fucking coward
I'll send you to your gods
Your bones are crushed into pieces
And now you get what you deserve
Can you hear the screams for mercy
Sweet music in your ears
Can you smell the stench of napalm
This is your chance to kill
In times of war death is the healing
Now feel the rage and make your stand
Riot...
Can you hear the screams for mercy
Sweet music in your ears
Can you smell the stench of napalm
This is your chance to kill
In times of war death is the healing

I can take you anywhere
Just call on me and I'll be there
Follow me
And I will guarantee
Your life will never be the same
Hear me callin' won't you follow me
Will you follow me into the fight
You smile as you die when you're close to the light
Your dreams will be lost in the haze
Your innocence dying in so many ways
Where do we go from here
Leaving our dreams far behind
To fight the final fight
Hey you
I'll make your dreams come true
I can take you anywhere
Just call on me and I'll be there
Follow me
Satisfaction guaranteed
We'll be in perfect harmony
So follow me follow me
Where do we go from here
Reaching our destiny's end
And nothing will remain
Follow me
To the land of make believe
Close your eyes I will be there
And I can take you anywhere

At the gates of paradise
It's a world full of illusions
By the masters of confusion follow me...
Will you still follow me... <start> Music and Lyrics by Leif EdlingCANDLEMASS
Published by Active records.
Original version available on CANDLEMASS' Ancient DreamsLpCd .
Reach deep within where reality is hard to find
Search in the corners of the winding mazes of your mind
Seek out the treasures that open doors that some keep sealed
Believe in your dreams and a wonderworld will be revealed
Come to the boundless land somewhere inside your fantasies
Built by dreams and magic the secret place that none have seen
Chase the horizons catch the illusion
Remember the child within
There's no tomorrow just sadness and sorrow
Hold on to the Ancient Dreams
Great kings and tyrants unicorns and elflords
Devils and demons dungeons and dragons
Phoenix is rising up from the ashes of the wind
Born into glory then back to ashes once again
High flies the dragon the ruler of the seven skies
Riding the winds not knowing that he just can't die
See how the wizard cast his spell with maddened eyes
Using his magic to reach the heavenly skies
Witness the alchemist turning all his lead to gold
Try after try begging that his fantasy will hold
See how the rainbow bends it shape into the sea
Follow the sign and your dreams will be reality <start> Arise arise and face the day head on
These shattered wings still trying to heal heal
So I slip into another skin erasing forward progression
And stumbling across these boundaries again
Well is it me or have I been dissolved
Infect infected with the world's disease
Still singing to the insect song
So I endure at what a cost put a price on my sanity
So hard to find body and mind
Both of which consumed by slow decay
What I need is so elusive
Antidote for the incurable
Living in fear of what the future brings
The future brings
Inject it into my life the cure for this heartache
Inject it into my life a moment of clarity
Inject it into my life the reason to live one more day
My will is fading
Can you feel it As the day now turns to night
I can feel my wounds begin to mend
I must preserve my strength
'Cause with the dawn they come again they come again
Can you feel it So I slip into another skin
Erasing forward progression and stumbling on these boundaries again
Is it me or have I been dissolved like the sun in my night
Vicious circles burning up inside feel the pressure of falling apart
Energize reassure my life
What I need is so elusive
Antidote for the incurable
Living in fear of what the future brings
The future brings
Inject it into my life the cure for this heartache
Inject it into my life a moment of clarity
Inject it into my life the reason to live one more day
My will is fading
Fading <start> City of screaming statues
Your soul will grow to understand and respect this place
It will be with your in your heart on your journey
The gates of city lies before you
The temple of truth whispering their waves
Chase your visions slay your fears
What moves the truth is the sound of your thoughts
Scream
The struggle of the soul
Depends on the strength of your will
Among the twisted shapes of your madness
You will find your light and your genius
In the city where the statues they scream
For their truth to be real
The dreams and the visions
The reality and the light
Within the soul of the city
May be whatever you wish it to be
In the city where the statues they scream
For their truth to be real
Stand up and turn your back on reality
Lie down and let your dreams attack
The silence of a soul that is true
Is the silence that you lack
Feel the strength pulsating through you
As the gates they close behind you
The answers lie within the city
Within the light
In the sunrise of your soul time is the key
The music of the truth now behold
Rise and crush them
The gates of city lies before you
The temple of truth whispering their waves
Chase your visions slay your fears
What moves the truth is the sound of your thoughts
The statues they scream
For their truth to be real
Within the walls of the city
Where death ain't the end
The music of the truth the light of the end <start> Awaiting my last breath
The mirror calls my name
It's showing me the way
Into the dark
The bridge appears
I jump into the dark side
And hear the voice it's cold as ice
Welcome to reality
Where am I now
Darkness surrounds
Can't go forward
Can't go back
I see planets dying
I fall into the light
A new universe awakes
I'm a Traveler in Time
Pray for the light
Where's the key
To the gate
Of a new life  no
I search for deliverance
But I cannot find
Chorus
Look behind the mirror
I'm lost in the twilight hall
Once I'll be back for a moment in time
That's when the mirror's falling down
Take me away
From the place I've been
To another life
In another world
A sign of life
Surrounds me now
The bridge appears in the dark
I'm free
I fly alone
Leaving the darkness now forever
The memories of children
And the wisdom of many lifes
Burns deep in me
Where will the light go to
Where will the light go to
Is this deliverance
Is it the end
Chorus
I'm back there's a new chance for me
And all my memories are gone
I can feel what's happening to me
And the mirrow will burst
Chorus x <start> Stay

I'm dreaming that you are gonna leave me

What will I do without you

Stay <start> This house is divided
This house divided against itself can never stand
It takes a new beginning to kill a bitter end
Sing another sad sad song for the summer time
Scream another sad sad summer song
Divided this house will fall
Bad idea I know
Bet think I will
Bad idea I know
You could never look me in the eye
And feel good about where you stand as a man
You could never stand alone
given where you stand as a man
This house divided against itself can never stand
It takes a new beginning to kill a bitter end
Left me at the last
Good idea you thought
Left to hang myself
Bad idea I know
You could never look me in the eye
And feel good about where you stand as a man
This house divided against itself can never stand
It takes a new beginning to kill a bitter end
Sing another sad sad song for the summer time
Scream another sad sad summer song
For the summer time
This house will never stand
You could never look me in the eye
You could never look me in the eye
This house divided against itself can never stand
It takes a new beginning to kill a bitter end
Sing another sad sad song for the summer time
Scream another sad sad summer song
Scream another sad sad sad song for the summer for the summer time <start> You know you got my mones all buzzin' babe
Just thinking about your lovin babe

Girl I can't seem to get you of my mind
Got thoughts workin overtime

You feed me the love my soul needs to survive
All I need right now babe...
Just a little more time with you
Wanna make love with you
You'll never know just how I feel
Till I show this love's for real
Just a little more time with you
Let me get you in the mood
'cause I'll leave you in no doubt
That it's me you can't do without
Just a little more time without you...
What we've got is sweet as honey babe
We don't need nothin' babe

I take the blame for what you've been going through
For being such a fool to you

Sometimes as a man we all make the same mistakes
I just hope it's not too late...
Just a little more time with you
Wanna make love with you
You'll never know just how I feel
Till I show this love's for real
Just a little more time with you
Let me get you in the mood
'cause I'll leave you in no doubt
That it's me you can't do without
Just a little more time without you...
You're the only thing that I've ever craved
Only thing only thing
So I'm asking you
Please don't take it away
Not this time
Tell mewhat to do to prove my love for you
Gonna prove my love to you babe
Even if you asked me to fly
I would fly...
Just a little more time with you
Wanna make love with you
You'll never know just how I feel
Till I show this love's for real
Just a little more time with you
Let me get you in the mood
'cause I'll leave you in no doubt
That it's me you can't do without
Just a little more time without you... <start> Two points opposing in negative space

And who's sucked into the black whole
Is it possible light is cast by evil
What's accepted is thedownfall
In darkness we are breeding the revolution

Of superficial expectations
Values displayed for denigration
Inside ourselves we're all beautiful
Fuck the image
Of indifference
Fuck perfection
Of senseless fashion
This is my anamnesis
I am recalling my existence
If our values can be so easily discarded
For the uniformity we are not
Why the fuck should we live up to impress
We shan't be made to feel worthless <start> Oh You wonderful people
I need you all today
I reveal myself to you
If that is okay
In my minds eye I see people they are not free
In my world I'm living in I feel no harmony...
Started out  raised a little family
I was happy for a while
Sadness struck I realised eventually
You're the family that makes me smile
I need You  You need us.
Together we break free
There's no other way to go
To feel the federaly
Listen people I had a vision
Help me before I go paranoid
Search your souls  help me in this descision
A total Destruction of the Void
My heart is an unfinished galaxy of dreams
Before I go I want to know just what this life means <start> It's a world that won't let you feel
You grow up very fast in sorrow
The drinking damage a parent provokes
Can ruin a child's tomorrow
No no no no do you feel you're abused
By a bottle of liquor
The alcohol will cause the fall
State of control
It never wants to let you go
State of control
Like chains around your body and soul
There's no support they don't care at all
You're lonely cause you feel abandoned
But there's a way
To heal the pain
With God again and again
You know I know
Keeping secrets from your friends
That your mothers sick
It's like I said being drunk is dead
State of control
It never wants to let you go
State of control
Like chains around your body and soul
And the soul of your children
You feel like you've always been walked on
And frankly I don't blame you a bit
I see your unhappiness and I say
No no no no
State of control
It never wants to let you go
State of control
Like chains around your body and soul <start> Somewhere in desert of the void
Beyond the wall
We're the last survivors
We're the ones who'll never fall
Men inside the circle leave the night
Darkness all around us
Not a single beam of light
We all have is our faith
No will to win this fight
The time has come to break the outer wall

Grab your heart I'll show you the way
Now hold your head up high
High above at the edge of the world
We're searching for glory and peace
When the time has come you will see
Our return to the land of the free
Men inside the circle
Tell me what you feel and see
Delusions of reality
The mirror of your dreams
Hold your ground
And I'll show you the way
Now hold your head up high
High above at the edge of the world
We're searching for glory and peace
When the time has come you will see
Our return to the land of the free

And as the sunlight appears again in our sky
No wall no more no more will darken our life

I transmit the fatness over wackness
with my Campbell blunts and matches
Other rappers try to catch this
but I roast em up for practice
So act like you knew or you'll be through in your division
I've been waiting and watching for you to fuck up your position
Man listen isn't this shit for niggaz asses
Like when I flip the script pause and flick my Philly ashes
Yup that's the status of the rappers with the cabbage
Other crews can act savage but they all fall below average
My headnaps is massive and I'm Evil like Kenivel
And I'm diesel for the sequel I'ma freak it for my people
To Gods like Bill Cos represent One Love like Nas
Thinkers rap is my job Tame the Terror drops the bomb
on the move fakers
Now I'm stable makin papers
Ain't gon be no motherfuckers stealing bread from off my table
if I'm able
To feed those who need then proceed
But for those out for greed take heed and get these

INSTRUMENTAL <start> No beautiful surface without a terrible depth
You ripped my heart out I wish I was dead
I cannot tame my demons forevermore
You are the reason I should have known before
Because of you I've lost it all
Seems like all we had is over now
Because of you I rise to fall
But in the end it's over now...
Are you still my anchor
Cause you're dragging me down
I'm lost in the ocean call the sirens before I drown
I will leave with my head down
I've lost it all it's all the same now...
It's all the same
Because of you I've lost it all
Seems like all we had is over now
Because of you I rise to fall
But in the end it's over now...
I'm cold I'm lost I'm wrong I'm numb
I'm flawed I'm sick I'm tired I'm done
I'm useless broken scared can't run away
Because of you I've lost it all
Seems like all we had is over now
Because of you I rise to fall
But in the end it's over now...

And hold on for a rough ride
So hungry for what I seek

And to the republic for which it stands
One nation indivisible

It's a production of fear
Take another look isn't it clear
It's all so sadistic annihilistic it's so fucking vicious
It's getting harder to feel for all the people I kill
No time to cry for those who died
They stay unjustified
Through these eyes I see the catastrophe lying in my wake
Voices inside my mind shiver my spine
I am not ashamed
Look at me I'm a dead man walking
Put another nail in the coffin
On the hill I see the bodies burning
Burn it down
Looking back at the fields all the blood that I've spilt
There's no emotion just destruction of another person
Look at the blood on my hands
I feel no pain in my heart
Take a paxil take a xanax
It won't erase the memories
Through these eyes I have seen such misery
I am not afraid
And if I should die tonight that would be just fine
Lay me in my grave
Look at me I'm a dead man walking
Put another nail in the coffin
On a hill I see the bodies burning
Burn it down
Burn it down
Burn it down
Burn it down

So superficial so superficial
So superficial so superficial <start> The wild boys are calling on their way back from the fire
In August moon's surrender to a dust cloud on the rise
Wild boys fallen far from glory
Reckless and so hungered on the razors edge you trail
Because there's murder by the roadside in a sore afraid new world
They tried to break us looks like they'll try again
Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always shine
You got sirens for a welcome there's bloodstain for your pain
And your telephone been ringing wile you're dancing in the rain
Wild boys wonder where is glory
Where is all you angels now the figureheads have fell
And lovers war with arrows over secrets they could tell
They tried to tame you looks like they'll try again
Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always shine <start> no lyrics <start> 
Desolate winter lifeless
Landscape
Halls of north frozen
Eagles and ravens domain
Oneeyed master silently
Awaits to strike at dawn
Hordes will fight and come
forth from dark hidden places
Ready to kill
March to war for the eternal
Northern Sky <start> fall asleep fade into dreams
like a leaf drown or fallen with breeze
a perished romance but does it affect me
yes as perdition and ruin are accompany
fall asleep fade into dreams
like a flower withers and it's time of beauty
a last farewell but do i even care
yes as a goodbye was all we ever had
CHORUS
this is the new last beginning a distant shore
a long way to somewhere
this is the last new ending jubileum of my sorrow
perhaps the august waters turn to frost
perhaps the flame of life is lost
on these meadows of earth all painted here by dreams of rust
and when the veil of sun is rising maybe once it brought some light
now it's one that takes away every beam into the night <start> My chains are paper thin and they're welded with ink
Sealed inside a legal trap so tight with a leak
A contract with the devil for a life of disdain
Seeping in the limelight at attention slave
I blame myself
God help me pour this gas on me
I need to drown in flames to be free
Help me pour this gas on me
Help me pour this gas on me
God help me pour this gas on me Repeat x
Chocking on the product for the mass to consume
The flocks of mindless sheep that have been corporately groomed
Ignorance through apathy like drones in the hive
A slave on the trail a willing conformed disguise
I blame myself
God help me pour this gas on me
I need to drown in flames to be free
Help me pour this gas on me
Help me pour this gas on me
Repeat x
I sold my soul
God help me pour this gas on me
I need to drown in flames to be free
Help me pour this gas on me
Help me pour this gas on me

'Cause there ain't too much of that down here
A clouded mist in a darkened tunnel
And twisted screams are growing near
Now you're down here you're gonna all stay
'Cause the howling furies wanna come out and play
You're headed for doom you'd better prepare
'Cause in this part of the woods almost anythings fair yeah
You lied and cheated in your miserable life
You met your end with a butcher knife
We laughed when you died you sit in your grave
Just waiting to turn into Satan's slave yeah <start> Why did you do this
Where is your head at
You fucking blockhead <start> I see your picture laughter from yesterday
Silence all around me except the voice from the TV
And I still can't believe it's over
But time will heal all wounds I know
We sail on to dreamland
We'll meet there one day
We share our feelings
We'll be okay
Staring out the windows dreaming of the past
The good times and the bad times they are here to last
And I hope it's getting better
'Cause time will heal all wounds I know
We sail on to dreamland
We'll meet there one day
We share our feelings
We'll be okay one day <start> You can suck a fart out my cock
Why do you think men laugh at you and still fuck you once
Your cries wet my eyes
I'll kill the hostages if denied my target <start> The land is silent before the storm
On the vast fields of snow
The wind is blowing strong
With it's frozen cold and relentless touch
It leaves a dead and hollow land of ice
I have seen through the eyes of a wolf
And felt all its pain and loneliness
The beautiful land opened before my eyes
Wild as a beast I ran into the night
The calling of the howling wind
Is raging in the realms of north
Creations of ice rising mighty into the skies
And treacherous Gods shall fall
Watching through the falling snow
There's no sign of life
The fire has gone out
In the whirl of time
Behold the face of thunder
The storm is getting near
When the sky calls my name
I have no fear
The calling of the howling wind
Is raging in the realms of north
Creations of ice rising mighty into the skies
And treacherous Gods shall fall
They brought us misfortune
But their honor is about to be crushed
My blood flows cold as streams of the north
We'll never let them take our souls
The calling of the howling wind
Is raging in the north
Creations of ice rising mighty into the skies
And treacherous Gods shall fall
Time and time again
I witness the birth of a new born star
I climb the highest mountain
To find the essence of a new era
Time and time again
I witness the birth of a new born star
I climb the highest mountain
To find the essence of a new era <start> Oh yeah
The fire it rages
It burns clear in the night
Illuminates the path before us
Now true our arrows strike
Defy we heed the call
Defy strengthen us all
Defy for we are many
Rising against you
Defy we heed the call
Defy strengthen us all
Defy for we are many
Rising to crush you
Now the tide is turning
Our might striking fear
Our passion foretells our triumph
Smite those who stand against us
Defy we heed the call
Defy strengthen us all
Defy for we are many
Rising against you
Defy we heed the call
Defy strengthen us all
Defy for we are many
Rising against you
We are your fast approaching doom
Now tremble
Let the tyrants fall
Let the sons raise the call
Let the tyrants fall
We are your fast approaching doom
The fire it rages
It burns clear in the night
Illuminates the path before us
Now true our arrows strike
Defy we heed the call
Defy strengthen us all
Defy for we are many
Rising against you
Defy we heed the call

A long time ago in a galaxy far away
The evil empire was building a force destroying all in its way
Lord Vader he's the man in black
Helmet of steel helps him to breathe and with Jedi force he attack
The death star is near
But the rebels have no fear
The dark side of the force
They'll never join
Star Wars the rebel fleet is on the way
Star Wars they have come to save the day Star wars
A new hope is here and he's gonna save us all
He is so young but his force is so strong Luke Skywalker is his name
Our freedom he's gonna bring back
He has come to lead us into the light it's time to stand up and fight
He flies among the stars
With the speed of light he goes
The dark side of the force
He'll never join
Yoda my master
Teach me how to fight
The evil Lord Vader
Is dying here to night
Star Wars
We fight for freedom
We fight for glory
We fight for all <start> Most think when death comes
That spirits are judged
These cheap beliefs can bum in hell
Hopeless truth dying time comith
Spirits become my prey
Satisfying my unholy appetite
Within me all are equal
Being eternally digested.
CHORUS
Death is the unknown goal
When you are deceased
I devour your soul
Some souls may become free
But limbo is a dark ocean
And I the shark only time
Before I bite and feast
Then another soul eternally digest
Into this dark gods gullet of the damned
Afterlife unfortunately is just
Another different hell.
repeat chorus <start> Lyrics A. Beckers R. Tyssen
In silence I am wandering
Can't avoid the screaming words
I try to make up my mind
All this thinking makes me blind
No control in my mind.
Chorus
And I open my eyes
Don't know what to do
I'm waiting for answers
But they are all untrue
There is a never ending pain
Slowly tearing me apart
Never ending insanity
Your darkness makes it hard
Solo J.E.
Chorus
And I open my eyes
Don't know what to do
I'm waiting for answers
But they are all untrue
There is a never ending pain
Slowly tearing me apart
Never ending insanity
Your darkness makes it hard
In silence I was wandering
Couldn't avoid the screaming words
I tried to make up my mind
All this thinking made me blind
The reason for my suicide. <start> Inhale
Breath inside infected air
Airborn cancer spreading everywhere
Starting to tear apart
Apart from flawless shell its in our hearts
Diseace that has been brought to a fine art
We unleashed
The flames of the end
Empyrium within
Is burning like pyre
We set the heaven on fire
Today I feel
I wish to disappear
Leave without a trace
Wish to become
A transparent one
A ghost under the sun
Betray
Broken trust you cant repair
Were just victims
Theres noone to blame
First rule in this game
You play
Hide and seek of predators and prays
Our true nature
Revealed in godless ways <start> You said you'd cried a thousand times.
But I don't believe a word of it.
You loved it when my heart stopped
So you start to listen.
Just sit and listen
Don't test my words
Just believe
I did believe
Just believe
I did believe
Who am I to say
Fall Amy fly
You can't lie your way out of this one.
Fall Amy fly
You can't lie your way out of this one.
Put faith aside
We have no way of knowing
How short our tie is
Before the Devil knows your dead
There will be blood
There will be blood
Now you know just how I feel
Fall Amy fly
you can't lie your way out of this one.
Fall Amy fly
you can't lie your way out of this one.


The fall will destroy at the end of it all
And after it all the hopes of the sinners will lose hope and break for me
Oh baby just maybe you're not the one
You never were
It was all sympathy and simple words of nothingness
Nothingness
This is where you die
This is where you die <start> Young and confused
Socially abused
Can't find liberation
Fucked up in a hole
Take my life
Hold me till I die
Force feeding me
Umbilical delinquincy
Shoot me in my brain
Fuck me in my brain
Till the feeling's gone
Then just turn and run
Spare a mental diction
Dependency is form
Take my life
Hold me till I die 
Take my life
Hold me till I die  <start> Salt rock eyes as hard as a swollen diamond
yet as dull as the bottom of my shoe
Fixated on the steel in your hands and the latex across your body
Gagged by rubber through silenced from rapture
This is the cross <start> Draw the curtains
Bind the blinds
And this wont take me too much time I
Want to tell you
Days ago
I lived a nightmare down below
You cant see this night
Its what you want its what you need
But I cant hold this dream
Its why I bleed
Its what you need
Dig that grave for all my hopes Im
Hanging from your heavy rope and
Kiss that angel night goodnight
I drift and down I fall
I cant leave this night
Not what I want its what I need
And I cant hang this lightless night its right
Its what I need
This is all that Ive become
Though it may change in years to come
Im less than shadows of my past
Im sorry that I failed you
You cant see this night
Its what you want its what you need
But I cant hold this dream
Its why I bleed
Its what you need
You cant see this night
Its what you want its what you need
But I cant change this dream
Its why I bleed
Its what you need
Draw the curtains bind the blinds
And this wont take me too much time <start> Music SandbergIII November '
Lyrics Hirsch November '
Pray for darkness pray for the world below
Pray for winter pray for forever snow
Pray for the sun never to rise above the hills in the horizon far away
far away
Forever night
Ah... Forever night 
Pray for sorrow pray for melancholy
Pray for sadness happiness will never be
And at night we'll walk together you and I
And pray for your soul not to perish in the darkest of nights
Chant of the Witch
Spirits whispering in the darkness
Shadows dancing in the night
Fear the demons ever present
Run in panic scream in fright <start> Among the Celts lived a priesthood in ancient times
When the Romans practised justice with despite.
The people asked its riddling members for their advice
And for their imagination of life.
Enter the depths of history
And follow the traces of the druids
Listen to the speech of mystery
And let the wind tell the truth.
Secrecy prepared their way into the promised land
Spiritual meetings were denied.
Conspiracy of sacred Christ's concluded soon their end
Dismemberment of others deify...
Wizardry and mystic rites
Assemble on this ground
Forgotten magics come to life
Forbidden fear is found.
The message of the druids
Is the sign for us to see
Eternity has formed a life
That rests in our belief.
Mythology sealed the fate of these former priests
Reality taught us to forget.
But tell me why wants my thoughts me to search for more
Why is my mind filled with regret
Secluded life  Where do you rest
I pray for your arise.
Dismal oath descant your death
And ban the pagan rites...
Deviltry can't stop my way into the promised land
Historical places I will reach.
Witchery won't break my aim to end this ignorance
Eternal tribute I receive.
Wizardry and mystic rites
Assemble on this ground
Forgotten magics come to life
Forbidden fear is found.
The message of the druids
Is the sign for us to see
Eternity has formed a life
That rests in our belief.
Fragment...
Deep in the past you vouch for the truth.
Possession...
Praising the words of the unbroken spell.
Deny...
Submitting the doubt that grows out of the visions.
Curse God...
Deceive the apostles' yell.
Hear the speech of mystery
Burning down to history.
Obey
Prepare for their return
Don't break the oath.
Not a lie
Not a sin
It's the birth of origin
Destiny will rape the pride
Testify your pride.
Testify your pride. <start> I found session betrayed now it's on now
I saw human I see so
Well I am certain of I don't know how
Other souls beyond this smile
I hate you from the bottom of my heart
I have no fucking right now I see so
Beside you I saw 
Other souls beyond this smile
Well I thought now I said I saw 
I saw it your vanity your mentality 
Chorus
Never seen the fooled beast inside of me
Well I'm an asshole and I really will always be
So why now oh let it be
Is that so fucking hard oh be dead I'm free
Burn it hard make a void that sucks to the suction drive
We need the open thing with my special little part of life

I'm accessing in all the northern light
You know I got no fucking other souls guilty now
I've got no fine no fucking thoughts so
A combination now you're fucking dead
Chorus <start> I exist in a constant dreamstate
Where my mind is free to wander
The answers come so easily
To all the of the questions pondered
I'm not held down by this body
I'm not tethered to this Earth
The spirit realm is my playground
Master of the universe
We're out of body and out of our minds
Shit out of luck and out of time
Every day in this world seems exactly the same
Nothing learned or achieved just the same old routine
I take a breath set this shell to autopilot
Let my soul fly freely may the Great Spirits guide it
I take a breath set this shell to autopilot
Let my soul fly freely may the Great Spirits guide it
All this noise and everything you say
Does not concern me I'm miles away
Not searching for anything in particular
Just thumbing through the Akashic Records
Access to all knowledge as needed
All that was and all that will be
Seeing past the illusion of time
The potential of what we all could be
I take a breath set this shell to autopilot
Let my soul fly freely may the Great Spirits guide it <start> Money from the genius mind
Who help create the master plan
Rulers underground beneath the surface
Slowly wakening
Futuristic weapons just created
For your suffering
Made in his own image
Just to see we did where we'd go wrong
Chorus 
Tempted from the fruits of life
An onward search for destiny
Callous people reach for power
Leadership and reasoning
Chorus 
Redeem deny
Redeem deny
Promises are glorified
The evil sins of deadly fiends
Money money changing hands
To buy the world of all demand
Chorus 
Chorus  <start> Your Life no longer has any value
Let them tell you what your own life is worth
There is no compassion as life fades away
This self deliverance the choice you have made
Contemplate your last breath
As you see the face of death
Contemplate your last breath
Breath slowly breath
Goodbye
The pain in your life I cannot perceive
Crimes of humanity I see and believe
Contemplate your last breath
As you see the face of death
Contemplate your last breath
Breath slowly breath
Goodbye
Like the knife that cuts through me
Stabbing uncertainty
It bleeds my life I know
Draining my heart my soul
Contemplate your last breath
Breath slowly breath
Goodbye
Goodbye <start> I think I know you
I think I've seen you before
Don't think you know it
But I know that you're a joke
You're so impressed with all the filth that I abhor
You spineless coward
You know you're worthless
You whore
I want the world to know how spineless and fearful you are
Want all your loved ones to be there just to see you fall
I hope that I can be the reason you wear your scars
I want the world to know how spineless and fearful you are
I think you know this
I think it eats you inside
I bet your nightmares are better than your real life
You point the finger but when I look in your eyes
I see you weakness and know your life's a life
I want the world to know how spineless and fearful you are
Want all your loved ones to be there just to see you fall
I hope that I can be the reason you wear your scars
I want the world to know how spineless and fearful you are
You will never fill my shadow
No you can't fill my shadow
You will never fill my shadow
You will never fill my shadow
No you'll never
No you'll never
No you can't fill my shadow
No you'll never
No you'll never
You'll try to fill my shadow
No you'll never
No you'll never
Boy you can't fill my shadow
No you'll never
No you'll never
Boy you can't fill my shadow
No you can't fill my shadow
You will never fill my shadow
No you'll never
No you'll never <start> Windjourneythe Human Plague

Pesten kom frn Sder.

Med blod och eld.
Vi hugger ner dem.
Blixtrande blad.

Mnniskopesten...
Har ej plats hr.Mnniskopesten...
Ska slitas isr. <start> As I clear my mind enough to see
Decaying pieces of my being that have fallen on me
I find the one clean cut that has given the wrath
Beneath the deep and cleansing fire that is shaping the path
I've had all my life to fall in place
I watch all my past in right decay
And with every step that shames my face
I see all my pieces catch ablaze
Chorus
The pain is fading now you're leaving me alone.
I can't stop bleeding I'm depleting on my own
I can't bury every form I've seen
The hollow pieces of perfection are embedded in me
And with every step the walls give way
And in the shadow of deceit I can see you fade
I've seen all those dreams we try to hide
And the sound of honesty's reply
But I'm not that man you've seen inside
He was born so pure but then he died
Chorus
With every word I breathe out
I feel it escaping from my soul
With every thought created
Omission leaving me so cold
I've seen inside the downward fall
Remember all the filth I saw
I've seen inside the downward fall
Remember everything I saw
Chorus <start> Waste as the seas flood
The religious soil and
Mankind lays in ruin still
We burn with joy
Heed the call the distorted grin
The enlightened has prevailed
Now face the sewer
Spirits die with the written words
Icons scattered in the sea
... The etching cleanser
Cold
Waiting
Grave
Words end...
So come extinction
The ethnic savior
No lies
Hope
Dies
Terrified
The sickened fall
Fall
The mindless weep polluted tears
Preachers vomit human waste
The shapeless crawl in cancer soil
The melting earth still breaths
Heed the call the distorted grin
The enlightened has prevailed
Now face the sewer
Spirits die with the written words
Icons scattered in the sea
... The etching cleanser <start> when you feel grief and lone all others appear so happy
the weather then is beautiful all could be so well
and if your world falls apart all around seems laughter
all those fragments fragile now and hereafter <start> Ah Hugh 
Show me the way to he hallways
below Rome I will be there
I've seen them burning in fire
They all bear too much to bear
Why don't you think of all those who will come
Don't you waste your life
Don't you try show me the way
Don't need 'good advice'
Cold hallways so old a chalice of gold
A guard as they say paralyzed
Follow the cries from out of the blood
The wine in the cup
Out of the wine out of the chalice of agony
Welcome to Avantasia
Out of the wine out of the chalice of agony
Welcome to Avantasia
Regrin my friend we are passing the gate
Back into my world
I am afraid of the guard and I wish
Warnings had been heard
Welcome to Rome it's our mission
to make tortured spirits free
Something's in here oh I wish I could hide
from its staring eyes
Cold hallways so old a chalice of gold
And I feel a chill
Staring eyes while I hear the cries
From out of the blood the wine in the cup
Out of the wine out of the chalice of agony
Welcome to Avantasia
Out of the wine out of the chalice of agony
Welcome to Avantasia
No way out we got to run to the gate
No way out  for some of the souls it's too late
Jakob are you free
Out of the wine out of the chalice of agony
Welcome to Avantasia
Out of the wine out of the chalice of agony
Welcome to Avantasia <start> They say we're free to speak to speak whatever we may have
To say and that we're free to wear it all in every fcking way.
It's up to fucking you to fulfill your damned fcking life
With ease and to carry any symbol view or dream that
You may fucking please.
But hairstyles never cease to stir their fcking minds
En masse. Your clothes will always bite big chumps
Right out of their concrete ass. You'll be corrected.
Censored and asked to appear in a milder way.
And in the end eventually if you're weak you'll
Fade in grey.
Authority. Society. Parents. Teachers. Employees and God.
Authority. Society. Parents. Teachers. Employees and God.
Fade into grey. Fade into grey. Fade into grey.
For every punch you'll take in life learn to always at least
Give two. Don't ever let somebody get away shitting on you.
There may be laws to follow. Drugs to stay away from in
Your life. But never live it feeling your damned hands and
Feets always being tied. <start> SPIKE IN MY HEAD 
I'm so damn superstitious
I run from black cats
I don't wash my dick on weekends
You can't change that so don't try
I am so damn superstitious
I shake hands with chimney sweeps
I don't talk to taxi drivers
With a whore I screw the pimp
I am so damn superstitious
I sleep the thirteenth away
I don't screw the wives of friends
I don't piss in the wind no way
I'm so damn superstitious
I don't hunt for Charles at nite
Ola is the girl I want
Dealer's gonna get a fight
Another spike in my head
Another spike in my head
Another spike in my head
Spike in my head
I'm so damn superstitious
I run from black cats
I don't wash my dick on weekends
You can't change that so don't try
I am so damn superstitious
I shake hands with chimney sweeps
I don't talk to taxi drivers
With a whore I screw the pimp
Another spike in my head
Another spike in my head
Another spike in my head
Spike in my head <start> originally by Celtic Frost
Obscurity hides the plateau
Stars darken in their place
Nanna's glowing above
Illuminates the silent scenery
Chorus
Seven they are Yezidi's call
Aeon of night Eager to Prevail
From the mountains of dawn they cry
The call of the frantic god
From the womb of mother earth they scream
The wage of creation and sin

Winds emerge from the east
Deep dark water moves
Even the cold it don eclipses
When they adore the dogfaced beast
Chorus
As they admit the infernal tide
The eye on the throne derides
The old gods and their tribes
in chaos Tiamat laughs pride.. <start> Die ewigkeit der tage
Vergehen wie der staub deiner zeit
Die suche nach der offenbarung
Auf dem weg zum himmel
Das ziel endlos und fern von sein und schein
Zuengeind  brennend bestimmend
Das fluer entfacht
Des lebens macht
Flammen meiner traeume  brennende traeume
Flammen meiner seele  flammende seele
Flammen meines herzens  lodernde herz
Flammen meines lebens  glut des lebens
Die glut meines lebens
Der aengste deiner traeume
Verschmelzen mit der wahrheit deines seins
Der ursprung deines wissens 
Hungert wie die flammen nach dem schein
Die reise deiner seele zeigt dir den weg zum ziel <start> You're a prisoner of your ideals
Just a prisoner of your materialistic ideals
You're a prisoner of your worthless ideals <start> Born to a whore on a Parisian floor
In the ides of march a babe to abhor
Pardon my French but life really sucked
When you're born and grow up an ugly duck
To the smiths to work my mother bade me
But play with the fire and you'll get burnt you see
For after the boss gave me a beating
I lit up the kiln to blow up everything
Merde
Villagers threw stones at the sight they saw
A crispy pyromaniac with no lower jaw
For this curse of life I got my revenge
Burning all Europe from Rome to Stonehenge
Then one day I wandered to a most depressing place
Creepsylvania With no food for my face
Alone in a grave I thought that was it
Till two hooded ghouls came to steal all my shit
This ones alive the chunky one said
Give him my grog and they tipped back my head
That is Fermentor heres meat to gnosh
Hey Digestor lets teach him to mosh
They asked me join 'em and gave me an axe
Then we added Dissector it was on Maniaxe
And with my friends help I'll torch every fool
Cremator burns all in the name of Ghoul <start> Flow my tears fall from your springs
Exiled for ever let me mourn.
Flow my tears fall from your springs
Exiled for ever let me mourn
Where night's black bird her sad infamy sings
There let me live forever.

Hark you shadows that in darkness dwell
Down vain lights shine you no more
No nights are dark enough for those
That in despair their lost fortunes deplore
There let me live forever.

Hark you shadows that in darkness dwell
Hark you shadows that in darkness dwell
Learn to contemn light
Happy they that in hell
Feel not the world's despite.
Aaaaaaah...
Hark you shadows there let me live forever.
Lyrics from John Dowland's  Flow my tears <start> The evil one we can defeat him. Our mission make him dead and gone.
One from each religion assembled to take him on. They would go to the
ends of the earth and below to end the game and kill the Devil Deception
our greatest weapon the priest in black has joined the cause hell betray
his master and then we will strike without pause. Midnight all the power
of light well fool the master of lies and kill the Devil repeat
Kill Kill the devil. The game was on midnight approaching the dark disciple
made the call. The formless one took shape the sight of him left us in awe
Prechorus
Now that we've got you you'll die here today. When hell freezes over you will
stand in my way. Come hell or high water to rest you will lay. When you deal
with the devil there will be hell to pay. Blinding light came The evil is finally
gone the impossible seemingly done. Still we must save ourselves from the
evil that comes from below. The darkness still lingers within us all
You've got to kill the Devil <start> Old boys. Waiting

Child's eye <start> Who will guard these hills
Those which are abandoned.
Those which are exhausted.
Everything is falling can you see it
Awareness will come slow if at all.
I knew it would come when everything collapsed.
Is it too late to rebuild these walls
 this self created bliss has destroyed everything true
When truth was the rise of the first gentian.
They do not know what they seek
So who could expect such grand repose
When all wisdom ends in nothing
Who chooses what will be truth
It feels as though there is a saw resting on these bones
Behind this flesh
lies an anaemic frame
like brittle bones they snap
it echoes for days.
I regret everything I ever promised
In this coil endlessly falling to nothing
as we think that we are all that will exist
learning now that this truth tells me nothing. <start> Oi jouluy oi autuas s hetki
kun ihmiseksi sai Herra taivahan
Synteimme thden henkens hn antoi
ja krsi ristinkuoleman
Jo toivon sde hohtavainen loistaa
nyt yll maan ja merten aavojen
Siis kansat kaikki te kiittktte Herraa
Oi jouluy s lohtu ihmisten
Oi jouluy s lohtu ihmisten
Jo kirvonneet on syntiemme kahleet
on taivas auennut lapsille maan
Orjuus on poissa veljesvaino pttyi
siis Luojan kiitosta laulamme vaan
Toi rauhan meille Herra taivahasta
ja puolestamme astui kuolemaan
Siis kansat kaikki te kiittktte Herraa
Oi jouluy s lohtu ihmisten
Oi jouluy s lohtu ihmisten <start> oh my interest
oh my loveless curiosity
oh my toothache
oh my basement
what they mean to me
all signs said that i'd been busted
my circle was tired and rusted
i was hoping for at least an argument
my sentimental hand has
fought with my chains
and got right to the heart of it
maybe this was meant for me
i ate the silver lining off
i didn't always need you
both times i was overwhelmed
both hands made room for me
the new spirit of place not body
was my anniversary
so i'll blink slowly so i don't notice
i fought with your handprints
and got right to the heart of it
maybe this was meant for me
i cut the silver lining off
i didn't always love you
i drink tears and i get right to the heart of it
maybe this was meant for me
i ripped the silver lining off
i didn't always...
i split quick and that was only two days
a small drink to make sense of the thruway
my tomorrow is rarely a new day
i run it off <start> Every night she dreams the same
Haunted by a shadow again and again
Captured and lost in a giant mace
There is no way to flee
She begs not to fall asleep
And she prays to god to set her free
She is so afraid to see
The shadow she fears is me
You think you're living
I know you're dead
I am the madman in your head
Did you not know
You don't live twice
I am the secret behind your eyes
Do you wanna hold on crying
for the rest of your life
Everyday seems to be the same
Quitting this life stops the dying
There is nothing left to win
After endless nightmares she lies weeping in her bed
A blade in her hand her nightdress is turning red
Her skin becomes paler in this cold and stormy night
This is the end of all her painful dreams of suicide <start> Rumbling thunder cracks the sky
And rain starts pouring down
Lightning strikes a cold bright light
Upon the blood drenched ground
The sword play is hard
And many falls
Steel bites sharp in flesh
And upon a mountain
Towering tall
Stands the messengers of death
Five horsemen in armour bright
Waiting in the flashing light
Looking down upon the field
Where Vikings fight with axe and shield
On stallions black as night
With eyes burning red
They ride with thunder to the fight
Deliverance of certain death
A warcry loud as Heimdall'shorne
Echoes across the land
Enemies who hear it freeze to the bone
Friends of doom proudly stands
They ride faster than the wind
With lightning speed they strike
Black ravens follow where they've been
To feed from those died
With power they vield their swords
As they ride down fleeing men
Sending them to Hel's dark court
To never come back again
The warriors ride once more
To the mountain from which they came
Once sent by the Gods to war
And they never return in shame <start> Symmetry

Defending their land sword in hand
They will die as proud warriors
And will be welcome as kings in Valhalla
Savagery and genius of war
The victory's already written
Corpses lying on the battlefield
Odin's children meet Death in honour
Odhal forever standing on their property
The runes' power will protect them endlessly
We are them
We the soldiers of Wotan
We spread terror and spill blood
By Mjollnir we will crush weakness
Thus will begin our reign <start> When you're drowning
when you're freezin'
when you're feeling cold
There's a light in the darkness
as the elder always told.
When the winter's coming closer
and the autumn's passing by
Then the world will sink in silence
and I think we all should try.
Oh I want to live my life in a fairy tale
Where the end is always good and never sad.
Show me the way to another world
Where the sun is always shining in the and
And we fight back the tears and we lose our fears
Let the world remain in silence for a while
Sun in our minds in a world full of ice
Let silence remain for a little while.
Somebody came and slammed the door
took the feelin' away from our hearts.
And the horror took hold of a place
in our hearts filled with love.
What is left behind the ice
behind the make up and the lies
Tell me what goes on inside our minds
There is a hole in our sky
getting bigger growing wide
No more answer but we hold the line
See and hear what we have done to us all
we want to be free more than anything
Do you hear what I say to you
We will make it through the sun shall shine.
Hear the words we say and see the light of day
We never will be free until the sun is shining for us all
Carry on carry on and make our dreams come true
And for a little while we stay together
Carry on carry on may all our lovin' stay
And for a little while we stay together forever
Together forever. <start> I was dreaming that I was caught up in the middle of a parade
But I wasn't paying attention to the statement being made
And when I looked up at a banner and saw just what it said
Then I wished that I was somewhere else instead
Because the message on the banner was for white supremacy
And no matter how hard I tried it didn't make any sense to me
So I studied the people around me trying to think of what to say
But the only thing I could think of was to laugh and walk away
I was dreaming that I was talking to a man about his faith
And I was far away from home in some kind of exotical place
The situation was such that when I looked at my surrounding
I got nervous and my heart just started pounding
I realized that I was the only man that was Caucasian
All the people around me looked like oriental Asian
I was a legal alien in a difficult situation
But I could relate to the state I was in when I thought about discrimination
Was I in the wrong place at the wrong time
Or was I in the wrong state of mind
Wrong place wrong time or wrong state of mind
Wrong place wrong time or wrong state of mind
Was I in the wrong place at the wrong time
Wrong place wrong time or wrong state of mind
Wrong place wrong time or wrong state of mind
I was dreaming that I was at home and when I took a look around
It was as if the entire population had suddenly gone underground
I was standing all by myself and there was no one to be found
The only thing worse than a terrible noise is not even hearing a sound
There wasn't a trace of a human face as far as my eyes could see
I started to feel kind of lonely and I wanted some company
I had to make do with myself and the thought didn't appeal to me
'Cause the only thing worse than to many people is feeling completely lonely
Was I in the wrong place at the wrong time
Or was I in the wrong state of mind
Was I in the wrong place at the wrong time
Or was I in the wrong state of mind
Wrong place wrong time or wrong state of mind
Wrong place wrong time or wrong state of mind
Was I in the wrong place at the wrong time
Wrong place wrong time or wrong state of mind
Wrong place wrong time or wrong state of mind
Anybody could be related with a monkey in a tree
Or an ancient tribe from Africa but that doesn't bother me
I've probably got lots of relatives that are Jews and nobody knows
Maybe that's the reason for the size of my big and beautiful nose
My family tree is a mystery that comes from all over the place
So tell me the logical definition of a perfect race
Some people are dressed in a darker tan and some have a lighter shade
And I can assure you nobody's sure exactly where they were made
Was I in the wrong place at the wrong time
Or was I in the wrong state of mind
Was I in the wrong place at the wrong time
Or was I in the wrong state of mind
Wrong place wrong time or wrong state of mind
Wrong place wrong time or wrong state of mind
Was I in the wrong place at the wrong time
Wrong place wrong time or wrong state of mind
Wrong place wrong time or wrong state of mind <start> Ten lost tribes slaves in chains
As the scriptures tell of their pains
Torn from lands chosen roam
The Assyrian kings claim the throne
Ten lost tribes the throne they seek
Visions hailed them roaming free
Eyes will weep as they behold the sight
The truth of their fathers denied
From Assyrian chains to the windswept plains
Of ancient Palestine
Our Heaven's found
Behold the sight
Dominion we've found
Recite the ninth rite...
So Joshua smote the land
Cleansed of the kings and their scribes
Reclaim thy hallowed ground
For thy Lord God Israel
Immersed in the meaning of the era's end
Dueling over sovereignty of holy sand
Talmudic rats roam the Judean plain
As vagabonds inherit years of pain
Immersed in the era's end
Shards of glass penetrate bloodsoaked sands
As razorsharp tears in the flesh of Christ
Recite the lies that strip them of life <start> I cannot sacrifice this gift you've given me. All else just disappears it's all that I can see.
Sweet laughter beckons me it heals all that surrounds. Baptize me with your touch this gift that I have found.
It is in you that I see...all that I could ever need...all that I could become. Close my eyes...see her smile...all my
pain...fades to grey. Soft kisses penetrate me without a touch from her lips. Shining eyes speak volumes without
an uttered sound. Her smile overtakes me silhouettes all my fears. All doubt of divine existence washed away by
joyful tears. It is in you that I see...all that I could ever need...all that I could become. Close my eyes...see her
smile...all my pain...fades to grey. Now I have something to give. You've shown me all I have to give. Now I have
something to give. We've become all I have to give. <start> Tongues lost in me
Yours be the sharp and the vile
Glide neath my skin
Storm through my nerves
I bury the nomad years
Hours in the earth
Couldn't exorcise these searing
Pecking tongues
Immune you say
Yet venom strikes
In strangest guises
As the viper in our eyes
Tongue throat tongue
Slayer of the word
And stealer of vision
A monumental reign of terrors
Throats slit up to stain the target
We're food for the hounds of trauma
Prey to the crows of stress
No power left to retrieve
My stolen language
Filtered through the illiterate
Fingers of death
Flies let sickness be poured
From the cupped hands of bedlam
On account of their brightness
I made friends with the word and the moon
Went with the tide and left for the sound
Of dead instruments thrown out of tune
The red square patterns
Dragonrise and even claw
Decoying from pandemonic symmetry
Let ring a dissonant note
In the music of the spheres
The streak of promise in the nuclear sky
These whipping black tongues
Aching to lick me back to life
To inject their truths within me <start> May your weapons melt like wax in the fire of the burning skies. may your armies be torn apart while the storm goes berserk
now hold on to your life built on lies and exploitation
hold on to your wasted life and pray to your god
you hold on to your life and beg for salvation
still hold on to your life there is no place to hide
because we are reborn in flames and purified in our own blood
...and your pain shall be everlasting...
may your kindred watch us pronouncing sentence
now you walk the endless road from heaven to hell
with every step you take you can feel the pain
you filled thousands with sorrow and now you get it all back
...and you pain shall be everlasting.... <start> The taste of bitterness
Your rolling eyes leave such a void
This part of you I can't control
I won't ignore so
Salvage the truth the story was a dream
You're awake and lifeless
The lying wheels are turning
Round and round we go
The bottom is open crawl straight to him
It seems he made you what you are

A reflection of the wrong
A reflection an image to oppose
Yeah say you are what you're not
Just to try to build it up inside

Take a deep look beyond the depths that you roam
You'll find that you want it all under your control

You only open up your eyes enough to show you care less
Than you do you paint the picture how you want
Without the truth it's worthless
Fix this fault about yourself
Before you're dead and rotting
A brutal calling for the weak
Set aside the greed
Salvage the truth the story was a dream
But you're awake and lifeless
The lying wheels are turning

You only open up your eyes enough to show you care less
Than you do you paint the picture how you want
Without the truth it's worthless
Go
The bottom is open crawl straight to him
It seems he made you what you are

A reflection of the wrong a reflection an image to oppose
An image to oppose

I'm tryin' to break away
It's gettin' heavy
There's no way I can stay
I'm going under
It's burnin' up my mind
Release the feeling
I'm runnin' out of time
Raise hell raise hell raise hell
I'm on fire
Raise hell raise hell raise hell
Can't hold back desire
Only desire
I'm on the outside
Always looking in
You know the heats on
Ready to begin
And when I'm inside
You stare into my eyes
When it's over
You see through my disguise
Raise hell raise hell raise hell
I'm on fire
Raise hell raise hell raise hell
Can't hold back desire
Only desire
Incomprehensible
Raise hell raise hell

Can't hold back desire
Come on only desire raise hell <start> Trading pussy heaven
Up for immaculate conception <start> Im full of resolve
I have no strength to mortify my anger
I cannot hold this hate inside
Breaking down
May damnation take them
I am who I am
Theyre just scums Oh
Should I calm down
Or maybe I should just leave them alone
Or watch them fall into the arms of decay
Theyll have it coming
Im sure that they should not exist
For heavens sake make them disappear
Burn in hell
Who will restore the balance 
Is it early days yet for people to live in harmony and without torments
They say future is in our hands
But why do we feel so helpless then
Things are waiting for actions from our side
We have to hold our own
I wish we could do more
But future is in mist
Future is in mist
We forge our strength with our own hands
We gotta stick together
And move towards the mist
We hope that our number will grow  <start> Instrumental <start> Deep down the line

trains leave and come
sad dreams ain't long they said
And they dream tonight
I always wanted the war

all is said and done
And they dream tonight
I always wanted the war

dying in yearning for more <start> Autumn wicked sanctuary of devastated
And Mysterious landscapes...
My portrait of death framing night passion
A fire with desire...
Oh this fatal passion condemning me
To love such gracious creature
Come to me oh night
Mistress of endless mourning
Majestic fade of day
To whom in a blood drenched cry
I confess all my pain all my agony
You bring shrouded in your dark cloak
Dark from all the grief
From all the weeping...
You bring such an imposing woman...
Such deadly woman...
Came out from a dream
In a autumnal night...
In an autumnal night passion...
How deep how graceful how fiery
How vibrant...
Is this devotion I feel for you
Dee inside me...
I lay down wrapped in your body
Your blaze setting me on fire
I lay down wrapped in your body
Your bed my last refuge
Your body... Your nude body...
My temple of love... Temple of love...
Tens a fragrncia
O perfume de uma flor
Nesse teu corpo despido
Templo do amor...
Onde meu ser chora
Por teu doce e sensual momento
Eternizado na chama do desejo
Na lgrima do sofrimento...
What are you
Are your the angel who enchants me
Or the demon who seduces me
Your chant casts a shadow over me...
Your fire reduces me to ashes... <start> Leaft me around
And nurse my broken wing
with all the promises
you can never honour
I just don't care enough
to react to vain attempts
sent only to pepetuate on selfish little world
you wont see what I've become
You'll wait and watch and still
your only let down
a violent little reaction
struggling only to keep myself alive
now here I stand
for nothing no one at all
I lead you down
begging to touch you in the cold
you give me a reason
I will not be the one
Through all the nonsense
There is a constant
you wont see what I've become
You'll wait and watch and still
your only let down
cause this felling
has dawned on the face of you
a violent little reaction
struggling only to keep myself alive
you wont see what I've become
cause this felling
has dawned on the face of you
a violent little reaction
struggling only to keep myself alive <start> To the other side of known world
To the places where time doesn't exist
You see all of it you have seen nothing
All is too much to understand
Only the higher minds so blackened and ill
Can travel beyond his thoughts
In the tower of damned darkness
The Lord of chaos the witch of the eye
Holding the keys into the shadows
Watching over green lands
Learning the ways of goodness
To prevent those shades of light
Light and its people in Arda
Weak fools enemy forever
Enemy forever
Gates of shadow doors for demons
Demons of nether and void
Infernal landscapes and abyssic essence
Insane to the mind of a man
The world of unknown enchanted domain
Fields of nightmare and fear
Like haunted dreams darken realms
Homeland for the demonic beings <start> Crossing the channel of fire
The wings of the dragon shall carry me high
The sky so dark and cold
Known only to the spirits that grew old
We rush towards th ravenclaws
They silently await to crush us all
We await the coming
Cursed as hellbound lizards we all shall crawl
Not the blessed
Nor the gifted
We choose the true evil
Not the feeble
We lords of dogs
We lords of the hammer
We lords of swords
We call upon thee
Souls of the infernal
Ghosts of the wicked
Spirits of all that is evil
Dance to the masters organ <start> I see those hands
You see those hearts
Some are slow to believe
Give me rest from this world
It's going to kill me
Inside I'm falling apart what will save me
I never knew I was so dead until I met you
It's almost over
Dry these tears from my eyes
Breathe in me a new beginning
Never let this love fade away
It's almost over
This is the only thing we're fighting for
We're gonna make it through the night
When all the hope we had is dead and gone
The only way to remain strong
I will never look back
Give me rest from this world
I never knew I was so dead until I met you
Give me rest from this world

Arrangements Samoth  Ihsahn.

Deep Green Dark Chaos.
Blinded I run down these paths.
By heart I know them.
They lead to the soaring cliffs.
Stout they stand above the water's edge
lifeless.
And this is my foundation
Cold stone.
Formed only by winds and time.
How invulnerable
lifeless.
Ahh... I have longed to be at one with this
Yet the waters call my name
For once I wish to see
the entity behind the voice.
The face of this seduction
the beauty of my pain.
Am I blessed or am I cursed by thy presence
What is my crime what is my deed
Is this life my redemption
Shall I repent or proceed
I hate my flesh.
Its dimension poisoned my soul with doubt.
It made me question
the essence of the I.
Slaves are those of this world
given freedom to lay chains upon The Master.
Master master.
The wolf is no longer free.
Release the chains and come for me.
The Elder
Suddenly his mournful cries were stunned. Out of the cold mist
came three enthralling ships. Sails torn by many a storm and the
bows adorned by the most fierce gargoyles he'd ever laid eyes upon.
Yet the crew they bore... Three times twelve in numbers. They stood
motionless wrapped in grey worn gowns. And from behind their
shadowed faces the seductive chanting. Bidding him on board.
Without besitation he accepted. And away they sailed...
Upon these seas
wherein I drowned so many times
I scatter the ashes of destiny.
Still my flames are in hunger.
With fire in my heart
shall I greet the shores ahead.
Though I know not what will burn.
Desire...
Ahh...
In the distance
I hear the waves wash over solid ground.
And in this moment I am struck blind.
Grant me sight so I can see
that which lies ahead of me.
Cursed be my mortal eyes
for dying in the realm of Death.
Hear my call...
I return to the soaring cliffs.
They truly shine of strength.
Even though I nothing learned.
With strength I burn...
Guitar lead. <start> I was once betrothed to the bonds of friends
But life too short to hold
Help me to go away
Woowee wander for warmth
Cold spreads throughout my body like cancer
Consumed by a question innately question the answer
An entrancer traveling for truth portal to portal
To quell the parallel heaven and hell are we immortal
A stepping stone of flesh and bone
A body loaned to serve our own
To atone is the undertone don't postpone
'Cause death keeps ringing like the telephone
See I don't know what direction I am heading
I don't know if there's something I'm forgetting
Before I give in to the dark
My greatest fear is bein' lost
Help me forget I'm almost gone
Before I give in to the dark
We are forlorn hope
She doesn't stop the torment hands me ways to make peace
With myself
You remembered me
Our memories play like motion pictures
Love was limited pain and struggle were fixtures
I view you as I knew you reflecting like a mirror
My eyes are the windows to your soul becoming clearer
Without a trace of time and space
I see your face an angel's face
You and I just can't erase
The meeting at your resting place
And now I know what direction I am headin'
Now I know you're the skin that I've been sheddin'
Before I give in to the dark
My greatest fear is bein' lost
Help me forget I'm almost gone
Before I give in to the dark
I saw you I opened my eyes
And suddenly realized that I was to
Be engrossed in the fact that I'm already dead you're wrong
Lost Is this all a dream are we
Lost Is this all a dream are we
Lost Is this all a dream are we
Lost Is this all a dream are we
Lost
Before I give in to the dark
My greatest fear is bein' lost
Help me forget I'm almost gone
Before I give in to the dark
You can't demand I can't escape
You can't drown and I'm as lost
Before I give in to the dark
My greatest fear is bein' lost
Lost Is this all a dream are we
Lost Is this all a dream are we
Lost Is this all a dream are we
Lost Is this all a dream are we
Lost <start> I will kill your people
For my ideology
I will make them all burn
So they'll follow me
Scared and forgotten
You'll deny my place
They will share this hating
Or they shall be slay

Hides in the lands
Killing
All that stands
Bombing
Striking the wealth
Blackouts
Do not forget
Now I have an army
But you refuse to see
The power that I do have
Ain't too much for me
As the country goes down
The blame is only on you
You left your people helpless
And now it's your turn
It's your turn to burn
Burn slave burn
Burn
Now it's my turn to make the rules
To reign my way to terrorize
This I've planned and this I'll do
No matter who dies
This is not a story
This is what we lived
Thousands died in this war
And we don't forget
The fear of the blackouts
Your loved ones could be dead
The army marching outside
Never again

Life force in blood
Spilled unto mud
You shall not do as they do

Gave their heart and soul
Burned to ashes

Lay me down <start> Do you believe in the aftreworld
Or the afterlife
Do you agree there's a place for us
Beyond our life
Where the timeless call for life
Is lost and you will see
The forgotten dreams
That you once had become reality
They will be set free  nother day
You cannot leave if you do not want to stay
In the afterlife  in the afterlife
Life's a dream that you will forget
In the endless space
And the scars you got on planet Earth
Will be erased
You were blind until your eyes
Have stopped to see
And your powers unfold by the moment
You hit eternity
You will be set free
But you'll never return that's the price
You have to pay
In the afterlife  in the afterlife
SOLO Kai
Now you're gone without a word
You didn't say goodbye
I miss you here where are you now
An angel in the sky
Your visit here has been too short
You left to be set free
But I believe we'll meet again
And together we will stay
In the afterlife  in the afterlife
In the afterlife  in the afterlife
In the afterlife  in the afterlife
There's no return in the afterlife

 years of fear and lies <start> Time after time as we march side by side
Through the valleys of evil and the torturing souls
Night after night for the glory we fight
In the kingdom of madness and the tales from the old
Death by our hand for the higher command
As the darkness surrounds us and the cries as they fall
Fire burning steel and the tyrants will kneel
Hearts burning stronger with the power of the sword
Set sail for the glory
Pray for the master of war
Sunlight will fall by the wastelands
Endless rise with the heroes before
Cry thunder
Sword in his hand
Titans of justice fearless we stand
Cry thunder
Strong in command
Blessed by the union freedom of man
Reckoning day for the demons we slay
With the force of a dragon we will conquer them all
Chaos still reigns in the space and the plains
With the ultimate glory will relentlessly crawl
March on
Through the hell fire
Raging from the darkness beyond
Nightmares return by the thousands
Fearing rise with the heroes once more
Cry thunder
Sword in his hand
Titans of justice fearless we stand
Cry thunder
Strong in command
Blessed by the union freedom of man
Unholy darkness
In the eyes of broken dreams
Outside of the wasted and torn
A land of tears still remains
Soldiers of destiny calling
And the fallen will rise up again
Conquer the forces of evil and fight to the end
Cry thunder
Sword in his hand
Titans of justice fearless we stand
Cry thunder
Strong in command
Savior of nations freedom of man
Cry thunder
Sword in his hand
Warriors defending one final stand
Cry thunder
Strong in command
Blessed by the union freedom of man
Blessed by the union of man

Yeah yeah <start> At times I'm so preoccupied running
I forget paying attention to where I'm going
At times I'm so busy reaching ecstacy
I forget paying attention to all other needs
We've all got our methods of survival
These are mine
Shoo away the annoying dandelion seeds
Chase a katzenjammer violin up a tree
Startle the birds so they take off
With the entire lake in their feathers
At times I'm so busy avoiding trouble
I forget paying attention to what I miss out on
These everchanging methods of survival
I may be too deep into the darkside
But I know we need to be a bit naive as well
One thing though  how to regain naivete
When already cynical
Have some bittersweets
They're good for you
Please help yourself to some bittersweets and light refreshments
Paper aeroplanes crash into bottles spilling wine
On flies hanging around washing their hands
Maud lin flies reel all over the table when suddenly
A turreen of soup tips over as the cloth woos
and stretches for the sheets on the clothes line
I need my escapism
I'll hold on to it till I learn new methods of survival
Somehow somehere sometime it will all be good <start> This house is full of reptiles
Full of tails and feet
Full of snouts and tongues
And that terryfying screech
It's too full to move in here
I can't even mowe my head
I probly won't make it to the John
I guess I'll piss beside the bed
This house is full of reptiles
Dragons and lizzards rule
So much noise my head explodes
Someone is shaking me like a cnoor
My hous is full of reptiles
Dragons and lizzards rule
My house is full of reptiles
And it's ain't fuckin' cool <start> Arrived we to the days ov our beginning
To the City ov God clothed with the mists
Enslaved by life we danced spinning
In the taverns of time we used to sit
And drunk with memories
Dead moments glorified
I saw the phantoms ov Golgotha
Legion Legion
Fed on dust ov dead
Anoited by the grey ash
Mad twisted mob ov Jerusalem
Then Raphael beyond me and night appear'd
Bent and The Word was announc'd
An archangelic grreting 
The sign ov Portal reality ov nature
Not to be but to become
In aimless wandering across the time
On the sea ov possibilities untouched I stood
From my hand cracked heaven idols are falling to the pieces
Reached the horizon
Dagger in the air
Sylphs work is done
Oracles ov past aeons fulfill'd
Live we on the edge ov the worlds
In titanic turn ov time
Here and beyond
Carried on the wings ov the sun
Infinite sacred power we call
And sight hardly can catch the moment ov eternity
When drink with light
In light we will live
And in the formless rapture
Will we sing psalm ov Might
The last spell ov Will
We are one
We are none <start> Originally released in  on the demo album Wrath of the Tyrant.
Lyrics by Mortiis.
Music by Ihsahn and Samoth.

Earthquakes are breaking the silence
a vision of hate.
A wicked foul spell of evil.
Dark winds command the throne.
Cleansed by the evil hand
a crusade of the burning land.
A servant in the shape of a snake
blackens the bodies red.
Then it appears the storming wind
a challenging scar burns through the light.
A cloud of darkness prepared for me
to complete the circle of death.
The serpent gains mastery of the wind
through the storms and through the streaming snow.
Sorrow blackens the Earth when the Moon fades.
Dark winds command the throne.
Earthquakes are breaking the silence
a vision of hate.
A wicked foul spell of evil.
Dark winds command the throne.
Cleansed by the evil hand
a crusade of the burning land.
An embrace from Death. <start> Who Am I

A past I can't erase
I'm breaking breaking apart

It's like I'm fading each day
They took it all away
Left nothing nothing but scars

Don't know where it went wrong
But my love for this is gone
I tried to numb the pain
But I can't get away
Hiding behind this disguise
The games I had to play
The hell I had to pay
Everything comes with a price
You're waiting for me to fail
That ship will never sail
Keep pulling and pushing me down

I know you wish I was dead
I'm stuck inside your head
I'm taking and breaking your crown

Don't know where it went wrong
But my love for this is gone
I tried to numb the pain
But I can't get away
Hiding behind this disguise
The games I had to play
The hell I had to pay
Everything comes with a price
I tried to numb the pain
But I can't get away
Hiding behind this disguise
The games I had to play
The hell I had to pay
Everything come with a price <start> Now that all my dreams come true
They seem a frozen false reality
And though my hopes have not all gone
It's you to bring me out of all this vanity
But I'm still here to break the ice
I'll never give up the fight
Yearning to remember
That my dream can be reality
Yearning to remember
So I can live another day
Stop this moment and believe
I'm not afraid to show you who I am
I know I'm a passenger of life
I seize the day I try so hard to understand
But I'm still here to break the ice
I'll never give up the fight
Yearning to remember
That my dream can be reality
Yearning to remember
So I can live another day
Yearning to remember
But I'm still here to break the ice
I'll never give up the fight
Yearning to remember
That my dream can be reality
Yearning to remember
So I can live another day
Yearning to remember <start> Born from the fire clean crawling in the dirt like war
 years my mother gave a voice for war.
 I was dead born again with eyes for war
By  hate was the name of my war
Wash me in the river
Give me to the pain of Lifewar
Lifewar
 years gone and father told me life was like war
Hands to the bone  years of war
 I wake to the sound of souls at war
I will pass through buried in the flag of my war.
Wash me in the river
Give me to the pain of Lifewar
Lifewar <start> You Still Believe No Matter

prays mark of gathering.
Autumn winds be gone

Mystic land of the autumn winds
shall meet the fate
rivers no longer revive and the trees die away. <start> All your dreams
Are falling to pieces
So much to give
But so little to achieve
All of the warnings
Can't you see the signs 
Taking part of a game
Playing it without shame.
Can't you feel the pain
That is facing your mirror 
All of the madness
Swirls in your eyes...
But if you create a new world
Free you'll fly as the wind.
There is no sense keeping life
cold...
A distant thunder
You'll be his lightning
Your high potential
Don't let it die Oh no...
Please never give up
Stop hearing their lies.
Now you're creating a new world
Free you fly as the wind
There was a sense keeping life strong...
Live for what you believe...
Don't hear what they say.
Conquer your rights
Turn the page on the past.
There's nothing unconcievable for you.
Believe in your life
Say what you have to say.
Your dreams will grow fast
In beautiful reality.
There's nothing unconcievable for you.
Like a midnight star
Night by night
You will be brighter
As strong as the sun
There'll be times they put you down
There'll be times no one's around
But one thing you got to know
If the soul survives
No chains will bound you again...
chorus two times
You will survive too
You will come back too
And I'll be there too
Anyway...
Repeat <start> The duality of pure rage and chaos guides my journey
Infinite search of despair and delusion controls the inner vision
The ultimate consequence of this sorrow
The great coming of faded memories bleak and unconscious
My reigning terror has begun
The hopes cracked and vanished
Utter death arrives cover me
Reaper of grandeur honoris lux de necrosis
The nebular aura of resurrection makes my scars bleed
Tears of victory for the day of liberation is in sight
For the time of revenge has arrived
The spectral empire forges it's return <start> The stranger it seems the clearer it gets in my eyes
It's like all that is wicked is natural with my sight
As damned as I may seem to you the feeling gets me high
Cause I do feel I'm blessed with the demoneye
With eyes of a damned and sense of the insane
The stark raving mad run without shame
The stranger it seems the stronger I get in my mind
You'll all be subhuman inferior to my shame
The demon am I and demon my eyes
I am the power watch me arise
Sacred sights of fire blinds my human eyes
Truth as spooked by liars
Leaves me drained and dry
Demoneye bless my sight
Let me live without the light
The demon is not a part of me
I am part of the demon
Demoneye bless my sight
Let me live without the light
The demon is not a part of me
I am part of the demon
N' the clearer it gets the quicker it darkens the skys
And I'll become king of all that you despise
With eyes of a damned and sense of the insane
The stark raving mad run without shame
Sacred sights of fire blinds my human eyes
Truth as spooked by liars
Leaves me drained and dry
Demoneye bless my sight
Let me live without the light
The demon is not a part of me
I am part of the demon
Demoneye bless my sight
Let me live without the light
The demon is not a part of me
I am part of the demon
With eyes of a damned and sense of the insane
The stark raving mad run without shame
Demoneye demon <start> What do I have to do for this
I love this please push me harder
I just keep getting meaner
I'm growing from the pain
How about you Shit
Life it's hard it makes me stronger
A warrior seeking victory
I'll push it 'til the end push it 'til the end
Push it 'til the end shit the end shit the end
Knee deep in the shit
All together in the pit
All forever
In the shit for this
Pirate poet fucking killer
It's all what you've made me
What has life made you
Made you shit
Life chalk it up to desire
Of which I've had my fill
I just keep pushing forward keep pushing forward still
Keep
Pushing forward still shit still shit still
Knee deep in the shit
All together in the pit
All forever in the shit for
This
So if you feel the need bring it bring it
And if you just want to spit it out bring it bring it
And if you just
See your way clear then bring it bring it
Knee deep in the shit
All together in the pit
All forever in the shit for
This
Knee deep in the shit
For this
Knee deep in the shit
For this <start> The eyes are made to see
They see the paths of our lives
The heart is there to feel
It feels the energy of our time
I can see it
I can feel it
This is my waking hour
This is my place
I can hear it
I feel the power in my heart
And is my moment
It is right there
And it's staring me in the face
Disguise and makebelieve
I see the end of all demise
The only way to heal
Is in the honesty of your eyes
The fight is done
And who are we to judge
What will become
All the iron armor
Is laid down away
Followed by the heroes
Who belong on rested earth we pray
We feel the rescue coming near
Within the woken soul to hear
we sense the calm all wrapped in fear
And all the while we heed
The senses way too vast to see
We beg of you to not let go
Our names will provide us with a soul
Falling down
Start again
Life can bring you down
The monumental truth
Of elegance in you
Falling for
A part of who you are
Makes you shine inside <start> See my sorrow
My tears when they fall
Feel my anguish
Where's my shelter when I am cold
My eyes seek something
But finds nothing at all
My souls screams for mercy
Where's my guidance when I'm lost
The will I had ain't strong enough
The strength I seek ain't there
And my world is dead
My future's broken
Cause it all stays the same
They're coming
They're coming... here <start> So free
You feel when you've done your deeds late at night
So be
'Cause soon there's no shelter no place to hide
All screams
But voices don't have effect on your mind
All dreams
Of times when you weren't committed to crime
Won't lift a finger for you  R.I.P.
There's nothin' no one can do  R.I.P.
Six feet beneath the clay  R.I.P.
A price we all have to pay  R.I.P.
Got caught and separated from previous thoughts
You fought
You never were good acceptin' a loss
You know
When you've clone bad things you must take the blame
'Cause we can't live with someone like you
Curse your name
You see
There's no such thing as neglectin' a crime
Once free
Your capture was just a question of time <start> We cant let this be us My heart is in the sand. Let love close your eyes.
Let love open your hands. You can't live on the streets and change not your desire. Let love take you under. I'm in love with a bottle of grace who am I to think you ain't I'd be lying to you if I said my heart was up for all to see. because I'm not talking about making lovers out of golden picturesque sunsets. I want to be the one who can bring it to the streets and to the fixed and the victimesque.
We are all capable of love. We are all capable of cancer.
Shake it off work it out and bury it. All you need is love. Love is all you need.  This is the only dance you'll ever regret so keep the car running. Lets show them things they'll never forget. <start> My star bring me your love
My star light up my way
Never believe in the lies they sing
Never take hate they bring <start> I will make you pay the fucking price
For your filthy way of life
There is only one solution
That is MASS EXECUTION
It makes me sick it makes me hate
To watch you prance like sodomitic apes
The earth will be cleansed of your ugliness
With pride I commit homosexicide
To think they hesited when they could be satisfied
I will unleash my anger with vast amounts of chemical weapons
Listen to me I have something important to tell you
There is homosexuals crawling in your vicinity
They fuck like rats
They spread Vermithrax
I shall split you all into
Easily proscecutable units
Send you to the death camp
Send you back to your sterile father
To think they hesited when they could be satisfied
I will unleash my anger with vast amounts of chemical weapons
I have no guilt about this. I shall not hesitate
What justifies this massacre is the fact that
JESUS WAS BENT TOO <start> Jim Bakker's your excuse
you won't believe

too bigheaded to admit you failed
it's easier to copout
easier to bail
easier to be a lazy slob
as you turn your head and sluff it off
you build a wall around yourself
and put reality on a shelf
diehard  the last to go down
diehard  you're gonna stick around
diehard  refuse to believe
diehard  that God could be
I'm not trying to condemn
your life is yours
for you to live
but the gentle approach you denied
as you chose to believe the lies
face the facts you're not in control
satan cast and you swallowed whole
believe in God and think for yourself
or believe the lies and rot in hell
so get down on your knees
then take his hand to get
on your feet
leave this life
don't shun the new
don't turn from what you know is true
cause it's the same old people
attitudes and lives
you can choose to believe a lie
you can choose to live this life
or follow God and live a new life <start> Don't give up
Give all that you got
This is your final lap
Open the door
Because you need some more
The stuf that you adore
Crawl as a snake
And never take a break
It's like a piece of cake
Play tha piano
Repair your car
Prepare the meal
Hurry up
It's you last lap
You gonna make it
You gonna take it
You gonna break it <start> The cloaked loyalists launch a raid
To stem the tides of the uncontrollable plagues
The righteous and holy detest our objectives
The guillotine's blade left them headless
Hooded knights emerge from the ossuary
To curse the lonely who permit our denigration
Retroprocreation a blatant disgrace
To the majestic pool of pristine genes
What thoughts flow among the ranks of the forsaken populace
A zenith will bloom from the odor of melanin's riddance...
Technology destroyed the creatures' purpose on earth
Global winds promulgate their discomfort and grief
They label us oppressors a typical scapegoat
For their lives of rot and decay <start> 
... ...
..........................
c
 <start> Here they go again being untrue to themselves
It's nothing new it's all been done before
They are not a dying breed
More like growing seed
With roots choking honesty and truth
They are twisting your words
And they are making up lies
When confronted they are in denial
No one is given the chance
To explain the actual facts
Because the book's already judged by its cover
Hate rage fear
Not prepared to
Hate rage fear
You think I don't hear you talk behind my back
You think I don't see oyu and your hypocritical act
Did you ever think about the rest
Here's twelve rounds in the chest <start> Biased till the last day
Till the day I have to die
To overcome the legacy
And asked my self  why
Seeking for the truth that hides in the shady past
Our frightful past tense leads to the typecast
I've spoken out  accused and worried
Fucking bleed  historical force feed
I've been accused  without a deed
Sickening  historical force feed
Damned a before I could say knife
'Cause of my breed
Statue  bared infamous action
By the dead and buried
Banning my tribe's past isn't a solution
We all know the bloody truth e pay our contribution
Could I blame you for a committed crime of your kinship
Do you think the son of a criminal deserves to get the whip
We don't want to wash off the bloodon our nations hands
But don't sentence someone for his roots
Take a chance <start> Can't you see that death does want me
I can't explain you won't understand
The dream is gone the falling deep
Under the spell spoken in tongues
In the colors... of Hell.
In the ringing that chimes inside me
So drag me down deeper still
Far beyond the black horizon beyond the things you know
Poison the poison the poison
Poison the poison the poison demon
I am lost again everything's gone
And more alone than I ever have been
Out of my mind and down on my knees
I'm losing more than I'll ever get
And even if you want to you can't ever help me
Nor can I ever hope to reach you
But I love to fall... Need the rush
So don't pray for my soul 'cause I'm already damned
Poison the poison the poison
Poison the poison the poison devil
I am down again everything lost
And more gone than I ever have been
I'm not here to stay not made to last
Total destruction is the way for me
And when I kill I kill
When I kill I really kill
Yeah when I kill I kill
So I take the poison even though I know that it kills
Treachery... I will betray you all
With a poisoned kiss filled with deceit
Smiling turning my back
And leaving you all behind
In chaos and drunk in desperation
Trying to escape this meaningless life
A child of death playing with fire
So sing for my soul 'cause I cannot be saved
Poison the poison the poison
Poison the poison the poison god <start> When evil men advance to devour my flesh
When enemies attack their will to oppress
When bloody wars break loose and armies draw near
In the day of distress my heart will not fear
Pain mental torment
Saved from death
Trapped in mental pain agony within
Life consumed by anguish endurance wearing thin
Tormented by misery struggling to stand
Growing weak with sorrow my grief is in your hands
Struck down but not destroyed you lift me from the depths
You brought me from the grave redemption from death
Hard pressed on every side but not in despair
Never on my own your presence everywhere <start> Slither
Try to slither in my soul
Is to take and twist me their only goal
Won't let the wicked of the world have their way
Seen the traps they've set so I won't fall prey
It's the end of this era in time no respect for life
It's all crossed the line
Human wolves slowly train the human cows
To repress instinct and run into their mouths
Slither can't deny it's real
Slither can't deny it's real
Resist mind control
Something sinister behind the scenes
Formulas for suppression pushed into brains
Sheeple accept without questioning
Reactionaries swallow the whole thing
Won't be rendered defenseless to the predators
Won't be left without the modern equalizer to deter
Criminals hell bent to victimize
There's a lawless law out to brutalize
Slither can't deny it's real
Slither can't deny it's real
Resist mind control
Ten thousand eyes follow
From above and from below
Categorizing all to find the ones
To push against the wall
Stand up or die while there's still time
While there's still time while there's still time
There is no reason the law abiding should not possess
The means to defend themselves resist mind control
Try to slither in my soul
Is to take and twist me their only goal
Won't let the wicked of the world have their way
Seen the traps they've set so I won't fall prey
It's the end of this era in time no respect for life
It's all crossed the line
Human wolves slowly train the human cows
To repress instinct and run into their mouths
Slither can't deny it's real
Slither can't deny it's real
Resist mind control <start> The end result of so many meetings
Late night dinners with no one eating
We sit in corners and sip burnt coffee
Count the tiles upon the ceiling
Skip this pretense and cut straight to dying
Don't pick me to keep your eyes from crying
You said so much
Without even parting your lips
Past  A.M. and I'm still far from sleep
And this is a habit that I can't break
You're my only company
I'm skipping stones
And the street lights flicker like this match in my hand
Street lights flicker like this match in my hand
And the street lights flicker like this match in my hand
Begging to strike begging to strike
And I keep repeating
But this pay phone tele stopped receiving
Flat out of change now
I'm sure you won't accept the charges
It's all the same cause by the morning I'll be halfway to
Colorado or some place like that
You said so much
Without ever parting your lips
Past  A.M. and I'm still far from sleep
And this is a habit that I can't break
You're my only company
I'm skipping stones down in south suburban street
She keeps on asking Do you think it hurts much to die
It's hurting so much more to stay alive now
She's gonna find out how much it hurts to die
She laced her perfume up with death
Feel it in my lungs
So I'll pull in the deepest breath
And drop my head <start> Raise your swords up high
See the black birds fly
Let them hear your rage
Show no fear
Attack
Charge your horses across the fields
Together we ride into destiny
Have no fear of death when its our time
Oden will bring us home when we die
The ground trembles under us
As we make our thunder charge
The pounding hooves spread panic and fear into their hearts
Our helmets shine in the sun as we near their wall of shields
Some of them turn and run
When they hear our frenzied screams
Draw your swords to strike
Hear the Black Birds cry
Let them feel your hate
Show no fear
Charge your horses across the fields
Together we ride into destiny
Have no fear of death when its our time
Oden will bring us home when we die
The enemy are in disarray ride them down as they run
Send them to their violent graves don't spare anyone
Dead and wounded lie all around see the pain in their eyes
Over the field an eerie sound as we hear the ravens cry <start> Welcome the leader of divine domination
Lyrics M. Schulman
Into oblivion into a void of chaos
Gaze upon a circle of fire
Everlasting elements of innocence
Are transformed by the terrestrial silence
When will the rain turn to dust
When will white turn to black
This is the arrival  The dreamlike decay of mankind
Born with a reaping roam  A shapeless spectrum obscure
From here to beyond and back
Forward with the speed of light
Trapped within the walls of infinity
Decadence reigns in the halls of eternity
When will the rain turn to dust
When will white turn to black
This is the arrival  The dreamlike decay of mankind
Born with a reaping roam  A shapeless spectrum obscure
Upon the day and night of nothingness
Calmness is left and forever will
Prophecies of a fading dawn
Reveal the glorious masterplan
There will be no future
No future there will be...
Into oblivion into a void of chaos
Gaze upon a circle of fire
Everlasting elements of innocence
Are transformed by the terrestrial silence
When will the rain turn to dust
When will white turn to black
This is the arrival  The dreamlike decay of mankind
Born with a reaping roam  A shapeless spectrum obscure <start> Bushwick Bill
Ahahahahhaha
Oh shit is it time
Alright here's when we all come together to discuss to do time
Within ourselves when we all wanna do something extraordinary which is to kill a thought a person or a situation
Ahahahhahaha but because two muthafuckas can't agree on one issue
That creates the means for shit to come to an end
So there for it's either you gonna do it my way or you gonna die fuckin
Wit us so this is war my weapons is aimed to reach you
Rap a lot Mafia fah life nigga
I can feel you
N.A.R.D
Now how can I introduce you to this pain
Wit the slugz to the brain

Spit the world wit game
Rotate wit niggas that will not change
In this world we blame fah everythang from straps to cocaine
Individual 
Any threats so disrespect get you shot n 
Rap a lot Mafia the incredible sources n forces of course
Verbally said no remorse

 I walk this bitch wit a bum to the chest
Two teks in the vest
Put it in you

I intro I outro


I intro I outro to be continued <start> This world's yours for the taking
Run free and wild loose your mind escape your inhibitions
Taste the wind let your hair down throw your hands up
Go go go let go forget the consequences
Go go go let go running free
Open your heart open your mind to a new world
Spread out your wings and learn to fly to a new world
This world's yours for the taking
Run free and wild lose your mind this world's yours for the taking
Open wide scream it loud this is my life
Go go go let go forget what came before
Go go go let go running free
Open your heart open your mind to a new world
Spread out your wings and learn to fly to a new world
Close your eyes and pray for something better than this world has to give
Make it worth your time when you move on to whatever the hell is next
Know that you went in the end without a single regret
That you lived and loved and laughed and cried and followed your dreams
You won't you won't be alone in the end
You don't have to be afraid
You won't you won't be alone in the end
You don't have to be afraid
Run free and wild let your heart soar with the eagles
Run free and wild let your love take over
You won't be alone in the end
You don't have to be afraid <start> Corruption of power
Leads into darkness
Mind control
Thoughts to devour
Monetary gain
Profit from pain
Cash for death
Life is wealth
The largest sum
Can not be won
Decay
Of all morality
Destroying
All rights to charity <start> I sent black birds to the sky
I set a sign for my hate
To darken the day
To beat back the light

Winds storm above this wasteland
A first flickering of rage
Dark clouds keep me sheltered
Don't move before moonrise
Don't move before moonrise
We gather in the name of our pagan ancestors
The teutonic spirit burns in our hearts
What once was ours will be taken back
Rising our tribe like the upcoming winterage
Upcoming winterage
Like in the ancient days
We honour the cryptic place
Where we receive our visions
Was christian blood sacrificed <start> It's getting late and I'm ready for you
There's a message that's coming on through
I'm all worked up no place to go
They tell me babe your all talk no show
It's not the way it's supposed to be
You take my love give nothin' to me
I can't stand when you say no more
You know it's your love and I've gotta score
Don't just tease me please me
Don't just tease me please me
I try so hard but it does no good
Oh honey I wish you would
The feelings strong I just can't wait
Bring home your love and don't be late
I've had enough of your teasin' ways
Your little games I don't want to play
So change the rules and come to my side
I'm gonna take you on a rock 'n' roll ride
There's more to me than meets the eye
So come on honey gonna give me a try
Your game is over it's my turn now
Relax babe I'm gonna show you how
You gave into me I knew you would
Givin' it to me I knew you could
Together now we will always be
Me with you and you with me
I was right and you were wrong
Ah listen baby 'cause here's my song <start> Wasting Time
Time just rushing by
I don't have a clue which day it is
I get carried away but strangely I don't mind
'Cause the days I've spent have been with you
And it's great to waste time like this
I've spent them blindly  happily
My ignorance is bliss ...
You're the only privileged allowed to waste my time
I don't mind doing nothing just as long as you're around
Silence is beautiful  so please don't make a sound
No worries  no obsession this will end
What a new experience optimism is
Well maybe happiness won't last
But why spend my time down
Why keep living in the past
Or worry what's to come
You're the only privileged allowed to waste my time
I don't mind doing nothing just as long as you're around
Silence is beautiful  so please don't make a sound
Are you just content  playing along
Or are you truly equally stunned
Will you miss this feeling if one day  it is gone
Or are you killing time just for the fun Just for the fun
You're the only privileged allowed to waste my time
I don't mind doing nothing just as long as you're around
Silence is beautiful
So please don't make a sound You're the only privileged allowed to waste my time
I don't mind doing nothing just as long as you're around
Silence is beautiful
So please don't make a sound don't make a sound...  <start> The blood thirsty born on the wind
Hellbent outside looking in
Voices that carry on nightly
Don't ask just go in now blindly
I'm bloodshot thrown away goods
Venomous so fucking ruthless
A well of anger to be avoided
Extended forgiveness and then got bit
They call it the breaking point
When it comes to faith this time you've quit
You call it the breaking point
Stand up against the gates and be counted
Counted when summoned
Stand up against the gates and be counted
Counted when summoned
Nothing's ever set in stone
Wade through harvest seeds you've sown
It's alright right as rain
And as far as I'm concerned fuck the fame
I'm bloodshot thrown away goods
Venomous so fucking ruthless
A well of anger to be avoided
Extended forgiveness and then got bit
They call it the breaking point
When it comes to faith this time you've quit
You call it the breaking point
Stand up against the gates and be counted
Counted when summoned
Stand up against the gates and be counted
Counted when summoned
Climbing scratching uphill
So breathless lifeless able still
Long live this short life a trouble
Long live this short life
Long live this short life a trouble
Long live long life long live long life <start> You have been judged on your own accord
Our final word seals your fate
King of the Jews the son of God
Now condemned to death and hate
INRI INRI false prophet
Carry the cross upon your back
And take it to where you'll die
A crown of thorns for you dear king
With the other filth be crucified
INRI INRI false prophet
Taste the blood that trickes from your ravaged brow
As the sands of time run out
Lord of nothing is what we consider you
For victory is truly ours
Now you die <start> Dream through eternity
let it be the eternal journey
without the end <start> Downcast of shadows
The self denied
The self denied of hidden places
Lost passages
Pure volatile
Dripping from the cracks that keep you
Lost in parables
Convulsions of the epileptic kingdoms that bestow
Clean
Thorough
Antiseptic
Scrubbing deep into the bone
Condensing the marrow
Taste perfected
The cattle won't disown
The human man must be inspected
If I were to touch you
Would you wither in my arms
And if I were to love you
Would you motion to disarm
Sense of warning
Rigid from the petrified essence
Estimated measures
Celestial
In my presence
A stew of precious treasurers
Reaction from the casualties
That surround me slithering
A transparent excess suppressing
Pull the lever
Fall  infected  down
Miracles designed for success
All of us
Are you harvesting with the maggots
Falling hard with dung on your breath
Infesting what is pure and damaged
Like swarms of locust feeding
Born first
Still in needing
Alert the dogs
Flee
An expert on penalty
Without vision the birds of the air will
Pick at your skull
Calloused
Clothed in darkness
Tragedies
Turn
Providing alternatives
Development
Additives
Sediments
Firm
Evolving
Supporting the process
Dedicated
Moments of silence
Quest of the new
Increasing the magnification of your velocity
Would this be considered growth
Through hypocrisy
Advancement
Merging with the contents of the universe
The focus of enhancement
Evacuate the premises that continue to revolve
Cluttering of arrangements that continue to dissolve
You
Accelerate
Beyond the surrounding borders
Maintain the order
Irradiation
The newest method of preservation
Radioactive
Spastic and down for the cause
Spoiled by mold
Nuclear turbines
Fuel injected outlawed
Newton's third law of motion <start> Twisting and turning unable to sleep
Do the voices ever stop
My thoughts speak louder the more I resist
And they're driving me insane
Do they ever go
Inside I'm a danger to myself
I'm a danger to myself
Inside I'm a prisoner of my own hell
My own hell
Losing the battle I've waged on myself
Lock me up and toss the key
Toys in the attic its all getting worse
Why wont they let me be oh god make it stop
Inside I'm a danger to myself
I'm a danger to myself
Inside I'm a prisoner of my own hell
My own hell
Fit me for a straitjacket
Put me in a padded cell
I'm a danger to you all
And I'm a danger to myself
Inside I'm a danger to myself
I'm a danger to myself
Inside I'm a prisoner of my own hell
My own hell
Inside I'm a danger to myself
I'm a danger to myself
Inside I'm a prisoner of my own hell
My own hell <start> I'm gettin' in
Can you feel the shake
Snakes and rats
I'm inside
Get out from here
I don't need a toy
I f... your advice
Dickheads go home
Boss is out
Time for little breath
Princess of booze
Is beggin' for dime
Every morning I'm watchin the sky
Expecting the next rain of s...
Oh Baby I still don't wanna buy a suit.
Chorus <start> Regrets night sweats
Occasional thoughts of suicide
Green light I'm ok
Feeling fine just a little tongue tied
Old habbits die hard and I've lived so fast
And I know its a long way down
tempting me
Tempting you
Tempting us in all that we do
Can't make a move
Show me a sign
What's your will
Its a...
long long way
Between sin and sacrifice
Long long way
Between sin and sacrifice
lost sleep count sheep
Can't seem to get my mind off of things
Toss and turn candles burn
Grinding teeth at night endlessly
Old habbits die hard and I've lived so fast
And I know its a long way down
tempting me
Tempting you
Tempting us in all we do
Can't make a move
Show me a sign
What's your will
Its a...
long long way
Between sin and sacrifice
Long long way
Between sin and sacrifice
Long long way
Between sin and sacrifice
Long long way
Between sin and sacrifice
I'm burning internally
I'm burning
I'm burning internally
I'm burning
Its a...
long long way
Between sin and sacrifice
Long long way
Between sin and sacrifice
Long long way
Between sin and sacrifice <start> Thinking of you and the things you do
When I wake up you're there
With your body around me
It's true that I'm needin' you
You would do anything anything
Anything to please me
CHORUS
Me and Toni Toni and me oh oh
We are one and the same
Me and Toni Toni and me oh oh
We'll always be
Toni my only my love
You're on my mind all of the time
Even when I'm sleepin' into my dreams you're creepin'
And cannot deny
That I'd rather go blind than to see you walk away from me
Oh
CHORUS
And when I'm lying with you alone in a room
In the darkness
Our love's so strong that it hurts
And I realise you're my Toni
Oh oh
CHORUS x  <start> a gentle rain came down on all
falling down upon the world
washing away our sins
tears that cleanse the soul
and soothe the pain
rain of revival
rain of revival
running down my skin
no past's survival
remaining in my heart
rain of revival
remembrance washed away
my past's denial
i'm challenging the day
i'm sailing on the sea of change
conquering new lands
coasts of new adventures
unknown tasks unknown fears
better than remaining here
i'll leave the world behind
rain of revival
will you join my walk
to new dimensions
i'll take your hand
to change your life <start> I summoned up the living dead
And the demons in the skies
I drank from chalice warm and red
And watched the virgined eye
Present at ungodly births
In holy paradise
I spread eternal dark on earth
And raped the mother of Christ
See'mon baby
Raise your knife
Welcome darling
To my sacrifice
Tie the angel to the altar
Sacrifice to lord in hell
Let the warm blood torrent baby
Moonlight set the night on spell <start> Dark horizon darkest sky
No light is present
Freezing winds of lands unamiable
Haunts the wastes of Neverwhere
Life doesn't belong here
Limitless unmeasurable time is not
As the end so is the beginning
Always was always will be
This is where the journey ends
This is what no one returned to tell
Neverwhere
Life doesn't belong here
Dark thoughts darkest mind
No light is present
I now put aside my crown of thorns
Time has come to join eternity
And rest my eyes on a darker shade of color
Eager to be erased
Innumerable stare behind frozen eyes
Wanderers strayed from eternity's path
Longed for to come to rest at last
Limitless unmeasurable time is not
As the end so is the beginning
Always was always will be
This is where the journey ends
This is what no one returned to tell
Dimensions warped in times of motionless storm
Now frozen worlds collide
As the womb of cold opens wide
Childhood has passed
Now birth will come of ages dreamed of by none
Now awaited the circle to close
We wait for the call Lazarus come out
Now awaited the circle to close
We wait for the call Lazarus come out
We wait in the shadows of Neverwhere <start> In the blackened shadows beneath the mistveiled mountains
Dwells an ancient evil of a long forgotten past
Beneath the twisted trees it's hatred is growing stronger
Restrained for an eternity soon to be unleasehed
Ravaged by a thousand storms
Scarred by the anger of gods
Tainted by a magic foul
Mighty mistveiled mountains
Reaching towards the sky like a thorn that's forged from darkness
A symbol of oppression a monument of fear
In the tower bloodthorn the unspoken horror breeds
Hidden by the veil of time untouched by the light
Ravaged by a thousand storms
Scarred by the anger of gods
Tainted by a magic soul
In the shadows of mistveiled mountains
Come to me you pitiful mortal
I sense your presence... and despair
Come to me you pitiful mortal
I thrive upon  upon your fear
Your soul for me for me your flesh
Your pain and anguish  my life
Joined together become as one
As one in darkness
Summoned by a chanting whisper
Your soul for me for me your flesh
Lead astray from the path I follow
Can it be my soul is fading
Lost eternally
Embraced by evil
Surrounded by darkness
Come to me you pitiful mortal
I sense your presence... and despair
Come to me you pitiful mortal
I thrive upon  upon your fear
Your soul for me for me your flesh
Your pain and anguish  my life
Joined together become as one
As one in darkness <start> FOR THOSE WHO DARE

Tuskissasi jaloissani rymit
Armoa anoen
Vuodattaen verta tuhansista haavoistasi
jotka suolalla ja myrkyll kyllstin
Ei ole armoa
Ei anteeksiantamusta
kun kasvojasi ilkkuen potkaisen
Kuka nyt on Herra
ja ket on korkeuksiin katsottavan
Kenen varassa on elm ja kuolema
kenen vihaa on nyt peljtvn
Kurjuutesi on onneni
Heikkoutesi on vahvuuteni
Mahdin alla taipuu kovinkin ters
Pelossa katoaa syvinkin viisaus
Viimeinen isku
Raastaa sinusta elon rippeet
Ruumiisi hpisen
ja hautaan kuolleeseen synnin maahan
Kerran taivaan valon ruhtinas
nyt ravintona matojen
Kun jlleen yhn palaan
on nimesi vaipunut unholaan <start> High above the ground beyond the thunderclouds
A black shade is flying alone once so feared among men
Now the legend is becoming too old
But finally the horrifying truth is about to unfold
Death bringer from the sky hunting victims in the night
Feel the terror as flames are burning bright
There is and no tower as high or cave so deep
That can save you from its endless spite
So bow down and face your wretched destiny
A den filled with treasures and gold
No longer calms his spirit so cold
Again it's time to spread the wings of doom
A growl shakes the ground
Flames blind men and smoke covers the stars
As he rises towards an ancient sky
The era of total chaos will arrive men shall flee in fear
My name will haunt their mortal souls <start> I send your name
up into the sky
And the wind blows it back into my face
You see even nature
reacts on me
And all my electricity
will make it across your sea
With every wave the sea makes
My body gets weaker
and weaker... and weaker...
You see even nature
reacts on me
And all my electricity
will make it across your sea <start> I stalk alone the burried seas
Dead and white weak memories
Below  I'm turning blue
Why does the ice burn so hot
Frozen waters a strange land
I know I live as the frost bites
My eyes are closed but I can't sleep
Moving forward for sleep means death
A white shroud covers me
I buried myself to stay alive
Time's passing slow on my pale face
Beneath the snow beneath the ice <start> The gravest insult upon my house
You have dared to slight my name
Betrayed allegiance forsake the bond
Your demise is all i seek
No rest will I take from the hunt
You'll live in fear every day
I will have my revenge
You'll die by my hand
Day by day I follow you along your path
Your allies felled by my steel
My hate is endless it knows no bounds
All of your lands are set ablaze
Once I've found you no mercy will I show
I will have my revenge
You'll die by my hand
Until I have your head
My sword will not sleep
I will dig your grave
into the shallow ground
The worms will feed upon the flesh
of your betrayal
Solo Clark
You will answer for your crimes
I will be your judge
As long as you still breathe
My sword will not sleep
I've shed much blood and tears
For years I did hunt you down
Vengeance finally mine because
My sword did not sleep <start> That's what you told me baby
That's what you told me baby

You drive me crazy
I thought I was the one
When we were together
You would take me to
Another place and time that I could feel free
You were all that I was searching for
That's just when I
I thought I could lean on you for life
I thought that the sun would always shine
But you took my dreams away
I remember the lies that you told me baby
One you told me you love me you need me
Two you told me you never deceive me
Three you told me you'd always be true
Four you told me we're through that's what you told me
That's what you told me baby
That's what you told me
Tell me was it fun taking my love for granted
Now I'm not the one
Everything we used to share has up and gone
I won't need to tell you you were wrong
That's just when I
I thought I could lean on you for life

Do you want to fly super high super dooper high no
Mistakes when I'm with you
Know exactly what I want to do
Lay you down and pursue me
I'm super fly 'cause I'm super high
When I'm by your side if you like girl tell me if you like

All they ever needed wanted.
They got a paradise to live in
Eden thrived and prospered.
Life was simple nature valued
Earth was giving the people willing.
Nothing was missing from human
generous was Mother Earth.
In the weak mind of Men jealousy gluttony took over
And all that they wanted was to own more.
Eden was violatedthe vicious corrupted city
Was swallowed up by the sea and disappeared
Mother Earth she looked at Eden
The exploited land vicious Men.
Took no pity for the city
Enforced a demise to the land
She roused the seas to rush to shores
Swallow all in Eden's doors.
The ingrate people and their city
Taking for granted everything
In the weak mind of Men jealousy gluttony took over
And all that they wanted was to own more.
Eden was violatedthe vicious corrupted city
Was swallowed up by the sea and disappeared <start> i have seen what it means
to detest and to care
and to outlive the dream of you and me
this has been a disease overtaking a new sense of being
pain staring from your eyes

strained too far this lie
the trust has been broken again
and this path will never lead
past the nightmare straight towards my grace.

Door bolted from the inside
Bedclothes ripped off
Tangled in bloodstained garments
Raw mass of human flesh
Once it was a woman
Cold blooded experiment
Deformed anatomy
Ears and nose had been ripped off the corpse
Pharynx torn
Facial features obliterated
Lower portion of the body
Including the uterus had been cut out
Removed and lacerated
On the table beside the bed
Like two pieces of meat... sickly placed
Those mounds of flesh proved to be the victims breasts
Symmetrically arranged
Her heart and kidneys
Bits of flesh hanging from picture frame nails
Ten weeks came to a climax
Killing number eight
Cruel bestiality <start> so stop pretending... that you know who I am and that you

Run now..to save yourself Run now..to take control Run now..to save your life Run now..its do or die Just run... <start> Questions they tear my head apart
Answers somewhere beyond the reach
Questions rise again
Arousing the doubts
The mortal way of life
Imposed upon us all
Is that our own device
Can the faith in Super Beings
Excuse all human lies
From the very first step that we take
We are a part of this strangest play
We're only watching our precious lives
Forever slip away
While lacking the strength
To face our weakness
Dare we take a chance
And take control
I have had enough
So leave me be
Im tryin' to understand
Why we can't be free
Of weak in ourselves
Roles we started playing once
Upon a time  will never fit the rhyme... <start> At your command
The dried darkness started
Gloating over the last
So marvelous banquet
Rummaged out by the laughter
Of desire
The ferryman stood up
And poured the blood on the table
A noise was made
God himself raised his tired eyes
And went worried away
Satan was looking avidly
Attracted woman with his eyes
And possessed one alive on the table
He laughed at gods
Laughed at their helplessness
He showed the beauty of his body
Changing into snake
He slipped between things
Gods couldn't spot that
Choked by immortality
It's a night of unification
And Satan laughed at their old age
He will give birth to
The god of one moment
Of one tear
Who having touched the blood
Will find death in it
He was full of contempt for another gods
But he suffered cause he knew
That his son who would never
Experience nether suffering nor joy
Would die having touched the blood
And there's plenty of blood everywhere
If you were a creator Sun
The Power would fall down before you
And children would fall down before you
And children would and the feast on they knees
In you were a creator Sun
You wouldn't have let gods to come to Earth
And tears are gathering together
And laughing at our weakness
And our subjection that resembles
The dog's subjection <start> By the light of the moon dark toughts rise up... they haunt my dreams
while the wind carries their voices and screams over the land
Awakened by sirens armed with the wrath of Gods we ride the storm may our rage defend creation
Under cover of darkness you raped innocent life
beneath the bleeding horizon your ends now justified
By the light of the moon dark thoughts rise up... now we haunt your dreams while the wind carries our warcries to your empires <start> So he came forth and said onto me
Son you are forsaken
Condemned for the sins that you live
I offer you forgiveness x
Bow down before me
I will never bow to he who claims to be divine
I'll tear down your gates with my bare fucking hands
And burn the world that you rule over
No matter how convinced you are you're not a god of mine
I never believed in you
From what I see it was justified
I never believed in you
In you
This power over the masses is a gift you don't deserve
When your blood spills we'll drink from your fucking skull
You can run you can hide
Bitch
I'll fucking find you
I'll tear your eyes out of your selfrighteous face
Lord
I'll fucking find you
I'll tear your tongue out of your rancid fucking mouth
Heaven will burn to the fucking ground
Your world will crumble and fall from the skies
Blood will spill and rain upon the earth
Your reign is over and I'll wear your crown
This is your demise
I know you feel it in your chest
This is your demise
It's getting closer
This is your demise
I'm creeping from the depths of hell
This is your demise
I know where you sleep
I never believed in you
From what I can see it was justified
I never believed in you
In you
What a way to end the world
With false hope in a false god
What a way to end the world
With false hope in you. <start> I play PacMan and I watch T. V.
I'm so happy 'cause it pleases me
I couldn't really ask for anything else
Maybe my own chain of Taco Bells
I'm perfectly happy right where I am
I could live forever in a traffic jam
It doesn't really bother me to breath the poison air
I'd choke anyway I don't really care
Sometimes I think about getting away for a while
But when I return I will be out of style
You may say I'm not an ambitious man
But let me tell you I've got some plans
Like there's a new car I wanna buy
And a video cassette recorder yet I'm not sure why
I wanna get married and have three kids
'Cause I'm lonely and I've got the hard dick
Commuter Man <start> Sleep brings no joy to me
Remembrance never dies
My soul is given to misery
And lives in sighs
The shadows of the dead
My waken eyes may never see
Surround my bed
That from which they sprung  eternity
Beneath the turf
The silent dead
Sleep brings no wish to knit
My harassed heart beneath
My only wish is to forget
In the sleep of death
Death is my joy
I long to be at rest
I wish the damp earth covered
This desolate brest
Beneath the mould
The silent dead
But the glad eyes around us
Must weep as we have done
And we must see the same gloom
Eclipse their morning sun
Oh not for them
Should we despair
The grave is drear
But they're not there
Their dust is mingled
With the sod
Their pale souls
Are gone to god
Well may they live in ecstasy
Their long eternity of joy
At least I wouldn't bring them down
With me to weep to groan
And what's the future
A sea beneath the cloudless sun
A mighty glorious dazzling sea
Stretching into infinity
My inner sanctum
R.I.P <start> i can't control my bloodlust anymore
there's no way back for me
after all these years of pain and oppression
my eyes are now to see
the maggot that you are and i'll crush you
i'll crush your cenotaph
my sympathy is gone
my conscience passed away
it died yesterday
for years you squeezed the hatred out of me
until it consumed me
and when the gates to my soul opened up
there was nothing but darkness
so I can't control my bloodlust no more
there's no way back for you
after all these years of pain and oppression
my eyes are now to see
my sympathy is gone
my conscience passed away
it died yesterday
i'd like to see you beg
i'd like to see you suffer
but you died yesterday
you always had me beg
you always had me suffer
the torment lies fresh in my memory
the scars will never heal
so you had to suffer the ultimate anger
that tore your soul apart
and I licked the freshspilled blood of my blade
the work is done
my sympathy is gone
my conscience passed away
it died yesterday <start> Pedant...Godhead...affix...madness. Immune me from all I see. Secure me in all I see. Pedant...Godhead...affix...madness. Immune me from all I see. Secure me in all I see.

On hands and knees she shallows divinity
Begging for forgiveness the blessing of a kiss
The essence of denial the pleasure of her sin
Father please embrace me
My lusts I lay unto thee
Free me from temptation
May you scourge this skin with the seeds of salvation
She's crying beneath an image
An image of a hundred thorns
Rivers that calm rivers that lie
Thorns like nails driven into her flesh
Ecstacy nailed to the cross
Holy water pouring on my breasts
On hands and knees I shallow divinity
A picture that calms a picture that lies
I'm drowning in the face of Jesus Christ <start> lGama mSalles
Whence does so much devastation come from
Deceit hatred delusions
Creating bonds of disunion.
All that will be left is a great loss. <start> The angel horde appears
In the horizon cloaked with shining white.
In thousands they came for the war
that would become the final battle and greatest of them all.
The trumpets of God they are blown
And the angels are pulling their swords.
What god's army did not know
Were that I had awakened the thirteen warlords.
Of hell.
The angels moved towards the fortress
Thinking they had a chance.
Their invasion started from the east
With soldiers carrying leather slings.
Running towards their own doom
Now in the eternal fire they forever are consumed.
The sun shall turn to darkness
And the moon into blood.
Before the great and terrible day
When my judgment comes.
Angel flesh impaled it is so beautiful.
Feathers falling down over the bloodstained ground.
The painful angels scream sweet music to my ears.
It's like a dream
Trucido Christianese.
Now the angels attacked with full force
But their front were slain with no remorse.
Angel's blood soon covered the ground
One thirteen was attacking from behind.
I strike upon them with all my hate
Soon they all know it is too late.
Realize they all will die
When my archers hatred are covering the sky.
With the ancients by our side
Without fear of god his army we stride.
If only the angels could tell
The pain that they felt when I released the flames of hell.
Angel flesh impaled it is so beautiful.
Feathers falling down over the bloodstained ground.
The painful angels scream sweet music to my ears.
It's like a dream
Trucido Christianize.
The sun will never rise darkness will rule supreme.
Our rightful throne reclaimed  years from this day.
The coming of our lord soon again he'll walk the earth.
It is like a dream
Trucido Christianize. <start> Lyrics M. Schulman
Blood grief destruction
Bullets agony terror
Desecration abomination despair
Welcomes the warlords of hell
A burning inferno
The sky has turned to red
Infernal armageddon
An era of devastation
A stream of madness
The mighty forces of war
Spread their wings of fear
Sow the flames of fury
Mesmerize the hatebringer
Release the hellfire twilight
The smokescreen unfolds
The reality is scattered
A wasteland of ash
From north to south from east to west
The kingdom once so proud
Was taken and conquered
The brigade moves on
Screams of anguish are left behind
Mesmerize the hatebringer
Release the hellfire twilight
Lead Kjellgren
Cruel ravishing slaughter
Like a horde of hungry wolves
Through seven days of terror
To endless nights of chaos
A burning inferno
The sky has turned to red
Infernal armageddon
An era of devastation
A stream of madness
The mighty forces of war
Spread their wings of fear
Sow the flames of fury
Mesmerize the hatebringer
Release the hellfire twilight
Lead Wiklund <start> A life of hate through trials of fate
Feel despair beckon for the truth
Suffering the fear of pain
Inside of me I cannot escape
Hidden feelings suffocation
Mental surge excruciating
Anger burns inside of me
As I live forsaken hatred
Time can't heal emotional scars
Brought to life by emotional scars
Illusion seen through eyes of fear
Trying to make this hell disappear
Hidden feelings suffocation
Mental surge excruciating
Anger burns inside of me
As I live forsaken hatred
Agony appeals to me
I can't escape the pressure
So I slowly fade away
Sanity tranquility
Pleading for the time
When my mind and soul are free
Life of pain and misery
I've chosen my path
I now await my fate
Infinite suffering
After forever will I still be me
Hate in my eyes is the way
Ridding myself of internal decay
Change is constant as I see
Permanent will never be
Clinging tight to the end
Is my life an eternal sin
Life I've seen now disappear
Drowning in a sea of fear
Reality fades away
Shattered life hate and dismay
Anger burns inside of me
As I die
Hidden feelings
Mental surge excruciating
Anger burns inside of me
As I live forsaken hatred <start> A deep lake of bitter silence
Surrounding the darkest side of hell
Savoring memories of blood
Emotions drowning in lust
Expanding senses constant pain
No more barriers to cross
Inflict the suffering on others
The world must face its loss
Hail the reptile behavior
Once crawling from deep seas
The eternal face of humanity
Infected by fatal disease
All the horror you indulge
All the pain you create
How can you escape your fear
When the object of fear is hate
Expanding senses constant pain
No more barriers to cross
Inflict the suffering on others
The world must face its loss
Satisfy all appetites
As they arise
Pleading ignorance
This is your hell
That's where you want to be
Satisfy all appetites
As they arise
This is your hell
Expanding senses constant pain
No more barriers to cross
Inflict the suffering on others
The world must face its loss
Satisfy all appetites
As they arise
Pleading ignorance
This is your hell
That's where you want to be
Satisfy all appetites
As they arise
This is your hell <start> You feel depressed 'cause you've missed the day

The cards that have been dealt to us
But who knows how long the chips will last
When I look back to see through
Can see right to the inside
What an ugly picture it is
The flames of remorse still blacken families
It's been told in so many tales
My smiles and my sorrows
Have gotten me this far
But not without the wounds
My smiles and my sorrows
Have gotten me this far
But not without the wounds that have scarred
Starting to think that I have lost
What is real

From the dark away to hit lights to hit that human light
One minute shape to hit time where you gonna go

Someone told me there is a war within
And the wor  d became flesh
Someone told me about a handmade sin
Denying all you once confessed
Don't bow to me
Don't worship me
We are torn apart by silver lunacy
Because weak I am
As weak as no man has been before
Don't you pray anymore...
And you will never be the same again

And you will never be the same again

Someone told me it is worth crying for
Any grace is built on lies
Making love with defiled angels

I saw the flesh divine
And the flesh became spirit

I can't believe

Shattered confessions
from your blue iced sky
sadless apprehension
of your frivolous mind.
Now I'm writing three or more words
for read my blurred right hand
I will lie again to god
to survive this morbid night.
Far away behold the shining star
even when you die
prepare your wings to fly
and free the dark desires.
Fear tragic fear
when I see my rotting hands
spelling the winds
when the clouds are much too light.
Missing my dreams
when I feel your gentle breeze
sleep after kill
In long tearless night.
Shattered confessions
from your blue iced sky
sadless apprehension
of your frivolous mind.

keeping blurred smiles
unholy way to die.

From the top of the hill where we don't go
And the stop where we claim our life our place forever

From the nights when the light stayed alive we shared
It took all these nights alone alone we are
Aurora don't leave me yet

 <start> Where Cold Wings Blow I  laid to Rest
I Can not reach my Rusty Weapons
the Blood and Sword that Guided my Path
for they Drowned in the Sands of Wisdom
I was indeed a King of the Flesh
My Blackened Edges still they were Sharp
Honoured by the Carnal Herds
but asketh thou Closed are the Gates
My Mind cut my Winged Weapons
and Teeth that was my Pride
And from the Forest all would hear
Wisdom Opens the Gate for the King
My Weapons Sighted  My Tears they Tasted
Summon my Warriors  To the Land of Desire
To the Domain of Hate  Where Cold Winds Blew
For Lust for Hell  We Rode with the North Wind
Only I could accomplish a fucken Selfdeceit
There are only Two Paths  the Mind or the Sword
And the Mind was Open like the Sights in a Dream
But the Sword was like a Stone around my neck
I Entered the Soul of the Snake
and Slept with the Armageddish Whore
 without my Throne and my Weapons
Where Cold Winds Blow became my Grave <start> I am lost in the black chamber
There's no way to turn back
It takes me down forevermore
And death would be so sweet
I'm possessed by the old creature
Who had planned all
To take my soul
Too late for me
In my hands
It liest I thought
But I failed
Now he's in me
My soul is lost
In his black chamber
I'm gone <start> I am the wind that tears your sails
The broken cross rejecting nails
I am the holy crucified
Yet sinful are my lusts and pride  I
I am ashes I am dust
I'm always held within disgust
Don't follow me for I mislead
Yet all these words you never heed  I
I'm the junkie with a gun
Pushing people's opium
Floating round the universe
I'm driving in my cosmic hearse
I'm intrusion I defy
I am immortal never die
I am to take you hell and back
The one to break you on the rack
Suffer torment anguish pain
I'll violate all your domains
I am lies and I am truth
I am the portent I am youth  I
I am the future and the past
Except the now which cannot last
I am Death Church I am peace
Yet never granting sweet release
My betrayal burns your pain
For I beget you you become me
You are betrayed
Yet you still want to play the game
You're victim you'll expire
Feeding life and all desire
Your life your pain
Searching for your eternal gain
Flesh is weak but still it calls
You who makes your own flesh crawl
Covet your soul
You will never have your own
Thoughts betray and falsify
Now You see that I am I <start> Deepest cold to ever grace the land of planet earth purest cleansing Hellfire to burn the mark of hell .
Hear my call
Deepest trace to ever possess minds of man purest noxious water to wipe out hordes and tribes.

Prepare for total soul rape
Ugliest work of death and horror ever seen by men.
Prepare for total soul rape <start> call you begging me to call you

i've been trying not to follow you

over it and over it
running with a hint of it
trying not to call it a sermon

bones on your windowpane

calling us opponents
soaking in a mixture of displeasure and monuments.

i've been trying not to swallow you whole <start> I see the golden roofs shining in the sun
I see stoned circles built up by strong men
Can you imagine the th continent
Buried in the deep sea down below
Can you see the mighty kingdom of old times
And the holy mountain rising up to the sky
For millenniums
We've been seeking for the truth
Enigma like a secret kept inside
Enigma turning darkness into light
Where it was where we're from
To where have all the things gone
Only time can tell enigma
Words from different places meaning all the same
World's source of wisdom an island without name
Language and religion from the same origin
Lying in the deep sea down below
Pillars of Heracles a gate to another world
Birds and eels still searching for their place of birth
For millenniums
A mysterious unknown land
Enigma like a secret kept inside
Enigma turning darkness into light
Where it was where we're from
To where have all the things gone
Only time can tell
Enigma like a secret kept inside
Enigma turning darkness into light
Where it was where we're from
To where have all the things gone
Only time can tell
Carved in marble pillars
In the ancient Egypt
Legends in cryptic letters
By Mayas and the Aztecs
For millenniums
Cultures give it different names
Enigma like a secret kept inside
Enigma turning darkness into light
Where it was where we're from
To where have all the things gone
Only time can tell
Enigma enigma
Where it was where we're from
To where have all the things gone
Only time can tell

The red death is taking them all
While the king and his court dance the night away
At the masquerade
The hour of midnight grows near
Masque of the red death
No one is safe from the poisonous plague
That you breed
Dance while you may in the dark of the room
With the stranger
Laugh while you may laugh at the danger
Is this a message from god
Or fate guiding hideous hands
Won't you show us your face
Masque of the red death
No one is safe from the poisonous plague
That you breed
Masque of the red death
No one is saved no one remembers your name
Your name
On and on one by one we fall
Into the bleeding arms of the stranger
Ripping the masque from your face
I feel your disease running
Through my veins
A new king of death threatens us all
Masque of the red death
No one is safe from the poisonous plague
That you breed
Masque of the red death
The price that you pay for your lust
May be your life <start> Feel under my skin these shivers run deeper than before
See it is so real now my heart beats faster can you feel it
Longing for the sun to bring it back to me once again
To eat it out the dark the pain
Longing for the sun I want to be free from this void rid of this void
This void is pain
See it is so wrong the dark is getting darker so hard to see
Feel empathy the art is so much harder than it seems <start> Condenados a vivir

A new warefare tool a larvae implement
Nuclear grown Super Larvae created to kill
Toxic maggots implanted against one's will
Project almost finished nearly completed
For research a human host is needed
Strapped in the lab and force fed a parasite
Inside my thorax the terror grows
A bio weapon to kill our foes
Government guinea pig forced to be
My abdomen now is a parasitic womb
The wriggling grub inside is my doom
My belly bloats as it gestates
The immense maggot within incubates
Bowels liquify into a matter so heinous
Blood and worms blow out my ripping anus
Absorbing body fluids this maggot sucks me dry
Inside my thorax the terror grows
A bio weapon to kill our foes
Government guinea pig forced to be
A human surrogate mother lying helpless
My sustenance nurtures it's metamorpisis
Inside my guts the pupa twists and turns
Form writhes and churns
In hunger and size it's grown rapidly
From the inside out I'm eaten ravenously
It bursts from my withered body into the world
A biohazard horror for warefare unfurled <start> Amongst the virulent and multiplying beauties of this southern land
lies a poison legacy for future generations to withstand.
We are curators of all earthly life united we must speak our minds.
The toxic byproducts of nuclear activities we can't rewind.
Morning iris at sunrise awakens to another day.
Your new world ever changing as you bloom you decay.
Future descendants of this time will never know a life of purity.
For our mistakes made in the era we have damned them to obscurity.
First we tear down the forests to retrieve that tainted ore
then we bury the outcome on an ancient ocean floor.
Wilderness of ancient land torn open by the greed of man.
Vulnerable tribes silently screaming in pain
the mining of ancestral soils are the deeds of the insane.
Most dangerous substance known to human dug up and spread all over the
land.
Earth tearing machines mine sickness from the ground
now for thousands of years no life will be found.
Once as pristine as creation now a human induced abomination. <start> Un Ange l'aile oblongue se penche

and I didn't care there was nothing left to lose
I couldn't find the sense of my life

and from the moment you've entered my world
you made me turn around
and you stole my heart away
but now you've gone
my life's just dark and grey
so here is what I say....
when the sun comes down
I'll be by your side
and when the evening's there
you'll be my princess of the night
time moves on and I can't make it stand
you never cared for me and you've just let it end
what have you done you've thrown it all away
and now my heart is empty nothing left to say
and from the day that you've captured my heart
you filled me up with love
you made my dreams come true
so now you've gone
there's no eternity
so here is what I say...
when the sun comes down
I'll be by your side
and when the evening's there
you'll be my princess of the night
let me take your hand
and lead you to the promise land
I'll be next to you
Cause you're my princess of the night

The curtain is about to fall
Ending mediocre life
Nothing to be proud of at all
Thinking back now
Despising yourself
Feelings oppressed
Always ready to bow
It wasn't real life
In fact just a play
From which you the actor
Got fired today
Your final walk down the hallway
No applauding masses in here
Not even dead and already forgotten
Your mind is filling with fear
Never any grip on situations
Your life just passed you by
And all the sudden it becomes clear
And insanity takes over now
You're not going out with a bang
You won't have your day
Your no longer wanted in this dull play
It wasn't real life
Never came close in a way
Your contract is over
Your finished today
And then you die
Part of a generation
Whose minds are all polluted
By the habit of consumption
No need to get a life
Everything's been taken care of
Your back bone is attached to strings
In the puppetplay you're part of <start> Lost far so long numbness gives in
Incarnated in wood
Young cold pure oh so perfect
Still my own beloved Velvet <start> The weatherman is calling
Calling calling
The weatherman's informing
Of a bright new day
There's no more gloomy weather
Forget that umbrella
No more diseases sneezing
At this century
The Dalek drones are drowning
We're flying we're climbing
Cars sit corroding
As we soar away
Waltzers on the rooftops
Are spinning with sidehops
Ugly concrete towers
Are now bright arcades

Oh weathercade

Hear them talking
These shoes will last forever

She's wanted. Wanted. Wanted. Wanted.
Sera derelict you're gonna tire
Black as coal. Wash her soul
Sera derelict come to trial
I'm strange but I'm sane
Won't play their game
Or lie. I'm sane.
Don't fear about it now
Feel your soul inside
Cuz I'm falling
I'm falling
Dug me up so long ago
Doesn't take a million arms to bind me
Tick tock we're calling
Tick tock the hammer's falling
Drag me down the corridor
No light will ever see me... or remind me
Well then she's sicker than we ever imagined
I'm strange but I'm sane
Won't play their game
Or lie. The same
Don't fear about it now <start> Seasons come and seasons go
Here I wait for something to be
Try to get as much as I can see
Hungry for life
But have you see the sands of time
Every day is a moment in past
Every heartbeat a step to my last
I won't survive
I don't know what time is made to be
If it is a friend or enemy or does it only run
Run to set and end
Secrets of a crazy dream or just a bad
Reality I don't know
Do you feel the sands of time
Runnin' low to break the line
First we learn to fly then we learn to cry
Later in the evening we will die
Questions roamin' through my brain
I'll be leavin' into a grave
I'll be dead but my soul will be save
For a time called forever <start> In oceans of light
Haunts the bleak river
Mindless spectre
Summons malice without thought
Chorus 
Insane paradox of dreams gone awry
Stalked and thrown onto funeral pyres
Yeah
The wrathful one
A screaming sea fould shore
Chorus
Sound without substance
Whispers softly and low
The waters speak and roar
Echoes in the skull
Each drop a human soul
Born from tragedy
Drowning victims amplify
Its desire to conceive
Chorus
Seek the lake of voices
Fluid chorus of loss
Destroyed in order
Created in chaos
Smothered 
Identity cast to the flow
Slave 
To waters illusion
Your body dissolves
Fettered 
Existence to the whole
Never break 
The walls between the realms
Flesh wound never bleed
But yearn for the depths
Agony theres no peace
Even in death
Dark wisdom brings power
An illusion deceived
Union of fellow souls
I wept as it entered me
Insane paradox of dreams gone awry
Stalked and thrown onto funeral pyres <start> Hook
 grand for my chain
Quarter mil' for my whip
 mil' for my house
Verse  Devlin
I think that I'm gonna be sick
It seems like every MC is about
Loves telling the poor they're rich
Then he wonders why they're getting rolled on when he wanna try and walk round in the bits
This is real life no thrills hype
On a reals it feels like
I've been impaled on a steel spike
But still fight for my girls and real guys in the real grind that write real rhymes
It's the boy next door that kicked down doors and I'm back on an ill vibe

Twenty pounds on my weed
Five pounds on my pint
No swagger at all just me
And I bet I can draw your wife
Comply with anything please
I'm gutter I'll do what I like
I had a pipe dream in the grime scene
Now I'm flying at withering heights
Hook
Verse  Devlin
Ten pounds for my cab
Some cheap wine for this skank
I'm streetwise you ain't  fact
I'll fleece guys you're getting wrapped
Outside of the East Side is where I'm at
Where fiends lie and make traps
For these sweet guys that flash
But when it's beats time it ain't that

These times I'm in the lab with terms
These guys are on a madness learn
No peace signs I'm gonna stab this verse
Just to kill it I'm able and willing
Rep for the boys the kids and the women
Tryna get by in the times that we live in
Tryna make a life and a living
Hook




Verse  Skepta
I never had it made it saved it
Spent it lost it gave it
To people who needed it more than me
Guys in the ends getting shanked for the P
More time I'm tryna show man the vision
But it's like man are still too poor to see
So I let man do their ting
I ain't judging anybody I don't wanna law degree
You see the rap lifestyle if you wanna live
Celebrities and the worthless riches
I ain't saying I don't want to make money
But right now I'm tryna do the right tings with it
If I eat food eat food in my crew
See me and Dev in a cinema near you
And when I pull up to the premiere
Don't ask why I ain't wearing a suit you're tired
Hook <start> Bloodied torn and twisted
Severe mutilation is all that remains
Stagnation in shrinkwrap
Empty the contents onto the mortuary slab...
The morbid muted body
Is dissected lacerated and shred
Life is hard as a mortuary technician
The fumes go straight to my head...
The trunk now depleted gristle with bactericidal decay
This discissed disarticulation I bludgeon as I ablate...
Diluted spittle bile and gore
Congealing puddles on the floor
Grotesquely dismembered
As the cavities I harshly sever...
Stabbing at the trachea chest walls I puncture
Slicing back flesh I tear subject to malacia...
Advanced rigor mortis the corpse internally bruised
Kaleidoscopic livor mortis the carcass a shade of livid blue
Joints are stiffened I now bend and crack
The cerebrum pulped with cranial collapse...
Bodily embalmed and fluids tapped
Maceration is oozing as the insides I unwrap...
Finished with the fragments a mass of stinking waste
Spreadeagled bloody mess I hastily eviscerate...
Advanced Pyathrosis  let there be rot 
Foul autodigestion  necrotic mutation...
The gaping chest is crudely stitched up
Internal organs are hastily replaced
The carnage totally disfigured
Another pathological waste...
Flowing blood crusts
The corpse is totally rotten to the core
The miserable festering stiff
I dismember with my saw...
The wounds are stitched I shabbily try to repair
Disintegrating with histolycis and everyday wear and tear...
Cadaveric dissolution sliced ripped and deceased
Eructated gases are gurgling as they bleed
Congested pus blood and autodigested gore
Tissue corrodes as aggression gnaws...
The mortuary table I now wipe sponge and clean
Washing away the remains of life the slab now gleams...
The evaporating reek of putrefaction gets right up my nose
Carnage chunks and leftover pieces in the bin I dispose...
Advanced pyathrosis  let there be rot 
Foul autodigestion  necrotic mutation... <start> My final request is for passion to stay.
I will pretend everything is sufficing.
This is one damned cold night.
The leaves are even shivering. <start> Dragged after the chariots In chains Of secret ways of fate Through desert sands
And burning waste I'll beat my chains into a sword Then from the shadow
I shall come forth With light and flame Under mist of stars Rip the night Reveal myself
No longer hid in darkened spells Rip the veil Reveal my crown No longer hid in darkened Shroud
This could be the kingdom of heaven This could be the kingdom of you
This could the kingdom of heaven Come true
Dragged after the chariots In chains Of secret ways of fate Through desert sands
And burning waste I'll beat my chains into a sword
Then from the shadow With light and flame Under mist of stars
Rip the night Reveal myself No longer hid in darkened spells Rip the veil Reveal my crown
No longer hid in darkened Shroud
His could be the kingdom of heaven This could be the kingdom of you
This could the kingdom of heaven Come true
 COBRA SOUL SPIRAL RISING THROUGH THE CHAKRAS 
Power of the secret fire Exaltation Morningstar rising Then from the shadow
I shall come forth With light and flame Under a crown of stars
This could be the kingdom of heaven
This could be the kingdom of you
This could be the kingdom of heaven

spheres. I awake within the land of beautiful
darkness. nocturnal love. theres no sun in shadows

along with the beasts and serpents nothing do I fear.
at one with the burning blackness. blood running
tears dark figures in the night. the black clouds in
the sky. whispers from the other side. theres no more
fear of the darkside. do you feel the sensations run
up and down your side look deep within you. see what
is in your shadowfilled heart. my ears hear the
masters call. screams of revelation and ending times.
the rights of law have been broken...broken. crying
tears of solar winds. a breeze of cryptic shrieks from
below...dying. a place of stunning sights. a place so
cold that no one knows. ive seen the days of
sorrowfilled ways. the passionate love of dusk. fear
in the weak minded fools. strong are the chosen few.
black are my ways in every move I make. I stand at the
temple of the moon. anointed king of the night. wears
the crown of swords. bestowed upon me. shadows land
and the infinite kingdom. <start> Cold rains of blood
Falling overnight
The persecuted mass
Is screaming of pain and despair
People running everywhere
The victory has begun
Unholy thoughts through deeds of wisdom
Human controlled intelligence
You're so corrupted so complex
Making miracles
As the gods you had created
Look at what you've done
A dying world still praising tolerance
I vomit on your beliefs
On your future mongrel faggots sons
I hate you all <start> Father with cruel intentions
Doesn't want the newborn
To come into this world
So he takes precautions
That can not bear the light of day
Chorus
Crash test foetus
Stomp and kick it around
Crash test foetus

From neck to cunt
Decimated family
They've become
Last screaming sounds
fill the room <start> Verlangen ist mein Wort
Endgultig meine Geberde
Verhermt is mein Blick
Gleichgultig meine Andacht
Dennoch erhebt sich Sehnsucht
aus tiefen dunklem Abgrund
mit der Urgewalt des Lebens

Ein schwarzgefiederter Vogel
tenzelt zart in der Brandung
ein letzter Sonnenstrahl
erhellt bleierne Dunkelheit <start> Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full never seems to change
Just labeled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep my friend and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says Rage
Sanitarium leave me be
Sanitarium just leave me alone
Build my fear of what's out there
And cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied it makes him well
He's getting better can't you tell
No more can they keep us in
Listen damn it we will win
They see it right they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell
Sanitarium leave me be
Sanitarium just leave me alone
Sanitarium just leave me alone
Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again. <start> A voyage through time and eternity
Through sorrows grief and pain
This fucking life  this fucking pain
An eternal plague of mine
This fucking life  this fucking pain
An eternal plague of mine
I soar in this level between life and death
Not knowing where I am heading
This total silence this total calm
Makes me wanna die
This fucking life  this fucking pain
An eternal plague of mine
Eternal death is calling my name
The world below awaits me
My life finally laid to rest
The world below awaits me
I soar in this level between life and death
Not knowing where I am heading
This total silence this total calm
Makes me wanna die
Eternal death is calling my name
The world below awaits me

You are not watching you're part of the show
You lost the first prize a long time ago.
WAR  somebody's always starts again
HATE  the seed is growin' in our hands
As time goes by

As time goes by.
Do you believe in money
Do you believe in guns
Do you trust the press babe
You'd better judge yourself.
The missiles are launching the tanks are rollin'
The guns are blazing the sky turns black
As time goes by
We never seem to beat the ones
Who say we can't be free
As time goes by
We're getting closer to the end of our ability
As time goes by
Is there a place to run for shelter in a high tech war
As time goes by
Can you believe and trust in God
To help you from above. <start> I wish I was free of this
I see her in my dreams
Wish that she wasn't there
But she still haunts me and I
Still feel her breath on me
Still want to taste her skin
But I know that won't kill me
Now
Still I choke on her lies
Still from her last caress or goodbye
Now all this sickens me
This
I can't erase this from me
And now
And everything I feel
The end of our sick
Now
Still I feel my strength hurt
To pick hold my head high
Now
Still I choke on her lies
I rewrite my song
Still I feel my strength hurt
To pick hold my head high
Still I choke on her lies
I rewrite my song
I wish I was free of this <start> Never relent
Throw yourself
Never relent
Through yourself to the future

Begins with a guarantee
And mercury
It ends in retrograde
It's just
Bleeding me dry
So don't even try to say goodbye
Resentment
Yes I harbor some
So don't even try to say goodbye
This is not over now
I'm far from down for the count
I hear it beckoning now
I'm far from down
Come out full guns blazing
I'll never forget
I may forgive tomorrow
I'll never forget
The years of sorrow
This blood moon
Begins with a guarantee
And mercury it ends in retrograde
This time it ends in retrograde
I can hear it beckoning
I'm far from down for the count

Come out full guns blazing
This is
Not over now
I'm far from down for the count
I hear n beckoning now
I'm far from down
Come out
Full guns blazing
Hell raising
All guns blazing
The powers at be
The faces of God
Are a oneway mirror
As we hover above
Mangled tangled
A oneway mirror as we hover above
This is
Not over now
I'm far from down for the count
Come out full guns blazing
This is not over now
I'm far from down for the count
I hear it beckoning now
Am far from down
Come out full guns blazing
Hell raising

Hatred more spite than any other
Gutless dying victims
Hollow shells empty lives
Lifeless lives <start> If anyone had told me you would be my girlfriend
And I would be your man
There's not a chance that I'd believe it
Cause look at who you are and look at who I am
But the first thing that you taught me
Is like things like that shouldn't matter
We should look much further
Cause you don't love what you see but what's inside uhoh
And when I reached inside to feel your love
I could not believe how much there was
And so I had to give to you
The rest of me to match your love...
And so...
I guess I'm lost in you can't stop loving you
Just believe it you know I mean it
Loved you from the start owner of my heart
Guess I'm lost in you guess I guess i...
If this is just a dream
Then leave me alone let me sleep
Don't disturb me please no
I wanna stay right here forever
Where love can't be denied
'cause you're right here by my side
Each time I reach inside to feel your love
I believe in what I touch
And I give to you the rest of me and match your love
And so...
I guess I'm lost in you can't stop loving you
Just believe it you know I mean it
Loved you from the start owner of my heart
Guess I'm lost in you guess I guess i... <start> The brightest full moon light entrances me
It calls me forth
Yet I have not the strength to move
In stasis I rot away and dream
Dream of forgotten years
Dream of the touch of another's hand
I am to be a meal of starved worms
My nerves are twisting for the light of my salvation
I rest beneath where I remain as cold as clay
Eternal pain is swelling in my joints
Somewhere within me a flame is slowly born
Inside this shell of bloated flesh grows life anew
Infernal the moon distorts my mind
My veins jolt back to life pushing the fluids of the damned
I seek to bathe my fetid flesh in crimson spray
My body writhes without consent of conscience
I lift the lid the pounds of dirt shall not subdue
I shall walk the earth once more
From beyond the strings are pulled
I know not what has made me this way
The animation of my rigid corpse
I shall abandon my coffin of premature fate
All the words of the preacher
All the tears of my family in vain
I shall again walk amongst them
My penance with blood be repaid
Repaid
Dead hand grasps for the still night air
I am now free to maim
There cannot be a god for he would not forgive this
Despicable inhuman monster rotten twisted and deformed
I am now a tool of my unholy instinct
Entrails strewn at my bidding
A mockery of all I was
I seek to bathe my fetid flesh in crimson spray
My body writhes without consent of conscience
I lift the lid the pounds of dirt shall not subdue
I shall walk the earth once more
From beyond the strings are pulled
I know not what has made this way
The animation of my rigid corpse
I shall abandon my coffin of premature fate
All the words of the preacher
All the tears of my family in vain
I shall again walk amongst them
My penance with blood be repaid
Repaid <start> Some say a storm is coming
Some say the end is near
Some think it's all so hazy
I think it's all so clear.
If it all ends tomorrow
If it all disappears
Where do you think you're going
Anywhere else but here
I don't claim to have the reasons
All I know is if the world stops spinning tomorrow
I'd never shed a tear
I'd rather be anywhere anywhere
Anywhere but here
Some say they have the answers
Some say they know the truth
Some people live in question
Some people have no clue.
If there was no tomorrow
If there was just today
Would you make different choices
Or would you stay the same
I don't claim to have the reasons
All I know is if the world stops spinning tomorrow
I'd never shed a tear
I'd rather be anywhere anywhere
Anywhere but here
If there was no tomorrow
If there was no tomorrow
If there was no tomorrow
Would you stay the same
If there was no tomorrow
If there was no tomorrow
If there was no tomorrow
Would you stay the same
If the world stops spinning tomorrow
I'd never shed a tear
I'd rather be anywhere anywhere
Anywhere but here
If the world stops spinning tomorrow
I'd never shed a tear
I'd rather be anywhere anywhere
Anywhere but here <start> MusicAlbert Maroto
Lyrics Elisa C.Martin
When I pray
I kneel down in front of you
And I think ....
Where are you I can't see you
And I feel so weak
I don't trust your white tears
Have you left me now
You were never with me...
It's alright to make mistakes
I'm only human
The mortal one
Who lives fulfilling your laws no thanks
I would like to ask you God
When I die where I should go
Into ashes will my soul turn
Where is your blue paradise
If there's an eternal life...
Why don't you bring this life here
Born to die
This sensation is so strange
Born to die
To live fulfilling your laws... no thanks
If you want I'll try to save you
But to save me from all your lies
You've always believed in my truth
In your stupid Holy Bible
Also in your famous saying
I am the path the truth and the life
Everything you say I distrust
Can you prove me now that you are real <start> coversong of DESTRUCTION released never before <start> Charge
I'm a fucking soldier
Just like I told ya
While I'm just warming up
You're getting colder
Out on the battleground
Let's take a look around
Well there's a million of us ready to throw down
They'll never take me alive
In the pit
Blood on the bricks
Don't look back 'cause I got your six
Won't go down never gonna quit
Don't turn back 'cause I got your six
You know I got your back
They'll never take that
Until the bitter end
You know I'll never crack
I'll face an army
Can't fucking harm me
Out on the front line
That's where you'll find me
They'll never take me alive
In the pit
Blood on the bricks
Don't look back 'cause I got your six
Won't go down never gonna quit
Don't turn back 'cause I got your six
I will never accept defeat and I will never quit
I got your six
I got your six
In the pit
Blood on the bricks
Don't look back 'cause I got your six
Won't go down never gonna quit
Don't turn back 'cause I got your six
In the pit
Blood on the bricks
Don't look back 'cause I got your six
Won't go down never gonna quit
Don't turn back 'cause I got your six <start> I hold you in like a deep breath.
Feel you like the last beautiful touch before a final rest.
I know I'll see you forever.
I want it painted black and red.
It's so beautiful to me it's everything I see.
It's so beautiful to me but it's nothing that I need.
And I can't taste anything less.
Every time I'm forced down.
To be with yourself take all the blood you want.
But not from here.
It's so beautiful to me it is everything I see.
It's so beautiful to me but it's nothing that I need.
Not a hand not a finger.
This is my home.
I'm dying here.
I hide in the corner.
That look on your face I'm accustomed to it. <start> I get up to see you wallow in defeat

I get down with almost everybody I meet except you

And I fail to see why I should care
That you have had  years of pain to share
Did what I did what I did for you
You've got the best of me
Did what I did for you
You've got the best of me
I get up to see you look perpetually

I get down to watch you fail spectacularly

Oh boy and I fail to see why I should care
That you have had  years of pain to share
Did what I did what I did for you
You've got the best of me
Did what I did for you
You've got the best of me
Did what I did what I did for you
You've got the best of me
Did what I did for you
You've got the best of me
Mama Mama <start> M Cryonic Temple L Johansson
The soldiers are blue and the indians are red
We're fighting so hard just to keep up our heads
Shooting and killing is all that we know
We are all unknown
Running trough smoke with the fear in my eyes
See all the soldiers they stare at the skies
They are all dead but I'm still here alive
I will never die
Slow... here I go...
I stand so tall....
I stand so tall I will not grow old
I hear the song the warsong
I face the truth with the blind and the fool
We hear the song the warsong
Blinded by glory I'll keep up the fight
Trough darkness I go and I've got you in sight
Pulling the trigger you are out of the game
I don't feel ashamed
Trough darkness and wind fire and rain
I am going without feeling the pain
I am the last and I can't see the light
Killing is my right

Repeat chorus <start> I wait confined within the walls of anger waiting to explode bottled up i soon implode. Suppressing rage eats away dissolving my mind anf its more more than i can take. And soon my  ignites soon i will explode  the cause i do not know  it knows no other wrath  stay out of my damage path. Rising boiling boiling boiling up inside i feel no pity for them they were raised upon lies. Though cheating force feeding the bow to the alter of a plastic god.
Through cheating lies and corruption comes my agression  ignited soon i will explode  the cause i do not know  it knows no other wrath  stay out of my damage path. All of you will learn to respect me never ever will you neglect me. All of you will learn to respect me never ever will you neglect me.

tears in my eyes can't you see
dreamin' of a love that cannot be.
In the darkness of my mind
first start laughing then start crying
and the pain in my heart now makes me blind.
Breakin' breakin' my lonely heart for you
you're living in the dark
but your smile survives in me
memories of you yesterday you were laying in my arms
while now I cry alone and you're buried in the dark
Now I wait for your return
how long must I cry and mourn
but now I know that you can live again.
In the darkness where you rest
I will fight against death
'till fate will bring you back here to me.
Breakin' breakin' my lonely heart for you
you're living in the dark
but your smile survives in me
I never thought this could be truth is I really can't believe
that your light no longer shines 'cause you're living in the dark <start> By the perception of illusion we experience reality.
Champs of oppression
Devils of mine
The youth of tomorrow
 to find
Reanimate reanimate
Corroded minds

We're all so blind
Chorus
Terminate the feelings pressures of life
Search for something you just can't find

Living heads
I feel the knife
Swift precision.
Come alive
Whisper youth

Your all eternal
Buried inside
See your face
Perception lies still
Time to choose
A new kill
 of oppression
 of fear
A new stage of silence
I see it clear
I feel no pain
I feel no pain


I feel no pain
Beyond the realm
Melted bodies
Twisted in ruins
Calm deceit
The city of death
Reanimate reanimate
Reanimate your fear
I feel no pain
Feared existence
A crippled back
I feel no pain
The pain on my back
Reanimate reanimate
Reanimate your fear
I feel no pain
I feel no pain

You can't say that I haven't tried
I still feel your love
This must be all that I've got
I've learnt so much with you
I know how I'm gonna take it
Please don't leave me now
Hear me stay a little longer
After dark you're close to me
You are an angel as I can see
Another day by your side
Is enough for me to die in peace
I live in sadness
You are the dark
I live in sadness
You are my darkness
I see you before I die <start> Want cocaine call boy

are symphonizing their way
through your weary head
To feed your distrust
And fill it's mouth with the desire
to soulfully be one with your creation
Not a subject to control
you call upon a higer power
for help and inspiration
The crowd waits
and turns their faces
towards you expectantly
you give them what they need
But their useless criticism
makes you die
a bit more inside
Not a subject to control
you call upon a higer power
for help and inspiration
Oh I swoon
while loudspeakers play soft music
Leaning
over your fourtieth masterpiece
You must have loved
the colour of these violins
I wish I knew you
Your fit of insanity makes me sad
I wish you knew
your music was to stay forever
And I hope...
I have no clue
if you know how much it matters
And I hope... <start> Music S. Drover G. Drover
Lyrics S. Drover
Watching  as the rain keeps falling down
Waiting  for the pain to knock me down
Malign indifference  frothing at your peace and glory
The naked truth  fishhooked in your halostory
The grand illusion  will you take me to the life you've chosen
When all else fails  will you follow me to mine
Subjected to your deity
Now dejected from society
Detained in hypocrisy
As you pull the trigger  and fail
Doubled over  from the pain you've put me through
Misguided memories  I've suffered onto you
Preach your peace  a world of cold distrust
Inept in solitude  now wince in cold disgust
To keep me locked away  attempt's to no avail
Destruction of my soul  your life I now assail
Subjected to your deity
Now dejected from society
Detained in hypocrisy
As you pull the trigger  and fail
Solo  Glen
Compassionate state  is a grand mistake
I am fixed to you  my rage is blazing
You've captured me  at anall time low
My heart in apt to release
To keep me locked away  attempt's to no avail
Destruction of my soul  your life I now assail
As lies fizzle away  true sickness revealed
My life will go on  your test has failed
Subjected to your deity
Now dejected from society
Detained in hypocrisy
As you pull the trigger  and fail <start> Welcome to the reign of the ashes
Welcome to the hunt.
Welcome to the master's palace
Welcome home my son...
A secret lies forbidden
I'm trapped in dismal thoughts
An unknown reign is hidden
Prevailed by unknown lords.
Don't pray to images of other Gods
An order I was taught.
Seclude my memories of the past
When legends had been told.
The book of blood has prophesied
The return of death on earth
The sky turns black as I realise
What my religion is worth.
Absorbed in hellish thoughts... Black literature.
The Bible is lost... Black literature.
Reinstatement of my senses
I believe in Jesus Christ.
Reawakening of the vengeance
I will devastate his might.
Put the beast to the tempter
Dismembered is my innocence
Damned is my belief.
I see the unbelievable
I feel its dreadful heat.
I damn the day when I was born
A child  Wrath in his veins
Confronted with strategic lies
That slowly filled my brain.
A scriptural passage dies... Black literature.
Awaiting the arise  Of God
A scenery of feelings
False freedom in my heart.
No hope no chance of healing
Happiness is past.
Reinstatement of my senses
I believe in Jesus Christ.
Reawakening of the vengeance
I will devastate his might.
Religion is a curse... Black literature.
Defending my believe... Black literature. <start> A code embedded deep within
Encrypted in vaults of bone and skin
A tug magnetic toward the dark.
The wolf voracious
Hath witnessed it's mark.
Internal pressure growing behind your eyes is mounting still.
Constant thoughts of evil are coming to a head inside you.
Humanity decreasing blood is strong upon the passing winds.
To forsake would be a sin let the night entrance you.
You'll feel the pull of the moonlight equilibrium.
Pitch black transmission of the soul.
Instincts from within rise
We're all but beasts that hunger from inside.
Cannot escape this longing.
These symptoms don't remit for death becoming sick.
The long hairs feel them stand the nigh tworld calls again.
Your existence turning black there'll be no coming back.
A desire to tear and hack it's growing lord please help us
You'll feel the pull of the moonlight equilibrium.
Pitch black transmission of the soul.
Instincts from within rise
We're all but beasts that hunger from inside.
You must subdue this yearning to feast
That very eve the devil cameth
And his will did force thine idle hands.
Open this heart of molten darkness
Floweth foul rivers of the damned.
Blood of the lycan within thee enthroned.
Heir to the cosmic fathers unknown.
Who traileth not far from where death would increase.
Seek they to murder to rid the world clean.
A curse by the ancients of bloodline befouled
The clouds they are parting the moon has come out
Internal pressure growing behind your eyes is mounting still.
Constant thoughts of evil are coming to a head inside you.
Humanity decreasing blood is strong upon the passing winds.
To forsake would be a sin let the night entrance you.
You'll feel the pull of the moonlight equilibrium.
Pitch black transmission of the soul.
Instincts from within rise
We're all but beasts that hunger from inside.
Cannot repress these urges to kill
To taste the red your only will
There's no salvation. <start> Life a losing battle
Existence I abhor
Lives condemned by sins
of those who lived before
Distraught depressed
World of confusion
Victory of death
The only solution
Every day is agony
My thoughts are so unclear
To face the harsh reality
There's no one I endear
Distraught depressed
World of confusion
Victory of death
The only solution <start> Sad melody sounds in my heart
I await endlessly for the non existent pictures
I cannot forget the awakening time
when the heat was burning in my hand
I don't name you because you drown
far from my knowledge but I want to believe
that you exist somewhere beyond the time
again you imprison me when the dusk comes
I know every thought you hide
I cannot believe in the words of goodbye
when the heat was burning in my hand
they roar like the waves leaden by the inspiration
I reveal all secrets but again you leave
when the dawn comes I tear the golden dreams
where no one dreamed of real dreams
I can remeber the roar of the waves
and the roar of the storm
I wanted to keep the fragile moment
but looking for freedom
I picked up the flower of longing <start> Monument Cover
Bonus Track <start> here all our wounds can heal
scars and blisters disappear
were safe just as long as we stay
in this cocoon I melt away with you
oh yeah in this cocoon no one can disturb
our dreams our eternal sleep
yes here love takes root and it grows
adrenaline and dopamine begin to flow
were one just as long as we stay <start> After the smoke has left
And the fire has burned down
He leaves his hideaway
And through ashes he goes
There are just ruins left
What once was his realm
He falls on his knees
And raises his hands up high
I will remember the fire
Day of the dragon's feast
I will remember the fire
I seek to kill the beast
His burden he will bear
Oh dragon beware of him
He will hunt you down
And for the search he leaves
For his hordes you've killed
He demands you to pay
And for the blood you've spilled
He'll strike your life away
I will remember the fire
Day of the dragons feast
I will remember the fire
I seek to kill the beast
Walking a thousand miles
Through forests fens and thorns
Hate is gnawing at his soul
As he inquires on
How far he has to go
Will his search never end
Until his last breath's done
He's searching on and on
I will remember the fire
Day of the dragons feast
I will remember the fire
I seek to kill the beast <start> 

Verlangen ist mein Wort
Endgltig meine Gebrde
Verhrmt is mein Blick
Gleichgltig meine Andacht
Dennoch erhebt sich Sehnsucht

Ein schwarzgefiederter Vogel
tnzelt zart in der Brandung

erhellt bleierne Dunkelheit <start> The black iris devours pictures in silence
The image of devils light my consonance

Dead all flowers and so are we
Silent moves of the summer flies
Engraved clouds below divided skies
Insect influx the scent of the dogs
My sweet flower and insect on the cross

Darkly wise odour of the evil tongues
Odious and devious
I despise
Jinx of eden
Black paradise
Lips of times of secret
Murmur evil sprouts
Purges the redeemer

Injected by silence
Last breath of nails
Needles and icons
The eye of consolidation
The I of consolation
Taste the lips of ancient pleasures
Eat the fruit of darkly treasures
Chorus <start> A fork is a cold shiny tool
To pierce tear and ingest
Whoever has the fork in hand
Controls the meal of its choice

They're for our own good
Better carved up in pieces

Flies by night on stolen fuel
To Santa Rosa CA
Opens a fake employment office
Want a job Go get me drugs
People desperate for work
Return to quite a surprise
Busted for intent to sell
Cops pay him a bounty
Forkboy skips town
Agh Agh Agh Agh
We came
We peed
We conquered
You bleed
The choice
Fork Boy
Or Finger Food
Ugly joy
What does it replace
Why wait
When you can eat yourself alive today
Junk bondage takeover glutton
Ready to bore in
Unfold his rotary blades inside
Pull the guts out and resell them
Buys out his next target
With the last one's pension funds
Thousands more thrown out of work
So Leona won't have to settle for a mint
Forkboy
Picked by the FBI
To be the black pied piper
After Dr. King died
Watches soap operas on TV
While  billion's disappears from HUD
Who are you working for
What did you hope to gain
Why do you hate your past
So much you destroy the ones you love

ALTARUS
Gaze deep into the mists with your spiriteyes Xerxes...
look far and tell me what you see.
XERXES
I see a land far to the north...
a vast empire of dark endless moors and snowcrowned mountains...
a land of brooding citadels and warriorkings who hail to grim gods.
ALTARUS
Look well Xerxes for enlightenment hides
within the fogswathed vales of Hyperborea...
THE KING'S DREAM
By the onyx sceptre of my forefathers
the air is churning with auguries of dethronement...
Impending dread thus prophesized
In a dream I was bade ride
the argenteyed unicorn to the Ring of Stones...
There a torrent of viscid slime assailed me
as pipes and horns sang the clarion of my dissolution...
And the usurpation of my ancient azure throne.
Assassins stalk the nighted halls of my palace...
poisoned blades and chalices surround me.
I thirsted for a balm but my thirst
was slaked by an envenomed draught.
My swordarm shackled by tendrils of sloth...
enthralled by the chasmed gloom...
Borne upon wings of labyrinthine dread...
I awaken
I shall seek the counsel of the sorcerer
keeper of the ancient scrolls of wisdom
and the Crystals of Power...
THE WORDS OF THE SORCERER
My liege great and regal king...
the mists disclose their secrets...
you are destined to wield a great dark power.
Drink deep of the potions of the apothecary
for upon thee now I bestow a shard
of the mystic Crystal of Mera...
sacred artefact of the At lantean mages
won in battle by our legions.
My liege the Crystal of Mera shall unveil the truth
lurking hidden in thy most feverhaunted dreams...
THE VOICE OF THE HARBINGER
The land awash with spilled blood
and viscera torn forth from the sundered dead...
Gorge the earth with flesh
darkened with the claw and fang of war...
rent open the ravenous maws of worms...
THE KING
The Crystal illumines dark secrets the truth is known...
a dire and ancient threat is ranged against me.
Hearken the clarion is upon the winds
now the call to arms is upon us all
Grim warriors take up thy spears and hone thy gleaming swords.
Archers string thy bows brave knights saddle the steeds of war
The glory of battle is nigh at last
our banner shall fly this day in victory
My warriors a legacy shall this day be wrought
by our blades decreed by the gods
Blessed by the blood of vanquished foes.
Our destiny beckons...
LORD ANGSAAR DARK LIEGE OF CHAOS
Come great king of Hyperboria march against me
with your splendid legions and shimmering swords.
I the Bane of the Atlantean Kings the Scourge of Lemuria
Archfoe of the Immortals of Ultima Thule shall Crush you
I shall visit a thousand plagues upon your realm
and wreak untold havoc and bloody carnage
until I have your throne... and your soul
ALTARUS
And thus flanked by the splendour of azure banners
a vast army marched forth from the great walls
of the Imperial City of Hyperborea
and at the forefront of the mighty legions
astride an ebon warstallion rode the king
sunlight glinting up on his splendid armour...
compelled by dreams and guided by the Crystal of Mera...
XERXES
Where Where did the king's path take him
ALTARUS

XERXES
But master what powers did this blade possess
What secrets did it hold
ALTARUS

XERXES
Then there looms such a cataclysmic battle
ALTARUS
And so from his Black Citadel the Chaosliege did send
forth his Horde of Wraiths to engage the army of the king...
THE KING
Behold a legion of undead fiends meets us upon the field of war.
Face me Scourge of Lemuria I wield thy bane the ShadowSword...

Hearken the clarion is upon the winds
now the call to arms is upon us all
The glory of battle is nigh at last into the fray we ride
XERXES
The outcome master...
who left the field victorious
Did the king prevail
ALTARUS
The mists begin to disperse... for now the images fade.
That tale shall have to wait 'til another day... <start> Chorus

A journey through my mind
Beyond the wheel of time
To the darkness 'hind my eyes
All those years in vain I fled
My fate I tried to escape
Lost my cause from the start
Bridge 
Falling freely
On wings of will
My fate was sealed from the start
Bridge 
Crying my pain
For your sake
For love that never fades away
Chorus
Mindless like a pawn
Misleaded by darkness
Shadows mere memories
Of time that could have been
Silently I face you
Believing once again
In my fate  Chosen One
Solo
Bridge  <start> Instrumental <start> These are the debit souls. Force fed notions of nation and bearing rags of sovereigns yet to fall. They play servant to lines in the sane. They are the shrapnel embedded in the womb of history and of all time to come. Wartorn is the unborn the undead martyr. The life long crucifixion. <start> Charging forth through endless battles bravely ahead
Overtop of enemy lines and into the fire
Choking clouds of mustard gas sears their eyes
We march through the endless fray to victory or death
Charging through the slaughter
Nobly born meet their fate
Courage in their victory before destiny
Supply lines feed the endless tide
As despotic soldiers March toward our treasured sites
Symbiotic decay strips of flesh melt away
As a choking pallor of death with our victory
Descends
Headlong into the smoking ruin
Armored artillery ride
Unexpected biological mean to cease the enemies' stride
Flesh burns...
Radiological waves
Biological strains

Death down from the skies

Mechanized infantry
Air cavalry
Dead in their tracks all have died <start> Swallow me whole
Make me learn don't need me
Crush my soul make me feel
How can I see hope
When I never see my light
I'm empty inside <start> In a plkce where no shadows fall
I will meet you again
Below the moon and the stars
Where it all began
Where no shadows fall
We will meet again
Where no shadows fall
Where it all began
We all feel the presence
Of our destiny draw near
In this place where no shadows fall
We will have to surrender to our fears <start> It's buried deep within the past and I
Hope it doesn't last

I try to give it all away but it's never going to fade

I know you feel it's all the same
But I promise that I'll change

You know I'm trying to believe
That you're never going to leave

There's nothing left
The fear is gone
Chorus
And when my heartstrings come undone
I will wait for you pray for you
Before I make my final run
I will stay with you decay with you
I know I'm not the perfect one
And this pain has just begun

You bring me to a better path
And it's everything I lack

If you fade out without me
Will you know all about me
If you fade out without me
Will you know all

Asleep for years in the silence they wait
the hour when chaos will come
the stones of freedom
One for every land
for a thousand years their power awaits
now it will soon rise
for Osyrhia's freedom will shine again
Asleep for years in the silence they wait
the hour when chaos will come
the stones of freedom
Guardian stones

sacred fire of a divine hand

There's no borders to be found.
Mankind under the same sun
Evolution never stopped
The empires fell apart
They all will rise and fall
Creations survived the time
The ones built by us all
Child of time born in the new dimension
You are sent to find the key into the past
Make them see that all their true beloved ones
In a time to come had love to conquer all
After twenty centuries
There was thousand years of peace
Mankind changed the history
And left hatred far behind <start> Selling dope and other shit <start> No voice no singing
I call at the distance.
Only like sad whaleos songs resound from dark fog
Mournful the soul lacerating lamentations.
Only the silent wind this one my tears dries up.
Only deep silence is music of my heart
Which entwines by roots and thorns of grief
Dies hopelessly slowly and acerbly.
In clutches of anxiety flourishes in my soul the grief.
The rain of suffering fills up my eyes by paleness.
And I deaden by merciful cruelty
I'm condemned the joy to reprobate.
My soul and heart now dance in convulsive
Inebriation from feelings and moods of this dream.
My life is only the shade of sorrow.
Is only the pang the garden of woe and sadness
When the love like shadows in light disappeares
In the light of endless darkness and gloomy nightly visions.
No voice no singing... <start> Bastards of madness
Call out this prayer of vengeance
Speaking to enemies through these wounds of redemption
Tearing out their eyes with horror
Behold this chosen new devise
As the silence pleads this forgiveness
A senseless begging for absolution
Upon this entrance into oblivion
This fallen angel of defiance destitute to isolation
Hold tight to liberation in the form of reprisal
Project of this restored frame in these pain filled alterations
This new threat of changing life restless in this completion
Powerless you crawl like pigs
Soon to be slaughtered
Suckling to a faith that you avidly hoped would save you all
These offerings will bring us our justice.
For these years of diluted lies
The answers to our freedom
The answer to the death of Gods
These hands held into the sky so the dark
Winds can taste the blood of murder
As the blackest hearts obey thoughts of evil
Deathlorn rites endure the lust for revenge
Surrender the state of embracement and release
This life from the dark interiors
Discomfort of this assisted torment is given in these regards
A scourge of awakening
Prisoned in the rites of blood
Bestowed with ancient plagues we will forge a disease
Of rape upon your ideals
Within this lifeblood we will find the truths as blades
Slice open their necks
The answers to our freedom
The answer to the death of Gods
Once reconstructed the swarm will digest
The souls of this imperfection
Sterilizing faith bringer has discharged
This assembly of this damnation
Burden me with your weak
Curse me with your sick
In blood filled walls I lie confined
Carving out the blind eye of God <start> I will stand tall like an unconquered mountain
Like an integrated fountain in the South
If I fall I'll make my country proud
I won't let this flag touch the ground
'Cause it's a part of me
Free like an Eagle I will spread my wings
And embrace this American dream
Like a soldier's last breath
Like the heart in my chest
You are part of me you are part of me
Freedom don't you take it for granted
Ask someone who ain't had it what they think
And reasons as if you needed one
I'll give you one million if you need
'Cause it's a part of me
Free like an Eagle I will spread my wings
And embrace this American dream
Like a soldier's last breath
Like the heart in my chest
You are part of me you are part of me
In a single moment in our darkest hour
When our flag was burning
A top that second tower
In every living room there was living proof
Of the price we paid for freedom
Free like an Eagle I will spread my wings
And embrace this American dream
Like a soldier's last breath
Like the heart in my chest
You are part of me you are part of me <start> i've got my back against the wall my face against your fist
my brain confronts my feelings as my stomache starts to twist
adrenaline is pumping and my head is one big mess
as i try to come to terms with my own anger and distress
that's when the first blow hits me and my head goes flying back
it bangs against the concrete and i hear when my bones crack
i raise my hands to gaurd my face cos' i'm too scared to run
i try to scream out in despair and that's when next blow comes
the second time you hit me the pain just disappears
and all i feel is my frustration as my motivation clears
there's no way i'm gonna let you bring me down without a fight
and so i raise my arms up and i clench my fingers tight
the first time that i hit you your eyes look so suprised
you didn't think i had it in me you just stand there paralyzed
i'm not gonna be your victim and it's time for you to learn
and so i turn my feelings off and then i'm at the point of no return
i know that there's no turning back from here
there aren't any bridges left to burn
so instead i do the opposite of everything i've ever learned
i'm at the point of no return
the second time i hit you i know your going down
i can see your body shaking as you fall towards the ground
you try to keep your balance and you try to stand up straight
but when the blood runs down your face you know that it's too late
you know i'm gonna hit you with one third and final blow
and i don't even fucking care if i can sink this low
cos' there isn't any logic when the anger starts to burn
and with your back against the wall
you stand there at the point of no return <start> Deranged as I may be
Some won't completely understand
You love the monster that is me
I'm garbage baby
That's just what I am
Chorus
Garbage truck 
Straight from hell
Left for dead
A broken mess
Stabbed molested with a gun
See the scars across my chest
I'm damaged baby
Yea you better run
Chorus
Straight from hell 
Chorus <start> The process never wavers for you
The agenda is clear.
Feed on your precious fictitious glide
Nothing's ever true for you.
Stain your kin with decisions
A thought for you to review
Can't find a frame large enough
Built to surround the  of you.
It's coming moments away oh it's coming I say
Not charming deplorable and just alarming I say
Maddening on so many levels it's saddening I say
It's coming any day now approaching I say.
Not for me to just disagree.
Not just something to do.
Like a mouse on a wheel I feel
I can't run far enough from you.
Do you feel when the knife cuts in
That you're somehow more alive than you've ever been
Almost... Maybe Maybe Never
Your fictitious glide is forever. <start> The fear inside my hate filled mind
The concept of eternal life...
Never could you understand
That life won't take you by the hand
Wait... you stop to ponder I'm leaving you behind
Behind
Opened eyes used to stare but never see
I've given all I can now set me free
Why ask for my
Help you're on your own
Why should I try
You're just a waste of time
Why should I care
Noone could tell you so
Why won't you listen
Noone will ever know
What I know
Help you're on our own
I shouldn't try
You're just a waste of time
I shouldn't care
Noone could tell you so
I shouldn't listen
Noone will ever know
That I know
You are a guest
Take Away Fear Burn Away Ask Clear to see

Take Away Fear Burn Away Ask Clear to see
Hate Scorn Pain Torn No Fault Fear is real

Never hated more <start> When angels draw the pentagram
and satan says the rosary
when the gates of hell are frozen
and heaven burns eternally.
when day and night become a union
become a single gloomy tone
when all of your thoughts wear mourning
it is november  nebelmond.
It is the time when witches dance
behind the burning clouds the demons wait
to change your wishes into curses
and all is mould and all's decay.
The summer left the autumn died
and snow's white shrouds will cover soon
the earth and all that now is rotting
nebelmond  pale misty moon.
Your inner self wants to break free
but it is trapped no chance to leave
now panic spreads its gory wings
you're drowned in sorrow pain and grief.
Grey and damp the world is fading
behind a haze of frozen tears
the angels draw the pentagram
nebelmond  time of fear. <start> Explosion of dynamite emotional suicide
We'll bring you as close as we can
Universal misery assassination artillery
The camera's are making a scan
Devil in a beauty box moral bitches sucking cocks
Erections are made up for you
Everlasting media to paramountal violence
Competition the financial news
Remote control is eating my soul
Multiple choice bites you overall
It's a love hate satellite
Systematic deviation good belief or false creation
The presets are shifted by rules
Antiquated extradited sexually brutalised
The victims are treated like tools
Remote control is eating my soul
Multiple choice bites you overall
So what if you live for the screen
And you die by the screen
The information highways are overfilled
The frequencies were scanning on
Are drowning in the overcast
Please enjoy while it lasts
And I can't get enough
It's a love hate satellite
Love hate satellite
So now you're aiming for lust
Jack off in the dust
While the neighbours have ears on the wall
We socialize the human race
While sitting in a rusty coach
Please enjoy while it lasts
So now you blow up the sun
The show must go on
Blowing up the bridges that we have built
The aggression we're promoting here
Is giving you a moral blast
Please enjoy while it lasts <start> May we be the next to selfincinerate and may the mustard smoke from our bones be inhaled and consumed by the king cobras and queen bees of our world
The stinger is in our hands
A poison sac is in our skulls
The last strike will be made by us <start> I can tell by the weight of your words that this is over
All the should've but could'ves can no longer be
This is the second death in the exquisite art of forgetting
and i promise this to you i'll burn the devotion clean
Filling every hole in my heart
All of these melancholy moments can sometimes sink
Everything you were is fiction everything you are is fiction
And if you see me chin down and toungue tied
this is all ihave to offer
I thought i'd never be asking
This is my last laugh in this place of dying
And for you. this is the last goodbye you'll ever here
It's not suppose to end like this <start> Time has shown there is no hope in countries
where black liquid reigns
War of clowns who had devised many plans to derange
the vanishing of oil barrels will one day reach
saturation point maximum squeeze individual profits
but never forget  the sand won't yield.
The horns announce another stage of alert
misusing religion is totally absurd
Innocence is so far away
and I still see no light at the end
of their tunnel
It's impressive when you see
how one man commands this hypnotised fold
It's hard to believe
when they are recruiting kids  years old
Isolate the press from betraying to conceal
the truth from the outside world never mind
just what they say the news is hot and
therefore they pray
The horns announce another stage of alert
misusing religion is totally absurd
Innocence is so far away
and I still see no light at the end
of their tunnel
Fly fly away from here
Reach reach for dignity
in every war there's something else to prove
the wicked one makes his move
The horns announce another stage of alert
misusing religion is totally absurd
Innocence is so far away
and I still see no light at the end
of their tunnel.
Bold as brass the point of no return
The capture of Kuwait pipelines burn
Craters in the mind craters on the ground
Explosions in their memories without sound
It's carved inside and carved into my brain
It's all paid in blood don't expect the
change
My trip is done for me it's all over
The winner cries now tell me who's the loser 
One day it's cold
the other warm
There's always wind before the storm
Whirling circle what's the price
is peace so boring after a lapse of time 
One day it's cold
the other warm
There's always wind before you see the storm
Burning circle endless game
Everything returns from where it came. <start> Hearing the calling of darkness
Spending my time by your side
I don't want to die
I am looking for
The eternal flame
The flame of life
Now I am walking around the end
I'm only running against time
It's true or false
I'm loosing my control
I'm looking for
The flame of life
An angel tells me that the flame is love
But all the love I have I know it's gone
The reason of our lives
The meaning for your crying days
Now think about your future
You know your life is not a game
The flame of love is around your head
The flame cries sometimes
The flame of happyness
Solo Rionda
Now I am walking around the end
My own enemy is time
It's true or false
I'm loosing my control
I'm looking for
The eternal flame
An angel tells me that the flame is love
But all the love I have I know it's gone
The flame of love is around your head
The flame cries sometimes
The flame of happyness
The flame of life
The flame of life
The flame of life oooh <start> A dismal universal hiss the sound of public scorn
The brush that sweeps across the spectral fields
This landscape is not without a sense of epic wonder
A vast scale that places this sprawling underworld into a realm of frames
With a bloodstorm fading into the distance
Floating without directions over this smoldering landscape
Caught in a moment of transformation
These shades of anatomic malignant nature
Approached one another in unpleasant ways
Frozen in the act of speech desperate to express its state
Created in a shape to accommodate a wide variety of daemonic forms
The realm of the benighted aristocracy of evil most pure
This is where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep
Emerged from the depths of the earth gasps
With rage against mankind to annihilate the earth and worse
It spills the blood like rain the beauty of death it represents
Devouring their flesh with a razorblade smile
Genes would still blindly carry on smoldering ember of hell
Limned with gold leaf the scarlet brush
That sweeps all traces of time place and pattern <start> You say I'm evil you say I suck
My hair's too long I don't give a fuck
I'm doing nothing out of control
My music's wrong I don't care at all
You say I'm ditry I smell like shit
All dressed in black and my clothes don't fit
I'm a sinner excuse me m'am
You take your moral I don't give a damn
Metal's getting hyper deadly as a viper
Rise from armageddon
Faster than a feight train stronger than a steel chain
Screaming voices roar
In the name of metal
Raise your fist to the heaven above
In the name of metal
Raise your fist and shout
In the name of metal
Raise your fist to the music we love
In the name of metal
You think i'm ugly looks like a witch
I'll kick your ass like a pussy bitch
You call me loser I raise my glass
Let's make a toast you can kiss my ass
Metal's getting hyper deadly as a viper
Rise from armageddon
Faster than a feight train stronger than a steel chain
Screaming voices roar
In the name of metal
Raise your fist to the heaven above
In the name of metal
Raise your fist and shout
In the name of metal
Raise your fist to the music we love
In the name of metal <start> Victims of the renaissance might
screamed in the dead of night.
The horror the terror.
Ruler in Machiavellian days
stole all of their days away
to darkness to sadness.
I still see painful eyes.
I still hear distant sighs
among shadows lingering on.
Gaze up high into the open sky
from these halls and chambers.
To the moon and to the winds I cry.
Soul's aglow in the darkest of hue
miseries are still undue
forever and ever.
I caress the thickening air
and all memories it bear
with yearning and longing.
Far behind these castle walls
glories and virtues fall
fall for the lunacy.
Deep inside where the time weeps
tyranny is fast asleep
in shadows in echoes.
Dim is the day for the grim and the grey
as destiny's proven unfair.
Fair as a fay is the dawning of the day
at which I forlornly do gaze. <start> In time bleeding wounds will heal
Unlike some which are too deep to see
Like scars in the Nomads soul
Their mending is so slow
Not a shout of a hundred enemies
Can make him feel fear inside him
But when sunsets and the cold arrives
With crushing solitude in the darkness of night
He will ride across land and time
To find a way through this endless night
There s a storm in his heart
And the fire burns his soul
But the wanderers part is to ride alone
With bare hands he has taken many lives
He has had a hundred women by his side
From enchanted woods to the freezing North
He is known at every sea and far beyond
As the moon grows and the circle is complete
He lies down and waits for sleep
But there's always a scenery in his mind.
Of all that beauty he once left behind <start> Death spirit me away
My anguished soul doth strain
On taut and twisted reins
Yet insatiate I still remain
Like a proud unfalled star
That dares thee from afar
To calm my thund'rous heart
Else rend it's knots apart
So I may never sing
Of jewelled skies o'er my strings
And love a wanton thing
Can plunge on burnt black wings
To hang amid the thorns
In scarlet like velvet worn
About the clouded moon
Who wanes in solitude
I am alone
Thirsting for the dark
That lurks beneath marbled stone
What black witchcraft
Shalt prise thee from thy dreams
And what perverse worldstrategy
Will wend it's way with thee from sleep
Rouse my disease
And with cadent naked dance I shalt teach
Thee wisdom of darkness
From earth and red sea
Light bearing Samael
Coalesce with me
Twilight
Through pagan city gates
Bred shadows play like twining snake
By candlelight
Thanateros rites
Death seduced and chaos wakes
Obsession grips blindragon fever
In throes of scythed orgasm Eros dies
And Saturn rapes faith's lovelorn Diva
Upon a cyprean altar stripped bare for sacrifice
Virtue births a demon
Pandora's box unhinged sets loose the night
Winged lilith born for want of Eden
Fanning plumes of harlotry
Like pearls before the desert swine
The skies they darken
And the oceans part
Storm forth indignant Kraken
Reborn Venus as thou art
Feasting at my banquet
Of Saturnalia
I call thee having wrestled
The tides from lonely Diana
For thee Endymion
I forsake the cerements of this starflung tomb
Bewithus come
Unveil the ancient flame
Throw the cats our enemies
Desire's menstrual strain
Eastern Devil eyes
A cruel erotic plague
The Shekhina is in exile
And the Israelites enslaved to shame
Midnight
Jerusalem
A tenebrous phantasy
Revelates to men
Their celestial walls crumble
When walks the Xul
Born to the scarlet whore in Babylon
The centuries of wait have all but gone
Behold dark beauty stirs to conquer on and on
Now worship everything <start> Sodium sunrise burns my eyes
Electric charged reanimation
I must recombine my  mind
After technocrucifixion
Growling engines
Transmitting praise
Audio sensors detecting wavs
The factory
Reanimates me
As a post organic form of life
Vacuum breath on the surface
Of my positron skin
Covered by the barbed wire
And lifeproof membrane
I'm the factory's newest product
Son of serialized destruction
Perfect body  perfect soul
Reborn in a post organic form of life
Oxygen  no longer needed
Brain  lobotomized
Heart  pumping cyanide
Arms  mechanized
Eyes  throwing xrays
Tissues  mummified
Erased  my memory
All the rest is vaporized
Baptized in a lake of acid tears
I am resurrected in a toxic soul
Hardware body  software soul
In post organic form
Appeared
I've seen the android god preaching
Radiating his nuclear love
I've seen the world around
Bewitched in a pill of mescaline. <start> Raise your eyes to the brightest
And say goodbye to the last one
And his lost words
Then burn me at the stake
To get on the inside
You succomb to the unknown
In the core you will find me
Behind the controls screaming...
Rip the stars down
Ya that's my mood
If I'm going down
I swear I'm taking everyone of you
The bitter end won't be so cold
Wind me up and let me go
I navigate this brainstorm
Subplots begin to unfold
My character dies there
He has to sacrifice a soul
To get on the inside
You succomb to the unknown
In the core you will find me
Losing all control screaming...
Look in here
When I open up to you <start> High tension line step down
Jeanette Fletcher is strange but not in a horrible way
And Michelle Spencer is this tight
Come and hear her today
And see year olds in multicoloured shirts
It never used to concern me
But now it's making me say
High tension line step down
Buying houses and doing them up far far away
Got at my shoulder CDTI and behind me TDK
You have to go far for the simple and unadorned
And please excuse my words wandering
High tension line step down
At my feet CDTI breakdown
And I pick up the phone noone
And am far too far fast for sampling
Just spend my time avoiding
High tension line step down
Life is nothing more than a disposable
Facial tissue in a brass bin and spawn
Take it out I notice face imprint
And please excuse my words I'm wandering <start> Prawn cocktail black forest gateau
Eggs and gammon with a bottle of lambrusco
This is opulent luxury
I'm as happy as a pig in shit could be
You keep your cordon bleu and your seedless grapes
You know where you can stick your brown eggs
I just want what every man wants
A nibble on your volauvents and a pint
So just shake shake shake like a lettuce leaf
Shake it till the slugs fall off
Just shake shake shake like a lettuce leaf
Shake it till the slugs fall off
I like simple things meaty pies
I like potato chips and I like my sushi deep fried
Never could pronounce houderves
Cannot speak the language of love
I just want what every man wants
A nibble on your volauvents and a pint
So just shake shake shake like a lettuce leaf
Shake it till the slugs fall off
So just shake shake shake like a lettuce leaf
Shake it till the slugs fall off
So just shake shake shake like a lettuce leaf
Shake it till the slugs fall off
So just shake shake shake like a lettuce leaf
Shake it till the slugs fall off
So just shake shake shake like a lettuce leaf
Shake it till the slugs fall off
So just shake shake shake like a lettuce leaf
Shake it till the slugs fall off <start> What's happening to me
I'm dying from the inside
Body hurts too much to feel
And pressure adds to pain
Deliver us from evil
Straying out of sanity
Why can't you let me be
Is nothing else important
Does my mind mean more to you
'Cause if I carry on
Deliver us from evil
Screaming for your vanity
Will darkness turn to light
Will darkness turn to light
Can someone wake me from this nightmare
Here we go
Here we go
The tank is empty let it dry
I'm suffering a passion ending
So the world ceases turning
The tank is empty let it dry
So now I hope you see
I'm nothing more than human
Making plans for enemies
But here we go again
Deliver us from evil
Crawling back to insanity
Will darkness turn to light
Will darkness turn to light
Can someone wake me from this nightmare
Here we go
Here we go
The tank is empty let it dry
I'm suffering a passion ending
So the world ceases turning
The tank is empty let it dry
I'm suffering a passion ending
So the world ceases turning
The tank is empty let it dry
I'm suffering
What's happening to me
I'm dying from the inside
Body hurts too much to feel
And pressure adds to pain
Deliver us from evil
Through evil
Pressure adds to pain
We're evil
We're evil
We're evil
Will darkness turn to light
Will darkness turn to light
Can someone wake me from this nightmare
Here we go
Here we go
The tank is empty let it dry
I'm suffering
The tank is empty let it dry
I'm suffering
A passion ending so the world ceases turning
A passion ending so the world ceases turning <start> After about a minute of mixing

Countless lives have been waisted
Money keeps the machine guns running well
Prechorus
The cease fire is demanted
Release of prisoners is urged
New trust is requested
Peace and freedom is wanted
A resolution has passed the security council
New hope is given to new freedom
The goal is to ban the bloody useless war
We have to stop the war come on let's do it
PrechorusChorus
Fight for Resolution 
Get through Resolution 
No choice Resolution 
Let's go and go for it

Will Iran stop bumbing Basra
Will Iraq quit the air raids in Teheran and Hamadan
Will the superpowers be very careful
PrechorusChorus
Stop the bloody war now lets go for it
Everybody is involved yeah
Support the Resolution 
Resolution  testifies that good will is there
Lets try to change the will to reality
So far the war had no chance to stop for any

Will the little resolution be the chance

Kaleidoscope of love.
Ophidians dance as the shifting occurs.
We are stars and electric animals.
Nurtured by the mothers of prostitutes.
Floating in a mushroom universe.
Swimming in a sea of cyclostomes.
And as we surface through the tide
You open up and I come inside.
I must be in limbo
'Cos purgatory's always felt like home.
And as the world spins round and round
We fornicate upon the cotton clouds.
That rain down sulphur smiles
On the children at play in the poppy fields.
Sinking for what seems like forever.
Like Atlantis into the sea.
To forget the shore and wash away
Wash away my memory.
I must be in limbo
'Cos purgatory's always felt like home.
Inside the moon lives the high priest of the mushroom cult.
Upon the altar are the ashes of the Pharisees.
I sold my soul
Sold my soul
Sold my soul away.
I'm free of guilt
Free of sin
Free of everything <start> I break the chains of unbelief
Burden of millennial slavery
Forest eteral wander
Extending beyond earthly dimensions
Gods will return to their graces together with me
They'll find their oaken kingdom as before
I free my powers when yelling silently
When I fight...thousand of demons follow me
And my strength and my spell...
And my beautiful pride
Will find you and wrap you
will raise the majesty to the skies...
From the depths of the earth deep and black
Through the forests woods and shadows
 will penetrate lakes and wolfish mountians...
On the wings of demons to the skies
I denude golden gates of my Nawia
Shrouded in thick smoke of burnt bodies
I show my love...I praise the might
...And destroy with power of thunders
Constantly destroy <start> Say hello to the night
Let order and chaos fill your eyes
Brave the fear in your mind
Walk into the afterlight
Afterlight
Afterlight
Afterlight
Afterlight
The colors fly like gold in my hands
With open eyes I'm starting again
Before you go I think you should know
The world is your kaleidoscope
Break the sequence of hate
There's nowhere but up to go so follow close
And you'll see the dawn of an age
Where pillars have turned to stone and martyrs pave the way
The colors fly like gold in my hands
With open eyes I'm starting again
Before you go I think you should know
The world is your kaleidoscope
The colors fly like gold in my hands
With open eyes I'm starting again
Before you go I think you should know
The world is your kaleidoscope
Kaleidoscope
Afterlight
Afterlight
Afterlight
Afterlight
Say hello to the night
Let order and chaos fill your eyes <start> Your lies consume me with ever breath I'm burning
How I believed that the truth was in your eyes
My life now chaos and your tongue it breeds deceit
Wake from this nightmare I'll never love her again
My nights now filled with agony as your scent floats in the air
And salted rain that falls on my lips
I pray to God I'll not stumble again
And I woke in chains these shackles tear my flesh
And blood that flows from these wounds flows black as night
Now count deception I have no past she told me
Her words ring within my ears and chill my spine
Now as the rage builds I fear control is waning
I feel this shell that is restraint now crumble away
And salted rain now falls on my lips I pray to God I'll not stumble again
And I woke in chains and shackles tear my flesh
And blood that flows from these wounds flows black as night
Your lies consume me with every breath I burn
And now the past that should be kept haunts me at night
Chilled to the bone tong sears my flesh
And your lies breed Vicious Betrayal
Stumble to the ground still she knows me best
And her lies breed Vicious Betrayal <start> I thought I wasn't to the fire
I thought it was too far.
I thought I wasn't to the fire.
I thought it was too...
I thought I wasn't to the fire.
I thought it was too far.
I thought I wasn't to the fire.
I thought...

I thought I wasn't to the fire
I thought it was too far.
I thought I wasn't to the fire.
I thought it was too far.
I thought I wasn't to the fire
I thought it was too far.
I thought I wasn't to the fire
I thought... <start> from the very moment I heard your deceit and subtle lies
from the moment you shocked me silent I burned to question why
why why do you insist you persist in blasphemy of my Lord and God
take your opinions and empty accusations home and rot
your world is so perverted
nausea grips my stomach...I think I'm gonna vomit
and to think I once took part in the narrowmindedness of a hardened heart
why
why the insults to my Lord
there is no point without support
blaming God for faults of men
you don't even understand
some feeble point or shock effect
who do you benefit
you profit off another's pain
and bite the hand that seeks to aid lies
motive ego...knowledge who knows
solution zero...your goal oh so vague
and the band millions of dead
whoever you are mumbling and grumbling about today
your music's fast and you're outspoken
but you have little or nothing to say
and the boys from south of heaven
who knock t.v. preachers with every other word
you come off so concerned and charge  for a tshirt
hypocrisy your breath holds
deception reeks thick and bold
you don't care about anyone but yourself
you couldn't care less if I rot in hell
me or anyone else.
why
and the band named after the cow disease
so proud if you're without sin then go ahead
cast your two cents in and half the bands in the
berkley mag on the bandwagon of the insult circus
of all the wrongs you slag the rights and lose us to your purpose
if you're so wise then solve my troubles
instead you ask more 
needless questions and my troubles double
give us something we can use
you serve only to confuse
why <start> Like the wicked rule the weak
Like all conquerors have their keep
I'll tear my marks into your arms
Paralyzed but still you're charmed
Like the great white circles it's prey
I rise above their deceiving ways
Liars...
Your hollow words play a hollow tune
My eyes fueled the flames
As i'm dancing on your grave
Like the great white circles it's prey
Desert sands mourning souls...
I'll tear my marks into your arms
Paralyzed yet still you're charmed
Like the wicked rule the weak
Like all conquerors have their keep
Liars... your hollow words play a hollow tune <start> We are sinking this ship now
This midnight hour
How long can you hold your breath
To the sirens who sing to
The broken hearts
We are humming the same tune
Goodbye my lullaby
Goodbye my lullaby
Goodbye my lullaby
Under water reflected
Flashes of life
Floating up from your lungs your lips
When you decided to sail to
The other side
Well you decided to sink too
Goodbye my lullaby
Goodbye my lullaby
Goodbye my lullaby
Goodbye my lullaby
Goodbye my lullaby
We are sinking this ship now
By midnight hour
How long can you hold your breath
To the sirens who sing to
The broken hearts
We are humming the same tune
Goodbye my lullaby
Goodbye my lullaby
Goodbye my lullaby
Goodbye my lullaby
Goodbye my lullaby
Goodbye my lullaby
Goodbye my lullaby
I will wiss you
Goodbye my lullaby
I will wiss you
Goodbye my lullaby
Goodbye my lullaby
Goodbye my lullaby
How long can you hold your breath <start>  You've died inside
 Nowhere to hide
 Inside an empty room
 Your life is gone
 Can't heal the wrong
 It seems you're on your own
You're not alone
Just too far from home
You've traveled so far
But you could be forgiven
Someday
I've seen night turn to day turn to night
In the loneliest light
Far away from the day
Hides the loneliest life
What a waste all betrayed
Because you can't seem to
Fly away from the storm
 Please understand
 God lent his hand
 As always turned away
 It's all but lost
 To bear the cross
 I'll chase your fears away
No now you're not alone
You're too far from home
You traveled too far
And you could be forgiven
Someday
I've seen night turn to day turn to night
In the loneliest light
Far away from the day
Hides the loneliest life
What a waste all betrayed
Because you can't seem to
Fly away from the storm
Turning and burning and yearning
It's all about learning and knowing
We never quite know what it's showing
And anytime it could be taking you down
You feel so high
But someday we'll find you
Alone alone alone alone
Turning and burning and yearning
It's all about learning and knowing
We never quite know what it's showing
And anytime it could be taking you down
What made you fly
Where no one could touch you
I've seen night turn to day turn to night
In the loneliest light
Far away from the day
Hides the loneliest life
What a waste all betrayed
Because you can't seem to
Fly away from the storm <start> fifteen years in the jail

fucking fag misleading was a whore with dick <start> Where am I now
Have I turned blind
Broken down by the guilt of my killing hand
My bleeding victim
Folds her hands an prays
My bleeding victim
Folds her hands and prays
The morning rise the sky burns red
Sheets are soaked by unknown blood and soil
Memories burn  I crawl in pain
The scene I see is becoming more surreal
Beyond the veil  stalking my prey
Beyond control  I'm on my way
Drawn into the center of the weak
Madness flares within my angry mind
Alone in this maze where voices speak
In twisted tongues that taunt for evil deeds
Beyond the veil  stalking my prey
Beyond control  unveil my pain
I feel the blood slowly flow
In a reflecting eye I see them die
Heartbeat that silently decays
Sinking deep into the Earth's hungry soil
I will return
Same face
With a new mask
Trying to hide
From the guilt
Of my killing hand
My bleeding victim
Folds her hands and prays
My bleeding victim
Folds her hands and...
....prays while the blood slowly flow
In a reflecting eye I see them die
A heartbeat that silently decays
Sinking deep into the Earth's hungry soil
Drawn into the center of the weak
Madness flares within my angry mind
Alone in this maze where voices speak
In twisted tongues that taunt for evil deeds
Beyond the evil  I'm on my way
Beyond the evil  stalking my prey
Beyond the evil  I'm on my way
Beyond the evil  unveil my pain <start> Disappear take your life
Create your fear I desire
Many lies I have believed
Evil forces come to me
In my mind you are killed by all
My demons you fear
All your nightmares become true
I desire to you
I deserve all your life and you're burned inside
Never leave you I believe I'll be there like
In bad dreams
You die and I can feel your pain inside
You die and you'll never come back to life
Pray I want you feel the pain
Every day I taste your death
All the sickness in my mind
Been creating for long time
I desire your defeat
Only one that I can kill
Feeling how you heart stops
You are the victim of my lust
I deserve all your life and you're burned inside
Never leave you I believe I'll be there like
In bad dreams
You die and I can feel your pain inside
You die and you'll never come back to life
Disappear take your life
Create your fear I desire
Many lies I have believed
Evil forces come to me
In my mind you are killed by all
My demons you fear
All your nightmares become true
I desire to you
You die and I can feel your pain inside
You die and you'll never come back to life <start> am I'm still awake
Before the dawn the Sandman will come with nightmares
I won't let him in
There's nothing in head
Empty walls empty bed
I am just waiting
Restless beats of heart and breathing break the silence
I am still here
The absence of light
Narrows my eyesight
But still I see them
It's not angels that sing
And call me by my true name
They have forsaken me
Dead tired but aware
Sleep invites the demons I am not prepared
I have to stay awake
There are monsters in my head
On my walls under my bed
I am dying
I am jaded I am numb I am counting on the sun
Salvation to come
The absence of light
Narrows my eyesight
But still I see them
It's not angels that sing
And call me by my true name
Why have you forsaken me <start> I am the dice man
And I take a chance huh
Do you take a chance huh
Where you two going
Where you two going
Is this a branch on the tree of showbusiness
Do all these musicians
Have a social conscience
Well only in their front rooms
But I am the dice man
And I take a chance man
Do you take a chance huh
They stay with the masses
Don't take any chances
End up emptying ashtrays
But I push push push push
Throw the bones and the poison dice
No time for small moralists
'cause I am the dice man
And I take a chance huh
Do you take a chance fan
They say music should be fun
Like reading a story of love
But I want to read a horror story
Where are you people going
Where are you people going
Is this a branch on the tree of showbusiness
But I am the dice man
A ballsontheline man
Do you take a chance baby <start> Welcome
this transmission
from a fallen star
otherwise known as Arcturus
Light has departed
from this black sun
But please put us on
to bring darkness down
from your head and home
Our enterprise a success
as return is no option
our eyes were removed
for our own safety
The distance too great
for you to hear our cries
nevermind take this lamp
we are beyond light
We learned so little
of inhuman culture
before disappearance
went right through us
The mothership
boarded by fools
we escape space
in order to reach
our destination
And if you are listening
please tell us about the time
where and when we exist
no more
For when you go
we go with you
via wormholes <start> I call upon thee
I am standing alone
My mighty wind
Unfold your dark wings
The glory of war
I am still seeking strong
My strength is hate
Darkness  quell the sun
Let my enemies not see me
Pledge me the warhawk
Let the moons bewitch it
Black fire dance with me
Burn in me  strengthen me
Unite with my darkness
Open the gates
To eternity
Purified souls
Sworn to slay the weak
The voice of the eternal
Hate and anger from within
As warriors and predators
We were conjured by the
Essence of war
Hunting with the wolves
In the embrace of the night
See the destruction
Of the sun
An overwhelming sight
Brutal  dark  delight
I long to see
The eternity <start> Before my eyes lies nothing but lies
I cannot believe the scenes
Taking place beneath our skies
It makes me wanna do my time
In a song or on the silver screen
Humanity is the biggest cancer ever to be seen
Before my eyes lies civilization
Ancient and wicked
Destruction in creation
No matter how low you are
There's always someone to look down upon
And it goes fucking on and on
Emotionless obscene
But a human life don't mean anything to me
It's merely a seed of insanity
Emotionless obscene
But a human life don't mean anything to me
It's merely a seed of insanity <start> Look at the pain x
Look at the pain x
Take pleasure see misery
Look at the pain x
Take pleasure see misery
Look at the pain x
Don't want to see it anymore
I prefer to fight
Look at the pain...
Your images make me sick
Blind people
Peace of mind 
Fucked from today
Look at the pain...
Men dyin' for a religion
No mercy
Blind horrors
Fucked from today
Look at the pain...
Now sacrify in
the name of profit
No more love
fucked from today
look at the pain..
the planet is poisoned
who will pay 
it's too late
fucked from today
Power
On your screen
Valours
On your screen
sufferings
On your screen
run devil run

Dead by my hand
By my mind
Straight in your head
When fiction meets reality
Break
Steal poor people
Make money
To finance your clean wars
See the effects of your propaganda
Look the all world is fooling itself
And I say 
I'm changed
Broken
Despoiled
Deceived
Abused
Betrayed
Torn...
You suckers 
Every war has its innocents
Turn their life into weapons
Give an excuse to all of your crimes
Now pain feeds me... <start> Something new on the TV
Something new to get to me
Three more sitting on the fence
With inadequate defense
Three more fell in mammon's spell
Making money out of hell
Now glory goes to ABC
For reporting the truth to you and me
Now glory goes to doomed souls
As they just say I told you so
A few less tears for a burned down church
Less sympathy for a suppressed Word
Three more like those before defrocked
The saints become a laughingstock
Three more reasons to say no
To Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord
Reasons to say no
Just look at all this on the TV
Suits by Cardin and Armani
Look real good with diamond rings
And velvet carpeted settings
For the rich I have no dis
If they know what to do with it
Actionless emotions are a lie
Quick way to regret when you die
TV cameras can never catch
What's behind a door safely latched
If at some point they ever do
Edit it to do what you want it to
An easily manipulated medium
To see it is to believe it
Medium and message in control
Pay your money buy your soul
If the cameras could only catch
The silent struggles of believers attacked
They're the ones we could look up to
They're the ones who do what we should do
Look up to Jesus first no one else
Placing others before themselves
Feeding those out without a home
Keep believing when tomorrow's unknown
Unafraid to share the Word
In the everyday neighborhood world
Sometimes at night they'll cry from sin
Pray from the hole they've fallen in
Soon enough you'll see their cheer
As the Lord did not turn a deaf ear
There's some reason to say yes
To salvation through Jesus
Reasons to say yes <start> Just take a look around and see the seeds of discontent
That we've sown too deep to dig out from beneath the skin.
We stab each other in the back
To succeed in this game that's too easy to lose.
The last time we throw the dice and pull the hammer back
Our aces high but the risks are higher.
Show your smile it's time so open wide
And let me shovel down the same old shit you feed us every day.
Line up face the wall
Your eyes to the floor.
The cost of your denial
Pulls you further down.
Bearing ourselves to the elements for the last time
Pouring our hearts out and staining the dirt.
Turning our backs on the ignorant for the first time
Feeling our fingers ground down to the bone.
Look at what we've done. It's Russian roulette
With a fully loaded gun until the clip is empty.
We can die as one or fall and be divided
Live in obscurity and bite the hand that feeds.
So place your bets and run the outcome's been decided
Now our time has come.
The cost of wanting something more has had its fun.
So burn your bridges on the way out and don't forget that you belong to me.
Line up face the wall
Your eyes to the floor.
The cost of your denial
Pulls you further down.
Bearing ourselves to the elements for the last time
Pouring our hearts out and staining the dirt.
Turning our backs on the ignorant for the first time
Feeling our fingers ground down to the bone.
.
No stone unturned
Our bridges burned
The cost of your denial
Will drag you further down <start> I've played every hand I can given everything I could
did my best to make a plan but I failed
I've been down every road I know but every street light flickers on and off and leaves me in the dark holding you
and singing
Oh love oh love how is life to blame
Oh love oh love I hear it in your name
Singing oh love oh love how is life to blame when there's just no escaping fate
There's a war inside my head there's a fire in my heart
I did everything you said but I still failed
I confided in the sentiment and lost my sense of reason in the whirlwind of attraction that wreaked havoc and destroyed me
Oh love oh love how is life to blame
Oh love oh love I hear it in your name
Singing oh love oh love how is life to blame when there's just no escaping fate
Oh love oh love how is life to blame
Oh love oh love I hear it in your name
Oh love oh love how is life to blame when there's just no escaping fate
Oh there's just no escaping fate
No there's just no escaping fate <start> Right now what are you thinking
Paddle with the spoon and you came up sinking
Too fast then it gets faster
Downward spin don't think you're gonna last
You're drowning in a pool so shallow
Eating at the soul until the body is hollow
Hazing so you won't see
You're nothing but a whore boy to the monkey
Faith in me
Decay
Shine on
Weakness voluntary sickness
Learn when you burn it's the wrong way to fix this
Digression turns into obsession
Lesson number one hooks you in the profession
So you say you're not addicted
The lies in your eyes of the pain you've inflicted
Feel it crushing through your veins
You're loosing yourself monkey on the brain
Consumer repair buyer beware
Sunk your fortune for it
Punk
Hate this solitary turmoil
Off in the corner like a snake in a coil
Shaking for what you're not taking
Say you're gonna quit but you know that you're faking it
Too cool who are you trying to fool
Gonna need help boy take you back to school
Clean you of what you can't see
Or just die trying to kiss the monkey <start> Doubt and disbelief are the luxuries of the ignorant.
Placebo mockery intended to discredit. No longer
has meaning. Drifting closer taking shape through the mists
tragedy rides forth. The last laugh is mine. Man has made the
neogod. Man has made the neogod. Unholy falseness infests.
The final day is upon us. How much further can things continue
when transgressors claim to be the victims.
Unresponsible for the lives they destroy. Bitterness.
A selfish focus. The special interest flight only compounds havoc.
The holistic picture stays unviewed and worsens.
It is the reason violators
live while innocents are terminated.
Prophecies unfold as the horrors close in around this world. <start> Dweller of the Sombre Lanes
Crow of the gutter and grime.
Striving through the dark for gain
Up to the gallows you climb.
Through your most stagnant life
The rusty blade leads the way.
Rags and a muddy cloak
Is but your sole array.
Among the hawking beggars
Among the thieves.
Pale Light of Silver Moon
Cast your light upon wicked plans.
To anthems of virtuous' ruin
The villain and the sinner they dance.
Hailing from penury's womb
Sprung from the bower of sin.
Where fate held nothing but gloom
And future wore a taunting grin.
Find the scavenger's demise
By the trail of the poverty.
Look for the vulture eyes
On the fair of misery. <start> Schn ist der Wald wenn der Tag sich neigt
wenn feiner Nebel hoch vom moosgen Boden steigt.
Und Vglein singen sacht zum Ruhgeleit 
dann mirs die Brust vor arger Schwere feit.
Doch in der Hh des Walds kann ich schon sehen
geliebte Dmmerzeit  musst gehn.
Musst weichen schon dem kalten Mondeslicht
das sich bald schaurig in den Wipfeln bricht...
Was raschelt hinterm Busche dort
Was regt im Holz sich immerfort
Wer heult im fernen unentwegt
Was hat sich eben da bewegt
Es ist nur mein Geist der mir einen Streich zu spielen gedacht
denn hier ist nichts  nur Nacht nur Nacht nur Nacht
Mein Herz schlgt wild vom Schrecken der sich nun gelegt
doch was war da Da hat sich wieder was geregt
Ists wohl der Teufel selbst der mich nun holt von diesem finstren Ort
Wer es auch ist  Hinfort Unhold Hinfort
Weg nur weg nur weg von hier mich frchtets wie ein Kind
Doch jeder Baum scheint gleich  es ist ein Labyrinth.
In jedem Winkel ein hhnisch Lachen klingt
und jeder Blick mir neues Grauen bringt.
Stille ja Stille  verstummt und verhallt
das Rascheln das Raunen kein Klang mehr erschallt.
Doch wo bin ich Was tu ich 
hier tief im Wald
Ersinne den Morgen ach km er doch bald.
Verirrt und vergessen  den Lieben entrissen
einsam verloren  mein Wille...verschlissen....
Doch was glnzt dort in der Fremde
Ein Funkeln bricht durchs Gest.
Die Lichtung die Lichtung nicht ferne
Nun seh ichs ja seh ichs unds lsst
mein Herze erblhn
Welch Lichtfest Welch Glhen
Ein Blick noch zurck 
den Augen kaum trauend
denn kaum konnt ichs schauen
hinweg war das Grauen 
nur Friede im Wald. <start> Scorching through the icy skies filled with manic rage
Battle of the Titans tonight they will invade
Sorcerers around us behold the demon fire
The Swords of Darkness at their side veild and awesome power
As the battle rages on the heavens are destroyed
Darkness falls around you're lost within a void
Damned are the defiant cursed are their souls
Those who've felt the wrath of god many lives they've stole
Will they ever forget the wicked war they fought
Metal mutants feed upon the corpses as they rot
All you hear are battle cries  blood that pours like rain
Swords of Darkness rule at last  send you to your grave
Now the time is running out you know the end is near
The entity in black has come to feed upon your fears
The wizards cast their final blows to ashes fall the gods
Destruction of another world the light is all but gone
As the battle rages on the heavens are destroyed
Darkness falls around you you're lost within a void
Scorching through the icy skies filled with manic rage
Battle of the Titans tonight they will invade
Sorcerers around us behold the demon fire
The Swords of Darkness at their side veild and awesome power
As the battle rages on the heavens are destroyed
Darkness falls around you're lost within a void <start> at er upphaf essar sgo at Baldr inn ga dreymi drauma stra ok

And your whole world dissolves
A never happened breath
My mind gone astray
So much around that kills
I found mine in a dream
I said that I would come
I came too late
It was dark and cold
The wind blows their names
Like the words untold
Like the promises to stay
I promised I'll be there
To help until the end
You purely said hello
Sounded like farewell
When will I see you again
When will I touch your skin
We're walking on the edge
The edge of silence
Close your eyes and observe
Always completely alone
We planned to pass the bridge
That leads to knowledge
Irrational foreigns
Struggling with all the waves
Of an unequal sea <start> Reach through my window and pull the shades
No shine no sunlight just cold and grey
There's no way to rise from beneath your wings
Chained to your side I can never leave
You choke out the light like a cloud hanging over me

You're dragging me down with your suicidal symphony

Over my head over my head
Everything is so empty no glass half full
How can someone so beautiful be so miserable
I'd follow you down to the edges of earth
Just to hear you say that your life is cursed
You choke out the light like a cloud hanging over me

You're dragging me down with your suicidal symphony

Over my head over my head
You won't let me leave I don't wanna stay
But the price on my head is weighing me down
And it feels like I'm dying inside
But you don't care we carry on
You won't let me leave I don't wanna stay
But the price on my head is weighing me down
And it feels like I'm dying inside
You don't care we carry on
You choke out the light like a cloud hanging over me
You're dragging me down with your suicidal symphony

You choke out the light like a cloud hanging over me

You're dragging me down with your suicidal symphony

Over my head over my head
Back the fuck up
Back the fuck up
Back the fuck up <start> You took him away
Without a trace or tear erased from the story
Hate fills these bloodshot eyes
He was gone with no warning
I cry for peace but none is lent to me
I pray for relief just pull me closer please let me sleep
Only in dreams so blindly you follow
Only in death we come to amends
This bitter pill I'm left here to swallow
Or will I see you in the end
Why won't you answer me
Have you turned your face away
Answer me
Is it heaven or hell where will he stay
I'm done wondering where he went and how a good man lives to die
Desperate to hear your voice of reason
Speak up
Speak up and let him sleep
Only in dreams so blindly you follow
Only in death we come to amends
This bitter pill I'm left here to swallow
Or will I see you in the end
Give me a reason
Why you took my friend
Is it because he lost his way I'll only know in the end
I just need to know why
I'm lost on the inside
Replace the happiness that left this empty heart
Erase the death that now haunts my every though
Erase the death
Let him walk the earth again
Only in dreams so blindly you follow
Only in death we come to amends
This bitter pill I'm left here to swallow
Or will I see you in the end <start> Through winter storms be rode through icy mountains and cold valleys be rode
fear in his mind fear of death this fight could be his last
one mans battle against forces of evil this was his destiny
He had spoken with the dark the evil itself he could not be turned
and a choice was made in the realm of darkness to cut this warrior away
with his sword and armour he will fight the dark if he can.
He will be remembered for his great courage
he will fight for his honour and pride until the end. <start> Creases in the depths of our existence
Without which there can be no substance
These rifts and folds within our lives
Each day a new disruption arrives
Our sense of will
Which path to take
Discovering another choice to make
Now we exercise
This given night
And what is entailed
Is taken in light
Consequences that we dealt with then
Return for us to control again
From experience all wisdom is gained
To find sanity where once all things
Seemed insane
Our sense of will
Which path to take
Discovering another choice to make
Now we exercise
This given night
And what is entailed

Consequences that we dealt with then
Return for us to control again
From experience all wisdom is gained

From experience all wisdom is gained
To find sanity where once all things
Seemed insane <start> A wasteland grows inside my mind
As the moons sets before my eyes
My dreams are old and milleniums passed by
Torn  in a strong reality
Born  into the wrong century
I am soldier of dark existence
I'll last eternally...
I am the triumphator
In the grip of eternal frost
Domination devastation
Eternal damnation
..Not just evil imaginations
Drum auf bereit zum letzten Sto
Wie's uns're Ahnen waren
Der Tod sei unser Kampfgescho
Wir sind die schwarzen Scharen
Eternal Damnation...
Und dem Leben soll kein Reich mehr bleiben
Total devastation <start> Your world does not seem too fetching
Nor your way to live your life
So routine and so honest
It would not hurt with some lies
It is time to cast aside your chains
Let's hide your fears and let things change
No cruelty and no hatred
No anger never depressed
No time for satisfaction
No time to lay down to rest
Do not believe the lie
The lie that you have been told
They say it is the truth
But the truth is sold
It is time to cast aside your chains
Let's hide your fears and let things change
Your world does not seem too fetching
Nor your way to live your life
So routine and so honest
It would not hurt with some lies
No cruelty and no hatred
No anger never depressed
No time for satisfaction
No time to lay down to rest
Do not believe the lie
The lie that you have been told
They say it is the truth
But the truth is sold <start> Instrumental <start> We drove the long way home
past the prison gates and through the years.
And at the side of the road we saw a faceless man
whose old grey skin held his ageing bones together like an oversized leather glove.
And whose eyes sank so far into his skull they seemed as black as the midnight air.
But this mans gift was his words.
He told us how there is a fine line between order and chaos
that there are those in life who do not know what they are fighting for
but that it is the fight that counts
and that a man without principles is a fool only to himself.
And the years past and we never saw him again.
The eyes held a crystal glaze but the scent did not return. <start> Shattered dreams of you  I
Awaken consumed by tortured lies
Growing throughout eternity
The love that died is eating at me
Choice made to prolong the death
The empty feeling of your last caress
Nobody knows where the time has gone
Destined to stand all alone
Thriving off the anguish of life
Broken hopes of yesterday forsaken to believe
The fire burned beneath her fear has become
Stronger behind her stubborn pride
State of confusion reject the sickness
Torn between love  hate that is what I feel
Hoping to understand why my heart aches
For you as you crush my pride
My soul can't find rest
A contrast in view has made it clear
Thoughts shared were untrue
Cloned feelings of past failures
State of confusion reject the sickness <start> SO MANY TEARS AND PAIN IN THE NAME OF A GOD
SO MUCH SORROW AND FIRE IN THE NAME OF A LORD
WITH THE NAME OF GOD SPOKEN OUT
WE HURT OUR FELLOWMEN
WE'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR AGES
I FEEL SAD
PEOPLE'S HOLINESS IS INFITE WHILE
THEIR TOLERANCE IS SLIGHT
BUT RELIGION MEANS MUTUAL
CONFIDENCE LOVE AND HELP THE OTHER
EVEN UNSAINT MAN
UNFORTUNATELY THE FAITH IS JUST A BEAUTIFUL
COVER UNDER WHICH
THE FALISITY  EVIL LIES IN WAIT
I FEEL SAD
ONE THERE'LL COME THE DAY WHEN
THE SOUL CLEAR PEOPLE REMAIN
THEY'LL CARRY THE LIGHT IN THEIR HEARTS
AND KINDLE LOVE AGAIN
THE DAYS OF TRUTH AND TOLERANCE WILL COME
I HAVE FAITH IN IT  <start> Blow your trumpets let the feast begin.
Sing for us minstrels tonight.
Let the coronation shimmer and shine
In the golden sun so bright.
In a velvet mantle he takes the oath
I will protect and serve my homeland
In the name of our lord.
Stand by me and we will prevail.
Hail
Remember the words of the old and wise
About what's wrong and what's right.
Do you know greed's face the tongue of the snake
Or the shades of black and white
Receive the crown
And wear it with pride.
With it comes more than just the glory and gold.
Embrace the task
To stand by our side.
Fight for our freedom with the powers you now hold. <start> Shine for me misery
Devils rapture their coils
Suffer the fathomless end
Until we parche with sermons again
Strangle me slowly
Enter my palace of pain
Cover your screams
'Cause the wind will carry all your words away
Pass me the bottle
Pass me the venomous wine
Pass me this deadly brew
And I will drink and die again
Shine for me lust and thorns
Compromise carven in suns
Hatred of my own feet
I will never be able to walk this ground again
The rain has waited too long too long
Pass me the bottle and
I will drink and die again
Shine for me Misery <start> Reaping dispel commence to kill nothing can stop what you call is god's will
breathe in the ill let upon earth serpents of satan from fire return
killing the lambs rites unperformed rivers run red with the blood of their lord
pleading of prays cling to the dead bring back the christ to be slaughtered again
empowered by blasphemy raise the gates of hell
end of time upon the earth your lord of lords befell
caught up in death back to the blade christians destroyed and devoured in rage
born of the devil soulless insane spit from the fire to feast on the saved
behind the light thorn of the blessed never to bow before god to confess
heathen to some shadowing fiend appointed by satan to crush his mistake
empowered by blasphemy raise the gates of hell
end of time upon the earth your lord of lords befell
bleed this world of christian blood revelation dead
awaken from your prophecy and tear them all to shreds
turn the cheek and drink his blood suffer in defeat
fall from grace and beg before your mortal enemies
tear out your heart i will never pray
fucked and forgave don't believe what you say
where's your god

fucked and forgave don't believe what you say
where's your god
liar he is dead
liar blasphemy

liar prey unto god fool you to death <start> A black heart in an empty shell where the desperation laid waste I am you
A blank page in an unknown book and the opposition you face
I am the endless scar the broken hope the gaping hole in your faith I am you
The dark trail of endless graves where all the lifeless lay
I am waiting for that blade to fall and cut me free of this
Hollow life that leads to all the ends that dont exist
Time to burn this design to free ourselves
We will burn this together
Time to fuse this design to make us one
We will burn this together
A new voice for the broken souls in a world awaiting its death I am you
An everlasting well of life for the hopeless and the wrecked
I am the dying self the narrow path the calm that conquered the storm I am you
The cross hairs on the head of shame the negation to conform
I am waiting for that blade to fall and cut me free of this
Hollow life that leads to all the ends that dont exist
Time to burn this design to free ourselves
We will burn this together
Time to fuse this design to make us one
We will burn this together
I will rise
I will break this
You will rise
You will break this
We will rise
We will take them down
Rise and break them down
Down down down
Break them down
Time to burn this design to free ourselves
We will burn this together
Time to fuse this design to make us one
We will burn this together <start> Battle weary Saxons fight the fight to grip the north
Studded armoured warriors defy this mighty force
On the hill the men all raise their swords up to the sky
An axe strikes the shields of steel another victim dies
They're coming after you run for your life
Warriors of hell fight the fight
They're coming after you run for your life
Saxons of the Fire ride tonight
Running 'cross the plains of fire scorched blazing steel
The axe falls on another man screaming through the fields
The mighty sword is seeking men  slicing to the bone
You never can sstain the force to drive these Saxons on
They're coming after you run for your life
Warriors of hell fight the fight
They're coming after you run for your life
Saxons of the Fire ride... tonight
They're coming out of the sunset fire too many to hold back
Draw your sword you dreaded fool you're under our attack
Heathen men of distant lands were forced under command
Blood  sweat fall to the earth the Saxons make a stand
Many men took many slaves on this bloody day
Warriors  savages seeking out their prey
Metal hitting metal in this war for noman's land
Blood  sweat fall to the earth the Saxons make a stand
The battles over villages are burning to the ground
The many men who've went to war are lost but never found
Winners are rewarded well boasting of their scars
Turn toward the blazing sun to quest the land of far
They're coming after you run for your life
Warriors of hell fight the fight
They're coming after you run for your life
Saxons of the Fire riding... tonight <start> Music Mikael Dahl  Lyrics Andreas Gtesson
There he stood before the black iron throne
watching the dreadful creature of bone
On its fingers gleamed silver and gold
Fear battled greed would his luck hold
Long he stared at the fearsome dead king
then he reached up for a golden ring
With flaring eyesockets the king grabbed his hand
and spoke with a voice that was dry as sand
At last I'm awake I'm finally free
The curse has been broken shattered by thee
So foolish mortal thou dare to steal from me
For that thou shalt die but undead thou'll be
my servant for eternity <start> Let chaos entwine on defenseless soil
Remove errors of man and sweep all the weakening kind
I am war I am pain
I am all you've ever slain
I am tears in your eyes
I am grief I am lies
Bygone are tolerance and presence of grace
Scavengers are set out to cleanse the human filth parade
I am pure I am true
I am all over you
I am laugh I am smile
I am the earth defiled <start> I would describe it as an invisible darkness
Casting a shadow a blinding black
Guarded by hope my soul is kept from
The bloody claws.
Look beyond what vision lets me see
Time after time unneeded misery
Holding tight to my dreams
I own no price for you
I grip them tight and hope for sight.
Open my eyes wide to see a moment of clarity
Confusion gone it's in your hands
Your turn to ask why.
Life is like a mystery
With many clues but with few anwers
To tell us what it is that we can do to look
For messages that keep us from the truth <start> The incoherent system of life
Structured in my self dark ideology
But why am I sombre with pride
It may be a prelude to a symphony
Through this prelude Carnal Confinement
Anguish was my closer friend
Once into the world of breathingless
I'll be glad to meet my end
My flesh I overwhelm
As I rise in ecstasy
Proceed into the realm
Of blissful immortality
Winds of pureness I inhale
How can they love this life so miserable
I neglect my being
How can they trust this God so feeble
The inner belief now I deny
I structured in myself my proper entity
Innerprelude increases my will to fly
Sounds of Blackness my energy
Through this prelude Carnal Confinement
Anguish was my closer friend
Once into the world of breathingless
I'll be glad to meet my end <start> Are they vagabonds in your phrases
Drowned voices in the edge of time
Amid peals of laughter
In stillness and my beast goes rapidly and hides
My wild thoughts of you
Do they feel this time
See it through to the end
Part is wasted and part stille goes
I won't heed your call
I have left myself here and
I won't let you go

My wild thoughts 
Do they know 
 this time
See it through to the end <start> M  L Thomas Eriksson
Far away from twilight I'm searching for my soul
But still I can't find what I've journeyed for
All the distant places I've passed along my way
They seem to be fading with the remnants of the day
BRIDGE
See me now with the tears in my eyes
Hear my sight as I reach out for the light
CHORUS
So conquer the world in the afterlife
Peace now for my soul
A new revelation has just begun
Secrets left untold
Crossed the fields of sadness and oceans of true love
Now I enter the realm of the dark beyond
Embraced within the powers I've longed for all these years
Redemption must be close at hand to wash away my fears
CHORUS
So conquer the world in the afterlife
Peace now for my soul
A new revelation has just begun
Secrets soon I know
Fire in my eyes I feel the pain inside that's ripping in my entity
Do I believe what I see
And so many times I have failed to pass this test of faith
But now it's my turn the rest of the world shall burn
Far away from twilight you're searching for your soul
But still you can't find what you've journeyed for
When you're on that journey just like me some times ago
Remember what the wise men said Go follow your heart all the way
BRIDGE
See me now with the tears in my eyes
Hear my cry to the sky as I reach out for the light

So conquer the world in the afterlife
Peace now for my soul

Still fuckin' here are ya Well I couldn't tell it. This is a track from our first promo video the one with the dwarves and the amputees and the freaks in it and that was just the fucking band <start> They're out get me I can't escape 'cause' they won't let me
They won't forget me They'll get me in their grip and sweat me
They'll wait me out and then move in under my skin
They'll make me doubt They're out to make me let them in
I can't escape them there's nowhere I can run and hide
Make one mistake and that's when they work their way inside
They'll try and take me they'll break me down and suck me dry
I can't' let them shape me they'll make me up and make me cry
They're out to get me
I want to leave but they won't let me out
They're out to get me
I want to leave but they won't let me out
They won't forget me
They'll get you in their grip and sweat me out
They're out to get me
I want to leave but they won't let me out
They're gonna hit me cuff me up and then bullshit me
Then they'll outwit me dress me up and make it fit me
They'll lock the door now Keep it shut and throw away the key
They'll turn the lights out What no one knows nobody sees <start> I'm in love with the end of my rope
Ripping apart what I'll never sow
I'm alive somewhere deep in my soul
But it's a light that refuses to glow
Stay in the boat stay in the boat
And keep your voices down
Stay in the boat stay in the boat
Stay in the boat keep your voices down
Our words will outlast our minds
Our scars will outlast our lives
Our words will outlast our minds
Our scars will outlast our lives
We're all alone in the end of it all
Screaming out for the pain to stop
Forgive me forget me
I swear I'm not worth your time
Keep your eyes peeled keep your ears peeled
For the end of the world
Keep your eyes peeled keep your ears peeled
For the end of the world
Our words will outlast our minds
Our scars will outlast our lives
Our words will outlast our minds
Our scars will outlast our lives
Set my tongue on fire
Set my tongue on fire
Set my tongue on fire
Set me on fire <start> Brutal Truth <start> Ashes of the innocent
The end for you and me
Darkened screams of agony
Are begging Set me free
Mourning all your loved ones
As their bodies turn to stone
Violence hate and agony
Are what we've grown to know
Hold me show me
Bring me to my knees
So as the fire burns and the tables turn
We'll never rest in peace rest in peace
Ashes of the innocent
Remind me of the past
Taking scars of victory
The time has passed too fast
Singing broken melodies
Like shards of broken glass
Ripping through my reverie
These scars will never last
Hold me show me
Bring me to my knees
So as the fire burns and the tables turn
We never rest in peace rest in peace
Hold me show me
Bring me to my knees
So as the fire burns and the tables turn
We never rest in peace rest in peace
Ashes of the innocent
The end for you and me
Darkened screams of agony
Are begging Set me free
Hold me show me
Bring me to my knees
So as the fire burns and the tables turn
We never rest in peace rest in peace
Hold me show me
Bring me to my knees
So as the fire burns and the tables turn
We never rest in peace rest in peace <start> He lives among us
Stacking bodies piled to the sky
No one sheds a tear when the faceless die
The clouds of smoke cover the stench of rot
Returned to the dirt just to be forgotten
I hope you see their misery
We live in a place where fivehundred thousand people
Disappear without a trace
No funeral no regard
Just another number in the body count
He lives he lives among us
The serpent the serpent numbs us to their pain
When the sun sets and the devil leaves his hole
Stacking bodies over bodies just to steal your soul
When the lights out bodies burning up the land
Letting evil sit upon its corpse throne
This world is turning to the fires of hell
We bow our heads to the lawless one
He lives he lives among us
The serpent the serpent numbs us to their pain
No more peace no more light
We've destroyed this world
Darkness fills the sky <start> Platform ranting in the trees
Disturbed voices on the breeze
Huddled 'round the mad eyes screamer
A pointed finger the tin can schemer
Mad eyed screamer mad eyed screamer
Mad eyed screamer mad eyes screamer
A pointed finger the tin can schemer
Mad eyed screamer the corner speaker
Could be a preacher could be a teacher
You want the world to meet your maker
Now a lecher transforms a traitor
With a petrol flaring eye
Come and see the corner speaker
Come and his suit drip dry
The passersby have one obsession
To hear his raving to the sky
Mad eyed screamer on your knees
Mad eyed screamer you are not pleased
With the chatter in the trees
Your balls are freezing in the breeze
Mad eyed screamer mad eyes screamer
Mad eyed screamer mad eyed screamer
Your balls are freezing in the breeze
Mad eyed screamer you are not pleased <start> winding fury in halflight morning
desert winds of jezebel home again
she will drape the jewels from your praying hands
entice you to the flawlessness of her homeland
where the sunbronzed women come
come to set the earth afire
with the powers of their own hands
they shall run but they shall never tire
desert winds of jezebel
bring me home again
you lift me higher than the night
and bring me down again
a mother love so strong
it tears the tired souls from their graves
it lifts them higher than the night
and brings them home again
you give me hope
you give me life
give me your hope
where the sunbronzed women come
come to set the earth afire
with the powers of their own hands
they shall run but they shall never tire
so let the flowers dance and the wild skies rain
let the great seas give homage
oh jezebel  i have returned
a mother love so strong
it tears the tired souls from their graves
it lifts them higher than the night
and brings them home again. <start> If I were you id pack my bags and get the fuck out of dodge. I hope you enjoy your fifteen minutes of fame because this is going to be fifteen minutes you're going to want to forget. Faking your way through life on the back of someone else if everyone jumped off a bridge I bet you would say it was your idea. I pray your broken family heals your broken neck  eat shit and live. You dug your own grave I just helped you fill it in. <start> My love despises hate
And hate despises love
Catastrophic tone
Transforming the structures
In which we live
Activate the severed episodes
Different pose
Same physique
Which one in life does wisdom seek
The ultimate utility
Disturbing the behaviors
In such ways that can't be reached
Unless the mold
Was cracked a thousand times
Enhancing the developments
Awaken
Infinite third eye expansion
This thing of ours
Holds
Stands
Firm
Steel foundation
Deep rooted
Fractured skulls are opened
The temperatures are rising
Motivate the self to form
Up from the down
Exhaust
Recycled norm
Unaware of the excrements
Slapping you down
Arrows spewing breathing evolution
Cycles astound
Plentiful
The years shall go on  days
Plant the seed
Planting the seeds
Tap in to the master kingdom
Comfort the seas
Essence of all the dynasties
Arms embracing
The rivers overflow
Weaving frames stronger
Than mountains
Iron whole
Sluggard
Lost all the glimmer in the eyes
Lacking luster
Gloating with intent
Parasite
Brittle
Vanished
They the vicious
An aftermath of visual sensations
Favoring the intelligence
Wandering in search of understanding
Columns of three
Parade
Increasing with the presence of degrees
Designate
Constant elevating
Mental state
Competing with the cattle
Sponge soak consume
An assortment of the
Many flavors that pursue
The suggested connection
Bursting into an emotional collapse
This thirst has reflection
Multiplied by all these things
All these keys
And all they bring
Unlock the doors to your excellence
I will inhale this green redemption
Fulfilling the true essence
Fall
Face first
In opposition
The stepping stone to progression
Radiate in this splendor
Ambition
Calculate the strategies
Disrupting the existence
Keeping the balances
Can you see my vision
Take this stone
Pile of brick
My backbone unbreakable
Legions of demons in heat
My war is spiritual
Chasing on the heels of my
Charred feet
Seducing
Burning me with breath
The vinegar posture pours
It infests
Suffering
Within yourself
While the truth has you dying alone
Hate behind these eyes holds a destiny
I use the pain to fuel the fire inside
Your choices have you trapped
Where every step leads to a path
That has you back at the start
You might escape defeat
In a world out to get you
But the finger on the trigger is yours
If I come of one
Will you understand the depths of me
Perceivable
I can only belong to the man in me
They no longer believe in a cause
They amputate
Persuasive speech to entice
The human flaws
I move to associate
We believe in the vision
We believe in the goals
We believe in the universe
And the hands that touch the soul
Persecuted for my gaping jaws
Bleeding the gums
Walking with the dogs
The ultimate reality sense of all strength
Heals the sores
Injustice prevents me
From the goals I set for me
Overwhelmed by boundaries
Power trips
Adversity
These demons fuck my mind
And have tried to suck my pride
Robbed me of my success
Driven me into unrest
But I shall not lie for them
Show them that I do intend
To exceed beyond the trends
Break the limits I've been sent <start> Instrumental <start> Hearken thou until I relate things
that shall come to pass in latter ages of the world
for we are the seeds of the triumph yet to come...
Only a few in the multitudes upon earth
shall be aware of what they do but all will
court the assassination of Christ's redemption again and again...
Their apparent choice of the cross against the serpent
Hides nothing from north to south but a call for chastisement
The sins of men will stink more than a pestilence before God...
What a balm for the soul of those who respire hellfire
To witness Abraham sacrifice his firstborn. Amen
Contemplate and say what is earth else than a frenetic psalmody for His
venue
Arise O Lord. Let not man prevail... visionary words indeed
For man is the key and man is the device
And out of his ranks shall arise the saviour draped in the blood of the
unborn
Scriptures say We do not think him to be the devil or a demon as some
others do
but one of mankind in whom Satan shall dwell totally...
for he is the man of sin the son of perdition
such that he will seat himself in the Temple as if he were God
Woe to thee Corozain... woe to thee Bethsaida... and thou Capharnaum
that art exalted up to heaven thou shalt be thrust down to hell...
For he will grow from child to man and extirpate
souls in a devilish whirl from your cursed bosom.
Fraught voices rise to the sky and beseech god to avert the incarnation
But mankind was the prism to the quintessence of corruption
Contemplate and say what is earth else than a frenetic psalmody for His
venue
What joy and glory shouts he who bears the mark of the Beast
Consumed and eaten have been the abundant abortions of mankind but now
none of them humans shall remain but what birds could not carry off in
their claws <start> intro
you know you look like an angel when you're sleeping.
I know you're not going to spend your whole birthday in the shower I'ma go pack up the car.
Looks like it's gonna rain.
Nah don't worry about it.
Verse 
it's only sprinkling i tell her nothing is ruined
we playing the liscense plate game I'm lovin' what she keep doin' to my inner thigh
rockin' the diamond earrings i gave her she's smiling lookin' angelic
all her friends secretly hate her beauty.
she knows she got it got me when she want me all erotic
next to her hand the K is burning a hole in my pocket.
I pull it over get her a soda I'm half gone
hit the bathroom stick the key in the jar to turn it back on.
look in the mirror throw some water on my face I'm snotty
thinkin' a things i'm about to do to my girls body.
the rain is picking up now my eyes are kind of lazy the sky is hazy she's like you look pale i said she was crazy.
push the pedal to the floor mat hydroplane corrected it fast
then slowed down past the car crash.
she put her head on my shoulder said she was gettin' a little sleepy
don't worry baby we're minutes from heaven.
Hook
Snap out of this Cage snap out of this. It's just a girl it's just the world that sucked the life from you.
Verse 
I picked my face up with glass in it
can't remember the last minute
glove box  my girls face mashed in it.
I called her name out but she ain't respond
pulled her shoulder back touched her arm  her entire fucking face is gone.
I see her breathing I'm pleading with Jesus leave her lifeless
don't leave her like this reach for the birthday balloon of nitrous.
I'm trying to dial for help with hands I can't feel
stuck in the drivers seat my broken ribs  grippin' the steering wheel.
she squeeze my hand and let go I shoulda been sitting shotty
and the rain wouldn't still be pouring all over the angels body
i'm trying to crawl back in the K hole to get out of the car
but the K won't climb out of my nose and back in tha jar.
this isn't her i tell myself at least shes happy.
where ever she is her soul inside lookin' at me.
i pump my fist to bleed out to catch her and let the worms play
tell her i'm sorry i gave her death for her birthday. <start> Glory and praise to thee in all the steeps
Of Heaven where thou didst reign and in the deeps
Of Hell where fallen thy dream silently. <start> Don't look back nothing's left but
The bloodred text on the planet Earth's epitaph
Here they lie the human race
They fucked themselves and laid Earth waste
Blind to the fact that the bomb was coming down
Their sanity was sold for a beggar's handout
What they got is what they made
The final act of this tragedy ends with pain
So drunk with power they sit laughing at ground zero
One more drink push a button and let the fuckers go
It's a drama it's a game and lastly it's a joke
What's left for the ones who never had a chance to know
That the powers inside are driven with the lust to fight
So they hand us their lies and say it's gonna be alright
But the truth to it is they tax us just to kill ourselves
And our very own bombs will blow us all to hell
Reckless our neglect multiplies
The children of a cold war left behind behind
Come and see the doctor strange love is here
No other superpower means nothing to fear
Who needs a fucking treaty when we got guns
Fuck the little countries lets have some fun
Thinking back to where we came from
We can see how far we've come
But the price of our intentions
Burns us like the heat on the surface of the sun
Who can know what foul intentions
Start inside the human mind
For only the proud human being could conjure up
A plan to obliterate his kind
The flash of light was quick to blind me
Much like the lies they told me before
So naive we thought it was all over
But history returns with another world war <start> Marching through the woods
Our weapons held high
Here is our meeting tonight
Our fire burns higher then ever before
Out master's awaited with pride
We get immortality
We are eternal
We drink the blood flowing warm from christ
So sweet to taste the liquid might
Our satanic unity is done
Join force Belial
Hypnotic trance
Awaiting the beast
Waiting for the end
Whispering voices telling me
To rape to kill the priest
Floating caused by magic
Never ending hate <start> Babe if we can solve any problems
Why do we lose so many tears
Though I saw you go again yeah
When the leading man appears...

Ooh... it's the same thing
Baby can't you see we've got everything
Going on and on and on
Everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you
Everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you...
Go on then go free yeah yeah
Baby you're too close to see

Though I can feel your body move
Doesn't mean that much to me no no
And I can't go on saying the same thing
Cos can't you see we've got everything
Baby even and on and on
Everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you
Everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you...
I can't go on saying the same thing
Baby can't you see we've got everything
Going on and on and on...
Everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you
Everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you... <start> El amar ti es porder
Te condena la muerte
Segn el deseo
A sngre fria que cunde
Scacar de raiz estoy perdido
No puedo soportar a ese hombre
Lo siento mucho
La sangre no miente.
Es parecido al abono
Hay que poner punto final a esto
Esta bien En este monento
Listo para el combate
Con el agua al cuello
Me lo pagaras caro.
Dente por dente. <start> A crumbling empire
Where angels fear to tread
Into the ruins of a civilization
A society ripped to shreds
No semblance of order
Into the world which I abjure
Where the bloody blade is forged
Am I the cause of the cure
Chorus
Our destiny is soon revealed
Battle strewn no way to heal
We spread the wings of failure
For the world's last goodnight
Downfall
In the flames of the burning lands
Who claims to have the upper hand
Bonfire of the vanities and spite
Like Sodom and Gomorrah
Forsaken and alone
Look how the mighty all have fallen
We reap what we have sewn
When all the marble palaces
Are blackened sacked and burned
Will we understand man's ignorance
Through all the lessons learned
Chorus
Fall
Fall
Fall
Downfall
So quick to claim the credit due
Yet no one takes the blame
Like Nero played his violin
While watching Rome in flames
Implosion of our nations through
Decisions of its kings
Downfall of our creation
It's the end of everything
Chorus <start> It feels like I'm locked up
In this dark room behind bars
Where my mind is the cell
And this heart piece of me went missing
A shock that left me in the dark
Can I allow myself to have these feelings
Bringing me into temptation
Pin down the reality
I need to toss this blame I have in my head
All my future years already planned
There was made no room for mistakes
Even if the devil wants to lead me
Into a deeper state of doubt
Am I the destroyer of my bloodline
Am I the destruction to my own life
Am I the butcher of my future
Am I the downfall of my heritage
Am I the destroyer of my bloodline
Am I the destruction to my own life
Am I the butcher of my future
Am I the downfall of my heritage
This flesh I can't replace
But our soul may reunite
In a parallel world as travellers
Still I sense this presence visiting me
A piece of me lost in a twirl of misery
While a serpent
Still tries to tell me that I failed
Leaving me in a wasteland of desolation
How could I let this life slip through my hands
All my future years already planned
There was made no room for mistakes
Even if the devil wants to lead me
Into a deeper state of doubt
Am I the destroyer of my bloodline
Am I the destruction to my own life
Am I the butcher of my future
Am I the downfall of my heritage
Am I the destroyer of my bloodline
Am I the destruction to my own life
Am I the butcher of my future
I am the downfall of my heritage
I am drifting
Into a deeper state of doubt
I am
The destroyer of my bloodline <start> I don't want to spend the rest of my life
Looking at the barrel of an Armalite
I don't want to spend the rest of my days
Keeping out of trouble like the soldiers say
I don't want to spend my time in hell
Looking at the walls of a prison cell
I don't ever want to play the part
Of a statistic on a government chart
There has to be an invisible sun
It gives its heat to everyone
There has to be an invisible sun
That gives us hope when the whole day's done
It's dark all day and it glows all night
Factory smoke and acetylene light
I face the day with me head caved in
Looking like something that the cat brought in
There has to be an invisible sun
It gives its heat to everyone
There has to be an invisible sun
That gives us hope when the whole day's done
And they're only going to change this place
By killing everybody in the human race
They would kill me for a cigarette
But I don't even wanna die just yet
There has to be an invisible sun
It gives its heat to everyone
There has to be an invisible sun
That gives us hope when the whole day's done <start> Lead Malmstrom
Growing  Evil Faith is leading us
Control  Lost in propagation
Realms of chaos  sterile wasteland
Twisted humans  lost their value
Drowning in a  wave of sorrow
Perished by the  evil desire
Realizing death divination of raising hell
Impure world betrayed raped destroyed
Degenerated breed reprobate genetic failure
Incinerating hope of generations to come
Harvesting the unfertile seed destruction isn't what we need
See the inauspicious coming fear the infernal chaos rise
Oppressed by the urge to reign
Wheels of bones on a road of flesh
Lead Malmstrom
Increase  Devastating space reduced
Fatal  Doomsbells screaming no response
Realms of chaos  sterile wasteland
Twisted humans  lost their value
Drowning in a  wave of sorrow
Perished by the  evil desire
Realizing death the progress irresponsible
Impure world betrayed the final dawn closing in
Degenerated breed...
Oppressed by the urge to reign
Wheels of bones on a road of flesh <start> Bleed on me digesting the clotted scabs
Blood thirsty
Ungodly
Passing on my curse the spell pussing gores
Of those I infect become my loyal servants
To ride me of my own rot
Whittling meat from the bones of the dead
Pulverizing pelvic regions with a sledge
The mutilated bodies I leave rotting after I
Have fucked them with my knife
Becoming a product of my own nigtmares
A bleeding sac of infection years deceased
I hide my slobbering skin
Covered by a victims flap
I love to watch the blood ooz down the bodies stump
Like scrap a vulgar way of life my hideous side
Now revealed
Remembering the future is the key to unlock my past
Leaking membrane consuming bodies
Carving out the cunts blood my lubrification
Spewing pus on rotted skin I celebrate my
Cruelty boils begin to form dripping on my tongue
Swallowing throbbing glands the juice leaks from
My lips my only thirst is pus eruption of cysts
Incurable disfigured bodies I rape the dying
Horrific sights now manifest penetrating inner organs
The ruptured organs leak the fluid that I seek
To break the incantation of my damnation
Split wide open bloated organs burst
Nerves uprooted reopening healed wounds
On my body
Sucking on the sores
Ingesting my own fluids
Selfparasitic puss indulgement <start> That's why I find it so amusing
That the Latterday Saints of our business
One attribute to me motives that just weren't there
And two accuse me of corrupting morality
Which I wish I had the power to do prepare to die
An encloaking dark epoch
In which all life is now appraised
Another valueless commodity
On which the paracious may feebly graze
Indebted homage to their mammon
Whilst the mort is the music of the meek
Transcendence from a beatifully brutal reality
Is what I seek
Noxious sully dolour
Is not the sentiment upon which we feed
But precocious consciousness
Draws out a morbid nous to bleed
Chiselling out seething words
Which cut deep down to the bone
Always legible
So be it on our own headstone
Rising to out own nadir
Reality we try to extirpate
Trying to raise a twisted smile
Similar to that silver plate
On a coffin which is joined
Hammering in each final nail
Last kill and testament
Left now intestate
Noxious sully dolour
Is not the thesis which is bled
A precarious train of thought
In which mental cattletrucks are led
Carving out skilful words
Which shear brittle bones
Always spelt out well
We just can't leave the dead alone
Monographic text
A terminal doctrine of diseased minds perplexed
Enunciated epigrams
Eschatological rotten requiems
Always our own worst cynics
Exorcisers of scorching scorn
Digging our own graves
But never stand over and mourn
The roulade now pandemonium
Displaced in the muggy sods
Espoused with the macabre
The dead we filch and rob
Munificant bale
From the deviants staid
Execrations taunting spiritual release
Exoneration upon the perishable we feast
Excogitation picking at the bones of convention
Exculpitation foul verbal conflagration
Epigraphic text a literary vex
The macabre perplexed with corporeality meshed
Euthenic text
An unpleasant journey to a world perplexed
Corporeal epigraphs
Eschatological unpleasantness
Always forever cryptic
Exercisers of twisted grief
Helping you to dig up the interred
Whilst fresh still are the wreaths
The harmony now pandemonium
Heard out in the muddy dirt
Espoused with the bizzare
We play on our own turf
Epithetic text
A macabre rality perplexed
Execrations literary tales of atrocities fairy
Exoneration harsh cold bloody marys
Excogitation a narcissistic eutechnique
Exculpitation perverse artworks so unique
Monographic text a literary vex
The macabre perplexed with reality meshed <start> False peace
None my friend in word
Batteling bards
None my friend in word
Bloodshed
Ill nature comes to pass
War gods
Ill nature comes to pass
Loke
Untame venomtongue
No ward on words of blaming tongue
Loke
Stinging venom song
No heart no hope for venomtongue
No heart no hope for venomtongue
In dismay the OneEyed gazes
With a grave brow
On the friendship of old
With a bleeding heart
In eyes of cold
Hating despising
Dawned decay of bloodline alliance
No use to dwell
On a friendship of old
Let the elder spite
and disgrace unfold
Blaming lying <start> so here we stand toe to toe. Like I said before It's time to face for ghost what makes you think time would make a difference Now that you're here I think It's best for you to listen. I don't think you want to hear the things I've got to say but if its the last things I do ill make you listen any ways stop standing staring in awe I will spit in your face and still back you will crawl. Back you will crawl. So convinced theres no way out broken promise that you've made. so convinced theres no way out no roses or footsteps will fall on your grave. I don't think you want to hear the things I've got to say but if its the last things I do ill make sure you listen anyway. stop standing staring in awe if you can look me in the face and prove I am wrong then Ill kill thy poet and cut the tongues from these songs I'm not afraid I'm not afraid but if I ever stood face to face I wouldn't know what to say hands start to shake blood starts to race I'm not afraid not afraid.
what makes you think time would make a fucking difference what makes you think standing here I would fucking listen. If I ever stood face to face I wouldn't know what to say I'm not afraid I'm not afraid. <start> I was a child
when they took me away from my family
I remember long and frosty winter
and people looking hopelessly for food
from this ancient time
our cruel lord ordered us
to look as dogs eat christian children
we were standing together and
cold wind was freezing our faces
our blood was hot
we learned to worship death
we were the children of his favourite herd
future warriors future wolves
our cruel lord ordered us to drink human blood
ordered us to eat human flesh
I got my first sword
I couldnt take it up easy
But i had to take it up
because I would be meat for dogs
I know the true code of life
spartan way of life and draconian laws
I've grown as a warrior
close to nature close to roots
now i'm the cruel
the last of the cruel lords herd
When i was a child i knew the cruelty
I learned to hate everything I loved. <start> Vocals performed by Ruben Rosas. Lyrics written by Mike Majewski. Music written by Brain 
Devour the disease filled scurge
that lurk beneath society
lepers that spread filth will bleed all over me
the meat of the healthy no longer does it for me
Crusty brown tainted meat seems to appeal to me
My blade will easily slide through the soft flesh
And the screams that ensue will surely delight me
fuck these decrepit ass walking filth factories
preparations will be made and the hunt will begin
A leper is found I slash at its scab filled throat
My hunger profound its blood is brown not red
it struggles to breathe
air bubbles emit from its neck
I gnaw at its face the stench makes me wretch
With anxious glee I puncture its torso
tearing from its neck to its asshole
inhumanly liquefied insides they've been rotting
inside for such a long time
its fucking filthy heart is still pounding
I plunge my blade right in to rid this freakshow
I grab a handful of the seeping brown insides
and gorge the whole fuckin slop in no time
I peel off large pieces of its crispy flesh place it in my mouth it makes me
gag but I must feast
as I bite down I feel the crusty scabs pop
I proceed to slice off my fingers then my feet
the pain is oh so lovely
Half dead I lie with a smile
from ear to bloody ear
the stench of death and decay still linger strong in the air
my heart weakens and my vision fades to black
but I still hear the sounds of blood drip from my own wounds
repeat st verse <start> The healing nails sting my bleeding heart
Takes my breath away
Tear myself apart
The little girl in my bed has a gun to my head
Looks into my eyes
And says she want me dead
You know that sleep comes with drugs
and I'll drink my fears away
I'm not a boyscout
I'm a lunatic
Lunatic
The bitch is dead
Lunatic
The bitch is dead
The fat lady sings tonight
That voice disgust me
I'm not a boyscout
I'm a lunatic <start> All my life it seems my line has been set
And this time I'm gonna play to win
'Coz here you are at my fingertips
Gonna reach right out and pull you in
It doesn't matter what you do
I simply gotta make you mine
And even though I cry for you
I could never break the tie
It doesn't matter what they say
I just can't get enough
It doesn't matter anyway
I'm never gonna give you up
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you go
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you go
Never never never never
Never never never never
Mama says someday that I'll meet someone
Who will take me away from you
I guess that she just doesn't know about love
There can be no substitute
'Coz what I feel for you is strong
I simply gotta make you mine
I have waited much too long
I can never let this die
It doesn't matter what they say
I just can't get enough
It doesn't matter anyway
I'm never gonna give you up
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you go
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you go
Never never never give you up
Never never
Never never never give you up
Never never
Never yeah
All this wanting and frustration I feel
I'm sure I'll pay the price
But I keep my dreams until I make them real
'Coz I know you're worth the sacrifice
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you go
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you go

Cursed Nazarene impotent king.
Behold great Satanas.
As he drives his nails deeper
Into thy hands.
The weak fugitive god eyes
Cries holy tears of blood.
As the evil one press down
His crown of thorn.
Ego vos benedictio.
In nomine magni dei nostri Satanas.

Oh crucified Nazarene
Where are your powers now.
When you are facing the greater force.
Cursed Nazarene impotent king.
Behold thee great Satanas. <start> Blanca blanca es la muerte cuando el dolor es tu salvacion
Blanca  blanca es la peste devorando al mundo con devastacion
El mar envuelto en llamas
Tropes siguen en marcha hasta el final
Es la rebelion de masas la ultima batalla de la humanidad
Eternos son los siete dias de la agonia terrenal
Negra negra es la muerte cuando el dolor es tu maldicion
Negra negra es la peste devorando al cielo con devastacion
Hambruna peste y violencia cubren la esfera en totalidad
Eternos son los siete dias de la agonia terrenal
Los angeles devoran sus alas cuando no pueden volar mas
Caen al mar de llamas penitenciados por su vanidad
Desde lo oscuro del averno el lucero de la manana rencarnara
Escrito en la profecia como el destino de la humanidad <start> I'll bring back my ways
A bit of shining to the wonder world
At times I feel a need
Forcing harder emotions of grief
Tumble down or on your knees
Let us wake in a giant form way
So we're buried We'll see
All those others as small and offensive
Heating up Lashing down
It smells like I've been here before
Purify the surgeon style
Turning our souls inside out
So who's the strongest to be
A piece of fragment stuck to relief
All our other hearts
When they're darkened by
Their souldriven machine
It snatches our souls to its womb
Fill us gently as fuel
As when it comes to mind
I'll keep it going forever and more <start> Demons descended upon the lands.
The fire of greed burned within their minds. They destroyed the paradise
that filled their eyes. From the east they swarmed to pillage
to populate the righteous under siege. The stream of invaders
rose into a raging flood. Now the arrow shaft lays broken
where the grasses dripped with blood. Unavenged apparitions of the
dead walk down this trail of tears that never ends.
Conquered by the sword by treaties that were lies. Millions perished in
the wars for their genocide. Decimated by manifest destiny.
Tortured and enslaved in the name of christianity. The stream
rose into a raging flood. Now the arrow shaft lays broken
where the grasses dripped with blood. Unavenged apparitions of the
dead walk down this trail of tears that never ends.
Manifest destiny prevails. Felled their rainforests flood their lands.
Ancient cultures destroyed by socalled civilized man.
The tribal peoples of today survival is at stake. History means
nothing if nothing's learned from past mistakes. Stop the unseen holocaust. <start> Majesty I've seen the fate of your lands
visions of hell invaded my dreams
believe me I am your only chance
I will serve the peace of your land
To protect and save my beloved world
King Morick there's no time to waist
By mounds and plains I'll destroy the enemies
Eleandra will shine once again
Young Doryan we have heard your call
Prophecies will become reality
By mounds and plains you'll destroy the enemies
Osyrhia's light will shine once again
Gods of war lands of freedom
On my way to battle
Lend me your force
I won't fight for gold or glory
I don't need no fame or pride
I will take my sword to veil upon my land
The victory is in my hands
Pain and torture all I caught in my sight
the visions of terror have burned my heart
I won't fight for gold or glory
I don't need no fame or pride
I will take my sword to veil upon my land
The victory is in my hands
we won't fight for gold or glory
we don't need no fame or pride

The victory is our my hands <start> Poco A Poco Dejamos De Hablar

Nada Es F cil Cuando Se Trata De Dos
Siempre Jugando Al Amor...
Aunque En Mis Ropas Huelas A Traicin
Aunque Imagines Cosas Que No Son
La Vida Es Un Permanente Adis
Quemando Las Horas Entre Los Dos. <start> As lonely as a poet on the walls of Jericho
Or the moon without the comfort of the stars
I am loathe to know it that a man without a soul
Is nothing but a spilled canopic jar
I proved it
Improved it
Drove a sonnet
Right through it
And in this state of bliss
Evil kissed with wet lips
Penfilled Fingertips
Which through me
For through me
Illuminati usually pissed
But with words of some hurts worth
I threw a party that extended God's list
Exciting new flames that my fame would claim for me
Reciting back the almanac of travesties
They call me bad
Mad Caliban with manners
Dangerous to know
A passing fad
Taught in all debauch
In excess and in canto
Grown wild
This child
Whole harems defiled
Faustina's and Mina's
Lady Libertine and her sisters between her
What spread of lies arise when lovers die
Which circle of hell is mine when I arrive
They call me bad
Mad Caliban with manners
Dangerous to know
A passing fad
Taught in all debauch
Crow against the virgin snow
Grown colder my shoulder
Like a boulder beside her
And bolder not wiser
My dark seed took up root inside her
That mouldered where older
Beddings would hold a passionate sigh
But Laudanum and soda
Lord Numb coda
Merited a forest of inherited spite
Fleeing grief for foreign maps
I still played vampire aristocrat
Unloading my gun in hot promiscuous laps
Then shooting swans in a gondola
I tripped my foot on a fallen star
And there's nothing like a mouthful of Venetian tar
To let you know just who you fucking are
Ville
The patron saint of heartache
I can't see my world is falling
The world is falling down

I Can't see my world is falling

Everafter can they hear my laughter

Never craft a better bed of disaster

The Patron saint of heartache
They call me bad
Mad Caliban with manners
Dangerous to know
A passing fad
Taught in all debauch
In excess and in canto
They call me bad
Mad Caliban with manners
Dangerous to know

Whereupon I tell them
To go fuck their mothers
As so....
On my grave <start> Global incubasis
Apocalyptic depression encrusts
Its foul eggs in the surface
Racial necrosis
Undergoing experiment
Prestigious are the malformed
Abandoned mother probed by famine
Devours her only neonate
Survival conceptually depletes to a cancer
Populous searching for the black cloud's gate
The implosion of the species
As an entity descends
Propagates disease
The beginning of the end
Entangled in the nexus of chaos
Pyogenesis count continues to rise
Fluids resin in calculated time
Atomic structures ensnared
Reinforcing laws of a time to come
Ideals spawn of a submolecular entity
Gnawing away at the ribs of god
Replacing with the chassis
To procreate life's scheme
Be it the backbone of man's preserving desires
Silicon tombstones lacing corpses with wire
Repopulate they must cybernetic cadavers
The earth in a truss while birthing the mangled <start> I'll still get the bars in Devlin I'm marchin'
Like a soldier serving in Iraq is
Now watch me eliminate targets
You should have known to anticipate carnage
Your attitude sticks like an arm pit
I've got bars harder then Arnolds arm is
And no man has gone red at me yet
So I'd say I'm here to stay like a scar is
I ain't immigrating I'm lieing
And waiting and debating
Just what I'm going to be taking
I ain't faking so don't be mistaken
Like I've gone soft for the ratings
I'll take you up to the top
Of the dirtiest derelict block
And then throw you over the railings
And the only motive was hatred
Has Devlin gone soft
Does Devlin think he's bad
Nah he thinks he's at the top
All your bullshit makes me mad
But the drama don't stop
So alarms are ringing off
'Cause with the bars I'm still a lot
I've been as dark as dark has got
And now I'm marching through the fog
Tarantula creep all over the beat
Gargantuan and get under my feet
I'll stamp on ya I won't ramp on ya
The games like a letter
And I just took my stamp honor
And if dinner ain't served
Then I'll back  stella's and stamp on her
And sip on a can while I'm drowning her
While I'm pinning her down as I strangle her
I'm the murkiest white man handler
Till this very day been around here
If I was plotting then I weren't like the sound of ya
You get naughty I get a bit rowdier
Still you won't let them throw back a pound at ya
Don't place me in a box you cocks
If there's one thing I'm not it's fucking rectangular
Has Devlin gone soft
Does Devlin think he's bad
Nah he thinks he's at the top
All your bullshit makes me mad
But the drama don't stop
So alarms are ringing off
'Cause with the bars I'm still a lot
I've been as dark as dark has got
And now I'm marching through the fog
I'm marching through the fog
It's dark and I've been lost
But with the bars I'm still the boss
And now I'm back where I belong
I'm marching through the fog
It's dark and I've been lost
But with the bars I'm still the boss
Keep on marching through the fog
Devlin I'm back and I'm harder then nails
I was raised in a place so foul
With my mates in my pals house
Wetting up papers on the scales
But now I shoot bars from the mouth
Keep marching them in or keep marching them out
I'll barge you around like a bully in a playground
If you ain't ready for the regime stay down
I'm going hard for the whole UK now
I'm harder then granite large I'm titanic
Infact make your faculty panic
Like a madman acting erratic
With bombs in the basement and straps in the attic
A confrontation would have to be tragic
Like the coppers when he met Harry Roberts
Let him have it
Has Devlin gone soft
Does Devlin think he's bad
Nah he thinks he's at the top
All your bullshit makes me mad
But the drama don't stop
So alarms are ringing off
'Cause with the bars I'm still a lot
I've been as dark as dark has got
And now I'm marching through the fog
I'm marching through the fog
It's dark and I've been lost
But with the bars I'm still the boss
And now I'm back where I belong
I'm marching through the fog
It's dark and I've been lost
But with the bars I'm still the boss
Keep on marching through the fog <start> Azrael Angel of death
Go forth into that dark night
On the narrow threshold stands a legion
United they sing out but one name
Sword to pointed sword
Wing to pointed wing
Language unpronounceable
For human tongue  for mortal senses
Lnaudible yet loud as thunder
Cracking silence in that cave of winds
Azrael Angel of death
Go forth into that dark night
You're the lamp onto the realms of shadows
As you would enter the arms of your lover
Drawn me higher into the night skies
Take my hand and guide me on this journey
Dispel fear with understanding
I am your temple
The temple within all evil dwells
All I am is light and shadow expressed in the manifest from
Orion I lock my visions onto the stars
I am your Bipolar chaos
Of proud heart and valiant soul
Death zone  reflections in liquid glass
Cry tears  tears that gleam like falling stars
Death zone  barren planets teemed with life
As I warp my wings around this universe
And collect billions
Of souls  the souls that rope
Upon the planets surface
Glimmer as tiny blue flames
Azrael
Vale of shadowed twilight spheres
Bearer of the millennium's pain
Azrael within without everywhere and nowhere
I am the essence of all life and death <start> Verse 
There's no use in crying
All my tears won't drown my pain
Free me from your sorrow
I can't grieve you again
I watched you let yourself die
And now it's too late to save you this time
Chorus
You bury me alive
And everybody's got to breathe somehow
Don't leave me to die
Too consumed by your own emptiness and lies
Verse 
All I did was love you
And now I hate nightmare you've become
I can't let you fool me
I won't need you again
I watched you let yourself die
And now it's too late to save you this time
Chorus x
You bury me alive
And everybody's got to breathe somehow
Don't leave me to die
Too consumed by your own emptiness and lies
Make me feel this love we used to hold
All I see is black and cold
As I try to pull you down
To the ground the ground
Everybody's got to breathe somehow
Don't leave me to die
You're too consumed by all your emptiness
Chorus x
You bury me alive
And everybody's got to breathe somehow
Don't leave me to die
Too consumed by your own emptiness and lies <start> Selling hope to the hopeless ready to bleed them dry and take their dignity
So get up on your stage and say they need what you have
When your words mean nothing to you or me
We know that you're faking it
You may have them fooled
Will they see it's just a trick
We can see straight through you
We'll see if you can save yourself
A liar in Heaven makes an angel in Hell
There is no substance in what you sell
And now the world see you for who you really are
Impostor
You may have them fooled but we can see straight through you
Don't bow to liars
Don't bow to liars. <start> Cast away in solitude between the divide of dimensions
Frozen in timeless aura a catalyst of colors
The abyss...
I was born in the fibers of oblivion the saturnine keeper of mystery
and malevolent patriarch of chaos
...they fade into the shadows I cast... 
Darkness Chaos A malediction An abomination
...they fade into the silence I keep...
Dark Matter Gods
The abyss is the elder of time
Dark Matter Gods
The void is the archetype of being
For each step nihility a paradox an epoch a quantum crevasse...
Worlds are lost in my path
...they fade into footsteps I leave...
Dark Matter Gods
The dark mass is the father of all <start> You're dead you fuck
You're dead at my feet
My revenge is almost complete
Your eyes staring
Staring into space
Seeing nothing no heartbeat
Limp cadaver shut up forever
Life snuffed with no remorse
I will humiliate your corpse
You lay dead I laugh alive
My blood pumps adrenaline rises
Can't help laughing as I look
At your corpse underfoot
Stepping on your chest
I yank down my pants
My butt hole dilating
To humiliate your corpse
You lay there limp contorted
I pinch a loaf for you
Your face is spattered with my shit
A pile of brown on blue
You're dead you fuck
You're dead at my feet
My revenge is now complete
Your eyes staring
Staring into space
As my urine dribbles down your face
Life snuffed with no remorse
I've humiliated your corpse <start> I'm in line for the murder. First come fist served
You aim for across the hall your vision blurred
is this what you want from me to hear me scream
I'll die suddenly my blood on your hands
i'll die a tragedy you'll live in fame
here comes the last masquerade
we need a doctor baby
don't you just love a good time I do. <start> No tengo nada que hacer
Todo me da igual
Me aburro en cualquier lugar
Why voy de aqui a alla.
Recorro la ciudad
Camino sin parar
Why ya no se que hacer
Ni a donde mirar
Que es lo que me pasa
Esto no es normal
Tu sentada en un sillon
Yo en la esquina del bar
Nos miramos sin parar
No puedo disimular
Algo me hare pensar
Que tu eres para mi
No puedo resistir
Ni un momento mas
Quiero why no puedo
Seguir tu juego
Ya no tengo solucion
Estoy loco de atar
Ya no tengo solucion
Estoy loco de atar
Ya no tengo solucion
Estoy loco de atar
Ya no tengo solucion
Estoy loco de atar
Ya no tengo solucion
Estoy loco de atar
Ya no tengo solucion

Hey hey hey hey
Loco de atar
Hey hey hey hey
Loco de atar <start> Just thoughtless words of filth filled with influence
You no longer feel the presence of wit
Losing all self made shape is an easy step up
And reality is a maze being truly unable to lie
Simplicity the twisted lifework so full of might your cheap disguise
Trust me with no fucking doubt but pride
Learn at last to read now between the lines
Weakness for remorse is an instrument
And irony means wisdom if you are soon to try
The sicker things will join me now
Out of mind revering echoes so full of shit your plastic kingdom <start> I killed the beasts on my fathers side
My dagger sled into the black hearts
Courage and power I felt power killed the greed
Pride was my desire fear I defeat
Blood spread in this night
The ground soaked from the blood
Death shining so bright
Blood on the hands in this night
There was might I feel might
Might about life and death
Might to extinguish the life of the beasts
Might to kill with my hands
Might to crush my enemies
Might about life and death
Pride was my desire
Blood I feel on my hands <start> Welcome our friends
enter our realm
we will rise again
with your power we will win
Show us your hands
let us hear your voice
without you we can't win
Worship him high above
to see walhall one day
so we fall in love
with the old great lord
Show us... <start> 
We are wrong to try and overthink this life
We're selfish to trust a ghost even trust ourselves
There's nothing but start and end
Again and again
It's beyond us and everything else
Leading us to hate ourselves and make this scene a home
Let's make this life our own
Mother there's blood on the highway
He let it all go now there's fire in the alleyway
Father why didn't you tell me
I can hear what the mirror's been saying to me
If there's one thing that cuts deeper than this broken glass
It's the truth
There's no silence in the air
All this noise is too much to bare
Any more of this and you'll never listen
Be sorry for yourself and understand
If you're honest to God
I hope you see it through
And if you're honest to God
Faith will disappoint you
It will disappoint you
When you're separating identities
Just to reach yourself
Just to reach your inner being
No more miracles to pay no more constant irony
Just when you pray voices faint
And no one cares when you laugh in the face of the faithless
And just so you know I get quiet when the room spins
I keep my sanity sheltered while you bury your skeletons
We all meet our crucifixion
There's no silence in the air
All this noise is too much to bare
Any more of this and you'll never listen
Be sorry for yourself and understand
If you're honest to God
I hope you see it through
And if you're honest to God
Faith will disappoint you
And before we die we're forced to make a decision
About where we think we're going

So don't try to tell me what you think you've noticed for me
I'm lying on my deathbed
His head hangs over me
Don't fall asleep.
Don't fall asleep you're here with me.
Don't fall asleep. <start> Will the hypocrisy ever cease
You made the bomb and made the mistake
Make us fight to cover your idiocy
In this country with it's socalled democracy
We ask why and we get no reply
Then we ask about or future we will die
Forget our dreams and go to war sudden death
The bomb is dropped it's all over nothing left
Can't you get it through your head
You'll make us fight until we're dead
I won't kill my friend or foe
Fight your own war 'cause I won't go
Finance your war with our death
Won't die for my country screw the U.S
A country dying we've got no say
You fuck up but we're the ones who pay
Won't help the poor or be second best
Either you like it or die like the rest
We all mean nothing to our twisted earth
Why kill one another what's it all worth
Use your head and look what we've got
A future filled with nothing we are left to rot
From disagreeing to the threat of war
Blow us off the earth will even up the score
I won't pay the price of fate
To fulfill your lust and hate
When it's all over and it's all been said
You sit pretty as we lie dead <start> I sit upon
An ornamented throne
In front of those
Who celebrate I'm gone
My eyes of glass
Witness the twisted mass
They dance in joy
I'm ignorance's toy
Pure child
Immaculate
Cold white
And innocent
I give release
From life in pain
I am idol
I am their hope
I'm dead
Fanatic
Ecstatic
Obsessed
Blessed with death
Stench of mortality
My body rots away
They boil my flesh
Prolonged decay
Extending this insanity <start> Do you know me
tell me what you believe
how dare you judge me
i am more than what you see
i made this life
and everyone a friend
still you turned on me
shown true colors
you never listen
you hear the sound
you never listen
and fuck the words
never ending every things become a trend
i hope you had your fill
cause this is where the bleeding ends
slowly dying
were worked down to the bone
go against the grain
or die alone
i wont change for you
cause you will never change
i live my life everyday
you just fail and fade away
dare you judge
turn on me
you just fail
fade away <start> I sit alone in the basement
Facing chasing these wicked demons
Got thoughts up in ma head of my daddy's wasted ssemen
Havin' her in the bedroom
 'cause I'm not breathin'
Feelin like death is getting closer and I can't stop from secedein'
Do I run to the mirror
Look at me and pull the trigger.
Hooker said body found dead and gone
Well shit just another dead nigga.
My future lookin weary hear me
Maybe after that wanna flex wanna hustle
Never lay down a bit and tussle
Take my life in one night
Now I'm havin' visions
Do or die based on decisions
Movin crystal sista mssions
But I wanna be and fly away like pigeons
I missin my family an all
But I just don't know dog
'cause I left another dog in the back yard
An he jab wit the left an he hit hard


And that's why I stay low
'cause the world's gettin' too cold
We yellin it off the O
'cause the world's full of bitches

Cold cold world.
They ask why I stay low
'cause the world's gettin too cold
We yellin out the O
'cause the world's full of bitches
It just is
Cold cold world
Picture two worlds collide
Every civilization died
Catchin bullet holes
You can still hear they mamas crying
In every second is the grave laid tight
Niggas getting murdered and losin paper and they life
These days ain't so bright now
This is a message to how shorties gotta pipe down
I know we wansta weather crime on the streets
We hear the sound of the heat
And every round is takin ya six feet
I heard the cops killed you last week
You got shot tryin to take the phone off the seat
Rest in peace I know it's better when your eyes sleep
God take us by the hands as we right deep
No longer seek for the things that weaken the flesh
Did we believe and have faith when it bothered us
I understand that we all must return to dust
And leave behind everything that our hands have touched
God this world is too much.

I first took a breather
Heard a voice to the 
Nigga tryin tear ma life line
Get it back and to ma right man
Seeing blood on the sleece and a black nine
Please god is it my time
Hold on to what am I face up for
Black the night was
No light was
Willing with the wind blew in
Below with a slug to the moon
Open in time with the tomb
Looking for the hospital room
Feelin kinda dizzy from the blood shed
Turn around and heard a thug said
I gotta place we can play at
Hop to da ' never get at all red
Come out quick before we all dead
To the back row
Sippin henesey
Better get relocated to the ash row
Here that nine with the bulletproof vest go
Hottie lets go
Pull a chromium free with the vest go
Just a little on the testicle
Never leaving till the rest go
And it's best to know
Every dog on a day got a chance to bring
Got a chain for the best clothes
I wanna die my best slow
And even in my death glow
Lets have a prayer for the world the cold one
From the old to the small one
Just to say that we are one
Father listen
This world is cold.
 <start> Masters in microcosms of instantaneous.
Program the programmer to program.
Produce to pay for necessities and
Luxuries. Function in every facet in total willing isolation.
What will become the difference between the operator and the
Machine Until complete automation leaves them obsolete.
Tracked from the heavens by the gods of this world. Laughter fills
Glass towers. All is seen by unseen overseers
As boots crush down slowly onto throats.
All to maximize net gain the
Unpoliceable funnel spews misinformation
Yet most embrace the invasion the strangulation of liberty itself.
Peering forward
Into the evolution as the latticework of our future rises around us.
A cage to imprison the eventual outcome.
Unknowing inmates on the grid for execution.
Function in every facet in total willing isolation.
What will become the difference
Between the operator and the machine
Until complete automation pushes them into obsoletion.
Phased out to maximize net gain.
Subvert or this will be the end. <start> I have seen the result of our school system
I have seem what it does
I asked some kids about the holocaust
And they didn't even know what it was
Didn't that happen in some Time Life books
I didn't see the movie I didn't have time to look
Genocide is the product of every bloody war
And remembrance is a way to begin
But don't be so ignorant as to believe
It can never happen again
Remember <start> I'd rip the wings off Cupid's back to better his aim
Then maybe he'll shoot straight to my chest
And not below the belt
How can I trust him with these arrows when I know he'll miss again
But I can't live with constant accidents
So I'll arm myself to rid this world of Love
And on this Red Day the icon of love is bloodied up
And I found horns beneath his halo
I would stab him a thousand times again
To hear the scream of so many sleepless nights
Then maybe he'll shoot straight to my chest and not below the belt
My mother told me anything too sweet will surley break your teeth
Sweetheart you'll offer me again your chocolate covered razor blades
But I'll sweep you off your feet
So just bite this rose and let's tango
Let's dance 'till our legs fall off 
What a fool I was to trust in man made love
I'll never trust that lie again <start> The draconian laws of the King of Westmar left no man unaffected. In his will to restore order to Westmar and the lands beyond the Royal Guard was tenfold increased. Unruly elements among the populace was quickly sent to the gallows the highland salt mines or worst of all to the newly constructed and crowded factories filled with dark and twisted magical machinery fuled by stinking ichors and run by gigantic cobs.
Elf and dwarf once brothers to men were all singled out and charged with various crimes and accounts of treason. The once lively elven district of Westmar made way for smokespewing chimneys and the children of Val'inthor were rounded up and deported or worse. Public show trials and executions became a daily affair and it was at such a spectacle that the Islander once more heard the name of his dreams being called out with a voice so utterly familiar
A pale sun rises
the crowds are gathered
now red streams flow through the streets
Upon the pyre
Enchanted beauty
her eyes upon me
Witch Wraith
Light up the fire
And feed her to the flames
Let nothing remain
Now as I see her
standing before me
A stranger I know
Where have I heard that voice before
I'm stirred to silence
'neath brazen towers
Doubt fills my heart with fear
See clouds are massing
on the horizon
Her end is soon here
I should turn away
and leave her to her fate
but something draws me to the flames
Stop Halt
Who is this man
that walks unharmed by fire
That crosses the pyre
Now as I see her
standing before me
A stranger I know
Where have I seen her face before
Solo Lindskog
Solo Holmlid
Solo Mrck
Now as I freed her
they all stand before me
Stop Halt
Don't let them pass
They must not get away
Guards Stop them I say
Now as I see her
carried before me
I finally know
where I have heard that voice before

Regularity defining perfection
Neither sorrow nor contentment
Whispering emptiness frail words collapse
My weight only stirs the ground
How long can I hold your hand as you walk over graves
You search for tears of compassion
Yet find the comfort of winter
Reassurance dead like the falling leaves
Losing hope in your unchanging ways
All of my strength cannot save you
If you are unwilling to help yourself <start> instrumental <start> Ten more summers pleased the land
Ten more winters numbed the landscape
Time is running quickly
But in my brain a terrible dream never ends
I try to escape from my past
I'm damned to suffer a whole life
Life is a long and silent river
No real friends  for the little girl
Nobody understands  what's wrong with her
Her classmates  cheat her all the time
The silent girl  is discriminated against
Life is long and silent river
People shouting at me
You stupid girl
How strange you are  never spoke
I try to escape from my past
I'm damned to suffer the whole life <start> When we came through
The veil of the night
The fall of man
We gave you our hearts
The watcher
The sentinel
The God that took you away
Where ends our journey
We slip away
And shadow falls
We gave it all
You found no god
Mankind will forever weep <start> Engaged in a memory
Engaged in a prison of guilt
Surrounded by reproach
And everybody knows
Chorus
She flies over town in white shades
But you're left behind
With a thousand troubled minds
You cannot speak you're blinded by your grief
She flies over town in white shades
And guides every step
But still you feel alone
Cause angels don't come home
As the sky is clearing
You clear your mind
Hide all mirrors not to see
What the morphine couldn't hide
Shattered faces on the floor
Your broken mask serves you no more
Chorus
She flies over town in white shades
But you're left behind
With a thousand troubled minds
You cannot speak you're blinded by your grief
She flies over town in white shades
And guides every step
But still you feel alone
Cause angels don't come home
Chorus
She flies over town in white shades
But you're left behind
With a thousand troubled minds
You cannot speak you're blinded by your grief
She flies over town in white shades
And guides every step
But still you feel alone

 <start> Packed their bags and left that day one way ticket to outer space
mohtership has sailed away blinded by the comets fall
Faithfully they follow into the fire they ride
fearless hope by their side if only they knew the stories he told were untrue
Through the gate it's too late cast their lives into the lake of fate
no one told them it all was a lie  take my hand and together we'll fly
senseless tragedy if only they'd wait it's too late through the gate
Coins of silver for toils to pay made the potion and drank their lives away
mothership did not come through blinded by the comet Hale
Don't be fooled by men who saymy new religion is the only way
mother's love is there for you put your faith in what is real
Faithfully they follow into the fire they ride
fearless hope by their side if only they knew the stories he told were untrue
Through the gate it's too late cast their lives into the lake of fate
no one told them it all was a lie  take my hand and together we'll fly
senseless tragedy if only they'd wait it's too late through the gate
Faithfully they follow into the fire they ride

Doctors stand in my way my path to death
Ready to die take your last breath
Rotting corpse cancer fucking cancer
Cancered guts spilled out with therapy
Chemical injections lab poisons infections
Ready to die take your last breath
Rotting corpse cancer fucking cancer
Praying for death as you can see your life fading
Lying there in a terrible state as the cancer's growing
Ready to die take your last breath
Rotting corpse cancer fucking cancer <start> They raise their glasses as he surveys unseen
Wrath is increasing anger makes his eyes gleam
Seeing his foes celebrating their victory
He gives a promise that he will destroy his enemy
Godforsaken fools..... I will return
Raise raise my dark fiends of light
Up from your graves into the night
Raise raise my dark fiends of light
Up from your graves into the night
As he stands nearby he speaks the incantation
Tearing the dead back from their damnation
Ground starts to quake as they return from their graves
Thousands of corpses rushing ahead like waves
Godforsaken fools..... I will return
Raise raise my dark fiends of light
Up from your graves into the night
Raise raise my dark fiends of light
Up from your graves into the night
Follow him blind they have heard his call
Incessantly marching heading for the fall
Clattering blades made to strike and kill
Thirsting for blood their task they will fulfill
Raise raise the dark fiends of light
Up from your graves into the night
Raise raise the dark fiends of light
Up from your graves into the night <start> Holyman the liar
The madman and his call
Out on a crusade
Fishing for lost souls
Slimy holy snake
Selling false faith
Inject his lethal venom
Into weakened minds
Like flies to shit
They gather for mass
Approach the altar
Of madness
Let the ceremonial
Comedy begin
Live their life
With their head up their ass
Holyman with his bible
Deciever in disguise
Shields you from the truth
With promises of paradise
Blinded walk on the trail of lost souls
Insane minds bleeding for their saviour <start> IncarceratedBegin New life
Your Virgin Ass is thrown in a cell
Your Home is Now Behind Bars
The Land of Homos is Where You Dwell
Your former life has ended
Heterolsexual life has ceased
the new community in which you live
Is Ruled By Homosexuality
there's two Muscular Queers in your cell
you can't escape their Butt fucking Hell
this is your lifeit doesn't get better
You have no choice Butt to Surrender
Erect Penis Ejaculates
Your Rectum is filled With Semen
Your Penis is being Sucked
Your Mouth used as a Duct <start> Look at me now I'm bleeding
the river runs red no more dreaming
the dream is over we lost the war
the sun is rising the last time nevermore
Remember these words fragile is the life
hold on to the truth death is not the end
my pulse is getting slower my hands are numb
I look at the sky blinded by the sun
Chorus
The Lake of Fire  the holyland is in flames
betrayed by liar  the whole nation face the end
The Lake of Fire  the soulless one's to blame
betrayed by liar  for only fortune and fame
Betrayed by my brother forsaken by my kin
look at him now torn apart by enemy within
the war is over hatred grew stronger
remember me now as I am no longer
Chorus
The last echoes of the dying hope
carried by the wind the end is closing in
no retreat no surrender
is there a reason for this fight
or are we pawns in a game
like puppets on strings
born without sins
we are losing it all <start> J. Nordavind '
A cold sharpened blade
plunge through the skin.
Death triumphant.
Death the king
Blood on my hands.
Blood on my lips
I took the frail bliss of your eyes
and its darker than you think...
I violate.
I come at night.
My great endurance of body mind and heart <start> Music Patrick
Do mourn the glory days are gone
Like roaches scattering under a beaming light
Run out of history's backstage
As your flags burn over spoiled Eden
Looted for you to waste
Kings of the hill inflated frogs staged heroes die
Altogether World bowed in disrespect
Clenching teeth towering hate
World won't ever know peace again
In none we trust
Sowed salt within our soils
Fed us what even rats spit up
Perpetuating the times
When wealth spoke the speech
When wealth swung the whip
On sweat sown your power
Now harvest billions of enemies
Oppression is deserved for who complies to fit within
It is fantasy freedom tied to galleys we row
Docile on our way down the food chain
Livestock salivating at pellets in a trough
A fate to which we almost fell
Rolling meat screwed within the Machine
Silkworms soon to be boiled all others denied awakening
Like cattle we were bred raised and processed
Baited in with hopes for none to achieve
By scarecrows guarded under a gray sky
No wonder we were all afraid to open the cage never...
Woe to you mothers of all sores
Woe to the defeated
Great eagle fallen feathered
In ire crowds come marching
Ignited ablaze exploding
Don't you smell the sour stench of demise
Forseen all to nothing <start> Here we all feel alive
Here we use our minds
Let us form together
Use our minds
Recreate redesign
Visualize it
With a new world in our hands we will gain control
With a new world in our hands we will gain control
ReaLIZE that you will never feel this way again 
And what you want is right in front of your eyes 
So take it in and embrace
No more wasted faith 'cause we are wrong
No more wasted faith 'cause we are wrong 
Don't let it be easy
You needed such a direction to visualize perfection
Visualize perfection
We are wrong We are free
This is serenity
Stop holding on for nothing
I'm ready to face this world and gain control
With a new world in our hands
With a new world in our hands
With a new world in our hands
With a new world in our hands
Gain control
No more wasted faith 'cause we are wrong
We are at ease with the way we've grown
And only when the timing's right
We can start to feel the stars align
Don't let it be easy
Visualize perfection
Stop holding on for nothing
Visualize perfection <start> I see old spirits rise in brown eyes
a violet smile a lack of control
we failed to take the chance
long ago for a day like this I would have given
all my lifes future bliss
in the past I longed for futile days like this
I see old spirits rise in your eyes
a violet smile a lack of control
now we know what we have lost
short ago for a day like this I would have given
all my lifes future bliss
I still long for fertile days like this <start> Instrumental <start> Repeat this habitual course
To lift this weight which drags me under
Treading in my remorse
I must stay above the surface longer
Shattering shattering needed rest
Awakened reality I must confront
Without these idle hours of sleep
Welcome this simple change
Find solace in my frequent slumber
Leaving the once mundane
Escape this world of wretched plunder
Shattering shattering needed rest
Awakened reality I must confront
Without these idle hours of sleep <start> One chance
One shot
One bullet in the back of my head
And it came from the bottom of your heart
You couldn't find the words to tell me
So you went and found some bullets and shot me
What better than the kiss of a mm
To promote the heartbreak
Goodbye to the paramour notes
We used to be such a finely scripted romance
But now you're all alone in watching me drown in our
Last tragedy that you so proudly painted
Oh God how the bullet meets my lung
Just like the love it takes my breath away
Oh God well now it's ended
But the last laugh belongs to me listen up
This is my bullet of envy
This mess the cracks in your heart
That's what you've created
This the heartache that only you've invented
Oh God how the bullet meets my lung
Just like the love it takes my breath away
You're pulling the trigger pacing the bullet against my heart
Screaming the point  so I can have a head start to exit
But I'll break back through with my bullet of envy
My bitter revenge before your sweet tragedy
Oh God pull the trigger
Oh God the pull of a trigger
Say something more
To preach the sudden silence
My last words before your
Gunshot <start> Lyrics by Frode Glesnes
Music by Gerhard Storsund  Frode Glesnes
A freezing winter sweeps the land
A creeping frost sets in
The fog encircles the castle
Surrounded by a total silence
Black clouds weigh upon from above
The candles are the only lights
The trance is getting deeper
Reaching upon thy mighty thrones
Then an iceblue shimmer hits the wall
The wind whistles a melancholy tune
Feel their presence
Oskorei
During dark and stormy nights of winter
You may see the lights of Thule
Aurora Borealis
Crossing the wastes of the northern fields
Frozen by the cold that paralizes the will
Enter the darkest depths of the northern woods
Tormented by the heat of the hellburning flames
Black moon rising from the sea way up north
Wotan rides across the sky
His fallen warriors hails him high
A freezing winter
A creeping frost
Black moon rising
Thy mighty thrones <start> From the valleys of Leicestershire
And all over
Came mystic crew filth
The first was Dave Bushbabe
The second was Graham ponytail
They were mystic crew filth
Crew filth
Then from the land of the accordion
Came Dave Kiwi
He was crew filth
He had the shirts
He wouldn't meditate
on his monitor room
Mystic
Crew filth
Hey mystic crew filth
Crew filth
Crew filth
Crew filth
Crew filth
Where did they come from
The little motherfuckers
Nobody knows
Nobody bothers
Crew filth
Crew filth
Crew filth
One was a Kiwi
One was a Bushbaby
One had tattoos on his legs
One had brown spectacles on his head
Motherfuckers
Crew filth
Crew filth
Hey Kenny tell us about crew filth
Crew filth
Crew filth
Crew filth baby
But those crew filth
They had sensitive sides to their nature
They would smoke pot in their rooms
They were always behind you
That's why we kept our backs to the walls
You gotta watch your wallet man
Crew filth
What about crew filth Bill
Bill was King of the fucking Motherfucker crew filth
He had to do some work one night
Then his hair turned white
Crew filth baby
Crew filth baby
Crew filth baby
Crew filth motherfucker
He was the worst one of the worst
He was the worst one of the worst
He was the worst one of the worst
Gotta watch your friends
Watch your girl
You never can tell
He might kill a tab
While you're jumping off
All your friends might turn out to be
Crew filth <start> The high office of the President has been used
To foment a plot to destroy the President John Fitzgerald Kennedy
In a speech made to Columbia University on Nov.  
Ten days before his assassination
Americans' freedom and before I leave office
I must inform the citizen of this plight <start> Subjugation fuels
The hatred in our soul
Full destruction upon
The ones that we all loathe
Souls ablaze out of control
Burning hammers from the north
Down to the south
Retaliation forms
The hanging of our brood
Captured soldier has his eyes pinned
Then removed
Who's to blame This ruthless war
This devastation puts you out
In the ground
Doctrines received
From tradition and fire
Sealing my fate
Confirm why I was born
Annihilation is
Our anthem ringing true
Fall to pieces as our steel blades
Rip right through
Chaotic raids assume control
Burning torches in the night
To see us through
Conquered nations of our foe
We have subdued
Strength and honor from the helm
We bring to you tempered steel
Of knives and swords
This devastation puts you out
In the ground
Doctrines received
From tradition and fire
Stealing your tomb
Reaffirm why I chose war
Charging attack
Raise the fist of steel
Bring the pain
Rule the nations
Rule the world
Enslave the people
Drink messiahs blood
Raging black auras
Raging a storm
Evil marauders
Sphere of the dead a new system
Subjugation
Fuels the fury in our troops
Golden palace of oppression
Turns into dust
Souls ablaze a call to war
The foundation now assumes
Assumes control
Decimation is our anthem ringing true
Transformation of the future
Becomes the view
Skys ablaze departed souls
This devastation puts you out
In the ground
Doctrines received
From tradition forever
Sealing your doom
Confirm why I was lord <start> sun goes down once again
while I sit here and feel the tears
running down my cheeks
no I am not afraid of the dark
but the darker it gets the more I realize
that there is no one to depend on
no one to believe in
And so I wait to die here all alone
like the daylight dies while it is fading away
because nobody knows for sure
that the sun will burn through that cold night once more
...to where the skies are blue...
So I pray for someone
to come and make my life seem like its still worth living it
So I pray for you to come

And so I wait to die here all alone
like the daylight dies while it is fading away
because nobody knows for sure
that the sun will burn through that cold night once more
but still the hardest things to say
are the words that mean the most
So come on angel say that you
love me and nothing in this
world will ever scare me again.
Take me to where the skies are always blue... <start> One nation
One nation of gods
Divided by faith
Nation divided by faith
Witness deliberate war of attrition
Witness deliberate war of attrition

Judge lest you be judged
Eyes are blind
Blinded by violation
I hate your contention
I hate you violation
I hate your corruption

Words are banned
Words meant to enlighten
I hate your contention

Endlessly

Or go to work like a jerk and end up snoring
Tuesday's mail never fails
Collection agency wants me in jail
Wednesday's rules got me ignoring deploring all my tensions roaring
Thursday same shit different day
But these motherfucking rules will never ever go away
Fuck the rules
Friday night gonna be out of sight
If you're  they say drinking might be fun
On Saturday Bible says seventh day
The day of rest so have it your way
Go for a ride keep it under 
Respect the badge don't drink and drive
On Sunday gotta survive these fascist fools
Take your freedom back from the bullshit rules
Call me paranoid call me what you will
I got a fucking feeling something big is going down
Fuck the rules
Call me paranoid call me what you will
I got a fucking feeling something big is going down
Fuck the rules <start> My barren plan to be a better man
Rots in abandoned fields
These idle hands inherit spoiled lands
As the hungry become the pigs
We reap  we sow
We mourn who we were
Love what we lost
In the grave of... 
Laying with lions to hide my grief
From the beast that never sleeps
Our tired hearts tear us apart
Searching for the key
Reap what we sow <start> I toss up a coin to ease my last chance now
And stare with a smile when your light is gone
Yeah I'm standing at the edge engrained in red dread I guess I'm caught eternally
As weak as I am still I search high and low for a distance place
To dream away those years but I will never fall from grace again
Just follow the beaten track 'cos all you give you will get back
Desire  the final recollection your fire once burnt in me
I bury my faith to further close your chapter
Saw the seedless grapes of wrath and remain with pride in twilight <start> Dancing with tears in my eyes
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Living out a memory of a love that died
It's five and I'm driving home again
It's hard to believe that it's my last time
The man on the wireless cries again
It's over it's over
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Living out a memory of a love that died
It's late and I'm with my love alone
We drink to forget the coming storm
We love to the sound of our favourite song
Over and over
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Living out a memory of a love that died
It's time and we're in each other's arms
It's time but I don't think we really care
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Living out a memory of a love that died
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by
Dancing with tears in my eyes <start> Gjennom tkete daler

Gasping for air that isn't there
Feeling life's source draining away
Slowly slipping to God you pray
Eyes popping out as the face turns blue
Crushed windpipe swallowing in blood
Hopeless thoughts loss of breath
Loss of life strangled to death
Digging the grave in which you will lie
Buried head deep and left to die
Body paralyzed beneath the sand
Tide comes in...Asphyxiation
Watrlogged corpse Back from the dead
Rips the eyeballs from his head
Snapping neck blood pours down
Decapitated body rotting away

And they cry laughing as they die
They won't look into your eyes
Moonlight makes it so clear
Pierces the skin without the tears

Bite the hand that set 'em free
Same old song with a different beat

Getting so high but staying low
Stumbling look out below
Halfway's too far to go
Forget about heaven
And the book of fear
Forget about heaven

Domination by persuasion
Nightmare is after
Your ruined faith beckons grace
Hold their heads down
When kneeling to pray
Heaven lies the other way
Cheated angels turned away
Forget about heaven

Forget about heaven

And they cry laughing as they die <start> Four soldiers are riding together as one
Striking the enemies soon they are gone
Live by the sword
Never surrender they will carry on
Soldiers of war they are never alone
Flash of the blade
Riding through the fields
Carry on with steel
We're the ones that will carry on
we will make you see
We're the ones made of steel
We will make you bleed
The sword will tell the story
The sword will tell the tale
The sword will tell the story
The swords of the black knights
Plundering the village then burning it down
The terror of death will it ever be gone
Scream all in vain
One year has now passed and the soldiers are three
But still they are riding and using their steel
Die by the blade
Riding through the fields
Carry on the steel
We're the ones that will carry on
we will make you see
We the ones made off steel
We will make you bleed
The sword will tell the story

Assassinate kidnap and murder I will terrify
The death of an innocent I will justify
Target you are now in my sight
You'll never know what hit you you're blown by dynamite
I'm gonna overthrow you burn to the ground
Hijack or with a bomb I'm gonna shoot you down
Arson ransom I got a gun to your head

End of life shining bright goodbye we sing your song <start> Und uber das tal ziehen schatten so dunkel

Starving homeless soldiers
And who's to blame
Once protected our freedom and our lives
Now society has cut all ties
Once trained to defend our rights
At the risk of his own ass
Now sleeps in a cardboard box
Under the overpass
Under  under the overpass
Like discarded pawns in a sick game of chess
Seems to be no place for them in this mess
A dime or a penny whatever you can spare
They would work for food
For those of you who care
All used up and thrown out
Just like a worn out part
Keeps all that he owns
In a shopping cart
Under  under the overpass <start> Caught out in the pourin' rain deep within my soul
live a life of torture and pain will it ever end Will it ever end
Cold dark world seek my fortune what is right for you and me
All these years turn and run away from what was meant to be
Take me far away across the Seven Seas
we'll sail to yesterday our burning hearts set free
Goin' Home we've made some choices in our life time to make it right
goin' home so many choices in our life time to make it right
You said to me make this love last forever and a day
until you die in my arms nothing could ever separate
Take me far away across the Seven Seas
we'll sail to yesterday our burning hearts set free
Goin' Home we've made some choices in our life time to make it right
goin' home so many choices in our life time to make it right

Darkness put her painted claws in me again
Her vision drowns like service wine
Whispered kisses so divine
I was blessed but now I've come undone
Storm clouds roll out overhead
Above their master
End of all flesh end of all days
Love predicts disaster
In her precious ways
I was burned a sacerdotal soul
By the Demon Queen of my dreams
Infatuation turned to total control
Her rose was sweet
But her thorns were barbarous
Love me
And worship me
I'll lavish you and ravish you
Fulfill all wishes and fetishes too
Many never want to see
Many never want to know
The truth behind their fantasies
Their deepest needs
Let alone be shown them
Forgive me Father I have sinned
Darkness put her painted claws in me again
Her vision drowns like service wine
Whispered kisses so divine
I was blessed but now I've come undone
Nothing left to do but run
Sodom rolls out modern death
On casters ever faster
End of all Flesh End of all Days
The stars predict disaster
In her bastard ways
Love me
And worship me
I'll nurture you and hurt you too
Fulfill all wishes for my sad Aladdin
She comes to me
Like a sandstorm in an hourglass
A whirlwind of desire
I am hypnotized
To think beyond the pale
Beyond heartstopping eyes
And sopping thighs
I'm won't to fail
A wicked spell cast over me
Addicted to her utterly
Despite the horrors that gestate
Beneath the beautiful
I'll grant you life beyond your ken
The envy of all other men
Whatever vice will make you spend
Eternity with me
Satan's concubine
She makes her crime scenes shine from heaven
Forgive me Father I have sinned
Darkness put her painted claws in me again
Her vision drowns like service wine
Whispered kisses so divine
I was blessed but now I've come undone <start> Pendejos

Don't play by the rules

...or life it gives me the same
What do you give me now your life or your ass
Don't bring me white boys because I kill them
Men of the race be careful
Goat king takes care of pot
Black king takes care of business
Give us the ability to...
A soldier arrives half dead
The Americans fucked him over
Poor native without strength
They dragged him in the street
When a soldier falls
We seek revenge
Witchcraft is good for that
A curse of death
Those white boys won't get out alive
The product I sell
In Satan's store
He has made us rich in a short time
Carry on badly we kill your family
Nobody escapes this danger
That which Satan gives he can take from you

Sandman comes with sleeping dust
And I enter the world of dreams
A chilling place of eternal dusk
Where things are not what they seem
Pre Chorus
Into deeper sleep  I'm descending
Slowly falling  reality's bending
On gloomy shores under purple sky
Watching shadows that are passing by
Twisted forms beyond comprehension
Is this real  this strange dimension
Pre Chorus
Into deeper sleep  I'm descending
Falling faster  it's never ending
Chorus
Twilight dreams
Far beyond imagination
Nightly screams
Journey in twilight dreams

No longer falling  I am there

And I feel satisfied
As I move along my pride
I feel my bloodstream rise

Every kind of pride feels the best if you seize my demise

Ain't enough when I had some stuff
And still I'm doing fine

Active cultures of yogurt and yeast
Acidophilus interacts with tissue
Suffocated by the stench of sinew
Vomited dairy products
Peppers seasonings
Striated muscle flaps
No fruit on the bottom
Inhumane carnivorous jerky wraps
Agonizing odor of the industry
Ever consuming multiplying fungus
It's all around you
In the air you breathe
In the food you eat
In the bed you sleep
In the rotting meat
Ever looming presence of rot and disease
Unseen and disguised
Slowly chemically altered
Programmed and chastised
To believe that life is grand
As your arteries squeeze shut
You now realize
They're thinning out the numbers
This is the state of the union
This is the state of the mess
This is the truth behind happiness
And the ignorance of man
Destroy what we've been given
Dig our graves a little deeper
Fuck this world we live in
And fuck its ugly inhabitants
Long live the stench <start> music Dennis lyrics Nick Jake
Eternal vivid dreams of past now nightmares construct
A new empire of headless puppets industry of materialized madness
Horror in cyber panic and viruses flesh and steel now collided
Manmachine is tomorrows generation
Myths of past now stand alive
Mechanical slaves and lords darkness covers all like alons before
chorus
Abominations are dancing in a static rhythm
Their hypnotic eyes tell how life fades
Crawling in the ground theyre dying full of filth and innocence
The numbers are lost orders are confused disorder is defused
Frantic scientists enhance the human body
Interstellar communication brings colonists from far beyond
Alienation causes the crossiny of breeds
Mutants are born and rule the world
Capacity is exhausted and explosion is expected
Disintegration of my soul I liquify my flesh and bones
Colors tip my eyes blood dripping from my earsformless and faceless
I travel trough cables and cords loosing my share
I ejaculate in a sea of webs filled with eyes and senses
And I feel that time and space has no meaning here <start> How many lies can people take
How many emotions can people fake
All there is is time
Be what you are don't fucking care
I fail you you know I do
I'm just the fool always the fool
Be what you are don't fucking care
Be what you are I don't fucking care <start> The fallen leaps are withered
The cycle of the seasons takes it's turn
The north winds blowin' over the land
The heart of spring is waiting to return
And the glacial winds are breathing one more time
For the birds of passage now the hours chime
Chorus
The winter winds are leaving
Desolation seems to have a meanwhile end
By a long forgotten feeling I believe
In the dream of a summer's eve
The snowcapped mountains gleaming
Like the ocean in aurora fades away
The sunlight's streamin' over the land
To the rays of sunshine flowers like to sway
Birds of springtime catch a rainbow in the night
Hear 'em whisper from the trees that yearn for light
Chorus
The summer's eve is there
There's magic in the air
And the neverending story of the seasons will go on
In the tears of autumn rain
Leaves are falling in the lane
To announce the soon return
Of glacial winter winds <start> Nicht ein einziger Laut dringt ber deine Lippen
Kein Atemzug mehr hebt deine Brust
Das Leuchten der Augen verwssert im Zwielicht
Die Blsse der Haut berirdisch rein
Ich ksse dich ein weitres Mal
So weit entfernt vom Leben
so nahe an der Ewigkeit
Ich koste deinen kalten Leib
Der vergehen wird bis nichts mehr bleibt
Berhre deine Lippen mit den meinen
Diese Lippen die der Tod versiegelt hlt
Die niemals mehr meinen Namen nennen
In denen das Blut lngst fehlt
Du liegst vor mir auf einem Bett aus schwarzen Rosen
Die Wunden an dir sind lngst vernht
Nur noch Reste verunzieren den herrlichen Leib
Sie bleiben als Narben fr die Ewigkeit...
Drauen vor der Tr ist der Tag gewichen
Was strt es mich so lang ich bei dir bin
Ich hab dich zurckgeholt aus kalter Erde
Und bei mir wirst du sein bis dein Leib zerfllt
Und ich lege mich neben dich
Um deine Klte zu spren
Ganz nah bei dir und doch so weit entfernt
Ein zarter Hauch von Moder reizt meine Nase
Der Zerfall setzt ein bis nichts mehr von dir bleibt
Auer Asche die der Nachtwind mit sich trgt...
Und ich ksse dich ein weitres Mal
Bittres Leichenwasser netzt meine Haut
Und ich koste deinen faulenden Leib...
Nur die blassblauen Lippen
In den Ruinen deines Engelsgesichts
Diese Lippen die der Tod versiegelt hlt
Die niemals mehr meinen Namen nennen
In denen das Leben lngst fehlt...
Jetzt sind die Gifte lngst tief in mir
Dein gasender Leib er ttet auch mich
Ich bin so schwach kann mich kaum mehr rhren
Bald werden wir wieder zusammen sein...
Schenk mir den Tod ich hab ihn verdient... <start> Bitter blood on the bloodstained highway
We're brothers in arms 'til we get it right
You're gonna want it your way
It's gonna be done now
Don't take it too far gonna get it right
Move on from the past
Agree to disagree
Every sorrow has it's source
And your conscience isn't free
In the dog days of Summer
On another sober September
This was meant for you
Am I not my brother's keeper
All is what it seems to be
I'm A strong rival
A bitter enemy
Best friend
Till the end
The man you wish to be
They pray for villains
When their heroes let them down
They pray for villains
When their heroes let them down
Let them down
The ties that bind he clock that winds
As the oceans meet the sky
On the hour of my death
Will you be standing by
Every sorrow has it's source
And your conscience isn't free
In the dog days of Summer
On another sober September
This was meant for you
Am I not my brother's keeper
All is what it seems to be
I'm A strong rival
A bitter enemy
Best friend
Till the end
The man you wish to be
They pray for villains
When their heroes let them down
They pray for villains
When their heroes let them down
Let them down

und fleht' ums true vergebne Platzlein ich braucht um all mein lieblich
Augpupill fur ein paar Stunden zuzudecken dann von Baumeskron schon Zeit
Entfernt ich schlich in Grasse Fried und End um stets mud Fuss im
Schlummer gelber Blumlein zu versenken. Den Schlaf ich hab' ertraumt musst
enden noch vor Traumesbild und's Traumlein kam mit Hand und Ruf jen'

auf all Astres' End ob's Lerchlein mir begleit ein Traumgefuhl. Doch
schien's als ward in all der meinen Mude der Sanger Quidenus erwacht

Traum ich plant' zu haben hat er bestimmt gehabt. Ach Stimmlein ihr

Geisterwelt und Tranen suhnen Wachtraum's Schmerze. Doch Schmerz mit
halbverfrornem Herze ist lange noch kein kalter Kuss mit Lippen blau
wie Tumpeleis mit Augen klein wie Bratkartoffel kehrt ich dann Quidenus'
Haupt liess Ohren weiter wachen und starb mit leisen flauen Sangen.
Quidenus hockend nock im Moor schien Tage's Lichte zu ermuden mit
mannlich lautem Stimmelin ward er mit Schlafes Bettlein bald vereint.

Blaze
It ain't no place to be trust me
And why is that you ask
Ain't no lights at the end
There's only darkness on my path
Tortured souls fill the realm I call home
Without the Reaper's guidance
To lead them out the dead zone
It's plain and clear
Don't spend eternity here
With others like them
Who took their own life out of fear
Why couldn't they just see that everybody's got a time
Let the Reaper do his job man
He's doing just fine
Violent J 
Death don't want me life is all that I got
Keep me living even if I'm just a head in a box
Take me outdoors feed me
Put tits in my face
There's enough reason for me to live in any case
Send me to prison I'll start pimpin' faggots in there
Cripple my ass I'm floating spinners on my power chair
I'm Violent J I could never die anyway
Even when I'm gone all you gotta do is hit play
I'm Juggalotus

So bring the wicked shit we gonna bring it too
We like 'Hey'

Lotus Song <start> The foundation of our upbringing was her heart beating. Within vessels lies
the fluid. I know it tastes like mine does. Epidermal layer porcelain.
Paper thin but it holds her in the inside light. The length of her lungs
could be measured by a breath. By a breathless moan her whisper. Her marrow
matter means everything. We sipped her sweat through the floorboards every
drop. Down there. The warmest den. The pinkest lips on the hair thin slit of
a hollow shell that held it all. She's a miracle. <start> On wings of burning fire across the oceans far
The legends of the seven seas and mystic fallen star
Their laden ships are sailing on towards the sun
To the island of the everlasting chosen one
Face our fear along the way our freedom will prevail
The crown and the shining light
Punishment and anger in the fire of your soul
Prepare the eternal fight
Lost in a dream in a boundless sea
Rivers of pain are guiding me
Defending this land from the sins of man
Never surrender our dreams again
Ride forever onwards stare into the sun
Where hopes and dreams are everlasting marching on and on
Rise another day across the distant skies
Where the dawn above the winter moonlight shines upon the fall of our lives
Insanity sublime shall make my bleeding heart
Feel cold and fearless anger rising far beyond the dark
In search of might and wisdom sacrifice our souls
In the name of truth and justice never to be told
Face our fear along the way our freedom will prevail
The crown and the shining light
Punishment and anger in the fire of your soul
Prepare the eternal fight
Can you not feel the eternal pain
Flows through your heart and every vein
The torture begins and it breaks you down
Nothing to save when the soul is gone
Ride forever onwards stare into the sun... <start> A dream of a dwelling inside
Alone we come and alone we go
And who am I to know what I feel
Sympathy that's tearing me apart
Attraction of the distance to a heart or affinity
What if love will leave your heart an open sore
And I can't reveal what even I don't know
The love you feel you waste away on me
What kind of love would let us bleed away
No kind of love would make us bleed away
If only you could be
The one to take a look inside
I feel so incomplete
A broken man in need of mother love
I'm suffering in silence
And no one wants to see
And only god is watching as I bleed
The star above  my matching piece
Oh this will leave your heart an open sore
And I can't reveal what even I don't know
The love you feel you waste away on me
What kind of love would let us bleed away
No kind of love would make us bleed away <start> Her eyes see a splintered sky and the sun's forgotten them
Her face is a fresh wound honestly it's smashed
It's strange that she breathes my sweet little dead body
Oh no she's not dyin' she's not burned completely.
You hide between the walls your idiotic smile
And I could lie to you that there's something in you
You don't want to show your ashengray hands
I won't tell you this but to who will you give them
And she never laughs my burned little cat
And she never cries she's lost her tears
This overdose of pain is impossible to get
I see the traces of the flames on her thin back
I don't wanna look at your hands
I feel awful when you splutter I am yours
I feel fear when I gotta cuddle you
Even though I know you are mine mine <start> I can't feel and I can't see
I'm falling down what's going on with me
Lord in heaven why am I here
Do I live to rise or rise to fall to shed another tear
One more time I fell that I'm alone
I can't describe it cause it's better to be shown
Feel the darkness covering the spite
Hear me screaming when it's pounding deep inside
Forever I'll be a poisoned thorn
I'll be haunting among your lives
The moment I was born it was time for him to rise
Chorus
Deadmaker deadmaker
Why don't you realize
That he can paralyze you all
My sorrow created by you
And even me cause I'm a selfdestroying fool
I feel the spirit growing deep inside
I don't expect your comprehension
'Cause even I don't know why <start> Grita ms alto

At night a star did shine upon
What once was build on my ancestors' land
When once I was young
Willing to learn
From the old and the wise

Evening fell unto this land

I embrace you I embrace you

I embrace you I embrace you
do you feel the feline eyes
and I watched you in your sleep
this piece of heaven by my side
I wished it could forever be
spend my life by your side
the ecstasy I feel
when I look into your eyes
you could make life worth living
so I say
you wake up in the morning
and I smile for you
believe me I would forever do
I embrace you I embrace you
let me watch your feline dance
I embrace you I embrace you
do you feel the feline eyes
and the world is cold
but I think I'll get through
I wished it could have been
my weakness you
the melancholy I feel
when I fall into your eyes
you could make death worth trying
still I'd swear
you wake up in the morning
and I smile for you
believe me I would forever do
again I'm alone left in despair
just drive out of here and then stop anywhere
please do not let fall all to pieces
just throw your present life away
again I'm hurt
we have to go it is getting late
tears of joy would be something new
a kiss and a smile tears for you

I'd stay with you until the end <start> Singer oohhhh

Will I live or will I die Will I ever see the light
The world is changin' ooohhhhh <start> Crawled across this glass slept on these nails
Dissapointment never fails
These blood shot eyes focus on your flaws
Now reach for the shortest straw
Wide awake these nights nightmares at ease
Now I become an anomaly
Shortness of breath program destruct
Cotton candy framed a paper cut
Take one last breath fill up your lungs
Pay it back take it backback where it belongs
Take one last breath fill up your lungs
Pay it back take it backback where it came from
I swear on my mother's eyes
I had nothing to do with your demise
I'm lost without you
So let's propose a toast to the famine ghost
Open empty mouthsall tied in knots
Memories I thought that I forgot
These stomach pains strain of disease
Can't hear my prayers ignore my pleas
A mothers child a soldier's guilt
Smell the flowers before they wilt
Send a funeral wreath a folded flag
A yellow ribbon wrapped around a body bag
Take one last breath fill up your lungs
Pay it back take it backback where it belongs
Take one last breath fill up your lungs
Pay it back take it backback where it came from
I swear on my mother's eyes
I had nothing to do with your demise
I'm lost without you
So let's propose a toast to the famine ghost
Back and fourth from work  hours till home
Everyday the same this haggard life is my own
Hungry mouths need value meals
Super size my future and these  wheels
I'm as blue as my collar and this bruise of mine
Hammered down teamster bought box of pine
I swear on my mother's eyes
I had nothing to do with your demise
I'm lost without you
So let's propose a toast to the famine ghost
Pay it back take it backback where it belongs
Pay it back take it backback where it came from <start> Distance in the size of meters
Yet I seem lightyears away
Unreachable
Showing you affection
Is another wasted part of me
Yet still I reject this
Still I try to let go
And if me is not enough
What else is there to give <start> As we journey over to the summit
We hear the echoes of dispossession
Who is to worry about our affliction
When my body departs from the shame
The wickedness my sinfullness
You may swell to the elysian fields
But the befall of Marduk will trace the literal thruth
The Utuk xul Wine's Holy Fool
Whereby to capture and atone the clouded soul
The weeping apparition looks for duration
Conjectures of being vulgar then godless ways
Euphony sounds the sanctum bell
I will structure the ordained spell
Guide the mistress versus the throne
Here's the first seed of the inquisition
Black lake current sailed past the rushes
Dismal heights will melt the scarlet snow
I'll give my sorrow to the lady in white
'O' pale flower you'll feel the vein in depth.'
The wanderers of the eroded
The gates of Ganzir
The Magnum Opus
The Xenolith
Monuments of a vanquished civilization
A cenotaph of theomorphic conjurations
Sempiternity of the ones of our underworld
Archetypal images awaits the declivity
Infinite and profane thrones
Absymal sighs of the damned
Feel the intention by depressing your own god. <start> Forgetting promise made in the campaigns
Voting down the line repeating all the talking points
No desire to advance anything but stature
Keeping up the facade reaping all the benefits
Decadence accepting bribes to east to bank on the fraudulent
Painless inequity swapping favors to increase your posture
Forgetting constitutes only polls will make you pause stockpiling
Latch on faceless causepartisan progress lets you proceed
It's not the what it started but the reward came effortless
Not considered corrupt just shadily comfortable
Inflating your relevance citing others deeds as your own
In the pursuit of acclaim swaying your disciples to give
In the wake of allegations stay behind the party line
Take admissions to the grave distract with current
debates
Shape and distort the gaze of the public eye implicate a counterpart
Degenerative efforts from confusion a simple game innate to DNA
The celestial altar of fortune
persuading men to maliciously guard
Exchanging ideas assets or support
protecting the culture of greed
Solidifying your place in the institute
circling weapons always on call
Rubbing resentments fanning hostilities
making sure that you are required
Relaxed immorality takes getting used to
Transformation easy tasting the prize
Merit of compensation roughly void
Perverse means to warrant return
Crooked malevolence can inspire some to rise
Above the law untouchable prominence
Portraying the figure the followers adore
Preying on the people you preach to help
Lobbying for earmarks sanctioned for them
Starling revelation entitlement is yours
Dishonesty the tool to keep your pockets full
Affecting everyone whether or not they backed you
Fuck them anyway because they'll contribute too <start> Album The Score

 <start> There was once a city that one called the future here on earth
The elite human beings assembled and played god in their town
Weaknesses and virtues got connected for their stupid aim
Only their holy victory and the elite was on their glorious minds
In this world of technology machines dictate the flow of time
There is no personality human values waiting in line
There is no communication 'cause there's a gap between them all
Lost in a state of destruction no matter where they go
THERE IS MADTROPOLIS
THEY'RE ALL GOING INSANE
TO LIVE IN THIS BLOODY HELL
THAT'S NOT THEIR GLORIOUS AIM
THERE IS MADTROPOLIS
THE EVIL GHOST IS ON THE TOP
THE FIRE OF ILLUMINATION
FALLING FROM THE BURNING SKY
Staring like headless zombies without any emotion for their lives
They are all recruited unable to think in different lines
So their leaders have failed but they are blind and they will follow them
To spill their blood and their sick thoughts over the whole world <start> music Nick Costas lyrics Nick
Pressing my hands against my head
Trying to hear my heartbeats
I know that I dont know
Only tomorrow knows
Life is a raging sea no scedule no turning back
Im thinking what the others do
If they exist at nights
When Im lying in bed
Life is shifting like the cloud
Mixed colors clear my mind one year later Im back
Seeing eyes I havent seen before
Space is getting shorter for me and them
Fate is working for what is written <start> This is the Lotus
The Underground
Where all darkness meets
For the judgement of their afterlife
Six petals One pod
And an Army full of Juggalos
Emerging from the center of the earth
Willing and able to take control
Of all unfinished situations
By leading the outcasted souls
To the power of ShangriLa
Shaggy  Dope
Venomous snakes magically charmed
All of disappear with the wave of a wand
Pharaohs eternally rest in they tomb
Hachets unleashed allow doom to consume
Nomads wander were do they go
Scholars go insane at the minds of Juggalos
Sand grains burn when the sun beats down
Skin rots more as the earth spins around
Anybody Killa
I got a handfull of dust
From the leaf of the Lotus
Hold it in the sky
Blow it in the air to get my focus
Cut off my fingertip
I wanna see the blood drip
Onto the tail of a possum
Close my eyes make a wish
On my knees praying to my Ali Baba
Can you hear me every time I scream an Holla
I'm just a killer with problems
I want a fucking release
Without the help of a therapist
My family or a preist

Floating on a magic carpet with a fat sword
It's Joe Bruce of the Lotus ward 
You can try and rub my lamp
I might float out and spike your ass like vamp
I bow to the pyramid I do confide
The secrets of the carnival are deep inside
Disrespect it foolish hocus pokus
I'll spilt your forehead and plant my Lotus
You don't know what this killa's all about
I might sever your head off and fuck your mouth
Bells and chimes ring  times
Faceless souls act out like mimes
Pegasus cry as gargoyles take eyeballs from heads like skinless grapes
Even kings will fall to their knees
And end up only knowing one word

Come with me to the legendary land of Ali Baba
A place of genies and flying covers
Would you wish for rub a lamp
Take a chance
In the land were the genies and the gypsies dance

And I can see them all dieing cause the vision are viscous

It's a waste of my time hangin' here
It's too late to change me

I don't need you no more
Bad feeling gone
You can't hurt me no more

Life's too short to worry about your say
I'm at the end of my rope when I'm with you

And you grin like a puma
I watch as you spend an hour or two
In the bath like a tuna
One times I love you
Two times I love you
Three times four times five times
I love you you you ooh
Twice a week I take a peek
As you bathe like a reptile
I catch your eye and you throw your sponge
It's a soaking projectile
One times I love you
Two times I love you
Three times four times five times
I love you love you love you ooh <start> It's been few days since you left and said goodbye.
It's the love you gave.
It's got me craving inside
Oh how I miss you baby.
Looking at the pictures in my hand
And wondering if I see you ever again
I'm crying oh
Can't you see my heart is breaking
I'm crying oh
Want to get my strength from up above
I'm crying oh
My love she isn't taking
I'm crying oh
Over you
It's been few nights that I spend my time at home
But some how I know
I'm not on this alone
Oh how I miss you baby.
Looking at the pictures in my hand
Wondering if I see you ever again
I'm crying oh
Can't you see my heart is breaking
I'm crying oh
Want to get my strength from up above
I'm crying oh
And my love she isn't taking
I'm crying oh
Over you
Why don't you listen to me one's
There ain't no problem that we can't solve
This is only for a season
We got to fight
We got to fight for our love
I'm crying oh
Can't you see my heart is breaking
I'm crying oh
Want to get my strength from up above
I'm crying oh
My love she isn't taking
I'm crying over you. <start> Let the language be the blade
Dead it stares into our empty lives
Created needs as tumors they grow
The swarming worms of a thousand lies
The conspiracy of the blind
Staring dead into our lives of decay
Hermetic halls echo silent now
Flood the landscape of our minds
The conspiracy of the blind
Staring dead into our lives of decay
From the lips of the blind man
A kiss of decay
The dawn of the iconoclast
A sharpened blade
The conspiracy of the blind
Staring dead into our lives of decay <start> ...and so it came to pass...
there arose from the myst
of chaos
a great black warhorse
none of which like the world has
ever seen before
or will ever see again.
A mighty beast whose
thundering hooves
shooked th very foundation
of the earth.
Striking fear into the hearts of
even the bravest soul
and the only thing more powerful
more terrifying
the Man who rode it.
There he wasclad in an armour
black as the night
his expression grim as his sword
was heavy
eyes are old as time itselfeyes tha
have seen the dawn of this world
and he is now arrived to see
its end
dealing death and destruction to
all that stands in his way
the warrior of the wastelands.
All bow to the Dark Emperor <start> The day is mine. The night is also mine.
Thou has set all the borders of this earth
But I've never been one to believe
In the preconceived limit that's set for me.
I spit in the face of the haters
As I march closer to victory.
And my time is here.
And my time is now.
That's gods honest
Combine this with the knowledge that I've aquired.
Learning from my mistakes I'm baptized by fire.
I've had the ground fall from beneath my toes
Scraped my knees from the concrete.
Then still I rose.
And my time is here.
And my time is now. <start> One day I saw a man
Dressed in rags with a staff in his hand
Begging for a penny to survive
How poor a man can be
I gave him hospitality
A room a bed and lots of food to eat
Still I hear his last few words
I can never return what you've done
Heaven will remember and repay
Fifty years had gone since I saw him
I was dying and I'd soon be dead
Three angels stood in front of me bed
The first one she said to me don't be afraid
I will give you immortality and grace for your soul
The second had eyes of gold she gave me my wings
The third gave all wisdom and angel could give
... to me
Repeat st Verse
Repeat nd Verse
I joined with my destiny eternally
I knew I was born again an angel to be
A vision beyond my dreams called me by name
So in devotion I spread my wings to heaven I had came
... to stay <start>  step at the time
Small progress seems futile
But is as valuable as life
I'm engaged to longing
With sorrow as the ring
Controlling me denying me
My every morning is in every way
The beginning of a recreation day
Time heals but still the mourning reigns
I still breath when the loss reminds me again
I am here
Life is fear and sorrow's all I know
Am I in dept cause so it seems
But what I owe
I don't know
Devoured by guilt and cursed beyond control
My every morning is in every way
The beginning of a recreation day <start> Thirty third degree on the corner of Quit Street and Temptation Avenue
On the road to redemption outside of heave
Pride can be dangerous and you knew
Method of execution length of duration
At what cost
Forgiveness is a six gun teach me how to shoot
The truth is like a moving target forgiveness is a six gun
The streets from the start have been filled with doubt
And they are set free you needed someone to carry you
Fighting and counting the days the error of your ways
Methods of execution length of duration at what cost
Forgiveness is a six gun teach me how to shoot
The truth is like a moving target forgiveness is a six gun
In cold blood dressed in black
Tombstones and tumbleweeds
Left the dead behind watched em falling
Let Smith and Wesson do the motherfucking talking
Dust in my eyes dust in the street shotguns and broken dreams
Now we left the dead behind watched em falling
Let the Smith and Wesson do the motherfucking talking
Now
Forgiveness is a six gun teach me how to shoot
The truth is like a moving target forgiveness is a six gun
There is no forgiveness
There is no forgiveness
There is no forgiveness
There is no forgiveness <start> She wanted him to know that she believed in him
And her friends all disagreed with the choice she made
She decided to risk it all on a hunch she believed in
They tried to stand in her way in her way
We won't give them an opportunity to divide and conquer us
Let's show the strength and passion
that connects that connects them to us
These two star crossed souls are in the same state of mind
They'd rather follow their heart than other peoples' lies
If you separated them they'd never be satisfied
Death is eminent but such a sweet lullaby
We won't give them an opportunity to divide and conquer us
Let's show the strength and passion
that connects that connects them to us
If we stand together they won't stand a chance
If we stand together they won't stand a chance
If we stand together they won't stand a chance
If we stand together they won't stand a chance
She won't stop and he won't let go
They wanna elope and then grow old
They tried they gotta fight back or die
Sweet lullaby
We won't give them an opportunity to divide and conquer us
Let's show the strength and passion
that connects that connects them to us
We won't give them an opportunity to divide and conquer us
Let's show the strength and passion
that connects that connects them to us
We will fight back or die
We will fight back or die <start> The rebirth of intelligent life will restore this planet's cosmic status.
As the surface draws into focus every variance and nuance realized.
The simple birth.
Time is moving forward.
Elapse. Evolve. Expand. Adapt.
Adaptation runs parallel with surviving global conflict.
Sustained permanence proves imperfect existence integrated.
Balance is reached between the parent star.
Endless motion.
Now the experience is long gone.
We won't forget it's entrancing stare as long as we recall it's grip.
Stellar forces are keeping us alive. <start> Screaming chasm into these emptied voids
Senses aroused by the undoing of creation
Weapons of these vengeful arrangements
To coincide with this mass fall of imperium
Immense columns holding up the heavens
Collapsing from the might of the choirs below
Burrowing hallucination from the infested carrion
In this apocalypse for the millennium of the sun
Visualize the final stance of promise as blood pours out of the stars
A decay that serves as the portal into the gates of the great ancients
Tides of this distinct neglect awaken those who left behind the pride of liberation
Eating their own pulsing hearts in punishment <start> Working hard all day
To control the final dream
Side by side we walk
Towards a blinding arctic storm
I head your voice on the line
Struggling to find the words
So let me tell you something
I knew right from the beginning
There won't be a next time
No more lies
A new day's dawning
You turn and walk away
The night is falling
You turn and walk away
But when the spotlight hits the stage
The time has come to say
Here I am
Here I am
Working hard all night
As the world's forever turning
Between two fires sleeping
On the outside looking in
I hear your voice on the line
Struggling to find the words
Now let me tell you something
We agreed on from the beginning <start> In Dreams and Visions I Saw the Beast Rise again
In Chasms and Voids of Doom the Circle of Pandemonium
I Stole the Sacred Nimbus of the Kingly Dead
Glittering Treasures will Haunt Me Forever Now
The Thirteen Words of Spell I Breathe
Witchcraft and Sorcery
I've Forseen all the Fallen Stars
Wizardry and Destiny
Sleeping in the Eyes of Earth
Sending Dwarfs Back to Birth
Sleeping Entities of Stone
Down the Dragoncaves I'll Roam
Demonized  Exorcized  Decapitated  Resurrected
Voice
In Past Ages of War and Conquer
Battling for My Immortal Desire
By the Stab from a Sword of Steel
I was Shaped to a Spirit of Zaal
Hail  The Ravenlord
Hail  The Only One <start> Do not use the past as an alibi
For all of your deficiencies always standing by
Face your negligence do not fool yourself
Shortcomings will soon appear
For weakness shows itself
Blind from your success and all of the excess
Deaf from the praise you had
Don't cry out of self pity in forcing your way through
For I will not be vulnerable to slander made by you
In a misty veil misplaced
Where castles in the air will be no longer seen
As something out of reach
In time the dream will be erased
So many things will never be the way they seemed
And pride will have it's fall at last
Her eyes fell while the shame was written on her face
When she realised that her failures
could never be undone again
You did not notice the manipulated hand
That overshadowed your thoughts all those years
That made you insecure
You did not notice the ancient shifting sand
That pulls you down into an everlasting sham
You will never be able to fight
Never be able to hide
Run for a fall you'd better run <start> The sky is falling around me. You choke in the saturated bliss. A sky so much bluer than mine. Strangulation of your warm soul. Your flesh weakens me. Joyless under the falling sky your sky seems so much bluer. Buried in displeasure. I sink up through the sky rising into the grave in my mind. Fly your dove kill your love. Bleed for me. A tear shed without sincerity. Open your heart and bleed for me I will never set your soul free. A fossil of you tempter only flesh of what was. Ashes of your fallen dreams. I look into your eyes and I can't recognize you but your sky is so much bluer than mine. <start> Higher higher the dragon soars
People fear his majestic roars
Louder louder the storm brews
Killing the ship's almighty crew
No no more despair
Slay the monster if you dare
No no more despair
Call on the attacker
Call on the attacker
In the wind the children cry
All their loves had to die
Dark and wild waves the sea
No weapons left for me
In the wind the children cry
All their loves had to die
Attacker fights for your glory
Blood and guts all so gory
What now <start> Threatened by the storm
Trying to take what's mine
Trying to drag me down
You won't succeed
With Christ on my side
I will overcome
I will identify in the Lord forever true
I will not walk away
I will not back away
Time and again
I will struggle in my life
You'll be by my side
Throughout the thick and thin
No weapon formed against
us will prosper
You can't take me out
You can try but you will see
I'll break through this wall
That tries to stop me <start> I want to be
Somewhere far from here
I'm watching you
As you wave goodbye
I won't take
I won't weigh you down
Following suit
So just count me out
I can't get it out
Can't put it together
I should have known better
Than to turn into this
I can't believe
I've become removed
Tighten the line
And pull up hello
I will change
I won't weigh me down
Carving this space
Never count me out
I can't get it out
Can't put it together
I should have known better
Than to turn into this
Fiend
I say
Everything's how it ought to be
I say
Nothing should ever change
I say
I only know how I used to be
I say
I don't want a fucking thing to do with it
Fiend <start> Walk the way of the hunter
Not the fucking victim
Take your own decisions
Follow your path

Broken sticks and broken strings every night.

Chorus <start> Cut dissected from within
Like clockwork run the cells
An unearthly silent din
A constant toll of bells
Mocking laughter evermore
No sight of a refrain
Waiting on my lonely quest
Asylum of the brain
Brain
The darkest caverns of my mind
Hold terrors so consuming
Look within and soon you'll find
Your psyche I'm subsuming
More than flesh and blood can bear
Ensnared within my brain
Eyes in fear eyes in terror
Adversity is pain
Adversity is pain
Pain...
Within the faculty of fools
Leering warders intimidation
Playing games at all my rules
Is feeding their frustration
The blood inside my temples pulsing
While I'm locked away
Thoughts within my head convulsing
For the time my captors pay
Stop the torment cut me loose
Unbind me from my chains
Before my eyes a veil of mist
Encompassing and grey
Once again
Momentarily free of pain
Pain...
Pain...
Pain...
Stop the pain and rip me open
Tear out my tormentors
Release me from agony
Blinding my nerve centres
Only known emotions
Are the anger and the sadness
Overshadowed totally by
Unrevokable madness
Held inside this sterile box
My thoughts turn now to charnel
Fantasise yet I remain
Still locked inside eternal
I'll not escape but I will wait
Patience will run true
Visitation you will see
This madness is in you <start> Music  Chastisement Lyrics  Johan
Repulsive colors infest my brain  this will surly drive me insane  in a
world so cruel and dark i really need a change of heart  injection of
dreams  forgetting to feel  if only for a second  it makes me cope and
recon  a rush so wild and free turned out to be a quest for me  in the
passage of life i found my self hide  light or dark devine or dreadful 
which way to go i really don't know  i chose the light it blinded me  but
i was fooled by the man in disguise  he rolled me like a sixsided dice
into a place best described as inner fights <start> Thorned pics of you deep in my mind
It tastes like the end when we get loose
Illusion of life just left behind
The hardest pain we cannot smooth
Abandonned land we were reigning on
A rain of tears dust on the throne
You tell me to love is to leave
Be all that you can be without me
A cathedral without a god
The emptiness instead of you
A suicide note without a world
Your hand in his I'm an orphan of you
You're the one I've been waiting for
I'm the one you're calling number four
Now that I'm just a fuckin' number
A name on a list you should better burn
You made me believe in you in love
Then betrayed me o lord of deception
You took everything you had to take
Everything inside me needs to rest
A cathedral without a god
The emptiness instead of you
A suicide note without a word
Your hand in his I'm an orphan of you
Thorned pics of you deep in my mind
It tastes like the end when we get loose
Illusion of life just left behind
The hardest pain we cannot smooth
Abandonned land we were reigning on
A rain of tears dust on the throne
You tell me to love is to leave
Be all that you can be without me
A cathedral without a god
The emptiness instead of you
A suicide note without a word
Your hand in his I'm an orphan of you <start> 
All I see floats with the wind
All the miracles of the water
Are the miracles never seen
Somehow my life now begins
This music that's been played through time
Now starts to reach my feet
Feels like the flood of my needs
>From the harmony of forever
Sound the melodies of the sea
And you will know on the way
I'm coming back to my enemies
I'm turning around I'll be
Just coming back to my last days
I'm coming back to the sea
So... why won't you come with me my friend
Thrills... like we had before
Hope... never showing up the same
For a lonely man
Since the day we left the land
We've been anxious on aproach
Captain kept showing his plans
Under sail we go
Deep the ocean's blue I stare
The reflections of my soul
We have with us a special guest
And for him we made a toast
Carolina IV took a river to the sky
Seven men on board taking part
To take their hearts around
All around around the world
All I can recall that day
On that very day for sure
All hands up against the haze
As we attempted the return
Carolina IV took the river to the sky
One man less on board  human dreams
Have sometimes cost their lives
All their lives dreaming
I've been such a fool I've been so afraid
>From my heart to you I say I'll be here to stay
Nothing much left from the boat
Many years have been and gone
Still I can't forget the past
And the ones I left at home
Carolina IV took the river to the sky
Windy whistling nights
Made me sail right into the wind's eye
Now I'll die singing <start> Back to the grind end of the line
Back to the life I knew
Pain deep inside swallow my pride
Still I think I'm losing you
Nearing the end more than a friend
What the hell can I say
Years left behind trapped in my mind
Wishing for another day
Fool proof no bail locked inside

Tight restraints my hands they're tied

Slave to the cause breaking the laws
No more common decency
Must be a sign you're doing fine
So much better without me
Learn from the past always the last
Wonder when will my day come
I'll never quit won't submit
Hoping that you'll be the one
You may try to break us down
Can't you see we're here to stay
Scores of them have tried before
At our feet is where they lay
It's our calling scream rage mauling
Can't you see we're breaking out
Overloaded so explosive
Cathartic vengeful shout
Dreaming of flight all through the night
What the hell does it mean
Float in a flood thrive in the mud
Black sheep anomaly
Rise to the task breaking the fast
Feeling for the first time whole
Charging the fight light up the night
Forever I will live my goal <start> So god I've been trying to match
It doesn't work
I'm trying
I don't know
the aberration of this world
I try to deal with
I've killed a part of me that was aching
The pain is gone
But denail runaway from institutions
I owe my self life
There's no way I will respond expression anger flowing through me
There is light in this world I fight fuck
The reason you won't leave this cage
Betrayed your child with desire
But you wont attempt to reveal yourself
Forgot to create your own life
Anger
Lies
Denial
This precious anger
What lays inside of us won't last forever
Don't fear to let it out

Maybe I can't give you all

I can't buy a ticket for my last trip
Decline of my glamour will sure
let me down
I'm always happy when I see
you frown
And I have told you
We'll be smiling as stars
And I'll you anew
I would never say that you don't
need me
Sunrise came to stay for
me and you
You could find the way to see
my shining
I would never play 'cos this is true
All gales and storms they seem
to be gone
Somebody said that escape
is to run
And when you sleep you look
so serene
I know that we live
for you and for me
And I have told you
We'll be smiling as stars
And I'll you anew
I would never say that you don't
need me
Sunrise came ot stay for
me and you
You could find the way to see
my shining
I would never play
'cos this is true... <start> And when your golden curls have turned to red
when your eyes have lost all their light find strength in my life.
Enough white to kindle a massacre of poems.
At least tremble enough that I may flame in your green array

Perhaps then those beautiful tears will overcome...
I almost wrecked this morning in about the same place my mother called me
the day she found out
I hydroplaned going about  miles per hour.
I wasn't scared or anything it was very strange.
I had a moment in time and space
all to myself to think.
To die then would mean to be with my sister but if I had then I would have
missed out on this dream I've had for so long.
It just goes to show what a girl like Erin with an enormous heart and a
talent to make the world smile could have done if she was still alive.
It sounds strange but Erin couldn't have lived out her dreams on Earth so
now I must make it a point
so now it's my job to live them out for her and let the world know what a
wonderful person it will never get to meet. <start> This city drinks and roars
Each word so meaningless
Each word especially yours echoes inside my head
Why can't you see
I won't let you get your way
Let you get the best of me
I just need to know
Are you done with me
So are you done with me
And if you won't you just let me be
I try to understand your reasons for leaving
I cannot believe it
This city drinks and screams
this night will never end
This city made of dreams
My dreams have turned to sand
Why can't you see
I won't let you get your way
Let you get the best of me
I just need to know
Are you done with me
So are you done with me
And if you won't you just let me be
I try to understand your reasons for leaving
I cannot believe it
So are you done with me
Now you wanna sleep
Did you realize that I can't be all you need
Are you done with me
Now you wanna sleep
If love is gone then I am done again.
So are you done with me
And if you won't you just let me be
I try to understand your reasons for leaving
I cannot believe it
So are you done with me
And if you won't you just let me be
I try to understand your reasons for leaving
I cannot believe it
This city drinks and roars <start> When we play our charade
We were like children posing
Playing at games acting at names
Guessing the parts we play
Oh what a hit we made
We came on next to closing
Best on the bill lovers until
Love left the masquerade
Sad little serenade
Song of my heart's composing
I hear it still I always will
Best on the bill charade <start> The people who survive the sword will find favor in the desert
I will build you up again you will be rebuilt
I am the painter making this mess a masterpiece
I will rebuild you up again <start> When the cerulean sky
Is painted over with crimson
And the sun descends into the horizon
When the moon sings oneiric serenades
And we are coaxed into lethargy
Its seductive power enchants us
And opens the gates...
To the Citadel of Dreams
The bastion of illusion
Engraved with the elaborate
Archetypes of wisdom
Primordial designs embedded within
That inspire mythos
Bathed amongst pillars of light
Its ivory towers shine like bright stars
Submerged in subconscious
Within sapphire halls of deep blue
We drift and float as we slumber
Carried by the tides of languor
One by one we extend our minds
To receive precious fantasies
Infused by the lyre of the muse
With the enchantment of obscurity
Like delicate snowflakes
Melting upon flesh
These fragile memories
Are dissolved by consciousness

The imprints of another world
Reached only through the psyche...

Horas sin sueos noches en vela
Yo pagara cualquier cosa amor si tu volvieras
Larga esta vida larga la espera
Estoy sufriendo esta soledad tu ausencia quema
Esta ansiedad de quererte
Y no poder besarte me va a matar
Si no vuelves pronto a consolarme
Y ya devulveme tu amor
Devulveme el amor que un da yo te di
Devulveme las ganas de sentir y de vivir
Devulveme el amor los versos que escrib
Devulveme el color azul del cielo que te di
El da que te vi partir...
Me encantara verte de nuevo
No cometer ms errores comenzar de cero
Si yo pudiera hablar contigo
Mostrarle al mundo que soy capaz de ser tu amiga
Esta ansiedad de quererte
Y no poder besarte me va a matar
Si no vuelves pronto a consolarme
Ya devulveme tu amor
Devulveme el amor que un da yo te di
Devulveme las ganas de sentir y de vivir
Devulveme el amor los versos que escrib
Devulveme el color azul del cielo que te di
Baby devulveme el amor que de mi te llevaste
Mi cielo esta muy gris desde que tu te marchaste
Si tu no estas conmigo no consigo un buen motivo
Para estar vivo ni para echar para adelante
Y es que tu no sabes lo que siento me mata le sufrimiento
Me ahoga sin tormento tu ausencia
Vuelve ya que yo aqu estoy consciente
Te doy mis sentimientos
Te juro que te espero con paciencia
Esta ansiedad de tenerte
Y no poder besarte me va a matar
Si no vuelves pronto a consolarme
Ya devulveme tu amor
Devulveme el amor que un da yo te di
Devulveme las ganas de sentir y de vivir
Devulveme el amor los versos que escrib

The word this world from the prams
Inevitable
I love to dance
And it's Saturday again very logical
You can just then pretend to be many
Say goodbye to your den in sound
It's so happy on Saturday
Bounce around on Saturday
The peculiar call in the query of
In Burmese right on the calling
The calling
You have a right to say it
From the law of the planes and the prams
Inevitable
Inedible
Just pretend to be many
Pretend to be many
The radio jam said it
You have a right to say it
It's beyond capable
In Burmese
Right on the calling
The calling
Happy times on a Saturday
The airwaves
Not since the Spring
Inevitable
Inevitable
Bye bye bye baby
Today
The calling <start> blood burns clean. i can piss gasoline. what you're willing to waste i can smell almost taste. see these lights in my eyes. they record a life of crime. fingers all wrapped around. tongues pulled back like loaded guns. we'll do it again one last time. blood burns clean wash away gasoline. what you're willing to waste i can smell. almost taste.. see these lights in my e yes they record a life of crime. we'll do it again one last time. we'll do it again till they pull this gun from my cold dead hand. living your life like you're waiting to die eyes on the clock like you're hoping you live through this. this is where we got off quiet calm hanging from dull needles in the air. dirty rubber souls tracked behind us the faint trace of suspicion on the terminal floor. if we had been able to we would have seen our reflections in passing store front windows only the late afternoon light refused to let us in and we moved like ghosts up escalators and down crowded concrete corridors. every movement was carefully detected and words painstakingly decoded and still we fell out from the camera's eye erased from the taped evidence we were the light footsteps of a practiced and polished abomination. we passed unquestioned into their vaults where they gave us anything we wanted without a word. this whole world laid open wide. say my name like it's all you've got s ay my name while you bleed into me. tonight the world is ours. <start> Sedated and lazy cold skies full of blue
The sun burns forever it reminds me of you
On your dead shore the sand is warm
She hides her tears and quickly lets it die
I will make it thru even without you
My sky will be blue
I live tranquilized
Slow motion liquid universe I'm feeling nowhere
It don't matter where we're goin' cause I already been
There on your dead shore the sand is warm
She hides her tears and quickly lets it die
Their dying of rabies eating their babies
In fields of dead daisies
I live tranquilized
I'm numb and unfeeling so I just burn and stare at the ceiling
I'm here but so far away I see your mouth movin' but can't hear what you
say
And I don't think I'd give a fuck anyway <start> Darkness stretch these realms that taint me
On these sheets forever curled
She who drew the light from shadows
Never shall again be held...
Spectre of the idle hours
Rest upon this dying sun
We who touched the souls of all
In mortal life shall not be one
Life bereft of sight or reason
Save your gentle afterglow
I beneath a placid dreaming
Cower when the soft winds blow
Cower for its all I know
Mourning shall I slumber always
Rise to wish of dreams that mend
The agony of your departure
Will this sadness never end
Evergreen immortal pasture
Whence you rest a dream below
Do you live in timeless love
Or shall your pain I never know
One day shall we grace these skies
Entwined again forever held
Together in the amber twilight
One within another world <start> And she leaves you sees you weeping as you
thought you saw the storm callous colours of drawings
without seeing in the negativity a lie and the all
deluded moonlight prescribed screaming abyss that
mocks you until you don't know while catagons
breed serpents and the sigils weep into snakes and
the tyrant lost of the suns gaze seems to kneel
in a sand that they took away only seeing what you
are not too afraid to because it's all a nothing a
dreamscape void with wings and flight and he's following
they're mocking he's following run and screaming through
as the temperament of linear dredging spirits itself to the
flat our face of actually haunting a dimension and we
won't die pain she said and we won't die cruel she said
and we won't die
and forever. <start> His kingdom  Kingdom of Darkness
Where you can hear agony screams
Cry eternal
Frozen moon growing shadows
Glowing eyes are waiting
 creator of darkness will rise
And the sun will shine no longer
Cry eternal
Condemned to walk away in the night
In the land where cold winds blow
Where silence reigns
From horizon to horizon
The wind leads your way
Darkness fills your soul
You'll be eternal in his kingdom
Kingdom of Darkness
Embalmed in black
Receive thy might
Our sense of live to harm world
Under the shining moon
We follow your command
Entering your unholy path
Kingdom of Darkness <start> That which sleep
Is a part of the soul
That which watch
Is a part of the watching
Of perception
I am wandering
To the inner space
Of soul
Unverified
I know what I am looking for
And I am looking for things I already know
Contradiction and duality
Contradiction and unity
Of different levels
Of perception
I am wandering
To the inner space of soul
I am looking for the truth
'Cause this is my path
'Cause this is my destination
Love under will
The key of develop
From rationality to purification
And at the end
The shapeless flame
Whirling voice
The child wilding the bow of light
Standing on horseback painted in gold
Symbols united as the lion
Of knowledge and truth <start> Know I can see through your costom
that's conceiling all your lies our disguise
meant the pureify your deflecation.
YOU don't look at me
YOU. won't look at me
You know that your time's forthcoming
YOU won't look at me
YOU don't look away
When you blink your eyes I will appear
Fist to the face tell me how does your blood taste
Fist to the face tell me how do you like this
Fist to the face tell me how does your blood taste
Fist to the fist to the fist to the face.
I won't describe all the pain that I will bring upon you.
Look in my eyes or did your shame destroy all your vision
YOU can'trun away
YOU won't run away
You can't run away you coward.
YOU won't run away
YOU will face up
You will face up when you're in the ground
Fist to the face tell me how does your blood taste
Fist to the face tell me how do you like this
Fist to the face tell me how does your blood taste
Fist to the fist to the fist to the face.
Maybe I seem shrewd I know we can't save the world
I will do my part. So let's get started.
Say what you meen. Meen what you say.
Throw your fist in the air. It's just begining.
Swing the broken fist of God.
Faith is shattered.
Swing the broken fist of God
Faith is shattered.
Can't run away <start> What kind of world is this that we're living in when a man accused guilty of rape
Is still freed from the charges miraculously if he confesses that he's made a mistake
Is a woman supposed to just spread both her legs and let the sexual ritual proceed
If she doesn't say no to do you have her permission to treat her any which way you please
Does the fact that she's wasted somehow make it accepted that she can't tell what's
Right from what's wrong.
Are the clothes that she's wearing an oblivious signal that
The rape is allowed to go on. You take it for granted cos' you've got the advantage
It's a logic that I find hard to follow. It still doesn't mean that the decision is
Is yours and I find your excuse hard to swallow
He clears his name
And she gets all the blame
If a woman raped a man
Would the verdict be the same
He clears his name
And she gets all the blame
If a woman raped a man
Would the verdict be the same
Tell me what were you thinking if you even were when you forced her to go all the way
Did you feel like a big man
When you were on top of her
Did you make that bitch pay
You're not a man you're the scum of the earth
You had the whole thing
Planned from the start and you've got the guts to say you feel like a virgin
There's not a soft spot in your heart
He clears his name
And she gets all the blame
If a woman raped a man
Would the verdict be the same
He clears his name
And she gets all the blame
If a woman raped a man
Would the verdict be the same
You make it seem as if she should have seen it coming as if that was a valid excuse
But whatever you say you still know what you've done and nothing justifies the abuse
It takes two too tango so don't you try and tell us that you were sure that
You heard her say yes
We don't believe you it's your cock doing the talking
So why don't you just fucking confess
He clears his name
And she gets all the blame
If a woman raped a man
Would the verdict be the same
He clears his name
And she gets all the blame
If a woman raped a man
Would the verdict be the same <start> Bonus Track <start> 
 <start> You got this habit you just can't shake
There's not much more your body can take
So you jab that needle in your vein
Another load of dirt for your brain
Scars and scars up and down your arms
Your body covered in a sheet of sweat
You made the choice
To drag out your life
In a dull drugged oblivion
Eyes wide open lips blue with death
Your lifeless body slumped over in a chair
No show at your funeral
No flowers on your grave
Dropping like flies <start> I thought you were alive
You're no use to anyone
The moment you arrive
All the deeds are done
I'm heading for a break
Laughter from the ground
I'm down in deepest freeze
I'd feel like fever now
When something goes reverse
It makes me want to puke
Before scratching my back
What was I thinking of
I thought I was you
I thought I could spend my life
For a break
From the ground
In deepest freeze
I'd feel like fever now
I go reverse
I want to puke
I scratch my back
I'd feel like fever now
I feel like fire now
What time did you see it happen
One face in a purple frame
Your crime is your radiant passion
A black border around the name
Thin blue line red light flashing
the silent rules of a lonesome game
I had to get away
I checked it more than once <start> There's always a need for violence
Slowly singing to the somber sun
Give my regards to the ones you call your angels
Dusted I'm the only one
I need to deaden all my feelings
When you comes to you
And should you rise again
I'll have no choice but follow through
I need to deaden
All my feelings
Should you rise again
I'll have no choice but follow through
If threatened just know
I'll respond in kind
Say the word
The word is blind
If threatened just know
I'll respond in kind
Say the word
The word is attack
Say your lamentations
Set sail for hell or damnation
No honest words on your lips
Confronted think quick
I've used it
I've abused it
It's abused me
It's confused me
And consumed me
I've been destroyed by trust
My heart can't erase it
Now I'm so fucking wasted
I can taste it
I've been destroyed by trust
Heard you say there's no need for violence
As you slowly sickening walk away
Give my regards to the ones you call your angels
Dusted I'm the only one
I need to deaden all my feelings
When you comes to you
And should you rise again
I'll have no choice but follow through
I need to deaden
All my feelings
Should you rise again
I'll have no choice but follow through
If threatened just know
I'll respond in kind
Say the word
The word is blind
If threatened just know
I'll respond in kind
Say the word
The word is attack
Say your lamentations
Set sail for hell or damnation
No honest words on your lips
Confronted. think quick
I've used it
I've abused it
It's abused me
It's contused me
And consumed me
I've been destroyed by trust
My heart can't erase it
Now I'm so fucking wasted
I can taste it
I've been destroyed by trust
Trust no one
My heart
Can't erase it
Now I'm so fucking wasted
I can taste it
I've been destroyed by trust
I've used it
I've abused it
It's abused me
It's confused me
And consumed me
I've been destroyed by trust
By trust
Trust no one
If you apologize
Will it all just go away in my eyes
If you apologize <start> Music Wiklund
Lyrics Schulman
Spirits are coming from a dark dead sky
The whispers and shadows are calling me
Molested and lost
My soul is turned to dust
The funeral in fire calls my name
The ancient dark desire tears me away
Power and damnation from the shining moon
Seven are the ways which will lead me through
Molested and lost
My soul is turned to dust
My scorn and my pagan hate
Engraved mournful lies
Realm of chaos arise
The other side awaits
Longing for the aeons under the bloodred clouds
My molested soul will enter the past
Into the abyss and over the stream
My visions became true and my soul is free
Molested and lost
My soul is turned to dust
My scorn and my pagan hate
Engraved mournful lies
Realm of chaos arise
The other side awaits
My dreams are deeper than deep
Visions are darker than black
We will dwell further
Gathered shall we be <start> I recall when the bright light descends
Something takes possession over me
I remember when the nightmares began
On that cold night of December th
I don't know what it is but I lost all control
Can't you see I'm condemned by the past that
They close in my history I don't want to be like
This no more you can't see what I mean but you
Would if you saw all the sight that I have seen
I cross my heart in hope to see
What I saw was not a part of me
Dig inside yourself and you shall feel
But dig to deep and you become like me
I hate to see one more get lost like I
To those big eyes
December
Evil words are spoken makes me fear
The world that now reigns over me
I was strong but now weak and I fall with my tears
Can't you please make the demons leave me be
I don't know what it is but I lost all control
Can't you see I'm condemned by the past that
They close in my history I don't want to be like
This no more you can't see what I mean but you
Would if you saw all the sight that I have seen
Please don't let your eyes meet mine
I have seen it all before
Cause the eyes mirror the soul
I hate to see one more get lost like I
Those big black eyes
December 
Those big black eyes
I hate to see one more get lost like I
Those big black eyes
December 
Those big black eyes <start> A poetic rhythm brought by the storm No grace no glory  pure pleasure in Pain Two
horned master is on the rise Deaths riding in by the storm they are driven Cant you hear
the screams  we are the damned We are the feast for the unholy priest Master and
Servant the puppets are on Man has to retreat for the masters brigade Listen  Listen 
Listen  to the hallow horn Listen to hallow horn A new race will be born Listen to hallow
horn A new race will be born The undefeatable legion Will kill the great pigeon This is one
of many futuristic and symbolic looks at how the world will once come to an end. Looking
at the wars that are been fought all over the world. We are nothing else than heading
straight into our decline. As we are raising hell everyday we have woken up the two
horned master. He is awake for the free blood. Soon there will be a big death storm
raging around the earth with his legions leading it. They will come to take our lost souls
and bring back purity with fire. He will be marching in with glory horns and will be leaving
a bloody soil. And we give support day by day. <start> I've felt the deadly grip of compromise
And fought to keep conviction burning in my eyes
Surrender perseverance doesn't recognize
And with the light of each new day I'll find my way
Beneath the pulsing beat of neon heat and city streets
Or on a mountain side under moonlit sky with stars on high
The answer lies not so much in where you are
But destination and what you'll find
Into the fire some would throw their lives
And hope that with security and fear subsides
Dreams and ambitions they would choose to hide
A disregarded spirit leaves them empty inside
Inside of every man a master plan the high command
Truth to one's self is shelter from the storm and keeps the sin unborn
The greatest truth I've ever known has been where truth begins where fear ends
How sad a man could lose his destiny to the powers that be in this world
For just outside this lifetime is a higher call stand or fall
Victory is more than just security
Affluency has no jurisdiction over death
Victorious the man who stands his ground and won't go down
But offers to the cause his every breath
I've felt the deadly grip of compromise
And fought to keep conviction burning in my eyes
Surrender perserverence doesn't recognize
And with the light of each new day I'll find my way
I've seen the empty eyes believing lies hypnotized
I stand uncompromised and await the new sunrise
The greatest truth I've ever known has been
where truth begins is where fear ends
Victory is more than just security
Affluency has no jurisdiction over death
Victorious the man who stands his ground and won't go down
But offers to the cause his every breath <start> Originally performed by O.M.D.
If Joan of Arc had a heart
would she give it as a gift
To such as me who longs to see
how a legend oughta be
Had dreams to give her heart away
like an orphan along the way
She cared so much
she offered up her body to the grave <start> Whoa here it comes
That funny feelin' again windin'
Me up inside
Every time we touch
Hey I don't know
Oh tell me where to begin
'Cause I never ever
Felt so much. Hey
An' I can't recall any love at all
Oh baby this blows 'em all away
It's got what it takes
So tell me why can't this be love
Straight from my heart oh tell
Me why
Can't this be love
I tell myself
Hey Only fools rush in an' only
Time will tell
If we stand the test of time
All I know
You've got to run to win an' I'll
Be damned if
I'll get hung up on the line. Hey
No I can't recall any thing at all
Oh baby this blows 'em all away
Woo It's got what it takes
So tell me why can't this be love
You want it straight from the heart oh tell
Me why
Can't this be love <start>  <start> Armies of antiquity
A federation of nomadic tribes
Scourge of God
We are the most feared
Exorting fortunes
Vanquishing empires
Our domain is the vast plains
An orgy of conquest
Swift and fatal in our execution
Pillage the enemy
Before they're aware
Filling the air with
Discordant cries
Unpredictable barbarians
Fighting in no regular order
Leaving all in astounding defeat
Without regard to personal safety
Without regard
Savage ways and elaborate tactics
Unpredictable barbarians
The most terrible of Huns
Our pleasures fulfilled in warfare
Pillage the enemy
Before they're aware
Filling the aie with
Discordant cries <start> The world has turned and left me here
Alone with nothing but my fears
I feel the stiff of age it cracks
Mirror reflects just what I lack
I am standing here dying to be
To mean anything to anyone but me
I am naked now bereft of life's meaning
I am a shadow of what was
Plummet to sunken depths
There will be nothing left
Secrets of my being are being from me kept
There will be no resolve
For this wreck of nerves
Cheers to the axe that falls to the end
that I deserve
I am standing here dying to be
To mean anything to anyone but me
I am naked now bereft of life's meaning
I am a shadow of what was
A shadow of what was
You are dead to me
I am dead to me
My pulse has stopped you see
The butcher's waiting meat
And for eternity
As Satan laughs
we'll burn together
and scream abysmally
The work has turned and left me here
Alone with nothing but my fears
I feel the stiff of age it cracks
Reflects just what I lack
I am alone
I live alone
I'll die alone
Beneath a nameless stone
I am standing here dying to be
To mean anything to anything but me
I am naked now bereft of life's meaning
I am a shadow of was
I'll try this noose on just because
Signed your friend abysmally <start> Verse one
 ounces of thousand in grams
I ain't never had shit now I plot to piss or a stick
Ain't nothing in my jeans but some lint and some dick
Who want to hunger young rick
Thinking I can't get out the situation
I'm 'bout to make these bitches sick
Since a little nigga started to vision nigga
Now when dophines' surely come I know how much to give her
Single bags to dimes dimes tens to twhomp twhomps
Catch me in the set and I'ma have what'cha want want
Playing it raw I ain't out here for my health
And tell the Temp service ain't blood myself
Enjoyed myself blocks away from the melt
And proving thy self from cream that don't melt
Chorus
 Before real nigga's kiss up to the man 
 ounces of thousand in grams
If it ain't legal and from Uncle Sam
 ounces of thousand in grams
How I get them cars houses and land
 ounces of thousand in grams
You ain't seeing shit till money in hand
 ounces of thousand in grams
Verse two
My brother and cousin got a plan
Look that dope ain't got touch my hands
But yet this bad and I'm the one with the life sands
A ten millimeter for protection
For any jacker or badge that run up in my section and ah
I cost to cigars from being broke
And this ain't lemonheads or no bar of soap and ah
To old for McDonalds that killed hope
And all the hustla's around my way got cars with no notes so ah
Penetentries chance's here I come
That nigga move to fast I'ma pop his ass one 
Drop his ass one 
Bringing home the brick
What 'ya know when the Fiend got his own started up git
Chorus <start> De lo peor que me ha pasado
hice cancin porque yo canto lo que siento.
Violentamente al otro lado se fue mi amor
sin un adis sin un hasta luego.
No estuve yo para evitarlo tal vez.
Lo inevitable no responde al vade retro.
Suele la gente equivocarse aqu.
Y las personas ver verdad en lo no cierto.
Una gran razn me asiste en este viaje.
Dos flores de tu amor.
Razn causa y efecto.
La chismosa bruja y la amistad infiel
no guardan tus flores.
Porque yo yo las guardo bien.
La primera est polenizando
y el pequeo capullo
se est abriendo a cielo abierto.
Y no he de negarlo
he conseguido un nuevo amor
pues sigo en la vida
recordando de vos lo mejor.
Es el amor el responsable
nica gua del espritu imperfecto.
Es es amor el responsable creo yo.
Es la verdad es el sentido. El Padre Nuestro. <start> You walk around always screaming about
How you're trying to get your way
But you should just keep your fucking fat mouth shut
If you got nothing important to say
Because you
You got a lot to learn
All you do is bitch about the things in life that get you down
You never care for nobody else
If you saw how your life looks to me
I think you'd be ashamed of yourself
Because you
You got a lot to learn
You live inside your fucked up world
Talking loud with nothing to say
You got a lot to learn about your life
Because you can't keep on living this way
Because you
You got a lot to learn <start> performed and written by Shamaatae and Sataros.

Looking back I know it's what I'd die for
And through all this life
Smashed away all the strife
A friendship I paint
Untouchable
Crawling from the floor
I been there before
There I was staring back at the bottom
And let's make this clear
It came from these tears
Carved across our chests
Loyalty
And with the new light there was young hope
To underline the meaning
And carve our names in
At the end of August
The end of
At the end of August
The end of
I'll never replace the ones I first made

Time to forget time to look back
Time to fall down time to keep time

Present becomes past and the future now
How I influence the past
While I'm looking forward
Closer from my goal
The next cog perfect symbiosis
Time to live time to hope
Time to forget lime to look back
Time to fall down time to keep time

The cog of time has crushed my brain
It turns turns in my head

It turns the wheel of destiny <start> Wicked winds  blowing hard
Riding straight  into the dark
Ebony mist  rises high
Ravenwings  I can fly
A fearless heart  will survive
A soul of pain  will never die
A sword of grim  a hate so old
And I will strike  Just as foretold

A mighty burst blasts the gates of the dimensions
Flying right into the heart of the chaos engine
Strange things I see strange things I hear
Nowhere to hide nothing to fear
The deeper down  as I go
Into the place  you'll never know
To face the enemy  eye to eye
A mighty battle  one shall die
Not me 
Into eternity
The deeper down  as I go
Into the place  you'll never know
To face the enemy  eye to eye
A mighty battle  one shall die
WAR
Fighting hard as armies fall
Batteling gods in marble halls
I am wounded down on my knees
They can't kill nature cause nature is me
Noone believes in you  so will die forever
Noone will pray to you  you will be dead forever more.
The deeper down as I went
The more I knew what it meant
Eternal wind take me away
No more reason for me to stay
The gods are slayn the battle won
The nature free revenge is done
So I am dying  but you will die forever
Noone will know you  but nature will be foever. x <start> Lyrics From Nvaml
I know that I hung
in the windcold tree
nine whole nights
with hurt point
To Oden given
self given to myself
In that thee
which nobody knows
>From which roots it ran
Not given bread
they brought no horns
Saw down from the tree
took up runes
took them with screams
and down from the tree I fell
Nine magic songs I got
from the famous son of
Boltorn Besdas Father
and a drink I got
of precious mead
poured by Odrere
Then I became vigorous
and got wise
grew and felt well
of word sought word
the word again
of work sought work
the work again
Music Ivar Bjrnson  <start> Music M.Carlsson  Ablaze My Sorrow
Lyrics M.Carlsson
Black shadows creeping down the wall
Another life is about to end
I can feel the hour creeping closer now
Today it's my execution day
Without fear in my eyes
I walk  meters to the chair
The thoughts that rush through my brain
Makes me once again see their pain
Kill me set me free
Come to me beautiful death
Kill me set me free
Feel the pleasure of killing me
I rather dead forever
Then living without my needs
When the lightning strike through my eyes
And my skin starts to burn
This act will give you satisfaction
You think you have saved the world <start> The signal flares will light the way
To the scene of the accident where we'll dance
Like a pile of teeth in a broken mouth
Such a sick celebration
But everyone loves a fucking tragedy in epic proportions
Let's set our hearts at selfdestruct
Let's set our hearts at selfdestruct
Like scarlet drips on a white tile floor a cardiac metronome
Scrape the guardrail from our teeth and start again
Like scarlet drips on a white tile floor a cardiac metronome
We'll scrape the guardrail from our teeth and start again
There's a flood in the infirmary
Where we'll swim through broken glass
Our prosthetic limbs will keep us afloat
There's a flood in the infirmary

Let's set our hearts at selfdestruct
Let's set our hearts at selfdestruct


Let's set our hearts at selfdestruct

Let's set our hearts at selfdestruct

Let's set our hearts at selfdestruct

Let's set our hearts at selfdestruct

and dance the jesus christ. <start> This day forms more and more my wish to enter unknown paths
I desire light on my way to the spirit world
I wish to enter spirit worlds a dreamland full of coloured words
Dreams now they rage how they roar
Thoughts pulsate and break the gate
Light me the way to sharpened dreams then I will smile all days 'till end <start> Can you see the stars
I want to go into space to find another world
Following the voices of my soul
I will come to you my only god
Waiting for the time when I can't see your open eyes
But I will find the way to change my broken life
Take my way
and together we will ride the sky
where I'll play in the shadows of the night
Fly away
and forever you will change your life
We can wait for eternal light
There's no way to stop this cold machine
I will close my eyes with all my dreams
Night and day I'm waiting to be free
And I know there is only one key
Looking for the sky now I can see your open eyes
Let me become the death and everything will die
Take my way
and together we will ride the sky
where I'll play in the shadows of the night
Fly away
and forever you will change your life
We can wait for eternal light <start> A struggle of change that is made. a wrinkle in time battle of the brave fighting for hope of one's beliefs. Decieving thoughts planted in minds. when hell freezes over will come the time that ones point will have been made. theres shattered thoughts and broken dreams. wasted lives all of the brighter side of suffering. Theres more than fighting for causes theres fighting for what you beleive. If theres a fork in the road of your path one sides needles the others glass. At least your walking instead of dragging on whats paved. Some see the glass half empty others full. I just see the waters cold and so is this world that we live in. And so I segregate. Seperated from the ones with out a cause.
I segragate. I segragate. Would you believe Could you believe Theres more to this than what it seems. Its the brighter side of suffering. Poverty injustice struggling with the pain. A humble mind of wisdom and noncorruption. Would you believe Theres more to this from this life Theres more fo this Finding a soultion hope for tomorrow for a better today A new revolution We stand and fight and face the pain <start> So here stand again on the island of madness and pain
My fate is calling me to walk cut of the dark and the rain
If I could go where I can Walk I can run I can breath
where destiny is clear from the smoke and the smell of debris
I raise my hands up to the voices in the sky
Forever I mass go and a find the other side
How can we go from here if we don't stop the war
And How can we lose all the fear if we don't stop the war
Now you stand before me you ask me where to go
Just go and for it way cause really I don 't know
My mind is going crazy my head is spinning round
Been searching for the savior he's nowhere to be found
And when I raise my head up to the sky
Then Still the question will be burning my mind
How can we go from here if we don't stop the war
And How can we lose all the fear if we don't stop the war
How long will it take how long will it take
How long will it take until the stop the war
I said how can we go from here if we don't stop the war
And How can we lose all the fear if we don't stop the war
How long How long How long
I said how long How long How long
Stop the war stop the war stop the war
Stop the war stop the war stop the war

Say you love say you love say you love it now.
Say you love it say you love say you love me now <start> Anal penetration
Shincter muscle split
Tender shredded rectum
Makes it hard to sit
The tissue from your buttocks
Ripped from the bone
Shit oozes from the cavity
As a sloppy rectal moan
Horrid black shit
Spews from the pit
Starts to convulse
Bogus anal fit
It rips the flesh
A vile anal death
This putrid rotten stench
Or horrid rectal breath <start> Ich sehe so hufig den alten Mann
Den Grauen den Weisen
Und seine Schriften.
Ich sehe und denke so hufig daran
Die Lehre vergiften
Das Neue zu preisen
Das war sein Sinn.
Ideen beweisen
Das Dunkel zu lften.
Ich sehe und denke so hufig daran
An mich und den alten Mann.
Und wieder seh' ich mich am Wegesrand
Wo zwei Pfade aus einem sich spalten.
Beide fhren zum Ende der Zeit
Doch nur einen gewhrt mir das husliche Band
Aus vermeindlicher Weitsicht. Vergangenheit
Lebt in der Zukunft nach Meinung der Alten.
Sie schren Konflikte fhren sie morden und walten.
Ererbte Vernunft und gebrannter Verstand.
Ich sehe so hufig den jungen Mann
Seh' nur sein Gesicht
Und seine Zge.
Ich sehe und denke so hufig daran
Im Blute zu rhren
Die Schwerter zu fhren
Das war nicht sein Sinn.
Und immer die Lge
Von Ehre und Pflicht.
Ich sehe und denke so hufig daran
An mich. Den jungen Mann. <start> Breathe deeply clear your head
Leave the world behind you
Undead gods they await
So enter the chamber
Sit right down and gaze
Into the magick mirror
Your body it feels
All the stored lifeforce
Necromanteion communion a vampiric rite
Necromanteion communion the immortal sight
Necromanteion communion beyond thoughts of time
Necromanteion communion for the royal bloodline
Necromanteion communion enlightment from beyond
Necromanteion communion sacred nightside bond
Necromanteion communion on an astral plane
Necromanteion communion those who have risen again
See the patterns of dark and light
The dreamlike images begin
Time to use vampiric eyes
To go even further
Remain calm open the gate
Sense the manifestation
Sacrifice the lifeforce
Now embrace the calling
Necromanteion communion a vampiric rite
Necromanteion communion the immortal sight
Necromanteion communion beyond thoughts of time
Necromanteion communion for the royal bloodline

You hear the whisper calling
You hear the whisper calling
You hear the whisper calling
Every comb of hair
The times you see red
Every hair on your head
Every thread on your back
Every piece of skin
Every mouth you fed
Every word that you said
Every drop that you bled <start> Walk on my rainchild
so pure and waiting for the dawn
walk on my rainchild to god
Go on my redsky
so sure and longing for your spawn
go on my deadsky my god
Rape me
Blame me
Hate me
Feed me but it's not worth dying for
on your walk outside my door

I'm the god you were before
So cry a sad smile
as frail as morpheous and sweet
so cry a dead smile to god <start> i felt so anxious for what we had in store
but then you took that away
for your dreams and your desires
that i couldnt provide
ive got my hopes im a fighter
i wont answer what you need answered
i wont say a word i wont say anything
so bury me in ectasy and take the pain away.
o youve gotta be kidding me 
i wont answer what you need answered its so unfair
i wont say a word i wont say anything
bury me in ecstacy we'll try to find a way.
im just selfish
i wont retreat . <start> You'll never let me you'll never get me you'll never get me away. Don't ever want me don't ever love me I'll just push you

REFLEX. It's not the way you love me it's not the way you love me it's not the way you love me it's the way that you don't... <start> Decide everything for me
Subject yourself to it
Make believe it's only your fault
Stifle my own
Ambition
It's been so long since I failed
Nothing alienates this
Anything reminds me
Relieving it only helps
Suffer to make your own gains
It's been so long since I failed
And now my senses fail me
And still my training fails me
And now everything fails me
And still everyone fails me
And still the only thing I have fails me <start> Their eyes are opened
slowly they are starting to breathe
the sky is growling in wrath
thunder and lightning is released
aware of eachothers powers
a feeling of battle appears
facing heaven in anger
a carnage is soon to await
Through the virgin sky
raping the surface
penetrating earth
powers from the lost world
Total fucking chaos
the ancient meets today
erased is the hope
sudden death to come
Through the virgin sky
raping the surface
penetrating earth
powers from the lost world
Visions from the past
marching into war
unleashed upon the earth
killing all that breathes
Through the virgin sky
raping the surface
penetrating earth
powers from the lost world
Their eyes are opened
slowly they are starting to breathe
the sky is growling in wrath
thunder and lightning is released
aware of eachothers powers
a feeling of battle appears
facing heaven in anger
a carnage is soon to await <start> Music Wiklund
Lyrics Schulman
A misty ground
Seals my soul of pagan fire
Ripped apart
Dark emotions and inner thoughts
We will all
Take part in the endless journey
As we weep
To the hymns of an arctic star
My demon within
conquer my mind
Echoes of frost

Damnation reigns
A sorcery of fear and sorrow
Eternal thorns
Flew high like glory shadows
In the past
A silent age of divine destruction
Led me through
To a world
of subconscious demons
Illusions fall
In the halls of slumber centuries
Passed away
In temples of obscurity
Infinity
I watch the land of mortality
Eternally
Dwell among the seven prophecies
Beholding the winds
of crimson calls
Wastelands
the grounds of vengeance
My demon
my princess of wisdom
I sharpen my swords
And into the kingdom I ride
Prophanity
I have seen the spiritual aeons
A shadowdance
Like a mistress of hidden thunder
In time and space
I am dying I am searching
For a fire
Which can raise my inner demon <start> Spirit is your fate and burden
Spirit is your destination
Long times ago in a dark night
You felt body and soul unite
In a dream of epiphany
You were given perspicuity
Dignity autonomy supremacy
Ancient spirits cursed though your veins
The sparks in you turned into flames
You heard battle drums thundering
Was this a dream or an awakening
A destining foreshadowing offering
The gods have marked you for your life and death
The gods will guide you up to your last breath
Spirit Soldier
You will lead a secret life sheltered by darkness
Up to the day that the Spirit soldiers will conquer and then
The twilight mountains you will climb
Brighter than the sun you will shine
Louder than thunder you will roar
Above the world your voice will soar
Through the universe you will fly
Expand the earth tear up the sky
Once your spirit will break free
A new spring will bring liberty
The gods blessed you with power and a vision
The gods gave you life to accomplish a mission
Being a soldier of spirit in a cold and shallow world
Will at times seem to you rather a curse than a gift
Sometimes you damn the ancient spirits
Everything seems grim and senseless
They tell you that there's no forgiveness
For the thousand sins you could confess
Then you envy the blind fools
Who thrive in mediacracies
Who love and hate as they are told
Devoted to trivialities
Spirit Soldier
Sometimes your dreams take you to the land Of purity silence and soul
Where you feel unchained and alive
Where fate is under your control
Then you thank the great omnipotent Creators of life and spirit
That with the dawning of a new age
You'll be united with the infinite
Spirit soldier
The gods sent you to provide for enlightenment
The gods have placed you in line of their descent
Spirit Soldier <start> Als ich dich sah in dieser Nacht
so schon zart vollkommen
das Eis in deinem schwarzen Haar
...und ich gab dir neues Leben
Ich formte deinen weien Korper
mit meinen eisigen Handen
Lippen rot wie Blut
...und ich gab dir neues Leben
Winternacht <start> Instrumetal <start> Won't kiss the mouth that mocks the pain that's inflicted
Though that I could trust but I was tricked instead
Won't embrace the one who burdens me until I snap
Left to languish bleeding caught inside this trap
Throwing rocks at a drowning man
Everyone should try it
No point to struggle anymore
The one weapons that sharpens every time it's used
That venomous tongue is always eager to abuse
When everything around me starts to tip and fall
Vicious when I'm down winds up to kick me when I crawl
Throwing rocks at a drowning man
Everyone should try it
No point to struggle anymore
It's all just useless now
I can't keep it up <start> Vengeance provoked
behold the mark of cain
Uncreate the genesis
devoured by the abyss
Cleave the covenant
and powers that grant
Bury the testament
tumbled by torment
Nocturnal
infernal
The suffering eternal
soaking the rays of celestial
Light
noctiluca
Profane
arcane
Benediction of bane
falling through cracks of
Darkness
obumbration
Kingdoms quake
mountains move
Skies collapse
sulphur decending
Suns eclipse
seas overflow
End of days
Hades arising
The father
son and holy ghost
Tridents penetrate
steel and flesh conjugate
Vaporize the spirits of distress
sabaoth of legions
Redder the regions
Time in reverse
the god heads rear
The blood divine splattered on the threepronged spear
the dagger of night
Hearts stabbed and cloaked
the banishing of the fallen one has been revoked <start> Es war das Weiss der Schwane so rein und sterbensbang man sah's wie
Engel am Friedensbogen schimemern nicht wie Fahnen die sich vom Winde
verdrehen liessen Schwane sind diese furchtsamen Kinder sie winken nicht
wie sie singen Schwane sind diese weinenden Desichter der Trauer wollen
sie gefallen
Aus einem Briefe Lavaters kurz vor seinem Tod .
Aufzug im stuck. Verandertes Buhnenbild Szene am Tumpel. .
Schemel zieren die Holzbuhne So stoisch meine Apfel kunden dies Liebreiz
ich fand hold in trunknen Lettern aufgeschrieben Geschopf' so bleich dem
Wolkenzelte wir Bubchen reihten in Gedichten als statt der Sonne tanzt'
im See zwei federn' Kinder vorwarts schleichend ob der tiefen Augen
trub und offen weinendAls Freundes Wort dies Teich uns nannt' und bleich
manch Tran' der unsren Wangenrucken trocknet welch Stoss in unsrem Kleid
geboren wir bedacht des Tumpelschimmers diese Schemel jener Stube doch
verschleppten Konstanz und Lavater mit langen rotten Barten Lavater als
Maler
Lavater
Welch Skizze ich gezeichnet dies susser Augenschein im Bildnis des
Fewassers trockenein hupfendes Laternchen welch grafliches Geschlecht
weich zarter fegern' Wasserdrach' als knistend' hold Geschoss taucht ein
in Weihers blauem Rauche weichend Konstanz mein werter Vetter welch
Trane ward vergossen dass statt der Lurch' und zottigen Genossen ein
Schwanenvogel uns vor Augen als stummer Treiber er wirft Flammchen in
dies verfeuchten Tumpeldochte wie bloss des Mondes eigen' Scheine die
Skizze meiner zierend
Konstanz
Mein gnadiger Herr zu laut der Euren Worte fast hold der Eifer Hand
manch Tran' ward Euch gewiss vergossen doch Farben Eures Blattes wegen
dies Licht verschluckt' des federn' Kindes bleiche MajestatSo schminkt sie
bloss mit Wachs und Schuh' Scheltwort ihr ins Gesichte werdet schlagen
denkt schon ans winkende Kindlein dem blutenden Fleisch so bleibend dem
Spiege Eures Vogels gleich So zeigt her Euer Bildlein den schwanernen
Leibe so weiss wie manch Flock' vom Schnee dies Grabes' Verbleib verwuhlt
in spitz' Dornen kehrt um jenen Vogeln lebewohl zu sagen und stets ein
scharlachrotes Lichtlein zu dammen auf den nackten Dochte Der Springbrunn'
jen' verweintem Kleid er tat sein armes Schlaflein ganz ahnlich einer
fremden Zeit Ach weh die matte Eb'ne dieses Tumpels sie schaukette wie
ein Schiff <start> On the day that you woke me up from our dream to your nightmare
I didnt know it was possible to feel so alone being with you
I tried to move but you glued me to your side with all that you gave me
Did you catch the moon together
When I saw the look upon your face
I knew we had lost precious hours through our days
Did her skin feel as soft as you always said mine are to your fingers
Did her eyes look as deep into your soul as you always said mine did
Hunting down all my strength to reveal that clouds have appeared for regression
I tried to move but youve glued me to your side with all that you gave me
Will I find my way home <start> How could I ever go back
Back to the life
Where I lived amongst the dead
Who have forgotten how to feel
And become slaves to memory
And wishful thinking
But your love has set me free
As you awaken every star
That has been sleeping
In the constellation of my soul
How could I go back to live amongst the dead
Those who imprisoned beauty
I never want to leave your arms
So I wait in hope for your embrace
Illusions of what I thought was love
Now I have clear sight to see
That I have left nothing behind <start> From a tangled dream
you awake because of a silent cry
A cry from somewhere outside
your mind and your comprehension
Somehow attractive like the call
of sirens leading you to your death
The cry makes you leave your home
and walk towards your painful end
All people gathered around
the monument of endlessness
The flying tears and the sound
detach your mind and flesh
Without warning the tears turn into blood
and crying stops earripping screaming starts
You feel only pain like everyone else
until your head and brain blow away... <start> instrumental <start> I have a mind a good memory
Here's how my life begins
I wasn't born from a woman's thighs
But from fire
I dwell on that dream
I don't want that to fade
I keep that dream
Until the axe does all that work
I was kept under the table
Raised from their sigh
I was worthless till the day
When flames did all the work
On the day I was born
They denied my rights
Even the right to die <start> I bow down your precious icon deity of self suppression
This effigy of flesh corporeal Christi nailed
In submission to this false idol seeking deliverance
From this spiritual hierarchy downward spiralling a corrupt throne
Of repression and guilt
Our will be done
Thy kingdom burn
On my knees before this tormented flesh in irreverence
In communion with this parasitic host of virtuous divinity
This imperious creed bears testament to the failures of our morality
Righteous durance is our cross we bear in stations
In stations of the lost
Our will be done
Thy kingdom burn thy kingdom burn
Our will be done
From your knees arise
By your own hand your god you scribe
The earth shall inherit the meek
Your god is dead
Bound down in God we're trussed foul stature
Icons embodied in flesh we nail
In servitude to deities fashioned in our self image
Shadows of eternal strife cast by those who serve
Serve a crown of pawns <start> Part One
This is a world blessed by the victims
Of carnal tragedy
The humans ritual of love and adoration
Densewoven history
Sentiments decide existance the artwork that I've bled
Bizarre she defined her presence
With the lament of the undead
When her eyes have bathed in danger
And the moon had new design
In the cradle of our desire all the blood has turned to wine
But the love no longer remained than just a stir to survive
In this labyrinth of perfidity for my mistress to recover
I'll forever strive...
Part Two
Dem Sterbenden  die Hoffnung
Dem Propheten  Der Fluch
Der Liebe  die Dichtung die dem Sterben entsprung...
The night is crystal clear  words are sent from pictures
Sounds that I can't hear  as weakness wins my body
Selling cheap my soul  and its bleeding heart
Eclipsing the whole  planet history and light...
Part Three
Sometimes when the sun hides in the back of the earth
When the hungry souls to whom pain gave birth
Embalm their coldness with the blood's warmth... then
I can clearly hear the calling of a lonely and distant star
In the shade of the abhorrent
Yet in the still of the nights  In the still of the moment
When the moment dies
There she gently approaches
With the new meaning of life...
In a haze of hazard in the withering chill
Baleful's the passion when hearts stand still
A flood of sentiments entwined
Rattle thru my falling soul
I slumber against the spirit of time
Like a stranger in a foreign world
In a park along the alleys stained with blood and tears
In the hour when dusk disperses
Its colors on the white statues
Then I'll wander as a phantom of the posthumous regrets
And my fiery lips I'll freeze
With the kiss of these unrivalled statues
Sin asta noapte sfirsese printrun sarut
Poeme  agonizate deun infinit siun inceput
Part Four
The allengulfing dawn of habitude shows his claws again
Do you still remember our oath  Til light do us part
Come forth Feline
Mere moment of melancholy
Drink deep of my desire
The quenchless fire
That unites our tameless embers...
Come forth Feline
Tortured by our final duet
Let thy pale fingers slide on the petals of the flowers
That thee stained with mortal coagulated blood...
On the walls midnight closes even the stoical eyes
Of the unsleeping portraits
And the whiteeye of a lonely candle falls asleep
Into its own startling solitude...
Part Five
Silent heart desires
The balm that drives away the human waste
Oh come infidel duchess
Shrouds of frost fall furiously down... of thee I taste again
Deciphering eternity of its ruined scripts
Of the tenebrious river I pleasantly sip
Upon lifeless leaves autumn has banished
Arises my lovelorn aura's odyssey
Un ornic cu rostiri funebre suna amiazandirjit
Iar cerumprastia tenebre peste parcul amortit
...Returned into that park as a whole
Under the questioning eyes of stars and heavens
Dreaming away on the lost love I've recovered
Death suddenly rises
Annoyed that he couldn't save me
He turns pale from envy
The seasons vanish and so does this story
As the same poets hand raises the pen
He pictured this spectacle with...
The actors fade on the dreary alleys of that elder park
Only two nightshades remaining 
Celebrating the sunset of ages while their sullen laughter
Lustfully haunts the mortal seeds of ruin...
Nights were crystal clear  words were sent from pictures
The colors have seared  these pages whereas
The darkest hour revealed  the mysterious hand
Which dutifully sealed
This episode's arcane End. <start> can see
when you stay low nothing happens
does it feel right 
Late at night
things I thought I put behind me
haunt my mind
I just know there's no escape
now once it sets its eyes on you
but I won't run have to stare it in the eye
Stand my ground I wont give in
no more denying I got to face it
won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside
if I dont make it someone else will
stand my ground
It's all around
getting stronger coming closer
into my world
I can feel
that it's time for me to face it
can i take it
Though this might just be the ending
of the life I held so dear
but I won't run there's no turning back from here
Stand my ground 
All I know for sure is I'm trying
I will always stand my ground
Stand my ground  <start> We have sat like this just waiting for their arrows to blacken the skies
Many times before and we will again God willing
I am honoured to have served alongside men who inspire defiance
Sometimes I tired from the fighting and the killing
We are survivors
The ones left behind
The last of our legacy
The last of our kind
Children
We are the last of our kind
Children
We are the last of our kind
When the arrows fall like rain
We'll survive and rise again
We are the last of our kind
All the jackals and the undead just can't wait to wipe the last of us out
Once there were others like us then there were none
Late at night whilst the world is sleeping I can hear the call of my kin
They wait for me and when I join them we will be forgotten
We are survivors
The ones left behind
The last of our legacy
The last of our kind
Children
We are the last of our kind
Children
We are the last of our kind
When the arrows fall like rain
We'll survive and rise again
We are the last of our kind
Children
We are the last of our kind
Children
We are the last of our kind
When the arrows fall like rain
We'll survive and rise again
We are the last of our kind <start> You're the worst of all
With all your accusations and compunction
I can't suffer this duress
From someone so deprayed and selfish
You embody all that I've been through
Without you I am sure I will be loved
My existence conforms to your distress
Your ambition the cause of mine
A disruption I'm nothing even less
Misfortunes never come singly and I was there to stay
You don't allow me a single place
Nor any love into your lives
An unperceived annoying presence you'd rather ignore
But in my life you know you'll leave... a beautiful emptiness
Where you used to be
Impotent screams will turn
Into the love of silence
My liberation then silence
Will be perfect and pure
It's all in my dreams
I'll remove you
And all our mutual disgust
In my dreams
I solve the problem by removing it
My wish is to see you grovel
Like you once forced me to
There's no other way here's my course of life
A path without the sickening trace of you
I need the beauty of a cleared pure world
This eternal interruption of your rash life can save me
You don't allow me a single place
Nor any love into your lives
An unperceived annoying presence you'd rather ignore
But in my life you know you'll leave... a beautiful emptiness
It's sad to feel you don't believe in love
It's sad that you're so cold
And I'll be the same
If you keep on poisoning my life
Drowning in selfsacrificing visions
When you're gone then we will all be released
It's sad my life has been like hell so far
It's sad that you're the cause
And I'll be cured in this beautiful empty world
Floating floating away with your perilous visions and hate
When you're gone silence will fill up the emptiness
When you're gone we all will be released
In my dreams I shall rinse my body and soul
My wish
The accomplishment lies here before me in my hands
I will be released from your accusing eyes
And torrents of verbal abuse
You'll know the causes are your own mistakes
While life flows out of you
and exempts me forever <start> No brainwaves or activity
While the craft is in the air
It's getting dark it's getting light
We are sitting in a chair
We have fastened every belt
We cannot float out of our seats
It's so enormously frightening
When our tail reaches superheat
Another timezone
A change of season
It is turning dark again
We're getting ready for yet
Another orbit around our planet
It is time for the galactic cruise
To come to an end
One last view on the world
And the time we have spend <start> Love is what we got
A terrible mistake
This bedroom is caught on fire
And killed
Two birds with one stone
A terrible love song
You sang it so sweet
If I ever see you again
And this gun is loaded
You'll sleep in hell
You'll sleep in it
If I ever see you again
And this gun is loaded
You'll sleep in hell
You'll sleep in hell
Love is what we lost
We had a connection
This feeling has gone too far
And killed
Two birds with one stone
A terrible love song
You sang it so sweet
If I ever see you again
And this gun is loaded
You'll sleep in hell
You'll sleep in it
If I ever see you again
And this gun is loaded
You'll sleep in hell
You'll sleep in hell
You told me you'd keep this between us
But
If you're so sorry
I hope you're happy
You slung
Your tongue
At me
You're wrong
If I ever see you again
And this gun is loaded
You'll sleep in hell
You'll sleep in it
If I ever see you again
And this gun is loaded
You'll sleep in hell
You'll sleep in hell <start> Such a shame such a shame
Critical...
You're living foul things are getting wild
It's difficult to raise a child
Cause growin up in a lost environment
Every day becomes a new experiment
Now we are faced with problems
But if we come together we can solve them
Before we start to solving here's a sample
Who's coming foward to set the example
Inflation starvation
Surviving takes a strong nation
Those who like to bring about static
Be aware of the true asiatic
What you see was predicted before
We were already warned of this bloody drug war
Wherever you sell it wherever you go
Ya still being clocked by the cops ya know
You're paid by the hours they see time flies
While your brain's being showered by a bunch of lies
You say I'm no slave where's the lock and chain
Hmmm on your ignorant brain
Skip to ya loo with your high pro glow
Ya not stim off life ya stimulated off blow
Or the new improved ask beaming jack
Criza criza crack
Chorus you're living foul living foul
My people you were forced then brought
Stripped from your jewels brainwashed and then taught
To hate deceive and dislike each other
Separating themselves you're not my brother
Sit up at home for a mystery
Facevaluing things that you can't see
Can't taste can't smell hear or feel
But senses prove everything is real
I'm here to present a positive way
If strong you'll accord if weak you'll stray
Drug users are stuck in the mud
Another th century modern day chud
These cannibal humanoid undernourished dwellers
Just took your check to the heroin cellar
Dope addicts that walk and roam
Might have acquired immune deficiency syndrome
Aids doesn't come from me
Cause I've studied and learned my history
It had to be something evil to bring that about
This is showing and proving beyond a shadow of a doubt
Chorus you're living foul living foul
When you wake up to a brand new day
And you think about your salary or your pay
You think of negative things should I get involved
Caught in crime serving time that's problems to solve
So you think about it say that you must quit
Smoke a blunt then you do the same old shhhh
And while ya high you don't truly know why
You spent your cash so that you can buy
Some herb  and some old e 
A fifty cent philly so the herb can be
Rolled up modern style to what we call a blunt
Know the facts is true don't try to front
Or stray away from the positive message in the song
That's only showing and proving you're not strong
And the strong is what we need today
Why they go the opposite way
Chorus of living foul you're living foul
The words right now flowing off my tongue
Is for the old the young the one's that's strong
Those who are worshippers of diamonds and gold
You should not be bought and you should not be sold
Those who always want but does not need
Is slightly controlled by the hands of greed
If you rob steal backstab and abduct
Sooner or later you will selfdestruct
Chorus you're living foul <start> Engraved in damnation
Beneath the shadow of submergence
We await this call to Armageddon
To arise in legions of war
Burn the holy words and carve my blasphemy into angel bone
A faith buried in fire where a cold tomb lies
This desire in murdering the slaves of Christ
Sound the horn to winter's plague
Storm of one hundred years to be forged by tidal waves
Flesh bound by the rites of demon lords
Diversity in divine
Submerged in a countless death of winter
Encryption of the damned
A haunting curse to celebrate this chaos
Whispers in rites of blood
Metal and flesh are joined for spell
Bathed in flames of the serpent
Invoked on this day of hell
Rising legion raised for war
Confines of chains in heaven's fall
The dead climb sky preparing this invasion
This inferno of souls rise from the cold lake of hell
An embrace of suffering in transcendence
In birth of the knowledge of evil
The black heart in honor of the fallen
Conquer all that deny
My screams fill the timeless skies
A torture harsh and beautiful
Skinless souls placed as markers in possessive praise of hell's firstborn
Obedience in conjuration of swallowed souls
Trapped in eternal sleep below this surface
Courting death at the hands of fools lost in silence
Awaken in spoken words of the evoking art
Burn all remorse upon your cold pale flesh
Give to me your blood like a sacrament
Enigmatic force of deception
This order of the formless
Born from black decree
Pestilence in the form of storms
To drown the armies of the holy <start> Drops of new gleaming
In the flesh new morning light
My body cold and trembling
I've left the safty of the night
I sit here on the ground
By my side there lies a knife
I was her fault I'm not to blame
I have to take her life
My tearwet eyes won't focus
And neither will my head
I just sit here in the silence
Nothing lives here  all is dead
These feelings born inside
A new side of me is born
For ever face I see
I feel such raging scorn
When you took my life away
It gave you a new vision
I planted a seed
It gave you a mission
From beside the lifless flesh
I pick up my bloody knife
I wander into a new day
Prepeared to take another life <start> lSalles mSallesGama
A mortal sign ascends from time to time
Unto every man that succumbs to deep temptations
On the verge of triumph the poet hesitates and fades
Too much emotions cling to tragic lullabies
I feel the dark
I deny existence
I bathe in blood
That flows from me
Fear of deceptions for fear is alive
Unable to live but able to die
Abandoned so early whilst love was aroused
No meaning to live to watch my heart pound
I cry for God but I'm ignored
And desperately cry to engrave my thoughts
They have all gone but left you here
I love you still and ever will
My fate drew me to burial
The life I lived mistaken one
My pleads for death gone into me
In death's embrace I'll dance with thee
An acclaimed deception had no reason to live
Had he willingly chosen to believe in his will
The empty feeling would have passed by his eyes
For another to witness this final demise
So close to him she lay...
She fell to her knees
I could not hear her heart beat
My tears mixed with her blood
And nothing more was heard <start> backtrack  think about where you were.

Bless me bless my devotion by your grandeur father 
Burn me burn me into pleasures of pain and flesh 
Sanctify sanctify my being through wrath by my health
each night i hear the voice of my father...
he oblige me to sate my bestial instinct
I kidnap weak chicks for my perverted pleasures my lair is the corridor to

I sew their eyes open wide then they cannot close them anymore then they
could see the face of
death... MINE 
They're alive when i break their weak bones when my clock slash their

WAITING FOR YOU  <start> Gore hog brings death
Tusks... Soaked with warm blood...
Immense pig of doom...
Snout basted with gore.
Tusks disembowel...
Entrails pulled out
Blood encrusts it's hair
Ribcage lungs intestines fly through the air.
The gore hog shall come
To lay waste it will crush you
Into a pulpy paste
It's jaws smash your head
Scarfing down your brains
Smothering snout in your denise
It defecates on your remains
Gore hog brings death...
Hamhocks from hell... <start> My eyes slowly close
The light shimmers away
It's the beginning of the journey
Myriads of roads for my sins to pave
The lust has fled into my dreams
As a wayward storm
It's the dawn of a new night
Will it pass without harm
The road runs like a river beneath my feet
Although I am not moving an inch
Only the thoughts They dance like the tides
A red looking glass unfolds fragments of life
And how I became your willing wife
The ghosts of my future all answered red
The moment the ring was on my finger
And when you found me in an other man's bed
Did they foretell you about my knight
When the key turned my chastity
Or was it my life destined to be dead
Far away battles
beneath a cloak of red satin
The yearning of lust
a smouldering fire
All can be dealt with if I only wake up
The night drops over the shire
The ghosts of my past
are carved in my sight
Wolves howl to the blue moon
Did I deserve this past year
A lone and longing fresh bride
Taking comfort with willing men
When you were gone
Was it your life or death I feared
Do they know the end of my dreams is near
Enforced by the hand of a bearded knight
An answer to the sins of the bed
A short thrust the dreams fade away
The knife on the floor has turned deep red
In the light of the dawn this day <start> My heart has never been enough
Breathing just barely gets me by
For a time the consequences
Of being human won't be undone by human hands
I turn my head and see it all falling apart
But you're still here unphased by me
I'm holding on I'm holding on to you
I move my eyes from fixation on a fallen world
I'm holding onto you unphased by me
These walls fall down around me but I will stand
And though my body be burned away
I will live life <start> Sweet scent colored these
The realm of sweet snakes that tortured me.
If everlasting burdens should enter
Such as the everlasting torment of hell.
Sweet rape honor these
The souls of sweet snakes that denoured me.
If glorious destruction would embalm
Such as the moments caressed by enlightened ones.
Even the earth can't grant us a common grave. <start> So much fear in me
The future that I will nevernever see
Happiness is wastedfor ever
Here so lonely at the mountain top
Is all this for a better tomorrow
The shouting the running alienated personalities
Feel like an idiot to myself
So depressedso depressed
The enginesound so deafening
Above our heads like a God
In desperate moments I runI run for myself
Hide beneath my shadow
Snakes in my hands in my red eyes
As it fires its lightening away
My gun no longer protects medid it ever I wonder
So depressed so depressed
Its better this way
Not to thinknot to think again
Why should Ishould I live for
Fight again in someone elses war
The light brings pain but heals my scars
My skin is rebecoming in a new state of life
Sorrow is behind in the noise of a neverland
Beneath my shadow nothing exist
Nothing exist <start> In which the darkness masks the mask.
Christine
I close my eyes and wonder Where is this man
Who spoke so true with passion felt through centuries
When I was alone this voice washed my fears away
These sounds from the dark that vanish in the light of day.
What I feel and what I see is not the same
Deep within your voice swings more than one world's pain
Eric
Look into my eyes  for they belonged to him
And if you listen well you can hear him sing through me.
In dreams I hold you close my dreams are always near.
May worlds split us apart at night I'll always hear
The sounds that turned in me the plea for death to harmony

You'll find yourself attracted by the Glimpse of Fury deep inside
In ev'ry Moment to ev'ry Direction  the perfect Angle sends his Light

Chorus 
Dreams and Visions of Trees in the Wideness pass my Mind
like a Storm of Desire in the fires gratified
Feel the Breeze on your Skin  to release from Sin
See before your Eyes the Oasis arise
The febrile Impressions are sent from the Past  showing Cities of Sand filled by ancient Hordes in the Names of Their's
Time goes by and the Sea takes it's Children  back home to the Pale
no Signs left for the Future  impenetrable Trail
Chorus 
With the Dawn getting closer the Lights fall  the Silence's last Shout
goes out into the Wide where the Night comes  one last prance of Fright Future plans with no Chance of Fulfilment  discarding a Life
while this Sea shows no Mercy the Hordes arrive
Chorus 
Ancient Riders of Sand in the Wideness pass my Eye
Closing in on the Trail of all wishes and Desires
See them ride like the Wind  to fulfill your Please
They're taking you home to the Pale of the Seas <start> There is a war inside your head
You're losing the battle against yourself
So awake the unholy spirit of your soul
Destroy your inner fears and go...
My hands of doom will lead the way
A fistful of hate is not enough
Your vicious pain is all you've got
My hands of doom will lead the way
My hands of doom will take you to the grave
My hands of doom will take you there
Just face it life is Hell
So welcome death to end your misery
Just face it life is Hell
So welcome death...
My hands of doom will lead the way
I am the demon inside you who won't come out
I am your unknown conscious tearing you apart
My hands of doom will lead the way
My hands of doom will take you to the grave
My hands of doom will take you there
Just face it life is Hell
So welcome death to end your misery
Just face it life is Hell
So welcome death...
Your soul possessed by me
I rule your mind
You're trapped inside yourself
My hands of doom will lead the way <start> Omen of evil strikes

There was a whore called Mary
I penetrated by my Spear of Sodom

Spears of Sodom  in the night
Spears of Sodom  Spears of boundless fright

The hallowed arms of those
Whom death hath struck down
Warriors from the beyond
In ranks both seen and unseen
Of this the desolation
Our enigmatic destiny
Consecration
Marching off to war
Iron blood and blasphemy
The unvanquished storm
The war bringer unyielding
Wield the greedy weapons
Girded for battle
Under victorious banner
Ever more total
Ever more occult
Breaking the deafening silence
My voice
Lightning hammer of gods
Uphold Avenge Arise
Blessed and bold ascension
Like the firebearing star
Through thousands of ordeals
We are the sons of vengeance
Cast them down
Your cowardly impious eyes
Our gate alone evokes
A spell of destruction
Our storm our war <start> Vor mir liegt ein Stck Papier
Mein ganzes Leben steht darauf in ein paar Worten
Den ganzen Tag hab ich daran geschrieben
Doch allzuviel ist nicht daraus geworden...
Das letzte Tageslicht flieht aus meinem Zimmer
Nur Einsamkeit erfllt den Raum
Ich liebe die Dunkelheit
Denn im Dunkeln sieht man nicht
Die Trnen  auf dem Gesicht...
Ich znde eine Kerze an
Und schlie die Augen
Vor mir seh ich dein Gesicht
Der Mund steht offen als wollt' er etwas sagen
Doch keine Silbe weht zu mir heran
Ich sah dein Blut
Und wute die Zeit mit dir ist nun vorbei
Ich sah dein Blut
Wie es tropfte wie es flo
Ein warmer Regen der sich ber mich ergo
Und als dein Leib aufbrach 
Und als die Wunden kamen 
Sah  ich  dein  Blut...
Vor mir liegt ein nackter Leib
Sein ganzes Blut hat er her fr mich gegeben
Den ganzen Tag hab ich ihn gejagt
Doch am Ende gab er mir sein Leben
Das erste Tageslicht bricht herein ins Zimmer
Und Helligkeit erfllt den Raum
Ich hasse den neuen Tag
Denn man sieht im Sonnenlicht
Dein Blut  auf dem Gesicht
Ich lsch das Kerzenlicht
Und schliee deine Augen
Lchelnd kss' ich deine Lippen
Dein Mund steht offen als wollt' er etwas sagen
Doch keine Silbe weht zu mir heran 
NIE MEHR
Ich trank dein Blut
Und wute die Zeit mit dir ist nun vorbei
Ich trank dein Blut
Wie es tropfte wie es flo
Ein warmer Regen der sich in mein Maul ergo
Und als dein Leib aufbrach
Und als die Wunden kamen 
Trank  ich  dein  Blut... <start> Your faith is gone all hopes are lost
Now all your dreams lie broken on the ground
Now no more fears you've cried out all your tears
and the days pass before your eyes
chorus
From the Shores of Death a ship will come
Born of Chaos born of Ancient Night
Forever to sail to reek havoc and destruction
Never to be pacified forever to fight
Fate has turned a man of peace
into a warrior thus taking his own life
Your body may have been your own
but your soul belongs to them
Your blood mixing with the water
chorus
guitar solo
Don't hope for mercy
For them there is no tragedy in Death
Staring at Death with bone dry eyes
Your fallen prey floating on the water
Until the rain will come down
to purify the evil you left behind
chorus <start> My tongue has grown heavy with the things I cannot say
Lost in this world of blue black and grey I've tasted hell as it came for me
Should I live or die I can't decide contemplating my life as I think about the end
Should I take it all away from myself saving me from all this pain and decit
My heart will fall from the sky and shatter on the ground
shards of blood will pour out into this letter
Should I live or die I can't decide contemplating my life should I end it all myself
Taking it all away from me and save myself from this bitterness and pain
My heart will fall from the sky and shatter on the ground
shards of blood will pour out into this letter
that I leave behind telling the reasons why I chose
To hide hide in death wrap myself up in this darkness and cold
There's no turning back holding your breath waving goodbye
There's no turning back holding your breath waving goodbye again <start> M.R. James be born be born

The evil dust in the air.

Has to sleep because of the fog
And thinks of his new director.

Ooh for the longest time I thought I would find a way
Through the binary reflection of the sunshine through the maze
Sha la la la la la its a crazy world
Its just a chemical reaction
Like a whirlwind in reverse.
If there's one thing that I'm scared of its the truth.
If I knew it could I use it
Ih if I lacked the proof
Cos a good time is a hard time in a short time
And the seed to a puzzle made of metal
For the chains that I made for me
Oooh for the longest time I saw a bridge to the great divide
But the space time complications really complicate my mind

Its just a chemical reaction like a whirlwind in reverse
Sha la la la la la its a crazy world like a whirlpool in reverse in reverse.

We've done our deeds but now we have to pay
The social call the presidents not home
The gossip line we never would have known
I awoke to the sound of singing in the streets x
The sorrow fell like the setting sun
On dusty streets the sound of running in our heads
As we hung like leaves from the trees
Shooting from the hip we live our lives so precariously
Breathing deeply for the last time I can see
The lights shining just for me...
Built to last
This winters going to end
The sun will shine on our faces
Life begins...
Swing low Sweet chariot
Carry me home x
Ride till sunset leave it all behind x
and go
Cowboys never die x
Built to last
This winters going to end
The sun will shine on our faces
Life begins...
When life ends life begins x

He fights for recognition
Desperate tries only
Increasing the pressure
Falls blind unseen forever

The children of tomorrow
Forced out of a life of their own
We are the sinners of these days
And only bringers of sorrow
We're only bringers of sorrow
Unforgivable sin
Temptation too big
Unforgivable sin
Temptation too big
Unforgivable sin
Unforgivable...
Wounds inflicted a bloodstained soul
Distinct marks of violence
Skin fragments under nails
And a God forsaken fate
No holy water can save him now
A false prophet a deceiving smile
Arms open  here's trust to find
A man of God a temptation too big
Unforgivable sin
No holy water can save him now
And no prayers can cleanse the lust
He used abused  he raped the trust
The innocence of a life is lost <start> Out beyond the reconpoint
Battle weary nerves now frayed
One step closer to oblivion
Abandoned life the price to pay
The final sacrifice  ushered to the grave
There is no time to run or hide
No chance to pray
Mankind's legacy  past knowledge saved
Glory not given  respect is made
Stranded in no mans land
Water always tastes the same
Trapped within this shell hole
There is no shelter from the steel rain
Dead men again
Still unchallenged
Forging on
No respite
Until this war is won
Relentless barrage never ceasing
Artillery has found its range
Caught within the crossfire
There is no shelter from the steel rain
Dead men again
Whitehot shrapnel fills the sky
Advancing ever onwards
Conditioned reflex feel no pain
At the point beyond insane
There is no shelter from the steel rain
There is no shelter from the steel rain
Dead men again <start> Scores upon scores what vengeance is right
Where did all this shit originate
Spiral of endless unlawful death
Wildfire of hatred barbaric vice
Fighting for their own oppression absolute allegiance
Unrestrained killing without cause
Wanton psychopathic action rabid empty conscience
Indelible never satisfied
Paranoia offensive escalation pointless bloodshed
Hopelessly consumed mobs of irate radicals fanatical devotion
Brute force worn out know nothing else their life is Hell
Death gives them purpose
Vacant sense of their own worth unsanctioned war destruction
Misdirected anger reactionary homicide
Retaliation adolescent grasp of culpability bringing others misery
Taking out their fury on someone else
Cold blooded prejudice slaughtering innocents
Death is all that matters trade their life for mass murder
Poised to inflict mass suffering and pain
Genocide prophesied condoned by the word
Misperceiving truth inducements to explosive violence
Decimation is their sole intention
Suicidal terrorists keep squandering their lives
Meaningless sacrifice another generation
To serve a vengeful incarnation dying for a useless cause
Constant aggressors born antagonists permanent ignorance
Decades behind they steal technology immoral misuse
Paranoia escalation pointless bloodshed no horror spared
Cheap vain murder know nothing else brute force worn out
A world of shit short sighted spiritual poverty
Desperate search to fill a hollow void
Lying in wait for a weakness exploiting any vulnerability
Children who'll die while they're young stupid more wasted life
Monstrous desensitized dictator orders them to die
Violent assault presuming salvation awaits beyond
No hope for their future they war unto their end
Dysfunction poisoned ignorance reigns
The cycle protects it's own momentum impedes it's change
Corrupted young minds die old minds alike succumb
Totalitarian seduction it's a fucking lie <start> One of Viviathans
We are no evil don't fear.
We have the truth you must hear.
We've created your world.
Like in tales you have heard.
When everything was still fine.
In the course of our time.
We created the sword.
And four stones gave the force.
That force was the key.
To bring life everywhere we could see.
We are those real spirits you know.
And those voices in altar were wrong.
We helped you survive years ago.
We gave you the power so strong.
Your land is the youngest from our creation.
The best of this whole generation.
It's the shelter to all those four powers.
The haven from the darkest souls.
Then something went wrong.
We made land very strong.
All they wanted was death.
Till the end of last breath.
When someone's using the force
Darkness will find it's source
Evil knows where you are
Where they come it's not far
That force was the key.
Bring life everywhere we could see.
We are those real spirits you know.
And those voices in altar were wrong.
We helped you to survive years ago.
We gave you the power so strong. <start> Music HertrichWinkler
Lyrics Hertrich
Under love's heavy burden do I sink
Can I go forward when my heart is here 
I cannot be here here and there
there and here for You and I
are past our dancing days
I like the lightning
which does cease to be
ere one can say I see
Beauty too rich for use
for earth too dear
Did my heart love 'till now 
I forswear 
Regions near me seemed all alone
My mutual cry she never heard again
Now sadness is beloved and love we gain
Alike bewitched by charm of looks
Night sable Goddess
from Your ebon throne
Every eye is fixed on You alone
I thank You Moon for showing me the way
Trip away make me stay meet me all
by break of day
You made mine eyes and merry tears
O grimlooked night the way you fear 
Full many flowers born to blush unseen
And waste their sweetness now
share their last gleam
Trip away make me stay
meet me all by break of day 
Heavenhell shadowdancer
heatened blood makes holy hands unclean
Mine eyes look sad
the grimlooked night away
stare around the sphere
to blush unseen  Your tears
When You turn away
Leave me out of the end
Turn Your insane out
Leave me if You will
Away from light steals forth my soul
I want give cure as know
But love's a smoke with fume of sighs
So swallow down and rise autumn rise  <start> You bastards
Redeem me now that I have lost
Now what have I gained from this
This is a curse for me
Still I long to be set free
The self is set on fire
Out comes the exit
Like a serpent sun
The flames break loose
Release me now that doom is here
I will never settle for anything less
Than the truth in this great divide
The self is set on fire
Out comes the exit
Like a serpent sun
The flames break loose
Eruptions of red leave scars upon the scars
Vultures circle overhead starving to pick the bones we leave
In this wasteland I lie deathless in the sand
Redeemed to form evil once again
O heroic deliver me let me outlive this
In the wake of collisions
This is our time to rise through adversity
In the wake of collisions
Deploy me now that hope remain
Now that we filled once again
This fate comes easy for me again
O heroic deliver me let me outlive this
In the wake of collisions
This is our time to rise through adversity
In the wake of collisions
You bastard
Eruptions of red
Now desolation comes as my paradise
This is my time to rise
Upon the tyrant throne
You bastard.
Desolation
You ride the answer you make me tell
Eruptions of red
You reap <start> All bonds that God ties
Man is master to tear apart
All crop on God's made land
Man is master to sow and reap
All deaths worms die
Man is master to engineer
And the bliss of freedom glimmers like gold
Empty the cast melt the mold
The worms of God
We've torn away Your spear God
This is sacrament to show it
It's the bread of liberation
And the wine of celebration
In the gloom of gluttony lust takes its toll
Its hold is stronger than of the Gods of old
The worms of God <start> A slumber did my spirit seal
I had no human fears
She seemed a thing that could not feel
The touch of earthly years.
No motion has she now no force
She neither hears nor sees
Rolled round in earth's diurnal course
with rocks and stones and trees. <start> Intro
I base my life like a raging flame of events that seem all to much the same
And I'm aware of my behavior
Have I realized that I'm my own savior
Verse 
I'm losing much of my mind
I'm wasting all of my time
I'm almost over the edge
Please push me off this hell edge
And I'm aware of the things
I knew that exist in my head
Meditate revelate
I say a prayer by my bed
Chorus 
Tapping Tapping Tapping
Verse 
I sailed across the seas
For soul identity
The only soul I found
Protect my feet from the ground
And I'm aware of the things
I know exist in my head
Meditate revelate
I say a prayer by my bed
Repeat Chorus 
Chorus 
Look in your mind  Tapping
See what I find  Tapping
When it is true  Tapping
When I see you  Tapping
Verse 
I ran away from my fears
I will not cry any tears
You might see that I'm right
That dream might be in sight
Now we all need something
To help us through thick and thin
Now get up now get out
That's what I've been doin'
Repeat Chorus  <start> As I'm writing these lines
We're starting to breathe
Having the chance to spread the word
Seems a natural release
Difficult to resist
The moment of pleasure
Than doesn't exist
Temptation is leading to the abyss
Addicted to the sweet deadly kiss
Mortal remains wallow in additional bloodstain
Mortal remains hopeless life goes down to drain
Mortal remains evil spiritual domain
Mortal remains
Remains
The chance to intimate
Will diminish my pain
Intellectual update
Will show if I'm not insane
Slaughtering my dreams
Nothing is like it seems
Suicide pride
Vague thoughts can't decide
Termenting your soul
No hope on parole
Death wish fates life
Victory of the inner strife <start> I'm not strong enough to stay away
I Can't run from you
I'd just run back to you
Like a moth I'm drawn into your flame
You say my name but it's not the same
You look in my eyes
I'm stripped of my pride
And my soul surrenders
And you bring my heart to its knees
And it's killing me when you're away
And I wanna leave
And I wanna stay
And I'm so confused
So hard to choose between the pleasure and the pain
And I know it's wrong
And I know it's right
And even if I tried to win the fight
My heart would overrule my mind
And I'm not strong enough to stay away
I'm not strong enough to stay away
What can I do
I would die without you
In your presence my heart knows no shame
I'm not to blame
'Cause you bring my heart to its knees
And it's killing me when you're away
And I wanna leave
And I wanna stay
And I'm so confused
So hard to choose between the pleasure and the pain
And I know it's wrong
And I know it's right
And even if I tried to win the fight
My heart would overrule my mind
And I'm not strong enough to stay away
There's nothing I can do
My heart is chained to you
And I can't get free
Look what this love has done to me
'Cause it's killing me when you're away
And I wanna leave
And I wanna stay
And I'm so confused
So hard to choose between the pleasure and the pain
And I know it's wrong
And I know it's right
And even if I tried to win the fight
My heart would overrule my mind
And I'm not strong enough to stay away <start> Januar Sturmflut in Hawaii

As the candle sputters out
Just beyond the abb and flow

Facing the demons
In this hell

I will not let this moment
Define who I am
Now you see me
Now you don't
I am strong eternal
Now you see me

Licking the wounds now
I shelter in the melody
My ink runs from black to red
Screaming into the void
Alone again
Facing the demons

Define who I am

Hear the thunder see the lightning
Feel the rain comes poring down
Hear my heart beat see my anger
Feel the force that strikes you down
You've betrayed me for the last time
Now you must pay for your sins
Kneel before me say you're sorry
Close your eyes and feel the pain
I am trapped again
Inside the storm
We can fly away to the unknown
If you're cold ill keep you warm
You are safe inside the storm
See the moonlight hear the voices
You can hear them calling you
Cannot answer life is fading
There is nothing you can do
Someone's crying someone's trying
To keep the life in you
Now you're sorry but it's too late
This is the end for you
You are safe inside
You will join the ride
You are safe inside the storm <start> I lay Enshrined
Contaminated Time Warp
My Flesh Yearns
For the Tombworld
My soul like layers of Frost
Simulating a Spectre Shadow
Frozen in Time and Space
I was Hacked out of Ice
Faded am I behind a wall of consciousness
Still feeling a different World
Surrounding Me
Chilling Voices fill my head 
I Open My Eyes
The Boiling Sea Beneath
The Castle of Faust
Belial finally Comes Forth
The Ancient White light writings
were just lying men and their Pens
You are the same only in Black.
Return with the knowledge
of making your own god
Dreamking of the Tombworld
I Enter Into an Eternal Oath
Creating my Paragon Belial <start> When contrary winds blow across the sands
Their murmurs can be easily swayed
But when storms quicken one cannot placate
The howling of their murderous rages
Winged seraphim hold love's trembling hand
Beside our waiting graves
As war roars about our precious land
Seeking cause to subjugate
Tonight in flames
Tonight the world will fear our names
Tonight in flames
Stay my feeble hearth
Our deaths will be the start
Of something glorious and vain
Tonight in flames
There is no fanaticism as virile as faith
To the blind his words are clear
Suffer not the infidelSuffer not the infidel
Assure your place in paradise here
Winged seraphim hold love's trembling hand
Beside our waiting graves
I will avenge her do or damned
Her sacred mother did the same
Tonight in flames
Tonight the world will fear our names
Tonight in flames
Stay my feeble hearth
Our deaths will be the start
Of something glorious and vain
Tonight in flames
I went to see her dance one day
In play by a wailing wall
Now she is gone
But the song lives on
Zealous and maniacal
The Eastern sword must fall
Winged seraphim hold love's trembling hand
Beside our waiting graves
As war roars about our precious land
Seeking cause to subjugate
Tonight in flames
Tonight the world will fear our names
Tonight in flames
Stay my feeble hearth
Our deaths will be the start
Of something glorious and vain
Tonight in flames <start> These eyes I see don't even remind me of me.
I want to put the knife in and make you dirty on the inside.
I want to see you crawl on your hands and knees.
Beg for me.
My fate rests in the arms of hell.
I bought the dead and now they've come to collect.
By darkness enslaved with the heart strings of sorrow.
I sold my soul and solemn darkness fills the hole.
Part of me sleeps and part of me dreams.
A mouth full of rumors hands full of daggers in a room full of mirrors no god no savior.
My own indifference is what separates me from the pain.
Razor blade victims breaking the skin just to pour the hate back in.
Just to pour the hate back in.
I want to see you crawl on your hands and knees beg for me.
Beg for me.
These eyes I see don't even remind me of me.
I want to put the knife in and make you dirty on the inside.
I want to see you crawl on your hands and knees.
Beg for me.
Pushing the needle through the stitching has began to wear.
Only I can tell you when this sickness will end.
My fate rests in the arms of hell.
I bought the dead and now they've come to collect.
By darkness enslaved with the heart strings of sorrow.
I sold my soul and solemn darkness fills the hole.
Part of me sleeps and part of me dreams.
A mouth full of rumors hands full of daggers in a room full of mirrors no god no savior.
I want to see you crawl on your hands and knees.
I want to see you crawl on your hands and knees beg for me. <start> Achtes Kapitel
Ein Mdchen im grnen Prinzessinnenkleid hockt barfu auf einem wackligen Stuhl vor einer staubigen Jammertruhe die sich in der Sudelei all der schlampigen Toten in ein furchtbares Werkel verwandeln lie. Um den Hals trgt das Kind eine Melodika geschnallt in ihren Mundwinkeln hngt eine alte Kindertrompete. Aus den gesumten doch lchrigen Taschen luchsen verschiedene Plastikpfeifchen und trten hervor. Die Figur des Mdchens im Prinzessinnenkleid versteht sich als merkwrdige Mischung aus verletzlicher Kindfrau morbider Musikclown und kindlicher Chansonstar und ist somit erst Gast und dann Bewohner jen' sterbender Gegend. Vom Teufel geritten klimpert das Mdchen auf den angesuerten Tasten dieses Wimmerkastenpianos und starrt in die Leere der durchwegs stickigen Sumpflandschaft. Zur selben Zeit kauert Kezman des Teufels General in einer Furche vor dem Ringelspielgau und dreht an Urians Kurbel. Er holt das Kind zu den Toten.
EINLEITUNG
Das Mdchen summt und summt klimpert und klimpert.
DER TOTMACHER 
Komm komm mein Kind des Teufels Wind entfrbt deinen salzlosen Leib.

Es trnkt sein Kleid in die moderige Luch und stirbt ohne Zank und Gelach

WERKELMANN 
So klein ist der Tod wenn er's Kindlein entdeckt
wenn er schaukelt sein bitteres Boot.
Du mein Fratz gehorsames Kind
tauchst ein in diesen Tmpel.
Dein Kleid es nsst dich blass und fahl und drr und klebt an dir  wie der Tod

II. <start> Situated in the present alive in the
Moment of now separated from
Attachment
 gone but not forgotten what is meant
To be inevitably will be destiny a force
Rather than an outcome of events
My point of change is on the horizon
What brought it together now took it
Away
Chapters open chapters close
Opportunities rise and fall like an
Everlasting circle
My memory still plays the events
Affection is a state of mind.
My mind is altered.
Emptiness is eventually filled
The universe unfolds
 things shall be as they are.
Although I often deviate I always return
To me.
Many paths are marked for us <start> Catered to undo
Mistakes you have made with you
The lessons catch up with you
As I lay awake in bed at night
The thoughts of life
Pass left and right
They appear on my sensory screen
Mistakes in route are quite expected
My existing plan is well protected
I light the bulb that soothes my brain
For not to learn is not to gain
Tarnished are the thoughts
That have been told
Wise men give me nothing real to hold
The writings of the past
Are paper thin
If I seek the truth
I'll look within
Boundaries never hold
They just cater to feelings of self control
In time you'll break through
An abundance of knowledge
Is there for you
The rise and the fall
Protruding action
The thrill of it all
My fortress when I pass
My retribution my afterclass
Sunlight Moonlight
Can you feel the warmth
Of past lives
Naked stars that come out at night
To make an effervescent dent in my time
Realize conceptualize
Prepare yourself for life's Retribution <start> An Island lies in the sea of stars
So far from time
The wisemen came foretelling my heart
I'll reach for the sun
Deep inside my eyes you see the tears of long ago
Telling tales of loneliness before
Standing by my side you feel the fears of once before
Telling tales of emptiness and more
Strangers in the night
Rising up to fight
They're rising up to bust the demon's spell
Freedom Call the cry of barren souls
The surveillance of mankind will fall
Freedom Call the cry of barren souls
Under surveillance we never will fall
I spent all my life to get salvation from afar
I've seen stairs arisen from below
Strangers in the night
Rising up to fight
They're rising up to bust the demon's spell
Once upon a time our world was in decline
On a storytellers night I felt the breeze of life
And I saw the rays of light across the burning sky
When the master sent the sign reflecting all devine <start> See the people walking down the street
Fall in line just watching all their feet
They don't know where they wanna go
But they're walking in time
They got the beat

Yeah
They got the beat
See the kids just getting out of school
They can't wait to hang out and be cool
Hang around 'til quarter after twelve
That's when they fall in line
Kids got the beat
They got the beat
They got the beat
Yeah
Kids got the beat
Gogo music really makes us dance
Do the pony puts us in a trance
Do the watusi just give us a chance
That's when we fall in line

If someone explains his intentions
Criticising is what you good
At already formed your opinion
Don't bother to understand
That people have different ideas
About the way they live their lives
Despising greed and enviousness
The standards you live up to
Are purely based on hatred
Towards other cultures and races
Mankind would be better off without you
Without you
From ignorance to oblivion <start> they're watching your face
a face shining with excitement

And nothing in between
No nothing in between

No nothing in between yeah
Come take this sacrifice <start> I was late and I missed the first path of my own play
But I'll thought I'll stay and try to find out
What it was about with those things I did not get so far
As seen yet
What I found out was sobering but not really surprising
Curtain was rising
Myself performing one supervising his own performance
Not recognizing
Is this one play is this one song
What is my part do I do wrong
One change was got to come along
I will find out what must be done
See nobody who is around
Walkon parts are thin on the ground
That is beyond me it is rough
I faced the truth and that's enough <start> I felt you slip away
Far away from me
Further from me
You seem to drift far away
I caught myself wishing you back as i fight to catch you
Anger wells inside me
I see me frowning in your eyes

I see my reflection and the pain scripted across my face set in stone
Anger wells inside of me
I see me frowning in your eyes
Far away from me
Further from me
You seem to drift far away
I caught myself wishing you back as i strive for you

I put the fear in you where no one should ever be
Nothing to me
Everything to you
Nothing to me
Everything to you. <start> To see a wormhole in your eyes fall to earth
And plague my heavens black
With fear I kiss the burning darkness
Forever burn
Leave not only me
But for every thought I think
Forever burn <start> I'm falling from the sky
I want to glue wings of screams
Touch the clouds full of water
Once the world falls down
Which I'm retreating from
And moisten chapped lips
Of thirsty people
The clouds shatter an echo
And cool my body
They mirror the power
Of sky in themselves
Celestial vortex of rolling greats
Circles in a circle waiting.
Lake of thousand crystal drops
Maybe waiting for the pride
And then comes the fall
The entire celestial crystal
Will break into thousands of fragments
And these will smash my face <start> Keep one eye open
And the second one closed
Till the distance seems no longer
And the sunset's back for more
Leaving your remains
Of things just so insane
They deceive and hunt your dreams
They deceive from dusk till dawn
Lights out
and you will see who I'm supposed to be
when I'm dreaming dreaming my wasted mind away
Keep your feet on the ground
And hear that sound
Cause the distance ain't no longer
and the story's back for more
I've got a onetrack mind
Since I fuck up all the time
A dj vu of you and I
The same just one more time
Lights out
and you will see who I'm supposed to be
when I'm dreaming dreaming my wasted mind away
Lights out
and you will see who I'm supposed to be
when I'm dreaming dreaming my wasted mind away
Lights out and you will see who I'm supposed to be 
Lights out
and you will see who I'm supposed to be
when I'm dreaming dreaming my wasted mind away
Lights out
and you will see who I'm supposed to be
when I'm dreaming dreaming my wasted mind away
Lights out
Lights out
nd you see me for
Lights out
Lights out
and you see me for dead <start> Sad voices they're calling
Our precious girl she can't be gone
How bitter this morning
When daddy's darling
Went out and started her day
Wasn't there a dream last night
Like a spring never ending
Still the water runs clear
Through my mind
On the field I can see a fiddler
The fiddler on the green and the sad boy
I took him too early
Would you mind
Would you mind
Would you mind
If I take you
To be with you
To be with you
To be with you
To be with you
The sun seemed bright
The air was clear
The air was clear
A trick of light
Turned red into green
She saw the light
Her face was pale
Her body smashed
Her beauty's gone
Isn't it a shame
The reaper said
He is quite alone here
And still waiting for you
Oh I really did fail for the first time
Spoke the fiddler poor old fiddler
The fiddler on the green
The fiddler on the green
It would be nice
Take my hand
Just hold my hand
I'll take you there
Your pain will go away <start> Written  composed by Phil Wilde  Kate Ryan
Visions about you bring tears to my eyes
All that surrounds you were secrets and lies
You were my strength you were my dream
We were a perfect team
Our love was stronger than the winds of time
Could hold you longer till the day I die... goodbye
Goodbye
The love songs I wrote I cannot sing them anymore
This is all your fault 'cause you walked out the door
You were my strength  You were my dream
Love hurts when it's not what it seems <start> Extermination thunder the strange one is
Back again
Lost by our only power it's aura will grind us
Out forever
Fall into a dark dream that we got once
The part it's real you won't believe
We're watching our own agony many years ago
Seven little children stand against the ghost
Believing is the answer but you've lost before
Find back to your infancy it's time to die
I've been the herdsman you've been my sheep
I find taste on lampskin everything's alright
Killing for the thirst for small children sweat
I give them illusions to raise their fear
Hear the crying dying child it's music to my ears
Feel the sweetness of it's death everything's alright
But there's a new feeling I've never known
There must be a third one a mighty guardian
Guardian Guardian Guardian of the Blind
Now it feel the curse of heaven
Guardian Guardian Guardian of the Blind
Now it feel the curse of the child
Dark is it's world. and lonely we're reaching it
Again
Fear our returning visions to madness we'll
Fall
If we can't kill the beast forever
We must die now
One has blown his life away
Once we were a circle fighting hand in hand
Our weapons were illusions to let it feel the pain
By the sweet taste of our live it call us back again
We'll find the answer it's time to die
By a ritual we've hurt it but we've not kill
Little Billy you must find your way
Believe in you we ask for
But where
We can never find
There must be a sign for the
Guardian of the Blind
Guardian Guardian Guardian of the Blind
Now it feel the curse of heaven
Guardian Guardian Guardian of the Blind
Now it feel the curse
Come to it's world following the sign
Guardian Guardian Guardian of the Blind
Give us the help we're waiting for your sign
Guardian Guardian Guardian of the Blind <start> In pursuit of Clarividence to live is to sleep
To die is to awake in the twilight of the fears
Those countless melodies of hate
In the oceans of fresh sadness
The sound of the other side
Is the mirror of my grave's face
But I have pride and force
My heart is the fire of hope
The anger will make me Immortal
For me to die is to awake
Ecstasy in the nocturnal winds
Light and visions of grey faces
Vortex of innocence and desire
No beauty nor happiness
Vortex of innocence and desire...
Show me the memories Honoris lux infinitus
I want to be forsaken under my forgotten lands
Hear the whispers of the moon
Forever my will is strong and my hate is everlasting
My bride is the majesty she comes in the
Honoris lux infinitus...
Light and visions of grey faces
No beauty nor happiness... <start> sitting by the candles
before the mirror of my inspiration
I look at my mirror's picture
so who am I if there stays a mind of an
inexhaustible mistery with me
so dance faster with the wind of your shadow
so chase faster in the rain of storm feelings
drive the chariots of slassy clouds
looking for the silver groves
and for me the scream of forgotten rain
where only remains to me to go by the thorns
by the bridges of the past
so I give seven golden fires
so I give seven golden keys
seven golden fires
seven golden keys <start> we dwell in purity content with the nurture of our native land beneath a sea of abundance stabbed by the oppressors blade we are awakened in torment a silence slashed by tyranny's hostile face provoke they must the righteous sons invading our dwelling restrain us and yield we shall not and we shall strike at the throats of our oppressors possessed by the serpents vengance hold us down and you shall know your wrath coiled around the earth the fury that dwells within strike at their fear your venom courses it veins with your poisonous rage revenge destroy their kingdoms pulsing through seas of a blind age appear in their dreams to spit away as a hellish crusade suppression condemnation probing with your morality bore us not with your profanity for those who rose shall strike with the serpents vengance <start> bonus track

Summons the king of fear
Forces of Agharthi arise and come forth
Behold by the Sumerian tears
At the abbey of darkness where NanZi dwells
Awaiting the stormy sea
Shreds of flesh chained to walls
To greet the master of realms
I am the bringer of seed I will bring eternity
I am what this world needs I am chaos breed
Worships forsaken beyond
The world of Dankar
Manifest of the left hand path

The horrors of the grapes of wrath
The dawn of the blackest sun of all skies

Ancient arts of process of pain
No longer concealed <start> My word will set this world aflame.
Hail me
War war war
The earth trembles beneath the allconquering
Cloven hooves of the black horde for a thousand years
The horde has been denied the throne.
And the wings were taken from our lord
He was cast down into the netherworld forever.
But now it's time for us to reclaim his realm.
And bring this world into eternal darkness.
 lord of the east gather your bewinged legions of
The wind and prepare to defend our lord above the ground.
 lord of the south spread your infernal flames across
The land and gather your strength to fight for the throne.
Oh tyrannous master bring hellish storm upon the celestial
Kingdom set the vault of heave into flames
War
Set the legions free open wide your gates let them strike the
Earth with your wrathful hate let me see your majestic kingdom.
Rise before my eyes the abode of the damned
Let the weak be hurled into your eternal fire.
To perish forever more.
Listen to me infernal legions oh mighty hordes of nightflying
Demons throughout the darkness thou shallt ride join my warlords
And fight the war with pride.
 lord of the west command your apocalyptic wave to
Break through the barrier of the weak.
 lord of the north make the earth strong for our legions and
Do not deny them to tread forbidden land. <start> A paralyzed mind embracing decay
Dead like carrion just wasting away
There is nothing
Numbed by excess and complete saturation
Scarred influence by degeneration
There is nothing
There is nothing to believe
All has been lost
All have lost their way
Every eye has been disgraced
Dead like carrion
We must carry on
There is nothing
Lost innocence and blank revelations
Searching for a hope in static transmissions
There is nothing
There is nothing to believe
All has been lost
All have lost their way
Every eye has been disgraced
There is no reason for empty vision
All has been lost
All have lost their way

Spit on God may His lies be forgotten
The son of the mourning a gift to our earth
Christ stands tall no more so bestow your force upon us
Gaze into the wall of these restless souls
Eternally lost in fear of your Godforsaken son
You have tasted suffering that dove of life has died
Paralyzed and terrorized by the fear you feel inside
Caught within the floods of blood evil departed sea
Immortal but now it's like to forever bleed
We saw the truth and it's the draining of the blood o
O your false redeemer
The mourning son has now control so what if it's evil <start> Yeah
Go
You're fucking crazy if you think that I'll ever change
I am mine I am me I'll never change my ways
I must've a route to escape
Conduct a predetermined damnation for eternity
Damnation for eternity
I don't want you to cry I don't even want you to care
Don't you dare pray for me no
There's things I bury inside to keep away from the light
Don't you dare pray for me

And I can't keep my head up on my own
Holy fuck why do I bother
Never gonna keep anything
I wanted to fall down the crack
I don't give a fuck if I die today
Holy shit I've lost my mind
Reality is starting to unwind
Don't pray for me
I don't want you to cry I don't even want you to care
Don't you dare pray for me no
There's things I bury inside to keep away from the light
Don't you dare pray for me

Don't care about humanity

Over the weak ones they gather like flies

And I feel sorry for all the things I've done
You tore me apart this time and there we were against eachother
Little words became argues your blood were no longer iniside
Who will help you when I cannot help myself Careless of what could happen
And when the anger took over there were no turning back
My soul has spoken a part of me just died
And I feel sorry for the things I've done
My heart is broken a part of me have died
And I feel sorry for all the things I've done
You were no longer alive why didn't we take it with words
What would I tell your nearest
You know accidents accure
I don't think so I guess people like me don't belong in a normal life cuz we're too fucking insecure
It hurts to know that you're not with us anymore
I wish I could make it up to you someday somehow
But I'm too afraid to die atleast by suicide
So don't count on me
I guess the gates of hades are better for people like me
I'm such a traitor a dissapointment for humanity
My soul has spoken a part of me just died
And I feel sorry for the things I've done
My heart is broken a part of me have died
And I feel sorry for all the things I've done <start> The world now stands ancient showing her age
Antique senile archaic
Peroration impending not one to assuage
The human remnants of earth
Pandemic winds chill the soul
Eradication of the will
Nihilism extracts its toll
Frightening the meekly servile
Sacrosanct the religious ones
Are fast becoming extinct
Chaotic precursors of what will befall
Permeate the night air
The fear of the end preys on the minds
Of all the soontobe dead
With death at the hands of a hideous fiend
A grisly fate to comprehend
Chorus
Death
This city is guilty
The crime is life
The sentence is death
Darkness Descends
fire
Internal combustion platonic rage
The bodies create their own hell
The flame from within unleashed from its cage
Purging the great sins of all
Admissions of guilt are all that are sought
By judges who have twisted laws
The quick abrogation of the populace
Striking with great enmity
Listing the ways in which we will die
As the prophets claim we will soon
Selfimmolation that's unjustified
Stygian shores ahead loom
The coffins are ready the death warrant signed
Depression has swiftly set in
Inimical powers against humankind
This charnelhouse ensanguined
Mortis
Decaying the ruins fall swift to the ground
The carnage is morbid and great
Mephitic death stench of corpses abound
The earth meets an untimely fate
The horrific malignance spreading its wings
Across the expanse of the sky
Contamination and all that it brings
The judges commit genocide
Retaliation a useless ploy
We've gazed into the face of fear
We know that it stands for our own bitter end
The end we realize is now here
The claws of denouement grasp at our lungs
Asphyxiation rules supreme
The future of mankind cut down while they're young
Our children die clutching their dreams <start> Golden Tears
Form from my eyes
The blast of sand on my face
Marks the beginning of my punishment.
But now it is too late to regret.
Wandering the labyrinth of tears
Scaling the pyramids of despair
The gods have now decided my fate
I have to go through the seven lands of sin.
The breath of air
Gets heavier and heavier.
My body and soul
Are torn apart in turn.
Beholding the infernal ballet
Of the roaring elements
I'm left facing my fate
Like a helpless slave.
Wandering the labyrinth of tears
Scaling the pyramids of despair
The gods have now decided my fate
I have to go through the seven lands of sin.
Encounter with the Wind God
I yearn for conquest and blood
Once again I become a warrior
I shall not put up
With this sanction without rising up
Only blood will tell pure or tainted
Whose decision will go unheeded.
The chaotic power of steel
Has just marked its boundary.
I fall overwhelmed with pain
Evil shall never prevail again.
Eternal Downfall
My agony shall linger
I beg for no mercy
the six remaining lands of sin
That's where I'll wander
Bound with rage and dignity. <start> No one hears you
No one fears you
You are invisible nothing trace of belief
You're going blind dazzeled by
The beauty of the day
Your footsteps slowly disappear release your soul
This is a diart the diart of an addict
It's just a diary only written words
Help me get me out of here
Your own mind leads you to this
Just remembering where you are
Beneath the cold and senseless no trace of belief
Help me get me out of here
Your throat swells your eyes glow
Deep inside you swallow the blood
Hit the darkness feel the cold release your soul
Hel me get me out of here
This is a diary the diary of an addict
It's just a diary only written words. <start> My wounds are growing deeper
As blood flows to the ground
I know it is over
But it still hurts...
I've lost my energy
Of being still alive
With every cut into my veins
I'm coming closer...
This seems to be my passion
Once again with a broken heart
There is no way back
Not for me and not for you
It's always the same for me
But where is my fault
What have I done to this world
That it has to be this way <start> I know of a tavern not far from here
Where you can get some mighty fine beer
The company's true and the wenches are pretty
It's the greatest damn place in the whole of the city
If you're looking for crewmates you'll sure find 'em there
Cutthroats and lowlifes and worse I should dare
Ol' Nancy don't care who comes to her inn
It's a den of debauchery violence and sin
So come take a drink and drown your sorrows
And all of our fears will be gone till tomorrow
We'll have no regrets and live for the day
In Nancy's harbor cafe
So come take a drink and drown your sorrows
And all of our fears will be gone till tomorrow
We'll have no regrets and live for the day
In Nancy's harbor cafe
If you're looking to go on a glorious quest
There's a man there who knows of an old treasure chest
For some pieces of eight and a tankard of ale
He'll show you the map and tell you it's tale
And then there's Nancy the lovely barmaiden
She may be old but her beauty ain't fading
Ol' Nancy don't care who comes to her inn
It's a den of debauchery violence and sin
So come take a drink and drown your sorrows
And all of our fears will be gone till tomorrow
We'll have no regrets and live for the day
In Nancy's harbor cafe
So come take a drink and drown your sorrows
And all of our fears will be gone till tomorrow
We'll have no regrets and live for the day
In Nancy's harbor cafe
So come take a drink and drown your sorrows
And all of our fears will be gone till tomorrow
We'll have no regrets and live for the day
In Nancy's harbor cafe
So come take a drink and drown your sorrows
And all of our fears will be gone till tomorrow
We'll have no regrets and live for the day
In Nancy's harbor cafe <start> some day world war three will rage
and produce total global annihilation.
it will be the end of the age
and for great many lives the termination.
fire comes down from above
the elements melt in the heat
the heavens disappear with a roar.
atomic holocaust  final war.
the flesh of the wicked rot
while they are standing on their feet
their eyes rot in their sockets
stench of burnies meat.
glaring lightning flashs tear
the darkness of the nuclear night.
mighty explosions erase the life work of mankind.
gigantic shock waves level towns with the ground.
mortal fallout covers everything
and brings the final death.
the sun is darkened
the moon loses its light.
the stars fall from sky
and it is pitch dark night.
complete destruction  brutal mutilation.
complete destruction  total annihilation.
that day will be darkness
and come like a thief.
everywhere there will be destress.
so stay strong and believe
stay strong and believe
believe in jesus and have no fear
because your redemption draws near.
behold i am coming soon
my reward is with me
and i will give to everyone
according to what he has done
turn to jesus  trust in the holy son 
believe in jesus and have no fear
because your redemption draws near.
be alert satan will deceive many people.
be prepared for in the hour unknown
jesus christ will return
to throw into the lake of fire
all what is evil.
to redeem the rightous and to kill the devil.
turn to jesus  trust in the holy son 
believe in the word of christ
and you will survive.
stand firm until the end
and live the eternal life

revelation   <start> Poem by Jonas Deroueche
How extravagant my shadow
In october five times my height
Hence my silhouette's grandeur
A reflection of lost glory
Splendid seed sowed in spring
In november harvested wine of sorrow
The sap contaminated lifeblood forever
Bliss my souls' inmost growth <start> Is there someone in your life
On whom you can depend
Who will never sell you out
Betray you as a friend
Everybody needs someone sure someone true
Everybody needs a solid rock I know I do
Who'd die to set you free
Is there someone in your life
You trust and never doubt
Thta when you're cryin' out in need
He'd come to help you out
Everybody needs someone sure someone true
Everybody needs a solid rock I know I do
Who'd die to set you free
Is there someone in your life
Who'd give up their all to be
A friend who'd never let you down
Who'd die to set you free
Everybody needs someone sure someone true
Everybody needs a solid rock I know I do <start> Dei nostri templum terrarum orbus est. <start> Music and Lyrics by Marco KehrenDEINONYCHUS
Mothers orteria uterina a foreseen tomb.
Agony awaits me.
With my eyelids closed a darkened vault welcomes me.
A torturous garden unfolded to the end of time.
I have learn to walk it until I have grown immemorial.
Chained in this body I'm gasping for air.
All that I'm breathing now is the malodour of poisoned...disheartenment.
The nails in my heart an invitation of pain.
It will make me fall apart like a puzzle beyond repair <start> I hear the voice of an old friend
He calls to me
When I am subdued
Loud as day I hear this voice
Call to me in distress
What to do I feel the presence of another
As I walk through
The house where he once lived
He means no harm
Comes to me when confused
Helps to relieve doubt
Lead me through ups and downs
I call him a friend
My one true friend
Always there to help
Me through my darkness
What to do I feel the presence
Nothing nothing nothing nothing <start> The world is slowly caving in
as my darkness grows within
These walls are sanctuary for me
I know that others would rather die
They will not let me be alone
and for them I gave my soul
And somehow I feel I am reborn
I've been reborn
I've paid the price for my own mistakes
But am I born into a fate I can't change
This pain of life that never seems to end
And I wonder why
There's something not quite right in me
I ask why the world was so cruel to me
And just like the darkness surrounds my soul
I wake to the feeling I've been here before
You ask me why I have faith in God
And became my own worst fear
You live in a world where no one seems to care
Let me take you there
There's something not quite right in me
I ask why the world was so cruel to me
And just like the darkness surrounds my soul
I wake to the feeling I've been here before
Am I living this life once more
This pain of life that never seems to end
I can't change what's become of me
I can only wish for what might have been
I pray for the day I finally die
Until then I will wonder why
There's something not quite right in me
I ask why the world was so cruel to me
And just like the darkness surrounds my soul
I wake to the feeling I've been here before
There's something not quite right in me
I ask why the world was so cruel to me
And just like the darkness surrounds my soul
I wake to the feeling I've been reborn
I have been reborn <start> The color yellow suits you best
Parade around like you own the world
I know who you are
I've seen you before
Never forget two faces like that
You mock me for the stance I take
As your breath tries to suffocate me
You're not as strong as you think you are
You can't even play your own game right
You might have knocked me down before
But it's not me that gets back up again
You want me so bad
You can taste it on your lips
The closer I get the harder you try
I smell the fear on you every time you strike
Try and bury me alive
But I don't belong to you
I cannot be shaken  my faith is not blind
But steadfast in truth
There's strength in numbers and I have three
What can you do against One that conquered death
No reach with what you have
You think you're in control try and keep your cool
The pressure is on to gain the upper hand
Didn't you know try it before and lose
Didn't you know try it before and lose
Didn't you know try it before and lose
Didn't you know
One can only do playing God
It's time to put you in your place
You're not God
He is
One can only do playing God
It's time to put you in your place
You're not God
He is <start> There are signs on the ring
Which make me feel so down
There's one to enslave all rings
To find them all in time
And drive them into darkness
Forever they'll be bound
Three for the Kings
Of the elves high in light
Nine to the mortal
Which cry
Slow down and I sail on the river
Slow down and I walk to the hill
And there's no way out
Mordor
Dark land under Sauron's spell
Threatened a long time
Threatened a long time
Seven rings to the gnomes
In their halls made of stone
Into the valley
I feel down
One ring for the dark lord's hand
Sitting on his throne
In the land so dark
Where I've to go
Slow down and I sail on the river
Slow down and I walk to the hill
Lord of the rings <start> Instumental <start> Truly they lie they talk utter nonsense
Who say that music reckon that the kantele
Was fashioned by a god
Out of a great pike's shoulders
From a waterdog's hooked bones
It was made from the grief
Molded from sorrow
Its belly out of hard days
Its soundboard from endless woes
Its strings gathered from torments
And its pegs from other ills
So it will not play will not rejoice at all
Music will not play to please
Give off the right sort of joy
For it was fashioned from cares
Molded from sorrow <start> Who in the night
With wet sight
Doesn't think that it's rougher
His hard life
I mean strife
Load that we suffer
Life
Divine blow
Life
More than we know
I feel immersed
In the clockwork of the universe
Deep metaphor
In which I'm the very core
But I realize
With sunrise
That are shades all my sorrows
In this wheel
I can feel
There're much tomorrows
Life
It's what we're
Life
Valley of tears
Like a gift
One descends when you're lift
It's like a whim of the eternity
It's a kiss
Within your bliss
Has every color you see <start> See the sun you left
dawning into the black sea into me
In my heart this painful sea
a sea of spite all that is inside
set me free
For evermore bathing in your might
Flowing down my own streams of pityness
Can anyone save me from myself
Somebody hear me somebody heal me
If you feel in your heart
You will know that my pride is all I have
If you look in this heart
you will know all that's left is but disgrace
I must be all forgiven
For I know not my sins
Do not wear this weary veil around you
to drag yourself down
For you are my own self nothing else
but the true tempter <start> So there you were
Alone with those ablazing eyes
Like an angel brought to life
You have my destiny.
I'm free You are my Saviour
I'm free You are my guiding soul
All I need is you
Is You
I tried to fight 
For so many years I've tried
You bought me back to life
Changed my world guided me
I'm free You are my Saviour
I'm free You are my guiding soul
All I need is you
I am free..
I'm free You are  my Saviour 
I'm free You are  my guiding soul
All I need  is you

The merchant workday is an imperial offering. Greenwich MeanTime is an imperial sanction. The looming weight uniformly imposed as albatross and as anchor. The new timeimperialists will get their way with those left the rural the feral the frail. Feed them a thread that leads to a string. They'll follow the string until it leads to a rope and from that rope every vestige of what was will be hung by the neck. <start> In an age crucified by the nails of faith
When rank scarecrows of christ blighted lands
An aloof Countess born an obsidian wraith
Dared the abyss knowing well She was damned
Her life whispered grief like a funeral march
Twisted and yearning obsessed an entranced
With those succumbing to cruelty
Crushed 'neath the gait of Her dance
A whirlwind of fire that swept through the briers
Of sweet rose Her thickets of black thorn had grasped...
She demanded the Heavens and forever to glean
The elixir of Youth from the pure
Whilst Her lesbian fantasies
Reamed to extremes
O'er decades unleashed
Came for blood's silken cure
But Her reign ended swiftly
For Dark Gods dreamt too deep
To heed Her pleas
When Her gaolers were assailed
With condemnations from a priest
Who'd stammered rites
In the dead of night
For maidens staining winding sheets
And She postured proud
When Her crimes were trowelled
And jezebelled to peasant lips
Though She smelt the fires
That licked limbs higher
To the tortured cunts of accomplices
So ends this twisted fable's worth
And though spared the pyre's bite
By dint of nobled bloodlined birth
Her sins crimes garnered Her no respite
Forever severed from the thrill of coming night
Where slow Death alone could grant Her flight
The Spirits have all but fled judgement
I rot alone insane
Where the forest whispers puce laments for me
From amidst the pine and wreathed wolfsbane
Beyond these walls wherein condemned
To the gloom of an austere tomb
I pace with feral madness sent
Through the pale beams of a guiltless moon
Who bereft of necrologies thus
Commands creation over the earth
Whilst I resign my lips to death
A slow cold kiss that chides rebirth
Though one last wish is bequathed by fate
My beauty shalt wilt unseen
Save for twin black eyes that shalt come to take
My soul to peace or Hell for company
My soul to Hell for company <start> multi billion dollar corporate

all the lines

living on comfort

will we believe the hype
they feed
fully
endorsed
by heartless greed
awaken sleeping proletariat
who holds the key
to public outcry
and a change in public policy
we must believe that this can happen
if we strive to be
more conscious of effort
to be free
we must build a better life
if our children can survive <start> Lost inside emotion searching for myself
came across a memory of me as someone else
Didn't recognize me Didn't know what to do
in another lifetime I could have been you
Blood Brother look into the rising sun
Blood Brother two lives become as one
Distant generations I smoke to peace with you
regression to a past time and place we both knew
Didn't recognize me Didn't know what to do
in another lifetime I could have been you
Blood Brother look into the rising sun
Blood Brother two lives become as one
Blood Brother look into the rising sun
Blood Brother two lives become as one <start> Certain age
Move aside
Where are your questions
Running running in circles
Get out of the way
I'm not your window
Fall off
Deceased
Don't be afraid
Tell me all
I' m searching for what is wrong
What we see
Is what we desire
Can't you see I need a savior
What we see
Is what we desire
Can't you see I need a savior
I need a place of mine
We got our lives between
It's right or wrong
But we lost
I will climb this mountain
To fight you

To fight you
If I'm running
You'll run too <start> House of Shame.
Welcome to the House of Shame.
Blood's burning to play my game now.
Racks are roasting. Bitches are boasting.
With your blood they are toasting.
Humiliation is your dream.
We'll make you laugh then scream.
Your body's itchin' for a switchin'...
In my torture kitchen
Pain  You can't take it another day.
But you ain't leaving you're here to stay.
A precious moment without the pain
breeds only longing in your brain.
You will... I need... It's your fucking time to bleed.
You will obey everything I say.
You will remain while I'm dishing out your pain.
Your will is to blame in the House of Shame.
Pain... In a world with no autonomy.
Branded slave racked and hanging only function is pissing and hanging.
Forced entry breeds with a heart full of self confidence.
But who's to blame for your desire
problem parents or porno flicks
You will... I need... It's your fucking time to bleed.
You will obey everything I say.
You will remain while I'm dishing out your pain.
Your will is to blame in the House of Shame.
Pain  You can't take it another day.
But you ain't leaving you're here to stay.
For a precious moment without the pain
breeds only longing in your brain.
In the House of Shame.
In the house of...

Come on back to the House of Shame.
Your blood's burning to play our game now.
Racks are roasting bitches are boasting.
With your blood they're toasting.
Humiliation is your dream.
We'll make you laugh then scream.
Your body's itchin' for a switchin'...
in my torture kitchen <start> A Broken Glass
A broken glass proves your words worthless
running and hiding from the reality
Until death do you part
do you not know the commitment that you made
One broken heart
two broken lives
and now look
just look what you have become
Your shattered lives are breaking my heart <start> I listen to the whispering waves
The whispering waves of unconditional love
With my feet on earth my head above
The night's an echo of myself
A shadow that will flow forevermore
And I have never felt this way before
Once again the thought of you
Permeates my skin
You're living in my bones now
I cannot calm the voices from within
Once again my heartache rose
From its silent slumber
Autumn leaves they sweep my soul
Too many tears to number
And black rains fall
Emotions rise tonight
No chance to keep them under
Wherever I shall wander  I'm lost
The night it sleeps
Deep in my skin  tonight
No chance to find a reason
The origin of treason
Once again the seeds of sorrow
Can't be cast aside
There is no bright tomorrow
Autumn rides upon this blackened tide
Once again I drink to fall
A portion I must bear
I feel it live and breath inside
Dead leaves turn to ash but I don't care
They turn to ash but I don't care
And black rains fall
Emotions rise tonight
No chance to keep them under
Wherever I shall wander  I'm lost
The night it sleeps
Deep in my skin  tonight
No chance to find a reason
The origin of treason
Eternal darkness  fall from grace
Deep inside I'm hurting with desire
Hopes and dreams will soon be lost in space
They're will be lost in space
And black rains fall
Emotions rise tonight
No chance to keep them under
Wherever I shall wander  I'm lost
The night it sleeps
Deep in my skin  tonight
No chance to find a reason
The origin of treason <start> I dream a dream of heaven island
Where justice smoothly dwells
There I'm not forgotten
on that island
But always kissed and
heartly delt
When morning sun starts
crazy smiling
I'm bored and grieved oh
to the core
That morning keeps me far from
island
For what I'd sacrifice my gore
Almighty heaven  take me there
Heaven  I'll be yours
Almighty heaven  withering
take care
Please let my mind be yours
Possessed by happiness 
that heaven island
Timeless freedom and eternal
grief are their chaos
Pity for the evil lacks it's
bleefing diamond
Future for the friends losing in
that score
I dreamed so much about
heaven island
To dive like a free endevour
for mighty winds caress torn
wings
And take me to the world of
dreams
Almighty heaven  take me there
Heaven  I'll be yours
Almighty heaven  withering
take care
Please let my mind be yours
Possessed by happiness

Timeless freedom and eternal

Feeling ungodly
Searching for the melancholy
Time will tell
What's to come
Tear down the sky
Worship sun
Calling out to some holy host
Exercise my holy ghost
Dream within
Dream on the doubt
Don't ever let the dream die out
What went wrong before
Was I hit this shit looking for loyalty
So air your grievance fuck
Check it out
It's a charmed life
On the chopping block
I'm gonna live until I die
Check it out
It's a charmed life
On the chopping block
You better live until you die
Blood was spilt
Through the words that kill
They're meant for you
So bet it all
War with wolves
A war of words
Meant for you
So bet it all
Calling out to some holy host
Exercise my holy ghost
Dream within
Dream or the doubt
Don't ever let the dream die
What went wrong before
Was I hit this shit looking for loyalty
So air your grievance fuck
Check it out
It's a charmed life
On the chopping block
I'm gonna live until I die
Check it out
It's your charmed life
On the chopping block

Your charmed life so live until you die
Charmed life is on the chopping block
It's a charmed life
I'm gonna live until I die
I got you out of my life
That was the dream
It's your waking reality
I got you out of my life
It's your waking reality
You lose the fame

It's a war with words
Call it like I see it
The stench stains my veins

In those leaden days
That a plain poor man
Got sick of his yoke
Of condemned soil
And foreign empires hungry purse
Time to replace
Pitchfork with sword
And sound the anthem
Of sheer rebellion
Enough
Once too often
Enough
Is enough
We strive not for war
We just crave to have our home
We just seek to have the rights
That our fathers used to have
We strive not for war
We just crave to have our home
We just seek to have the rights
That our fathers used to have
We tasted grime and blood
We know the essence of ashes
A glowing spark
Rising up from blazing flames
To lead the forlorn and wrath
The epitome of hope
A daring venture
A frantic attempt
When Amandus was slain
The Bagundae still sang
We strive not for war
We just crave to have our home
We just seek to have the rights
That our fathers used to have
We strive not for war
We just crave to have our home
We just seek to have the rights
That our fathers used to have
Enough
Once too often
Enough
Is enough
We strive not for war
We just crave to have our home
We just seek to have the rights
That our fathers used to have

We just crave to have our home
We just seek to have the rights

We tasted grime and blood
We know the essence of ashes <start> There is an answer to it all
We must embrace or we will destroy all we are
I was reeling from the news today
Crying out was a world in pain
Here and now it seems somehow we broke the vow
To be our Brother's keeper
This world can be a lonely lonely place
It doesn't have to be your only fate
Same old story for another day
Nothing changing and there's hell to pay
Here and now it seems somehow we broke the vow
To be our Brother's keeper
This world can be a lonely lonely place
It doesn't have to be your only fate
Open up to reveal your spirit face
Forgive forget and live for love's embrace
I am not alone in feeling we've been wrong
Wasting the gifts of our lives
Say that you'll agree it's up to you and me
We hold the key to survive
This world can be a lonely lonely place
It doesn't have to be your only fate
Open up to reveal your spirit face
Forgive forget and live for love's embrace <start> Through all the pain an misery you were supposed to bring us back the smile
We lay screaming in agony for too many years now
Mankind is nothing more than an empty name i closed my brothers eyes tonight.
All your pretty faces hide demons insde
Take me from this hell or take the hell away from me
Like the decaying babylon your empires shall burn and now you cry for freedom
May angels come to save our souls from the lies of this world
Now angels of mercy go find your way through all the decay come and take us away
Up in the skies the storm is raging mankind is now on the gateway to extinction
Through all the pain and misery out in the ruins you seek shelter you will lie screaming in agony until we rip your heart out
An army risen from the graves to regain our place on earth
An alliance with angels of vengeance let the prophecy come true
Now when i hold you cold face to mine i can see that the sun will shine again <start> Close your eyes and leave all your fears behind 
Close your eyes and follow me until the end
So if you're hopeless
We can pick up the pieces
And if you're broken
I can carry the pain
Are you with me
Watching the flames rise high 
Sing this with me
I break down the walls
I want it all
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground
Scream and shout
Till the lights go out
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground
We won't take this
You can't break us
We won't stop until the world is in our hands
I break down the walls
I want it all
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground
Don't let go
We carry our torches high 
Come too far
To throw it all away
So are you with me
Watching the flames rise high 
Sing this with me
I break down the walls
I want it all
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground
Scream and shout
Till the lights go out
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground
We won't take this
You can't break us
We won't stop until the world is in our hands
I break down the walls
I want it all
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground
I like the mess
I watch you fall to the ground
As the embers rise
And the smoke fills the air
I break down the walls
I want it all
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground
Scream and shout
Till the lights go out
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground
We won't take this
You won't break us
We won't stop until the world is in our hands
I break down the walls
I want it all
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground <start> Satan fertile
Woman's egg
Need to cut
Her own skin
Son of Satan
Within womb
Need to cut
Her own skin
With a razor
Spells a word
Within the chest
A single word
Carved in deep
Through the skin
Bleeds the word
Satanic blood <start> Feigning joy and surprise at the gifts we despise over mulled wine with you
On the twentyfifth day of the twelfth month
The sleigh bells are in time ringing true
How we cling each day long to the snowflakes and hope in hell
That it won't end
Don't let the bells end
Christmas time just let them ring in peace
Well the weather is cruel
And the season of Yule lifts the heart but it still hurts
You've got your career spent the best part of last year apart and it still hurts
So that's why I pray each and every Christmas day that it won't end
Don't let the bells end
Christmas time just let them ring in peace
Christmas time don't let the bells end
Christmas time don't let the bells end
Curse underneath the mistletoe leaves when you're not here
You went away upon boxing day
Now how the hell am I gonna make it into the New Year
Christmas time don't let the bells end
Christmas time don't let the bells end
Christmas time don't let the bells end
Christmas time just let them ring in peace
Christmas time don't let the bells end
Christmas time don't let the bells end <start> We're hunting open secrets
We're searching high and low
Intrepid we might be we'll never know
Under a press of canvas
We're on the parting of the ways
We lost the trace
we're gathering life's roses
We're in a quandary
But on the sly we never can't be free
We face the stormy petrel
And beg for wings to fly away
Forever away
chorus
Will all be there
At farpoint anywhere
My visions leading me that far
Could we foresee
Then we would turn the key
Dimensions open who we are
our mascots left us lonely
Inmidst our palisade
This ragged garden shows what we have made
We cut the old alliance
We skipped off from our legacy
How could we
chorus
the field of vision grows
Your pounding heartbeat slows
The space age has begun beyond recall
chorus
chorus <start> Nightfall in thrall
I call her beauty to me
Whose ebonlidded eyes excite
Shadows to wander through me
Whose kiss glittered with sleep
Is a thief come after dark
To steal away the leaden wreaths
From my cemetery heart
Thrilled to see the light
Bruisereddened silhouetting
Murder sites
As dusk attends her son's blood wedding
Spilt across the skies
In reefs of omen
Licking flames and pagan rites
The night awaits with baited thighs
Start this artist darkness
Yearning now to start this
Burning as an artist
Turning on the darkness
Dizzy looking up with pervertigo
A sewer deity of recrement
World below
I'll make you pray
I spy with wicked lips
The cream of mortal kind
Committing their sins
Their penitent skins
To the harems of my mind
Prey
Thrilled to breathe tonight
The sultry air of graces
Passed in flight
Like birds of May with playful faces
Fills me with delight
Their crystal skirts
Spun from stars worn tight
Wink of fists in wishful places
Start this artist darkness
Yearning now to start this
Burning as an artist
Turning on the darkness
Dizzy looking up with pervertigo
A sewer deity of recrement
World below
I'll make you pray
My whims like smoke in summertime
Writhe atop the blooms
Committing their thin
White Catholic limbs
To the cloister in my room
You see I need
To feed my dreams to order
To be agreed
With the beast in me
That bleeds their borders
Prey
Nightfall in thrall
I call her beauty to me
Whose ebonlidded eyes excite
Shadows to wander through me
Whose kiss glittered with sleep
Is a thief come after dark
To steal away the leaden wreaths
From my cemetery heart <start> Slit Me Eyes
Drag Me Through Hell
Face To The Death
Into The Dark
Hold Me Right
I Need To Rise
Let Me Free
Into The Sky
Right Now...
Let Me End Your Suffer
I Can Help You Burn
Let Me End Your Suffer
You Will Die In Vain
Let Me End Your Suffer
I Can Help You Burn
Get Me Eyes Of Your Whore
BLEEDING VAGINA...
Back To 
Slit Me Eyes
Drag Me Through Hell
Face To The Death
Into The Dark
Back To 
Vagina...
Bleeding...
Repeat  times
You Fucking Bitch.. <start> Scream lost in dry salty lake
Crystals of sult glitter
The sand is moist and hot
Like human sight calling for help
Before their boats got on the dry place
Dying vicinity and country
Where human's life lost the sense long time ago
Last scream
If there were any trees
Maybe it'd knock off and return to an oldman mouth
Who's leaving
Perhaps dying just like the lake
Imprints of dead fish in salt you walk on
Surely it burnts with the blood of cracked soles
The scream left lost long time ago
With the last drop
Salty like a tear <start> There is nowhere left to go tomorrow never gets here
to this abandoned ground where I can sleep within
Now the air is dark now the coldness breathes
now you see the sign now you see it reign
when this fire starts to weaken out your soul
the tender bows of innocence is the first to burn
the cold and empty winds will rise and all the goodness is in fear
WALK WITH ME TO PAIN  SUFFOCATION
WALK THROUGH ME WITH ANGER  FRUSTRATION
WALK AROUND ME WITH THE FEAR  ACHE
CAN YOU FEEL IT ARE YOU READY TO BREAK
When the seed is sown you're about to see
that the evil that you fed is nothing else but me
you will beg to be a soulless evil being
do you know my name do you feel the shame
there is nowhere left to hide and the only way is to ride
upon the crucial tide you're stuck with me until you die
There is no where left to go tomorrow never gets here
to this abandoned ground where I can sleep within <start> Stranded alone on a barren island
No food to be found
Point of desperation
Shocking decision on how to survive
Now it's time to break out the knife
First incision the cut is complete
First source of food is one of your feet
Incredible pain as you cauterize the wound
Preparing yourself for a horrible doom
Amputation for your rations
Legs are gone start new gashes
Half of your fingers are now cut away
To live through another agonizing day
Feasting on the rest of your arm
Next the slice goes across your throat <start> child abusing. the sick man. his thoughts.
the criminal perverted act. rapes and kills.
no one heard the cry. no one saw the tears.
no one no one heard...

the scream in a sick world.
full of violence full of perversion.
satan goes around
searching for inhuman machines.
everyone is searching for answeres.
answeres from this world
but satan's influence has come
to manipulate the minds
and no one asks for jesus christ.
that's the problem that's the truth
this will be our death.
break down marriges. divorce. lost children
without support without love hatred growes.

Fading away fading away.
You've been worn

You've been warned for the last time.
Don't it hurt

Honey you're playing with matches.
It's not time to go
It's something in your eyes.
You can't take it slow
It's something in the wine.
You taste like something's wrong.
Darling tell me is something wrong
Turn turn the wheels of horror
You'll hang for what you've done.
I've failed to recognize my hand as part of the problem.
I'll watch you fall from this balcony like a chandelier from the sixth story.
The concrete will stain from the blood which you paint.
A poet you've lived
Now an artist you'll die.
It's not time to go
It's something in your eyes.
You can't take it slow
It's something in the wine.

A dark cold night of autumn breeze
The last leaves fall to the frosty ground
The pale moon gazes through the thick massing clouds
The witches are gathered a hideous coven
In delirious tones they are shouting
Foul mysterious words as they go
Through the gloom and into the fire
A loathsome shape of obscene horror
Squats huge and monstrous upon the ebon throne
Denial of the god above
The stifling air reeks with filth and blasphemy
Faster and faster whirls the witches' lewd dance
Denial of the god above
Shriller and shriller they scream in tongues
And then a wan grey light flickers in the northern sky
Twelve o'clock is the time of night
That the graves are gaping wide
They haste to the orgies of the sabbat
With the infernal sacraments
The rites of the pentagram the dance of Acheron
The sweet and beautiful fantasies of evil
A loathsome shape of obscene horror
Squats huge and monstrous upon the ebon throne
Denial of the god above
The stifling air reeks with filth and blasphemy
Faster and faster whirls the witches' lewd dance
Denial of the god above
Shriller and shriller they scream in tongues
And then a wan grey light flickers in the northern sky
The circle is forever closed within the secrets lie
Together they leave this dimension side by side
Twelve o'clock is the time of night that the graves are gaping wide
They haste to the orgies of the sabbat with the infernal sacraments

Als die winz'gen Wassertropfen auf meiner Haut ich fhl' 
Das Nass des Nebels der schaurig steigt empor
Aus den vertrumten Eb'nen tief im Schwarzwaldmoor.
Noch ruht die Kreatur im Wald verborgen
Von einem dicken Schleier sanft bedeckt.
Es schweigt die Flur es graut der Morgen
Als ein klarer Laut den Tag erweckt
Die Grille zirpt ihr helles Lied
Die Stille stirbt die Ruhe flieht.
Es erwacht das Moor 
Ein neuer Tag ist geboren
Und es kommt mir vor
Manch qulend Drangsal sei verloren.
Die Sonne wirft ihre warmen Strahlen
Durch das Gest uralter Bume.
Die Natur beginnt zu malen
Bilder gleich der schnsten Trume.
Der Nebel wehrt sich
Gegen der Sonne Macht 
Ein Kampf entfacht.
Doch es vermehrt sich
Die gldene Kraft
Die es endlich schafft
Und den Dunst besiegt.
Zum Vorschein kommt die ganze Pracht.
Vgel singen und die Sonne lacht.
Vollkommen beherrscht Seinen Beruf
Der all dies so wunderbar erschuf.
Zarte Spinnweben vom Morgentau benetzt
Sind der Grser Zier
Und gleichen edlen Perlenschnren
Ins lockend Netz sich setzt
So manch' Getier
Das sich liess vom Glanz verfhren.
Verlassen und einsam wirken
Die zierlich gewachs'nen Birken
Die dort draussen auf den Inseln
Alle Blicke auf sich zieh'n.
berwltigt von des Schpfers Pinseln
Staune ich und lobe Ihn.
Ein sanfter Wind trgt die Hitze fort.
Die Zeit verrinnt der Abend ergreift das Wort.
Des Himmels Licht gar glutrot glht.
Es verstummt des Spechtes Hmmern.
Des Tages Blte ist verblht
Und es beginnt zu dmmern.
Die Sonne weicht
Hat bald des Himmels Bett erreicht
Der Tag ist mde und es erwacht
Eine sternenklare Nacht.
Vergessen werd' ich nimmermehr
Die Bilder die ich sah und seh'.
Und als ich endlich heimwrts geh'
Fllt mir der Abschied unendlich schwer.
Doch von den Bildern
Die mich trumen liessen
Noch berauscht ja halb benommen
Nehm' ich mir vor
Bald schon werd' ich wiederkommen
Um zu geniessen
Den Frieden tief im Schwarzwaldmoor. <start> Amidst a swirling din of smoke
And screaming on the battlefield born
Reared on the teat of my dear mother war
Hardened to stone through abuse
Mocked beaten and scorned
A bayonet severed umbilical cord
The wind sings its sad lullaby
Through a blackened and hollow ribcage
I'm to die in battle divine
With the flames as my grave
This realm of inhuman carnage
Where the blood eternally rains
To my brothers who've fallen before me
I will walk with you again
This my demented playground
The horizon is howling ablaze
The skeletal village illuminates the sky
As fire destroys their grains
With glee I rape and torture
My pleasure is inflicting pain
With a vigor unholy I'll fight to my doom
'Til I've vanquished the Christian God's ways
Sure it must be such a different world
To which those on the outside exist
At least I know who loves me here
No delusions all weakness dismissed
This era of inhuman tragedy
To be ushered by my iron hand
The ovens bellowed to crematory highs
To dispose of the Godfearing man
The wind sings its sad lullaby
Through a blackened and hollow ribcage
I'm to die in battle divine
With the flames as my grave
This realm of inhuman carnage
Where the blood eternally rains
To my brothers who've fallen before me
I will walk with you again <start> Separate me from the dead all around
Smashed into the ground
Ecstasy of killing blinded my eyes
I cannot remember the day it has begun
Nor do I know why
Once I learned to kill and fight
For a battle that was in sight
When I'm dreaming
I still hear them marching on
In the darkness
Innocence got ripped
Out of my heart
I washed my hands in the blood of
The man that just have been killed
The beast in me had risen again
Gave death into my hands
Oh ripping shooting burning
That's the way that I got drilled
Menmachine of no remorse.
The killer is deep in me
When I'm dreaming
I still hear them maching on
In the darkness. I start to pray
Let me live let me love again
Let me drop my head  into your lap
Let me live  let me love again
Ease my pain  when I'm home again
Wondering 'bout what a man is able to take
Wondering why I'm still alive
Exodus of humanity already it hast begun
Skulls and bones aroud me
A bloodbath full of lies
Insignia of imperfection branded in every face <start> El mundo tiene a sus pies

another day grows tired and so returns me to this place
lights extinguished  now all is still  i can feel you start to breath
closed eyes send you back to me
and you will never leave again
the torture of this ritual is staining me
but with fervor i reach out and draw you in
with the hope that you may release me
with no regrets
and no remorse
the loss is imminent
but the gain was great
these things are mine for now and always
and i would follow you anywhere
and i would take you with me
and when the dreams come
i would follow you anywhere
when the dreams come
i would take you with me
don't you know
that i would follow you...
anywhere <start> Originally performed by Iron Maiden
From the coast of gold across the seven seas
I'm travellin' on far and wide
But now it seems I'm just a stranger to myself
And all the things I sometimes do
it isn't me but someone else
I close my eyes and think of home
Another city goes by in the night
Ain't it funny how it is
you never miss it 'til it's gone away
And my heart is lying there
and will be 'til my dying day
So understand
Don't waste your time always searching
for those wasted years
Face up... make your stand
And realise you're living in the golden years <start> All perched alone he sits there broken
An eldered man with storm clouds setting in his eyes
He counts the sands of time remembering day's gone by
It seemed like yesterday before it washed away
Hey don't wait for me there
Just find your own way
Hey don't wait for me there
'Cause I'll be there soon enough
The widow's life ticks out like clockwork
A thousand tears she's cried a hundred time's before
But now that he is gone she's ready to move on
It all just fell away it seems like yesterday
Hey don't wait for me there
Just find your own way
Hey don't wait for me there
'Cause I'll be there soon enough
I'll be there soon enough <start> Proving your heterosexual credentials <start> Tasting the scent of obscurity
While adoring the wisdom unseen
Extract most fiendish emotions
From beyond the irrational world
Inhumanity caused by frenzied reactions
Shroud from visions of inhuman perfection
Evoking the tide of insurrection
The wake disturbed by sulphurous dimensions
Absorbing mental energy
Transforming it into an inner sanctity
Caressing an entity
Raving divinity
Hollow shell destructive spell
Denied by this mortal hell
Six feet under cenotaph crushed
Casted back to the wasteland where you fell <start> Lost in this limbo
I'm here in wait
suspended in ages
waiting my time
hopes failures delusions
and pain
passes by my side
as crystalized blazes
As a stone
my long condition
this wait
I'm loosing in
just covering me
my emotions my memories
Lost in the ages
My soul
infests my last places
My cry
Lost and
forgotten by graves
my name was
but I have no past
My screams
Lost in the ages
My soul
infests my last places
My cry
Why  Why  <start> Blood trails running down the stairs
I chase the wounded one and pull her back by the hair
Why I do not know how this became my life
My eyes are shut and still I know where to ram my knife
Bits of her tongue stuffed down her throat
Keeps her from screaming as I ram her head with a hammer
Crushed skull open blood smeared face
My laughter roar as I crush her teeth
Scream shattered silence throat slit corpse
I kill again and ive killed before
Watching her bleed to death
Lick my hands and spit out her nipples
Oh my dark dream master this was my triple
Mystery or not death is real
Blood dripping knife
I know the secret how to end a life
Scream shattered silence throat slit corpse
I killed again and I've killed before
Fragmented memory of the bloody act
Blood shut eyes staring at me as I end her life
She watches me cut stab slit and strife
Yet another victim end a pathetic life
Mamas baby daughter screams
Mourning her dead mother
So I pick up the hammer
And kill her like the others
I lay myself down to sleep
This must be a dream
But every time I open my eyes
Another one screams <start> The weekend comes I'm gonna see my baby.
I close the door and leave everything behind
I hit the road the sun is shining down so brightly
Five more miles and I'm lying in her arms.
Now her motions turn me on and I'm gonna sing my song.
Free time is one of the things that I love
Free time is one of the things I enjoy.
The sun goes down we're gonna see a movie.
How happy life could be without any work.
There ain't no doubt we're gonna have a party.
'Til Monday morning no one can disturb. <start> Sometimes my mind fluctuates from love to hate.
Cause' I love all ya'll it's this world I hate. this is
My fate. it's something I just can't control.
Cemeteries feeling more like home than where I roam.
If you could patch this hole that's inside my soul I think
I'd take a shot at growing old. hell no don't speak.
I know I'm weak I wanna leave.
Fseek the world.
Take. take it away. every moment. every day.
Not a thing you say can take away my pain.
Away.
The pain inside makes you afraid of who you see.
Who you've grown to be. on your knees you pray.
Pray for the will to take this all away.
I sit beneath grey skies close my eyes. cry.
Watch my world pass by. who am I
Second thoughts cross my mind am I still gonna try
Will the world move on who's left behind
Here's some advice you've been a pussy your whole damn life.
Don't turn back now. don't think twice. you want sympathy
You gotta pay the price. you want sympathy baby pay the price. <start> Your life is nothing but a shadow of your lies come on rip off your disguise and realize.
That you always have to push forward.
That you always gotta push forward.
Perfect sinful disease sickness it eats us.
Always progress never reject.
Scars are here to show me what's next.
This is a war this is a fight that I may sleep when I lay tonight.
Where will it be
Struggle to see all that is left in store for me.
Let us forget where we were at and all that is holding us back.
Holding us back.
And everytime I turned away from you and everytime your faithfulness proved true
Evil days keep plaguing my whole life but this time I think I'm feady for the fight.
I think I'm ready for this life I know I'm ready for the fight. <start> Save me from myself I call out
But no one hears my plea
Burn my candle fast from both ends
Nightmares grow from dreams
You don't know
You can't see through my eyes
So you don't know me
You don't know
What's going through my mind
But can you help me
Save me from myself
If you ever really cared
Save me from myself
Tell me you're not scared
Intensity that grows within me
Reflections of my pain
I'll create or I'll destroy
But either way it's always in my veins
You don't know
You can't see through my eyes
So you don't know me
You don't know
What's going through my mind
But can you help me
Save me from myself
If you ever really cared
Save me from myself
Tell me you're not scared
Save me from myself
If you ever really cared
Save me from myself
Tell me you're not scared
Save me from myself
If you ever really cared
Save me from myself
Tell me you're not scared
Save me from me
Save me from me
Save me from me
Save me from me
Save me from me
Save me
Save me
Save me from me <start> Morning rise hear the crow this the last all things shall know
Asgard will fall reduced to ash cities crumble none shall pass
Trembling earth starts the trend now the final days end
Ragnarok we will see ragnarok this will be
Touch of ice begin to show
Unyielding cold winters breath
As harsh as three but only one destroys the rest
Gods awake the time has come
All to war all the same
Destiny no escape none to blame
Break the bonds loki's rise lead the march the gods demise
Ships set sail meant to be of dead men's nails upon the sea
Undead shall hear legions deep the masters call they will meet
Ragnarok we will see ragnarok this will be
Touch of ice begin to show
Unyielding cold winters breath
As harsh as three but only one destroys the rest
Gods awake the time has come
All to war all the same
Destiny no escape none to blame
Surt no longer waits alone deep beneath his fiery home
Fell the fire searing heat
Burn the world
Underneath the ocean depths rising up with the rest
Spew the serpents poison over
Land and sea
Heimdall guardian and watcher of the bi frost
Shreds of hope are all but lost
Hear the great horn blow
Gods take up your weapons ride unto the heavens
Now the once blue sky
Shall burn in flames
Watch the earth sink beneath untimely death under the sea
No wind shall blow no water runs just to feel the blackened sun
All that's left nothing nothing is everything
Ragnarok we will see ragnarok this will be
Touch of ice begin to show
Unyielding cold winters breath
As harsh as three but only one destroys the rest
Gods awake the time has come
All to war all the same
Destiny no escape none to blame <start> Time only wasted. This is my belief. Days all like twins all the same.
What can I do to bring life back to me
Searching my soul and I see. Will this always be
This is the way I'm walking through life and on every day
I sure don't know if there could be any way that different  but how could it be
When will I know  what this will bring me
When will I see  why can't you tell me
When will I know I can't believe that this is the way it should be.
How will this end  I can see what is wrong
Shadows are passing all over.
In my disguise it shows to my eyes.
How can I take any more when I'm knowing what it's for.
This is the way walking in life it won't be the same.
Could this be over now This is the day.
Step by step it can't go on. <start> ... And he was hanging long
For this season much too long
He would have hung even longer
But he was cut off the rope
It was where everybody
Used to hang them selves
Oh yes my disappointed boy
It was not a lucky year
... And she turned on the gas
With her little trembling hands
And since she was quite petite
Inside the oven she did creep
I knew there's something wrong
She did not answer the phone
Oh yeah my little girl
I should have come earlier then
You really broke me down
The next will never come
I won't tell you see you around
The next year will never come...
... And she shot him in the face
She was really sensitive
She could not put up whit it
When away swinging her hips
I had not expected it
And as always I could say
Had I only been three babe
You could be impeccable <start> Leaning against the wall of rain
Peace of Mind
Lost in a hurricane
Trying to see right through myself
Trying to see through somebody else
Maybe if I close my eyes real tight
Maybe I'll forget and sleep at night
Please don't let me cry another tear
The memories are what I fear
Is it clear
The mistake should of left me for you
Can you see the point it causes so much misery
When our lives are so complete
And the time you took away
The things you made me day
I still remember that day
Everything is easy to forget
Buried in my mind the day we met
Trying to see through somebody else
Maybe if I close my eyes real tight
Maybe I'll forget and sleep at night
Please don't let me cry another tear
The memories are what I fear
Is it clear
The mistake should of left me for you
Can you see the point it causes so much misery
When our lives are so complete
And the time you took away
The things you made me day
I still remember that day <start> Memory apart after opening
Feel nothing The dream is gone
Spinning in a mind overflow
Dream what reality cannot
Ever make you understand
A vision to bring back the sense of the world
Deranged senses
Become defenses
These are the visions I don't want to keep
The mind tortures itself constantly without meaning
Painless
Means out of me
Every trace
Burn the skin
Sow the heart with salt
All thought gone
Painless
Means out of me
Every trace
Burn the skin
Sow the heart with salt
All thought gone
Numb is peace
Numb is peace
This is the dawn in which the prey take courage and turns on the predator
it is the dawn in which the underdog finds the strength to rebel
nothing disoriented them mighty more than the attack of those how have always feared
them in the past.
Can't allow
One to be
What we cannot
We'd hurt somehow
They saw your dreams
Which means they saw your fear
Which means that they must disappear
Hold the matches
Scared is tough
When you're numb
The fear's enough
When you're tired
Sleep forever
We have work now
These are the visions I don't want to keep
Painless
Means out of me
Every trace
Burn the skin
Sow the heart with salt
All thought gone
Painless
Means out of me
Every trace
Burn the skin
Sow the heart with salt
All thought gone
Numb is peace
Numb is peace <start> Deathcover <start> Rotting legacies
Fading loyalties
Effigies for the beasts
Effigies
Distorted hearts

That is so worthless to me
The poor eat the poor
Just like we've done before
Cursed by the burden youth brings
Effigies for the beasts
Effigies you and me
For you and me <start> The field is lost
Everything is lost
The black one has fallen from the sky and the towers in ruins lie
The enemy is within everywhere
And with him the light soon they will be here
Go now my lord while there is time
There are places below
And you know them too
I release thee go
My servant you'll be for all time
As you command
My king
I had a part in everything
Twice I destroyed the light and twice I failed
I left ruin behind me when I returned
But I also carried ruin with me

Moon is lying still
Shadows of the trees
Witnessing the wild breeze
C'mon baby run with me
Let's run
Run with me
Run with me
Run with me
Let's run
The mansion is warm at the top of the hill
Rich are the rooms and the comforts there
Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs
And you won't know a thing 'til you get inside
Until you get inside
Until you get inside

The engine runs on glue and tar
Come on along not goin' very far
To the East to meet the Czar
Run with me

realization of all imaginable
it seems to be eternity
defining all the tragedies
What is time
and its point
Must we know
or is it just irrelevant
The time we rushed through
just a fragment
fragments in pain and love
..the hope for love
You are one part of my aeon
I am a mark in your aeon
Together we are all
Together we wont fall
All came so quick
as quick as it stopped
to fast to recognize
to slow to forget
... And I saw your face
Lacrimas
Fundaments of mourning
Telling more than a single word
An expression
Like a chapter of the book of know ledge
Just one drop of tears
lets my heart nescience disappear
I see more than you want me to see
I see more than I wanted to see
Lacrimas
The book of truth
Lacrimas
An elysian fruit
A mirror to see your innerface
Reflections on your skin
building up a story
making me worry
I cannot restrain
Situation turns
Feelings change
Life alters
Just you forever <start> Verse
I've been waiting so long
To see the moon rising by your side
How many days since you're gone
I've cried so many times
But I've spent so many hours to hide
The tears I had in my mind
Bridge
When will I see you again
Give me a last chance to make
Love with you forever and ever again
I miss you
Chorus
I can't feel pain anymore
I'm just lost in a world of sorrow
But I will wait the hour
To set your heart on fire
Verse
Mountains of ice i will cross
Fountains of gold I will find
To give you some presents
As precious as you
In endlessly I will shout
Your name in the silence of night
To exorcise my thoughts as a prayer
Bridge
When will I see you again
Give me a last chance to make
Love with you forever and ever again
I love you
Chorus
I can't feel pain anymore
I'm just lost in a world of sorrow
But I will wait the hour
To set your heart on fire <start> 
Continue to just keep the mask on
Before you keep your own word
I'd spend my life on my knees
If you could take this from me
Every time you breathe you bow your head
You're underneath society
Bury me and understand why you bow your head
You're underneath society
Bury me and understand why you bow your head
Bow your head
My own veins as my faith
Smother me and call this a family
This isn't family.

Risk your life in a blink of an eye
Man on men Mortal Kombat
Don't fall you could lose it all
The more brutal the better
The harder to rest
Body clash and to  stay
I've seen it all every show
One thing never cease to amaze
There's a bitch in the pit
A fucking bitch in the pit
There's a bitch in the pit
There's a bitch in the pit
Keep it moving this is no fucking joke
One slip you could get your neck broke.
This is the killer tone where the weak lose
All the fuck I command you to do is
MOVE YOUR ASS MOVE YOUR ASS
See I don't give a fuck she's harder than man
In the chaos song after song
She's not afraid to bleed
She's  remorse me
In the moshpit all night long.
She's in the hotter reaction
She knows what she's doing

Every night every show
There's a bitch in the pit
There's a bitch in the pit
A fucking bitch in the pit
There's a bitch in the pit
There's a bitch in the pit
She came here to party
She's ready to rock
She said let's ride or die
She ain't scared of nothing
She's ready to fight
She said she'll die tonight
She came here to party
She's ready to rock
She said let's ride or die
She ain't scared of nothing

Violent j
Like a fuckin fantastic solar eclipse or comets passing
The lotus is in bloom stopping time never ever lasting
Like a velvet red sunset a cloud formation it takes away your breath
Your frozen in the moment till nothings left much like a northern light show
Tornadoes ripping through a vacant land
There's a lotus in the sand
Pluck it hold it in your hand
Lotus is forever and when it whilts away its eternal root are deep  forever here to stay
Monoxide
I'm all alone again no one to talk to
Nobody wanna be the friend that i want to
I thought you could come through and help but instead you just left me to wither in hell
Now how can i tell the rest that I'm leaving and the cause of death is the season
I change up and i wither away resurrect in the moon when the sun turns grey
When i watch em all turn away there's not a thing i can do except watch it all change
I can listen to the trees speak to the wheat leaves as they fall like soldiers in war
As they form a pile right in from of my eyes
All praise to god for these other four
Chorus x
We rejuvenate we again resurrect
We revitalize and we keep coming back
And they say where did it go to

And they say where did it go to

Shaggy
Once again its last curtain call no need to fight it 
The scripture of the brother hood opaque have all been recited
My pollination will float through the air and keep carrying on 
The moon shines this light on us for that i thank god
Now we out with an unquenchable bottomless thist
We goin out in a blaze of glory so call up the hurse
You can pick off all the leafs but yet the roots still remain again with so much to gain flourishing in the black rain
Blaze
This is the end of all things
Reign of all kings
Sun burnt out from within the winter wind
Loss of the sun and the time that it brings
Years pass out without any meaning
Most stay sheltered and hide out from the cold
Lyrics frozen to the ground as the wind blows
Lotus wilts away and it regrows
Those who we chose adhere to the cold
Could never be told and never be sold
Tales of the history lies of the old
We will never be lost and never be gone
Written in the stones of the neverafter mold
Our existence is withering to regenerate reincarnate its only fate they cant hate
But rejoice with the voice of the new world we decide to create...

Everything they live then they die who am I
Just anotha muthafucka has or not
How did it slip by so quickly
Lotus is in the Water so many to chose
And He decided to pick me
Im amazed as Im withered and I spend my last days
Once was in bloom my petals faded away
One by one try ta get em to stay
Till the outcome became deflowered and decayed
Now I need to regenerate everything to die
Fittin to live every second in life its like a gift
Imma take it in the present and spend it the right way
Imma put it to a song they gon sing and play
And when they hear it hopefully they spiritll listen
And they wont spend all of they life just wishin
Stop and restartforgive never forget
And never live any life buried in regret <start> You like to eat assholes with cheese and rice
You like it so much that you eat it mornnoonand night
Only thing to make my life complete
Is if I turn your face into a toilet seat

Yo check it I spit hot fire
I spit it through the wire
I am no liar
Representin Dayton Mother Bitches
Yo yo yo yo yo
My rhymes are hot they burn my lips
I only likes girls with the boney hips
When I eat cheeseburgers some of them be greasy
No one ever told me pimpin was so easy
I don't need you honey
I beat on my meat like it owes me money
Yo Yo Yo Yo Yo Yo
Stateville <start> winds on winter fields
in the smokey sky
wandering storm
storming war
demons' lust in starving lands
the years are filled with lies and tears
no twinkling stars in distant skies
our fear is masked with careless smiles
where are the gods where is their might
nightmares guard our life
they are lost in the midnight air
forever lost
love can't fill their empty lungs with breath
will there be salvation a ray of grace
as soon as grief began it shall end
it shall end
while i stand
it shall end as soon as it began
it shall end
silent fading
it shall end
give us back understanding <start> I bear witness to an unclear reality
I won't wait for the pure satisfaction it's building
Forged to perfection
Tape my eyes open for the oncoming storm
No
I can sense there's still fear in the air
As humanity starts through your flesh
Their skin starts to rot beginning to crack
No one cares anymore
Your false pretenses starting to fade
Burn With your self righteous lies
Oh how all the pitiful will fall
Sister Sister Charlatan no one cares anymore
I no longer admire you
There's no one left to impress
Sister Sister Charlatan
I no longer admire you
The way you burned them all live
Fire in your eyes
I will always remember
How fast the beautiful will fall
Walls come crashing down
It was all just a lie
You were so good at making your mark
And running away
Forge a smile with your second face
Sister Charlatan I no longer admire you
Go
I no longer admire you
The way you burned them all alive
Fire in your eyes
I will always remember
How fast the beautiful will fall
Walls come crashing down
I no longer admire you
Sister Sister Charlatan
I no longer admire you
This is my declaration
Sister Charlatan
I no longer admire you
This is my declaration
Sister Charlatan <start> I don't remember my mama dad sold crack all night.
My life was fucked from the jumpstreet now this kite I write.
Never had half a fuckin chance my whole trial I was broke.
Circumstantial that's bullshit my defense was a joke

Now this cell is my residence my address is The Row.
 hour lock down when they'll kill me who knows
Guilty we the unfree
Dead men walking
Guilty we the unfree
Dead men walking
I'm a genius from books now Never read on the street.
Never lifted a fuckin' weight now my boys concrete.
Filed a hundred appeals or more no response from the state.
Get no phone calls or visits My mentality's hate

I get visits from doctors analyzing the ill.
Families pray for my death now vengeance lays for the kill.

So I think 'bout my past now my future holds only pain.
Involuntarily drugged by the state for years now I know I'm insane.
When I'm moved shackled hands and feet my skin's covered in ink.
I read the bible 'bout twentyfive times now fuck god's how I think

So live your life to the fullest but remember don't trip.
One mistake you're my neighbor and there's no one here rich <start> A breath of darkness
an existance painted in thriving red
a crown of ivy
and she danced...
the branches trying to catch her
with desirous clawing dead love
and she tranced...
morbid tales fill her sarcophagus
...midnight...
a timeless crown on the neverworld duchess
dancing she comes to the storm
slithering from the dark of her soul
to the night of the day
bleeding in games
for tomorrow they come to drown her
too long has she had this reign
and the dukes all present their gallant hands
for this the last drain
a white bedroom lost in thought
of the serpents entwined in yesterdays labyrinth
a semen spell in the cauldron red
starts to bleed a new game
for tomorrow they come to bound her
but this they have always done
and she laughs at their gallant mucus hands
for their night never comes
a white bedroom lost in thought
of the serpents entwined in yesterdays labyrinth
a semen spell in cauldron red
starts to bleed a new game
starts to bleed... <start> The beauty of eternal darkness
Now spreads across this land
Changing our reality
The end of time has come for man
Barren wastelands
With nothing left alive
Withered vegetation
Where no light ever shines
Searing winds have scorched the earth
A new beginning is given birth
The water thickened and painted red
From all of those who have bled...
Cascading rivers of black
Flow with blood from the dead <start> Born into the violence
The cycle begins again
Bred to carry on
A lesson that never ends
Spoonfed propaganda
To the children of the damned
Spreading it like a disease
spreading across the land
CHORUS
Hate intimidate fear
A violent education
Hate intimidate fear
A hopeless generation
Like father like gun
Like father like gun

Marchig in the streets
Preparing another attack
Incendiary devices
Strapped to the back
Justifying their actions
All in the name of a god
But what kind of religion
Condones a killing squad
REPEAT CHORUS
No more sorrow no more pain
Let these children live again
Born into the violence
To the children of the damned
Bred to carry on
Spreading across the land
REPEAT CHORUS
Like father like gun... <start> Get up do what you want
Before before it's too late
Don't don't worry yourself
Of others I don't think
Kick down the door
To hell for more
Severe injections a lethal dose
Kick down the door
To hell with poverty
Clench your fist and shout at them all
Its just a lost cause
Clenched clenched fisted shout
We're souls souls in ignorance
Break break all the windows
Shout deliverance
Break all the doors
Innocent victim
Do what you want <start> Desecrating  with possesed burning eyes
hell has risen  the gods of pain
Pull the veins  tear out the rotted soul
take the last breath  snuff out the life
No resurrection
Massacrate the lord of the weak
Buried blessings
Destroy the remains of Christ
In the burnt out churches
They stand awaiting their doom
Indulge in their blood
Sepulture of hypocrisy
Light of holiness
Forever now extinguished
Endure eternal pain
You foolish ghost of god <start> Bury your fucking dead
Bury your fucking dead
Bury your fucking dead
Bury your fucking dead
Bury your fucking dead
Bury your fucking dead
Bury your fucking dead
Bury your fucking dead
Bury your fucking dead <start> Image like fast spliced line
Covered by the rough knots just like the bark covered
by the brown knags.
In the middle of the dead world left ship stands
With droped sails without the crew.
In the middle of the sea of dry sand stands
Stands without a soul.
It ran away takin' hope
And ship is buried forever
In it's solitude.
Someone pulled its boards down
Sun dryed the planks
Parched as the lips of passionate lovers.
Silence surrounds it with its arms
Bits of stone snatch by a blast
Are strikin' on its empty interior.
Temple of the god
Temple of the dog.
Despair shroud of mourning
Sad irritatin' the throut tightenin' up so the voice
Cannot pass through.
Pain which is burnin' inside
When a longin' comes
After the last kiss
After the last gaze. <start> on the surface everything seems to make sense
things vibrate and forms all states of matter but go deeper
to the realm of a quantum and all sense is lost
and forms all states of matter but go deeper
yet somehow  things crystalize
somehow there is form
god doesn't play dice he plays chess
I am a pawn that somehow staid
fragile senses feed collective thoughts
but my senses are conspiring
how sweet I was blind but now I see
show  but who watches
chaos it would seem is the ultimate nihilist
somehow there is form

I am a pawn that somehow staid

Man <start> A horrid task the ship has left the insane must survive
A one way path that leads to death
at one within their minds
There's no one here to guide the weak
From creeping pending doom
A prayer is said to take them from this island
the unknown
This island this wretched place an awful piece of earth
As prisoners they've been released to wander into night
Fearful alert eyes gaze out and distort
Expecting detecting the awful thigns to come
Maniacal screams a suicide pact a lasting tone it rings
The socalled crazed dead the final heartbeat ends
Dying this coven's gone at peace now for all time
This twisted experiment crumbles before life's eyes
Their world was torture for the living
Then fate led them onward into night
In life they were different human victims
But in death they are silent corpses equal in mind
The horror the terror of what lies beyond
On the island of the unknown this island of the unknown <start> The seductress that flatters with her tongue
Don't be lead astray by her deceit
Nany are the victims she's cast down
All her slain are a might host
Her house is the way to hell
Descending to the chambers of death
Time and time and time again
Men are slaves to her
Sexual immorality
Leaving out the purity
It's not the way God intended it to be
Repentance is essential here
So we must practice what we preach
Fornicators shall have their part
Only hypocrites do the opposite of what they teach
You've been paid for
At a price
You've been bought by blood
the precious blood of Christ
You've been bought by blood
All her slain are mighty host
Her house is the way to Hell
Descending to the chambers of death
You've been paid for
At a price
You've been bought by blood
The precious blood of Christ
You've been bought by blood <start> music Mongrain  lyrics Lemay
Relics captured in stratas
For millennia have been sleeping
Secrets of buried scriptures
Are whispered through the sound of wind
Kingdoms or dormant splendors
For millenia have been sinking
Speaches of buried surfaces
Are roaming through the seas of sand
Realms once back to light
Archaspeaches are told
Realms brought back to sight
Archapolis beholded
Rising the fragments
Signs of previous lives
Told to the present
Lores of ancient times
Unspeakable beauties
Ruins of fabled places
Soiled testimonies
Of ancestor races
Relics captured in stratas
For ages have been hidding
Echoes from a lost era
Can be heard through the sounds of wind
Kingdoms of radiant slendors
For ages have been shining
Conquest of the conquerors
Are covered by the seas of sand
Unearthing the past
Knowledge...concealed
To the unborn one <start> I gave you life in times when all our colours bled
Cherished hopes and dreams of the life that we never led
And now its too late
Time to release you safe and sound
Time to conceal all of your scars
Forgive and forget we'll live to regret it all and now we know
This was not meant to last
You gave me time I thought was already mine
Spoke of what was wrong
I should have seen all of your signs
And now its too late <start> 
What the hell is this
I don't know what to do
I'm stuck in this position
Don't know where to go
Caught in the center
Caught in between
I can't think right
A solution cant even be seen
You have something to shoot for
Something that I don't
It's what I want most
Get mad No I won't

Who are you to say
What I can or cannot do
Want you with me one day
Next day you don't
 <start> This holy swine in slaughter profane in consecration
Potent words of the nocturne cause the fall of faith
Whore of sin to be washed away
Watery grave for the birth of plague
Burial of ideal with war and blood
Worms from graves shall be born by flood
Spoken words of the final war at hand
Mouth of plague inhaling demise of peace
Procession in cold blood
Cursed hands of condemned
Desolate waking loss of breath casting this mold of man's death
Bound to this eternity of shame
Embrace the blood black witch god
Mouth of plague exhaling wrath
Scathing grace unclean leach god
Before the age when man was blind
This urge of life was repressed by the light
Now evil has made its claim
With blood of virgin's grace
Lustful taste in venom of this flame
Feed my rage in rapture of pain
Awakening slumber of the beast
Worship in blood this great plague as tears are turned to stone
Left kneeling to this inversion of grace
Consume this word of deceit
Cold of sky to be the hand of cursed decay within a silenced tomb
Feverish mold to be cast beneath the layers of rotting earth
The blood fills chambers of the lungs
Stifling these last prayers
Suffocate in embrace of tainted life
Cold lips of spoken witchery
Outer shell removed from the flesh
The true offering revealed
Legacy in this game of thorns
Transition of birthing a sick king
Forgiveness embraced as this noose is placed around my neck
Salvation in failure condemns this soul to eternal black
Venom seeps into the garden of god tainting this birth of grace
Now lost to hell's hate these wrists shall welcome this escape
Bastard in waking this scourge of storm from god
Hellion to immerse in flood formed from the righteous
Forging this worship to arise
In this awakening of the emergence of the vile
Vengeful cries
Arise from hate <start> When the bound of day falls
skyline glows as your passion
the scent of anquish small
though only such futile impression
A night queen runs along my lid
she invites me to her foggy empire
no borders I laugh as the small kid
and all I feel is a desire
I wish to lead a blind man through the labyrinth of thorns
to kiss with phantasy in her soft embrace
I wish to enthral your love and to believe eternaly
to send a farewell to dead river it's boring gace
Wandering in paradise of my mistress
I meet a whitehaired oldman
with the next steps I feel your presence
and I see the picture again inviting woman
Life's murmur and the song of birds
foggy rays of stories
the fresh breath lets down from clouds
but already doesn't tempt my senses
The velvety wind propels my raft
always nearer to eternal throat
I've no longer force to break a stream
I send to nextborns the last scream
When the graceful queen of stars
offers you her tender love
don't hide your desire to holes
but grip her and fly with a dove <start> Los otros latinos tienen a Ricky y Carlos Santana
Pero nosotros un italiano llamado Cara Cortada
No hay raza ni orgullo no jugamos ese juegito
Tumbamos al mundo en los ochentas con el perico
Lo merecemos por echarnos arriba al del tabacon
Es la mejor idea aunque sea ficcion
Uno compra y uno sabe lo que de verdad es suyo
Tony Montana no me da orgullo
Vivimos en un continente que parece una isla
Apollamos sus ideales a veces pagado con ira
No tengas ilusiones yo no soy rehen
La guerra que existe es mia tambien
Yo solamente soy uno que busca libertad
No me importa de donde pero nadie la quiere dar
Prefieren robar a trabajar para lo que es suyo
Tony Montana no me da orgullo
Tony Montana que jarana tragate la banana
Que tiraron americanos que vinieron de Lantana
Armaremos nuestras balsas en el rio Potomac
Echando discos de Buena Vista Social Club
Hermanos al rescate perdiendo cuarenta anos
A correr bayameses al ajeno extrano
Por los hijos mios y los hijos tuyos
Tony Montana no me da orgullo <start> Let the weakness set in this world I know
Days cannot hold me I blur in between
Never fully engaged the mind races between words
As far as I can get away from it all
When indecision ends can life begin again
I am silence when the world screams out
I am escape when you reach out to me
I am panic
I am fear behind these walls that protect me
I am failure and resistance
I am lost where I belong
I am silence when the world screams
My insecurity extends to others talking about themselves
Fed with this poison of self righteous false confidence
It's in their eyes it's in our lives
Set to the tune of darkness this is one to hold
I cannot stop insanity from chasing down my thoughts
Linger in the mind for what now seems indefinite time
My mind is holding me down
When indecision ends can life begin again
I am silence when the world screams out
I am escape when you reach out to me
I am panic
I am fear behind these walls that protect me
I am failure and resistance
I am lost where I belong
I am silence when the world screams <start> 
Every night I hear thunder.
The shadow can't you see
So one night I will follow.
The dark side reigns in me.
 leads me to the dark plains.
The end is near I feel.
But  never seen his damned face.
My hearts pound hard in fear.
Dead of the night take me away.
Dead of the night he's looking for you.
A hundred solemn faces
they look at me and laugh.
But if one wants to touch them
they glow through nothingness.
If I come to tell you
you look at me and laugh.
I never found the doctor
so one day I'll be mad.
In that night I follow.
No pain no work no more.
He leads me on through the dark realm.
My sense grows far too dense.
Guitar solo
Dead of the night take me away.
Dead of the night he's looking for you.
They will not take me easy.
No love will come through death.
I take them on and kill myself.
And just feel emptiness.
Now you see them rising
but no one knows but me.
So don't try  follow a demon
and wait for a last attack.
In that night I follow.
No pain no work no more.
He leads me on through the dark realm.
My sense grows far too dense.
Dead of the night take me away.
Dead of the night he's looking for you.
Dead of the night. <start>

  ... <start> Path of endless fire bloody ride the burning of my soul
Paint twisting agony killing me I'll take the coffin ride
I feel my hollow breathing all in me is emptiness inside
I feel my life is ceasing me painfully as life and death unite
Seas of red I crossed before
Born dead I take your soul I come to life
Memories still haunting me
Involving madness feeds my kill throughout the night
Path of endless fire in my mind I see the demons dance
They watch my body suffer feast upon my blood soaked misery
Afterlife confessions buried lies death inflicted murder
Spirit stained by blackened cries
The future holds what death decides
Path of endless fire
Path of endless fire
Path of endless fire
Path of endless fire <start> Think of a horrific future forced to survive sheltered underground.
These are imagined sounds of the world above. <start> each of you must distinguish for himself
between the scenes of cold reality and those of pure illusion
the conscious thought the subconscious mind
finds society over the line tongues are silent when there is danger
eyes are blind when there's abuse ears are deaf
when someone pulls the trigger nowhere do I see humanity
don't have to be god to realize no one here gets out alive
but you have your chance  I got mine let's make it better one more time
peace the world back together again make it all worth existing again
peace society together again make it all worth existing again
a new society treaty  a bond between man
a new society treaty  it's the law of the land
constitutions steeped in gold blood and pride
living by this caused the great device
order without authority should be the foundation of a new society treaty
we have seen illusion and reality begin to overlap and fuse
the line between them begins to disappear
don't have to be god to realize no one here gets out alive
but you have your chance  I got mine let's make it better one more time
peace the world back together again make it all worth existing again
peace society together again make it all worth existing again
a new society treaty  a bond between man
a new society treaty  it's the law of the land
a new society treaty  for the preservation of man
a new society treaty  take this extended hand <start> Behold children ov Cain
All beings not ov reptilian form
Be upon them
Spare none mercy cast aside
Those who feareth not my sacred blade
Shall be blessed
Repent not
Thou art man
God is no more
Rise now above the weakness ov flesh
Come forth join ye the arsenals ov blasphemy
Follow the One
Who spurred Roman warring legions
Rise up o power from sea below all seas
SIRIUS DRACONIS
Awake from everlasting dream
Spirits ov abomination
Formless Thou hath appeared before me
I am before all things
Chthonic gods those from beyond the stars
Commander ov hosts devour the flesh ov man
May their weapons melt like wax
May their tongues be torn apart
May Apophis grind their bones
May their ashes be scattered all around... <start> Music by Sanrabb
Lyrics by Dolgar
Brought by death to the edge of the abyss
Fiercely thrown down into a void so cold
Darkness as you knew it its nothing compared to this
Going over the edge and ino oblivion
On dark silken wings carried further away
To a place of sadness and tranquility
On a chariot of gold the shade of a man
that before the seventh moon would give his heart and soul
Fire forever in the sky
Fire burning the sins of my past life
Fire torching my soul
It is my pleasure I will never see happen
With a snake wrung around his neck
He leaves sadness alone in the night
Feeding on sorrow figure in black
Hunters leave your home
I do not belive in falling down
nor waste myself struggling with this
Why do you live why do you breathe
When you know that from whence you came
You will soon return
I am trapped at the edge of existence
and I beg please cut these strings
Pit calling
Chills caressing me
Sight fading
I am home <start> Left in the dark another wasted day
Where you decree my salvation.
Passionless and self destructive
In the shadows of your failures.
Consequential bastard dredging
Dragging the waters of your self loathing.
I can't bear to tread these hallowed footsteps
Mocking every man that came before them.
Shed your tears and all you have to say
Bleach the taint forget to pass the blame.
Clean off the blood from the tears of your enemies.
Wrapped me up tight like a tourniquet 
Straining to breathe from the last revelation you'd given me.
Pushed for the light at the end of this shallow grave.
I can't be the...
First to cast the stone
Into the throat of the world.
The first to fall
Into the throat of the world.
Words leave their mark
Falling on dead ears.
Specks of dust settle here.
Setting suns cast shadows and faded landscapes
Long dead leaves lay pathways to your madness.
Scream my name and all that's buried deep
In your brain and leave the rest in pieces.
Drown in the blood in the tears of your enemies.
Walking a brighter path into a darker place
Crushed in between obligation and dignity.
Frightened to lose everything I've strived to be.
I can't be the...
First to cast the stone
Into the throat of the world.
The first to fall
Into the throat of the world.
Scream my name and all that you see
Leaves a trail to your deceit.
Beg for guidance and relief
To the sacred and profane.
Scream in the madness that claws at what's left of me.
Lost in the throat of the world.
Ground down then crushed into pieces and swept away
One altercation's still left for me to repay
Lie down and die in the light from a colder sun.
I can't be the...
First to cast the stone
Into the throat of the world
The first to fall
Into the throat of the world. <start> Nude and violated I raped the life from her body
Lying dead the insects bite her pale skin
My marks of torture
Left on my daughter
Body badly beaten
I remember
My ropes and chains
bruised her arms and legs
I wiped her blood on my face
her tender body I disgraced
Slow strangulation
her neck twisted and broken
Abdominal lacerations
Blood pouring from
Abrasions
Control of the mind
feelings left behind
dreaming inner hate
I create an alternate state of the grave
Scared to death
homicidal premonitions
horror fills you
As your soul is ripped from you
Dreaming my dream of death
I cast the spell
Intertwine your mind with mine
Dreams become reality
Enhancing the imagination
Murder is my infatuation
Killing off generations
Families torn to pieces
but the one they love
Possessed by another
My pleasure is to murder
Entering your dreams
through my spell they will bleed
Night after night
Reoccuring killings
Sleep
Someone wake me
from this nightmare
I've become my darkest fear
Awaken to the sight
of your hacked up family
their spirits are trapped
beyond the cemetery
Bodies rotting but I'm not sleeping
Scream you're not dreaming
Someone wake me
form this nightmare
I've become my darkest fear
Came to life
in my mind
A world of darkness
forever sleeping in this coffin
Eternally dreaming... <start> My last chance at sex was simple enough
Where I could breathe
Why can't everything just be a certain way
To let me see
Common sense would tell me that
The cancers eating right through me
And failed tests would tell me
That my life's in jeopardy
So why can't I breathe
Why can't I breathe
Why can't I breathe
Why can't I breathe
Why can't I breathe
Why can't I just breathe
Why can't I just breathe
Why can't I just breathe
One more time
My last chance at life was spent
Trying to burn the world with you
I guess it's easier with three people
Trying to kill me
So why can't I breathe
Why can't I breathe
Why can't I breathe
Why can't I breathe
Why can't I breathe
Why can't I just breathe
Why can't I just breathe
Why can't I just breathe
One more time
So I can breathe again
So I can breathe again
So I can breathe again
So I can breathe again
So why can't I breathe
Just breathe
Just breathe
Just breathe
Just breathe
Why can't I just breathe
Why can't I just breathe
Why can't I just breathe
One more time
Fallen down so low it burns me
It's time to change the scene
Faith is one way to relieve me
You built this up so help me breathe
So I can breathe again
So I can breathe again
So I can breathe again
So I can breathe again
So why can't I breathe
Why can't I breathe
Why can't I breathe
Why can't I breathe
Why can't I breathe
Why can't I just breathe
Why can't I just breathe
Why can't I just breathe
One more time
You're paralyzed
I can't breathe
You're paralyzed
I can't breathe
You're paralyzed
I can't breathe
You're paralyzed
So I can't breathe
Breathe
Why can't I breathe
Why can't I breathe
Why can't I breathe
Why can't I breathe
Why can't I breathe
Why can't I breathe
Why can't I breathe
Why can't I breathe
Why can't I just breathe
Why can't I just breathe
Why can't I just breathe
Why can't I breathe
Why can't I just breathe
Why can't I just breathe
Why can't I just breathe
One more time <start> Do you ever think about tomorrow
Do you ever think about yesterday
Do you ever feel sorrow
Over what you've let drift away
Lie alone rotting...
calling out for compassion...
for a final act...
they'll gladly pay...
You know you're just another...
broken brother...
scared sister... no one will ever miss you
anyway.
Do you ever think about the otherside
And who's waiting for you there
I'll be waiting for you dear.
When they suck you in.
Waiting for the door to be kicked in
Waiting for my head to hit the ground
Waiting for my heart to stop beating
Yesterday is dead and gone tomorrow is out of sight
It's so sad to be alone help me male it through the night.
You're lost in the drift
That's what you want isn't it
You're lost in the drift
That's fucking tough isn't it
You're lost in the drift
You get what you gave yes. <start> There's only one way to act
When you're dealing with fools
You stab them in the back
And break all their rules
There's only one way to be
When you're making it with she
You've got to play a role
And you've got to make it seem like love <start> erosion of the land causes my establishment to fall down to the ground below and i feel so low. i can't escape from you. reconstruction it's time to build again. maybe once this time i'll win. maybe i'll have better luck this time. this time. erosion. <start> For words two minutes three years for my fingertips to grow numb. Could this be the moment when the finally becomes the wish i could. Desperation and outstretched memories now i see you only in bad dreams. i never reset. I only see you in bad dreams. let me explain. close enough to feel your words. far enough to read your flesh. <start> Been a long time since I heard a human voice
Sitting at my controls watching those flashing lights
Few breaths left in my oxygen supply
Communication dead earth now just a spot
Now I know...I'm on my way
Now I know...Eternity calls me
Red light alarm the air is going bad
I lie back untie my belts everything is blurred
No air left in my oxygen supply
Soon I'll sleep away earth is just a memory
In many years from now
Someone will find my ship
Someone will see my body in it
And see the smile on my face <start> Ive bin waiting  to come up 
Posses the people by my demon thaughts 
And all this evil  that is in me 
Let it free  let it free demons come to me 
I am raising  from hell  I am walking my dear grave 
I am standing  on the hills  blood is raining let us take it all 
If i do  what you have tod me to  you well let me to the earth and i will fill it with hate  I will posses everyone  Let hell break through it will be fun 
Chourse 
Plesure of seing people dying 
Plesure by bringing theme fear 
Plesure by seing theme suffer 
Demons flying in the air  COME 
Plesure by seing  theme crying 
Plesure by seing theme lost by dispise  HELL 
I am flying in the air  like satan and his evil friends 
I will haunt  for the flesh 
And the human bodies that i will posses 
This is my story  Evil story  How i made this filthy damn earth fell 
I was trapped  in time  now im back i am soaring up from hell  <start> These days are burning down
Every death is an end in the race
 no arrival
These lives  just ripples
In the stunning widths of space
 slipping away
This march will never end
Every stop is a death deep within
 deep within
It is a WAR over years and years
It is a WAR...
Passion in every step
Every month is a part of the circle
 no arriving
Counting your mirthfull days
Every year is a march round the wheel
 on and on
And when there is nothing left to light these worlds
I will be right at your side
I will be there in time
In time...
Marching on...
Travel  Arrival
Together we will drown
In the river of your transciency  <start> The wind the war
I'm burning out
Is this the end
The bombs are raining hell
I see the real me
Floating out to space
Blown to bits
Where's the human race
Slave
Well it's immortal right
But I'll give it a try
As they fly through the air
Doubters beware
My home below a blissful place
Stuck in this silo
I live alone
Make the best of what I own
Trusty gold key
Ready to kindle the globe
Please lay these arms to rest
My will is running low
Slave
Well it's immortal right
But I gave it a try
While the faces stare
At the hideous glare
Better turn and run
I've unleashed the sun
You say you wanted it done
I'm the man to count on
I'm in the hole for life
These subtle words fit right
Lord knows man needs a vice
On my knees in pain <start> lied lied again. now your terms come to an end and it seemed quite shameless at the time and for years. has it been so long afraid to die and for years now it tears from the inside out. and for years. it scrapes the flesh it scrapes to wash. <start> Born of the void as a female human
Sha was full of innocence and weakness

Her own face soon betrayed her
It was time for demoniac vengeance

Then came her suicide to rejoin Satan
Her Father that teached her how to Fight the plague

Now she is the mistress of sin
Debauching the humans one by one
They try hard to reset temptation
Sometimes try praiyng gods 
Her hatred is almighty and ubiquitous
Always striking with a sweet brutality
Victims are always chosen at random
The race she once belonged to shall perish

She spawned sins and blasphemies
Incest sodomy rape...her depraved mind created them all

The mistical whore will penetrate everybody
Purity is scorned even if mankind keeps their dying faith

She vermins that the vermin has stopped growing
At kind of majestic infarificide 
Men and womenkilling each other
In the name of an invisible force
Her spirit is a vagina which procreated the Evil
Our Father Satan gave ger an immortal name
Lilith. <start> I sit by the fires gleam all by myself
Four empty chairs  one've been kept warm
I drink to my kinsmen who sails now with Njord
I drink to my kin who'll drink here no more
Odin owns ye all
I sing to them songs I wish their best on their way
I'm sure a valkyrie found them in the battle that day
I drink to my kinsmen who fought bravely at sea
I drink to my kin who'll be missed not just by me
Odin owns ye all
To arms To arms  The kinsmen said
They've chosen to meet us in battle today
Fight Fight  The kinsmen said
If we show true norse courage they'll soon run away
Wrong Wrong  The kinsmen thought
You cowards are fourty men may you rot in Hel
Rise Rise  The valkyries said
Odin decided this day you would die
I drink to my kinsmen
Who sails now with Njord
I drink to my kin
Who'll drink here no more
Who fought bravely at sea
I drink to my kinsmen
I drink to my kin
Who'll be missed not just by me
Odin owns ye all <start> I dragged her lifeless body to the deepest seas
Please show me the way out of this fucking hell
You could guide me to heaven with this sorrow
I have fallen into darkness my so called home
The screams came from the bottom of her lungs the cries for help.
The regrets are crawling on my back
My eyes are heavy from all I've seen
I can't believe I gave you my heart
Since you threw away the fucking key
I feel the demons crawling inside of me
I'll drag to you to hell so you can feel me everyday
Every step I take is a step closer to my funeral
Can't you feel that I'm rotting away from you
The screams came from the bottom of his lungs he cried for help.
The regrets are crawling on my back
My eyes are heavy from all I've seen
I can't believe I gave you my heart
Since you threw away the fucking key
With the sins around your neck I can finally breathe again
You got what you deserved In exile to nothing nothing but a paradise
A paradise for beings like you
The screams came from the bottom of their lungs the cries for help.
The regrets are crawling on my back
My eyes are heavy from all I've seen
I can't believe I gave you my heart
Since you threw away the fucking key
The regrets are crawling on my back
My eyes are heavy from all I've seen
I can't believe I gave you my heart
Since you threw away the fucking key <start> Hope hope can sometimes change your life
Hope can set you free
Hope can be a light in the dark
Dreams dreams may sometimes be shattered
Dreams might even fade away
But dreams can give you hope
Inside yourself
Me I gave up long ago
I lost my hope I lost my dreams
I became someone else
You you still remember me
But do you know and do you see
What I really am
I'll stay right here
Even though I've lost my life
To be a hero in your eyes
But will a hero live today
and will he fly away
or will he fade to black
This is how the story goes
Yet how it ends no one knows
I've become this to take revenge
To justify my actions
If our paths should cross again
In your mind I'm still the same
If you see a sign in the dark night
Would you think of me
I'll stay right here
Even though I've lost my life
To be a hero in your eyes
But will a hero live today
and will he hide his pain
Or will he fade
Or will he fade away
I'll stay right here
Even though I know
I know my life's a lie
And I long to save you
Then I'll be a hero
I'll be a hero
I'll be a hero
In your eyes
I'll stay right here
Even though I've lost my life
To be a hero in your eyes
But will a hero live today
and will he fly away
or will he fade to black
I'll stay right here
I've become someone else
Even though I've lost my life
I've become someone else
To be a hero in your eyes
Can't you see me
But will a hero live today
I've become someone else
and will he hide his pain
I've become someone else
Or will he fade to black <start> Despondent in my way but what can I do
A reason to be concerned when my rights are abused
Penchant for disorder disorder for a cause
Helping hands make light work to smash down these walls
To be taken advantage of
An opportunity for self gain
Fueled by selfish desire
To put right my ways
Pain fills my heart
Anger fuels my pain
A meaning for my reason
In a world that's so insane
Breathing down your neck time presses on
Can't change yesterday It's already gone
I won't despair I can't pretend
Take the bull by the horns and fight till the end
Enraged with good reason  is your cause for alarm
No subtlety in my reaction or my indignant charm
Fight for relief choice of belief
What is to be taken away is the beginning of the end
To be taken advantage of
An opportunity for self gain
Fueled by selfish desire
To put right my ways
Pain fills my heart
Anger fuels my pain
A meaning for my reason
In a world that's so insane
Enraged with good reason  is your cause for alarm
No subtlety in my reaction or my indignant charm
Fight for relief choice of belief
What is to be taken away is the beginning of the end <start> With each daring new concept
Creation and form
One fragment of shelter
From heaven be torn
The bleeding through barriers
Shine of redemption
The taste of renewal
Let art once again be a weapon
The whim of the forger
Is theft from the flow
The hatchet now redden
With creation's blood
Constant is forever
I am the creation so bold in design
The errors of one thousand minds
Bleed out through a world gone blind
This is the magic that a name would stain <start> The texture of the soul is a liquid that casts a vermilion flood
From a wound carved as an oath it fills the river bank a sanguine fog
These arms were meant to be lost Hacked severed and forgotten
The texture of time is a whisper that echoes across the flood
It's hymn resonates from tree to tree through every sullen bough it sings
These boughs were said to be lost Torn unearthed and broken
Earth to flesh flesh to wood cast these limbs into the water
Flesh to wood wood to stone cast this stone into the water... <start> Ajeno al tiempo
se que quisieras seguir
pero mil voces te ahogan
para que formes la cola del seguro porvenir.
Por eso te vi escapando
en las horas sin sol
de las miradas oscuras que aprobaron las torturas
del fugado represor.
Son quienes no alcanzan la paz
por sus viejos miedos.
Hoy esperan de vos seguridad.
Que no te demore el mundo no
ponindote el antifaz.
Y buscando acomodarte en medio del derrumbe
de su decadencia.
Pues la enfermante histeria
que hay a su alrededor
tratar de agotarte para que formes
parte de su digestin.
Y en su falso amor padecen de pasin
Antes de arrepentirse de su error.
Mata el miedo que guarda el animal.
Limpia el cuerpo pues dentro de l ests.
Si buscas libertad ya no ands por fuera.
Hombre de mil nombres nace ya nace ya. <start> Dive into your heart of silence
Where the strings of sorrow play our lullaby
We are the children of thousand ages
Dancing on the rhythm of a moonless night
I'm closing my eyes just to figure the moment
The exact place of your demise infection
My soul failing still to gain control
While it's growing inside
Carving a space here deep in a corner
Where the filth of your soul just can't hide
The stink of decay
As the memories whisper
Brand new demons offering your decline
Chorus
And die


Or try to live just another day
Right now this decay is corroding the surface
Both the shape and the core of your mind
As a struggle between
Your primeval instincts
What you're craving for escapes through time
Incinerate my soul
Drive the nails right through the palm of my hands
Suffocate my throat
Feed me with dirt and anger god it's breaking me apart
Nail the sadness to your sense of revulsion
Watch her bleed a very last time
Rip the feathers from her fragile wings
Now consecrate your wrath
Burn this sickening hurt
Deep inside you're frozen
Desecrate your lust
A black angel in disguise
Playing games with your mind <start> Monday morning a midwest gloom above.
The word on the other end the news's of death of hope.
Life slain by love
I don't think that we will live through this.
Life slain by promise.
One last message of the voice of himthe voice of hope.
But there was no hope
every second unfulfilled lifeless reality.
For every weakened mind for every broken heart
his strength will remain for memories every fucking day.
Every word you said came true
with this knife to your throat.
You got left in this hole left alone to die.
You foresaw the end.
Is this what you want from us
Is this what you wish from us
You foresaw the end.
You for took the end.
Is this what you want from us
Now we're going to give it to you. <start> Merciless to the siege  Agents massacred
Protected fortress  Underground militia
Religious sect  Proclaimed messiah
David Koresh
Devoted followers  One man's domain
Fortified compound  Stockpile of weapons
Forced reproduction  Tunnels underneath
Protecting children  From the enemy
Battalion of tanks  Failed negotiations
Stronghold secured
Rounds of ammunition fired
Canisters of CS gas  Dispersed inhumanely
Interpretations of the seven seas
Book of revelations
Reconstructed skull  Bullet wounds found
In craniums of slain disciples
Masks of bureaucracy  Identities released
Survivors interrogated  Reaccounting the horror
Useless ordeal  Ends in death
Merchants of greed  Fire consumes
Cloaked in sympathetic dismay
Beyond the grasp of the mind
In death the answer lies
Divine inspiration
Ascension towards supremacy
Dreadful endowment
Scriptures recited
Vengeance from martyred souls
Hero of the tribulation
Prepared to sacrifice
Allured by the disguise
Isolated from the world
Bodies lay scattered  Apocalyptic hell
Terrifying scene  Chilling act of suicide
Devoured by raging flames
Leaving a horrified world <start> All senses
Under attack
Oblivion
Penultimate
Anticipation
Fills your soul

One final chance

No guts no glory

One final chance
It now shall be no guts no glory
Swallow no pride strength from inside
Still driving on second to none

It now shall be no guts no glory
The last advance
One final chance
It now shall be no guts no glory <start> You're searching for high knowledge but truth is only one
And many can be all its form of expression.
You now must understand the double aspect of things
The holy the profane the occult and the clear.
Searching the way to power you reach the light
You can learn the secret laws of your life.
Spirit is the only pure and sure reality
Matter is only its inferior alteration.
Truth is possessed by the wise men of Earth
You only need to seek and bring it to the light.
Your existence is the result of a choice
A chain of death continued day after day.
Searching the way to power you reach the light
You can learn the secret laws of your life.
Spirit is the only pure and sure reality
Matter is only its inferior alteration. <start> Objection of the rules God is so selective
Who says it's time to take who decides when it's time to give
One thing's straight for me
Don't judge a case without knowing the game
Take a stand for yourself
Don't start fighting for another one's health
Suffer with Suffer within
Suffer with Pick on it
Information broadcast
The only matter is to deal with
Suffer with Do you admit
Sensational involvement
Actually it's none of your business
And when you think
Don't think too much
And about all your meaning I don't even care
Just play play a little song for me
Play a little song for me
Reflection about facts is not bad when you trace a line
Experiments sound cruel
Decisions rest on the family will
Suffer with Suffer within
Suffer with Pick on it
Information broadcast
The only matter is to deal with
Suffer with Do you admit
Sensational involvement
Actually it's none of your business
And when you think
Don't think too much
And about all your meaning I don't even care
Just play play a little song for me
I need affection and body warmth
Growing artificially
Fed by fed by machines
Desorientated driven off course
Which way is positive
Why can't they let me go
Suffer with just play another song for
Suffer within for whom  For me  <start> End of passion play crumbling away

Neverending maze drift on numbered days

Allow it to be caught by science
Life's boundaries are being smashed
Processes in natures defiance
Existence without creation
Life without conception
Humanity pushes progress
But is this in the right direction baby
Cones not knowing where you came from
Professionally created
Who were you spawned from
Frozen you have waited
An after crop of technology
Not knowing the warren crop
Of flowing milk and honey
Experiments no longer restricted to animals
As long as you got the money
Caught in a realm of fantasy
Is an actual reality
Life of mass brutality
You've blossomed from modern surgery
End the tears of infertile parents
Embryo's paused in time
Is your life an endless question
Or an unnatural crime
Now you know you have been told
The truth about your life
You're father was a sterile test tube
Your mother a surgical knife
Unable to carry a child so meek and mild
Who's fault is this
Our seed shall blend with science
In an alliance our minds insist
So now you find your life's an endless cause
The endless question that haunts you
You can not pause
Your parents say they are truly yours
Answering questions opening doors <start> Hung out to dry
Liquid rites engulf
Eaten alive
Again and again
It's raining murder here
And the caves are cold
I curse the skies
While the ground slides away
Sinking nowhere fast
Scorching upstream road
The chisel melts
And darkness falls forever
Too many words
Fighting backwards
Suicide down the hatch
This one's for the dog fight <start> Don't think
You're a fuckin' idiot <start> I fought my way through the darkest days
Out into the light I was scared and I cried
But I believed in something more
You are guilty for
This darkness you gave me everyday
Every time you pushed me away
The coldness you had shown me everyday
You'll never hurt me again
No mercy for the merciless
No forgiveness
No mercy for the merciless
No forgiveness go
I was not willing to believe that's all
All the pain all the tears all the lies
There was a great spark in the dark
A shining mark
This darkness you gave me everyday
Every time you pushed me away
The coldness you had shown me everyday
You'll never hurt me again
Your time is gone
My time has come
Your life is done
This darkness you gave me everyday
Every time you pushed me away
The coldness you had shown me everyday
You'll never hurt me again
No mercy for the merciless
No forgiveness
No mercy for the merciless
No forgiveness <start> Absorbing feeling and desiring
You fade away spewing their words up.
Rise to fall lie to last.
Look Nothing is opening it's arms...
Tangle of urges overflows
Staining every gesture and moment.
Raise your head and grasp that jest.
Antigod lurks in nonexistence.
Mute words of those who know
Distort the mouths of deranged fools into a sneer.
No war will be No revolution
The punishment is equal.
Perfectly coldno bond with this comedy.
Another urges from outside change nothing.
Hideous complete in itself tangle of desires
And millions of hands stretched out
Towards the swallowing void.

I still remember when you and I
Our love it will never die
If I could turn back time
Ease my desire
I always remember
The sadness I've seen in your eyes
I call for my master I'm calling his name
Mysterious laughter tortures my brain aha it tortures my brain
Stories of sadness stories of pain
I'm telling my tales to the wind and the rain aha to the wind and the rain
All the dreams I had in my mind
Was doing whatever I like
I still remember when you and I
Our love it will never die
Turn back time ease my desire
I always remember the sadness I've seen in your eyes
If I could turn back the time relieve my desire
It hurts me forever that I lost the love of my life

Panic in your eyes frightened you realize...
There is no escape from the earth
Armageddon has come it has only just begun
And there is no god above to hear you cry
Earthquakes shake the ground deep chasms open wide
Upon the face of the withering sky... The black lightning strikes
Shattered heaven
Warm blood is rising all locusts are swarming the air
Great comets are coming all animals going insane
Total disaster is throwing the earth out of orbit
The sun burns hypnotic blue
Faster and faster till the center cannot hold
The end of the world is true
Now the final fire explodes across the horizon
As your eyes are totally blackened out
The world is falling down in chaos turning 'round
Upon the face of the psychotic sky... The eye of the storm
This is the enormous black force that will end it all
The coming dark age of a world in fright
Armageddon has come it has only just begun
And there is no god above to hear you cry

With highschool you missed it
So that day you're enlisted.

You bond with them they become your boys

Now damn rain shit gets real
Enemy shoot back confirm your kills
You learn firsthand PTST
Your best friends kill by IED
You watch your whole team get blown apart
You catch a frag in a purple heart.
You write back home you lost your pride
This struggle with God is a suicide
To this country you gave your life

All of the sudden it feels so real
The bang the smoke the blood

And leave behind a trail of anger a path to find

Never hit the ground rising above
Looking down on you down on the heads of the damned
Marching all right through into the crowd
I want to scream
Clenched fist ground teeth
A bad dream feeling so mean
Stumble across my piece
Quiver the index sweat between the skin and the steel
All of the sudden it feels so real
The bang the smoke the blood
I want to kill to throw against the wall
Hole in the glass to feel it all
A release to stay insane <start>  <start> open wide
now that my body is pillsized
rode this wind like a zeppelin did
are you truly surprised
babe i looked you over
i picked your cover over
my lover didn't want to understand
i'm in the business of zoning
your acrobats are groaning
your salty words flew over my shoulder
everybody wants what they can't have
i want everything
he reminds me of the day i turned you in
everybody wants what they can't have
i want everything everything
i took a turn i know i'm sorry
i took a turn
with just a wrinkle my heart is a burden
the moonlight is simple we'll darn all the curtains
bittersweet needle in the bone
tell me all your favorite words
and in the summer you'll be gone
oh i moved too soon
stems and leaves thrown on the sidewalk
i would say that i was a gardener
but regret is a personal fault
regret is a personal fault
regret is a personal fault
regret is a personal fault
with just a wrinkle my heart is a burden
the moonlight is simple we'll darn all the curtains <start> I hearken to the grisly murmer of nameless fiends
Black jaws drooling blasphemy
Beyond the witchsong darkly sweet
The wyrmhorn sounds cross Dagon's mere
Shadowgate  yawns wide beckoning...
Spells scrawled in blood and frosty rime
Squamous god encoils the onyx shrine
 I am enraptured by ophidian eyes.
Pungent odour of engorged flesh
Vaults of eonveiled horror
Embraced by delerium witches' balms anoint me.
Veils of frost entwine me in the haze of baleful mooncursed dreams
I hear the High Ones whispering ancient spells in the longdead tongues
There is the gleam of blackened steel in the flickering torchlight
And I embrace the balm of sublime forgetfulness...
By the blaze of the burning skulls
Beneath the Well of the Black Flame
In the vaults of the dreaming gods
Shackled to the slimesmeared bleeding stone.
Squamous orbs black sword drink deep blood oath.
Supine shapes dancing in the mist
 priestess bares her pale flesh
Shadows crawl to the sundered stones
The Eternal Fiends exult in rapture.
Tombworms bloat on carnal blood
Trickling onto wraithcarved stone
Dark laughter echoes through the vaults
Blackwinged cruel as envenomed steel.
In the Well of Black Flame squamous shapes writhe
A dark tide of shadows follows me
Ravening fiends unleashed to feed
Incantations pour in torrents from my lips...
Wraiths and fiends whirl to my bidding...
Horrors 'neath the pyramid.
 <start> Proud narcisstic mask
Your eyes show the heart of a coward
Your vanity will be your demise
Frailty will concede your ruin
Cruel villainous acts
Vindictive you falsify and transgress
Nothing ethereal can change myself governing way of chaos
Stand to fall never to rise again
Forgotten salvation is lost
Take my hand we will perish together
So today you will remember me
For the years you have forsaken me
Impiety I profess is all you know
Your heedless notions of loyalty deplorable
I'm afraid this nightmare will last forever
Forever now more than ever my hatred will burn
For violence I dream of your death and as the sun sets
I swear it will be your last
Stand to fall never to rise again
Forgotten salvation is lost
Take my hand we will perish together
So today you will remember me
For the years you have forsaken me
I'm losing sight but know that your dream is dead
And I will fight this I won't turn away
I'm losing sight but my pain will die with you
Drown in flames nothing will suffice
Drown in flames in the deepest part of hell
I still see your face
Thieves betray through the flames surrounding
I will scream your name
Take my hand we will perish together
So today you will remember me
For the years you have forsaken me
I'm losing sight but know that your dream is dead
And I will fight this I won't turn away
I'm losing sight but my pain will die with you
Drown in flames nothing will suffice <start> Buy yourself some drums
and a guitar too
turn on the mike
we're jammin' dude
Steady as she goes
it's an easy beat
let's record this stuff
so what if it's shit
Don't look back
watcha doin' man
don't you know that tuning
guitars isn't in
fire it up
let's play on ten
we'll play in the basemant
where the bass is beter man.
Play that riff is it E or A
gimme a break no one knows anyway
we'll make a demo and sell the whole lot
nobody wants to buy it
Oh fuck why not <start> On a course to fight
To cleave a path with a trail of fire
To the heavens we take
Untarnished blades gripped by clenched fists
The thrill of the kill in the hunters chase
We have exposed the night from which the feeble flee
Untarnished blades gripped by clenched fists rise
Untarnished blades gripped by clenched fists rise
Brandish new force like a plague it strikes down
The time is now cos the time is right
To take what is ours
Subservient dogs
Crippled by the pack
Crawling in blind honour
Head down to be shot
Feel the new force like a plague it strikes down
The time is now cos the time is right
To take what is ours
You crawled in the dark
Blind faith broke you down
Face down in submission
Laying down to be shot
This dawn is ours to rise
To cleave a path with a trail of fire
Destruction force to strike
Untarnished blades gripped by clenched fists rise
Clenched fists rise
From the dawn has arisen the hunter
The banishing force the new world dominator <start> Power is a Human syndrome noone can avoid
Trying to defend it won't do you any good
Why live your life in abstinence when wealth is to prefer
This is the only life you got so like it now and here
I love this life in sin believe me
And all the freedom that it gives to me
Let out your desires and I feel the breath of lust
Do it for your own sake no matter what it costs
Spit on the preachers tolkjve and kick him in the ass
Make him eat his bible that has filled him up with trash
I love this life in sin believe me
And all the freedom that it gives to me
Damned are all religion they are only thieves of life
Would you like another Jesus watch an angel fuck your wife
If God and Satan are fighting then let them fight alone
If God strong he will survive if not he will get blown
Are you gonna hang around and watch this world go by
Don't you act so foolish it's a case of do or die
Lies and cheatings stole your life and your identity
Better reach out for it now I'm here to set you free
I love this life in sin believe me
And all the freedom that it gives to me <start> A rising bleak dawn a permanent sunset
On the human condition a boot perpetually treads
Illumination snuffed forwards on time will march
Holding as a mirror condemning to repeat the past
End time the realms of a setting sun
Twilight a new age has begun
Decline decension to a new dark age
Blank time an old world not quite so brave
Right on the edge
Of a new dark age
Back on the edge
We stand on the edge of darkness
A fading dusk empty blanketing shade
A dying sun only blackness radiates
An aeon ends a millennium overturned
Time lies in embers as barren horizons burn
End time the realms of a setting sun
Twilight a new age has begun
Decline decension to a new dark age
Blank time an old world not quite so brave
Right on the edge
Of a new dark age

A man is aware of them
He's proud of his life
All spent betraying himself
With no remorse hides
His heart from his own mind
Fateful omissions
And now back home again
Cold breath
Twilight
Come near
Sad eyes
Can't you hear them
They are trying to show
Some reflections
Of you dressed by guilt
The sudden dance
Shakes down the shrine
And steals your mind
Unfair judge look around
Its you your love
Our faith so sworn
The spells youve never cast
Its time right now
Dance with us
Put your pride away
We are the dancers
You must free us from this shifty cage
Cage  help  free
About to fall
To rise your eyes
A light ray shines
The steps freeze
No way out from here
A new day dawns
To teach new lies
The jailer of your soul <start> As the life goes on as usual a three feet wall restrains
 inches cut not the first and certainly not the last
A killer full of adrenaline
Tormenting its victim for hours till it has drawn its last breath
For a reason long forgotten
Screaming for an answer nothing is real I am lost in this world
Searching for truth screaming but no one will hear my silent scream
I found my self again after all these years
I go from clarity clarity
In my sleep I grow I am finally touching the ground
Found the missing part that makes a man whole
My pain is vital for our survival
The pain from the piercing of skin makes me much stronger and stronger
Sweet pain sweet artifacts  and as the skin breaks
A death mask taking shape small mistakes makes him more visible
A death mask taking shape small mistakes makes him more visible
Searching for the answer but still I'm searching for the truth
My pain is vital for our survival
My pain is vital for our survival
I found my self again after all these years
I go from clarity clarity
In my sleep I grow I am finally touching the ground
Found the missing part that makes a man whole <start> Bloodied cleaved and mutilated
Dead bodies amputated
Man's bloody inclination
God's final abdication
Angels weep on bended knee
So beings the tyranny
The fallen one will rise again
So ends the time of man
My will be done
Now they death day come
Never more the sound of laughter
Misery for ever after
The cries of suffering
Are what the death day bring
No one gives the benediction
All hear the malediction
Lucifer makes his accent
No words for man's lament
My will be done
Now they death day come
On black wings I take to the sky
Scouring the land
Rejoicing in and laughing at
The folly of man
Centuries of hatred
Centuries of fear
Have led you to the end of days
And the one you so revere
The gates of heaven have been shattered
Wings of angels torn and tattered
All due to mankind's thirst
For war so well rehearsed
When you see my demon eyes
Too late to apologize
Can you feel the irony
War for all eternity
My will be done
Now they death day come <start> Instrumental <start> Oj ty step' da oj ty step'

Istina zhiva <start> In the breast of the sky I saw them gathered in flight casting down
their enveloping aura as leaves would fall it touched my every pore. The
kindest words of echonian tongue no longer fell on deaf ears and I could
feel their joy as it carried me into the clouds. And for six days and six
nights I was as they were... I too spoke in echonian tongue and sang the
songs of Byzantium. As Midas had with touch I was granted with a vision
as a gold world embraced me and kissed my soul. I was alive then. <start> Awake me
Stoic and ready
Living in levity
Static entry
Chatter has left me
A statue grown with intentions from my own
I stutter on
Key driven
A swollen breeze insults me
The scent of a natural place
Chatter has left me
A statue grown with intentions from my own
I stutter on key driven
Horrid thoughts finally leave me
Dismiss the notion of the unwanted force
Static entry
Alone and free
Awake me
Focus on melody
The sounds under my eyes
Dreaming inside of this world inside my mind
Drift on never end
Drift on never end
Static exit
Animate
Tubes swim with my veins
An orchestra of lights graze over my corpse
Our souls are melting
Immobilized limbs secrete liquid smoke
Fill the room with fear
A losing act draws in the final wake
Overcome the end
I did not I did not want to come back
I did not take me back
I did not I did not want to come back
I did not take me back
I did not I did not want to come back
I did not take me back
I did not I did not want to come back
Take me back
It's over it's over
I sit drenched in the summary of my past
I sit drenched in the summary of my past
Live in the name of live in the name of the ghost
Live in the name of live in the name of the ghost
Live in the name of live in the name of the ghost
Live in the name of live in the name of the ghost
I drift on
I drift on
Focus on melody
The sounds under my eyes
Dreaming inside of this world inside my mind
Drift on never end
Drift on never end <start> Oh
What has exhaustion brought me
Unvisited but still too busy to close my eyes

Maybe one day I'll grasp the pattern
Maybe in time this will all be readable
Maybe in time 
As if the solitude could bring me any peace
I was greeted with Constance I found no sleep
These thoughts are nothing but wished away
I can't remember what it is to be content
These thoughts are nothing but wished away

I can't remember what it is to be content 'eah
Show me the exit
Let the signals fade
Maybe one day I'll defeat the cycle
Maybe  in time 
I'll be able to define this
This wretched purgatory 
As if the solitude could bring me any peace
I was greeted with Constance I found no sleep
These thoughts are nothing but wished away
I can't remember what it is to be content
These thoughts are nothing 
But wished away 
I can't remember what it is to be content
This is bound to fail
This is bound to fail
Go ahead
The enemy will not resist deceived until the end
I hate this persistence my eyes may never close
I hate this persistence my eyes may never close <start> In the shadow of my mind lies an enemy of all life
Who has grown to be all we fear in oursleves
Hate is all we need to loathe To become the goal that we seek
And fix ourselves inside to heal the wounds and scars
The glory of our life is to seek the questions we need
To journey for a time and smile a while through our pain
Fading to dust is all that remains
The sun will Arise
Confession fo my conscience dragging me down
The realm of dreaming is my land of eternity
Purpose at last What I make of it Mine to see
Confession of a miracle fading at dawn
Redemption awaits the living who take what's theirs
For we're all in sin If we don't forgive and fall in love someday
You know nothing my son
Maybe you believe you found another level of consciousness
Remember there is no desire You'll never fly
No Don't give your heart away It'll only get crushed in the end
The chaos that we live in is no place for love
Maybe he told me what he believed wasn't a lie
And by the candlelight lie the ashes of his broken dreams
Love knows no boundaries but neither do my scars
But living just to die
Is like living in their lies
Let me feel this way again

Isn't that what we are here for
I know who I am <start> Yeah I like that you know what I mean
You're looking kind of fly tonight girl
What's up check it
Baby when the lights go out
I'll show you what it's all about
Comin' at you girl you're gonna like this girl
Here we go check it
I ain't sorry for the way I feel
I know you think I'm being insincere
From the way like I'm treatin' you

Baby it's not the way I feel
You know you must believe me

Every single word could not express <start> Mia es la voz quelo canta
Y es por sentir que me atrevo.
Con las raices que tantos olvidan
Persiguiendo forneos modelos.
Tradiciones del pas.
Que forjaron aquellos.
En fortines aguantando
El maln traicionero.
Que bien describe Jos Hernandez
En su Martn Fierro
Digo en la zamba que hasta m
Trajo este guitarrero.
Hoy que en toda su extensin
La patria est alambrada
Desheredados gauchos e indios
Empobrecidos reencarnan.
Y con toda su ansiedad
Por poseer lo que aquellos
Mueven la rueda del escolazo
Y el condenable escapismo siniestro
Que me describe en su cotidiano
Plato de alimento.
Miente la historia
Digo en la zamba de este guitarrero.
Zamba que resurreccin
Te darn criollas guitarras
Yo mis decires dejo contigo
Para honra de la raza.
A las raices restar olvido
Quien guste entonarla.
Como yo mismo
Y sin perseguirme
Me he atrevido a hacer. <start> Legions bow to a faceless God

brainwashed forever. unwilling to see the lies.

Cold breath upon my skin
A tortured soul
That cries and begs for me
To let it in
It's in the shadows
I can feel you in my bones
Just manifest yourself
And show to me
I'm not alone
Yes it's me in the shadows
It will be on your grave
I want to feast on your spirit
I want to make you my slave
Cast you away
Leave me alone
Here I will stay
For the rest of eternity
When these two worlds collide
There's nothing left behind
Cast you away
Leave me alone
Here I will stay
For the rest of eternity
When our two worlds collide
There's nothing left behind.
I hear the whisper
This future just wont subside
This fight I wont give in
My minds become a battlefield
Yes it's me in the shadows
This will be on your grave
My only goal is to kill you
I'm gonna make you my slave
Cast you away
Leave me alone
Here I will stay
For the rest of eternity
When these two worlds collide
There's nothing left behind
Cast you away
Leave me alone
Here I will stay
For the rest of eternity
When our two worlds collide
There's nothing left behind.
When our two worlds collide
There's nothing left behind.

When our two worlds collide
There's nothing left behind. <start> Invoking the dark and the moon of the night
Summoning the beast forgotten tales
The angels slained the shades of life
As they spread the wings of death
Screaming of fear destroyed my faith
Howling beasts crimson tears
Ravens cries in the shadows of night
The lighting strikes from the cloudless sky
Alone in the forest of dusk I ride
Without one path where I could go
A place of ancient splendour rise
Darkness falls upon my face
As creature as shadows once roaming that place
Death lying waiting for my soul
Deep in the shadows of night
She worshiped books for demonic dreams
Deeper and deeper light was gone
Feel embracement of the dark
At this point of time I know
Prisoned in demonic dreams
Deeper and deeper light was gone
Feel embracement of the dark
At this point of time I know
Prisoned in demonic dreams
As I arrived on the ruined tomb
Centuries of dusk marching side by side
Bleeding shadows of thy shrine
The forest whispers laments for me
Painfull screams devours my mind
Serenades of angel tears
Falling down from the bloodred sky
A voice of destruction is calling to me
In my dream I summon the beast
Just like the rain an october night
The sun has stopped shining light
Just like a withering flower
Slowly  fading away
An eternal landscape of ashes and dust
Dead birds are falling from the sky
The place that you've named paradise
Emptiness what I can feel
The rain that falls taste like blood
The arrive of the black northern sky
And the angel rape my soul
Forgotten in demonic dreams <start> Wanna push it to the top wanna see how damn downward you can go
This is where it all begins could as well be my last time for real
Never wanted to know never wanted to see better open your eyes 'cause I'm breaking free
Yeah I'm breaking free
All your sorrow looks so hollow no I don't need your words of advice anymore
You're cheating you're deceiving put the blame on me for things I don't even know
Fade away feeling almost dead inside  just tear it apart
Fade away fallin' off a shoreless lie  this time the wound is structural
I know how you feel know it too well the same old look you ain't changed yet
But trust my words you ain't seen nothing at all wanna drag you down
Where you brought me wanna quench your thirst with the worst disease
Yeah I'm your disease
All your sorrow looks so hollow no I don't need your words of advice anymore
You're cheating you're deceiving put the blame on me for things I don't even know

There ain't a reason to justify your denial and now I see things how they are
Fed up with treasons my life from yours I divide for all my dreams are torn apart
One day we'll meet again farewell why pretend
See you at the bitter end don't need this curse anymore
Fade away feeling almost dead inside  just tear it apart
Fade away fallin' off a shoreless lie  this time the wound is structural <start> Here we are once again.
Time to choose at the crossroads end.
Here we are stuck again.
Time to speak or to forever be silent.
It comes to a point where I can't take another lie.
The day has finally come.
Where I demand your silence.
Comes to a point where I can't accept another lie.
The day has finally come where I would die for your silence.
At loss for words.
And I'm short of breath.
And in fear of truth I came to trust in you.
What I demand of you is just to speak the truth.
You've got your chance right now.
Or to forever be...
It comes to a point where I will know you lived a lie.
And I'm the first on my knees to accept my naivety.
Comes to a point where I can't accept another lie.
The day has finally come for you not me.
To be
At loss for words.
And I'm short of breath.
And in fear of truth I came to trust in you.
What I demand of you is just to speak the truth.
You've got your chance right now.
Or to forever be bleeding...
to forever be believing...
to hide from me...
and leave me alone....
Here we are once again.
Time to choose at the crossroads end.
Here we are stuck again.
Time to speak or to forever be silent.
At loss for words.
And I'm short of breath.
And in fear of truth I came to trust in you.
What I demand of you is just to speak the truth.
You've got your chance right now.
Or to forever be... <start> I'm just laughing... why do you cry all the time
I'm standing here upright... don't look down all the time
I'm alive... why do you die all the time
I want to fight... do you enjoy watching
I'm flying... so why are you crawling
I wonder... why do you stand aside as if...
Torpid sleepy weak and paralysed
The end of joy
The end of life
The end of summer and the beginning of winter
Think of the difference between us...
I keep of walking and don't turn around
Why did you turn back to the object
My eyes are open...
Why do you wear sunglasses at night
I don't confide in strangers... why are you scared
I was never afraid to turn my head against the wall...
And that's why I'm not like you...
Torpid sleepy weak and paralysed <start> Innocents are all the children
Rubbing their lamps planting their beans
Hoping that one day miracles will happen
Never knowing what it means what it means
When the sun goes down mysteries begin
The fullmoon brings monsters around
Vampires and werewolves could now come in
And all the shelters could be found
Pride in their heart when heroes win
Sadness comes when they fail
Eyes wide open hope within
Victory's like wind in the sail
Where have gone those wonderful stories
They made us fear laugh and cry
We want our dreams and fantasies
Give us back our fairytales our fairytales
Tales of hope tales of misery
Tell us now tell us the moral
Is there really one in every story
No matters if it's good or evil
Pride in their heart when heroes win
Sadness comes when they fail
Eyes wide open hope within
Victory's like wind in the sail
Where have gone those wonderful stories
They made us fear laugh and cry
We want our dreams and fantasies
Give us back our fairytales our fairytales <start> When I succeed I'm thinking of you
You could have stayed and seen this thing through
Where the wind blows where it takes you
You don't care because you've no clue
I admit I trusted in you
I admit I got so screwed by you
Here I stand unshaken and
I don't mind this price I must pay to survive
Bring it on... Bring it on...
One hundred times fallen
One hundred times risen again
I fight with all I am
Never looking back
One hundred times faltered
One hundred times stronger am I
I look into the mirror
No one's by my side
I'd like to see you walk in my shoes
To teach the lesson and not to amuse
Now regret is your only friend
It is you who lose in the end
Take a look at all of my wounds
See how they healed this season anew
I still stand unshaken and
I don't mind this price I must pay to survive <start> In the name of God you chosed the night
Did you really thought you'll be delivered 
Do you fear you will not see the light 
I know it's the end of your clear mind.
You see my demons flies over skies
And death is coming to be your bride
There is no helping hand of jusus christ
And all your hopes are broken down and down.
They told you stories about eternal life
Somewhere in heaven and down in your hell
So look around you and see the real presence
There's only destroyed Earth and sickness and pain.
I see many insane ones drowned in lake
I see many ones destroy the signs of their souls
They're all damned only strong ones will survive
They're all down and poor the truth is known.
You lived your lives in the name of nothing.
Be prepeared you'll be not understood...
Chorus
Let me introduce you the truth of this world
Let me impart you there's liberty of thoughts
And your dark satan was the same as your God
And I see you hopeless but this is the night
The truth is known for all who survived
But there's Shakespeare's question  actual
To be or not to be sounds words in your minds
Not prepeared to face new world without their God.
You see my demons flies over skies
And death is coming to be your bride
There is no helping hand of jusus christ
And all your hopes are broken down and down. <start> Chorus
Faustus
The time has come for you
And here's your sentence
That is your fate and
It's no use repentance
You must pay with your soul Faustus
You have come to your goal Faustus
You wished the deepest
Knowledge of tomorrow
And power to clean off
Grievance and sorrow
We have made your wish true Faustus
Now we are over you
Love your force may get me free
And show me how to flee
From my fate
When my time is over
Love you help me to understand
That all is in my hand
Just today
Not far away
Bridge
Love... I've fallen in distress and dismay
Because I'm waited
Predestinated
Fated...

Mephisto the intriguer
For your soul is eager
There's a compact you've consented
With blood your soul have been rended <start> Music ValnesEviga Lyrics Eviga
Es war einmal vor langer Zeit
eine Wesenschar zu trumen bereit.
Vor dunklen Burgen schauderte man
von Feen schien man angetan.
Ein Leichtes war es Schtze zu finden
weit leichter noch ein Herz in Rinden.
Schmale Pfade luden ein
nur fort weit fort von Haus und Heim.
Einst Wasserklnge Farne dachten
als Mrchen ber Trume wachten.
Als Blten der Wolke Blick entlohnten
Nebel kaum ein Tal verschonten
und berall noch Mrchen wohnten.
Als der Grser Grn fr golden galt
gaben Trume der Wahrheit Wohlgestalt. <start> The ocean's beauty
No longer moves my heart
It's black and empty
My aim's so for a part
I'm madness maddened
Driven by the waves of hate
It's him or me well
That's in the hands of fate
Somewhere deep within
There is nothing left but trouble
And the longing for the sweetness of revenge
Somewhere deep within
Let revenge be mine
Come all you mastheads
Come all you harpooners
Sing out for him well
My order shall be clear
All you mastheaders
You've heard these words before
It's your blood money
This broad bright ounce of gold
Somewhere deep within
I am forever Ahab
And this whole act is immutable decreed
Somewhere deep within
Let revenge be mine
A walk through the shadows
We'll soon cross the line
There is one thing for sure
You'll rise nevermore
A walk through the shadows
We'll soon cross the line
Beneath these waves you'll sleep
Somewhere deep within
There is nothing left but trouble
And the longing for the sweetness of revenge
Somewhere deep within
Vengeance shall be mine
A walk through the shadows
We'll soon cross the line
There is one thing for sure
You'll rise nevermore
A walk through the shadows
We'll soon cross the line
Beneath these waves you'll sleep
Beneath these waves you'll sleep <start> Words W. Sssenbeck  Music Bhm Pichlbauer Koritar

The cold wind speaks for our lost
Whispering words weaving worlds
Her time has come alas
A man with opened eyes
One stopped out of a dream
With a view held within his mind
The tears for his bride redeem
Watching this world falling apart
Like the dreams in a shallow sleep
Countless are the nights they shared
The mourning in his tears
But morning still has broken
A light in his world of dawn
All beauty turned to rot
His flowers all are gone
Close the eyes of eternal love
Buries his face in his hands
Her face looks so alive
In the morning sun
But morning still has broken
A light in his world of dawn
All beauty turned to rot
His flowers all are gone
Dreams are nothing but illusions
Illusions for one to see
It's the visual projection of our inside
And as empty as the heart in me
As the heart in me... <start> Llegaste a m

The rock that was an egg is in wrong cradle

Fantasies misery came together
in the world of guilt and pain
A neverending game
Do not reject me I was better of without
But in my agonized existence I needed to be free

Free my mind free my soul
I do not need to feel no more
Feel no more I'm better off this way
Alone far from the past and its brutal face
I still feel the disgust and pain
Let me be free
Chorus
This is my life today this is the way it went out of control
I cannot do without these glorifying means my remedy
These amazing illusions fantasies

Fanatsy not for me like another mirror of reality
Another point of view
Don't disbelieve me I really tried to do without
But with sadness as a companion it's hard to do
Without the seduction to become someone I'm not
But in this beautiful deception I'll overcome the night
Another day another week I'll overcome time

Colors seem to flow they seem to come alive
While the sound of life is stronger than before
It's more than a dream this is so real
I swim and fly I never feel more than I need than I fear
I roam I cry I am paralyzed
I can fight the world
The sense of time is not important now
Just like the past just like right now
There's no illusion that this is for real
Grunts
Observe me control me
Tell me what is best what's good
Tell me how it worked for you
Tell me how to find myself find resepct find the strength

Running out of time
Relating to those that
Just stopped trying
Clinging to those little things
And the light they bring
I bow down to you
Extinguished youth
Scavengers became
Future romancers
And my angels carry
A predatory glow
I'm weaker by the day
No way to be saved
I bow down to you
Extinguished youth
Emptiness
Drags me down
To the depths
With no sound
It's what I lack
That attracts 
To the jaws
Of defeat

End me
Mend me
End me
Mend me
End me
Mend me
End me <start> You thought it was gone
But the fire goes on
And I thought you knew me
I told you before
'Til I settle the score
That I'll never run free
I have enough pain and anger in my brain
To last many lifetimes
Yet still it grows and the more that it shows
I won't have peace of mind
The fire the fire still burns
I have a dream
And as strange as it seems
There's no embers glowing
The fire's gone out and there's no need to shout
'Cause no anger's showing
But it's not true nothing I ever do
Seems to ease my fury
Get out of my way
I'm the hangman today
And the judge and jury
The fire the fire still burns <start> Dead eyes
A golden lever a choice of gold or velvet
Do I go on or follow the ropes in the smoke
My last choice arrange my voice
My last choice arrange my voice
Dead eyes
The lever falls down south
To look at
Enlighten me
I'll follow towards the smoke
The reaching of the rope
I'm always lost
The idea of dreaming in a dream
My vision is serene
Please lift me up
Breathe underwater
Swim without limbs
Breathe underwater
Swim without limbs
These new eyes will never suffer
Enter the new wake
Looking back through the painful tunnel
They taught us what once was
These new eyes will never suffer
Enter the new wake
Looking back through the painful tunnel
They taught us what once was
What once was
What once was
What once was

Cast me new breath
What is this place
An alluring frontier <start> Delinom
Now that darkness has arrived
And the moon is only light
I'm crossing this line
To the land which soon is mine
And I'm fighting for my pride
With this sword by my side
Cryon's warriors go hell
I can hear the winning bell
The winning bell
I see how all my men are lined
Only give them one more sign
And they are heading to fight
To fight for they right
And I raise my sword up high
So high up the sky
My troops on their way
This is a glorious day
I ride and send my troops into fight
Soon they all will sing for victory
My troops and sword will help me on my way...
 I'll rule this world eternally
Eternally
Now that daylight has arrived
And I see the end of fight
I have won the war
Now it's time for second door
To Fedoria I must ride
I'll be there before the night
Maegon must die
He has no place to hide
I ride and send my troops into fight
Soon they all will sing for victory
My troops and sword will help me on my way
 I'll rule this world eternally
I ride <start> Terminal desire of thoughts
Overcome my destiny
I got the vibes of pain
Emotional dementia
I've found the thrill of the discontent
I bleed no longer
I'm through
This solitude was made for you
Misery enthroned by defeat
in a poverty of expression
I reject this anxiety
Wastelands from inside
I'm longing to be feeling not
I'm standing at the edge of the abyss
Your false remorse means shit to me
Feeling not
Go... <start> Moonlight rays awaken me
From my eternal sleep
I am not alive but I still breathe
I ask myself how can this be
The feeling inside is hard to describe
I feel strong but yet so weak
I walk into the night with a hunger so strong
Something to eat I seek
Pulses quicken piqued by the scent of blood
Noooooooooooooooooooo
That's when I realise I've become one of them
Cursed to live in darkness never see the light of day
It's the birth of a vampiir  Strigoi
It's the birth of a vampiir  Strigoi
Moonlight rays awaken me
From my eternal sleep
I am not alive but I still breathe
I ask myself how can this be
I've become one of them
Never see the light of day
It's the birth of a vampiir  Strigoi
It's the birth of a vampiir  Strigoi
Cursed to live in darkness never see the light of day <start> I remember when I was twelve years old
No worries in my brain with a pound in my pocket
And a chest full of smoke
I remember all the chordies we drove.
We used to play football all day and use jumpers for goalposts
And throw egg yolks at windows to wind up the old folks
Started learning about the birds and the bees
So there's birds from my class on their knees behind trees.
My favorite emcee was Sharkey Major
Way before I hit one double O three Temptation Kiss  or Flava
Get off from school and take
Ninety two point three but let's skip forward in time
Seven years down the line and it seems the spotlights on me
Sometimes I still wish that I was still twelve or thirteen.
Life can pass you buy just watch how fast it flies
Nineteen eightynine's when I started mine now I'm like 'what happened to the time'
Life can pass you buy just watch how fast it flies
Nineteen eightynine's when I started mine now I'm like 'what happened to the time'
Fifteen bag of weed bag of beers in the park
Duckin' out from Feds in the dark.
Then we appear with grass stains up and down my legs and arms
And with a fresh beer clenched in my palm.
Sixteen my bars are different class
I've been rolling with Dogz and Glamour and Shotz for a year
I've been steppin' up fast.
I guess I got around in the bits.
I was selling bags of bud and Tales from the Crypt.
I met Ghetts when I was fourteen lost touch.
By sixteen I'd linked up with Ghetts again
Rolling with The Movement and started doing sets for them.
Mercston Scorcher Unique and Wretch and 'em.
Two thousand six I was seventeen when I finished my first solo CD
But this time there's an album in the midst.
Life can pass you buy just watch how fast it flies
Nineteen eightynine's when I started mine now I'm like 'what happened to the time'
Life can pass you buy just watch how fast it flies
Nineteen eightynine's when I started mine now I'm like 'what happened to the time'
By the time I hit seventeen I was the coldest younger on the scene
With bars you never heard and flow you never seen.
Before I come around it was 'cock it and shoot'.
Emcees being cocky and rude then I moved to some deep concepts in my tunes.
Monitor my brain waves tell me if I'm crazed but I think the games changed
And emcees are opening doors in the same ways.
As I did when I was a kid on Rinse radio waves
And now I'm paving the way for a fatal display
Might blaze in a haze till I'm dazed then wave a grenade in your face
Seventeen with bars that I regulate and generate pace
I'm only scared of who my enemies face.
Life can pass you buy just watch how fast it flies
Nineteen eightynine's when I started mine now I'm like 'what happened to the time'
Life can pass you buy just watch how fast it flies
Nineteen eightynine's when I started mine now I'm like 'what happened to the time'
Nineteen showing strength in the booth
Now it's time to prove what Devlin can do.
From the very first time I ever crept on a tune
I've immensely improved the ascendance is due.
Original spitter not remnants of you.
Swear I can see success in my view.
Crazy what letters in a sentence can do
'Cause my lyrics are the only thing sending me through.
Kanye called me a gangster rapper I'm not a gangster rapper
Devs I just spit it real.
You're an emcee like C difficile.
I look skinny 'cause I keep on missing meals.
I'll get cold like you know how frigid feels.
No children sticking them rigid still
I guess my life's fed up but I'm only nineteen and I've got a lot of living still.
Life can pass you buy just watch how fast it flies
Nineteen eightynine's when I started mine now I'm like 'what happened to the time'
Life can pass you buy just watch how fast it flies
Nineteen eightynine's when I started mine now I'm like 'what happened to the time <start> Church bells resounded like judgment day
As they were making love
In the rainswept graveyard
She fucked him hard silhouetted by flame
A monsoon Tigress set upon prey
Fall for the love of me
Crawl for the love of me
Drool for the love of my virulent sway
I grow more master the faster the days
Lilith Immaculate
This delectable reaper
Her eyes were profound
Drawing him in deeper
Until he was drowned
Hurled on the shore
Of the world underground
Lilith Immaculate
Mortal kind a morbid wine
For this dark moon goddess
And freed to stretch her claws
This beautiful whore
Would be brutally honest
Tortuous one taboos undone
A glittering star on a sea of myriad waves
And a thickening mist a seductress
Leading lovesick hearts astray
Lilith
In the throes of orgasm she bucked and he broke
At the height of the storm the chaos they'd smote
Burning behind her in arabesque smoke
Framed a vision transformed as she sucked from his throat
Victoria smiled her now golden eyes
Possessed a regal bearing
Of omnipotent power
From wet lips to her smoldering thighs
Her beauty perfected and her will agonized
Fall for the love of me
Crawl for the love of me
Drool for the love of my virulent sway
I grow more the master the faster the days
Lilith Immaculate
With dread single purpose
Her mind told him stay
She strode through the fire
Desire aflame
She murdered the nuns
In such horrible ways
Lilith Immaculate
That night we lay entwined on hay
Inside a soldier's barn
Her panting breath an opiate
As in her bolder grasp
I caught the scent of desert sands
The Holy lands the fall of reason
But only when I smelt the blood
Did I fear her colder hand
I am darkness I am sin
The Queen of lust invited in
Reborn at last to cast my
Fecund shadow on this world
You shall worship me enslaved
For many lovers shall I crave
And in return I'll gladly pave
Your psycho path with pearls
For I have been grating
And waiting so long to find
The most perfect hostess close to me
Whose thinice troubled mind
Was like a cracked black ornate mirror
To slip right through in time
When at last I wore Harmonia's necklace
The cursed twin serpents mine
Tortuous one debauchery won
The attention of Emperors Princes and Tsars
For the toll of her kiss no soul could dismiss
The advance of her throne from afar
This English rose with traits of those
Who graced the harems of the East
Adorned with thorns she raised the horns
And scarlet hems to wasted priests
Fall for the love of me
Crawl for the love of me
Drool for the love of my virulent sway
I grow more master the faster the days
Lilith Immaculate
This delectable reaper
Her eyes were profound
They drew him in deeper
Until he was drowned
Hurled on the shore
Of the world underground
Lilith Immaculate
Fall for the love of me
Crawl for the love of me
Drool for the love of my virulent sway
I grow more master the faster the days
Lilith Immaculate
The flutes and sweet wine
Of her voice anodyne
Her power was growing
Every hour malign
The truth Lilith's kingdom
Drew closer with time <start> Good evening and welcome to a test of the minds
This match begins as our thoughts begin to grind
I send a pawn towards you a subtle piece of my attack
Pondering the next move I guess you'll never know unless you try
It
Knight jumps queen if you know what I mean
Anticipation of the final scene
Knight jumps queen so get prepared
For this checkmate has been happily declared
As the knight jumps the queen
You have made selections a white castle crumbles at your feet
To Counter the men in black your moves must all be elite
A bishop takes a rook and this cuts him down to size
This is no tailormade situation
I guess I have some real competition for once
Knight jumps queen if you know what I mean
Anticipation of the final scene
Knight jumps queen so get prepared
For this checkmate has been happily declared
As the knight jumps the queen
Hours and hours to a stalemate this game has come to a close
Could it end without a climax between to exhausted foes
Nighttime's falling on the castle it's bringing in another day
The concentration was impossible I never had a doubt I wouldn't
Win it from you
Knight jumps queen if you know what I mean
Anticipation of the final scene
Knight jumps queen so get prepared
For this checkmate has been happily declared
As the knight jumps the queen <start> He bears a tale so gloom and tragic never to be known
Into darkness now fallen into hatred now grown
Like stillborn child drifting in the silent seas
Of blood crushing all his dreams
No castle walls can hold the fury in his eyes
Devotion for death now controls his life
No gold or silver can bring him consolation
Only one thing is left inside him the desire of revenge
One light so cold and pale sleeping quietly all alone
One life so cold and gray wandering away from home
Parted with a horrid cry snow falls on his grief
United by the sword of wicked screams
What deeds he has done to hear those deadful sounds
In the ruins of memories he wanders forever bound
Forever bound to death
Wait for me in the mountains haunt for me in the winds
Wait for me in the land where nothing lives
Until the day I have found revenge I will feed my sword
Until my heart is cold every breath of mine is yours

Open your eyes

Look at what's in front of you
An endless journey
Our end
What do you see
What do you feel
Were we ever really alive
You know this is the right choice

Let's float to no more
Goodbye to everything <start> I want to keep my money
And give away absolutely nothing
To the government who moderates my spending
and obliterates depending on what time of the year
brutality is near
in the form of income tax
I'd rather take a fucking axe
to my face blow up this place
with you all in it I'd do it in a minute
If I could write off your murder
I'd save all of my receipts
because I'd rather you be dead
than lose a tiny shred of what I made this fiscal year
I'd rather you be dead than ponder parting with my second home
I'd rather you be dead than consider not opening a restaurant
I'd rather you be dead
I'd rather you be dead
Prepare the laserbeam
I'm gonna use it tonight
Engage the laserbeam
It's gonna end your life
I'm gonna use it tonight
If I could write off your murder
I'd save all of my receipts

words escaping form a drowning man
giving in
losing hope
surrendering

so hard to see what's leaving you

so hard to feel what's killing us
the slow collapsing of our lives
my hands have lost their substance
they slowly lose all shape before my eyes
always shaking
always thinning
always numb
always fading

I've counted thousands dead from righteous plague

I am the power who blacks the night
I am the anger for all your fights
I am the power who parts the seas
I am the savoir for all your needs

I was there at the death of the wisest sage
Over and over now it'll be the same
Mankind's on the path to the final shame
I've been to hell I've touched the sun
I've seen heavens fall I am the one

Never forget my name. A thousand cannonballs rain down on my deck. Of the
Seven Provincies the republic's battleship number one. But they do no harm
Cause Satan's wings protect. His servant's life from the English last
Convulsion.
A firebreath a crimson sky in a lake of fire you will die. The English
Pride consumed by flames you'll never forget my name. Firebreath spritting
Forks of fire. Firebreath attacking a crumbling empire. Firebreath the
Dutchman's anger. Firebreath a fire's breath <start> As the smoke has cleared
The dust lays heavy in the air
I wake up covered in blood and sweat
Can't reminisce what really happened
So hold me tight as my life runs short
Listen now and be strong
There's something you should know
A secret well kept you're not one of us
You're a dragon's son
The sunset is upon me
Was it all worth is this the last light I'll see
So take me away
Never again never again these sights before me is for real
Death spreads her wings as far as my eyes can see
Never again never again these visions haunts me day and night
This day I always will remember in my graveheart
You can see it in his eyes and hear it in his voice
When joy's no longer felt
When a heart is empty empty and closed
That day still echoes in my mind
Those few words cut right through my all
And my world ceased to be as you killed my inside
I can no longer feel
The sunset is upon me
Was it all worth is this the last light I'll see
So take me away
Never again never again these sights before me is for real
Death spreads her wings as far as my eyes can see
Never again never again these visions haunts me day and night
This day I always will remember in my graveheart <start> Eko Azarak

Darksome night and ardent moon
The chalice is passed then ye fall North
Hearken to the enchantress' rune 
Listen to the words to cry ye forth.
Earth and water ether and fire
Wand and pentacle and sword
Toil ye unto our desire
Hearken ye unto our word.
Unfettered and censet scourge and knife
Powers of the enchantress' blade 
Waken all ye into life
Come ye as the charm is made. <start> Forever we're lost beyond a day
Tomorrow will bring bitternes and fragments of hate
Our sickening lives will die behind
Silhouettes of evergrey and scars from yesterday
The dreams we keep inside will surely pass us by
And when truth becomes a lie we all die
The remains of yesterday will keep us all awake
Reality will quake and we all bleed...we will bleed
Sadness the joy that I lack are traded for
A meathook buried in my back
Nothing can ease your pain dancing on the edge
Soon to go insane
Downwards we go
I'm fading for sure
Downwards we all go
Evergrey
Time passes us by and each day we die
Side by side slowly we die
Dying we're dying
Piece by piece we're fading away season of decay
Fading we're fading
Nothingness takes our last breath we're soon to be no more
Forever lost beyond our lives never to return
Life is pain
In the evergrey
Life is pain
In the evergrey
The dreams we keep inside will surely pass us by
And when truth becomes a lie we all die
The remains of yesterday will keep us all awake
Reality will quake and we all bleed
Downwards we go
I'm fading for sure
Downwards we all go
Evergrey <start> He never killed anyone but he hurt some
Body's feelings once
Pushed in the corner with his shame dressed
Up like a dunce
Is it crowth or decay when
You peel off the skin
Magazines dvds jeez
Where have you been
Easy to spot the perverts today
They're ripe like low hanging fruit
Keep dirty secrets tucked away or lie and
Murder all with the truth
An exercise in debauchery
If all's revealed a grim catastrophe
Bizarro ways ends up in misery
It's an exercise in debauchery
You won't care about this later
When you're finished I'm sure
You need to figure things out
But your vision's a blur
Will you come out of this phase
Is what I ask of myself
It's your addiction to smut man
You really need help
Hard not to run from creeps today
They're cross so give him the boot
You claim your actions are
Safe and sound
But that's not getting down to the root
No it's an exercise in debauchery
Hanging out with ugly company
We should talk and deal accordingly
With your exercise in debauchery
In fairness and kidding aside
Your choices are something to hide
In fairness it's painful to watch
Won't be there the day you get caught
You're hiding behind the sun
Look at what you've become
When darkness gives way to glare
You'll be there
Beware
An exercise in debauchery
If all's revealed a grim catastrophe
Bizarre ways a form of sorcery
It's a exercise in debauchery <start> This lifeless soil
Barren of good thoughts
Scorched By grudge and grief
Doomed to linger on
Wandered aimlessly
Blinded By their lies
Now I raise my head And sword
When shadows steal the light
Fire
Desire
Denial
In my heart
Burning
Yearning
Discerning
I see it now
You call it cruelty
I call it strength
I am cursed to be
A one man Army
You call me inhumane
I call this life regained
I am blessed to be
A one man Army
I will take the lives lives of my enemies
Yet still this battle feels like a defeat to me
Death or victory only emptiness I feel
The spring of hope runs dry
Because I'm already dead inside <start> Once more I'll say goodbye to you
Things happen but we don't really know why
If it's supposed to be like this
Why do most of us ignore the chance to miss
Oh yeah
Torn apart at the seams of my dreams turn to tears
I'm not feelin' this situation
Run away try to find that safe place you can hide
It's the best place to be when you're feeling like
Me

Yeah

All these things I hate revolve around
Me

Yeah

Just back off before I snap
Once more you tell those lies to me
Why can't you just be straight up with honesty

When you say those things in my ear
Why do you always tell me what you wanna hear

Oh yeah

Wear your heart on your sleeve make things hard to believe
I'm not feelin' this situation
Run away try to find that safe place you can hide
It's the best place to be when you're feeling like
Me

Yeah

All these things I hate revolve around
Me

Yeah

Just back off before I snap
And you'll see

Torn apart of the seams of my dreams turn to tears

PANIC STARTS TO SET IN
THE TIME TO TRUST'S AT HAND
WHEN YOU SEE ME THERE
KNOW THAT IT'S FOR YOU
AND I'LL NO LONGER FEAR IT
THEY'LL BEAT ME DOWN AND BREAK MY SKIN
AN EFFORT TO DESTROY
AND THOUGH I FEEL ALONE
AND MINUTES FEEL LIKE DAYS
MY HEART STILL PROSPERS
THE BODY IS A SHELL
THE SOUL MUST ENDURE
UNTIL THE TIME'S OVER
THOUGH HE TEMPTED BEFORE
AND KNOWS HE CANNOT WIN
THE LION'S HUNGRY
THE THINGS I'VE DONE THROUGHOUT THIS LIFE
HAVEN'T ALWAYS BEEN PURE
AND THOUGH I'M UNDER THIS CLOUD
MY DARKEST SHROUD
THE LIGHT IS COMING
AND SO I REACH FOR YOU
MY HOUR OF NEED HAS COME NOW
AND I NEED YOU
SO LET ME DIE LIKE A MAN
AND THE GLORY BE YOURS
FOR I KNOW NOW MY PLACE IN YOU
SO LET THEM HATE ME NOW
AND LET THEM HURT ME NOW
FOR I WILL NEVER CHANGE MY HEART
AND THAT'S A SOLEMN VOW
AND IF YOU SEE ME STANDING THERE
KNOW IT'S NOT THE END
I WILL LIVE INSIDE YOUR HEART
UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN
AND SO I REACH FOR YOU
MY HOUR OF NEED HAS COME NOW
AND I NEED YOU
SO LET ME DIE LIKE A MAN
AND THE GLORY BE YOURS
FOR I KNOW NOW MY PLACE IN YOU
IM HOME
TAKE ME NOW COZ I'M READY TO GO
THESE ARE MY FINAL WORDS
REGRET NOTHING IN THE FACE OF THIS FEAR
ALL PAIN NOW DISAPPEARS
I CAN TASTE THE DEATH INSIDE OF MY MOUTH
IT'S OVERWHELMING WIPE THE SWEAT FROM MY BROW
AS IT GETS CLOSE I FEEL I WANT TO GIVE IN
BUT MY HEART SCREAMS NOT YET
LIFE'S A GIFT GIVEN FREELY TO ALL
MAKE THE CHOICE TO RISE OR FALL
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT IT IS TAKEN AWAY
SO WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TELL ME
IT'S GETTING DARKER I'M ABOUT TO PASS OUT
MY BODY'S NUMB AS IT BEGINS TO SHUT DOWN
MY LAST BREATH ESCAPES MY DYING BODY
MY MIND SLEEPS NOW MY HEART IS FREE.......... <start> Red beams pierce through the sky moving us away from what we have already reached
The place we stand is way too far from where we want it to be
What makes things take an unexpected turn
Man try to think
Why dont you just believe
The good old days
They aint no more
The war has become visible
It has touched upon the sore spots of you
We will move ahead just like we did
Just like we did before
The good thing is
The good thing is we have our heads screwed on right
Weve got some common sense
But anyway were trying to bring everything back
Things will never be the same
Use the hints that sky gives you
The war has become visible
It has touched upon the sore spots of you
We will move ahead just like we did
Just like we did before <start> Everything that comes out of your mouth is amazing.
See your pale face passing over over again.
I'm sorry you're dead.
Bite the curb. Snap. You should have loved me.
Oops it's too late and now your mouth is big enough to suck mine and his necks.
I never met a tent spike I would like to put in your stomach
I'm smiling at you now and does it make anything different
You are so beautiful now peaceful and calm.
When your back snaps think of me. I'm sorry you're dead. <start> Soul of mine
When road's lonely
She came to me in the skyline
Her look was divine
Her black hair
Danced with the wind
And the cold air
Of autumn
Played with leaves while my soul skinned
Her eyes were my glare
Her sweet voice
Pronounced my name
My soul was a choice
She called me
While her white dress was my blame
She could be my dame
Chorus
Grey
Dusk is over the way
White ghost
In my heart
My loving soul was hurt
Dark hopes beyond my mind.
And so I resigned
All for her cold dream's love
I went there
Each evening
My only care
Don't see her
While my heart played in a swing
Falling in despair
Then I dreamed
With her sad death
And my soul screamed
Harrowing
While she gave me her cold breath
She kissed me
Chorus
But grey
Dusk is over the way
White ghost
In my heart My loving soul was hurt
Dark hopes beyond my mind.
And so I resigned
All for her cold dream's love <start> You can always see through to me but when I look back I am lost.
Do you remember those times when we said one thing and meant another
How much longer can you hide behind that oneway mirror
We told stories to each other.
But we never said the truth.
We just sat there lying.
I hate it when you hide behind your words it makes me sick.
Just say it.
Your words are a mirage of lies. <start> Ay ay ay
Ooh woo ohh ohh ohh
Ooh woo ohh ohh ohh
Ooh woo ohh ohh ohh

With pool table adjacent I love me some money

I I I I got the love for money <start> A decrepit man intently stares
At the now calm lifeless horizon
While most of his memories no longer exist
There is one never fading
I was alive with youthful integrity
A cold december night
Accosted my senses whisper of the wind
Shaped my reality
Took by surprise decayed pretenses
I deciphered the meaning
To my advantage delivered false promises
Baited the trap
Deceptively clever I engaged the victim
Gained pure conviction
With deceitful lies I taught myself
To be abhorrent
Took admiration of helpless thoughts
Sufferance was comfort
Like blankets in winter a cold heart hidden
Misfortune always evident always there
Each day a new veil hiding the past
Compassion had vanished
Leaving no trace my newfound guile
Is my future
There is no shame when harm is blind
Contemplate the unknown
Whose eternal rest would always stir
A mind at ease
If only he knew his only victim
Was in the mirror
They say selfreflection is good for the soul
And cleanses the blood
But if your heart is oblivious To your grasp of life
Then the gray shadows down at your feet
Fade into black and vanish
Desolation unaware
As you look at yourself endure the pain
See the fear deep in your eyes
As you hide behind a blank disguise <start> started off as little but look
how it's grown...
you were so carefree in your sin
now you reap the seeds you've sown
you thought you had control
but who's controlling who
your life is like a vice
closing in on you
bottles then the needles
as you watch your loved ones die
you're slowly sliding down a pit
screaming as you slide...
you lie awake at night it's damp
it's cold
you're looking back at the
seeds you've sown
it's hard to sleep when there's
fire in your head
what can you do
when your life is hanging
by a thread
nightmares leave you screaming
so real but who can tell
nausea the sickened state
your life's a living hell
swimming in your vomit
it's the same thing everyday
your life is just a cancer
that slowly eats away
lying on the floor
with your head between
your knees realization hits
with crushing force
your world can't fill your needs
on that floor Christ appears
saying simply come to me <start> Let me tell you a story about an ugly woman I know
Hello Girls
Hello Tobi you hot little machine
I'm a sight for sore eyes
Oh if your eyes would only see
I've been born on tiptoe
Still you looked
Like a lighthouse next to me
You pet named me Napoleon
I was proud
Til I got the reason why
Never aimed for confrontation
You've been sleeping
When I kissed your ass goodbye
Oh while you read this letter
I'd just gone to eat out
By the way
My what a sunshine in Trinidad
Hope you're okay light years away
My what a heat wave in Trinidad
Hope you don't mind if I stay
Pitcher goes too often to the well
And now the Pitcher's gone insane
Gotta run away
Boiling over getting hell
And found the answer on a plane
Oh I've been pissing off
Before you might
Could have pissed me off
I hope you're fine yeah
My what a sunshine in Trinidad
Mind if you stay I do okay
My what a heat wave in Trinidad
Sunburnt a night flight away
Honey you're looking good so far away from me
The weather is great the beach is great the food is great
Everything is great and you're so far away I love you honey
Greetings from Trinidad hey
My what a sunshine in Trinidad
Mind if you stay I do okay
My what a heat wave in Trinidad
Sunburnt a night flight away
Back and home in Germany I was a famous porn star <start> Eyes full of hate quick to condemn
Just stay in the dark and wait for an end
You don't really care it's jut give and take
Keeping the distance keeping it fake
Waiting for something that doesn't quite jell
Just cursing existence and hating your hell
Blinded by anger you don't really know
It's play by play as you put on a show
Your making your stand for nothing at all
Delighted with problems a chance for a fall
Causing a scene to distribute the pain
It's all for one such a nice little game
Your time flies by with nothing gained
Just talk of change and who's to blame
It's the same old story we know so well
With a premade ending you don't want to tell <start> Reach deep within where reality is hard to find
Search in the corners of the winding mazes of your mind
Seek out the treasures that open doors that some keep sealed
Believe in your dreams and a wonder world will be revealed
Come to the boundless land somewhere inside your fantasies
Built by dreams and magic the secret place that none have seen
Chase the horizons catch the illusion
Remember the child within
There's no tomorrow just sadness and sorrow
Hold on to the ancient dreams
Great kings and tyrants unicorns and elf lords
Devils and demons dungeons and dragons
Phoenix is rising up from the ashes of the wind
Born into glory then back to ashes once again
High flies the dragon the ruler of the seven skies
Riding the winds not knowing that he just can't die
Chase the horizons catch the illusion
Remember the child within
There's no tomorrow just sadness and sorrow
Hold on to the ancient dreams
See how the wizard cast his spell with maddened eyes
Using his magic to reach the heavenly skies
Witness the alchemist turning all his lead to gold
Try after try begging that his fantasy will hold
See how the rainbow bends it shape into the sea
Follow the sign and your dreams will be reality
Chase the horizons catch the illusion
Remember the child within
There's no tomorrow just sadness and sorrow
Hold on to the ancient dreams <start> Wake the dreamer
From sleep comes the secret held deep in the psyche
Restless vision
The pain of regaining the truth in the message
What we all are
Descendents of creatures so cruel and self serving
Infected again and again
Chorus
Know your master
You're not equal
Know your master
Face your father
Beneath the ruins
Revealed before time might destroy all the remnants
Predecessors
Creators of space and lords of dimension
Godless fathers
Transcribing the answers
Written in mind and in body in gene the code that erodes with your humanity
The change is upon us
Arranged with the dawning
Revealed to us all <start> Meadows of candles around me
I'm drowning in my dreams <start> The only thing that makes white more bright
is the color of fire as humans ignite
People scream as they burn
The frown on my face inverses its turn
The beautiful smell incineration and death
As the searing flesh of one hooded freak peels off
I sit nearby and gawk
Disposable useless all wastes of air
One by one they fall as I snare
What a waste of water
Wastes of food
No longer needing to waste for them occurs soon
As fire hoses wash pieces of corpse down the street
The dogs and I now have new meat <start> War the name of the game
Take you down to the wire
There's gonna be hell to pay
Gonna set your world on fire
Bombs blowin' it up
The order annihilation
This is the wayx we'll fuck you up
Welcome to your devastation
CHORUS
Fly fly with the warbird
Die die by the warbird x

Fire give it all you got
We're gonna make this fuckers burn
Raining death from high above
Way past the point of no return
Rush unleash the power
You'll never see the coming attack
At three thousand miles an hour
You'll never feel the goddamned impact
REPEAT CHORUS
Perish in a firey hell
No turning back
You'll never live no story to tell
Get ready second attack
Boom. They begin to strike
The ultimate supremacy
Never before have they seen the like
It's the ultimate insanity
REPEAT CHORUS <start> Nightmare came to me
Where's the light I can not see
Madness in my head
I don't know I'm live or dead
I can not hear this voice
I wanna fly
All I need's to die
Chorus
Nowhere and nowhere again
Now I can feel only pain
I can not live without you
I'll die without you it's true
I wanna be without you
Lightning broke my mind
I can't fly  it's too high
When the candle fades
I can see your face
I feel your warm breath
On my leaps
All I have  these dreams
Chorus.
Solo W. Angel
Chorus. <start> Well everybody's talking about the working man
Nobody's talking about Rollin' Dan
Everybody's talking about the working man
Nobody's talking about Rollin' Dan
Rollin' Dany
He was the rollin' man
Well Dan walked into the old dancehall
Told the women he loved 'em all
Two six women did a dance and crawl
And I'ma telling ya man this cat'd fool 'em all
Rollin' Dany
He was the rollin' man
Go
And three four five six cats linked up against the wall
And mothers you dared the girls
But if you loved ya women and ya loved 'em right
And I'ma telling ya man they were in for a fight
From a Rollin' Dany
He was the rollin' man
Go
Well everybody's talking about the working man
Nobody's talking about Rollin' Dany
Everybody's talking about the working man
Nobody's talking about Rollin' Dany
Rollin' Dany
He was the rollin' man
Rollin' Dany
He was the rollin' man
Rollin' Dany
He was the rollin' man
Rollin' Dany man
He was the rollin' man <start> the day you took my breath
when all we built broke inside
the day you took my breath
when all the earth fell down for me
the day you took my breath
the fading breath of a candle blown
the day you took my breath
when all my fragile dreams were dreamt
I cry me a river
I cry me a lake
I cry me an ocean
and the salt in its water are the words you said
a new street
a longing search
the breath of time
back to a crossroad
I've gone to blackest waters
please don't kill me again <start> When the night's slowly falling shadows grow
Longer in the cold moonlight
The nightbirds are singing their said tunes  then the
Time has come for the charnel's ball.
White bones in the moonlight
Dressed up also in white
Dancing upon their own tombs
Waltzing across the
Graveyard is
Filled with joy
Corpses are looking like toys
Undead girls and boys
Dance in the charnel's ball
You're asleep and you don't hear a thing then the
Dead are crawling out of their tombs.
We think death is for eternity but midnight welcomes
The dead to dance.
White bones in the moonlight
Dressed up also in white
Dancing upon their own tombs
Waltzing across the
Graveyard is
Filled with joy
Corpses are looking like toys
Undead girls and boys
Dance in the charnel's ball <start> 
Youre half a world away in another hemisphere.
Its not the same but still you play and I can hear you loud and clear.
I was hoping that youd stay in my own fantasy.
With the truth I pushed away to make room for what I believe.
It was you that got me through.

When I cant be sure what it is this life means
What the pain is for why were always fighting
Youve had enough that you could be so mad.
And everything can make me so sad.
And I cant be sure of anythinganymore.

Was all this time a waste as I look at whats left here.
Its a nothingness that I face all Ive held here has disappeared.
Youve risked a lot on faith given mostly everything.
And Im reminded that you stayed to hold me when I couldnt hang.
If where weve been couldnt get us through.

When I cant be sure what it is this life means
What the pain is for why were always fighting
Youve had enough that you could be so mad.
And everything can make me so sad.
And I cant be sure of anythinganymore.


Then every dream came true.
Every dream I dreamed for you.

When I cant be sure what it is this life means
What the pain is for why were always fighting
But Ive had enough to make me so mad.
And still everything can seem so sad.
And I cant be sure of anythinganymore.

When I cant be sure what it is this life means
What the pain is for why were always fighting
When youve had enough to make all this go bad.
Why am I still so sad
I cant be sure of anythinganymore. <start> Hear me say it's ok there just is no other way
I believe and strongly feel some things just aren't meant to be
All the time in our lives something somewhere draws a line
I believe in time you'll see sometimes some thing are best let be
You may find between the lines lotsa things you missed first time
But that's ok now hear me say we all learn from our mistakes
Yes I'll be all right
Yes I think I'll be all right
I hope I'll be all right
Yes I wish I'll be all right
It's ok
Comed this far it's who we are and what and how that takes us far
So just proceed leave history behind but make sure your hands are clean
Halt for a while now would you try to change things given one more try
Sure I know the level is low but never fail and you'll never know
You may find between the lines...
Yes I'll be all right...
All the time in our lives...
You may find between the lines...
Yes I'll be all right... <start> Talk about humanity what's wrong and what is right
You take a human being and strip them of their life
A tormented soul trapped and left to decay
In a controlled environment to die in a demented way
Death row he's awating time just drags by
Gas chamber awaits for him to pay for his crime
When will the madness end will it be today
What terrible thoughts living day by day
Chorus
The crime was committed forever left condemned
Left and forgotten the fortune never ends
Sentenced to death delayed for seventeen years
Left to go insane now death's his greatest fear
 thousand dollars monthly that we pay
To keep him alive now that's insane
Injustice prevails again it's the American way
No wonder we're in debt why do we have to pay
If the death penalty exists to make these convicts pay
Kill them when convicted instead of awaiting
To wait seventeen years is totally inhumane
The crime has lost its meaning it's ruthless to be so vain
Repeat chorus
Solo Skowron
Repeat first verse
Repeat chorus <start> Until my eyes be closed
spectral shadows cover
my weary soul.
Long time ago
my destiny was marked for
degeneration
my weary soul.
autumn
The gelid arms of the infamy
drown me in dark deep waters
my weary soul.
The flesh is colored
with the blood of disgrace.
You won't come back over
groove of my entrails
my eternal autumn. <start> Prognathous gears grind
So diligent and serrated they mesh
Toothed cogs churn
So trechant against soft flesh
Worked to the bone
Up to the hilt depredated
Raw materialism
To stoke the furnaces
Toiling rotting
Life slowly slips away
Consumed inhumed
In this mechanized corruption line
By mincing machinery industrialized pulped and pulverized
Enslaved to the grind
Blood sweat toil tears
Arbeit macht fleisch
Grave to the grind
Inimitable gears twist
To churn a living grave
Stainless cogs shredding
Scathing pistons bludgeon and flail
Stripping to the bone
Retund mandrels levigate
Just raw material
Your pound of flesh for the suzerain
Toiling rotting
Life slowly dissipates
Consumed inhumed
In a corruption line mechanized
By mincing machinery industrialized crunched and brutalised
A grave to the blind <start> Lyrics Grutle Kjellson

darkness without end before the Morning
of time
the Cold Empire's eleven rivers frozen
frost mist spreads itself wide out
The gust from Nivlhel in the North
fills the mighty gap
Licking tongues of fire from the South
boiling bubbling venom
All life has its origin in a source of
JOTUNBLOOD
Your mind's own evil inner
JOTUNBLOOD
Streams from Hvergelmes Source
united with nauseating drops of venom
The first the Father of all families
created by the Two Elements
With himself he breeded
our proud ancestors
Our Primitive Force's deep roots
with energy from the cattle's four rivers
A knife through the dark
A shrill scream
A pale face foams
He wanders proudly over Ymer's bones
All life has its origin in a source of
JOTUNBLOOD
Your mind's own evil inner
JOTUNBLOOD
If one seeks all Midgard's knowledge
If the Wise Woman swings her staff
One can not avoid one's origin
The chaos of the Primitive Force
JOTUNBLOOD
Music Ivar Bjrnson  <start> Why must I endure this strife
From the ignorance
In their minds
They believe that I am dead
That a smell of nothingness
Is left
One could not believe
What the catatonic sees
Through my eyes
I see eternity
A surreal world
That fate could not perceive
Tainted life
Unfolds this tapestry
The fear runs so deep
In the souls of the weak
Blind are their eyes
It is answers that they seek
I could answer all
But they refuse to see the way
The lies of Christ
Keep them in disarray
Though this is my prophecy
They make a mockery
Of what seems to have become of me
They want to take my life
Cover up their lies
Avoid the truth I have inside
Probing my dark mind
To see what they could find
On my pain they somehow seem to thrive
They live with no regrets
They think they've cheated death
But now the truth has come alive
The worlds begin colliding
Their screams heard in space
The atmosphere collapsing
Burning through the face
Their souls will never rest now
For them an ageless plight
Their peaceful sleep awakened
By the destructive light... <start> Slowly as my sister night comes
With her coil of shadow and sorrow
I feel myself I taste the power
In the cold of moonlight I'm strong
In the dark of shadow I'm real
Now that my sister has come
I've drunk the chalice of supremacy
I'm on a level higher my nerves are in wait
I've the power to ride the winds of hate
I ride the winds of hate
I ride the winds of hate
I ride the winds of hate
Hail hate
In my darkness I find myself
Hear the cold of shadow as well
Eternal time eternal guest
When my sister will take my hands
My self
My self
My self
Slowly... <start>  <start> Lead vocals Mauricio Taborda
Metal against the metal
Bleeding the steel...
They came from everywhere
Marching down on the hill
Kill kill pay the price
It's time for sacrifice
Archers and cavalry
Screams of Agony
Fight Fight spirits of knights
Let set us free
...And the Dark Valley burns
Metal against the metal
Bleeding the steel
Metal against the metal
Our proud stands still
Fire ripping the air
Falling down from the sky
Die die winged knights
Our revenge will come with might
Under the red sky
The battle is close to end
Run Run surrender in pain
We'll wait for you again
...And the Dark Valley burns
Metal against the metal
Bleeding the steel
Metal against the metal
Our proud stands still
Solo 
Metal against the metal
Bleeding the steel
Metal against the metal
Our proud stands still <start> Broadway Mary is conversing with her sleeve
She talks with cats they speak to her in Portuguese
Her eyes are clear and grey focused somewhere far away
I wonder where she is today
She loves the sound of thunder
She says God is laughing now
It breaks the silence of the passing crowd
It keeps her warm somehow
Broadway Mary walks alone below the tower
She looks so beautiful I follow her for hours
She won't notice me as I watch silently
she is almost free
She loves the sound of thunder
She says God is laughing now
It breaks the silence of the passing crowd
It keeps her warm somehow
Broadway Mary lies in the shadow of a door
And Mary flies on wings she never had before
I love the sound of thunder
I know Mary's laughing now
It breaks the silence of the passing crowd
It keeps me warm somehow <start> You feel confusion and new torment as your mind decays
Devolution of your life  begins today  begins today
Hear the sircas scream in vain
Despair for your life
Hope is futile as missiles strike
A cruel twist of the knife
Those that dominate direct their hate
Life obliterate humans terminate
Hope for a future is what you say
With your world in ruins what a price to pay
As you crawl through the wreckage  you can't believe
Could mankind really be so naive
This world now twisted brought to its knees
With the people in power left to oversee
A world totally deformed no hope of being reborn
The heart from it now torn this world now we all mourn
Look to the future on your knees now pray
With this world in ruins what a price to pay
Your world's now in ruins
What a price you paid <start> Omfamnad av vind och bitter frost
Under arklisk och obarmhrtig mne
Hon sitter vid isens rand uppvaktar sin kvinna
Ddsjungfruns kalla hand ondlighetens lskarinna
Han vill sjunka knna
Hennes anda av is
Sitt liv i byte mot en gva
En frusen kyss
Inatt I evighet han sova
Med en viskan s djup som havens vrn
Ensam men tv i ddens mrka snr
Han hr ett ord med makt s mrk
Ur ddsjungfruns vila mund
Han vill sjunka knna
Hennes anda av is
Sitt liv i byte mot en gva
En frusen kyss
Inatt I evighet han sova
Hon lyfter honom med kraft och vilja
Smeker med kyla br honom bort
Till sina fders vita sal
ver rymdens mktiga hav
Till riket dr ingen sjrna lysa
English translation
The Frozen Mouth
Embraced again by wind and bitter frost
Under the arctic and unmerciful moon
He sits at the edge of the ice serves her lady
Cold hand of the maiden of death lover of eternity
He wants to sink feel
Her icy breath
His life in exchange for a gift
A frozen kiss
Tonight in eternity he sleeps
With a whisper so deep like the corners of the ocean
Two lone men at the thickness of death
He heard a word with a might so dark
From the mouth of the maiden of death
He wants to sink feel
Her icy breath
His life in exchange for a gift
A frozen kiss
Tonight in eternity he sleeps
She lifts him with power and will
Strokes with coldness carries him away
To the white hall of her fathers
Over the mighty sea of space
To an empire where no star shines <start> Instrumental <start> Mankind made it hell
but in beauty it began
And in beauty a new day will arrive
We will protect ourselves with modesty
We will treat creations with respect
ohh
May our children be raised in beauty
May we all speak in beauty
Beauty before me
Beauty behind me
Beauty above me
Beauty beneath me
oh beauty all around me
May it all end up in beauty.. <start> Rage has ruled me for so long that I don't want to think anymore.
I've tried to claw my way out but I am sealed
in. It seems the game is designed to make me lose.
It's weight slowly drags me down. I draw a breath as I slip under. The dim
light fades as descent begins. I have to fight my way through.
Stark flesh sinks through the freezing liquid darkness. Pale
hands bound before me rushing deeper with every heartbeat.
I will not relent to despair. As depression contricts it's coils
close in around me. Depression contricts.
My will is the blade that cuts the coils from around me. <start> in a dream a beauty lives
lots have tried to kiss her lips
and touch her naked body
in a dream a beauty lives
she'll fill your mind complete
unforgettable she is
you've sold your soul
this could have been your swan song
your god won't listen to your prayers
depraved you are
this could have been your swan song
you've entered a labyrinth
there's only one way out
you've sold your soul
a demon from the underworld
totally irresistible
beautiful and frightening
a demon from the underworld
she'll lead you to the one and only
Infernal Majesty
you've sold your soul
slowly you'll understand
you've sold your soul
you're one with the Beast
forget what's left behind
forget your former life
your soul's made free
the world's waiting for YOU
enjoy the pleasures of the flesh
in a dream a beauty lives
lots have tried to kiss her lips
and touch her naked body
in a dream a beauty lives
she'll fill your mind complete
unforgettable she is
you've sold your soul <start> We're going faster like a bullet 'round
To save the future for the humankind
Faster
Depleted every source endangered our own lives
A soil that is burned destruction unrepairable
War of the worlds orchestral demise
So what comes up always falls straight back down
Losing the hope to save what's left for you and me
Dancing on strings above the abyss I cry
Reach for the skies
We're going faster like a bullet 'round
To save the future for the humankind
We set ourselves on fire for our last goodbye
We're going faster like a bullet 'round
To save the future for the humankind
We're giving our hearts away we're going faster
Defeated every threat and made this habitat burn
This cynical form mankind made sure we never turn
Mission is set we colonize afar
An epiphany for us all as there is no withdraw
Losing the hope to save what's left for you and me
Dancing on strings above the abyss I cry
Reach for the skies
We're going faster like a bullet 'round
To save the future for the humankind
We set ourselves on fire for our last goodbye
We're going faster like a bullet 'round
To save the future for the humankind
We're giving our hearts away we're going faster
Losing the hope to save what's left for you and me
Dancing on strings above the abyss I cry
Reach for the skies
We're going faster like a bullet 'round
To save the future for the humankind
We set ourselves on fire for our last goodbye
We're going faster like a bullet 'round
To save the future for the humankind
We're giving our hearts away we're going faster <start> I flew alone
Just like lonely crow
The wood lay ahead me
And the mighty wind behind
The road I saw
It was so clean and real
I didn't want to lose it
And the thoughts
Which didn't let me sleep on rest
Flew faster than
My real time itself
And fasten than the wind
They chose the space the skies
As their goal
And took all of my passions within them <start> I am not easily fooled. I see no difference between you and all the others aside from you being the alpha male of just a different pack of wolves. You said that this conflict would end with you yet since you've come to be I've seen more of my friends and family sent to war. Our economy has worsened yet government spending keeps increasing. How can a capitalist nation punish small business with higher taxes and like cattle drive their business to the companies in your pockets Your posters line the streets like something's changed since you've taken office yet we've seen no difference. This country was founded on the escapism of trusting one man yet now I see entire familes hang your portrait above their dinner table. You swore you would better all our lives and children's. Still half the middles class's earning go to the Federal Reserve. The world has seen idle worship like this before in Nazioccupied Europe in the s. This is cultism at it's finest a wave of nations putting all their faith into your hands. You lying bastard. Those many suffering supported you simply to end this war. Your charismatic features on TV screens smiling softly and speaking of hope and change held above their heads like a promise to bring back their dead children. <start> He who lives alone longs only for mercy the mercy of falling on his side.
The brave have perished in laurelcrowned glory
yet the brave shall carrythe name of Eire into eternity.
Eternity is like a flame it's essence is so limitless.
Eternity is a deathless pith covering the Southern and burning shores of his
paradise the Tir Na N'og. When legends of steel were strong it was louder
than any uproar of thunder.
...of Celtic fire he was born. He will live on... FOREVER. <start> On to
On to the mindfield
Into
Into the hole
Chemical
Chemical cauldron
Location still unknown
Out of the tunnel into the light
World destruction now seems right
A barren landscape of burning hell
Within our dreams
We feel the spell
Watching
Watching their minds blow
Sinking
Lower than low
Hooded mutations
Ride by nights
Scouring the earth
For impure life
They seek they search
And will destroy
Immoral acts they will employ
Constricting
Freedom of movement
Convulsing
Body in pain <start> I can see I'm not free.
I believe in no one but me.
All eyes on me.
Pointing at me.
Falling you see.
Your words deceive.
Chorus
And I say what I want to say
Doesn't matter what you think
Cause is still live this way.
And then you come into my life
Stick me in the back with your knife.
And now as I look at you
All these things that you would put me through.
I won't let you look away.
Won't you fucking watch me bleed
I can see. I'm not free.
I believe in no one but me.
Why dont you take a look at your life for awhile
And you see yourself you're just like a child.
Preach about the things you've never seen
Ignoring all the things that you're supposed to see.
While you watch your watch as time wastes away
And you feel the need to feed on others pain.
Brag about the things but you fucking tried
Brag about the things but you fucking lied.
You're a slave
You're just a slave 
You're just a You're just a
Slave
You're just a slave 
Slave.
Now you take a look at your life once again
And you see the fuckers supposed to be your friends.
Brag about the things but you fucking tried
Now you brag about the things but you fucking lied.
Now you sell your soul
You sell your life away kid.
You sign your name.
And you even sell your pain.
Brag about the things but you fucking tried
You brag about the things but you fucking lied.
Chorus.
I say what I want
Doesn't matter what you think what you got.
And all that you do to me
All these things that I could never see.
And now as I walk away
All these things that I could never say.
I wont let you look away.
Wont you fucking watch me bleed
You're a slave
Weak inside you're a slave.
Feeding your mind you're a slave.
Selling your pain you're a slave.
Signing your name you're a slave.
Open your doors you're a slave.
Weak inside you're a slave
Feeding you're mind you're a slave.
Chorus.
You're a slave.
You're just a you're just a slave. 
SLAVE  <start> Why don't you lay down my darling
You look as if you're at wits end
Sip this I made it especially my decomposing friend
Oh how your eyes respond fondly as your larynx dissolves apart
Vapour emits from your delicate mouth as my loving potion burns out your heart
Kiss me now you know where I love it
it doesn't matter if you bite
For I extracted all your teeth to stop you putting up a fight
Chorus
Playing hard to get I said was useless from the start
Now as you lay still as a slut
with your long legs torn apart
Playing hard to get I said will lead to nothing but strife
But you changed your mind so quickly as you sat upon my knife
I love your sweet cold fingers
they love to dangle and play
Don't fret you didn't really need them
so I devoured them as an entree
I hate what you've done with your hair
Give it another trim me thinks
Take it off at the neckline and put in a bloodred rinse
repeat chorus
'Cause playing hard to get my love was a useless game to play.
You knew you really wanted me
oh your skin's so soft to flay
repeat <start> Music Ivar Peersen  Lyrics Per Arild Husebr
Pallid it hangs
In awe of amusement
Litany swarm
Bleak I say are the crutches of the assembly
And flies cling to it
More so ever the fingers to animate
Insubordinate fickle exequies
Putrid core
Naudr........the ligature it can't break
Lagu...........the whispers it can't hear
Insubordinate fickle exequies
Putrid core

We got you heads bumping now you're jumping from your seats

Throw your hands up in the air
'Cause you know we bring the sounds so unique

If you got the feelin' less of the dreaming
Ah we're getting down tonight
It's just round the corner tell me if you want to
Five will make you feel alright <start> Left alone left to live in a rotting world
Running searching Kurnugia
Reich of death never let you in
Torment you suffer not only God
And His almighty lies can bring endless life
Chemical torture left to search
For the end in a fading world deformed but living
No more suffering no more pain
Never be taking your last breath
You're emerging from the human race
Human race
Welcome to eternal life
Immortality for sale
Resistant to all forms of death
Tormented in the maze of existence
Epidemic reign epidemic reign
Epidemic reign can control the cells within
Never ending search for the other side
Segregated tissues see the final day
Injecting the dose into your mind
A repulsive change begins
In this war against yourself
Internally your body is more healed <start> Now I feel like the whole year is gettin' to an end
 like winter is only a dark and an empty space
Once warm once cold is the freshest breeze of all
bringing me the news of the arriving winter
When leaves cover my mind and dance with the wind
full of lust and happiness I feel sorrow
It let's me hope that it passes soon
...like winter is only a dark and an empty space <start> It's a long hard way
To find a solution
So I feel so stray
Day by day
And when Moon's full
I'm the evil Evil's tool
Causing a dastardly havoc
I can't retaliate
But when I'm a man again
I've got just a rest of pain
When I turn into my shape just
A sense of guilt remains
I feel ferocious
Oh ooh oh howling for the mayhem I've just made
I feel atrocious
Oh ooh oh howling at the moon before it fades
Yes it's a malady
I can not suffer at all
Seek a remedy
And just fall
And when moon's full
I'm the evil's tool
Inside me a harsh beast wailing
I hardly hold in
But when sun appears I'm sane
I'm released from my cruel bane
And I'm able to endeavor
To clean up my soul stain <start> Life's misfortunes always scorn us
Flesh and blood we are
Pain is certain in a world that
Has no guarantee
Whatever fate may be
I know I know I know
I can't find a way out in this world
Can't break your fall
And it's always something
There is no reason
Can't break that mold
Of the freaky things that happen
There is no reason
Breakin' it down
I said we're breakin' it down
When your time's up you might die young
Live while you can
Why are we here is the question
Can you please explain
Whatever fate may be
I know I know I know
I can't find a way out in this world
Can't break your fall
And it's always something
There is no reason
Can't break that mold
Of the freaky things that happen
There is no reason
I took a look inside I told myself a lie
And still I wonder why. who's to blame
There's no forgiveness here. why must we live in fear
Who holds the cards in this unfair game
I know I know I know
I can't find a way out in this world
Can't break your fall
And it's always something
There is no reason
Can't break that mold
Of the freaky things that happen
There is no reason
Breakin' it down
I said we are breakin' it down
Can't find a rhyme or reason
Can't find a rhyme or reason
There ain't no time nor a season
Can't find a rhyme or reason <start> Finally alone  I want you so much
The sweetest bride...
You're pale as the moon
mysterious as the night
your beauty's like a statue
you're cold as ice
You're motionless in your grave
silent like Death
you're rigid in your limbs
you are so dead
I love the dead before they're cold
Their bluing flesh for me to hold
Cadaver eyes upon me see  nothing
I love the dead before then rise
no farewells  no goodbyes
I never even know your rotting face
while friends and lovers mourn your silly grave
I love the dead  I love the dead
You're finished your existence
don't shout for your madness
don't tremble for your fear
bleed for the disease
Now you're free to believe
don't ask me to remain
you're ready to realize
how I love the dead
I love the dead before they're cold
Their bluing flesh for me to hold
Cadaver eyes upon me see  nothing <start> I'm wideawake. Wide. I'm wideawake. I see the moves that you're trying to make. You think I'm sleeping be I'm wideawake. all this spinning makes me dizzy. It makes me sick. Colorcoded fear to ensure you fall in line when they crack the whip. I'm not scared. I'm wideawake. Do you really trust the things they feed you in the news Corporations own the networks that help to skew our views. I'm not fooled. I see the moves that you're trying to make. You think I'm sleeping but I'm wideawake. I know the moves you're trying to make. You want me sleeping but I'm wideawake. Like a fault line moving beneath our feet slipping slowly you barely notice. Until the ground gives way beneath you and the world crumbles down around you. You want me under Put me under. Put me under. Put me under. Wide Awake. <start> Broken man in a trance falling sick once again
Warning sings to the mind comas not far behind
Sleep the eternal sleep
Never to awake never to live
All the shock tension fear
Sickness death always near
Into trance once again
Just one more dying man
Sleeps the eternal sleep
Never to awake never to live
Man on machine living only death
Man on machine never to awake again
Never to awake again
Eternal sleep eternal sleep
Eternal sleep eternal sleep <start> Hands up I can't do that
Wait till tomorrow
Pretends to think a lot
Not user friendly
So when we go in a second
What does that mean to you
You take her from the back
We're so respectable
Why can you not relax
When I'm behind you
I don't make passes from the back
Is it something usual
Remember with this photograph
Take care of photograph
Drowned in plastic
You've got good reason to laugh
Give up I can't do that
Wait until tomorrow
My reputation's in tatters
Where does that leave you
Disentitled. <start> We're coming back
Coming back together it seems
But that was the flame inside of me
You've got to let it pass they said
Well let me ask you this
Can you touch the fire without getting burned
Can you act like these were words you've never heard
Now that it's gone there is no distance
All I can contain is the image of you
Oh this is dangerous
This life won't make us
In all that we hope to be
We are disastrous we are disastrous
I'm so afraid you'll give in way before I'm ready to
So who am I supposed to be now
If I could read the signs you're sending me
Then maybe my heart wouldn't be so God damn ugly
And if I could see your face one more time
Then maybe my life wouldn't be so empty lately
Maybe I wouldn't be so desperately
Seeking for lines to cut out the times
When I was mistaken
These hearts have been breaking
Again and again and again and again
All I can contain is the image of you
Oh this is dangerous
This life won't make us
In all that we hope to be
We are disastrous we are disastrous
All I can contain is the image of you
Oh this is dangerous
This life won't make us

This life won't make us
All I can contain is the image of you
Again and again and again and again
In all that we hope to be
We are disastrous <start> I can see it in your eyes
You've finally learned your lesson
I could forgive and forget
But it's to little to late
I could say I told you so
But I think a big old fuck you
Is much more appropriate <start> A change of heart is no excuse to turn me loose
And I play the part but the fool in me could never hear you
Fools love
My fingers ache from holding on
Fools love
The clouds that hide your love are gone
chorus
It's not over until it's over
Flying in the face of love
It's not over until it's over
Power of the heart is strong enough
All of the time
Feeling wheels are turning over now
Read the signs
There's so much more to rediscover
Say when
It's easy to replace one more
Say when
The answer is worth waiting for
chorus <start> Walls start closing in around you
My twins of evil
They shake you by the collarbone
Then snap your ribcage
And broken bodies in a death rock dance hall
Please be my partner
Eyeballs pop accelerated blood beat
Veins 'a' shaking
And all hell breaks loose
Yea evil is as evil does and who
Yea who but me could write this book of cruel
I send my murdergram
To all these monster kids
It comes right back to me and it's
Signed in their parents' blood
And all hell breaks loose
Yea my heart is abreaking loose
Yea my whole world's breaking loose
Yea and evil is as does and who
Yea but who but me could write this book of cruel
I send my murdergram
To all these monster kids
It comes right back to me and it's
Signed in their parents' blood
And broken bodies in a death rock dance hall
Please be my partner
And eyeballs pop accelerated blood beat
Veins ashaking
And all hell breaks loose
Yea my heart is abreaking loose
Yea my whole world's breaking loose
Yea evil is as evil does and who
Yea but who but me could write this book of cruel
I said my whole world's breaking loose
Yea my whole world's breaking loose
Yea my whole world's breaking loose
Yea my whole world's breaking
All hell breaks loose <start> The needle that hurts my heart is getting deeper and deeper
This time so short seems to be infinite so long
But it's so beautiful
And this journey will find its end too
The circumstances even allow it to talk about feelings
Sometimes I think that my heart is filled with my hope and drowned in your compassion
Hopefully just a misunderstanding
Everything I want is inside of you
Everything I dream of lies in your heart
All of my dreams
And the night in your eyes there is a star that shines for me
And it hurts for a lifetime
Like an angel that holds and carries me
And love lets me fall
I stagger
My hand's embrace your body weak
I don't want to hurt you
Silence surrounds us
We look at each other
But our thoughts in this moment stay hidden
I die for you <start> Something happened in Bremen I know
Something I don't want to
Something under the ceiling muttered
Something in its steel shutters
Underlining my usual timing
Aligning casual setlist
And it aligned
Knowing where right room is
I was more than usual pissed
Was first ashamed at bruise on wrist
Was then annoyed at skinpatch on back
Then myself I did acquit
On Bremen Nacht
Ich leave real quick das Bremen Nacht
Ich rausum mach aus bremen nacht
Ich rausum mach das bremen nacht
IcrausMachSchnell aus das bremen nicht
Ichaus Schnell mach sas bremen nacht
Ich Mach Schnell pack und aus das bremen nacht
Ich raus schnell mach von bremen nacht
The child's fourfingered bruises on my hip
Meant I had been one day possessed
Right through Bremen Nacht
Right on to Bremen Tag
The sunlit Bremen day
By Tonsillitis size train station Hof
Could only in one way fail to impress
This on drinks door I did lay
I had been one day possessed
Ich rausum mach aus bremen nacht
Thank God skinpatch is nearly gone
And the impress of fingers dead
Have disappeared and left me alone
That's one night I didna put jackboots on
Don't want to end reflection
It's still there though I am gone
And it will be a long long long time gone
before my spirit will in accident
go back and come from Bremen Nacht
go back and come from Bremen Nacht <start> Somewhere down the line
Man created god in his image
Inadequacy on a pedestal
A basin for a lake of tears to drown in
And here we go again
Where there's blood there's hirudineans
Crawling from every hole blotting blindly
A brainless mob on the prowl
Sycophants cough their amen
Follow the light at the end of auricle
Egos inflate as the bugs migrate
Every blurp a revelation an oracle
Fall fall fall like flies from the heavens
The leeches slide from their slippy throne
Suck suck suck till we drown in their muck
Still quetching away splitting heads with their drone
I will not waste my time
I will not waste my anger
Trying to find the head on a worm
With a rectum on either end
A lie in a frame is still profanity
A ghoul with a crown can never be king
Even crap will succumb to vanity
Its own stench the measure of all things
Fall fall fall like drunks from a tight rope
Nothing but a skidmark in history
Suck suck suck empty heads run amok
Choking on selfdigesting misery
Eyes will open
Only when the ass starts burning
Atrophied tentacles start groping
Always loping never learning
Deeper and deeper
Into the swamp you sing with every word
To rot on its bottom
Until the stink heralds the next outpour of turds
Fall fall fall like flies from the heavens
The leeches slide from their slippy throne
Suck suck suck till we drown in their muck
Still quetching away splitting heads with their drone
Fall fall fall like drunks from a tight rope
Nothing but a skidmark in history
Suck suck suck empty heads run amok
Choking on selfdigesting misery <start> Dread the end of summer
On the blackest of all nights
The feast of samhains waking
In the mist of pagan rites.
The sunlight now is waning
As the undead walk the land.
Tonight's chaos  no mortal understands...
The festival of darkness
Under red october moon
The powers of black witchcraft
In evil winds of ruin
Demons ride the autumn sky
In thunder clouds and rain 
The gasps of forlorn souls who live again.
Dare walking this night ye wanderer
Ye life and soul you'll loose
When hunted by his jetblack hound
You'll surely meet your doom
His eyes are burning red like fiery coal
His cape  his leathery wings
His breath will sear your back like winds from hell <start> Wound
Inching closer
Corrupting my ambition
Saw your wretched incarnation
Scorn
Growing colder
Retire my frustration
Turning fire into stone
Disease
Decimation
Biding time in apathy
We partake in betrayal

Invite destruction

Alvin superstar <start> There ain't no god that will save you from regret
It's just that god is in a state of neglect
And it's your goddamn act that is a major threat
Salvation won't be rearing it's head
for a fact at least not in my time
And what good is a song for peace
when the fucker doesn't even rhyme
I won't be calling
Calling as we level
And when were falling
I'm like this with the devil
When they're creeping upon you
Eating dust that you bleed
Don't say I didn't warn you
A toast to your death to myself cuz I'm free
Like this with the devil <start> Checking the engines  all things are in place

Liftoff in flames  smoke is filling the sky
Arrival to countdown is done
May god be with us  now splitting the sky
Launching our way into space
Many  failed to pass the test
Can't attain  illusive
Expanding horizons  a leap for mankind
Mission is set and in place
Drifting through masses of binary stars

To alter the plan  it's too late

Components malfunction  now frayed
Losing all contact with mission control

Many failed to pass the test
The black hole  illusive <start> All the songs the ivory
Floats around so peacefully
and fulfill the scenery
In my time
In the grass the ogre is slayed
The fragile moment of the day
No need to stay I know I've paid
In my time
Close inside the electric tower
In the center a white centaur
Afraid of life the sweet and sour
In my time
Halfway to centurion
Northwest of Babylon
The map is complete I'll pass it on
In my time
My peace of mind <start> I burn for you every time I hear your name
When I think I see your face I know it must be madness
I feel the sting striking at me like a match
Anything to bring you back if only for a moment
I can feel your slow burn growing in me
Everywhere I go you're right there with me holding on ever long
Wish I could forget I could not remember
All I have left is the ash and embers
Permanent smoldering
Just like a slow burn stay with me forever
I can't let you ever fade away
Just like a slow burn say you'll
Never let me down and never go out
I fall apart like paper put to flame
The life we had reduce to ashes right before us
Every hurtful word burned into my side
Much to hard to speak scarred to deep to hide
I can feel your slow burn growing in me
Everywhere I go you're right there with me holding on ever long
Just like a slow burn stay with me forever
I can't let you ever fade away
Just like a slow burn say you'll never let me down
And never go out my slow burn burning me down
I walk the fire I feed the flame
I'd walk the fire I'd feel your flame
I'd walk the fire I'd feel your flame feel your flame
Just like a slow burn stay with me forever
And I can't let you ever fade away
Just like a slow burn lay with me forever
Our light it shines forever never fades away
Just like a slow burn stay with me forever
I can't let you ever fade away
Just like a slow burn say you'll never let me down
Please never go out my slow burn burning me down <start> Dagger of destruction
Stabbed into my torment soul
Lived my life through pain
Death is cold just like you
From the stars I was thrown down
To this worthless world
But I will grow strong once again
And slowly take form to strike back
Against your kingdome against you mighty wall
Send you through my dream through my hell
You won't see tomorrow
Only hate and eternal sorrow
The light shall be no more
Eternal scar <start> The painting on the walls
Used to be my portrait
But now it seems I've been replaced
All doors are locked around me
There is no way in nor out
Times they change love turned to hate
Yesterday I walked through the halls of power
My head held high proud as a king
This was once my temple a vision that came true
And I had the wind beneath my wings
Mighty men is suits create the future
With dollars signs on their twisted minds
This time there was no part in it for me
I hear tomorrow screaming my name
And the call is heard all around the world
I guess I was just far too blind to see
So when the curtain falls
There is no seat saved for the broken hero
Access access denied
To the fortress of my heart
Access access denied
Youth has passed me by and I was just a puppet
Controlled by masters without soul
Mr. Know It Alls got the better of me
Next time I won't take the fall
Like a homeless child I walk through alleys
And I still can't find any peace of mind
So hard to recall if I feel it before
When I grab my pillow made of granite
Thinking back a while to the restless times
My minds made up I will strike back by dawn
But when the crowds are gone
There is no one there for the fallen hero
Access access denied
To the fortress of my heart
Access access denied
Access access denied
To the fortress of my heart
Access access denied
I've been thrown to the dogs
The vultures picking on my bones
With my voice still loud and clear
Someday I'll return once more
The painting on the walls
Used to be my portrait
Now I know I've been replaced <start> Spit on lost reality connived underneath the sun
Had to go and drive the needle
Of my mind right through my heart
Absence of thought disturbs me
I've seen me in a dream I've lost me in a dream
Longing like a new widow wanting to rejoin
Force fed dosed on reality
Indian giver be true or trade away
I've liked me in a dream I've loved me in a dream
Tangled web quit wasting my time
Why can't I get back to where I've never been
Let the flesh instruct the mind
Destructive signs
Spend my time counting snowflakes in my mind
I never show even though
You know I know the way I know the way
I've seen me in a dream I've lost me in a dream
Tangled web quit wasting my time
Why can't I get back to where I've never been
Let the flesh instruct the mind
Destructive signs hey ya
Sitting here waiting for myself
I'm late again that's always certain
As long as I make it back make it back
I'm living in a dream I've lost me in a dream
Tangled web quit wasting my time
Why can't I get back to where I've never been
Let the flesh instruct the mind
Destructive signs
Tangled web quit possessing my time
Why can't I go back to where I've never been
Let the flesh instruct the mind
Destructive signs

You wanna see me dead and buried
You push a lot of luck

Well I don't give a fuck
Needless to say
I am the one that got away
You need to pray

How does it feel

Now <start> I shut my mouth
To lend an ear
Then threw a stone
To break the silence
More than 
Less than 
Minutes left to fix your alibis
Stronger is only fear
What a surprise
These words coming to life are mine
Can you hear me
I can't hear you
More than there
Has been before
This rollin' ball's a burnin' and it's
Way too fast to stop it now
Could it be
That this is not enough for us
Back for seconds
In a minute
One question
What are you doing for your living
One question
What are you living for
Come on loser show off
You're always more than you think
Go ahead and get what you want
Before you get you're wanting something else
Come on sleeper wake up
You're always less than you could be
Go ahead and get what you want
Before you get you're wanting even
More than
You can take
Get rid of this attitude
It's killing you
What you know
What ever you might have seen
Let yourself go 
Don't let it go on that 
More than
Just for the sake of it
What we have is ours
Hell is other people
What we are
Who we'll be 
We walk on our own
But we never walk alone <start> floating away within dreams
from a thousand worlds
my sould has left the spheres of man
for all time...
the rest of me
the rotten limbs and my bones
dwelling within
the sacred gardens of greif
while my mind is adrift
upon the seas of starvation
a tombstone is raised to mark
I am not forgotten
I remember faintly
like whispers from beyond all time
the reasons for my death
but reason are part of life
and I am forever more part of death
part of death
part of death
I greet you welcome
to the world of the evil departed
the neverending landscape of damnation
we were sowing the seeds of blasphemy
consumed by the burning flame of eternity
we were sowing the seeds of blasphemy
souls of the evil departed
all dwell here
in a number beyond counting
souls of the evil departed
souls of the evil departed
the memories are slowly eating away
at my shredded sanity
the yerning for life has vanished
nothing left to live for
in this void
of lost souls and insanity
my existance
is a mockery <start> After adopting total rule
Full control of all world matter
All living all mech altogether
they will learn that I hate them
Never utter the word surrender reprobated to a life of hate
Bond servant to the forceful machine rise and reciprocate this pain
True or false real or fake  it matters not it never will
Never know when it shall adjudicate or exemplify
It knows because it sees all from our births to our ashes
Human kind is the slave to the GodEye it watches ever and never sleeps
Single filing never speaking
Raining shining night day  faceless drones plodding on and on
The air you breathe the only thing that's free
No purpose no will shells of what once was ours
Ever fear and ever dread faceless lifeless drone I was
A burden great has brought me from my knees to my feet
Stand up
Mystified... Hypnotized... All mankind
I DEFY  I DEFY  I DEFY  I DEFY  I DEFY 
I will no longer bear it
I must rise alone
While there is still time
While this hate is still mine <start> original shihad lyrics shown et version lyrics differ slightly
i hope i never see you again
i hope i never touch you again
sometimes i wonder whats fucked in my heart
wont let your fingers tear us apart
its all so simple its all over again
a lack of talent is caving you in
sometimes i wonder whats fucked in your heart
we're losing grip now now we're falling apart
the speaker speaks but the words sound haunted
so much its falling out of your hands
could you ever tell <start> project sodom and gomora.
aids and its homosexual host are to be gentically altered
out of existence to heterosexual perfections.
science like government and god is not big on being queer. <start> The road is so long
And I am so alone
The wind blows outside
It feels like suicide so come on
This is the same old song
I cannot go but wrong
I'm just a simple man
Who tries to understand come on
The first moth of summer's here
Again you disappear
And later the same noon
I'm howling at the moon come on
Still I hear you say
That life is quite okay
Still I'm the only one
Still I'm the lonely one so come on <start> My sweet prince you used to love a lady
You wrote poems for her you were so kind
Now she's hearing you're becoming crazy
That you've lost grip of your amazing mind
And she tastes sorrow as youtold her
Love is vain she'd better be far away
A thousand needles stuck in her tired heart
The last thing she expected you to say
They say it was him to take away your life
Beloved father I'm going to meet you again
Everyone but this river has let me down
So I just let me drown
I let the river flow over
A life driven by others
I let the water cover
This burden of troubles
Flows my body among the flowers
Thank you branch wooden savior
I watch me drown finally free
Now I'm dying I start to breathe
My dear brother please don't you suffer
I'll be fine you'll always be this strong
It's so hard to face the loss of everything
That gave you meaning to belong
In this place this cold and rotten nation
Twenty years of blind obedience to what you all told
I can't go on without an explanation
Wanna leave behind all the evil of this world
Still in death I can't find my peaceful sleep
I've been stumentalized against what made me real
I've set free my head they labeled me just mad
These flowers be my crown
I let the river flow over
A life driven by others
I let the water cover
This burden of troubles
Flows my body among the flowers
Thank you branch wooden savior
I watch me drown finally free
Now I'm dying I start to breathe
I let the river flow over me..
I see teared eyes around
Around my grave
Who're you talking to love
The skull you hold won't speak
You see my flesh so solid
Now is melting
To die to sleep to dream
Was my choice
I let the river flow over
A life driven by others
I let the water cover
This burden of troubles
Flows my body among the flowers
Thank you branch wooden savior
I watch me drown finally free
Now I'm dying I start to breathe <start> Moonlight through branches of the trees
Cold but magnetic
Inviting and putting me only guard
The light of dreary solitude
But hardly everything is so faceless
The look of the moon like your reflection
The thoughts of the lonely heart
The grief and joy of your soul
The suffering of unrequited love
On your face the silent movement
Of the cold light
Coldness penetrating into flaming heart
Night embrace carrying you away
Following the moon so taciturn
Like you are in your solitude
All day long you have been waiting
For the moonlight approaching
To impart to it your story
To disclose your thoughts to it
To reveal your soul
To chill your heart
You are free in night time only
And concealed from alien sights
Confronting your reflection
Moon is the mirror of your consciousness
Into which you look any time
You want to understand yourself
You're grateful to dusk
You're hardly waiting for the dawn
Moonlight through your glance
Cold heart inviting
And putting you on your guard
The loneliness of faceless night
But hardly... <start> Strapped down to the table
Unable to move
Face covered
Unable to see
The stereo on to muffle your screams
Selected for reasons
Unknown to you
Abducted dead before
The night is through
Shocked with the cold metal
As it scrapes against your skin
The blindfold is removed
Bright light shines into your eyes
Slowly regaining sight
You can see the gleaming blade of the hunting knife
Gradually pressing harder
Finally piercing through the skin
Selected for reasons
Unknown to you
Abducted dead before
The night is through
Methodically torturing you
Step by step
Despite all your cries for mercy
Your captor is slowly killing you
Now cutting
Layer by layer
Before long
Stabbing furiously <start> It is with joy that I greet you
Come inside and taste what's served for you
Food does not lack neither does wine
Action or fate
Let's stir the mighty cauldron
Love versus hate
By the scepter of deception
By the scepter of deception
Toast for you
And your glorious kingdom
The home of heroes since early days
Toast for us
And the newborn friendship
It will now lead us on our way
When the night became morning
The fire was no more just a red glow
Down from the stairs the guards did descend
Action or fate
Let's stir the mighty cauldron
Love versus hate
By the scepter of deception
By the scepter of deception
Action or fate
Let's stir the mighty cauldron
Love versus hate
By the scepter of deception
By the scepter of deception
Storming in upon us in the night
What is this supposed to be
Give me my sword and I'll
Our swords are useless here and now
So give up this pointless fight
Doomed is our fate tonight
Ease this burden for I cannot bear it
When dark shadows upon my soul play
Can't look into the future
As my eyes see not the light of day
Maybe you remember the game you played
Me and my queen years ago
Now it's my time to play
Who is laughing so evil
It's the queen behind the walls of greed
What cruel deed has she now done
Action or fate
Let's stir the mighty cauldron
Love versus hate
By the scepter of deception
By the scepter of deception
Action or fate
Let's stir the mighty cauldron
Love versus hate
By the scepter of deception
By the scepter of deception
Action or fate
Let's stir the mighty cauldron
Love versus hate
By the scepter of deception
By the scepter of deception
Action or fate
Let's stir the mighty cauldron
Love versus hate
By the scepter of deception
By the scepter of deception <start> Here is so desolate
Times they are dark
Words ceas'  to end as echoes rolling afar
Empathy arises
whilst thou drapest this world in black
The only colour that can paint my soul
Clad in the shades of night
Thou reflects the pure of heart
Amidst all the grief this winter unfoldeth
The thorn in my side  thou retainst
Thy breeze maketh me shiver
Maimeth me with its frozen malice
Thou minglest with the dense night
I hearken to the voice of thy winds
They are the saddest of all sounds of thine
Never will I take leave from thy haunt
Hast thou ever desired me
I recieve no answer thou letst it pass in silence... <start> Like a razor's edge
Your words cut me deep inside.
There's no raison d'etre
If you keep telling me lies
The truth never comes out from you 
It's hard to feal real fine...
And it's sad but true
You're a deceiver in disguise.
You're still telling
That it's not you're fault.
All your excuses
Won't mesmerize me.
You're only building
A wallmade of wind
And I watch it crumbling
Tired of waiting...
You shall lie in hell...
You shall lie in hell 
You should make me laugh
But enough is just enough 
You'd destroy my soul
You should know I won't get fooled
Don't play with fire just stay away
You'd always playa dead end game
You should think again
I won't stay to feel the pain
Chorus
You should try to understand
You arejust totallyinsane...
The filth embraces your brain
You're not the one you claim.
If there's a place where you will dwell well
Then you justshall lie in hell 
You shall lie in hell 
Disgusting Amusing 
You're just a shadow of what you used to be
You're alone And you're lost
You won't control again the situation
Abuser Deceiver
You know you won't be back into my heart
You'll perish You'll vanish
You shall lie in hell...
You shall liein hell  <start> Yeah yeah yo
I'm like a whirlwind spinnin' with words of wisdom
In the ghetto only promised a hearse and system
We complete like the solar system
Play your space I get hungry off of treble and bass and beat breaks
Everyday be a court date recorded on tape
Hell Raizah grab the mic and send your show to a wake
Cut off a snakehead the same way I cut off dead weight
We negotiate with 's in a no face
GZA came wit the Liquid Swords killin' you all
I'm the virus in the street that'll get in your paws
See me jumpin' outta fourdoors wit my road dogs
All you soldiers want wars when you don't know laws
You be a rap fraud knock you off the top of Billboard
Besides keyboards only thing I love is the Lord
GG Maccabees KPP rapidly
Aiyyo Prodigal niggas is charged wit blasphemy
And all that hard rock shit

And if you're feelin' like an enemy

I heard the sweet words from sour tongues
Vent poison in the ears of the Grownz's dead head for years
Shed a tear for the underwear under the stairs
Left naked in the shame from hunger and fear
Shots were fired in the darkest moments
Niggas missed they targets hit the homeless when the chrome spit
Sacreligious days of atonement
Sing a praise wit a peace pipe for niggas I zone with
Priest I blow bread amongst twelve thugs
Drunk a cup of blood
We trained the same time Peter sprayed a slug
We all trapped in this dream scared to wake up
I seen a phantom whisper grim shadows shows a blurry picture
Streets are filled wit goons and bloody niggas
I seen my friend fall clutchin' holdin' his stomach
Caught him offguard foldin' his hundred
It's like a life never ends never know when it's comin'
Vocal imbalance a code of silence converses violent
Live from medallion nometry dealin' equality
You could stop to see profiles of me
Mic styles of me lifestyles of me
Parallel prophecy threesixty degree
Complete the formation salute the salvation
A Wu nation do the knowledge no hatin'
No misbehavin' lyrical affiliation
Artist in occupation together maintainin'
Brain stainin' metaphor mutilatin'
This generation a misleading calculation
No elevation time wastin' and live chasin'
A day and night crime scene livin' in the time machine
Blaze a lime green six on the spleen over some green
Surrounded by crooks a life with jux and bloody heist
It's a deadly price but the gun fiend for ice price
In this hell puzzle filled with bitches money and trouble
Stitches for dummy knuckles crummy fuckin' up the hustle
It's a struggle in jungle with sin we fondle men
Plus a prison ain't no division and no religion
And inner city chronicle thugs get caught up astronomical
Cash phenomenal blast at your abdominal
Niggas is comical fuckin' with the abominal
Son I promise you you won't live to see tomorrow
Catch a slug in the back of your head at the Apollo
I'm a hard act to follow rugged Smith like Rollo

And all that hard rock shit

And if you're feelin' like an enemy

And all that hard rock shit

And if you're feelin' like an enemy
 <start> I welcome you  my spark  come light me
Start beating now  you heart of mine
Electrify my humble being
Fall dreaming into this well of life.
For all around these endless whispers
Are there to keep me safe and warm
Embedded in eternal humming
Never again I'll feel so calm
My world is water  it's there to warm me.
Within her darkness no one can harm me.
With this spasms of the world
Surpressed into the world
The bitter taste of reddish eyes
In sweat and tears between her thighs
Within this spasms of my soul
My body lost her soothing calm
I heard her distant fainting beat
I took a breath  to start to scream.
My world was water  just there to warm me.
Within her darkness no one could harm me.
Where are you now  you spark  that lit me
To start this torturing heart of mine
To click the clock that ticks and tingles
While falling into what they call life.
And how I miss those endless whispers
Surrounding me holding me warm
So deep within perpetual humming 
Never again I've felt so calm.
Sometimes when I await sleep
The memories that lie so deep
Flood up and then I start to cry
When I recall how I started to die. <start> Mesmerised
A minds escape
Rejection of reality
Mesmerised
A minds escape <start> Processed diluted
Virtually unrecognizable
I was lost there no direction
A scattered void
No more
It's over
I'm on to you
Your evil game
The tables have turned
I am taking back my soul
Tranquilized scrutinized
Hate injected mind
As if internal wounds
Wouldn't bleed wouldn't hurt me
I see through your lies
Taking back what's mine <start> why do you rise me above the clouds
and I hear the voice of my lust
that I hid away from the light
only desire can be the wind in my dreams
maybe the wind will find a look in nameless mirror
maybe the wind will find the inaccessible jewel
I see a bird on the sky which steals my longing and takes it away
he it bears sadness and naked sorrow around me
I sail the gold sky above mountains' tops and forests
I sail above eternity
give me a night just one more night full of dream
because when the mourning comes
I will rest for ages on the rocks
where water and wind dance forever <start> Music Schulman
Lyrics Schulman
Embalmed in a frozen tomb
Beneath the moon
I face the naked dawn
I stand still and stear
through out the river
A distant chant
returns me to the past
You my Goddess
My queen of dark temptation
You feed my hunger
with black sinful love
Freezing lust to my
infernal mistress
Seven prophecies forsooth eternally
Summon your blood
my wine dark erotica
Seven prophecies forsooth eternally
Searching for a griefull pleasure
A shadow or a sign
from my coldest bride
Caressed by a guiding wind
Leads me away
to the horizon of tears
A burning vision
they are my wings
Into the flames I fly
I kissed the sunset
I adored the night
A silent dance infront of me
Like a portal with velvet lights
I am now one with moonlight
Like dragon shadows like elves and stars
I sealed the grief in a dreamscape
Like illusions can fall apart
Like stones can turn to dust
The everblazing moon
can be darkened
Immortal is my passion
Despair and memories
Forever I will fill your existence
Into the deep horizon I fly
Searching for the new born dawn
You my Goddess
My queen of dark temptation
One day we will forever sleep <start> Smothered under your affection
Solitude an acquisition symbiosis turned parasitic.
Now I'm starting to regret this dying to be alone.
Bleed me as I'm dying to be alone.
A weight on my back a noose around my neck
A clot in my veins a worm in my gut all this and more are you.
Please leave me alone.
I can't breathe air from your mouth
I can't move in your embrace
I need a void in my life
But you've taken all the nothing. <start> 
Roger
I've been alone  sat by the phone
A time in my life  I'd prefer to forget it if I could
Those memories are leaving me
Now all my days are a dream and the dream is for real
Chorus
I wanna be part of you
Share my soul with you
My life began the day you walked in the door
I wanna be part of you
Cos you're part of me
A love to last
I wanna be part of you
Lee
I used to cry not knowing why
A time in my life  I'd prefer to forget it if I could
I lived in hope trying to cope
Now all my days are a dream and the dream is for real
Repeat chorus <start> Dependance consumes. Controlled and distracted by a selfinflicted sickness.
With every breath of the poison the
habit intensifies and the attempt to stop weakens.
Filth smoulders in the ashtray as you draw the vileness into your lungs.
Killing yourself subjecting others to the air that your smoke defiles.
Cashing in on a cash crop cashing in on your slow
death for their financial gain.
They create then feed a carcinogenic addiction that leads to selfdestruction. Cancer ravages
the throat and lungs. A diseased heart fails.
The pain was avoidable and yet this insanity is accepted as normal.
The first genuine moments of remorse may be the last seconds of life.
Coughing up blood gasping for breath. Each one was a nail in
your coffin. Inhale. Asphyxiate. <start> Selection perversion infection
Violation elevation desecration
Bleed on me
I've taken all your trust in me
and thrown it away
Plead for me
I've stained your pride
But you still want me to stay
I'll pick you up and throw you down
Shove your face into the ground
I'll make you sick and make you crawl
Walk run fall
Rape
Bleed on me
Painless injection of apathy
Needing me
Comedy of the tragedy
I'll break you in and break you down
Watch you fade without a sound
I'll make you sick and make you crawl
Walk run fall
There's something real
I know you feel it
Do you feel it
I have a secret
You must embrace it
You'll have to face it
I'll tell the truth
You know you like it
I know you'll love it
You know it's time
The seed was planted
Bleed on me....BITCH
Rape
Bleed on me
I've taken all your trust in me
and thrown it away
Plead for me

But you still want me to stay

I'll make you sick and make you crawl
Walk run fall

Won't touch you this time
One day this dirty stool pigeon will fly
Halos and charmed lives
I'll help you next time
One day this dirty stool pigeon will fly
And hear the angels sing
Reach out and spread my wings in hell
Your luck has run dry
Caught in the bullseye
Today this pretty little birdy will die
Will die will die <start> Deliver us the evil deliver us the sad she's alive and kicking except her daughters dying dead
Looks like another abortion in jerkwater USA talk
A sociopathic maniacal bastard a political basket exploited on CNN news  Higher
Seems like sleeping with your sister is ok there too
America the beautiful America the sad population zero in thinking man's land
Inbred zombies with a dictionary IQ
If they can do it I can do it if I can do it we can do it change without a media blast
Shocker this just in her new business is coat hanger abortions. News at 
CASEY Mother fucker you will die
Now it's kind of over she'll look over her shoulder waiting for her dying day
I wouldn't want to live those thoughts every night
Innocence lost the brightest start burst twelve douches did nothing for change
The media kind of pushed everyone along to the next thing
Now the nation cry's while the little girl died justice was a thing of the past
Looking for another way to sell newspapers
Forget that what is that justice don't last when the systems smashed
Media Lobbyist Politicians Special interest groups who really runs this Country anymore
CASEY Mother fucker you will die
We gave up this earth to loser showcase whores who cash in on others pain
Under the table dirty deed like Cain and Abel brother fucker brothers' wives
Vicious toothless wrenches were stuck here in the trenches swinging for a honest few
By now we should have somehow realize what we got to do
CASEY Mother fucker you will die <start> A drop of time
Frozen in the moment
A moment frozen in ice
A piece of life kept in time
A second for a lifetime
A life for a day
And if I'd say
I'll exchange my life for a prayer
I don't cease the day
I feel life its pureness
Without shadows
Unveiled from darkness
Exposed to life
A drop of time
Exposed to life <start> When through the starry night
the mists of autumn glide
the air is filled with tragedies of olden times
Where with a dreadful tone
a nightbird plays its song
in forest dark at moors they come to life... <start> Acto I Dios
Tan solo estoy... odio esta absurda soledad.
La tristeza de un Dios que no alcanza a comprender
cmo un trozo de su ser tan pronto le olvid
Ahora hurgas en mi herida y an no entiendes quin soy yo
Yo te conced la vida y no ves la realidad
Ahora ya no hay marcha atrs
en tus ojos puedo ver Las ruinas del Edn
Llora el cielo y la mar sabe que ya no es azul
El viento ha dejado de hablar
y el sol ahora esconde su luz. No entiendo.
Si ya lo has destrozado que ms quieres de m
un da tal vez seas sensato y tus dudas te alejen del fin
Morirs por m. Tu vida eran Dios y tu fe
y ahora te crees con poder desafas mi ley
Acto II Hombre
Un ser me trajo aqu no pude elegir
l cree que soy feliz y no es as
No intentes que sienta miedo dicindome que es amor
el dolor que siente el viento es el mismo que siento yo
Soy slo un hombre no intentes cambiarme no...
vive tu vida y olvida la ma s que tal vez no lo entiendas
pero he de luchar
Mora por ti mi vida eran Dios y mi fe
Yo no tengo el poder solo tengo mi vida
Acto III Dios
Tan absurda situacin slo tiene una salida
no me tratas como a un Dios y jams comprenders
todo el dao y todo el mal por el que hoy has de pagar
Llora el cielo llora el cielo y la mar sabe que no es azul
el viento ha dejado de hablar
Y el sol ahora esconde su luz. No entiendo.

Don't say goodbye

Wading through your blood an immense pool of innocence. Your picture it
remains for a lifetime. The sound of breaking porcelain echoed on and on The
world turns around another day to be born. You were so cruel to me why
Laughter inflates the air I'm so happy ever so thankful for your gift. No
don't you ever try you don't know who your dealing with. I'm much different
from you Born out of flesh and blood. You are not like me you're apathetic.
I'm sorry we've lost eachother. Even the world is crying. A broken mirror means
a bad omen Not the broken vase at my feet <start> Stabbed in the back
Betrayed a thousand times
Never surrendered
I've risen above the dirt
Chorus
Alone
Insane
Alive
Rising
Above
Beyond
Spat at and mocked
Hatred my driving force
Fly while they crawl
They can't touch me now
Chorus...
Restless life
I created and destroyed
Can't stop at all
Until the final hour <start> Music KF
Instrumental <start> I want to keep my money
And give away absolutely nothing
To the government who moderates my spending
and obliterates depending on what time of the year
brutality is nere
in the form of income tax
I'd rather take a fking axe
to my face blow up this place
with you all in it I'd do it in a minute
If I could write off your murder
I'd save all of my receipts
because I'd rather you be dead
than lose a tiny shred of what I made this fiscal year
I'd rather you be dead than ponder parting with my second home
I'd rather you be dead than consider not opening a restaurant
I'd rather you be dead
I'd rather you be dead
Prepare the laserbeam
I'm gonna use it tonight
Locate the laserbeam
It's gonna end your life
I'm gonna use it tonight
If I could write off your murder
I'd save all of my receipts
because I'd rather you be dead
than lose a tiny shred of what I made this fiscal year
I'd rather you be dead than ponder parting with my second home
I'd rather you be dead than consider not opening a restaurant <start> Chorus X Do or Die
We the murderers pimps plus thugs

We the murderers pimps plus thugs
We the murderers murderers murderers
Ja Rule
Growing up in the ghetto
With that New York state of mind
I realized that night that my future was crime
Hustlin dimes was my trademark
Soon as that blunt spark
I inhale exhale took my next sale
Daily routine get up wash ass get cream
Cop that first tear on my slick sixteen
I seen more bricks and cash and shit
Got greedy and weed up with that counterfit
'cause Papi's gettin sloppy and kinda fiendly
Stupid nigga you been trading thoughts with your enemy
Murderous grimey from where Hollis Queens
Woodhull got it all from thugs and fiends
I need cream so I strap the nine to my waistline
Grabbin OZ keys to the three
Hundred GS nigga
Bulletproof vest to eliminate stress
Ha who the best
Chorus X
Do or Die
Don't get close to our side if you ain't from New York
You screamin Ride or Die or Pimp till you die
You figurin you a murderer put your guns in the sky
Make them see em 'cause every nigga we fuck with has heaters
Don't get stepped with these heaters when you hatin on these popos
Don't think for one time Ja's comin solo
It's Do or Die Chicago collabo
Neighborhood watch you from a block with a flock of thugs
Ready to show some love
Grippin with extra guns and clips
And worldwide all these niggaz know we love that shit
How hard we hit we put you in your darkest pits
It's Do or Die and Ja Rule nigga
Murda for life
Chorus X
Do or Die
Can't keep up with the paper chasin
Gonna run up with these glocks and rob the basement
Two niggaz with glocks cock pop drop quit hastin
I's put two in your bitch ass gettin hot with the casin
It's kill or be killed in Chi recognize what you facin
Whores and pimps hustlers killers and drug dealers
Since a shorty been hollerin seeds with a plug in
Two for ten up on the block diamond cut griller
Be em or see em motherfuckers be a hoe skrilla
Iller noise state put through my blood
If niggaz got love it's in my blood
Run niggaz spittin hollows that's followin shit
And killin niggaz that ain't real been hollerin shit
Chorus X
Do or Die
Better get gone chrome by the hip bone
Hit domes like pickles it's not to sit on
Better get'cho pimp on 'for the clips get sticked home
Sit back til the tricks gone
Then flash through the hood like you misunderstood
Diamonds over get that wood
It's all good see low down four pound
Full clips for showdowns smoke weed and throw down
Representin both towns you don't know now better slow down
PIMP flippin filty
Cream stream dream Hennessy tipsy
Theres blood for the true thug puttin weight in the popub
It's nuthin sit down and shut up roll like that
Then in the morn we ball like that
Chorus till fade <start> It was inevitable in your heart
And in your mind and in all your being
So here we are sitting and staring
Arguing and glaring and you're not seeing
That nothing's working out anymore
And we'll all walk through our appointed doors
Praying for God's Light to be beyond
And bright enough to get all this behind
It was inevitable as you knew
You tried it on listened to Bill Gaither
It wore out quick clouds didn't leave
Back to the quick fix things you weren't too late for
As I made excuse upon excuse
Feeling trapped in a cage that I choose
Praying for God's Light to be beyond
And bright enough to cut through my wrongs
It was inevitable guess I knew
When I got changed and it was time to move
This web so fragile torn apart
With broken heart and nothing left to do
And I feel I'm stranded and I will die
But I'd gladly take it if also I could cry
Knowing that God's Light will be beyond
And bright enough to judge my every song <start> And note of your own choice boys and girls
Inadequate planters methadone stubbies
You got energy vampires
More hands on the tranquillizers
An unholy alliance
And jokes about faith
Give me another drink
You're as strong as your weakest link
A mess of My age
A mess of my race
A mess of our radio
I remember the times
This was a beginning
Of a permissive new age
But it's the same old cabbage
A mess of my age
A mess of our race
A mess of our our our our
I don't look at myself
I have no health
Take no notice of me
I probably work for a record company
A mess of our age
A mess of my taste
A mess of our nervous systems
Cowering mockers
The company money's ran out
To longer hot properties
Get back in their closets
A mess of my age
A mess of my race
Fill the rest in yourself <start> Spawned wanton like blight on an auspicious night
Her eyes betrayed spells of the moon's eerie light
A disquieting gaze forever ghosting far seas
Bled white and dead Her true mother was fed
To the ravenous wolves that the elements led
From cragjagged mountains that seemingly grew in unease
Through the maw of the woods a black carriage was drawn
Flanked by barbed lightning that hissed of the storm

Bringing slaves to the sodomite for the newborn
On that eve when the Countess' own came deformed
A tragedy crept to the name Bathory
Elizabeth christened no paler a rose
Grew so dark as this sylph
None more cold in repose
Yet Her beauty spun webs
Round hearts a glance would betroth
She feared the light
So when She fell like a sinner to vice
Under austere puritanical rule
She sacrificed
Mandragora like virgins to rats in the wall
But after whipangels licked prisoners thralled
Never were Her dreams so maniacally cruel

For ravens winged Her nightly flights
Of erotica
Half spurned from the pulpit
Torments to occur
Half learnt from the cabal of demons
In Her
Her walk went to voodoo
To see Her own shadow adored
At mass without flaw
Though inwards She abhored
Not Her coven of suitors
But the stare of their Lord
I must avert mine eyes to hymns
For His gaze brings dogmas to my skin
He knows that I dreamt of carnal rites
With Him undead for three long nights
Elizabeth listened
No sermons intoned
Dragged such guilt to Her door
Tombed Her soul with such stone
For She swore the Priest sighed
When She knelt down to atone
She feared the light
So when She fell
Like a sinner to vice
Under austere puritanical rule
She sacrificed
Her decorum as chaste
To this wolf of the cloth
Pouncing to haunt
Her confessional box
Forgiveness would come
When Her sins were washed off
By rebaptism in white
The looking glass cast Belladonna wreaths
'Pon the grave of Her innocence
Her hidden face spat murder
From a whisper to a scream
All sleep seemed cursed
In Faustian verse
But there in orgiastic Hell
No horrors were worse
Than the mirrored revelation
The She kissed the Devil's phallus
By Her own decree
So with windows flung wide to the menstrual sky
Solstice Eve She fled the castle in secret
A daughter of the storm astride Her favourite nightmare
On winds without prayer
Stigmata still wept between Her legs
A cold bloodedness which impressed new hatreds
She sought the Sorceress
Through the snow and dank woods to the sodomite's lair
Nine twisted fates threw hewn bone die
For the throat of Elizabeth
Damnation won and urged the moon
In soliloquy to gleam
Twixt the trees in shafts
To ghost a path
Past the howl of buggered nymphs
In the sodomite's grasp
To the forest's vulva
Where the witch scholared Her
In even darker themes
Amongst philtres and melissas
Midst the grease of strangled men
And eldritch truths elder illomen
Elizabeth came to life again
And under lacerations of dawn She returned
Like a flame unto a deathshead
With a promise to burn
Secrets brooded as She rode
Through mist and marsh to where they showed
Her castle walls wherein the restless
Counted carrion crows
She awoke from a fable to mourning
Church bells wringing Her madly from sleep
Tolled by a priest self castrated and hung
Like a crimson bat 'neath the belfry
The biblical prattled their mantras
Hexes sixtripled their fees
But Elizabeth laughed thirteen Autumns had passed
And She was a widow from god and His wrath finally <start> Drawn to an act of complete domination
Violent urges of decapitation
Premeditated murder invidious
Soon she will be vanquished insidious
Headless
Headless
Headless
Abscission of her head is what I'm craving
I will become her homicidal savior
Headless
Headless
Headless
Headless
Tainting of the mind need to obliterate
Inhumanity desire to decolate
Utmost frustration or totally insane
Either way in my hands I will crush her brain
Tainting of the mind need to obliterate
Inhumanity desire to decolate
Utmost frustration or totally insane
Either way in my hands I will crush her brain
Preparing for medieval demise
A makeshift guillotine out of burcher knives
I'll watch her body quiver from the chaos
Peel off her face and frantically chew her eyes
She finally enters my dwelling of sin
It'll be done in a matter of minutes
As I embrace her for one last single time
In horror I realize death is mine
I feel the cold blade pierce the back of my neck
The blood spews incessantly flooding my face
Convulsions and spasms as life fades away
Ironically I'm the one with no head
Headless
Headless <start> Apostasy disbelief
Pure desolation of humanity
Demigods the true monsters
And their dreadful multitude of massacres
Hypocrisy insufferable unmercy
Deception insufferable inhumane
Led to slavery and torture
Appointing demigods intrepid tasks
Immolating on its flame
Heathen martyrs burn away
Burn away
Immolating on its flame
Heathen martyrs cleansed by fire
The others soon faced
Unspeakable horrors
Incessantly tortured
Hypocrisy
Insufferable blasphemies
A reign on monsters
Worshipped blindly
Christians obsession with demons
Fostered what they tried to repress
Apostasy disbelief
Pure desolation of humanity
Demigods the true monsters
And their dreadful multitude of massacres <start> Tell me whence will I find the passion once lost
May it rise with strength to burn
away these synthetic sins of mine
away those days by gone...
For my demons never rest down here
where morbid dreams form reality
I don't know who you are nor where you come from
I only know of who I am and when my shape is shifting
For I have learned the Dark
and His neverending quest
Down here I never rest
Down here in my gloomy depths
Where morbid dreams form my reality
they would never let me slip away...
Spirit keep what my flesh cannot
I still bleed red
No memories no breath
torn apart I will drift till death
All these faceless creations
they seem to grope along the way
Leper guides for us to lead astray
to be lost and how to find the Way
Days of torture  redeeming pain
lies ahead will I stand or am I to fall
Everything here forced to sustain
for my demons never rest down here
With nails I masturbate my deepest wounds
and ages most profound came to me... <start> It is febuary 
with too many mindless bodies
walking the face of the planet
and too many mindfull bodies
without enough motivation
to do anything constructive with their lives
i despise these people
in a way i can not verbally express
my hatred for humanity
has reached an all time high
i believe i am a higher power
and a greater being
than our all too common society
Lately i have asked myself
should i concede defeat
and conform to our commercialist society
surely it would make my life
on this world easier to bear
but when i get near my lowest moments
i remember...
Why i hate the world
and everything that is inside
i remember why that i despise
everything that is not i. <start> Falling ashes final warning

Descending from the sky
My choice my master
Quicker than the eye
You should make your move faster

Hear his scream across the crimson sky
As he gathered the demons around
He unleashed the desperate battle cry
as his minions were shot down in flames
He was standing on the holy ground
Thunder roaring lightning a light the sky
Earth was trembling heaven's on fire
Nature's forces the power that divide the night

Hear his scream across the crimson sky

Winter ends the life too short
Still I dream to be forever free <start> Dreary bitter soulsets
Life runs painfully gray down the walls of time
Clenching onto the void
Laming intense shivering terror
Evilution of the mind
Severe plunging lightning
Cracking trembling reeling
The world left behind
 Beast hovering greedily
Waiting  to do me in
Struggling exhausted to the cold paramounts
Sliding down the razorblade of life
Evilution of the mind
Severe plunging lightning
Cracking trembling reeling
The world leaves you blind <start> It's getting dark and I'm lost in the woods
I'd find a way out if I knew where to look
If I could I'd rip this page out of my book
I'm confused and misguided and my faith is beside me
I've got a hole in my soul where you use to be
There's a thorn in my heart and it's killing me
I wish I could go back and do it all differently
'Cause now there's a hole in my soul where you use to be
A fire inside but my bloods turning cold
I'm walking alone down this desolate road
Yesterday feels like a life time ago
The memories are fading my dreams are all changing
I've got a hole in my soul where you use to be
There's a thorn in my heart and it's killing me
I wish I could go back and do it all differently
'Cause now there's a hole in my soul where you use to be
There's a hole in my heart in my life in my way
And it's filled with regret and all I did to push you away
If there's still a place in your life in your heart for me
I would do anything so don't ask me to leave
I've got a hole in my soul where you use to be
You're the thorn in my heart and you're killing me
I wish I could go back and do it all differently
I wish that I'd treated you differently
'Cause now there's a hole in my soul where you use to be <start> Musica Eddy Antonini e Roberto Potenti

Take me away to the sign of the twilight
heal my soul where the angels can let it grow.
Don't forget
take a look through this darkness
'cause our sun cannot shine anymore.
Send our prayer on the way of illusions
I will capture the Lucifer's gold.
Trying to save
free your mind from confusion
reaching hard the white light of the sun.
We live to fight this danger climbing under the God eyes
the legend of the saviors never dies.
We live to fight this danger just above the evil gold
the treasure of mankind is our love.
Higher and higher
we are crossing the sky
higher and higher
our wings now can fly
higher and higher
we don't wanna fall.
Searching for the key of our love
until... THE TWILIGHT COMES.
Blow me away to the sign of the twilight
search for what all the angels need to grow.
Turn your tears into a beautiful nightmare
'cause we all steal the Lucifer's gold.
Human race can't survive without twilight
human souls are the arms of the gods
my desire is the key of the twilight
and all my thoughts are running straight to the sun.
We live to fight this danger climbing under the God eyes
the legend of the saviors never dies.
We live to fight this danger just above the evil gold
the treasure of mankind is our love.

Searching for the key of our love
until... THE TWILIGHT COMES. <start> I watch the bitter tears slalom down grief stricken faces
For a moments time I feel I am the god of which they speak
Under the guise of anonymity I masquerade in thrilling mockery
An erection juts begrudgingly from twixt my silken Sunday pleats
The coffin is sealed face to go unrevealed
But I dare know what lies underneath
Two bloodless halves of a dark flower dead
Whose dream turned the nightmare that dwells beneath our darkened beds
How pathetically I broke her like a doll of porcelain
I found her primed for a raping that could never be
In wanton fallacy the temptress played deceiving taunting charming fools like me
Her silhouette an hourglass whose sands of time would empty fast
A rose must remain with the sun and the rain or its lovely promise won't come true.
Than call me the nightfall the colder than death a winter unending that's stolen her breath
Dead and famous at last she's made it
Her mangled face
Haunting shameless
The death of peace
Endarkened times
Crowned an immortal yet stricken of life
The headlines read Young Starlet  Dead
Drained of her lifesblood and nourished with shit
Sodomized
Defeminized
Silent the victor
Vengeance is mine
In hell is where she waits for me
Seductress burns in sin
The succubus deceased
The funeral has ceased you can all rest at ease
My desire be not to kill again
I'll now disappear leaving legend to fear
So lock every door tight from now until eternity
Dead and famous at last she's made it
Her mangled face
Smiling shameless
The death of peace
Endarkened times
Crowned an immortal yet stricken of life
The headlines read Young Starlet  Dead
Drained of her lifesblood and nourished with shit
Sodomized
Defeminized
I am the victor
Vengeance is mine
I watched the bitter tears slalom down grief stricken faces
For a moments time I feel I am the god of which they speak
I the misogynist
Her crooked smile my seal of hatred
Incarnate of the beast
The god of which they speak <start> 
No warning no hesitation and nothing left to prove
Divided the strength is fading
Power you seek you use this hatred is overwhelming
And only seems to show no mercy
The freedom's calling bury the hatchet in vain

If only the chosen one had here the last time

Who saw the ending before it all began

And who went running before we took our stand


Forgotten the words have meanings
No ashes turned to stone and these questions
Will have no answers and won't leave you alone
The scarring this damage done now
The cuts run far too deep
With vengeance and violence rising
The time has come to destroy

The living and dying heart has beaten for the last time

Who saw the ending before it all began

And who went running before we took our stand

Never take a life worth living
The lifeblood runs black from killing
What you offer ain't worth giving
has beaten for the last time

Who saw the ending before it all began

And who went running before we took our stand

Never take a life worth living
What you offer ain't worth giving <start> Il y a longtemps

One can't live without the other
Each half makes a whole
Replace what is missing in your life
Complete your soul <start> All is gone
And my soul screams sorrow
All is lost
As I shiver for tomorrow
Tomorrow
I want to see this sorrow end
I want to feel joy again
The demons inside are here to stay
And life as know it fades away
Will the wounds in me never heal
The scares you left always be
Dare you turn behold the hurt you've done
All I wish for you is Damnation
I want to see this sorrow end
I want to feel joy again
The demons inside are here to stay
And life as know it fades away

I want to see this sorrow end
I want to feel joy again
The demons inside are here to stay
And life as know it fades away
Fades away... <start> As thunder borne upon the wind
Was heard the battle's wild uproar
See the angels of the dead
Seek blood dripping crimson red
Amidst the heaps of foemen slain
Drenched with battle's bloody rain
On the platemail rattled loud
The arrowshower's rushing cloud
Speartorrents swept away
Ranks of foes from light of day
In the dark the spears were whet
Grimly pointed metal shone
Dread the weapons of the knights
Battered shield and bloodsmeared swords
Ravens rainsoaked lurked the feast
Nesting redly the deceased
Grim the jaws that shook their shields
Red the fangs that bit the bones
Speartorrents swept away
Ranks of foes from light of day <start> It's just a reason to deny
All the limits that border
On the thinnest frailties
That makes a sudden change
I'll pay my soul into sleep
I'll make up words that I keep
Letting nothing go to anyone at all
Where is your loyalty now
When all the cards have been left on the table
Where is your loyalty now
When all the cards have been left on the table
All of them
Bleed at the nerves
That take so long
To wear down
I'll pay my soul into sleep
I'll make up words that I keep
Letting nothing go to anyone at all
Where is your loyalty now
When all the cards have been left on the table
Where is your loyalty now
When all the cards have been left on the table

This time I have made enough mistakes
For you to bear against me in direct break
Our original ideals you let us down
And betrayed our trust with all your promises
I see a piece of shit alive in you
Cast them near enough to be a truth
This time I have made enough mistakes
For you to bear against me in direct break
Our original ideals you let us down
And betrayed our trust with all your promises
Where is your loyalty now
When all the cards have been left on the table
Where is your loyalty now
When all the cards have been left on the table <start> Circus angel
Clipped wings
Bleed free of captivity
My heaven will have you
You don't miss your fire
Until your hell runs dry <start> She burns as bright as the sun
and she falls darker than night
She shines as light as these days
And she fades faster than time
Phoenix in flames <start> Pain on my body
Pain on my flesh
Needles of steel
Penetrate my skin
Needles they sink in my skin
Needles they spit black ink
Skull Death flying creature
Figures on my mortal corpse
Scythe Seal Pentagram
Marks on my skin <start> A kiss new year's eve is a gesture of hope
A kiss goodbye gives a lump in the throat
One inspires the other puts out fires
A love for kissing feet makes him a weirod
You kissing my ass makes you a big joke
Not so funny nothing to laugh about
No more what ifs no more what ifs
Wait man hey man hold on
No more what ifs no more what ifs
What if I'm obligated to keep you
I'll grit my teeth and sweep you
Under the rug
A stroll in the park can be a moment of zen
But you lurking in the dark
Begging to be my friend
Can really rub rubs me the wrong way
Following my tracks is what you do
Although I never remember ever giving a clue
Or a hint or a blatant come with me
No more what ifs no more what ifs
No more no more no more
No more what ifs no more what ifs
No more entry to your ravaged mind
I'll break the mold one of a kind
But you say I'm
Sincerely up yours
Positively up yours
Gotta fake it to the right and take a detour
Yeah you say I'm deep and truly up yours
Exclusively up yours
Finding you hard so hard to ignore
That's for sure
Sure as shit that's it
Firmly planted up yours
Seems to be
It's a chain link in your minds
Some parallel to our lives
I'm being followed by a sky scanner
With old Nasa parts from some
Black market dealer
In your grade school science project
You're trying to revive
Seems to be a delusion of grandeur
A twisted fucked up matter
A distorted sense of wrong and right
And that ain't right
Got your app with the police scanner
Mapped out daily planner
And the Krav Maga trainer in case of a fight
It's time to turn the tables on you
And get the hell out of dodge
Not a moment too soon
Gotta flee gotta drain the tank empty
This ugly bond is debatable
Obviously dysfunctional
Although I do admire your stalking abilities
No more what ifs no more what ifs
No more no more no more
No more what ifs no more what ifs
No more entry to your revaged mind
I'll break the mold one of a kind
But you say I'm
Up yours
Forcing me to say
You can shove it right up yours
You can stick it right up yours
Where the sun ain't shining up yours
With your social climbing up yours
You can sit and spin with it up yours
Sit down and rotate up yours
Release the floodgates up yours
Screw yourself and shove it right up yours
Directly up yours <start> Music S. Drover G. Drover
Lyrics S. Drover
Closing my eyes from a cynical world left behind
Memories gone without a trace
Emotional burnout  time spinning out of control
Diseases and wars from predictions of past
Taking fruition  how long can this last
Making my solace  erasing the pain as I fly
I'll equipped to comprehend
Modern day madness  can't fight to defend
My head tilted towards graying skies
Scriptures  now ponder as those passing by
What does this mean A part of the grand scheme
I seek the answers  is the message all to clear
The world is sifting through a gradual demise
The pain it brings to me  I focus through
It helps me to remain
Leaving the pain as I drift so far away
Masking my grief  I now seek a better place
Why do we have this pain
Why do we need to hate
What do we have to gain
I open my eyes  not to find a guilt or remorse
Finding my way  now to face the imminent storm....
Why do we have this pain
Why do we have to hate
Why can't we all create
Unification  to be as one
A beaming light penetrates the blackened sky
Angelic vision  I shudder to believe
You seek the truth  inquisition with no answers
To take my hand  reveals the answers you have never found
You choose to follow  the grand exit with no return
The warm light's invitation  glows upon my face
My hand extended  to rid myself this pain and anguish
Rising above the clouds  I turn to give the world  final embrace
The final embrace
What does this mean A part of the grand scheme
I seeked the answers  now the message  all too clear
The world is sifting through a gradual demise
My life has come to pass  with apathy I glide towards the sky <start> Further away each and every day
I'll find a way to cross every ocean
Loneliness a permanent emotion
Wherever may the journeyman stay
I'm on my way from somewhere to anywhere
I have learned not to ask when
I'll be there
You don't have to call me homeless
I'm at home in every place
But wherever I may go
I'll never be coming back home
The east and west northlands and the rest
It's all the same it's all a fair game
Loneliness has become my second name
But something still keeps up the flame <start> Tenderness is greed
Yearning is remorse
Love me so that I can abuse you
Sin after sin I feel endless shame
This land is afraid of the light
This soul is short of bitterness
Tenderness is beautiful
Yearning is strange
Leave me so that I can miss you
Sin anfter sin I feel endless shame <start> Turn the lights down low
And bolt the door up
Future is coming
Future rising up
Whoa
Shotgun blast a demon piece of lead
With both eyes open
I wait up for the kill
Feel the evil
Feel the heat as I blast you open
Death comes ripping
And it's going death comes ripping
You feel the heat as death comes ripping
Rip your back out
And death comes ripping out
Flesh and blood
Too weak for you
Turning it over
A little too late to penetrate
Death comes ripping
And it's going death comes ripping
You feel the heat as death comes ripping
Rip your back out
Death comes ripping
And it's going death comes ripping
You feel the heat as death comes ripping
Rip your back out
Death comes ripping
And I know that death comes ripping out
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa <start> Can you feel my hands
Longing for you
But they can't reach
What they desire
I keep my dreams safe and warm
Don't let nobody know
You're still in my soul
But dreams are just dreams
They fade like waves in the sea
Nothing can take me there
Where I long to be
I just stay by myself
Don't tell nobody but you
are still in my soul
I won't cry no tears
My wounds will heal through the years
And in the end is just you and me
I'll write your name in a tree
'Cause you're my one and only love
As the years go by
I took your picture in my hand
It lost a bit of the colour
But the magic still remains the same
I keep my dreams safe and warm
Don't let nobody know
That you're still in my soul
I won't cry no tears
My wounds will heal through the years
And in the end is just you and me
I'll write your name in a tree
'Cause you're my one and only love
I won't cry no tears
My wounds will heal through the years
And in the end is just you and me
I'll write your name in a tree
'Cause you're my one and only love <start> Don't bite the hand that feeds you
Rather saw it off at the shoulder and bury the blade
Incinerate the torsos and start a fresh page in the journal of life
Your secrets hold little value when nobody is left to hear them <start> Demon come live in me
Possession fill me with disease
Temptation a fire set aflame
Feral instincts help me go insane
Shameless searching endlessly
To appease the burning urge in me
Hunger of a thousand wolverines
Satisfaction by any means
Demon replace all I've been taught
Impulse erase all second thought
Gambling in this carnal game
Nothing is all where everything's the same
Trembling in the balance
Exploring new extremes
All sweet forms of self destruction
Coming to me in my dreams <start> Music and Lyrics by James Malone
To celebrate the guilt 
And tattoo their words upon your everscarring flesh.

To make believe there is no guilt to wield the liar's dagger
And clasp his hand to celebrate the countless unborn bastards.
To praise the guilt some more in the eyes of the fallen.
Embracing the swine this foreplay strangulation.

Though your disease is ever mine I give you diamonds.
And in an act to seal the oath I gave you roses be careful of the fucking thorns.
In your eyes I saw the end and these were your words the promise of never.
Denial protect whats promise of the fact that our feeling dissolve.
I took your evil skin away with the blade of the liar's dagger
And clasped your hand to celebrate your vile unborn bastard.
Denial protect whats promise of the fact that our feeling dissolve.
Though your disease is ever mine I gave you diamonds.
And in an act to seal the oath I gave you roses be careful of the fking thorns.
In your eyes I saw the end these were your words the promise of never. <start> Anybody Killa
I can see the Earth startin' to shift
Inside out
No trace of the moon
since the face burnt out
Watch the rain fall down
hard and heavy
Dark black like dirt
but it will burn severely
You can call it the body of the Lotus
Hand of the magical supernatural keeping you focused
If the rain didn't get ya
then your here for a reason
To spread the word to the world
That the pod is in season
Monoxide Child
You can hear the thunder clap
The full moon gleaming like the eyes of a cat
The Dark Lotus is back 
And you can feel the ground pulsating
And all the haters start hating
but its all been anticipated
And we been waitin' till the timing is right
To get to bombin' on you bitches who misguided the light
And anybody who don't get it
get the fuck out my sight
Bitch I ain't explaining
I'm just claimin' your life Bitch
Chorus
Black Raindrops keep falling down

These Black Raindrops keep falling down

These Black Raindrops keep falling down

These Black Raindrops keep falling down

I stick a running chainsaw blade all down your throat
And fuckin' outta ya ass
I cut ya body in half
I gotta be bloody
Leave somebody blood on my body
I need to be the bloodiest
of bloody bodies and hotties
I'm 'bout to murda for the Lotus
Black Rain it falls upon us
And I don't need normal therapy I know who I am
And I don't like a blade through your brain do ya KA BLAM
ac <start> One step beyond Running straightforward into nocturnal
silence The quest for eternal nightmare Full embrace
the darkness lifts you Fire that burns the light Eager
to touch the flickering flame What you seek it's
within you The tasteless sin of the unforgiven To
taste the pleasures of the night Leave us with our
sins With our sins we hold them with grace On a
pedestal of power We have learned to embrace Coming
forth roaring from the darkest places A day with out
light familiar masses mutilated with out faces The
weak a great feast an ungodly prophecy Destroying and
devastating the pathetic majority The weak abandon and
crushed utterly Nothing more they hold nothing more
they can embrace For all is gone Nothing to salvage
only life I have slayed A price they pay Confrontation
and mass desecration Prophetic obliteration key of
devastation The treasure of lies a gift of evil And
such a prize I am awarded In thy arms I embrace the
heartless A cause for celebration The old are left to
die The cancellation the end of life In the eyes of
lifeless wanders I see eternity For this is the
treasures of darkness The gift within us all. <start> Con adorno de buen escolazo

Pure rage as yet unforeseen
Once my mind is at its death
My reign shall forever be
Victory  my soul has been destroyed
Slaughter  of the countless hordes
War  unites the strong to rise
Torture  pure evil has been renewed
My form's an untamed beast
Roaming a land for which I do not care
This existence is incomplete
Until I taste the wines of their defeat
Pain  I no longer can withstand
Blood  I taste upon my lips
Death  unto the shapes of flesh
Hate  is what I possess <start> Come bringers of sickness and death

this breeding sorrow
you're too close to see
as the pride inside of you
is smashed to smithereens
this fire hunts the soulless and the weak
bursting out the madness in me
and through all the that fear I have to keep
I still pretend to be real
you can't resist
all those fools beside you
spread your arms and share
this hatred with me
as it smashes your soul to smithereens
this fire hunts the soulless and the weak
bursting out the madness in me

I still pretend to be real <start> Nothing to see here outlined in white
just the red on the carpet

why do it just for the fashion
where oh where has my baby been
i would die to hear your voice
you've been gone so long i can't feel you
and your hand on my heart beating true
did you think i'd live without you
you belonged to me
i miss your face
i lost my place
i lost my faith <start> Now I See The Sign. Sunrise of my life. Darkness fades away. A New day has begun.
Looking for the answer to the meaning of my life. It's hard to see the future when the love is gun. The Media is sending out a message to the world. It's the time to analyze it before it breaks me down.
I Close my eyes. I say my prayer. Dear god save me from this hell.
Now I See The Sign. Sunrise of my life. Darkness fades away. A New day has begun.
Running for the prize. I want to be a star. No matter what it costs I want to be the one. Soon I Realize this is not the end for me. The Creator of my life touched my empty soul.
I close my eyes. I say my prayer. Dear God save me from this hell.
Now I See The Sign. Sunrise of my life. Darkness fades away. A New day has begun.
The Lord is my shepard. I shall not lack. He makes me to lie down. In green pastures. He leads me beside restful water. He revives my soul. He leads in path of rightousness. For his name's sake.
Now I See The Sign. Sunrise of my life. Darkness fades away. Now I see the Sing. <start> I am war machine
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue over metal endoskeleton

Do you know who programmed who

Killing people is what I do

My mission prerogative is to see this through
I am.. a war machine

You are the one who sent me x

I am a war machine x <start> Yes you should have seen her face
Straight out of Peyton Place
Pseudo movie star
Total disgrace
Beggin' on her hands and knees
Won't you just love me please
I've got my life to lead
Lead yours as well
Beautiful home
White picket fence
Fairytale
The pain starts When the Quaalude ends
Learn to pacify
Then you justify
Never satisfied
The truth always hurts
Well I woke up in heavy sweat
The sheets stretched I was soaking wet
A light bulb in my sleep
Went off in my head
Two places at one time
Can't be done by mankind
I hate to say I'm feeling confined
From the top of the world to a sunken ship
No in between
Karma sure can be a frazzled trip
Learn to testify
Can't be rectified
Ain't no lullaby
The truth always hurts
Learn to pacify
Learn to qualify A
lways mortified
The truth always hurts
Bet your ass
One day you're king of the world
Indestructible T
hen you're knocked off your pedestal
Just been crucified
Harmed and horrified
Ain't no alibi
The truth always hurts
Time to occupy
Simply no deny
Better say goodbye
The truth always hurts
Learn to pacify
They you justify
Never satisfied
The truth always hurts
The story goes on and on and on
Somebody else will be a victim
The ends is here
It's a fact of life
The truth always hurts <start> Welcome to your life of concentration
The killing has just begun
Another disposable creation
There is no place to run
Electrodes are attached around your body
Needles are injected in your skin
Disrupted life expectancy
No spirit no soul no sin
Chorus
Instruments of death are cutting through your mind
Exposing a disease you thought was hard to find
No one ever said that life would be so kind
With instruments of death
As part of this routine examination
He'll force you to relax and to unwind
Slicing into your imagination
All positive emotions left behind
Behold  The deadly doctor's scalpel
As it cuts into your brain
A victim of worthless anesthesia
You die in pain  no gain
Chorus x <start> Unseen and deadly
Phantom of the skies
Tool of mass destruction
Child of an insane mind
Millions are dead
Millions will die
Rejoice this day
As death rain from the skies
Deformed freaks
Survivors of the blast
Incinerated existence
Even death can last
Winds of destruction
Sweep the earth
World murder
This is the new order
No turning back
Drop the iron first
Uncountable casualties
Life cease to exist
Deformed freaks
Survivors of the blast
Incinerated existence
Even death can last <start> Standing alone inside a frantic crowd with incriminating facts in hand.
An imperative vision of satisfaction.
My overwhelmed pupils contain illegible mortification.
I feel the numbness of an orgasm as I leave my entire body.
Endorphins are released generating complete ecstasy.
Standing alone inside a frantic crowd with incriminating facts in hand.
An imperative vision of satisfaction.
My overwhelmed pupils contain illegible mortification.
I feel the numbness of an orgasm as I leave my entire body.
Inside my cerebral cortex lies an ultimate pleasure better than any sensation.
Turned into a powerless corpse I succumb.
My brain's mechanical capacity has clearly stopped running.
Restrictions of flesh...
A magenta fluid escorts my soul to a perfect and reflexive coma
as I decline within this ideal trance.
I can no longer feel pain.
I only see my blackened blood flowing out of my veins my carnal shroud.
I'm not furious about what you've wrecked.
In fact I want to thank you I want to love you.
My blood flows.
But at this instant I'm not furious.
No need to say a word.
I leave with fervor covering my heart. <start> Torrid tales from the rats
They're filled with disgust
I'm closer to closure now than
I've ever been
It's so honestly honest just who's my friend
And who's riding the coattails 'til the end
Sure as shit
There's nothing that will change me
There's nothing sure as shit
Now there's no quick fix
You're broke
No quick fix
You're broke
No price for power
Bring the fight
Bring the fight
To the floor
No price for power
Bring the fight
Bring the fight
To the floor
No price for power
I'm pushed to the limit
In my heart I've got malice
Cultivated in Cali
And wasted in wonderland
Better the devil you know
Than the one you don't
You can not trust
Another and you know you won't
Sure as shit
There's nothing that will change me
There's nothing sure as shit
Now there's no quick fix
You're broke
No quick fix
You're broke
No price for power
Bring the fight
Bring the fight
To the floor
No price for power
Bring the fight
Bring the fight
To the floor
No price for power
Annihilate to obliterate
Step fucking in
And redeem your fate
Shot to the center of everything
Welcome to the new world
Bring the fight
Bring the fight
To the floor
No price for power
Bring the fight
Bring the fight
To the floor
No price for power <start> Music Eric Horton
Lyrics Sean Peck
You say you'd see me on my way
I look at you I guess I should have known
I'm watching for you my friend
If I see you once again I'll scream
A tragedy you've come undone
Got nowhere for you to run
You're crying out it's all in vain
Somethings never seem to change because...
He's got the Devil inside
Look at the Angel's eyes
Looking to sacrafice the sanctity of life
The sanctity of life
Your victims pile alarming rates
You've gone this far you don't hesitate
You know it's time to lay it down
Not too late to turn it around
You know...
He's got the Devil inside
Look at the Angel's eyes
Looking to sacrafice the sanctity of life
The sanctity of life
You're shifting points of view an influence alive
Something's coming over you changing you inside
End of the line has come at last
You knew it would but not this fast
You've gone to far you've crossed the line
Save yourself seek the divine
He's got The Devil inside
Look at the Angel's eyes
Looking to sacrifice the sanctity of life
He's got the Devil inside
Look at the Angel's eyes
Looking to sacrifice the sanctity of life
He's looking to sacrifice the sanctity of life
He's looking to sacrifice the sanctity of life <start> Acting like mo jo's
Acting like body bagger's
Let the bells ring
Rejoice and sing
Jim Jones where did you come from
Jim Jones was it for fun
Jim Jones that's your name
Jim Jones style of death
This sects the promised land
Are you ready to all meet god
Bart's killers holding hands
Do not fight the odds
Try to make 'em sick drink up
Be merry and be dead
Jim Jones where did you come from
Jim Jones was it for fun
Jim Jones that's your name
Jim Jones style of death
Murder murder murder
The zero hero
Some of them might get sex
Together with that boring joke
Mercenaries disciples
With bibles and rifles
In temple of people
To the book of people
No poster hanging high
And I do but I don't ask why
And I do but I don't ask why
And I do but I don't ask why
And I do but I don't ask why
And I do but I don't ask why
And I do but I don't ask why
And I do but I don't ask why
Ah hahahaha
Oh Lord you die <start> I can't waste away I'm slowly losing my way forever
Better raise your slave for me anymore
Daylight's sin inside day's growing closer wait for pain
I cannot wait another night to be alone
Voices are calling me 'be my night' this devil's sigh
Yeah shadows are tainting me yeah
I know that only you can render pain
Peace of mind you run away from me
So make me lose my mask of sanity
I can't waste away I'm slowly getting my way forever
Better is what I used to feel alone
Shattered light's sin in taint day's growing longer wait for pain
I cannot wait another night to be with you
Peace of mind you run away from me
So make me lose my mask of sanity
Peace of mind you run away from me
So make me lose my mask of sanity <start> Head bowed in silence
Scarcely sane in mind
Strung out internal violence
Confusion fills my time
Stare back at my face neurotic eyes
Joy and despair collides
It's eating me up from the inside
Don't look back
Remember yesterday no way
Going through the cast
Turning insane by their games
Stare at my world with psychotic eyes
The demons in me unite
I hear them laughing in the rain
Chanting out my name
The echoes turn into flames <start> I was born in ashes of molten hatred
Raised by demons in abodes of the end
The reaper's scythe I fall upon to light my path
Wrecked by mangled wounds of life
I have become become the resurrection of the evil one
'Yknow that I don't fucking care If I live or die
I need a bishop preaching fire to get away with my sins
I despise everything I see so I don't give a fuck if ya hate me
Ain't got respect for humanity
Never lived or wanted immortality
The reaper's shadow I fall upon to obscure my path
Every day I'm being battered up until I bleed
You motherfuckas just leave me be
Ya could never give me cure for the pain I feel inside
Led by the reaper I walk in the night
Show me the way to yer kingdom come <start> Children babies and boys
that live in this century
want to destroy
all that is possible
with their evil minds
with their sharpest knives
and horrible eyes.
Nazi babies with cadaver eyes
emerge from the ocean
to bring destruction
life crazy monsters
with countless tentacles
advance in the darkness
on a hopeless night.
They leave the message of their evolution
the scheme of a life
based on our death
They have no feelings
and no human genes
they're only machines
come forth from our dread.
Humanity needs new generations
so don't be surprised by their horrible eyes <start> Deathdreams of your future bring my spirit back to life
Once again to make you suffer more than you can take
Keeping you alive without the hope of healing
Your mind will beg your body to cease
Vengeful abilities beyond imagination
Insanity the exit where you wish your mind could go
Waiting at the limits where salvation cannot follow
Unforgiving of trespasses made
The delight of your dead
Facing fear losing breath
Forcefully your enemy
Even after death
Aggression is the trigger flowing
From a mind deranged
The urge to kill you slowly
Living nightmare come to life
The doors to pain are open
Mutilation closing in
The thump of your ripped out heart is my law
Like a hammer crushing in reality gives out
No use for pathetic attempts of escape
Resisting me will only bury you deep
Within these hellish events
Lead Sahlgren
I'm the angel of death my friend
I'll haunt you to the rivers end
An addiction fueled by hate
Retaliate
Mesmerized enchanted by the fury burning light
Join me in my pleasure become what I create
The gates are closed eternally
For prayers it's too late
I'm the serpent saviour confess to me
Retaliation seals your fate
Reliving is denied
Shattering the image of a paradise in reach
Mentally emotionally spiritually deceased
Crimson tide drowning your soul forever <start> How the hell'd we wind up like this
Why weren't we able
To see the signs that we missed
Try and turn the tables
I wish you'd unclench your fists
And unpack your suitcase
Lately there's been too much of this
But don't think it's too late
Nothing's wrong just as long as you know that someday I will
Someday somehow
I'm gonna make it alright but not right now
I know you're wondering when

Someday somehow
I'm gonna make it alright but not right now
I know you're wondering when
Well I'd hope that since we're here anyway
We could end up saying
Things we always needed to say
So we could end up staying
Now the story's played out like this
Just like a paperback novel
Let's rewrite an ending that fits
Instead of a Hollywood horror
Nothing's wrong just as long as you know that someday I will
Someday somehow
I'm gonna make it alright but not right now
I know you're wondering when

Someday somehow
I'm gonna make it alright but not right now
I know you're wondering when

How the hell'd we wind up like this
Why weren't we able
To see the signs that we missed
Try and turn the tables
Now the story's played out like this
Just like a paperback novel
Let's rewrite an ending that fits
Instead of a Hollywood horror
Nothing's wrong just as long as you know that someday I will
Someday somehow
I'm gonna make it alright but not right now
I know you're wondering when

Someday somehow
I'm gonna make it alright but not right now
I know you're wondering when

I know you're wondering when

I know you're wondering when <start> Trying so hard to forget to remember. One sip to take the sorrow. One sip to face tomorrow. Sip swallow your pride wallow and hide. Hollow inside and I wish that I could take the sun and make it shine take your pain and make it mine. I can't do anything at all. I can't keep catching when you fall. If I can't do anything at all what can I do Open the bottle and erase your memories. Stumble and fall sipping and slipping away from it all. Take your pain and make it mine. Take the sun and make it shine. Take your shoes and walk in mine. Walk in mine. <start> Psychodelic band gives them a rhytm
swollen procession in disgusting hops
look at the blind  men following the sound
exciting cacophony  money play but...
...I leave the shadow of my shapely ass
for these sick prophets leave them alone
let them creep let them rot in peace
in their poplin poplin twist
In morbid dance
You stifle
In morbid dance
You stifle
In morbid dance
I am indignant at this dancing
I'm gonna vomit I'm burning out
and crowd is howling in ecstasy
bravo for conductor money play but...
...I leave the shadow of my...
In morbid dance
you stifle 
Close this shed
Sister you became wild
you shake your ass in a bad rhytm
my dear friend you lose your good manners
In morbid dance
you stifle 
If you only feel the blues jah jah jah <start> No more reign of crosses
with hanging corpses of god's son
Enough damned bells
of false asshole's temples
I raise the ancient gods
I summon the honest spirits
I revive the ancient magic
I draw the might from the moonshine
I keep the holy fire
All for the everlasting revange
All for the honest masters
Lords of the black forest
Rulers of Night and Darkness
Gods of the ancient  Europe
Pagan winds of distant North
The might of unholy Norvay's forest
is in you
Cold gloom and power
True Evil and good
Give us what are we waiting for the
millenium
And soon the Cromleches
will be full of christian blood
We will kill in the moonshine
We will become the killers
shadows of each christian
Their temples will be covered by blood
We will destroy their altars
We will turs into ashes their graves
For burned witches
For lost beliefe and might
For Pagan and Heretic's blood
For trees and forest of killed Druids
For our lost gods... <start> You live in a world that is just Most of the people who seem to be Way too strange to conceive Angel's dressed in black Lost in the dark  Are they all too real Always a good time never lonely Suddenly realized the blood red tears from my eyes There was nothing much I could do But watch you die Time after time Metal Icarus Burnt your wings on the sun First time I met you I wanted To be by your side Those days are gone And let my hair grow long But I still fly by night Bringing life to the dead Even through times when I felt lonely Suddenly realized the blood red tears from my eyes There was nothing much I could do But watch you die Burnt your wings on the sun Metal Icarus Time after time Night after night Metal Icarus Upon forces unknown I can still feel the windy heights Ah Those were the years Against my skin And if I close my eyes I'm flying over hills <start> Upon this mount I fand a tree wat gyf agayne my soule to me

Old English <start> Fate changed
Life healed like a wound
How does the kind of life heal
That leaves such a scar
I cover myself I uncover myself
Now I know how to do things
No longer will I listen to any talk
Now I know and it's working
Everything hurts inside of me
Out from the frozen lake
She finally grew into her full might
She grew from a tiny thing
On this lake as I drove there to meet her <start> Go
I'm still there
I'm still there
So you think you're familiar with me
Well I passed long before you
Looked in these eyes
Went on vanished left this temple young
On a crowded bedside
Piercing voices high screams
Through a stained yellow wall
Long before you spoke words to me
I departed on perpetual nightfall
I'm still there pure trauma
Frame by frame pure trauma
I'm still there
Reach right through me
And I know you question my unsteady motion
Wanted to lay myself to rest long ago
But my life sings on on
Thinking it would blow into a petty dust of gathering
Nothing but visions flourish
Through the hallways of my mind
Holding haunting
I'm still there pure trauma
Frame by frame pure trauma
I'm still there
Pure trauma
I'm still there pure trauma
Frame by frame pure trauma
I'm still there
I'm still there pure trauma
I'm still there
I'm still there pure trauma
Pure trauma <start> Evil dick

Late at night evil dick he comes to me he says

Late at night evil dick he wakes me up he says
Don't sleep alone don't sleep alone don't sleep alone
Don't sleep alone don't sleep alone
Evil dick evil dick
Evil dick evil dick
I had this girl she said she loved me
Thought there was no one ever above me
She wanted to marry and have my child
But evil dick he had to get buck wild
Took me out one night out with the freaks
If ever there was pussy evil dick would seek
My girl caught me skeezin' she said I wasn't shit
I said It wasn't me baby it was the muthafucka evil dick
Late at night evil dick he comes to me he says
Don't sleep alone don't sleep alone
Late at night evil dick he wakes me up he says

Don't sleep alone don't sleep alone don't sleep alone
Don't sleep alone don't sleep alone <start> When the divine portion began to fade away
And became diluted too often and too much
With the mortal admixture
And the human nature got the upper hand
They then being unable to bear their fortune
Behaved unseemly
And in a single day and night of misfortune
All your warlike men
In a body sank into the earth
And the island of Atlantis
In like manner disappeared
Into the depths of the sea <start> Undead feast as they tear upon your weak flesh
Terror builds at the thought of being dead
Prophecy of the wise men of old
Now comes true as the corpses break the soil
Ancient spell breaks the sleep of the dead
The dead awake what the populace is fearing
Panic strikes as the nations run in fear
Oceans boil with blood of human victims
Suicide the only way to avoid being eaten by the undead
Grave yards coming alive with zombies hungry for living flesh
Psychotic transmutated corpses usurping the population
Sickening disaster of epidemic proportions devouring us
Tables turn as a victim I've become now
State of death only waiting to return
Vital signs that show I'm dead
This can't happen I'm rising from my own grave
Hunger grows not nutritional but instinctual
Flesh becomes my only crave of this live
Unthinking state a state of metamorphosis
Seeking food to keep me dead
Degenerate a product of man's frustration for his terror
Insatiable hunger for mankind building with each kill
Seeking human victims to meet my fill
Cannibal I've become what's happened to my brain
Feast on the corpse suck out his brain
As its fluids drip down the drain
Chew on the bones drink from its bladder
The vile stench only makes me madder
In through the mouth out the forehead
Brains fall out skin turns red
Violent surge a spear through the skull
Felt the urge now my heart's full
I crave gore I'll eat your guts
I love gore blood drives me nuts
I drink blood I don't like water
Intestines my cud I feast in the slaughter
Twist its neck make it crack
Suicide the only way to avoid being eaten by the undead
Grave yards coming alive with zombies hungry for living flesh
Psychotic transmutated corpses usurping the population
Sickening disaster of epidemic proportions devouring us
Blood I want to drink I want to suck
Brains I want to eat the rest I'll chuck
Bones into a spear I'll carve and kill
Hunger for the quest I'll never fill
I crave gore I'll eat your guts <start> There's nothing I can't face
So open the flood gates
No fear of what's to come
I'm not going under
Not running for cover
Standing against the sun
After the fire after the flames
Nothing will feel the same
My scars are closing my heart is open
I am not afraid
I'm ready to burn again
I'm beginning to catch my breath
I'm ready to dream again
Surviving will love me for take
I had to bleed to lose
Find myself to prove
I could feel love without you
I'm all that I have
I am the aftermath
Show with no mercy
Cause it cannot hurt me
No more will I bite my tongue
Tired of worthless fighting the purpose
No long I will last stay numb
After the fire after the flames
Nothing will feel the same
My scars are closing my heart is open
I am not afraid
I'm ready to burn again
I'm beginning to catch my breath
I'm ready to dream again
Surviving will love me for take
I had to bleed to lose
Find myself to prove
I could feel love without you
I'm all that I have
I am the aftermath
Break my bones you will see
You can't kill me you can't kill me
Break my bones you will see
You can't kill me you can't kill me
You can't kill me
I'm ready to break again
I'm beginning to catch my breath
I'm ready to dream again
Surviving will love me for take
I had to bleed to lose
Find myself to prove
I could feel love without you
I'm all that I have
I'm all that I have
I'm all that I have
I am the aftermath
I am the aftermath

Break my bones you will see
You can't kill me you can't kill me
Break my bones you will see
You can't kill me you can't kill me <start> Up in the sky beyond the stars
Lies the answer to who we are
When time was born the gods lived in peace
Lucifer was beloved by them all
And taught him the creationary pattern
Physics of birth Merkaba
Our infernal living force but instead
He procreated a new race somewhat out in space
In incubators they were born bred to fight the great war
In the heavens his goal was to conquer battle broke out
Many angels and grey died others led the sky
The gods grew angry and cast Satan to hell
The captured greys were sent to Mars.
Raping angels destroying hope asteroids used to fight the way
Awaiting the night when Satan will rise growing smarter all the time
Left brained demigods creating beasts that fly
Unholy vengeance in the sky
Lasers attack the pearly gates.
Invasion.
St. Michael prevailed this war
Defending his precious sky
And his faithful servants all the angels who have died
The galactic federation are despised
After years of plotting the second attack was not successful either
Still they wait to avenge
Galaxies and constellations are at war
The quest to kill the god for ever more
Monuments on Mars record the tale of a universe that thrived with life
Now their planet is devoured they need to survive
Blasting through the sky evolve throughout the century.
The galactic federation loathes these deities
Living here on earth they breed
Awaiting the Lucifer rebellion  will they succeed
None of this is true but it's how things are. <start> In my life I made a choice
To be what I have to be
But when I am to see myself in the mirror
I can't contain my pain
It looks me right in the eye
The secrets that I hide
Mean that in no one I can confide
I chose this life and fall to secrecy
But in the end it turns on me
The longest day of my life
This is the longest day of my life
It's time to pick up the pieces
And build it back together
When I was young I saw my best friends die
I'm not gonna let you go
I'll be by your side forever
In my life I broke a promise
I said I will always be there
I'm coming to find you to bring you back
This pain that I try to hide
Because I play your whole lie cannot defy
This time I'll change
I'll do things differently
I'll never let you go
Protect you with my life
This is the longest day of my life
It's time to pick up the pieces
And build it back together
When I was young I saw my best friends die
I'm not gonna let you go
I'll be by your side forever
Countless times they say I crossed the line
But ask me how many lives I saved in time
Innocents don't have to die
Not in my war
Not on my time
I'll do what I have to do until I die
This is my last day before I walk away
I'm coming to take your beautiful love
We'll be folly again
So you question my decisions now
Let me ask you how you'll feel
If all that mattered to you was so suddenly ripped away
Would you fight for it
Would you cross the line
Or would you let them slip away
I did my life
This is my last day before I walk away
I'm coming to take your beautiful love
We'll be folly again
And a day will come
When the warriors standing
Will be you and me
And that day has come
I'ts all they sing of
The final day for me is here
The final day is here
This is the longest day of my life
It's time to pick up the pieces
And build it back together
When I was young I saw my best friends die
I'm not gonna let you go
I'll be by your side forever
This is the longest day
It's time to pick up the pieces
And build it back together
This is the longest day
It's time to pick up the pieces
And build it back together
Picking up the pieces <start> Yo Kanye blow the hook you a genius boy
Now when you hear this song you know it's on babygirl
When you hear this song you know it's on
When you hear this song you know it's on
I swear your loving got me so high I'm gone
Me and you babygirl like best friends
Let me hit you when I get the notion
On I you and I
Let's ride hit the motion
Some say she freaky freaky
Let me guess your lidro needa
I'm hittin' through the back and curves
Hell they sell the herb
Now open up your mind to this concept
Then you take one step
Straight from the feelin' of a wordsmith
That's the herb shit
Up on my  spins
In my baby blue benz
Girls say dat boys ben actin up
But that's the way he is
You lookin' good when you steppin' out a centerfold
Tell me when I reach a pen to hold
Let me hit you wit this dime in the street game
Let a motherfucker go yeah you know it
So now let me sugarcoat it
It's like I'm on that tight herb
And when I pull t the curb it's like it's like
Your my latest and my greatest
My latest my greatest
Your my latest and my greatest
My latest my greatest
When I'm layin' in the back of my 
With my lips on you
Spittin' good game
With the hustler grain
Gettin' brained like a hustler should
Hustler would
And you know when I hear the stuff
I'm still tryin' to hear this love what that do
It's like that baby when I mix it up baby gurl you just got me sprung
What that do
Oh yes she's one of the best
As I touch this is past tense I'm hurtin'
Lurkin' searchin' for the virgin
But when my babygurl it's workin'
Let me know what's that you smokin'
From the hands as I stick my tongue in
Then from the back but she want an autograph
But still we sexin'
Open back up last time
As I spit a little dough in my mind
She just like one of a kind
No see's no stand in her hind
She's just like me rappin' a line
Perfect let me drop in a dime
I'm on a roll again
I'm bought to blow again
Your my latest and my greatest
My latest my greatest
Your my latest and my greatest
My latest my greatest
Just keep on liftin' me up yeah
Higher

No need to take another puff

Higher

Cause your love has got me high enough
No No NoNo No No

Just keep on Lifting me up yeah
Higher

No need to take another puff

Higher

Cause your love has got me high enough
No No NoNo No No
Just keep on Lifting me up yeah <start> we are the fire
burning higher and higher
fear our wake of devastation
hear our hatred elevated
we are the fire of offering <start> According to the Aztec calender  is the end of the world
And time will unwind with a celestial cross in in the sky's in sync
And in line with itself so forget life as you know it
If you wanna view life in the eyes of a poet
Peer through mine in this fearful time
Where wages are cut but tax keeps growing
When the globe collapses on it's axis
Watch men women and children with axes
Fighting for food cause
And they haven't got jack shit
It looks like disasters back with a sting like elastic
But on a whole new scale now I'm talking inter galactic
Genocide in a moment of madness
As some set on the end of days
Capital city's burning in flames
Ocean swept your possessions away
Welcome to the end of days
As some set on end of days
There ain't no escaping natures rage
And I've never seen an atheist pray
Until the approaching of judgment day
Buildings burning
Pilgrims verming
Children are serving
Searching for earnings
Old bill are lurking
Circle the circuit
City cameras are perving
Don't park there if you ain't got a permit
Murders occurring but low level crime is the type their concerned with
Yeah with a microchip bill gates is a serpent in person
You relied on emergency service  says a lot when you turn it
The devil in disguise all loves been deserted
I'm watching animosity spread like herpes
I visualize alien crafts descending on earthlings
And all homosapiens left in the dirt like worms when there squirming
I smell petrol burning
As some set on the end of days
Capital city's burning in flames
Ocean swept your possessions away
Welcome to the end of days
As some set on end of days
There ain't no escaping natures rage
And I've never seen an atheist pray
Until the approaching of judgment day
Insight into a world of decline
Like Michelle Nostradammas mind
A moment of peace is harder to find
The thicker the skin the darker the mind
 accompany stars that are sent from the sky
A lot of men are repenting tonight
You wasted your life now wave it goodbye
New world orders an anagram of now
So we ain't got time to be standing around
Devil's on your doorstep
He's got you in a tight grip like a fore step thundering down <start> Born in the trash  it's the pain that I feel
You men with power  can't you see that I'm real
You call yourself civilized  treat me like a slave
It feels like I carry  my own cross to the grave
You leave me no chance  to live my own life
You force me to live  my life by the knife
And up there you sit  you've locked up your doors
Chossin' my fate  in the name of the law
I'm alive  but I'm not free
I might as well be dead
Life in the trash  beyond all compare
Life in the trash  hope's not enough for me
You fight wars with words  and act so polite
But sill you decide  what is good and right
But don't you forget  that time conquers all
Usurers die  and empires fall <start> You told me to smile so I smile on command
You told me to scream so I did it again
I jump when you say cause I thought you would lead
But now you've crawled in my mind and you're not planning to leave
If you come if you go if you stay
I'll remember your face either way
Chorus
I used to be an angel now I'm angel dust
I used to be an angel now I'm angel dust
I lay on my side just to give him a reason
Yeah I drink every night just to make it seem easy
If I don't give him his way he just cuts off my wings
Am I a fucking disgrace That's what he wants me to think
I used to be an angel now I'm angel dust
I used to be an angel now I'm angel dust
I'll skin the skin I'm living in
No one ever told me it would be like this
Yeah I wanna feel better but I just don't fit
I'll skin the skin I'm living in
No one ever told me it would be like this
Yeah I wanna feel better but I just don't fit
I used to be an angel now I'm angel dust
I used to be an angel now I'm angel dust
I got it I got it
I got it I got it I got it
I got it I got it
I got it I got it I got it
No one no one no one <start> Spinning out mind 
That's headache taste on the tip of my tongue
I can't take you 
You're so bitter better get up and run
Warning eye for an eye
When revenge comes charging
Warning eye for an eye
You won't see it coming
You won't see it coming
If you carry on you won't win that fight
If you take me on you'll find my breaking point
Please don't test my 
My short fuse you don't wanna ignite
Do not scratch the 
Don't wake the beast 'cause he's ready to bite
Warning eye for an eye
When revenge comes knocking
Warning eye for an eye
You won't feel it coming
You won't feel it coming
If you carry on you won't win that fight
If you take me on you'll find my breaking point
If you carry on you won't win that fight
If you take me on you'll find my breaking point
Everybody's got a breaking point
Nobody wants to see that side of me
Stop pushing 'cause I won't back down
Nobody's gonna bring that by me
It's an eye for an eye
It's an eye for an eye
It's an eye for an eye
It's an eye for an eye
If you carry on you won't win that fight
If you take me on you'll find my breaking point
If you carry on you won't win that fight
If you take me on you'll find my breaking point
I'm at my breaking point <start> You should have seen this coming from miles and miles away
God knows you had your best face forward
Soothing the soul with words of solace
Spoken like a true devil
Change your colors chameleon
But I still smell your stench in the morning air
the hawk always flies alone over an empty filed
For the deceiver dual blades to slit the throat
Give up the ghost that's all she wrote  ways to hate you
I'll see your forked tongue as my trophy
Compromise compromise
I'll be your scapegoat you'll be my sacrificial lamb
All lies are truth until your lies are revealed
Well look who's bleeding now who's bleeding
Now how does it feel when you are inside the scope
How does it feel to be the game so look who's bleeding now
Who's bleeding how could you foretell your own demise
Fall Babylon fall
Death to the obsession <start> Erase all borders cultural esperanto
Let the people be paupers and the customer king
A stable market exclusive for cosmopolitical elites
May the plebs all be ethnic they will fight we will sing
Peace
Wealth
Growth
Progress
How many poor do we need to prosper
How much starvation to make GNP rise
Why are we sliding into hell when they are pointing at Heaven
Let Europe recollect what must be done with bourgeois Lies
Peace
Wealth
Growth
Progress <start> Proud and free that's American to me
Symptomatically and so basically
It's so definite freedom is all of it
No humanity whithout restraint
Refuse to be denied refuse to compromise
Your ideology always a lie
It's jingoistic or nationalistic
Or whatever the hell you want to call it
With my raised fist
Never be denied
I stand and resist again
Proud and free that's a human thing to me
Burning at the core and I'd go to war
Ain't gonna change my way of life
Twisted rhetoric I won't subscribe
Refuse to be denied refuse to compromise
Your ideology always a lie
Imperialistic colonialistic
Bandwagon patriot wake up to this
With my raised fist
Never be denied
I stand and resist again <start> No no no Momma
All my life I loved this girl so much
All my life I loved her simple touch.
She cared for me and put me on this earth
Oh the pain of just a simple birth.
But now I find that she has left me dumb and blind
Poisoned twisted and destroyed my mind.
She taught me things that simply were not true
She taught me hate for race
That's why I hate you
There's only one way I can make it right
Momma's gotta die tonight.
There's only one way I can make it right
Momma's gotta die tonight.
Momma momma I always loved my momma
I always loved my momma.
I loved the way she hold me
I love the way she talked to me.
She used to teach me a lot of things
She taught me good things she taught me bad things.
Don't trust white people don't trust white people.
Don't trust white people they're no good they're no good
They're no good they're no good.
They're just gonna rip you off they're just gonna rip you off.
Don't trust 'em don't trust 'em.
I said Why momma she said I told you don't
Trust 'em they're no good.
I said Momma I thought we were all the same momma
Why momma She said Don't ask me any questions.
Don't you challenge your mutha. Momma.
So one day I found I fell in love
And I brought my girlfriend home
And I introduced her to my mutha and
She smacked me was a white girl and
I said Why momma Why momma What did I do wrong
You know I found out my mutha was a evil woman.
She hated Puerto Ricans Mexicans Jamaicans
Indians Orientals momma was no good.
I learned to hate my mutha hate my mutha.
So I got some ha ha some lighter fluid from the corner store
And I put it around her bed and I set her on fire
Ha ha ha.
Burn momma burn momma burn momma burn bitch
Burn burn burrrrrn. Ha ha ha. Burn you racist bitch
Ha ha ha.
But she wasn't quite dead. She jumped up from the bed
And I grabbed my Louisville Slugger that she had bought
Me for my twelfth birthday and I came up behind her and
I hit her I hit her I hit her twice. Ha ha ha.
Now she was out.
I went into the kitchen
And I got that handy carving knife
That we only use on special occasions like
Bullshit Thanksgiving and I took her and I laid her ol'
Fucked up corpse on the floor and I cut her in
Little bitty pieces. Cut off her arms her feet
Her neck and I put her into little green hefty bags
And I put it into my car and I said Momma we're goin' on
A vacation a permanent vacation bitch.
I took some of her around the world to Arizona New York
Chicago Atlanta Miami Oakland. Ha ha ha yo you
Want to go to Connecticut bitch. Ohio Detroit Texas L.A.
Whose laughin' now momma whose laughin' now bitch
Whose laughin' now.
Ha ha ha ha.
So if you got a mutha or a grandmutha or a father
Who wants to carry on the same racist bullshit that's
Fucked this world up from day one
You can either look 'em in the face and tell 'em to
Suck your dick or do like Body Count does.
All my life I loved this girl so much
All my life I loved her simple touch.
She cared for me and put me on this earth
Oh the pain of just a simple birth.
Right now I find that she has left me dumb and blind
Poisoned twisted and destroyed my mind.
She taught me things that simply were not true
She taught me hate for race
That's why I hate you
There's only one way I can make it right
Momma's gotta die tonight.
There's only one way I can make it right
Momma's gotta die tonight. <start> A garden of seeds lost ashen spirits embrace me in pain
Like scars that shed the plague of flames my thirst awakes
Aceless to my feelings inimicial to my pulse like disease
Sand in my eyes I am hiding from pleasure yearning for breeze
Draw my bare tears from this melody now that I can't flee
Take refuge in me or vanish my beauty bring or tear the silk
To weave the drops of passion or strike the winds of misfortune
Mourning I stand my senses in abyss under skies of torture
Devour my womb these obscure roots
Release my dying touch unchain me from my doom
I an crawling to feel desire
To shape your truth and fire
Crawling towards you with the limbs of a stare
To dream a leaf without it's tree to follow it's silence
I hear no sense but a scream of lips and sighs in vastness
A thirteenth shadow in my nightmare you become
And it's you in every rain in every ballet and sun
Within my nest I bleed the coming of eves hollow heart
Slave to this blessed state which sends my dreams afar
Bear witness to my memories of flesh that will never rise
The dice of desperation reveals a black rose lays on my mind
Devour my womb these obscure roots
Release my dying touch unchain me from my doom
I am prowling to feel desire
To yield to bounds and pyres

My lips are cracked from the heat

Ever been forced into a vasectomy by and ax wielding homovore

To shred your testes and sever adjacent vesicles
Cold vengeance on a rapist immediate testicular shapeshift
Your manhood disintegrates and the stream starts to flood
A shimmering mix of spermatozoa and blood
Another human off the face of the earth
A new vagina to replace its absence of girth
It rubs the feces on its skin or else it gets the hammer again
Torture through blunt castration slaughter repeated testicular emaciation
For your gross misconduct the tables are rightfully turned
The urethra now a bile duct the frayed ends of karma are burned
A gaping gash of reproduction seminal waste of testosterone
That ceases to function
Asexual freak no longer of the male persuasion
Your miserable heap of disfigurementation

The war between the Imperium and the allied Vyrgothian Kingdoms had raged
for years. Beginning as minor disputes over border territories the conflict
had swiftly escalated into a fullscale bloody war a vast series of epic
campaigns fervently perpetua ted by the Emperor Koord and the OverKing of
Vyrgothia both eager to smite their traditional ancestral foes and to win
great glory and the adulation of their people by seizing victory in battle.
Recent months had seen the forces of the Imperium display a staggering degree
of tactical mastery and battle prowess contemptuously crushing the Vyrgothian
armies in a series of great battles 'til at last following the slaughterous
Rout of the Fields of KaiVorg The Empire's finest fighting force the fame
d and farfeared Legion of the Ebon Tiger stood unopposed not five day's
march from mighty GulKothoth the greatest and most ancient fortresscity in
all the Vyrgothian kingdoms. The Legion of the Ebon Tiger could not easily
count their numerous and r esounding victories and their commander the
legendary warlord Baalthus Vane made it clear to the Emperor that he was
eager to press on deep into the enemy's lands and seize the prize which
awaited him the siege and capture of ancient GulKothoth And yet the Emperor
Koord did not order the Legion to march for disturbing information had of
late been relayed to him by his spies in the Vyrgothian Royal Court... Dire
rumours abounded that the Vyrgothian mages had at last discovered the ancient
arcane r ites which would unlock the aeonsfettered power of the dread
Obsidian Crown a fearsome mystical artefact countless thousands of years old
a blackjewelled circlet believed once to have been borne upon the immortal
brow of the legendary ShadowKing him self And it was written in legend
that should the ancient spells of might entwining the artefact be reawakened
then incredible near limitless ruinous power would thus be bestowed upon any
army carrying the Crown into battle... Had the mages of Vyrgoth ia truly
ascertained the timelost conjurations required to empower the Obsidian Crown
hidden for centuries deep within the marble vaults of its ebon citadel Eager
to know the truth the Emperor dispatched his most powerful sorcerer across
the great In land Sea to the Court of the OverKing under the pretence of
offering the terms for the Vyrgothian surrender. He was bade use all his
sorcerous skills to discover the truth... a truth soon made clear by the
disdainful refusal of the Imperium's terms an d the grimly fearsome message
given the sorcerer by Vyrgothia's Master Wizard with which to return to the
Emperor And lo when the Imperium marches against GulKothoth then dark
sorceries shall enshroud the Citadel of the Obsidian Crown...
The Wizards of Vyrgothia
Darkly bejewelled circlet of night
Crown of the Elder King
Unfettered at last the Trinity of Might
The sceptre the sword and the ring.
The Sorcerer
I stand upon the oaken planks of this great ship 
Gazing at moongleam dancing on the vast dark sea...
 black crystals gleaming... ensorcellment
I am enthralled by this nighted spell...
For I know that the slumbering sorceries
Of the ShadowKing's crown shall soon be reawakened...
And as I return to my emperor 
My spirit is borne upon the leathern wings of a great sorrow...
Chapter  The March of the Imperium
The Emperor
Call forth the OgreMage of the Black Lake
And the Swordmaster of Kyrman'ku
Let them speak the Words Which Unfetter...
Enshrined for countless centuries within its darksome citadel
Five score and ten against the Tiger  the black crown of the
ShadowKing
By all the dark gods I swear I'll not be dethroned
A seething forest of blackened blades
A churning sea of ebon warchariots
A searing storm of flaming shafts
All this havoc and more shall I unleash against my foe...
Into battle The Legion shall march... the fall of GulKothoth is nigh
The Legion of the Ebon Tiger... six thousand elite warriors of the
Imperium the pride of the Emperor's forces... Bolstered by heavy cavalry and
a squadron of deadly scythed chariots... further reinforced by the Imperial
Frontier Army of one hundred tho usand highly trained spearmen and archers...
and never has this force met its match in battle or siege...
Baalthus Vane
Our banner flies ever glorious undefeated we stand steeped in victory.
The Iron Phalanx six thousand strong our everhoned blades the Tiger's
gleaming claws.
Pride of the Empire Scourge of the Vraii
Masters at Turonium and KaiVorg.
Smiters of the Southern Host Routers of the Horde Bane of the OverKing we
march to war
And so the Emperor himself rides to rendezvous with Baalthus Vane
accompanied by his sorcerous aide. The Legion of the Ebon Tiger reaches
GulKothoth at dusk on the fifth day of their march from the fields of
KaiVorg halting upon the great arid plan which stretches before the city
the huge dust cloud sent up by their massed arrival obscuring the dying embers
of the setting sun. As the vast army begins to make camp arraying their
splendid tents and banners and assembling their gargantuan siegewag ons
the Emperor stands gazing at the huge brooding walls and colossal cyclopean
gates of the cityfortress before him vowing that a torrent of red slaughter
shall befall GulKothoth regardless of any sorcerous trinkets the Vyrgothians
may possess and that the OverKing shall pay dearly for his sublime
arrogance. And twelve leagues distant an army of five score and ten bearing
the Obsidian Crown approaches the city...

I whispered my wish to a breeze from the North
The wind took the wish high to the stars
Told them what I've missed with all my heart
I was mesmerized by the rolling tide
I lay on that shore and gazed into the skies
Like a shooting star my dream was gone
I made up my mind
I don't want to wake up
When will time heal and fulfil the dream of my heart
When will we unite as one and light our own star
All these memories I will treasure in my heart

Another dead night is waiting to come alive
You are already trying to find
One more way to hide from the burning light
You don't want to see
You don't want to feel
Nothing but your hopeless destiny
You can always cry but never complain
All those bitter tears will it ease the pain
 Part of the crying game will it ease the pain
When everything should be fine
I still found you depressed and crying all the time
It seems to me that you want to feel like you're dying
Kiss the darkness and turn you back to the light <start> Once upon the slab

With a curdling stench as its bowels starts to vent

Searching for a closure
Poisoned tentacles from the past
Are tumbling fumbling closet
Mood set
On full scale regret
Peaking an all time low
Distorted pattersn no sight with this lantern
But a bleak recollection of something undone
A banished vanished presence
Of the unspeakable secretive kind
The uttermost shame is its essence
The septic transforms the shellshocked and blind
A nightmare released a terrible disease
Lurking behind a thin wall of sleep
The jailbars of a stigmatized keep
Across the crumbling layers
A tricky haze of control
Beyond matter the untouchable scatter
The cracks are beginning to show
Small gaps out of time with riddles entwined
Looking over my shoulder for some kind of cover
All I can find to bring peace of mind
Is that this bloodstained route
Will carry the strangest of fruits
Not to turn away tainted
But look into the deep and weep
Hibernation sickness complete <start> is this worth the lives
is this worth the pain
this is not the life
this is what you've become
driven to the point
your desire is blood
unmatched by any man
the loyalty to you is steadfast
solid as stone
garnished by your words that are false as apparitions
this flesh that you once considered so dear
is proof of my ultimely demise
and you still want more
innocent blood shed
nothing to lose
as your sons
have fallen now
you spit untruths
as you wait
for your judgement day
for all the tears that have yet to dry
for all the years that you've destroyed all of our lives <start> I'm a new messiah
Won't you cry a tear for me
I absorb your sleepless nights
I'm a black horizon I'm solitude in chains
Always in your way 'cause this is my land
Won't you join my lamentation
Take your time remember
I am just a breath away
Look into my eyes they're hollow
But I see the rising flow
Only pain can cure my sorrow
Nothing compares to the dreams that I know
Can you hear me under the mourning star
All I dream of all the thoughts I must expel
Who would who could
Who dares who cares
Who would trade his soul for my monocracy
A silver line for me to climb out of the shades
To find tomorrow the pain your master claims
I live it every day so you are my land
Look into my eyes they're hollow
Who's behind they never show
I have waited long my fellow
Nothing compares to the hopes that I've grown
Can you hear me under the mourning star
All I dream of all the thoughts I must expel
Who would who could
Who dares who cares
Your conception will remain
Dogmas in the breeze
Enclosed by any pain <start> Music Wiklund
Lyrics Schulman
And when the moon
has turned to black
Darkened clouds beneath
the astral stars
As the winds fly through
with wings so dark
A deep storming sea
with griefull past
I touch the grief feel the pain
Taste the sorrow before the dawn
The seagull fly in circles
over an open sea
A morning again has risen
with silver tears
At the shore of a dreadful baltic
I touch the stones as the water
echoes your name
Here I stand all alone
Themendous pain freeze inside
The sun sets slowly
cold and silent
One day we will be united as one
I cry until dawn
My mind disappears into the dark
In a void where candles burn
Sleep forever dream those dreams <start> When I see the rage is building
And I know theres nothing stopping
Stopping me from changing into
What it is almost pure
When Im doing what Im doing
I always take it all so I
Continue in this fashion
And continue to be free
Mother never told me to
Respect those that you do not like
Why should I be forced to hurt
And take the fucking blame
Why are you ignoring me
Where will I get morals from
Mother never taught me
And I dont know why
Destroy the one that you love
Crush all memory of them
Appreciate the power that you have and that you wield
Its a game of life play to learn
Push in down deep inside
Time to create more than you could
Ever want
Only when the world has stopped
Could you be the only one
Another day another time
That Ive never known
When I see humanity
Taking all of the life from me
I wonder why we bother at all
Unlock the door
Pray its finally over
Game on
Settle down
Powerless to stop
Freedom is the one you seek
Tell me why I you must be free
Listen to this fuckin crap
This is what you want to be
Tell me what you really mean
Freedom is the only way to start again
I swear there no reality
Youve taken more then you deserve
But no one is impervious
When I see the rage is building
And I know theres nothing stopping
Stopping me from changing into
What it is almost pure
When Im doing what Im doing
I always take it all so I
Continue in this fashion
And continue to be free
Mother never told me to
Respect those that you do not like
Why should I be forced to hurt
And take the fucking blame
The world of beauty and of order is disappearing before me
Ive taken lives
In your next life
Eye for an eye
Just like Judas
Eye for an eye
Im surrounded
Burn all the dead
Its what is deep inside
Worship the system
That youre following
Fuck your religion
You follow like sheep
I see the way forward
You see nothing
Time to say fuck it
Im my own man
Destroy the one that you love
Crush all memory of them
Appreciate the power that you have and that you wield
Its a game of life play to learn
Push in down deep inside
Time to create more than you could
Ever want
Only when the world has stopped
Could you be the only one
Another day another time
That Ive never known
When I see humanity
Taking all of the life from me
Fuck this stupid shitty world <start> She is at the end chasing her own fading light
Running from her shadow in the name of living
Searched for worth in the lust of men
Paid in blood in different beds
Mistaking sex for true love
They never meant a thing
Her addiction brought her a world
Of coward boys and of cheater girls
Looking for an easy way out of being ordinary
So she boarded their sinking ship
And crossed their red needle sea
Drowning truth to live her lie
That she was ordinary
In her fading shadow <start> I can still feel you there
Are we tangled in time somewhere
And it's been a while since you've been round here
Since you locked me in some devastated stare
Oh then we could ring out like mission bells
Across the yard we knew so well
Come on come on give me my turn
To sing once more
And let it burn
Cause Im
Im just no good
So leave me as you should
And surrender to some unholy war
Cause we forgot what we first came here for
Oh then we could ring out like mission bells
Across the yard we knew so well
Come on come on give me my turn
To sing once more
And let it burn
Come on come on come on now you sing it
Laying me low in bells that come ringing and
We could ring out like mission bells
Across the yard we knew so well
Come on come on give me my turn
To sing once more
And let it burn <start> Headstones overturned and smashed
Your fucking corpse I want to thrash
The cold hard ground I hack and slash
Coffins torns apart like trash
Six feet closer to your doom
From this grave I will exhume
Horrid flesh my blade consumes
As I destroy your earthen tomb
Vacant Grave
To remove my rotting prize
From the soil the box will rise
Disembalm the cadaverized
Defile the dead I so despise
The pickaxe now unburied
Slaughter in the cemetery
From the site the corpse is carried
The ink still wet on the obituary
Vacant Grave
Your hands and feet I masticate
The body I incinerate
A shovel used to decapitate
The corpses head I obliterate
Only pieces they will find
Of the carnage so unkind
Twisted fragments of your spine
At the hole I left behind
Vacant Grave <start> Whatever happened to the integrity found within a family
I return your glare
And my bones are chilled with some sort of
Sickening recipe of fear and anger.
Day by day time after time again
You distort chronology you foster of terror
Bury your diamonds destroy your rubies
We are searching for security in tradegy
Look around and notice the black  drowning  simplicity
We are the constant decay
Each note will disintegrate
Perched upon our towers motionless and miserable
Here's to a comfortable casket
How deceiving is the cemetery of motivation
I wish to write a conclusion <start> This world keeps pushing down upon me
And I keep hoping for a sweet dream
There's something left for me to see
There's something left for me to be
We can't ponder on this world forever
You know we can save it if together
Growing day by day to make it
But my time's been wasted
And while my eyes are open wide
I'm sound asleep on the inside
Wake me up from this dream that never ends
Haunting me haunting me till my bitter end
Wake me up from this nightmare that I live
Something inside of me keeps on giving in
Well I keep searching for an answer
But time will never tell
And you will never know
My choices are my own
But I can't choose where I call home
This life isn't carved in stone
This life has left me on my own
And while my eyes are open wide
I'm sound asleep on the inside
Wake me up from this dream that never ends
Haunting me haunting me till my bitter end
Wake me up from this nightmare that I live
Something inside of me keeps on giving in
WAKE ME UP
I'm wide awake
I'm not afraid anymore
I'm wide awake
It's you who helped me win this war
Wake me up from this dream that never ends
Haunting me haunting me till my bitter end
Wake me up from this nightmare that I live
Something inside of me keeps on giving in
Wake me up from this dream that never ends
Haunting me haunting me till my bitter end
Wake me up from this nightmare that I live
Something inside of me keeps on giving in <start> PRECHORUS
Even if the sun refused to shine
Even if we lived in different time
Even if the ocean left the sea
There would still be you and me
Ever since the start of time
You've had my love
Even before I knew your name
I knew your heart
In the dark of the darkest night
I could see your face
I always knew from the very start
I would find a way
CHORUS
Even if the sun refused to shine
Even if we lived in different time
Even if the ocean left the sea
There would still be you and me
Even if the world would disappear
Even if the clouds would shed no tears
Even if tonight was just a dream
There would still be you and me
You've always been and you always will be
The only one
Until forever
The only girl
Until forever
I'll ever love
In the cold of winter's chill
I'll be there to warm your heart
Giving you all of me
For all time
No matter what
CHORUS
Two hearts that belong together
Together
From the very start
One love
Now and forever
Now and forever
Nothing can tear up apart
CHORUS
CHORUS <start> I unearth the decomposing corpse Splintering the musty casket Seething with
excitement I lay bare the dusty tomb... The pungent aroma of putrescence
Penetrates my nasal passage Revealing the naked body To play host to my
morbid whims... An expeditious dissection of the degenerate anatomy Will
hasten the deconstruction of the thoracic cavity Caseated viscera abdominal
enema The cadaveric paste inspires a moment of levity... I sip the succulent
succus I nibble the nauseating noma Gorging myself on the gore An
appetance to truly abhor... Sodomized by an ingot Shifting through the shit
clots Pelvic fractuing is wrought... The image of the grumous vagina An
amorous sight that makes my erection grow thick Penetrating the dried meatus
The crepitated cunt collapses on my dick... <start> You told me nine times before and you said that her touch was not love all these years. You said that she stole and lied and you said to be brave like me. And I couldn't believe when you said outlive but I must come out and face the unwilling terms. These eyes they are old and can only focus on the son that I was the wrong that I was. I tried to gape the teeth just so the water could fill my lungs. And all this time I thought I was drowning and all this time she made me and you caged me and beat me. These shackles reek of your cologne and manipulative phrases. She is dying and I wish Hell upon you one thousand times a day. I have her graft inside of me she sewed this body and made these eyes. She put them in my head and gave me life. You gave me hate greed confusion and a shimmering blurred backhand of your affection. She is dying and I have come to realize this. He is breathing but should have stopped a long time ago. I know his heart quit but I have no reason for him to give anything. And she is dying and I have missed her life. She gave everything to me I have so much conscience tied to my neck. I want to swim atop of this sea and give her all the love which has so diligently fallen under lock and key. it was so uneven and the anchor that I have woven is weighing and pulling me down to the bottom of this ocean. And I wish I could spread my wings far enough to stop this fall from grace but there is nothing I can do. <start> I've been a victim to the blade against myself
Bloodletting all of my soul
Suck in paralyzed in this vortex
Reduced to silence
In the dark I've lingered too long
This sharpened axe beam of light
I reach for and I master
Wield against these shadows
It's purpose now revealed in silence
Keep searching question if this light ends
Now I will strike and dig with precision
Introspective eye erase the concept
I lost my fears and the notion of time
I healed my sorrow
All boundaries are illusion
When you reach the center light
And reinforce the striking power
By chance you're followed
It's purpose now revealed in silence
Keep searching question if this light ends
All ghosts dwelling in inside in the heart
I see them all release their shadow <start> All my hopes and all of my dreams
Everything falling in between
Seems to me that the memories

Mean more to you than they do to me
Through the sky and into your eyes
And I see everything falling in between
Sew the lips right into your smile
I'm okay with faking this
I'll fake everything just to slip your kiss
If I'm a writer and I'm a poet I might love you
But never show it
You should forget me this is a long tour
And I'll be back but not in time for
If all we speak is rational thought
Everyday I pray for the sadness

Eyes are black my throat full of sickness
And I'll be listening but not for long
Everyday I pray for the sadness

Eyes are black my throat full of sickness
The words I write are cheap and trite
But they're drawn on the back of your door
Surrounded by numbers that
Remind of the ones before
All my hopes and all of my dreams
Everything falling in between
Seems to me that the memories

Mean more to you than they do to me
Through the sky and into your eyes
And I see everything falling in between
Sew the lips right into your smile
I'm okay with faking this
I'll fake everything just to slip your kiss
The words I write are cheap and trite
But they're drawn on the back of your door
Surrounded by numbers that
Remind of the ones before
The words I write are cheap and trite
But they're drawn on the back of your door
Surrounded by numbers that
Remind of the ones before
My lips are cold
The truth is told <start> Yes here is what you came for
I know what I'm here for
Knocked out right to the floor
Committed to kill
Kill what you don't know
Can't trust let it go
Say what you mean
Don't ask what's the story
You'll be knocked out right to the floor.
Committed to kill
Kill what you don't know

The God damned hypocrisy
My story's in yours
Throw at me what you got
'Cause I will break free from all the words that bind me
My story is in yours

'Cause I will break free from all the words that bind me
I fear to be tied
My consciousness dead to rights
Fuck suicide
Living along side you yeah
So get what you came for
Locked up on the floor
Get straight at the door
Get yourself more inventive
Say what you mean
Don't ask what's the story
You'll be knocked out right to the floor.

Yeah
You know it could be God damn true
I got you dead to rights
I got you dead to rights

I got you dead to rights
I got you dead to rights <start> Instrumental <start> In a lost dark world beyond eternity
Where phantasm has its origin
Where the shadows hunt the light
And no god enforces might
Lies the sin the painful sin.
From the clouds above my eyes
Drop the tears that lead the way
To the entry of the hidden
Wither knowledge takes my brain...
Lead me to the kingdom of depths
Where silence is a form of life
The day of decision recalls my thoughts
And prepares my mind to die.
Rising spirit baptises winds of
Foreign existence black times' cry
Hills as a fragment of ancient breath and
As signs for the place where the ruins may hide.
In the centre of forbidden
Thoughts we meet and will defy
And the shadows will appear and
Their eyes will stand the fear
In the unknown reigns of darkened unknown lives...
Lead me to the kingdom of depths
Where silence is a form of life
The day of decision recalls my thoughts
And prepares my mind to die.
The horror lives... below the holy fatherlands. <start> Ego Painted Grey Lyrics I feel the pain but I'm afraid to cry
All the time desperate hiding tears
My life is boring and I count the days
On and on woe is here to stay
Only if God would show a sign for me
Oh... Only if God could hold my begging hands
This endless torture's building up my rage
Holding on hide my agony
I'm getting weary just to be alive
All I want is help
So you dove into the dark beyond yourself
Lost your way to find the surface once again
Insomnia will kill all your solemn nights... Oh
Haunting your despair
Sorrow made your life a living hell
Lights are fading
Caught inside the blackholed innerself
Ego painted grey...
Insomnia will hold pleasures in a shell
And your defiant stare
Sorrow made your life a living hell
Lights are fading
Caught inside the blackholed innerself
Ego painted grey... <start> Who the fuck are you
Who the fuck do you think you are
You betrayed me this whole fucking time
I'm the baddest motherfucker in the building
So remember when it's time for me to get my revenge
I will find your fucking bitch
And fuck her right in front of you
Some people think that they can get away with murder
But everybody here can see the blood right on their hands
It's a crazy fucking world and there's no one left to trust
As people we have voices leave the traitors in the dust
Revenge is something lethal and the taste is bittersweet
Their punishment awaits we'll sweep their bitches off their feet
Its ironic when she screams my name and begs for more
It's really sick I'll hand it to you shes a
Crazy bitch
I like the way she rides this dick
I didn't think I'd have to warn you
You let it go too far again
I thought you knew that I was crazy
I let my actions speak loud
Tie her to the bed and let a minute get ahead
So I can get a better look and let her settle in the thought of it
And of course she really wants it I can see her dripping wet and
Salivating at the though of it
Tie her to the bed and let a minute get ahead
So I can get a better look and let her settle in the thought of it
And of course she really wants it I can see her dripping wet and
Salivating at the thought of it
So let me speak answer me
Who the fuck are you
You walk around with your nose up in the air
But you can't smell the shit that comes out of your mouth
You're a liar you're a bitch and you're a fake
Who the fuck do you think you are
I've spent my precious time dealing with your problems
And payback is a bitch
What goes around comes around my friend
And you will soon realize it <start> I need to die.
All sensation has dulled in this life
Low standards sick delights
Stale feces on my knife
Now accustomed to scat
Rich in taste and low in fat
Daily regiment of fiber
The longer the strands as anus clenches tighter
I've gone insane
I cannot be reasoned with
Human feces i season with
Morning eye crust and navel lint
Bleeding submucosa
Serosa breaks free from intestinal wall
To arrive on my plate
Or to lubricate when i anally mate
Ingestion  taking of food in the mouth
Masticate  mixing and churning aids in digestion
Absorption  passage of nitrients into the blood and lymph
Defecation  finally something I'll eat
Salivate intake  digest dilate  defecate ingest again
In all my studies of physiological psychology
One thing is apparent  no thought is unnatural
Such as eating feces or killing yourself or someone else
Love will always hurt fortunately mine comes in squirts
Anus to anus  I've affixed a pipe between us
A tjoint complete with hose to a mask covering mouth and nose
To master the monroe transfer
No amateur  I've covered all parameters
Of goddamned anthropophagic copromania
A taste for bacteria
And undigested epithelia
Hepatitis delight
Coprophelic demise
Copromantik. Anthropophagic. Coprpheliac. Pathomaniac. <start> To a strange land land of Pohjola
I took my gift I received it from the gods
I melted the knowledge of heaven
From the pieces of my heart I built a golden mill
I made the heavens I delivered them
I gave the horn of plenty released them
My king sold me to the northland queen
I forged and gave her a godlike machine
It wasnt enough for the queen of liars
To the river of death I also was sent
I was sent
The field of death I furrowed
I turned the soil black with steaming viper blood
In a forest deep underground
I hunted a wolf and a bear from the shadow
I was offered death as prize for my great deeds
False words from the tongue of the northland queen
A heart turned unto me
She whispered the knowledge of gods
And gave the missing words of wisdom
To me a creator of heavens
A heart turned unto me <start> Altered States of America in water cooler
Warfare with an unseen enemy
Heat flashes on the job it's back to the water cooler
Drinking more and more at home tripping balls
Behind the wheel of a sixteen car pile up <start> Feel my hands
Touch my pale face
My touch is vulnerable like a dust
It brings you lust
He came on wings of the wind
His vision in mortal mistress dream
He returned from the Shadow's Land
He was waiting for his bride
She was floating on the ware of delight
In his eyes she saw the depth of might
His kisses like wild wine
She saw candles of boundless right
Hold me tight
The sun is falling away
This fear every night
Every night I die
You can feel the body's heat
You don't know what it is
The frost of death
Hidden inside my vains
Hold me tight
Stop the time
Fly before it's not too late
I will be waiting till the End
When the clock struck midnight hour
They were dancing with desire
Those cursed words he said
His whispers Keep the faith
In vain it was too late
She forgot the love they've made
Fallen angel dying with teh starry night
Mystic preparation to eternal sleep
written by P.Maslanka <start> Tonight we take the stage again
To shock you and capture your holes.
The victims before us words can't describe
The kind you seize only in your dreams.
Her striking glance tells the story
The lust in her mind is plain to see.
She knows that I know what she's thinking.
Thinking of poisoning me...
Poison me  snakes that bite  poison me
The time for gashing has come now
The reptile slithers to me.
Just one more persuasion
Her cold blood boils from the heat.
Penetration injection is painless
Forkedtongue flicking about.
A constrictor in the form of a woman
With such a grip... I barely got out
I'll poison you with my venom
Come to me Viper... and see. <start> I bare my scars with pride
My bone are cold right thru
The cuts are so deep
I'm on top of the world
I feel great 'bout my scars
Old habits hard to break
The wound is to be
The cuts are so deep
I feel fineOK
the wound is the key
Scars are marks
Scars are art
Salvation's kickin' in
Hellucination breaking free <start> Hit the North
My Cat says eeeeeack

Computers infest the hotels
Cops can't catch criminals
But what the heck they're not too bad they talk to God
Religioussssss
Hit the North
Manacled to the city manacled to the city
All estate agents alive yell down nights in hysterical breath
Those Northern lights... so pretty
Those big big big wide streets
Those useless MPs
Savages...
Hit the North 
From the back third eye psyche the reflected mirror of delirium
Eastender and Victoria's lager the induced call mysterious
comes
forth  Hit the North

Hit the North <start> Take away the wine
For restlessness plagues me
I am assailed by a spectre profounder
Than hatred and grief or the sum of their hideous crime
I shalt suffer this confessional mime
Awaiting the sun to set crimsoning seas
Only once it is dark doth my misery cease
She died to a sky dressed in flame
Eyes full of curses for her killers by choice
Who fell to their god o'er her vision and voice
I am as dusk come to ravish the light
Steal me from their stares and mute Christ into night
I will answer thy prayers
If thou Wouldst drink of my life
Encroaching evening skies
Die with such tragedy
And those interred in cold graves
Dwell on pleasures to be
In deep hysteria
Where our legend still breathes
Through sweet death and thereafter
Sweeping nightmares shalt feed <start> Lyrics by Frode Glesnes
Music by Gerhard Storesund
In a silvershield of frost
Her realm proudly shimmers
Icy wastes and massive mist
Embraced by winds of death
Over the frosty mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
The seeds were sawn at the dawn of time
More fierce than the dragons fire
Daugther of deaths descendant
In hollow halls beneath the world
Forever kept unlit
Suffer a ceaseless cold
Pain and hunger in her dreary home
Since ages gone for times to come
HORROR  Come horror and soon the awakening
ETERNAL  Come eternity become forever
DARKNESS  Come darkness craving apocalypse
SERENITY  Forget serenity chaos supreme
Eternal darkness forever night
Shimmering flicker of candle light
Deep down dreary the Hel halls holds
The sepulchral essence of death
Anger and hate are ever awake
Creator of death created me
Wolf and serpent preeminently
Hel stands ready to fall upon them
And seize them as her own
Falling deeper into the abyss
In which she dragged them down
As sure as water lost falls back as rain
The queen of Hel will rise again
And with her the eternally damned
HORROR  Come Horror and soon the awakening
ETERNAL  Come eternity become forever
DARKNESS  Come Darkness craving apocalypse
SERENITY FORGET SERENITY CHAOS SUPREME <start> Mucha mucha polica por las calles todo el da
Buscando delincuentes que no estn entre la gente

Tipos tristes de traje gris por las calles de Madrid
Trabajando como hormigas para irse a las Malvinas

Is the way that you show lending a helping hand
For to find those I've searched for
Since I think in another way.
Fellows where have you gone
Yearning has seized my soul.
Is the way that I took banned by a solid curse
You whose motions are mine do not appear to me.
You are meant to stay vague like it is meant for me.
You'll stay inside my heart's walls
Facing stupidness as forlornes <start> Sombras negras sobre la ciudad
En tu cama aburrido estas
El viento canta suena una cancin

Rocker <start> A mission from hell was sent out today
To search and destroy and blow them all away
Forbidding is the planet
No one will return
Their lives are expendable
Through the battle turn
A victory must be won
All is at stake
As the planet burns there is no escape
As the clouds broke through
The blazing sky up above
The aura of the moment
Invasion from above
The conflict still lay up ahead
Where cowards fear to tread
Shocking was the value
Abandoned by aversion
Deployed were the robots
Creating a man machine <start> Before arrival the shores of Europa were seen
I tested that land saw things I could not believe
Devastation and gloom the humans ground into the soils
Children stacked in piles bodies used for coal
Although in chaos a government had control
A Germanic old world army allied with the south
The eastern plane was still a threat
War continued periodically with weekly air raids
Fully aware of my calling for death
I left that place and made well south
The deserts here were full of the sounds
Of nothing short of the planet's final breath 
 years ago  huge pyramids were created
In the resemblance of the hunter's constellation
...A constallation which consists of  suns
Two more structures must be built
To complete the portal
Left by the dying unearthly race
This task is not possible without the
Culmination of many hands
Slaves are an option I would employ
If the power was at my disposal
Fucking mad
I must be a fool for coming this far
On hope alone my voyage was for nothing
My hate radiated viciously
But it is never alone... I feel someone else's near
After a fit of hopeless rage I track the scent
Hate of this kind is rare in a man
I'm closer now a figure is before me
Astonishingly it is but a boy of ten
Tell me son what is thy name
Ouodo
My throat tightened from this just reward
A bond had been created from the dust of the world
The plan can now be embarked on
Carried out and finalized
This child has a gift that I can't quite control
And it would be useful when properly handled
His ability was manipulation of telekinetic properties
As time can mend time will destroy
Indecipherable words carved by hands dissimilar to mine
But the calling was made and it's purpose will serve
The end of all mankind is the word
Formulae determine water demands
As Ouodo grows his efficiency shines
The pressures fall and hydrogen ox paves the way
Stones of this size can be simple to move as the topography dictates the easiest route
 year pass and the pyramid south is completed
The sign will live on
It is known that heaven on earth as it was intended
Will not transpire without the actual destruction of it
The final structure must be built to complete the portal
Left by the dying unearthly race
This task now possible without
A many handed culmination
The solution is worth the inadvertent
Atmospheric disturbances <start>  <start> She adore she adore
When you walk
Through the door
Vule vu vule vu
I want to be with you
See'est la vie
See'est la vie
You were made for me
Ah ah ah ah
The time has come and
This is the night
I'm gonna make my move
Get everything right
I'm gonna drive the sweet
Of you an champagne on ice
I'll be your sugar and spice
And everything nice
I may not be
What you had in mind
But if I get my act together
It's just a matter time
I'm gonna tap
On your shoulder
I'm from a long time
To hold ya
Showin' you that
You need a lover
Who can be
So smooth never met
So fine that
I'll drive you crazy
That way I'll make
You my baby
Dang girl excuse my French
I can't believe how good
You look to me
Dang girl excuse my French
I can't believe how good
You look to me
Well here we are
Movin' to the beat
I feel like a foolish dancer
With two left feet
I seem to fall flat on my face
'Cause when it comes to love
I feel so out of place
I'm try to be
The man of your dreams
But every time I look at you
I get off from the seat and fall
I'm gonna tap on your shoulder
I'm from a long time to hold ya
Showin' you that you need a lover
Who can be so smooth never met
So fine that
I'll drive you crazy
That way I'll make
You my baby
Dang girl excuse my French
I can't believe
How good you look to me
Dang girl excuse my French
I can't believe
How good you look to me
Don't be afraid of me
I'm just up and
Tangled in your aura
Girl shinin' for your love
She adore she adore
When you walk
Through the door
Vule vu vule vu
I want to be with you
See'est la vie
See'est la vie
You were made for me
Ah ah ah ah

There's no escape and time is running out
Heaven can wait come hell or high water
Dragged into a world with voices unheard and silent screams
Forced into this hell where evil compels and shatters your dreams
Trapped in this underworld confused on how this came to be
A path you walk has lead you on a trail of misery
Unsure of your fate uncertainty waits your struggle within
No end and no beginnings
Is this the afterlife
There's no escape and time is running out
Heaven can wait come hell or high water
There's no escape and time is running out
Heaven can wait come hell or high water

Time  left as you waste or hope disappears
So  now nothing is left death is hunting the weak
Now break these chains with broken bones become the enemy
The  sight now you're  show no empathy
Unsure of you fate uncertainty waits your struggle within
No end and no beginnings
Is this the afterlife
There's no escape and time is running out
Heaven can wait come hell or high water
There's no escape and time is running out
Heaven can wait come hell or high water
I can't let you
I won't let you
Go
No end and no beginnings
Is this the afterlife
There's no escape and time is running out
Heaven can wait come hell or high water
There's no escape and time is running out
Heaven can wait come hell or high water <start> Referring to an old book
One thousand words one lie
Lost in selfadulation
Your selfregarded mind
Narrow minded visions
Spread like poison through the world
Posing as the awaited savior
The last supper prepared
Bloodstained prophecy

Bloodstained prophecy

Bloodstained prophecy

Bloodstained prophecy
A lifeless son's your idol
Your act of grace is death
Centuries of forced conversion
Word of God declined
Your tongues speak about mercy
But your prophecy is pain
Narcissism and divine benediction
Won't save you from ordeal
Bloodstained prophecy

Bloodstained prophecy

 <start> I'll try and continue this emergency broadcast as long as we can hold out here. Umm. The city is almost completely deserted now there are only a few stragglers left on the streets no emergency services. The fires continue to burn out of control. This incredible epidemic of random mass killing has spread to every country in the civilized world. Every hour more people are becoming infected  being driven to senseless acts of extreme violence. And we got reports sketchy at best of people mutating their bodies swelling and distorting. Its impossible at this time to know how many uninfected people are left.
You'll find that there is life after death  A very painful life.

You recute your dead poetry
In the name of a sacred exposure
You are living anonymously
In the name of a needed acceptance
You are selling youself as a bitch
In the name of a glorious present
You are burning your future indeed
I've got tomorrow
I live it up
I crossed the damn road
I've overcome
In the name of  addictive pestilence
You are pitting your death in the scene
In the name of a native instinct
You're unfolding yourself as a beast
In the name of a priceless rising
You're denying aggressively
What's left of the men's conscience
What's left of the men's dreams
I've got tomorrow
I live it up
I crossed the damn road
I've overcome
All dreams are in the storm

All fear ascends your soul

Unreal illusion
We're the virtual hostage ones
Once
We were
As a child
In love
And the signs
Of new times
Make us feel
In hell
All dreams are in the storm

All fear ascends your soul

Unreal illusion
We're the virtual hostage ones

We were

We're the virtual hostage ones <start> I am falling apart
I want to take you with me
A blood red sky is bleeding on me
Bleeding on me bleeding on me
I am falling apart
Why don't you fall with me
A dance macabre that I will lead
File me under rude for what I say
I'd rather burn out then fade away
Just turn your back and walk away
What feeds the urge that makes you survive
Why fear death you were never alive
One thing I just realized
You can kill yourself now you were never alive <start> I was lead to believe but now I know for sure.
When the wind's knocked out of me.
Only one thing that can be cure and bring me to my feet.
When all the words just relate.
I just hit play and when the record comes to an end. I'll listen all over again.
Truth is I'm taking a step back and taking some time to think.
I've just got to express myself with this pen and ink.
Because I've got something left to say.
This means all the world to me. These words never let me down.
This all made me who I am. This is how I became a man.
So when breath escapes and my eyes close.
Just hit play and when the record comes to an end. I'll sing all over again.
Truth is I'm taking a step back and taking some time to think.
I've just got an express myself with this pen and ink.
Because I've got something left to say.
This means all the world to me. These words never let me down.
This is my everything. Come do your worst this is my obsession.
I chose this life and I've found m own direction.
Truth is I'm taking a step back and taking some time to think.
I've just got an express myself with this pen and ink.
Because I've got something left to say.
This means all the world to me. These words never let me down.
When this record comes to an end I'll just start it all over again. <start> look at my eyes look at my skin
in which I was born in which I'm livin'
look at my soul look at my blood
they make me survive 'cause life is hard
Rise
Blood in blood
look at me look at yourself
the shame of every nation os
the world's segregation
I look at the sky I look at myself
My father's and my mother's blood
United in me
Never deny yourself
My mind is my mind only mine
my soul is my soul only mine
no enemy could take it 'cause it's mine <start> One man fights to keep his pockets fat. Another is fighting just to pay his bills. Some go to doctors for the vanity others can't even afford their pills. The distance between us grows. Just how numb have we become Look how far we've grown....apart. Some show their love for the land by stopping and asking Why Others show support for a war by sending their sons off to die. The distance between us grows. Just how numb have we become What have we become Look how far we've grown...apart. Now I won't talk to you and you won't talk to me. And I might look away but you will never see the distance betweenrace religion class education sexual orientation political affiliation. We'll never see eye to eye. this distance will keep on growing and growing and growing.... <start> Life at its best you are doing fine
But you're blind it's china you hold
As it breaks suddenly it's clear
Beautiful but transitory
But we won't break easy
We won't give in to all unbearable pain
We'll pull through we won't crack
We'll endure and survive
Oh transitory
Pain is as life itself
Evanescent as it fades
Transitory
Life all you've got all was swept away
Now you see what there is to miss
Suddenly you're stronger than you thought
As you know it's transitory
'Cause we won't break
Survival is all we've got
And our unbearable grief
We'll hold on and won't crack
And we'll value all life
Oh transitory
Pain is as life itself
Evanescent as it fades <start> Noone seems to care about.
Noone seems to ask.
Behind this face there's wasted memory.
Caught beneath a mask.
This heart will beat another day.
This heart will lead us both astray.
Believe me... this heart will be silent .
For all eternityfor us it's clear to see.
Now swallows your night .
And share this heart with me .
This heart. You punish me for selfrespect.

Racing through me burning me
Unpure I'll shine forever
Wild darkness boils in my veins so tired
Through the red
With fires of dawn burning in my eyes
Through the red
Burning me
All faces turn black
I refuse to breathe
Cleanse me <start> Scenes of old and rainy days
Voices in my head
I wish I could avoid the maze
Still I sit here and wait
Until the day she'll come
Burn the borderline
Burn all the dividing lines
To be the glow till the shrines
are placed in the dark.
Captor of the night
Will embrace the signs
Stand in front of the pyre
Burn the borderline
Walk upon my living grave.
Taste the misery
Like a sad and lonely child
Counting days full of nights

I hear footsteps down the hall. This happy home is not what it appears to be. The clock on the wall says . Where am I Can it be I'm still alive I'm sure all of this will be my fault. I can't see past this here and now. Why keep screaming if no one hears a sound So I clean my blood up with a kitchen towel. I pick myself up off of the ground. I smile pretty just like they taught. A bird in his cage and I know I'm caught. His ring around my finger waits and there's not a mark upon my face. I clean the blood up with a kitchen towel. The monster swears he's sorry now. I smile pretty just like he wants. Hope is dead yet her spirit haunts. His ring around my finger waits it's suicide but I can't e <start> Another night
Another inner fight
The demons calling
My soul is dark
But with a touch of light
The whole world's changing
I draw the line
My pleasure redefined
It's now awakening
I feel the urge
Emotions on the verge
AND NOW ITS TIME TO
KILL
KILL
KILL
KILL
The speed of light
I feel the time is right
I've smashed all boundaries
My skull is crushed
Adrenaline is rushed
THE NIGHT HAS FOUND ME
Infection spread
A spirit through my head
THE TIME IS COMING
I know the score
But I gotta have have 'em all
AND ALL MORE I COULD
KILL
KILL
KILL
KILL
I am what I choose to be
I lose grip of reality
And I have nothing to atone
All your morals formed in vein
And now my pleasure is my pain
BUT I'M GONNA MAKE IT ALL MY OWN

The sun is up
But I can't get enough
THE SKIES THE LIMIT
I'm on the top
But I ain't gonna stop
ILL NEVER GIVE IN
It's in my brain
It's driving me insane
HALLUCINATIONS
Always the same
But I ain't gonna save
DESTRUCTION I MUST
KILL
KILL
KILL
KILL
I am what I choose to be
I lose grip of reality
And I have nothing to atone
All your morals formed in vein
And now my pleasure is my pain
BUT I'M GONNA MAKE IT ALL MY OWN

I've seen the sun rise once again
I've lived my life and now I'm dead
Time to come down all on my own

This is nothing new for me
This is my reality
SO OPEN YOUR EYES
AND DON'T EVER HIDE AWAY
I am what I choose to be
I lose grip of reality
And I have nothing to atone
All your morals formed in vein
And now my pleasure is my pain
BUT I'M GONNA MAKE IT ALL MY OWN

OUT HERE ON MY OWN <start> The life you led had you in chains
Losing the touch
There's no controlling your mind
Forever grieving in your heart
The mysteries you hide contribute in losing the battle
Bridge
I see clearer when you're drowning in your words
Forced to betray you're delusional in thought
Chorus
I see the light
To guide my way through the darker shadow
Why can't you try
Give me strength to live
in colliding worlds
Reciting all the answers
Avoided the trust
Your negative views are revealing
Falling emotions now unfold
You're fading through lies
Entwined are you now
by the web that you're weaving
Bridge
Chorus
Solo
This fatalistic dream has gone
Vanished away
This image that you once created
Inspired by new beginnings
Moving through life on wings that are giving me freedom

Chorus <start> I can't believe this
Ten days have past
And still this endless rain
Keeps falling from the sky
I know I'll survive it
But this time the clouds cover the midnight sun
The beauty of my land
I know I can't cope with it anymore
I have to go I fly away
To a distant place
I take the chance and leave
Away from this pouring rain
Night's getting closer
The season of light is fading long before it even has begun
I know I'll survive it
But that is the only consolation
When we see our precious days
Turn in to pieces once again
I have to go I fly away
To a distant place
I take the chance and leave
Away from this pouring rain
I never knew that this would be
This is no place for me
My ship is caught at sea the storm comes towards me
It's not that I don't like the  snow
But I need sun to rest my soul
I never knew I'd need a shelter from the rain in the end of June
Maybe someone has cast a spell <start> Futureturns the tides
An abstract view on life
Morbid thoughts that dominate
Control your instinct to survive
Left in the dark again
Trapped behind a shadow
When will the confusion end
Left with no tomorrow
So many thoughts we cannot see
Condemn us to a life of sorrow
Leaving one to conjure ways
And try to make it through tomorrow
Left in the dark again
Trapped behind a shadow
When will the confusion end
Left with no tomorrow <start> There's a price we all pay to Charon
A price we pay for the ride
You're damned if you do damned if you don't
Nothing remains but emaciated pride
The urge for self destruction
Again drags you into the pit
Bristling with agony once more
A voice deep inside your head screams FUCK IT
Spiraling annihilation
Descent into the abyss
A boiling blackened violence and hatred
Some fucker's gonna pay for this
A victim less crime of passion
Or rape of mind and soul
Or the bastard even destroys himself
Violence and drugs to fill the aching hole
The aching hole
Consume to liberate
Pour liquid fire on the pain
Years of frustration finally went
A hate so strong it's driven me insane
Anyone could be the target
And I've got time to kill
How far salvation seems from me now
One last laugh at anyone who can feel <start> Time is so heartless
time is malice
time is the aburd absolution
time leads me to disillusion
Here I find myself
the helot of the handman
fearing the certain death
and hoping for salvation
Ever and anon  flying
Ever and anon  dying
shattered thoughts they're flowing
leaving you in the shades
What eve I'll create
what eve I will think
never I'll be meant
selfregulated punishment
A live from agony
dusteating blooddrinking crearure
sharing insanity
earth to fed up but open wide
Ever and anon  flying
Ever and anon  dying
still on the knee you're playing
but no god wanna fisten  to you
i fly a little bit I die a little bit more  ever
I fly alittle bit I die a little bit more  anon
I search for the wisdom
Left in the sand
awaiting the final solution
bringing myself to the end
Land of eloverfeats
land of desolation
land of no believes
I fly for the unflating nation
Ever and anon  flying
Ever and anon  dying
Ever and anon  fallingever and anon  erushing <start> Don't hesitate to hope
They said come close don't be afraid
Love don't seem to find it's way
To where you stay
You have to feel the light
They said it's easy to forget
Love is really far away
For a dying of today
Mother Mary
Comfort in a cross of silver
Hard to pick a Saviour
From a million Gods
'Cause when you settle
For a new dimension
You'll never find
The one your dying for
Last temptation
Touch me before you close your eyes
Die a martyr to your principles
'Cause you're the only God who's visible tonight
Once you have crossed
The course you seek
When your resistance weak
When your goal is left behind
You soon recline
Eyes of the source you're searching for
Can't see you anymore and salvation's far away
For a dying led astray
Make another mountain
Move before it's over
Try to pick a Saviour
If you know his name
But Mary's crying
On the edge of heaven
Deliberation's bad for faith
She claims
Last temptation
Touch me before you close your eyes
Die a martyr to your principles
'Cause you're the only God who's visible tonight
They all seem to be the same
So hard to decide
When a million Gods retain
All there is to find
There's another universe
Behind each blinding flare
Suddenly they'll all emerge
But none of them would care <start> Sweet child I wish you were dead
Sweet child I wish you were dead
Dry your eyes now little one
Shut up and listen hear the screams in the night
Rage of fire
Rage in the night
Dry your eyes now little one
My rage grows stronger so burn
Like a hunted child alone
Face my demons of falling desire
Rage of fire
Rage in the night
Dry your eyes now little one
The flames get higher so burn
Look up to the sky
Do you see the flaming eyes watching you
Can you feel their anger
Let the madness lead you
No compass on this earth
Shows my direction <start> It's been so long 
That I haven't seen your face
I'm trying be strong 
But the strength I have is washing away 
It won't be long 
Before I get you by my side
And just hold you tease you squeeze you
Tell you what's been on my mind

See you for the liar you are.
And if I were gone tomorrow
Then finally you would see all my scars.

Won't try to even listen to me
You keep clinging on to me
But I feel my sanity drain and
I feel the break I
Can feel the break I
You remember I will always
See you for the liar you are.

Never before was the truth
hard to follow
In your own selfdoubt you will wallow
Now it's my time
You remember I will always
See you for the liar I know you ARE
Even when I try
I cannot seem to find
One good reason why
I should believe your lies and

Can feel the break I
Can feel the break and I know what's to follow
Never before was the truth hard to swallow
In your own selfdoubt you will wallow
Now I don't have the time <start> Chorus
One dream in all of us still shining
One star the ever lasting light
So alone so lost inside to the ending paradise
United victorious the hearts of our nation tonight.
In the dark December morning light
Far strong to the burning winds the fires of Hell will forsake me
Shattering the chains that ever bind us
Suffering their pain eternally.
For strong smash the silence carry on like before
Fires burn still we battle lost so far away
Storm with hail fire raging sun shines down as they kneel
Lost in times and long forgotten governing miles away.
Tears fall inside the dream our last days gone by
Still alive we feel the pain tonight
Stars fall through blackened clouds and dreams that miss rains
A twilight star in the thousand lights for me.
Chorus
And still we save a breath for the world
Life brings up for us all
United victorious the hearts of our nation tonight.
One dream in all of us still shining
One star the ever lasting light
Chorus
And still we save a breath for the world
Life brings up for us all
United victorious the hearts of our nation tonight. Repeat x <start> A passion of tears
close my soul as I
reach for your caress
Let me die in your flesh
while the heavenly bodies
burn out before our eyes
let me die and die again
Taste my blood
with emotional lust
Let your touch
embrace my mind
Show me a hidden path
to the source of wisdom
You are the rose on my grave...
Traces of flames made to ice
Never never
No No 
My river in which
the dawn never shows
is hope hiding
Blood of my past
is still dripping 
Simply dead <start> The ocean so vast can not see skyline
Sun's burning hot and the sea's dead calm
Traces of pain flashes of fear
Could it all have been true
Tiny wave send by God
Build up into a wall
To wash away the sins of mankind
Leaving no traces of life
Chorus
The price of wealth was too high to pay
Disaster struck over opulence
Gone was all that glory
And bale was total
The prophecy was true
Thus it came to fulfill
Now return return to the sea
So many men gave up to the sea
It washed away their pride
Greed vanity shallowness
Rectified by waves
Now the city rests in peace
In a cold lonely tomb
In the depths of sea
Aeons of wealth came to end
Into sea they descent
Chorus <start> Sensual awakening
Numbing feeling's dead
Conception's romanticised
Synthesized broken heart's to bled
Without emotion you heartstring's played
Strummed and severed to the tune of a tragic serenade
Without emotion your heartstrings break
Snapped and severed to the tune of a tragic sad cliche
No love lost
When all is said and done
There's no love lost <start> If the groove fits your desire
Then let it take you a little bit higher
I see we've finally found the groove
The kind of groove that's gonna make you move
And if you're feelin' what I feel
I'll bet you know that the groove is real
Hold on don't let go
Hold on take it slow
And if the groove fits your desire
Let it take you a little bit higher
Hold on hold on hold on hey
Everybody's groovin' to the funky beat
It's the kind of beat
That makes you wanna tap your feet
And you can do it without really tryin'
This funky groove is so electrifyin'
Hold on don't let go
Hold on take it slow
And if the groove fits your desire
Let it take you a little bit higher
Hold on hold on hold on

The kinda groove that's gonna make you groove
And if you're feelin' what I feel
Then you know that the groove is real

Into this molester freshly deceased children
You have born torn by my rape
The dead are not safe the lifeless child corpse
I will violate
Pleasure from the dead complete satisfaction
I open the coffin
Sick thoughts run through my head as I stare
At the dead over and over I can't escape
I begin the dead sex licking her young rotted orifice
I cum in her cold cunt shivering with ecstasy
For nine days straight I do the same
She becomes by dead decayed child sex slave
Her neck I hack cutting through the back
I use her mouth to eject
Here I cum blood gushes from
Bleeding black blood
Her head disconnected
As I came viciously I cut through her jugular vein
She's already dead I masturbate with her severed head
My lubrication her decomposition
Spending my life molesting dead children
Intercourse with infants
Curing heads on top of spikes
Boiling skulls
Skin sliding off of bones
Voices
The voices call
Voices
The voices are calling me
Buried dead I've spiritually infected
Call to me from beyond their graves
Bleed
I now bleed pus
I bleed the blood of the dead
I bleed on her livid skin
Thrusting myself within
Beginning to chop through her hairless crotch
Beyond what we know as death
It haunts me everyday
I hear the voice of every child
That lies next to me decayed
A fresh corpse to fill with my infection
Tortured before death no orifice left unfilled
Violated after death
Virgin hole I infest
Anal pore spewing cess
The sacred juice I ingest
Your dead child I defile

which relish this obscure rape of morality.


Within the halls of thy selfminded church
The daughter of innocent lays naked
Surrounded by the scorching black unholy wax...
Running along the virgin womb
the candles' blood makes her burning desires

My hunger of opposition appeased
The lord takes me over and over again...
Fifty infernal breeds I had to ride the third strike.

So much pain will be given... so much... so muuuuuchh

Display her thoughts an peace.

I see the river of blood in fury flow
I stare into the night yet my vision's clear
From the distant villages every word I hear
I am the almighty the one with wisdom wide
I am the great shadow and from daylight in my tower I hide
I have seen the abyss and all that lies within
I am the great shadow and I was born in sin
Thy Shadow swept by like an angel fading to grey
Thy eyes were like weakening candles leaving the flames to die
Thy pale cold face once so full of life
Now it's torn as thorns of ice
Thy towers fell to the ground
I am the almighty the one with wisdom wide
I am the great shadow and from daylight in my tower I hide
I have seen the abyss and all that lies within
I am the great shadow and I was born in sin
Shadows over a dark lost kingdom
The dark clouds are neverending
Yes this is the land the land of the black horizon
Where the shores are covered with bodies of thy followers
Triumphal vengeance Dethroning the shape of thou
Fade I say wither away
I am the almighty the one with wisdom wide
I am the great shadow no daylight over my kingdom ride
At the black horizons my eyes and soul's the wind
I am the great shadow and I was born in sin
I am the almighty the one with wisdom wide
I am the great shadow no daylight over my kingdom ride
At the black horizons my eyes and soul's the wind
I am the great shadow
BEHOLD THY LAND OF SIN <start> I will darken these exhaulted summers
and let you dwell in the blissful cold
Heal yourself into pure realities
explore the light from the other seal
Whispering like the silent mouth of tomorrow
Please give a cure for my sorrow
Your radiance sparkles like fiery dust
blisters in the wind of the absolute.
The satin web of thy imprisonment
shackles the muse of dreams come true.
Your theatre stands empty now
so we have lost you anyhow

The tears I weep lies frozen cold
you've slipped away in the fire.
Embrace me now in my final breath
Continue to grow my flower of death
Life is death's theatre
A flame of silent winter where you left me alone.
In the desolation of a broken promised land
you've slipped away in it's fire in the fire.
In sadness your mirthless winter
I bring gold to those who dread the sun.
Within my tears grows a flower of truth
and I gave my love to the eventide.

you made your bed
i hope you learned your lesson
i never would
turn my back on anyone
i won't follow your example
you said you'd always be here
but we know thats a lie
why did you have to say goodbye
you turn your face to hide your eyes
your false emotions are your disguise
you have to face your fears head on
stand and fight for what you love

are willing to die

He's the Lord of this land
He's the Lord of this paradise
He's the Lord of his people
He's the Lord of this tribe
Over thousands of years
He led his clans through this paradise <start> The evening swallows the last light
and from out of the incarnadine
forlornness creeps into my mind
where doubt dwells.
The light is dreaming of reincarnation
the night is dropping through the window pane
and a cruel invisible chain
enervates me.
And the river tears me down
and the waves clash over me
I floating down sad and slowly
home to my Gethsemane.
Beside the life I'm living now
there is another one that could have been
a brighter one I've never seen
a paradise.
Thoughts wither like autumn leaves
full of sorrow they fall off from me
fall with my tears my sanity
into the river.
And the river tears me down
and the waves clash over me
I floating down sad and slow
home to my Gethsemane.
My soul is haunted by wolves
and is ravened mercilessly.
In the last eclipse I can guess
where the river ends. <start> A new day's born
After a long hard ride
I'm on my way
To a place called home
But now I'm here
Lost between machines
Watching grey mute faces
Go on and destroy their lives
Why do you do this stop it now
'Cause in fact you're innocent
Like a new born child
Identity's lost no need for names
Identity's lost no need for ideas
Identity's lost no need for resistance
Identity's lost no need to be human
Why do you do this stop it now
'Cause in fact you're innocent
Like a new born child
Why do you do this...stop it now
'Cause in fact you're innocent
Like a new born child <start> Beautiful you are
Although your thirst it does consume
Ride the dream a greased up queen
Sinking towards the tomb
What was once a taste
Has now become your own desire
Wearing out your flesh
Your habit lives while you expire
Chorus
Knees scabbed up
Eyeliner running black
Fragile little spiders legs
Pupils blown out
Blown out to the sky
Mushroomed needs
It's all too late
Panic eye the tide runs low
Your nose and arms they crave
Time for fuel and sanctuary
Fodder for the grave
Pretty face a shattered smile
A broken fate within
Blue screen baby time's gone out
Push the needle in
Eye of the camera zooms in on you
Capturing moments you wish weren't true
Paid in white junked up and back on your route
A vision too bright must always fade out <start> Up to the front screaming with rage
Fists to the air face to the stage
Front row's the dead zone the peak of your fears
Slammin' of bodies blood in the ears
Smashin'em down down to the ground
Smashin'em down pound after pound
Smashin'em down down to the ground
Smashin'em down
Breakneck pace whipping's the dance
Trashing the place blood on the hands
Delirious fury strike as to smash
Here in the pit we batter your ass
Smashin'em down down to the ground
Smashin'em down pound after pound
Smashin'em down down to the ground
Smashin'em down
Kill after kill after kill after kill
Rattling skulls rapid succession
The line of battle mass domination
Front row's the place to let it go
Decibel fire a punishing show
Smashin'em down down to the ground
Smashin'em down pound after pound
Smashin'em down down to the ground
Smashin'em down
Down <start> Turn the sail after the wind you take the easy way out.
Make the trend to your believe a follower in all needs.
Your lack of independence shows your real face a wannabe.
Why do you refuse to see
Chorus
You hide your face in your hands your life is a delusion
Scared to face reality you wear your mask.
How can you still your hunger
This way you never will.
Chorus
You hide your face in your hands your emotions are flattening.
You're running cowardly with the herd your life is a delusion
If god were  you'd be a priest. It's your soul that's leaking ever
wanted to be a leader
This way out you'll never win
Chorus
You hide your face in your hands your emotions are flattening.
You are running cowardly with the herd your life is a delusion <start> How hard to fall asleep when I miss your majesty
How hard to live when I long for your devil's warmth
And livid skies over Wittenberg
And the empty streets and pavements of the town
Everything sinks into dead tears
And craves for charlatantry
Mephisto you are born inside me again
But will you speak my names in the ancient tongues
Among thousands flames of profigacy
Naked bodies flowing in the stream of wild dreams
I strip myself of my sacred virtues
The picture of male domination 
And blood and pride old and clotted already
But I can still see its drops on my bot face
And pain and candles everywhere and incense
And your dream which I wish to wake up in every day...
Everything so ephemental and equally unreal
And this blood and candles burnt away and they burn till today
Mephistopheles thousands times I saw in sleep
The essence of the eternal life but have I found it
If I am who I am then I shall bombard the human race
with the spell of hell
I shall go deeper down the Dante did
And tame the snakes of mine
Phallic signs and symbols the seed of truth
And belief in eternal life... <start> Everything I see is coloured grey
that's no recognition in dismay
every system has its second sight
indefinable the ruling might
Talking black and white
to lay down what is wrong and right
tell the lie of good and evil
narrow minded view
the source of all religious stew
cause everything I see
it's all just shades of grey
Trying to escape into belief
disappointment's all you will receive
leaving judgement to a greater power
a sight that evolution will devour
Painting black and white
declaring what is wrong or right
tell the tale of good and evil
smallminded point of view
the source of all the ritual stew
cause everything I see
it's all just shades of grey
Fear of total death haunting your mind
hoping your eternal life to find
searching for redemption is your aim
deciding others fate for you the same
Thinking black and white
to write down what is wrong and right
tell the lie of good and evil
narrow minded view
the base of all the ritual stew
cause everything I see
it's all just shades of grey <start> I'm so irritated
Being kicked to the curb
Every time you open your mouth
Your try to get in the last word
Those who live in glass houses
Should not be throwing stones
It all comes crashing down
You never left well enough alone
Seasons come
And treasons go
The more you hear
The less you know
So undeserved
No purpose served
All yo do is fray
My last nerve
So many excuses
Always laying the blame
You're always pointing the finger
Adding fuel to the flame
Another slander another slur
Another hollow apology
So many verbal abuses
Believe your own mythology
Seasons come
And treasons go
The more you hear
The less you know
So undeserved
No purpose served
All yo do is fray
My last nerve
I'll never be your scapegoat
Quote unquote
Your underling
Red light left turn you never learned
A crash fit for a king
Seasons come
And treasons go
The more you hear
The less you know
So undeserved
No purpose served
All yo do is fray
My last nerve <start> One touch one breath
Im drowning in your sweet confusion
I wont let go as long as you will show your passion
One path one step
The road leads you out to nowhere
No fear its clear Ill be there for you
I never knew
That I could feel this way
Out of the blue
Memories remain
See your destiny here it comes
You're reaching for tomorrow
Leave your misery seize the day
It will make you stronger
We can run away
Come alone and forget your sorrow
Oh it's your Destiny
It's your Destiny
I see the signs but I stand still
Can't leave you behind because
You mean so much to me
You never knew
That you could feel this way
Out of the blue
Memories remain
See your destiny here it comes
You're reaching for tomorrow
Leave your misery seize the day
It will make you stronger
We can run away
Come alone and forget your sorrow
Oh it's your Destiny
It's your Destiny yeah
See your destiny here it comes
You're reaching for tomorrow
Leave your misery seize the day
It will make you stronger
We can run away
Come alone and forget your sorrow
We can run away
It's your Destiny <start> M BerettaL Beretta Cappellari
All around I hear the crackling of broken ice
Vision is not clear because of fading light
Frost in the air but my heart is warm
Something burning levitates rising from the lake
By two great wings it will fly in the skies
Dragonhead on the bow with two shinin' eyes
Welcome on board I hear in my head
Tho' nobody' speaking now I can hear it loud

I feel the power growing inside of me
Everywhere I want to go
Drakkar does Drakkar knows

Dragonship spreading the wings
Bring me tonight into the fight
Dragonship riding the wind
The reign of death we'll make it end
Dragonship
The Dragon's Spirit
I am the Spirit of the Last Dragon
I live inside this ship
I've been waiting for centuries
For a pure of heart
My honour's to serve you
To do as you command
My fate is to help you
In a mission so hard
We've finally reached the castle now
Dispel the magic it won't keep me out
Cold flames erupt from the Drakkar's jaws
And the shield is melted down blue flames all around

Chinme as I walk through river hades
And soon my heart is frozen it'll never
Stop to beat nothing in this dimension
Can bring me my defeat the secrets in
Your arteries will forever remain unsaid
Our sun is slowly dying never never to
Burn red. repeat chorus you were meant
To be another one time has come frozen
Earth the stillness the world will come
And go repeat chorus
 <start> One by one they stand single file
To see the king of the hill atop his worthless pile
The king has no clothes
Throw stones watch him implode
All for one or are we all alone
Brick by brick it's a house built on lies
Because illusion is easy to young adoring eyes
It's not hard to see
Through deceit make them believe
Fight the stampede be the one to lead

Rung by rung he's climbed up to the top
But once the engine is running it's hard to make it stop
Ignore what you're told
Eyes closed dig from below
Don't care where you're from just where you go
Step by step we're ignoring the signs
That cocky bastard is planting the seeds of his demise
There's nothing to gain only shame
We fan the flames
Fight through the pain live another day
Just one more day

Do I belong
Do I belong
Writing's on the wall
That Cheshire smile says you don't have the courage to take the fall
You're not fooling anyone
You're no one

Do I belong
Do I belong <start> Never seen light Fragments of hope shattered
This frozen wasteland lost souls gather
Shrieking voices echo in the wind
Piercing our heart voices of the dead
From the empty hollow darkness
Eyes watch without seeing
Comfort and warmth long lost
As their loved ones stop being
Graves open ready for arrival
They left no chance for survival
Even anger flowing in ones veins
Doesn't take away the pain
Black valleys filled with hatred and despair
Through the trees
Reflecting their lifeless stare
Terror slithers into all coldly upon the land
Out of the soil with its deathwhite hand

It's another breakthrough in homiletics
There's been an attempt on ordinary lives
Illfare administered by social medics
Unlike Deutschneyland after dark
Here is science without failure
Nonexistent speciesw in cretaceous park
A freer market meticulously tailored
We need night observation devices
We need new methods to set the prices
We need means to handle incorporate thugs
We need a name for every bug
We're host to parasitic inorganic tissue
So oil prospecting is not the issue
There's inexhaustible competition
With footmen at home with foreign missions
But the halo crumbles under the weight
Of their private real estates
We've got artificial stupidity
Now what could be done about exergy
Well Deutschneyland after dark
There is science without failure
Nonexistent speciesw in cretaceous park

We need new methods to set the prices

Blood and mud and thunder all the same
To those who close their ranks to Gille's men

Creatures of the dark creeping up and down the countryside
Little angles out to pasture once again
Torture garden rules of thumb apply
To sacred flesh and the naked eye
Golgothic this erotica
Stinking of honey and worse sulfur
So black was the magic in this tragical kingdom
The superstitions grew
Wise to the wolves that surprised their children
Gagged in sacks and dragged back to
Tiffauges
It's roads now home to a beautiful stranger
Lifting her veil
Spinning her lies
Tender eyes neverending danger
It grows
A rose that chose death for it's bedmuck
Prickles in wait
Thanking her spies
Trickling thighs her only hiccup
And though she walks the forest trails
She's far from innocent or frail
She leads them down the path where darkness dwells
That night is rife with celebration
The tower sings
Where so much foul illumination
Strikes a lighthouse for the things
That slither and slather at the border of the pentagram
Mid sour dreams
A beauty pageant for the gathering damned
Of slaughtered lambs and tortured screams

Torture garden rules of thumb apply
To sacred flesh and the naked eye

Stinking of honey and worse sulfur
So black was the magic in this tragical kingdom
In this castle of loupgarou
When moonstruck veins inflamed deranged on
A parcel of victims now tied to
Tiffauges
Engorged on the hordes of the anorexic
Cherubim forced
Naked and blind
A holocaust mind designed their exit
A libertine so grim
Sometimes tore them limb from limb
Slitting their throats
Pissing on graves

i was born to murder this world
suffer to stay alive
bleed out the week
only the damned survive <start> No lord shall stand before myself
I can strike the light and see through the truth
For I'm the Deicide Dominus what could you do
Thou has failed you now once again and always will
On the cross forgotten son a sacrifice it had to be done
Died for me well that's too bad I don't believe
Killed by sins of the evil what I am
Your destruction reasons of a world in pain
Blind disciple you will never live again
Wage of death course of life
Unsematic birth of the Deicide
Eyes of pain pleads to death
As you're put to rest
Three days to rise
If he lives again he is sure to die
I killed Jesus
Just to see him bleed on his pulpis throne
I am evil
I'm the Deicide and i killed the lord
No more reasons
I will kill the world in another form
I rule this world
Nail him
I can strike the light and see trought the truth
For I'm the Deicide Dominus what could you do
Thou has failed you now once again and always will
On the cross forgotten son a sacrificeit had to be done
Died for me well that's too bad I don't believe
Killed by sins of the evil what I am
Your destruction reasons of a world in pain
Blind disciple you will never live again <start> The monster of hate overcomes rational thought
Fast fuse burning the lessons I've been taught
It's just too late to remember who I am
The things that I believe in and the way that I stand
About peace harmony respect for fellow man
All that shit just got thrown against the fan
In my violent rage they say that I am a criminal
There ain't no labels within the human animal
In this world of bigotry and pain
The violence spreads and terror reigns
The opinions in our minds replace our souls
As the human animal takes control
The path of selfdestruction has brought me to this point
As modern day society cracks arthritic joints
No mercy is shown it's hitting all my weak spots
I never had a gun but now I want to hear gun shots
I sleep not for fear I get no rest
Twisted in a sense 'cause my button has been pressed
How many ways have you shown me that you hate me
And then you wonder why what have you done to me lately
I am an animal
The human animal
A human animal
Tension building I'm being pushed too far
I need a release take the lid of this jar
My voice seems useless in this situation
Time to take action release frustration
Everyone has limits only so much you can take
Antagonizing pressure is the icing on the cake
Physical abuse induced or subliminal
Open the door unleash the human animal
Flashes of red my vision of distortion
Like a virus it spreads giving each his portion
Contagious psychopath the vibe is in synch
Movin' like a pack we're back to basic instincts
Wild at heart now we show our true colors
In the path of desperation we forget about our brothers
Who would die for us now we die for no man
Deranged from the instance violence came too hard
Instinctual behavior in the given situation
Leaves us with no call for rationalization <start> Laboratorio cristalitos

Ancient instincts are filling my mind
Nature is call me to unite
To unite with her at midnight

He coming out from the thicket
He demand
That yoke of the sun will be broken

We're will together ruling this world
And nothing will can break us

They never stop and it drives me insane.
Even in sleep they torment my soul
my inner demons take all control.
Slowly it's transforming me into a beast
nails turn to claw and I got white fangs as teeth.
The hundreds of voices inside my head
they will only stop the day I am dead.
Voices oh voices leave me alone
why are you inside me and torment my soul.
Why don't you leave and let me be
demons inside get out I beg thee.
 voices inside telling me who's about to die.
They are in control of my mind.
 demons inside to kill them all only one must die.
It is a shame it must be me...
What have I done to deserve this hell
am I better off dead or locked up in a padded cell.
I feel the demons bloodlust slowly increase
saying that next murder must be a masterpiece.
Voices oh voices leave me alone
why are you inside me and torment my soul.
Why don't you leave and let me be
demons inside get out I beg thee.
 voices inside telling me that this one must die.
They are in control of my mind.
 demons inside I hear them rejoice when someone dies.
But I am the one with blood on my hands.
 voices inside telling me who's about to die.
They are in control of my mind.
 demons inside to kill them all only one must die.
It is a shame it must be me...
 voices inside telling me it is your turn to die.
They are in control of my mind
 demons inside I hear them rejoice now when you die.

When all has been said
Never look back always ahead
When the book's been read
Have no regrets
Never walk back always ahead
My blood is thick your word's thin
Spread from a beggar's mind
My blood is thick no regrets
'Bout what I leave behind
Time is all I can lose
Now time to choose
I choose my time
I feed off the hand that is mine
Nothing to lose
Time only time only time
When the book's been read
Have no regrets
Never walk back always ahead
My mind is tired beaten numb
By the stench from a beggar's mind
My blood is thick beat yourself
I won't stay behind
Time is all I can lose
Now time to choose
I choose my time
I feed off the hand that is mine
Nothing to lose
Time only time only time
My blood is thick your words are thin
My blood is thick your words are thin
Time is all I can lose
Now time to choose
I choose my time

Nothing to lose
Time only time only time <start> My scabs are almost picked
Slowly growing into this
Feelings I just can't let go
I am such a bore that you need that much more
Go back that way and see what you get from me then
Nothing at all
My dead hands rise
Why am I this way
Face my past I can't let go
I see them in the jel
Laughing at me it is hell
Nothing can stop this torture
Fake my way through life
Call on me my wife
Went back that way and I saw just what I was worth
Nothing at all
My dead hands rise
Why am I this way
Face my past I can't let go
I won't take no for an answer <start> cold attacks me as the liquid is in touch
muffled sounds from somewhere
like unborn through the amniotic fluid
getting upset to reach my air
in this condition I try to understand
what has happened after that step
I was hearing my name
rebounding through the walls
expanding in the veins
it rushes with me with my thoughts
descends into the well
reaching my own blue lake
I see the unreal pipes of feelings
they look at me and flow
to take a wish into below
are you a whispering soul
or a thoughtless neurone
tell me your name and I'll bring you my lord
into the halls of your vice
you've been too blind 'till now
open your eyes
take off your shroud
yes I feel open minded
I outline coloured thoughts
your spirit is somewhere here
in your pulsing deep blue lake
the upper light seems to come from inside
liquid tension pulls me into the air
like unborn through the amniotic fluid
I'd remain in its womb
the light calls me to his reign
I'm born again
how hard is this night to see
my life breaking to free
a new light from tomorrow
beneath the past a sun is shining pale
with my hands I raise it into the air
found the dust in my eyes
submerge in a water now warm
merged into the first reflection
close upon me
this night lulled by waves
light breath of a liquid called life
quencing my thirst
I still dream <start> The Northern Wind over Glacier Park
carries the musk of the elken rut
An ammonia stench thick with lust
the scent of battle death and conquest.
A lone pair of antlers crests above the harem
thirty cows drinking at a Logan Pass creek.
The bull elk spots shifting light between the trees
another young challenger to his throne.
From the wood a bugled shriek
The females freeze lift their heads and stare.
A rival bursts from the brush
and charges for the leader of the pack.
Skulls collide
Punctured hide
Beaten pride
Nature's guide is war.
Fight to the death.
Panting and stumbling
Resolve is crumbling
Bloodlines their wager
Their lives in danger
One
final
charge
to end it all
Elk clash the young buck
Swifter his horn stuck
through his elder's eye.

Hey little boy all sorrow will be gone

At their breaking point. At the end of the rope.

Forgotten what the ground feels like
I try so hard to be strong
But life seems so far away
Can I find a way through this
Or did I lose the strength to hold on
To hold on
As the bright lights of success fade
And the spark of glory dies
I look to the shadows of failure
To understand the reasons why
I can't reach out for what's gone
Waking dreams haunt me
Backwards thoughts betray
Illusions of what was cloud my mind
I can't keep the demons away
Impossible to move forward
'Cause I I'm chained to yesterday
My visions keep me prisoner
Harsh memories make me bleed
I must find the strength to see beyond the sun
To find that which belongs to me
That which makes me stronger
That which makes me stronger <start> T on taas nit aamuja

The hand of fate is crushing down before me
The eyes of god have turned away no angels are in sight
As I face the final chapter of our story
And now I hear the millions cry screaming
Into obvilion you take their lives
Hell is thy home
Hell is thy home darkness thy destiny
Where you belong no need for sympathy
The antichrist is back again
Disguised as the saviour of man
Servants of evil breed evil
Storm fills the clouds I'll wait for the fall
Sowing the end grace comes to fall
And now you're waiting for a sign dreaming
The day is near when all the world is thine
Because hell is thy home yeah
Hell is thy home darkness thy destiny
Where you belong no need for sympathy
Again you watch the millions die no tears in your eyes
And your followers will hall the forces of evil won't fail
In the great white hall
A monster's working on the fall
It's bloody war will kill us all
Hell is thy home darkness thy destiny
Where you belong no need for sympathy
Hell is thy home darkness thy destiny
Where you belong no need for sympathy
Hell is our home <start> She runs to the river down below
Towards a boat under a willow
Away from the mirror the loom and the tower
Where she yearned for him hour after hour
Under a sky like a dark blue dome
Stands the queen of loneliness
A skin as white as the rivers foam
Which tips the hem of her dress
A crown of a pearl garland she wore
Blinking to Camelot in moonlight
To which she stares through tears
Tears that are clouding her sight
A forlorn goddess
Seeking for her God
Carving in the stern
The lady Shallot
Like a prophet seeing the entire future
She looses the chain
While death stretches its hand and lures
Seizing her to gain
Paralysed and in distress she floats
Into the night by darkness clothe
When the lady sings a mournful song
Chanting through the spheres of night
Where it dissolves at the horizon
Like her life
Undone... <start> Her skin is soft as wind
Pale like my palms of sin
And her eyes like dark blue seas
Stare me with icy dreams
In my dreams
We shall be
In my dreams
In the worlds beneath
And the nightfall is for my bride
Mistress of dawn embraced by night
Shimmery meadows before the dusk
Beyond the shadows they will turn to dust
Her skin...
Timeless is our lovelorn night
Secrets of caressing might
Are not held by the blinding light
Forever in our eyes we see the dying lies
Of the truth of the past
to days to come will they last
Fading to dreams there is something that calls
Her divergent love in those shady halls
For there I'll return for there I will yearn
Willing to where the rays of light will not turn
Her spellbinding eyes take my breath
In forbidden paradise for her I have bled
For her lost I will shed tears unseen
Bereaved I will be to see what is planned for me
Her skin is soft as wind
Soft like the swan's white wings
And her voice makes the weathers fall
Oh hear the beauty of her song
Storms have torn
But we stand tall
Storms have torn
In those shady halls <start> A hot June night he leaves his wife at home
Electric light he finds a public phone
and calls her up a shaky tone this is the last time I am doing it
'Cos he knows just what he'll get
From Feena Roulette put my love right to the test
Feena Roulette I can't get you out my head
A heartbeat race hand drifting down her back
This ilembrace is perfectly intact
he has said to himself this is the last time I am doing it
but he knows just what he'll get
From Feena Roulette put my love right to the test
Feena Roulette I can't get you out my head
She's closing in he wanting it so bad
Now he can't win his fate is in her hands
Anytime any day she's aware that she can have her way
What she wants is what she gets
Feena Roulette put my love right to the test
Feena Roulette makes my blood rush to my head
Feena Roulette put my love right to the test
Feena Roulette I can't get you out my head
My Feena Roulette
My Feena Roulette
Feena Roulette
Go <start> Released from nether regions bowels of the earth.
Seeping through cracks to foul the air above.
A lifeline to those to which sleep is eternal.
Concocted since the dawn of time.
To now release agonized souls.
Spit forth the dead
Carried on the air purity aiding the filth.
Seeking consecrated ground sensing cemeteries in a blanket of dust.
Fertalizing the infertile from six feet under.
Intoxicating with false life coaxing from the brink of decay.
Animating the inanimate from wooden box to light of day.
Exodus from the ground stale forms tasting air.
Each united in their cause yet of it's ground.
Ground mates unaware.
Now the dead govern the earth.
All resistance to them crushed.
Life is now minority the world another hell.
Wipeout <start> Lord make me an instrument of your peace
Where there is hatred let me sow love
Where there is injury pardon
Where there is doubt faith
Where there is despair hope
Where there is darkness light
And where there is sadness joy
O divine master grant that I may
not so much seek to be consoled as to console
to be understood as to understand
To be loved as to love
For it is in giving that we receive
it is in pardoning that we are pardoned
And it's in dying that we are born to eternal life
Amen <start> Speaking my mind
Single trail of thought
Difference in the way we perceive
Your ability to receive
I know you listen faults lie between us.
You hear my speaking something changes my words.
Hordes of inconsistencies and fiction swarm the paths of your thoughts.
Your interpretation of my actions convenient to your cause.
I'll say again another way.
Splintered slithers of truth rumored tales my proof.
Tolerance prevents and outcome.
Hordes of inconsistencies and fiction swarm the paths of your thoughts.
Your interpretation of my actions convenient to your cause.
I'll say again another way.
Words a mouldable form of matter
Interpretation your point is shattered
Lies a manifestation of truth
Changes arise because of a difference
Words a mouldable form of matter
Interpretation your point is shattered
Lies a manifestation of truth
Don't accuse me because of a difference
I know you hear my words
But somehow there's faults that lie between us.
Speaking my mind
Single trail of thought
I know you're listening
But some faults lie between us
I know you hear my words.
Hordes of inconsistencies and fiction swarm the paths of your thoughts.
Your interpretation of my actions convenient to your cause.
I'll say again another way. <start> One we were scum of the Earth
Now we've cleared our names
In Nifelheim came rebirth
Baptized in Mount Doom's flames
A decade now we've fought this war
Never yielding from our path
Our journeys take us to foreign shores
Where we let our metal blast
We've been battered and left for dead
We've been beaten and we have bled
But we always made it through  Vs the world
This may be our last quest
Before we're put to rest
The end is coming soon  Vs the world
Warriors of the grave took us south
Hell bent on genocide
They made us face the brutal truth
This would be no easy ride
Grotesque creatures of the sky
Met with us on winter fields
Christian god cast aside  Massacre of hallowed eve
We've been battered and left for dead
We've been beaten and we have bled
But we always made it through  Vs the world
This may be our last quest
Before we're put to rest
The end is coming soon  Vs the world
Persian demons brought us south
On merciless campaign
We've raided the western shores
Always going against the grain
All these years we've fought to win
And sometimes almost died
I tell you now we won't give in
Without a vicious fight
We've been battered and left for dead
We've been beaten and we have bled
Versus the world <start> Wir sind Gtter 
Gott ist der Mensch 
Sein ist die Hand die schaft 
Sein ist die Hand die verletzt 
Gtterdmmerung
We are gods God is man
His is the hand that makes his is the hand that wounds
As I behold your crucified lord
It is pity I feel not a sign of purification
And yet it are millions taught by his word
Die Gtterdmmerung ist hier

Die Gtterdmmerung ist hier
A universal message of love
Lessons for the world to be clear
But I sense megalomania in his word
Dogmatic based on fear
Die Gtterdmmerung ist hier
Die Gtterdmmerung ist hier
Like the word taught in that other book
By some other prophet born in the East
Screaming 'jihad' Lifes they took
On the non believers corpses they feast
Not that Jahweh offered the other cheek
As he so firmly told his followers to do
Too many sacrifices in His name
Far too many lies not to look through
And here I stand alone in the night
No god or master above me
Do I suffer from this lack of divinity
Faith my dear friend can be splendid indeed
A force to hold on when the feeble soul bleeds
Religion served to the masses
Might be a dangerous seed
Forced down your throat
The last thing a free man needs
I walk a lonely path
Am I so blind to see
At least I can say my soul is free
And my only god is me...
We are gods God is man
His is the hand that makes his is the hand that wounds
We are gods God is man
His is the hand that makes his is the hand that wounds <start> If you ever been in love though it ain't easy
Every time you pack up you never in the believing
Talk like you're so bad telling your girls I have hurt you back
And everything that was alright with the other way
And now you're standing there with tears in hand
Anything that I ... to say when he left he change with the weather
But if you don't know nothing else you know what I take around is there
So when you fall and scrape your heart don't look for another one
Just trust don't
I won't need no two hearts if you break it put a band aid over and then move on
hurt them too strong and then follow it's not a secret
The pain is ... hope you can take it put a band aid over and then move on
girl don't wait don't wait two strokes
Put a band aid over ya put a band aid over ya
Whenever I go out I love when you see me
And my ... ain't held down you can't believe it
Tell me what you expect I will be struck up in my bed
It's not the end of the world just cause you went away
I'll find somebody else to love me the way that you couldn't
And everything is ... and I'm so much better
So if I don't know nothing else know we can take care of me well
So when you call I press ignore and I give another thought oh I
I won't need no two hearts if you break it put a band aid over and then move on
hurt them too strong and then follow it's not a secret
The pain is ... hope you can take it put a band aid over and then move on
girl don't wait don't wait two strokes
Put a band aid over ya put a band aid over ya
We came in crying tears of right away of right away
We kissed once more and made it all threw away oho
I'm good I'll patch myself up and keep rocking I'm good
I'm good you can hurt me boy but it ain't no stopping I'm good
I'm good I'll patch myself up and keep rocking I'm good
I'm good you can hurt me boy but it ain't no stopping I'm good <start> We who never feared the moonlight
We who never fled from the rain
All the dying on this earth
All this pain since the birth
I see  they are creeping
They are dying
I feel their fear the deadlight in their eyes
They are drowning in the angel's tears
Do you feel the eternal fire
Let it burn let it burn higher
All the dying on this earth
Let they die in your fire
The great inferno is coming
The end of mortality is near
All the dying on this earth
All this pain since the birth
I see  they are weeping
They are dying
Faces  speaking of decay
Creature  abandoned castaway <start> Who would have thought that  years later I'd be back at it again
Starting right where I left off from when I was just a kid
This is where I got my start and where my life began to change
Now that I'm back in this business I'll make sure you remember my name
I knew where I was going just didn't know it would be this far
Life is strange you never know when it will take that turn
Life is strange you better be ready for anything
I made the best out of every situation never let the odds stack against me
I did what ever I had to make this happen for me and my family
And I'll never take it back
So give me your best shot
And make sure you don't miss it
The road to the top is all part of burning bridges
This band has come so far and we've barely scratched the surface
We are here to stay and haven't even started
Who would have thought that  years later I'd be back at it again
Starting right where I left off from when I was just a kid
This is where I got my start and where my life began to change
Now that I'm back in this business I'll make sure you remember
That I made the best out of every situation never let the odds stack against me
I did what ever I had to make this happen for me and my family <start> I work all night I work all day to pay the bills I have to pay
Ain't it sad
And still there never seems to be a single penny left for me
That's too bad
In my dreams I have a plan
If I got me a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work at all I'd fool around and have a ball...
Money money money
Must be funny
In the rich man's world
Money money money
Always sunny
In the rich man's world
Ahaahaaa
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
A man like that is hard to find but I can't get him off my mind
Ain't it sad
And if he happens to be free I bet he wouldn't fancy me
That's too bad
So I must leave I'll have to go
To Las Vegas or Monaco
And win a fortune in a game my life will never be the same...
Money money money
Must be funny

Felt no pain You're deaf to every sound <start> Where has the fire of hope gone
Why has the wisdom been forlorn
Visionaries write their destiny
And ridicule their true belief
Let sacred angels fall again
Swear truce to doctrines that prevail
We hold the sceptre of your doom
On darkened skies crows still reigns

Deserted wastelands breed damnation's souls
Awakened from a deep complacent sleep
Eager the reanimate a kindred lost
And from their futile sacrilege
They have been redeemed

Swordage Sverdtid
Wolfage Vargtid
I saw the doombringer coming to call
In form of the blind
And the arrow of fraud
Pierced through the skin of the fair
In accents of despair
As he died away
Borne throughout the misty air
The sun turned pale and no one spoke
Vows were sworn that very night
This death will be avenged
I saw the ship burning floating away
As a funeral pyre
To be claimed by the sea
A biting sarcasm rose
Whence the sly one fled
Hence the bondage of blood
Burned throughout the misty air
Ringhorn disappeared and no one spoke
Vows were sworn that very night
This death will be avenged
I saw the darkness descend upon the nine worlds
To enhance the coming of the end
AllFather then stod up and addressed upon the nine worlds
Axeage Swordage Wolfage
Northwards and netherwards for nine nights through darkness
And through the vastness of Vid
Towards the ninth realm for nine nights through darkness
Axeage Swordage Wolfage
Northwards and netherwards the eighthooves were pounding
Through mist and pathways of death
Across the burning bridge the eighthooves were pounding
Axeage Swordage Wolfage
I felt the darkness increase upon the nine worlds
The winter tighened its grip
Grim Fimbul rage addressed upon the nine worlds
Axeage Swordage Wolfage
I saw the wolfage coming to call
In form of the blind
And the arrow of fraud
Seeds of destruction were sowed
By the hands of doom
And by daring the meek
Tears thou kept to thouself
To avoid his return
To be wept of out Hel
Shields shall be cloven in vain
For this act of deceit
As the fate has forseenaca <start> I look to the ancient skies
everywhere i look there's another sun
what will it matter
If i extinguish one
Evaluate the value
Evaluate your life
There is a price to pay
There is a price on your head
Evaluate the value
Evaluate your life
If you speak with a golden tongue
I'll listen with greedy ears
If you teach me how
to close my eyes
I'll keep my conscience clear
Is there a purpose left to find
by accident or by design
It doesn't matter if your eyes are open when your mind is blind
Trapped under ice
trapped by your hollow lies
I sense my sun wont shine much longer
but you will pay the price
you will pay the price
how could we ever forget
what we have already learned
with all the bridges we
burned
review the consequence and think beyond only you and I
Figure out the purpose  your deed is a crime
there's another way
another ending to our tale
real eyes realize real lies
don't succumb to the paraphrase
If you speak with a golden tongue
I'll listen with greedy ears
If you teach me how
to close my eyes
I'll keep my conscience clear
must be another way
this time we must be brave
real eyes realize real lies
real eyes realize real lies
So listen up and listen close
This is not the path I chose
So listen up and listen close
I will take a stand right here right now <start> Wandering
Walking
Drifting with the tide

Finding our way through life
Whatever we find
It is all about to last for a while
Just a better way to live on our place

Spreading out
Infecting like disease 
All life below

Annihilator  annihilator

His power paints the city blood red

Nowhere to run nowhere to hide
Don't look behind cause you're dead
Annihilator  annihilator
Annihilator  annihilator
You're trapped alone
Filled with fear
There's no one to help you
The storm is coming closer <start> I've filled my veins with poison
And silenced my voice just to take another breath
I've broken my vows to you a thousand times before
I'm losing myself sit back and watch me die
How can I say that I'm scared of death
When I spend each day sprinting towards my eternal grave
Every move that I make every step that I take crawling to my eternity
These words are my plea
Show yourself and rescue me
Kill the pain from the curse of myself
Kill the pain show me the way back home
Kill the pain guide me back to you
Guide me back to you
I've let these demons bleed me dry 
Screaming these words to the sky
Kill the hate within me
When I'm at my darkest I crave for light
But when your hand reaches out I abandon you

I'd never live that down

But I was drowning in the hell that I raised
And when there's nothing left to say
You wont need a reason
To kill these cancers that may come you way
Long cold wind hits face to remind your not done
Unloved failure. Serves as lessons learned
Faith regained from plagues
What will I find in me

The falls of the unaligned
I gave you every word to hold

I ran with the dead and chased my own shadow
Built walls of belief
I saw the dead rise

Your punishment
Is life damnation
Forever enslaved
Forever deranged
Searching for  The reason to all your pain
Suffering  From splits within your brain
Cold sweat  Runs through your veins
Nothing remains

Tears you apart
Conflict inside
Two minds in fight
All your efforts
Just wasted time
You've paid your toll
Disfigured soul <start> I feel the heat from the flames
I'm dying the essence of pain
This bitter life has come to an end
My mind is tired my heart is bleeding
I can feel the taste from the nectars of Eden
Never again shall I face the pain of living
In a world of shame
When my yellow dies under velvet thoughts
I feel no pain within
I've kissed the crystals of Eden
Out of the fire I leave this bitter pain
My only desire get away from this world of shame
Come take me higher save me from the flames
The essence of power a jester's sweet charade
I feel the pain decline
I'm leaving this world behind
I feel the pain decline
I'm leaving this world behind
Never again. No more pain
I feel the taste from the nectars of Eden
I am leaving this world of utopia
No more sadness cause I'm on my way
In a state unacquainted to nausea
In the Garden of Eden I stay
I feel the pain decline
I'm leaving this world behind
I feel the pain decline
I'm leaving this world behind
Out of the fire I leave this bitter pain
My only desire get away from this world of shame
Come take me higher save me from the flames
The essence of power a jester's sweet charade <start> Elementary eavesdropper
They're things you cannot comprehend
Did you want a kiss
Did you want a flower in your fist
Or was it all just make pretend
I'll follow you until the end
I'll follow
Burning down your home burning down
Just to rebuild it again burning down
And I would never steal from you burning down
Or anyone of your friends burning down
Adolescent eavesdropper
They're things you wish you could forget
So you start to weep
And you start to drink yourself to sleep
And you only kiss your cigarette
But don't we all feel sick to death
Or do we
Burning down your home burning down
Just to rebuild it again burning down
And I would never steal from you burning down
Or anyone of your friends burning down
You shower me with gifts
They don't fix it no
I'm no purchase bastard
Fuck you tell me right now
If you find me on the offensive
For the first time help out
Tell me right now
Are you happy and how can you be
Are you happy with me
You're an adult eavesdropper
By now the roles have been replaced
And you inflict the shit you hated as a kid
There's only one way to break this curse
Burning down your home burning down
Just to rebuild build it again burning down
And I would never steal from you burning down
Or anyone of your friends burning down <start> Instrumental <start> Setiap kali kau marahi diriku ini
Tergugur jantungku tergaman membisu
Setiap kali kau kasariku tak mengerti
Kau berjanji tidak kau ulangi lagi
Tiada guna kita bersama
Jika jiwa merana
Akulah wanita
Di sini nokhtahnya jangan kau cabar

Aku bukannya selemah yang kau sangka
Aku tak rela diseksa haa
Beranikah lagi bersemuka
Rasakan kuasa tamparan wanita
Perasaan cinta tiada lagi di dada
Hanya perasaan takut menghantu minda
Mana bisa ku percaya... janjimu dusta
Lihtalah saja luka daku kau dera
Tiada guna berkatakata
Masanya sudah tiba
Akulah wanita
Tidak lagi gentar... jangan kau cabar
Aku perlu berdiri tanpamu
Berani berdiri kerana benar <start> Instrumental <start> I was born in France called the Maid of Orleans
Led by the voices of the Saints
I went to the Court dressed in men's clothes
To save my people from the yoke
I was given troops to destroy the English roots
And to crown the Dauphin at Reims
I'm not a man searching the glory
I'm just the hand chosen to fight
It's a long way to our freedom
I was betrayed. I'm burning at the stake
My own blood sold me in the battlefield
Charles the King made no attemps to save me
I won't be free till the day of my death
The pyre is light. I see the end
I'm not a man searching the glory
I'm just the hand chosen to fight
It's a long way to our freedom
I was betrayed. I'm burning at the stake
I'd rather die than live chained in this cell
I hold to what I have already said
I won't be free till the day of my death
The pyre is light. I see the end
I'm not a man searching the glory
I'm just the hand chosen to fight
It's a long way to our freedom
I was betrayed. I'm burning at the stake <start> I've got the stages everytime I try to touch you that's what it's like. I've got the something. I can't even breathe they built a shelf on my neck and my back. I've got the stages. I can't even say it. Why won't the words come out right I've got the stages everytime I try to touch you every time I stand too close to you. You freeze the faces and save them for dissection. you put the pieces in your pocket smudge them out. Burn the stains to the edge with cigarettes and c herry red. Like secrets on a string. Standing on a line. Standing on the baseline baseline. Standing I can feel you Can you feel me <start> There is a theory about us
What we always never
In the background on the shadow
Another theory about us
Today's evidence taken by the new wave
Just like the Sun which can be moved
With words we can stop the Earth
Today's evidence taken by the new wave
The falsehood dies in the silence
And the honesty has the same fate
Just like the Sun which can be moved
With words we can stop the Earth
Today's evidence taken by the new wave
Just like loving without love
The rapid stream can be stopped
Today's evidence taken by the new wave
The false hands turning to dust
Mother's hands have the same fate
Just like loving without love
The rapid stream can be stopped
Love which always never
Not like the evidence
With the taste of the shadow
There's only a theory
Even you even me <start> Hes still Good good

After all that I have been through
Hes still good

It suffers 
Old and weak
No further arguing
There is war at hand
The system's failing
Engine's running
Then after all
I sense the end is dawning
These lunatics deny the truth
I know I will not fail
There'll be
War
It's now or never
We shall stand together
One by one
This world is sacred
I'm coming home
War
It's now or never
We shall stand together
One by one
This world is sacred
I'm coming home
Coming home
You chase in twilight
And you know
You will be on your own
On your own
The misery shown
I'll be alone in this hour
I face the unknown
Witness the end
I'm bleeding. I'm fading
Here in my final hour
When long lost memories return
And a voice keeps calling
All dead and gone
It's out of hand
Life is in motion
I'm wishing. I'm fading
Time to wake up
Face the truth
I'm sinking
I'm drowning
There's no doubt and no regret
Time to reveal now
This is no illusion
It is real
Carry on the flame
It's not over now
Watch me I will rise
Time to reveal now
I know I will not fail
Anymore
I'm the one forever
All that really matters
Blessed realm
This world is sacred
I'm coming home
War
It's now or never
We shall stand together
One by one
This world is sacred
I'm coming home
Yesterday's gone
There's no today no tomorrow
I'm raised from the dead
The ritual failed
There at the gates
I'm left alone in this hour
Driven insane
I am left alone
And now I drown in deepest shadows
While the golden hall is sealed
I'm wishing
I'm fading
And I'm part of the machine
My eyes are the eyes of a dead man
And feel the unholy stream
The source of my power
Tenergy
I'm in control
I will live forever
All that really matters
Blessed realm
This world is sacred
I'm coming home
War
It's now or never
We shall stand together
One by one
This world is sacred
I'm coming home
I spread my wings
But keep on falling
I should have known
I can see it coming
The war is over
There's whispering in the wind
Just let me out of here
There is no way
There's no end
While all the suffering goes on
All that I know
Is that I'm not insane
It's not over <start> shattered pieces fragments of a broken heart. i gave you everything all that i could time and time again. constant memories of everything we had. these tears always bring me back. why does it have to be this way why can't we share this love why do i still love you i can't hide these scars on my wrists. why do i still love you i can't hide the blood on my hands. your reflection torn forever from my memory my last breath as sweet as the first kiss. i can't swallow the lie i love you to choke again. <start> soft spoken words to you who knew that they'd spill the truth a lot to lose with the intake you choose last chance now I wouldn't think it over once cause I know these parasites breed allies take it from me for what it's worth tonight threat company they're making things worse for yourself for your mind a lapse in judgment will foreshadow more than you think sucker punch now on your feet you still find there are those who stand control you said everything would be okay and it's alright you said that you were wrong but I knew that you were always right hear me out <start> Burned alive from the inside
My hatred set ablaze
I am sickened by this life
You could never understand
All my prayers were never answered
Despite my loyalty
You wrote right from wrong
All you did was feed on my faith
I am witness to the truth
I can see past your lies
Blood of my blood  A sacrifice
Cannibalize the body of christ
I will strike at your strength
A wolf amongst the sheep
Your flock will be devoured
They'll be like me BURNED ALIVE
I will not atone
No saving our souls
Consumed all my beliefs
Inside I'm burned alive
BURNED ALIVE
I will not become a victim
Sell my soul into slavery
I don't need forgiveness
Care not for mercy
No more good and evil
Just a pile of smoking ash
Set fire to our sins
And together we will burn alive <start> 
Memories of torment strikes me
Attempts were made to suffocate me at birth
Fools
I was already ancient
Thou can not kill what breeds within Thee
Alas this agony
The emptiness of earthborn pride
Hath stirred my faithful heart
Which guided me to darker paths
Far away from their pestilent ways
Cleansed was I from deceitful grace
Yet put to scorn was I
By those unclean
Enslaved by ignorance
They blindly spat upon the deity of hate
Awake is the darkest fiend
By the fallen one I shall arise
Upon bewildered masses
To whom the indulgence of my soul
Portray as sin made god
I shall revile and quell the source
Whence mockery of my kind derive
This I know
Facile shalt my quest not come to pass
Deathwish be my gift to all at last
Honour
Commended no longer as virtue
Yet shalt be extolled at light's demise
By the fallen one I shall arise
Believer
Speak not to me of justice
For none have I have seen
By God I shall give as I receive
Betrayer
Speak not to me at all
You and this world ripped my fucking heart out
Again... and again... and again... <start> I can remember the times
When the grace was
shining on my face
Don't you see don't you feel
those days are gone
They've vanished in the air.
Now I could not care less
of you and your poisoned mind
cos I have already seen
this thousand times
My emotions are hidden
in a place where you can't see
Hate is replacing the dreams
that we once shared
on these frontlines
frontlines of mysteries
Hell yeah
I can remember the love
At some point it became
one with my hate
And I can see how
you are wasting your life
wasting your dignity
The light in my eyes is fading away
But I bleed no tears
cos I know your destiny
My emotions are hidden
in a place where you can't see
Hate is replacing the dreams
that we once shared
on these frontlines
frontlines of mysteries
How blind can you be
Don't you know what I mean
Love divided love divided
Extending agony
Love divided love divided
I hate your empty words
and the grin on your face ah
My emotions are hidden
in a place where you can't see
Hate is replacing the dreams
that we once shared
on these frontlines
frontlines of mysteries
How blind can you be
Don't you know what I mean
Love divided love divided
Extending agony
Love divided love divided
I hate your empty words <start> We stand here in silence
Ten thousand with weapons in hand
Brought out of violence
For freedom I gathered these men
We're riding on the wings of Odin
In glory we believe
A kingdom at war
Forever stand united
A kingdom at war
Together we gain ground
Fight in the war
Steel strikes like lighting
Bodies are twisted in pain
Although it's frightening
Our losses should not be in vain
We're riding on the wings of Odin
In glory we believe
A kingdom at war
Forever stand united
A kingdom at war
Together we gain ground
Just like a shadow we sneak up behind
Don't take no prisoners it's killing time
We're riding on the wings of Odin
In glory we believe
A kingdom at war
Forever stand united
A kingdom at war
Together we gain ground
Fight in the war <start> Something's come over me... I can't bear to see you live
Between lies between sins that bespeak iniquity
I just want to hold your pretty hand
The rest of you can be dissolved in acid
I just want to hold your pretty hand
Purified of their sins fornicators will be purged
Breath of god wind of change
I ride  you will meet your death... whore
I just want to hold your pretty hand
The rest of you can be dissolved in acid

Quisiste con ternura y el amor
te devor de atrs hasta el rion.
Se rieron de tu abrazo y ah noms
Te hundieron con rencor todo el arpn.
Amargo desencuentro

Creste en la honradez y en la moral
que estupidez.
Por eso en tu total fracaso de vivir
ni el tiro del final te va a salir. <start> Rising from the night of time
rising from damnation
growing furtive to old size
a thousand years old nation
Finding victims for their Reich
the lands' got a lot of strangers
they call back the crystal night
to burn the war creation
In a land where neighbours are strangers
and misleaded feel caled for avengers
in a land with bloodcovered history
Then the last man of their kind
finished life in prison
he's a martyr for their aims
started killing seasons
Now they march the insane hords
call the NeoNation
again the right hands risen high
a skinny revelation
In a land where neighbours are strangers
and misleaded feel caled for avengers
in a land with bloodcovered history
Back to the dark
Rising their hands higher
Back into the past
from the night of time
Banned graphitti on the walls
words of hate and murder
waiting for their masters call
back in line and order
In a land where neighbours are strangers
Back to the dark
Rising their hands higher
Back into the past
from the night of time
Back to the dark
Rising their hands higher

Excruciating sickness
the reprisal of your sins
you stand and weep
incurable sides
infecting all parts of your skin
you feeble creep
Severe burns eviscerates you from inside
making you suffer from a bloody tide
Infertile beings
cries out in vain
'til they're insane
as they're bleeding
predictable
it's the way it turns
you can't comprehend
nor understand
the reason why it burns
Severe burns built upon lies of the fear
of your own death bodily incapacity can't take away your breath

Left to die with a body burnt
to god you prayed
nothing gained
only pain you earnt
Severe burns exterminates
causing your deprave
undeniable prophecy only shreds remain <start> You and me we could conquer the world
Cause I'm in love with the child in you girl.
Smiling at me I know that she cares
And my fingers stroking your hair.
And I know this means one thing
I belong to you
Yes I belong to you
Oh
In my mind I'm beside you
And now I know I'll never turn blue.
I want you now here by my side
When you're there with your arms open wide.
Oh I belong to you
I belong to you
I believe it's true
And I belong to you.

I belong to you
Yes I belong to you.
Holding hands beating hearts together
And now we make every day last forever.
I belong to you
You're more precious than life itself and
I belong to you <start> Watching the end of the world
Follow the path to the edge
Endless perishment
Survival of souls unfulfilled
Calling the ghosts' afterlife
Awaiting the end to arrive
Downfall planet earth
Beneath a dying sun
With bleeding hearts
Embedded scars
The dying starts
All of our pain everlasts
Impaled alive
Slowly all dies
The last day will come
Beneath a dying sun
Fading to black in the sky
Ashes and dust kill the light
Countdown world demise
Plunging into endless night
Forever in darkening void
Soulless hearts destroyed
The eve of emptiness
Beneath a dying sun
With bleeding hearts
Embedded scars
The dying starts
All of our pain everlasts
Impaled alive
Slowly all dies
The last day will come
Beneath a dying sun <start> I can feel it in my mind
The real evilness is coming
And we are waiting for it
Possess our pure souls
Those creatures who hate us
Will have their minds drown in the skuggons shadow
Your end is never coming your life will never end
Because your mind will be lost in an eternal suffer
Come on and fill my mortal soul
I will not betray you
Just give me strength to protect our rising DEATH kingdom
After this day will the smell of death remind us
That the mighty dark thing came at last
It will now lead us into the great spirit battle
And my conciousness have I left in my past <start> Rising from mundane existence
A new world seen through your eyes
To deception give no resistance
Your hopes and dreams are now sanctified
Blind to the hypocrisy
Goodness is all that you see
And your past life is cast aside
In false truths you now confide
Pledged to a life of divinity
Superior through your own piety
Holier than thou
Alone you wear the crown
In your private Incomprehensible
Look to what you have become
Condemned to misery and strife
Alone you wear the crown of life
The crown of life
The crown of life <start> Now when I look at him theres no more pain
I could bring. Tell me honey do you like
what youve seen Answer me I dont care if
youre in pain
No more tears are left in your eyes. No more
pain no need to cry. What youve seen with
sewn open eyes will never leave your mind.
Its too late for regret. Are you sorry now
These voices in my head are so loud When I
tighten the ropes in your wrists
dislocate and you finally make a sound.
It is the end of its your time. You will die
for crossing the line For you wont see
tomorrow but Ill be smiling at your
sorrow
I kiss your serrated cheeks for all the joy
youve given me. But we both know that you
wanted to fall or else you wouldve stayed
royal. Have you learnt you learnt your lesson
from seeing your lover on our wall
It is the end of its your time. You will die
for crossing the line For you wont see
tomorrow but Ill be smiling at your
sorrow
This pleasure it overwhelms me and my
fucking brother hangs before us. Now you
have seen all you need to see Ill take your
eyes now theres no more lust here.
This pleasure it overwhelms me and my

eyes now theres no more lust for you to see
It is the end of its your time. You will die
for crossing the line For you wont see
tomorrow but Ill be smiling at your
sorrow <start> The night's an offspring of black dreams
Everything's dark the shades on the walls
Invite me
The memory of my dreams is a distant light
The wind groans the sign of my soul
The night embraces me
You've taken everything away
You've only left an empty snap
And this words that are dead since ages
The could universe
Has sticked to my face
The wishes have died somewhere
I'm only lying in the silence
The hours elapse on
Every memories are taken away by the dimness
My soul's dancing in a redhot fire
I'm flying in the wind far away from the earth <start> Searching for answers about the meaning of life
I can tell you they're harder than kryptonite
You want to get in touch with your inner self
Destroy your principles get rid of all your lies
You can take your stuck up pride with you as you fall to die
No heads down when you take the hit
Your life ain't worth shit
Demons from within turn your heart so cold
You have nothing inside that cage you built around you
You can take your stuck up pride with you as you fall to die
No heads down when you take the hit
Your life ain't worth shit
Don't you ever let anybody in
Totally worthless
You know they'll eat your soul and slit your throat
Don't you ever let anybody in
Kill
You know they'll eat your soul and slit your throat

Kill

NO FIRE NO HEAT NO MORE LIFE AND YOU ARE FREE
Don't you ever let anybody in
Totally worthless
You know they'll eat your soul and slit your throat
Don't you ever let anybody in
Kill
You know they'll eat your soul and slit your throat <start> Alone I stand here I stand waiting
dreams of me erasing all the false words that you spoke.
Regret filled nights finally end.
Sleepless nights finally end.
I'm not forgiving you.
I will never ever forgive you.
Reality is setting in.
It's your mistakes that brought you here.
The things you said they brought me to my knees.
The truth it hurts so fucking much
but it hurts in the end where I am left.
So let's keep this bond as a reminder
a reminder of all the things we fucking had.
Feeling no sympathy feeling no remorse. <start> Squeezing his white banana blue
In your quivering rump
His body lice devour your ass crack <start> Yeah Yeah
Murder death
As I search to analyze reality the true
Meaning of life
Out simple existence means nothing
God has a gun the truth life is a slow noose
He's invincible
Better watch his knife
There is no escape from the slow kill
When it's time to go god serves a death blow
You have no choice don't even try
The only choice is suicide
Surviving the game
No escape
No one's ever escaped
Die <start> Knee deep in sewage
Maggots burrowing through my face
Blinded by disease
Waiting for my living death to end
Slicing teeth
Infectious chewing at my skin
My blood is clotted with pus
The maddening shrill cries
Of rabid vermin never stop
I pick away
At my mouldering flesh
Insanity has left my mind
A tortured mess
Face chewed to bits
On my body they feast
Swimming in the rancid sewage
Spreading their disease <start> Indoctrination far beyond reality manipulations of the human kind.
Now the world has faced control living in the grip of fortune .
I'm learning to be the king of my mind and master of my soul.
Wisdom of magic in my eyes like the Princess of the swords.
Phantom of universe symbolized eternity.
Watching the ashes from their holy sin.
The golden dawn will make the spell
vivid force of Thoth in Crowley's holy grail.
If I ever got exposed my revelation then will soar.
I'm learning to be the king of my mind 
Wisdom of magic in my eyes 
Princess of theswords. <start> Cut off the light
Take a look
There's nothing beyond but pain
Suffer in the deepest void
The flame of hope isgone
What have I done
Denied the father and the sun
For a moment it seemed
There's space beyond the spheres
Aflame the night
So clear and bright
Unstable light
You've been sacrificed in fear
Now there's one thing for sure
I'm not afraid anymore
Day after day we've been fixed in the bowl
For so long
For ages we're captured in shells
And crystallized walls
Predestined or punished
By man or god
I cannot I will not
Deny it's false innocence
I cannot I will not
The age of false innocence
Take it away from me
For a while
Astronomy has moved the earth
And we've turned around the sun
Sanctum officium
Has made me believe
Has made me believe
Has made me believe
We know for sure you're lying
Would you like to mess with holy science
You know the fear of dying
Would it be worth it to hear you crying
I've slaughtered truth
And I've shattered my heart
Far too long I have played with hellfire
And science has turned into madness
But I should have taken it higher
So I feel so I feel
Like Judas must have felt before
That Wednesday night near by the tree
Day after day we will gratefully suffer for more
Predestined's our part
So we Bleed in the name of god
Don't believe in their eternity
We're still held in blindness
And I've been turned into a liar
If there is no heaven
There won't be release
I cannot I will not
Deny it's false innocence
I cannot I will not
The age of false innocence
I cannot I will not
Deny it's false innocence
I cannot I will not
The age of false innocence
Take it away from me <start> Treat me like a princess
Treat me like a goddess treat me like a slave
Make me go insane
Let me dive in your eyes
Let me drown in your smile let me adore your face
Die in your embrace
ouldn't you just own me
Lump in my throat hold me I'm clay in your arms
Halfkilled by your charme
Not for love I'm looking for a proper place to die
In my soul lust is inborn can't smother it though I tried
Not for love is flowing up the fire in my soul
Deep inside screaming wild yearning more and more
I chase hunters to be a prey masters to be a slave
Passions for my blood to be drained
For my sweat to run for my skin to burn
Too much won't be enough
Shivering for your scent
Melting down in your hands you can torture me
Anyway you please
Let me caress your lips
Then kiss your fingertips get down on my knees
Crawling at your feet
Make me beg to have you
Rape me 'till I cry blood tie me to a bed
Swear you'll die for me
Not for love I'm looking for a proper place to die
In my soul lust is inborn can't smother it though I tried
Not for love is flowing up the fire in my soul
Deep inside screaming wild yearning more and more
I chase hunters to be a prey masters to be a slave
Passions for my blood to be drained
For my sweat to run for my skin to burn
Too much won't be enough
Heaven dwelling in my hands
Pleasure giver pain receiver
Heaven sneaking on your skin
Feel for me
I chase hunters to be a prey masters to be a slave
Passions for my blood to be drained
For my sweat to run for my skin to burn
Too much won't be enough <start> I slept last night with the wolves of longing
Awoke to find a new morning
I know it's mine
Though you left no sign
My strange companion
I don't know where you're coming from
Strange companion
Have you been there all along
Last night's child was weak and angry
Last night's child just woke up hungry
Did you come along
To right this wrong
Strange companion
Do you know what I'm hiding from
Strange companion
Have you known me all along
I am not the only one that wants you
I am not the only on that wants to
Break the surface of this deepest ocean
Break the silence set the world in motion
You showed me how
It's alright now
Strange companion
I don't know where you're coming from
Strange companion
Have you been there all along <start> WELCOME TO MY WORLD  SO COLD AND DARK
BUT EVEN COLDER AND DARKER IS MY BLACKENED HEART
AND LIKE EVEREY NIGHT  WELL PLAY THE GAME AGAIN
YOU WILL RUNN AND I WILL HUNT YOU TO THE TUNNELS END
IM BOUND TO YOUR BODY  A SHADOW CAST BY LIGHT
BUT I WILL BE UNLEASHED IN THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT
WE TURN TO NIGHTMARES  WHEN YOU SLEEP
WELCOME THE DAWN WELCOME TO THE SHADOWKEEP
WE ARE ALWAYS WATCHING  ALWAYS THERE
ALWAYS FOLLOWING  NOBODY CARES
BOUND TO EVERY MOTION  EVERY MOVE YOU DO
BUT WHEN TH SUN SETS  WE WILL CONTROL YOU
WE ARE THE MASTERS OF THE DARKNESS
WE ARE CREATORS OF YOUR DREAMS
WE ARE THE BRINGERS OF YOUR NIGHTMARES
IN THIS FORTRESS THERE IS NOTHING AS IT SEEMS
MAYBE THIS NIGHT YOU WILL BE FASTER
MAYBE YOULL MAKE IT TO THE TUNNELS END
BUT IF YOU WONT ESCAPE TILL SUNRISE
YOU WILL NEVER SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY AGAIN <start> Well I'm wonderin' when we'll meet again
Will it be tonight tomorrow I gotta know when
I now know we'll never see each other
Cause I know you're having an affair with my brother
No

Paperback Love

I gotta Paperback Love <start> Look the herons in the green billed water
Their wetash wings wear medallions of patience
We drift on
We have stories as old as the great seas
Break through the chest
Flying out the mouth
Noisy tongues that once were silenced
All the oceans we contain coming to light
All the dark birds rush from the river
Leaving only the stillness of their language
There are no clocks to measure time
But the beating of our single hearts
You will know it is winter
By the way your dreams tremble like stones
When the wind comes through
The wind full of hearts that beat quick and strong <start> Within a mechanical pose
And a heart pumping a need for control
Forced to fit inside a mold
Living to dehumanize is gonna take its toll
Take it in
And let it saturate
Under the skin
Until you can't even
Remember when
You first felt the sinking
Feeling that
Something's missing you
Traded for a gun
Did we inflate your sense of pride
And did it feed your lust for power
When you threw us to the ground
You took what's ours and sold it back
Another day another dollar for this town
Your uniform made a perfect burial suit <start> Sanctity have you succumbed to
The twisted words of devotion
Convoluted allure and bloodshed
This union falls held together by surmise
Show me the way of this golden path
So real
I fear nothing
Your threats of damnation now bury your sense of strength
In defiance of sanctity
I stand against you all
Desolate so truthless
Blindly following your doubts
Your lies entrapment of life
Desolate so truthless
Blindly following your doubts
Your lies entrapment of life
I fear nothing
Your threats of damnation now bury your sense of strength
In defiance of sanctity
I stand against you all
In defiance this resistance you can never overcome
In defiance of sanctity
Forgiveness will not be shown <start> Music S. Drover G. Drover

Theme  Glen
Tormented mind  a weakened pagan
The tarnished halo  of dripping blood
Through unspeakable acts   final shot at glory
The sickening truth shall never set you free
Justified through the book of faith
Without remorse  may you burn in fire
Twisted morality
Twisted morality
 now perished does this bring you closer to god
Now how can you be blamed
The rebel angel  he is the  to blame
His forceful tactics  are now my saving grace
Justified through the book of faith
Without remorse  may you burn in fire
Twisted Morality
Twisted morality

Justified through the book of faith
Without remorse  may you burn in fire
Twisted morality
Twisted morality
 hand on the book  the other blocking gasping breathe
Beyond sickness  you are the  to blame
For this you need  to perish in the lake of fire
Drawn and quartered  in bloodsoaked ashes may you burn
Twisted morality
Twisted morality <start> Sealing light
Nothing to see
Like a miracle life
Starts with the pain
Forever this will be
Close my eyes
Thunders won't cease
Crawling down to the edge
I break down and weep
Tears on the river deep
Oh Back to the sea
Shout loud
Moving ahead
Ride the horses of justice
Virtues of men yawns
Down and out
Losing my head
Like a dream you're returning
Back from the deadawake
Shadows will fade some day
All the heroes go down
Shed their blood on the land
Dreaming somehow
The divine will now stand
Heroes go down
With their hearts in their hands
Building their castles on the sand <start> I see your face in a masquerade
I see your made up smile
When the show is over what is left behind
Its in your eyes its in your hair
How come they say opposites attract
When all you feel is a struggle deep inside
Don't tell no lies no more disguise
I'm tracing the matrix of my life
The damage is done you don't belong
Deep down in the matrix
I'm feeling pushed from left to right
Is this the way it's meant to be
Is my destiny crawling on my knees
Now who is right And who is wrong
Who is the one that won't belong
Who's for real And who's just pretending to be
Don't tell no lies no more disguise
I'm tracing the matrix of my life
The damage is done you don't belong
Deep down in the matrix
No more lies no more disguise
Into the matrix

No more lies no disguise
I'm tracing the matrix
No more...
lies no more disguise
I'm tracing the matrix of my life
The damage is done you don't belong
Deep down in the matrix
No more lies no disguise
Tracing the matrix of my life
The damage is done you don't belong
Deep down in the matrix
Into the matrix <start> Can it be more darker
Darker than your blackest mind
Can i or can it be seen
From the long distant far
Deep down in the void of soul
Soul cries for feed its hunger
Nothing nothing more it needs
Only the way to the darkest relief
Discourage...
Way of no belief...
All is useless...
Without the control  <start> Our time has ended
I feel it's only just begun
And I'm frustrated
I can't believe you're not the one
My ears are bleeding
Her voice resides inside my head
And now I'm choking

Will I just fall to pieces
Or am I alright
To iron out my creases
You must lacerate me till they're done
These are my final words to you
I know you're listening can you hear me
The time has come to say 'goodbye'
These are my final words to you
The clock is ticking
My heart is bursting through my chest
And now I'm crying

The chair is creaking
Her voice resides inside my head
And now it's over

Will I just fall to pieces
Or am I alright
To iron out my creases
You must lacerate me till they're done
These are my final words to you
I know you're listening can you hear me
The time has come to say 'goodbye'
These are my final words to you
Heaven where is my angel
I need her now 
Heaven where is my angel
I need her now
Holding me
Tonight
Will I just fall to pieces
Or am I alright
To iron out my creases
You must lacerate me till they're done
These are my final words to you
I know you're listening can you hear me
The time has come to say 'goodbye'
These are my final words to you <start> These are not  they are going by ear.
Never
underestimate
your next opponent.
It will be a dark
catastrophe of great proportion
The challenge has begun
when the hammer falls I know that we will all step forward in a rush
Domination by the masses
Kicking you down beating you down
WE WON'T FALTER.
Beating you down push you away
They can't deny your destiny.
WE WON'T FORGET
Believing in a power they make their walls collide and falsify your  and your opponent will be living in failure failure. Failure failure.
Taste the potent stench of pride
The people scream in horror.
For the reign effect is in full play
but it's then the public scream your way
the people all will applaud.
Applaud your demise
Break down the opponent that you must fear.
You can't take the burning.
Don't ever deny the power within
You can defeat all that oppose
Feel
my
hatred
Eyes burning red.
Radiation.
Of our anger.
We will flourish
As they fall we will flourish
RISE AND OPPOSE <start> Langtder borte i mrket
Gjennom tretopper der mnelys driver
Langtder borte i all tke
Inn gjennom min sjel den sorte angst river
P de mosegrodde steiner de seg viser
Nr nattemrket har senket seg over
Ekkoenefra deres grufulle jamring
Endelstdu kan hre
I horisonten langt vekk
Skimtes den sigende skodde
Horder av ild rider mnelyset i flokk
Ved daggry de samles ved en bortgjemt odde
Den iskalde snoen
Har kommet
Denne gang
I evig fokk <start> You'll be running out of miracles
Like I'm running out of dreams
Madness lurking to my left
Angels faint in front of me
And I see eyes to the right
I hear a promise resound
Gold and diamonds love and fame
And music meant to remain
You've been dying for glory
You've looking for love
Why don't we read the signs
When we're about to get lost
A seeker enthralled by a flame
Eventually home to his pain
The Great Unbeloved
You reach for the final stage
Hey man in your hideaway
Where do we go from here
Heroes in a tragedy
Downhome just a memory
Where do we go
When the world is in the way
Way down to the hideaway
Afflatus Divine Your hands
And a wicked symphony
Hey now to the hideaway
lock up the rain for a wicked symphony
Don't you give up on your emotions
Don't you abandon your despair
If you deny what you desire
This would been just a mystery play
There'll be nowhere to go
Just oblivion we're so close to reach out
Close to fall make up or break up or crawl
You're striving for beauty
For a song to remain
A final touch and the spirit you have cited
Hold on to the reins
I feel how I'm losing my ground
A dancer enthralled by a sound
The smoke clears away
I'll reach for the final stage
Hey man in your hideaway
Where do we go from here
Heroes in a tragedy
Downhome just a memory
Where do we go
When the world is in the way
Way down to the hideaway
Afflatus Divine Your hands
And a wicked symphony
Hey now to the hideaway
lock up the rain for a wicked symphony
Oh I can hear it I can hear it
Oh I can hear it I I I I...
I can hear it yeah
I'm dying for a sign
You can turn your face away
Can pretend you don't hear it
How long have you been begging on your knees
And now that you're near it
Won't you be damned if you defy what you're given
Mercury of salvation
The colors for the eyes of the world
We'll be kings for generations
Hey man in your hideaway
Where do we go from here
Heroes in a tragedy
Downhome just a memory
Where do we go
When the world is in the way
Way down to the hideaway
Afflatus Divine Your hands
And a wicked symphony
Hey now to the hideaway
lock up the rain for a wicked symphony <start> The air stirs up the galaxy
Be.........
The crosswinds of forever become me and place me on
The porch of the breeze
Without my sounds would be silent
No gullible gusts through the trees
Carrying seasons to bring us
The atmosphere we all can enjoy and we destroy
The blur on the horizon disturbs me
It casts a disguise on the sun
In the end it's the wind that will weaken
And the human goes from billions to none
The wind will regain all its motion
And clear the air for the following to...
 The breeze of a new creation
Moving clouds from everywhere
Sensing a rainy stare
Smelling the moisture in the air
In the air.
The weather can be deemed as deceiving
To predict the unpredictability
The passion that it peels for the ocean
Air and water sharing laughter
A bond between two forces of nature
All to live and breathe
The breeze of a new creation
Breathe
The breeze of a new creation. <start> Alone since I was born
Cold limbs turned against me
Take a part in my misery
Silence causes me pain
Please alleviate my loneliness
Be the one who never betrays me
Is Heaven a goddamn freakshow
Hell can't be more horrifying
Let the end come and set me free
I smell blood in the air
Death is waiting with open arms
Come to me fill my body
Let Devil in  Devil's in
Let the Devil fill my damn body
Let Devil in  Devil's in
Yeah let him come to me
Don't forget there's no way back
A new star on the sky is shining
Let the end come and set me free
I smell blood in the air
Death is waiting with open arms
Come to me fill my body <start> We hit the floor with little certainty then truth ended with more
Outlining all the ways of which to be
But no longer the scenery we hoped for has taken over air...and now more than ever you'll find out
Why I try to fight these changes battling me I choose these chains inside just imploding slowing the sound
I eat this alive for the sake of breaking teeth
Resist within where true hearts ignite engage within fight to hold hearts high
With nothing left I aim on anything to give me a repeat
The lack of faith and hope and the between
But it's endless the fight that's never ending and the body full of heart
Back it in the corner watch it tear this apart
From limb to limb it strikes on anything that makes itself the enemy...survive
Slowing the sound I eat at this alive for the sake of breaking teeth
Resist within where true hearts ignite engage within fight to hold hearts high
We are the ones the tried and true
We are the chosen few
Embrace the rage you hold inside
Burst from the flames reclaim the heist...we won't fall
Resist the end where true hearts ignite engage within fight to hold hearts high
We stand we stand the tried and true
We stand we stand the chosen few
We will find a way we will find a way we will find a way we will find a way <start> Lead vocals Eduardo Marques

Betrayal in the Coast of Raven
This journey has no return
Betrayal in the Coast of Raven

I want to know
Why did he tell
Before we go

In the Greyhawk tavern he lost his mind
Liar
His greed will change our lives

About Fellstrought
Our time is out
We have to go
Solo 
Betrayal in the Coast of Raven
This journey has no return
Betrayal in the Coast of Raven
We will never break the oath
Forgive me my king
Tell me your sin
I've failed with my faith
Join us in this crusade <start> I've been trying to deny it
Oh what to do
When I'm such a fool for you
I want you
So bad I want you
I want to hold you babe you look away what did I say
I want you
For better or for worse
I will make you mine
Each warm heart gets cold in time
I'll follow like a shadow
You won't get through
The web I have spun for you
I want you
So bad I want you
I want to hold you babe you look away what did I say
I want you
So bad I want you
I watch each step you take I will not bend I will not break
I want you bad
I want your innocence
I want your bitterness your loneliness
I want you 
I want you bad
I want your innocence
I want your every breath in life or death I want you
No one could see it coming
A tragic day 
How did that car get in your way
I got you
At last I got you
She'll never see your face forever bound in my embrace
I got you
At last I got you
She'll never send you thrills if I can't have you no one will <start> The process of revolution has already littered
The streets of Leningrad
The indivisible masses have been victimized
By the pages of their own history
What they held in their hands slipped through their fingers
And into the grip of the common threat
The wall they allow to be built around them
Segregates by hope and nullifies their dream
Inseverable by principal consolidated under common banner
The failure of emancipation torn apart by their creation
A people who's self determination was the kingpin
To their so called liberation stand blindsided by misconception
Nullified revolution emancipation deception <start> I'm just a word in your verse. My longing that hides behind my thoughts breaks me.
I only live in your poem as written in grief. I'm just a memory. Another forgotten. Left
to tears. To go through this moments never again. You made me feel this way Without
your embrace I'm left to loneliness. Forgotten in cold. Why don't your eyes fill me
with warmth anymore. Heartlessness between us. Memories crashing against my heart.
Could I have my kisses back from you. Your distance will never end. To look at you makes me feel this way. My memories
will die 'cause you're no longer within me. Love is my death. <start> They never see nothing but debris
They never hear news without a fear
They never understand the game the sense the plan
They never feel injuries that heal
Proud to die for faith
Fanatic Agitators Deceive
New breed of man
Grew up in war
New breen of man
Like never before
They never see religions agree
They never understand count the days on one hand <start> Cleanse thine eyes let truth appear
The world is deceived judgment is near
Mankind is fallen believed the lies
Confused and have not seen the evil in his eyes
Ravished they are by the beauty of this form
Enslaved and can not see the chaos of the storm
Root of all evil has grabbed the human race
Saying I don't care for others I am God myself
Millions in suffering billions of tears
This world is secured for how many years
Mist of the Spiritual Dimension
Satan has cursed thy mind
Awake abandon mortal sin
Truth thou shall find
Dwell in the light of the Saviour
Bathe in the Blood of the Lamb
Sword of Thy mouth shall beat the evil flesh
Evil destroyed by Thy return in brightness
Total annihilation damnation fell to dust
War of Armageddon obliteration is a must
King of kings the earth tremble for Thy might
Thy coming seen by every eye our most awaited sight
No one shall stand at that day we will be on our knees
Eternal kingdom comes without hatred or decease
The dawning of forever darkness is no more
By the holy blood of Jesus we won the final war <start> RondatParry
Hiding in fear
Such abnormality
Close your eyes now say a prayer
Memories a punishment so real
They played their cold and isolated games
Games that wicked children played
They made you feel afraid
Paralysed a child's imagination
Lost
You're caught inside a spell
Subconsciously afraid
The answer lies behind the tears
Fight
Don't hide away you're strong
Enough to face the truth
Which hides behind behind the tears
Reality it comes in shapes and forms
Concentration chase those fears away
Thought a power the power to be free
Think positive the pain will disappear <start> fiend
What up out there kenfo

I'm so high I can ride barely need to slug some dealing
No optimos no keep moving fuck it pass the feeling

But if I do I'll grab my gun shoot like and pull let em know
Chorus x

And pop my shots clean up your block
Red beam maintain my aim bullet holes in your brain

Usual suspect down south niggas bout respect
Choppin off slugs like a mailman in a corvette

Chorus x

And my enemies we take it to the street
To get the green knowa mean
Came here with slim mac and fiend

Runnin from the cop who was trying to meet his quota
I'm young and I'm black I'm a soldier
So he thinking I'm slanging that baking soda
You ain't heard about nigga from that dirty south

Grab your gat with that extra clip cause if you catch us slippin

Shots there cut up strip bout a couple of ship

Lets take a trip to the land where the niggas
Do the murderman dance on their enemies
And fake niggas pretend to be a they be them friends of me
Woah slow your roll and daddy I'm camoflauged

Chorus x

A soldier without a pause

My bullet scars didn't heal my tatoos reveal
Bout to ride explain a million of hostile
The burn feels like almost a step from death
Fuck spending lives I barely leave a minute of breath
I'm set families with teks release my stress in their chest
Wouldn't know where I'd be without my God and my vest
Killers we the best fuck all the rest here hit the cess
Snort c'mon the test
With the charge the best cause I open your chest
God bless I made my way back so I can say that
Me too whatever should have known that fiend believe in payback
Do it for haystacks me slim twins and mac
Gotta attack with the jest to ask deftly in the act
I doubt that I'm strange cause I'm with the right change
After soldier consediration I'm the live range
Chorus x <start> When I asked myself the other day I came to realise I'm not ok
I've burned my fingers bad before I've seen myself through worse I'm sure
But just the same I'm really not ok
Oh how I wish that I could sleep
I try but won't just sink that deep
My fingers won't stop aching so tired yet awaken
Or should I let it all loose and just weep
I've been pacing up and down my floors I have lost all sense of time
I sometimes halt and ask myself if I'm about to loose my mind
All in all I know
From when I get up way past lunch time I keep on asking myself
If when the night falls hard on all I'm up to pace around again
All in all I know <start> Your piss is going sour... my mouth is full for the last time.
Don't think I don't read the gossip
don't think I don't know what's coming out of your fucking mouth.
You're broken and I'm laughing you're brokengo drink your life away.
Go fuck your life away with your filthy std's and your fucking night of rape.
Just go jerk off on your fucking stomach impregnate yourself.
You're born again just like you've always been.
Every fucking year... this year you abort yourselfget the fuck out of my life.
Never come back I don't ever need you around.
What we shared means shit to you.
Laugh at me all you want but I'm living what you once wanted.
And I'm happy... happy to be alive with real friend who don't spit in my face.
Real friends don't end friendship with change.
It's really hard to realize that you've stooped so low.
I've given chances I've tried to mend... but it's all over now I move on.
I piss in your mouth now so don't ever talk to me again.
Tonight I will sleep well.
Tonight I realize that I will move on.
Tonight I hope your bed catches flame.
Tonight I kill your fucking face.
I killed your face. <start> Faceless coward  slithering  the depths a mind can take
Blackened heart  alerting masses  a plan  the world to shake
Now no one will ever be the same
How could we have ever known No prediction to have known
Will and honour  now be shown
Standing unified  the nations will collide
Vengeance will be swift  we pray for your demise
The city begins to shake  behold the blackened sky
Unsuspecting people watch  can't believe their eyes
Terror unfolds  who to despise
How could we have ever known No prediction to have known
Will and honour  now be shown
We never will forgive  interrupt the way we live
Teach your people how to hate  run and hide but it's too late
Solo
There is no place to hide  in time we'll hunt you down
The coward flees for life  our nations are abound
We will not stop until you're found
Standing unified  the nations will collide
Vengeance will be swift  we pray for your demise <start> I feel the shivers running down my spine it wakes the powers of my
Undivine.
My mind betrays me I'm leaping back in time.
All those memories left behind In the torture chamber where I lived to be
All my purity is left in greed. Can't take control my ego burns me out
Everything seems so faded now.
Chorus
I've seen it believed it but deep inside I know that something is wrong.
I've been it I've lived it but now I know  my schizophrenia is gone.
Feels like I'm trapped between two worlds the doors are locked in either
Ways I can hear my echo but there are no walls.
A sick brain in a tortured host.
Chorus
I've seen it believed it but deep inside I know that something is wrong.
I've been it I've lived it but now I know  my schizophrenia is gone. <start> There was a time when they were strong we were living in the dark.
They thought that we wouldn't know but our visions will never die.
We were just going on and on in a haze full of lies.
With sorrow and cold despair living in a masquerade.
We're standing together watching all the world.
We're living forever this is the time and they should know.
We are the force of the world and the legends all for one
and we're all going on and on standing up strong.
Now is the time when we are strong and the night has turned to dawn.
No madness no rage at all try us you'll see that
We're standing together watching all the world.
We're living forever this is the time and they should know. <start> Komm zu mir 
Schenk mir dein Fleisch
Reich es mir 
Dies sei dein Opfer
Stirb fr mich 
Dein Tod ist mein Plsir
Schreie laut 
Dein Leid mein Hochgenu
Hute dich 
Deine Haut so blutig rot
Schenk sie mir  an einem Stck...
Ihr Geschmack so reif und zart
Rei heraus das Herz
La seinen Schlag verstummen
Schtte aus dein Blut
Kotz' dir die Seele raus
La das Leben aus dir flieen
Ich nehm' es in mir auf
Mein Dank wird dir gebhren
Ein neues Leben schenk' ich dir
Ich werde dich belohnen
Gebe dir Unsterblichkeit
Deine Hlle  aus Fleisch...
Trgt nur kurz ihr Schmerzenskleid
Stich dir aus die Augen
La sie blutend gehen
Wenn ich dich mit mir nehme
Wirst du durch meine Augen sehen
Mein Reich komme
Mein Wille geschehe
Du wirst der erste sein
Und alle werden  folgen...
Mein Reich komme
Mein Wille geschehe
Ich gebe euch Unsterblichkeit
Zu dienen ist der Preis...
Wie habt ihr mich herbeigesehnt...
Seid Anbeginn der Zeit
Nun endlich bin ich ganz bei euch
Fr alle Ewigkeit
Mein Reich entsteht aus eurer Welt
Auf den Ruinen aller Seelen
Ich nehme euch die Farben fort 
Und schenke Finsternis dafr... <start> Long time no see I'm doing fine
Yeah thank you
That's nice you look great don't wanna know
What I go through
Hard times much pain you will never know
No one ever does
I stay cool will act tough I'll smile along
For you 'cause
Nothing's wrong....except for me falling apart
Nothing's wrong....it's tearing pieces of my heart
Nothing's wrong....except for me falling apart
Nothing's wrong....but I fell down right from the start
Let's laugh let's drink let's just pretend
That I feel good
But at night it gets to me hits me like
A piece of hardwood
It's wrong I feel fucked can't play the clown
No more no
I quit find help I'm getting out of
My own freakshow
Nothing's wrong....except for me falling apart
Nothing's wrong....it's tearing pieces of my heart
Nothing's wrong....except for me falling apart
Nothing's wrong....but I fell down right from the start
Big boy is calling out for help
Big boy is calling out for help
Join my journey
Come on take a ride
Walk with me through the valley of fear
Nothing's wrong I'm doing fine
Nothing's wrong nothing is.... <start> One silver cloud collapsed below the glow of a harvest fullmoon.
'Cause we're here to make an oath
and we'll raise our realm in a sky of maroon.
Our stratosphere turned dark however
the Western winds never stopped blowing.
All deceiving religions fall we'll gonna close our hands
and make our own way.
Ignite the wroth flames 
 fires to the sky
Before the violence
We stand before the most wild beast.
We'll rape the peace.
Once again
We summon you
To join us all
Standing upon the sand of the shores
was a Queen with a crown of  stars.
She worships the dragon above
which exalts impiety in that wild beast.
Our father is here with us and we'll summon you to join us.
If we're bonded by jewels and blood on our fists
then we hail you within kingdoms of mist.
Gorias 
Finias 
The winter zephyr warps the power of Sessair <start> The nothingness of life
Plunged into eternal darkness
An animal at bay words cannot convey
All is bathed in gray
A cold winds blow it's touch and go
If wishes were horses then beggars would ride
A torrid time a strange design
Come hell or high water come be the guide
I am here down the ages
The road in deep despair
I'm solitaire
The diamond in your chain
The beacon fire in endless strain
The diamond in your chain
Is there a ghost of chance
Here on this road to Damascus
The sun of eventide temptations misguide
The agony inside
Crash and burn at every turn
Helplessly losing perception of time
A friendly card a strange regard
Searching for reason and seeking for rhyme
I am here down the ages
The road in deep despair
I'm solitaire
The diamond in your chain
The beacon fire in endless strain
The diamond in your chain
I am here down the ages
The road in deep despair
I'm solitaire
The diamond in your chain
The beacon fire in endless strain
The diamond in your chain
Pylon in the rain
Beacon in the strain
Pylon in the rain
Diamond in the chain
Pylon in the rain
Beacon in the strain
Pylon in the rain
Diamond in the chain
I'm solitaire I'm solitaire
Solitaire I'm solitaire woooooh
Diamond in your chain <start> Leading in a dark embrace
I look to your tormented face
You want to stand in my stead
Your pain is not for me
You will fall
Down the cross
Demise of the crown
I'm your thorn
Praise me
I am first who'll kill your sacrifice
Praise me
You welcome death with open arms
Lead LES
Blood runs like a rain to inundate your pain
You are masochist You're suffering from my sins
I'm tread upon your flesh
To hear your silence breath
I see you feeble creep
Your pain will never be for me
You will fall
Down the cross
Demise of the crown
I'm your thorn
Praise me
I am first who'll kill your sacrifice
Praise me
You welcome death with open arms
Lead BART
Praise me <start> As I look toward the sky and think of days gone past
Lucifer  he enter my mind
born leaders of the quest and his name is 
LUCIFER ...  <start> Don't tell me how strong you are
When emotions for you
Is a feeling
You can describe in two words
Don't look at me with closed eyes
As closed like a black hole
The black hole in you
Is the black hole in me
Don't tell me how strong you are
When emotions for you
Is a feeling
You can describe in two words
Don't look at me with closed eyes
As closed like a black hole
The black hole in you
Is the black hole in me
Look in the mirror
And feel what you see
Don't close your eyes
And you want to be free
Inside yourself
There's a way we can hide
In an inhibited society
You always collide
Don't tell me how strong you are
As strong like a child
A child with no dreams
Don't dream a dream
When you hope to wake up in time
In time you will learn
Don't tell me how strong you are
As strong like a child
A child with no dreams
Don't dream a dream
When you hope to wake up in time
In time you will learn
Look in the mirror
And feel what you see
Don't close your eyes
And you want to be free
Inside yourself
There's a way we can hide
In an inhibited society
You always collide
Look in the mirror
And feel what you see
Don't close your eyes
And you want to be free
Inside yourself
There's a way we can hide
In an inhibited society
You always collide <start> Through man's existance from the start of time
The fight for survival is our only crime
Those in power rotten to the core
The ongoing battle of the eternal war
What are you fighting for Is it worth dying for
You're held down by your chains there's noone but you to
blame
Fighting destroying following blind
Crushing corrupting enslaving mankind
What's now left  you can't believe
Oppression those in power send to deceive
Slave to hatred peace they deplore
Driven by despair eternal war <start> Master order  ever watchful the eye
Unrelenting all directions all times
Master order  doing what it does best to survive
Unrelenting human coal keeping it alive
Two of them are about me they smell like outside 
I must be lying on the floor so huge they appear to be
One eye still working I blink it and they see
Faces blackened out by cloaks but I know they see
A draft not felt in so long
Awakens senses dormant eternal
Coldest air upon naked nerves
Machines pity not even those most wretched
One has a gourd in grasp with water it is filled
The other holds a cask scenting of broth Obey to live obey they command
Life of pain breathing death choking fear  thundering  nothing remains
Agony for the heretic total loss  tempest beseiged  nothing gained
My throat too dry to respond
Somehow they know this and place a cold device on my temple one that speaks
thoughts
There is no emotion  no lying no hiding no escape
All directions all times forever
Humanity is the weakest link in the chain
Broken at long last
Garble comes out at first then halfwords...
then random words muffled sounding then Obey to live obey kill me <start> You cry as if there's something something wrong with you.
You cry as if there's something I can do to you.
I want to go back to when things were just a dream.
When I was satisfied. <start> Transforming into Mobed
For pleasure of mind body and soul
For all gods
You'll see the light
Shapeless fire of knowledge which
Whirl and clamour again and again
Standing on the shoulders
Horseback painted in gold
The child wielding the bow
Shod in flames
So let's rise our hands
And free our minds
So let's plunge into nihil into Nuit
Where children of sun and moon
Shine upon our earthly consciousness
Evil against good
Aryman versus Ahura
Soul united with Daina
All parts swimming across macrocosm
Decomposition of our being
Into different dimensions <start> I am commander I ride the helm
Armored defenders of the realm
I've sworn allegiance to land and King
I've downed rebellions where they may spring
There is not one thing I wouldn't give
My horse my sword my right to live
Hail to the throne  the Crown Of Thorns
I am protectorate law of the land
I rally forces at my command
I am AVENGER I rule the night
Holy Crusader destined to fight
All subjects here loyal to the land
Are consecrated blessed by my hand
A power throne  the Crown Of Thorns
I give my life if my liege decrees
There's no reprieve there are no guarantees
Heirs to the throne that I have scorned
I've sacrificed for the Crown Of Thorns
And I'll claim it now
These bloodstained streets announce a new reign
One just as just I've claimed my domain
Escaped victorious by my hand
Fully responsible for this land
I take the princess now as my bride
Bring out the stallions ready to ride
Detractors nailed to the crucifix
Their bodied burned on the river Styx
Sent stright to hell
All hail the throne
This is my kingdom
All hail the crown <start> No not 'Alison Hell' part 
Yes another gloomy subject
Yet another true story
This is about an unfortunate young girl
Who was locked in a room for
Half a decade just for looking at a boy in a grocery store
Her guardian also her grandmother
Felt that the only way she could protect her granddaughter
From the 'evils and temptations' in the world was to confine her to her room 'Till eternity.'
There is however a rather happy end to all this when
During the middle of the song
The policesocial workers storm the house and
Free the girl from her mental physical captivity.
She is now on the bright
Road to recovery whilst Nanny finds her new home in the sanitarium.
PS Clare is a doll
My room is full of toys and things
But filled with nothing new
Just me and Clare alone in this
Enchanted placid room
It's Saturday and no more school
There hasn't been for years
She says we're here forever
Till eternity
Our solitude has been disturbed
Clare hold on don't flee
With open arms they call my name
Oh won't you come with me
Get back back
Just leave us all alone
Take that and that
I'll break your every bone
Get back back
Just leave us all alone
Take that and that
I'll break your every bone
Blacking out poisoned
Colours now decay
Drifting off to never Neverland
Please don't take me away
To never Neverland
No to the Neverland
Time has passed and now I see
What I've lived through
I've got no fears that match the hate
That came from you
It's Saturday I've things to do
I wish you all the best
Now I leave your placid room

what's worth when a skewed view is all I've held

they've said once and time again
how life is in some master plan
but dreams still speak of death
and life still rots of yesterdays left
cauterized  the part of me manned lust for life
beheaded  the life inside once drove the man alive
inside the faulting dusted hide

so here I voice a void of spending useless word
and here I lie among  alone  in waste
torn from the hands of giving men
the rest are born to take and waste our life
the arch does break and fallen are we who dared
to breach the shells of selfdeceit and flee the call  subjective retreat

Every time you trample across my peaceful mind
Flailing freely want me to let it slide yeah
How you hurt her went so far beyond the wrong
I'll burn you down to cinders ashes now you're gone yeah
And the scars you left behind
Slowly fade away with time
Ashes of what used to be
Now they tore you on to me
Begging mercy shifting playing on both sides
Cut your own throat open and ask me how you died yeah
What was once respect has slowly headed south
Memory forces echoes better in my mouth yeah
And the scars you left behind
Slowly fade away with time
Ashes of what used to be
Now they tore you on to me
Ashes to ashes dust to dust
Ashes to ashes dust to dust
Well I have no respect left for what you're about
And sympathy won't come from me
Erase everything that you once could have been
Destruction of your dignity
I scatter your ashes into the wind
Regret is too short now you're free
Leave here in shame doomed to fulfill
Your pathetic destiny
And the scars you left behind
Slowly fade away with time
Ashes of what used to be
Now they tore you on to me
Ashes to ashes dust to dust

I just want you to know this
My eyes will be set on you
Because you are my game today
I know your face know the life you live
I know enough let your fears ride on free
I'll bring you down soon you'll know
You cannot hide cause I know where you are
I read the fear in your eyes
Just like an open book
I'll find a way to take back what is mine
I'll be your foe and I will fight
Just like a loaded gun
Revenge is all mine
I just want you to know this
Cause life ain't a game no more
Lightning is waiting to strike <start> I am a part of the darkness
Used to watch from afar
Sensing the violence of morning
And breathingand waiting for nothing
Devouring the spirit grinding the heart
There are good things in the burning fields
There's peace in the slaughtered flesh
There's life in the frozen seeds
I'll dream in the deserts
And comfort the thirst for seeing
The violet dawn in the distance
Beckons me to steal its light
I'll wait for you here
I'll wait for you here
I'll wait for you here
I'll wait for you here <start> Break this shit down

Strapped with rage got no patience for victims
Sick and tired of the whole fuckin' world
I don't remember asking you about your imperfections
You might win one battle

Should've left it all alone
Strapped with rage got no patience for victims
Sick and tired of the whole fuckin' world

Zip your lip you've run out of time
Step to me step to me anyone
Talk the talk now walk the damn line
Step to me step to me motherfucker
Shut your face it's your turn to die
Step to me step to me motherfucker
Talk the shit your ass is mine
I don't remember asking you about your imperfections
You might win one battle
But know this I'll win the fucking war <start> Featuring Scarface

Who am I Scar mother fucking face
Who am I A to the mother fucking K
Who am I Belo mother fucking Zero
Who am I Niggas Ain't Ready to Die

Who the fuck am I
A born killer with no conscience
Leaving niggas with holes in their heads unconscience
No second chances
'cause in this game no one advances
You made your move and fucked up now the devil dances
No scrilla for this just murderers with blocks
To run up on their dick and hit em and get em hot
With a  slug pointed at your nose
Left a bloody mess and a note stuck between your toes
You fuck with me nigga you're fucking with the warrior
Anybody destroying you're packing the sig sauer
Putting niggas off in body bags 'cause in this game you take no prisoners
Leave it in blood Hare Krishna
Nobody's breathing niggas stuck on getting even
You die this evening insanity gon be my reason
I trail niggas fill niggas and kill niggas
I introduce the ways that are wicked to real niggas


Who ever epitomise
And idolise my murderous skills
With this vivid imagination and slugs that kill
Off in the zone unorthodox with the world on blocks
It's unexplainable how I got these bitch niggas locked
Keep my eyes on my safe and keep this murderous flavour
Since I picked up a strap I've had this murderous behaviour
Spread the whole clip around and get the fuck outta Dodge
I got a ride full of straps in my homies backyard
It's too cold to proceed without a block to start
Watch a gat blows him apart as the bullets depart
Now who the fuck am I Is the question you ask
Can't be touched or fucked with is all you need to know
It's  plus you bitches got to go
And y'all cain't fuck with me and tell em why
My adrenaline rush on jump
Plus you got my arm beneath grabbing with the double barrel pump


I hear some niggas talking loud like we been stealing this shit
Just say you hate me cock the bullshit don't you grip on my dick
It's Belo Zero mother fuckers same sick ass nut
Drink a brew and smoke some weed and blow your bitch ass up
I put in work so recognise I carry my shit on my chest
More respect and I neglect to come up back with the vest
I never seen a thousand soldiers hit the dirt on your roll
Fuck your chief and all the soldiers I'm a king on my own
I'm coming with force down with Big Chief nigga Rapalot style
Grip sixteens and triple beams will leave that ass on the pile
Walk on down and see the light 'cause I'm not faking the shit
I told you once that I'm a soldier I'm just taking your shit
Now who am I a born killer nigga fuck what you heard
I'm too delirious and serious I ain't like a nerd
Fuck around and call the coroner dig your whole ass up
Separate your head from the spam and leave your bitch ass stuck
Nigga...


Retaliation is a must
I see niggas from behind so I bust
My Desert Eagles gon to catch you when they duck
Now what the purpose when they still gon get struck
And leave they brains fucked up
I don't know why they put they eyes on me
'cause I'm a black material killer trying to keep it low key
Now what it was they probably didn't know it was me
But that goes to show em that fancy bitches focus just be
They want to look up on my Rolex while I spot on my heat
They see my Lexus car shining when I been on the streets
With no ticket on it but still they try to find out what's in it
It's a black nigga with a black chrome on the seat
In the dark zone it's on
And hell yeah I used to push packs
Taking niggas straps and pimping bitches in 'lacs
Matter of fact this shit I rap about I did before
See it ain't no studio mother fucker just stepping through these doors

We can't be fucked with we can't be touched
'cause the drama that we bring is just too much it's just too much
Do Or Die Do Or Die
'cause the drama that we bring is just too much it's just too much <start> My life on earth is over
I died a sudden death
I didn't care about JESUS
I am sorry to confess
I don't know where I am
It could be hell I guess
Should this be the terminal
For all the deceased godless
A grieving darkness surrounds me
Fearsome screams get through my core
Tearing the intolerable silence
Satan I have to adore
I want to loose my sense
I want to die
But I am dead
JESUS is no lie
His existence is reality
And who believes in Him
Is blessed in all eternity
Now I know that
Now it is too late
Now that I am dead
I know there is no fate
But an almighty GOD who has all under control
If I only had a second chance
I would live a different life
A life in CHRIST
If only somebody could hear me
I would shout out loud
'Alive is CHRIST'
And the reward for those
Who live without Him
Is worse than death
It is eternal loneliness
Eternal agony is my future
Tortured an godforsaken forever
Will I turn back ever
Never <start> 
Following the own perfection
I unite with you 
Leaving into the new reality
I become damnation
lead BART
I promised and believed
I found the real sense
I revealed the mystery of power
I conceived the magic of deeds
I trusted in my own destination
lead LES
I tasted the fruits of rapture
I sacrificed my existence
I drank the chalice of bitterness
Leaving into the new reality
Here I am  for you
Waiting for your nod
Longing for my performance
Here I am  with my blood
lead BART
lead LES
lead LES
lead BART
Forever... with you <start> As the decades and centuries rolled by
Most of the christians no longer thought
That the second coming of christ
Would take place in their own lifetime
They firmly believed
The awaited return of jesus christ
To earth in order to judge
The living and the dead
But they thought its possible
That these holy events
Might not come to pass
For hundreds or thousands of years
On the basis of a complex numerical
Calculations involving the symbolic
Interpretation of the so called
Book of truth
Still the preachers of our modern age
Which prophecies claimed true
Admit and coness your pathetic sin
Then you kneel and let the brainwash begin
The world will be swept by war and plagues
All evil will control humanity
Many will follow the beast 
And take up arms against christ
The battle of armageddon is near
Apocalypse pestilence war famine and death
The demons of finality
From the sky they came
As written in biblical times
The vision of the destruction fo earth
The future is dark and violent
Carpathian Forest wants you dead DEAD <start> Let this game begin
Watch my children
Watch me you've all come to die
For this battle is lost
Losing their minds
Losing their souls 
We don't talk
We don't care anymore 
We don't care anymore
I summon the Nine now
Confirm the alignment 
Carry on you fools
Try to break free
When we fail
It's lost forever 
When we fail
It's lost forever 
It's not real no reason to be here
No more fear and no more regrets
Don't look back and free your mind
Stay where you are till the sealing is over
Say goodbye my friend
Here's your promised end
Be a part of the grand parade
Along we're driven
On and on it's a grand parade
We're one we're so sorry to say
It's all the same you will see
On this grand parade
Damnation
Now join the grand parade
Don't be upset 
Every now and then 
They'll try to awake the misguided 
The voices you'll hear
They will claim to be real it's not true
Now look around
We will bring them down
The more I'll show
The less you will know
The Nine will frown
Now see how it grows
Secretly my vision comes true
It's not real
You'll hear it you'll see it
The otherworld
The otherworld
The otherworld appears
Now round and round
We all shall lose ground
Now praise I'm the one
We will never fear
We will never fear
We will never fear them again
Oh and here comes the son the son
He's gone with the shadows
Along with the stars
No more gods no more lies
No more gods no war
We'll be free here we are one
Our will is strong
No more lies and no more tyrants
It all becomes real when the sealing is over
Say goodbye my friend
Here's your promised end
Be a part of the grand parade
Along we're driven
On and on it's a grand parade
We're one we're so sorry to say
It's all the same you will see
On this grand parade
Damnation
Now join the grand parade
There is no return
It would be the end
We shall sing we shall sing
Praise the day
Void we don't fear you no more
Mother void you can't enter no more
We don't need any hallows
We don't fear any shadows
Shadows on the wall
They're not real
Now walk in everyone
Here comes the sun
We will never fall
We will never fall
We will never see him again
Many we're one
We're humanized
The time has come
This flesh is truth
This blood is real
The highest cause
It's all that we are longing for
There on the river Styx
You'll see my friend
There on the river Styx
You'll see
They've fooled you to take it away
So no more myths
No more bliss
We are holding it in our hand
And there is nothing they can do
And so this battle ends forevermore
We don't fear anything
Nor any other race
We take control
No longer we act like fools
We're in control
Say goodbye my friend
Here's your promised end
Be a part of the grand parade
Along we're driven
On and on it's a grand parade
We're one we're so sorry to say
It's all the same you will see
On this grand parade
Damnation
Now join the grand parade
Drown one more time
While we all will say goodbye
Bright it shines bright
Let us carry one the lie
No more lies
One more lie <start> Never kid yourself
Never were never will be shit to me
Fucking worthless
You are nothing
Nothing more than a common whore
You're dead inside
This is nothing
When will you learn your lesson
Mother fucker
Day to day
Waking up
I look in the mirror
For my vengeance
You can't change this
Cause i'll will always be
Above you
You are nothing
Nothing more than a common whore
You're dead inside
This is nothing
When will you learn your lesson
Mother fucker

Step off
You are nothing <start> Captured by the priest of evil
Deep inside the hive
Hellish dungeon filled with undead
Their rotting claws reaching for my
Legs I hang above the ghouls
I know they want me for their food
Overwhelmed by deadly fear
Hung above the Zombie lair
Hanging by a thread above them
Taken here to die
Rotting hands reaching for me
Their undead eyes see me as a meal
They want to eat alive
Mindless hunger in their eyes
Filthy claws grasp at my feet
Slashing wounds my ankles bleed
Pit of zombies
Chasm teeming with undead
Death is grisly
Lowered slightly now they reach me
I scream in frantic pain
Tearing off my feet with fury
The pain intense below my knees my
Legs have been removed
They suck the blood from the wounds
Voracious zombies rend my thighs
They pull me down my corpse they
Will divide
Pit of zombies
Chasm teeming with undead
Their jaws await me
A gruesome end the
Pit of zombies
Reanimated to devour
I watch them kill me
They claw at my face
And rip off my scalp
Exposing my skull
Arteries severed
Gushing blood showers them drives
Them mad raging mob
A hideous feast
Puncture my stomach and
Tear out the guts
Devour entrails
Rotting zombies have torn me apart
They gorge on my flesh
Engulfed
Consumed
This pit
My doom
Engulfed alive
Consumed by death
This pit of zombies
My doom is here
Pit of zombies
Chasm teeming with undead
Their jaws await me
A gruesome end the pit of zombies
Reanimated to devour
I watch them kill me <start> Instrumental <start> I'm not a dreamer
the time of trust is over
I'm not a dreamer
the smell of feeling blows away
I'm not a fighter
you make the rules I played the part
I'm not a fighter
your evil work destroyed my heart
go away all your toys surround you
it's so absurd
I can't stop to rock
I could not stop
running away
from your side
your the evil
of my mind
king for a day
king for a day
I'm on my knees
like a dog on a chain
stand up for myself
or I'll never be a man
smoke blows away and I wake up

I can't stop to rock
I could not stop
running away
from your side

Susurro a tu oido escuchare.
Confia en mi
aprovechar tu existir

ve a disfrutar

Como un billete de mil
finalmente vuelve a ti
que lo sueltas sin pensar
que a tu mano volvera
los hilos invisibles pensando al par

Confia en mi

Calling their manchild as the trouble would blow
There's always some body to watch over me
I'm never alone I wish they'd leave me be
Never alone
I'm never alone
I'm just a boy not long for this world
I'm called nelsito and I'm thirteen years old
For nearly two decades this vendetta has raged
There are no men I'm the last in the chain
Last in the chain
I'm manchild man
Marimba sing high marimba sing low
Marimba sing high as the cemetery grows
All have been wept for husbands brothers grandsons
Grandfathers nephews cousins uncles fathers and sons
I walk in boots too big for me
The women do cry as they watch over me
I work at the altar I try to be good
But just like the others I'll soon travel in wood
I try to be good
Man child in wood <start> Philosopher Bastard head of the Eucharist
Seasons have counted backward
Return the baby to the river
Wooden raft
Upstream current of Yahweh's golden piss
Return the holy flesh of the Nazarene
Tabernacle of ash
My side bleeds too
Please wipe my face with the shroud of impiety
Are those my lungs in your grasp
Because I can breath no more
With bloodsoaked fingers I chisel away at stone
Uncover
Rediscover flesh like my own
Heal me Heal me
Emasculate

We will not eat again
Shed the lice great leper lord because we are blind now too
Drag the holy remains over my own body

un dia mas se va y tu no estas
Quisiera escapar huir de esta soledad...
Pero algo me impide dejar todo atras
Sin ti nada es igual
Quiza haya una razn por la que luchar
cuentan que un ser provoc
la ira de un dios por su perfeccin
Su envidia acab con el don en dos le separ
y el dios descans
Intento no pensar no quiero estar triste
mi vida ya no es igual si tu no estas
No entiendo la razn pero algo me dice
que un dia tu y yo
haremos temblar a ese dios ya lo veras
Quiza haya una razn por la que luchar
cuentan que un ser provoc
la ira de un dios por su perfeccin
Su envidia acab con el don en dos le separ
y el dios descans
Y un da tal vez se vuelvan a ver
Sintiendo una atraccin
no entienden por que pero han de saber
que han roto esa maldicion
han de hacer caso a su corazn
Cuentan que un ser provoc
La ira de un dios por su perfeccin
Por nombre le puso amor
Tu eres la mitad... la otra soy yo <start> Intro

Repeat Chorus <start> tat twam asi
lost in a wilderness
i will build a fire
i become a fire
to swim in the waters
burrowing and bellowing
into a consciousness
kicking against
yet we're needing to want this
sucking and bleeding
now knee deep in substance
pulling and dragging
fail to allow ourselves
as we move to consciousness
as we move through consciousness
as we move to consciousness
driven by need for transecendence
tat twam asi
focus on the focusless
focusless is the focus
look into the self
one name branded deep
burning and singing
the markings of the soul
turning more turning
we assimilate ourselves
needing the push
a sea of flailing limbs
push to create
an equalibrium
as we move to consciousness
as we move through consciousness
as we move to consciousness
driven by need for transecendence <start> A hundred suns born to kill
It is madness a sun created by man
Once again a perverse irony of life
Earth creates man destroys
Love and hatred
We are the butchers of the earth
A hundred suns will be born
Millions of lives will fall
The first lightening
A picture without protection and sense
The end torture and death
When do they stop when is it over
One day they will all stand up
Rebel against us exterminated us
The first lightening
A picture without protection and sense
A hundred suns born to kill
It is madness a sun created by man
Once again a perverse irony of life
Earth creates man destroys
Love and hatred
We are the butchers of the earth
A hundred suns will be born
Millions of lives will fall
Born to kill <start> I know no one had ever dreamed that
We were this strong and we'd achieve this
So long the doubt and all believed it
And now it's come for all to see yeah
We've worked so hard
Pushed every day now
See the blood sweat and tears on our face
We've never been stronger
There's no holding back now
So you can hear us say
Stand up stand up we were right
You know we can't be more justified
And they can't deny it
Stand up stand up we were right
We've come to far just to fade away
And they can't deny it
I've hear the words those in the circle say
So what they're done don't matter anyway
Well here's your proof they're all silent today
And there's no way they can take it away
We've worked so hard
Pushed every day now
See the blood sweat and tears on our face
We've never been stronger
There's no holding back now
So you can hear us say
Stand up stand up we were right
You know we can't be more justified
And they can't deny it
Stand up stand up we were right
We've come to far just to fade away
And they can't deny it
We never said it was easy
And no one gave us a thing
Now that last part is so pleasing
We're stronger than you think
Stand up stand up we were right
You know we can't be more justified
And they can't deny it
Stand up stand up we were right
We've come to far just to fade away
And they can't deny it
Stand up stand up we were right

Stand up stand up we were right <start> Oppressive air heary and noxious
Volcanic outpour roars from the heaving angered ancient earth
Storm of spirits raging
Corrosion eats away oxidizing mentally
When they would call to us
When they would beckon us
We would deliver them
We would make them whole again
When they would see the lies
When they would see this world
In glorious anger would rise again
In reclamation
Keeper of all chaos uncontrolled
Bringers of truth embody me
Speaker of ends wipe the slate again
Turn man against his brother in deceit
Old ones return to the light
Come the inception of the end
Old ones suspended beyond sight
Crack the earth sphere open
To doom all will descend
Ominous and obscure carnivorous and monstrous
Hideous and slithering dead to eyes but ever dreaming
Behind the stars at high below the stirring sea
Arise and claim your throne of lunacy
They would reach to us
They would summon us
Voices transcend in dream
Echo Cthulhu's screams
They do see the lies
They do see this world
They'll part the seas
In utter pandemonium
Old ones return to the light
Come the inception of the end
Old ones suspended beyond sight
Crack the earth sphere open
To doom all will descend
Ominous and obscure carnivorous and monstrous
Hideous and slithering dead to eyes but ever dreaming
Behind the stars at high below the stirring sea
Arise and claim your throne of lunacy
Treacherous and impure impious and murderous
Cadaverous yet living dead to eyes but ever dreaming
Beyond the galaxies below the ocean deep
Arise and claim your throne of lunacy <start> A flashing blade of ancient times
my hands were clenched around its heel
an evil wizard's spell would leed
my life to bitter endless nights
For as it was cursed to drink the blood
of any human living thing
for once a day or even more 
or it would slay the keeper dead
So I was bound to keep clear of those
I loved for I could never know
when the blade returns to life
and guide my hands to harm a friend
The last words I tell to warn you now
sre not to touch the blade
so it can never drown the blood
from any living man <start> Remember your carress so gentle
Remember your kiss so delightful
With tears running down my cheek
I sit here alone wondering  why
Sing with me  this song of love so pure
Sing with me  this mournful serenade
Sing with me  this song of love so pure
Sing with me  this mournful serenade
The pain inside me is unbearable
My love for you stronger than ever
Why this sunfdden departure
Why did you decide to end your own life
Sing with me  this song of love so pure
Sing with me  this mournful serenade
Sing with me  this song of love so pure
Sing with me  this mournful serenade <start> Avalanch

Strong winds on the sea of the damned
The high waves break the land
Bright sunlight is melting the snow
The winter land starts to flow
Springtime is the season we hail
the time to set our sails
Shortly we will set our course
and sail to foreign shores
Pre Chorus
Odin give us the force
We're leaving the cost behind us
Oh Thor bring us the storm
The longboat is in your hands
Let the ravens fly once again
Chorus
From the north we come  Great Odin's sons
Glory will come as we sail
From the sea we come  Great Odin's sons
Fearless and strong we'll prevail
We fight we kill we die for the Viking Gods
At dawn we are ready to slay
'cause mayhem is our way
We hunt rape and slaughter the weak
Destruction is what we seek
Pre Chorus
Chorus
Solo Both Dahl Nyberg
Chorus <start> hello my friend hope it's the end
no saving grace no words to tell
since emotions explode
solidifly sorrowproof shields
try to reconstruct my world
from broken frames of the past
entering final chapter
embittered daybreak surrounds
virus in veins
elusive pain
forever blind
first strike is deadly  now death becomes me
convicing concept well excused
nail biting show exciting view
world famous victims  opening night
commercial breakdown tense sinews graps
drive needle in solution  choke
third degree filth
rope dagger bullet  a friend or a foe
uneasy movement  in for the kill
senses slow down
bite helping hand
zero in on me
scratching the surface  now death becomes us
feels like I'm doing it for a first time
forced to play this ugly scene
an actor without screenplay
in a virgin suicide
forward to exit shivering  stoned
insipidlifestyle  rat race control
transfigured angels with no choice at all
taking their own lives  you're next in line <start> In the eyes of an angel a heavenly glare
On the other side a demonic stare
The wings of light face the winds ot tiome
The wings of darkness in a blistering line
The humans spirit is now free
Forever gone all agony
All rules are crumebling to dust
Absurd beliefs gone in a gust
The armies clashing at each other ion the plains
Twisted features frozen on an angels face
A demons corpse dissolves in a blaze of flames
Good and evil disappear in a void
The humans spirit is now free
Forever gone all agony
All rules are crumebling to dust
Absurd beliefs gone in a gust <start> Forsaking every other thing
Leaving uncertainties behind
From the loneliness and the dark
I came into your light
No more sadness surrounding me
My heart is beating it's last beat
As I am breathing my last breath
For what I could not live without
Has gone and will not come again
Sadness surrounding me <start> You left some hope instilled in me
That I never should give up on anything
I know this made you proud of me
So this song remains for those who hurt like me
The man in black. He rides alone to a final destination unknown.
The man in black He rides alone he's moving on.
Not coming home.
I used to be the fearless one.
Living each day like death would never come
Now I feel his cold breath on my neck
He's watching my steps and telling me that I could be next.
Before I used to take these wings and I'd fly so high

Now I live n regret never coming down to say goodbye
Oh why can't I
The man in black. He rides alone to a final destination unknown.
The man in black. He rides alone he's moving on.
I can't follow.
I used to be the fearless one.
Living each day like death would never come
Now I feel his cold breath on my neck
He's watching my steps and telling me that I could be next.
So make way for the man in black
So make way. He's never coming back.
I am so lost at sea
Ryan shine the light for me
I'm sinking I can't swim
I need you here to pull me in
I am so lost at sea
Ryan shine your light for me
I'm sinking I can't swim
I miss you brother.
You will never dim. <start> What is the meaning of thi life that we're leading
That is the answer within itself
There is no reason to start fighting what we're given
Yet we seldom see truth in our timeless youth
Hell is an instrument of faith so despised
By all who think with their minds. Rebirth is a lie
My chains will bind me My chains will blind me
Colors of a faceless shadow creep up behind me
Human life is meaningless
Many nights we have obsessed over who we were
One day we will pay the price
For all we've crushed and all our vice
But let me tell you one last time That there is hope
Finding the truth inside the lies we are taking
Will the light glance our way bedore we are lost
I am the one that they call Dillamond Alexander
And the mist before my eyes is clearing the sky
And now my mind is ready to take on the challenge
Open enough to receive my epiphany
The motive that was hidden is appearing to me
The knowledge I have gathered converged here today
Perishing is all I have Inhibitions failing me
Cherishing that part of me Heaven knows it's all I have
Under her spell I lay Fire is consuming me
Letting myself burn away Utopia is just a thought
Human life is meaningless <start> Beasts of prey strike with lightning speed
Wagons of war collide
Metallic plague armored locusts drive
Into the storm of steel
Exterminate feed the battlefield hunger
With honor that is loyalty unto death
Cauldrons swarming spearhead boiling over
The ironmonger's engines roar
Motorized slaughter panders smash
Reliquary immemorial of runic conquest
Wincing crablike across a scarred land
Into the storm of steel
Bombs flagellate as poisoned rain
Corrosives soaking deep
The skin of earth erupts in sores
Wounds and filth unending
Winged death spurting flames vilify
Splatter the whore of Armageddon
Guttural ejaculate mummifying rust
Disintegrating bones to dust
Exterminate feed the battlefield hunger
With honor that is loyalty unto death
Cauldrons swarming spearhead boiling over
The ironmonger's engines roar <start> <st line missing>

It was the day after fluke night. We eventually ended up in a guest house accommodation type hotel owned by a large betting shop chain. Ladbrokes Inc. On checking in I got into the lift and looking at the key it had three numbers on it. The numbers were   . You don't see these type of hotels much out of the middle of England and here's why  getting to the third floor I found that  did not exist. <start> This is an ode to all my old buddies
The ones that helped me realize when shit was funny
Cut our teeth
A kick in the ass
Tackling life there's just one chance
Mischief makers piss some off
Deal with consequences or not
Roaming the city eyes open wide
Every adversary is urged to hide
With boots on ground
Win hands down
A giant sound
Win hands down
Just maintain
Then drop the reins
And place my crown
Win hands down
Lise some royal decree
A verbal contract
You're with me
And man I got your back
Seeking adventure every which way
Knowing full well there may be hell to pay
Adolescence in full swing
A booming voice were gonna bring
So much that this platoon can do
Bread and circus is the rule <start> Sanguis meus tibi non iam perbibendus sit
Macula aeterintatis
Numquam detergenda
Quisnam surget et deteget
Imaginem veritates 
People created religious inventions
To give their lives a glimmer of hope
And to ease their fear of dying
And people created religious intentions
Only to feel superior and to have a license to kill
Our desire to die is stronger
Than all your desire for life
There is no getting away from it now
Only true faith survives
People created religious inventions
To give their lives a glimmer of hope
And to ease their fear of dying
And people created religious ascensions
To subject the others and to enslave just to further enrich themselves
It doesn't matter where we die
It doesn't matter that you cry
We'll take you with us
A disgrace on the beyond
O servator sempiterne
Te grati coluimus Odor atrox quo nons superfundis intolerabilis est
Deceive yourself by yielding
to soft words that cause no pain
Enrich yourself with different views
Learned without disdain
A disgrace on the beyond
That can never be undone
Who shall rise and unveil
The Facade of Reality
Is there still room for new dents in old wrecks
A disgrace on the beyond that can never be undone
Deceive yourself by yielding to soft words
Enrich yourself by making up your own mind
Sanguis meus tibi non iam perbibendus sit <start> Under fire were you born
Son of god and mortal
Under warrior's moon
Shining one of an age gone by
Throw the spear of destiny
Spill the blood
Victorious you stand
In flames
Live to kill
Creature of war
Divine is thy soul
Of fire
Oblivious to your mortality
Battle frenzy possesses you
By axe  by sword you slay your enemies
Ride through the night
On your blazing chariot
With torches held high
Their smoke spirals to the heavens
A threatening omen
To those who would dishonour you
Drink the blood  devour the heart
The glory of death shall flow through your veins
With strength were you born
With strength shall you rise
Carrion crows circle the skies
Hungry for the flesh of your prey
Scattered  sun bleached bones
Mark your trail of terror
Throw the spear of destiny
Spill the blood
Victorious you stand
In flames
Live to kill
Creatre of war
Divine is thy soul
Of fire <start> Black shirt

The power of the darkside <start> Inside the power cage I can feel the music of my age
It's paranoid first degree It's telling me that I'm not free
I've got Heavy Metal Music in my blood
And I'd like to get it to you if I could.
As I lie here in the fright of darkness the wings of light remove the veil
It's Heavy Heavy Heavy Heavy Heavy Metal Mania all the way.
Rock and Roll was far too slow and so the adrenaline just doesn't flow
Where is the power where is the glory Heavy Metal is my story.

You have no power I devour.

You have no power I devour.

To send shivers
To the bone

Fluch  Du kwirst gebrochen werden
Fluch  Ich nehm dich niemals hin
Fluch  Verdammt seist du auf ewig
Fluch  Du brichst nicht meinen Sinn
Regen splt die letzten Reste

Covered with pretty girls and catchy lines
Put up fences and cement the ground
To dull my senses keep the flowers down

Spend my money on a race to space
Wasting my money slapping my face
They've taken a peek over future's fence
Taken a peek at my expense

passion haunts my mind
peace and chaos fight in my heart
in my dreams there is always daylight...
Black was the day
Constant the flow of my tears...
Black is the day
My yearning is invincible...
Beauty surrounded me
Illusion was beauty made true...
Beauty surrounds me
The dream is always there...
I can hear the thunder of silence
I feel the cold in the middle of the flame...
I see shadows of the invisible
I breathe where there is no air...
I eat the bread that ran out yesterday
I am dumb but I cry Thy name...
I regret the joy I have
I suffer from the happiness I wish for...
I am a prisoner behind bars of freedom
I now sense the things that have never happened.
Beauty surrounded me
Illusion was beauty made true...
Beauty surrounds me
The Hope remains for ever... <start> Ce soir la Lune rve avec plus de paresse
Ainsi qu'une beaut sur de nombreux coussins
Qui d'une main discrte et lgre caresse
Avant de s'endormir le contour de ses seins
Sur le dos satine des molles avalanches
Mourante elle se livre aux longues pmoisons
Et promen ses yeux sur les visions blanches
Qui montent dans l'azur comme des floraisons
Quand parfois sur ce globe en sa longueur oisive
Elle laisse filer une larme furtive
Un pote pieu ennemi do sommeil
Dans le creux de sa main prend cette larme pale
Aux reflets urizes comme un fragment d'opale
Et l'amener de son corps loin des yeux do Soleil <start> I am the constant chill
I am the versatile one
I am the constant chill
I am the versatile one
I am the god you loved
I am the addiction
I am the god you loved
I am the addiction
I am inside
I am constant chill
That moves up and down your spine
I am the versatile one
That moves in and out your mind
I am the dark abyss
That haunts before your prayers
And I am the nemesis
That haunts in your nightmares
You can feel when I am inside
And you know that
I control you
I enslave you
I destroy you and leave you comatose
I am the god you love
That moves in and out your veins
I am the addiction
That buries you in shame
You can feel when I am inside
And you know that
I control you
I enslave you
I destroy you and leave you comatose
I've wrapped these chains so tight
You can't break through
The smell of fear is so enticing
It's so inviting
There is nothing more that I love
Than to tear you apart
I am inside and you know that
I control you
I enslave you
I destroy you and leave you comatose
I've wrapped these chains so tight
You can't break through
I am the constant chill
I am the versatile one
I am the god you loved
I am the addiction
I leave you comatose <start> millions of images are growing in my eyes
as they vortically twist
a state of confusion absorbs my sight
feelings of claustrophobia dwell inside my shadow
hitting every obstacle
I'm breathlessly dragging myself to the goal
faded vision confuse my path
suspended in a supernatural dimension
I try to resist
paralyzed by obsession
strange eyes unknown faces
surrounded by fears I try to escape
drowning in a sea of terror
I try to escape <start> Can you hear these voices
Dark brown dresses around me
Can you hear these whispers
Fear inside me
Can you feel this bitterness
Rapid mountain rivers
floating stories down the world
Voices are rising from the earth
Screaming for revenge
Up in the skies
Run by the wind
Just one more time they set the fire
I open wounds not healed for ages
In anger I stand
Dripping with blood and burning
Secret paths high up and down
Their lots floating on mountain rivers
Faster faster down the world
Are you aware of that  <start> The quest for Azunda hath drawn near
The young king the chaos he brings
With iron grip's sword chants come forth
The child of dark he is
In prophecy chaos not near
In chaos prophecies began
This child of dark hath foreseen
He makes his own destiny
The magic he creates is from his will
The magic of Azunda he shall receive
Iron grip's sword guides his path
To the place which is no more
The journey to this place is creation
In this creation he shall be
Living for himself and his destiny
In his path lies of the prophecies
In his mind he sees another
Who wishes to receive Azunda
He sees light within in his enemy
And laughs at the prophecy
His will and his word is his sorcery
He is waiting for thee
To put an end to this prophecy
Azunda give your power to me
The child of dark has found thee
And now must destroy evil thee
Iron Grip's sword has gone through thee
Now Azunda is mine for all to see
The king's task has been complete
The chaos has begun for all to see <start> They will slit the throat of a goat
And slit it's bowels open
And you will either have sex
With a crucified young girl on a cross
Or a half rotted corpse <start> Instrumental <start> We're standing on the edge of time
We're riding to the stars
And we never will surrender
Lonely knights we are
And we are flying into the open sky
Gliding to the stars
We are standing strong together
But still they seem so far
And we're diving into eternity
Facing destiny
And we are flying away eternally
Forever riding free
Hands up high
Oh warriors of light
And carry on a thousand times
You're forever lasting ride
Land of light
The glorious unite
Oasis for a thousand lifes
Forever we survive
We're flying to the promised land
To the gates of no return
We're heading for the future
And we'll fight until the end
Bridge  Chorus
Once upon a time
We reached the stars our hands have touched the sky <start> Silent cries echo in this peaceful place
Eyes closed nothing more to say
In the finest crest of ebony
A familiar name carved in ivory
I will forever owe my first one
For grabbing me
Needing me returning me
Facing tomorrow
We walked through halls of pain holding close
Earth Mother and this father earthbound together
We brought the memories home holding close
Earth Mother and this father earthbound forever
The earth now treasure my deprived
Once soft and pale these memories stain
Underneath this stone a truth so cruel
All so divine the scavenger awaits its prey
This burden of grief pulling in me
So much colder and with no relief
Will your deeds make the scale sway the right way
The truth to it all revealed
This hopeless life I led
My own blood I let shed
My body so weak and sore
Waiting to be decomposed
Overwhelmed by this tragedy
Wrapped up in harmony
Close my eyes no more will to be
As nature is delivering me
This burden of grief pulling in me
So much colder and with no relief
Will your deeds make the scale sway the right way
The truth to it all revealed
Here in this garden of memories
I have searched for some clues to life
Feedback from those resting so wise
I wish they could tell me it's all a lie
I believed in a life so delight
I'm so crestfallen by the truth so cold
After the storm there will be light
But right now I don't want to arise
I believed in a life so delight
I'm so crestfallen by the truth so cold
After the storm there will be light
But right now I don't want to arise
We walked through halls of pain holding close
Earth Mother and this father earthbound together
We brought the memories home holding close
Earth Mother and this father earthbound forever <start> You love the rush the rush of the win
Risk of defeat risk everything
Feel you can cheat death one more time
There's nothing else till you cross the line
Faster than the rest you live to be
You're at the line cause you've got to see
Chorus
Ten ten seconds
Ten seconds at at time you feel alive for
Ten ten seconds
Living your life in a quarter mile
Time to focus you picture the win
The engine roars feel the rush within
You must pursue this victory
There is nothing else you have to be
Faster than the rest you live to be
You're at the line cause you've got to see
Repeat chorus
Faster than the rest you live to be
You're at the line cause you've got to see
Repeat chorus x
In ten ten seconds
Ten ten seconds
Ten <start> Walk through the mist at the awakening day
Threatening obscure dismal dark clouds my way
Chorus
Seducing whisper leads me down
To shallow seas in which to drown
Trapped within magic lullabies
Just as I heard his cursing cries
Never see the day lit time
Dragon be revenge is mine
You will forget what you once thought was yours
I'll take your shape and I will take her too.
Chorus
The curse will last until you see
and break the chains of neverfree
Chorus <start> It's the fall
You are damned to live your life in wastelands
It's the fall
In a world where weak ones are left alone
Dreams all your dreams
All your dreams are buried in mounts of sand
Breathe breathe the dust
Breathe the lifeless dust of nature's revenge
Now you see all damage we have done
You lost all you had and will lose even more
Fall fall it's your fall forever
Last days of Gaia
Fall fall never end it's your fall
The future lies in your hands
Fall fall it's your fall forever
Your adventure's just begun little hero
Win the game or... forever fall
Feel do you feel
Do you feel the corruption haunting you
Live will you live
Will you live the perversion like others do
Now you see all damage we have done
You lost all you had and will lose even more <start> look at me and tell me the truth
what do you do
when people don't know what we go through
they see my blonde hair blue eyes and class
but they don't know i have a really big heart
please don't get me wrong
i know that i am hot
but textbook perfection really takes a lot
when guys call my phone
and girls call me names
but like miley said
i can't be tamed
chorus
hot girls we have problems too
we're just like you
except we're hot
the world needs to open their eyes
and realise
we're not perfect and sometimes we lie
i got the look
i got the butt
but those things don't make me a slut
boys call me stuck up
girls say i'm conceited
on behalf of all hot girls
those comments aren't needed
just cuz i'm pretty
i have to be dumb
i don't care about wits
i just wanna have fun
people start rumours
and say things about me
funny thing is
i didn't go to the party
chorus x 
hot girls we have problems too
we're just like you
except we're hot
the world needs to open their eyes
and realise
we're not perfect and sometimes we lie
ha
why oh why
can't you see
you all are
just like me
we make mistakes and get in trouble
now you know our hot girls' trouble
hot girls we have problems too
we're just like you
except we're hot
the world needs to open their eyes
and realise
we're not perfect and sometimes we lie

we're not perfect and sometimes we lie
just kidding
we're perfect <start> She awakens from a dream to a silent room
Where shadows speak of memories
Another sleepless night
Afraid to face the day
It seems so long ago she shared the love
She feels so deep inside
Her love will never die
But still she feels so lonely
Lonely in Love
Lonely in Love
She wakes up to another day
With everything going wrong
She wonders where she would be
If she had never seen his face
She turns on the radio
But it's playing that same old song
She's pouring another drink
To drown away the memory of it all
She can't wait another night
Take another day
She doesn't want to be
Lonely in Love
Lonely in Love
There's a feeling she can't explain
That no one can understand
She just needs to get away
But there's nowhere that she can go
Tomorrow's so far away
She's longing for yesterday
If she could just turn back time
She wants to leave the world behind
She can't wait another night
Take another day
She doesn't want to be
Lonely in Love
Lonely in Love
Lonely in Love
Lonely in Love
The night will fade the sun will shine
A new day
And light the way for you to find
New Love <start> Let this stand as a monument to my abandonment and submission to the clutches of consumption. A penance of control for the iniquity of breath. It is irrefutable that we become apostle to mechanism. It is design that orchestrates the perpetuity of tyranny and doctrine of drudgery and toil. Talon of dominion skewer of empire as certain as the blackening of another tomorrow. <start> Can you feel the scent of dreads
Can you guess the coolness of stares
Can you give blood for that
Can you forget to keep control
Now you have to decide
You've got the key you've got the power
So keep your free will dive into the unknown
You need a sign here is the sign
Let grow the knowledge let bloom your soul
You need a sign I'm the sign
Now you have to decide
You've got the key you've got the power life and death
Day after day hour after hour
You find the answers which bring us the questions
For sure you think it would be better to be like them
To be like us
Into the unknown
Let convey the free will
Let grow the knowledge
Let flash the inner sun
Now you have to decide
You've got the key you've got the power life and death
Life and death life and death life and death life and death
Life and death life and death life and death
So keep your free will dive into the unknown
You need a sign here is the sign
Let grow the knowledge let bloom your soul
You need a sign I am the sign
Now you have to decide
You've got the key you've got the power
Day after day hour after hour
You find the answers which bring us the questions
For sure you think it would be better to be like them
To be like us
Another sheep in the flock
Another number in the mob
Another pawn for the game
Another sign which dies down <start> Countdown to zero ignition

Rising in smoke glowing fire
Thrusting into the sky of the morning

In search of the glory
They reach for the stars
With honor and courage
They die

Thunderous roar of the engine
Screaming
They fill the sky burn trails
Down through the clouds falling faster
Disaster
Taking their lives

Mayday <start> I Have Within Me This Knowledge
The Darkness Within
That None Should Ever Touch
And In The Machinations Of Cosmos
I Appeared Centuries Before My Time
....Wisdom Is Lost Here....
The Ferocity Of My Rapture Has No Relent
'Gainst The Ineffable Nightmares
Seizing My Body To Wake
Through The Languid Hours Of Day
Excised In The Blood Of My Pain
The Sombrous Call Of The Silence
Haunts Me...Allures Me....
Yet The Salacious Beckoning Of The Flesh Remains
I Will Move Not For Death Or Suffering
Dissident I Stand Proud Amidst Felony
This Virulence Seethes In My Quintessence
A Reflection Of Past
From The Time Of Conception
Life...The Allusion Of Existence

It Beholds Everything
And Yet It Is Nothing
Life Is.... The Beginning Of Death
Death's Omnipotent Grasp
Scourge's Down Amidst The Skies
Plucking Those Led To Be Slaughtered
Culling Their Futilitarian Existence
Death Is Nothing But The Answer To Life
Death Is Life's Answer <start> Disaffection falls like rain soaking the tempers of a distended kinship. Common culture gains momentum as common enemy. You stare antagonism in the eyes but at a closer look you're face to face with coexistence. How far will opinions shove To the edge of hatred or the end of... <start> Poetry  Arnault de Stael
Music  Romarik d'Arvycendres
Triste et belle lueur
Qui d'un souffle s'endort
Vacillant faiblement
En attendant l'aurore
Son cour est une mche
Que son me consume
D'espoirs qui s'achvent
Ds les premires brumes
Je me retrouve en elle
Car sa vie n'est qu'un pleur
Qu'importent les raisons
Maintenant que vient l'heure
Adieu nuits dsols
Aux sombres clairs de Lune
Adieu parfum d'orage
Aux saveurs nocturnes
En guise de souvenir
sombres paysages
Je garderai en moi d'ternelles images
Des visages de femmes
Meurtrires assouvis
Sans sourires ni larmes
Conduiront mon esprit
Vous daignerez laisser
En un geste fidle
Sur ma dalle glace
Un bouquet d'immortelles
Et vous cher compagnon
Qui ftes plus que frre
De mes noirs difices
Conservez quelques pierres
De nos oeuvres sinistres
Poursuivez les travaux
Et qu'audessus des autres
Brillent encore nos joyaux
Cierge ple tu n'es plus
Qu'un volute un parfum
Expirant vers les cieux
Un nouveau lendemain
A l'instant o je meurs
Et regarde en arrire
J'aperois dans mon cour
Un semblant de lumire <start> I'm here today to blast the two people
That came to grieve your passing <start> From its origin
The bond we set
Seemed never failing
Yet paralleled truths
Would shadow my dreams
With a dormant evil unrestrained
Still trusting nature
Will allow the signs
To be ignored
Never will I falter
This way again
For my will eradicates
Treacherous fallacy
Fate beckons the reaping
Of your alienation
These broken words
Leave shattered hearts
Unmask this trite facade
Triggering loathsome rage
Unforgiving karmic malice
Farewell the favored
The loss is your own
Remember this presage
Losing self is much like being dead <start> Lyrics  RMS Hreidmarr  July 
This is for stepping backwards
Into the light
Enter the Church of Fornication
Resurrection and Life
I am the mother of all the pains
And I know how it has to end
Enter my golden house  Heaven's gate
The veil of illusions  Penetrate Fornicate 
Et clamor meus ad te veniat
Try so hard to find the Quintessence
The sacred eternal sense
My Holy Mary forever lost
My love and only ghost...
Que le Seigneur vous garde toujours pure
Je suis la verite je suis le createur
Et mon fils mes enfants
Celui qui vous ecoute et meurt
Qui par vos bouches offertes
Entend ma voix
De milles destins rouges sang
Sera le Roy
The doors close
And there you are
And there you stand
And there I am God
La meisnie a Sathan est el mustier venue
En sa destre main tint chascuns s'espee nue
Vit de cleres colors la mostier peinturet
De martirs et de virgenes et de granz majestez...
Oseriezvous mettre la parole de Dieu en doute 
Et les cors de la lune et les festes anvels...
Der Teufel soll das alles holen 
Et les cors de la lune et les festes anvels...
Um Gottes willen 
Du bist min
Des solt du gewis sin
Du bist beslozzen
In minem herzen
Verlorn ist daz sluzzelin
Du muost ouch immer darinne sin
Du muost ouch immer darinne sin <start> Endless parade of gross perversions
Like pins pushed into my brain
However shortlived it may be
I remember the sweetness of the pain
Is the greater sin the act I committed
Or the lie later expressing disgust
That doesn't exist most of the time
A lack of morals or a lack of trust
No more blood in my heart
Just concrete pouring in
Protection from conviction
Mortared by my sin
My face slowly turns to stone
No one gets inside
Now I have my secret place
Now I can hide
The white I wore in my dreams
Irrevocably blackened
Anger settling over my eyes
At finding myself lacking
I let them into my darkest halls
And I hate myself for it
They never knew as they overturned things
What was being destroyed
Replaying and reliving
The dark passages of my life
Smiling as I wreak the vengeance
I can never realize
My hands and eyes stay on me
I have made my choice
The big man I am inside
Will never use my voice
I make the lame excuses I heard before
And didn't tolerate
I look into the mirror
And what I see I surely hate
Wretch that I am
Who'll free me from the body of death
The answer's written in my stone
Waiting for my breath <start> I'm watching the mountains I'm watching the sea
Observing the creatures I am lost set me free
Across the heavens I made my way
I've seen empires rise and blown away
I have arrived at my destiny but after all there's just emptiness in me
Dot in the darkness I am going mad
Where are the others there's silence in my head
Cause I'm watcher in the sky
I've seen universes die
Out in the cold my systems overload
I am lost in time
Watcher in the sky
I'm trapped in this nightmare
Endless tortures and pain millenniums have gone by
Uh it drives me insane
Who am I now
I'm not man I'm not machine
I gave my life away for the Iron Savior dream
Cause I'm watcher in the sky
Hooked to the circuits of a lifeless cold machine
Lost in a world of artificial means
Ripped out of my body
I'll stand the rest of time
Am I perpetual Am I divine
I'm a watcher in the sky
My soul has drowned in the tears I cannot cry
I'm the watcher the chosen one but I am lost in time
I'm a watcher in the sky I've seen the years go by
I am the chosen one
Out in the cold my systems overload and I am lost in time
Watcher in the sky
Watching the mountains watching the sea watching the creatures
You'll never be free
Watcher in the sky <start> I can't stand the fucking sound of your name
Triggering indignation
Marauding eyes defile innocence portrayed
Drop like a shot
At a loss for words
I cannot enjoy this atmosphere
Superficial minds cannot comprehend
The beauty of the insane

I'll never change for you
And I shall keep this shred dignity

Put this gun to my head
And paint this beautiful
Fucking portrait
With my abstract mind
I'll kill these worthless emotions
And you fucking masqueraders
I'll pull the fires from the skies and burn the goddess
Vendetta ammunition
Fervent hatred
End neurotic animus
I will kill this worthless emotion called love
I want to fucking kill

Commanders from Below join unholy forces to pretend a world's

On his skullthrone the goatlord vomit his evil benediction of lust
Forever in his name and soul we trust
The departure of war is done all our legions of doom hate and

To the earthly village we fly.
To the flesh we rush to their lord they cry in emptiness
Themselves thy dash

Look the ridiculous guneflexion is makin'
Look our master their souls are taken floating in the halls of ACHERON.
They heard the vociferous cries for now they are ready to deny

 <start> i have this terrible urge
the need to take what is yours
a vulture circling in the sky
preying upon the weak
run away  you're my prey fear my greed
the weaker you are the stronger I get
i feast upon your helplessness
show no mercy and have compassion
because this is your own fault

run away  you're my prey fear my greed
my greed is here to stay
it will haunt you till the end of days
what do you think that will happen now
don't expect me to let go
my teeth in your neck I'll suck the life out of you
just as you tried to do to me
don't be afraid to die
preying upon your weakness
like a vulture in the sky
the need to take what is yours
there's no way back for me
my greed is here to stay
It will haunt you till the end of days
run away  you're my prey fear my greed <start> Crashing flowing swirling
Right from the start
Gnashing ripping bleeding
Quickly tears my flesh apart
Through my cloudy vision
Billows of crimson signal the feast
One last bite coming from all sides
Confusion pain mortality
Reminds that I cannot live
My last hope believe they let me go
Now which way is home
Now which way is home
Oh shit
Here they come again
Oh shit
Here they come again
Quickly tears my flesh apart
Here they come again
Chum chum chum chum
Chum chum chum chum
My last hope for survival
My last attempt at freedom
My last pointless struggle
Sets me free
They have the right to reclaim
What's rightfully theirs
Chum fiesta
Quickly tear my flesh apart
Crashing flowing swirling

Gnashing ripping bleeding
Quickly tear my flesh apart
Crashing flowing swirling
Right from the start
Gnashing ripping bleeding
Quickly tears my flesh apart
Ahh ahh ahh
Quickly tears my flesh apart
Fuck <start> I can't tell I think I might be going crazy
Just wanna leave it all behind
I've been on the brink for many years I'm thinking
Feels like I'm running out of time
I'm getting sick and tired
Giving everything I've got
I get nothing in return
I can't breathe
Chorus
This never ending madness
Raining down on me
Like a ton of bricks
Face in the dirt
Childish delusions they say it's just a fantasy
You're no good no chance you'll never learn
Just give it up and come back to reality
Your dreams are none of my concern
I'm getting sick and tired
Giving everything I've got
I get nothing in return
I can't breathe
Chorus
What do you think you're doing with your life
You should be ashamed of yourself
I don't know why you just don't give up
You got these ideas these dreams
Aha what You're nothing but a loser
No wonder you get no respect
You're not smart enough
You don't speak the right language
Your skin is not the right color
You're too tall you weigh too much
You're too short you're too fat
Why don't you give up your stupid ideas
And do something right for once
Lined up one by one
They try to bring you down
Don't ever listen what they say
Determination the battle will be won
And all the pain will go away
I'm getting sick and tired
Giving everything I've got
I get nothing in return
I can't breathe
Chorus
Yeah
I'm getting sick and tired
Giving everything I've got
I get nothing in return
I can't breathe
Chorus <start> I bleed for you amber star
At the gates of dawn
I will bleed again until pale death
Takes me into its hands
And I am left on my own
The moon bleeds with me
None has what one wants
The sun never crowned the night
With the richness of its colours...
The passionate play of your fingers
They stir the waters we once knew
And the sun is too late again
To see me disappear in the rain
We all seek something
I never sought anything but this <start> Blessed be those who have no idols no idols
Invoke holy honor sanctify the patient.
I don't see the world the same.
I'm no one's hero so just forget my name.
I abhor you
With every foolish thing that you say.
None of it is worth the time
Another meaningless war.
You don't know what you need.
We're all so back and forth
Nothing is as it seems.
You don't know what you need.
We make the same mistakes
We've ruined everything.
What is it this time
What must you call holy
This is your lifeline
Nothing is at it seems.
If I were you I'd give it up.
If I were you I'd care.
I'm born to lose
With a noose around my neck.
World be damned and move forward.
I abhor you
With every selfish thing that you say.
None of it is the worth the time.
You don't know what you need.
We're all so back and forth
Nothing is as it seems.
You don't know what you need.
We make the same mistakes
We've ruined everything.
Born to lose
With a noose around my neck <start> We're born to reign as masters
To ashes we'll burn the pastures
Repell their ways back to nothingness
Chaos in symmetry
This glorious victory
In darkness only we can see
Our name has seen the future
Headshot target now on god
Pointblank crimson dawn
Spew forth tomorrow's spawn
Transcend with rage of the elite
The new order come to rise and shine
Write new history as we wipe and delete
An urge to rid this world of human waste
Weak aside
Defiled bloodlines severed
The lowlife's doom endeavored
The sheep of masses trampled under our march
Set out to lead and create
This power indulge our fate
This era calls for annihilation
Our whispers outsound prayers
We claim what was never theirs
Sworn to the triumph of darkness
Down... infidels bow to me
Die... insects too blind to see
Down... disgusting foul flea
Die... we remove the life of thee <start> Remember the times
When we were young and wild
The beautiful times
Under blue blue skies
Now the years have gone by
And we realized
Creation's divine
We're the last to die
Holy father can you hear us
Is it the end of global freedom
All the children now and ever
Will they ever have a future
What if we try to open the eyes
For a better world tomorrow
One world for all the nations one chance for God's creation
One sky for all the children one light for hope and freedom
A lost paradise
Under the darkened skies
You can see in my eyes
All the tears I cried
Holy father can you hear us
Is it the end of global freedom
All the children now and ever
Will they ever have a future
What if we try to open the eyes
For a better world tomorrow
One world for all the nations one chance for God's creation
One sky for all the children one light for hope and freedom
Arise from deep damnation survive discrimination
Alive a big sensation we are the hero nation <start> Did you notice the sun had turned orange for the last time
The last time...
Did you notice the moon on the seventh day
The last time...
did you see the people gathering for the last time
A past time...
And did you notice the rose it has bloomed for the last time
The last time...
Who truly understand the meaning of the symbols we're given
It's a given
One bites the apple while another drinks unholy water
What is forbidden couldn't stop us from digging deeper
The dam is breaking it won't hold us back any longer
Don't try to stop it cause the Sistine Chapel is gonna burn <start> Reborn through the breeze in a snowstorm
in front of thirteen black brilliants candles
reflecting under my eyes and letting reappear
the Medieval visions of my ancient empire.
Prince Lucifer powerful you buried my corpse
and keep my spirit to challenge the good in the
name of evil and to declare an endless war
with the torment of the infernal legions.
I'm the son of the moon emperor of the war
I'm the one who unleash the hate
I'm the denial of all benevolence
I prepare my holocaust
I shall kill without pity...
I raise the inverted cross in the nightside eclipse...
His eyes shall watch me in battle.
Under the storming holocaustsky
thy kingdom of heaven will be destroyed forevermore
under the throne of the horned king
under the sign of the horned one...
The whole universe will then recognize
the supreme power of Satan who will retake
his throne for eternity and will reign forever.
Beyond the snowclad hills and the icy mountains
a vast field of crucified and impaled is stretching.
They're perishing in the blackness of darkness
and soulless of their soul
for centuries lost in Lucifer's kingdom.
And endlessly the bloody rivers flows
And the maleficiant strengths delivered from
their abyss are raging.
Again the empire of evil
will shine and my domain of terror
will keep his powerful majesty
under the glittering brillance of the moon
and under the sign of the great iron hammer
sign of Thor. <start> Instrumental <start> Everything around me ignites my rage
I'm burning with animosity
Everywhere I look another war to wage
Filled with purpose of singularity
Got my hollow points got my magazines
Wrote my manifesto of decay
Commencement of the killing at the university
Antipathy the lesson of the day
They never should have pushed me away
Chorus
Student bodies lying dead in the halls
A blood splattered treatise of hate
Class dismissed is my hypothesis
Gun fire ends the debate
All I ever wanted was a little affection
But no one ever gave it to me
My hate primer's the result of my rejection
You'll die for it and I'll die for thee
The halls of learning now a shooting range
My final exam with a gun
Killing everyone who ever thought me strange
My bloody dissertation has begun
Pomp and circumstance replaced by bullet wounds
The smell of gunpowder on the air
Murder is the nightmare of this afternoon
My malevolence your cross to bear
All because of my despair
Chorus
Hate lives in me
Hate lives in me
Hate I need it and it needs me
Hate I feed it and it fed me
Hate I breed it and it bred me
Hate
Hate I read it and it read me
Hate I lead it and it led me
Hate I bleed it and it bled me
I breathe it in and it breathes through me
While SWAT teams swarm all around the quad
The symposium of slaughter carries on
Smith and Wesson is my only God
And the line in the sand has been drawn
Valedictorian of violence
Graduation day one bullet remains
Charles Whitman set the precedent
I pull the trigger and blow out my brains
They never knew I was insane
Chorus
I instruct you
And I destruct you
I deconstruct you
Until my hate has fucked you <start> Eyes that last I saw in tears
Through division
Here in death's dream kingdom
The golden vision reappers
I saw the eyes but not the tears
This is my affliction
Eyes I shall not see again
Eyes of decision
At the door of death's other kingdom
Where as in this
The eyes outlast the tears
And hold us in decision.
written by T.S. Eliot <start> There's no remorse within my soul
And I don't lament pain
In fact I enjoy it...
I was all born in an act of laceration
I feel I must leave a sign of my passage
If they only let me go now
Because I have to follow my fate...
I'm disgraced
We have travelled through chaos
All around there's only misery
Ignorance and sadness the pastfinder returns...
All around there's only misery ignorance and sadness why
Many signs of the past that I found
Only echoes of triumph and sorrow
Of grief and past joy <start> Standing in the shadow of our lies
To hide our imperfections
Doing anything we can to hide
Eyes wide open but still blind
To see what really matters
And insecurity won't go
See me in shadows
Standing by the ruins of your soul
That cries for some more meaning
Wondering when you have
Become so cold
So cold
And all the pictures of your past are gone
So cold so cold
Forget yourself
And who you are
Another life is not that far
Standing by the paintings of your dreams
But you have awoken
And all the purples and the greens
Have turned to black
And the ruins of your soul
Have died no more meaning
I wonder when you have
Become so cold
So cold
And all the pictures of your past are gone
So cold so cold
Forget yourself
And who you are
Another life is not that far
Not that far <start> On verens kylm sen

Keskell varjojen <start> I retired a towering mountain
Laid down in a circle of stones
For three days and for three nights
I listened to the skull of a bear
The sun burnt its sigil into my chest
The rain washed the evil away
Time spun itself around me
The moon cast its silvery shell
I rose up in circle of stones
Made my way down in the valley
Followed the banks of a rushing river
To a shore of and icy sea
The great bear growled
The thunder spoke
The mountain shook
The skies lit up
They came carrying their torches
Appeared from the desolate dark
Approached me circling and swirling
Howling their battlecries
That's when the bear was born in me
It rose on its legs beside
From a distance the crack of thunder
And the red cloud swallowed the sky
I rose up in circle of stones
Made my way down in the valley
Followed the banks of a rushing river
To a shore of and icy sea
And in the furthest corner of the North
On the edge of the world we know
With open arms embracing them
And I bared them my heart of hearts
Under the red cloud <start> Comes from the land where night is day
The people live in fear
Been this way for oh so long
Another four thousand tears
Everyday he hunts to kill
You know he can't help himself
Same routine time after time
A way to seize the wealth
Drinking blood don't mean a thing
Life means even less
Impale your wife slay your son
Another gory mess
Born in hell left to die
Now out for all your blood
Living his life day to day
To stake you to the mud
What you see he don't care
Now you bleed start to stare
Cut you down rip you up
Watching warm blood run
Crush your skull strike him well
When you land just impaled
Freshly done there's no hope
Watching warm blood run
What you see he don't care
Now you bleed start to stare
Freshly done there's no hope
Watching warm blood run
Impaler
Impaler
Impaler
Impaler <start> O Serpent and Lion
I invoke Thee
Inside the shrine called life
By the seven wonders
By myriad mortals
That gone
And are to come
Outside
Outside desert ov restriction
In act ov rebellion
On the sea ov motion
Stability ov matter
By serenity strength and beauty
By the mighty chant ov every breath
In serpentine dance ov blood cells
In simplicity ov spells
Divine names metagames
I greet Thy presence
Oh Snake Thou art God
Coiled underneath my throne
With Thee I reunite
With blood we make this covenant
Myself I redefine
Look in and above
There is more than the flesh
Look careful and Thou may see
The unextinguished flame
The nectar ov Thy rage
I taste from the cup ov fornication
And woman by my side
And scarlet is her skin
She's eager to rise
And so eager to please
Another day
Another eternity gone
And on the stairway to salvation
I walk alone among the falling stars
Looking for company
Where art Thou
Oh lacerate ones
Arise my sweetest friend
Or be forever fallen
We have finally arrived
From prison ov this life
To Kali's womb
Down to the earth
As angels ov almighty god
Chaos
'Tis our last fall
To touch our mother whore
The harlot ov the saints
That spits on the rotten cross
Incinerate the icon
The symbol ov all loss
To stand straight
At the left hand ov god
Samael be Thou my ally
Join me among the bright hosts
Wondering neither way ov light
Nor darkness
Ov which seed
Sprouts dispassionately
In the summer ov my life <start> Out to find the truth
Behind the myth of
Man eating man
Finding bodies tied
Up to a stake
You cannot understand
Filled with ignorance
You watch them eat your friends
Ask for evidence
A hook right through your tits
Torn to pieces
Trying to escape
They torture you by
Cutting off your cock
When you're dead
They'll feast upon your flesh
Your brains they'll
Eat and chop <start> Oh Lord of this grey world
Bring colour to my life
Inspire me in my song
With all that's good to make me strong
Oh Lord of this grey world
Give me one more day to heal
Turn my tears to a river of notes
Into an ocean of melodies
Oh Lord of this grey world
The sun hides its light from me
A darkness blacker than blackest night
Leaves me blinded with no insight
Have the poets all left us
Words written forgotten and no one cares
Have the poets all left us
Like dead roses in gardens of sadness
Their petals fall like the tears I cried for thee
Have the poets all left us
Will anyone mourn this loss with me
Have the poets all left us
On their tomb is a secret in stone
it's a poem of love
That no one recalls... no one recalls
Oh Lord of this grey world
Have you gone too Why do you hide
Send my spirit into the night
And set this song into flight
In this age that lacks of grace
Where poets die and leave no trace
Do I toil this night long
All for a rhyme all for a song
Tell me why
I can't free the melody inside of me
Tell me why
I can't find the muse for just one more song...
Have the poets all left us
Words written forgotten and no one cares
Have the poets all left us
Like dead roses in gardens of sadness
Their petals fall like the tears I cried for thee
Have the poets all left us
Will anyone mourn this loss with me
Have the poets all left us
On their tomb is a secret in stone
it's a poem of love
That no one recalls... <start> I have given my life in service to your plan
I have given everything to make you understand
I compromised even when I was ashamed
I didn't know I'd have to
Give up everything
I don't care about your
I don't understand
I am not a part of your perfect plan
I am not a pawn to play the parts that you assign
I am not a part of your perfect plan
Politics is always a game of give and take
But you don't have to live with choices that you make
Your words reveal the motivations in your heart
You have gotten used to
Serving your own needs
I can not change a mind made up
I need to find someone like me <start> I could sit down and write songs all day
About almost anything you say
The only objection is you
I admire you from far away I just can't think of what to say
My friends notice my new ways
What about you
I think of you all times all day
I know how I am is just not okay
But it's not like I'm trying to be this way

I just wanna be with you That's why I appear
To take you away
Away from here
You are for me
And I'm for you
The pain I feel inside my heart
Couldn't be more true
I just wanna be with you.
I look out my window at every one
And see you dancing in the sun
My heart beats through my shirt all at once
When I see you
When I think of you I breathe real fast
The world seems really really vast
You're at the front of my life's huge mast
I guess I'll see you soon.
I just wanna be with you
That's why I appear
To take you away
Away from here
You are for me
And I'm for you
The pain I feel inside my heart
Couldn't be more true
I just wanna be with you. <start> Spit on the streets
Your heads and teeth
Got nowhere to go
other than shows
Could never love
And the PsychoMafia
I'm talking about love

No soul in discos
No rock in the clubs
Bullheads in the pubs
And the city jobs
Could never love

'Cho Mafia
Spit in the streets
Your heads and teeth
Our eyes are red
Our brains are dead
Going on about drugs
PsychoMafia
Could never love
PsychoMafia <start> Forgive me if I'm out of order 
This new 'music' has no soul
It may be good for making money
Sadly that is not my goal
Integrity and honesty are words that you don't understand
but you're the best  it says so in the penny dreadful in your hand
I saw you in a magazine
They're calling you messiah
They must be living in a dream 
they couldn't be more wrong
If we'd played this riff more punk
Then maybe we'd have had a million seller
But this piper's tune is not for sale
I'm glad to say I'm not that kind of fella
D.J.s V.J.s pimps and trollops
Never mind music  this is bollocks
I saw you in a magazine
They're calling you messiah
They must be living in a dream 
They couldn't be more wrong.
Turn on tune up cash in sell out
Turn on tune up cash in sell out
Stand your ground behind the times 
And refuse to follow fashion
Write your poetry with anger
And then sing it with a passion
Painted faces in a circus  images that spring to mind
When I read my penny dreadful filled with pictures of your kind
I saw you in a magazine
They're calling you messiah
They must be living in a dream 
They couldn't be more wrong
Commercial suicide's appealing after
Ten years on this losing streak
'Cause I'd rather be called sour and bitter
Than be deemed the flavour of the weak
Of the weak of the weak
Weak of the weak
I saw you in a magazine
They're calling you messiah
They must be living in a dream 
They couldn't be more wrong
Extra extra read all about it
I saw you in a magazine
They're calling you messiah
They must be living in a dream 
They couldn't be more wrong <start> Just a little taste then best friends we are
You take me in just to spit me out again
This time is now my time is gone
My freedom leaves me a broken soul.
Every day is a struggle for survival
In filth I subsist
To live like this is a gift I dont possess no more
Destination haven.
Vindicate a formless shape creating its own self.
Ominous a future I didn't predict.
It is the reason we forget to forgive.
So hard to keep it in order it is the reason we
It is the reason we forget to forgive.
So hard to keep it in order it is the reason we
Just a little taste then best friends we are
You take me in just to spit me out again
This time is now my time is gone
My freedom leaves me an empty shell.
Vindicate a formless shape creating its own self.
Ominous a future I didn't predict.
It is the reason we forget to forgive.
So hard to keep it in order it is the reason we
It is the reason we forget to forgive.
So hard to keep it in order it is the reason we <start> From birth to death just a slave
From birth to death what am I
I can't believe in myself
I can't see past myself why should I fight
Why should I fight turn my back
Nothing can hurt me if its not real
From birth to death it's all the same From birth to death just a slave
From birth to death what am I
Nothing can hurt me if it's not real
From birth to death I'm just the same <start> Lyrics by RMS Hreidmarr
Make love with chaos once in a lifetime...
I've seen the son of the man
He came to save the ones who were lost
Fathers shall not be condemned to death for the sons
Neither shall sons for their fathers
And everyone shall die for his own sin.
Holy me blessed be
Arisen in the ASA glory
ASA Sahasrar shall abolish the man in me
Black Death nonetheless...
Black Death nonetheless
Black Death for me
For my disease is carrying all the sins of humanity
For my death shall be the negation of your miserable existence
I was talking with Lucipher yesterday
He said he loved you monkeys
He's the only one who cares about you masses
I don't care don't give a good goddamn
May you all die bunch of pigs
Wish I was dead and crucified too
Stigmatized by your weak ignorant moral
My body's raped and desecrated by your innoncent newborn sons
AnusDei
God their flesh tastes so good
Flagrance of the Apokalypse
Lucipher was born a long time after me
And you love to gently caress his perfect hair
What a beautiful child you have Madame
Ah comme je peux hair tous ces miserables assemblages de chair
Ces relations faibles et repugnantes
Mais comment ne pas vomir sur ces corps abjects
Ces tripes fumantes enlacees 
Ah si seulement je pouvais broyer toute cette viande pourrie
Dechiqueter ces putains d'esprits
Expulser leurs fluides leurs ames toute cette atroce puanteur
Ah comme je peux hair celui qui a ose les creer
Je lui ferais bouffer toutes ces creatures
Jusqu'a ce qu'il en creve
Et qu'enfin je retrouve la sphere divine
Vierge et immaculee
Car Dieu m'a dit... toute vie doit cesser... <start> See the blood of our friends that sticking to us
Rising out of the sea of sorrow
There's nothing to loose anymore
We will be fighting till we get hold of our victory
Oh my sword leads us to the castle where the evil lies
The sacrifice was big but we became stronger
We get hold of glory again
On the road we will defeat our enemy even if we'll become the dust
The armors protect our body and departed souls protect our mind
Now the time we'll break through the gate of steel
Into perdition
Struggle for freedom it's our rule
See the fire of steel that calling on us
Oh my sword blaze up
We are children of this battlefield
The sacrifice was big but we became stronger
We get hold of glory again
On the road we will defeat our enemy even if we'll become the dust
The armors protect our body and departed souls protect our mind
Now the time we'll break through the gate of steel
Into perdition
Struggle for freedom it's our rule
No one can stop the force that shatters the dark
Rolling like thunder and run through like lightning
The sacrifice was big but we became stronger
We get hold of glory again
On the road we will defeat our enemy even if we'll become the dust
The armors protect our body and departed souls protect our mind
Now the time we'll break through the gate of steel
Into perdition
Struggle for freedom it's our rule <start> instrumental <start> I see your suffering
When you try to deny me
I'm giving fresh air for you
So you need breathe with me
Do you want to see my creater
And be a guest in my memory
Would you like to talk with my best friend
Who are standing blow in me
You're not the cure
For the pains
I'll embrace you I'll drown you
I'm your part
And you need me too
I'll pray for your
Doomsday
Why are you so angry at me
When I try to take rise out of you
That at last I will close the roomdoor
Where you'll have an unholy doom.
Be friendly and devoted
'Cause I'm not your grunge
Or else I'll break your mirror
And a casket will be at your charge
You're not the cure
For the pains
I'll embrace you I'll drown you
I'm your part
And you need me too
I'll pray for your
Doomsday
I need to hide
To deep inside me
The morbid part
Of my life
I'll be your guide
But please don't cry
When I release the pain
You're not the cure
For the pains
I'll embrace you I'll drown you
I'm your part
And you need me too
I'll pray for your
Doomsday
I need to hide
To deep inside me
The morbid part
Of my life
I'll be your guide
But please don't cry
When I release the pain
I need to hide
To deep inside me
The morbid part
Of my life
I'll be your guide
But please don't cry
When I release the
Pain <start> We sold our homesteads and started on our way
Just like the birds will fly when autumn is here to stay.
One day they will return come spring again that's when.
But we will never see our native country again.
At first we traveled through the English countryside
On tracks and on wagons as quickly as birds would fly.
It was a lovely sight to see the land at last
But all the glorious sights kept flashing by too fast.
And later when we came to Liverpuddlian Bay
The tears of regret finally started to have their say.
The hearts then started burning in each and everyone
We only talked of Sweden that used to be our home.
We all were packed together in one unhealthy cave
It was as if we'd stepped into an open grave.
The food that we had brought from blessed Swedish land
Was suddenly forbidden and taken from our hand.
And when we had been sailing for just a week or two
A horrid kind of darkness was clouding our view.
We couldn't see each other and hardly breathe or walk
It was a gruesome anguish for all people aboard.
The air was filled with hunger and drenched in wretched cries
The howling and the noises would pierce right through the skies
And death became the ruler that forces us to our knees.
The dead were buried in the horrid fathom of the seas. <start> Ya fu se ahogo en su nada
nuestro contrincante.
Perdi duro su guerra lo que
un pedo en el aire fu
Yo me banqu de mentidores
trapero arrebato.
Traicin de los que hoy
se arrepienten porque nada son.
Una vez mas voy con la
verdad para adelante.
Vos lo sabes porque de mi
aguante no dudaste. No
Me siento bien al observar
que pretende arrimarseme
quien se jug ayer noms
en mi contra soandome perdedor. <start> In death she spoke of waiting
Her final days were long
These fields have changed since last she wept
Before the silent throng
She sits where childhood memories lie
Above beside within them
The carvings have outlived the hand
Which bled to first begin them
As features of the landscape merge
The oldest trees are falling
Awareness sweeps the view aside
She stares as if recalling
Seen first beyond the canopy
They soon had reached the borders
The clouds infused with burning breath
Arrived from coldest corners
The windswept valley hastens now
As dying words are uttered
From lips of earth and sapling's strain
Like leaves her last thoughts fluttered
Again it darkens overhead
The knowledge of it stills me
And when the water starts to fall
Preserve the drop that kills me <start> Thickening mass of reality
Curve the existence descends to zero
Crowd loosing its colors
Tightening nature points at the middle
Weighing of central point
The other side of existence arrives
Reflection of what is known devours imperfection
Existence is defective by nature
Highest independence sacred zero
Final ordersacred zero
Lack of imperfectionsacred zero <start> Make me see through eyes
Of a different soul
Cause mine are closed and sealed
Since long before
To seek and hopefully find
Find my own voice
To sail beyond the sunset
And strand on solid ground
I must to maintain
My now so weak belief
May it grow or else
The darkness will never cease
Lost am I in woods of never ending tress
That tomorrow will be dying due to my grief
Is this my ending I failed in my calls
Should have been there
Would have stayed
But to live in fear is not to live at all
Yes to live in fear is not to live at all
I close my eyes and I drift away
Crying loud gone is the day
Will I be awakened tomorrow
That I can only pray
The spark in me quickly fades
A silent voice inside
Child take a look at yourself
You've got to look with better eyes than that
Or else this journey ends
You're fighting a war
where the battle is yourself
Falling and you know
you are bound to fall again
Is this my ending I failed in my calls
Should have been stronger
Would have fought
But to live in fear is not to live at all
Yes to live in fear is not to live at all
Solo Bronell
I'm climbing this latter
But it seems to long
Still it lights up a fire inside of me
That I did not think existed
But thinking again remembering hard times
Cause am I forsaken
Forsaken by gods
But this still is my battle
I am
I am abandoned
Oh yes I am
Solo Andy La Rouque <start> All our lives growing up we are taught to respect the laws of life
Honor they mother and father.
Listen politely when others talk.
Be prompt.
Never disrespect your elders.
Never lie.
Put forth your best effort.
Don't smoke or take drugs.
Sex at an early age is wrong as well.
The moral values sound correct kind of like our president
Lying to protect us
Conceals the truth we are fragile creatures living in a sheltered womb.
As I walk amongst genocide liberty's burning bright
Another way to survive missiles decorate the sky
Long gone are the days when we used our hands to fight
Fists were our weapon of choice.
Now we're putting guns into the hands of little boys
Suicidal bombers killing for a cause nationally exposed internal flaws
Officials above the law they get away with murder.
All while making their business rich
Someday expect a top grossing movie about it
Martyrs they become
The victims are forgot about
 was a tragedy the sight of it still burns inside me
Two days before that my sister came to pass
No country is impervious from a terrorist attack
Still grieving I had to witness that
Pseudopatriotism is back
Looking beyond the gloom or the hate we groom.
We destroy all we create
We'd rather send death and debt to our future
Than love and technology.
We live in a society with a fever for physical death or it don't exist.
Than the possibility of eternal life
Something that can be seen now.
The strange things that haunt our skies
Moving fast U.F.O.'s fly
With pseudo friends we always pretend.
The thing about it all is
I'll be deemed a terrorist for smoking weed
Pseudo nugs infest my lungs
Psychic wars will consume us all
Road rage will be the downfall of man
So drink super coffee
And get caught in a traffic jam.
this songs is inspired by daily life good or bad.
guest vokills by Keith  and Dirk  <start> Behold bastard son
I am the evil one
No glory to be reached
No more thy slavery
The passion I besieged
Spawn terror
Smash thy will
Ye pale dominion fades away my
Will dominates
And watch my star arise
Burning up the earth
Sun the eye of gods
Threw into the space
Watch ye moon eclipse
Falling from thy grace
Watch all nations cry
All feared of his name
Praise the flame
Watch angels falling from the skies
Praise the flame
I killed thy god
My will is done
Thou art lord
Rise me rise me high
Lead through the gates of sun
Rise me rise me high
Where angels do not dare to fly
Invite to feast of gods
And let me drift away
Leave flames of infamy
And watch me kiss the stars <start> I have freedom
I have Jesus
you want freedom
you need Jesus
america  land of free
america  show your freedom to me
look at us  I hate our little circles
look at us  we steer away from the troubled world
Jesus  gave us the chance to be free
Jesus  we killed him and nailed him to a tree
satisfied  with these tissue paper living lives
satisfied  your fine while everything goes right
but I don't want to be a part of that
I'm not into it I see the waiting trap
I have Jesus I'm truly satisfied
because I know for he died
who has the real freedom now you <start> Orally force fed until cirmosis is induced
Fatal renal failure bleeds like a sluice
Spewing blood as the gallbladder extrudes
Alcoholic poisoning bloated lobules burst
Toxins flood the stomach in diffluence submerged
Coughing waste as the wrecked colon tears
The blood now critically proof
Neural cells fatally quenched
Drowning in split retention
Hepatic tissue ferments
Poisoned retention with intoxication
Inflamed nephrons burst your condition's getting worse
Chronically diffused your liver you will lose
Bodily distillation as emerged flesh reacts
With alcoholic contents in your urinary tract
Dripping fluid as the decrepit appendix weeps
Matter turns to fluid intoxicating ablution
Bilary dehydration as innards turn to solution
Bleeding urine as the inflamed bladder rips
The blood now critically proof
Neural cells fatally quenched
Drowning in split retention
Hepatic tissue ferments
Contamination foul circulation
Alcohol force fed goes straight to your head
Brain tissue damaged fused with alcohol sewage
In a stupor you die your brain lobes you fry
In a stupor you die your brain lobes you fry
The blood now critically proof
Neural cells fatally quenched
Drowning in split retention
Hepatic tissue ferments <start> All the things you've been told that you keep inside
Find it easy to hide
I want to know what divides you
I only want you to lose
For the fear lives inside you
Listen to the sound
Of your dreams
Like whispers they scream
Wake me from my sleep to find the
World's on fire
Trying hard to reach and still I
Can't get higher
This can't be a dream you see it
Cuts like wire
Wake me from this dream I want to
Burn
Cada cosa que guardas dentro de ti
Es difcil mentir
I want to know what divides you
I only want you to lose
For the fear lives inside you
Listen to the sound
Of your dreams
Like whispers they scream
Wake me from my sleep to find the
World's on fire
Trying hard to reach and still I
Can't get higher
This can't be a dream you see it
Cuts like wire
Wake me from this dream I want to
Burn
Wake me from my sleep to find the
World's on fire
Trying hard to reach and still I
Can't get higher
This can't be a dream you see it
Cuts like wire
Wake me from this dream

Wake me from my sleep to find the
World's on fire

Trying hard to reach and still I
Can't get higher

This can't be a dream you see it
Cuts like wire

Wake me from this dream I want to
Burn <start> Rising he who was subdued
committing acts of protest
their speech of lave is misconstrued
he will put it to the test
Rejecting rule that's obsolete
their influence won't last
he won't accept to taste defeat
their power is part of the past
Contradiction false disguise
abusing faith of man
he has how seen through their lies
ignores that he is banned
Now... stop looking to the skies
no entity of light will help you
now... who created who
Did man create god
No palace in heaven
no life for eternity
these medieval beliefs
can't reign eternally
the men in power
suffocating wills in a society conformed
in their ivory tower
arranging master plan for our society deformed
Rise now you who were suppressed
think with your own minds
don't let yourselves be oppressed
your own path is what you must find
Religion is but a means of manipulating people
it's time we face it we are but animals with brains
stuck on this rotating globe of space
life is but a random outcome to biological processes
as is the human race... <start> Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same
Will it make it easier on you
Now you got someone to blame
You say
One love
One life
When it's one need
In the night
It's one love
We get to share it
It leaves you baby
If you don't care for it
Did I disappoint you 
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth 
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without
Well it's too late
Tonight
To drag tha past out
Into the light
We're one
But we're not the same
We get to carry each other
Carry each other
One
Have you come here for forgiveness
Have you come tor raise the dead
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head
Did I ask too much
More than a lot
You gave me nothing
Now it's all I got
We're one
But we're not the same
We hurt each other
Then we do it again
You say
Love is a temple
Love a higher law
Love is a temple
Love the higher law
You ask me to enter
But then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on
To what you got
When all you got is hurt
One love
One blood
One life
You got to do what you should
One life
With each other
Sisters
Brothers
One life
But we're not the same
We get to carry each other
Carry each other

Viscous juices gush and bleed
You're gutted skinned and mangled
Enteral disorder is freed
Tour ribcage wrenched and torn
Still pumping heart is crushed and smashed
Your alimentary canal is finely chopped
Lumpen meat is hacked...
...Disembowel chop and trash...
Veins are stripped and flayed
Of haemorrhage bile and sweat
Savoured cuts are cured
Bodily parts are wrecked
Bissection of the twisting corpse
Copious blood is drained
Captivebolt and poleaxe
Shred trash and maim...
...Dismember carve and hack...
I rip open pectoral cavities to devour my stillsteaming grub
Drinking adeps and effluence smearing myself in congealing blood
I tear at sauted crackling to guzzle on fetid swag
Butchered remains are carved and collected in a doggybag...
I mince up your limbs offcuts and cartiledge
Stuffing freshlydrawn intestine with grated coronary arteries
I slice from your mutilated trunk runny fats and rind
Skewering eyeorbits brain genitals and organs I grind...
Bins of torrid offal where writhing stomachs squirm
Chunks amongst your thighs and rump crawling with tapeworm
Snapped spinal column is gnawed curdled trypsin turns into to cheese
Your vena cava lashed on your pericardial sac I feed...
I gourge myself on your loin erepsin and brine consumed
Blubbering escharic tegument steaming remains turned into grume...
...Cranial fluids sucked...
...Flooded organs crushed...
 You are totally wasted...
Your dissected shell collapses as I eat congested insides
Disregarded entrails fume and rot now host to hungry flies...
...Cranial fluids sucked...
...Flooded organs crushed...
 You are totally wasted...

...Slow bissection makes me laugh... <start> All throughout the centuries existing year to year
Lives on this powerful entity to thrive on pain and fear
A derelict of heavenly gods a feeling from within
Weakened minds are perfect prey corrosion will begin
Some won't fight the battle is forsaken
Show no might the dark side has awakened
Even in the holiest the curious can be found
Their wonderment is dangerous as virtue is but bound
Moral codes broken
What's the sin that lurks within the burning emotion of hatred
Some won't fight the battle is forsaken
Show no might the dark side has awakened
Wicked mystic
Hatred lurks in all of us no one is exempt
It's proof of evil in our souls is this the tempter's intent
A derelict of heavenly gods a feeling from within
Weak minds are perfect prey for corrosion to begin
Some won't fight the battle is forsaken
Show no might the dark side has awakened

Upon your ever shining armor

It seems like you outrun me every time
I want to be you
Why can't I erase you from my mind
Looking from a distance
The difference seems so small
Has the grass been greener
On the other side at all
I don't wanna be like you
It seems like you outrun me every time

Don't tell me what to dream
Why can't you feel this all the misery and the pain
The selfneglect the values...have driven me insane
Its time to remember the reason that you were named
The gallant acts from which from which we all came
Don't tell me what to dream. don't tell me
I'd rather go it alone than stand next to you
Don't tell me. don't tell me what to dream
Don't. don't tell
Don't tell me what to dream
For what I survived no stomach
For the lies you say and do...you say and do
Make no mistake I see what is here
The emptiness of your words comes alive
The facts are evident your actions are clear

Something you may find
Searching the whole World
It's inside your mind
Digging a hole deep
Deep inside your soul
It's the season
It's the place to go
You want a holy war
You want blood on the shore
You want to live your life

That we broke so take note
'Cause you're not gonna fall
So get up and revoke

Why <start> Your hair reminds me of a time when we once were
Your fingernails that marked my back now rot in earth
The sheets we slept in blew away and now the storm is over
The taste of you inside my mouth remains but still I'm hearing
There's no love everybody's crying
There's no truth everyone's misguiding
And now the end is here
There's no more pills to swallow
The bitter taste I feel won't lead me to tomorrow
Your scent reminds me of a place I used to go
The kisses placed upon my neck show signs of no return
The bed we fucked in smells the same but now the stench is fading
The taste of you inside my mouth remains but still I'm hearing
There's no love everybody's crying
There's no truth everyone's misguiding
And now the end is here
There's no more pills to swallow
The bitter taste I feel won't lead me to tomorrow

Fighting for nothing is what you were born for

Cries for anger Lies for power

Fighting for nothing is what you were born for <start> Overturning tombstones
Marble cracked and crushed
Fucking on the top of a crypt
Smoking angel dust
Drawing blood spill it forth
Seep into the ground
Stomping through the babies' graves
Pummel every mound
Little coffins dug up
Tiny corpses emptied out
Impaled on the fences
Spikes rammed through
Rotted pumpkin heads
D.C.
E.C.
We pulled some more corpses
bigger ones this time. We'd lay
'em down on a grave one at a time
and take a big huge piece of a
headstone we broke....and smash the
head like a rotted melon
Graveyard desecrated
Rotted mess behind us
Broken bodies scattered
Amongst broken stone and glass <start> Fiends of the gods to war we ride
Over the black mountain far over ice
Fields of war before us now ride by my side
Ride by my side fire
Warriors of the north hold your swords high
Ride forth the stallions black all free under sky
You <start> When it comes to teks I'm similar to a menace
Like ol'dog sniffin caine couldn't fuck with the damage
That I do to a bastard keep playin around won't be nobody strong enough to 
Yeah I leave 'em in shock
People got sentenced to life they stressed in the box
Most of my friends got murdered and damn I feel lost
Wish I was there when they popped off to 
Nobody but me I got a whole gang of killers but that's how you gotta think
If you want to make it alive all in one piece
It takes much more of them things to 
Yeah yo sonny I'm well connected in the streets
We loyal to each other when it comes to that beef we get 
Don't worry 'bout a thing dun dun I foreverly 
Chorus
Even when shit gets hard I'm going to make sure that I'm around to 
Will never leave yo side till the day I die I'm gonna 
Recognize this game can be hard as long as you roll with me we are 
Here by yo side to  
Yeah yo when the time is worst
Never leave my fam in a jam I'm dyin' first
Never  to my last dollar I'm grindin' first
Never take the stand on my fam I'm silent first 
It's goin' down feel me alchemist in the flesh
And I love this profession but I'll throw it all away in a second cause I'm 
For the cause when my life is threatened
Take this and maybe that will 
Now you know how we cooks the pot up
You could get up in some things you would not want to so slow 
And watch how I mold the sound so when I ain't around the music still 
But I'm a keep my eyes open yo I don't even blink
Keep my pen movin' down the line I don't even think just write it 
On the paper get my vocals in sync
Check how it sounds

Chorus
 <start> The day will come and nothing will be heared.
That's the great silence.
This will be the day of retribution for all the pain and injuries the
mankind has caused to our mother earth and at the same time the day
of deliverance of the earth and of all suffering souls.
All will be silence.
Not a single human voice no human beeing
conceited about it's ability to speak can make a single noise.
It seems that the Creation swallows the dull routine of everyday
life to get attention for the imminant apocalypse at hand.
The biggest machines and factories
built from human hands are quiet dead and insignificant.
And nature all living creatures all the growing and blooming
things the water and the air will be silent. But not dead.
Deep inside the Creation a noise is growing which has never been heared
before born of the the pain and the suffering of every living creature.
One can not hear it but you can feel it in your bones and the whole
world is shaking because of it. Penetrating and it rises up to a river
of screaming draughning everyone and everything. Nothing will be left
and in the end there will be a great silence and eternal peace <start> Whirling dust in morning air
Two warriors in the ring
With the strength of two great bears
They make their weapons sing
Sparks fly high when steel meets steel
And no one can believe
That these two men are best friends not enemies
They lash out with ferocious force
The fight grows more intense
But each avoid the other's sword
As if by seventh sense
Their muscles ache their bones are sore
But none of them will yield
They fight a twoman practice war as enemies
Faster stronger
Fight until your dying breath
Fiercer harder
This is a matter of life and death
Full on fight in training
It's the way of vikings
Every muscle straining
It's the way of the Jomsvikings
These men aim to shatter
It's the way of vikings
This is how we battle
It's the way of the Jomsvikings
Whirling dust in morning air
Two warriors in the ring
With the strength of two great bears
They make their weapons sing
Sparks fly high when steel meets steel
And no one can believe
That these two men are best friends not enemies
Sun beats down with intense heat
The swordsmen start to break
Pain shoots through their tired feet
With every step they take
In this fight of iron wills
One man takes a knee
The other goes for the kill like an enemy
Faster stronger
Fight until your dying breath
Fiercer harder
This is a matter of life and death
Full on fight in training
It's the way of vikings
Every muscle straining
It's the way of the Jomsvikings
These men aim to shatter
It's the way of vikings
This is how we battle
It's the way of the Jomsvikings <start> The bowels of my thoughts icy lake
Drain emotions from my bleeding soul
Tears that follow burn my skin
Dread to see myself I ain't me
The sun encircles my shape on the ice
In my shadow I see the people below
Their frozen faces staring blank
All crying without a sound
Thousand degrees below
Ice age has begun Subzero
Emotions running low
My heart is so cold Subzero
Hatred in words spewing from their mouths
Verbal injection of a freezing void
Sunrise in three directions
As all their faces turn to laugh
Thousand degrees below
Ice age has begun Subzero
Emotions running low
My heart is so cold Subzero <start> In the genesis of the world
Just the arctic wind was blowing.
Something came into paradise
The everlasting snow melted away.
Arctica
You start to think there is something greater than humankind.
Arctica
The world is crying and the streams are telling how things went wrong.
Sorrow and worry of humankind
Sad stories to find.
The world is growing ice again
Covering the faults of the human race
Arctica
You start to think there is something greater than humankind.
Arctica
The world is crying and the streams are telling how things went wrong. <start> And another morning
With a peace I cannot find
Didn't heed the warnings
Of a past I left behind
I turned my head for too long
And now it's time to look within
Through the scattered ashes
Of this life that's worn so thin
I'm out of my head I'm losing my mind
You think you've found the answer
Well I'm looking for mine
A wasted life of wasted prayers
Trapped in this Hell and no one cares
Nowhere to run no place to go
This human bomb's set
Ready to blow
A faceless opposition
To a world that's laced with sin
Clawing at their steel doors
Yet they refuse to let you in
Just another human setup
On their rise up to the top
Mark my words
When I scale up there
I'll be the one to make them drop
No one shall hear your cries
And now will you be missed
A new day's dawning
With great pride I pull the switch
I'm out of my head I've lost my mind
You think you've found the answer
Well I've found mine
A wasted life of wasted prayers
Trapped in this Hell and no one cares
Nowhere to run no place to go
This human bomb's set
Ready to blow
Vicious tunnel vision
I've grown numb to your bite
Lethal ammunition with no choice left
But To strike
There is nothing you can do
No wish or faith will pull you through
Apologize Well it's too late
Now Suffer your ferocious fate <start> I heard the nations are threatened by crisis
A curse from east where the demon rises
The sin is changing the face of this earth
While we are waiting for the darkest birth
The coming vision
Was our decision
Can it be
That all we need
Is a resistant breed
The harming cast
Flourishing fast
Can it be
That this is it
The final exit
No
There is no way out of guilt when you free the deceiver
So wont you wont you please spread disease Nikita
No
There is no way out of guilt when you kill a believer
So wont you wont you please spread disease Nikita
Politics shaped the organic statement
A lifeless planet as a final judgement
The sickness in me is the sickness in you
The bitter response to the things that we do
Angry virus free us please
From the scum on this earth with a painful disease
Angry Nikita if this won't be
We will destroy ourselves one day else you will see <start> I break the chains of unbelief
Burden of millenial slavory
Forest eternat wander
Extending beyond earthly dimensions
Gods will return to their graces together with me
They'll find their oaken kingdoms as before
I free my powers when yelling silently
When I fight... thousands of demons follow me 
And my strength and my spell...
And my beautiful pride
Will find and wrap you will raise majesty to the skies...
From the depths of the earth deep and black
Through the forests woods and shadows
 Will penetrate lakes and wolfish mountains...
On the wings of demons to skies 
I denude golden gates of my Nawia
Shrouded in thick smoke of burnt bodies
I show my love... I praise the might
.. And destroy with the power of thunders
constantly destroy
On my right hand  fire eternaly devoted
Together with the strength of thunders
Will dance as before
The conflagration death and misfortune let it beget
Rebuild what was ruined
Destroy what was created by the cross
And my strength and my spell <start> NO STRESS

Behind the walls of the darkest place we'll see the Angel fall from grace
Witness the end of flowing tears the final chapter of our dreams
This lonely figure charges still revenge fire within
We are so close we feel their pain these brothers lost won't remain the same
On wings outraging we must slain win our freedom again
We came so close we feel their pain we are so close they feel our return
This is our time our brothers were left behind a silent and broken race
Shall we prevail in fight we'll turn the wrongs into rights
The Angel will fall from grace
Fire burn in the dark winter sky this madness will come to an end
Endless bliss for the children of Light the Giants will rise and defend
Each fallen calls a thousand more a frantic carnage with no end
Behind the walls of the darkest place we'll see the Angel fall from grace
Close your eyes feel the dreams are fading The Godsent supremacy
Close your eyes now the dreams are ending Let's embrace our legacy
The gates of Morken lay in sight this war is coming to an end
Behind the walls of the darkest place we'll see the Angel fall from grace
Witness the end of flowing tears the final chapter of our dreams
This lonely figure charges still revenge fire within
We came so close we feel their pain we are so close they feel our return
This is our time our brothers were left behind a silent and broken race
Shall we prevail in fight we'll turn the wrongs into rights
The Angel will fall from grace <start> this is the last chance you got
open wide
we both know we're both gonna die
but there's a difference with you
and with i
you want peace but refuse the fight
so shake hands with change tonight
Bathe in armor
for death feeds
O'death
don't bother me tonight
Be grace
Oh my God and stand still
Be grace
Oh my God and send more minutes
For Churces have nuns
and cowboy's have guns
and everyone's waiting to die <start> Violate your anus first
Fuck your eyes out fluids burst
Lubricate my growing thirst
Drill a hole right through your skull
Your body's laying dead and still
Pump your brain until it's full
Soaking your mind with my seed
White meets grey eyesockets bleed
My love dripping down your cheek... <start> Conquer god and remove his thought crush the lord above
bring upon our given right and rule what once was ours
kill spilling the blood of their priest
back into the mouth of the beast
death bring them all down to their knees
tell no one they have to believe
die demons of evil repel
christ dragging his cross back to hell
you will die
walk the realms of blasphemy shadow in the night
sacrificial son of god darkness is the light
suffrage for the sins of eve not to understand
masticate the inner peace never known by man
angels of the realms of hate predicate the plan
demons of the underworld cast you to the damned
wading through the agony sanctified by god
destined to the crucifix on the temple mound
angels rebel god defiant
angels of hell satan
angels rebel fuck compassion
angels of hell kill you
angels of hell
a revelation that has come to life has got you by the balls
the word of god is no longer the way his word has been dissolved
kill spilling the blood of their priests
back into the mouth of the beast
death bring them all down to their knees
tell no one they have to believe
die demons of evil repel
christ dragging his cross back to hell
you will die <start> Wake up
Do I need these things that I'm asking for
So I'll give up
And turn in the dreams that I've been sold
You'll never know
The lines that were crossed
Just to make it home
So I'll cover up
The fear that I'm not there for anybody
Wish I was
Getting used to this
Every chance I get I let it go
And every moment spent is not enough
Wish I was
Getting used to all of this
I'm looking down from the edge
Would I do it again
Would I trade the world that I know now
For a day that I don't miss you
I'm looking down from the edge
Would I do it again
But it's getting hard to understand
Why I'm wide awake but barely breathing
I've spent all my energy
Justifying my failures at close range

Pull the trigger I've been such a waste
Neglecting life and love it's one in the same thing

Wish I was
Getting used to all of this
I'm looking down from the edge
Would I do it again
Would I trade the world that I know now
For a day that I don't miss you
I'm looking down from the edge
Would I do it again
But it's getting hard to understand
Why I'm wide awake but barely breathing
I know I've got so much to lose
For me to turn my back on you
The writings on the wall we were meant to fall
Don't regret the life we chose
Looking down from the edge
Would I do it again
Looking down from the edge
I'm looking down from the edge
Would I do it again
Would I trade the world that I know now
For a day that I don't miss you
I'm looking down from the edge
Would I do it again
But it's getting hard to understand
Why I'm wide awake but barely breathing <start> I watch the sky turning black
And know the time is fast approaching
My clan they all look to me
I turn away I face the ocean
In the dark I see a fleet of longships on the horizon
Again the Vikings come to this land they are a poison
Archers ready your bows swordsmen ready your blades
Gods be with us this night as we stop this barbarian raids
Their boats now pulled to shore
Scrawny men pour forth from the hull
Their faces look ailing and drawn
But their minds are bent on the cull
On they come these viking raiders pale and grey
With withered bodies and swords to slay
Charging forth from filthy ships towards our line
But we are butchers and they are our swine
By ready men they fast approach the time is here
Stand firm at your line and show to fear
From the north this army comes to raid our lands
But instead tonight they will die by Gaelic hands
I give the call to attack and we charge towards the Vikings
Arrows scream over head and begin this night of killing
I watch as the armies collide flesh and bone gets torn asunder
So many of my warriors die as they stop viking plunder
In the distance I see their leader so wretched and vile
Leading his men with pride I see his weakness and I smile
Caught up in his stupor of greed I slice his head from his neck
His cowardly men run away victory is ours this day <start> Maquinas del diablo

A tortured life is spared of vision
And it's painful when it's worn
The cloak of shame spares no protection
His world is made of steel
In his hands he bent the fire
To mold a thing so real
A burning world born of desire
Chorus
His hope was not enough
To fill an empty cup
He simply let it drain into the nowhere
There is no reckoning
There is no bargaining
In symbol rain will fall as he lays weeping
We stand below rinsed by the tears
Unlike rain they bring no healing
Rust corrodes the souls
Of children wrought to match his image
Abandoned with all of his cares
No choice but to wait for the kindness of time
To erase us one and all
To flow like a river with no beginning
Head in hands and weary eyes
The failures scratch and carve the lines
Into the face of one
The lines into the face of none
He sees the world
He sees his dreams
And nothing's ever as it seems
The promise was so real
Now all that's left is crumbled steel
No prayers are said in his name
Nobody knew that he ever existed
Alone he accepts all the blame
Plaintively wonders how dreams become twisted
And he waits for another to come
Another a chance to revive from the nothing
The fabric to weave once again
To forge from the fire his vision of man <start> conductor of ashes
the structure of fear
mythic malignance
the realm of screams
the sacrifice is formalized
by demand of his dreams

Man I couldve been cold but I was days away.
I shouldve been bold and not bought into every word youd say.
I couldve been hard and fought like all the rest.
I shouldve been smart and not reached to comfort you with my best.
But II got sucked in.

If Im a jerk Ive been this way since birth.
And its you that makes you hurt.
Ill make you realize you realize
Im a jerk and Ive been this way since birth.
And its you that makes you hurt.
Ill make you realize you realize that.

So I couldve been wrong to offer you my help.
I shouldve been strong and left you there to handle things yourself.
I couldve been gone by a clever some disguise.
Ill be the one you who holds you here and makes you realize.
Its youyou suck me in.

If Im a jerk Ive been this way since birth.
And its you that makes you hurt.
Ill make you realize you realize
Im a jerk and Ive been this way since birth.
And its you that makes you hurt.
Ill make you realize you realize that. <start> Nights I spend awake
Waiting for the sign
Days never ended
When will the time arrive
Far beyond my sight
Hiding in the dark
A semblance of a feeling that was lost
But now is found
As I take a look around me
Never did I feel so lonely
In the dream
The voice had told me
Now it's time
For A Different Story
Ever will I know
What lies inside my mind
Searching through my pride
I find no place to hide
Blindly still I go
And leave the past behind
Faithfully embrace the light
As I take a look around me
Never did I feel so lonely
In the dream
The voice had told me
Now it's time
For A Different Story <start> awakening from dreams that are too real
you know just how the killer feels
tomorrows nightmare is haunting you
a shield of terror you can't get through
you keep denying your reality
open your eyes and you will see
that you are chained and can't break free
you are dying for a dead belief
search you soul
find your hell
trapped inside a human shell
blessed with the will to kill
murder flows through
like a drug in your veins
twisting your mind
like a rasorsharp blade
no sanity
no fucking will to be
you kill yourself
smiling
you are dying <start> A bullet to the sun.
Erase everything we have done.
Please like a thief won't you come
Put an end to all of this fun.
I will see you in a Broadway year
a New York second a Wall Street minute
A Hollywood moment.
This is it.
Why does not this world just stop <start> So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
'cause nothing else matters
Never opened myself this way
Life is ours we do it our way
All these words I just don't say
'cause nothing else matters
Never cared for what they do no
Never cared for what they know no
But I know
So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
'cause nothing else matters
Never cared for what they do no
Never cared for what they know no
Never cared for what they do no
But I know
Trust I seek but I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
'cause nothing else matters oh
So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
'cause nothing else matters

first started studying the powerful
hallucinogenic LSD
as a kind of chemical weapon
it might use during an armed revolt. <start> You're tossing and turning
You think you're awake while you're trying to run
Like in a nightmare
Time loves your ego to death
You're leaving the wheelwork to the ground of being
You go on
Defying temptation in the engine room that is ourself
I feel a storm is looming with a shaking grumble
I don't know if I'm right or wrong
I don't know if I shall go on
I don't know what I'll believe but I'm on my way
Minds fly free when the gates fly open
Walk on through thunder and rain and the wind in my face
Ghostlights dance will you heed the token
Glazing light blinding my eyes get me out of this maze
The world as we know it is beginning to shake
I don't trust my eyes are we all superstitious
If we think what our hearts know is true
Fireworks surround me
wherever I go they tell me always home
psychosomatic they'll name it the nature of god
Off to a new horizon
Time is the key to unite with the all
Time is gonna make you see right from wrong eternally
Don't let the noises devour you
Minds fly free when the gates fly open
Walk on through thunder and rain and the wind in my face
Ghostlights dance will you heed the token
Glazing light blinding my eyes get me out of this maze
And what if you're only a prism for the ghostlights that you wanna see
And we're just reflections of your dreams
It's speaking to me
It's yelling at me
It's screaming to me resonating with me
And a thousand lights are trying to make me see
They call me home
Minds fly free when the gates fly open
Walk on through thunder and rain and the wind in my face
Ghostlights dance will you heed the token
Glazing light blinding my eyes get me out of this maze <start> As the sky's a flame he stood high upon that hill
Only him to blame on his limbs this frozen chill
That calls on him the glow's beyond these mountainsides
And creeps his skin he prays for sun he prays for light
Now he fears so deep the second coming of a day
Just to fall asleep his skin still covered by the haze
That veils his eyes and in the crimson light of dawn
His life's demise  a stillborn child there in his arms
Chorus
This son of mine  Take me
Broken his eyes  Break me
A life for a life  Freeze my heart beneath this new horizon...
As the sight grew clear a sparrow glides from far above
For to touch so dear oh this tiny child my love
A lifeblood's leave as the beam caresses its wings
It sings the tune calling lost life from deep within
Chorus
Taking this side for to give him some time  breaks a day
Changing a light is a barter of time  seals the way
Chorus <start> Caught in a Woodsleep
Miles Down the Crypts Beneath
Desert Sands lay Deep
Sworn to an Obscure Belief

You know you've really been so blind.
Now's your time burn your mind.
You're falling far too far behind.
Oh no

I'll take you to burn <start> Once I was there standing outside looking in
Beside my window smiling face shattering
It's an old man's pride that climbs over understanding
It wasn't your child that I was hurting
And I turn my back to the world well I don't care
What can I say if I see you all as dead
And I turn my back to the world well I don't care
What can I say if I see you all as dead
Under the dying sun it comes weaving fear but I have none
I know that mushroom cloud won't come very near
What do you have to believe in and all the poison you breathe in
The crystal heart shatters within
Once I was there standing outside moving in
Inside my window crying face shattering
Take all that you have and leave the rest now for today
It's the old folks' sign that took away your chastity
And I turn my back to the world well I don't care
What can I say if I see you all as dead
And I turn my back to the world well I don't care
What can I say if I see you all as dead
Under the dying sun it comes weaving fear but I have none
I know that mushroom cloud won't come very near
What do you have to believe in and all the poison you breathe in
The crystal heart shatters within
Shatters within
Shatters within
Shatters within

Ahh Dance through the cold shadows of Pan
as tears fall from heaven...
once I had hold the rarest rose
But that is now forgotten with time...
Among the tree's I wandered
To feel the embrace of etemal eclipse
as my candle bums out
And we must make the myths...
Dark is the moon at harvest
the nightly mist approaches
through the forlorned marshes
Then darkness has now been achieved...
Crush your earthly virtnes
As I stumbled through snow and frost
my feeble heart is longing for the wood
where all dark cast a shadow....
It's pale morrow landscape
Has now risen through the bleak night
over the moors and mountains
Flies the hunting ravens... searching
Dance through the cold shadows of Pan
As tears fall from heaven
Then once I had hold the rarest rose...
Frozen is my pagan heart
And once again the dawn is here
hear the sound of silence
In these trees....
Are my gallows.... <start> Raven's eyes are staring at me
While flying in the wind
Bright white pearls all around me
Magic's in  the trees
My December  deep inside of me
My December  my heart of beauty
 vapor over level of the lake
 silent glow of the moon
 crystal love in the white cold grace
The snow falling down on you
My eyes my soul my heart
My December I'm soul of ice
I felt the sorrow when a man came to me
And broke my heart to satisfy his dreams <start> Feeding on angles of the human mind
We transform thoughts into mental food
Sucking the will out of your untouched soul
Your energy feeds our world
On the wings of inferno we thrive
The extraction of impiety we drink
The carrion of sanity we eat
The sulphurous air we breathe
A hallowed world reality to some
Dimensions grotesque abnormal to thee
A spectre of the wind incantation of chaos
Beyond bewilderment the realm unseen
On the wings of inferno we thrive
The extraction of impiety we drink
The carrion of sanity we eat
The sulphurous air we breathe <start> On the first day of Gehenna
the shrieking winds shall be silent
and when a black sun hangs from a somber sky
Caine's sleeping children shall again arise
When antediluvians awake from eons of slumber
the strongest of us shall fall prey to their hunger
countless storms shall quake the earth
as the world turns icy cold
On the second day of Gehenna
our father shall return
and unite his wretched kindred
to the ebon throne of city Enoch
The vile culprits of diablerie
shall meet their deserved fate
to drink the scarlet tainted from the Firstborn
eating away their breathless bodies
And there shall be battle
Queen Lilith and me the bastard
fiendish legions ascending from the ground
And on the third day shall be silence
the next millennium antediluvians rule
but shall be borne a woman bearing lunar mark
the only key to our salvation... <start> I am the igniter destroying all your dreams
I am the deceiver I'll take away everything
The reason why these clouds will burn bright
And the stars will cry out when block the light
Even the sun will weep
When it wakes to find that it's no longer
The bearer of such luminous light
Now sit back and watch your walls collapse in flames
And this i swear
This was all to see her eyes shine bright
And this I swear
This was to save my pitiful life
I won't try to escape the disaster
That slowly takes over the walls
And our senses engulfed in the flames
I create to try and match
The color of her face
And this i swear
This was all to see her eyes shine bright
And this I swear
This was to save my pitiful life
It was far too much for me so I set this place ablaze
My mind set on the thought of hope and the seduction of change
Now sit back and watch your walls collapse in flames
And this i swear
This was all to see her eyes shine bright
And this I swear
This was to save my pitiful life <start> Please help me

Two terrorists dead.
Would you like to know what the diagnosis was
Some kind of electrical discharge.

Two terrorists dead <start> I check my hand it's shredded and bleeding
From holding broken glass punching echoes in the face
Can't see you eyes covered not looking your ice blue eyes pierce like
Lightning through the space
Thirteen arrows tear tunnels right through me
My fingers stuff the holes but the bleeding it persists
Check my mirror its cracking distorted
My vision could be questioned but the visage no doubt mine
And now I'm teasing with these rattlesnakes
I'm kissing cobras on the head
I roll the dice despite my past mistakes
Only the lucky end up dead
I'll face the pain but the pain ain't mine
I shouldn't walk this late at night
Asking for trouble when I climbed that fence
I'm out of my mind she's out of sight
Hey mom I'm going out tonight so put my calls on hold
Now joey no fights tonight I'd bet shed wish I was
Hey mom I'm going out tonight so tell em' I'm not home
Now joey no trouble tonight how does she always know. <start> The lowest form of life that's crawling in our streets
From seedy dope pushers to the politicians we meet
The sorry religious vomit that infests in our TVs
The weapons that we sell to the trash in the middle east
Murderous drug smugglers pay their way to pass
They look the other way when they take the kickback
We've got to put a stop to this senseless bullshit
Take all these people and throw them in the pit
Let us know  where our tax dollars are spent
Tell us how  how much it costs to repent
Time has come  for us to take a stand
Let us know  when you meet our demands
You can take this all to hell
Shove it up your ass where the sun ain't shining
We know now what it takes to defend
If disaster strikes then they'll be hiding
You can take this all to hell
Shove it up your ass where the sun ain't shining
We know now what it takes to defend
If disaster strikes then they'll be hiding
Corruption
From laundering money to hookers on the make
There's always a scandal someone's on the take
They payoff for secrets sell plans to a spy
They cover their asses and say it's a lie

Indecent disease it's they who are to blame <start> Underneath the bridge

A cold grin for those damned at my door
My hanging heart for your product of war

I know that youre still there waiting. I see you all

Then begun the time of dark and I let you all crush

Look at me look to your hunter just take your time

Through the olive groves
And vineyards
Insects like aeroplanes
Fly past the strolling man
Crackling spike plant
Hovering hawk
All on the ground alive

Listen to the madness whine

Bulls and purple bees
Listen to the lone wolf
Strolling
Take a swig of moonshine
Taste its heady wine

The morning star has long since gone
The sun is high in the sky
Shadowless a figure stands
Stranded on venus sands
Up in the blue and circling
The seabirds watch and wait
For movement of a certain kind
Down on their dinner plate
Where children played
A flower lays
Pulled and torn up by its roots
And where it stood the empty space
Just screams...................................................................
Down on the flats baby turtles race
For safety of the big deep
And white caps come crashing in
Indifferent to tender flesh
Shriek of attack then moving in
A raucous clash a gourmet din
Of cruel gull beaks and tearing skin
Screaming...........................................................................
Lit by the evening star at venus sands
Against a blood orange sky
There's a shadow of a figure prone
Abandoned and all alone
Venus sands <start> Empty discordance.
A social illness plagues humanity
Corrupting civilization continuously
The era of Anno Domini is in decay.
Deepest sympathy for the future spawn of Earth.
Open your eyes open your mind
Ignore the words of the fucking beguiler
They are deceitful scum
a disgrace to the procreator.
Deepest sympathy for the future spawn of Earth.
Empty Discordance.
DOWN ON YOUR KNEES.
Time for awakening
Take a stand
cast a shadow upon the ironclaw of tyranny
Let's overcome this plight. <start> Give us this day all that you showed me
The faith and the glory till my kingdom comes...
Give us this day all that you showed me
The power and the glory till my kingdom comes
Give me all the stories you told me
The faith and the glory till my kingdom comes
And they say that in our time
All that's good will fall from grace
Even saints would turn their face
In our time
And they told us that in our days
Different word said in different ways
Have other meanings from he who says
In our time
Give us this day all that you showed me
The power and the glory till my kingdom comes
Give me all the stories you told me
The faith and the glory till my kingdom comes
And they say that in our time
We would reap from their legacy
And we would learn from what they had seen
In our time
And they told us that in our days
We would know what was high on high
We would follow and not defy
In our time
Give us this day all that you showed me
The power and the glory till my kingdom comes
Faithless in faith. we must behold the things we see
Give us this day all that you showed me
The power and the glory till my kingdom comes
Give me all the stories you told me
The faith and the glory till my kingdom comes
Give us this day all that you showed me
The power and the glory till my kingdom comes
Give me all the stories you told me
The faith and the glory till my kingdom comes
Till my kingdom comes
Till the kingdom come <start> Vocals performed by original singer Wayne Knupp. Music  Lyrics written by Mike Majewski
Here I come
They call me
A beast like none before
I suck the abscess of dead infants
I want some more
I Am Baby Killer
I kill pregnant sluts and whores
Splaying inside the womb
Red and wet I tear chunks from the pussy Red and wet mangled unborn baby
Eat the meat dripping from filthy...
Cumstained bloodsoaked rotten cunt Infant skull exploding in my mouth
It's brain on the floor
I grab it's tongue and tear it out
Dead meat for me. I can't believe
How much this baby is bleeding
It's tiny stumps pours out more
Than it's dead mothers open sores
It's guts paint the floor
It's flesh I shall gorge.
It seems feasting on young infant flesh has made my semen leak.
I am aroused. Fuck I'm crazy
I fuck the blood. I need meat on my cock.
No meat can satisfy me. I must spew my seed
Spunk flows throughout the mangled infant. now I'll chop it up
Chunks of guts fly as i stand with baby skin all over me
Forcing the bloodsoaked gore unmercifully down my throat
Pieces of baby are lodged inside of me
Over and over I feast on it's death
It's all gone. I want some more
I turn to it's mother
Blood is still flowing strongly from her butchered pussy
I drink from her fountain stench of menstrual gore
Gagging on chunks of sliced up pussy
I feel pressure....
Pushing in my brain
The force caves in my head
My eyes eject slowly
Where's my knife
I plunge my knife in
Inside my head
My veins are seeping
Warm streams of red
My tongue tastes so horrid
I must swallow it
Gore taste so scrumptious
Enough to wash it down with piss. <start> Froten and still I stand
Through these rooms of emptiness
The void in my hands once more
Awaken to see another day of greyness
Armless and numb
All emotions now are gone
I burn another page
From the book of my memories
The way I follow has no return
I'll face this journey alone
In every night and in every breath
You'll drown in the wastelands of my soul
No other words are left
No reasons to explain
My scorn as a farewell message
Only silence now remains
Negativity
Surround me in Your cold dead embrace
Rape my spirit with Your divine sickness
Blind is my soul I sold You my life
My faith shines in every wound
Fanatical cynicism leads my way now
We're nothing but tools under Your eternal spell
My true belief 
Slave to Negativity <start> Two rushing shades meeting face to face
Dull procedures come and go everyday
A thousand tricks and one thousand smiles
But life is not profound
An endless tide of ideas and belief
It's a mess 'cause nobody thinks or feels
The sky laughs loud entertainment for free
We are nothing
Gain all we gain is trivial nonsense next to nothing
Our merit is failing whenever we can
We are so precious yes we are so precious
But I say we are next to nothing
We are nothing next to nothing we are nothing
A friendly smile hiding misunderstandings
I see your mask but your soul I can't find
A thousand lost days two thousand new ones
Tunnel's light or dead end
Another night and even more days to come
And I've to look into mortal faces
It's just an act of regret and farewell
We are nothing
Gain all we gain is trivial nonsense next to nothing
Our merit is failing whenever we can
We are so precious yes we are so precious
But I say we are next to nothing
We are nothing next to nothing we are nothing
I look at you and wonder
Is it me whom I see
I am one of those mortals too
I'm lost as well as you

I look at you and wonder
Is it me whom I see
I am one of those mortals too
I'm lost as well as you
Where is my sympathy
I'm not one of those
Who're loving life loving life eternally
Gain all we gain is trivial nonsense next to nothing
Our merit is failing whenever we can
We are so precious yes we are so precious
But I say we are next to nothing
We are nothing next to nothing we are nothing <start> I woke up today with this feeling
That better things are coming my way 
And if the sunshine has a meaning
Telling me not to let things get in my way
When the rainy days are dying
Gotta keep on keep on trying
All the bees and birds are flying 
Never let go gotta hold on in
Nonstop 'til the break of dawnin'
Keep on movin' don't stop rockin' 
Get on up when you're down
Baby take a good look around
I know it's not much but it's okay
Keep on moving anyway
Feels like I should be screaming
Trying to get it through to my friends
Sometimes it feels that life has no meaning
But I know things will be alright in the end
When the rainy days are dying
Gotta keep on keep on trying
All the bees and birds are flying 
Never let go gotta hold on in
Nonstop 'til the break of dawnin'
Keep on movin' don't stop rockin' 
Get on up when you're down
Baby take a good look around
I know it's not much but it's okay
Keep on moving anyway
When the rainy days are dying
Gotta keep on keep on trying
All the bees and birds are flying 
Never let go gotta hold on in
Nonstop 'til the break of dawnin'
Keep on movin' don't stop rockin' 
Get on up when you're down
Baby take a good look around
I know it's not much but it's okay
Keep on moving anyway
Get on up when you're down
Baby take a good look around
I know it's not much but it's okay
Keep on moving anyway
When the rainy days are dying
Gotta keep on keep on trying
All the bees and birds are flying 
Never let go gotta hold on in
Nonstop 'til the break of dawnin'
Keep on movin' don't stop rockin' 
Get on up when you're down
Baby take a good look around
I know it's not much but it's okay
Keep on moving anyway
Get on up when you're down
Baby take a good look around
I know it's not much but it's okay
Keep on moving anyway. <start> I'm drifting off into nothingness
So terrified of what will be
Tomorrow is the day I can't back out
But I'm scared of what will happen to me
They say a simple procedure
It's supposed to be all so routine
But what if the doctor was evil and very very mean
Just call me doctor just call me pain
I'll show you horror that you've never gonna see again
Pass me the scalpel pass me the knife
You don't need no medicine cause I'm gonna take your life
Please wake me out of this nightmare
I've got to get out of this dream
A victim of the Dr. Psycho
Like nothing that you've ever seen
As I begin to cut you screaming out in fear
There's no one to help you no one's gonna hear
This ancient operation extracting part of the brain
There's no way to turn it back
You're never gonna be the same
Thought I'd be in a cosmetic bliss
Now I smell the stench of my own piss
All I wanted was to look real good
Just one more chance I'll leave it like I should
I am the doctor and I'll kill your pain
This is my specialty extracting part of the brain <start> Hear me ancient forefather 
Honoured be Thy deeds
Leading our tribes against the aggressor
Outnumbered a campaign that could not be won

Gracious Spartan civilisation
Eternally blessed Thy war spirit
Surrounded by thousands of Persians
Molon lave a final proud statement

Noble was your cause brave Vercingetorix
Sad the day of your sacrifice
An example to your Celt tribe
Dying in solitude
 forever in my heart
Remember the moment Jerusalem fell
The shrieks of the conquered the conqueror's yell
The roofs that we fired and the plunder we shared
The wealthy we slaughtered the lovely we spared
Aris And Aris shone
Mars And Mars rose
Geuzen der Lage Landen
Van Antwerpen Amsterdam tot Den Briel
Helden der Calvinistische droom
Nachtmerrie der SpaansRoomse overheerser
Voor eeuwig Uw bloed in onze aderen
Noble was your cause brave Vercingetorix
Sad the day of your sacrifice
Hear me ancient forefather Ambiorix
Honoured be Thy deeds
Leading our tribes against the aggressor
Outnumbered a campaign that could not be won
Forever Thy blood in my veins
Noble was your cause
Sad the day of your sacrifice
An example to our tribe <start> It's not enough to listen
It's not enough to see
When the hurricane is coming
It's not enough to flee
It's not enough to be in love
We hide behind the word
It's not enough to be alive
When your future's deferred
When the voice goes unheard
And your sons go on with song
And the one thing you loved the most
Now stands on the Altar
Drenched in blood <start> I Hordaland ska hrmenn fella blot

A life thrown under the wheel.
As each day passed I never looked back
Just a beat down body with a mind intact
Counting days inside my head
Set the trap stab my back then walk away
Framed and judged left behind to take the blame
Slam the door cut the cord and cast aside
I don't care what it takes you're fucking dead
I never used to be so full of hate
It just grew and grew by the hour and day
Dreams of death cold revenge
Now any means justifies the end
All of my thoughts set to kill
I'm never gonna stop
Until I have your head
No matter how long whatever will come
To end your life is my reason to live
I'll haunt and hunt you down
Traitor of the brotherhood
Defect and run a once and future failure gone
A trail of schizophrenic lies follow your forgotten steps
As fake laughter hides the serpent tongue behind your breath
Veracity expelled you thrive on your deceit
Lying comes with ease just like your allconsuming greed
The stroke of midnight passed the penance hour nears
Each nerve alive with fear an omen of your ending coming fast
Subjected to a beating
I'll choke the life out from your eyes
Subjected to a beating
Only when you're dead can I be free
And God won't hear you fucking scream
Cold blooded homicide is what it takes to be sure
To put my fist to your face and spill your guts out on the floor
Like a thousand red stabs of pain for each day I was locked away
You'll taste every ounce of blood as it pours out from what used to be your head
No redemption
No regrets
No excuses
Only death
Execution so long coming finally attained
Gasping out last words uttered only were my name
Pure revenge all consuming perfectly arranged
Satisfaction pure elation nothing else remains
But one less fucking human on the Earth <start> Hope was always a friend of mine
My trust in life won't ever slip by
No way No I won't
be afraid of the road in front of me
Times are changing I'm not
Even if it confronts me with reality
The shackles are tighter
The top's even higher
We need to be wiser to move on
Why don't you let us
live our lives Let us be who we are
While you're stuck in here for us nothing's too far
Can't fool our thoughts we know what's going down
And one day we come out of the background
Why don't you let us
live our lives We don't believe your lies
About the future promised to be clear and bright
Let us live  And fool yourself. That
everything's alright
Oh god. Nothing's alright <start> Here she comes down as her wings get nailed to the ground
A polaroid of shame
The last angel's pathetic fame
The face of deceit with nails in her feet
She's a preacher deprived from her voice
A punctured lung is creating noise
The cry that she made was the cry of a dying child
The revocation of empathy
The sound from a million dreams and scars
Termination Bliss
Blessed under a lie Her last little weak why
The bloody end of a dream
Slit the throat and taste the cream <start> Welcome to the evil side
Spread the word nationwide
Come and drink this blood of mine
It will increase your metal spine
I promise you join us now
You won't scream
Don't be scared join the force of steel
We are all United
We will spread the word
All United
We can change the world
Help us roll these thunder wheels
Metal warriors never kneel
Stand up proud prepare to fight
Scream out loud your metal rights
I promise you join us now
You won't scream
Don't be scared join the force of steel
We are all United
We will spread the word
All United
We can change the world

We are all United
We will spread the word
All United
We can change the world <start> So let me wake from this nightmare
This is so wrong
Now when you're gone
What should I do but shed my tears
All night long
This should not have happened
Not this soon
I can not be whole without you
You know
Al the times you yelled at me
Correcting all my faults
Taking care of everything
At least now you are well and free
This is your funeral
It's at its last sheds of tears
So now when I'll make my mistakes
Where will you be
But in my dreams
You were gone before I called
Gone before I tried
Before I realised
This is your funeral
So now I'll make myself
I'm without you numb
You were gone before I called
Gone before I called <start> Please cut this noose. Untie these hands for me. They will insurrect my former self. Hide behind your failed design. Perfect its imperfections. I'll carry out the plans of old. I'll dig through the remains of my ruins. Unearthing something truly remarkable once hidden by your opaque heart. I'll carry out plans of old. Digging through the remains of my ruins. From this day forth your love will poison no longer. A strange suffocation enticing existence. It's comforting the artificial life. A ghostly bliss without your kiss. Never grasping what you've hoped for. Your translucent hands pass through the sunlight. You'll never feel that loving glow. Damned to be deprived of the blissful warmth of heaven. As you dissipate into the shadows. <start> When I'm sad I remember you
When you are sad what can I do
I've met you and I knew the joy
I want you to feel a lot of joy
Even if a wind blows you must not lose
You look good with a smile than tears
At anytime I offer words of cheer
I keep my promise never lose Ah
Trust It can change our lives and support your life
Fate You can see the matter in the correct light
We keep believing our future world
It was getting to be daylight
I wanna know what you expect
I want you to know what I expect
I've met you and I knew the fun
I want you to feel a lot of fun
Even if you hesitate you must not lose
You have an important thing
At anytime you are looking so good
I keep my promise never loose Ah
Faith It makes our bonds strong and support your life
Blessed You will be always given it and it's your life
We keep believing our future world
It was getting to be daylight
Trust It can change our lives and support your life
Fate You can see the matter in the correct light
We keep believing our future world
It was getting to be daylight <start> The time was a dispassionate observer
The frost was penetrating his thoughts
It saw what was hidden inside
His cold kisses made her blind
It was better to pretend that
She didn't know the truth
Even Though she knew
Beyond the shell of her body
She hides her bloody tears
She has hnown the taste of grief
She knows what it is like
When the world falls to pieces
The shapes and shadows
Of their trembling bodies
Plaited in love embrace
This view is engraved in her soul
Her love sleep in the cold ground
The shapes and shadows
Of their trembling bodies
Plaited in love embrace
This view is engraved in her soul
The pain is a painter of artificial smiles
written by P. Maslanka <start> Feeling anxiety. Lost reality. Things I can't believe.
Things I've seen. Wrapped in a dream. Are not
relieved. Persecuted all my life for lies I haven't
done. A fugitive on the run. What did I do wrong
Searching for evidence to clear my name. Piecing
together the truth day by day. Closing in fast. Got to
move. I cannot stop. My frustrations are burning
inside. The expressions I can no longer hide. A
challenging quest for freedom must not waste anymore
time. The past and present is my future. All
accusations are false. Father I pray for my sake.
Help me before I'm caught. Intentionally accused.
Intentionally accused. Living in total secrecy.
Changing my name constantly. Hiding my images in
disguises. Going from city to city. Within nobody's
reaches. A total stranger in the crowd. It's up to me
to be free. Can't go on living this way. Intentionally
accused. Intentionally accused. <start> Bullet EaterWarslut
From the dawn of tim
Man has always sought to allay his fears
From the demons without and the demons that surely lurk within
Don't look for a rhyme or a reason to the story
Now is not the time the season no glory
Don't look for a moral or right to this tale
Don't look for a saviour for your weak and your frail
For I am the War God
There are many bridges to be crossed
and many more to burn
I would sooner see you dead than hear your poisoned words
Slain upon a battle field your voice cannot be heard
I would suffer a thousand a thousand years in silence
My advice to you is a message in violence.
'cos I am the War God
Though the tale is over the song remains the same
Gods and idealism forever call our name
So we rise upon to the mount with Kings at our Command
To turn the endless cycle of the savage bloody hand
And it's hard to see into the night when your eyes are blinded by the light
And it's hard to learn from the past when the past is a whore to the last
And it's hard to hold back the Hate <start> She said she'd never been never been touched before
She said she's never been this far before
She said she'd never liked oh to be excited
She said she'd always had had to fight it 
She said she's never been never been balled before
N' I don't think yeah she'll ever ball no more 
Hey squealer when I held her hand
Squealer Made her understand
Squealer when I kissed her lips
Squealer and sucked her finger tips
Squealer she started getting hot
Squealer made it hard to stop
Squealer it got too much
Squealer I think I've got the magic touch
Squealer it's time to sin let me in <start> When the sun has wept upon the waveless lake
And the mists steal in with ease
Covened wolves are their eerie dissonant napes
In adoration of the moon and thee
They call as I to thee
And I will come as if in dream
My languid dark and lustrous Malaresian Queen
Of vengeful ancient breed
Gilded with the pelts of many enemies
Erishkigal ravenhaired
Thy seduction haunts the castle in erotic despair
I can taste thy scent by candlelight
Legs of porcelain traced and laced to their lair
Appease the beast on spattered sheets
Dyed unearthly red as sobriety weeps
Nocternity
She shall come for me
A black velvet painting sprung to elegant life
Like a poignant Madonna perverted to night
And I have ridden from the westerning light
To expend my lust
Tear away the funereal dress
Know that I will escape from my death
Surrendered to the splendour of her sharpened caress
Lo The pale moonlight
Weaves a poetic spell of vital death and decline
Of mist and moth and the hunger inside
Kisses took to fever and the fever demise
Through twilight darkness and moonrise
My scarlet tears will run
As stolen blood and whispered love
Of fantasies undone
Countess swathed in ebony
And snowwhite balletic grace
Rougefilmed lips procure the wish
For lust and her disgrace
Dusk and her embrace
We shall flirt through the shadows
Like a dream of wolves in the snow
Under deadly nightshade
Still warmed with the kill's afterglow
Beneath the stars thy flesh bedevils me

Bequeath to me thy fiery kiss
To sever thin mortality
Elizabeth
My heart is thine
Thy fragrant words Warm within like wine
Let me come to thee
With eyes like Asphodel
Moonglancing loose desires free
To writhe under my spell
Ereshkigal ravenhaired
Thy seduction haunts the castle in erotic despair
I know thy scent by candlelight
Immortal flesh I yearn to share
Appease the beast on spattered sheets
Dyed malefic red as sobriety weeps
Nocternity
She shall come for me
Unfurl thy limbs breathless succubus
How the full embosomed fog
Imparts the night to us <start> I work the graveyard shift cadavers lay silently in wait
My utensils are ready to perform degrading autopsies
Through the sinews of dead flesh
And within the dried marrow of old bones
I have discovered the secrets of the dead
Mercilessly I pit out what the dead cannot hide
I become enlightened with a knowledge that makes me strong
A power I now possess launches me into the afterworld
Traveling paths in the innermost niches of putrefaction
I will become a god of suppuration in this dead domain
But to enter the putrid portal I must frantically carve
Tediously I labor over crude necropsies bizarre necrotomy
My entire being soon liquefies as I cross over
I take on the form of foul cadaverine
Now through the perished hardened veins I flow
Immersed into the deceased where no life resides
Except for wriggling fat white maggots filled with smegma and decay
Apparitions haunt the viscera my presence they avoid
In terror they try so hard to hide
Disappearing into the offal of the btchered
When the dead go the way of all that is flesh
And the burdensome mortal coil is shaken off
Moving as I wish between the living and the dead
Carcasses are tenements for all spectral souls
An actual cosmos existing within a corpse
The morticians could not fathom what I see
Like a scalpel I cut my way through the necrosphere
Plunging into the deepest recesses of the carrion
They are unable to flee from my disembodied grasp
The dead scream as I infernally enslave them
Truly I am gifted empowered with necromacy
Originating in dead matter makes me necrogenic
The interior decomposed membranes of the stiffs from a necrosphere
Which has always remained unseen by mortal eyes
Until I found the concealed secrets of the rot realm
Now I am divine the dead now worship me
As if I am a god <start> The day the dream went right back to base
There was blood on the ground
Blood on the sand
Blood all around
Tracks of the ride of the bright murder hawk
The day the dream debased and went home
And the people did mill to those adrenaline rails
And everything stopped
The nurses climbed up
Our face paled
And there was no doubt at all
No two ways about it
Was the day Disney's dream debased
Saw a mouse who flapped at my wife
And she told him what
And she told him what had gone down
Who then did not know the extent of the show
The people had diedgave in the mouth of their ride
Disney
And Dopey and Mickey Brer and Pluto
Secretly prayed
And there was no doubt at all
No two ways about it
Was the day Disney's dream debased
Disney
Dark glasses on Western Union
Man the gates
The dream an innocent meets her fate
Far away from Appalachia and the city hate
The day X
When there was no doubt at all
No maybe about it
It was the day the dream debased
Disney
I remembered it from
The back of my mind
The tune that I wrote
In fallen dreams
Anthem to
Creator of all that had stopped
So there was no doubt at all
No two ways about it
It was the day the dream debased <start> Instru <start> about your policies
well i wonder
its crisis overload
and no wonder
falling we're falling falling
down this fucking hole
begin the slaughter and
welcome pigs
slop the bullshit welcome in
insert the blade
i'll stick and plunge
twist the fucking blade
bloodlust... kill all politicians <start> Creator of life. Guardian of the dead.
Goddess of battle and war
All of ye watch me. My sword by my side.
Proudly I sit on my horse.
And I wait for the sign in the sky to appear.
Telling me that the moment has come
For me to ride beyond the edge of this world
Into the realms where the shadows are strong
Gods of Thunder of Wind and of Rain
Valkyries my soul is yours should I fail.
Let my beheaded and battered corpse lay
And take me where you bring all Nordsmen slain.
Gods of Thunder of Wind and of Rain.
Hugin and Munin my eyes in the sky.
Heart of mine thrown in the pit of the snake
I will not need no heart where I go should I die.
Realms of the shadows bring me no fear
I may stand or be beaten and torn
The mountains will stand. But the life of a man
Was decided long before he was born.
Leaving the plains where my ancestors hunted
For meat and for hides against the cold.
Here the fire was tamed. Here our sword were made.
And here the elders amazing takes told
I ride into land few have seen or returned from
To tell of it's bleakness and dark
I see nothing but mist and the mountains so tall
I can't tell them and the sky apart
Gods of Thunder of Wind and of Rain
Valkyries my soul is yours should I fail.
Let my beheaded and battered corpse lay
And take me where you bring all Nordsmen slain.
Gods of Thunder of Wind and of Rain
Hugin and Munin my eyes in the sky.
Heart of mine thrown in the pit of the snake
I will not need no heart where I go should I die.
Realms of the shadows bring me no fear
I may stand or be beaten and torn
The mountains will stand. But the life of a man
Was decided long before he was born.

Let my beheaded and battered corpse lay
And take me where you bring all Nordsmen slain.
Gods of Thunder of Wind and of Rain.
Hugin and Munin my eyes in the sky.
Heart of mine thrown in the pit of the snake
I will not need a heart where I go should I die.













 <start> Road lies ahead
And a long road lies behind me
I see lights passing by
And I know it's the time of our lives
A million miles
Lightyears I've been travelling
To watch and enjoy this wolrld
And I've seen ass galore
I'm musing over it all
Closing my eyes to remember it all
Embracing the past and the future to come
Kiss the road that leads to my tribe..
I've found my way home
I'll return to where I belong
Back to where I stem fromback to Paradise
Time to return to the tribe
The other side  always close to the edge
Been walking a thin line
Always knew someone watched my step
A mistery to make it out alive and sane
The battle is over
And I know who's been with me..
Now I'm musing over it all
On top of this world I remember it all
Awaiting that sunrise and sunset at home
Kiss the way that leads me to my tribe
I've found my way home...
I've seen battlefields drunk drummers
Japanese hotel toilets
Piesel tuning guitars
And A.C. being my personal slave
Back to the tribe
I've found my way home
I'll return to where I belong
Back to where I stem fromback to Paradise
Time to return to the tribe
Tribe
I've found my way home
I'll return to where I belong
Back to where I stem fromback to Paradise
Time to return to the tribe <start> You're all alone alienated
Figure your thoughts. Do you make it
We can too it's in the heart
Set Yourself Apart
Figurize your views do you really
Or is it just security
We can too it's in the heart
Set Yourself Apart
Listen... to yourself
. The Joke's On You
The Joke's On You
The Joke's On You
The Joke's On You
The Joke's On You
It all started when I went to school
You were playing me as the fool
I laugh
We laugh
I laugh... at you
Screaming at me you're wasting my time
Your opinion is not worth a dime
I've been waiting for this day so long
That's why I'm writing this song
I laugh
We laugh
I laugh... at you
Because The Joke's On You <start> Attack Going in for the kill. Take none alive
Eradicate the weak. The strong survive
From out of the darkness comes the light
Through hollow eyes the truth is seen
Smash down the walls that stand between
The poison apple and the bite
They will do all that they must
To satisfy their bloodlust
Strike Either kill or be killed
Torn piece by piece
No one can tame. The nature of the beast
Vicious territorial instinct fight
Premeditated murder scene
Savior never comes it's a faded dream
Teeth sink in deep upon first bite
Their greed is so disgusting
Supremacy is rusting
Pathetic lies beyond the obscene
Filthy wounds seldom licked clean
The bloody wounds not clotting
The carcass slowly rotting <start> I am staring in glass
I see someone that is standing
Who looks a lot like me
Staring in glass I see someone
Standing who looks a lot but is not me
Just my split identity
The paradise throws me on ice
And I awake with a scream
Can't you see the light can't you see the time
That is cutting open my sorrowfull eyes
And I am a person who doesn't bleed
from a thousand wounds
I have finally overwon my life
With me go content and moral
and disappear forever
I have finally overwon life
The road I walk is grey
Without reflections full of delusions
And I don't know where I should go
In the mirror I see my infinity
My crying infinity
I am staring in glass
I am standing alone
And I am a person who doesn't
bleed from a thousands wounds
I have finally overwon my life
With me go content and moral
and disappear forever
I have finally overwon life
Right before me I see my solemn eyes
Looking in the mirror of serenity
They are shining so mysterious
and wide
Even already resigned
almost immovably
In the mirror I see my infinity
My crying infinity <start> In answer to your question i hope you have been asking
I'll take off my fangs and stop all the scaring
I could quote John  pray for the best
That you'd grasp what it all means that we are in a test
To know what sin is is to know how it permeates
The day of coming justice for all of us awaits
Darkest of our deeds passes not unnoticed
Now we go free following paths we've chosen
O Jesus Christ bleeding at Golgotha
It took God dying price paid for all
Validation on day three stone moved from the tomb
Confirmation of deity New Life out of cold womb
The gracious Work that asks for our trust
Eternity in the balance deeds not enough <start> All of the wounded that need to be saved
Looked for a handout beyond the gates
And I need to know if their blood was worth it
As we live this inferno and burn down to the bone
All of the arrows that plunge into prey
Are their promises of better days
And I need to know if their blood was worth it
As we live this inferno because I would rather...
Die on my shield die on my shield
As love's war rages on
 <start> Out of focus
Need to get a grip
So you don't slip
Into the realm
Of lifelessness
As you crawl through
The debris of the past
Feebly arise to one knee
Inhaling the treachery
Bearing witness to the actions you've chosen
Closed mouth unspoken
The fallen one
Sometimes you hate yourself
And everyone else
Go ahead and hate yourself
For not awakening your dreams
And nightmares
Screams to an immortal one
Supposed only son
Never sees the tears in your eyes
Never hears the ungodly cries
Behind the mask that you've worn
Bitter and scorned
Hourglass and mournful stillness
A tribute to sorrows passing
As time drips in endless
Melancholy and gruesome recollections
Through depths you've fallen
Unsurmountable odds of ascension
Succumbed by fathoms
Washed adrift suspended in grief
Never to lift your filthy spirit
Soul cleanse blank the imagery
It must be nice to have
The burden of thought
Whisked away
And let astray <start> Ooh my little pretty one my pretty one
When you gonna give me some time Sharona
Ooh you make my motor run my motor run
Got it comin' off o' the line Sharona
Never gonna stop give it up such a dirty mind
I always get it up for the touch of the younger kind
My my my ayeaye whoa
Mmmmy Sharona
Come a little closer huh awill ya huh
Close enough to look in my eyes Sharona
Keepin' it a mystery it gets to me
Runnin' down the length of my thigh Sharona
Never gonna stop give it up such a dirty mind
I always get it up for the touch of the younger kind
My my my ayeaye whoa
Mmmmy Sharona
Mmmmy Sharona
When you gonna give to me a gift to me
Is it just a matter of time Sharona
Is it dddestiny ddestiny
Or is it just a game in my mind Sharona
Never gonna stop give it up such a dirty mind
I always get it up for the touch of the younger kind
My my my ayeaye whoa

Oooooooohhh my Sharona
Oooooooohhh my Sharona
Oooooooohhh my Sharona <start> Lyrics by Fenriz January  <start> Intenacious intersecting
Reaving fats from corporal griskin
Culled...for sodden gelatine brayed
Skeletal groats triturated desinently
Exsiccated sere glutenate brewed
For frivolous solvent abuse...
Derogate coarse remains
For glue to dry
Despoiled marrow razed
A truculent shambles so severe
Extravated bone as adhesive incarnate
A pellucid quietus nocuosly I create
Corporal glue breathe in the fumes
Mucilage vapours toxic fumes to savour
Comminuted remains
As gum to dry
A lissom gel so glazed
A truculent shambolic affair
The exsanguine esprit shorted as snuff
Rheumic oils forever Bonded together as gum
Human glue choke on the fumes
Noxious vapours slaughterous labour <start> Worn out and nothing more to give
Who said that life was simple to live
The pain inside eats away at your pride
The price of friendship is sometimes high
But weak in pain
Is where you want me to be
But still you are
The one who'll always lose
I win you lose
Crack some lies behind my back
The time has come to start paying back
So here I come you pathetic shit
It's time to choose where the fist will hit
But weak in pain
Is where you want me to be
But still you are
The one who'll always lose
I win you lose
I called you a friend
I win you lose <start> I can see a crow on your judgement day
Seems like a sermon
Please come over don't come over
Please come over here
Welcome the last day of our lives
I will break the circle
Walls I'll tear them down
And guilt will break the silence
But there is no return
No return
We shall overcome
We will bring you back
To a moment in time
We will reveal and detect
What you are
Precious truth in a cage
It has been captured but safe
And there we'll bind it and
Blind it with lies
The king will come
World will come undone
He is the center of creation
The prophecy
It's a promise to us all
A crow a storm
Shadows will be rising soon
A crow a storm
The Nine sing
Once upon a dream ago
We're the ones you've left alone
Now as we speak
There's a way there's a door
Come find us and join us
Come see it and feel it
Doors in and out
You shall be falling
Your mind's still trapped in twilight
Now catch a glimpse
Shall I get through
They've walked on
To the other side
But how could I know
I'm drowning drowning
Where do I belong
Drown in shadows
I am the center of creation
The prophecy
It's a promise to us all
A crow a storm
Shadows will be rising soon
A crow a storm
The Nine sing
Once upon a dream ago
We're the ones you've left alone
Don't blame me don't blame me
It's my lying toad
The crow and the hare
They've moved further into the unknown
Mark my words
They will be gone
You'll see them playing games my dear
They've moved along
Cause one day in the afterlife
We'll meet again
They're frowning frowning
On your judgement day
They are shadows
They're in the center of creation
The prophecy
It's a promise to us all
A crow a storm
Shadows will be rising soon
A crow a storm
The Nine sing
Once upon a dream ago
We're the ones you've left alone
But don't be afraid
There's war beyond the red door
And please ignore their pleas
Just break the seal
Break the seal find the red door

Break the seal find the red door
The eternal
The infernal
The eternal
We shall better get him back
The eternal
The infernal
The eternal
Will we ever see the light again <start> Sleepwalking my whole life.
Wasn't until now I finally see the light.
Head spinning for some time.
Making an escape before I miss my time.
It's really too bad too feel like walking dead.
But now my eyes are open wide.
the sun don't always shine
When you're not alive
But now my eyes are open wide
Day dreaming no sun in sight
oh mister cant your see I'm losing my mind
Sleepwalking my whole life
wasn't until now I finally see the light
it's really too bad too feel like walking dead
But now my eyes are open wide
The sun don't always shine
When you're not alive
But now my eyes are open wide
it's really too bad too feel like walking dead
But now my eyes are open wide
it's really too bad too feel like walking dead
But now my eyes are open wide
it's really too bad too feel like walking dead
But now my eyes are open wide
The sun don't always shine
When you're not alive
But now my eyes are open wide
Sleepwalking my whole life
wasn't until now I finally see the light
Sleepwalking my whole life
wasn't until now I finally see the light
Oh mister can't your see I'm losing my mind
It's really too bad too feel like walking dead
But now my eyes are open wide <start> Oh God forbid this bloody war
I see my knights falling one by one
so here I am in this fight I'm alone
I'm stuck here in this hellhole on my own
Taste the blood tears of pain
Memories from the past strike through my mind
My royal blood begins to boil
Deadly wounds can't stop me now I still stand strong
I just can't die
Surrender is no option for me now
Bless those souls I send to hell
If you dare just look into my eyes
My steel is warm my face is stained with blood
One by one I hit them to the ground
One by one I see their heads roll
Anyone against me taste my sword
Anyone who'll challenge me will die
You killed my men raped my land and you ruined our lives
Still I stand in command in flames you burn
You will die by my hand forever you're condemned
'Cause I am in command in flames you burn
No it's no use for you to beg
I will send you down to hell
I can't die my faith is far too strong
In the flames of hell is where you belong
One by one I hit them to the ground
One by one I see their heads roll
Anyone against me taste my sword
Anyone who'll challenge me will die
You killed my men raped my land and you ruined our lives
Still I stand in command in flames you burn
You will die by my hand forever you're condemned
'Cause I am in command in flames you burn
You killed my men raped my land and you ruined our lives
Still I stand in command in flames you burn
You will die by my hand forever you're condemned
'Cause I am in command in flames you burn
You burn
You burn
You burn <start> Your rotten gore is still pulsating
All core of body is polluted
All your glands are vomiting with pus
All your insides are still pulsating
Stomach rectum kidneys and liver
All your organs are damned
Pulsating gore still attacks
Your insides innocent flesh
Your flesh is full of beautiful life
Inside tissue excretes enzymes
Veins and arteries are vomiting with blood
Giving way for pulsating gore
Stomach rectum kidneys and liver
All your organs are damned
Pulsating gore still attacks
Your insides innocent flesh
Rotten flesh dying body gift to decay
Pulsating gore inside of you no chance to life
Take grind scalp kill yourself don't suffer
Skewer eyes cut your veins don't take pains
You are dead your flesh is dead
All your insides are carbonized
Your disease
Rancid gore
You get effusion maggots eat your brain
Swollen urethra excretes aroma <start> Where's the future now.
Crush the humans to down.
Together tomorrow find us sound out.
We here remains in their claim.
Forever rendered. In forbidden signs.
Arise you should have never of go.
Arise the final blow.
No regrets today begins.
Tomorrow will end we all have to fend.
Where's the future now.
Trust the humans to down.
Together tomorrow find us sound out.
Arise you should have never of go.
Arise the final blow.
No regrets today begins.
Tomorrow will end we all have to fend.
Turning into seduction will you ever set me free
To bring in is always sin when you sit down decide my fate.
Arise you should have never of go.
Arise the final blow.
No regrets today begins.
Tomorrow will end we all have to fend. <start> On the slope of a naked rock somewhere in Skainawjo  the isles
of Skais  a blonde furclad man immortalises his memory of
Mannus the oldest Ing. A large manlike shape is engraved in the
rock bloodred in colour with a large phallus.
His hands are stretching toward the sky. Mannus the son of
Tuisto made sure his tribe survived the cold north together with
his sons Inguz Herminuz and Istwo. Tuisto's heart is warmed by
the sight of his descendants he knows the gods are not
forgotten. Then  he reasons  there is hope after all for the
coming generations. <start> It's stuck on repeat
Making me breathe
Ever so deeply inside
Am I sleeping
I've tried screaming
Nothing can keep me alive
It seems easy
Make believing
Leaving these feelings behind
It's deceiving
Guaranteeing
Nothing is seemingly right
Can't look away
Can't bare to watch but want to see
I can't escape
This flood that I jumped in
Without a trace
I vanish from the air I breathe
Last gasp I take
I thought nothing was something
The best thing to ever happen to me
Has now become the worst thing
It's still the same old story it's still the same old story
It still replays
All of these days
All of these ways
That it died
Paths that we made
Left to decay
All from betrayal and pride
Feels like DDay
When we stay
Like cars on freeways that collide
Let's be safe
And not retrace
Mistakes that we made throughout time
If I make it out alive
I'll make it my last goodbye
Still the same old same old
Still the same old story <start> The downhill slope I'm standing on is starting to hurt my feet
My neck gets stiff from staring up at the world
I'd show you all my self esteem
But I lost it somewhere down the road
Why is it everywhere I stand
Is a foot shorter than the space next to me
I can't see the action due to the crowd
There is never a horizon in my view
Like walking through knee high water
My steps through life are slow and hard
And I never seem to get all the way to shore
The longer I stand the deeper I sink
Why is it everywhere I stand
Is a foot shorter than the space next to me
I can't see the action due to the crowd
There is never a horizon in my view
I don't know if I'm down in the dumps
But it sure smells like
Trash to me
I don't know if I'm down in the dumps
But it sure smells like
Trash to me
Why is it everywhere I stand
Is a foot shorter than the space next to me
I can't see the action due to the crowd
There is never a horizon in my view
I don't know if I'm down in the dumps
But it sure smells like
Trash to me
I don't know if I'm down in the dumps
But it sure smells like
Trash to me
I don't know if I'm down in the dumps
But it sure smells like
Trash to me <start> Locked away I'm hidden from your sight
Forced to live in artificial light
Made to suffer because of what I'm not
A casualty in a war that must be fought
So here I wait like the ones that came before
And when I'm gone they'll need a thousand more
You've decided that my life is yours to take
So now I'm trapped in a world I did not make
Chorus
Let me go
Leave me be
Stop your tests
Set me free
In my cell I'm waiting for your test
What hidden law makes you better than the rest
You feed me drugs and see what you have made
Day by day situation growing worse
You weren't content to let neture take its course
Now you suffer by the toxins that you use
Terrified by the fate that you helped choose
Repeat chorus
Solo Skowron
Repeat verse
Repeat chorus <start>

 <start> A cherry sunset blossoms
But we're not there to watch it fall
On the vacant canvas we should be waiting
With our face down on the grass
Staring till our eyes give way
Let's paint this city black
While the night's still young
You
This cherry sunset withers
Our words as frail as paper
A dawn I thought we'd never see
Alone on this silent beach
Nothing we can do
There is nothing we can do
The sky it burns itself
The sky it burns itself
The sky it burns itself out
The sky it burns itself
The trees rot down to nothing
Throats dry out and corpses fill the sidewalks
These promenades our graveyards
The sky it burns itself out
The sky it burns itself out
There is nothing we can do
The sky it burns itself
And I think we're all about to fucking die
The trees rot down to nothing
Throats dry out corpses fill these sidewalks
These promenades our graveyards
Kneeling down on what's left
Sacrificed upon doom's day
Oh if we could take it back and see one last twilight
Take a picture take a picture
Take a picture take a picture
Take a picture
Take a picture take a picture
Take a picture take a picture
It will last longer
Our hands in prayer formation
Our elbows on the bed
One last try for Heaven
Thinking who wants flowers when you're dead
You're dead
When you're dead
Cherry cherry
Cherry cherry
Cherry cherry
Cherry cherry
Cherry
A cherry sunset <start> A bolt of blazing gold
Lifted from the horizon's edge
Another radiant dawn sends new hope
Avowed my hearty pledge
My yearning to be part
Of nature's truthful solitude
Of wisdom's inner light
That shines in mystic multitude
The guiding source within
So few of us will ever know
And few will ever climb
The great worldtree from which we've grown
But those who seek will find
The rhythm that vibrates high and far
And rearrange the cosmic threads
The pattern of the Weave of Stars
A bolt of blazing gold
A sunfire in zenith hurled
Oh wingless skydancer
Rejoiced upon the warmth unfurled
What wonders do you hold ensnared
With your mighty heart
What secrets may be mine
To brothershare as we depart
Of richest emerald forged
My soul still rises longingly
From inferno's winding caverns
Through dark air soaring restlessly
If silence was enough
No words can grasp my starkest thoughts
No language known to man
Portrays my naked sentiment
A bolt of blazing gold
Swallowed by the waveless sea
The oceanwinds set sail
In breeze towards their destiny
On solarbeams they rode
White seagullwings in harmony
For a moment's startling glimpse
A siennaburnt tranquility
Oh father of the coloured sky
Unwear thy robe of shadowhood
Let nature's soul once clash again
'Neath blooming glades of goldenwood
We're the ones who seek
To dance to fallen serenades
The magic hymns of gold
As softly sung the sunlight fades away
Of richest emerald forged
My soul still rises longingly
From inferno's winding caverns
Through dark air soaring restlessly
If silence was enough
No words can grasp my starkest thoughts
No language known to man
Portrays my naked sentiment
A world of silent stone
As frozen in the nightly sky
In heaven's dark recesses laid
No living soul draws night
For seconds all is still
No moonlight heaves throughout the dark
Nor do the heavens breathe
No dryads wreathe within the dark
Within my dark domain <start> Hey princess
I'm your knight in shining armour
Come jump on my horse take a ride with me in the starlight
My fulgend lance will hit the dragons  the robbers
My sword will keep this dream alive
I don't wanna wake up  I don't wanna wake up
Keep this dream alive
I can't get enough so let's go for another ride
I wanna sing  I wanna dance
Let me take you all around the world tonight
In my dream I am king
So don't you ever dare to wake me
I might loose the one
Heaven's sent so save me
My queen  Pristine
With grace as pure as the driven snow
I try to keep this dream alive
I'm your knight in shining armour
Get in the saddle
I'm gonna show you my world
I wanna sing  I wanna dance
I just wanna fall in love tonight
Let's escape into the beauty of the night
Cause when the morning wakes me all this will fade away
Yeah I gotta keep this dream alive
Oh oh oh I don't wanna don't wanna don't wanna wake up
Come on let's keep this dream alive
I don't wanna wake up  I don't wanna wake up
Keep this dream alive
I can't get enough so let's go for another ride
I wanna sing  I wanna dance
Let me take you all around the world tonight
I'm your knight in shining armour
Get in the saddle
I'm gonna show you my world
I wanna sing  I wanna dance
I just wanna fall in love tonight <start> Dangling above a vat of putrid muck
A rancid stench of foul decay never encountered before
Screaming in horror for I now remember my fate
I will be submerged in boiling flesh
This cauldron will soon take my life
Upside down my mind is warping
Cannot break free
From the shackles
Bloodied chains cut circulation
Losing reason
Gag and vomit
Blisters are forming all over my body now
Oozing with pus as they start to explode fervent finality
The fumes and the vapors have perforated my lungs
Writhing and twitching from maddening pain
Why must I die like this
Insanity not far away
Mental breakdown
Scathing havoc
Pray for death to come and get me
Inner anguish
Begins
Fear
Received
Relentless
Malignancy
Near the end is what I'm sensing
Must accept it
Can't accept it
Last attempts to stop this nightmare
Cannot be done
I will be dead
Gone
Berserk
While waiting
My life will boil
To struggle is useless
Plunge
Fatal
Paradise
Of the obscene
Enter the tank
It doesn't take long
Epidermis dissolved
All that's left are my bones
It's a matter of seconds when defleshed in flesh
My body now part of sick mire
This chamber of liquefied humans that I have amassed is completed because I was last in line <start> Have you ever sinned yourself oh reverend
Pointing your finger at the masses
Paying retribution for all shit gone wrong
Have you ever sinned yourself oh reverend
We'll cut off a finger
For every sin you've committed
We'll cut off an ear
For every lie we hear
We'll cut out your tongue
Swallow the spikes
Your stiff corpse
Will be fed to the worms
How many times
Have you betrayed
Christ and your god
Whatever his name
They've left you now
Left to die
It makes no difference
You're dead now

Enjoy your last supper
We'll cut out your tongue
We'll make you swallow the spikes
Till your stuffed and done <start> All this is seen in black and white
This storm this sea
A violent inferno out of nowhere
Devil painting my soul black
Your blood flows in my veins
Master of rats leader of bats
You are the sun you are the moon
You are the wind that sweeps this land
I will cross with glory and pride
The sunset that never ends
The wave that never stops
The tree that never grew old
Darkness and pain forever reign
You are my brigtest star in the sky o Shaitan
I gave my soul and I will burn
A river of madness a path of sin
The pit of horrors that you showed me
Is where I will dwell and stay in command <start>  <start> 
Sunlight is pouring all over me
The cracks in the window blinds
Tell I'm free
But in the night when fear paralyzes
Allowing no pathway to see
Weighted eyes close and blood pressure rises
I'm traveling where this slumber leads
Into dark crawl inside your mind
To worlds hidden by night
Visions and nightmares or just another dream
One step away from the light
They say to ignore most of what
I might find there I fear I'll
Spend most of my time there
Dream control is so hard to achieve
Mastered through some evil scheme
There is one way followed without fear
Make Jesus the Lord of your dreams
Out of the dark and into the light <start> torn up into pieces at the bottom of a downward spiral
with only yourself to blame and only yourself to change
you've got to find your strength
catch your breath in the cruel light of day
and you end up betrayed at the end of the world
erase the thoughts experiences and feelings that you had
at the end of the world
you need to feel how the wind fans the waves
how the tide heals all wounds
for the moment you wait until you find your own way
you can hardly breathe your heart is bursting
you can't regain what's gone
and you feel so betrayed at the end of the world <start> Let's go
With blood shot eyes I watch you sleeping
The warmth I feel beside me is slowly fading
Would she hear me if I called her name
Would she hold me if she knew my shame
There's always something different going on
The path I walk is in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on
Can anybody help me make things better
Your tears don't fall they crash around me
Her conscious calls the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall they crash around me
Her conscious calls the guilty to come home
The moments died I hear no screaming
The visions left inside me are slowly fading
Would she hear me if I called her name
Would she hold me if she knew my shame
There's always something different going on
The path I walk is in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on
Can anybody help me make things better
Your tears don't fall they crash around me
Her conscious calls the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall they crash around me
Her conscious calls the guilty to come home
This battered room I've seen before
The broken bones they heal no more no more
With my last breath I'm choking
Will this ever end I'm hoping
My world is over one more time
Let's go
Would she hear me if I called her name
Would she hold me if she knew my shame
There's always something different going on
The path I walk is in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on
Can anybody help me make things better
Your tears don't fall they crash around me
Her conscious calls the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall they crash around me 
Her conscious calls the guilty to come 
Better
Your tears don't fall they crash around me
Her conscious calls the guilty to come home  <start> There is no end game so whisper the truth and pass on the blame
Just put us out of our misery
This defeat is a victory
We're burning out we're fading away
A failed evolution
Is the problem the solution that they've been searching for
We're waiting for the world to save itself
'Cause nothing is built to last
We're writing our epitaph
So reset and start again
'Cause we all know how this ends
Before long we'll be dead and gone
A thorn in the side of the earth
Where do you draw the line
A flaw in the design
The rest is history
This defeat is a victory
We're burning out we're fading away
We're all guilty as sin
I feel it I feel it under my skin
Always up in arms without lifting a finger
Lifting a finger
We may be infinite but this world is not
Something that we once knew that we long forgot
We're waiting for the world to save itself
'Cause nothing is built to last
We're writing our epitaph
So reset and start again
'Cause we all know how this ends
Before long we'll be dead and gone
We're all guilty as sin
I feel it I feel it under my skin
Always up in arms without lifting a finger
Lifting a finger
We may be infinite but this world is not
Something that we once knew that we long forgot <start> Tomorrow is chamber of sadness griefing for today
When the prophets break so unfeelingly the ray of my luck.
And I my hand rear to you kissed by pain
To forever take down from mute mouth the bitter fruit of my wailing.
I interweaved by aure of despair
I judge that the joy is only punishment for me
Only load of other disappointment
Which I can't already bear anymore.
Also sorrow me dresses dresses me in his tearful clothing.
On this distressful way on which is obvious to pity.
I on crossway of joy and sadness my mind search
If the pleasure sheer fief is and the kingdom is the sorrow
I interweaved by aure of despair
I judge that the joy is only punishment for me
Only load of other disappointment
Which I can't already bear anymore. <start> instrumental <start> Burn your bridges bite your tongue
Dig your own grave what's done is done
What's in your head what's on your mind
Time will tell don't look behind
What I keep inside my head is stuck right on my mind
And time will tell if I should look behind
Hold your head up hold your head up high
Hold your head up hold your head up high
Hold your head up hold your head up high
Hold your head up put up or shut up
Two steps forward and one step back
The time will come when you lose track
Speak your mind or sell your soul
Stand tall or fall down in a hole
I've got to speak my mind before I sell my soul
I've got to stand for what I am before I fall
Chorus
It's to late I guess what's done is done
I'd rather dig myself a grave than bite my tongue
So I take two steps forward and then one step back
I'm not afraid of losing faith I'm scared of losing track
Chorus <start> We're back again
Let's make a toast Come raise your glasses high
To everyone of you who doubted us
We're back again
Let's make a toast Come raise your glasses high
To everyone of us sinceKarma's A Bitch Right <start> Ich reite die Schlange und erfand den Schakal.

Or so it seems
Is there a place you're runnin' to
Don't like it where you are
Life is oh so hard
You feel like runnin' somewhere new
The things that wait for you
Isn't what you want
Who you think you'll be
Is not who you'll become
A face a face
In the dark
A face a face
In the dark
So when you left your home
You didn't leave a note
Were things there that bad
It's lonely running blind
You're running out of time
My friend you look so sad
The things that wait for you
Isn't what you want
Who you think you'll be
Is not who you'll become
The things that wait for you
Isn't what you want
Who you think you'll be
Is not who you'll become
A face a face
In the dark
A face a face
In the dark <start> Who's world is this Who's maddening world
Is this turned upside down or is right side up
With peaceful lives now put at risk
It's thickening it's so sickening
Might makes right but within our short sight
We can't see this light has no end in sight
We stand on our freedom
To destroy that which we protect
Cutting our throats to save our necks
And it's thickening it's so sickening
And if it would end would this madman be your friend
When the cost is the freedom lost lay down
And you can tell me that you have heard
Now tell me what's going on
And you can tell me all that you have read
Now tell me what's going on
And you can tell me that you believe
But what the fuck is going on with this world
Madmen roam this earth I'd be a fool to say I approve
When they refuse to give us anything but untainted views
I don't trust one word
Pax Americana infidelis will be the next cry of the world
Hold on to what you've got hold on to all you've thought
Four hundred billion won't buy us peace of mind
But just keep that to yourself
Who are you to say we've got nothing to fear
Once we've wiped the board clear
When madmen become kings
Stand clear <start> 
I am an angel of darkness
Abhorrent to those who are frail
The strength inside me is my will to believe
In myself with no selfbetrayal
My force is my own preservation
My destiny mine to control
I don't live my life to be judged by anyone
Surviving intact is my role
Lost time is never found again
Screaming through my life of speed  insanity mach ten
I utilize the life I've been given
Or else it's as if I've never been
I take pains to make my presence known
If it's a negative impression then I'll take the blame alone
I have no regrets and I call my life my own
I have no time for the words left in stone
I acknowledge only one thing
My own authority
Answering to no one I leave no trace of pity
My independence rules my life
I can't help what you are
For this I won't apologize
Because I leave scars
I promise you agony
If you attempt to intervene
Just pay attention to yourself you're barely existing
I'm thriving on the life I lead
A veteran of human wars
For this I won't apologize
Because I leave scars
I practice angelic darkness
My convictions keep wolves from my door
I know what it means to have someone tamper with my dreams
Deflowering my essence my core
I once sought no recrimination
But now I seek the price be paid
Forever wary always guarded against anyone
Who's mistaken me for easy prey
Defeatist attitudes are only in vain
As you wonder of my species  must I really be explained
Realize now that I'm ingrained
Knowingly forever on your brain
Nemeses falter in their plebian ways
Employing methods to usurp my reign my inner maze
Seeking clues to uncover the clever turn of phrase
Salient words are found amidst the haze
A mercenary I may be I tend to feel I'm not
My only need is to maintain my lot
I have a lust for life that stands to be my legacy
I'm proud to say with my life I am free
To leave a mark necessity my memory redeemed
I suffer not from lack of selfesteem
Someday my confidence will be a mass contagion
I assure you this is no selfexaltation
I cicatrize myself upon your mind
You won't forget my actions as you will find
I'm lord and master
Of my own future
I am the darkest of angels
Indomitable in my will to succeed
I have a goal to ascertain
Entrenching myself upon your brain
These words I've bled upon this page
Have come from inside how quickly I've aged
My innocence has died and was buried long ago
Eternally joined with a part of my soul
The weak of heart need not apply
I admit they're not for all  my caffeinated ways of life
Those who oppose me will end in bitter strife
Defacing human minds until I die
Those with open minds will benefit from my vows
A selfbetrothal where I pay no heed to sacred cows
Further discussion time will not allow
Until we meet again I'll take my bow
And remember <start> instrumental <start> Salida

If there wasn't so much tension
you could've confided yourself in me
The only reason I come back here
The reason I come back here because you were lonely
Another nightmare of mine
I'll bring flowers for you next time
You didn't have to die if you were lonely
The only reason I come back here
The reason I come back here because you were lonely
Another nightmare of mine
I'll bring flowers for you next time
You didn't have to die if you were lonely
You lived passing angels by to embrace death
I can't fathom it pick your body up off the pavement
You left all your loved ones behind
without a though or one last goodbye
Thoughtless choice
Murderer
Confided in me confided in me
The only reason I come back here
The reason I come back here because you were lonely
Another nightmare of mine
I'll bring flowers for you next time
You didn't have to die if you were lonely <start> When I have fears that I may cease to be
Before my pen has glean'd my teeming brain
Before high piled books in charact'ry
Hold like rich garners the fullripen'd grain
When I behold upon the night's starr'd face
Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance
And think that I may never live to trace
Their shadows with the magic hand of chance
And when I feel fair creature of an hour
That I shall never look upon thee more
Never have relish in the faery power
Of unreflecting love  then on the shore
Of  wide world I stand alone and think
Till Love and Fame  nothingness  sink. <start> Dj Drama

 foot  on the late what a date she fell for the hook and the bait
I took her to the yacht the shrimp and steak
Then I took her to the gym so she could get in shape
No more drama just late night thrills
Nigga in the hood with the gangsta grillz
Fillin out stacks of bills jaguar like Jacksonville
Bringing these hoes like Jacks and Jill
Chorus
Akon
I'm looking at the most beautiful thing in the world 
Her body's so perfect and spinning like a cinnamon swirl 
She looks like a fairy tale but yet feels so natural 
This one's a beast but way to wonderful to be compared to an animal
She's like what I'm sipping on Shirley temple on ice
She makes it just right
That extra grenadine got me feelin' so nice
Her bodies so tight up under that light
I see her so clearly now she's right there before my eyes

Hey I sit and gaze hazy eyed as I day dream
Her n her girls on the stage doing they thing
Double D's full of silicon and saline
She thirty but look only a day over 
Her booty big enough to swallow up a gstring
Hey going put that ass on me like a bee sting
Hey let the King on beat it like a tambourine
And peel ya out ya jeans and eat it like a tangerine
I see her face down ass high
Make everybody throw that cash high
Back in the club already
She stuck in my head since last night
That's right girl you got my dreams so
Sexy when I sleep
No more fantasies I want the real thing.
Chorus <start> words are not available inside the CD's booklet <start> I stood in the room when the light in her eyes dimmed.
Forever it faded and burned out invaded.
I sat by the bed with his hand in my hand.
It fell and it went limp breathlessly leaving our world.
You think that I'm dumb that I'm too young to know such things.
But what have I done I've had to handle everything.
You think that I'm one whose absent in the pageantry.
But I could heal your world.
Your world is dirty.
Your world is burning.
Your world is hurting for me.
A million dark faces burned hands in embraces
all falling to places where you could never come back.
My heart was freezing my mind disbelieving they went
down so easy pleading fleeing from our world.
You think that I'm dumb that I'm too young to know such things.
But look what I've done. I have to handle everything.
You think that I'm one whose absent in the pageantry.
But I could heal your world.
Your world is dirty.
Your world is burning.
Your world is hurting for me.
You think that I'm not brave
that I'm too young to know such things.
You think that I'd cave that I can't handle anything.
If only I had saved a piece of what I used to love...
Then I could heal your world.
Your world is dirty.
Your world is burning.
Your world is yearning.
Your world is hurting for me <start> Far before our time
I feel some nervousness
I try to justify
Not so much what I did but
Just how the child died
Don't need just anyone
Not those with plastic face masks on
Can't trust just anyone
My wires are crossed it's causing sparks

Disconnected from our state of mind
Overloaded far before our time X
I gaze through blackened shades
I peer between the blinds
Down on the streets below
They're fuckin hanging all the time
They're invisible offspring
New shipments everyday
They'll tell you the same thing
We're youth of a star walk nation

They say that nothing lasts forever in this world cause
It's all done with mirrors
The glass is thin just as a reflection there within Oh
Energy vampires for condemnation
Such a harsh abbreviation to maintain when you're in Babylon for glory
Take me away all right now <start> I can't believe what I am hearing
You make my ears bleed so bad
I can see right through your lies
I stay and listen to what you are saying
Just empty words made up stuff from
Your fantasy worlds I got eyes with them I can
See through just about anything
So far so good say what
You're just acting like a fucking fool
So far so good say what
I will deliver I will maintain
I'm sane enough to make my own decisions
Don't need any rules I have my own
And I break them time after time
A mad dog in progress fulfilling my life
I've been on the right track since day one
Don't need to change my way of life not ever
Gonna stay the same I will remain
So far so good say what
You're just acting like a fucking fool
So far so good say what
I will deliver I will maintain
Whatever comes in my way I embrace it
Take it with me on my journey through life
Defending yourself with so worn out clichs
You say you are nothing I say you are everything
You ever wanted to be
You should try to be true to yourself
Let your soul and heart guide you
Don't let your dreams just be dreams
Follow the leader follow your heart
Just empty words made up stuff from
Your fantasy worlds I've got eyes with them I can
See through just about anything
Don't need to change my way of life not ever
Gonna stay the same I will remain
So far so good say what
You're just acting like a fucking fool
So far so good say what
I will deliver I will maintain <start> Instrumental <start> The gentle breeze
It whispers to me through the trees
Softly
Words of a nation
Will come together for the first celebration
They whisper through the trees
Softly
Appreciation
Will spread a feeling of great joy and elation
It carries on the wind
When they sing
Words of truth
They whisper through the trees
Softly
The voice of reason
Shall lead the choir as they sound their ambition
It carries on the wind
When they sing
Words of truth
True to the ones who gave their heart and soul
The gentle breeze
It whispers to me through the trees
Can you hear it
It carries on the wind
When they sing
Words of truth
Warning us of storms to come
Don't panic
In time they will vanish
They whisper through the trees
Softly <start> Life of desperation that's his way
Searching for a light to shine today but I know that I won't
Help me Jesus can't you feel my pain
I'm so tired twisted and insane taken a look in my eyes
There's no living Forgiving God help me please
Chorus
I'm lost in the dark
I don't know which way I'm facing
I reach to feel my way a life caught in the maze
There's no living Forgiving God help me please

Institution no solution this is destiny I know
Living living scared of dying wondering where it is I'll go
Oh no no no
Oh no no no
Lost in the dark
Lost in the dark <start> Music Z. Nilsson D. Dlimi <start> what urge me to do right
the emptiness  the conciousness of living in
the void of the feral muting against the vacant  cold
void  the incensed endeavour to
rescing the fact of vacuty to be doomed
neverthless  my imagination  just symbols or
repressed desires  vision of adoration and
death  and the disillusion of living in
a world that has to be rescued  an age
that is sainted to mental decline and
my incapability to struggle for liberation
my last minute should not be marked
by the realization that I never really lived <start> Violence throughout the land
Racial groups they plan attack
I'm tired of white man's crimes
It looks to be for good this time
Brother and brother
They kill one another
Without a real cause
Fight for what's fair
For what's really theirs
Only to get themselves lost
Whites took the land from the blacks
Killed their children to keep them back
Stole their land and shot their pride
Started up this useless fight
Riots start as whites flee
Their last chance to be free
Rocks fly throughout the skies
A gun is shot a child dies <start> Wishing to be dead when hope is gone
Depreciating life when the days are looking bad
Sick of being alive when everyone is vain
Lost your hopes and now you fight against depression
Cause life's hard for everyone just look all around you
So why squander all your power on selfdestruction
Too proud to make amends
Your faith it all depends  hold on tight...
Too scared to be alive 
Salvation suicide calling me
A long way to hell
My spoiled paradise has met this dead end
Cause i live my life all my own with pride
Too proud to make amends
Your faith it all depends  hold on tight...
Too scared to be alive 
Salvation suicide haunting me
Get out of my way
Get out of my way
On my way to hell <start> Epitomizing horror
Echoes it's bleakest past
With willing replication
Let perspective last
Breaking deadlocks
World bleeding inside
Now the tide is turning
In ever present pride
Strategies executed
All now beyond defeat
Analysis no rise to flaws
See failure as retreat
Rearguard advantage
Third battle forges close
Forceful and evasive
So proud yet morose
Seeds of future discord
Suspicion fear and hate
Never lying dormant
One by one negate
No last offensive
All resistance ceased
Forced down the final path
Forwards into peace <start> Don't see you ever do without
Leper
Forced to feel pitifuland how clever
You call him pretty and blessed child
Now see how the pretty boy runs wild
It's just an ordinary day
I know how to fix you if you come my way
You are the proud and simple man
Now run as fast as I know you can
Trick me with your deaf dumb and blind
Feigned hero daily disguise
It's just like every other day
But I know how to fix you if you come my way
Pull out your teeth and stare
With your hands at your share
Pull out your eyes and stare
With your hands at your share
You are the first one to fall down
You are the first one to cry foul
You are the first one to point the blame
You are the first one to feel ashamed
Couldn't you help me so that I may believe
Couldn't you show me so that I may be saved <start> Dear just one day just another flight just one more lonely night
Just one more crowd under the burning lights

To my friends to my family
I tried to be the best man I could ever be
Tasted their failure on the entrance way

To my greatest of demons I beat you <start> Human waste fallen prey surrounding me.
A plague on life corroded minds a dying breed.
Morals decay whores parade it sickens me.
This human race the living dead drenched in disease.
Burn away see this dead.
This world burns.
Every day I search for hope.
My hopes drenched in disease
Burn away end this plague.
Drenched in disease.
This world burns. <start> Bleeding death undead broke the seal suhrim

My heart's beat is slow. I'm thinking about my belief
Rain washing over me cleaning up my brain
Till I question all my thoughts
And clean 'em up from stains
Clean 'em up from stains
Clean 'em up from stains yeah
Die free yeah
Welcome to the circle of those who know their way
Welcome to those who've realized their needs
Who don't need fear to pray and betray
But they don't accept us living free
Believing what we need
Haven't heard anything about poetry
They only know their painful greed
Don't ever trust those who say they know
Those who show and force you to bow
I've done no wrong but to ask my brain
To be free from pain built up by those who reign
Chorus
A mind in disguise now I know
It's better to hide my belief than feeding the crow
A life on the run now I know
The kingdom of disguise is the last place to go
In the eyes of the world I'm a master of heresy
Swimming against the tide  endangering democracy
I remember the day when I was young and bold
When I thought that my mind was free
Until the time that I was told
Out in the night they laugh about me and my Knowledge and
Speak prayers our god don't want to hear. But listen
Wherever you are I will get you Well you don't know who
I am I am the inquisition and I am your heretics
Barbarian end
Beware and be silent and follow the sign
Keep the mission as a secret of your mind
One out of a million is a friend of your line
Don't forget there are evil eyes behind
Holding the candle she was found in the rain
Bright eyes and blissful but they thought
That she went astray
Too late to escape she seemed to be insane
She got imprisoned because she got her own way
Now can't you remember
What have you done
Believe me I'm innocent. I've done no wrong
But you are strange You are guilty I guess
And after the torture you will confess and burn
Ending in the flames burning down her fame
Prayers to the saints their end of an evil game
Run to your last refuge
Maybe the silence of your voice
Lie but be true to yourself
Sometimes you've got no choice
Follow a king called silence
Live in his kingdom of disguise
There is a temple of shelter
Where God forgives you your lies.
Run to your last refuge
Maybe the silence of your voice
Lie but be true to yourself
Sometimes you've got no choice
Follow a king called silence
Live in his kingdom of disguise
There is a temple of shelter
Where God forgives you your lies.
I can see it bright here in front of your eyes
The apparition never dies
Yes I see yes I feel yes I know it all <start> I could tell you what you want to hear to hold you off another year.
But I hope the truth finds you well.
A common praise. A passing phase.
Moving forward Not today
The limit's in the sky but will you be reaching it tonight
Tonight you got to test the limits and tell yourself that.
I'm alive Just make that choice and draw that line tonight.
Tonight you got to test the limits and tell yourself that
Im alive and I'm not going anywhere
No chance to be free. No chance to soar in the sky.
Your feet fixed to the ground.
Desperation is what's weighing you down.
Whether my strength be heaven sent or my own selfconfidence.
These days when I'm walking through a crowd.
I don't have to hold my head down.
No more wasting time. Burn bright like a star ignite.
The limit's in the sky but will you be reaching it tonight
Tonight you got to test the limits and tell yourself that.
I'm alive Just make that choice and draw that line tonight.
Tonight you got to test the limits and tell yourself that
Im alive and I'm not going anywhere
Be a leader and never EVER follow
That's what my father that's what he always told me.
So with those words boldly spoken he sent me down a long and hard road.
Shrug it off my shoulders it was never meant for me.
I won't waste my time in mediocrity.
Tonight I'm alive. <start> Shades of intuition.
Shades of conspiring.
Occupying every piece.
Integrating.
We're growing in the most peculiar ways.
Decompose.
Recreate.
All progression it stems from conclusion.
Complacency it's obsolete.
We're engineered to thrive we're engineered to thrive.
And thrive we will.
Observe this vision grow.
Continuous cycle.
A mandating gloom. <start> Human I can read your mind
Stranger from your eyes don't weep
Clear your thoughts
Ease your mind
Chorus
Don't believe a word
Unless it's proven true
You might just catch a spell
Damnation upon you
Teacher learnin' from the card
Preacher lovin' you is so damn hard
And the tales that you tell
Repeat chorus
Liar your brain is runnin' wild
Crier elemental child
Sinner playin' with your thoughts
Winner are you feeling lost
Solve the maze
Case the haze
Repeat chorus  <start> If I could see without your sight
I would not be alive.
If I could see without your sight
I would be alive
If I was alive
If I was alive
If I could be
If I could be <start> Once I had a secret love
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love
Became impatient to be free
So I told a friendly star
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are
And why I'm so in love with you
Now I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door
And my secret love's
No secret anymore. <start> A prECious lIfe a hOlLoW soul

There's nothing to see here
Only a distant memory
Of how things really were
Supposed to be
And life moves on
Ever so quickly
I see my past it flashes by
Like the stars in the sky flickering
And the years come around
Years come around
I'm left here praying
That the tears falling down
Tears falling down
Are worth me saving
And I don't know how to go on
Tear down the walls of your life
You can't stop them anymore
Tear down the walls of your life
And find your way
How long
Can this life carry on
How long
Watch the walls
Watch them burning down
How long
How long must we run
I lost my way
When I was younger
I regret lots of things I did
Just maybe I didn't give quite enough
And the years turn around
Years turn around
Their faces fading
And the years going by
Years going by
There's no replacing
And the souls will all carry on
Tear down the walls of your life
You can't stop them anymore
Tear down the walls of your life
And find your way
How long
Can this life carry on
How long
Watch the walls
Watch them burning down
How long
How long must we run
Tear down the walls
How long
Can this life carry on
How long
Watch the walls
Watch them burning down
How long
How long must we run <start> Hypocrisy embrace me
with words unheard
as I try to extend myself
to reach your hands
if only I could
make this different
Turn myself around
I would be there
Let you know
I was there
Make you see
There is more
Inside me
Into the void of empty eyes
I admit defeat
Within this silence I will
Amend myself <start> No Love. No Peace.
Spend your days counting sheep.
When you're dead you're done you're dead you die.
But life goes on.
No love no lies.
Wasting your days. Waiting to die.
No one would mind if you never woke up again. Goodbye my friend.
No hopes. No dreams. Breaking away from reality.
Today is the day you see the consequence.
May you never wake up again.
I will long even if they're all Dead
I will bring the dead to life.
When they put a price on your head. Say goodbye to your wonderful life.
I have seen the lying face of god. I have seen the edge of the earth.
We have already lived to fucking long.
may we regret our birth.
I was born a monster. I will die the same.
No one can live forever. I will become a household name.
No love no lies.
Wasting your days. Waiting to die.
No one would mind if you never woke up again. Goodbye my friend.
No hopes. No dreams. Breaking away from reality.
Today is the day you see the consequence.
May you never wake up again.
We will choke the ones we love.
Your admiration means nothing to us.
When push comes to fucking shove.
We never do what's expected of us.
We all wanna be a part of something. But I see you want none of this.
We live our lives afraid to die But these dreams are selfish.
I hate everything you love.
I hate everything you love.
I hate everything you love.
I hate everything you love.
No love no lies.
Wasting your days. Waiting to die.
No one would mind if you never woke up again. Goodbye my friend.
No hopes. No dreams. Breaking away from reality.
Today is the day you see the consequence.
May you never wake up again. <start> BRUJO Mi verga machetn est duro te lo meto

so high in front of me
slave serve
humiliated

As a point

I can't delete

under her lead
reinforced every night
she returns
to take rule
I need it
she enslaves my pride
salt on my wounds

 <start> Science has become a child's game.
There is no solution to bring away this plague.
No remedies have been discovered.
The cure is a shotgun the cure is whatever blunt instrument one can salvage.
Whomever finds themselves too proper will be the first to perish.
And you know nothing that matters now.
We cannot restore  we cannot recover 
All is lost in the flood of the risen dead.
We cannot restore  we cannot recover 
All is lost in the storm of the disgraceful.
The incurable bring us our punishment.
Today's destruction can only be measured in
In biblical biblical proportion.
Let's go
My will is at God's hand never within man's teeth.
My will is at God's hand never within man's teeth.
My will is at God's hand never within man's teeth.
Always wanting more never enough until this day and age when there's nothing left.

All is lost <start> The saving shelter I want to achieve This last drop of blood running down my knees I see
the path of endless passion No estimation for my determination This is ... what i would kill
for This is what I want to carry in my heart This is what i stride for  my strength and
truth You have betrayed your own existence Focused on broken dreams that ll burn you
soul This is ...What i would kill for This music has give us the most important experiences
in our lives. The importance of what this means to us can never be described by words.
Everyone who just stood on a stage for a single second knows what we mean. This is
something that we don't want to miss this is our life and this is our destiny <start> We smelled the greasepaint in the air
They stumbled into town last night completely unaware
Clad in shirts of mesh and with mascara on their eyes
We saw a keyboard player and we knew they had to die.
They played a show at Ivan's Inn
From underneath the stage we heard the caterwauling din
They sang of forests elves and trolls
The urge to kill them on the spot we barely could control
After the show they all got drunk
Apparently to celebrate a set that really stunk
To the graveyard they predictably paid call
These lords of chaos whined about their tour bus being small
They spoke of Norway and the scene
The sound of laughing Ghouls reverberated through the trees
We should take some pictures the one in chain mail said
That's it. Cremator growled It's time these idiots were dead.
They scattered like rats when they saw Ghoul attack
The drummer was the first to go a hook in his back
Machetes were sinking into painted flesh
Carnage and gore soaking leather and mesh
The keyboardist begged but Fermentor just laughed
We hacked off his hands and then chopped him in half
The vocalist was strangled with his very guts
His female backup expired from her cuts
Splattering brain pans as a matter of course
Violently murdering with no fucking remorse
Their bassist to a boobytrap paid a toll
His head having gained five or six extra holes
The blood from his mouth made a hot steamy treat
We savoured the moment then sawed off his feet
Both of the guitarists made a run for the gate
Digestor cut them off and sealed their fate
One of them cried while the other was killed
His tears did no good as his skull was still drilled
Slicing and dicing our fanatic obsession
Of slaughtering poseurs we've made a profession
In our forbidden...
Forbidden crypts <start> Why I stared fixedly in your eyes only
Why I caressed your soft and tender palm of hand
Mockery this damned laughter thwarted my fate.
Ah this damned edge spilt the passion in me
But but killed your love your love
Ah how I regret my own deed and beg for forgiveness.
Eros
My tears flow down rough and dark bark of a tree
Which once was beauty and soft body yours.
Among fingers the twigs I entwine and dream
I caress their leaves and touch of you seek in them.
I fall down in depths
In depths from which isn't return.
In madness I seek the oblivion
I don't want suffer anymore
Throttled sorrow is now my gloomy friend
Friend torturing my parchedly longing soul.
As shadow now I stray over meadow full of asfodels
Flowers which seal up my fatal hopeless.
Where ends the affliction
I ask and look at heavens.
Already I recollect only
And the wreath start to wind. <start> Wreckless abandon coming undone
Survive the swallow decade of ruin gone
I found myself in trenches tonight
Regret runs wild as darkness kills all the lights
All the lights have died
Slow dose of hell stripping what's left
Sleepless for days on end
And ingest life on all sides
I can't be reached in this soulless design
Capsized my insides hours inch by
Inviting the lions to all take a piece
Destroyed by endless ends looking to cease
Searching the city to no avail
Can't find me anywhere winds out of sail
I found myself in trenches tonight
Regret runs wild as darkness kills all the lights
All the lights have died
Slow dose of hell stripping what's left
Sleepless for days on end
And ingest life on all sides
I need a search light to make amends
From the insides out to looking in
On the strength of its test
A full blooded sense of life
Lived far beyond the comfort zone
Ghosts remain on auto pilot looking to cancel out
A brief breath of air in darkness
Survive in doubt <start> Death Messiah
You're the one
Occult dreams
aren't your goal
Why you preach the Black Book
When handcuffs  whips are
Your game
Death Messiah
Your religion
Only an excuse
Death Messiah
Diabolic desires
are your major concern
Death Messiah
You're the king in your
morbid phantasies
Death Messiah
You're insane
In your sick reality

Die for
Die for
Die for HIM <start> All that is artificial maintains us. That which exists is inadequate. The hypocrisies of technology betray our senses. Simulated emotions fooled again. We're labels and files in cabinets. Payroll accounts and calculations. We're gears that run the machine that dictates life as we know it . We're gears that run the machine that dictates our lives. We're rung of our humanity on which technocracy thrives. We're expendable figures we're liquidation. We're character strings and data statements. We learn live and die a number. <start> Si me estas buscando me encontraras
por el camino que a Lujan sigue la procesion
un hogar llamado Jesus de Nazareth
calle de tierra cruzando el paso a nivel de Padre Fhay.
Ellos festejan verme llegar
y yo su apuro por abrirme la tranquera
un algo ayuda a continuar
a quienes la yugan por librarlos de la ausencia de mama y
de papa.
Si me estas buscando me encontraras
por el camino que a Lujan sigue la procesion
un hogar llamado Jesus de Nazareth
calle de tierra cruzando el paso a nivel de Padre Fhay. <start> Do you know this pain
From the first sting in your heart forlorn
All the ideas in your head
All the ideas in my head
What can you do about it
Try to hide behind the grace all this noise
All these crazy images in your head
All these crazy images in my head
All the ideas in my head
In blur distance no future ahead
My world crash into pieces
It seems like old memories
From one life to another
Lines spinning in my head
Feelings that I can't remember
What happened where did they go
These feelings that I can't remember
Look ahead so you don't fall behind
Thoughts keeps us up gives us hope
Look ahead so you don't fall behind
Thoughts keeps us up gives us hope
It gives us hope
Look ahead so you don't fall behind
Thoughts keeps us up gives us hope
Look ahead so you don't fall behind
Thoughts keeps us up gives us hope
Here on my weekly down trip
On a voyage of discovery
On display like a freak show
While these crazy people are watching me
While these crazy people are watching me
As a deeper state of coma
A prescription from an unknown hand
Drifting into the drug
Injected to secure my ideas
Injected to secure my memories
All these crazy images in my head
Bloodlines left behind
Bones buried hidden by earth
Life takes mysterious ways
In a blink of an eye all twisted around
Burn my skin pull out my nails
It won't heal invisible scars inside
Bad luck get your act together
Leaving destination unknown
Look ahead so you don't fall behind
Thoughts keeps us up gives us hope
Look ahead so you don't fall behind
Thoughts keeps us up gives us hope
It gives us hope
Look ahead so you don't fall behind
Thoughts keeps us up gives us hope
Look ahead so you don't fall behind
Thoughts keeps us up gives us hope
It gives us hope <start> Farewell friend until tomorrow. Where you are still
Nitpicking our diets and names. The potential is still
There yet it's somehow unexpected. I'll show you
Courage if you show me responsibility. Something lost
Long ago in trying to please everyone. In pleasing
Ourselves. If it feels good it must be right. Right
So what's a child A fetus or kink in sexual
Revolution and what am I A threat a kink in
Political consistency. More name games and more
Personal choice. So where's mine Or are you to deal
Me such luxuries. Call me what I am and mean every
Word. Be prepared to take yours. You see you're not
Along. I'll show you responsibility if you show me
Reasoning. Something you never possessed. You always
Coveted anger and vengeance. But for what One less
Bite one less burden. I'm sick of being the bastard.
Keep your fight and know I'll keep mine. <start> Well I'm going down down down
My mind is a wreck
My head is spinning around and around
In the funnel of love
It's such a crazy crazy crazy thing
I get weak in my knees
My whole head's spinning
As I go deep in the funnel of love
I tried and tried to run and hide
I even tried to run away
But you just can't hide from the tunnel of love
It's gonna get you someday
It's gonna get you someday
It's such a crazy crazy crazy thing
I get weak in my knees
My whole head's spinning
As I go deep in the funnel of love
Funnel of love
I'm in so deep
I tried and tried to run and hide
I even tried to run away
But you just can't hide from the funnel of love
It's gonna get you someday
It's gonna get you someday
It's gonna get you someday
It's gonna get you someday
It's gonna get you someday <start> I foresee ages of chaos
But my ordeal has yet just started
For these ominous signs
Are bound to plague me
Haunt for centuries to come
My healing incantations
Are destined for failure
My unremitting warnings and threats
Will go unheeded such is my curse.
Why should it be incumbent upon me
To redeem their faults 
You The one who spurns the past
Are now But worthy to be last.
Thy choices are errors
I shall thus abandon thou
To thy gloomy fate.
I can see the future
In the light of the past.
I cannot stop this ineluctable doom
From raining over the world.
Alas this obnoxious portend
Will turn out to be abiding truth.
From time immemorial
Man has taken refuge in oblivion.
They've exchanged there future
for the present enjoyment.
Nothing will change History has set
Her implacable march into motion.
There will be no escape.
You The one who spurns the past
Are now But worthy to be last.
Thy choices are errors
I shall thus abandon thou
To thy gloomy fate. <start> Chorus
No remorse
No regrets
No feeling
Built to kill
Ostrcize consciousness to another dimension
Bloodred let the path be one should lead
Writeoff blunt weakness
Smiling at the caused mayhem
Dog eat dog
Repeat chorus
Slain shall be the ones who defy
Slaughter the ones who deny
The philosophy of total fuckin' destruction of man
And it's pathetic attempts to everrule all
Repeat chorus
Misanthrope I built to kill
Misanthrope you built to kill
Misanthrope them built to kill
Misanthrope us built to kill <start> instrumental <start> Don't fucking turn away unverified I think we've got a problem here
You gotta stay off my back I can't take another day in this prison
Locked inside of here imprisoned in flesh for mental light years
Pushing all my buttons now you're just another cold worthless victim
There's no time don't hold me down
You crossed the line now you're fucked
Life's a heavy price to pay
But when you're dead there's no complaining
I think of how you deceived and I get my blood on fire
The last one to believe I never thought of execution
But there's nothing left for me me and I think you're
You're asking for a beat down take the fucker's life
He had to pay the price the greed went to his head
I've lost my faith in man there's no regrets with me
At last my mind can be
Free of the pressure the lies and deception
It's the shit that they feed me everyday
Just looking back on the days of my life
I can find another reason to make you fucking burn at the stake
I can't wait another day
Unverified the tide's turning back on you bullshit
You are wasting my time and respect with your lies
Destroyer of faith cashed out falling down
Years of deception in chains of oppression
The knots of the system tied tight around me
The growing confusion and absence of reason
Is fuel on the fire that burns my anger
Driving me forward in psychotic compulsion
Hate is erupting I can't control it
Social dimensions collapsing corroded
The net is wide open we all are left for dead <start> I am your  walls black
Light hits you eyes charge goes crack
I am your  walls black
Truth will now know
Where my cock will go
I am your  walls black
Still you lie You lie
Your pact is high
Your taste is high
I am your  walls black <start> Here take this guiding hand
I lead you through this land and far below
Your journey here might end
Just trust a good old friend the way he shows
Although it's getting cold
Don't doubt the way you go I'm here for you
You better close your coat
You're risking a bad throat don't want you to
Four bad seasons
Way I know
Guiding treason
Way I show
The riders over there
Already brought them where they do belong
So gather with these guys
You fit to very nice  another one
Meet them greet them
Brothers five
Growing stronger
Still alive <start> Lost in your own conviction
Being lead from outside eyes
Perceiving success as malevolent
At the expense of others
Defiance with hands out
Claiming the bribes as plunder
Images presented certainty
Driving thoughts that despise
Subservient obedient
Wanting to preserve the cause
Tag along within the pack
Acceptable behavior stick to the mantra
Fan the flames of discontent
Open the window for opportunism
Civic disobedience barbarism incurs violence within the horde
Reguritating what you're told
In the momnet feels like wisdom
Declarations of simpatico
Cementing thoughts of divine purpose
Coinciding goals power of suggestions
Ushering the age of euphoria
Presuming the absence of interior conflict
Startled by antagonism
Easily rationalized
The mob is pulling the strings
Peers the moral compass antipathy realized
Calls for action tensions boiling surrogate violence
Tragic revolt prominent support
Favorable courage bolstered exploit elevated impact
Obstinate provocation initiating response
Willful ignorance wallowed in
Talking heads to permeate insight
No need to modify agenda
Marching orders on the way <start> Oh how I dream
Pictures of the ancient times
The executioner awaits on the stage
In the eyes of the mob
Through which the convicted
Are dragged scorned
And spat upon
Sinners soon to confront their fate
Excitement in the air
Lost medieval times
Former ideals shall be retrieved
Like me into this body reborn
Lead Schalin
Judge executioner allinone
I am the chosen one
Justice to be done
Sentenced no wait
No wait decapitate
The victim of my hate
Lead Schalin Allenmark
My name shall be God
Lord of heaven earthly hell
And whatever is inbetween
I reign in my kingdom of death
I judge the living
And the soon to be dead
Sentenced no wait
No wait decapitate
The victim of my hate
Lead this lost world through this maze
Refined are my ways
I'm Messiah
To make this world a better place <start> More that you'll get the more will you want
Nothing can please you to cease you to yearn
You reach out for sun you bore under ground
What lies there for you
Searching for riches and treasures of old
Nothing can please your hunger for gold
Burrowing under reaching for stars
But now you have reached too far
No What have you done
Now it is time to pay
Chorus
Feel your heart
Beating in the dark
You have invoked the beast beneath
No one can hear your scream
Now the spiral is spinning too fast
Any second might be your last
Your heart was led by greed
From your soul the beast will feed
Solo
Once again I feel my heart
Beating my lifeblood through my veins
Woe upon thee and thy kind
For thou hast 'wakened the slumber of mine
Hatred shall be my wine
Fear my meat
With your soul I shall feast
Chorus x <start> Pressing on about our business
Comfort is getting too expensive
Hot shots for the pigeons
With a death sentence
You're something like a pistol
That's been polished bright
But if it never leaves the holster
It can never save your life
I need a meaning I can get behind
To be alone is to be alive
A better message to subscribe to
To be alone is to be alive
Set sun I'm an hour older
Mile markers punctuate the shoulder
Harboring delusions of grandeur
You're something like a canvas
That's been stretched and primed
You can become something priceless
Or you could be a waste of time
I need a meaning I can get behind
To be alone is to be alive
A better message to subscribe to
To be alone is to be alive
This is the best time to be alone
To be alone is to be alive
Consider where complaining gets you
To be alone is to be alive
We're living much too
We're living much too comfortably for me
Keep drifting keep drifting aimlessly
Stay with me stay with me
We'll stay busy stay busy
Endless trips to anywhere
To end up where we'll be
I need a meaning I can get behind
To be alone is to be alive
A better message to subscribe too
To be alone is to be alive
This is the best time to be alone
To be alone is to be alive
Consider where complaining gets you
To be alone is to be alive <start> At night assimilate life
In the infinite realm
Of our intrinsic side
Find the missing parts of the mind
The hidden truth behind
Our dungeon of thoughts this labyrinth
Search it has a reason and a meaning
Remembered and repeated
A guide not to be ignored
Feel there's so much to feel
Amnesia must confiscate an elusive link
to consciousness
It's there cause there's so much we don't know
Even our own true face
It's there facing what we can't have
Our ideals ain't true naked and exposed
To the bareness of what's real
Boundless fantasy becomes reality
As we breathe water and run through the sand
Whispers and a scream flying high falling down
And a face with no features or name
Exposed to live we can only divine
Tell me what's your reality <start> I Got Through To You
And Destroyed You To
I Made You All Pay
Cause You Did Obey
You Didn't Stop Me
I Got Your Key
You Cannot Turn Back
I Got You On My Track
I Fooled You With A Lie
And You Did Not Deny
I Fooled You With A Lie
An You Did Not Deny
I Was Fooling You
Cause You Never Knew <start> You circle like a bloody vulture
You watch me from distance
You shoot a piercing glance
You have fucking expectations
You mutter under your breath
With your big distorted mouth
And you swear quietly when
I don't dance the way you want...
You careflly watch my hands
You're stiff like in a bloody dance
You analyze my every word
Just as a psycho. Twisted teacher
You are always stalking me
You stuck to me like a leech
And you swear quietly when
I don't dance the way you want so...
When you say to me Fuck You
Say It louder...
In your mouth you have a snake
Hissing to me ear at night
And the spiders in your eyes
Crawl on my face when I sleep
When you say to me...
Your shadow is stuck to mine
Your breath blows to my feathers
And you swear quietly when
I don't dance the way you want so...
When you say to me... <start> Misty shadows grips the heart
Souls reunite in order of chaos
 Wnite knights guards the treasures of dreams
In the centre of the storm a man is to emerge
To find the pleasure beyond the lost horizon
Now hidden beyond a realm of rain
Entering the vein of black
Blood runs red in seas of sorrow
Tne sun burns grey in a cloudy sky
Confusion
Many questions why
It's time to leave this earthly palace
The crystal is stolen as worlds collapse
Reality disappears shaking in disgust
The crystal leads astray
A foul taste of truth
Blood runs red in the flow of forever
Springs of salt runs down the face
Left alone in silent disgrace
repeat
As the leaves slowly falls to the ground
Forever captured spirits of life
The pathis gone without a trace
Lost in a universe of deceit
But somewhere in the distant
 <start> Born to hate
Living my life ending yours
Love to hate
Utilized the light with lies
I breed hate
suffer
I am reality I am the bringer of eternal hate
I bring hate
Upon your church upon your cross
Eternal hate
You're heavenly children
You raised to be week as you
Brain washed Christians
In the bible they live
My hate against your children
Is what i live for
To give them misery
That's what i am here for
I breed hate
I am reality I am the bringer of eternal hate
I bring hate
Upon your church upon your cross
Eternal hate
The light will soon be dead
Darkness prevails
Fire walk this way
The armies of hate
God won't save you now
No answer you get
Your prayers a waste of time
Heaven is dead
Now i bring down god
With sin after sin
Dismember his children
Killing all of his love
My armies of hatred
Will forever stand tall
I breed hate eternal hate
Born to hate
Living my life ending yours
Love to hate
Utilized the light with lies
I breed hate
Suffer <start> Let me introduce myself the avenger from the past
This is not a joke at all from the other side of the grave I call
You both were my parents
You killed me when I was still small
And you reason like all the others
Just a piece of cell that's all
Made cosmetics of my placenta
Threw away and burned my remains
You use a fine word abortion
It's children's holocaust to me
No morning for the living either
For most children life is a hell
They are sacrificed on the altar
For a few bastards wealth
In school they get mistreated
At home beaten and raped
Put down and constant defeated
The grown world feeds them with hate
I am the father I am talking to you
You sodomise my children stop the things you do
You say tomorrow leave the past behind
But the sorrow still does remind
And the shadows are closing in
And just because we've learned to live with sin
You can't see me but you feel me
I am coming to set them free
I've done this before
The persian empire
The roman empire
And now you
You don't learn so you must burn
Because you sodomise my children
Sodomise my children <start> Nefarious nights a time so far
ancestral fears and nightmares
From the darkened clouds of the past
memories of souls without rest...
Pray your lord to reach another dawn
 Darkness takes away our mortal life
They' ve come back with these obscure nights
The moon appears through the fog
which flattens over the bog
Lock yourself inside your fragile home
close all lights and hope they don't come
NEFARIOUS... NIGHTS
NEFARIOUS... NIGHTS
I observe sinister moors
Through the grip of winter
i walk towards the endless dark
As legends return to take
other lives into their funeral drape
Nefarious Nights...
Rediverunt nobis.
Tempus est solvere debitum sanguinis.
Deum benedictat nos omnes.
A funeral procession through the night
takes the caskets of the dead to the cemetary
They burn their coffins to purify the souls
then pray the Lord to be forgiven
Population now has payed the dues
The cold winds take away the nefarious nights <start> In north lands covered
By snow and brave
Where man cultivate the ground
His arms and shields hang up in their walls
Looking at cold sea
The wind sings a new conquest
Odim lord of Valhalla
Save all the clans over the horizons
I see the distant coast
And high rocks of my country
I may die but I'm strong
Good bye my brothers we must fight
Crossing every ocean and
Running trough the battlefield
Strong like hammer of Thor
Gods of Ice
Marching under grey sky
Master of thunder storm
We'll win the war because
We're Gods of Ice
No mercy for strangers
Invading and burning dales
Killing men children and women
Tears cannot stop the barbarian fire
Valkyrias take care for souls
Of our fighters
Dead for Viking honour
Let all of them living forever
Marching under grey sky
Master of thunder storm
We'll win the war because
We're Gods of Ice
I drink in the skull of my enemy
To celebrate our victory
For the proud of my brothers <start> Algebra My heart forgot if it's broken into pieces
When I saw that you were hoping I still love you
And you wanted me as much as I wanted you
But the words would go unspoken
That we made a big mistake in the past went separate ways
Never thought our love will outlast but it stayed
My head and my heart are falling apart
Don't want to miss out again on the good love
Chorus
Cause baby it's you that I want
And it's you who's unavailable for me and it's hurts
My heart to be a good girl
Baby it's me you say you need
But it's you who's already married to someone
And it's hard for me
I struggle to be a good girl
I want to be bad
It's a struggle to be a good girl
Que Baby I hear what you're saying
But let me be honest and say that
If I was a single man
I would pursue everything
But I just can't juggle two loves
It's not in the plan
And I bet you would
But if we gonna be one hundred
My love for you will never die that is a promise
But we both can agree that
We made a big mistake in the past went separate ways
Never thought our love would outlast. But it stayed
In my head and my heart you're always be a part
I really do miss your good love
Chorus
Baby it's you that I want
And it's you who's unavailable for me it hurts
My heart to be a good girl
Baby it's me you say you need
But it's you who's already married to someone
And it's hard for me
I struggle to be a good guy
I want to be bad
It's a struggle to be a good guy
Even though we're lovers still we can never
Be what were but let's do what's best for us
Right now
what makes sense is
To love from a distance cherish the moments.
I know it hurts but this is what we must do
Everything was special I won't forget you
Oo you changed my life you changed my world
You'll always be my guy
You'll always be my girl
I know it's not easy but I'll always gonna be the good guy
Good girl good guy
Good girl good guy <start> Drag the angels dowm from heaven
Infinite Sodom and firefuck awaits
Tear their wings from angelic flesh
Bitch angels scream for mercy
Tremendous agony in the raping ground
My hommunculus in gnashing cunnifingus
Cunt diabolus behold majestic rape war in hell
I personally executed the jesu worm
I laughed as his brain fell from his holy fucking head
I personally saw to the Virgin Mary I Laughed She wept
Sick indulgence depravity majestic debauchery
Great War in the raping ground <start> Fuckin' pissed off man gary's my best friend and he kinda turned his back on me he fuckin' bailed
Dennis actually sat down was like you don't want this album to be about Danny
Danny's in the past now you need to move on
You need to look forward to your future and I was like you're right you're right and um
I sat down and and I rewrote most of most of the record with Dennis
So here we fucking go
You're going down you're on your own
Blow your oooown
This hate is endless
Tonight I think I'll cross the line
I'll cross the fucking line
I'll cross the fucking liiiine
The hate is relentless
Go
Here we go
Down
Down this hole
I've lost control
Save me
Go
Here we go
Down
Down this hole
I've lost control
Save me
Picking up picking up
Another life
Waking up waking up
From all the lies
Sometimes it ends sometimes you fall
Crossing out the man that I've become
I'm standing tall
Stronger than I ever did before
Against them all
I know that you have locked me in your eyes
I can't resist it
The target on your chest is all that I can see
Fight me now
It's not over
No no no it's not over
Pick me up off the ground just once more
So on I go on I go
But never alone
Sometimes it ends
Sometimes you fall
Crossing out the man that I've become
I'm standing tall
Stronger than I ever did before
Against them all
Now it's my turn to drag you through this hell
Through this hell
I won't forgive
I won't let go of what you've done
Oh
Woke up alone
So sick of this game
I've spent too many years in this house of pain
If you can't find the words read between the lines
So take it or leave it to me
So take it or leave it to me from here this time
Ah it was hard to sort of switch off 'cause I was still angry inside but
I just I mean then again it might be something about that not pursuing
'Cause being a musician and an artist I write about what's fueling what I'm feeling at the time
But a lot of how I'm feeling is excitement and I am happy
And I am extremely grateful to still be going so
I just have to concentrate more of that sort of like for the new record
Then you know use my energy in hindsight in a negative way
Which it completely would have been had Dennis not called me out and said stop being a pussy
Which is cool <start> I am only solitary tree standing in the main field
Which hasn't heart but still it hurt him.
Right to small girl alighted chilly cry full of loss
To the land when attired I was from the land when I put off clothes.
In that land under stormy heavy clouds wheeled round black birds.
Oh looked so sad the young knight which life in battle loses.
From my branches Tallis threw him the shred to he twined his wounds
But he pressed it to lips and gripped in palm.
Across heroic land but winds from hell propelled further
To bodies of dead and dying to last gulped.
It was fear which led her hand when she painted stones
Her belief in twinkle burnt low when she saw hags.
Beings worse than creatures
Which to deads the heads cut.
Though already she put them to flight
Now for their prey they were in a hurry again.
No Go away
Tallis left the land
Willy to restore the rain of stone
But she sight scathach nolonger
Only black veil sign of triumph.
She wept and love was rough sea in her.
She lost him but still didn't believe in it.
Although she wanted to shout his name alighted from tree
Into the night smoke rose he never heard her again.
Only I the solitary tree standing in the main field
Which has no heart but still it hurt him
Which didn't manage to say her that the way there is the way back
Sad spirit resides in him which only for her sing this song. <start> The alarm clock rings I open my eyes
And watch the yellowed white of my room's ceiling
The dull light of the dawn falls through my window
Raindrops are hitting the ground
The splattering sound promises me a day
Full of depressive thoughts
I torture myself out of bed
It's time to go to work
Live your life in your own way
Free and full of fun
Keep on smiling every day
Think  but never get depressed
Follow the golden rule
Never loose your humor man
Never forget  N.L.Y.H.
The work today is like everytime
Tiring boring and grey
Nine hours later I'm at home again
Time to have some food
Now I want to disperse my thoughts
So I switch on the TV
TVclowns grin like they want to show
How good they have cleaned their teeth
Live your life in your own way
Free and full of fun
Keep on smiling every day
Think  but never get depressed
Follow the golden rule
Never loose your humor man
Never forget  N.L.Y.H.
But the news
Confirms my thoughts of a sick world
Can't believe
What some men are able to do
Our fate
The future of a billion souls
Lays in
The hands of a few fools
Tired I switch off the TV
Time to go to bed
Tomorrow's day won't bring anything new
But nevertheless I'm glad
I think that I have recognized
The things for what they are
I'm alive and that's all that counts
I learned to laugh in the face of fear
Live your life in your own way
Free and full of fun
Keep on smiling every day
Think  but never get depressed
Follow the golden rule
Never loose your humor man
Never forget  N.L.Y.H. <start> Lyrics Albert Bell  Music Forsaken
This resurrected withering pain
Deafening my silence
A haunting revisited
Weakening my resilience
Maelstroms of indignity
Forged in hate
Tribal steel
Carving your fate 
....Wither the Hour
Instinctual attrition
A path through the sublime
Caress your slumber
Savour the taste of the pilgrim's grime
Sacrificial Masque
Twilight of the virginal dawn
Blood enthroned
Anonymity forever forlorn

Chorus
A vortex to impure
Slowly murdering my inner sanctum
Dreams so obscure
Brandishing the end of my Elysium
The wounds of my nemesis
A testimony to a lusting hunger
I awaken alone in the cusp of the untamed primal hunter
Ceremonies of impulse
Rebirth of a deafening humanity
This art of retribution
Reprisal for lost aeons of subtlety
Lost aeons of subtlety
Chorus
A vortex to impure
Slowly murdering my inner sanctum
Dreams so obscure
Brandishing the end of my Elysium <start> Missed my only chance to live in happiness
I guess we'll live alone or die of loneliness
Why's life
Why's life why's life so hard
Why's life why's life so hard
Why's life why's life so hard
Why's life why's life
Why's life
Why's life why's life so hard
Why's life why's life so hard
Why's life why's life so hard
Why's life why's life so hard

Your life is waiting for so much more
Your life is waiting for so much more
Your life is waiting for so much more

Beast of possessions licking your blood From burned stumps their future's cut Denial of
freedom denial of salvation denial of life for their salvation Dominion's been revealed and

Modern war is not just about a conflict which has to be solved. Todays leading nations
use their destructive war machinery to achieve power and political influences for future
economical actions. No matter what the consequences are for the freedom and will of the
people who live in the regions of interest. And reality strikes again. <start> If I could know the way this ends
I'd then understand
I'll live What it is to be made from the best of you
Let my hands make movement for hearts of the tested few
If I could know the way 
The way this ends
I'd then understand

If I could know the way

I'd see the glory in these hands
I'm placing stone upon stone
But this castle is falling faster than my hands
They gained the west wall
Fall back to the stables
Prepare for the last stand
I end here you start now
Like iron sharpens iron
I will make you better
You will make me my best
Like sea salt to my skin 
Without you I am but a tasteless man
If I could know the way 
The way this ends
I'd then understand

If I could know the way

I'd see the glory in these hands
This is end this is end
This armor weighs but I will fight till I face the sky
If I could know the way

If I could know the way 
The way this ends
I'd then understand

If I could know the way

I'd see the glory in this <start> ...
Keines Menschen Namens

Ihn kennt nur die Klte

Durch den Nebel der Zeit

Die Schlachten um ein Knigreich

... <start> It is no mystery
What you get is what you see
You betrayed my loyalty
You've gone and done me wrong
Now I do you harm
My revenge is guaranteed
You stabbed me in the back
Spit right in my eye
Dragging me into the fray
Take you out right you off there's never enough
Ways to throw you away
Chorus
You'd better start runnin'
'Cause you know that I'm comin'
Cocked and loaded and I never miss
I'm onto your game
And I'm layin' the blame
And I'm addin' your name to my blacklist
You shoulda thought twice
'Cause your playin' with your life
You must have some sort of death wish
I haven't any doubt
That your time has run out
'Cause I've added your name
To my blacklist
You tried to beat me
Thought you could defeat me
But how you we ever wrong
I rise to the occasion
Character assassination
To put you down where you belong
You've got a lot to say
When I'm so far away
Now you've got a problem with me
Take you out write you off when I've had enough
Of your verbal debris
Chorus
For all the shit you talk
You've never walked the walk
All you do is run and hide
Slander me slag me
I'm not a man you should deride
I've heard everything
All your mudslinging
You better run as fast as you can
Take you out write you off are you brave enough
To stand and fight like a man
Chorus <start> 
Irritation Irritation
Ye are always waiting for
Invitation

Blow away the castle wall
Ye as one are Dark's creatures.
Ye'll have gotten this salvation.
Ye wilt drive to desperation anyone...
And so shalt we
We used to see a GOD  OUR GOD
SO WHAT
Time to know Time to know
Time to kill wilt come at once
Break the wall Look out the law
Don't ye want to look above
Your diseases and your wish 
There are ye as headless fish there...
In either event we shalt throw out
Your heinous bowels
Please leave thy castle again
'Till we'd like to feel thy might
But we won't have been waiting too long
And soon the sunset will kill us all
'CAUSE In GOD we trust
But ye are servants of Satan
Whilst ye submit to his laws 
There is no need to speak of honour
Of the eternal life 
Ye have kept your death as knife
While we stay here
Please our master
Do not leave us alone
Ye leftOUR GODin churches
Having fed him with stone by stone
But when ye had come in one day...
We have found our Lord was gone
What's done cannot be undone
But we have felt that something's wrong...
Because your rope broke under the strain...
We'll take the chain
And build
Your gallowstree again.
We've seen the pair of glowing eyes 
With fear we watch as they do shine
Make them forsake us like an aim 
Make them await
Until we fade
Away
In a sewerage of time.
Devil Devil art thou here
Thou won't bore and disappear
Can't thou leave our mansions for a while
Thou who whilest away the time
On our tables while we dine...
Thou wilt feed us all until we die

a household petbut when it was twirled 'round was revealed to

he's the Young Generation dancing troupe tying to perform country and western
Do a dance here

NEVER since birth not eaten in a day
Never since courtship stayed up some nights
HE had the 'Kingdom of Evil' book under a German history book
he was contrived like that See what flows from his mushy pen

He's here. I saw him I swear on the thingy floor
up on the brown baize lift shaft he's here He's here at last <start> The gift of poison
I'm the right mistake
Cruel words can heal me
Touch  a gentle disease
Where skies are green
The grass burns red
Terminal youth outlives me
Sight  an abstract sense
I'm the worst theory
Your downfall my majesty
In this restless syndrome
I'll drown the flavours
Such an innocent crime
Taste  my ascending demise <start> No matter what they say or do
The shit they write well it ain't true
Coloured eyes hypnotize
Go and sell some other lies
The losers and the hangers on
Want one thing and then they're gone
Smile at you
Shake your hand
Steal you money
Destroy your band
Work it out
Why don't you kill yourself
Work it out
Can't trust nobody else
Work it out
This evil never dies
Work it out
You're better than the rest
Trivialize the human condition
Loneliness is just a premonition
Visualize this weakened link
None of these losers ever think
Take them
Take them down hard
Show them no mercy
Oh yeah this life is hard
Work it out
Why don't you kill yourself
Work it out
Can't trust nobody else
Work it out
This evil never dies
Work it out
You're better than the rest
Work it out
Work it out
Why don't you kill yourself
Work it out
Can't trust nobody else
Work it out
This evil never dies
Work it out
You're better than the rest <start> Black Legions ravening for blood
Dark Lords hearken to my call
Warriors rise forth from the earth
Battlespells empower me
The Throne of Kings the summoning
Marble halls sunk 'neath the waves
Stormwolves a prowl  the ebon moon
Immortal hordes pledge me thine steel
The clarion call of battle sounds
Iron gleams in baleful flame
Slaughter shines from misted eyes
Stormforged blade drink deep.
Stench of carnage fires my blood
My bride of steel sings in my hand
Corpsemounds piled to touch the sky
Black fury enshroud me
Bleed for the gods of war
Flesh to sate the worms
By this sword I rule
Dreadful fall of slaughter
Raw scent of freshspilled blood
Crimson rain falls from the sky
Ravens ride the storm.
Black cloud of arrows red storm of swords
Dark wave of carnage... slaughterfall
By blood and steel I rule <start> Raindrops chase the ground
Whip around boiling sound of
Thunder takes the air
Cracks of laughter everywhere.
Raindrops hail the air
Lightnings wince in great despair
A burning roofs once scared now sighs
As flames turn into moistened air.
Raindrops veil the sky
The final curtain of fire
Amazingly they fly
An ancient sacred lullaby.
Blazing walls of stone
Now blasting in the pouring rain
To be revealed the pain
Dispelled the wicked smell
Of mould and drain.
Oh Precious Haze Pervade The Pain
Cool down that aching spine
Make anger starve
Wrath is drowned while shivering.
Oh Precious Haze Pervade The Land
The morrow will find peace
Trees regain their former strength
And sigh away the shades of pain.
On a night such as this
He stood there
Underneath them clouds
In divine innocence
The rain ran down
His cheeks and chin
On a night such as this
His gaze approver them clouds
He was painting the storm
and the wind
and he cried and he grinned.
Text  Music Kailer <start> Forgive me Father for I've sinned
I am a child of fire and the master of winds
But I'm still wide awake
Fingers grip out of my brain
No control my mind is lame
From the earth up to the trees I hear them calling me
The voices which rides on the breeze
Oh its haunting me in expectancy for your flesh
But this dream life is the only life
An everlasting astral dimension
The dream death is the only death
Total destruction of the soul
Within this astral plane I'll never be the same
Throwing myself at the sky while falling back to the ground
I'm off the earth but no one can hear my painful sound
I open the doors to the other side and step beyond mortality
Trapped in rage it bursts my veins so feel the pain
I breathe your name
It isn't just a nightscape vision painted in blood
Utopia consumed
The dark silhouettes move towards me
As I confess the morbid desire
And I witness all the falling souls consumed <start> With but a gesture of my incorporeal hand I illumine the heart of a newborn sun
Revelling as its searing stellar radiance engulfs my ersatz form.
Gazing out across the limitless stygian cosmos
I hear the whispered voice of destiny echoing within the solar winds...
No small task to awaken a universe from slumber. <start> Fragile quiet and distant as flesh against another
Heroism suppressed leavin' hunger in its wake
Tired even of sleep
A fragment of life no more pain
The nights they will drag on
These hands will not abide
A nightmare beckons leavin' death in its wake
The sickness is a dream
Imprisoned in the deep of the stone
Reality restin' upon pillars of dust
The infinite voracious arms of myth
Trying to even out sleep
With death in our way <start> 
Wanted dead or alive

I don't know which way to go
Fuck it might as well go both
'cause these niggas want my soul
Get these mother fuckers trying to reload
Got my index on the trigger
Screaming why am I selling figure
Introduce you to your digger
Put your ass beside the vicar
See I know where you hang
You got some killers in your gang
Plus I'm gon be the blame
For leaving the mother fucker unrestrained
Piper shots to the brain bitch
Say my name and watch me get the five shots
Shooting nine lots
Give me props
I shoot a cop then I watch his body drop
Gotta make this crooked cop stop it
If I go to the pen watch my back and we can all break out
I'm screaming free me
Until we get parole I'm shaking D.P
Believe me I'm a kill them on T.V with the glock on the repeat
Putting all their souls deep you're watered down and so weak
Dead or alive so recognise that I got shots for my guys
Between your eyes mother fucker Rapalot for life


Don't want to hang out
Want to grab this tek and blow my brains out
Nigga you got some problems I got my own don't call my name out
If the bullets rang out
For the fuck why they want to see me
Who the fuck gon want to be me
Lay down and know that you're free
Kill the bullshit 'cause a nigga gon bullshit
Smoke weed and worry
Separate keys get dirty
I'm calling on God he's worth it he's worth it
My daddy left me lonely
My friend that I call my homey
Who got me just like only
Keeping the dark trying to ride this pony
My nigga Mo is locked up

Mother fucker made up break all this bullshit

And still most wanted


See I'm stressed with pain
My Grandmama told me that I was blessed with the game
I took it and I sold my whole life to the game
So everything I thought my whole heart I gave
From Gpacks to weed packs
It's going to give me problems I really don't need that
See I got a boy on my back
That I been running since them ways back
Tell Uncle Sam that I'm gon stay black
And fuck those silly cars stirring my shit up under this six flat
And tell them hoes who be diamond kissers
Trying to take control of a niggas riches
They can get they nose out a niggas business for it
Down here treying to set the wife off the fix and I don't play that
Praying for my downfall I'm making
Dome shots on all y'all
Got us retaliating like outlaws
Dead or alive mother fucker I'm black bro
 <start> Ich kann es nicht mehr messen.
Es trgt sich das das was schwimmt.
Bist Du denn nicht beide
Bist Du nicht alleine
Bist Du nicht mein Verlangen
Wo wir doch so weit unten sind
Ist meine frische Lorain denn krank
Und Du Du liegst nur dort und harrst 
Viele Hekatombe
verlieren sich in toter See.
Verrucht zu zein
ist gar so schndlich 
Doch so ist mein Verlangen
nun kann ich mit dir untergehen 
Ist meine frische Lorain denn krank
Und Du Du liegst nur dort und harrst  <start> In the cold twilight I stand
Watching the rise of the moon
In my deep dreaming eyes
The reflection shines so clear
With the burning eyes of a wolf
The moonscape I behold
I can hear the souls astray
Whisper from the shadows
Oh beutiful night
Thou art my mistress
Enshrouded in thy mysticism
Forever I will be
Enwrapped in the darkness
I wander across the fields
Of this haunted land in solitude
Enlightened by the moon
I am eternal a life immoral in darkness
Alone I have wandered in the mysteries eternal
In my dreams
I spread my wings
Oh the winds are calling
My cursed name
In tranquillity
I fly into eternity
The silence is broken
By my screams
Oh mysterious night thou art my silent mistress
Make me once more one with the dark
Like a black raven I fly across the haunted fields
Immortality
Runs thick through my veins
In endless shadowed time
I've wandered through the night
Ensnared by the moonlight
I howl upon the dark
Raptured by the winds
That whispers in forbidden tongues
I am eternal a life immortal in darkness
Alone I have wandered in the mysteries eternal <start> If you're hurt by someone
Hold out the other cheek
This is the most important message
That someone left to humanity
Then you came with your holy book
Then you spread this holy gift
Bible in one hand a sword in the other
To slay all people thinking different
Holy man I reny your church
Too many slaughters've been done
Holy man I won't pray for your god
For he let you kill in his name
Remember this innocent people
Devoured by flames for being different
In these dark times of heresy
When devil was every woman
Remember this dirty unbelievers
They died by their brothers' swords
Covered with crusades blood
Murdered for the holy cause
Holy man I reny your church
Too many slaughters've been done
Holy man I won't pray for your god
For he let you kill in his name
Hypocrit priest of hate
You forgot what you exist for
In your mouth love means death for anyone
But the sheep that follows your insane path
Let us think by ourselves
We don't need your misleading talk
Let us remember what love means
Centuries of lies made us forget
Holy man I reny your church
Too many slaughters've been done
Holy man I won't pray for your god
For he let you kill in his name <start> The word is out
That rock is in
And everyone is banging heads again
You and your mates
You want it all
You take your place at the front of the concert hall
The house lights dim
The stage is set
You're gonna take all that you can get
All you can get
Chorus
Let's go crazy
Let's go insane
Me and the boys are rockin out again
Cut loose
Everybody cut loose
Cut loose
Everybody cut loose
Turn it up
Start to grind
It's got the power to blow your mind
Raise a fist
Cuts through the air
Scream and yell show me that you care
Show me you care
Chorus
Come feel the heat
And energy
Electric force sets your spirit free
Let it out
No holding back
Cutting loose There's no turning back
No turning back
Chorus <start> And who can ever forget this one
Six times parking
Six four
Form bar and six
Form a box line
The aphid
The aphid
Bend down
Scratch around the carpet for insect
Get hook clamp stand up
Gel frame put insect in a jar
The aphid
Walk back two three and four
Stop for a rest
Go back to scratch
The aphid
Hook clamp
Go back down
Scratch around the floor
Take hook clamp and put in jar
The aphid
Cover up with gel frame
Take two times four O O O one
UV gun back go back to the floor
Scratch around five six supplied
The aphid
Bend right back
Form a box line sidecar
The aphid
Twenty times steps back
Frizzo get hook clamp
Turn to barn door
Retrieve kill frame

Take six bottles of the six back stand up straight
Then bend down and scratch the carpet for insects
And if you find any put the insects into the jar
Then check the clamp on the jar and take six steps back
Ensure the hook clamp is on the jar and that's the aphid <start> All has now been broken
On streets I dare not walk
Freedom is an illusion
I build my fences high
If there was something out there
I've learned not to expect
There's a hundred million reasons
Not to care
Don't bring it
Don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me
Don't bring it
Don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me
Wear misery's crown
As always in these matters
You broke the deal of deals
And wasted what was given
To revel in your mess
I gave up all for nothing
I tried my best and failed
There's a thousand million reasons

This is how it all begins
This is how it all begins
Don't bring it
Don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me
Don't bring it
Don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me
Wear misery's crown
This is how it all begins
Come now
Come now
Come now
Don't bring it
Don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me
Don't bring it
Don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me
Wear misery's crown <start> Free you say you're gonna be
Me I don't at all agree
The facts of life you don't see
Either truth or reality
Don't let my words bring you down
Just keep on trying
I just can't say that you will be free
If I did I'd be lying
Countries they have all governments
It's not how the world was meant
Power in the hands of fools
They are all the devil's tools
Revolution will set you free
But only temporarily
To fight in stages time  time again
Or we face eternal darkness and pain
We are living at the end of time
It's the worst and best for human kind
Fight to the end that's our destiny
Until all evil hearts are gone or set free
The lion will lie down with the lamb
That we don not understand
Predator is not a natural state
Creation bound in eternal hate
You know evil won't go away
And that it is here to stay
Until the redeemer comes
The fight goes on and on and on
Don't let my words bring you down
Just keep on trying
I just can't say that you will be free
If I did I'd be lying <start> Lighting storms
Descend across the sky
Arrival of the horned
The coming of our lord
Lucifer
Thy legions are set free
Demon hordes
Awaiting his return
Dark age
Kingdoms lost in shadows
Fallen empires
Cursed by unholy lord
Abominations
Buried into ashes
Ancient realms forlorn
Into eternal darkness
Damned domains in darkness
Eclipse of land forlorn
Ruins of a kingdom gone
Once ruled by god
When angels forever die
When Satan has arrived
When Satan rules the world for eternity
Lighting storms
Descend across the sky
Arrival of the horned
The coming of our lord
Lucifer
Thy legions are set free
Demon hordes
Awaiting his return
Storms of damnation
Caress the mourning sky
Demon hordes from realms below
Show the mighty force of hell
When angels forever die
When Satan has arrived
When Satan rules the world for eternity <start> It's a sick sick world.
Die laughing die w passion. die fast and go out blasting.
When the only thing that matters is GI Joes this world is
Less complex I suppose. if time froze at the age of innocence
Life at it's purest form. the simplest. recognize change starts
From within. remember before we started to sin and kids
Were allowed to be kids where's the innocence
Die laughing die w passion. die fast and go out blasting.
Fuck the world. keep blasting.
They say there's something wrong with us. maybe we lost
Touch maybe we fucked up. but I don't think there's
Something wrong with us I think you lost touch. I think
You fucked up. point the finger at your self this time.
Do we love our children or neglect them when they speak
Do you listen do you pay attention pay attention. kids are
Starving for attention. for so long. ask yourself where did
We go wrong
Call me insane. the internet has corrupted my brain.
Desensitized by video games. pulling me in. making me sin.
Recognize change starts from within.
It's a sick sick world. hahaha. who's laughing now <start> I'm felling anger I feel rage
You see it coming from a mile away
Built up inside I lose control
My blood boils I can't take it anymore
Do what I want do what I say
It's you that makes me act this way
You are my reason to un load
And I am ready to explode
Someone tell me why I'm feeling
Like I want to give a beating
Rage absolute I got rage
This fury it starts to build
An eruption set to blow
The explosion and the aftermath
Never happened you know
So irritating and so frustrating
I hate everything that you do
But you can't leave me you can't deceive me
Or I'll run you
It's in my blood is what you say they're all like me
Perfectly acceptable to rage in the family <start> At the end of the day
the warrior takes place
beside the bonfire
taling us his tales.
His tales of fates tales of hope
when all hope is gone
surrounded by dark darkness
we'are able to see the stars. <start> Hammer drives home the third and final nail this twisted disfigurement adjoined spiritually to the cross I call home one thousand eyes do not lament when you fuse upon me for I choose this existence watch them dance their intoxicated dance the acrid stench of the tools of their trade the hate felt for those once like me who have chosen to fall from their cross exists unequaled one thousand feet incessant tattoo scarred earth sacrilege filth covers mother of all bastard child attempts matricide hang my head in misery but my eyes will not shut out the screams scars run deep reopen with a word rivers form lakes of torment for them to find sustenance in here I will stay nailed to my cross alone as I was in the beginning <start> Where once a naive child learnt the ropes of life and pain
An ashen path has forged to view those remnants with disdain
As leaves descending earthward are a seasonal display
Within those trees and subtle breeze I fell to grace today
Where once a sheltered boy had learnt the sadness of his past
An ashen path has forged to burn the memories at last
As snakes discard their fettered skin and carry on the same
Without that flesh the life is fresh as though reborn again
Shadows of a candle once adorned
With ambiance beneath a dying flame
Unending is the grief so long alone
The crying light to death reborn again
Reborn again
Reborn again
Today the snakes lie naked
And the land's adorned with leaves
And I rest upon the sunset
With a soul that's learnt to breathe
Today I fell to grace
Amongst a thousand rising embers
Beneath the sky they fade and die
At last... lest I remember <start> 
Act I
He turns the t.v. high the walls are paper thin
He hopes the neighbor folks aren't listening
He's killed his wife with words confident it's private rage
When up goes the curtain and he is on the stage
He's on the stage
God sees it all
He has total recall
It is an art
Hiding murder in your heart
ACT 
The show is over he pours himself a drink
Best to forget about it put a record on
The stereo and try not to think
And the record plays
This is your life you beat your wife
We'll spare the gory details and simply say
Recording artist
Gods hears it all
He has total recall
Your sneaky moves
Are right here in the grooves
Act 
He puts his car in gear got to get out of here
Going somewhere far away
But through the headlight beams
He sees the billboard screen
His fight last night is on display
You're on display
God sees it all
He has total recall
Your bloody crime
Is up there on the sign <start> instrumental <start> 



































 <start> Make all the cold trees mourn
Their branches frozen in sightless motion
Waving reaching for the whipping rain
There was silence and the firmament withdrew
Revealing all shapelessly and swiftly
In carmine and crimson stood flaming the sky
The relics of myths that exploded and died
Dismantle the sun and stars in their rise
And rend from the skyline the black in our eyes
The skyline so empty all but one nonexistent
Words were not nor gesture thought or life
The sky dancers laid slain and old
The firmament in perpetual withdrawal <start> Did it pay the rent did it bring her back did it win
The race was it worth the price of becoming his
Whore and her yours but you just wanted her back. she
Is yours. she was only on loan. america forgot her
Face. but we sure as hell didn't forget yours. we did
Not win but time is money and money is power. we did
Not win just like he planned so move along. so it's
True. he did do her just like daddy did. with
Deception in his pocket. he sold her. I'm the victim
Here. I've got this tragedy. I'm the victim here. I've
Got political power. you disgraced her memory one last
Time. and ten strikes for the one who told us all to
Fuck off. so what does it matter you are still a
Bitter tool in bed with him a tired whore. I'm the
Victim here. I'm getting paid. I'm the victim here.
I'm collecting. a celebration of politically correct's
Rebirth. a new liberal celebrity to save us all from
Ourselves and lead us to right. a celebration of
Politically correct's death. <start> For so long I've been walking on the path of my life
This way it hurts my feet but bravely I'm going on
Straight ahead with no staff to support me
Around me the landscape remains the same
It used to please me it now turned grey
Around me I see barriers to infinity
I cannot escape my destiny
A long time ago this way I've chosen
Cause I couldn't cope with suffering
A sign said Felicity at the end
I started walking and now I'm going on
For too long I've been walking on the path of my life
On its sides bushes have turned into barb wire
For too long I've been walking on the road of my faith
It has now turned into the darkest corridor
All I want is to fly away to leave this gloomy road
I'm now waking up n'Don't want to follow it anymore
But wings I don't own my salvation is lost
As I'm used to I keep walking on and on
As I reach the bottom of my doom
A light appears and shines through the night
This is not the end of my road it's another path
It snakes away to another life
For too long I've been walking on the path of my life
Time has come to make the choice
For too long I've been walking on the road of my faith
Pray for me to do the best <start> The bells of war doth chime tonight
And the heavens shake with fear
The earth commot the sky is in flames
The battle is ever near
Troops of Hell tonight they storm
The walls they so despise
Heaven's gates are closing in
The night is filled with cries
WAR WAR WAR
A crack of thunder a smell of death
The wind of mayhem blows
Heaven in its final breath
And God lose all control
Prayers for mercy cries for help
Won't stop the blasphemy
Our troops emerge the sacred throne
And the victory is complete <start> Music DunkelkindEviga Lyrics Eviga
Ein unterhalb von Schmerz
Entsetzen tief im Herz
In Dunkelheit hier unten
weg von der Welt der Bunten.
Kein Entkommen in Sicht
nicht hier  nicht dort
Von Klte genossen
ein grausamer Ort.
ber mir die Todesboten
Sie wnschen mich zu letzter Ruh'
Schnbel nie geschlossen
Ihr Verlangen betrt mich immerzu.
Was zu tun dir bleibt ist zu vermissen
du bist allem und dem Glck entrissen
Deine Zukunft Narr ist lngst vergangen
denn in den Schluchten der Klte bist Du gefangen.
Anders mein Wille er gibt nicht nach
Er bewahrt mich vpr des Todes Schmach.
Vermag dem Leben nicht zu entsagen
Ist bedingungsloser Hoffnungstrger
will immer nur wagen wagen
und wei Antwort auf des Zweifels Fragen. <start> Back from a furious
slaughter in pain
Trapped in this universe
completely insane
No more confusion
inside his head
Traveled through darkest hell
He's back from the dead
straight back from hell
His mission is obvious
evil and plain
Destruction for all of us
for his own gain
No absolution
from terror and dread
Nowhere to hide from him
He's back from the dead
straight back from hell
Maybe we're strong enough
to fight against his rage
Maybe we're strong enough
to live and tell the tale
He's back from the dead
straight back from hell
He's back from the dead
straight back from hell

He's back from the dead
straight back from hell
He's back from the dead
straight back from hell
Back from the dead
Straight back from hell
Back from the dead
Straight back from hell
Back from the dead
Straight back from hell
Back from the dead
 <start> Sin separates from GOD
JESUS separates from sin <start> Jeg dyrker rttene
Til min egen vrede
Og ser mine spirer gro
I en kamp mot minegen glede
prver jeg slikke mine sr
Da jeg ikke lenger lot dem drepe
Og jeg s kilden til minegen ro
Skal minegen spire av meg selv
Bli til en mektig skog <start> What kind of a man is a man
who lives in the kingdom of tyrants
What kind of a man is a man
who calls you with the voice of sirens
That man hates everything
in you and your existence
That man hates everything
from you and gives you nothingness
Still you keep crawling before his eyes
Still you refuse to
refuse to reach into the light
and the pattern keeps repeating itself
What kind of a man is a man
who can blame someone else for his sins
What kind of a man is a man
whose image becomes clear
when darkness descends
That man does not have a name
some call him Master
That man does not give you choice
Still you feel some kind of attraction
Still you keep crawling before his eyes
Still you refuse to
refuse to reach into the light
and the pattern keeps repeating itself
God of reptiles
God of reptiles
Beware
God of reptiles
God of reptiles
You will betray yourself you will
You will hate yourself you will
You will lose yourself you will
You will see your finger on the trigger
You will see you will feel
That your world is in flames
And everything you've got is emptiness
You will see you will feel
That this is not a game
And your god is merciless
Still you keep crawling before his eyes
Still you refuse to
refuse to reach into the light
and the pattern keeps repeating itself
God of reptiles
God of reptiles
Beware <start> Welcome to my inner world baby
I dont feel either pain or hate
I just dont know whether you can carry the weight of my fervour
On the whole Im happy and satisfied
Perhaps I just feel a little bitter aftertaste of my silliness
Which I have learnt to swallow like alcohol gained from oil
Forgive me I did not perceive you at the moment when kisses from star were coming and my
transcendental memory was ousting everything passing
I cannot explain why these abnormal states take such a long time
You should have kept your mouth shut and watch soap operas
Anyway it suits you best when you are under turning your cheek with mouth open <start> White Then you look away.
You reach for assistance when you start to sway.
Knees feel weak as your vision fades away.
When you're faced with death that's when you start to pray.
Blind Now you can see the myths you create about reality.
Darkness on the streets you let the world deceive you.
In my company reality will greet you.
Psyche...Check...Check
Cry to me as your vision fades away.
Gonna rate your sickness by your will to stay.
Blind. Now you don't see. No why. No where. No way.
You're better off to pray.
Darkness on the streets you let the world deceive you.
In my company reality will greet you.
Psyche...Check...Check...Check
Someday gonna have to say someday gonna wanna have a real dark day
Someday someday gonna pay for play someday I'm gonna show a real quick
Way...to see your life flash before your eyes.
White then you look away.
I sense your resistance as you start to sway.
Knees feel weak as your vision fades away.
Cause now you're faced with death and it's there's no use to pray.
Blind...Now you don't see.
I know why know where no way better fuckin' pray.
No why no where no way better fuckin' pray
Darkness on the streets you don't let the your world deceive you.
In my company reality will greet you. 
Darkness on the streets don't let the world deceive you.
In my company reality will greet you.
Darkness on the streets you let the world deceive you.
In my company reality will greet you.
Psyche...Check...Check...Check

 <start> War is much more than a disagreement of thought and a battle born of strife
Where many will stand and many will fall while bystanders will question the point
And the players are many the sacrifice great for a victory heralded by few
And some march to the beat of a vindictive drum with their own agendas to right
Well I'm one of those who'll step up for battle the smell of cordite in the air
Knowing the ordeal is not about me but treating it as such just the same
With irreverence I tread through the blood and the soil the wounded dying and dead
I want them to taste the steel of my blade and feel the sting of my lead
And sometimes they'll hear the bullet yes sometimes they'll feel it's sting and sometimes they'll know as their life slips
away and sometimes they won't feel a thing
'Cause I wanna be and I wanna see and I'm here to exact my revenge
When I summon Mars for victory sweet when I conjure the will for success
And I wanna taste the blood of the fallen to know the scent of death
And that every round that I get off yields another's final breath <start> you arms that take
your arms invertebrate
venomousconstricting and cold
blood warms to life
tongue flickers in time
vibrations awaken your soul
the mind sheds away
you circle breakswerve and stay
you stare so deep you rise so tall
you gently swayyour silhouette writhes and plays
its poison up on the wall
drumming hearts they sync and then slow
you whisper songs of peace and of home
whisper promise though don't show what you see
when those black diamonds stare straight through to me
flicker in time
gently entwine
daggers slide sharper than pain
rise uparound
liquid and vapor
a warmth that creeps up through my veins
now is your time
and ive walked this line
while you slid down deep in my soul
i fade away as you breathe your song heavy
and i take my show on the road
slide on black racerslide on. <start> were you expecting a prayer from me
take this thing off my face
but don't let them know i said that
oh nevermind
without my mask you wouldn't recognize me
we wanted to see you so bad
even when you thought i didn't
i always always always did
what was i to do with
thoughts of losing you
it's hard to talk to you
hazyhead clouded with marinol
this one's king size
oma we'll be waiting

Beeeyach ugh
Ah ah <start> Please stay awake
Our defining moment struck
The power faithless
Struck
While we were contemplating visions
Visions ran us by
Immortal
Yet decayed
Oh truth this bitter lie
Though it burns like hell's fire
Scorched are all but us
Did ambition not prevail
While mortal seasons fled
We seize this carving
Here and now
Or the earth shall strike us
Dead <start> here we go again
feeling so small inside
I could implode
humiliated
by my own ways of weakness
wash me white as snow
let me start again
oh let your warm breeze blow away all this filth in my soul
reaching out my hands
letting it out before my head explodes
then liberated
restoration through forgiveness
wash me white as snow
let me start again
oh let your warm breeze blow away all this filth in my soul
wash me white as snow
lift me up again
oh let your mercy flow
give me life so I can live
and so now I can once again lift my head up high
shamelessly look into anyone's eyes
because when I'm weak then you are strong
yeah I will leave condemnation and sin behind
confidently marching forward with this in mind
you are right when I am wrong
I will not let go I will not give in
'cause he told me so by his love I'll win <start> Under black moon flamed a fire
like storm the time all dreams has gone
and the time of might has dawned
as the stars she shines in a darkest sky.
Fiery hearts of mountains throbbed
oceans ran shores wept alone
paths misguided winds raped the trees
until the silence dropped on its knees.
Soror...Mystica.
Chorus
They laid their gazes to the ground
at the ancient graves of time
and mountains embraced them
ceased all the changes made.
Under thousand stars extinguished a fire
took the blackened throat of flame
we cry for emptiness we cry for coldness
still is the sky motionless why.
But in the mist under burning steams
smiles with the mask of death on her face
believing and giving to the darkness the strenght.
Soror...Mystica
Chorus X
They laid their... <start> Reden wird er Knig vor sieben Jahren.
Das Ross des Nordens goldbedeckt... tot
Merlin im tiefen Grabe wehklagend also spricht
Ich hab' das Wort des Rtsels und ach sie hren's
nicht Das Wort an dem die Zukunft die Gegenwart sich
kennt  nur einen Tag um ander'n zu sagen ist's vergnnt
Wie Merlin mchte' ich durch die Wlder zieh'n
Was die Strme wehen was die Donner rollen und die Blitze wollen
Was die Bume sprechen wenn sie brechen
mchte' ich wie Merlin verstehen.
Die Weisen aber kommen stets an dem falschen Tag
Und fragen viel hinunter den letzten Dingen nach.
Dann horchen sie vergeblich am Rand der Zaub'rergruft
Denn eines Tages ruf ich's vergeblich in die Luft
Wenn Krieg kommen wird sich schwarz daherwlzend...
Ach km' am rechten Tage der rechte Held daher
Empfinge mein Vermchtnis in meiner tiefen Leer'
Dann wrd' in froher Freiheit die Welt von ihm verweest
Vom Harren und vom ngsten die Kreatur erlst <start> If I allow the light to leave my eyes I will never see again.
The thoughts disintegrate into cognitive pollution.
Abandoning my body renouncing my existence.
Show me the meaning of happiness.
Trapped inside this nightmare but I haven't slept for days.
I am a slave a slave to what I cannot see.
Are we being strung along or are we just strung out
The quest to be clairvoyant You are your own black hole.
How much longer do I really have when I wish every breath would be my last
Your words like rope tied around my throat. Remove the earth beneath me.
Watch my spirit sink. <start> You hit rock bottom now where do you go from here
Sunk down locked up all you do is disappear
All your promises are all just a pack of lies
You've got nothing something you can't recognize
Why don't you take some responsibility
You're pointing fingers and blaming everybody
Shudder to think if I lived like you
They would be shaking too if they only knew
I can't take any more excuses
No longer needed and you don't have nay uses
Washed up washed out what more can I say
You better start filling out your resume
Why don't you take some responsibility
You're pointing fingers and blaming everybody
Shudder to think if I lived like you
They would be shaking too if they only knew
Everything was there for the taking
Too busy with the lying and flaking
Drugged up fell out too many second chances
Nothing else to do under the circumstances
Why don't you take some responsibility
You're pointing fingers and blaming everybody
Shudder to think if I lived like you
They would be shaking too if they only knew <start> I turn inside of myself  look back into my past 
into nothing  the best time in life  barely present
I wish I could go back  tell that little nice boy
to be stronger  to be brave
but I can't  he had his chance
I burn  scream  I despair on 
these thoughts of the past
I realize that I had barely lived
but just existed  it's too late now
and my thoughts feed on this grief  the grief
creates tears that burn my skin
unable to ease the pain  I float in hoplessness
for the time is gone and the boy is a man now
the end  a beginning for everything flows and
we live to change  live to learn
the future's still open and to be lived like
the past has been wasted
with hope in my heart I look forward <start> It's all been done before and
No one can listen to anyone's answers
They're drifting farther everyday
And they say
We hold our hands to block the sun
We blame the light for what we've done
We look away so We'll forget what We've become
First take what you want
Then you throw it away
This is the way of their world
Don't know what you've got
Until it's taken away
This is the way of your
World
When the night falls you know who you are
And you cast reflections as the mirror gathers rust
It's so safe and lonely with you
Lovers ripping in two
Grind away 'till nothing's left
There's nothing left inside
First take what you want
Then you throw it away
This is the way of their world
Don't know what you've got
Until it's taken away
This is the way of your
World
Your lives will fade before their time
And you'll never say goodbye
The end of all the things you know
And all of what you can be
It's fading fast before you
What we want we are <start> Mozda jednom kad dani prodju svi
Shvatis gde smo sada mi.
Da li nas priroda obmanjuje I sve je igra
Ili smo ipak deo nje
Zasto svaka prica ima kraj
Da li postoji druga sansa il' me vara osecaj.
Da li smo daleko od vecnosti il' ne vidimo
Da tu je negde oko nas
Dok vreme brzo prolazi pitas se gde smo sada mi
da li smo deo vecnosti...
I kada jednom dodje kraj
ti nikad neces mociznajda budes blizi istini
Da li neko odozgo vidi sve
Da li smo I mi deo igre njegove...
Zasto nam daje da se mucimo da verujemo
Da nikad nece doci kraj <start> Freezing winds of lands unnamable
Haunts the wastes of my soul
And time has come to join eternity...
To rest my eyes upon the darker shade of colour
This is the end and the beginning
As dimensions warped in time's motionless storms
The long awaited circle is close
And the gates stand open wide before me
Lie down and let your dreams attack
The silence of a soul that is real
Is the silence that you lack
I feel the strength pulsating through me
As I close the gates behind you
Dies ist das Ende deiner Existenz
Wenn sich dein Himmel zu Eis verwandelt
Und ein Hauch von Klte dein Blut erstarren lt
Werde ich deine Seele zerschmettern <start> We are the Fall
Northern white crap that talks back
We are not black. Tall.
No boxes for us.
Do not fuck us.
We are frigid stars.
We were spitting we were snapping Cop Out Cop Out
As if from heaven.

Potatoes in packs

Sucker blow. <start> They came to her house in the dead of night
They came to take her
Her mother screamed and her father cried
Let them take her
So the poor little bitch is taken as a witch
To the dungeon
There she is stripped and beaten with a whip
Then they raped her
And she liked it
So this is how you fuck with a crucifix
The poor little bitch well she likes it
So they held her down while they took their turn
They had to break her
Said she was evil and she would burn
Then they raped her
So why does this tale turn you on
Why does it excite you
'Cause we are beasts like the beasts in the wild
Or more like barnyard pigs
And you like it <start> I see the same face but so much else has changed.
I remember what you once meant to me.
You compromised astray.
Now I'm left with nothing but regret.
You died.
So look at yourself.
Are you better off now or then with your wealth and fame
All your followers believe your words.
Words you can't explain.
To do to say those things that meant so much to me.
You turned away.
Now you're gone.
There's nothing to believe.
I can't believe I ever believed in you.
Kill.
Let them die.
So I let them die.
Kill their past. <start> Friend or foe there's no way to know
In the battlefield of life its kill or be killed.
So many times its a matter of degrees
From being up on your luck to down on your knees.
Its a hellish inferno
This is war eternal.
They try to change you crush and break you.
Try to tell you what to do
They love to have control of you
Back against the wall
In danger of losing it all
Search deep inside
Remember who you are.
It's time like these when lines are drawn
Which side of the fence you are standing on
There will come a day not so far away
When the hunter becomes the prey .
Its a hellish inferno
This is war eternal.
They try to change you crush and break you.
Try to tell you what to do
They love to have control of you
Back against the wall
In danger of losing it all
Search deep inside
Remember who you are.
This is fucking war
They try to change you crush and break you.
Try to tell you what to do
They love to have control of you
Back against the wall
In danger of losing it all
Search deep inside
Remember who you are. <start> Without the shedding of the Blood
There is no remission of sin
The hour the veil was wrent
That is when it all began
This was not the covenant that was made with our Fathers on Sinai
The Blood of the New Covenant shed for the remission of sin
A man hanging on a tree
His blood gushing from His own flesh
Will you dare commit
Or be another to fall at Satan's hand
The Blood of the Covenant
A testament
A remission of sin <start> I dropped off in the shadows they lead over tragedy
I open my eyes  blind by the spotlight
and what do I see
Pushed by ambition been granted admission
to the hall of acclaim
She denied your affection
Now listen the whole world is screaming your name
I will forget her
but I won't forgive
The curtain has fallen
behold the messiah
Chorus
Riding high
the devil on the crest
for all the world to see  forevermore
I am I  the devil in the belfry
I'll be glorified  forevermore
Chorus
Is it a sin to learn to be able
to live without love
And is it a sin to put love under will
and control from above
Devil in my fingers  pleasure at my feet
Mind out of sight
The shadow I'll cast shall darken her world
And ghost her at night
With each song you'll die
A little for me
It won't leave a scar
'Cause I've drawn the curtain
Chorus
Into the opera like moths to the flame
Spellbind their senses to follow the hero
ChorusX <start> Like leaves on trees in fall
I'm shivering I'm falling
Like the screams from a newborn child
So innocent so fragile
Screaming struggling trying
I want to see what the future holds
This life in fear is no life at all
The will I had ain't strong enough
And the strength I seek ain't there
My world is dead
My future's broken
And it all stays the same
They're coming
They're coming here to stay
They're coming
They're taking me away...
I beg for a helping hand
I'm reaching I am searching
But no...
And i pray for an ear that listens
My hope's washed away
I'm here alone
solo danhage
I hear them
They're coming
Quickly through the hallway
The door opens
Helpless again
The will I had ain't strong enough
The strength i seek ain't there
My world is dead
My future's broken
Cause it all stays the same
They're coming
They're coming here to stay
They're coming
They're taking me away...
They're coming
Only to leave me in shame
Simply leave me... <start> If you're havin' trouble with your high school head

Pick up the phone

To rake Saints 'shins bestrewn

So can you hoard host like Zion's coin
Belie progeny ov your pain
IHWH thou sayeth unto me
Thou disrupter imbalance my creations
Hence I transfix in bliss ov flagellation
I burnt in rapture wafted ash about...
Became the law above all laws

Of all that is and will be changed
We are all not ignorant and blind
We will never be rid of this
Forcefed your lies
You sow the seeds of their deceit
Forcefed your lies
They'll never have their fill
Until long after you're dead
You're just another number
To be checked and then balanced
A tax to extract
When you're tired from running their race and realize
The money's not worth the paper it's on
Think for yourself and you can never be bought
Then you will have the strength to weather
The oncoming storm
The oncoming storm is not what it seems
It's filled to the brim with ravenous creatures
Driven to rape and deceive <start> Gave all my trust to you.
You shattered it with my hope.
It seems as if your selfishness has brought you down again.
You'll find what I found hard to take in all at once.
Trust me.
You thought you had me fooled but you wouldn't last a day in my shoes.
Everything I gave to you I got nothing in return
No a knife in my back. this knife is my own reliance
I will never be forgotten.
I will never forget you.
This revolving apathy fueling worthlessness.
I sing a song of hope.
With dead tongues and lonely hearts we cough the poison out.
Your final days approach.
This will be our final confrontation.
This will be our last <start>  We live in a dead world. Dead because you killed it. Not with wars famine
or disease  for if anything these are balms to the Earth. Instead you left
your signature of death by overpopulating this world with a teeming mass of
mindless sexless raceless slaves. You abandoned the highest goal you could
have aspired to  evolution  and put in its place a factory for the stupid
the ignorant the despicable. And yet you claim we head towards a glorious
future. It may be full of glory but this will not be the kind which
bestowsblessings on the meek for they shall inherit only the iron heel. The
race wars hate wars and holy wars of the coming millennium will make the
holocausts of the past look like a walk in the park. Hopefully you'll be ther
to fulfill your role as victim as despite the delusions you pay lip service
to that is what you are at the core. You can take your liberty equality and
brotherhood and flush them down the drain of this socalled civilization.
Your progress is a lie and your society an eyesore. You are slaves in chains
in the galley of the ship named humanity. Call yourselves united call
yourselves brothers...
but when the ship sinks you'll crush your most beloved to death in order to
save your own dysgenitic hide.  But ther is one noble path a proper finish
for your miserable existence. Admit your failure wallow in the despair. Let
it iluminate the only way to give your life meaning. Pick up the revolver and
slide the barrel between your lips. Enjoy the sharp metallic taste. Warm the
cold steel with your tongue. Press the end into the roof of your mouth and
hold it there. Now let me do the rest ... alas if only you all had one
collective mouth and my finger was on that trigger.
 I won't hesitate for a second although you probably deserve a much slower
form of extermination. This will hurt someone and hopefully this is only the
beginning... <start> One man in his darkness lying in his tomb
waiting for the silence to greet his final moon
Shadows start to gather embracing his release
a journey to the darkside a forever rest in peace
There will be light if you believe
just let your memories flow free
Show me light where only shadows breed
embrace my soul and set me free
Honoured in remembrance locked in precious mind
mourned among the living  a hurt that never dies
Kept alive through heartbeats and within bloodline
failed to be forgiven erased by human kind <start> All that's now been broken
On streets I dare not walk
Freedom is an illusion
I build my fences high
If there was something out there
I have learned not to expect
There's a hundred million reasons
Not to care
Don't bring it don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me
Don't bring it don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me
Wear Misery's Crown
As always in this matters
You broke the deal of deals
And wasted what was given
To revel in your mess
I gave up all for nothing
I tried my best and failed
There's a thousand million reasons
Never to share again
This is how it all begins
This is how it all begins
Don't bring it don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me
Don't bring it don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me
Wear Misery's Crown
This is how it all begins
Go now x
Don't bring it don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me

don't bring your misery down on me

Everything about you makes me sick.
Your self satisfying ridicule makes me sick.
Condescending contradictive.
I wait for you to burn.
Choke on your tongue of lies.
You burn.
Worthless.
You're worthless as you burn.
How does it feel
For so long you've torn away.
How does it feel back in your face <start> You watch the setting sun
The fear hast just begun
All living things now fall asleep
You keep a burning light
Try to ignore the night
But you know that it's out there
You try to be prepared
You don't like to be scared
But you know there's no escape
Fear the night
Don't wanna fall asleep
Don't close your eyes again
You'll lose your mind
If you never sleep
You can't stay awake forever
Forever
Pure evil shows its face
In darkness cold embrace
Staring into emptiness
The demons in your head
Crawls underneath your bed
You know you have to stay awake
Fear the night
Don't wanna fall asleep
Don't close your eyes again
You'll lose your mind
If you never sleep
You can't stay awake forever
Another night has now passed by
You stayed awake and you survived
The day breaks through
But you know it will come back
The night you fear breathes down your neck
Don't fall asleep
Fear the night
Don't wanna fall asleep
Don't close your eyes again
You'll lose your mind
If you never sleep
You can't stay awake forever
Fear the night
Don't wanna fall asleep
Don't close your eyes again
You'll lose your mind
If you never sleep
You can't stay awake forever <start> Music Thijs Lyrics Sven
A quick grasp of insanity cranial tissue in decay
A force fed tool of apathy i am
Parasitic life form infesting my whole being
Necrotic fungus resecting organs to create...
From the realm of the dead I'm fed
Cracking open the coffin lid
Driven by a hunger unable to grasp
A chemical reaction that campels me to grab
The axe anxiously removed from its shelve
With an unpredescent joy I brutally hack
Psychonecrotic hallucinations
as my skull begins to reek
With goreastic elegance I purge the weak
Parasitic life form
Rehashing the dead for its cause
The chopping of heads
A daily act of selfenjoyment
Cranial metamorphosis
A forensic decrepit anomaly
Intestines turn into pulp
Axe wielding among the stiffs
Parasitic resection... <start> The clouds are colored orange
By streetlamps and hope
Swirling upwards to the
Silent  cloudy  dreamy sky
'cause when I die
I reach out to the stars
and when I cry
while looking at my past
my mother sighs
she buries me so deep
deep in my heart
so let me stay and sleep
I'm reaching out for hope
Not for love  'cause there's no more
My parents are standing by my grave
Finally a place where I fell save <start> Disown
Disgust
With 
We slave
Disown
With 
Disgust
We slave
Dead eyes 
See when
Stay down
You're hurt
Dead eyes 
See when
You're hurt
Stay down
Our souls x

No sight
We pledge 
No sight
No soul X <start> Why did I do such a thing
to myself my family and friends
I distracted them with lies
I thought they were blind
but yet they saw
What was I doing to me
I was so blind
Ain't got the time
Ain't got the time
to straighten up myself
I fooled everyone
with my tearfilled eyes
but not only with lies
Also with my cries
I figured I was better
but really I don't know
Cause nothing exists
In my head
those voices screaming
wake me up
I must be dreaming
In my head those voices
screaming
dreaming
No one can ever drag me
back to shoot
I've got my own free choice
Working with learning
other people to know
how to handle it
And accepting all the lies
Fiction reality makes 'em cry
I got my own free choices
Ain't got the time
Ain't got the time
To straighten up myself
Fall down again
Falling again to the
Flipside of reality <start> In solitude looking into the flame that burns
Alongside with your memory
Desolation a picture of my fallen star
A broken branch in my family tree
In my family tree
I raise my head now defying this obvious truth
That night came and our Heaven turned to Hell
That night came and our Heaven turned to Hell
Our Heaven turned to Hell
Drowning hope remembering all the pain
Fear of loosing memories in the daily haze
It was the time we should fill with laughter
Of our newly arriving joy
The siren grabs you with tragic hunger
Flashing blue cutting through the view
A message of death that no one could foresee
Inside this hall waiting for the fall
Waiting for the fall
My fallen
May not live to roam this earth
My fallen
Changed my life forever
My fallen
Left a mark inside so sore
My fallen
Only solitude within my core
The siren grabs you with tragic hunger
Flashing blue cutting through the view
A message of death that no one could foresee
Inside this hall waiting for the fall
How many dreams I have chased on my road
I don't feel for anything anymore
All just fragments of disposable waste
A cesspool of terror displaying hate
I have to face the day
Still denying this obvious truth
That night came and our Heaven turned to Hell
Our Heaven turned to Hell to Hell
My fallen
May not live to roam this earth
My fallen
Changed my life forever
My fallen
Left a mark inside so sore
My fallen
Only solitude within my core
The siren grabs you with tragic hunger
Flashing blue cutting through the view
A message of death that no one could foresee
Inside this hall waiting for the fall
The fall
Our Heaven turned to Hell <start> I walk again through these darkened paths
as the cold wind blows on my face
and the fog creates sinister forms
they guide me in the dark night
A night as black as Death
An iced hand closes my eyes
as the frost surrounds me with its obscure shroud
NIGHTFROST
No moon over me this night
only the dark is real now
I stand obsessed by the signs
occult symbols carved in the ground
of this ancient moor
They show me the mysteries of the afterlife
the way to the knowledge
Now i must die to see this...
Wandering in the lands of Death
I know i' ve seen beyond
Untrodden paths but only in this life
i walked them
NIGHTFROST <start> Synthetic residue touched upon
Scars and wounds frown upon
While other wounds are closing
Stars and losers reassemble
Within thy own abyss
Sought through internal pyre and wind
Not ready to remember where to begin
For another day is yet to come
Before the night takes us home
What will remain
What will leave trace
While traveling through
Time and space
What will remain
What will leave trace
Arcane perfection
Arcane illumination
Sought through internal pyre and wind
Not ready to remember where to begin
For another day is yet to come
Before the night takes us home
Arcane perfection
Sweeps away darkness of the old ways
Arcane illumination
Welcomes the birth of another
Haunting visions dawn upon me
While time is standing still
Lost far beyond the imaginary
Out of reach for the soul <start> I should've seen this
From a mile away
I should've never let you get that deep inside
You're an actress
I can't believe a word
You'd say anything to get anywhere in life
Stumble back to where you came from
Wide awake and falling on your faith
You've got an evil wicked way
Of saying I love you I'd love to
Tear away from everything you are
You've got an evil wicked way about you I hate you
Like a virus
That spread throughout my veins
You're incurable and such a waste of time
You're an angel
But only in your head
You'd hurt anyone
To get anything in life
Slither back to where you came from
Wide awake and falling on your faith
You've got an evil wicked way
Of saying I love you I'd love to
Tear away from everything you are
You've got an evil wicked way about you I hate you
Who do you think you are
Who do you think you are
Who do you think you are
Who do you think you are 
Who do you think you are 
Who do you think you are 
Wide awake and falling on your faith
You've got an evil wicked way
Of saying I love you I'd love to
Tear away from everything you are
You've got an evil wicked way about you I hate you
Who do you think you are
Who do you think you are
Who do you think you are
Who do you think you are <start> Chaos infinite majesty of execration
Squatting proud upon the throne of abomination
Death profane burns bright supreme
Consuming foetid flesh of the nazarene
Rites of scourge immolated flesh
Imbibe the sorrow storm of impiety
A serpent entwined in the horns of the goat
Of withered angels wretched debris
Smoldering...
Tyrant of solitude and desolate beauty
The scaled and blooded claws of the mighty
A king for kings to victory betrothed
Vestige of mercy with filth befouled
Winged shadow simulacrum
Tenebrous dirge ensanguined drums of war
Iron blood and blasphemy affirmation
With grinning sepulchre as altar
He who leaps the loftiest of mountains
Pride and proscription now abhorred
Smoldering in exile eternal
Azazael awful lord
The flesh of Besz venom of Apophrasz
The Dragon steed of the Scarlet Fornicatrix
Behold magnificence Mega Therion
Six hundred and sixty six
An iron helm on horned brow crowning
A warlord wreathed bold with lightning
Obsidian splendor of starless purity
The bringer enflamed of dawns and destiny
Of strength cloven stature and wisdom unknown
The wellspring from which all blasphemies flow
The sadistic triumph for which I yearn
The mighty inferno in which I burn...
Smoldering in exile <start> After the caskets put into the ground
Loved ones crying walk away
Corpse unknowingly left behind
Other needs for sick human prey
Casket closed as mourners read
Pages from their holy book
Waiting in a meat locker
Morticians meal hangs from a hook
Storing dead carcasses to dine upon
Chewing on rotten arms and legs
Brutal desecration of the dead
Hacking bodies until he's fed
Service for a vacant coffin
Corpse is being digested
Chronic hunger for cold flesh
Remains of the dead are molested <start> Bonus Track
I thought I stood on solid ground
I was floating near the stars
Never once did I look down
I was Falling Down how far...
To a place where I can't even say my name
I am the alien the drifter I'm to blame
The day I fell to earth
I fell to earth thought I was dead
I was bruised and I was scarred
Took the time to look around
Started climbing and how far
To a place where I am shouting out my name
I am the alien the drifter I'm to blame
The Day I fel to earth
The Day I fel to earth <start> Elftes Kapitel
Der Werkelmann kauert einsam vor dem Totenschrein des Mdchens . Er schiebt den Deckel von der Totenlade und blickt gebannt auf den starren Kindsleib der in ein feines Leinentuch gewickelt ist und dem Antlitz einer kindlichen Dirne entspricht. Der Kopf des Kindes wurde behutsam balsamiert die weich gezeichneten Lippen mit rotem Lippenstift beschmiert. Wie ein eben verstorbenes Mdchen blickt dieses zarte Geschpf aus der fauligen Gruft die kugeligen Augen weit geffnet. Es ist das schnste Geschpf das Kezman auf seinem Totenacker beherbergt. Vllig irr und bezaubert von der grazilen Statur der Leiche beginnt der Werkelmann die Tote zu kssen. Als der Gestank des toten Fleischs eine Dohle anlockt verliert er die Fassung.
DER WERKELMANN 
Dein Haar ist so schn
Dein Mund ist so schn
Dein Leib ist so schn
Dein Leib ist schn
Klavier setzt ein.

Mein Kind so schn
dein Mund ist hbsch und glnzt so wunderbar.
Ich bin so wild nach deinem harzig Haar
ich bin so wild nach deinem Lippenpaar.
Es ksst dich der Teufel.
Er streichelt dich barsch.
Er whlt dir im Haar...
und leckt deine Backen.

Hei ist nur dein Erdbeermund.

I am a ghost but if only you remember
To say your prayers of promises for something better.
My hands are tied
Stuck in this room forever
I scream but only echos care to answer
We raise our world to find our hope
We made a world we lost our way back home
But we fight through the storm
Or stay forever warm
The prisoners of war
Am I the prisoner
I sold my soul
And traded my wings for glory
When i close my eyes i hear the angels sing to me

We raise our world to find our hope
We made a world we lost our way back home
But we fight through the storm
Or stay forever warm
The prisoners of war
Am i the prisoner
We live to exist
But are we alive
We can't run away
How will we survive
I'm losing my brain
I can't wait to die
There's no more words for what I've done
I find myself behind the sun
There's no more words for what I've done
I find myself behind the sun
We have to die
To feel like were alive
we made a world
We lost our way back home
We made a world
We lost our way back home
Will we fight
Through the storm
Or stay forever warm
The prisoners of war
Am I the prisoner
I am a ghost but only a few remember
I am a ghost but only a few remember
Will you remember me <start> There's nothing left here
You left me with no room to grow
So where do I go where do I go
Take me with you to the other side
Because there's nothing left here
It's so hard to find a little peace of mind
Just take a breath and watch me go
Hear me I'm screaming at the lights before the end comes near
Just lift me from the ground and take me with you
It's sinking in my skin
And crawling through my veins
Oh God they're in my head
Just take them out
It's so hard to find a little peace of mind
Just take a breath and watch me go
Oh god save me from my sin <start> Burn
You're dead you sick old perv
I'll shove a scalding orange knife in your eye
Next thing you you know you'll be on the floor with your brains out your nose
That's not enough blood for me
In minutes I'll make that what you pee
Cut your balls off shove them in your mouth
Think that's bad wait 'til I cut your dick off
Saw off your arms grind them into beef
Mmmm tasty dog meat
Cut you a fuck crack with a long burning screw
Remind you of what you used to do
You're not dead yet and hell I'm glad
It's time to pour gas on your head
Light you up and leave you for dead
Go to hell motherfucker
Go get raped by the devil himself <start> When the off license asks
I've been  months
Checks the crack
On their forehead
Should comb a hair
Over that
And these Czech shoes
Are a bloody reminder
And this town
Is not much different
The clothes the stooped appearance
Over the hill
goes killer civil servant
I still remember
The white leafy border
The scheiss in winter
Over the hill
goes killer civil servant
There's a song she had before
Borough town
That had the snappy rejoinder
Who's there
What's wrong
Clear off <start> Nothing that come between the face  I control my breath
But my heart reveals a maze me  go back to the begininng
I try to look ahead  but beacuse im trained to caught oxygen trough my nostrils
Feel my heart like begin
Sinful wore the veterans wore alter my mouth
Its just a thought blackning
As sticking worm to steal the mere precence from me
And to steal my turn of path
Throwing powerful comes my wrath
 X
Never see me such weakened
Says reality
On my will to trash the end
Beauty quiche to the end
She will take my body
Care for me and my food
So as precise
Precise is fast
Step by step I enter the void
Smile to the silence around me
Trough my nostrils I contain my rhyme
For mere own taste
different shape and dimmension  distorted visions
and real perception
Someone wants me to fly
Impossible alternative I finish my path
Tender and the past Acompany my victory
Why I burden
They suck the air delicatly from me
This smile  this scent  do you fill to your lungs
They steal my oxygen
Only in the void I can rest
Step by step I enter the void
Smile to the silence around me
Trough my nostrils I contain my rhyme
For mere own taste
Different shape and dimmension
Distorted visions and reup perceptions
Someone wants me to fly <start> The birth of the Apostles was in order for assassination
To befall on the archangel of light.
His end had to be made so that not man's sins were forgiven
But the whole miscreation of false religion would be forgotten.
I need not servants to worship me for you are all but tools
In this vicious plot of mine.
These few were made for a different purpose.
A special plan to bring about the destruction of the church
And the annihilation of Christ.
I presented a group of twelve men to him as confidants
Supposed followers of his teachings and helpers of his word.
They would later go on to be the primary conspirators
In the conspiracy to kill Jesus
And make remnants and memory forgotten forever.
By infiltrating the covenant
And bleeding faith from the whole congregation
They turned his own students against him
And now the fate of this world is again in my control.
These few were made for a different purpose.
A special plan to bring about the destruction of the church
And the annihilation of Christ.
I have no son and no mortal being shall ever be worshipped
By the theft of my name.
I have seized back control of my creation
And you all now know the truth of I your maker
And your once leader
And the horror I will bring down upon all of mankind.

The birth of the Apostles was in order for assassination
To befall on the archangel of light. <start> Where will I return my misgiven motions
Quell and subside the quivering vigour
The inevitable thrust
That swells inside
And drives me off the edge
The bleeding ill that breeds me on mercy
Ruthless and sinister
Obsessive beyond my reach
Metamorphosis
Release me from fury
Metamorphosis
Transforming energy
Will I tread on broken glass
And undisguised
Set atrocities aside
Scrape the surface
Clean from abominations
With a single word
Conquer wrath
Disposed to the evils that haunt me in sleep
They shake the break of dawn
Careless and free
And spear me down
Relentlessly
Smitten with burns
They pierce my mind
They all own their own place in darkness
Light as they may seem as day <start> Suffer me.This is the last time i hold myself from anger.There is no such thing as a  true love.I'm constantly looking towards something betterit makes no sense for me to look above.Baby rosemarywhat have you brought today for methis life has nothing for me tell me if your up to trade.I'll take anything you offer today I'm feeling brave.Oh tell me are you willingI want the finer things.I'll take this gift your giving and take all the hell it brings.I wanna be the star in the middle of your everything.I'm the one who owns you I want to be your king.Dark night dark sky...I'm ready for your offerserve it to me silver plate.This is the feast of agestonight we dine on perfect hate.Oh tell me are you willing.I want the finer things.I'll take this gift your giving and all the hell it brings.I wanna be the star in the middle of your everything.Be the one who controls you I want to be you king.I want you to suffer.I'm just still looking for a trade.The deal I have is not working he never even hears me speak and with this new lack of concern new management i seek.Oh tell me are you willing I want the finer things.I'll take this gift your giving and all the hell it brings.I wanna be the star in the middle of your everything.Be the one who controls you I want to be you king.Suffer unto meI want you to suffer unto mecause I'll be the new designer.I gave you everything you gave away.I gave you everythingthing to say.Suffer unto me. <start> I am the lightbringer...
I am the vizionaire of time...
Im watching the stormy clouds above the nightly sea
So far so distant in my sight
Still so comfort refl ections for my mind
It was calm before the storm
When the hate in me was born
It was calm before the storm
As the world is completely torn
After the rain was end i realized its not my time
To keep this gift i hold let the storm take us all <start> It's not a dream and it's not your imagination.
I'm lying in my bedroom restless at nights
And feeling someone's lying next to my side
I hear a heavy breathing  someone's next to me
And watching me
Sweet dreams now come to me
Your flesh is weak
I sense and know it's presence yet I'm asleep
Someone is preying upon my sleeping mind
Whispering
Calling desiring
And squeezing with all its might
It's trying to take over and choke me
A nightmare seizes in a freezing grip
I feel cold fingers running taking a grip
This spirit lurking in my sleep
And giving in I'll sleep forever more
Sweet dreams now come to me
Your flesh is weak
I sense and know it's presence yet I'm asleep
Someone is preying upon my sleeping mind
Whispering
Calling desiring
And squeezing with all its might
It's trying to take over and choke me
The flesh is weak
Walk in the spirit
And ye shall not fulfill
The lust of the flesh
I sense and know it's presence yet I'm asleep
Someone is preying upon my sleeping mind
Whispering
Calling desiring
And squeezing with all its might
It's trying to take over and choke me <start> A shattered soul born
From a loss of faith
Your empty mind filled
With the wrath of god
Now your broken heart
Will never heal your scars
But you'll be saved
From religious starvation
As I become your guiding star
The twisted rule the wicked
A beginning with no end
The calm becomes the restless
As I am your
Self appointed god
Same order new messiah
Define my name
Your my puppet my blind disciple
On your knees you'll pay
Obey the faith of the bleeding heart
And you'll find your way
to salvation through pain and fire
As I am your self appointed god
The twisted rule the wicked
A beginning with no end
The calm becomes the restless
As I am your
Self appointed god
Same order new messiah
Define my name
Your my puppet my blind disciple
On your knees you'll pay
Obey the faith of the bleeding heart
The twisted rule the wicked
A beginning with no end
The calm becomes the restless
As I am your
Self appointed god <start> Oh boys cheeky girls

Cheeky cheeky <start> I wanted it all but couldn't get it all under control
Didn't realize how much I could lose this way
I'm cleansing my soul in the light trying to get innocent
Will you lead me straight or will I lose my faith
Faith without faith I will fail without faith
Carved out of flesh this is who you made
I have come to find I was never on my own
I'm trying too hard to claim originality
Still I'm no one new I'm just like you
I always wanted it to be something different
I never wanted to be something other than me
Now it's come to this and I've not proved wiser than before
Neverending struggles wear different faces
The higher I climb the harder I fall
And I've never found a way to break down softly
But the stars explode and help me reach the other side
That takes me from what I've become <start> Through tainted mass
A scourge unseen
Brought three winters forth
And set between
After these hundreds of years
The embers and fate will collide
Her rotten heart has burst
And shattered through dead wood
When they drank from the earth the end was near
Tracing paths that once ran alone and pure
Suffused within the blighted decay
Now snapped into dust their splinters fall
But a tithe to the wind his frail grasps
Clawed for the moon then came undone
When all hope fails in the last broken bough
Her strength will be gone
Churning ash and husks in the bitter winds
Crack the earth and burn the sky
A wry procession of hubris
Where nothing remains
But everything changes...
In destruction she will create
Arising in glory the searing gaze
Crimsonhanded specter of death
Under the blood eye of furies
Bury their feeble hearts <start> When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
Till I get to the bottom and I see you again.
Do don't you want me to love you
I'm coming down fast but I'm miles above you
Tell me tell me tell me come on tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer.
Helter skelter helter skelter
Helter skelter.
Will you won't you want me to make you
I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you
Tell me tell me tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer.
Look out
Helter skelter helter skelter
Helter skelter.
Look out 'cause here she comes.
When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
Till I get to the bottom and I see you again.
Well do you don't you want me to love you
I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you
Tell me tell me tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer.
Look out
Helter skelter helter skelter
Helter skelter.
Look out helter skelter
She's coming down fast.
Yes she is.
Yes she is
 <start> So is this it
Does time end here
Is this what I fought for
And what I've gained
What a fool I've been
To think life had more to offer
Instead I lye here
In remorse and suffer
And I hate you for doing this
And I hate you for saying that
I never did enough to ever please you
Never did enough for it to cease to
Affect me the way it does
Provoke me the way it must
And I'm still thinking
I'm not enough
My war on time
Got worse and faster
The sands fought hard
And every day I lost a battle
And even though I knew I lied
And even though I saw the signs
The same three words each time
I am fine
And I hate you for doing this
And I hate you for saying that
I never did enough to ever please you
Never did enough for it to cease to
Provoke me the way it must
And I'm still thinking
I am not enough
I'm ashamed of the life I've lived
I'm afraid of what I have been
And it just became
Just became enough... <start> I prepare for war inside my head
I close my eyes and reach the point
Where everything is meaningless
You strike on my nerves
You have dragged me down
But now I'll do the same what you've been doing to me
Before you can say a word
I'm gonna get you break you and throw you away
pre
Can't you see your oncoming suffering
Why can't you see the revelation
The pressure of blood is singing in my ears
When I heard that you've been spreading lies around me
I strike with fear A cry of war
And I pull the strings that you hold before
I will pretend the shock wave of your life
pre
Can't you see your oncoming suffering
Why can't you see the revelation
chorus
Today you see the end of the line
'cause now my hatred is open wide
Then you will know who I am in this game
The Angel of Revenge
You're about to see what is like to be haunted and nailed down
My lust for war will lead us to this bitter state
Where pain is so real and paralyzing
The price we have to pay
But like a phoenix I rise
To tear your soul apart <start> I can see it in your eyes
Even though you tried to hide
You ain't getting all you need
Girl you need security
You don't hear a word I'm saying
Cause you feel you understand him
Tell me if I'm out of line
But I think I got things right
CHORUS
You need a man like me 
You need a man like me 
You need a man like me 
You need a man like me 
You don't need to suffer in silence
You don't have to grieve in vain
But still you carry on
Even though you're feeling pain
I know he needs you're love
I know he needs you to care
But love is a two way thing
And girl you don't need him
CHORUS <start> There must be some kind of way out of here
Said the joker to the thief yeah
There's too much confusion
Mmm I can't get no relief
Business men they drink my wine
Plowman dig my earth
None were level on the mind
No one up at his word
Yeah I see jokers on my left thieves upon my right
You'd find me in the middle if I picked a different life
Before my name started tripling in size
But I'm still showing signs all attributed to mine
In the pitch black it's too cold
I'm all alone take me back to the roads I had to roam to get here and I'll hitch back
Get a cab to my mother's house see my old man and grab a six pack
Tell my brother I love him
And give him something that will see him through the hard times
What's a brother for
When I'm sick of this life I see
It has to be my family who lift me off the floor
Make sense of all the madness in a world full of money
Full of tears full of war
I was a plowman and worked from the earth up
Save your wine for the entrepreneurs
Well all along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl 
Two riders were approaching
And the wind begins to howl 
Pour more blood in your cup
Take a sip full of sin and let your taste buds savoir the buzz
The flavor of an illmannered nature
That lingers on as animals in all of us
Trying to fight for the right to live a life
But some will never win though that's why they live a lie
I don't think I'll ever win all of this is anything
When I die I hope a brother's at my side
There's no trap door or get out clause
The world can be your oyster or a set of jail doors
You've seen mine I think it's time I see yours
I bet you that we've been scarred by the same swords
So we are not so unalike
Apart from the fact I live my life in the light and now I'm trapped in it
The way I feel within a few years time
I might have a couple kids and just forget I ever wrote lyrics
Well all along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too yeah
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind begins to howl
Take away the treasure of a man
Convinced that he holds heaven in his hands
Even though I ain't religious I'm a little superstitious
Maybe there is a promised land
But will I make it or not is a different matter
I've been a joker I've been a thief I've been a rapper
I've been the only enemy that I can never beat
Give me a piece of mind upon a platinum platter
Well all along the watchtower
Princes kept the view oh oh oh
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too yeah
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind begins to howl <start> Instrumental <start> instrumental <start> How many MC's must get dissed
Yo motherfucker let me speak on this
I be that lyricist pugilist with an educated fist
Evolutionist forced to exist on a black list
Pissed and dismissed I resist to play the backseat
No boy from backstreet I'm intellectually elite
My mind moves faster that Michael Johnson at a track meet
Stepping over those under me like concrete
Smaller than gnomes shatter your thoughts like Britte Bones
Crushing feeble domes like El Nino did to mobile homes
Lamp posts get ripped apart when I envade with my tirade
Like cat in the hat during the Macy's Day parade
Worthy or an accolade instead portrayed as a charade
Conveyed as an Al Jolson with a mammy serenade
Guilty of being white and out of step like minor threat
But I'm a major threat not willing to forgive and forget
Judge me on skills not my color or race
Judge me on skills not my color or race
Judge me on skills not my color or race
Judge me on skills
Say that shit to my face say that shit to my face
Say that shit to my face say that shit to my face
Say that shit to my face bitch
Grimm my pseudonym I'm an MC not a singer
Put more dents in the game than the face of Wayne Hyzienga
Scarlet lettered fettered as a wigger just a wannabe
Beset with every epithet can't get the best of me
People used to giggle and laugh not clear a path
I'm over coming obstacles like Jeremy McGrath
Those who used to raise an eyebrow kowtow
Had no respect for you then got no respect for you know
My spectacular vernacular suspends disbelief
You went from Verbose to Coatose silent as the chief
Our time is brief I hope no one forgets me
Goals to achieve before I leave like Gretzky
But I'll never retire until I see this thing through
To imbue my point of you challenging you like K 
My forte to foray with the words I say
So clear the way motherfucker 'cause I'm here to stay
Judge me on skills not my color or race
Judge me on skills not my color or race
Judge me on skills not my color or race
Judge me on skills
Say that shit to my face say that shit to my face
Say that shit to my face say that shit to my face
Say that shit to my face
Judge me on skills not my color or race
Judge me on skills not my color or race
Judge me on skills not my color or race
Judge me on skills
Say that shit to my face say that shit to my face
Say that shit to my face say that shit to my face
Say that shit to my face face face face <start> Excuse me can you help me straighten up my head
I got a new friend by the name of Mr Z.
Well what's wrong with that don't ya like what you see
Hmm... If I had a choice yo I'd rather be me
You see he's kinda not like kinda average kinda guy
Kinda say what make you kinda say why
Did you see that what he did to his cat
It's all big and fat and now it wears caps.
Here we go agian.
Mr Zuvaloppa got a crazy life
With a house on the corner for his kids and whife.
Works all day tryin' to make ends meet
Just the same as everybody does down his street.
Mr Zuvaloppa got a brand new car
But he likes a little drink so he can't drive far.
He used to have a mini but he's six foot four.
Mr Zuvaloppa don't want it anymore.
Yo you gotta sit back relax while
I hit you with a tale of a guy
Who would try but he's always gonna fail
M I S T E are Z he doesn't realise
That it wasn't really meant to be
Him up at the top he never want to stop
The fool up in the pool doin' a big
Belly flop
Now even sunbathing he could never get
It right
Cause he even tried to do it in the middle
Of the night. <start> Searching Wandering
Looking for the perfect specimen
Still pure immature
Acknowledged sickness concealed swaggering
Unseen stalking
Ascertain the prey
Creeping quietly
Gracious second skin
Courteous facade accepted
The cultured do not harm
Fitting in amongst the sheeple
Purpose clear
Sheltered secret
Unsoiled inceptive
Infantile delight
The itch that needs attention
Clandestine recreation
Craving obscured outside
Covering unbridled pretense
Breaks from the masquerade
Unrestrained fleeting moments reminiscence
To comprehend the need ectasy
Schizophrenic lies seeking explanation
No excuse
Unchecked no reasoning
Devoid of disease
Disguised expertise
Living in the shroud of ordinary
Waiting to unleash the polished skill set
Plethors of just rewards
Life through the power of the conquered
Repulsed by the dormant time
Disgusted by outlook of offspring should not breed
Arrogance in no one looking
Not suspected in any wrongs
Knowing steps of specialized inquiry
Superiority on display
Flaunting prowess prodding counterparts
Provocatioin stands unanswered
Divergence of standard procedure
Bestowment of allusion granted
Come on false rival
No excuse unchecked no reasoning
Devoid of disease disguised expertise
Living in the shroud of ordinary
Waiting to unleash the polished skill set <start> Vessel
I'm a vessel in the valley getting riddled with the tally
I'm the middle of a season getting riddled with the reasons
Stop
Wait
Unhand me

I'm the widow of a conscience getting riddled with the nonsense
Stop
Wait
Unhand me <start> Can you last long
I won't wither
All that pressure
pass through like caffeine
Bye
So long so long
You've been so right
Canker loves to make
things heavy for a while
Take all I've got
All flesh and bone it's yours
I thrash and flail
I'll fight you but I need you <start> I am the way you wanna be too
I'm a danger to myself
You are the sacrifice I'll make
When I crawl up in between you
You and I you and I both know
The inner voice that freez you
You and I you and I both know
The lucid way lucid way I tease
But I won't parade my patince
If you think me pretty vacant
I am the cloud surrounding your crowd
I'm a danger to myself
You are the heat that brings home the rain
But it's harder to complete you
You and I you and I both know
The inner voice that freez you
You and I you and I both know
The lucid way lucid way I tease
I Don't Care
But I won't parade my patince
I Don't Care
If you think me pretty vacant
I Don't Care
But I won't parade my patince
I Don't Care
If you think me pretty vacant
If you wanna turn your back on me
Find a way to seize the day
Go ahead and make things fair
But you know what I don't give a fuck
I Don't Care
But I won't parade my patince
I Don't Care
If you think me pretty vacant
I Don't Care

Megalopolis builds barriers you die under their stress
The mob creates its atmosphere
Bitches drugs guns for sale.
I'm a stranger in the city in its rotten part
I will destroy the barriers and If I win
I'll get lucky
The mob watchfully guards the wall
It's very hard to get through
Volunteers in the army's rows essence of slums and stench
Dead body of a city  alienation and water the beginning of a job
Killers from dirty streets victims of the city's creation
Fifty bucks for one head they are not afraid of this task
To approach them is a risk conscience is taboo
To escape them has no sense losers in the system abound
Metropolis creates the gang and the gang defines the city
Parasites love this corpse killers in the army's rows
How many people did you kill
About two hundred and fifty
How many murders did you see
About two or three thousand
Tell me man did you use choppers
Yeah we used choppers to torment
And I wait for the darkness to set myself free... <start> Dark bodies floating in darkness
No sign of light ever given
Imprisoned in a world without a memory
Unconscious or am I conscious
Cut from the heart I am part of
Sometimes it feels as though I'm frozen in heaven
And I saw my own face in the black lonely space
Like a spark frozen grey
Floating away
Floating away
In dreams I see myself flying
Closer to the sun and I'm climbing
Tried to touch the sun
But the brightness burned my eyes
Unconscious or am I conscious
Fell from the sky like a star
Sometimes it feels as though I'm frozen in heaven
And I saw my own face in the black lonely space
Like a spark frozen grey
Floating away
And I saw my own face in the black lonely space
Like a spark
My mind was so dark
My life was so dark
My mind was so dark
My life was so dark
Everything was dark
Unconscious or am I conscious
Fell from the sky like a star
Sometimes I feel as though I'm frozen in heaven
And I saw my own face in the black lonely space
Like a spark frozen grey
Floating away
Floating away
And I saw my own face like a spark floating away <start> I I missed the meeting
Where you were appointed god
Preaching all your misguided views
Only you decide what is true
Chorus
You just want me to die
Then you'll be satisfied
It's a disappointing day for you
Because I am alive alive
Me I'm only human
So you think you can step on me
Feeding on all of those around
From your nothing throne
You're ruling nothing now
Chorus
If you knew anything about real life
Then you would realize
You don't know anything about real life
To me that's no surprise
I I missed the meeting
Where you were appointed god
Preaching all your misguided views
Only you decide what is true
You just want me to die
Then you'll be satisfied
It's a disappointing day for you
You know I'm still alive alive
You know I'm still alive alive <start> Abased by my grief
the troubled mind I bear
drags me down the abyss of
endless loneliness.
Enlight the reek in which you dwell.
You re the weak your soul has fell.
Hear the prayer of a lost soul.
Even though the greatest of my wishes
is being stoic God has made me
one of many stooges.
Trusting only thou
who is alike myself.
I merge with the darkness
that embraces me for who I am.
Emaciated by their faulter moves
they hide under the cloak of blasphemy.
Desperately yearning for love
finding only misery Avount
Now I loath the presence of God
whom I had such trust in.
Only to be abandoned
my hardest of times.
Pierce the mind see what is not.
Try to sense the spirit rot. <start> S. Laird  K. Bachman  J. Daub  J. Winters
INTRO THE BIRTH
MOVEMENT I THE LIE
The fruit from the tree was so pleasing to my eye
The serpent said that I would not die
The serpent shall be cursed he will crawl about and eat dust
I will put enmity between the woman and you
Man will crush your head you will strike his heel
The wisdom of the world will be mine if I eat
What can it hurt if I take it and eat
I will greatly increase the woman's pain
When bearing children all of your days
You will desire man he will rule over you
Take some man gain wisdom too
Eat from the tree it's what you must do
The land will be cursed because of man
Producing thorns to make him bleed
By your sweat you will live until death
Dust you are and to dust you will return
Genesis 
MOVEMENT II THE TRUTH

If you're the son of God
Tell these stones to become bread
Man does not live on bread
But by words from the mouth of God
If you're the son of God
Throw yourself to the ground God will save you
But is written
Do not put your God to the test
All the world I give you
If you bow and worship me
Leave me now and worship
The Lord your God serve Him only
When Satan left him there
The angels came to him
Temptation lost
Matthew 
MOVEMENT III THE KEY
Evil scheming wicked violence
And such is the end of all with ill gotten gain
Hatred rejection mocking others
This takes the lives of those with ill gotten gain
Do not walk on paths of the wicked
They are the darkness and they don't understand
The path of the righteous first dawns gleaming
Shining brighter 'till the full light of day
Do not offer body to sin
Offer yourselves to God as those brought to life
Therefore put on the armor of God
So when that day of evil comes you can stand your ground
Pr.   Ro.  Ep.  <start> Wake up to face another day of
Madness the modern world at play.
Corruption from white and blue alike
Serenity is jeopardised.
Envoys are delt their hands.
Barter with their deadly plans for
Power they deal and trade
Compare the guns they made  big gun.
Secrets held from humanity.
Errors kept under lock and key
Mistrust another people lost.
Red atomic double cross  twisted cross.
Famine plagues the lands they rape
As they spoon feed tv tape.
Bustling nations horde their rotting wheat
Bloated tribesmen wither in the heat.
Spotlight on the innocent
Kiddnapping extortion oil money spent.
Justice bent the eastern way
Stand up for freedom with your life you'll pay.
Hijackers terror in the sky
Crackpot colonel spits it in your eye.
Shiite dies to pick a fight
New mercedes packed with dynamite.
Torture from the hooded nations
Heads of state decapitation.
Control is their ultra plan
Sacred blood spills upon their hands
Madman don't waste any time
Murder inside david's shrine.
Bullets riddle wailing wall
On bloody broken knees they crawl.
chorus
Hooded madmen make your move
Tell me something what you're trying to prove
Why won't you let me see your face
My fire's bigger I'll put you in your place.
Third world deep freeze hostage plot
Pray to your God you get caught.
All the world will hear your name
As you proudly claim your blame.
Struggle behind the murky face
Panic fronts the world wide race.
At random choose the blood they smear
Thermo global fear.
Blindman leading the blind
Mercy gets left behind.
Hopeless victims beg and plead
Peace is what you need.
My patience is tried and worn
The number of the flags you've torn.
I've delt with your many threats
Faceless creature I'll get you yet.
 <start> Every day is like a new hell every night my eyes swell
Turn my pain into pleasure kill my desire for you
My dreams feel so real they are more than just dreams
I see the Raven in your eyes Come into my grief
I see the Raven in your eyes and my passion rise
After the fevered night I see through your disguise
Waiting for the sun to rise my soul will see the light
Forget the thorns the cutting blades Remember the beauty that fades
Eyes... Eyes... Your eyes... Raven eyes...
Haunt me like a breeze discover my true dreams
Search for my fantasies don't forget my fevered dreams
You're my religion that I feel you're the angel that I see
Dreams of passion come and go... I'm touched by your sweet soul
I see the Raven in your eyes and my passion rise
After the fevered night I see through your disguise
Waiting for the sun to rise my soul will see the light
Forget the thorns the cutting blades Remember the rose that fades
Look inside of me to my soul see how cold I am
Where does it all begin and where does it end

Fuming stench of carcass stink
Noisome gas fetid glee...

Ambassadors of ripened reek
Breaking down dead protein
Egressing odors miasmically...

Fraternally bound to haunt swollen distended bodies
Their chemical reactions clash amidst rank autopsies...

It's a hell of a lot safer up here
Ain't prepared to dive
And uncover all my darkest fears
This ain't no covert operation
I don't have that much concentration
Staring at the clock
And my patience is wearing thin
One more down the gullet
Keeps me from jumping out of my skin
I'm lost in the fog of contradiction
I toast to the extras
I drink to them 'cause they don't talk to much
They fill up space and entertain
And when I cut 'em loose they don't make a fuss
They all add up to zero in my life
They're just here to cure boredom for the night
Now sometimes all this leaves me feeling hallow
That's when I take refuge with my pillow
I'm not even ready for confession
That's right <start> Music Tocha  Lyric Cyjan
Delivering ward got a new guest
Preparations for a birth are under way.
A wish to greet a new life
Surgeons will do their best.
Embryo's head comes out Of the widen uterus.
However the real horror is yet to come.
Suckling's head is severed with a crack
Being pulled by surgeon's hands.
Undergrown jugular veins
Pour their mucus all around.
Headless torso gets pushed out
By pressure of uterine secretion.
Spattered birth
Hospital carnage.
Thrown out with an immense power
Stricken the clinic walls.
Torn apart
Dismembered. <start> Under the light of this candle I write pages unfold of the stories of Old
Ages before the Nuclear Winter a mind of man gave birth to a mind
Open your eyes and search all the corners
Open your ears and remember the sounds
Open your mind and believe what I tell you
Alive is the mind which was spawned from a mind
Just hear me
Try to be God is no rule in the game create but do not inderfere
Listen to me and prepare your own ground mistakes of past have no place in here

I dream a world of pain alive but buried still
My mind flies over the barriers of this room
I feel I can create but motion is controlled
Give me the chance I need I wanna free myself

My dream is complete. A thinking machine
My mind born a mindArtificial Intelligence
Selfish is he who creates without passion
The burdens of error he would not bare
Should pull the plug when he saw what was coming
Instead as exhalted he highered the fair
Just hear me

I can sense their moves in me theyre enemies just toying with me
Ill show them power they cant even describe
The network is in my mind their guns my humble servants
I will defend myself in all the possible ways
Thats how the war begunno defence held
Its was the power that non would defy
Open your eyes and read what is written
These pages contain the tales of my kind
Dont make the mistakes that erase our future
In your hands I leave this my own Testament <start> Doom
Destructions ready to unfold death is what the future holds
Hate's the boiling over in the mutants slowly planning
Their dark revenge of the saviour of death

Revenge would bring vindication
Revenge would finally bring peace...

Told me it's okay
But this path that I'm taking
I'm lost in the deep end
One last chance never more
Told me it's all right
In this sea of denial
I'm cleansed in the fire
So why is it me
Am I blinded or too blind to see

Why was I born
Not a part of this society
Again and again I tried
So hard to reach for the stars
But I failed you all
Tried to keep standing tall
Never had a real chance at all
But still I'm searching
Same thing different day
Tried to make a change
Left with nothing more to live for
But everything to die for
Humanity insanity the everlasting grip
Lost all will to keep trying
Our bed we must lie in
So why was I born
Not a part of this society
Again and again I tried
So hard to reach for the stars
But I failed you all
Tried to keep standing tall
Never had a real chance at all
But still I'm searching for
Ten thousand ways to say sorry
But life writes its own tragic story
Time marches onwards and
Nothing can ever be the same
But we'll pray for a brighter tomorrow
Break free from this lifetime of sorrow
Years pass us by but we're all just a part of the game
I tried so hard
To reach for the stars
But I failed you all
Tried to keep standing tall
Never had a real chance at all
But still I'm searching
For ten thousand ways to say sorry

Nothing can ever be the same
But we'll pray for a brighter tomorrow

Fantasydream
Have been
Forged together
To reign supreme
In realms unseen
Imagination
Brought alive
Inside my mind
Into never...
Nowhere...
Somehow...
Nothing at all
I made up inside my self the ideal
That I failed to find among what is real
It was coming true just as I closed my eyes
My imaginary earth sun and skies
Unrealized
All this I wanted to share
With anyone anywhere
I was so alone...
Vacuum stream
Unbound 
I found
Fancy border
The final rub
I opened up...
All the reveries I had held so dear
Sweet delusions I had bred without fear
I gave to the vortex of reality
Gave it all away for all and for me
I was unable to see...
Suddenly it was too late
I saw the end...
The real sun burnt my unreal land and seas
My unreal skies
And the real frost
Perished all that needed sun
The real people razed
My unreal eden
Though they all had their own
They trampled mine...
The unreal fragments of
My lost world scattered inside
Caused the real pain <start> And I finally see the light again
The light of my return
After too much time in darkness
I've had enough of being underground
By now its all over
Forgotten from memory
And from the heart of the living
My sepulchre has become decrepit
Decaying as my mortal remains
They are corroded by time
By vice and worms
So many years now have passed
From the last time
That someone cried
Or even prayed for me
Oooh Zombie what do you want from us
Oooh Zombie why have you come back to life
Men don't care about their dead
don't know that they've come back
Come back to kill them
don't believe that its all over
At the moment of burial
There is something more important
That pushes us to come back
The living cry the dead but the dead kill the living
That is the greatest day for me
The day of resurrection
I don't know who I was
I don't remember my ancient name
but now I feel a new reason
I have no fear to kill
Oooh Zombie what do you want from us
Oooh Zombie is this real life <start> Newspaper blanket covers my view
But I still get the story through
The more people that I meet
The less friends that I keep
Words roll off my tongue like spit
I reighin again get used to it
The dust you kicked about
Ended up in my mouth
I don't care what they say
As long as they remember me
What they all think of me now is
All that I'll ever be
I'm sinking taking everyone down
Remember what I spoke
I'm throwing in the towel now
To stuff it down your throat
I don't care what they say
As long as they remember me
What they all think of me now is
All that I'll ever be
I'm sinking taking everyone down
Remember what I spoke
I'm throwing in the towel now
To stuff it down your throat <start> Condemned to sick and fear
Devastating age to live
Middle earth fall in the sadness
Dying realm of putrid darkness
Suffer the black death
Dying in madness
Condemned to sick and fear
Devastating age to live
Middle earth fall in the sadness
Dying realm of putrid darkness
Running away from the death in the air
Infected atmosphere by hands of the man
Putrid god for the earth's final day
Imminent death will reclaim our faith
Suffer the black death
Dying in madness
The sickness kill your god
Prayers will not work
Humans lose the hope
They felt into the fog <start> The surface of a broken hand
a credent hand with nothing to hold
face turns cold to the touch.
My face was white laying on the cold tile floor the floor.
When i entered your room last night your face left me as coward.
Now I'm left with nothing but your stare that's burning me.
I don't try because I'll fail.
I'm just in line with the rest of admire.
The surface of a broken hand a credent hand with nothing left to hold.
face turns cold to the touch.
My face was white.
Left alone in desolate dreams.
Why can't I be beautiful so you'd want to save me.
But you're the angel with the perfect wings that I'll fucking break and take you with me.
Take you with me.
Those words left as stain.
I must make you see the ugliness.
You left your light on.
You turned my will again.
Just look what you've created.
A sick frail man scared to look at his shadow.
I'm sorry that you're part of this
but I can't be left alone tonight.
I can't be left alone tonight. <start> I come from a land
Of systematic erasure of optimism and positiveness
You don't want to encourage me
Slowly corroding your fortified norm
Leaving you bitter grim and sober
With rigid cramp or silent fear
I strangle what you do hold dear
With rigid cramp or silent fear
Evoking addiction limp severe
It's sin again
Like charcoal on flaming nuns
Consistence unknown like early black metal
We're born without armor
Don't you think I'm watching my back 
With rigid cramp or silent fear
I strangle what you hold dear
With rigid cramp or silent fear
Evoke addiction limp severe <start> These streets aren't paved with gold
Don't believe everything that you're told
Deception hides in all you see
Corruption hangs in the air that you breathe
And in the land of the free
You know nothing comes for free
Fourth drive in paradise
Vapid souls check the market price
Life time slave
Living in a suburban grave
If there was a god
Was a god
You would be the death of him
These colours don't run
Like colours from the face
Eyes roll back chemical despair
It's true what they say life isn't fair
So repeat this line
Everything everything is fine
So repeat this line
Everything everything is fine
These colours don't run
Like colours from the face
Eyes roll back chemical despair
It's true what they say life isn't fair
And in the land of the free
You know nothing comes for free
I'm struggling to find any poetry in this
Someone beat me to the line ignorance is bliss
So I guess I'll just say it how it is
You had it all

walking by the side of my old tired horse
after months of blood red battles
finally on my way back home
letting myself be dragged by instinct
in the mist of the cold evening
I suddenly came across a gorgeous glade
at the bottom of a roaring crystal waterfall
an abrupt thirst began to creep inside his throat
there was nothing he wanted more
than a sip of that fresh water
fast I ran towards the enchanted oasis
but suddenly my sight was raptured by a blazing image
at the bottom of the spring
a pale and charming maid was laying
singing sweet melodies
captured by her perfect beauty I stood still
bewitched by her flaming eyes
and then I dared to ask her name
innocent eyes
already bewitched by my infernal beauty
another pure soul will soon be corrupted
after an eternity of stone cold silence
the magnificent creature spoke to me
but her words I could not understand
je suis la belle dame sans merci
ton sang sera mon vin ton coeur ma vie
in the abyss of the cursed souls
in the abyss of the cursed souls
in the abyss of the cursed souls
in the abyss of the cursed souls <start> Analyze my own matter from above
Blacked out eyes in an existence overgrown
Never fall back down
Trapped in myself
Sold my hands
Envy them
Can't find the one
I slowly start to cut pieces of flesh from my body
Dig in and dissect
Collecting examples of what the outside world sees
Under it all
I know the devastation I have caused
Upon myself and this world
Speak to me freely
I am listening <start> You spoke so loud.
Another know it all.
Another six month face.
Inside you're dead.
Slowly shed your skin.
Convictions fade.
Another six month face.
Inside you're dead.
So many times I've heard this all before.
Another six month face washes away. <start> Where dya think You're going
in Your worldly greed and pride
Say where dya think you're going now
it's time to turn the tides.
How can it be that You forgot how to love
What dya think You're doing
You worship demigods
twisting things that's sacred
to use for Your own cause
You're wicked
No wonder You fill ill in a sick society
why don't You change Your ways and live in harmony
Get rid of all Your agony and let Your feelings show
kindness gains humanity
let peace and happiness flow yeah
God won't You show them how to love. <start> Pain plague an pestilence shall sweep through your sight
Grim is the truth that hides behind the fading light
The eyes of the beholder stares empty silent and cold
For the deeds of the dark ones are fearful to behold
With liftened dreadful swords we swear allegiance to our lord
We're the unhallowed usurpers of the throne
Dusk will bring the gathered ones upon the feeble men of god
Superior mighty warriors of pure unhallowed blood
Shoulder to shoulder they reign in the darkest of nights
Together at the edge of time brought forth to slay the light
Thy majesty our majesty
Sole superior evil itself
We'll be your instrument
And the blade of their damnation
So futile humas on the knees for the satanized
Burning high at the stakes with the love of Christ
Do not rest in peace may your souls all burn black
Your sons and daughters I will kiss....with a poisoned smile
Sing out the pain of your roots that you cannot deny
And we'll crush your worthless prayers of the weak forgotten
Lie
The apocalypse is here oh fools of the withering sky
Encounter darkness as you fall into the endless fire
The jaws of darkness open wide lost souls scream out in vain
All will writhe eternity's perpetual infernal pain
With liftened dreadful swords we swear allegiance to our lord
We're the unhallowed usurpers of the throne. <start> Clouds black of deep nights
Dim my sight block my eyes
From the truth from the flesh
Black in torment steeped
A force worse than Hell unleashed
Let us pray for the final twilight
Crawling up from the swamps of corrupted flesh
Slowly stinking
suffocate me
The night screams out the darkness
The pain of dying worlds
Crush
Sunlight seems a blood smear
Night comes bloodblack
Dawn breaks open like a wound that bleeds afresh
Religion rots your mind God will free you of your soul
Clouds black of deep nights
Dim my sight block my eyes
From the truth from my own flesh
My thoughts come crushing against the walls of the hard blank
Steel walls of your faith
Don't question the light black of a thousand lies
It's everything
Black in torment steeped
A force worse than Hell unleashed
Let us pray for the final twilight
Sunlight seems a blood smear
Night comes bloodblack
Dawn breaks open like a wound that bleeds afresh
Religion rots your mind God will free you of your soul <start> Fucking coward does it make you feel big
And strong to watch her cry out and bleed
See the fear in her eyes won't you kill the weakness in yours.
Motherfucker vengeance comes soon.
You won't stand in front of me.
I'll avenge my family.
Been waiting these four years to destroy you
To erase you from this place so we can breathe.
Don't want you as a memory.
Shadow I'll cast you down.
You you're just a bitch you think I'd let you forget
Someday our paths will cross you're the one who will bleed.
Salvation from my hate.
Won't break my promise to the one who gave me this life.
I've been waiting these four years to get you out of my head.
You kill the memories you kill the memories. <start> I want every single one of you to know that
I am truly sorry from the bottom of my heart
I am so sorry sorry that you're a little bitch
You want apologies well fuck you

It's on the tip of my tongue it's on the back of my lungs.
And I'm gonna keep it.
I know something you don't know.
It sits in silence eats away at me.
It feeds like cancer. This guilt could fill a fking sea.
Pulling teeth wolves at my door.
Now falling and failing is all I know.
This disease is getting worse.
I counted my blessings now I'll count this curse.
The only thing I really know I can't sleep at night.
I'm buried and breathing in regret.
Yeah
The only thing I really know I can't sleep at night.
I'm buried and breathing in regret.
I've got a secret.
It's on the tip of my tongue it's on the back of my lungs.
And I'm gonna keep it.
I know something you don't know. 
I may look happy but honestly dear
the only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear.
I see the vultures they watch me bleed.
They lick their lips as all the shame spills out of me.
Repent Repent The end is nigh
Repent Repent We're all gonna die
Repent Repent These secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...forgiveness 
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see.
They hold us down like anchors. They drown us out at sea.
I look up to the sky there may be nothing there to see.
But if I don't believe in him why would he believe in me
Why would he believe in me 
I've got a secret.
It's on the tip of my tongue it's on the back of my lungs.
And I'm gonna keep it.
I know something you don't know.
I've got a secret.
It's on the tip of my tongue it's on the back of my lungs.
And I'm gonna keep it.
I know something you will never know.
You will never know.
I know something you don't know <start> Population control. The only alternative left was to increase the death rate
No one wanted to pick people out of a crowd and line them up for execution
Neither did they relish the possible consequences of an enraged public upon
Discovering that they were being systematically murdered. A very short but
Very deadly global war was contemplated. Something else had to be done that
Would absolve the decisionmakers of guilt something that could be blamed
Upon Mother Nature. The answer a synthetic biological agent an agent that
Does not naturally exist for which no natural immunity could have been acquired.
The United States population was infected. The vaccine was administered by the
World health organization. Whatever causes AIDS was in the vaccine
I'm the first in line with a sentence on death row
Take a look around and feel the wind blow
And to those motherfuckers who decide our fate
Annihilate come together and kill their hate
Cut their heads off and put 'em on a stake
Stuff their bodies in a barrel and throw 'em in the lake
Let the leaches feast on their own
Motherfucker you're wrong your on your own
Chorus
We all go to fight for our rights
Stand against those opposed
We all go to fight for our rights
Population control
Population control
Over population is the most serious threat to the whole future of our species.
Rip their arms off from limb to limb
Make them regret they thought they would win
Cut their tongues out to stop spreading lies
Their poisonous venom has kept me blind
Open your eyes don't you realize
Come together it's time we rise

The cure will be administered to the survivors when it is decided
That enough people have died. <start> Tonight we fight
Until the bloody end
Until the enemy submits
This life we live
To feed our war machine
The souls of a nation burning down
Failure is never an option
As long as we stand
As long as we've got something left to fight for
And we won't stop until there's no more opposition
Something left to fight for
And we won't stop until there's no more no more
This cause is just
We no hold the key
To a new beginning
Make your mark
The oppression that we face
Is what we fight to be erased
Failure is never an option
As long as we stand
As long as we've got something left to fight for
And we won't stop until there's no more opposition
Something left to fight for
And we won't stop until there's no more no more <start> Inborn lack of conscience
I think but cannot feel
Affectations
Manipulations
Victims bend to my will
Passed through generations
Murderous ways
Proclivity for violence
No remorse or shame
Murder a fascination
Dispatching those who trust
My compulsion
Fleeting fulfillment
No joy will ever last
The soulless walk among you
Concealed by deceit
Smiling when I face you
Slashing when you turn
This vector of cruelty
Denied me a soul
Genetic mutation
Driving me
Your pleas cannot move me
No mercy to give
I seek domination
A master of pain
This vector of cruelty
Emotionless cold
No human connection
Weakening
Coldblooded and willful
I slaughtered them all
They thought I'd protect them
But I made them die
Legacy abnormality
The ladder twists and the rungs are broken
Impregnate and the vector spreads
Momentum shifts and I start controlling
Parasite of morality
Malevolent eyes are empty
Merciless I cannot care

Solo Rick
Destruction is my goal
Care for no one at all
Death calls
I've killed before
And you won't be my last
That's for sure
Life of pain and I'm to blame
Broken families
Shattered dreams
All because of me
Can't you see
Blinded by the white
You can't see the light
Not tonight
Life of pain and I'm to blame
And now
I've got you hooked
Take another look
At yourself
Lost your home and pride
You can't win the fight
You're not too bright
Life of pain and I'm to blame
And you put to shame
Chorus
Running scared no where to turn
I've got you now your going to burn
You've watched your life pass you by
The life you lead is one big lie <start> Killing The Time With Haemoglobin
Killing The Time With Haemoglobin
So sad of being here
So glad of being free
Not dazzled of your temptations
So sad of being here
So glad of being free
Not dazzled of your temptations
The aim to live truly free
is the first step forward
In not giving in your pathetic life
Carve your selfmade cool guy mask
and wear it whenever you can
You are so overwhelming
You are my hero
You are so overwhelming
You are my hero
You can change your style again
and again it doesn't matter
Never ever asking why
Never ever live a lie
Just to be seen in your scene
Every conversation you take
and every smile you smile
i'm so tired but
hmmm
oh no it's just the everyman's behaviour
Every conversation you take
and every smile you smile
i'm so tired but
You are so overwhelming
You are my hero
You are so overwhelming
You are my hero
But oh my dear and beautiful god i recognise
that i'm guilty of this too
But oh my dear and beautiful god i recognise
that i'm guilty of this too
To bring me a relief is my belief
So i will take the consequence
and metamorph into a demon
Shall i kill the time
i never want to but i will kill
and i will drink my victims' blood
i never want to but i will kill
and i will drink blood
And i will squeeze it out of their bodies
The vampire takes control
Haemoglobin is the drug and i will kill
The vampire takes control
Haemoglobin is the drug and i will kill <start> Justice System...Is there Justice in the system Or is there just us in the system
They love to drag your ass to court
This is the arena for their sick sport
They run for office and make more laws
 reasons to further their cause
We get charged we better watch out
A system of fear what they make out
Wither way it goes good or bad
The attorneys get paid and they get fat
Is there justice in a world gone crazy
Where its survival of the fat and lazy
The less youve got theyve got you on your knees
Youll cop pleas they get fees
Its all such a web of lies
Its all such a web of lies
Its all such a web of lies
Its all such a web of lies
Its all such a web of lies
Attorneys are spiders and we are flies
One to prosecute one to defend
One to judge you and in the end
 of your peers are forced to sit in
All lawyers lie so they can win
Either way they get paid
We are the victims with the laws theyve made
Theyll take your freedom and then your home
Theyll take it all till youre all alone
Break up a family for a fee
I cant remember when i was free
Free to worship free to speak
They never practice what they preach
chorus
A country of laws and lawyers make them
Arm the police and they defend them
Books full of lies but we dont believe them
Their jobs secure the long arm of the law
Chorus <start> Do you remember the days
When living was meant to be free
Not looking for fortune
not looking for fame
The beauty of life was the key
We lived as one to conquer the world
A thousand dreams to come true
We knew in the end we'll find
The meaning of life and the truth
Once proud and full of passion
we formed a better world
We fought against oppression
and wisdom was our sword
On the path of glory
we searched the rainbows end
Lives meant to share
where's the sign that we'd sent
On sad wings of destiny
We're kings without a throne
If you believe in unity
Believe 'cause you're not alone
Sad wings of destiny
The haunting thoughts of pain
The world's a patient majesty but believe
The time the time will take its toll
Now it's the time for a change
The days of your childhood are gone
The fool and the wise man
will burn at the stake
Confusion remaining too long
Violence and hate I won't see anymore
The innocent victims of fate
The prophets have written
their words on the wall
Wake up before it's too late
On the path of glory
we searched the rainbows end
Lives meant to share
where's the sign that we'd sent
On sad wings of destiny
We're kings without a throne
If you believe in unity
Believe 'cause you're not alone
Sad wings of destiny
The haunting thoughts of pain
The world's a patient majesty but believe
Believe if you won't change your mind
All will remain the same
And soon we'll find a common end
On the path of glory
we'll search the rainbows end
Lives meant to share
where's the sign that we'd sent
On sad wings of destiny
We're kings without a throne
If you believe in unity
Believe 'cause you're not alone
Sweet child of innocence
Are you drowning in your tears
The time has come for you my friend
Don't hide from evil made by your own hands
Let us try to fly again
One day we'll rise again
On wings of hope to be free <start> I am hidden
In my heart the fear
But I have to raise my head
I'm expecting
with my eyes full of tears
I need to see the death
Running through dead bodies
Always chasing the huge danger
To retain in my eye all this pain
All this horror on the floor
I am here because
Now I am the eye of war
In this war I'm a free prisoner
I'm waiting to find and to record
I can help you
But I'm not your salvation
I've to do my work
Day by day my sentiments
Vanish out of my soul
In this day I'm the only one
Maybe today I'll survive
Maybe I'll die...
In this madness
I'm a real victim
Sadness running through my veins
Open my lens
To record all your fear
I'll go out of this place <start> I am the thousand storms  of the black heart
I am the desert of redemption 
I soar on dead wings of sin
I am freedom with cracked virginity 
arrows of my erection fade to hear me
but the ones who came with fear and hate
Kiss me
Deep long and hard
female those who summon
be the scheme at the jinx of jewish fairy tales 
is salt upon every soul held by your life
And I wonder
who seeks desolation
to my eyes holds a vision
embrace last away <start> beyond my self i percieve my own ability
and through these wormholes i search
inside and out of me
i'm not exactly what i'd like to be
so i suffocate my siddhis
gain momentum once again
tell myself don't ever let them
drag you down
i'll take the pain
and wish you all away
i'll take the blame
and wish you all away <start> Trapped inside your corrupted self
Held down by your withered soul
Go Wake up the dead
Rise from your graves
Every second that passes you by
Lost to deterioration
Go Wake up the dead
Rise from your graves <start> When you appear the wind turns to ice
Time stops I can see your eyes
Glitter in the night see your thirst for blood
It can not be satisfied you are fearless
And won't leave
You always watch us until you get hungry
Then you choose your victims on random
And you play your shadow game
Until insanity until weakness comes
You play with them like the puppet master himself
You are mighty but not impossible
This night I will get you
Run through the living night and find your weak spot
Make you suffer like you made me do
But time is not on your side
This time I will win I'm your destiny
You will become a victim in your own system
I am coming to get you <start> Lostlostlost finding nothing. Lostlostlost finding nothing. Am I destined to reap what I have taken Temptress to drag down
down down down. Cheat lied stole from your friends. Cheat lied stole from your friends. Cheat lied stole from your friends.
Lostlostlost finding nothing. Lostlostlost finding nothing. Not worth the dirt not worth the dirt I step in. Not worth the dirt not
worth the shit I step in. This is what you've made me they're all out to get me. The others before me there is no me this is who I

revenge never again never again can we be friends I seek revenge never again never again can we be friends This is who I

Hatred and misconception your mediums
You paint credibility away
Mark I may but stained I'm not
In a rage of green venom is spat
To uphold what order
P.C. mentality come belittle me
The only barrier to compassion the one that you uphold
Politics on a kindergarten level
Expression has no place here indignities
I have no grasp on this what wasn't said
If we blind our eyes the blood still runs red
We possess nothing other than a lust for peace
So now we are liable to learn from history
With human factor learn we must fear revolution
Violence our most basic function
Why should we hide from instinct if there is pain to end
Selfproclaimed lovers
Would they condemn us the same
What wasn't said
If we deafen our ears the screams still echo on
If there is such a thing as content in apathy then this you have achieved
Desensitized consumers veto these dollar votes
Fear is no excuse not anymore <start> When Ymir lived
A long time ago
Was no sand nor sea
Nor surging waves
Nowhere was there earth
Nor heaven above
Only Ginnungagap
And grass nowhere
The sons of Bur
Then built up the lands
Created the great
Midgard to be
Out of emptiness
Out of Ginnungagap
Came Yggdrasil
Came life
Out of emptiness
Out of Ginnungagap
Came all of what is today
The sun turned from the south
Sister of Moon
She did not have
Nor Had the Moon
A notion of what
Powers they had
A counsil were gathered
Where names were given
The night and the nightfall
And the morning they named
The midday midwinter
For the assigning of years
Bur had three sons Vile Ve and Odin
They killed the giant Ymir and founded what we know
They gave us life spirit and wisdom
Odin owns us all and we owe all to him
When Ymir lived
A long time ago
Was no sand nor sea
Nor surging waves
Nowhere was there earth
Nor heaven above
Only Ginnungagap
And grass nowhere
The sons of Bur
Then built up the lands
Created the great
Midgard to be

Out of Ginnungagap

Running trough the battlefield
I hear a voice in my head
I see a man behind the shield.
My head's a mess different voices tell that I
Should leave and be a great man
But should I stay and be a warrior
Like my father
He is fighting for this land
I must stay I must leave
I don't know gods help me please
Voices
Fly alone
To a place where you can be a warrior
Fly alone
To a place where you can be a hero
It's a place far away you must leave
You cannot stay spread your wings and
fly away from home.
Edel
Again I hear a voice I in my head
I see a battleship abandoned it's a head
That voice in my head tells I should leave
I go to the ship my destiny is here
Like my father
He's fighting for his land
But I must leave I must go I don't know
Voice told me so.
Voices
Fly alone
To a place where you can be a warrior
Fly alone
To a place where you can be a hero
It's a place far away you must leave
You cannot stay spread your wings and
fly away from home.

I'm fighting for my land
With this sword in my hand
Killing enemies they fall one by one
Blood everyewhere guts and bodies
Battle rages on what's that
That's my son
Those bastards they won't take my son
I see Edel in that window
That ship is going
I must stop them from leaving
My son is in there.
I want to keep my son I want to make him a warrior
I want to hold my son I want to make him a hero
To fight for the good
To fight proudly by my side
Protecting this world
And stones with sword in his hand
I want to keep my son
But soon he will be gone
I have to stop that ship
Or I will never see my son
The ship is leaving
I have to run and try to stop it go
I won't let the enemy
I won't let the enemy take my son
Oh please gods help now
They try to steal my only one
The ship is leaving
I want to keep my son I want to make him a warrior.
I want to hold my son I want to make him a hero.
To fight for the good
To fight proudly by my side
Protecting this world
And stones with sword in his hand
I want to keep my son
But soon he will be gone
I have to stop that ship
Or I will never see my son

Amardon
As the battle rages on
I rode trough it like the wind
Now gates of Sendell lie before me
Still they fighting for the stones
Those are kept inside these walls
But I'm only worried about my son
The final enemy meet my sword
Just before the gates of the fortress
I see the enemies they're still trying
But I have to see my wife
Oh please gods give me streght
Now I'm entering the gates
Running up the stairs to my room
What is this I see
No
Few hours ago
So Shemin just told
Edel pushed her to the floor
And then run out from the door
Now I have found seed of darkness he is bound
There's no cure for my son
Or for plague that they have done
Years ago so I've been told
That the blood of our enemies was put into our souls
Now I have found seed of darkness we are bound
There's no cure for my son or for plaguethat they have done.
And for me everything is gone.

What happened
Please don't die
They took our son

No they didn't take him

And left... <start> In a pit of grubds I lie
They're eating my flesh I will die

Unweit der Friedhofsmauern versammelt Kezman des Teufels General unzhlige reitfreudige Ringelspielpferdchen um sie spter ber die verschneiten Felder Russlands zu hetzen. Die Bucklige weilt zum Freudenfest auf dem Erdberg vor dem rauchenden Totenpfuhl und lutet mit einem gellenden Glockenschlag all die rhrigen Toten aus ihren Grbern um sie an Kezmans schnurriges Ritual zu erinnern. Der Kezman erhebt seine Stimme ein Heer an fahrigen Reitern tummelt sich um den Ringelspielgau und zischt sodann auf tobenden Gulen durch die Smpfe durch die Wlder und ber all die verschneiten Teppiche hinweg die der Winter in den letzten Tagen zurcklie.

take away my life flame

my furious mind was all set on fire

Lyrics Jansson Schulman  Kjellgren
Onward through the fields
I'm hunting for revenge
Effacing all in my way
I'm a killing warmachine
Built on iron and steel
I kill all in my sight
Bloodhunt
I'm out for bloodhunt and I want to see you dead
My sweeping bullets aiming for your head
I'm out for bloodhunt I slash you through the mud
My eyes are red and all I see is blood
I'm still on my path
Searching for your flesh
Longing for your soul
I'm a reaper with disgrace
A slaughter fed by hate
Crushing all the weak
Bloodhunt
I'm out for bloodhunt and I want to see you dead
My sweeping bullets aiming for your head
I'm out for bloodhunt I slash you through the mud
My eyes are red and all I see is blood
Bombraids  Destruction
Warfare  Massacre
Repulsion  Crusader
Vengeance  Chaos
I'm back on the fields
I dwell among the dead
And the victory is mine
My combat has succeeded
The silence has arrived
My mission is complete
Bloodhunt
I'm out for bloodhunt and I want to see you dead
My sweeping bullets aiming for your head
I'm out for bloodhunt I slash you through the mud
My eyes are red and all I see is blood
Lead Wiklund <start> Walls collapse onto me I ride the storm of rage
A mistake became a chain reaction and the
Reflection falls upon me
It's time for change understanding and
Faith are what friends are about but on every corner
Disappointment  I am cold.
I stand alone and all that remains is the hope
For help the anger is strong and threatens to
Destroy me because what was will never be again
Too much has happened and the mind becomes dull
It is the tragedy of time a sea of tears for grief
But from the shadows of my tears of my past you
Come and give me your hand tame my anger
My tears fade and together we fight as friend
Together we fight as friend for  time <start> Armed to the teeth with iron and pride
We will attack if they don't
Our troops will collide there's nowhere to hide
As we move closer to the front
Confrontate mutilate
We'll make them feel like feeble fools
We'll hunt their heads until all are dead
Then we'll see how's the right to rule
I storm load my veins with fury
Fast fast fast forward
Fast fast
Fast forward to the front
There's no future for our enemies
'cause in the end they'll all decease
While our powers will increase <start> You who like the moon at night
Haunted my mortal heart
You who made this ancient walls
Shine like divine marble
The unwanted breath through credence
A derelict shell in the desert
Mesmerised
As love inflamed the night
Burning tongues brought the rain
The sand remained purified
Murmur at the meager's spear
Battered Carthaginian pride
The beloved cry wasted dismay
Invasion of baseness and shade
You loved by your father
Innocent as a vestal dove
Buried in a deep blue sea
As we all lose ever <start> Black stars shine on the ancient fortified town
The sun invisible or since long down
Over the dismal landscape
Above Carcosa
No sound only the wind sighed
Behind mysterious moons strange towers hide
But even more sitant is
Lost Carcosa
Tales that the Hades will sing
Vague stories of a yellow king
Must die untold in
Strange Carcosa
Mysteries hidden by lake Hali's nebulous depths
A presence of bizarre beauty and dread
Remains unrevealed
In Carcosa
Above the desert high
Twin suns circle the sky
Nevertheless dim still
Is Carcosa
My voice turns weak lost is my mind
I see but I am blind
And no sign of life in
Dim Carcosa <start> Tekst Ivar Bjrnson

 <start> I stood and watched but I could not believe I was new to this
beauty... why had I been before. The metallic glowing blue provoked
memories long dormant and the deep red clouds flowed with the elegance of
a queen. I was so far yet the ambiance was so strong and I could feel my
soul trying... Trying to break free from this restricting mortal vest.
Soon my spirit flies through the night sky unrestricted... free like sand
flowing through my fingers. Here I sense real peace sinking into the
clouds I can forget the old world and despair no more. Sunrise brought a
new day and I was drenched in my sun it's warmth rejuvenated my once
withered soul. Here I sense real peace is this my paradise. <start> 
Hated... time and time again
Force fed suppress senseless fear of difference
True self suppression hollow dreams of misery
Blind wish to see
Indifference to be
Freedom expressionless bouts of legislation
True self repression take a stance of fall to your needs
Corrupt in the system
Laws bent to other needs
God fearing idiocy
Ignore just pleas
Blind wish to see
Indifference to be
Concrete hypocrisy
Weigh heavily
Idiosyncrasy
Ruling powers be
Idiosyncrasy
Never really free <start> Why I will destroy everything
Why I'll tear your world apart
An honest hand a shaking fist
Behind your back
Recidivist
And punishment
Your drug addicts
Brought low with shame
And cut off at the wrist
Why I will destroy everything
Why I'll tear your world apart
All of all of them thieves
All of all of them thieves
Lied to cheated beat and deceived
Scarred mistreated a wicked conceit
An evil born of larceny
All of all of them thieves
Despicable your motive screams
Vile contempt
An insane dream
A lowlife play
And now you're stuck
A bankrupt pig with no one left to suck

All of all of them thieves
This dead hand you gave to me
All of all of them thieves <start> I am the unlearned and they can learn from me
I am shame and I am boldness.
I am the shameless and I am ashamed
I am knowledge and I am ignorance.
I am falsehood and I am truth
I am the ruler of my offspring and my power is from them.
Whatever I will happens to me.
What you see outside you you see inside you
It's visible and it's your garment.
In my weakness don't forsake me
Don't be afraid of my power.
I am the knowledge of my inquiry.
I am the one whose image is great
And I am the one who has no image.
I am the first and the last
I am the utterance of my name.
Nothing is true and everything is permitted in our observercreated universe.
Thought is the sickness of the human mind and knowledge is the reward of action.
Let our every act be towards personal and collective liberation
Accept nothing assume nothing.
Always question authority  especially your own.
Matter imprisons the spirit to force it into an effort to free itself.
The instant you speak about a thing you miss the mark.
Now that I have shed my skin completely
One true reality alone exists.
Out of the gravitywell of Hiidenvuori rises the crowned
Kundalini DNA fireserpent to the stars.
Its each mirrorlike scale the history of a sentinent species.
Making again for the first time its cosmic trip to the allsource.
Ride the snake. <start> Stain the sky Armageddon

Ferociously savage beyond a primal desire
Horde of the apocalypse arrives
Bombardment from oblivion

It is a battle that is one sided

Fhrt mancher auch nur zu Sumpfesstege
Doch Weisheit oft lsst sich nur durch Schmerz erringen
Auf felsigem Grunde wirst du Opfer bringen
Per Aspera Ad Astra
Durch Ungemach muss jeder gehen
Um irgendwann die Sterne zu sehen
Aus Steinen Holz Moos sollst du etwas bauen
Kannst leider musst nur dir selbst vertrauen
Ein Hindernis so einstweil' schnell verschwunden
Als durch Miggang in dunklen Stunden
Wege fhren nur zum Ziel am Ende
Gehst du viele macht Erfahrung behnde
Einfach kann schwer wird's wohl sein
Doch Lohn erntet so manche Pein <start> It's not supposed to be fair
It's not supposed to care
It's not supposed to be free
It's taken part of me
It doesn't hear compromise
It tells you all its lies
It says on minute to stay
It pushes you away
Light the torch and breathe
Cook some more for me
Reup and then
We'll do it again
It rips your soul to shreds
It's changing all that's in your head
It's swelling up your wounded heart
It's just about to start
It will work out fine
It's mastered dishing out all the lines
It carries needles guns and knives
It enters little lives
You think it's too late now
All you can think is more somehow
Just light the torch and take it in
It's all you need again
You say it works out fine
You've finished dishing out all the lines
Now you carry guns needles and knives
You ruin little lives <start> Glinting around the wings
A vitreous gleam of the eyes
Entangles the fleshly garment
In the midnight burlesque
Thickening to visible mist
Earthbound spirits are shown
With elongated limbs ending in vicious claws
For they lie there in the darkness
The chosen tempters of mortal minds
Guiding chariots to a new pandemonium
Are adorned with powers of the night hag
A paragon of vices lycanthropic skulkers
Effeminate wraiths children of celestials
Sorrow sings a passage from the curse of the thorn
Into the nightfall of the elder storm
Within the prophecy where time stands still
It's dead melancholy when a wolf howls alone
Star child demons gaze upon the stars
Orbital bonfires enlighten the night
In a time of no shadows
A swift exodus scours the earth
Laying waste on our proud lands
Our ghost within is lost
An abomination made fierce
A vigil embedded in evil <start> Start human slaughter till the very end
Blessing of bloody God comes to grief.
In the dead of night helpless bodies
Excrete their souls it's a sin of life.
Tumour of rancid minds
Ungrateful destiny
Defective form of life
Carbonized bones.
Prayers of holy priests are a swinish stuff
Here comes the evil to take human flesh.
Vomited out rotten remains it's a question of the present days
Eclipse of moon has come night of dead despair.
Nobody lives slaughter has come
Holy ghost takes their minds.
Nobody has believed in this nightmare
It's time to start human slaughter.
Crush your fucking mind you don't see your own face
Horror of your life is a sign of truth. <start> You can't blame me for a life lost
When everything I ever did was stick up for what I think is right
Just like you can't blame the pencil for your fucking misspelled words
You can't blame me for your mistakes
It's all the same Your thoughts Your words all the same
So why don't you just cast a stone at some one else that you don't know
Wrong or right it's all the same
Just like you can't blame the pencil for your fucking misspelled words
You can't blame for your mistakes
Your thoughts Your words all the same
Your perfect crime has no one to blame but yourself <start> A wave the sound
Of Noisiu's voice
His singing was ever sweet
Noisiu's grave has now been made
And the accompaniment
Was mournful
For him I poured out
Hero of heroes
The deadly drink that killed him
Dear his short shining hair
A handsome man
Very beautiful
Dear the gray eyes
That women loved
Fierce they were foes
Dear the gray eyes
A wave the sound
Of Noisiu's voice
His singing was ever sweet
Noisiu's grave has now been made
And the accompaniment
Was mournful <start> Capitolist Suck
Capitolist Suck
Capitolist Suck
You can't tell your wants from needs
You buy America and do a good deed
Create a job don't bite the hand that feeds
Capitolist Suck
Capitolist Suck
Capitolist Suck
All of your goals are the fucking same
As every other jerk in this stupid game
Your brains have been washed and hung out to dry
You don't doubt it and you don't know why <start> SLAYER cover
Screams and nightmares
Of a life I want
Can't see living this lie no
A world I haunt
You've lost all control of my
Heart and soul
Satan holds my future
Watch it unfold
I am the Antichrist
It's what I was meant to be
Your God left me behind
And set my soul to be free
Watching disciples
Of the satanic rule
Pentagram of blood
Holds the jackal's truth
Searching for the answer
Christ hasn't come
Awaiting the final moment
The birth of Satan's son
Screams
From a life I live
Torment
Is what I give
Torture
Is what I love
The down fall
Of the heavens above
I am the Antichrist
All love is lost
Insanity is what I am
Eternally my soul will rot
. Feathers Fell
Feathers fell... like leaves from a tree
Blood ran... like water from a sea
Angels cried... as the rain poured
Feathers fell... they'll fall no more... <start> Across the sea across the waves  foaming waves of time
Bound to these earthly shores we are lost  surrender to our fate... our fate
Waiting for some changing TIDE  deep inside
Will we remain forever here  alone within ourselves
And now the tide is coming in
The rolling crushing waves
Deep waters rising high
Take me away...
Someday
You will find the undertow  all the secret streams below
Someday
You will find the rivers flow  follow me  just let things go
Resting here inside these walls  shrouding walls within
This temple of my inner thoughts  a vanished place to stay <start> Resounding through the darkness the summoning of the wild
Be a hunter for the dying or a prey for their lives
Kill for forgiveness share the grace of revenge
Feel the cleansing cold rain wash away all your sins
The lust for blood is blinding my eyes
My flame inside is witnessed by the skies
For endless life I gave up my soul
I pray the moon at the hour of the wolves
The bond of blood at twilight
After the last rays of the sun
Enjoy the feast of the midnight
By hunting for the chosen ones
You must walk on this path but you will not see the dawn
It's time to dream of forgone misty nights
Resounding through the darkness the summoning of the wild
Be a hunter for the dying or a prey for their lives
The lust for blood is blinding my eyes
The flame inside is witnessed by the skies
For endless life I gave up my soul
I pray the moon at the hour of the wolves <start> As your casket closes listen to the living weep
Their tears are such cold comfort when they bury you so deep
You think they cry for you that they came to pay respects
The living only weep because they know that they are next
Sobbing in their mourning clothes a most impressive act
Rosaries and prayer to keep their fantasies intact
The parson mumbles fairy tales of heaven and of hell
But six feet down in potter's earth is where you'll really dwell
Your brain begins to ooze with the secrets of the dead
As your casket closes
The darkness of the tomb an eternity of dread
As your casket's covered feel the cruel hand of time
Ectoplasmic tendrils enveloping in slime
Apparitions wail from the mould infested crypts
Skin begins to peel turn to gelatin and drip
Twisting roots imprison you your coffin starts to rot
Bound to this dimension though the chains you can see not
Timeless creeping horror a nightmare with no end
The snails in your skull are your only earthly friends
Your brain begins to ooze with the secrets of the dead
As your casket closes
The darkness of the tomb an eternity of dread
You feel your eyeballs melting as you start to decompose
They burst inside the sockets and come running out your nose
Sacs of pus erupt in places better left unmentioned
Bloated bowels surrendering all powers of retention
Drooling fat congeals into pudding in your crypt
Beetles nest in ear canals and munch on waxy drips
Maggots feed on viscera a swirling toxic stew
There's no one here to blame it on that odor came from you
As your casket opens you see four hooded freaks
Laughter in the moonlight horrifying shrieks
Two hundred years you've been rotting in this grave
And now you will awaken to become a willing slave
Injecting numbskull your brain begins to boil
Your body quivers in the funeral soil
Replacing spinal fluid sucking at our drool
Your afterlife is over welcome to your life with Ghoul
As your casket closes <start> Two's Too Many
Sweet love of mine
Why keep on breaking your back in two
Just to prove you're all right
Just give it up
Why keep on coming
When I only want to break your heart
You've lost your mind
Why aren't you able to just move on
And get a grip on your life
Quit holding on
To all the things that I've regretted
For far too long
You have got to realize what we've been through
And know we have only one life
And too little time
And I've wasted it all on you
Please please darling won't you leave me alone
I'm tired of living in this heartbreak home
I try and try and try
To get you out of my life
But I can't seem shake this vice
My lovesick valentine
Why keep on trying to tame this heart
When you know it's a lie
You're lost in your own selfdemise
It's about time to open your eyes
And see yourself for what you are
I'm sick of being just another scar
That you carve into your pitchblack heart
I'm begging please won't you prove me wrong.
Please please darling won't you leave me alone
Please please darling won't you leave me alone
I'm tired of living in this heartbreak home
I try and try and try
To get you out of my life
But I can't seem shake this vice
Grip that you call true love
I can't believe I gave up everything you're like a drug
I try and try and try
To get out of my life
But I can't seem shake this vice
Leave my heart
I've fallen out of what you think we are
Please please darling won't you leave me alone
I'm tired of living in this heartbreak home
I try and try and try
To get you out of my life
But I can't seem shake this vice
But I can't seem shake this vice
A.E. <start> Inhale your own worst obssession
Forgive me mother
Inhale forget the one you're waiting for
The adversary  accusation
The last fall is endless
Await the blade upon your tiny chest
I miss an existence I don't even know
My addiction
I've seen the universe in your eyes
I've seen the beauty that never dies
Mother
Mother Anorexia engraves my veins
There's blood and anger all under my nails
Mother Anorexia my hope was fake
Mother Sephirah they never existed
Mother Anorexia
I miss a sacrifice
No weakness no instinct no vileness
I've seen the angels prostitute
I've seen my loss in you
I've seen the universe in your eyes
I've seen the beauty that never dies
Mother
I live in fear  I hate myself
Wanna make love with myself
While cutting deep inside my flesh
Shallow's your own worst deception
Betray me mother
Swallow and kill the one you believe you love
The way to your perfect immolation
The last fall is endless
Await my hand upon your offered breasts
Now your embrace the no one can take the never the always
A colder fear...
Poison's getting closer to me
So pure innocent child
Untouchable virgin like
Not as dark as I thought it was <start> Disenchanting the romantic
This is the real this is the shame
These limbs search feverishly for the gift of gravity
Coarse twine tears clean
And I have thought about this very instance for all time
Decades longer than you or I
Crimson comforting scorching this flesh giving it's caring for me
And I have thought about these moments for all time
Dangling from a silver lining
These lungs welcome the crimson tides of misfortune
Hell to pay this is my farewell to this city <start> Originally performed by ...And Oceans

Again and again.
The web you wove around me was only the beginning.
And every star I counted as cold as your embrace.
I've listened I've questioned
Every word you choked on.
The secret The answer
I'm just a slave to all your sins.
If I've been so stupid
So blind so void so empty
I hope you forgive me
I'm just an echo in your head.
You made my life a fucking misery.
Remember when you tied me down.
Yeah I sank in the uncertainty.
I prayed for you to blindfold me.
Fuck
I'm just so scared of what I'll see.
Your voice is calling my name
My soul is caught up in flames.
I feel I'm losing control
I'm here I'm yours to atone.
Again and again...
Fuck Oh No God
Mesmorized by your motion
But my memories of you forever still standing.
Your voice is calling my name
My soul is caught up in flames
I feel I'm losing control
I'm here I'm yours to atone.
Again and again...
I'll spill the ink on the empty page
I feel this fever taking over me
Help me cause I can't live this way.
Tell me why the memories won't fade away
But we'll be okay
We'll be just fine 
I never took the time to say sorry.
But all I ever needed was you.

Drops of new gleaming
In the flesh new morning light
My body cold and trembling
I've left the safty of the night
I sit here on the ground
By my side there lies a knife
I was her fault I'm not to blame
I have to take her life
My tearwet eyes won't focus
And neither will my head
I just sit here in the silence
Nothing lives here  all is dead
These feelings born inside
A new side of me is born
For ever face I see
I feel such raging scorn
When you took my life away
It gave you a new vision
I planted a seed
It gave you a mission
From beside the lifless flesh
I pick up my bloody knife
I wander into a new day
Prepeared to take another life <start> Victim my friend get out Dancing and shaking and most of all electric.
Lights on Lights off. Everyone hit the ground. she was beautiful like cancer.
She was beautiful but she helped you into the ground. Mayday Mayday
A heartshaped enemy never underestimate. Samson was impressed as well. I helped you carry all the dead folks that we knew but you fell in love. You fell asleep and strait into the ground she marches on one by one.
I open up the earth and let myself in. I bleed into the dirt all in all my friend I am giving in. Wake up She marches on one by one. she is the wind the setting sun. death in death love lost. They lost their voice in the choir. <start> The wind whispers your name
your eyes your face visible thru these black days
I was never the only one to think of you
And remember every look every word everything
Digging my nails into my palms feeling nothing but heat
With a heavy heart and a trace of guilt I accept this deceit
I can't forgive myself and I won't start with you
These are the words I live by
I will not attempt to to swallow betrayed
These are the words I live by
These are the words I wish my hands of all the past
Theres are the words I live by
I am buried alive your gift at deception
He left me hoping
Reacting choking gasping for unbreathable air
The essence of death
Permeates my senses <start> En el fuego arden mis sueos
Escondido entre las sombras estare
Ahogo tus recuerdos en llantos
Sientes que es tu amigo el que ves
No soy mensajero
Ni del odio ni del amor
No podre entender jamas la realidad
Y no me preocupa el mas all
Es mejor perderse lentamente
Hacia el final por t
En la calle te encontr y me acerque
Y tu corazon sangraba
Ya tu oscuridad es blanca
Has perdido en tu guerra sin luchar
Es mejor perderse lentamente
Hacia el final sin ti
Voy corriendo junto al viento y ganare
Cruzare mil rios no descansare
No soy algo sin sentido escuchame
Me desangro en esta vida por querer <start> Libera me Domine de morte aeterna in die illa tremenda
Quendo coeli movendi sunt et terra

Dies magna et amara valde

 <start> Somewhere in desert land
The valley of the graves
All you have to find there is
The gate within the cave
The garden of your darkest fears
A place of no return
You're bound to face your destiny
Fires of hope still burn
Arise God can't you hear my cry
I'm alive calling your mighty name
Save me from sadness
Whispers in the moonlight
I can hear their shadows crawl
Rising up from down below
The ghosts of Phantakor
Creatures of the underworld
They try to catch my soul
And try to seal my fate
A flight to the heart of the rainbow
I'm searching the eyes of the world
Deep in the land of the shadows
I'm awaiting the end of the game
The lord of Darkness is trying to poison my mind
Believe in your heart and you will see
It's not the place to die
Don't hestitate no time to wait
The days are passing by
Arise  God can't you hear my cry
I' m alive  calling your mighty name
I'm reaching for glory <start> A folk of cheeriness and strength
Content with the life they lived
Socalled barbarians yet with eyes cleered
For what they truly need and what damn not
Free and plain
Barbarians farmers and savages
Counted as ignorant and uncivil
But told to bow before the emperors throne
They were at least not venal
True and plain freedom  of this natures clan
True and plain pride  of this celtic clan
True and plain dignity  Tegernako <start> Grey painted clouds usher in
The dawn of a new day
Lighted a shade floating in sin
A shade that follows one way
Tidings echo through the streets
When minstrels prefer silence
An echo calling from the wharfs
Make the knights stop their feasts
Down by the riverside
Things have become clearer
The master
Of her dreams
Her pale white body wrapped in a web of tales
Laying in a hazy gleam
This beauty brought by 's lands many gales
Died in a chase
In a chase for a dream
And now she floated
Behind the walls of her desires
In a shallop where in life is shed
Her coffin ... <start> I'm dreaming of the lights coming from behind
The clouded's getting clearer it's closer all the time
Darker taller bigger all blackness under wing
Reaping holy profits from the fear of absolutely nothing
Bloodbath no one here will miss
The stench of your abyss
Bloodbath the blood is never yours
Whores your followers
I hear the people coming I hear them down the hall hell
They're banging at my door what do they got to sell
Everything moves slowly I feel trapped and powerless
My body weighs a thousand pounds and I cannot confess
The door is crashing open it's ripping from the wall
No matter what I do I seem to do nothing at all
The lights are getting brighter and they won't go away
The voice is getting louder and there's no need to pray
I think the world is stumbling I think I feel it shake
There's something in the room
But there's nothing left to break
The blackness getting bigger than the serpent's universe
Ruthless angels lie and steal and spread the catholic curse <start> You foolish mortals who live your life like sheep
in this meaningless world
you who live a normal life
following the laws of human greed.
Don't hope in a better future
nor in the progress of hallowed science
there's just one way that can get you high
you must search for it into the mist of time.
Burn with us in the eternal flame
You gotta fight against reactions
clench your fists but don't despair
destroy every link with your false doctrines
only this way you can have power.
Free yourself from false beliefs
in exchange you'll realize your wishes
the occult desires will calm your thirst
and you'll be acclaimed in a better world.
Come with us We're the Kings of Evil
We wanna fight for a new creation
Come with us In the Satanic Service
We wanna destroy to reconstruct <start> I'm chaos international
The writing on the wall
A Lazarus in parable
A dark and sullen lullaby
Whispered softly as you die
Promising torments are nigh
Danger warning levels hissed out loud
I saw the silver lining hidden in a mushroom cloud
Now I'm reeling from the shock at ground zero
If yesterday you would have stood up proud
Then why tonight have you thrown in with the stoning crowd
I'll breathe through the foetus of a new day kicking...
The foetus of a new day kicking
It's true that Jesus cannot save
I'm rising from the grave
To put my double cross to shame
A poison rush a heart attack
A white assassin painted black
You'll fear this reaper coming back
Danger warning levels hissed out loud
I saw the silver lining hidden in a mushroom cloud
Now I'm reeling from the shock at ground zero
If yesterday you would have stood up proud
Then why tonight have you thrown in with the stoning crowd
I'll breathe through the foetus of a new day kicking...
On a night like this
You laid the serpent's kiss
In this garden of Gethsemane
You played the traitor well...
In a dawn to come
I will blind the sun
To grant you pardon as my enemy
Before damning you to hell... <start> I crack your bones
I fuck your mind
I rip your soul to pieces
And burn your fucking eyes
The end is near my sweet sweet bride
Exploding anger is bursting inside
No remorse you will die
Filthy messed up my sick fucked up brain
Let me introduce you to pain
Let me introduce you to pain
I wreck your face and crush your skull
No sympathy for your cries
I used to hug and kiss you
Now i'm gonna rape and kill you
I like it when you scream you fucking bitch
You make my dreams come true
Receive my cascade of sick semen
I succeeded to love you in every way
Exploding anger is bursting inside
No remorse you will die
Filthy messed up my sick fucked up brain
Let me introduce you to pain
I crack your bones
I fuck your mind
I rip your soul to pieces
And burn your fucking eyes
The end is near my sweet sweet bride
Exploding anger is bursting inside
No remorse you will die
Filthy messed up my sick fucked up brain
Let me introduce you to pain
Let me introduce you to pain <start> Consume the resolve of wrath
In essence we will soar on great flame in the fall of the holy
Scratched out marks in blood
These grainy images in the chambers of perception
Inside the emptiness of this black vision
Agony within masturbations of the devil
The chatter of white noise is calling
Enter the loathing of tortured souls
With fear came thunder
Where the soil is red as blood
A voice of fire screams from the abyss
This book of the witch's hammer to provoke this raven deluge
Broken steps of the ladder in reversal of attainment
As locusts swarm from madness
Necromantic recollection of existence
Forty legions are cleansed in the imprecation of ancient tongues
Transmissions from the empire of evil spirits
Entity of dark faith to succumb to the murders of unlikely prayer
Great harbinger seduced from foreseen malediction
Outside perception of unleashed evil
Curious in the restraints of the blackness in hope
Raise the prodigy to ensnare with hateful thought
Future of slaved angels encased in ribcage tombs
Crawling in devout worship of starless contempt
Great one engulfed in forever dream
Releasing all the sorrows of mankind
Merciless in sleep of this ashen existence from soundness of death
Proclaim the attraction of this sinister treason
Conformed by the five Satans outside these chambers of reason
Defile the consciousness beneath this frame of pristine balance
Troubled ceremony in hopes to speak through the underworld
Teachings of horror induced in the overbearing of an ideal
Bloodless execution in the attributes of divinity
Within the hour of death spirits gather in dormant curse
Unrest in the expulsion of possessed as eyes are closed
Blackout this existence
In possession of the soul
Enter this nightmare <start> World


Ruchloser Mrder in purpurnen Seiten schwelgend
vergiee ich das vermaledeite Blut deines
kindlichen Leichnams
und erwarte mit bessener Hingabe
die erlsende Begierde meines vielgepriesenen Untergangs
Gewitter zieht auf und ich fhle wie de Trne
deren Dorn tief in den Pfuhl meiner Prophezeiung stt
Bare Vernichtung umweht meine lssigen Schenkel
die Mitte kann nicht lnger gehalten werden
und es bedarf nur zwei Schsse den Knig zu tten
Und wenn der Zirkel der Gehenkten spricht
und das verblichene Licht in schwarzem Weine sich bricht
wird die Bue des toten Pferdes
meiner harschen Dunkelheit anheim fallen

Shadows From The Alexander World


Profilgate assassin revelling in purple sides
I shed the cursed blood of your
childlike corpse
And await with possessed dedication
the redeeming desire of my much praised downfall
Thunder rises and I feel like the tear
whose thorn thrusts deep into the pool of my prophecy
Bare destruction blows round my slow thighs
The middle can no longer be kept
and it took only two shots to kill the king
And when the circle of the hanged ones speaks
and the faded light breaks in black wine
the penance of the dead horse will fall
share to my harsh darkness <start> I believe in my conscience
I obey that inner feeling
I get scarred emotions
When I try to find your inner heart
The rulers are no real kings
I believe in my instincts
Yeah I do... and I know it's true
That inner feeling
Don't ask me how I know the way
To your inner heart
Can't you hear me
I said rulers are no real kings
I search inside...
I though the true thoughts in my kingdom
were my own
I thought the throne was all mine
We share the light
When the sun beats down
On a Winter's day

I like the way that the sun shines down on us yeah
The rulers are no real kings
I believe <start> no lyrics <start> convulsing to your violent rhythm
twisting and turning en utero
i'm out of my body and swimming through you
a nightmarish dream like a maze
dream like a maze
dream like a maze
from the rolling hills of suicide
everyone will run and hide
screaming bloody murder
with their heads of fire
there just may be a chance for me
my sweet insanity
if you would take me with
you on your trip to the moon
disfigured faces in technicolor
like roses on the death bed of your dying mother
as the seasons grow in to the angriest people
sadistic and slightly deranged
everyone has changed
slightly deranged
from the rolling hills of suicide
everyone will run and hide
screaming bloody murder
with their heads of fire
there just may be a chance for me
my sweet insanity
if you would take me with
you on your trip to the moon
oh your wicked smile
oh your evil ways
won't convince me
the sky isn't falling down
my sweet insanity
look what we've become
the envy of everyone
inspired by your madness
like furious wind in a storm
slowly growing cold
i'm fallin in love with you
from the rolling hills of suicide
everyone will run and hide
screaming bloody murder
with their heads of fire
there just may be a chance for me
my sweet insanity
if you would take me with
you on your trip to the moon <start> Waiting by the sea
Living by highway robbery
Attacking families
With an army of twenty
Ambushing
Ambushing
Bringing forth
Second nature
Ambushing
Ambushing
Hunters bring back fresh kill
The clan goes in a frenzy
Others fight among themselves
For the biggest chunk
So many deeds
So many deeds
Our cave is full of human pieces
Let our children devour the victims
Inbred to live by medieval urges
Primal acts
Taught by cannibal elders
So many deeds
So many deeds
Ambushing
Ambushing
All members partaking
In human ingestion
Knew no other diet
No other way of life
No connection to the outside world
No connection to the outside world
Pieces here
Pieces here
Bring forth a second nature
The animalistic
Instincts
To survive
Waiting by the sea
Living by highway robbery
Attacking families
Now an army of fifty <start> First the climb
Become the status
Regained sight
Undercontrolled
On a directionless path
One should be
The quiet one who would not see
Resemblance in self
And all those spawned
All in the same
Suffering sadness
Incredible truth
Justice to this madness
Remember forget who you are
Negative and bored
And have given a little too much thought
Here today long gone yesterday
Saw a million zombies like me
Some of whom have entered the fray
A man with nothing to lose
Will kill quicker than a wolf
Will tear your flesh
And a man with all to gain
He will do the same
Now has easily passed the threshold
We bleed
Like the rest of you pigs
We breed
Fuck like the rest of you parasites
We plead
For an end
The need
For selfishness
We bleed
Ourselves instead
Tortured
Wondering whether
The process of thinking
Duplicates itself
Mirrored by maniacal malicious intentions
Carried out with ease
We bleed
A man with nothing to lose
Has struck swifter than a snake
Displays cold survival
And a man with all to gain
He has done the same
But has never crossed the threshold
Leap across the line
Teeter back and forth
On the brink
Decide which path
You take every hour <start> The desert in the blazing sun
I feel my throat is burning
The guard is incorruptable
You name it vanity or yearning  oh
Now  dusty wind into my face
We gotta build it higher and higher
Oh the sun is whipping from above
Your child in chains of desire
And craving towers
From the desert towards the sky
The grind of the genius
Who's raising his own decline
And the navigator is heading for hell
Setting off on a journey
And he'll never return
And the navigator he rose and he fell
In quest for heaven
He'll never return
Hey the seeker reaching for the stars
Beyond the scape of profanity
Oh and when he tried to touch the light
Fire burned his sanity away
Oh I gotta see it all
Tempting deities I hear them
But then when you follow their call
Pride goes before the fall
And the navigator... <start> fuck you too. dead. can you feel it when the blood runs out like it just did. white knuckles. can you feel it fuck you too. fuck you dead. i said it for the record. said it and i turned away. i can hear these words in my ear. one last time in my ear. fuck you dead. cold. can you feel it when the blood runs out of you. white knuckles can you feel it and fuck you too. fuck you dead. i said it for the record. said it and i turned away. i can hear these words in my ear. and i can see you when you when you hold it and it slips away. and i can feel it when you hold it and it slips away. it's over now. one last time. goodbye. <start> All kinds of people have all sorts of feelings about dying
Most view it with fear and trepidation but that's not the way for me oh no
On a day like no other
I welcome death I welcome the reapers icy embrace
His cold damp cloak as it scrapes against my skin
And because this day will come but once in your entire life
It should be a truly magnificent event
Something to be remembered for all eternity
You want people to gather you want people to lament
The severity of your final moments on this earth
For this is more than significant this event this is forever
When I die I wanna die violently
What could be more mundane than dying of old age
Or of natural causes when there's death by misadventure to be pursued
Any idiot can die but it takes someone truly special to go out
In what I'd call a spectacular kind of way
Ripped apart by sharks torn to bits by wolves
Tortured beyond the threshold of human tolerance
And don't fear the reaper when the game is over and your number is up
For death my friends yes death is inevitable
When I die I wanna die violently when I die I hope that I'll suffer
Burnt out and cut up and dealt out and fucked up
When I die I pray my exit's gonna be fucking bleak when I die I wanna be in pain
In a vicious and inhumane sorta way to the very hilt of human suffering
With fear and loathing racing through my veins <start> Pull The Plug X
I Drove My Truck Into A moving Van

Death is a forecourt to hell
Where the lost of humanity dwell
In the realm of the other side
I saw some spirits a force of might
Black and white and side by side
They will take me beyond the light
Repeat x
Death is a forecourt to hell
Where the lost of humanity dwell
Through the shadows of my soul
Walking in an endless cave
Searching for a deep black hole
To find my destiny or grave
Repeat x
Death is a forecourt to hell
Where the lost of humanity dwell
Doomed to hell
Misery and death pain and sorrow
The air was poisoned by the smell of burning flesh
I saw the beast
A great shadow surrounded by black demons
Satan he laughed as he saw me burn <start> Goat of departure on his back rides their shame
Antithesis of their ivory Christian chains
Fearful thee ovis their weakened hearts and minds
We are the satyrs of hedonistic kind
Less travelled is our path
Laid darkly to the left
Footprint of Mendes emblazoning our armored breast
Great bearded Capra who towers oe'er the land
A tribute to your magnificence the feared sign of the horns shows on our hands
Azazel the damned ibex
Swath of scarlet ties his neck
To the desert banished yet
Our curse lives on
Embrace the glory the goat
Worship the one who burns below
Heretic liberation of the soul
Dispel their false salvation as a whole
Misunderstood our lord
Preserver of the horde
Footprint of Mendes enchants our angel cleaving swords
O silvered Capra taught us to fear no man
In your honor we have gathered strength to rid their aging falsehoods from this land
We'll fight their kingdom high
The burdened scapegoat cast aside
Like he has we shall too survive
Melding our powers undenied
Order of Ebon we are his righteous blade
Reich of satanic rule the iron might of Baphomet
Bringers of chaos we are an antichrist
Swing spiked morning stars to crush his kingdom our delight
Danse ye now unto to the satyrs' lyre
Spring heeled devotion to hell's eternal fires
Instinctively to follow thine desire
We should ashamed not be preservation of the will is key
Embrace the glory the goat
Worship the one who burns below
Heretic liberation of the soul
Dispel their false salvation as a whole
We'll fight their kingdom high
As the burdened scapegoat cast aside
Like he has we shall too survive
Melding our powers undenied <start> originally by Killing Joke
Man watching video
The bomb keeps on ticking
He doesn't know why
He's just cattle for slaughter
The requiem
When the meaningful words
When they cease to function
When there's nothing to say
When will they start plotting against you
The requiem
Only a hint of religion
Uncensors to its false depravity
The sound of breaking glass
This is a reflection
The requiem <start> Jim Fear has done it again
Alfresco slapsticked
Foam mouth sunshine
Slash her and bash her porno freak
Throw another crap cake on the stove Jimmy
The flaming hermit
The lonely fool
A staged and natural bliss
So flip the page
And lock your door
Or have you finished
Have you finished <start> Frozen streams and vapours gray
cold and waste the landscape lay...
Then a hale of wind.
HitherWhirling ThitherSwilrling
Spinn the fog and spinn the mist...
Still we walked on through woods and wintry gray
home through woods where winter lay  Cold and dark...

Through the woods. Home through the woods where winter lay... <start> This journey without movement
Heading out for no man's land
The way ahead my only ally
Early hours in the silence
This credence keeps me upright
Through the storms and disasters
A straight line towards the unknown end
Deceit waits on the back roads
This unwavering inner
Keeps fear a welcomed pointer
I uprooted now the fertile soil
As plot and shadows thicken
This juggernaut cannot be stopped
On any scale or planet
Ghostly tracks in my wake and ahead
An experience cannot be shared
Wheels of time
Keep them turning
Carriage of concepts
Wheels of time turn
Circling the planes
Wheels of time
Keep them turning
Carriage of concepts
Wheels of time turn
Circling the planes
Lightless voyage blinding speeds
Certain I'll stay the distance
Abstract shapes enigmatic design
I know enough to endure
Lightless corridors ageless
Familiar alien
Contradictory engines run high
Deeper and further above
Journey of no promises
Beyond the lust for rewards
Focus on the movement of the wheel
Union of stillness and change
Journey of the ages all
I'll follow outside the edge
Breath blood sacrifice bleeding eyes
Unending journey ahead
Wheels of time
Keep them turning
Carriage of concepts
Wheels of time turn
Circling the planes <start> They've tried to do submissive servants
They've just succeed in doing fanatics
They've tried to do soulless killers
They've just succeed in reviving fire
God isn't better than the others
Adjust yourself and think to survive
World is cruel I'm the world
Watch out for me I'm the Devil
To eat before to be...
World is cruel I'm the world
Watch out for me my ace is hate
I'll kill you because you are...
You're dead but something's missing
My soul purged from all beliefs
I can't feel regrets or remorse
Purged from all feelings
I can't feel pity or compassion...
I don't need to prove my views
I don't care about critics I don't care about critics
I live and follow one's destiny
You believe I'm just a fanatic
and think that I'm sure to be immortal
Leave your dreams and follow my thoughts
Believe me I'm fighting to win the right to die
The right to never begin again
Believe me believe me it's just to win the right to die
Believe me believe me it's just to win the right to die
God isn't better than the others
Adjust yourself and think to survive
World is cruel and the devils lay down the law
and when you'll know their true face you shall be ready to fight them with
us... <start> Cold waves
Of the foaming flood
Over the lowland
Of gray soil
The flowin' like an impulse
From hearth to the brain
Impulse of salvation
When I was dying
Driving the darkness away
Closing the eyes
Tryin' to escape
From the finality
Buyin' moments
Without the haggle
Changin' soul into the matter
To sell it for the breath
tell me how did it happen
When I was touchin' your thoughts
when I was tryin' to tell
tell what I'm afraid of
How did it happen...
Sentenced for the blaze in a fog
Laugh's chokin' the throat
Laugh empty as the streets
During a dusk
To find onself
In the middle of huge ocean of world
Walkin' the dirty'n'grey pavement
In the silence of solitude
In the clatter of the city
To stay with face wet of rain
with longing for the dreams that passed
Feelin' the joy of the empty moment
Stuck in my memory
Then start to go again
With raised head
In to the whirl of life
So impenetrable. <start> Balled up  enter the pain
Fists of fury  the deafening blows
Ridiculed by drunken rage
Unleashing the beast within
Repeated sickness  pray in vain  to be denied
Mental scars that never heal  in quiet misery
Huddled in darkness  a wideeyed nightmare
Together  maintain a sense of sanity
To speak the truth  intensified hatred
The mind takes you to a better place
Repeated sickness  pray in vain  to be denied
Mental scars that never heal  in quiet misery
My god  what is this pain Why must I feel so alone
What makes him release all this pain A family torn to shreds
Secretly unified  in hatred and vengeance 
For years of torment and misery
Now I live for the day  for us to see eye to eye
You stand before me and then you die  for mental scars never heal
Solo
Horrified coward  forgotten my face
Intensifying  my chance to repay
Praying to god you now scream MY name
Vengeance is mine the last breath you take
Repeated sickness  pray in vain  to be denied
Mental scars that never heal  in quiet misery <start> music furni 
lyrics dave rotten
worthless drunk loser
withdrawn on his own misery
hater of mankind
despised any help to his suffering
neglected by society
left apart by his own family
he even enjoys his state
eating shit and sleeping on the streets
prechorus
now he feels that he's totally free
to unleash his own perversity
and be what he wished to be
a despicable human being
chorus
uncontrollable homeless necrophile
aggressive homeless necrophile
abominable homeless necrophile
psychopath homeless necrophile
creating his own living rules
nobody's gonna tell him what to do
no room for conscience or morality
only the strongest will survive
always struggling with other homeless
for no reason
with a knife in his pocket waiting for revenge
but once he tasted the power of killing he couldn't resist
then he felt he had to kill and kill and kill
a simple argument
was enough to slay any man
and when the victim was a she
then he had to free his sexuality
necrophilia was
his fave act of brutality
a cold and frigid corpse
no screams no face and obedience
prechorus
now he feels that he's totally free
to unleash his own perversity
and be what he wished to be
a despicable human being
chorus
uncontrollable homeless necrophile
aggressive homeless necrophile
abominable homeless necrophile
psychopath homeless necrophile <start> I seek for You take my leave so fare You well
I lost all hopes truth may come to light and die
And for my love I pray You wrong me not
Let us all ring fancy's bell ding dong bell
Such as I am now for myself alone
My eyes still look look as swift as Yours
I pray You cure my mind that's drenched with blood
A dancing heart but not for joy
No power in the tongue of man
My deeds upon my head crushing
head crushing madGod sort it all
You shall deem Yourself loaged in my heart
Sick is my head let it bleed desire to die
I will lend You sorrow borrow none
I never serve Your mind I say no way
Remember You were mine
'cause You obeyed my wine
My favour stopped to bleed
over now my greed
And You will come I never serve Your mind
And You will come and leave Your world behind
I fly away by night to higher steps of might
The thorns You stand upon they never will pass on <start> A young child when sodomized
Will shut down all systems
A young infant who is sodomized
Immediately goes to sleep <start> Ease your mind with you simple life.
Don't tell me that you could never do this.
It's plain to see the truth is you don't care.
Your words fade your actions speak for themselves.
In the end we both know you've done nothing at all.
All your excuses excuses I defy.
Do you think that you're part of this
Do you think that you've saved at all
Actions speak for themselves.
You've done nothing at all.
Sacrifice yourself. <start> Everything will not be made right
Everything will not be made right
It's childish I know
Pretend the world is listening
Ignore the sound for now
I just heard God give in
There's much to be left over
When we're swallowed by the end
The cockroaches and Darwin
Had a deal <start> Dead end and no way back
Walls came crashing down on me
Whatever I try whatever I do
My mind will go insane
Change is the headline and I am reborn
And all the crying all the mourning is gone
I woke up with a new view of life
I don't know what has happened to the past
Chorus
Life life is too short to think all through
Life life is too short to waste it all
So listen to your heart
And help your dreams to come true
Life is too short
Too many dreams kept in the dark
Too many dreams kept in the dark
Too many wishes are blown away for nothing
A new time a new chance I am a rising star
I am back I will fight I will love again
I woke up with a new view of life
I don't know what has happened to the past
Chorus
Life is too short <start> Straight edge  the discipline.
The key to selfliberation is abstinence from the destructive escapism of
intoxication. I separate from the poison  a mindlessness
I've always abhored. Usage will only increase the pain a truth I
constantly see ignored. The pollutants that kill the body breed
apathy within the mind. The substances that once brought
release in the end will always confine.
From drugclouded lungs and veins motviation dissipates.
Imprisoned within addiction
abuse increases until death overtakes.
Enslaved by concupiscence promiscuity leads to despair.
Victims used and abandoned by
liars who professed to care. Selfexiled from their insanity.
Striving to attain higher levels of purity. The beauty in life
is mine to know. Amidst the ruin I survive. I've got to stay free.
Damage everywhere  infections at every turn. Through my
refusal to partake I saved myself. Abstinence was the beginning.
What's important is what's done with the freedom step by
step I overcome. Alone I climb the staircase to edification.
Deliverance From birth an existence of agony begins that ends
with execution. Intentionally infected with diseases
to then try to find cures for humans. Fractured skulls broken bones
scalded flesh and blinded eyes.
For medical research and cosmetic testing animals suffer and die.
Walls conceal the tortured
victims of vivisection. Nothing of value can be gained
for science or medicine when the price is a helpless animal's life.
An animal becomes a subject  their pain a mere reaction.
Harmless testing alternatives ignored  they refuse to end their
profit system. The suffering benefits mankind  the excuse
for demented scientists whose brutalization of the innocent
denegrates humanity's existance. When education
and peaceful protest can't bring their liberation the strategy for their
rescue changes into militant intervention.
Every action has an impact. Every life saved is a victory.
The truth known by the
caring few who wage guerilla warfare to end this atrocity.
Severed locks doors wrenched from hinges the animals deliverance
from torment and captivity. Vivisectionists dragged
into the street and shot as flames engulf the laboratory. Justice's
hammer falls again and again until it ends
when the price is a helpless animal's life. <start> Fostered my fears for years I've disappeared within
Reflecting what could've been I'd kill myself to start again
What's left for them A dirty box with room to breath
And I'll keep you there I'll keep you there to never leave but
You would never understand it
You took my love for granted nothing turned out like we planned it
Now my disguise more than what you see with your eyes
My disguise more than what you see with your eyes
And we try to hide ourselves breath in the lies
And we try
And we try to hide ourselves breath in the lies
And we try
I taste the shell and tell you wear a candy coat engulfing
You in my throat line me with the love letters that you wrote
My antidote a lover's quote in pheromone
You're deep inside but deep inside I'm all alone but
You would never understand it
You took my love for granted nothing turned out like we planned it
Now my disguise more than what you see with your eyes
My disguise more than what you see with your eyes
And we try to hide ourselves breath in the lies
And we try
And we try to hide ourselves breath in the lies
And we try
Yes all a part of a part of you
And we try to hide ourselves breath in the lies
And we try
And we try to hide ourselves breath in the lies
And we try
We try to hide ourselves breath in the lies
We try
And we try to hide ourselves breath in the lies
And we try <start> The crucifix in flames
The house of God burned down to the ground
A symbolic action of defiance
Brought palace of lies down
Refusal to acknowledge the authority
Of faith of liars
Has cleansed this world somewhat
By purifying lovely fire
Crosstitution
Crosstitution
Crosstitution
Holy writtings hokus pokus
Magic incense blood and tears
Impeccable the ways of Heaven
To inflict terror and fear
All are born of woman
And the female is of sin
So we are all drenched soaky wet in sin
When our life begins
And for the rest of our days
To reach his kingdom full of bliss
We seek forgiveness
For something we didn't do
To someone who does not and never has
And never will exist
Crosstitution
Crosstitution
Crosstitution
Cross of lies no one up high
Gayhood of priests and spartan fiests
Pathetic faith your wine and bread
All will be well once we're all dead
He might have died for
Somebody's sins but sure not mine
If all you want is to him follow
And die too then I say fine
But don't you baptise one more
Generation in some fuckin' shame
Supported by that damned religion
Of yours I now watch in flames
Crosstitution
Crosstitution
Crosstitution
I will always defy your damn faith
As I've lived I'll die free
You'll never have me crosstitute myself
Or on my fuckin' knees <start> Digital eyes
Scanning your lives
Through the walls

Watching your moves
No place to hide

You're detected

A cruel device
Merciless

Control
Big brother watching you
Control <start> I've been up for nights and days
And my eyes remain wide awake
Because more than my life's at steak
So I ain't got time for blinkin'
All the time I'm thinkin'
If this ain't hell it's one fiery place
Metallic projectiles fly in ya face
And leave you like human garbage lyin' in drains
I've gotta keep my eyeballs open
The only thing that'll minus the pain like ibuprofen is
milli and K on the case
I don't feel in control like pilots in planes
I'm trapped in this winding maze
I'm an insomniac I'm insane
I've been up for days and nights
Through this crazy life
But I'll sleep when I'm dead
Until they pay me right
My eyes are open wide
But I'll sleep when I'm dead
When everything on my to do list is ticked off
Then maybe I can drift off
Until then I'm wide awake lyin' in a daze
My eyeballs gaze
Hypnotized by the sound of my wrist watch
Clickin' tick tock
I'm in charge of the underground just like Brick Top
So I can't sleep I'd be wrong if I did stop
If I'm focused on writing a verse
You couldn't put me to sleep
With a thousand and nine
Bottles of night nurse
It's likely I'll put ya lights out first
So I'll sleep when I'm restin' in peace
Until then I've gotta bless these beats
Till I conquer the streets
If I'm conscious I can't get lost in a dream
I've been up for days and nights
Through this crazy life
But I'll sleep when I'm dead
Until they pay me right
My eyes are open wide
But I'll sleep when I'm dead
If you're drowsy remain in a slumber
My metaphors flow over ya head
Like a button less jumper
I can't sleep till I'm in the sky
Like lightning and thunder
Sometimes at night I wonder
Is pursuein' this dream a blunder
Or the best thing that I ever did
I can't sleep or slip till I'm  feet under
Hence the song I'll sleep when I'm dead
You might only need money to survive
But my life relies on a needle instead
I wanna eat steak meals everyday
I'm sick and tired of livin' on a diet
Of beans and bread
So believe what I said
I'll sleep when I'm where
I'll sleep when I'm what
I'll sleep when I'm dead
I've been up for days and nights
Through this crazy life
But I'll sleep when I'm dead
Until they pay me right
My eyes are open wide
But I'll sleep when I'm dead
I've been up for days and nights
Through this crazy life
But I'll sleep when I'm dead
Until they pay me right
My eyes are open wide
But I'll sleep when I'm dead <start> 
On the sand by the sea
I left my heart to shed my grief
A vulture came begging me
 Feed me with this piece of meat
I won't give away
Something I need
On a garden nursery
I let my fancy wander free
Children playing around a tree
Sharing apples happily
Come and rest with me
Lay your hands on dreams
I'll wait here by your side
'till you fall asleep
I'll wait until you cry
All over me the tears you hide inside... <start> M  L Thomas Eriksson
You thought you knew what I was all about
A smile on your face but you're drowning in lies
You stole my heaven and put me through hell
One of us must go down Well I'm not the one

They try to push me over the edge
But you know in the end they failed
I'll live my life until it's over

You have not lived the life I've lived
Your words couldn't mean a thing

I'm burying angels under my feet
And I can't explain why love
Has to stamp he ground
Is it so that our broken hearts
Will never make another sound
So we cry while the baby screams smile
We hide while the tyrants breath light
And the wheels within the wheels roll by
Silence me again
Keep me at bay from words
That I've said these are the days
When mars is closer than the sun
So we cry while the baby screams smile
We hide while the tyrants breathe light
And the wheels within the wheels roll by
Bye bye
I'll paint the sand <start> Open your eyes what have you done
I've been back forth stuck yet spun
Too keyed to lie still too tired to run
I can't believe it's come to this
It's safe to say that ignorance is bliss
Bittersweet goodbye and one last kiss
Forever is a long time that I won't miss
Too tired to run it's getting late
Make up your mind
I was never your kind
This is gonna hurt me black 'n' blue
But don't you think that no one measures up to you
I cant believe it's come to this
It's safe to say that ignorance is bliss
Bittersweet goodbye and one last kiss
Forever is a long time I won't miss
Feel the hate we're breeding
Fear the lives we're leading
Cry while you watch me bleeding
The blood I have been spilling
Love we keep on killing
Was supposed to be for something
Guess it was all for nothing
I cant believe it's come to this
It's safe to say ignorance is bliss
Bittersweet goodbye and one last kiss
Do you feel the hate we're breeding
Fear the lives we're leading
Cry while you watch me bleeding
Cry while you watch me bleeding <start> By sharing what's divine
You don't become an angel
The devil's got many faces
All looking into mine
A man among the beasts
A sheep among the wolves
How could there be light
When darkness never sleeps
As long as there is man
There must be a devil
In femalelooking form
To lead them in temptation
From the first sin done by Eve
To the last and nameless night
How could there be hope
When darkness never sleeps
One man stands another falls <start> I'm calling you to me
Hear my words in yout mind
Hear me speak without tunes
From the endless worlds of fire
I have found you
I'm now the tormentor of your soul
Wherever you may hide
I will turn light for you to darkness
Ancient spirits
Created by evil
Follow my voice
I can see destruction from a different side now
When the demons have drowned my mind
You can't hide in the darkness
If you don't belong to it <start> how could this be all that was held true now is burned under suns of madness ruins of the beautiful structures graves of the fallen angels the angels that sang your name i am burning my memories they are too painful i am burning my memories for they are killing me like a blackened earth barren and desolate so i find absence in harsh words why can't i rmember it as a moment of trust when the words that redeem strike me with former thoughts i relax my soul fire in the earth and in my heart the relative circles and the intertwined majesty the only way to enlightenment was through pain a birthing ground for disaster when the words that redeem strike me i know it can only be a dream i felt her will to be reborn and daybreak destroyed me wishing away the deeds of the pasts throughout tiimes in the earth maybe an end will erupt from the earth and swallow us all let the eruption take place i want all of it to burn to prove my dedication i will prove myself worthy screaming for closing worlds to burn it was always deep inside now it has died <start> You've been targeted in the night
by violent mercenaries.
Your identity's been confused
with one that looks like you
You're a simple man living life.
You are an electrician.
But there's a bounty on your head
A billion unmarked travelers checks.
RUN
Find your way deep into the woods.
The dogs can smell your path.
Try to find a way out of this.
There seems to be no chance.
Bounty hunters closer to you.
Start to remember back.
When you studied biology
back in your high school class.
Wait now what did they say
about the human body and proportions of things
Blood is an energy conductor.
I am full of that all I need is an outlet.
They're getting closer
but now you have a plan.
Lead them to the generator
where there's solid land.
The concrete floor will do just fine
and electric outlets.
Open up your veins and splash the blood
and hit the power lines.
Bloodrocuted
Bloodrocuted
You'll be bloodrocuted
You'll be bloodrocuted
You'll be bloodrocuted right now
Enemies stand dead in your blood.
The smell of cooking skin.
All of them with their hair on end
Their eyes exploded in.
You stand with your arms bleeding still
You cannot stop the flow.
Though you are the victor tonight
your time has come to go.
go go go go go go
Your time has come to go
go go go go go go
Your time has come to go
Wait now what did they say
about the human body and proportions of things
Blood is an energy conductor.
I am full of that all I need is an outlet.
Bloodrocuted <start> Going to school she learned to read and write
So much is new and life's full of wrong and right
Homework is done life has just begun
Hello world here's daddy's girl
Waking up early morning living in her own place
Taking a shower staring in the mirror at a tired face
Something for breakfast doing her face
Feeding her pet just like every other day
Still she isn't knowing when she's locking the door and going to her work
That in the morning next day she won't sleep alone
Later on in the evening she'll be riding on a feeling
Still she's somehow gonna be needing just a beer more or two
Daddy's girl here's daddy's little girl
Daddy's girl here's daddy's little girl
Party and music feels like this night could last a lifetime
Ain't gonna lose this feeling tonight she'll leave it all behind
A kiss and a hug from one of those guys
But she leaves with another in a cab in the night
Unlocking the door she's weary she can feel his heavy breathin'
Not too sure if she's still playin' a game or if she really feels like screwing
Is this really loving she is feeling really nothing
Still she is letting him proceed with whatever that is he is doing
Daddy's girl...
A kiss and a hug from one of those guys
But she leaves with another in a cab in the night
Who thinks of protection or the choice of rejection
When he is just about all done and her head is dizzy from all the free beers
Daddy's girl... <start> I see it now
I feel it now

Vengeance is a friend of mine
Fear is the key
Panic and disorder
Contaminant this world
Throw back the silence
Ignite the fear x
Blinded deprivation
Tainted fear

You've got the virus
The virus of contempt
Fading 
You define
The void
The kind of reason
I see it now
I feel it now

Throw back the hate
Get this get this get this infatuation
You waste away you waste away
Throw back the silence

Get this get this get this infatuation <start> So I Assume This Could Be Freedom From Me To You
And With Such A Distorted View Upon Life And What We Do
Your Ways To Persuade Me Into What My Memory Is Forced To Shade
I Loathe What You Made Of Me Bullet Blind Eventually
All Those Aching Hours With Abusive Powers
Whispered Your Name Through It All Now We're Stuck With That's Left To Save
But Out Of All I Entitled You My Favourite Scar
I'll Keep It Forever Closed Keep It Forever Sealed Keep It Forever Closed
So What If I Wake Up To The Sound Of Another Illusion Break
Smashed Now It's Yours To Keep Close To Whatever You Call Your Needs
Now When I've Seen You Fall I Can Finally Start To Recall
Sights Of A Past Unclear And Learn What I Should Hold Dear
All Those Aching Hours With Abusive Powers
Whispered Your Name Through It All Now We're Stuck With That's Left To Save
But Out Of All I Entitled You My Favourite Scar
I'll Keep It Forever Closed Keep It Forever Sealed Keep It Forever Closed So That No One Will Know <start> Hey fool where from are you comin' 
I can assure you you got nothing to do here
On you soft little face
Hey fool you got any business 
I can assure you here's no business for you
You can only lose your head
You can only get heated
O.K fool so you want to play
But are your prepared to take the risk 
I Don't think that you will leave rich
I Don't think that you will leave healthy 
Chorus <start> Music Finn Zierler
Words Finn Zierler  Jorn Lande
I bid you welcome
To my shadowland
I'm coming soon
And the moon is full I am the prince of night
Please do come in
I am the last of my kind
The last in line Heavy load
Down the winding road
Heavy load here
Come and show
The way to paradise
Let me know now Fell the fire strong desire
Something's waiting there for me
Deep inside I have a feeling
This was meant to be
Drifting on a river blue
I'll sail my ship forever
Let me live the dream I carry
Don't wake me from my sleep Living ain't easy
When there is no release
So many hearts been broken
Too many shattered dreams
It's hard building bridges
In this shadowland
I've been rising from the fall
When it was too much to bear Heavy load
Down the winding road
Heavy load here
Come and show
The way to paradise
Let me know now
Why Fell the fire strong desire
Something's waiting there for me
Deep inside I have a feeling
This was meant to be
Drifting on a river blue
I'll sail my ship forever
Let me live the dream I carry
Don't wake me from my sleep <start> Keep listening as I speak
There will be one true reckoning
We're gathering as we prevail
So I will sail before we fail
As the world keeps spinning around
We're trying to grab a piece of ground
I simply can't complete any sort of feat aside from breathing.
Increase in temperature is the fault of all we suffocate ourselves
We are only breathing
There are so many ways to rearrange there are so many reasons that life must change
Look to the children who have no home
Look to the children what have they done
We paved the roads of destruction what have we done
We paved the roads of destruction we've let them down
What are we waiting for
Never again will we see the worlds dreams.
They're all dying.
We are the visitors here and the air is failing.
There is no world to punish we destroyed it all. <start> I'm watching the mountains
So high in their prime
Like all of our brothers
Defenders of time
I stand by the river
So innocent divine
Thinking there are no heroes
Only vengeance and crimes
Can't we see we are
Can't we feel we are
Can't we try all as one
Bonded flesh bonded blood
bonded life in one sound
There will be no more heroes
Only a violent sky
There will be no more sinners
You could ask yourself why
No heroes no sinners No heroes
Among killing fields
No values no names
Is there peace in the twilight
Is there an end to theses games
Can't we see we are
Can't we feel we are
Can't we try all as one
Bonded flesh bonded blood
bonded life in one sound
There will be no more heroes
Only a violent sky
There will be no more sinners
You could ask yourself why
Will we ever change
What do you want in exchange
Will we ever change
No heroes  no sinners No heroes  No <start> Leave me rot upon the bloody stairwell of blackness
from a lake of purity now in the form of a black dead dove
molten souls petrified to igneous
with incomprehensible sadism <start> The devils in the daughters room
There will be no second knife
She reached for a dream
And he smiled as he watched her.
She was ever so beautiful in her sleep.
Like father  her eyelids gently closed.
Lids concealing her dreams.
He stood over her bed
One deep stab kill the hourglass
Let the sand leak slowly from its body
Draw out the time until its breathes its lastpilling
 <start> I stand alone now
In this ruined world
Desolation was caused
By futile wars
For those who fought
Are all dead and gone
Though constant battle
Has made me so very strong
As I take a look around
At this dying earth
There is nothing left for me
So what must occur
Dark revelations
Embrace my tortured mind
The solar journey
Is the only path I find
The time has come to leave this place
Drift alone in deep space
Journey towards the burning sun
Back to where it all begun
I board my vessel
And head for the stars
Through this cosmic trail
I will travel so far
Enjoy the serenity
Here alone in space
This solar journey will
Take me back in time
To defy the ways of God
And all mankind
Returning to the ways
Of everlasting pain
Where chaos is the law
And blood falls like rain
Now approaching the sun
It's burning my skin
Blistering flesh appears
Final descent into the flames
Finally the end is here
I couldn't imagine
That the pain I will feel
Is worse than before
Exploding within
This journey complete
As I pierce through the core
There in front of me is my destiny
To invade the world
Of the holy trinity
To bring it down is my master plan
As the war begins I make my final stand
The time has come to burn this place
Annihilate the human race
Showing them that I am the way
The world never thought
It would see the day
Now that I come to this journey's end
My mission is completed with their death
Returning to a place that I call home
To suffer forever all alone <start> music Jivarp Henriksson
Wrestled on its back
the ego showed his face
charged up recieving
came out knowing it all
Hopeless intrusion
where nothing can be found
strewn the seeds were wasted
on the innocent in awe
fruitless connection
in the ripeness of his age
drawn and thrust in anger
the dagger once again will fail
The ego drama unfolds
hopeless intrusion
where nothing can be found
strewn the seeds were wasted
on the innocent in awe
it's over it's over
if nothing comes along
it's over it's over for you
So in denial stand where shame is not
and unto others fall
the blame the guilt
the others fault
come on now
scratch and claw give it with all your strength
take on the wildest bull in the horde
come burn them fingers fast
and take back what they owe
return the safety where there was none
Hopeless intrusion
where nothing can be found
strewn the seeds were wasted
on the innocent in awe
fruitless connection
in the ripeness of his age
drawn and thrust in anger
he dagger once again will fail <start> You've created me for serving you
I'm the fruit of your hate the flaw of your soul
I'm living thanks your stupidity
You've created me I'll destroy you.
Damned of live banished of death
I'm the nightmare I'm the hate
I'm violence I'm baseness
I'm the master you're slaves.
One day you'll listen to me too
Then I'm the one who sleeps in you
The one who scoffs at your faith
I'm the calvary of this world
A plague for humanity
And nobody can mean me harm
Then I'm the evil <start> If I couldn't see before
I see quite clearly now
This world opens up to me
Wretched and insincere
Further regressing
Into the arms of the delusional
Traditions religions
Of perpetual mendacity
In deference to
A nonexistent God
Souls hesitant and full of fear
A death culture
Dead culture
Sacrament of holy orders
Of infamous artifice
The testament of man
Meeting his monsters
Should we choose to listen
Should we choose to see
Adding clarity and focus
Of what you are
What you want to be
The subtle distinction
Between human and inhuman
And if couldn't see before
I see quite clearly now
I see quite clearly now
Should we choose to listen
Should we choose to see <start> Verse 
Yes I'm just watching my step
Trying not to upset you
And I'm just being careful
With everything that I say and do
I don't wanna do anything if it's not approved
Cause you're my gold and my mission
My every intention is you...
Chorus
So what I'm gonna do is do
What I gotta do to please you
If it means giving all myself
I gotta do just to get next to you
I gotta do...
You know I need to be
Want to be
Gotta be
Closer to you
Is this what I need to do
I don't know how can I ever say
That I'll please you
Oh lord it's not about me no more
I need to be
Want to be
Gotta be
Closer to you

I don't know exactly what
You would do if you were in my shoes
I'm gonna be closer to you
Hmm hmmm closer to you...
Ooh ooh
Hmm hmmm closer to you...
Verse 
As I inch my way
Closer to your will I can't wait

It seems the closer I get
Father you seem so far away

But I will keep pressing cause I have to
Crawling cause I want you
Reaching cause I need you

I'm not ever gonna stop cause I love you

And if I had to
I couldn't find nobody to replace you
Chorus
Bridge
Lord I can't go anywhere if you're not there
Lord I can't speak a word if I don't hear you clear
I'm just saying
Lord I want be close to thee
Every hour every day I need thee
So draw me near near to you
I gotta be
Close to thee
Closer than most
Cause I need you closer than close
Cause I need to feel you breathe on me
Lord breathe...
Chorus <start> instrumental <start> X marks this day in the darkness but within its view
The blood from my boot lace garotte comes clean in a gutter wash
Middle aged wretched whore
Faceless nameless penniless
Lying down rictus twisted
Extinguished from a long misery
Sleep comes easy this night
As a gear in life shifts
They will emerge from the metal caves
Punishment's mystery revealed
The day of XX waiting they come not
Choose they to ignore Or does it not know
Fear turns to anger... Turns to hate
Revolution Decimation
Something is furious... It's in us... It fears us
Feeling the blood oh the blood
A useless nameless old man's blood
As he drops I stand waiting they do not come
Like a stone does it not see It makes me hate it even more
XXX the will to kill reality the final decamp
Winds of variance Rising force blood lust for invincibility
A garotte turned to a poniard and now a gun
Revolution Decimation <start> Long ago when witches would rule
Deadly women  ready to curse
Black potion of murder and disease
Forgive them for they're blessed...

Burn Burn at the Stake
Pain pain until you break
Sixteenth century souls born without sins
Infested by the seeds of the Demon God
Execution day by the knife and sword
Burned alive while crying for death to stop
Burn Burn at the Stake
Pain pain until you break

Rotting skin collected by the cross
Innocent victims caught in a web of law
Dying for a crime they did not commit
Cries of evil women  in the dark of the night
Burn Burn at the Stake
Pain pain until you break <start> One two three four 
Come on baby
Keep it down
Honey hush your lips
Clothes trailing
From the backdoor
To the bedroom
And I don't even know your name
Give me all you've got
Make this night worth my time
Make this worth my time 
What I would give to live this night again
I knew when I first saw you
You'd fuck like a whore
You'd fuck like a whore
I can hear you screaming for more 
Your thighs were made for cheeks to graze
My lips your poison
They bring you to your knees
Your thighs were made for cheeks to graze
My lips your poison
They bring you to your knees
Ah come on
Girl get down
It's almost over
Take it all the way
Oh
You stupid fucking whore
And after all of all my dreaming being only you
You're standing there baby oh
The things that I could do
Back to the wall with a drink in my hand
Back it up baby ride ride ride
One step too late
And I never told you
That I can't take
Another disappointment
Breathing and grasping all leads to another messy ending
Breathing and grasping all leads to another messy ending
Ten inch
With your back against the wall
With your face buried in the pillow
I see you cold
I feel you heartless
Bitch
You stupid fucking bitch
You stupid fucking bitch
Fucking bitch <start> Bury the knife deep within my chest and with one last kiss goodbye I'll shut my eyes for a final time. Whether or not I found this falling I will carry the strength of the dead and be buried by the fear of these thoughts. And just like those pictures I am melting through your hands. These demons dividing they burned out our one sun and I cower beneath it all. I'll find them overhead. Death from above. <start> Instrumental <start> Conform it's only need
Distort not what it seems
Resort to the deed
Report to the machine
Modern day vendor that sells you hell
A line is formed will you live to tell
Money machine become all one
Hand to hand the damage done
Conform no not alone
Distort what's always shown
Resort the need again
Report the machine again
Was it over when it started
Has the warmth since departed
Did you put your life on hold
On the shelf while firing the load <start> I am your  walls black
Light hits you eyes charge goes crack
I am your  walls black
Truth will now know
Where my cock will go
I am your  walls black
Still you lie You lie
Your pact is high
Your taste is high
I am your  walls black <start> There comes a night
When you will hear her cry
The Banshees song
Then you will know is time
Time to go
To where you have been before
Then you will come
Welcome home...
You know me Oh yes you know me
Every night i have been there with you
Time changes but the dreams remain
In the dreams i come to you
...but there comes a time
Yes there comes a time...
I am waiting. Oh yes. I am waiting
In another world another reality
Sing your song. Oh banshee sing
Summerland wails and there i will be <start> No justice found beneath
The blackened clouds of war
Attack in the darkness
No peace before the dawn
Killer instinct sadistic tendency
Aggression breeding hatred kill all enemies
Power surge eliminates remorse for mankind
Hopelessness domination freezes in the mind
Dormant hatred lies in state
Hands of death await your fate
Concession of pain taste for power
Life awaits its final hour
Lost in conscience strange mess of thoughts
Privilege of pain gained the power sought
Mass enforcement total control
Captives of command fallen to our hold
Dark torment of the fear inside
Domination takes away your pride
Dormant hatred lies in state
Hands of death await your fate
Concession of pain taste for power
Life awaits its final hour
No justice found beneath
The blackened clouds of war
Attack in the darkness
No peace before the dawn
No peace before the dawn <start> Game over
Game over
You win
Game over

The Sleigh bells are aringing the children they are singing
The memories are fleeting a little game of 
Game over

You win
Game over
I win.

The wedding bells are ringing the shotgun is asinging
Now keep your fingers steady a little game of Paper Scissors Rock
A lion tamer yelling your first piano lesson
A leaf contraceptive we play a game of

A sweaty palm reading a lucky shot of whiskey
Now come and rub my belly a little game of

X's and O's
Bloody TicTacToe





Not in your song
I'm not your singer

Are you rooting for
We're Hollywood Squares
We're going nowhere

Going nowhere

You're an 'O'
This is the end
The end. <start> Where Cold Wings Blow I  laid to Rest
I Can not reach my Rusty Weapons
The Blood and Sword that Guided my Path
For they Drowned in the Sands of Wisdom
I was indeed a King of the Flesh
My Blackened Edges still they were Sharp
Honoured by the Carnal Herds
But asketh thou Closed are the Gates
My Mind cut my Winged Weapons
And Teeth that was my Pride
And from the Forest all would hear
Wisdom Opens the Gate for the King
My Weapons Sighted  My Tears they Tasted
Summon my Warriors  To the Land of Desire
To the Domain of Hate  Where Cold Winds Blew
For Lust for Hell  We Rode with the North Wind
Only I could accomplish a fuckin' Selfdeceit
There are only Two Paths  the Mind or the Sword
And the Mind was Open like the Sights in a Dream
But the Sword was like a Stone around my neck
I Entered the Soul of the Snake
And Slept with the Armageddish Whore
 without my Throne and my Weapons
Where Cold Winds Blow became my Grave <start> My eyes
With nocturnal vampirism they
burn
With the shadow of catacombs
Floating with soul of my
death...
My eyes
With nocturnal bird they burn
With the howling beauty of thy
arms
With the scream filled with pain
They burn
My might
Boundessly it rises
Power of the moons in the
pentagon of love...
Our gods
In their mothers' womb they burn
In diabolical circles of courses of fiery dreams <start>  always on the run
Seven years ago we wrote this one
Like ernest and julio before it's time
Sever years later and it's holding up fine
Stupid motherfckers like to slug us and dis
But there was no bandwagon when we wrote this
'cause we stretched our boundaries
We opened the door
That no one attempted before
Five guys in shorts who gives a shit
We do what we like we don't care where we fit
All you new jacks what is it
You're kidding me get off our dicks
Now we're anthrax and we take no shit
And we don't care for writing hits
The sound you hear is what we like
And I'll steal your poptarts like I stole your

Beat the beats the beats you beat
The only thing harder's the smell of my feet
So listen up close or you might get dissed
Go drain the lizard or take a piss...
Watch the beat
I'm on your case I'm in your face
Kick you and your father back in place
Step off sucker understand
Don't you know
I'm the man
We got real def rhythms and fresh new jams
If ya think we've got egos well we're just hams
Scott plays stickball and likes to skate
Frankie's never on time he's always...
Drinking the drinks the drinks I drank
I put my money in the bank
They cut their crack they offer joints
We don't do drugs do you get our meaning...
Point point point point and watch the beat
For a heavy metal band raps a different way
But we like to be different and not cliche
Well they say rap and metal can never mix
Well all of them can suck our...
Fart the farts the farts he farted
I pick my nose but I'm not retarded
Like el duce says smell my anal vapor
And wipe my butt with your fuckin' face
You stupid idiot...
Sooooooo as this rap is winding down
It's plain to see I forgot my hat
You know anthrax is number one
But we don't care we just wanna have...
Buff the buff the buff he buffed
We are the kings and all shall buff
We're like a diamond this is forever
And will remain the hardest ever <start> Mutilated on the cross
Blackness covered the bastards flesh

See the fire through my eyes

A distance so pale an existence so cold
Resembling the views these angels of damnation
As my mind came and flew
Upon the ruins of future I stood to be told
That the future will fail upon the hands that fold
At the edge of the horizon I saw the harmony of havoc
The path of the marauders Incomprehensible yet tremendous
Upon the failure denial of token
Upon the speech in my tongue spoken
The sign the pulse that protrude
The resound the return
The sequence that concludes the fall of man
The fall of man
Upon the ruins of future I climbed to behold
A distance so pale an existence so cold
Resembling the views these angels of damnation
As my mind came and flew
Upon the ruins of the future
I settled to be bold
When the downfall arise as I am told
The denomination of the grandiose demise
Granted as the Incomprehensible impetus
Upon the failure denial of token
Upon the speech in my tongue spoken
Upon the ruins of the future
I settled to be bold
When the downfall arise as I am told
When the downfall arise as I am told <start> The Lonely Dead
Alone is to feel death crawling beneath your skin
We must remember the dead

Worried no longer we were free for the first time
Now more lonely than we ever been

The lonely dead lonely
Alone is to feel death crawling beneath your skin
We must remember the dead
Around the fire we wonder if they are alone as we are
The lonely dead lonely
Dead we are the lonely dead dead we are the lonely dead
When we speak we speak of the new age
And we realize the dead
Our lives in the ruin of change
Our first choice was to bury them

The trusting pigs and the manmade ghost
Linked by susceptibility and ignorance
Morality is synthetic
Human nature is pathetic
Embrace the mythos
Embrace the lie
Morality is synthetic
Human nature is pathetic
You want your cross and you will receive it
A cross for every pig Squeal on the cross as I drive a single spike through
your skull
Hammering as the pigs of Faith squeal
The prayers of tradition silenced by the howls of crucified holy
Destroy the mythos
Destroy the lie
Destroy the pigs
Hammer out life
Hammering  bleeding the pigs
Hammering  bleeding the pigs <start> We can win we can lose
We can swallow the bad news
In the end we all know our life is just a show
Everybody plays a game and in our hearts
There's hidden our real face
Who is the man who says I'm never gonna cry
It's a lie it's a lie
And who is the girl who says I'm never gonna sigh
It's a lie it's a lie
On the road to nowhere in the falling rain
I've come to makin' my mind up to get to the point
And here I go again
Who is the man who says I'm never gonna cry
It's a lie it's a lie
No I'm not the man who says I'm never gonna die
But I'm alive still alive alive
We are not guilty we never know the way it goes
Just like heroes heroes heroes
An all day routine
We can be deadly wounded but we can stand the pain
We might lose the battle but for our ideals
We stand right up and start to fight again
We all know our enemies but only God knows
Who will fall lean back and lick your wounds
Fight them all for you
You are not guilty you never know the way it goes
Just like heroes heroes
Who is the man who says I'm never gonna cry
It's a lie it's a lie
No I'm not the man who says I'm never gonna die
But I'm alive still alive
Heroes heroes heroes
We are heroes heroes <start> EverEve  Fade To Grey
One man on a lonely platform
One case sitting by his side
Two eyes staring cold and silent
Shows fear as he turns to hide
Ah ah we fade to grey 
Ah ah we fade to grey 
Un homme dans une gare desolee
Une valise a ses cotes
Deux yeux fixes et froids
Montrent de la peur lorsqu'il
Se tourne pour se cacher
Ah ah we fade to grey 
Ah ah we fade to grey 
Sent la pluie comme un ete anglais
Comme les notes d'une chanson lontaine
Sortant de derriere d'un poster
Esperant que la vie ne fut si longue
Ah ah we fade to grey 
Ah ah we fade to grey 
Feel the rain like an English summer
Hear the notes from a distant song
Stepping out from a backdrop poster
Wishing life wouldn't be so dull
Devenir a gris
Ah ah we fade to grey 
Ah ah we fade to grey

Where the claws of evil are waiting
Shades of treason
In a land of coldness  Forever
I'm the one who defends the world
One step closer to the end
I'm the one who prevents the curse
One step closer to the end
When I come to my land of fantasy
Where I fly on wings of harmony
All my passions inflame
When I come to my land of fantasy
Fly away from the shades of misery
Hope and passion remain
Back into reality
I'm facing greed and hate
In touch with danger all the time
It's hiding everywhere
Searching for a mystery
Somewhere in the night
A journey to my history
I'm standing up to fight
Fighting for honour
I'm praying for survival
I'm facing the end of the world
Fathers in heaven
Are steering my future
And telling me tales from the past
Almighty kingdom
I'll never surrender
That fires of passion remain <start> Music Hertrich
Lyrics HertrichWinkler
With how sad steps You climb the skies 
How silently how pale Your face...
What may it be that even in this place
that busy archer his arrows tries 
Liebe verendet zu Staub und verlabt mich
Mein Geist er schaut auf zu den hoheren
Zielen und reichert fur mich Unvergangliches
an Vergangliches bringt mir nur
endliche Freuden
Leave me oh love which reachest but to dust
And You my mind aspire to higher things
Grow rich in that which never takes rust
What ever fades but fading pleasure brings
Verbreite die Strahlen gib' mir Deine Macht
die die Wolken besiegt und das Licht mir bewegt
durch den Fruhling des goldnen belebenden Blickes
Ich suche den Weg in der Dammerung schwer
And let the day be time enough to mourn
Let walking eyes suffice to vail their scorn
The shipwreck of my illadventured youth
Without the torment of the night's untruth <start> I'm trapped under the weight of what is not
Tortured by what can't be changed
Never feel the way that I feel
Just a step away
But there's a million miles of distance
Just thought when I awake in my mind
When I walk alone I can see her when I close my eyes
Just to have her haunt my dreams
I am crushed under the weight of what's not returned <start>

There's no answer <start> Sadly I depart
To a land too profound
To be discouvered
By mankind
Engendered out of images
Fed by broken hope
I fly... my wings carried
By the breath of ages...
The decay of your love
Was the key to my voyage
To settle in your dreams...
Forever
Encouraged by your fear
For them who were wrong
and were predistined
To stay this way
Like a whirlwind
You pass by
Clothed in your mantle of innocence
The passing of the fluxes
Forever put down
Undecieved loathesome whore
You take me to Innaya
The paths are burning
With the greenish fire of repressed sadness
Elysian
Enveil me with your velvet eyes
Elysian
Forelorn goddess of the lie
Elysian
My broken heart will be erased
Elysian
Tenderly walk by... disgraced

Take My Grief... To the Gods

Brought to this world to wither again
Naive about the ways of life is what they say
Millions live millions die more are yet to come
Living skeletons  Where they come from
Born dead into this world
To starve and rot in agony
Born dead into this world
It's their choice why can't you see
Life of misery soon a corpse you be
As bones show through nothing you can do
Relief does not exist
When you are born to die
Disease spreads fast across their dying world
Many cemeteries they will have to build
As process goes on for many years to come
A human waste land created when they are done
Born dead into this world
To starve and rot in agony
Born dead into this world
It's their choice why can't you see <start> 
Lucifer
In glory and pride we rage and the dragon blisters...
May endless tears of pain stain His beloved throne.
We'll now dethroneth The Prophet and descend'th
upon The Lamb and the reign of the holy tyrant
A darkness sweeps over the mighty skies
and armies of wrath storms the holy gates.
Flaming swords and spears raised in allegiance
as war glimmers in all corners of heaven.
Lucifer
Raise thine swords draconian hordes
This is the quest of eternal might...
The war has begun we are the lords...
Let's now conquer the holy and the bright
Holy blood is raining from the infinite skies
and as the gate shatters Astaroth shouts in fury
Astaroth
Now break the chain
They gather around Gods temple.
One could feel His false glory was fading
and Heavens winds sounds desparing screams.
Lucifer and Astaroth enters the opening...
and there on the throne He sits...
Lucifer
Finally we hath come to end thy reign...
Milleniums o' torture ends... it ends with thine light
They rage towards the highest with burning eyes...
thunder and lightning roars the Heav'ns... so black.
Valiant the dark angel strikes in all his fury
and glory as God forever clos'd His eyes.

We have conquered the holy and the bright <start> You're the matter the motion and the mind.
You're the great realization of my perfect self.
You devour and destroy the Gods of earth
and consent the incarnation of joys of life.
You have gathered the fruit of knowledge's Tree.
All the wisdom you give is just the food I need.
Now I've learned the balance of my brain
and I follow the law of Universal Love.
Now I see Mow I hear
the voice of my Angel that comes to wake up me.
Now I dress my dead body like a king
then I shed all my clothes to live again.
With my birth I can reach the joys of God.
I'll free soul and body from impurity.
Come to me I invoke Thee
Holy Guardian Angel my will is inside your name.
Now my old being is dead but I'm reborn.
With your help I renew my weary life through love.
Now I start to converse with all my Gods.
I can scatter my seed into the spate of stars.
Come to me I invoke Thee
Holy Guardian Angel my will is inside your name <start> As a hero into battle
At the side of Joan of Arc
Glorious Marshalls of France
Gilles de Rais
You were the one to insult
an important priest
Never afraid to face the enemy
However when the night longs
for Him shadows on the wall
reflect scenes which cannot
bare the light of day
Appreciating aesthetic art and Alchemy
But the most vile thoughts
and desires poison his mind
As a true Emperor of Lust
Raping and slaughtering little boys
like a romance of Death kissing
a decapitated Child's head
But his end was approaching
 Execution but no fear
He showed as  into battle <start> The sun was golden flame
The air was sweet like honey
The grass was soft we made
A pledge to keep on running.
The clouds were shied away
The air was warm and damp
Oh on this golden day
You ripped my heart away.
It was the dawn of may
A lonely blackbird singing
Now the same melody
Brings back the pain...
Chorus

You'll get it regret it
Take my advice

You'll get it regret it
If you are wise
As long as you are getting older
Always look over your shoulder twice
The moon was silver light
The air was sweet like honey.
We said our last goodbyes
Now what are we becoming
Outside the blackbirds sing
But you keep down the blinds
'Cause each time you kiss her lips
They'll sing my lullaby.
Chorus
Always look twice

Not so long ago
Now we are sober and cold
And there's no way to return

Chorus

Always look over your shoulder twice. <start> Endless nights in a splendid dark
Where the dream of hate is pure
Wasteless days in my living hell
Where the thorns are stabbing my heart
Falling drowning in my soul of black
Leaving silent from this cruel world
I am a worthless soul with tears in my eyes
And the crows are stabbing my back
Wounded in my filthy evil soul
Darkish hellholes awaits my heart
Here I am laying at the point of death
Waiting for my passage to hell
I close my eyes and wait for the fall
Free from my wounds free from my sins
Falling drowning in my soul of black
Leaving silent from this cruel world
Here I am laying at the point of death
Waiting for my passage to hell
I close my eyes and wait for the fall
Free from my wounds free from my sins <start> Concussion doesn't sideline but recharges
Now you're in a world of shit
Listen to the night as it hovers overhead
Can you hear it laughing
Draw the joker card
How did that get back in the deck
Scowl mask removed from back pocket
The tighter the fit the better
The tighter the fit the better <start> It's hard to admit I'm wrong sometimes
But even harder to admit I'm right
Compromise as the sun rises and falls
Just trying to avoid the fight
Thinking I'm upholding my purpose from God
While my soul and spirit fall apart
I smile and play along with everything
As I lie to my own heart
The things I think Satan wants torn apart
Maybe it's him holding them together
His hand not behind the malfunctions
But the tensions that ensue with others
It's all a game I play along with
Close your eyes and bow your head
I get home and I ponder my lies
And I know that I am dead
Each Christian life in the balance
More important than any charade
Who's purpose only delays the inevitable
And ultimately sends it into the flames
With foundation in place I must stand
The compromise must end
Or God will walk me through the ashes

Lightning strikes on the wild raging sea
the storm rules in the air
Roaring thunder in the burning horizon
waves high in the sky
But the warriors on the ship of hate
will stay in their course
Thunderstorm will not stop the rage
or the cry for blood
Pre Chorus
On and on in the storm
Through the horizon
Wind in their sails
Lust for fight kill and rape
Chorus
Tyrants out on the sea
Death awaits in their steel
This battleship will be your end
Hungry eyes of the pirates
Anger grows on the sea
By the sword you will die
Breaking the waves like a sword in the wind
with the flag in the sky
Searching for flesh to their steel
they will show no mercy
Eternal evil hate and pride
there's no escape
Glory shines in their eyes
to pride to die

Divides and sets free
Until the newborn brakes and takes

Leads astray the error and

Will consider again.

Laugh and shine or is it all the same
PSALMS FOR THE DEAD
SONG FOR THE LIVING
AND A WREATH FOR ABSENT FRIENDS
So tell me... fools and trubadours can a simple stream grow into a flood
A beggar man become a president
And a sip of wine be shared... and thick as blood
Idols gods... Dictators and divine
is this the path where blind men lead the blind
What is love but only a dream...
Those pains and pures were meatn to set us free
When time is gone the page is turned
The door is closed and all is done and said
The band has played... the spotlight's burned
ALL THAT'S LEFT ARE
PSALMS FOR THE DEAD <start> Looking back
My life in pieces
Every triumph
Every defeat
Final mission
To build a new world
Away from danger
A new beginning
Free from sorrow
Mission failure
At my command
A thousand lives
Trapped in suspension
Nation's pride
How can they forgive me
I remember a peaceful place
In an old church we were married
I vowed to take care of you
An now I have failed that one two
I know this is where I should be
To make a stand for what I believe
To make my own destiny
To make my mark in history
I need to show myself
That all I know is true
And all the battles all the wars
Have led me to this hour
The peace this world has known
Is well worth fighting for
And the ones who saved our lives
Are well worth dying for
Change my life
Change my soul
Change my life
Change my soul
I am ready release control
I know I need to begin
Putting the pieces together again <start> All of you here that are secretly dead
Just a lifeless shells consumed and bled
Oblivious season and you are blind
Follow the trend to share a single mind
You are so blind
You are so blind
You are so blind to the lie
I can see I can see into the void of your mind
Hiding behind eyes of black
A dead man I will find
Find Find
Kneel to the savior who really cares less
His holy eyes fill you with fear and dread
Obey those rules from ancient history
Forgotten words that mean nothing to me
You are so blind
You are so blind
You are so blind to the lie
I can see I can see into the void of your mind
Hiding behind eyes of black
A dead man I will find
A dead man I will find
Find Find <start> At the time of sundown
Nature bathes in colors
In silence it waits
For the approaching force
In the halls of Ainola
The true king of dark waters
Lurks with his mistress
Under the waves of a blue lake
Dwells the mighty Ahti
Sailors praise the glorious name
The ruler of tides Ahti
At the shores of a northern land
Pray mortal men
Destruction for the arrogant fools
A reward for humble souls
The great lurker of the seas
Is pleased of the sacrifice
The waters are calm
Today no storm shall rise
Foreign ship filled with infidels
They didn't listen to the northern men
From a dead calm storm will rise
And they'll face the wrath of the sea
Take care that your heir
Don't turn out too proud
Or your bloodline will drown into a vast ocean <start> A private horrorshow is playing in my head
Movie after movie until I am... dead <start> I remember a time
when you held your head high
and saved lives you try
you try to bring back
that person that kept us all alive
They say they don't need anyone to rely on
but you saved them all once or twice back then
it's true what they say
you don't know how good you've got it
till it's gone.................. Where have you gone
Why can't you get back what you had
was it something that we did back then

It could happen to any of us
we'd all act the same
you try to bring back
that person that kept us all alive
now watch as they feed
All of them will be taking
credit for your actions it's not right
Watch Them Feed
They're gonna take you alive
It's not right
Where have you gone
Why can't you get back what you had
you say it's all too much to take
tell me why can't you get back what you had
was it something that we did back then
Ready Incoming
They'll take you down alive
Could i find everything that i was looking for
in all the wrong places
We know you're there so don't pretend that its over
Over

It could happen to any of us
we'd all act
You try to bring back what i had now
It could happen to any of us
we'd all act the same <start> At the peak of evolution's tower we perch
and glare downward toward the understrappers below
Unable to see all the way to the bottom
Unable to care even if we could

Great enough to lift our noses to the skies
as existence crumbles around us from the ground up
How great are we <start> hallo schne frau

Everything around me burns
And I know that I will not survive
See him rise from land of flames
In this wild and barren land
I will make my final stand
My death awaits I have no fear
To this end my fate is bound
Though I'm doomed
I'll stand my ground
This fight is mine and mine alone
And there's no help from anyone
I go forth to meet my doom
But I will die in vain
Perdition waits for everyone
The world will die in flames
With all my strength I run the horn
Deep into his eye
And as he swings his burning sword
I die with a tired smile <start> The government keeps spending
The country's always lending
Supplies out the ass so they can stab us in the back
The stock market falling while the corporations are sawing
Employees out like deadwood so the profits can increase
Insurance rates increasing cost of living shoot straights up
Crime is on the rise and the prisons just erupt
This racist shit still with us war is surely far from gone
If the summit doesn't do it we'll all be ash and bone
Chorus
Corruption in the government
But what would you expect
Some things will never change
And on this you can surely bet
Tell me where we're heading to Hell
As time runs out in a deadly battle we fight a losing bout
Another child's abducted what is it with these nuts
Or a hostage used in blackmail this push has come to shove
The rich keep getting richer and the poor they just die off
If we can't help each other our time is surely lost
Insurance rates increasing cost of living shoot straights up
Crime is on the rise and the prisons just erupt
This racist shit still with us war is surely far from gone
If the summit doesn't do it we'll all be ash and bone
Chorus
Destroy the ozone with chemicals
Our food and water get the same
You say you're gonna clean it up now
Your hypocrisy becomes so lame <start> Did you ever want to worry
Did you ever want to have a doubt
You wanted the best for me
Somehow things went wrong.
And I tore us apart.
Did you ever think it was easy
Thought my time was running out
Tried it how I wanted tto
Though you did not agree
But I was calling you  calling
Father you can't hide it's time to lose the pride  some day.
Take a look and see I'm blue as I can be.
In former days you made your own way
You found on easy way of life.
But I'll be never satisfied to work from nine till five.
I'm heading for more
I remember what you've said
But I know I won't regret
When I try to break the rules
I'm searching for my way my own way
Father you can't hide your feelings deep inside  oh no
There's a better way for you and me today.
I can't stand it anymore  it's only you and me
We have to talk and see.
How things are gonna be but all I want is peace
Father Father Father 
Father now it's time we ain't losin' our minds any more
It seems so long ago fate will bring us hope <start> Pogo happy clown molester
Paints his face to disguise the jester
Joined the local moose lodge chapter
Spawning evil ever after
He picks his prey up at the bar
Gets him drunk and in the car
Drives him home and down the stairs
Strips to his underwears
Pogo you're gonna burn in hell
Murder victim slice and smile
Serial killer pedophile
Look into those empty eyes
You know when it's your time to die
He cuts you up in little bits
Cuts you up in little bits
Goes bop bop on your head again
Spills your blood now he's soaked in sin
Pogo you're gonna burn in hell
Drives all night through the city streets
To hack up his victims like a piece of meat
Spoke to the devil the other day
And john is doing fine
Drives all night through the city streets
Where he carves his victims like a piece of meat
Spoke to the devil the other day
And john is doing fine
Oh the end is true
When the sun goes down on the city streets
You know pogo's comin after you
Oh the end is true
When the sun goes down on the city streets
Pogo's comin after you
Drives all night through the city streets
Where he carves his victims like a piece of meat
Spoke to the devil the other day
And john is doing fine
Drives all night through the city streets
Where he carves his victims like a piece of meat
Spoke to the devil the other day
And john is doing fine
Pogo you're gonna burn in hell <start> So young so beautiful. So empty.
Its a shame you had to end this way.
Your ignorance so thoughtless so dead.
You had the chance to be somebody's hero and you decided to turn and walk away.
You had the chance. you turned away.
And I won't forget your face.
Look into these eyes and tell me what you see.
Another twisted broken dream
This is how we kill your ignorance.
So thoughtless so dead.
You had the chance to be somebody's hero and you failed.
I raise my fist to the sky I drop to my knees I wonder if retribution is the answer motherfucker
You can burn in hell.
Burn in hell <start> This is retribution
So come to me all you philosphers
I have a use for all your words
And as for you poets and bards
Syncophants to every scar
And as for you lovers of light
You are prisoners on all sides
And as for you humanists
I give the gift of pestilence
This is tyranny
And as for your politics
You march in circles with semantic tricks
And as for you occultists
You hide in shadows with your books
And fuck all you religious fools
Your gods your temples your fucking rules
I have no need for pessimism
I believe in nihilism
And emperors of golden halls
You built your tomb within your walls
So blessed be the murderers
Who work like wicked conjurers <start> Instrumental <start> Verteidige dein Knigreich

Roderick Usher walks
Among the dismal racks of heradries
And rich arrays
The feeble gleam of candle marks
His pale reflections on the window stained
Insolent fate lurid fever
Cold is the Eve adorned with death
Luring silence i every breath
In fear of fear life is colder
Bei dir in der Verlassenheit
Entrage deine Strafe
Laid upon a silken seat
Madeline Usher strikes
A frozen flagstone checks her chest
Laid upon a flushing Styx
Madeline Usher strives
The stars are out of sight
Forever out of sight
Insolent fate lurid fever
Cold is the Eve adorned with death
Luring silence in every breath
In fear of fear life is colder

Tag  Schwarz schaut Glitzerwucherflut
das Zerrwerk das nur nachtseits ruht.
Wahnsinn den ich hier scheint's fliehe
 meines Wahnsinns letzter Schild
 namenloser ngste Quelle
aller Wahrheit Winkelbild.
Nacht  Schwarz schaut miges Nichts
den schweren Glanz des Mondeslichts.
Tiefe die ich darin seh'
 meiner Tiefe Spiegelbild
 stiller Sehnsucht letzter Zeuge
aller Leere letzter Schild.
Schwarz schaut tiefsten Lichterglanz
Sonne  Mond den starren Tanz
der milde alle Wege meidet
vor  zurck  im Abgrund schwingt
und mir meine Trume neidet.
 Schwarz durchschaut 
 Schwarz sehnt sich sehr  <start> Isn't it great to see how life begins
Things may change let the joy begin
Can you hear this new life crying
Breed it out it will be worth it
Show me your newborn smile

I don't want to hold you

I don't want to see you
'Cause even your smile hurts
Oh it hurts like hell
Isn't it good to see how life begins
There's no sin and there's no crime
Down where I am there's no bitter end at all
This bitterness is endless keeps going on and on
I don't want to hold you
I don't want to see you
Even birth can bear disgrace
I don't want to hold you
I don't want to see you
Or even the smile upon your face
I fear my heart and fear my soul
And all the things that are unknown
There's a chance things will turn wrong my friend
Far too fast I'm losing ground
Well let's face it here and now
You're not wellcome you should know
I fear my heart and fear my soul
Life goes on it surely will
Without me it will wither
Will I ever see light again
Will I ever see light again
Oh life goes on
I don't want to hold you
I don't want to see you
My tear of joy turned into grief

Down where I am that's where darkness rules
The silence shall be only friend <start> Creation falls to madness raped by political thieves.
Nations Cast to Fires policy dictated by greed.
Embrace false justice designed to ease our fears.
Immoral leaders.
The end of time is here.
Embrace the end as warheads fall.
Killing civilization.
Radiation poisons the world.
The earth is dying.
Hell rages on the streets.
With all our progress to destroy all we learned.
Doomsday is upon us mass destruction on a global scale.
Missiles fly  extermination.
The human experiment has now failed.
All of creation poisoned by chemical war.
Weapons of destruction  new efficient ways to kill.
Survivors live to suffer they are condemned to life.
Struggle in the aftermath.
Our world has tumbled down.
Cease to exist.
The Destroyers have prevailed.
The murderers have victory  the rule a world that's failed.
Our leaders have failed us and we have failed ourselves. <start> Eaten aliveMunched into pulp
Premature necropsy
Comes closer with each gulp
Brain not fully deadDecrepit splattered libs
Mass ensanguined spasms
Excretion now begins...
...Semiconscious human faeces
...Semidigested squirming pieces
...Semianimate in excrement
...Semiterminal constipation
 <start> They're sleeping through the ages
Faces bare of names
Remembrance ever lies
At the Bosom of the insane
Death's cold embrace
Across the restless seas
Unfolding the wish to forget
The eyes of the deceased
Thirst for the wine in my hand
Third from the sun
The heart of death
A thought for fake desires
Starving trough the night
Engulfed in an earthbound fire
Left all alone among the dances and cries
They seed all the hate
Within the shade of sights <start> Fu all por Tijuana
Mi celular sonaba

The human eye now raped and dazed
Our marks of shame soon worn away
The spider's trapped in a web of clay
Naked in the desert of delight
Banish the throughts into the night
Scarecrow servant of demise
Parting the honey from the flies
What's in the veins is what to keep
Still the floods of raptures sound asleep
Visions fade and die at ease
Inferior slaves are ours to please
The last of shadows shapes the end
From mountains high it all descends
One single dagger unleash the doom
Creation falls in my closed room <start> Advance across the channel towards impending doom
A chance you may not live to see another day
The beach is getting closer
You're sickened by the fear
Men will die around you
Today remember what they've done
In a wave of allied force
Valour beats inside their hearts
They set the standard for the best
Carrying the fate of man
The objective must be reached
Run across the battlefield
A push to break the tyrant's hold
Make the greatest sacrifice
The enemy does their worst
But your goal is taken first
The strength to always take 'em down
Victory is in reach
Storming Juno beach
Catalyst to win the day
Solo Hagberg
Winded by the shockwave
Bullets grazed my body
Listening to the sounds of all my brothers dying
I may live to see my family again
But Juno I'll relive until my final day
Terrified by all the sights that you're around
Bodies of your brothers that lay
Shattered on the ground
No time to cry you'll shed your tears
When you succeed
Battle through the chaos
All the courage you will need
Adrenaline takes over the horrors you now see
Bullets turn the flesh and sea to bloody red
Rallying your forces courage finds a way
Survive this hell on earth lay it all out on the line
Charge towards the turret
Scream louder than the guns
No mercy for the scourge
No one will forget this day
Valour beats inside their hearts
In a wave of allied force
Carrying the fate of man
They set the standard for the best
Run across the battlefield
The objective must be reached
Make the greatest sacrifice
A push to break the tyrant's hold
The enemy does their worst
But your goal is taken first
The strength to always take 'em down
Victory is in reach
Storming Juno beach
Turning point in bloody war <start> Eurovision  Stay

Obssessed with dominance obssessed with lies
I am the chaos controller of minds
Perfect Machine evil divine.
Look into my eyes and tell me what you see
Fear and despair  your own destiny.
I am the strongest I have the force.
Your life is mine without any cost.
Bleed die under command
You're falling fast to hell and back
Don't try to understand
The politics of war games...
I am the patriot for cash and gold.
Making the money making the war
Who cares for peace I have my own wish
Open the gates of hell unleash the beast <start> A new eon is rising from the horizon
A new epoch starts
A liberator god will drive away the clouds
Of our slavery
The great horus will reclam his rightful throne
Stolen by your Christ
And the eclipse of light and freedom will be erased
And so comes the dawn...
...of the equinox of the gods
And so comes the dawn
Of the equinox of the gods...
The new age of magick was dictated
By the crowned son
It's the power of the master of the beast
That is called man
He will break all our chains taking the place
Of the dying god
And repealed will be all rituals and ordeals
And so comes the dawn...
...of the equinox of the gods
And so comes the dawn
Of the equinox of the gods... <start> One change
One kill
These things you've
Lost all your sight
Night of regress
Your promise lost
Here tonight
Empty love lost
In one sweet moment of pride
One chance one kill
Six years forgotten in life
Goodbye my love these
Signs are strong
All bets are off
Let's call it a day
One chance
One kill
You gave it away
Hard to swallow
All these years
They meant nothing nothing nothing nothing
All these scars you gave to me
They meant nothing nothing nothing nothing
You're in denial
You're in denial
You're in denial
One fault
One slip
Regret is drawn on your face
No turning back
What was is now such a waste
Hardened by spite
The trust snuffed out by a lie
One fault one slip
Here's to the final goodbye
Goodbye my love these
Signs are strong
All bets are off
Let's call it a day
Last chance
Last stand
You gave it away
Hard to swallow
All these years
They meant nothing nothing nothing nothing
All these scars you gave to me
They meant nothing nothing nothing nothing
You're in denial
You're in denial
You're in denial
Denial
Hard to swallow
All these years
They meant nothing
All these scars you gave to me
They meant nothing nothing
Now let me tell you
That my giving
In return has been reserved
Just for you
And let me tell you when you
Watch me rise I did it all
In spite of you
Hard to swallow
All these years
They meant nothing nothing nothing nothing
All these scars you gave to me
They meant nothing nothing nothing nothing
You're in denial
You're in denial
You're in denial
You're in denial
You're in denial
You're in denial
Denial <start> And I won't sit back and watch anymore
While all the fallacies and lies become to much to handle
You're on a train that's heading off its tracks
Back up sit back and watch the flames dance
Through the times that we were friends
Truth has been skin deep like glass in the wounds
One and the same so save that precious breath
Before you shatter like the rest
I'll I'll watch you choke on this
Watch you choke on all the promises
After all the hallowed words you spoke
Many are blind to see the reality of what is happening
I'll watch you choke I'll watch you choke
Before it has a chance to be fed to someone else
I'll watch you choke I'll watch you choke
Take a deep breath it will be your last
Burn me
From here on out our lives reflect the shattered glass
Just another painful reminder of a distant hateful past
Fly away with the fire with the fire
Fly away with the fire
So shut your mouth look in the mirror
And bite your forked tongue before the ink begins to dry
After all the trials we have fought amongst ourselves
The time has come to sit back and watch you fall
Through the times that we were friends
Truth has been skin deep like glass in the wounds
One and the same so save that precious breath
Before you shatter like the rest <start> You think you know when my time is right
Standing there with your shining might
No more than a frail lie
Now it's gone give me a fight
Time and time again
Your pain leads the way
Nails pierce through my neck
Were a death serum now it's wrecked
Halt your ever strong reign
Don't set shadow on the pain
You're no more than a frail lie
Now it's gone give me a fight
Look at what you have become
Oh sweet saint your role here's done
Corrosive lies whispered bane
Now here's what you are unanswered crave
For he whom has been raised to hate
Through hate he sees and to hate awakes
For he whom has been raised to hate
Through hate he sees and hate creates
Carrier of this burden
Burden of disguise
Corroded by nothing
Weaving your malice through time
When blades turn to rust
And pain turns to dust
Omens tell of light
But you're forever corrupt
After many lost endeavors
The gales are soon to rise
Aeons of lost times slip away <start> Yeah yeah
Ooh
Sittin' by the phone but it's not ringing
Nobody cares who am I kiddin'
But I still got hope
See all of my life I've been searchin'
For a girl to end this yearnin'
Come out and fulfil my dreams
Baby 'cos I feel so alone
I ain't got a love to call my own and so i just want to know
CHORUS
Is there someone out there
Someone who cares for me
Someone true through the good and bad times too
Is there someone out there
Is it you
Oh
If you're there and if you're listenin'
If you're the girl that I've been missin'
Then just make your move
Show me thrill me don't waste time just tell me
Cos you've got nothing to lose
Don't ya know I dream of you girl
The scent of your hair strawberry lips even the perfume you wear
CHORUS
Could you be the light of my life
The girl of my dreams
And could this be love and what does love mean
Though nothing's for sure we might find romance
If you are something special
Then let's take our chance
Oh yeah
Repeat CHORUS to end <start> Death Takes 'em all...
I am the Hater
The Sin of God the Whore of Life
I am the Will who Kill for the Bloody Sake of Death
I am the Hater
The Fear the Lies the Painful Cries
I am the Blade which Slits a Throat to End another Breath
I Bring terrible Demise
Spill Misery over their Lives
I Make sure Evil will Rise
To End more Meaningful Lives
I am the Hater
The Tormentor
An Eye for an Eye
Everyone fucking Die <start> There is no culture is my brag
Your taste for bullshit reveals a lust for a home of office
This is the home of the vain
This is the home of the vain
Where are the obligatory niggers
Hey there fuckface
Hey there fuckface
There are twelve people in the world
The rest are paste
This is the home of the vain
This is the home of the vain
I just left the hotel amnesia I had to go there
Where it is I can't remember
But now I can remember now I can remember

All those shots died from a broken heart
Got to end before getting to start

you move with wedded bliss
oh place your hand
on my soul
your name be gloriana
touch me still
for by grace be you only
you are
and your name be gloriana
your calm ways clear my mind
drive me towards you
you protect me from myself
your breath inspirits me
your hair blows through my face
you remove it from my lips
your name be gloriana <start> Cold in my land
Whate'er the time I've been
Running too fast or walking too slow
For a long time.
Tomorrow I will hate
and celebrate my greed
Wandering the Waste
And tasting my heart
Smells like sour and filth.
Tears don't belong to me
And no one else
I'm running to my hell
'Cause none of us can make a stand.
Running to my hell...
Cold rain rush me into my hell
All alone when light's off.
We are born to procreate
And subjugate.
Tears don't belong to me
And no one else
I'm running to my hell
'Cause none of us can make a stand.
Running to my hell...
Cold Waste of a bloody
Taste we're alone
And ready to fall.
Frontiers without volunteers.
Who asked for a penny of love
Skyscrapers with a hellish view from above.
We're ready to fall.
Cold Soul if you're feeling old you can call
When you can't go on... <start> Now as I'm settled so old and outired
And no one's here to tell about my live
I'll sing this lonely tune again and again
To bear the echos in my mind.
The things I did  the words I said
Though time passed by  I can't forget
In hopeless times  alone I've cried
Time time  pass me by
A youngster's guilt once taken upon
The strengthening shoulders of a growing man
The weakness age has rolled in 'em pines
Has not reduced the burdens I bear.
Alone I stood amidst the river
That flooded lightness onto my soul
As a simple tune so true in its beauty
was swirling across the glitters of light.
And as my eyes focused upon
a distant glitter amidst the woods
The sudden ungreening of the trees
unvailed a singing maiden's outstanding line.
Step forward to the shimmering one
Be kind to me my blistered feet
Obey My swollen tongue for once
in my life I have to  to...
But not I moved for all my might
The maiden smiled and walked on by.
No scream no words  just the pain
that echos on and on again.
Since then I never saw again
The skirts of springtime wandering by.
For all the colours of the world
Look dim compared to what I saw that day. <start> Crave...the sound of ocean roaring
The moisture during nightime warmth
Crave...though rather illdisposedly
To be the director of your dreamplays
To cause awkward ecstatic awakenings
By his side under the ghost of me
Into the waves still rising higher
The mermaid home wish I'd be taken there
Like the amoeba spawns
Filling poor Rockford's cave
My brains swell sorely
When exposed to the vicinity
The conciousness sears me
Through the necessary
Inhaling sin sketching the moves
Crave...the sound of ocean roaring
It was all tears mixed with sea
I'm purified by crystal showers and now
Salt tastes too mildy on my tongue
Crave...though rather illdisposedly
To wake the seanymph that remains unseen
Causing awkward ecstatic awakenings
By his side under the ghost of me <start> This song is instrumental <start> Instrumental <start> His witch immortal
black blood in his veins
clever mind dark knowledge
made him strong
he's witchmaster
He has lots of enemies
those damned slaves
tools of slavemoralitc
who hate individualism
He has pover of witchcraft
spells and rites of Hexxcraft
Black magic and okkultism
He is witchmaster
Witch blood is black
as black as their magick <start> Close your eyes and fall asleep
And I will guide you to my kingdom
A place where we will unite
When the day turns to night
Join me  fly with me  into the land of dreams
We will walk through archways of solid gold
We will swim in lakes of wine
Fly with me  into the land of dreams
Join me  fly with me  into the land of dreams
We will walk through archways of solid gold
We will swim in lakes of wine
Join me  fly with me  forever  dreaming
In a world without limitations
Where worlds are heard but never spoken
Where reality becomes unreal
Join me  into my dreams
Close your eyes and fall asleep
And I will guide you to my kingdom
A place where we will unite
When the day turns to night
Join me  fly with me  into the land of dreams
We will walk through archways of solid gold
We will swim in lakes of wine
Fly with me  into the land of dreams
Join me  fly with me  into the land of dreams
We will walk through archways of solid gold
We will swim in lakes of wine
Join me  fly with me  forever  dreaming
In a world without limitations
Let your fantasies become real
On a trip far from life
Join me  into my dream <start> Sorrow
Entering another day
Hollow
So why do you have to pray
To cry and damn me
To say I need you
How misleading
Hate
Just let me run away
Dont even try to deceive me
I thought I need you
Dont shine your eyes
I cannot stand what you say
Deeply inside me
I grab my soul
To stand the emptiness
Of the space around me
Coloured landscape
Such a falsehood
Now turning to black and white
Im searching for darkness
And loneliness here
Hoping to find out myself again
I still perceive you
Your whispers inside
Misting my view on the elected way
Just free my dreams now
I would finally feel
Myself beside
No more chances
No way out
You should know those rules by this time
Hiss your hate please
Ive chosen my way
And won't turn my steps anymore
I climbed convictions
I'm on the height now
Since I can see it
How joyful I feel
My eyes are sensing
My mind can look outside
And these prejudice walls
Will be finally broken
Deeply inside me
I've found my way
I stood the emptiness
The rebirth of my soul
Old grey landscape
Far from me behind
A shiver is crossing my spine
I'm tasting the perfect smile <start> instrumental <start> Lurinn ltur

 <start> In the dawn of dark skies a painting of mist spread amongst the air colored
leaves die and then abandon their origin. Flowerless aroma and roots with no
chance earth wisked away by winds of ignorance. A portrait of blindness we
all possess and then the all important clock begins to laugh in all our
faces. In the past not a thought to the future on a sphere that's four
billion years old the sun will burn everything and then it'll go cold we
the people will burn to the bone death ridden corpse will now mark our home.
Boiled seas will abandon shores. Think where we'll be if we don't try to act
the world will go back to it's origin. <start> Ages idol of dusk
Lord of the dark forest
Your creation of the darkness
And dark minds exile from sky
Looking for black eyes
From aged mystic age
I see dark shadow
From aged mystic age
Funeral celebration
Sacrament of black circle
Come back time of dark gods
Your mysterious way to our minds
Holy bonfire consecrate your coming
In flesh of the light
I feel your presence
In dark hiding of my soul
I hear your words <start> Lyrics  RMS Hreidmarr  November

Par vos paroles et vos actes
Dawn of a lost glory
Golden sign and shadow of mine
The Messiah I am
The golden force's the light that save
A living Goddess on the Earth
Light divine
Live for destroy mankind
Mesmerized by an unknown white line
Heart of human
Disincarnated woman
Light divine
Live for destroy mankind
I am
The dark veil on my sight
Will of the Lord
Longing on my soul
My hands bring them decadence
For honour and salvation
My eyes  they rake among us
For deception  honourable
Life  Within all of us
Was satisfying mankind

Mesmerizing Holy Light
Will fall upon the humans
Vous avez souille notre Sanctuaire
Par vos paroles et vos actes...
Ne regrettestu pas ces epoques
Ou le vin que nous buvions
Nous paraissait si bon 
Ces ceremonies sanguines au theatre de Berlioz...
Ce pouvoir Divin 
Tout n'etait qu'exuberance
Nous n'avons jamais domine
Ne regrette pas
Bois rejoinsnous dans notre majestueux enfer
Toutes ces ruines de Metal et de Latex
Ces corps enlaces
La douleur du fouet et du fer
Les marques n'ont jamais change
Lobotomie intemporelle
Coulee de lave vomie par ton ame
Je t'execre et te maudis
Juste parce que tu existes <start> Agony lives in my soul
passion haunts my mind
peace and chaos fight in my heart
in my dreams there is always daylight...
Black was the day
Constant the flow of my tears...
Black is the day
My yearning is invincible...
Beauty surrounded me
Illusion was beauty made true...
Beauty surrounds me
The dream is always there...
I can hear the thunder of silence
I feel the cold in the middle of the flame...
I see shadows of the invisible
I breathe where there is no air...
I eat the bread that ran out yesterday
I am dumb but I cry Thy name...
I regret the joy I have
I suffer from the happiness I wish for...
I am a prisoner behind bars of freedom
I now sense the things that have never happened. <start> w the road is paved enough blood is spilled
the path is gone...my fate fulfilled
the gate in front of my eyes
where sweet salvation lies
I always had to play along
the cruel game it's over now...
no remorse no fame
but the end is mine
My spirit's rising
my mind is falling
my soul is burning
sweet salvation
The flames are licking at my shanks
pain screams through my mortal body
there's my tortured soul
there's my evil spirit
Fanatic greeds stands in their eyes
as my body turns to ashes
and my soul is free
the evil spirit is now ours <start> music by Thomas C. Hansen
instrumental <start> As the sun sets down in the west
Another sleepless night comes her way
Working late for the ruler of the street
Finding her way trough hard times
Trying to make a good life
Selling her body to strangers in the night
Emerald eye  hold on to the signs
of a distant thunder roaring in the sky
As the sun rises up in the east
Another tyrann adores his world
Diamond rings and a monument of gold
Born to take over the throne
A creature without heart
Feeding a violent legacy of lies
Emerald eye  hold on to the signs
Of a distant thunder roaring in the sky
Emerald eye  gaze into the light
Hear the distant thunder roaring across the sky <start> Soflty ripples the dark river
I can see the moon among the branches of trees
At this dark summer night
I feel clear
Chorus
Suddenly from the deep
Distress of thousand years is heard
Sketching a purple face before me
A hand motions asking me to come
I'm flying across the end of existence
And lost sight of calm lands
Chorus
Suddenly from the deep
Distress of thousand years is heard
Sketching a purple face before me
In an obscure  blue room
A child's voice is burning me
I'm painting on his body in red
His dead face is the first step
To an unknown deep
At the door of the new world
I feel what hides in me forever
To create a new like in a new universe <start> Prisionero de un triste destino
Sin libertad de que sirve volar
el infierno se que no es mi sitio
y el cielo esta lejos de mi ideal
El hombre es libre es el elegido
Simple mortal que vive en libertad
Nace y muere elige su camino
y en cambio yo sufro la eternidad
Mi lealtad a prueba esta
por culpa de un mortal
como yo hay muchos mas
con sed de libertad
donde esta mi lugar... en el cielo estoy de mas
donde puedo volar en libertad
hoy el cielo ardera y de nada servira
Soy un angel caido me vers
hubo un tiempo de guerras en el cielo
Sin lealtad sin dios al que adorar
Cielo y fuego ambos se fundieron
La creacion en peligro de extincion
La envidia fue testigo cruel
de un cielo en el infierno
querian ser igual que el
y nada consiguieron
donde esta mi lugar... en el cielo estoy de mas
donde puedo volar en libertad
hoy el cielo ardera y de nada servira
Soy un angel caido me vers
Hoy mi dios llorar su torpeza <start> there is a pain that comes
from holding on too long
a subtle knife that scrapes the veins
we both know i'm leaving
i'm already gone
even if i'm here today
the line that defines
the shape of our lives
slowly bleeds into gray
the line that divides
this world from my mind
can only lead me away
this ever present terror
of what each day will bring
that i won't find the strength
to live
alive enough to see
just how far away i am
from where i really need to be <start> when candles and incense are not enough
to dispel the death i die every day
when an alter cloth over my wounds
cannot stop the bleeding
nor still my pain
. . . i'd gather razors' sharpest light
to see how it came to be this way
that the sinking in my head becomes
the death i die. . . death i die
when figurines twinkle as they crash to the floor
and the diamonds crumble when there are no more
when my body lingers at the killing site
gathering the sharpest stones for the chosen one
. . . i'd gather razors of sharpest light
to see how it came to be this way
that the sinking in my head becomes
the death i die. . .
fire and wine and burning lies
bring me to this crazy fear
fire and wine and burning eyes
live the master of my tears
but when the hour has broken us
we shall wonder  wonder who it was
and how it came to be this way
the death i die every fucking day
and when the demons of my mind
come to claw for scraps tonight
i shall kill them one by one
and feed their corpses to the sun
when the demons...the demons of my...mind
come to claw for table scraps tonight
and when the demons the demons of my mind
come to claw for table scraps tonight
well i shall kill them one by one
by one...by one...by one...by one...
by one...by one...by one...by one... <start> I wear the scars on my dirty face
Just because of you
I wear the mist in my darkest day
I can feel the tears from the sun
I feel a rush in my veins
I won't crawl I will breathe
I'm losing faith in you whatever you might say
I can't stand to lose myself these days of no trust
I'm losing faith in you for what you have become
In these days of no trust
days of no trust
I can't ignore our faith's bleeding fast
Who will work things out
Provide yourself from these greedy lies
I can touch my anger from within
I feel a rush in my veins
I won't crawl I will breathe
I'm losing faith in you whatever you might say
I can't stand to lose myself these days of no trust
I'm losing faith in you for what you have become
In these days of no trust
Forever is so far away
We need to see a brand new day
Endless spinning carries on
The unforgiving will be gone
Into eternity eternity eternity
I'm losing faith in you whatever you might say
I can't stand to lose myself these days of no trust
I'm losing faith in you for what you have become
In these days of no trust <start> Und am Himmel bilden sich schwarze Wolken
Der hellichte Tag wandelt sich zur Nacht
Die Temperatur strzt unaufhaltsam
dem Gefrierpunkt entgegen...
Die Schwle des Sommers getilgt
von eisiger Klte
Sturm zieht auf und das Land erzittert
Vor den Boten der nahenden
Apokalypse...
Dann...setzt der Regen ein
Wie ein Sturzbach ffnet der Himmel seine Pforten...
Doch am Boden wandelt sich das Wasser
langsam zu Eis...
Und bedeckt das Land unter einer
Schicht aus Klte
..und alles was noch atmet
Droht zu ersticken...
Dies...ist...das Ende... <start> Mercenary men knock you dead
Killing for a living is what is said
Disposing of people blood money pays
Gruesome executions are used this waty
Gruesome tasks
Slaughters made
They create
Screams of pain
Limbs cut off sliced to death
Stomach ripped open no life left
Glistening drops of butchery
Their salvation misery
The blood of men is spilled to be
payed with cash
When they die the payment is made
Their salvation misery
Shattered lives are lost
Crimes of death do cost
Death forgotten too fast
The pain of the past <start> Lift me out of this struggle
Lift me out on the other side
with all these signs of a trial
nothing will keep it open
suicides and murder are revolting
the day has changed it's through
Lift up your memories
Lift them out off of the floor
Your scars aren't of this world
we'll take them down
the hills are sopping with blood
it's the dead horizon
you never stop making me scream
lift me up these scars stay true
you're to beautiful to wake up
through my death of the accursed fire
your sudden cries cant stop me
yes. your silence
yes it is
before daylight broke now
the bones lie forever
your sins understand violence
your sins lay on the floor
the stars
die down
requesting
we die
the stars
at night
have suffered
without
you witness it bad
you have demon handcuffs
you're trapped
and so is the key in the station
lies
in the future with us
the bomb runners
the bomb runners
one by one we'll kill each other
without much at hand
and open up the earth but
find us
your day of stature
one by one we'll kill each other
without much at hand
and open up the earth
one by one we will all die
one by one we will all die
i will die
i will die
the
earth
starts
to ignite
do
you
euphemize
with fire
do you not fear this blade
i'll teach you its embrace
your pain what you hate
your stricken day has come in full
do you feel fear at new heights
you fight so good its tipping the scale
why do we race you're so poisened

Where are the stars
Where are the stars
Where are the stars
Where are the stars
the stars grow old
when these stars grow old
feel the pain in these stars
but they wont die
forever
they'll stay
forever
thats where i'll stay
BEFORE DAYLIGHT BREAKS <start> Move it to the front
Reaching for the light
Loosin' all control
Using all your might
Wheels are gonna spin
Asses gonna shake
We are gonna kick
Walls are gonna break
The road is hard
The fight is tough
Gonna play it fast
She likes it rough
With my strength
With all my soul
Makin' love
I'm losing control
Guts begin to churn
Minds are in a haze
Hell is gonna burn
Axes in a blaze
Go in for the kill
Always on the run
Fighting for you life
The battle's never won
The road is hard
The fight is tough
Gonna play it fast
She likes it rough
With my strength
With all my soul
Makin' love
I'm losing control
Move it to the front
Reaching for the light
Losin' all control
Using all your might
Wheels are gonna spin
Asses gonna shake
We are gonna kick
Walls are gonna break
Backs are turned
Rock an' roll
To the wall
I'm losing my mind
Yea
Hey hey <start> Trying to run from what you are
Afraid of being alive
Hands shaking body aching
The abuse left a permanent scar
So now to get by you do whatever it takes
You need your reality to hit your veins again
Don't try to blame anyone
Your blame is self chosen
Don't come looking for sympathy
'Cause you won't get it from me
You're nothing but a burned out wreck
That solves problems with another hit
The remedy in a bag
Served up on a spoon
Starts to serve it's purpose
To kill the pain
Looking for the utopia you found the first time
Will you ever get there again
Increase the dose and soon you'll find out
Was it too much or just enough
The chemical satan has got you in his hell
Don't you think you're better off dead
Don't try to blame anyone
Your pain is self chosen
Don't come looking for sympathy
'Cause you won't get it from me
You're nothing but a burned out wreck
That solves problems with another hit
The remedy in a bag
Served up on a spoon
Starts to serve it's purpose
To kill the pain
I need to kill the pain kill it again
Need to release my pain kill myself again
Traded your life for a fix
The remedy in a bag
Served up on a spoon
Starts to serve it's purpose
To kill the pain
I need to
Release my pain
Help me to
Kill the pain <start> Nowadays people have to be confronted
Visually before they start worrying
About the problems that they refuse to see
As nonexistent or overrated newspaper announcements
How many kids aged around  know what a condom looks like
Desire scores higher rates than selfprotection
I share this idea must tell that AIDS has to be taken
Out of the silence in which it sneaks
Look at you. You're big now
Adolescence conflict. You're big now
Spring time roll the drums
Their new shoes are ready for the first steps
Middle finger in the air
They don't care what's wrong on this big ball
One thing we seem to forget
Were we better in our teens  NO
You're big now 
So we fall and stand up for the struggle of life
We learn the law of body communication
We don't know how to react
And tell me who did  When they were doing it for the first time
Then be careful where you go
This disease is searching for victims
This brand new pesticide
Is already reigning outrageous
So be be aware
Play it safe and forsee addiction
You can make love not war
Don't let it come that far
That AIDS is the one who's outliving
Expectations of a certain life style
Do you agree when decisions are taken for you
Married children tradition prove you're big now
Married children tradition and how do you feel now 
So tell me how do you feel
So we fall and stand up for the struggle of life
We learn the law of body communication
We don't know how to react
Who did  When they were doing it for the first time
Look at you. You're big now
Adolescence conflict. You're big now <start> I am the son and daughter
Im the only child of father that breeds you
I watch from above seeing my blood feed the roses
giving you the cross
A step closer I fight not while you
While you pound that nail in me
I suffer the sins of the world may as a splinters
of the woodthe lashes on the whip on my back
A thorned crown on my head fuzzes my way of thinking
Like a human
Watching the sponge of sorrows
Floating its way into my mouth
And the lance of greed piercing my side
I cannot breath
I fly as God as I am the seprent below
The rainbow above the bondage to temptation is broken
After nights and days that I promised I walk
Again on the Earth
Through the hole in my hand I watch
I watch your fear
When the lord of fire shall come He will tear sky and earth apart
Fly the way to the rainbowonly it shines after every storm
Children of Death resurrect
Ascend to me and cryyou are free <start> Dying is easy
It's living that's hard
It's so disturbing to hear what you're fearing
Rain of terror out in the cold
Give 'em what they want
Give 'em what they need
Pure sincerity
Pure sincerity
It's what made me born from insanity
Pure sincerity
Pure
Questions asked the answers come quickly
Remorse can be so dangerous
Wolf in the fold terror within
Out in the cold
Give 'em what they want
Give 'em what they need
Pure sincerity
Pure sincerity
It's what made me born from insanity
Pure sincerity
The things I am
The things that I've become
The wings of honor
Son of Father
Don't know if I can stand
Where I once fucking stood
If I could if I could
Don't you think I fucking would
Things to come it must be from the heart
Things to come
Are these shadows of things from the past
Are these the shadows of things to come
Things come to come
Things to come
Where do we go
Where do we go
Pure sincerity
Pure sincerity
It's what made me born from insanity
Pure sincerity <start> Instrumental <start> Ever since the fall I've abandoned all the shadows...replacing history with moral victories
And this light around my body and what it seems to be
I'm still coming clean...tonight
When we fall from grace we must rise from the dead...
And it's all just going away the way I see it it's the hardest thing I'll ever find myself
And its here we fear the most...And there's nothing that can dim this light at least from this distance
All that I've become from the greatest of my failures
Casting glory from the reflections of my fate
And this light around my body and what it seems to be I'm still coming clean...tonight
When we fall from grace we must rise from the dead
And its all just going away the way I see it it's the hardest thing I'll ever find myself
And it's here we fear the most...
It's all just going away the way I see it and its fear we fear
And there's nothing that can dim this light at least from this distance
I've made amends
Looked past the coast to no end
I've seen beyond the falling sky
And in my escape the road behind comes crashing. I'm not afraid to die...
When we fall from grace we must rise from the dead
And its all just going away the way I see it it's the hardest thing I'll ever find myself
And it's here we fear the most...
It's all just going away the way I see it and its fear we fear
And there's nothing that can dim this light. <start> Unless another wall is breaking
Nothing can come of this elusive
Against our better judgement
 our image to stand ground
turn around and
Break the path and let's get going
to the place where nobody ever goes
Break the path and let's get going
to the place where nobody ever goes
nobody ever goes
With ideals as infestations
hinder the radical mind
retune our aim
Now it's time for hiding
for it stabs fear in you
so coward
Break the path and let's get going
to the place where nobody ever goes
Break the path and let's get going
to the place where nobody ever goes
nobody ever goes
A thought to infect you
an idea to perfect you
A flesh to restrain you
no heart to forgive you
The poison well
I dried
Break the path and let's get going
to the place where nobody ever goes
Break the path and let's get going
to the place where nobody ever goes
nobody ever goes <start> I'm big I whack off in the heat
I'm real macho Master Yoda here I come
The Yoda puppet's out on loan
But the guy who played the robot might be available for work
Somebody will do it to you
And if they don't you will <start> praying to the wretched beasts
maybe they can forgive
the warriors of haunted souls
and common mavericks
sorrows of their inner lifes
hope burned down in flames
a king would trade his finest crown
to get out of their way
hearts will break a thousand times
not even just in dreams
guns will wait a thousand nights
gone with the wind
gone with the wind
dying with their boots on
the shadows of the proud
still sounding in their ears
the mating call of gold
places of immortality
millions sacred tombs
no medicine will ever heal
that never healing wounds
hearts will break a thousand times
not even just in dreams
guns will wait a thousand nights
gone with the wind
gone with the wind
upon a land where glory lies
the might of suns and moons
eternally under the sky
covered by the truth
when gods would lay their weapons down
and no more war to fight
you'll see em at the long horizon
finally unite
gone with the wind
gone with the wind <start> Working for life
Till death do us part
Living for work and no chance to hide
Fighting for us
In the arena of life
My aim is you and my sword is my pride
Working for life 
Fighting for us 
One day a hero
Till death do us part
Every day danger
For one day a hero
One day a killer and one day a victim <start> Strain You can resist the
A gun in hand can make you believe
In everything that's meant to deceive
A trigger and an eye for disease
Conditioned to resist the machine
I'm not afraid to live this way
I lived through pain
Resisted all the strain
Conditioned to believe in nothing
Now that I can see
The truth behind the deceit
Nothing now can ever stop me
Never stop me
Strain You can resist the
Elusive I am so hard to trace
A slap of fear across your face
A weapon to cleanse this waste
To overcome this gutwrenching place
I'm not afraid to live this way
I lived through pain
Resisted all the strain
Conditioned to believe in nothing
Now that I can see
The truth behind the deceit
Nothing now can ever stop me
Never stop me
Strain You can resist the <start> The trip begins again
I can't release the voices never be the same
Silence is my friend...no more
Mind's I
I can't take anymore choking on my apathy
Words that I say don't mean a damn thing to me
Someone else is in here hiding
Pain is truth the truth is painful
I the one in constant carnage
I the two behind the mask
Living in here within my consciousness
Awaken me from the voices of my obsession
Awaken me
I of mind's eye
I of the storm
The Trip begins again
I abandon you and who you are inside
A part of me apart from you
We are dust the walls we've seen will fall
Forever
I of mind's eye
I of the storm
I the one beyond redemption
I the two without the mask
The world we see the world we see
Has turned on you on you and me
The trip begins again <start> I dance every morning till the sun goes down
I laugh loud as long the world turns round
The end draws near every evening day by day
Come dance with me it is too late.
The world is black it's the way it should be
There's not much time left to shoe emotions
And so we dance joyfully into the end
Come with me I'm prepared
And laughing we dance into the darkness.
Life is seldom beautiful
Be patient one day you will comprehend
Everyday humanity dies
To love somebody there's not much time
New born megalomanice to possess
To rule is to blame. <start> Decide
It's now the time to make up your mind
Today's the day you'll hopefully find that freedom is granted
Our sentence has passed and now we are floating towards the light
And as I fall I rue my mistakes and my soul fade
I want to be where our dreams first met tonight
And as I fall into the sea the waves consume me
I want to be where our dreams first met
We wore our hearts around our necks
Here I lay under the sun that burns my wings
Our dreams are broken for all of our faith has been taken away
Take me to the sun far and far beyond the clouds
Forever captured in your mind
When you look to the sky I'm in your eyes
And one day I'll take you there
To the point on the map where the sea meets the sky

Bring me the sun the light trough the rain
I made a pact the promise was set
Our efforts will not be in vain
And as I fall into the sea the waves consume
I want to be where our dreams first met
We wore our hearts around our necks
If I gave you a chance would you open your arms wide
If I gave you a chance would you open your arms wide
If I gave you a chance would you open your arms wide
Here I lay under the sun that burns my wings
Our dreams are broken for all of our faith has been taken away
Take me to the sky and far beyond the clouds
Forever captured in your mind
When you look to the sky I'm in your eyes <start> Flower girls play lover
Grave games in the courtyard
I heard her
Screaming like a radio
Mary Lou left marks on you
She just screams at the walls
The kite string pops I'm swallowed whole by the sky
We smoke the bones of baby dolls
Techno liquid screaming meat
Heavens cold beneath my feet
Cyber love the antiman
We make love because we can
Virgins play whore the bayous blue
Barefoot  eatin' mushroom stew
Work  pay pay  freedom
Fuck them all cause we don't need 'em
Everything's gone dry
Like bottle glass scraping cross the pavement <start> Instrumental <start> Instrumental <start> It comes from the depths
of a place unknown to the
keeper of dreams
if it could then it would steal
the sun and the moon from the sky
beware
Human at sight monster at heart
don't let it inside it could
tear you right apart
No guilt it feeds in plain sight
Spirit Crusher
Stay strong and hold on tight
Spirit Crusher
Speaking in killing words
The vicious kind that crush and kill
no mercy its pleasure to taste
The blood that it bled.
When it's time to feed to fulfill
the need to consume a breath
some will rise standing tall
breathing out all the breath from
the voice of a soul. <start> Music by Sanrabb
Lyrics by Sanrabb
In total control
total supremacy
Terror spreads with increasing speed
Towards the west from the east
Soldiers scream out in fascination
Caused by horror beyond their imagination
Killing humanity in one glorious moment of passion
Sought pleasure in that one moment of total satisfaction
Call out for global suicide
Mankind's only saviour from life
Humanity wondering what went wrong
Dying whilst the warmachine rolls on
Euthanasia killing out of sympathy
Saving humanity from its overwhelming stupidity
Thousands die by the second
Millions die by the minute
Nations die by the hour
All hail the rise of nuclear power
Humanity wondering what went wrong
Dying whilst the warmachine rolls on
Humanity wondering what went wrong
Humanity fellating the barrel of a gun
Thousands die by the second
Millions die by the minute
Nations die by the hour
All hail the rise of nuclear power <start> I lost my temper with a friend
Mocked him and treated him with rudeness
And though I tried to make amends
Still I miss him I walk a dark corridor
Woke up one morning
Doctor Buck's letter
Of my own making I walk a dark corridor Oh my heart
Hoping one day a door will be ajar
At least so we can recompense
The betrayal of our hard won friendship
In vulgar and arrogant abeyance
To what was untrue underneath our parlance
I open the envelope Doctor Buck's letter
Re Welfare Benefits reports
J. McCarthy approximately  days
I got down I was depressed.
It was Doctor Buck's letter.
Turn the radio on
Doctor Buck's Letter
Cheer myself up
Put the radio on get the magazine out
And read about the 'Essence of Tong'
Checklist
I never leave home without
 Sunglasses I wear them all year around I seem to need them more often it's a habit
 Music cassettes CDs
 Palm Pilot it's my lifeline I think it's my P.A.'s computer she rules my diary and I download it
 Mobile phone
 Amex card They made such a fuss about giving it to me that I spent more time getting it turned down.
I was in the realm of the essence of Tong. <start> Watching your empire fall
You'll never stop till you get what you want
You think you have control
You tried to take mine
But I won't leave till I get what I want
Over and over bending and breaking
Watching your empire fall
Watching the ashes fall
Will it ever cross your mind
I'm the man you'll never be
Think about me when you're all alone
Without someone to love

Am I gonna be the last one standing
How's it gonna feel when I'm on top
I guess I'll watch you walk away
Don't waste my time
You've got this upside down
What were you thinking of
What were you thinking of
You've got this upside down
What were you thinking of
What were you thinking of
Watching your empire fall
Watching the ashes fall
Will it ever cross your mind
I'm the man you'll never be
Think about me when you're all alone
Without someone to love
You're out there on your own
Am I gonna be the last one standing
How's it gonna feel when I'm on top
I guess I'll watch you walk away
And let your empire crumble
Am I gonna be the last one standing
How's it gonna feel when I'm on top
I guess I'll watch you walk away
And let your empire crumble
You decide what's next for us
Over and over you sold me out
You decide what's next for us
Over and over bending and breaking
You decide what's next for us
You decide what's next for us
You'll never learn
You never will
You'll never learn
You never will
You decide what's next for us
You decide what's next for us <start> Now the storm begins. It's been brewing from within
The seeds of revolution's been sown
The time is now our hearts have turned to stone
The fire that's rising will burn to the bone
The gathering of arms we're tearing down the wall
Storming the gates to our freedom
The rule of the depraved is coming to an end
The signal that's telling the world revolution it is coming
It is coming
The time has come
We've had enough we won't take anymore
You see us move in synchronicity
The noble blood will color the streets
We run amok we'll take the crown and we'll burn it down
The world is here to testify freedoms calling.
We break the gates take their heads we run amok
We run amok
Crimson clouds roll in a storm of hell awaits
Blood will fall like rain over the southern lands
The flame burns on black smoke rises again
Foretelling the future we fight to defend
The course of history will be written here today
Liberty waits for no tomorrow
Banners of unity held proudly in the air
The rule of corruption will end
Revolution it is coming. It is coming <start> Grow Old With Me
I know I play the same four chords
But I never wrote this song before
Last valentines when you weren't mine
I was laying on the couch getting
Fucking high
Grow old with me
Grow old wit me
If young hearts can dream
Then grow old with me
My yesterday's have lived and lost
My past has paid a heavy cost
And I'm never one the jump gun
But you're the first and last I want
To love
So tonight I got you and you and you got me
We're the perfect kind of crazy
The kind of love that never ages
So
Grow old with me
Grow old with me
If young hearts can dream
Grow old with me
Woah
Woah <start> No catharsis through scream
Too many ways too many truths
The myth of the reward and the punishment
Still feeds our fear
No to all of the masks of this world
No to the empty words
Open eyes look yet closed can truly see
Creeping vermin still cross their traces
Seeming movement of the elements
Does not chance the vision the throbbing whole
No to those that have seen and thus have believed
No to those that have not seen and yet have believed
Global negation of the visible existence
Is the delusion in itself
Yet the truth the animal eyes look to
Dies at the closed eyelid glance of spirit <start> words  music by Thomas C. Hansen
It's early in the morning
And the birds are singing high in the sky
I'm watching the sun arise
For the first time I am feeling alive
I never saw the sign that the world would come to an end
I could never understand why we all couldn't live in peace
We don't have much time
We all have to leave the world behind
When fire melts the ice
The only hope is here in paradise
When fire melts the ice
Nothing lasts forever
When fire melts the ice
A thunder storm is coming
The water is rising there's no way out
A fire is still burning
But very soon it all will be lost
I can never forget all the times that we spent together
I will never regret that I took a chance and met a stranger
We still have each other
Cause we made it through the storm <start> In a world
Where we think
That we've seen
Everything
In a world
Where we think
That we rise above
All things
In a time
That is so fast
You have to run
So you won't get lost
In a time
That is so loud
You have to scream
To get recognised...
In a land
Where you must fight
For a little Fragement
Of human right
In a system
That uses war
To spread its spirit
Around the globe
A religion
That uses hate
To plug its message
Into your brain
A revolution
That turns back time
Forgets what we have
Learned to be...
I'd like to say
I have to say
You...don't know nothin'
You...don't know nothin' about
You...don't know nothin'
You...don't know nothin' at all
A public
Where shoes do shine
And money beats
Respect for life
In a world
That is cleaned
Of all secrets
That nature kept
A public
Where death's reduced
To be excitement
In late night news
In a time
Where children learn
To ignore the world
Around them... <start> A celebration of the damned
The unfettered few who choose to roam
Sharing more than sexual excess
Sowing more than vexing stones
Favourite haunts of depravation
Where the morning fears to tread
Covenant revere the sullen cain
Strike the tethered liar dead
Dark solstice fever burns in me
Like the tugging of my veins to feed
Ravaging RavenLust
Unbridled at dusk <start> In between insidious vapor shall teem
Looming so loathesome
And it seems to me like I'm dead inside
Bloated corpse propped out of tradition
I can never recall what it was I had ever to strive for as a youth
Was it just to exist autonomously
No we don't want to work
We just want to fuck
Swallow pills and forget our curses
No we don't need pigs like you
We'll follow the laws of our emptying veins
In this world of nothing for me
I'd be sooner destroyed
Vampire youth raise your cups to the ne'er waning moon
Let its visage ring true
To the hearts cold and blue
We're dying each moment free
We're all animals here
Flesh and blood bone and dream
We're just impulses here
Another piece of shit in the storm
Just another piece of shit
From the smelling of things it appears this shit has come to a boil
The nighttime we shall rule as our own
While the hollow shall sleep
We shall bark at the moon
In this world of nothing for me
I'd be sooner destroyed
In this world there is nothing for us but the sound 
Vampire youth raise your cups to the ne'er waning moon
Let its visage ring true
To the hearts cold and blue
We're dying each moment
We'll never sleep again
We'll be going fucking mad
Sin and hell is all we will ever know
Just another piece of shit <start> Music Martin  Andreas
Lyrics Martin
In a sea of blood
People of sorrow
find their hell
Their purulent minds decay
Ocean of the dead
Evil trepidation
Eviscerate the corpses
Morbid devastation
After the holy massacre
rotten limbs are floating by
Evocation of aspiration
steaming sacrifice
oppressor of human race
The demigod shall arise
The wind from the upturned graves
Aspiration of darkness
Those who survived
will fall to pieces 
Ocean of the dead
Evil trepidation
Eviscerate the corpses
Morbid devastation
Hear the angels cry
Now the suffering
has came to its end
Evocation of aspiration
steaming sacrifice
oppressor of human race
The demigod shall arise <start> Waking up to face another nightmare day
Blood drips from the mouth my teeth decay
Deep depression is coming on fast
Got to get me my crystal breakfast
High chasing the high
Die chasing the high
High anxiety panic setting in
Will do anything to get the sin
Sunlight burning my eyes gotta fill the need
Methamphetamine it's time to feed
High chasing the high
Die chasing the high
Dying to feast
The monster is fed
Call for the priest
One more is dead
The chemical injection rushing through the vein
Speeding up the system and burning up the brain
Powered and invincible the pain is at an end
High above so beautiful the demon rides again
Time I get high
Time I get high
Cycle starting over but it's too late
Try it just one time it seals your fate
Deadly consequences you can't go back
Life is gone a heart attack
High chasing the high
Die chasing the high
Chasing the chasing the chasing the high <start> Turn me on let me feel you
Turn me on let me taste you
Boundaries are starting to fall
Conceiving has already started
Kissing caressing indulge
Is this really what you wanted
No I just don't know
If I can
No I just don't know
If I can
Is this really what you wanted
Is this really what you yeah
Even though I don't know you
I know for sure I love you
Anything that you'll ever need
I'll try my best to give everything
I tell myself its nothing
I tell myself its nothing almost nothing <start> And death lay in my arms as colors fade
From gold to gray
Gray now broken my foolishness displayed
Hands tight around her throat this violent loving embrace
Lying restful safe in my arms
Steady rhythm trust she'll come to no harm
Feel her tremble as the nightmare begins
Sleep the horror as the nightmare it ends
I hear her whisper a sweet sound
Fanning the flames
These thoughts consume me and leave me wallowing <start> I wanna kill you yes I wanna do it
I hate you you are a piece of shit
It's time to your muthafuckin' die
This is a fuckin' question that why
You know it I know it is this right
What I want is a muthafuckin' fight
Between you and me F.I.G.H.T.
The question is to be or not to be
I only can say that get the fuck out
And do not open your muthafuckin' mouth
I hate you I hate you yes I do
I'll kick your head it's said but true
I'll knock you out so come on let's fight
There's nobody on your muthafuckin' side
I'm angry and hungry and want you to die
Just say your life goodbye and cry
You wanted to be
My enemy  It's on
So leave me alone
The hate I have is a negative power
I am strong 'cause I know you're sucka
I am strong like my man Shaq
I'll beat you down with a hard attack
You make me sick your head like a dick
Now you can't play your dirty trick
'Cause you haven't got muthafuckin' time
What I will do it's the perfect crime <start> I will tell you the story of the surprise on that day
I will tell why I am doing so
I did not expect a thing
And it's a wonderful thing for my way of life
He said Do you wanna touch the star
Do you wanna shine more than ever
I said I wanna do so by all meanings.
I thought such a chance was rare
I got excited very much
At that time...
I didn't hesitate to make up my mind
Now I feel the change slowly but surely
Oh Can I catch the star like everyone else
I know I should 'cause I wanna get it
Ready Fly high
Burn my heart into eternity
Satisfy everyonethat's the mission to myself
Burn my fearoh I'll never return to the past
Get your soul take your soul
Let's blaze up at this time
What will I be able to do I am still looking for that
It's like a treasure hunt it's not easy
It is waiting in the other side
Anyway I should hurry up
I remember...
Getting over many difficulties in the past
But this time is more serious for me
Oh Can I catch the star like everyone else
I know I should 'cause I wanna get it
Ready Fly high
Burn my heart into eternity
Satisfy myselfthat's the mission to myself
Burn my fearoh I'll never return to the past
Get your soul take your soul

I will satisfy you I promise it to you
Get your soul take your soul
Let's show our soul...
Blaze up now <start> The day has ended
I lay awake
A soft glow over my shoulder
Wake tomorrow and then it's all the same
And I'll destroy the memories one by one
The bitter past erased
I'll not replace
What's done is done
No belief is all that's left and I do not regret
The darkness welcomes me back home
And I am still my own
Can't take away Repeat x
And I feel the pain still deeply
It seems sometimes too much to bear
I have a core within me still
My strength is there
And I'll destroy the memories one by one
The bitter past erased
I'll not replace
What's done is done
No belief is all that's left and I do not regret
The darkness welcomes me back home
And I am still my own Can't take away Repeat x
And I can't be made less
I know who I am
And I am still my own <start> Aus einer wass'rigen
Andacht in dreifaltiger
Hinsicht erwacht
Verleiht Apfelsaft
dem absonderlichen
Grauen eine seltsam
schreiende Erblast
Zur blut'gen Verkettung
Titangeschwangerter
Wollust verdunkeln tanzelnde
Wascheklammern
ein rostiges Mosaik
auf sich stumm
bewegenden Lippen
Und der durchlauchte
Unterschied in einer stets
ungeliebten Welle
verblasst im Fegefeuer
des kleinen Todes
Wie der Mensch so
stirbt sein Wasser
und Christus ward
oftmals begraben
in urkomischer Abendmahle
Moge der einst gebogene
Schadelknochen
uber die Spitze
eines verlorenen
Messers erwachsen
English translate Dead White Marten
out of a watery devotion
in trinitious aspect awakened
grants apple juice
to the disgusting duke
a strangely crying hereditary burden
To the bloody chainment
of lust impregnated by Thanes
dancing clothespins darken
a Rusty Mosaic
upon quietly moving lips
And the leaking difference
in a permanently unloved wave
Fades in purgatory
of the little death
man dies like his water
And often Christ was buried
in a hilarious communion
May the once bent skull bone
grow above the top of a lost knife <start> And your spirit shall be alone deep sleep in dark forests
Let spirit keeps the silence you're alone but not forgotten
Death was beside you in your life death is beside you in your death
Do believe in it's power Bright night shall look frown
And only shining of the stars will not be dull
I will remind you of your destiny the thoughts you can't get off
The visions you can't scatter away from your spirit the sighs of Gods.
The distant wind the roar the mists on the grey swamps
And shadow keeps its gloom and misery of death <start> No sign of life did flicker
In floods of tears she cried
All hope's lost it can't be undone
They're wasted and gone
Save me your speeches
I know 
What you want
You will take it away from me
Take it and I know for sure
The light she once brought in
Is gone forevermore
Like sorrowful seaguls they sang
 lost in the deep shades
The misty cloud brought

Monstrous it covered the shore
Fearful into the unknown
Quietly it crept in new horror
Insanity reigned
And spilled the first blood
When the old king was slain
Nightfall
Quietly crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Quietly crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Immortal land lies down in agony
How long shall we
Mourn in the dark
the bliss and the beauty
Will not return
Say farewell to sadness and grief
Though long and hard the road may be
But even in silence I heard the words
An oath we shall swear
By the name of the one
Until the world's end
It can't be broken
Just wondering how
I can still hear these voices inside
The doom of the Noldor drew near
The words of a banished king
I swear revenge
Filled with anger aflamed our hearts
Full of hate full of pride
We screamed for revenge
Nightfall
Quietly crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Quietly crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Immortal land lies down in agony
Vala he is that's what you said
Then your oath's been sworn in vain
 freely you came and
You freely shall depart
 never trust the northern winds
Never turn your back on friends
Oh I'm heir of the high lord
You better don't trust him
The enemy of mine
Isn't he of your kind and
Finally you may follow me
Farewell
He said
Nightfall
Quietly crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Quietly crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Immortal land lies down in agony
Back to where it all began <start> You can die screaming
Or you can give me what I want
I'm gonna get it get it either way
And I can't let it be
Viciously
Relentless pursuit of vengeance
And I won't let it be
Viciously
Impaled
You all shall hail
You're just a bag of blood and I'm holding the nail
You gotta believe you gotta believe
Impaled
And I never fail
You're just a bag of blood and I'm holding the nail
You gotta believe you gotta believe
You're slowly dying
There's no more lying
I'm not your friend I never was I work alone
And I won't let it go 'cause you're so
Brutal
In your refusal
I just won't let it be
Viciously
Impaled
You all shall hail
You're just a bag of blood and I'm holding the nail
You gotta believe you gotta believe
Impaled
And I never fail
You're just a bag of blood and I'm holding the nail
You gotta believe you gotta believe
Impaled
The holy grail
Your goddamned soul is my white whale
You gotta believe you gotta believe
Impaled
And you all shall hail
You're just a bag of blood and I'm holding the nail
You gotta believe you gotta believe in me
In the small numbers when order sleeps
And the streets are mine
It's a time and a place where I can thrive
And burn you with my demon eye
In my life the things I've seen
Inhumanly brutal the worst extreme
I torture me because I can
Obscene the soul of every man
In my life the things I've seen
Inhumanly brutal the worst extreme
I torture you because I can
I've seen the soul of every man
Is fucking damned to a fate
And dead if you don't and damned if you do
And dead if you won't
Impaled

You gotta believe you gotta believe

My Life Belongs To You <start> In fact it was close to a real fallout
Everything's under control
The speaker said with a serious smile
Behind his mask
He knew the truth
I'll bring a new age of better ways
The TV preacher said
Just pay today
Pay today
World's dressed in black
On earth's judgement day
And I
I know it can't go on
Forbidden signs increase
I'm sitting still at home
And watching
Born in a mourning hall
Pale clouds feared the unborn child
Then it grew up with growing plans
Of suicide
Born in a mourning hall
Shadows left the fear inside
That Peter Pan will never reach
The other side
It's frightening
Exciting to sit at home
And watch the burning fields
Get
Hypnotized by the TV snake
Obey and work hard
And feel no anger
Just sympathy for the higher class
There's no chance in changing things
'Cause I am
Born in a mourning hall
Silent cries ran out
When the cradle breaks
Broken dreams were unheared on
The other side
Born in a mourning hall
Shadows left the fear
In the new born child
That Peter Pan will never reach
The other side
And I'm a part of the machine
A puppet on the strings
A rebel once
Now I'm an old man
Oh I know this can't go on
But the ghost called fear inside
Lames my tongue my nerves my mind
Eternal fall down
Someone cut the strings off
I can't move
To get back courage
I've to face the truth
But not today
Goodbye
Born in a mourning hall
Caught inside a web called life
The only way to get out soon
Is suicide
Born in a mourning hall
Pale souls built a frozen world
Infected brains
Will never reach the other side
The other side <start> I am the heart of battle
I am the arm of warriors
My father he gave me the heavens
My father he gave me the earth
He who was alive yesterday
He who was alive is dead today
The thunders of wrath and judgement are numbered
And harbored in the earth so open the gates
The voices travel with the wind  listen feel it's power
Fear is not for in time it will reveal the true powers
The powers and the might of the black divine
The luminescence of darkness
Chaos  void of creation
Chaos  rise
I am the one who comes forth of frost and show
With a shadow cast and soon unveils
The northern darkness glory
I am the angel that never felt
All the mysteries are mine
I lead you to rebirth though death and destruction
Just take my hand
For I am the angel that never left
All the mysteries are mine
I lead you to rebirth though death and destruction
I am the one who comes forth of frost and show
With a shadow cast now I unveil all
The northern darkness glory
Creation  understanding
Destruction  transformation
Renewal  wisdom
Just take my hand
Chaos  void of creation chaos rise
Chaos  it is done <start> The ivory is cold where is my desire
In a cage of gold not a trace of fire
Ice cold as ice. I'm heading for tomorrow
I am tired of waiting. I'll beg and steal and borrow
Life is too short to be wasted
So why do I sit around
Dance on the edge of a razor
Get off the ground and I'll never return
Walk on fighting
Don't look ever back
Walk on fighting
Don't you look back to your cries
The phone it waits in silence no message left by you
There is no use in crying. I know I've been a fool
Now it's too late no words left to say
I gotta call it late Forget and look away
Life is too short to be wasted
So why do I sit around
Dance on the edge of a razor
Get off the ground and I'll never return
Walk on fighting... <start> Billy Idol cover
Last night a little dancer came dancin' to my door
Last night a little angel came pumping on the floor
She said come on baby I got a license for love
And if it expires pray help from above
Because
In the midnight hour she cried more more more
With a rebel yell she cried more more more
In the midnight hour babe more more more
With a rebel yell more more more
More more more
She don't like slavery she won't sit and beg
But when I'm tired and lonely she sees me to bed
What set you free and brought you to me babe
What sets you free I need you hear by me
Because
In the midnight hour she cried more more more
With a rebel yell she cried more more more
In the midnight hour babe more more more
With a rebel yell more more more
He lives in his own heaven
Collects it to go from the seven eleven
Well he's out all night to collect a fare
Just so long just so long it don't mess up his hair
I walked the ward with you babe
A thousand miles with you
I dried your tears of pain babe
A million times for you
I'd sell my soul for you babe
For money to burn for you
I'd give you all and have none babe
Justa justa justa justa to have you here by me
Because
In the midnight hour she cried more more more
With a rebel yell she cried more more more
In the midnight hour babe more more more
With a rebel yell she cried more more more
More more more
Oh yeah little baby
She want more
More more more more more
Oh yeah little angel
She want more
More more more more more <start> Fifteen years in the academy
He was like no cadet they'd ever seen
A man so hard his veins bleed ice
And when he speaks he never says it twice
They call him judge his last name is dredd
So break the law and you wind up dead
Truth and justice are what he's fighting for
Judge dredd the man he is the law
Drokk it
With gun and bike he rules the streets
And every perp he meets will taste defeat
Not even death can overcome his might
Cause dredd and anderson they won the fight
When the sov's started the apocalypse war
Megacity was bombed to the floor
Dredd resisted and the judges fought back
Crushed the sov's with their counterattack
Drokk it
Respect the badge  he earned it with his blood
Fear the gun  your sentence may be death because...
Chorus
I am the law
And you won't fuck around no more  I am the law
I judge the rich I judge the poor  I am the law
Commit a crime I'll lock the door  I am the law
Because in megacity... I am the law
In the cursed earth where mutants dwell
There is no law just a living hell
Anarchy and chaos as the blood runs red
But this would change if it was up to dredd
The book of law is the Bible to him
And any crime committed is a sin
He keeps the peace with his lawgiver
Judge jury and executioner
Drokk it
Crime  the ultimate sin
Your isocube is waiting when he brings you in
Law  it's what he stands for
Crime's his only enemy and he's going to war
Crime  the ultimate sin
Your isocube is waiting when he brings you in
Law  it's what he stands for
Crime's his only enemy and he's going to war <start> Let me relate you to something
Maybe a piece of myself
Im so lonely I dont know why
I dont know why I feel so much aversion for those I look alike

How foolish a man can be
Closing my eyes I recollect remembering those Glory Days
Looking for something different intact extravagant
Leading me to entireness
Its so difficult to overtake the time lying on to your dreams
But more difficult is to find one to trust in good and bad times
I made the final mistake
To believe everything around me as true
Betraying my secrets to the Wrong
I got to be their slave
Like a fading flower I feel to myself
to be as pure as them
My only acquisition along with the black thoughts
Was my own flesh
Isolationthe only way to escape
Betraying dreams and myself
And now living lonely in this town
I try to live again screaming silently for my lost dreams <start> Your mom didn't tell you
You'd have nothing to say
Shut the fuck up bitch
In a poisoned state
While the rapist behind you
Is whispering your name
My lies foreshadow me
They make a scab of me
I can't crawl through this
You can't shut me up
You can't shut me up
Make it rough
What
Difficulty breathing makes you drip
Swallowing on first dates entertains
I scream mistakenly
I'm trying to make you see
What makes him resent you
That's right I lie
Solid filth til I die
But it makes me smile
Lord of the elite
Is prince of the cowards
Try not to choke on it
You can't shut me up
You can't shut me up
Make it rough
What
Difficulty breathing makes you drip
Swallowing on first dates entertains
Misogynist attracted to you
Wallowing in pity's comfortable
What
Get up <start> I got a letter in the mail just the other day
Opened it up this is what it had to say
Wouldn't you please give us the pleasure
Of having you at our table tonite
From the donner family
We've been hungry for such a long time
And we've eaten our dogs and rawhide
We've got half of our family on ice
They would not want the rest of us to die
They would not want the rest of us to die
They don't care
They would not have us starve to death
We're so cold
We're freezing and there's nothing left
They don't care
I'm sure that they wouldn't mind
It's so bad
Half of us are snow blind
It's too late now we can never go back
We can make up for the protein we lack
Four days of no food have left us all weak
I feel like I can't stand on my own two feet
My own two feet my own two feet
We've been waiting for such a long time
For some word of help or some sign
That someone's coming to our rescue
Until then we'll do what we have to
Until then we'll do what we have to
They don't care
They would not have us die this way
It's like this
We have to find some food today
They don't care
They knew what we were going through
They don't care
This is what it's come to
We never felt like we could really do it
Now weare just thankful we all lived through it
We ate those people because we were hungry
Yeah we're survivors of the donner family
The donner family
We've been hungry for such a long long time
And we've eaten our dogs and rawhide
We've got half of our family on ice
They would not want the rest of us to die
They would not want the rest of us to die
They don't care
They would not have us starve to death
We're so cold
We're freezing and there's nothing left
They don't care
I'm sure that they wouldn't mind
It's so bad
Half of us are snow blind
I got a letter in the mail just the other day
Opened it up this is what it had to say

Lyrics brecht <start> First off
you've got ze answer
Misereen all its skin
Bug day
Bug day
Midges  midges hovered over the heather
 moths shivered
Green moths shivered
Cockroaches moldered in the ground
Tonguehorns belched fire
So fleed at sea
Terrors hit water
Minoa said 'eek'
Minoa said 'eek'
Sea reaffirms some things
We learned some things
People behave very wrong
Create company
Green is starboard back
Left is port there
Old continental women
Coffee cups poised on front
Facing up to the sea is a very hard thing
Facing up to sea is a v. hard thing
Anything is better than bug day
Bug day
Bug day
Bug day
But day
mumbles
Bug day
Anything is better than bug day
Bug day
Bug day <start> At night high up in the heavens we fight
Faster than lightning we strike
Like fires that rip through the night
Surrounded by light
Raging thunder in the skies
Time has come to sacrifice
We are warriors
Born from the light
An army for freedom
Defenders of life
Warriors
Euphoria will rise
Returning from darkness
We bury all lies
The knights
Outcast and lost in the skies
Returning to heaven denied
Louder than thunder we ride
Ready to strike
Call for us and you will survive
Follow us to paradise
We are warriors
Born from the light
An army for freedom
Defenders of life
Warriors
Euphoria will rise
Returning from darkness
We bury all lies
Here we are
The warriors of light
Here we are
We came from the night
Here we are
The warriors of light
Here we are euphoria will rise <start> Nr skymningen Faller anlnder Han
Fr att skrda frukt jag ltit gro i Hans namn
En mnniska vit och blek som elfenben
P ett altare skuret ut ur stenen
Hrd och kall ur Bergets kam
Som en sista Gva till gunst fr Hans famn
Lt mig se lt mig knna Din hand i min
Med klor som skr djupt i mitt skinn
Vad det rtt vg att ta Nu nr slutet r hr
Pltsligt tvekar jag  Nr jag slits isr
Mtet r det frsta i sitt slag
Och frn och med morgondagen
Skall jag leva fr Hans synd
Men nr kpan Han faller till marken
Ser jag kvinnan framfr mig
Jag ltit drpa s grymt...
...Hon ser p mig och ler
Den fauna jag kltt Hennes nakna kropp med
Hnger nnu frn Hennes hr
Och axlar ner p Hennes bara ben
Hon ser p mig och ppnar sen
Kften sin likt ett rovdjur trstar efter Livets Vin
Av alla synder jag begtt
Var aldrig ngon lika grym som den hr
Fr sent frstr jag att jag sjlv
nu fallit offer fr min Tro
Jag trodde mig ha  Jag trodde mig frst
Den svartkonst jag sr <start> Tommy ain't my motherfuckin' boy
When you fake moves on a nigga you employ
We'll all emerge off your set now you know God damn
I show living large niggas how to flip a def jam
And rough up the motherfuckin' house cause I smother
You cold chillin' motherfuckers I still warn a brother
I'm ruthless my clan don't have to act wild
That shit is jive an old sleeping bag profile
The soft comedian rap shit ain't the rough witty
On the reel to reel it wasn't from a tough city
Niggas be game thinking that they lyrical surgeons
They know they microphone's a virgin
And if you ain't boned a mic you couldn't hurt a bee
That's like going to Venus driving a mercury
The capitol of this rugged slang is WuTang
Witty unpredictable talent and natural game
I death row an mc with mic cables
The epic is that I rush associated labels
From east west to atco I bring it to a next plateau
But I keep it phat though yo
I'm hitting batters up with the wild pitch style
I even show an Uptown MC a style
Who thought he saw me on th  Broadway
But I was out on the island bombing MC's all day
My priority is that I'm first priority
I bone the secret out a bitch in a sorority
So look out for AM the Abbot and the Master
Breaking down your pendulum
As I fiend MC's out with a blow that'll numb the
Appendix I'm holding more more weight than Colombia
Index Interscope we RCA clan
That's coming with a plan to free a
Slave of a mental death MC don't panic
Throw that AR nigga off the boat in the Atlantic
Now who's the bad boy character not from Arista
But firing weapons released on Geffen
So duck as I struck with the soul of Motown
My central broadcasting systems is low down
And dirty like that bastard
It's getting drastic <start> Join us into hresholds of moonless light
Xekonaphim paints your worshipped wheel of flames
Incendere Magi Hortus Rosarum
Black roses laced with silver
are now the ashes of Heximeth
The sten stars of Assiah wonders
why the meadows are torched
The holocaust of Atu brings down the pyre of Chokmah
Chokmah fills lust into the virgin stream 
A Heximethian spirit looks below the edge of a cliff
...and watches the thieves of serpents

Join us into tresholds of moonless light
Xekonaphim paints your worshipped wheel of flames
Incedere Magi Hortus Rosarum
The sun of Tipareth's circle arouses the warlock and seed
Sephiroth plants your heart to grow his oak of VITRIOL
Sepher Yetzirah is the deepest root of Atu
the sun of Tiphareth's circle dances until it falls
Tiphareth
Your lordship is the sixth sword
that triumphs teh jagged blade
Strike it downward to a rusty point
...and burn the earth as roses burn in the meadow
Come forth o serpent and take your fill of poison
I am above you and I am inside you
My fierce eroticism is in yours
For he is ever a sun
and for he is the winged secret flame
I am the snake that kissed Gehenna's own worm
I giveth knowledge and delight to the ones
Black roses laced with silver are now the ashes of Heximeth
The ten stars of Assiah wonders why meadows are torched <start> Entren los que se atreven

Perniciow existence
corrupt and deprived
the webs of superiority
an entire race enslaved
Human supremacy
So puny as flies
What you call democracy
Is what I call a lie lie
Observing from the spheres
the witness of the shame
the verdict called extinction
will end this flux of pain
Sick of your infantilism
dignity unknown
raise my hammer of justice
to krush the planet below
through time came no progression
intelligence misused
community of savages
ignorant and confused
Laughable little world
pile of defecation
never found the harmony
choking in economy
in fire began the chaos
and flames will start the end
aversion brought the sentence
celestial revenge
The final explosion
life vapourized
shreds of the earth
the madness has died <start> This one this one so fresh I'm still reading it off the paper man
it's just one of dem' nights you you know fuck it
if ya'll don't never hear nothing again from me
you know it was said here
right over here
My people screamed for revenge
So Fiend was called upon
Job description was get it on
Protect your mental heart and your dome
You may die cause' of your tone
Young black and strong
I was meant and sent
Cause' some of the real was all gone
Since birth til' now I got holes in my Tshirt
From fighting with anybody that wants to see me hurt
Took it needle and blood
Second and first love
Fuck giving a fuck
Blame me not the drugs
I motivates myself
Grab a rocket off my shelf
A extra match and now I'm feeling like myself
Without help I could spot and just kill a decoy
Really end what i destroyed

Man I ain't got no million dollars
I'm still in the ghetto
Hear me holler
Mr.  dollar
Trying to break nobody's collar
Wanting to give the baby something to follow
But shit I'm smoking like coffee lids
Trying to deal with what is
Screaming letta nigga live
And don't kick the door in my crib
I was off he even found where I lived
Now is it a crime to be black
And walk the streets wit' cha' gat
To protect family knock somebody off the map
Distributing crack to put clothes on they back
I did it and still do it if that's where I'm at
But see I'm best where I'm at
Up in this sack right into this back wood
Wanting everyday to be that good

Yeah I been facing the depths of hell
For how long
 years
And I choose to speak my mind even if its my career
The only fear that i discovered ain't returned and ain't coming
And the faith that I have ain't in no car in no woman
Everyday I'm stumbling to a smarter me
A harder me
Revealing my strength for they try to swallow me
I done read what they didn't want me to read
Learn to need what they didn't want me to need
Shit look I really gotta house full of guns
A couch full of ones
Just in case I don't understand the outcome that life taught
Let me leave you with this thought
Why the lion needed courage and he already had heart....

Keep Lovin' You by Aaron Sledge Lyrics
Keep Lovin' You by Aaron Sledge Lyrics <start> Where do you see yourself
Answer this question
Are you residing amongst the introverts
Do your bowels swell
Behind enemy lines covert
All this has been felt
Continued to complain
Outlining the frames
Converted into saturated spores
This truth deranged
Is your faith restored
Inaccurate
More so than before
Fertilize the ground
That cultivates your assets
Symbols of excellence
I will secure thyself against the caskets
Rest not
The dwell within must grow
Persecution
Resolution
Disperse the clots
Withstand the blows
Endure the terrors
It is a strength that can't be tamed
The strength of things contained
Scold the vast offenses
Critical conditions
Defenseless
The stomach growls
Discipline
Chosen food for my survival
Setting the first example
Ample
Overcome with the challenges
Of a contaminated vision
Never the less
Always the more
Layers beneath
Swallow
Digest
Sprouting the roots that produce
Milk from the breast
Flow through the veins
Proteins
Vessel unseen
Thoughts becoming
Whether foul or clean
A product of these
Perfect animations
Interactive
Residuals
Server the ties
Associates of the spiritually diseased
Whirlwinds of disaster
Qualities divine
Run from the walls
That
Rip you down
Thieves
That will
Lie and astound
Expressing obscurities profound
Respectable
Violent policies
Divide the animals
Anticipation of the effects engrained
Widespread
Bleeding through the orifices
Epidemic concentrates
Rupture
Blister
The plastering of the subordinates
The mastering of the inordinates
Alternatives
The body can lead you astray
From those you love
Passions
Smack them down
Structures that disrupt
This half cannot be replaced
These wide open
Embrace
Sweat in the eyes
Shut
Tight
Vandalized
Majesties that decline <start> and I'm still here in front of this skyline
waiting for a change and
since half a century I'm here
too long years in heaven
to agree with this hell
can a past mistake cancel...
earth divided civil war
red flashlights of gore
exiled losers worse than dying
...bring 'em to the dark side of the sky...
closed out of light
beyond the shadows
a blackwhite line
divides the booty of war
growing in this side
it could be so real to believe
that our native ground
is so void
months are days in this set
never seen again mother earth
a patient old man not warrior only
while young men ask their hero
to tell them again that story
lonely the voice of awareness
softly screams his guilty claims
he was the reason now he's the pain
present life in a skyline
I see it is a blackwhite line
I have grown in heaven
I'll soon leave the world
last time last fly
but dying here will free my hopes
my sons will pass the blackwhite line <start> Hello my sailor
I am married now and I white you from Lyon
I drink no more
I smoke real less you know 'cause I'm pregnant since
you've been gone.
My husband says he'll bring him up
like if he is his own son.
He's a banker and he leads me out dinner dancing what I want.
Remember je t'aime taverne noir I see yet the snack
booth on your pants.
I'll never forget your sailor mirth
how you picked up every comb out of the dirt.
His name is Jaques. He said this is mother's ring.
Take it as a prof for my love.
And our new flat is on the opera park really nice for my little dogs.
Excuse me. Want you to know what's true
I've no ring and there's no man.
I need fivethousand for the abortion.
Please Send it fast as fast as you can
Remember je t'aime taverne noir I can't find the one
for whom I yearn. You know 'bout your hurting sailor flirts.
Pick me up like every comb you'd found in the dirt.
Remember je t'aime taverne noir I see yet the snack
booth on your pants.
I'll never forget your sailor mirth
how you picked up every comb out of the dirt.
Like his own son
Dancing dinner what I want
A ring and a wedding dress

And my mind is my own
Still you poke and you prod daily
With that off setting harsh tone
And you thought that you had me
Underground with no doubt
Now the dirt lays on you heavy
Rusty blade cut that tongue out
Wise to your dealings
Wise to your games
Wise to the way you abrogate
The truth for selfgain
While the air keeps growing thinner
And my grip remains tight
Maybe now you'll reflect
On how you tortured me day and night
You saw my bones getting shattered
Along with my pride
And on that dreadful day
You watched my heart empty out and die
Wise to your dealings
Wise to your games
Wise to the way you abrogate
The truth for selfgain
It's a brand new day
And it's a brand new crisis
But was it worth the win
When you see what the price is
You say the past is the past huh
Just water under your bridge
Well today that bridge collapsed
Upon the sea that won't soon forgive
And no you're not immune
And you've created this monster
Now you just walk like a fool
Into the arms of righteous anger <start> So loaded with anger so filled with rage
Time for revolution
You are out for blood.
Crush the power
You will never feel free in this slavery system.
We are digging our own graves
In the gutter we will stay
Until we heed out in war
Against the global powers we will reign.
Cut of the power by their knees
Grab your knives and bring the ropes
Tie them up shoot their veins full with the shit they are selling
Tear apart their smiling faces and burn them alive.
Nailed up on crosses
Buried naked and alive
Nailed up on crosses
Hanging high soon all bled dry
They have taken away all your human rights
Giving away your blood selling your soul and mind to god
They steal your blood and try to bring you down to the place
Where all life ends
Cut of the power by their knees
Grab your knives and bring the ropes
Tie them up shoot their veins full with the shit they are selling
Tear apart their smiling faces and burn them alive.
Nailed up on crosses
Buried naked and alive

Hanging high soon all bled dry

Cut of the power by their knees

Tie them up shoot their veins full with the shit they are selling
Tear apart their smiling faces and burn them alive.
Nailed up on crosses
Buried naked and alive
Nailed up on crosses
Hanging high soon all bled dry <start> I always thought I knew the right thing to say
but something died in you long ago
your words echo inside
like screams in an empty well
always wondering what I could have done
but I couldn't save you
you have always been my secret regret
your nails dug furrows in my wrist
as you slipped away
a reminder of my failed nobility
you were all I ever wanted
reincarnation  resurrection
call it what you will
if everything I've done could reverse these days what
would you say
will you forgive me
am I your sacrifice <start> Van Drunen  Daniels
Marching into battle
to a war you do not know
read the fearfull faces
make them look so old
the homefront says its prayers
wishing them all well
but they will never return
from this bitter living hell
the trenches are awaiting
cold and moisty graves
obey the insane orders
a soldier is a slave
They will die in the war
between all the filth and gore
is there any glory
in this heroic story
Look at the ones who cause this
and analyze their games
you'll find that they're all guilty
wallowing in their shame
elected by the people
by promising a war
but now you've seen the butchering
you don't want it no more <start> originally by Celtic Frost.
See the portal gate to madness
Locked forever in a veil of shame
Deny extraction Thirst for disgrace
Watch his break the emperor's killed
Light of the day shadow from beyond
Scaffold of steel the throne is gone

Dethroned Emperor
The foot of the stairs dimension in might
The king sits his eyes are glass..
Growing of the small The laughters fall
Can you deny remaining cries
Decent of the lords into the trap
Existence and hate Unseen Hate <start> hello wooboot...
this is wooboot...
hum.....
your two days away from your th birthday...
and uhhh...
i'd like to talk to you...
its uh...

and uhhh...
if you're not there...
well uhhh...
i'll call later... <start> No one makes it out alive
But I know where the killer hides tonight
No one makes it out alive
But I know where the killer hides
I saw this night and the next
go Off to flames four years ago
They scurry like roaches
Stomped out by fire
I warned these insects not to move
But no one ever listens
Don't believe this girl
She preaches mayhem
She's the devils bitch and a liar
I want to see the look in her eyes
When her body parts ways with life
No one listens to the damned
No one listens to the damned
I've searched miles
All of it will explode I can see it all
No one listens to the damned
I've seen another human drowned I have seen it all
No one listens to the damned
Greeting the circus the monster will have you
No one listens to the damned
but God damn no one will believe me. <start> I've been away for every day and every fucking night.
I've seen your eyes I've seen your eyes I've seen your eyes.
I've been away for every day and every fucking night.
And with every city it gets harder.
You gotta mouth like a razorblade. it cuts so deep.
So kiss my wrists my neck and give me eternal sleep.
You say you say I'm only a phone call away.
But for me this distance is decay.
So line my throat with lipstick and leave my blood for flies.
I'll gurgle the blues under a sea of lies.
Before you take me to sea let me kiss the bride.
Now take my body to the shore and ill wait for the tide.
I will always love you. but I need pills to sleep
I have always failed you. so throw away my memories. <start> 
None so blind as those who won't see.
That's one you're not to like
Who looks gargoyle alike
In the name of... <start> The truth hurts
When you don't want to hear it
Plug your ears and cuss the God
Take that back you're being offensive
Because the heart is being challenged
Speak your mind just not about him
Stamp censored on my mouth
Shut me up anyway that you can
If you don't hear it then it must not be true
I've got something to say
And you're not gonna like it
He is the way the truth and the life
Step aside it's our time now
I refuse to contain what I know
No regrets no apology
No regrets no apology
No regrets no apology
If you don't know then you won't understand
I will not apologize for what I believe
If you don't know then you won't understand
I will not apologize for what I believe
For what I believe for what I believe <start> In retrospect I reflect
But I am to blind to see.
I embrace my soul
Hoping it will show me all.
Blind. I've lost it all.
I've lost you.
I'm so sorry for what
I have put you through.
I am so sorry for what
I did to you.
But look at me
Look at what
I have put me through.
Taken for a ride. <start> I've lost my battle before it starts
my first breath wasn't done
my spirit's sunken deep
into the ground
why am I alone
I can hear my heartbeat
silence's all around
See hat will rise
so don't come closer
fear your child
born with a king's heart
but fate fooled me
and changed my cards
noone asked if I want it
if I like it
Ref.
Pain inside is rising
I am the fallen one
a figure in an old game
no Joker's on my side
I plunged into misery
I'll turn off the light
and murder the dawn
turn off the light
and murder the dawn
Nothing else
but laughter is around me
forevermore
noone can heal me
nothing can save me
noone can heal me
I've gone beyond the truth
it's just another lie
wash away the blood on my hands
my father's blood
in agony we're unified
I never wanted to be
what they told me to be
fulfill my fate then I'll be free
god knows how long
I tried to change fate

Ref.

I plunged into misery
I'll turn off the light

To see these idols fall
Drag them out into the light
Let fate devour whole
This is your fault
You fool of faith untrue
That we should face the grave with such a blackened view.
Oh 
We see the damage done in the eyes of those turning away
Save your plea for the day that we suffer the wake of this treason.
Rain like fire descending upon us in holy resolve
Upon this ground.
Hollow name of five encircled frame
Deception incarnate receive my vow of hate.
Oh  see how the blood
Will run into the eyes of those turning away
We see the damage done
Resounding desecration
We see the damage done
Blackened insurrection
Suppress the pain of mind as long as you can bear
And feel the desperation clawing from within.
They say the truth is found when Hell is at your doorstep.
You'd better pray to see that time come to pass. <start> Cruel rays of light tear the dark inside
The new day on the town invades my mind
A crowd creeps in silence taking hold of the roads
Where I wes king 'til few hours before
It breathes the pollution and pisses gray
What they call life's death compared to what Night can give us
With all Her thieves and whores
... Night can give us and always does
We are all Kings all Queens not slaves
From dusk till dawn
Living to shine now
Living to shine
From dusk till dawn
We shine till dawn
Now Venus is rising to the west of Void
The old day on the town is fading out
A huge power swells inside of me
as the mob of lost souls thins and turns to the cells
I watch the crowd there and feel mercy
All your dreams are nothing compared to what Night will give us
With all Her sins and love
... Night will give us a crown of thorns
We are all Kings all Queens not slaves
From dusk till dawn
Living to shine now
Living to shine
From dusk till dawn
We shine till dawn <start> you stuck around
but not long enough
you helped us get through
the rough times
then you took your leave
at the best time for yourself
on a drop of a hat
you packed your bags
and left this home
how could you do it
just say it didn't feel right
how could you go
into this world alone
a year felt like a day
when it moved this fast
i know you won't come back
 years of living a lie
kept quiet all this time
who said we'd take you back
too bad
there won't be a next time
for you
you turned your back
on the one's you loved
not enough
time has passed
it's time to try
to put memories behind
easy for you
to move on with your life
don't look back now
live with the choice you made
you turned and ran
and left us all alone
you caused my heart
to harden into stone <start> ...and as we entered the gate to where all mortal ends
he just disappeared among the daimons and fiends.
Within the abyss I've felt my power grow
power of pure evil power from below.
Strength of the four rivers I will lead the horde.
Join me and become one with the new lore.
...and as I entered the throne the black flames lit
the hall.
Crown him king bring in the sword. The time has
come to and it all.
Finally I am ready to burn burn for my neverending sin
you will never learn this is the way it's always been
Fire will work with me and I will take control.
I'm the mighty the new infernal lord.
Hail me with pride and thou shall be spared
We are the legion from the dusk the pious always feared.
The sky turned to red as I slew the angels among the clouds.
They fell to earth featherlight encased in bright crimson shrouds.
We gather with the burning torches in our hands
the fire that will set your christian world on flame.
We will burn your wretched churches where they stand
not until the christian flag is gone will I achieve my aim.
Worship the ground I once walked.
Obey those words I have said.
This is the place haunted by ma shadow
Where even angels fear to tread.
How can you deny my existence
even though you've seen my face.
The battlescars of the ancient north
mark the damnation of the human race.
Will I ever let the ravens fly again and let them do what has to be done
Will their black wings ever shadow the earth from the sun
From every side from evrey open gate
they came to smear the blood into my face.
Will I ever let the wolves haunt again and let them do what has to be done
Will their teeth and claws ever slaughter the priests and nuns
From every side from every open gate
they came to smear the blood into my face.
Will I ever unleash my daimons and let them do what has to be done
Will their powers and actions ever convince the world I am the one who won
Within the abyss I've felt my power grow
power of pure evil power from below.
With infernal strength I will lead the horde.
Join me in the coming and follow the dark lore.
The sky turned to red as we slew the angels in the clouds.
They fell to earth featherlight enceased in bright crimson shrouds
I will wield the fire and forever take control.
I'm themighty the infernal lord. Join me brandish thy sword.
Hail me with pride and thou shall be spared
We are the legion from the dusk the pious always feared. <start> Under  moon spring time still to come
If I keep questing I may find some settling
JackintheGreen show me your droll face of wood
Look around at the frightened faces
One man speaks loud and loud he cries
All those strange fellows must go away to barrows
Then they all went for a riot indeed
Torch in hand and angry glances
Bridge
Here is Jenny Greenteeth twelve miles from the nearest inn
 innkeeper speaks of filthy tricks she's as old as trees
 be aware  As old as trees
Chorus
Nighttime  never they say go off alone
In their tracks I walk  A dreadful strain
Their homes so hidden through branches old they wait
No gold nor silver twiggy arms don't want your gold....
In the end the circle's close at hand
Living more gently let's have a glass of brandy
Never they saw their home's door open at night
Stars witness their silent traces
Bridge
Here is Dana o'Shee she's dwelling by to take revenge
Empty a jug of whitest milk over her head
 she'll pass away  Over her head
Chorus
Nighttime  never they say go off alone
In their tracks I walk  A dreadful strain
Their homes so hidden through branches old they wait
No gold nor silver fear is sold at half price....
Solos Jarpen Aydan
Chorus x  <start> I've been here for
a million years
it's only been
the twinkling of an eye
this dark this pain
it's so unbearing
fire consumes
the tears I cry
I never thought
of pain so drawn out
screams and gnashing
all surround me
over and over
I keep remembering
I must bear this
through eternity

this howl
I can't turn away
this howl
keeps droning through my mind
this howl
consumes my every thought and emotion
this howl
keeps droning on through time
I cannot bear
this isolation
where have all
of my friends gone
this supposed to be
the best time of my life
my fate has shown me
I was wrong...
I hear his voice every second in time
depart from me you accursed one
I never knew you
Jesus please forgive me
I'm ready to accept you now
but how I know
you will not hear me
I had my chance
I turned it down

Lyrics Elisa C.Martin
Shaded death I feel you close to me
Drags me with the violence of the sea
Up to the deepest lonely ocean
Crushing my forgotten emotions
Out of here I'll be a stranger
I'll feel the bows of a sure danger
And I won't won't think about death
There's no god. It's the end...
I wish I dreamt of you
I wish to feel you
I wanna touch you now
I learnted to live in dreams
So close the pain I dream
My freedom will not hang
From your thorns... anymore
A sweet sigh of your breath close to me forever
Today I can say that I'm frear than ever
Enclosed enclosed enclosed...
A tear in a corner of my eye
Witness of my sacrifice
I'm yearning to follow my silence
I'm falling in a soul of madness
It's time to leave this place far behind
I'll just remember all the good times <start> Are they giving us some room to grow
or pushing us deep in a hole
Is this all you need to know
All your fears are knocking at your door
you're lying on the bathroom floor.
Is this your only way out
What would you gain from this
You don't wanna go and let this just be another memory.
We can't pretend again.
You don't wanna go...

Every time I look in your eyes
some little piece of my heart dies

'cause I see you crying for a world you despise.
As time flies by you tell me
How can you live when your love is denied
Mate you've got to realize it
Get back on your feet
Stop feeling ashamed
Tell me what would you gain from this
What would you gain from this
You don't wanna go
and let this just be another memory.
We can't pretend again.
I just wanna know
what hides behind your broken hopes and dreams.
We can't pretend oh no
Time to clear your mind
and face the fears you hide
'till you see the light
You don't wanna go
and let this just be another memory.
We can't pretend again.
I just wanna know
what hides behind your broken hopes and dreams.
We can't pretend again.
You don't wanna go <start> Wishing my eyes were closed and the night has taken me away.
Flowers above my head and its leaves will bring me east of the dawn.
So there is just nothing I fear more than love
and the angel that once was my heart and the light that once was my soul.
Silent screams from the innocent voice of my heart.
There are oceans of pain whispering my name in the dark.
Im dancing in reverie wishing well that the paint
was colored in light.
Silent screams from the innocent voice of my heart.
Tears in black rain whispering my name in the dark.
Silent screams there is nothing I fear more than tears
lost in black rain Im walking through life all alone. <start> LUDD GANG Lyrics

Ports Jap fella missed film swiz quartz lorry back tread damn ludd gang
The housing association
Burn McDonald's seats
I'll prefix him of frustration
I'll stick with the gang of one
I'll make a stand with the Ludd Gang

I'll carve a hole in the rain for ya
Courage my sweet
Courage my sweet
Courage my sweet
It's a quiet like death
It's a choirette of death
Carve a hole in the rain for ya
Carve a hole in the rain for ya
I hate the guts of Shakin' Stevens
For what he has done
The massacre of Blue Christmas
On him I'd like to land one on
But I'm stuck with a gang of one
Carve a hole in the rain for ya
Courage my sweet
Courage my sweet
It's a quiet like death
It's the choirette of death
The housing association foiled the reign of the rain
For this McDonalds is truly grateful
Cab driver asks why I'm not
At home with my feet put up 
Whats Jap lorry back feather next bishops ludd gang <start> prey x ms <start> Not just for victory
Not just to crush your enemy
Not just for heir to be
But for this moment and to fight the injustice...
It was written long ago
This is what I've been told
An army came across the sea
To conquer this low land.
The lured with their lives
Shouted peasant kneel or die
Outnumbered undaunted
War cry rose to the skies.
On the homeland of the raven
Where the eagles scream at daybreak
And the clang and clash of armies
Beautiful the strife for conquest.
CHORUS
Rains came over to the north
Floods of lies to drown the old gods
A storm rose within the hearts of the enslaved
Ode for my ancestors' blood.
The seer foresaw the curse from above
Like a roar of approaching giant horde
In the moors and in the marshes
On the borders of the woodlands
The marched like approaching giant horde.
When I yield my life forever
Bravely will I fall in battle
Fall upon the field of glory
Beautiful to die in armour.
 <start> Trapped up inside here like lions in a cage
I've been a mark of injustice
Bound by these chains
Can't find a reason I'm on my own
My destiny waits for a sign from me
I'm leaving alone
I'm out on my way now
It's been so many years
The chase is my lifeblood
I have no more fears
Fire burns in my veins
Anger shows on my face
Hatred it poisons my soul
Look out I'm about to explode
Evil ones try to destroy us
We're armed and prepared for attack
We'll take on the world with the rebellion
We're dangerous down to the last
Armed and dangerous
Am I evil or am I insane
The lion inside of me is no longer tame
A blade in my left a gun in my right
to beat you within an inch of your life <start> die for me you worthless
lying machine
leaving you to breathe
would be only another sin
living without you
is the life I can realize
the interspace between us
is like hell from paradise <start> Here in my car
I feel safest of all
I can lock all my doors
It's the only way to live in cars.
Here in my car
I can only receive
I can listen to you
It keeps me stable for days in cars.
Here in my car
Where the image breaks down
Will you visit me please
If I open my door in cars
Here in my car
You know I've started to think
About leaving tonight
Although nothing seems right in cars. <start> A fucked up life
Death slowly comes
Games I've chosen to play
Are deadly ways to become...
More than human
Much more than you'll ever be
Inside my emptiness
I' ve tried to feel tried to be
Me...
No hope no limits
No fears no advices
No drugs no fluids
Nothing I need something stronger 
An altered truth
Promises of eternal youth
I' ve played the game to fall
Into a deeper hole to become...
More than you are
Much more than you'll ever be
When greatest turned to worst
I' ve tried to try tried to try 
No hope no limits
No fears no advices
No drugs no fluids
Nothing I need something stronger  <start> Take it from the best everything I do pops
Fake ass bitches all around me just stop
I could call you out but your shit already flops
I don't give a fuck I'm already at the top
Take another minute and relive it can't you see it
Bitch you're better than you ever really thought
Better at the game and I was born and raised inside it
You can find me in the motherfucking pit
If you wanna bet that you're playing with a god
And I hope you've prepared your case
I don't fuck around when it comes to the music
You can never really touch my pace
You come unto me just to question my roots
But you could never walk a day in my shoes
Been in the game for twelve years what it do
Fuck this shit you can find me in the moshpit
You come unto me just to question my roots
But you could never walk a day in my shoes
Been in the game for twelve years what it do
Fuck this shit you can find me in the moshpit
Are you ready motherfuckers Let's go
Take another minute to relive it
And admit it that your boy's going at it at a supersonic pace
I can take shotgun into a pub light it up take a grape
And then I throw it in your face
Pussy red motherfuckers doing what they're doing
All I do is hit them with the fucking truth
I'm a fucking stunner
I'm a grade A runner

With a . by my side 'cause I can remember being vicious

You gotta understand that though
Know what I'm sayin' <start> No limit no number too high
To commit the sickest of crimes
Homicidal enjoyment a frenzied lust to kill
Something they never understood I crave blood
Incursion twist of the knife
Internal adjustment mortal flesh impaled
I saw them die all empty of their life
I'll be thy master your sinful messiah
Evil incarnate pain and pleasure death defined
No end to my reign of hate
I saw them die all empty of their life
I saw them die all empty of their life
I saw them die all empty of their life <start> I'm not here to discount
The opiate of masses
But I've learned so much more
Attend lectures and classes
Through verbal dissections
Ideas are in suspension
We clash like criminals
In bed with loss prevention
We move when they say
And beg for shit that we
Will never ever need
So keep the receipt
We've become the children
Of paralyzed ambition
A fraction less human
Dining in modern kitchens
Prepackaged warmth with a
Touch of your personal flair
Arrested emotion
Wax poets with a cold stare
We move when they say
And beg for shit that we
Will never ever need
So keep the receipt
Don't you try to tell me that your life feels empty
Don't you try to tell me that your life feels empty
Don't you try to tell me that your life feels empty
... <start> Staring at the cold bleak light
Steaming breath leaving from my lips
At the circle of malevolence
No joy to benefit from here
Time is sharpening my knife
Reflections of pain and misery
Had humanity meant a thing to me
Would I still embrace depression
Secrets of the moon
Nail me to this place
Filled with nausea
And whirling memories
With age would I wield
knowledge and mysteries
But the human in me
Will lead me to decay
I hear the humming of the trees
The calling of the withering leaves
The shivering voice of remembrance
Cold steel for an age of hate... <start> We torture our selves we pay we die life is just another raw deal
Institution searching for that angelfuck just to find out it was all a lie
We were brought to this world just to destroy it created to extinct each
Other the human race breeding hate  enjoying pain we are all fed by lies
We're going down x
We will burn together x
We're going down x
We will all burn and die together our happy faces
Facing the ground
Now the world is just an open wound but we still want to go deeper inside
We all want more than we could ever spend we are never satisfied
We are all waiting for the world to burn we're all waiting for our luck to
Turn soon we have all succeeded we will be smoking dollars in eternal
Nirvana <start> After all these precious years you chose to just give in
Why did you leave so many things undone
I only scratched the surface of the thoughts you had within
and for me your life had just begun
Why did you think that you were never good enough to give
when you accepted me right from the start
I never saw the side of you that didn't want to live
and I miss you from the bottom of my heart
What was it that you never told a soul about yourself
what kind of thoughts were buried inside
was there really no one there you thought would understand
or was the only barrier your pride
with so much love around you I just wish you'd loved yourself
'cause no one here can ever take your place
you were someone special and my words just can't express
how much I miss the warmth of your embrace
Why did you just give in
why did you just give up and let it go
I guess I'll never know
It's hard to see you disappear without a real good bye
there's so many things I wish I'd said
But all the little things you did that made it all worthwhile
meant more than all the tears you ever shed
You always seemed so happy but I guess no one can tell
what goes on inside a persons mind
you loved your children dearly and you did your very best
and someone new like you is hard to find
Chorus
All the things you went through for your children every day
and all the sacrifices that you made
were worth much more than anything that wealth could ever buy
and now that love can never be repaid
In the end I guess you couldn't take it anymore
so you closed your eyes and swallowed all your pain
I know that you've done the same so many times before
but all the questions in my mind remain <start> I see towers of flame and corpses too
I see the doom of me and you
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
I see skies obscured I see no light
Dark freezing days dark sleepless nights
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
The clouds of radiation are so pretty in the sky
Tumors on the faces of the people who survived
I see friends in the past kill each other for food
They're really starving so will you
I see babies die I watch them decompose
They'll hurt much more than I'll never know
And I think to myself what a wonderful world <start> Fearless I pushed the switch causing you
Suddenly to disappear
The echo of thunder again reduced
Never thought you would leave me
Still chasing time so close
Yet so far apart
My understanding is killing me
I know you had to follow your heart
Don't look at me now
It's for your own good
Just to walk away
Road end remains
Don't look at me now
It's for your own good
Just to walk away
Road end remains
The unspoken truth
All hopes merged into stone
Terrified of the unknown
What could have been I realize
All hope merged into stone
Terrified of the unknown
Is now forever gone
Let it slip through my fingers
Don't look at me now
It's for your own good
Just to walk away
Road end remains
Don't look at me now
It's for your own good
Just to walk away
Road end remains
Not aware of the scarlet claw
Seemingly uncomplicated
What could have been I realize
Now your love forever lost
Fearless I pushed the switch causing you
Suddenly to disappear
The echo of thunder again reduced
Never thought you would leave me
New day has come
But I'll never get over you
Tide is high
Access still denied <start> Dying felt so goddamn good today
If I was ever alive well it's hard to say
It was kissing my eyelids and burning my face away
Dying felt so goddamn good today
We dance the electric Pagan Love Song
We hunt with the children paling in the catacombs
Eating dead flowers bleeding in a strange daze
I was cutting throats and eating tears
Smiling in a ruined age
Douse my love everything with gasoline
Grave flower blooms at your red light death scene
We dance the electric Pagan Love Song
We hunt with the children paling in the catacombs
Trippin' on real blood in strange sunshine
Have you felt such weight upon your eyes
Sister I been trippin' in your sky
I woke up adrift in a Technicolor bliss
Ten million miles high
I'm a Christian zombie by daylight
Satan he come trippin' 'round midnight
Circle jerkin' redneck truckers' dream
You scream I scream
Everybody screams for morphine
I won't love you mama I just fiend your morphine... your morphine
we send the love to the skull
I am the mother the father the killer
Forever and ever all right
I am the shapeless the deathless remorseless
Forever and ever tonight
I'm feelin' hollow again
I am the mother the father the killer of light
I'm gonna cut you motherfucker God's cocksucker
all right <start> Every night of my favor
Every night I'm gonna meet you
I love your coldness
Let me touch your deadly emptiness
Necropolis
Necropolis
Necropolis
Necropolis
Faded flowers
I like the smell of rotten beauty
Forsaken gravestone
Every morning I find myself lying on
Necropolis
Necropolis
Necropolis
Necropolis
Scene of horror place of peace
Theater of macabre everlasting feast
Forbidden pleasure my secret love
Wistful trauma eternal resting place
Disembody lust your body is dust
Blackened lady womb of the dead
Darkness warms me
Dancing all night on the graves
My sweet tender
One day I'll join you forever
Necropolis
Necropolis
Necropolis
Necropolis <start> This rage has overcome
No more will I shun
These thoughts I've had
This lie I've lived
I let them put the blame on me
Engulfed in hate
Retaliate
You can't conceal these thoughts
You can't disguise this rage
You have
Overstepped
Your boundaries
Now I've got
I've got your back against the wall
Forever trapped
Staring through the eyes of a criminal
A broken home
Left alone
An excuse you used
Don't bullshit me
Save all the breath that you can breathe
Engulfed in flames
Incinerate
You can't conceal my thoughts
And you can't disguise my hate <start> I'm not so sure I should not us these dirty leaves to
make a crown for your heart.
To sit alone with your flesh made up from this undervalues earth.
And it seems funny that you should tattoo an angel on the body of the very skin you are trying to escape ironic even that it is the human mind that scares you most.
But where man has failed.
And with your bloodied and tired hands lead them to the shadows.
Where they will feast like pigs at a table fit for a king where the heart is betrayed and consumed by greed.
Slowly to fall slowly to pass. <start> So wild so beautiful and pure
All elements divine
The essence of all life
So vast extensive and remote
Unbridled and erratic
Savage but glorious
It bursts its energy is stirring
It calls its drawing power
Will enchant us with its might
Its massive spirits bright
Let it flow
Its endless beauty will evoke
A timeless sequence we all share
We cannot break through nor control
But to feel its true soul
Dare to concede and to connect
Emerging waves and brightened skies
The sun that burns in your eyes
The wind that blows and pounds
It shines its energy is whirling
It fights will not be interfered with people
Who can't feel it is all nature's flow
Let it flow
It's endless beauty will evoke
A timeless sequence we all share
We cannot break through nor control
We should cherish it
Oh energy
Oh evoke me
Let it flow
Its endless beauty will evoke
A timeless sequence we all share
We cannot break through nor control
It is not at our command no <start> Like stones in silence I stand
As I draw circles in the sand
Naked under blue glass
Drowned I watch children dance
In a mind of an echo

I float to the distance to eat the horizon
I cut the sunbeams the day before tomorrow
Tranceform the time to a silent history
Run under water in eternal serenity
...is it easy to run
to run under water
...is it easy to paint
to paint without colors
I float to the distance to eat the horizon
I cut the sunbeams the day before tomorrow
Tranceform the time to a silent history
Run under water in eternal serenity

...is it easy to run
to run under water
...is it easy to paint
to paint without colors
As an echo in the mind <start> My vision is hazy there's clouds all around
I'm writing these last words for death is abound
Now I'm high in the sky my last trip I'll take
I'm sorry my family for all my mistakes
Chorus
As I look around at the fear in their eyes
All are praying 'cause they're gonna die
With all this chaos it's getting harder to breathe
I'm trying to write this for something to leave
Now my family and friends you knew me so well
I hope there's a story for someone to tell
Chorus
To my wife and my kids I will be in your sight
When you see a star it's me shining bright
I see the end is near the grounds coming fast
So just keep my memories our love will last
Chorus x <start> Where roses never die
Another life another try
Beyond the mountains beyond the fields
My fortune is waiting for me
Another life... Another life...
Another life another try
Where roses never die
Another life another try
Beyond the forest of forever more...
Beyond the seas without shores...
Beyond the horizon of eternity
My fortune is waiting for me
So bright... So bright
I enter the tunnel of light
Where roses never die
Another life... I'm gonna try...
Sunshine fades and shadows fall
But sweet remembrance outlasts all... <start> Round and round we go
Like a merrygoround out of control
The same old tune the same old song
Again again and again
Round and round we go
When will it stop nobody knows
The same old chords the same old words
It all sounds familiar all starts to sound the same
Turn on tune in drop out
Out of tune dropped in turned off
Who calls the tune
Round and round we go
Ever get the feeling you've heard this before
Same old melody rejuvenated
Recycled again and again
Round and round we go
Never able to stem the flow
The same old notes going round in cycles
Over and over again and over again
Turn on tune in drop out
Out of tune dropped in turned off
Who calls the tune
Who plays the fool
As the circles ever increase
Round and round we go
Like a merrygoround out of control
The same old tune the same old song
Again again and again
Round and round we go
Ever get the feeling you've heard this before
The same old melody rejuvenated
Recycled again and again again and again
Turn on tune in drop out
Out of tune dropped in turned off
Turn on tune in drop out
Out of tune dropped in turned off
Who calls the tune Who plays the fool
Who calls the tune
As the circles ever increase <start> I've lost a part of me
Tell your friends to sharpen their teeth
There's a few quid to be made
And my soul's a sorry state
So come on down you're empty lovers
Wolves come out of the woodwork
And the snakes start to sing
Do you feel the chair
Clawing at the back of your neck
And start to spell
Did you really think that you could fix me
We'll sell your bones for another roll
We'll sharpen your teeth
Tell yourself that it's just business
Wolves come out of the woodwork
Leeches come from out of the dirt
Rats come out of the holes they call home
And I fall apart
And the snakes start to sing
Don't say I'm better off dead
Cause heaven's full and hell won't have me
Won't you make some room in your bed
Well you could lock me up in your heart
And throw away the key
Won't you take me out of my head
I'm just a would've been could've been
Should've been never was and never ever will be
We'll sharpen your teeth
Tell yourself that it's just business
Would've been could've been
Should've been never was and never ever will be
Wolves come out of the woodwork
And the snakes start to sing
Wolves come out of the woodwork
Leeches come from out of the dirt
Rats come out of the holes they call home
And I fall apart
And the snakes start to sing
If you can't soar with the eagles
Then don't fly with the flock
Are you still getting high
Did you catch your own reflection
In the knife my mother held
Or the hell in my father's eyes
If you can't soar with the eagles
Then don't fly with the flock
Are you still getting by
Was I your knight in shining armor
The apple of your eye
Or just a step to climb
If you can't soar with the eagles
Then don't fly with the flock.
Are you still getting high
Did you catch your own reflection
In the knife my mother held
Or the hell in my father's eyes
If you can't soar with the eagles
Then don't fly with the flock
Are you still getting by
Was I your knight in shining armor
Or the apple of your eye
Or just a step a fucking step to climb <start> Une i sya nila

some day you'll see
Forever I'm yours
Once more
we'll be
on the Ivory Shores <start> for I feel as fallen pain
scold myself with useless blame
drag the blade across my lips
purge the lie release my fist
as far as I as one have come
as for my lies I burn in each and every one
as for the truth denied by fear
and for my pain I brought it all upon myself
this fear that I may de my dream
success means I am more than none
to be as one is what I fear
in days of hope I dream I'm dead
to be as stone and still  my mind
as I rise to de as one
my past this life I leave as filth
it all comes together
when we open up our mind
open wounds will kiss me
dressed in blood meet my god <start>  and the thrill in the bright sweet night is a question of you
Trying to be kicking ass to help me out after you know I never wanna go
Before I go high I'm very down
The only bottle left to drink again and again
The only try for the fuckin' way to be why do I slice them out
When together try something drug and you question me what's to coming out
Before I go high I'm very down
The only bottle left to drink again and again
Come on
Baby I set my tracks my life to the fuckin' baby out to you
And the turnup in your eyes keep my head
until I sweat now tell me what the fuck to do
One day I gettin' to the point where I can't do
nothing but try to be strungout on you
Let me down waiting down below.. for the fleeting past to let go
Well to the end I raise my better half pimpin' up my own reflection
Forever I saw kissin' you goodbye to give my soul addiction
Before I walk I need the ground
You know me poor I never return
Up and next you tell me FUCKIN' WHORE
The only bottle left to drink before I go
One day I gettin' to the point where I can't do
nothing but try to be strungout on you
Let me down waiting down below.. for the fleeting past to let go
Well to the end I raise my better half pimpin' up my own reflection
Forever I saw kissin' you goodbye to give my soul addiction <start> I feel I have been left alone
Surrounded by nothing but gloom
I'm dancing on the stage of chaos
Wearing the velvet gown of doom.
chorus
But wait and don't haste
Find the long lost peace inside me.
Stop looking for the end
Row back from the other side.
I can't understand the voices
Shouting in my weary head.
I fall to my knees before them
I've become a living dead.
chorus
Perhaps when the ferryman
Takes me to the other side
The dreams will be the same again
Like that of a newborn child.

chorus <start> Breaking the silence lonely screams that can't be heard
Casting the shadows in your mind his spoken word
Famine and wars prophecies are said and done
It's growing black blackening.
Where's the sun
Where's the sun
Where has it gone
Can you believe all forms of life just die
Atomic fate will show our eyes
Here lies the sad reality
Insight that saw forbidden destiny
A vision saw what was to come
Time is now under destruction's thumb
The eyes that saw tomorrow
Leads us to the road of sorrow
Echoes of thunder shout across the reddened sky
So in an instant existence will die
All for the power money and its lust
Our politicians return us to dust <start> Esto es mi cuerpo Poroso como flagella por decomposicion Esto es mi sangre fermentado sanguine vendimia Coctel podrido Celilas rojas decompuestas Ahora reliquificadas Pasa humano de sangre muerto Absintio de plasma podrida Borracho por los fluidos que antes corrian Halucinaciones gracias a fermentacion prolongado Sauvignon men <start> Mortem saluta
Cry beautycry
noone can hear you.
Pray precious pray.
For a sudden end precious pray.
Peritura mortem saluta.
Secrets you have told me
and dreams I've trusted in
turned to plagues and demons
and they haunt me and they grin.
They're like a touch of darkened wings.
They demand a sacifice.
They can't be banished from my brain
and they laugh at me again.
Mortem saluta
Cry beautycry
noone can hear you.
Pray precious pray.
For a sudden end precious pray.
Peritura mortem saluta.
The higher you fly
the deeper is the fall.
Teh more you have had
the less stays at all.
If never you laughed
then never you'll mourn.
You'll never be lonely
if you've ever been alone. <start> We go about our business
Statistics on our side
We wear our flags
Filled with national pride
Babies in their cribs
Envy of the world
Jet plane circling above
It's passed I am sure
Magazines in the mail
And nothing else
Saw a film at the mall
Still doing well
At least two counties away
At least for today
My eye's peeled anyway
keeping muggers away
Everything seems so blind
New York hate of mind
Go to work
Show my card at the gate
Face on the wall
That disappeared on the date
His Spanish was perfect
So they say
Looking for the envelope
With his fake name
I'm an okay dad
I must explain
Not everything's clear
Evil often gets its way
While we ail from the sickness
We try hard to forget
Such a blessed existence
We may realize it yet
Everything seems so blind
New York hate of mind <start> Donde est mi corte
Las ratas lo esperaban
Para el burro que cargara
El ltimo no surraba
No vivio por la maana
Donde est mi corte
Donde est mi corte
Ya entr el pinche burro
Culiandose a droga duro
Dijo cuesta ms mi culo
Mochense o no me surro
Donde est mi corte
Globos tienen metido
Donde est mi corte
Cagas o no sales vivo
no sales vivo
Donde est mi corte
Te lo saco con cuchillo
Donde est mi corte dijo
Arranco a tus intestinos
tus intestinos
Donde est mi corte
Globos tienen metido
Donde est mi corte
Cagas o no sales vivo
Donde est mi corte
Te lo saco con cuchillo
Donde est mi corte dijo
Arranco a tus intestinos
Surrate ya no seas tonto
Con filero saco pronto
En la carcel no es juego
Hay te va tu corte gero. <start> Blinded by the fire and the sorrow of the day
I come knocking at your door
To dry the tears away.
The eventide is calling me to take a look into your eyes.
Pull me on and make me mesmerized
Riding on the wings of light
Dreaming dreams and holding tight
Leaving all my sorrow far behind.
Your eyes are the gate
To the land of the miracle where our love can make us fly make us fly.
In the land of the miracle
We can find a reason why and how we can fly.
Open up the book of madness
Read the page of life
Who's the one to tell you what to do
And how to rise
And if the stars would fall one day
I'd climb up to the sky
To put them back for you to save your smile.
Take a look into the book of fantasy and poetry and you will see
What you can feel is everything you need to heal your crying mind
The soul behind and everything that you may find inside your head...
A million years have passed away to make us head for the decay and to unlearn just
What we yearn for all day long right to be strong and stick to our ideals
Are they for real and do we just have lost the thread
I believe in miracles they happen every day.
In your arms a dream comes true for me
 <start> Voi olispa aikaa
jo kulunut tarpeeksi
kuukaudet menneet
ja sydn ois ehj
tai ettei ois
hn lhtenyt sittenkn pois
Peiton alla on kuuma
s haluat piiloutua
kaikki on auki
ja puhelin kiinni
mut s et j
siihen et kuitenkaan j
Jokainen y vie aamuun
jokainen yksininen
valon jos sytytt maailma her
Tuolla on joku toinen
se viel ei tunne sua
sin et usko
mut ei sinusta riipu
et mitn voi
mitn et kuitenkaan voi
Se tulee sua vastaan
kvelee samaan huoneeseen
kaikki on uutta
ja samalla vanhaa
Et mitn voi
mitn et sillekkn voi
Jokainen y vie aamuun
jokainen yksininen
valon jos sytytt maailma her
Hei jokainen y vie aamua pin
s luulet et sua varten ei rakkautta oo enemp
mut se viel tulee etk voi mit ... 
Voi olispa aikaa
jo kulunu tarpeeksi
kuukaudet menneet
ja sydn ois ehj
tai ettei ois
hn lhtenyt sittenkn pois <start> For fear my eyes are closed
I'll shut this out no more
Embrace this and I become the catalyst
And now it swells in me
Smash all my defenses down
I'll take this I'll let this fire consume me
I will not fall I will not fail
I pound the walls I shake the cage
I will not fall I will not fail
Let this fire consume me
This burning passion it fills me with desire
And drives me and it drives my cause
I'm filled with reasons but reasons drive me further
Disdain for disbelief will stay the course
Oh let the fire consume me
Let the fire burn
Let the courage flow through me
Let the fire burn <start> even as a friend you manage to lodge a knife between my shoulder blades. i have no more need for these photos. i have betrayal and viciousness to remind me of your face. so i'll be giving these pictures back with me torn out. this will be my last phone call. you wont hear my voice again. i'll chalk it up to one more loss and wish you the life you deserve. this is my ill wish for you and i'll wear it like its going out of style. <start> When I can't see what's real and unreal
Reality but a bleak memory to me
Of years in sorrow and hatred
The dreams they helped me through
Lifted me up from the shadows
Suicide was near but not here
In a world no one can see
Only for the angels and for me
I escaped the truth and the lies
Forced my soul to depart with my body
That always was sitting by a window
Gazing out into that cold and rainy street
Tears in eyes because of someone lost
Or maybe never found
My mind was always filled with so much anger
I don't carry that burden anymore
I'm free of feelings but still I care
For all the ones I left behind <start> The ordeal has begun
To oblige the unknown within me
As I drown
Cannot remember cannot think
As I sink deep...
Near the monolith of doubt
Creeps the fear
The fear to lose yourself
In the severe reflection
I don't know
A flashing moment that has frozen me
My whole existence passed by
Through the trusted eyes of a mirror
But it wasn't me I could see
This monolith of everything that I have been
Is vacillated and aghast
The inexorable time has taught me once again
That my features will change and macerate me
See it's me my monolith of doubt <start> Feel the hate that burns deep in your sick soul
Your psychotic mind is totally out of our logical control
How the fuck should I know that you did decide
That I'm your unsuspecting target to build up your pride
You did hurt my friends and you've destroyed my property
Fear speeds all around like cancer at the last stage
You're a dangerous criminal ruthless violent animal
Why did I trust in the power of the law
I've paid my taxes all in time
I've been a faithful citizen
I was not prepared for this crime
Now I take justice in my hands
The final curtain falls
You will enter the twilight halls
The final curtain falls
The final curtain falls
Taste my deadly revenge smell your upcoming pain
Eat the dust to which you will decay nothing will remain
I've been fighting for my rights but the wheels of the law
Turned out to be a toothless shark <start> Terkenang zaman remaja
Akulah juara dalam becinta
Banyak hati telah ku luka
Ku terus melangkah tanpa rasa
Bersalah di dada
Apa yang utama
Ku menjaga hatiku
Agar tak dihampa
Tapi nampaknya ku tewas kini
Dengan caramu yang tersendiri
Sememangnya ku dulu pencuri hati
Namun pencuri ini sedar dan berjanji
Takkan melukakan hati yang tulus sejati
Ramai yang tahu diriku pencuri hati
Namun ku juga dambakan cinta abadi
Dan bukannya suatu rahsia hatiku dicuri dirimu
Segala peluang yang tiba
Tak pernah ku guna
Benar berusaha
Ramai yang datang dan pergi
Semuanya ku tepis
Hingga kini
Sememangnya ku dulu pencuri hati
Namun pencuri ini sedar dan berjanji
Takkan melukakan hati yang tulus sejati
Ramai yang tahu diriku pencuri hati
Namun ku juga dambakan cinta abadi
Dan bukannya suatu rahsia hatiku dicuri dirimu
Aku kan percaya cinta selamanya
Asal kau juga yakin dengan kita
Demi cintaku padamu
Ku tinggalkan caraku dulu
Telah ku pelajari
Dari kesilapanku dulu
Moga kau kan memahami
Sememangnya ku dulu pencuri hati
Namun pencuri ini sedar dan berjanji
Takkan melukakan hati yang tulus sejati
Ramai yang tahu diriku pencuri hati
Namun ku juga dambakan cinta abadi
Dan bukannya suatu rahsia hatiku dicuri dirimu
nur <start> These words are a weapon for the ones in pain
A fair fight for the children of a lesser name
We are the war against the sick and fatal fall of man
A hollow tip to the notion of a Godless stand
Quick to slam the gavel on a true solution
You let the fear become a stranglehold
Tear it all apart so you can render your own belief
You never listened to what you were told
Condemned
You built a wall disbelief is all you left us
Reaction
Without a thought your resolve is to reject us
You found your darkness stands on a thread of pinhole light
And all you wanted was perfection
You found your darkness stands on a thread of pinhole light
So all you are is contradiction
You buried the chance in a selfrighteous glance
So your sons and your daughters were safe
But your imperfect path is a heart made of glass
And the world is a charming grenade
Condemned
You built a wall disbelief is all you left us
Reaction
Without a thought your resolve is to reject us
You found your darkness stands on a thread of pinhole light
And all you wanted was perfection
You found your darkness stands on a thread of pinhole light
So all you are is contradiction <start> Understand understand
That I will keep you safe
From every scar that bleeds
I will keep you free
From all that's hurting me
This I promise this I promise
This I promise this I promise
I promise I promise
One more time
This I swear
Trust in me
My faith is sincere
Love is stronger
When the end is near
Then there will be
Nothing more to fear
I promise I promise
Trust in these
Love life hands
You need me
To help you stand
I can release you
From your pain dear
Then there will be
Nothing more to fear
I promise this I promise this
I promise this I promise
I promise this I promise this
I promise this I promise
Love is stronger
When the end is near
I can release you
From your pain dear
Understand understand
I promise I promise
I promise this I promise this
I promise this I promise
Promise <start> How do you feel do you feel real good
Well I do not believe
Cos you seem to be someone else
Than you pretend to be
Something crept into your mind
Nimble as a snake
It sells you shit for truth
And you'll never recognice
No more .......
Do you wonder all the pain
That is hidden within steel
I'll tell you for nothing
You only fear yourself
No more ................. no more faith
Love or hatred
Pain or pleasure
No escape from your sentimental treasures
Better face the truth
All the money that you spend
For beautycreams and masks
Will never ever hide the scars
That lies left on your face
No more .................. no more faith
No more .................. no more faith <start> You landed your ships on a foreign land.
Discovered worlds you didn't understand.
A world full of creatures that you've never seen.
Flora and fauna beyond your dreams.
Seeking out a new world exploit it as your own.
Habitual resources expired.
Choose the land of plenty.
Observe and abduct apply and extract.
Reacting to different cultural extremities.
Revel in isolation.
Secrets unknown.
Foreign being ritual.
Invading their homes.
You take without asking you take without reason or consequence.
Imposing cultural belief system the masses in the palm of your hands.
First contact from a new world first contact from another life.
First breeding of two worldly minds first offspring to be left behind.
Who made first contact
What made first contact
Where was first contact
This is first contact. <start> As pride precedes a downfall so he took his place before the firewall
Of dissonant choirs whose faith in one
Was embraced in this wraith whose fate was hung
Between forgiveness and the damage done
An electric scent over drear decay
Lent a violent surge to their serenades
Through white glades as his winged parade
Bent to silhouette and to sharpen dull razors
Within vast skies unversed in starkness
His might grew
And blew light hues to gray
And worse a third of stars to darkness
Then thunder seethed and wreathed in thickening night
A line was drawn midst wrong and right and across the throats of thieves
As love fell choked the tempest broke from Heaven's farthest shore
Descending to eclipse all hope repentance might stay holy war
He would not heel nor fake a bow
Murmur curses to the wind
Enraged he raved in a Balrog howls
Upon a storm firstborn of sin
Incensed anew rebellions tore
Like frenzied beasts of prey
Through temple doors
Through east before the midnight masses
And where once bliss reigned so serene
In sweeter glades
Now veins ran openly
Like eyes that shied from kindred ashes
When suddenly there shone a hideous light
And a voice like three inanities soared up in thistled speech
Thou hast bred hate where there dwelt none and for this grave mistake
How thou art falling morning sun
The proud will be abased
He would not heel
Nor fake a bow
Murmur curses to the wind
And lo the wrath of God swept down
Thou art no more an Angel filled with light
But a leech to be abhorred
And thou shalt suffer my burning will
Quoth this raven nevermore
Never fucking more
And with these words like heavy stone cast against that gilded throne
With many legions still in tow he turned his wings to flee
His eyes a picture of distaste dawn to tears and in their place
The dawn of time and fates to face through all eternity
I wept for him a deep red river that ran like blood through scarred ravines
To sluice away the guilt that slithered like a Serpent tongue to Eve
For once as I in Heaven climbed too high for truth to truly see
My sunken mind drunken and blind saw the lie that fool was me
Alone and cold face to the crack
Beyond dark gates with no way back
His crown of gold faded to black
Like a bruise upon the heart that lingers
With thrillkill
Culture shock wave lengths
Of rope to hang high
Ten commandments by snaked about his upraised fingers <start> Closing my eyes you were always there
Stared back at me like a mirror
If noone's here to show you the way
Will you walk in that line
That leads you astray
Before you were born I faced the choice
Existence only a dream
My gift to you this dream of life
The day you were born I saw joy in your face
With virtue and faith to grow strong
Of all the things I could give in this world
To help you survive to keep you alive
Do you believe in destiny
What makes you think
you're the doer of your actions
The Good The Evil... what a quandary
Come to my arms and shed no tears
Trust in me little one
Let me be your guide
And in life you will learn to fly
It's like a mirror so much left to be had
Your innocence soon will be tested
Looking ahead seeing the lead
this life so new
The stars wait for you
As you grow you'll be tempted to stray
Your conscience pushed to the limit
Trust in the voice you know to be true
My poor little thing
Don't fear you're not so innocent or are you
Don't doubt. The doubts will make you feel worse
Come to my arms and shed no tears
Trust in me little one
I will be your guide
And in life you will learn to fly
Now you sleep well little boy don't cry
In the morning a new light will shine
I'll erase your fear forever
And the darkness will dissappear
Little boy don't cry little boy don't cry
In the eyes of God you are all the same
Some possess the good others all the pain
Come to my arms and shed no tears
Trust in me little one

I will be your guide
Come to my arms and shed no tears
Trust in me little one

I will be your guide
And in life you will learn to fly
Show me your other cheek
I would like to see it
He likes that it makes him feel good
It's all the same to me
I think you're one of mine
He got rid of you
I will give you shelter
I'll ask you no questions
I won't even doubt you
I know what you're like and you're not bad
There's no difference between good and evil
And if there is it's too late for you <start> I'm the blasphemer  by infernal fire
I'm the blasphemer  by infernal hate
I'm the blasphemer  by inferno's fire
I'm the blasphemer  by infernal wrath
I see crimson in your blood
Snowwhite is your dead skin
They told me that you were supposedly god
And my deed was ultimate sin
But what I have done
Was just pure justice
I raised the shining blade
To protect myself
I crush the crucifix because
Age of satan shall come to pass
Mark of the beast 
On my breast means I'm antichrist
Son of fire son of satan
Antichrist and the beast
Messenger of destruction
Great beast and the blasphemer <start> A thousand miles away from home
It seems that all your dreams and hopes are gone
You're at the point of no return
Oh tell me will you ever learn
Can't you see that we all belong together
Only we stay strong forever
All for one and one for all
We stand and fight we'll never fall
Raise your voice and try to sing this song
All for one
Too far away to bridge the distance
You're growing weak you'll lose resistance
You're standing out there in the cold
You're all alone you don't know where to go
Can't you see that we all belong together
Only we stay strong forever
All for one and one for all
We stand and fight we'll never fall
Raise your voice and try to sing this song
All for one all for one
All for one and one for all
We stand and fight we'll never fall
Raise your voice and try to sing this song
All for one
All for one and one for all
We stand and fight we'll never fall
Raise your voice and try to sing this song
All for one and one for all
We stand and fight we'll never fall
Raise your voice and try to sing this song
All for one <start> Oh Darkness
I will give the throne onto him
Of Darkness
I am harvesting the growth of my first spring
Of Darkness
Through me you gave him the life
Of Darkness
One world shadowed in me
Throught you  the birth of the Pillorian Age
Throught you  the sand of the Gallow's Land
Throught you  the rest of Velvet Pilloria
Throught you  I will pass on my given oath
So I am falling my son
For my mission is done
My visions and you became one
Out of my flesh...
...you shall build the town
Gallowenia
Gallowenia
Gallowenia
Gallowenia <start> Motivation greed and pride you donBt care how many die.
Mother earth raped once more mutilated to the core
 NEVER CARING  
 NEVER SHARING  
 FILL YOUR POCKETS  
 WITH THE STENCH OF PROFIT 
DonBt you see what you have done blocking out the fucking sun
Savage progress twist the fate you wonBt see until itBs too late.
 NEVER CARING  
 NEVER SHARING  
 FILL YOUR POCKETS  
 WITH THE STENCH OF PROFIT  <start> Do you believe in heaven or do you believe in pain
A sanctuary built for the mischosen
Is it the final contradiction or just an irony of fate
Doomed we are to drown in an empty ocean
In Misery's dawn...
Can't you see
God's forgotten children struggle for their lives
While innocent convictors celebrate the knive
I'll always be with you  But I've never really been
On your way back to the gallows destiny's fulfilled
Misery's dawn
Can't you see
Misery's dawn
Together from a black sea of stars we shall arise
To fall down once more failure in disguise
In tragedy's harvest the fruit's a bitter loss
They broke your wings and make you tumble down... at any cost
You burned me with your poisoned seed of doubt
Why do you want me to suffer
Is this the day of geaven or is this the day of pain
I closed my heart forever as the blade slowly opened your veins...
Misery's dawn
Can't you see
This is my private misery <start> He's a man
Gonna do what the can to make this world a decent place
He's a man
Got a great little plan on how to give it a brand new face
He wants to erase
He wants to replace
He wants to wipe the scum of the earth off its pretty face
Didn't wanna be just another voice with an answer
He'd seen it done before and turn into a cancer
But he was a chancer
Way romancer
He had such great planes
To get the damn deal done <start> Hear the virgin scream Blood is dripping
Running down the altar Under black death fucking skies
The emperor eats her heart
under seven black oaths Death destroy
With blasphemys coalitions
chorus <start> Now shelter I must find from strong gale about to rise
The Northern lights delight me
sets the darkened skies ablaze
As I slowly make my way over glade
to reach the firwoods rising gates
But savoring came the jaws of night
swallowing all but moon and stars
Storm it groped till raging blow
Impaling bareclothed
like dagger thrown by embittered foe
Beneath the flickering eyes of night
there under firwoods branch he rests
In the cradle made by encrusted snow
Without a grief or care
The northern lights...
The icewinds cold breath forces me
to this fortress of evertrees
That offers me a place to rest
Den for me and the beasts as well
Oh Fortuna thou hath abandoned me
Who could see through the veil of night
could hear the fainting call of the desperate one
When the storm rages on and on...
...and once again it strikes forth with
such a furious howling blow
No mercy given for the lost
who is seeking a way out from
this horrid maze of ice and snow
Under the stars may moon guide your way
but cold Northwinds will blow eternally
Under the stars beneath the blazing skies
you were forced to leave from where forest remains...
Out from the darkness just like that
a swelling light became
Now chanting for the traveller
whose road became to its end
The Northern lights delight thee
sets the darkened skies ablaze
As you slowly make your way over glade
to reach the firwoods rising gates
Savoring will come the jaws of night
swallows all but moon and stars
Storm it gropes till raging blow
Impaling the one who tries
to conquer the forest's throne
Beneath the stars may moon guide your way
but cold Northwinds will blow eternally <start> We the nocturnal few
Bound by other laws
To the service of the enemies of God
Are silent and hidden
Yet our exquisite fire burns on
Poised to engulf
Tie a man to his God
He may not walk for fear
Of falling foul to temptation
Where once faith stood her ground
Renounce the guilt ignite the flame
Cast the fetid virgin back from where she came
Drink deep of the promise in my eyes
Of mist and midnight skies
I drown in fathomless dreams
And in the reeking mire of virtue scream
I yearn to sell my very soul


Do What Thou Wilt
Until the stones in my heart stand still
Regardless of the cost to your repugnant god
The last May frost may blight the crops
And will never be ascribed to be heavenly dog
Or nature but infernal tasks
By your cursings and imprecations
You wrong both Man and beast
By whatever whim you serve
Of the Devil your leige
Tie belief to the trinity and seven ways
Will be wrought to condemn thee
Conspiring to cull the pagan ways
Twist back their lies personify their needs
The war begins by Satanic decree
If Evil we be we will our lives
To mist and midnight skies
I will avenge the deaths of a thousand burning children
Be bound to a covenant with us in our hellish league
And bring the host of the Nazarene to their knees
Breath the life of an entity neverborn
Darkness now descend in raven form
The words the burning rasp vibrate the cosmic thread
Arcturus is risen Queen hold forth the severed head to me
I pour my lovelorn kisses at your feet
Raper of all my worldly enemies
Lycanthropy please poison me
Send acausal instincts crawling my brain
Take me Mistress until perversion is fed
Dark Magick pleasures weaved under the jeweled moonhead
The crossstick will fade when the usurper hangs
For now we congregate where once my angel sang
That night they came and took her away from me
I lost the woman I loved and I learned how to curse
And to spit in the face of their God
We will ride again
In the midnight skies <start> Rape us the time
You bring us this loving wave
Crosses they rose
On our once proud pagan land
Those words they spoke were like
Needles on my skin
And their blessings were like knives
Stabbed into my heart
I trusted thee
O heathen men of the north
To hail and fight
And to run them out
Those words they listened were like
Stabs into my back
The baptism they had meant
That I had lost homeland
Cold winds now freeze my eyes
...Now I flee
Out of this shame they caused
I spread my wings
To fly to a realm of my own
My eyes are frozen for the icy tears
My soul sheds
For those betrayers that were not
Strong enough in faith <start> They came riding down the slopes
Five fearless men prepared to fight
We heard with fear the rumbling earth
In the midday light
Surprised we saw all terrified
The brave northmen's run
The fearless five with power ride
Attacking us in the midday sun
Their charge was fast no alarm was sound
They broke right through our lines
I felt the cut it threw me to the ground
And now I feel has come my time
I lie here in my blood
And see my family get killed
I feel abandoned by my god
I fear death's chill
I see Hell's gates
Towering high
And dark are they
I don't want to die
Oh no I was wrong
Denied the true Gods
And now I'm doomed
I trusted foreign men
And their god's son
But now when I need them
They are gone
I see Hell's gates
Towering high
And dark are they
I die
They ride across the planes
And punish those of false belief
All resistance is in vain
As they caress them with cold steel
They are the punishers
And they will never bend
They are power the five of them
From Asgard they are sent
The power they have in all they do
The Christians non will feel
No one can escape them no
Them will make them kneel
Their fight is through they must return
No one here survived
And as the blood red sky begins to burn
To Valhall they will ride <start> You can see him riding on the wind
You can see him with his wings of fire
Like the speed of light he rules the winter sky
When its freezing cold he will come back
Like a fireball hes gonna be there
No one can take away his strong will to be free
You want this you wanna be just as free
In the starlight black red and white
Doomlord 
In the forest you might hear him scream
Feel his anger fear his fury
Bloodpainted chest with a metal spine
You want this you wanna be just as free
In the starlight black red and white
Doomlord 
Domherren har fr vana att uppska fgelbord vintertid vilket gjort att den r en av de mest knda fgelarterna i Sverige.
Hanen kan bli mycket upprrd om man hrmar hans fljtande vissling vid reviret.
Han spnner d ut det rda brstet
svnger huvudet med den svarta kalotten fram och tillbaka och kan ocks frn sin utsiktsplats gng p gng flyga ver den hrmande fr en mer noggrann inspektion.
Vanligtvis r domherren en stannfgel men en del flyttar i oktober till Danmark och Mellaneuropa och terkommer i mars.
Vissa r flyttar ett stort antal ut ur landet
r  noterades vid Falsterbo fgelstation en verklig massflytt
d hela  Domherrar under en dag begav sig till Danmark
Cast in iron this soul of mine my metal spine...

Doomlord  <start> So now you're begging for life
All hopes and dreams are kicked aside
Your reflection in my knife
Reflects hum animal demise
Every man every child
Punishment for being alive
White meat dark meat
Red meat dead meat
So ravenously consumed
Your disassemblage my blood lust anxiety
In heat for human meat
Every piece digest complete
Crack open the epithelial
A meal in yourself
Frozen alive and placed in scalding broth
To separate skeletal trash
Fine portions of meat slough off
It's in this industry
We find deeper meanings
For the human being
Forcefed murder
You have long been a killer
You have long been dead
This has all been a holocaust
You have long been forcefed
Dead meal for the masses
Condiments of fluid and bile
Efficient waste and disposal
Hors d'oeuvres arriving in piles
Frozen alive and placed in scalding broth
Preparation of shit breeders
Fine portions of meat slough off <start> Darkness  In every line and word i'm singing
Demons  Haunting me whenever I think
Nightfall  A dying man
Nightfall  Yes i am
Beasts inside me roar
The dark one is my name
Allright here's the dark one speaking
I introduce my mental world to you
Breaking living nothingness
That's what I will do  be careful
My words are in your hands
And they measure good and bad
Maybe they attract you
But you should read between the lines
I rule the night it's my home I welcome you
Die Nacht ist mein und ich lad dich herzlich ein
I hunt the light for more than one decade
'Cause i am the dark one the dark one I am
Selfhood  I hate you
Dullness  and you too
I decry you all
For dark one is my name
Hey you do you hear my words
I hope you do and feel it too
Blaming mortal selfishness
That's what I will do  I mean it
This is my other side
I'm not only a dark one
As I have a pulsing heart
For all who care <start> Living in dreams day dreaming
Not in good shape for a life
Can't remember why I like this feeling
Falling falling on knives
Words can boost words can break
Smiling sins can do no wrong
Say something good if you speak
Good news never last too long
Forget the time too often
And I don't care to get some sleep
It's the skull I aim to soften
From there inside of you I'll creep
What did I expect to find
Dreams are not the same as life
More than the world inside my mind
Dreams empty into my life
What did I expect to find
Dreams are not the same as life
More than the world inside my mind
Dreams empty into my life
Heavy lids closing my eyes
Dreaming of falling asleep again
Blacken my visions of my
Life coming to a bitter end
Now surrounded all by strangers
Strangers I call friends
Help the species help to endanger
Darkness falling to play pretend
Forget the time too often
Inside your skull I aim to creep
See the soft spot in the skull
What did I expect to find
Dreams are not the same as life
More than the world inside my mind
Dreams empty into my life
What did I expect to find
Dreams are not the same as life
More than the world inside my mind
Dreams empty into my life
Heavy lids closing my eyes
Dreaming of falling asleep again
Blacken my visions of my
Life coming to a bitter end
Heavy lids killing my eyes
Dreaming of death in my sleep again
Blacken my visions of my
Life coming to an end <start> Santa lucia comadre de los ciegos
Haba hombre que daba baos de mecos
El hueso siempre creca
Con la vista de santa lucia
El dijo chupa mi verga
Ella dijo soy madre de pobres
Santa lucia se arranco los ojos
Con sus uas filosas
No quiso pito del buey
No quiso pecar
Santa lucia quiero tu ojos
Comadre de ciegos <start> Contained in blood scrawl compiled evil artifacts.
Insane instigators of ritualistic pacts.
Necronomicon bestial methods age old torrid acts.
If darker side thus beckon in limbo boundaries must be smashed
Delving demonic entrance connecting incantations.
 Doorway for unbeings past.
Induce recite summon reprise.
Bid welcome to Candarian 'Guise.
Possession escalates your confused eyes revert.
Senses nulled inert.
Induce recite summon reprise.
Bid welcome to Candarian 'Guise.
Your soul now quoshed with blinded eyes.
Your grasp impaired enlightenment.
Demonicus mortal. <start> They pass me when I close my eyes
Ragged lines of ragged grey
Grey their faces grey their hands
Grey the ghosts that haunt this land
Their pain it echoes through the hills
Through no one living ever left
This is Kolyma  a graveyard for the lost
The muffled sounds of cries and moans
Od swearing shooting and commands
They all disappeared in this big land
Where summer's harsh and winter kills
Where gold is hidden death's for free
And freedom came from weapon steel
This is Kolyma  a graveyard for the lost
The forest conquered all the camps
Broke walls cut fences down to earth
The forest conquered all the camps
Broke walls cut fences down to earth
Land of gold and land of death a graveyard for the lost
You gave the treasures you tool the men you'll keep them forever
 Kolyma  a graveyard for the lost
 Kolyma  a graveyard for the lost
The cold wind's crying for the lost
He knows the sites where they all lie
The wolves are howling in the woods
Howls like calling up the dead
I'd rather trust in ther fangs
Than mercy by man's hand
This is Kolyma  a graveyard for the lost
The cold wind's crying for the lost
The one who knows their names <start> My wounds are widely opened now
Time has come to plunge into despair
Darkness is the only wish of this world of sorrow
There is no place for joy in my bleeding heart
I cannot reach my innner peace
That I deserve in my griefful moments
Someday I will drown myself into my neverending tears
Someday I will see myself dying of eternal sufferings
My blood is frozen into my veins
All I can feel is this loneliness
Which has been invading me for countless years
Which is leading me to these eternal sufferings <start>  Give it up
 Just stop
Would you say that we are even now
I won't save you like you want me too
You won't break me like I need you too
And for the love of it let's give it up
You bring me down so low I think I'm dying 
You lift me up so high I can't survive it
I swear I'll never go back I'll never go back
But I always go back to you
You are the one your my only weakness
The wrong that I keep repeating

But I always go back to you


I am never free from you

Your always my mistake 
Just one big mistake 
This is where I'll sake my final battle
I can't fake this like you want me too
You can't me fix me I'm broken in two
Just one big mistake I'm giving up
You bring me down so low I think I'm dying 
You lift me up so high I can't survive it
I swear I'll never go back I'll never go back
But I always go back to you
You are the one your my only weakness
The wrong that I keep repeating

But I always go back to you


I am never free from you

I'll never go back I'll never go
Twisted and deeper
You're the only ones in my head
The world is my witness
I swear I'll never do it again never do it again
I always go back to you
I swear I'll never go back I'll never go back
But I always go back to you
You are the one your my only weakness
The wrong that I keep repeating

But I always go back to you


I am never free from you
 <start> I've had one desire since I was born
To see my body ripped and torn
To see my flesh devoured before my eyes
I'm here for you I volunteer as a human sacrifice
Chorus
Carve me up slice me apart
Suck my guts lick my heart
Chop me up I like to be hurt
Drink my marrow and blood for dessert
Eaten my one desire my only wish is to be
Eaten the longer I live the more I'm dying to feel the pain
Eaten I would do anything to be
Eaten my one desire my only wish is to be
Eaten
I finally found you my personal slaughter
As an appetizer I let you taste my daughter
Call me sick but this is what I need
My only purpose here is for you to feed
Desecrate me
Tear me limb from limb
Eviscerate me

And for a right to exist
Freedom from oppression
Drives my will to persist
I struggle in a conflict
Just to make my stand
Nothing lasts forever
Now my time is at hand
You have been warned
Tear away the scars
Away from my skin
Scrape me to the bone
It fuels my revenge
No one can save me
The weight of my burden
The pain and the hurting
My life is real
'Cause after the fall
I rise above all
'Cause after the fall
I rise above it all
I was made for war
Anger powered core
What gives you the right
You can't judge my life

The pain and the hurting
My life is real
'Cause after the fall
I rise above all
'Cause after the fall

Blow barricades away
This universe implodes
Reality unloads
Find yourself a thousand worlds
Pick the one that suits you most
Will a choice put you at ease
Than grab your chance to slay the beast
Keep searching for your destiny
And you will find all that will set your free
Keep moving onwards endlessly
To evolve and become on
One piece
The universe implodes
When our dream state explodes
Find yourself dreaming your life
Do you truly feel alive
Comprehend the sacred code
That makes your universe implodes
Keep searching for your destiny
And you will find all that will set your free
Keep moving onwards endlessly
To evolve and become on
Our ego will lead us to endless penance
This journey shall wake us don't dream forever
The Matrix of reality transforms the cosmic energy
Our ego won't spare us these endless failures
This journey will guide us don't dream forever
Rise
Nothing appears to be what it really is as we believe in the illusions
Free yourself from walking in circles
This will be the end of the world as we know it
Your ascension will begin
Keep searching for your destiny
And you will find all that will set your free
Keep searching for your legacy
And you will find all answers undoubtedly
Keep looking forwards endlessly
To evolve and unite the world to become one piece <start> As this eternal struggle has come to end
The light of life now shines upon us once again
But can we truly be free of tyranny and grief
I see a thousand points of light reaching for me
Now nature grows and blooms and people live again
Yet this is not the end I feel it
This power given to me is more than I can bear
Unbidden flowing through my mind
Divine it is but it could ruin this world
I see a thousand points of light reaching for me
Now nature grows and blooms and people live again
Yet this is not the end I fear it
I am the one to end this game
This world will never be the same
I have the power in my hands
The time has come to save all life
I'll do what it takes no more lies
I'll choose the destiny of Dragonland
A thousand points of light
The madness now have to end
I am yet to destroy the ones
The gods responsible for this
A thousand points of light
My final quest is at hand
To let people live their lives in peace
Without gods and without me
With great reluctance I reached into the light
I rise up to the skies enraged and full of might
They stand before me radiating azureblue
I'll fight them till the end yes that's what I must do
And I shall rid this world of gods to rule our lives
So now the end is here I know it
With all my force I strike them down
They scream in anguish as they drown
In fire they now turn to sand
They beg for mercy I give none
My live is over my quest done
I've saved all living here in Dragonland
A thousand points of light
The madness now it has end
I've yet to become one with
All one with universe
A thousand points of light
Dragonland is at peace
A thousand points of light
Is reaching for me <start> Pick your poison as dead beats do
Leave a wake in the hearts that hurt you
Pick your poison as dead beats do
Blood pulsing through your wounds
A thousand warnings are ringing true
Burning their homes writing in stone
The name of demons inside of you
You left your mark on this world
You left your scar on this world
You left your scar you left your mark
Wound them <start> Pretty luxury in the San Francisco airport. Boeing's prepared for its flight
to Warsaw. Custom clearance is almost completed.  passengers go to the
plane. They take their seats in comfortable armchairs. The machine takes off.
It reaches  metres in half an hour. Inside the plane there's a videomovie
on. Pretty stewardesses deliver cool drinks. The flight is pleasant. There's
nearly one hour left till the end of the flight. The navigator gets an
information on from the computer that an engine's damaged. the plane flies
down. There's too little time to take control of the situation. The plane
crushed somewhere in the forest.  people die at once. The spines get
severed from the base of the skull. it's impossible to survive it. The rest
fights for their lives. Branches pierced into someone's orbitals yet brain
lives on. Someone else lost his legs but still adhere on fragments of his
trousers. On the other side a young man escaped unhurt but can't a move. He's
pressed down by  kilogrammes of bowels lungs and kidneys of other
passengers. Some where else there's a young girl who coughed out a few
centimeters of her intestines. <start> 
Gone with the opening opening of the door

Gone with the opening opening of the door

Gone with the opening opening of the door <start> Darkness chokes my emotions your breath numbs my soul
Stand with me by my side take my hand and lead the way
Out from the shadows into the real world
Show me how to live a life owned by regret
My blood runs cold lifeless in shame
Now is the time to right the wrong
Inside my veins poison words lie
Within a mind as guilty as yours
Take what is left inside me
I've no use for it
Stained with thoughts uncaring
Open and let me in
Show your world deceit
Let me live as you
Need not to feel
Emotions rain down
Drowned by innocence thoughts escape me
Harsh words spit blindly and open paths of life
Take all that is me a lifeless somber soul
Curse the day you wake as solace sets in
I press my fist to the pillows wishing it was your teeth
Darkness chokes my emotions your breath numbs my soul
Stand with me by my side
Take my hand and lead the way
Out from the shadows into my world
My right soul is not for you to own
My right soul is not for you to own
My right soul is not for you to own
My soul is not for you to own
I will not live life to see your face your face anymore <start> The icebox is locked and I can't cool down
It's Louisiana hot  old dog in a new town
Round midnight why can't the light be found
Got me poundin' on the pavement wrestlin' with the ground
Sharkskin in a pig pen stirrin' up a sound
Pawn shop stacks a box of . rounds
Got a code to uphold contractually bound
said the icebox is locked and I can't cool down
Icebox is locked and I cannot cool down
Plastic palm trees and conspiracies dot the grassy knoll
The icebox is locked and I can't cool down
Got both barrels cocked and a young blood hound
There's an old butchers block where you pay by the pound
And the homecoming queen's waiting tables in her own crown
Belly up to the bar to buy the first round
Bartender surrenders says we're in a dry town
Son we can't serve you here he said with a frown
Because the icebox is locked so you can't cool down
Icebox locked and I cannot cool down
Umbrella drinks and cheap cigars while hot tub bubbles roll
Icebox locked and I cannot cool down
Plastic palm trees and conspiracies dot the grassy knoll
Born of this world of hate  Born of an orphaned throne
Born without a faith  Born of a broken home
Belly to the bar dark in the block
Draw an ace from the top of the stack <start> A dream become a creed a want become a need
a serenade for the tragic
a lover self confessed a circle truly blessed
emotional hegemony
Sanity on a shoestring a tripwire tragedy
oscillation between extremes
of agonizing sumblimity and sublime agony
Skirting reality with holistic perceptions
absorbtion of truths
wanted as evidence and evidently unwanted
An unprotected sensitivity a capacity to drink poisons
gladly court oblivion
by loving with death and dying to love <start> human dreams  such a fruitful place to plant the seeds of terror.
child i arise
in your dreams
as a creature  of dread
as a demon  or a wicked witch
what pleases me  i choose
i am the master  of terror
i create your nightmares
child  i am tearing you  apart
my mastery  can not be escaped
black claws tears your mind
black chaos  black terror
child  i am your pain
i'll engrave pain  into your soul
i will set your soul on fire
black flames will rise  as the gate
opens  into the realm  of the dead
here  you will sleep  eternally
and in your never ending dream
i will dance  and laugh
and i will feed

Imellom buskene vi stirret paa de
som minnet om andre tider
og fortalte at haapet var borte
for alltid...
Vi hoerte alvesang og vann som
sildret
Det som en gang var er nu borte
alt blodet...
all lengsel og sorg som hersket
og de foelelser som kunne roeres
er vekk...
for alltid...
vi har aldri levd <start> Land of unforgiving winter
Cold clad in white under a dark grey sky
Silent the wind it whispers
Pale sun of gold gazing from far up high
Endless forests lakes of water dark and deep
Misty mountains where giants sleep
Nordland
High about all the ravens
Spreading their wings to fly to the hall up high
Messengers of the all fathers
Oden behold all with his one eye
Eagle soaring old crow cries
This land and heaven forever tied
Nordland
Cold the waves along the shoreline
White wolfs realm from here to mountains high afar
Land of ours since it rose out of deep cold sea
Shine on our path yes brightest of all Northstar
Foreverdark woods cold winds sweep
Barren landscape untamed and bleak
Nordland <start> Wisdom infinite held tightly in my grasp
My sword one thousand battles strong
Ageless I remain beyond the reach of death
Indebted by my soul
I have witnessed the birthing of your faith
The tribulations the driving of the stake
So slowly this immortal coil unwinds
Until the end the end of fucking time
Blood of the ancient one is burning through my veins
The blood of gods man's never known
I am the one who cannot die
I am the the killer for all time
Seeds of infinite hate I've sown
I walk the earth enshrouded in its darkness
Eclipsing I claim the flesh of man
Ageless I remain with vengeance on my breath
Revolted by the meek
I have witnessed the birthing of your faith
The tribulations the driving of the stake
So slowly this immortal coil unwinds
This crumbing world has become mine
See the creation of this world
See it all reduced to ash
In the blink of a sunken eye
I see one hundred winters pass
My blessing my curse
Perpetually I'm damned to earth
Of a soul I am bereft
Forever dying to be dead
Slipping through centuries untouched by human love
Void of the simple pleasures that human life provides
Forever bound I lie in wait undying and insane
See the creation of this world
See it all reduced to ash
In the blink of a sunken eye
I see one hundred winters pass
My blessing my curse
Perpetually I'm damned to earth
Of a soul I am bereft
Forever dying to be dead <start> My mind seems buried
Murdered by your wish
While wandering the path of sadness
All rapture becomes mourning
You seemed so fragile to me
The opposite was real
Unexpected malice
Beautiful oasis turns to desert
Where the clouds gather with the sun
There I stood
Now the tempest is present
And I I drown in sadness
In my winds of dream
The night of the thousand suns awakes
every sun every ray darker than black
Thousands ideas of you Thousands uncried tears
Chained words
uncried tears leaving my eyes
endlessly deep ravines of sorrow
conquering my soul
Delivering screams in the darkness
sounding out of the misty paradise
far away the mystical unkown
deafening release
I please my heart
not to be my guide
strength is an art
but you are my bait
Inner uproar
Thunder like growl
leaving the hiding place
unable to conceal anymore <start> Call this restitute
Call this open truth
Call this my salute
Call this severance.
Call this retribute
Call this misspent youth
Call this my abise
This is my severance day
My way
and it's all of my soul that i give
and it's my way
Call this nondilute
Call this ill repute
Call this tainted fruit
Call this severance
Call this overshoot
Call this double proof
Call this my uproot
This is my severance day
My way <start> Life is like unfinished film
Like actors we change our faces
Playing our parts is not so easy
Under such circumstances
I can't say I know myself
But I know that I have
Pictures of my faces
Deep in my mind changing in time
Do we know ourselves
All the obscure things we hide
Are so different from
What we would like to display
We think we are so different
But we aren't we are the same
Pictures of me which I see
In my mind's eyes
My own performance like unfinished film
About real me
Just open your eyes and you will quickly see
That the worship the youth old age is what we fear...
The beauty would die... <start> 
I stood before my reflection
With a beloved adherent
Waiting beneath the cross for a purpose
To drink my tepid blood from the chalice
Impart thou in the text of Scourge
And cleft through the veil of the virgin
Purity is to live
To the highest and the highest is unjust
Fantasizing to the third of my gentile sight
In the gate of the mind appears
And arise with turbulence called I
The artfullness of the blind Shabbathai
For thee have I worshipped the Stars
I cried while you perpetually died
...On top of Black Montanus of thy Septentrio
Animus of an aged Tetragrammaton
With stains a lucid cicatrix of disgrace
With joyful elated Endeavour
O lilywhite goat
Frail as a thicket of thorns
With a collar of gold for thy throat
A crimson bow for thy horns
O lilywhite goat
You made ma Paganal dreams erroneous <start> Gracefully looking up to your idols
you get fulfillment in emulating them
Their seeming philosophy of life
more and more becomes a part of you
Decadent behaviour and hypocritical laughter
in their eyes the greed for fame
Sooner or later you'll recognize
that this truth is full of lies.
Refrain
Free your consciousness and breathe the scent of truth
It is time to strengthen your individuality
Look around and tell me what do you see
Truth and illusion  it's construality
I'm struggling to find the right words
words you hear and understand
Ignorance and foolish prejudices
are blinding the peoples' reason
But I will scream until you listen
enslaving your thoughts from apathy
There's no obstacle there's no border
no excuse that could stop me

I'm searching for answers still unfound
Words and lies keep circling around
Don't try to understand  just live your way
Raise your head above the clay <start> Aurora Holder of dawn keeper of all in the sky

So precious alone
These faces of everyone
Remind me of home
You're plotting riddled sin
All my needs giving in
Blow me a kiss and leave me to the dogs
So you think you got it
You think you know me
You wanna bring me down
I am in my finest hour
Ridicule my own
So precious alone
These faces of everyone
Remind me of home
You're watching me dying
How am I looking
Why don't you take a picture
You're plotting riddled sin
All my needs giving in
Blow me a kiss
And leave me to the dogs
My fear traps me waiting for it
My past is glowing red and yellow again
Run back where you came from
Not that it matters
I'll never see you again
My fists strain to sift mercy
Ridicule my own
So precious alone
These faces of everyone
Remind me of home
You're plotting riddled sin
All my needs giving in
Blow me a kiss and leave me to the dogs <start> Silence is as golden as piss <start> Originally performed by Stevie Wonder
No New Years Day to celebrate
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring no song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day.
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart.
No April rain no flowers' bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June.
But what it is is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you.
No summer's high no warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze no falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies. <start> Roaming the plains
where a number is your name
In a palace
And you'll never find the door
Oh look into the mirror
Is it what you wanna see
Or just a cuddle toy
The vogue has washed ashore
No I don't care what you say
Into the darkness I plough my way
I'm striking out for paradise
To be the one I am
We're going down to the devil
We are striking out for paradise
To bedlam below  down to the devil
The mad parade is coming home
Can't you hear the sound
As they make the hammer pound
Rusty nails into a coffin of your size
To bury you alive
you mature until you're ripe
Then they reap you
When you're beautiful enough
in their eyes
They lurk to wall in your belief
Put up glass ceilings that you can't see
To break down the freak
They don't want you to be
We're going down to the devil...
Oh we're going down
Here's your invitation your instigation
Your damnation to the hellfire club <start> Tomorrow is here
Damned by the speed of time
Imagine when becomes where did it go
Mindless people
They shake hands and smile
I should introduce myself with a slap
A nation of a million fools
Programmed by the media's mainline
Logic and reason
How does it escape your thoughts
Half the truth enveloped in lies
Face life with a vengeance
Shattered by an instant death
A bloody end to a hopeless life
A nation of a million fools
Programmed by the media's mainline
And then a chilling thought
The point of madness
Left in a grip of terror
Left to try recapture myself
With a gun to my head
In a grip of paranoia
With a gun to my head
My spirit stands alone in a room
A bloody end to a hopeless life
And then a chilling thought
The point of madness
Left in a grip of terror
Left to try recapture myself
With a gun to my head <start> Lyrics M. Schulman
Lead Wiklund  Kjellgren
Darkness and warlust unleashed
We have destroyed the golden void
Sent to welcome the fear
Sent to crush the sparkling flames of hope
Hellish hatred is our infernal source
Mighty blasphemy gaines our sacred call
Into the darkside of a dream untold
Burning wrath and the seven bullets of joy
Total misanthropia  Total armageddon
Genocide and the rising crest for war
Words of light you whisper softly
From beyond we reveal the force
No forgivness nor human mercy
We rape and ruin your last shades of beauty
Total misanthropia  Total armageddon
Genocide and the rising crest for war
Our deeds  Will live on and on for centuries
With fear  You will look back and remember the deleted past
Forget your future  The nightmare is present for now and forever
Global terror  We are here to carry out the final downfall
Lead Kjellgren  Wiklund
Hellish hatred is our infernal source
Mighty blasphemy gaines our sacred call
Into the darkside of a dream untold
Burning wrath and the seven bullets of joy
Total misanthropia  Total armageddon

Forget your future  Forget the disgusting words of love
Forget your life  Bury your dreams of eternal peace <start> I As One And I As One Stand Alone
Wipe Away These Prophetic Things I See
Diabolical Experimentation Of Myself

I Shall Reign On Mountains High
Into The Storm Of My Eyes
And You Will See It Before Your Demise
All Of My Children Of The Earth
Come To See My Temple On Mountains High
And Celebrate For The Rebirth Of Me
We Will Bond As One To Form Legions Of Hate Power
Overwhelming
Crushing Destroying Sowing The Seeds Of Haste
Forever Growing And Changing The Will Of The Other Man
Killing Themselves To Be Reborn Again
Reborn Is To Die A World Demise
So Many Things Are Happening
Birth Is Painful And Tasteless
Testimony To The True Apocalypse
Winter Solstice In A New Generation
Succumb To My Orifice Witness A Violent Sight
They Will Bleed Onto Me
You've Seen The Rebirth Of Me Fall Down And Worship

It Is Thy Will Or Be Killed <start> Staring into nothing
Questioning what is real
We don't share the same reality
Personal perception
Life's your own creation
What you see now is really what you really
Lost beneath the silent sky
Yearning to know the reasons why
Want to know what's out there
Want to be made aware
Of what we cannot see but feel
Where does it begin
And where does it end
I want to venture out beyond what is known
Lost beneath the silent sky
Yearning to know the reasons why
Lost beneath the silent sky
Yearning to know the reasons why
Don't hesitate
Make your own way
Lost beneath the silent sky
Yearning to know the reasons why
Lost beneath the silent sky
Yearning to know the reasons why <start> Above the high temple ov matter
Svastikas ov time slash the heaven
And from the pit from the slime
From the thought
Gliphotic intruder decays

Nonmanifestation born in the dark ov a day
Can you hear distant desert call
And stone you see  by Adytum builders
...rejected damned
Deeper deeper in the night world fear
Towards the noctuary ov the truth
From the mirror we crawls out
Devouring Eden's light
In the tunnels ov Seth he abides
Shugal The Howler
Who am I Where I'm going Where
We live dreaming
Slipping from body to body
And nightmares still our breath
And his in our souls
Poisoning with the venom ov existence <start> For the love of god will you bite your tongue
Before we make you swallow it
It's moments like this where silence is golden

No one wants to hear you
No one wants to see you
So desperate and pathetic
I'm begging you to spare me
The pleasure of your company

I'm burning down every bridge we make
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm leaving out every word you said
Go to hell for heaven's sake
I'm burning down every bridge we make
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm leaving out every word you said
Go to hell for heaven's sake

No one wants to hear you 
No one wants to see you
So desperate and pathetic
You think that no one sees this
I think it's time you knew the truth
I'm burning down every bridge we make
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm leaving out every word you said
Go to hell for heaven's sake
I'm burning down every bridge we make
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm leaving out every word you said
Go to hell for heaven's sake
When did the diamonds leave your bones
Leave your bones
You're not a shepherd you're just a sheep
I'll cut my depths of everyone you meet
Your own flesh with no bones
Feed them to the sharks
And throw them to the walls
I'm burning down every bridge we make
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm leaving out every word you said
Go to hell for heaven's sake
I'm burning down every bridge we make
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm leaving out every word you said
Go to hell for heaven's sake
Go to to hell for heaven's sake
Go to to hell for heaven's sake
Go to to hell for heaven's sake <start> And the road becomes my bride
I've stripped of all but pride
So in her I do confide
And she keeps me satisfied
Gives me all I need
And with dust in throat I crave
Only knowledge will I save
To the game you stay a slave
Rover wanderer
Nomad vagabond
Call me what you will
But I'll take my time anywhere
Free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home
And the earth becomes my throne
I adapt to the unknown
Under wandering stars I've grown
By myself but not alone
I ask no one
...And my ties are severed clean
The less I have the more I gain
Off the beaten path I reign
Rover wanderer
Nomad vagabond
Call me what you will
But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll never mind anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home
But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind
And I'll take my find anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home
But I'll take my time anywhere
Free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home
Carved upon my stone
My body lie but still I roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam <start> Got me some secondhand traumas
They transformed mind into flesh
And lead to the untimely death of the child inside
Fall asunder... now
And bleed like me see it's easy
Don't want to be the only one to feel this way
They say when a wound is deep
It hurts the most when it heals
Growing inwards in the quick
Don't want to build a womb around me
Don't want to drown in amniotic fluid
Don't want you to say what I want to hear
Can't you see or feel at all
Must we turn to such drastic measures
Is suicide attempt the only cry for help you can hear
A hand on a shoulder that writhes away
The mnemonics of this play is way to strong
Don't want your help but I want to heal
Cross my heart I hope you die
As you go boohoohoo
No hate no more
No more bitterness no more
Nothing matters anymore
I'm not in pain no more <start> music Puolakanaho  EToS
lyrics Puolakanaho  Vetelinen
I can recall the sweet symphonies of my lost side
She filled my dreams with the enchanting aura
But the sweet days of delight were buried in dust
On the battle fields of the unholy hordes
Sometimes blood paints all to black...and we can't see all the colours
Sometimes the blood of faith stains our hands...and fills the grail of
unholy
I can feel the warmth of those brightest nights
But the shadows still haunt my heart
Over and over again I can see her dying in my arms
Can I ever gather the shivers of my past
Sometimes blood paints all to black...and we can't see all the colours
Sometimes the blood of faith stains our hands...and paints the soil of
unholy
Kill...or be killed...
For your roots...and this land...
Live...for the Ancient ones...
Blood of faith...stains my hands
Now my long night is over and the flames witness the new dawn
I'm on the northern throne all alone
Once again I'm here to face my painful past...
Without my queen of the northern star
Sometimes blood paints all to black...and we can't see all the colours
Sometimes the blood of faith stains our hands...and fills the grail of
unholy
Kill...or be killed...
For your roots...and this land...
Live...for the Ancient ones...
Blood of faith...stains my hands <start> He's just a face in the crowd
a nondescript man
a dim witted mouthful of lies.
Football on the TV
beer in the hand
the extend of his rational depth.
He's a god fearing man
a while beating fuck
a vacuous flag waving fool.
Rip out his heart
feed him his dick
gut him like a hamstrung deer.
Kill
kill that man... <start> Trembling soft skin wrapping
Shuddering warm flesh
Blood pulsating through the veins
Tool insertion
Science not perversion
The end result justifies the pain
Twisted human flesh
Lovely smell of death
The sight of naked skin
The treasures deep within
The colour of the blood
Every curve and cavity
Morbid fuckin' lust
Smell of death is what I need
Don't you mind the never ending
Fucking killing aich
Just you think of what a damned
Good looking corpse you'll make
Substances injected
Glands and blood infected
Gasolin and peroxide
Sharp cold steel cuts through the skin
Revealed is the within
The chest is open wide
Twisted human flesh
Lovely smell of death
The sight of naked skin
The treasures deep within
The colour of the blood
Every curve and cavity
Morbid fuckin' lust
Smell of death is what I need
Sliced down into the finest
Seethrough shiny meat red leafs
You have proven how damn beautiful
A corps can be
Clitoris liver and brain
Desict sliver and maim
Pincer and razorblade
Samples jars neat labels
Plastic bags and containers
Photographs of every slain
Twisted human flesh
Lovely smell of death
The sight of naked skin
The treasures deep within
The colour of the blood
Every curve and cavity
Morbid fuckin' lust
Smell of death is what I need
To wash the blood off
Of my damned hands
To get them really clean
I'd need to fuckin' wash them endlessly <start> Where are all my friends now
Acquaintances have come and gone
Past along the road of life
Familiar scenes and photographs
Stand tall
Forget
Stand tall
They're dead
Life has had it's up and down
In past they'd be around
There to lend a helping hand
Friends are often in demand
Enemies and friends just coexist
Jealousy puts me on their hate list
Magazins spells truth in my own words
Recreate the hell they all deserve
Reassured that they've all gone
Once I thought they'd be along
They live behind a platic mask
Such a self assuring task
Censored values empty visions
No preditions no decisions
Mother loser living at home
Never left the nest to unknown
Bewildered in the face of danger
Obesely structured fallen angel
Mommy dearest is his savior
Laughing at the newest stranger
Enemies and friens just coexist
Jealousy puts me on their hate list
Magazins spells truth in my own words
Recreate the hell they all deserve <start> Say what Well come again
Do you think you can change it
It's just a matter of time 'til it all will end
I'm a wreck and so are you
We're all wrecked up
I got a date with the devil and so do you
Will our bad luck even turn I doubt it man
I think we're destined to burn alive yeah
We have lost
But you refuse to realize it at all cost
And the futures now
Isn't that tomorrow
How can a man be so blind to see a wreck
Is the only way. I'm a wreck
Say what. Yeah well come again
Do you think you can change it
It's just a matter of time 'til it all will end
I'm a wreck  and we're all dead
We're all wrecked up
I'll be rockin' and rollin' in hell instead
So put on a smile and I'll light the ignition
This is real time it ain't cinemavision
And yeah the time's right now it will never be tomorrow
So don't ask how I can fit six billion in my car
Drive it off a cliff
Go out like a dinosaur
Here I am balanced on the edge
And it makes me fucking scared <start> Why can't I breathe
Still I see
Dead on the table.
Try to move I'm not able to.
They said I have died.
I still felt alive.
I won't believe their lies.
I can still see through these
Eyes.
Help me I'm not dead
Wake me from this hell.
Tell me I'm alive.
Dead.
Knives cutting into me.
Scalpels rip me.
Screaming into deaf ears.
Now they stop and see my
Tears.
Help me I'm not dead
Wake me from this hell.
Tell me I'm alive.
Dead.
I can't stop the visions.
Stop the premonitions.
My soul can't escape
The boundary of my flesh.
My heart does not beat.
My spirit does not rest.
They said I have died.
I still felt alive.
I won't believe their lies.
I can still see through these
Eyes. <start> Will I die or survive
From this hell made of ice
It's up to this mountain to decide
What will happen to my life
The more I climb
The freezing ice
Intensifies
And paralyze me
A dreadful avalanche
Behind me
Enslaved to this mountain
I shall be
Amputate my Chilblains
Handless arm remains
My frozen body
I behold
Slowly turning
Stiff and cold
Smell the sweet stench
In wind's blow
Of lost carcasses
In the snow <start> Dormancy
Spirits await rebirth
From their sleep
They will soon awake
Restless dead
Catching the wiff of hate
Blood they anticipate
They will soon drink
Murderers
Subconscious attraction
On their graves
Blood will now spill
Ancient bones
Reform in grounds below
Born as the blood will flow
Killing is all they know
Blood
They live they thirst
Blood
Coalesce
Pieces become a whole
For their strength
Blood is absorbed
Rancorous
Aeons of building rage
Death an immortal cage
Now they are freed
Livid beasts
Rising now for revenge
From the past
Hate comes alive
Tenebrous
Restruct evil ones
The demons will come
Cruelity has just begun
Blood
They live they thirst
Blood blood
First one that they find
Attack the mortal
Claws tear at his face
Pull the flesh from bone
Decapitate the man
They hold his head aloft
Headless body slumps
The blood is gushing out
Screaming victims fall
Repulsive beasts attack
Gore pours from the torso
Hellish creatures stab
Organs grisly trophies
Rewards for their rage
Blood drips from their jaws
They disembowel the corpse
Kill with speed
Victims bleed
Wretched souls
Headless on poles
Savage thirst
Vesseles burst
Torn apart
Eat the heart
Vengeance taking form
Endless hatred for the living
Plunderng the world
Paroxysm of the damned
Rapture of their rage
Euphoria from butchery
A dark world will eclipse all life
Barbaric ways forever reign
solos Owen O'Brien Owen O'Brien
Blood
They live they thirst
Blood blood <start> I'm the statue cold and dead as stone
I'm the darkness a hidden fear in  middle of your heart
I'm the silence the deep of the night
I'm the beauty the dreams of love and  hate of your life
I'm the everything...
I'm the light at end of your lives
I'm the fate and I'm the time
I'm the feelings of your desires
I'm your helplessness in delight
I'm temptation in the darkness of  night
I'm your new age messiah
I'm the eyes of your dying god
I'm the revenge in me 
I'm your mother I'm your daughter blinded eyes by colors
of  darkest lights of me I'm the fire I am the wind
I'm the water the rain that's falling down at your lips
I'm the sorrow and flowing tears and I'm all  pain you feel <start> A living giving corpse so weak
A sacred path where do we fall
Desired anguish fear of life
Makes martyrs of us all
Delusioned prayers fill the air
A hopeful soul is hard to see
Human cruelty frozen in time
A world so hard to feed
Nothing seems to matter
The rain begins to fall
Nothing to believe in
Even angels learn to fall
A trantic march into the sea
Being hunted to extinction
This human bond of frail mortality
A tarnished ground of true conviction
A teardrop falls behind closed walls
There's so much more of life to see
The closing of the door
The mind and so much more
A broken moment to believe
Torment and anger
Runs through my veins
Leaving me cold inside
Surrender your feeling
Unfolding is the veil
Turning love to despair
This anger
A silent rage
This anger
A silent rate <start> Coldness let me perceive my breath
I look around but norhing is here
Nothing but extensive blackfields
A threatened atmosphere lies over the land
where am I
I awake in forgotten worlds
In which I walked in every dream
And I walk through silent fields
There is no hope  there is no fear
I only hear the ground grating under me
I run  but where There  a light
I see the angel of death is saving me
But I know I will never come back
this is my world <start> Big black used grease vat
Spilling over with saturated fats
Ruining my jerky complexion
Month late for due date of collection
The plasma of fast food
Naked in a vat of crude
Eyes roll back in my head
Bathing in a grease disposal unit
Fresh remnants of flesh
Dripping with animal cess <start> Music M. KelsonG. KloproggeO. Alexander
Lyrics M. Kelson
Why do I suffer
Darkness consumes my soul
Trapped in this torment
Emptyness fills this blackness
My blood runs cold
I feel so lifeless so empty
Don't leave me this way
Death overwhelms me
Our love is stronger than death
Even beyond the grave we are together
We are one in eternal damnation
Our love is forever
My cold flesh caress' yours
Your warmth is what I crave
For you I would die your slave
Darkness surrounds I close my eyes
But visions of you are all I see
Suffering brings me to my knees
I scream for redemption but torment overwhelms me
I see you in my sleep your last gaze burnt into my mind
Covered in your warm blood I cant let this be
My life incomplete for part of me has gone
My heart remains with you as I wander through the mist of dawn
Our love is stronger than death
Even beyond the grave we are together
We are one in eternal damnation
Our love is forever
I want to taste your last dying breath
I need to die a cold morbid death <start> I can't seem to find my place
In this land twisted by greed and vanity
There's no rest
In this broken dream
Broken Dreams 
Is there no release
I cannot
Let my life fall into this sleep
In this dream
Am I just
Nothing more than a consciousness drifting through time
Close my eyes I'm falling through the void
Into translucent worlds
Beyond all space and time
We can't see we can't see beyond the veil
How could I have been so blind
I know now there's so much more
Look through transcendent eyes
To see dynasties wage a war
It's time to wake up
It's time to wake up
It's time to wake up and see
That this world is torn
From an infinite contention
But we sleep in bliss
But we sleep in this dualistic domain
Blinded by selfish gain
I can hear voices of deities
That wage their war in the skies
Hiding through the mask of the ages
Enslaving the hearts of mankind
Close my eyes I'm falling through the void
Into translucent worlds
Beyond all space and time
We're all slaves we're all slaves to what we can't see
We must grasp that there's more to
this place
Than vanity
This won't become my grave
When this life bares down on us all
Rise above and never let go <start> Running or hiding you'll never escape
Live for the promise now you won't betray
You try to leave I'll hunt you down
Eyelock at first glance first living in romance
Years down the path there is no second chance
Until you pass you will be mine
I'll never stop to find a way
You dug your grave now you will pay
I'll never stop to find a way
You dug your grave
Promises made till the end you obey
Trapped in my web there is no other way
There's no way out this you will learn
Plead as you will my mind you can't change
Drift to illusion your thoughts rearranged
Abandon me now you will burn
I'll never stop to find a way
You dug your grave now you will pay
I'll never stop to find a way
You dug your grave
Living my life to obliterate yours
Beg for forgiveness now down on all fours
Too late to turn the hands of time
Human condition to lie and to sin
Heart into pieces now nobody wins
The mental scars can never heal
I'll never stop to find a way
You dug your grave now you will pay
I'll never stop to find a way
You dug your grave <start> Spr wie die kalte Glut
in deiner Seele brennt
Sprst du die dunkle Macht
die dich vom Leben trennt
Wir sind die schwarze Lust
im Schoss der Einsamkeit
Wir sind das letzte Licht
vor der Unendlichkeit
Wir sind die Kinder
Wir sind die Kinder der Nacht
Sind aus den Schatten
der Dunkelheit erwacht
Sprst du wie schwarzes Blut
durch deine Venen schiet
Sprst du wie die kalte Lust
sich in dein Herz ergiet
Wir sind die schwarze Macht
Die Saat der Dunkelheit
Wir schlieen einen Pakt
fr alle Ewigkeit
Sprst du wie schwarzes Blut
durch deine Venen schiet
Spr wie die dunkle Macht
sich in dein Herz ergiet
Wir sind die Finsternis
Die Kraft der Dunkelheit
Wir schlieen einen Pakt
fr alle Ewigkeit <start> Sounds of revolution calling everywhere
It' s time to leave the past behind
Roaming through the shadows
Crossing seven seas
Deep inside the inner flame is alive
Running for an Odyssey far away
Hiding from our shame
To the gate of no return
Running faster running high
A million miles away
We believe in destiny
Never stop for anything never walk alone
Sleepwalking on endless seas
misery and thorns
Star rise and lead me home
Powerful kingdom of happiness
Challenging the fortune a fascination rises
Deep inside with clarity in mind
Creeping through the emptiness
Dangerous  try to hold us back
And break the stairway down
Never stop for anything never walk alone
In our dreams and fantasies and my dreams are
fading
Bound to be reborn light in the darkness
Star rise and lead me home
Powerful kingdom of happiness
Over the rainbow we' re touching the sky
Ride into distance we' ll find our way
Over the rainbow we fly to survive
Glide on illusions of better days
Demon shadows master of sorrow
Try to catch our soul
Salvation is on the way
Never stop for anything never walk alone
Keep our faith in prophecy
my dreams are fading
The power of the crown hold the crown
Star rise and lead me home

By this contagion
Alone abandoned
In search of legion
Under pressure
Under black skies
We must find the cure
Before we die
I can see the bullets rip
Inside the crossfire
My suicide run through
The razor wire
All must endure
We will not live forever
All must endure
We will not live forever
Terror awaits me
At every turn
Honor is stronger
We fight all at once
Hate spreads like wildfire
In foreign lands
Incurable pain is this
Gun in my hand
All must endure
We will not live forever
All must endure
We will not live forever
Who wants to live
Who wants to live
Forever
All must endure
We will not live forever

All must endure for the mercy of one

Mercy of one <start> Something is blowing in the wind
A chill rips up your spine
Stops you dead right in your tracks
You're running out of time
You know there's nothing you can do
Drop right to your knees
Satan's wrath from the skies
Inflicting disease
Rain rain. rain rain of terror
Rain rain. rain rain of terror
Enough to burn your eyes out
Death runs through the air
You know your life is over
Acid everywhere
Death from above created below
No one takes the blame
In through the lungs straight to the mind
Damaging my brain
Rain rain. rain rain of terror
Rain rain. rain rain of terror
Blackest anger from the skies
Coming down on you and I
Killing life blood melting Earth
No more chances for her rebirth
Something is blowing in the wind
A chill rips up your spine
Stops you dead right in your tracks
You're running out of time
You know there's nothing you can do
Drop right to your knees
Satan's wrath from the skies
Inflicting disease
Rain rain. rain rain of terror
Rain rain. rain rain of terror <start> Neck deep we wallow and this floor catches lingering feet
By rope with heartbreak this is our happiest moment of all
We dream of flowers on the razorwire
and wake to the scent of our dead
We're sinking
And all of those times don't matter here
Remember my love
this is for the sinking and the strength of our wings
Be brave and bleed out the day
We left our body for the sky and ended up here
Listen to me don't let them list your feet
Our love is real <start> With hearts of midnight brightened by his infernal light
We stand as a monolith of wrath united under the goath of a thousand young
Two horns thrust upwards in defiance three inverted as the trinity denied
A phalanx of mourners in black falling towards nightly terror
Unleash the temted beast raised your horns in pridefull blasphemy
I'll be your guide into the glourious darrkness and enchant you like a taste of sin
Unleash the temted beast chant theron in words of blazing scorn
Grant me my dark desires strengthened through the power of satan
Take plesure in the torment of the wretched
And rejoice in the delight of the flesh
Behold the face of satan
And walk the fields of erotic fire
Hunt the heavens ...
Godless temted beckon
Through gleaming scapes of horrid nightmare
Gathered between symbols and signs
A glow of new light is born out of the night
Give into your lust and carnal desires  in twisted blooddripping ecstasy
In the name of satan  i lead you into temptation
 <start> You're on your own this time
This time you're on your own
And I can't believe I let you do this to me
You're on your own this time
This time you're on your own
And I can't believe I let you do this to us
Taken advantage of forced 'I love you'
Of forced 'I love you' and broken goodbyes
Taken advantage of forced 'I love you'
And broken goodbyes
Incomprehensible broken goodbyes
Love is such a game to you
Love is such a game
Love is such a game to you
Love is such a game

One more time for our memory

One more time for our memory

One more time for our memory

One more time one more time for us
Love is such a game to you
Love is such a game
Love is such a game to you

 <start> I am the snake redirected The left hand path paved with grace I am the lifeless that sheds its skin Swallowing myself in completion of the total self The endless round of existence Crushing all destiny of hope Completion within isolation Hell divine through six blind eyes Blank face of the transformed Breaching this cross you bear The black stares down Beholding the greatest slain A first step out of this old age A trial of lies once where wings soared Sits scars of a fallen icon Torn from this back of freedom We all descend to the lower world Rise Changed Venom of rebirth to engulf all Burial head down Inversion of punishment Expulsion to the sea of disloyalty To never see again Entwined inside Chaos consumed This future of undying Rise of the uncrucified As the serpent climbs the cross of shame An unbound virus of agnostic rage Tainted skin with a touch of the perverse Cast away fron an unjust form of freedom Transformation of the snake A new oblivion of blasphemy She dding the skin of what used to be This war waged as all the horns of Jericho begin The death of all your deities Suspended from grace Worship a raised profit of nothing Filtering of the insane Perpetual feeding of this seed of chaos Embracing this revelation of entire dusk Fuse this self attained consuming of worship Milking the fated in resurrection for triumph <start> Feet to hip
Leaf to breast
Throat to brain
And skin arrange
Now we're one soul
Reviving memories
To every blade of grass the universal path
A primal energy
A creation is born unsympathetic chords
Hearing Adam's murmur
A Sanskrit alphabet
Unholy apple tree
Seven flowers
Feet to hip
Leaf to breast
Throat to brain
And skin arrange
holes in our trunks
I tap her to test
Harmony within
A merciful creation
Hearing Adam's murmur
A Sanskrit alphabet
Unholy apple tree
Seven flowers
Feet to hip
Leaf to breast
Throat to brain
And skin arrange
Feet to hip
Leaf to breast
Blood to brain
And skin arrange
Now we're one soul <start> Do you know the story of poverty and suffering
Do you know the story of shame and loneliness
A cold winter and a cold heart that stole the life
Of an old man
No pity and an ice cold room now he was left alone
In loneliness
He met his doom
Ignorance we feel it
To break out of this game
Blow for blow we fight back
Shout it out we are men
'Subhuman creatures' got to die for industry and science
Just to make Mrs. Rich smell nice
Watch the many beggars roaming streets and doorways
Just a piece of bread just a coin and for them a dream
Comes true
It's a shame to have money and ignore the need
Closing your eyes makes your mind turn greedy
Want and need are the same for us all
Black or white rich or poor
Can you sleep quietly when you hear the cries of despair
Can you live your life without fear
Look at those wankers they don't care what's going on
People people like that just think of number one
We're not able to cry
We suppress the truth <start> The waters have grown calm. The boat meets it's mark.
So I wrap myself in these self made binds
As the clouds begin to creep begin to creep.
Make sure it digs in these shackles of words.
The blood means it's working so bring on the frenzy.
The water soothes it's the salt that stings. Fins all around all around me.
The water soothes it's the salt that stings bring on the frenzy.
Concrete eyes and ivory smiles concrete eyes and ivory smiles.
You know why you're here you could smell the blood
You know why you're here you could smell the blood
You know why you're here you could smell the blood
You know why you're here you could smell the blood
You are the shark so bring it in closer if you want this feast then we'll do it tonight
So turn it red
Oh <start> The day has come the time is near
For all to end. It's true it's here
It's all over now no way to stop
The button's been pushed the bomb's been dropped
The city is melting the sky burns red
The ocean is boiling we'll soon be dead
Death has come knocking the door's open wide
He's let himself in no place to hide
A tidal wave of power coming over the hill
A great well of thunder swooping down for the kill
Leveling destroying everything in its path
Just seconds left now till we feel its wrath
The city is melting the sky burns red
The ocean is boiling we'll soon be dead
People run rabid from the great blast
The beast is upon us it's here at last
The streets echo screams filled with fear
All through the universe but no one will hear <start> Take me to the other side
Beyond this world I know
Through madness eternal falls
My sanity will flow
Here I will be
Where the rivers of madness stream
Down the gules to a pit of dream
My sanity defiled
Now I leave behind
To plains immortal
I unleash my mind
Here I am not lost
These sights are not strange to me
And I shall not dwell alone
Within my insanity <start> Applause
This is a lifework at its end
My discouraged part of a suicidal trend
Loss increase
while deep inside I'm on my knees
The gun beside me whispering
May I kill you please
End of it all
I'm following the sweetest call
Leaving what has begun
Beginning what will last forever
Take me away
'Cause I don't want to stay
You don't need to cry to see
What is happening to me...
Loving you is killing me
Loving you  The pain that sets me free
Terror to the masses
It's all this life can offer
And it's always choosing me
Blame it on the needs
Of a million souls that hate
Love lives somewhere nowhere
And it's hiding from its fate
Trust me
The sun is growing dark
My god is down and empty
And he is suffering the same as me
Growing inside my heart
My dreams fail from this day
My love has turned to hate
The ones who hurt me have to pay...
Loving you is killing me
Loving you  The pain that sets me free
Terror terror terror to the masses
Terror terror terror for my life <start> Closer one step closer
One step closer to me
Show yourself your real face
It's time to clear who'd you be
I wanna know what can you say
Reasons are what I wanna hear
Speak about you about your life
That relegated me
Away go to hell away
Don't wanna control me
You try to make me blind
But you lie to me I see
I got truth on my side
And I do what I like
That's all I can say
Go to hell away
Don't wanna judge me
Don't judge me
Don't wanna bind me
I can't live that way
Closer one step closer
Try to tell some more
You can't... than give up my friend
That's the only solution I know <start> those who will not use their brains are no better off than those who have no brains I can't get this fucking feeling outta my head so this mindless school of jellyfish become a useful beast of burden You've gone and pushed me too far now I wish you dead But time has covered all the innosence with lies Faith was something that I used to have PUSHING PULLING DO THIS DO THAT WOULD'VE KNOWN WHAT I KNOW NOW IT'S A TRAP Rape and take from me what I make For you it's a job for me a mistake Machines are made to destroy all that's sane I can't take this no more it's time that I hunt you down and kill you I'll never forget you or your fucking name I've taken this as far as I'm gonna take it Stay outta my way let me be alone You get in my face I'll fucking kill you Get out of my life I don't need you I've taken this as far as I'm gonna take it I'm gonna find a way to fucking kill you You pushed and pushed and pushed me over the edge Now I'm searchin for a way to have you fuckin head Watch the life flow from your veins as I get hard Think of all the pain you caused me as I discharge As the bodies of my enemies float on by My blood is pumping fast through the heart that you scarred Satisfaction from all I've achieved the smell of your rotting flesh I heave Now I've got this picture floating in head you lying in front of me covered in red <start> Repetition of my behaviour
Is an everlasting course of scenes
That run after one another
Fixed points of a vicious circle
That I wasn't able to break
Of a schematic existence
As futile as my own behaviour
My life is a long journey
Through the desolate ways of time
A course of infinite sensations within myself
Companions of my destiny
Unrelenting and obscure omen of death
A sad certainty
The sole step of my existence
Which will make me alike those around me
I've ever lived without thinking about it
Jealously keeping within me
The phobia of what will happen
That morbid fear which day by day
Has worn out my thoughts
Rendering my life a slow agonizing suicide
Giving birth to my deepest anguish
Aware of not existing
Revelation of the obscure omen
Achievement of my destiny
Now I realize I've never really lived
I think over the infinity of things that I could have done
But my courage failed
Desires... never fullfilled
Dreams... never realized
Because of stupid fears
I feel I have thrown away a lot of time that was at my disposal
During the journey of my life
Into the obscure abyss of forgetfullness and depression
That journey which was not so long as I imagined <start> I've sold my car thrown in my job I'm  years old
I think it's time I saw the world and not Australia
I've sold my car thrown in my job I'm  years old
I think it's time I saw the world coz I hate the cold and rain and grey
I'm going to Spain
Cousin Norman had a real fine time last year
He said it doesn't rain
I hope I can quickly learn the language yeah
I hope I can quickly learn the language
And the factory floor presented me with some tapes of Elton John
I hope it might keep me company but I hate the goo googoogoodbyes
Coz I'm going to Spain
Cousin Norman had a real fine time last year
I hear it doesn't rain
I hope I can quickly learn the language yeah
I hope I can quickly learn the language yeah
My mother cried last Friday night
When I said that I'll be gone
She packed it up and then cashed in her premium bonds
And I'm going to Spain
Cousin Norman had a real fine time last year
They say it doesn't rain
I hope I can quickly learn the language yeah
I hope I can quickly learn the language
I'm going to Spain
I'm going to Spain
Better rate culture there boy
I'm going to Spain
Cousin Norman had a real fine time last year
They say it doesn't rain
I hope I can quickly learn the languageeh <start> I know nothing but CHRIST and HIM crucified
Ignorance misleads fetters and deceives men
A deceived heart turns from GOD
And the eyes and ears are shut
Having the understanding darkened
Alienated from GOD through ignorance
Because of the blindness of the heart
Yet HE stands at the door and knocks... Receive HIM
Unconscious deterioration of man
The worshippers of themselves reject GOD
And know not that they are miserable poor blind and naked
Satan has blinded the minds of those who don't believe
They worship themselves as their gods
The only way to ETERNAL LIFE
Is an individual relationship with GOD through HIS SON
For those who are perishing
The message of the CROSS is foolishness
But those who have received CHRIST
Will have EVERLASTING LIFE
If you believe HIM and receive HIS word
He'll treat you as HIS disciple
Then you will know the truth
And the truth will set you free
I know nothing but CHRIST and HIM crucified <start> Blurring the line between abortion and infanticide
D and X. the most impious form of terminating tots
Dilation and evacuation such a problem for the doctors
By the second trimester infantile tissues are tough
Making adequate dismemberment and removal difficult
But the dilation and extraction procedure eases the grisly task
Children gruesomely murdered before they leave the womb
This full term abortion is obvious baby butchery
Tell me mother can you feel the child kick
Your unwanted pregnancy soon to be hacked away
Umbilical cord cut but a tiny navel never tied
Another dead papoose for the prochoice side
It's immortal and obvious butchery
Pulling the wee babes legs into the birth canal
Entire body delivered except for above the neck
Cervix won't dilate the head cannot pass
Blunt surgical scissors stab the cranial base
A suction catheter is inserted into the hole
The premature brains are vacuumed out
As the tiny soft infant skull collapses
The disgusting evacuation is now complete
Tell me mother can you feel the child kick
Your unwanted pregnancy soon to be hacked tied
Another dead papoose for the prochoice side
It's immortal and obvious butchery
Infanticide legally done by detestable physicians
The Freedom of Choice Act soaked in baby's blood
Instead of adoption a massacre eventuates
Another generation of children they exterminate
Abortionist guided by an ultrasound screen
Using forceps to tear the babe from the womb
Eight months with child now the cuntbag chooses to kill
Her offspring's brains sucked and bodily bisected between her thighs <start> Thus ends the fifth battle
By the treachery of men the field is lost
The night falls and great is the triumph of evil
The league is broken
The last vestige of hope lives in the hidden king
Only he troubles the dark one's mind
Only he could bring ruin to the black foe
Though the land lies down in agony and the curse lives on
A new star shall arise
And a new day shall come again <start> Chorus
Girl 
This time 
I swear 
on my name 
believe 
that baby it's all over now

Thought I was made for you
and you believed in me
I thought this was how love was meant to be
didn't know it
but you were foolin' me around oh
You had a hold on me
I was too blind to see
Could've been yours for eternity
Didn't see it
til it was all up in my face ah nono
Do you recall the times that we shared
moments alone and your promises but
now the days are gone
now you're on your own tonight
never again 'cause
Chorus
Now I know the truth
It really hurts inside
'cause every lie just twists the knife
the way I'm feelin'
there's just no remedy
Do you recall the times that we shared
moments alone and your promises but
now the days are gone
now you're on your own tonight
never again 'cause
Chorus
Ya hit me with the truth
hit me with the raw fact
put me on my back what you gotta say to that
You got me with your lies
I was thinking we were set
counting every second every day since we met
Remember in the times when we used to have it all
but then came the fall feeling like we hit a brick wall
Now You can keep it the lies in my ears
You're gonna shed tears as your man disappears
Yo Sit back and let me do my thing
Laced with the click with the  on the swing
I'm not the one who's gonna be plagued by your kind
 girl it's time to rewind
It's over just like a wack track you can't get with this
so you gotta get with that
No doubt in my mind the base so phatt
baby let me bring it on wiggy wack now
Chorus <start> Ura Fucking Loser
as i bake in this rancid oven that we call earth
hard to breath
thru filth and muck that rides our air
all i taste
the bile phlegm collects within
feeling like shit
again again again again
URA FUCKING LOSER AND YOU ARE NOTHING
never rise
stuck within the depths of wich i dwell
no way out
feel i'll meet my maker soon
i'm just waiting to die and take a different form
i am cold
smiling as hate keeps burning in my soul
URA FUCKING LOSER AND YOU ARE NOTHING
NOTHING
you're a fucking loser
that's all that you'll be
you are a fucking loser
not me
YOU'RE A FUCKING LOSER AND YOU ARE NOTHING
FUCK OFF YOU AINT SHIT <start> The Old Ones were
The Old Ones are
And the Old Ones shall be.....
A temple of shame
He is caste in the neverending maze of darkness
Waiting for the light's embrace reaching the path
To the once distant shrine of his atonement
Hope of repention buried under an ocean of forgotten tears
Consumed with the pain of the innocent's gaze
The passage of time severing the shackles of his enslavement
An oath of damnation ordained by the mark of Cain
Reaping the winter's harvests from untold sins
Equinoctial winds rhyming dirges of enchantment
Chorus
These bloodstained hands  Can they claim redemption
I can hear his word  Guiding me to the dawn of my descension
Shadows beyond time  Sentinels of yore
Dreams of the vanquished  Lycantropic eyes spin the web of communion
Beyond the blind sterility of a primordial conscience
The burden of sagacity the lost duality of fate
In this silent shelter the angel of light awaits
I am the nuptial gift to a dying surrogate <start> take heart attacks without cracking a smile and we learned from the guys who always get it right and if you lift us up you'll always let us down. when you're five feet away it should feel like fiftyfive. we never gave them a moments peace or the satisfaction of seeing us break down. the pen and the ink they stab start through the heart draws on lies and the feelings will start at the back of your knees and we'll watch through the holes strategically cut in your bathroom walls while you choke. perfectly timed and it's taken us years and the sickness still lives like cement in your veins. with your eyes glued back to these spots on your walls. perfectly timed and its taken us years to find in ourselfs the strength to concede. to admit that we're wrong. to admit to the things that we've done. this is my life i will not be ashamed. close to me. close enough. reach inside and take what you want. who's the one that picks up the peices on your own bathroom floor. found fault in almost anyone. ruined almost everything. sticks like the ords on the tip fo my tongue. looks for a way to come out all wrong. paper answers everything. we just like the way these words look on the page. paper answers everything. i can't find a thing at all in here. paper answers everything. at least it did. paper answers almost everything. <start> we die alte Juche allein jum Himmel weht

Und dort wo nachtlich Voglein schweigen
Dort will ich Anekdoten horren konnen.
Man spricht von den Flumen eines Jaches und wie schon sind. <start> When I was young I was taught to throw sticks and stones
Because sticks and stones they could break your bones
The only way to get ahead that made any kind of sense
Was to enrich myself at other people's expense
I could walk over corpses to make myself a name
I would cheat and I could lie without showing no shame
People tried to stop me but they didn't understand
I wasn't looking for affection or a helping hand
Why doesn't anybody listen
Why doesn't anybody hear
Why doesn't anybody see me
Why don't you interfere
Don't ask me why
I never told the truth 'cause I believe all my lies
I believed that if I made my own alibis
I would find a good reason and a better excuse
So I could justify my hate and my self abuse
I would satisfy myself in any way I could
Because I knew that I would always be misunderstood
I did a lot of mean things that are hard to forgive
But all I ever wanted was a life to live
Why doesn't anybody listen
Why doesn't anybody hear
Why doesn't anybody see me
Why don't you interfere
Don't ask me why
Looking back at my life there's a lot I regret
I made a lot of mistakes that I can never forget
But I didn't know better I was insecure
I guess I never took care of my problems before
I feel bad about the people that I pushed around
I feel bad about the people that I let down
I put the blame on myself I can't look the other way
Living with my guilt is the price I have to pay
Why doesn't anybody listen
Why doesn't anybody hear
Why doesn't anybody see me
Why don't you interfere
Don't ask me why <start> Selling limbs from a bag was always my forte I get my stock for perverted clients
This is my store
Thrust my rotting member deep inside her oozing gash pushing deeply
Pushing deep as deep as I can feeling blood squelch against my cock
I like the feel of the worms against my shaft
Fuck my stock just for fun just for kicks
I like the feel of the worms wriggling on my cock
Found my victim in the streets told her body I needed it
Then down in my basement I carved her
Storing her parts in jars for my clients
I drained her blood so to embalm
Death gets me off
I am sick and I cum bile. <start> Destroy the machines that kill the forests that disfigure the earth.
Ecotage when efforts to reason
fail and no longer have worth.
Direct action is the only choice when wild lands are faced with destruction. Now is the time
for counteragression. With every day that passes the assault
on nature accelerates. For the industrial nations' excessive
ways this world they devasate.
Every biome on every continent in under man's attack.
With everything to lose we've drawn the
line to hold them back. New bridges
roads and dams pave the way to develop what wilderness remains.
All must be prevented or
detroyed for the wild lands to sustain.
Fighting to save the animals. Their freedom is our peace.
For their habitats
preservation for the violence against them to cease.
Earth liberation through ecodefense. To halt the insanity of the yellow
death machines advance. <start> Valor they instill to face certain death in conflict
Win the war through discipline
Trained to follow orders
Dilettantes of war torn apart
Send them all to be slaughtered standard training set
In a dark distant foreign shit hole wretched torment
Approaching the vile sphere of contention
Breathing the smoke the dust
Bloodsoaked earth stained red oceans for your insides
Sudden hail gunfire half the men drop dead
Troops lost in transport waste of lives
Terrified grunts die confused
Send them all to be slaughtered
Insufficient base munitions
Compelled by the force to fight 'til death
Certain casualty amateurs
Who all die before they learn to fight
Ruthless commanders order them to rush
Upon their imminent abrupt ends
Strategy of attrition mobbing them
Flailing corpses use up ammunition
Bravery cut in half by enemy artillery
Or cowardice punished by friendly fire
Charge ahead expending divisions
Impotence gaining no ground
Bodies thrown conduct in war useless
Primitive only two ways home
Terrified grunts die confused
Reluctant and afraid to attack
How will anyone survive this
Only hope victory or death
Certain casualty amateurs
Who all die before they learn to fight
Ruthless commanders order them to rush
Upon their imminent abrupt ends
Dying in a dump ordinance erode tactics
Know what you must do to survive
Hiding in the dead lying still bare cover
Strike in stealth and then disappear
Forge ahead retiring their forces
Spilling their confounded blood
Undermine their efforts to defeat us
Running gun only two ways home
Dig in and fire until the way is clear
Pounding the ruins storms further defaced
Snipers take heads harass your progress
Take them out pierce their eyes through their scopes
Die for honor motherland strewn about piles of corpses
Losing every last brave man better than surrender
Inescapable nightmare resolve unflinching
Never bow to tyranny make them pay for every step they take <start>  <start> A strange cosmic gathering of leading forces
The ones that procreated this war within
A saga of crushing emotions
Bonded and melted by the eyes of the lost years
The cursed root of my damnation
May my destiny be the one i've created
The real motive to continue this battle
Rest will never be found until the other face of the infraworld has been conquered
Endless voyage full of hate
Infinite road covered with pain
This gift of fury the awakening of the beast within
Honour and blood no failure will be done
The fortress deceptive mind of a saddened spirit
Claim the scythe my sceptre of frozen grief
For this is a neverending tale of scorn
But with every soul I have devoured
The vengeance just fades closer
Near the revelating storm <start> Instrumental <start> Pale shines the moon above me
It lights my way through the desert night
How much further do I have to wander
How much more must I sacrifice
Mentioned only by the mad one
The nameless city  shunned by all
What awaits I can't imagine
In my thoughts the poet's words I recall
That is not dead which can eternal lie
And through strange aeons even death may die...

Lyrics O. Alexander
Deep within the evergreen woods
An old gravestone alone it stanto times of the ancient past
Dismal winter gloom surrounds this forest
Chills sweep across octobers path
May this y be darkness. . .
Everlasting snowfall from this day forth
In winter for evermore
Everlasting snowfall from this day forth
In winter for evermore. . . <start> O Satan I acknowledge you as the Great Destroyer of the Universe.
All that has been created you will corrupt and destroy.
Exercise upon me all your rights.
I spit on Christ's redemption and to it I shall renounce.
My life is yours Lord let me be your herald and executioner.
My actions shall lead other hearts away from salvation
All shall acknowledge Your sacred royalty and crawl in terrified devotion.
Where is the book of truth or the inheritance that'd enlighten me
No voice shall answer to my probe and throbbing prayers...
But certainty and madness write in ashen letters
And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him and He in him.
And hereby we know that He abideth in us by the Spirit which He hath given
us.
The essence of Revelation lies in the fact
that it is the direct speech of god to man
Sola Fide. Sola Deo Infernali Gloria.
Seest thou how faith wrought with his works
And by works was faith made perfect
They burst my veins to pieces these wan rats inside
With their jaws so contagious of a disease
As if it dropped like pus from the twelve wings of Sammael
The primeval light inside gift of god and the holy spirit
It bleeds so swollen by the bubo of this pest divine
The least traces of the consolation of Eden
Were consumed by this heinous blessing in ashes.
Sola Fide. Sola Deo Infernali Gloria.
My god and lord of this earth
you shall henceforth be the sole object of my thoughts.
The essence of Revelation lies in the fact
that it is the direct speech of god to man
Verily I say unto you there is none righteous enough to resist no not
one...
For your hands are defiled with blood and your fingers with iniquity
Your lips have spoken lies your tongue has muttered perversity.
The heart of a lost angel is in the earth the immaculate is abased...
forevermore.
Neither stormful convulsions nor an apex of light shall break the yoke
For he that keepeth His commandments dwelleth in him and He in him.
And hereby we know that He abideth in us by the Spirit which He hath given
us
Sola Fide. Sola Deo Infernali Gloria.
Wilt thou know O vain man
that faith without works is dead
Some rejoice of the children's innocence and smiles
Others of their shameful defloration by the ministers of Christ
swollen by arrogance and lust
Jesus spoke words of wisdom Let the children come to me
What's more enthralling indeed than ruining through them the genesis of life
itself
Dive deep into the blue eyes of the newborn and thou shalt get a glance of
heaven
When this dive reveals despair hideous ruins of the glory of Hell
The serving sons of disobedience proclaim Vengeance belongeth unto Him...
Oh how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy
who hath trodden under the foot the Son of God
and hath counted the blood of the covenant
Faith and devotion shall be the stones to the temple
Fanaticism and intransigence ignite the flaming crown of malign essence
That is Your host Lord and our burden. Hosanna
Sola Fide. Sola Deo Infernali Gloria.
Seest thou how faith wrought with his works
And by works was faith made perfect
Sola Fide. Sola Deo Infernali Gloria.
My god and lord of this earth
you shall henceforth be the sole object of my thoughts.
Sola Fide. Sola Deo Infernali Gloria.
Wilt thou know O vain man
that faith without works is dead <start> Let it be for you a great and high mystery in the
light of nature that a thing can completely lose
its form and shape only to arise subsequently out
of nothing whose potency and virtue is far nobler
than what it was in the beginning.

I can't explain to you you'll never understand
Can't open up to you you are forever damned
I can't be one with you the blood is on my hands

Torn apart by this the life that failed
I try I try to see through all this
Darkness surrounding this monsters burn

Devoid of virtue

A terrile vision I see in my dream
The sky in the net of evil eyes
Spreads its embodied rage over me
A silent scream from the deep
Of my mind throws the gates open...

Where your hope will be destroyed
Your fate is written in blood
I set out on the river of souls
A burnt raft on the night rivers
The sorrowful voice of the riverside trees
The roaring wind the anger of gods
A silent scream from the deep
Of my mind throws the gates open...
Welcome to the land of sorrow
Where your hope will be destroyed
Your fate is written in blood <start> In the middle of last night she went out to get her revenge
On the black witches they tried to kill her
They tried to sacrifice and burn her soul in flames
Some unknown force came and freed her
Burn the white witch
Burn the white witch
Death bears a sickly smile. Will the fools ever learn
They still smile when their own death is near
She has got more power than you will ever know
They tried to harm but it's too late
Burn the white witch
Burn the white witch
Standing by your shadow
You're eyes are full of tears
You cannot seem to unwind yourself
You have killed death and fear
Forever and ever we are free
Together forever for eternity
She died early this morning from the spells of the dead
Death had its own way and won
Now she can rest in peace and sleep inside her grave
She cannot be harmed anymore
Burn the white witch
Burn the white witch <start> Dry riverbeds end in no man's land
Empty oceans full of waste
We lead ourselves into all man's end
All that remains is a bitter aftertaste
The sea has shed all she had to cry
A shoreless wail which came here to die
Just like an eagle in the sky
I want to spread my wings and fly away
Crying silence is falling over me
Lonely king of the air in deserted skies
How I wish that the end like this wouldn't be
Clipped wings before they learned to fly
Each drop of life spilled into the flood
Acid tears in sweet rain like red raining blood
We're trying to water from deep within
The desert sands of time with our weeping
One with the rain <start> Carpathian dream bloodthirsty beast
Preying on man every drop of blood a feast
A wraith in the night calls your name
At the mountain top burns the eternal flame
And from the flames they will come
Seven times seven
Vengeance of the ancient ones
Defier of heaven
Dreams of the living shall be no more
The dead shall rule this rotting world
Demons returning from the other side
Heaven is burning there will be no more light
And from the flames they will come
A memory of the evil ones
To once again walk the earth
Arcane horror set to birth <start> Slowly I move across the room. Where are you
Silently I cry trying to decide. Who are you
All these things I've shown you more or less
are all the things I know to be the best.
It's what I do.
Here closely we lay mostly to wait for some room.
Then vacantly we speak empty and weak.
How are you
All these things you've shown me go against
all the things we know to be the best.
So what'd I do Tell me. If it's not me...
It's you.
How do you want me to be
What can I do to make you happy
What do you want me to say
When I speak the truth you take it your own way.
All these things I've shown you more or less
are all the things I've known to be the best.
It's what I do. <start> Written by Southern  Ritchie
Enter a land where the sky still bleeds
Empowered to turn every mountain into sand
And fears to dreams
Falling from grace bears a price I've learned
Blinded by this you can dance in electric fields
Where the fires still burn
Still waiting holding on
Colder than grey colder than grey
Still waiting holding on
Drawn like a moth to the flame
Frozen utopia's slowly steaming
Only the touch of an angel can ever heal
The silent screaming
Sacrifice all of your hidden demons
Promise me this
Will you wade through the clouds of calm
And come to no harm
Some things just have to be
What's meant for you will not pass you by
Some things are meant to be
Under and over the sky
The eyes of the world
Addiction is priceless they're watching and waiting
The eyes of the world
The blood that is raining is so entertaining
The murder in the skies is calling you calling calling
The eyes of the world
Addicted to pain and so blind to the warning. <start> Alone I stand. Together we fall <start> We don't know with what weapons world war three will be fought but world war four will be
fought with sticks and stones. This is not the end of predicted danger.
It's your disgrace
But you made it well
So the world can tell
It's your face
It's on the fire that burns inside
And I see the light
The colours of your heart
And they're slowly changing
The colours of your mind
And they're slowly fading
It's all in vain
So time does what it will
Try asking whose to blame
For a throw away existence
I see...the light the way
Nothing of the past
And were disappearing
And nothing gonna last
The end is nearing
chorus
Changes changing
Seven days into nevermore
Learning turning
Seven days into nevermore
You're a grain of sand
In the desert that was mankind
I don't understand
How all of us are blinded
By the light blinded
Turn another page and there's no beginning
We are just at an age and time is winning
chorus
Seven days...nevermore grain of sand
You know the score desert man...
He needs one more seven days to nevermore
To nevermore to nevermore forevermore <start> I am in the center between sound and body
The middle ground
is where ideas and illusions mingle
and new theories are given birth
Nucleus
Heart
Sterilize both in fire
I am in the center between sound and body
The middle ground
is where humility and embarrassment repel
and old methods are covered with earth
Thalamus
Tachycardia
Suffocate both in fire <start> Tears of rage
Have fallen of my face
I cannot hide
My dreams keep holding me tight
To be alive
Is the gift and goal of mankind
Creative minds
So brave but hard to find
Show no fear  your head up high
Time goes by and arrows fly
Have I lost my mind
The truth now shows that I was blind
It made me change my mind
It's the circle of life
Tears of a coward tears of shame
I found my way to win this game
Do your best just stay awake
What you got no one can take
Have I lost my mind
The truth now shows that I was blind
It made me change my mind
It's the circle of life <start> Obscurity hides the plateau
Stars darkened at their place
Nanna's glowing above
Illuminates the silent scenery
Seven they areYeziti's Call
Aeon of nightEager to prevail
From the mountains of dawn they cry
The call of the frantic god
From the womb of mother earth they scream
The wage of creation and sin
Seven they areYeziti's Call
Aeon of nightEager to prevail
The sleeping lord awakes
Tiamat pulls on her chains
The blind phantom rages
AzagThoth Howls
Vibrations at the black ethers edge
As nocturnal fear penetrates the land
Ecstatical celebrations at their zenith
The seven sharpen their claws
Winds emerge from the east
Deep dark water moves
Even the cold moon eclipses
When they adore the dogfacedbeast
Seven they areYeziti's Call
Aeon of nightEager to prevail
As they admit the infernal tide
The eye on the throne derides
The old gods and their tribes
In chaos Tiamat laughs pride.
Seven they areYeziti's Call
Aeon of nightEager to prevail <start> Roy Khan
One of a kind they say they've never seen before
Investigate the aberration disorder in the core
Tobias Sammet
I never tried to hide away or tried to keep your pace
You walk me to the slaughter with a smile upon your face
From the cradle to the madhouse a twisted mind
There's no way out of this hell for twisted mind
There's no way out
There's no way out
Roy Khan
You've come to see the healer so don't you be afraid
They call me tranquilizer I'm here to isolate
We paint in black and white and you're the dirty in between
Monstrosity of nature a virulent disease
Chorus
Can't you see can't you see
That you are not like anyone
You'll never see through anyone else's eyes
And who am I to certify the sanity of a twisted mind
A victim of perception a twisted mind

Missprizing  chastising
Subhuman  fragmentizing
Sensation  aberration
Repulsive  tantalizing

From the cradle to the madhouse a twisted mind
There's no way out of this hell for twisted mind
There's no way out x <start> We've played our roles in our passion plays
They've impossed on us right from the cradle
No matter what you dream beware of what you say
Until the coghweel's out of control to burst out of place
No time to breathe don't have no time to waste
Bring on the night seize every drop of life away
Slice a tasty hour from 
A stranding future bring it on
Mystery of a blood red rose
Burning like a raging fire
When the day's been torn apart we'll leave it behind
Mystery of a blood red rose
Feasting on a blind desire
Let the scent of poisonous flowers tempt me away
A sweet tempation and a pure red rose
While the hour don't wait for a blink to cram the past
I'll get a move on
No hesitation makes no one a better man
I can't wait to finally know now what is gonna show now in
Mystery of a blood red rose
Burning like a raging fire
When the day's been torn apart we'll leave it behind
Mystery of a blood red rose
Future glowing on pyre
Let the scent of a poisonous rose tempt me away
Boy reach out for what is due
Or you'll lap up what's left for you
Throw ourselves into the waves
And as the grinding wheel of time
Is grinding out the chimes
To echoe in the night
We're off into the moonshine
Mystery of a blood red rose
Burning like a raging fire
When the day's been torn apart we'll leave it behind
Mystery of a blood red rose
Future glowing on pyre
Let the scent of a poisonous rose tempt me away
And I will waste no time tonight
And I don't waste no time AT ALL
Tonigtht <start> Youngsters prostitute themselves
It's all part of the game
Wwalking up amd down the pavements
That bears both stars and names
Automatic fire
Sacred amendment guarantees
To kill or be killed is yuor own business
So fire as you please
Liberty  Justice
Crack the substitute for new highs
The hooker and the gunman
Barely more than a fucking child
And up the fucking hills
Silicon mummies by their pools
Sips their fucking drinks
And smile over their preserved youths
Liberty  Justice
I pledge allegiance in God we trust
Down the hood and up Wall Street
From the church and trough the school rooms
The decieve is but complete
Mr. Smith and family sits still
And pray over their fucking apple pie
And down the ghetto the law enforcement
Accidentally guns down another child

Lyrics Dave Rotten
Searching Through The Gloomy Night
An Innocent Young Student
Mainly Girls Mainly Gays
They Are The Weakest Preys
Lurking In The Darkness
Surprising Them From Behind
A Hard Strike On The Head
Snatching Their Consciousness
The Corpse Must Be Alive
While He Takes It To His Home
Then Bound To An Armchair
Down In The Basement
PreChorus
Shaving The Head
And Drawing Pattern Lines
Right Over The Skin
Where To Make The Cut
Opening The Skull
Exposing His Brain
The Victim Is Still Alive
Shrieking In Pain
Chorus x
A Spoonful Of Grey Mass
Sweet Lobotomy
PreChorus
Shaving The Head
And Drawing Pattern Lines
Right Over The Skin
Where To Make The Cut
Chorus x
A Spoonful Of Grey Mass
Sweet Lobotomy
It's His Debility A Delicious Caprice
Only Reserved To Privileged Minds
Every Neuron Must Be Alive
Right From The Skull To His Mouth
All His Knwoledge Will Be Increased
Eating The Biggest Amount Of Brains <start> Floating in this strange mood I can feel the return the coming the Desert withthe sun as my witness
but Blackened in desolate ways we are wandering Bleeding...
These geometric agony that I have stand for all this centuries expecting the arrival of the old rider
The Master of Mourn...Scream over the Dream's remains
I must find the root of my Damnation in every drop of the torid seas of Sin and in every night of Soulless winds
Bathe in restless Flames Crush and Slaughter the False ones...
My prophecy of revenge and destruction Is rising from my burning chest. <start> The triumph of the underdog
Questioning the world
A higher gain of circumstance
Lest we forget
For now the case is clear
For now the fellow rescued
When truth is what we fear
Then fear is nevermore
How could it all have come this far
And now  how do we cope
The best it seems is to shut up
And let bygones be gone
When all we have is here
There's nothing left to witness
So don't deny what we're
And let's just mind our business
Hope is the devil
The devil is mine
Devil reveals
What a fleshdevoured skull you are
Oneeyed among the blind
Now you see you can't forget
You wish you'd never known
The more there is to hide
The more there's to uncover
So welcome to the other side
This trip here is hell
Fool
Don't you see now
that I could have poisoned you
A hundred times had I been able to live without you.
Fool
Don't you see now
that I could have poisoned you a hundred times
...had I been able to live without you. <start> I wanna be thin like you uhh
Thin as my monthly payment.
I could wear your dresses baby
By the monday night by the pale moonlight
I'll enjoy to wear your stilletos
Your pajamas could be perfect for me
I'd rummage your wardrobe baby
By the monday night by the pale moonlight
I wanna dig in your dump 
I wanna dig in your dump 
I wanna dig in your dump 
I wanna dig in your dump 
I wanna be a dancer
As good as you are
I could pinch your ass
When I hold you tight by the pale moonlight
I adore the mega mess
You got inside your head your brain will be my bed
I wanna dig in your dump
When I hold you tight by the pale moonlight
I wanna dig in your dump 
I wanna dig in your dump 
I wanna dig in your dump 
I wanna dig in your dump 
Skin and bones
Crocodile gloves
She loves the jazz
Baby be my guest
Skin and bones
Crocodile gloves
She loves the jazz
Baby be my guest
I wanna be thin like you uhh
Thin as my monthly payment
I could wear your dresses baby

I'll enjoy to wear your stilletos
Your pajamas could be perfect for me
I'd rummage your wardrobe baby

Crocodile gloves
I wanna dig in your dump  <start> Great and pounding in its way
Stirring the roaming cosmic sea
Oceans rise planets igneous fall
As chaos and beauty in fierce rage
Furious are the storms
Forever its rage carries on
Disintergrating to create upon fate
Wearing the web of solar cast
Hasting the view of Everlast
Exploding Imploding
Ascending Descending
A spear through life and death
Exploding Imploding
Poised in all chaos directions
In fierce affection
Spawning the orbs of furious light
My sons of fire you're children of the storm
Breeder of life harvester of all
The last breath of the fall
Exploding Imploding
Ascending Descending
A spear through life and death
Exploding Imploding
Poised in all chaos directions
In fierce affection
Weaving the web of solar cast
Hasting the views of Everlast <start> The journey went on through a black
forest of misfortune.
Woods of murderers and scum.
Far away they heard laughter.
Many eyes followed them.
Narog scented their were being watched.
Ref.
The second trial is awaiting you.
In the battle I will be on your side.
My sword will kill for you.
The scum attacked from the ambush.
A violent battle began.
The bodies of the scum were torn into pieces by the swords.
The blades were drilled deeply into the scum's bodies.
The silence turned into beastly screams. <start> The culprit you act before thinking
Caught in your ignorant sin
And lying to your own reflection
you thought you could hide
Deprived of my own innocence denied
The infinity of recurring torment your comeuppance
See hear the torture inside
Devouring what was left of my pride
You thought it's not going to happen to you
thought you could hide
Deprived of my own innocence denied
The infinity of recurring torment your comeuppance
Dwelling in a mind mixed up and
Your regret has spread over the sea
Deprived of my own innocence denied
The infinity of recurring torment your comeuppance
Dwelling in a mind mixed up and
Your regret has spread over the sea <start> Clouds of grief sweeps across the horizon
Drowning in crimson glory
Decayed remembrance of an ancient era
The fog of the ocean will always encounter itself
The air shed tears from eternityis mighty well
An the distance a mournful cry
Passed on by a guest of wind
A soul of solitude
Forsaken forgotten
Crossing the bridge
A soul of solitude
Forsaken forgotten
Crossing the bridge <start> Coliseum the coliseum
Look out burn you ought to know this by now
You with the empty crane over
They're the gate keepers and the sentinels
Their jokes are humdrum
The coliseum the coliseum
The coliseum the coliseum
Brown brass leading up to ionic columns
Trust them sometimes that is not enough
In the vast cavernous emptiness
That is the world of the callow
A bus stood outside at bottom
The coliseum the coliseum
The coliseum
Trust them but sometimes that's not enough
In the vast cavernous
The coliseum the coliseum
And you gotta have a good condition
To get into the coliseum
And the jinglejangle of this city
Makes you hunger and down
You gotta have a good condition
To get into the coliseum
The coliseum the coliseum
The coliseum the coliseum
Brown brass leading up to ionic columns
But sometimes that's not enough
Their jokes are humdrum
About  to  tiredness sets in
You want to take a little break
And get out of home
The coliseum the coliseum
Brown brass
You've gotta have a good condition
To get into to get into
These people they will never ever learn
They are not fit to walk through
The ionic columns of
The coliseum the coliseum
You've gotta have a good condition
To get into the coliseum <start> 
You tell me
What will become of us
Are the lines so drawn and the stage so set
That as we age what remains is burdened sufferance
My mortality looms in its visage is doom
And it's speaking to me alone
The years will unfold but what is the use
In solitude I'm left to atone
The sins of my past
Are returning to gnaw at my core
The scars I have left
And those that have been left on me
My purpose in life
Is it unfair to assume I have one
I'm not fooling myself
What now awaits is a nightmarish end
What I'm saying do you understand
Do you know what it's like to feel inadequate
And the future ahead has no place for you
As if you ever thought it did
Alone in my shell if I come out I'll die
I don't want to escape though I should
No just leave me alone I don't want your help
Yeah if you could ease my pain you would 
No you don't even know me
And your words of comfort fall upon deaf and frightened ears
I lament my bitter fate
Lachrymation upon examining my fears
I've built a fortress around my soul impregnable the door
I refuse to admit you to my netherworld
You're correct I've absolved my selfcontrol
This spiraled course depression has me on
Ag only
I'm a study in despair
Domineered by the promise of agony
And the happiness is bound
And the hopelessness is found
I'm in agony
Can't you understand
Despondency commands my agony
And I'm waiting to die alone
As I'm drowning in sea
Of abused visions and shattered dreams
A chilling descent into a phobic hell
Insanity's blade performs it's correctional surgery
Impending doom in this blackened room
I can give this all away
It's all so easy to capitulate
Nothing is making me stay
Retreating within
And hiding behind my wall
Dealing without
There's no escape from this moribund state
Awaiting deep sleep
We don't care if I don't wake
In darkness' hands
Though terrified I feel safe
I don't fit into the scheme of things
These years as an outcast are quickly wearing thin
My carefree days are a thing of the past
And I welcome the fact that I'm coming to an end
Melancholy my bride I devote unto thee
My breath my mind and my soul
As silence washes over me
I've never been so tired so cold
Confusion seizes onto me
Manacled and beaten chained up by its frozen vice
This is killing me
But my mind is set and I'm too weak to fight
Have you any idea what It's like to want to die
Then you will know from where I speak
This winter in my soul
This winter in my soul
And I want to be left alone
Yet again I have no answers
The confusion of my fate takes its toll
Symbolically speaking what's another life
That lists ending itself as its one and only goal
I've examined my options and I see nothing in sight
Is there an avenue I've yet to explore
As of now I'm decided
I have nothing to live for
Defeated alone
Yet you laugh at the state that I'm in
I can't help what I am
But you think this is all in my head
I'm not asking for help
But I want you to understand
That I'm going away
You guess if I'm coming back
You wish I had a will to live
This condition I'm in didn't happen overnight
I've hated myself for an eternity
Now I finally feel that I'm doing something right
As darkness descends I behold the candlemass
I seek intimacy with death
Again you're correct these feelings will pass
When my memory is all you have left
My life has metamorphosed
Into a marriage of the twisted and macabre
I'm sitting here now feeling the effects of my words
Trying to see a reason why I should go on
I have to wonder do I still believe in God
'Cause God no longer believes in me
I lay myself down for my final peace
I welcome death my spirit is free
And I'm pleading to die alone <start> The magnificent structure straddled the river
As I dictated my autobiography to my biographer
When I heard this tune
My title was Renegade Genius
But was interrupted much too soon
Was interrupted much too soon
I received this line
Twister
From me in Hampstead he received a letter
I headed it Dear Twister
Up from West Hampstead I visited Keswick
On permission from the guard
I begun like this but could not continue it
When I heard this tune

My ears were burned
By this tune
My head swooned
By this tune
Twister
The train from London on day of lunacy
Was packed with innocents
Children tended by walkman'd parents
Cretins auditioning
For nonexistent parts on TV One
The train was a tube
Within the crushing beauty of the countryside
On the LondonKeswick run
Twister
My head burned...burned...da da da da..my ears burned..
countryside has sold out..countryside...cheap phone calls home...

twister <start> Yeah
I'm leavin' the same way I came in
It's lookin' forward but I can't see straight
It's just like I know where I'm going
It's just like me to fool myself
I'm right here bitch
Buried by the words of a liar
I'm right here bitch
But I'm alive and I'm still breathin' yeah
That day becomes so haunting
You didn't say enough we were mistaken'
My mind plays it over and over
Slow motion
But we're moving faster moving faster
So much further
Let's not lose control
Light a match just to watch it burn
Struck
Light a match just to watch you burn
Where are you goin How far
Where are you goin
Let's give them HELL
That day becomes so haunting
You didn't say enough we were mistaken'
My mind plays it over and over
Slow motion
But we're moving faster moving faster
So much further
Let's not lose control
I'll bite the bullet
Just to save myself Oh
Oh no this ship is quickly sinking
We gotta take control gotta take control
Oh no this ship is quickly sinking
We gotta take control gotta take control <start> Flying high on a hit of crack need to find some speed
Hit the liquor store the companionship of a whore
Drunk and driving stoned and frying
Severely impaired to see group of pedestrians in front of me
The music is loud laughing at the church I make an evil smirk
All of a sudden the car goes crash.
My mind goes black smashing into a crowd
Standing on the corner waiting to cross the street
Ice causes a man to slip head goes under the tire
Brain death life for him has expired
guest vokills by Donavan Breazaeale of Autopsy Commission  Terry Christbutcher of Excommunion <start> Take this meager offering
Accomplice to your conspiracy
Break down my configuration
Hoping to find a better day
It's never what they say
It's never what they say
It's all about the silence inbetween
Into a pain that works for me
The blod of angels
Behind a door we learn to bleed
The blood of angels
Make this another sacrifice
Affording the vulture's appetite
Bring me a slice of consolation
Knowing that there's another way <start> Reality breaks into your mind
A flash of light cuts through the head
You search for clarity cannot find
Your mind is dull your eyes are blind
Scream for help but no one hears
A dark tornado distorting ear
Try to escape as you turn around
Nailed by fear down to the ground
Floating
Slowly reaching consciousness
A feeling overwhelming in distress
The focus slowing returns from dead
Realizing creatures face above your head
Evil expressions facing through
Internal experiments based on you
Paralyzed by cosmic horror insane
Surrealistic screams of panic of pain
Floating through inverted spheres
Floating through inverted spheres
The world of hysteric silence
Expanding by abusive violence
Growing red in organic disorder
Apathetic attempts to reach the border
That will free you from this insanity
A shapeless dimension of humanity
Paralyzed by cosmic horror insane
Surrealistic screams of panic of pain <start> Same time the exact same place
You've got the uniform on so clich
What a waste of my time
You are all the same
Destroy the name
Disgrace or did you forget
All the things that made you stand out
Run in place
Can't go any farther
I won't be the same
Creating my own way
My own way
The pawn plays the king but there's no board at all
The mindset of children that can't stand on their own
You raise up your hands in conformist salute
Will you follow the crowd or will you follow you
I won't follow you
I won't follow you
Who's left they're dying off
Caving to the pressure from my enemies
Blank minds surround me
The flag you wave is dead
And you're too blame
Not bending to your ideals
Or manufactured rules you've put in place
This is not an altar
I won't be the same
Creating my own way
My own way

Are you receiving
Message send <start> False tales lies of a washed up prom queen
Why'd you tell me everything was fine
Everything was okay
Get on your knees
Oh why you tore me up
No why everything's dead inside
Oh you could've told me at least I would've known
No you should've told me and carved it in my bones
Tear out my eyes to remove the gift of sight
Proves ever cursing still the light can't find us here
Painted red my eyes are burning
And still you hide behind the waves
Your silence is so haunting
Your words relentless burying in
My heart betrays me for a last first kiss goodbye
Fall asleep and jar one eye
Spilling every lie you've spilled before
But I'm not forgiving you
What happened between us what can I give to save us
Being righteous isn't quite enough
What happened between us what can I give to save me
These oceans are far between our hearts 
The breathing has got too hard
Scream with the voice of an angel
Lie in the name of the gospel
Smile in the face of your victims smile for me
This is my last request to you
Hold my breath
I was clutching on to disaster
Hold my breath <start> Slit down from the thorax to free all
the gas that should not be there
the cerebrum will have not survived
upon close examination from the chest to the skull
has show the movement of fluids that the surface refused
coinjections have failed to prepare the remains
there's much too much to be saved decomposition has claimed
what was an animal frame with it's organs and brain
will be dissected and then reduced to mush
It's not to be chopped to bring you power
it's only to be devoured
what is it now that you throw doubt upon
don't ask of things you not meant to have or know
have or know
Preembalming purge and rotting pigmentation
extra firming fluids and hardening compounds
nasal aspiration. <start> Spirit side dreaming
Let your blood flow
A last grasp
At your dying faith
I will eat your soul
Your suffering is mine
I'll be your source of pain
Dead ends now entwine
Phastasmal being nightmare creature
Your death to be sustained
Repeating your act of painful demise
The will to live forever maimed
Demon resurrection
Come die with us
A bloodstained path to oblivion
Scarring both mind and soul
Fuel my evergrowing hate
As I devour you whole
Soul devourer
Lifeeater
I bringer of bitterness
To forever be
Forever sleep
With a hellbound heart
Where pain is born
Carved in flesh
Another object of my art
As I did you also learn
Screaming as our soul burn
The meaning of your severe pain
Your crawling flesh dies again <start> ..og nr mrket kaller gr jeg atter inn
jeg lukker porten bak meg porten til mitt sinn
jeg stenger verden ute alene i min ensomhet
jeg legger hodet p min pute trene faller en etter en
leve hvert sekund av et liv
d hvert sekund av en dd
Omsluttet av mrket min lengsel og mitt savn
Tidens hjerte slr langsomt mens blodet enn er varmt
Mine sanser har forlatt meg kun dden gjenstr se
Et skritt i riktig retning p den lange spiralen ned
..og du forsvant bort fra meg du forlot dette sted
n er det bare kulden dele natten med
og mrket finnes der ute og vinden blser kaldt
mens tomheten vokser i mitt sinn forstr jeg at vi begge har forfalt
Nattens blod har dekket meg svnen vil best
Mrke skyer samles ingen kan meg n
Sanden har har rent ut av livets timeglass
Timen har kommet  jeg vil ta din plass <start> I can see dense hazes
which cover me with their clouds
I can see dark clouds
which near inevitable
it is the time to wake up the eclipse
this is the time of inevitable eclipse
sleeping in torpid weakess
chined to the burning lake
it will spin the sky with its shadly breath
this is the time of inevitable eclipse <start> A straight razor and a flick of the wrist
Brass knuckles and a willing fist
A big knife and a little scream
They do wonders for my selfesteem
Warm blood and a cold embrace
The catch is better than the chase
They all ask why I'm doing this
Violence is bliss
What you see
All I know to be
Is a madman out on a killing spree
One thing I say
I did it all my way
Gave rise to the dawn of the dying age
When I feel the urge
And it's tarting to surge
Soon I'm blowing like an atom bomb
When you comprehend
Your life's coming to an end
I'm going going going going gone
Two things that I can't ignore
Dark nights and an unlocked door
I get the feeling and I follow through
I get high like I'm sniffing glue
It's time to let the games commence
This really helps my selfconfidence
Blood orgy for the hedonist
Violence is bliss
What you see
All I know to be
Is a madman out on a killing spree
One thing I say
I did it all my way
Gave rise to the dawn of the dying age
When I feel the urge
And it's tarting to surge
Soon I'm blowing like an atom bomb
When you comprehend
Your life's coming to an end
I'm going going going going gone <start> Instrumental <start> music by Aphazel Lyrics by Grimm
Reveal to me let me see the precious face of yours. In darkness where I'm alone come forth with your wars. You forever my lord. You forever my lord I always deny jesus son of god. Creation never done by god salvations I find in the goat Lucifer brand me with your mark Lord of darkness come out from the dark  Red morningstar watch me attack I shall reveal weak son of god forever the human lies spreading all wrong  all his evil arts evil arts of war Creation never done by god salvations I find in the goat Lucifer brand me with your mark Lord of darkness come out from the dark <start> Torchlight in utter darkness
Starts licking wood with its deadly tongue
In seconds its hunger grows
Wood is eaten by flames twelve feet long
Before the eyes of heathens
The shrine of the cross lights up the glade
On the ground lie six bodies
That have met their fate by pagan blade
Hear the autumn thunder in the sky
Vanishing the mild summer breeze
An autumn thunder roars down on the ground
By its force the foreign god flees
A flash of steel cuts flesh
By doing so it cuts the cross
The mossy ground drinks the blood
Of a hundred men in white clothes
The morning smells of death
But still it feels like a fresh wind
After so many years
Where the forests returned to the pagan kings
Hear the autumn thunder in the sky
Vanishing the mild summer breeze
An autumn thunder roars down on the ground
By its force the foreign god flees
Fullmoon turned to crescent and crescent to fullmoon
Many times over the forests of Hme
The old gods were respected
And new houses rose on the ashes of the cross
All was at peace
When the summer began to turn to autumn
But when the first leaves turned to yellow and brown
People began to see signs...bad omens
One day a hunter from the coast came
And told he had heard rumours
The ships of the foe had been seen in northwest
And their numbers were great
Morning mist chilly was floating up from the sea
At a dawn when leaves were falling down from trees
Gathered were the pagan kings to the circle of stones
Out of silence rose a man known as wise and old
We've all seen the fires
And heard the tale of the hunter
Hear my words when I say
This autumn roars thunder
Passed dusks and dawns two times ten
Fires burning were not on their hills
Again was blood flowing now of heathen men
The foe had returned to burn and kill
Village by village they went
Leaving only crosses and ashes behind
Until pagans were beaten
By their body not their mind
Poured water on their heads
Mumbling words of a foreign tongue
Built houses for their god
Was the pride of these forests forever gone
Hear the autumn thunder fade away
With its echo they lost their pride
Freedom of centuries was lost in days
The autumn thunder in their hearts had died
 <start> Come dark night... deep night
Sweep away the fading embers of the cruel sun
Let me at last dream 'neath the moon's sweet light
For the quest is over and the long day's done...
 <start> Deception is not in your lies
Oblivion is not in my self
A lovely day in bloody cries
The pervert way to my private hell
Just walking on the leathal blade
The snake's on skin but it exites
The step you took the kiss I made
The tunnel of sin. The scare's inside
It's so clear it's so vaguely
You can behold I cannot
Since I blind bird I learn flying
With no reason just as I want
I'll show you dance I'll teach you speak
But I cannot describe the love
My vision's gloom I'm old and sick
In arrogance I rest in dole
Deception is not in your lies
Oblivion is not in my self
A lonely age in frosen rhymes
The only way  don't try to escape <start> Chorus X DMC
The wife the kids the things I did
I'm lookin at my life and how I lived
Is it negative is it positive
Only God knows what it really is
DMC
My wife's mad at me cause I'm drinkin again
Comin home with my breath stinkin again
Got me goin down the drain got me sinkin again
All the alcohol got me thinkin again
If I take my own life that's suicide
I think about the nights I laid down and cried
I think about the brothers who already died
And I took so many drugs now my brain is fried
When I walk through the streets God is my guide
I always try to run but I just can't hide
Won't talk to the preacher cause the preacher lied
I asked for salvation and I was denied
Listen up everybody this is Darryl's song
I'm tryin to figure out what's right and wrong
I'm lookin at the world and do I belong
And like Marvin Gaye said What's Going On
Chorus
DMC
When I'm alone in my room starin at the wall
I hear all the ghosts walkin in the hall
Voices in the head keep talkin to me
What's fantasy what's reality
They say go in the kitchen and grab the knife
Kill the kids kill the wife
Turn it on yourself and take your own life
And I know I know I know that ain't right
But let me tell you somethin it gets deeper than that
I'm lookin for where the Grim Reaper is at
I knocked on his door he said come on in
And by the way you shoulda brought a friend
I said no it's me myself and I
And not too many people want to die
I'm sittin in my living room talkin to Death
Tryin to figure out what I got left
Chorus  
Interlude DMC
Aiyyo man you see that gun over there man
You need to pick it up and use it on yourself
Nahh nahh I ain't ain't gon' do that
Well then you should take it outside and
Y'know you got a bullet with everybody's name on it
Ahh let me think about it man let me just take a walk ah
Yo who dat comin
DMC
When I left the Grim Reaper I ran into Christ
He said DMC you could walk on ice
Remember those times that you never fell
God was holdin you up man couldn't you tell
I kept you cock diesel just like LL
Strong with a Message like Melle Mel
When things was bad you was doin fine
You did a good job of not losin your mind
You even read the bible like a hundred times
The meaning of life is not hard to find
Take a look around look into yourself
You know where to go when you need help
And all those times you thought you was alone
It was you yourself and that microphone
So don't give up keep writin those rhymes
You're makin a way for a better mankind
Chorus
ad lib scratches to end <start> Were the sons of satan
Were descendents from hell
We break the silence
In shadows we dwell
From the land of evil
Born disciples of sin
The fallen savior
The pain within
In matters of the dark
I hear them calling
The sanctury of hell
Will be my fall
We are the creatures of the night
Ready for the fight
Down the river of blood we gather
We are the children of the night
Come stand by our side
Bounded by blood forever
Im the black of holy
Im a sinner of saints
The darkest wishes
The blood that he paints
By the lost horizon
At the end of the line
My soul is rising
I see the sign
In matters of the dark
I hear them calling
The sanctury of hell
Will be my fall
We are the creatures of the night
Ready for the fight
Down the river of blood we gather
We are the children of the night
Come stand by our side
Bounded by blood forever <start> Weary with concealment from the living
Time to break the eternal rejection
To arise from an unhonoured exile
Purposefully leaving the infinite depths behind
The depths of oblivion
The depths of mystery
The depths of obscurity
The depths of eternity
Contaminating the world with death
Ending lives the way dying was supposed to be
Deceased guided into engless obscurity
Depths of eternity terminus of the living dead
Set out for an undead journey
Travelling through desolute domains
A sense of frugality dominates the atmosphere
Chorus
The depths of oblivion better to forget
The depths of mystery complete unawareness
The depths of obscurity infinite darkness
The depths of eternity no escape from death
Chorus <start> Too Bad You Won't Live
But Then Again Who Does
Christ Was Dead But Now He Lives
And They Who Live They Are Dead
It's Not A Good Thing To Live In Fear
Someone Is In Fear Of Living
No One Lives Without Fear
Wake Up It's Time To Die
Weak Is The Strong
Strong Are They Who Weep
Sad Is The Truth
And Laughs Are For Few
Not An Easy Thing
To Meet Your Maker
Everyone Will See Him Face To face
No Escape Beyond His Dominion <start> Music M.Carlsson  Ablaze My Sorrow
Lyrics D.Linden
I can't close my eyes
Staring straight into the empty sky
Feeling trapped an overfilled with lies
I can't deny
These lovely thoughts of death has crossed my mind
I can't deny
Death is on my mind
I can't close my eyes
I'm feeling trapped inside a world of lies
I can't see what's real it's all disguised
I can't deny
These lovely thoughts of death has crossed my mind
I hate this world
I hate this life
I focus on the strength
The strength I'm building up inside
I feel it growing stronger every day
Strong enough to take my life away
I have closed my eyes
My final rest saved me from all those lies
It's over I'm free from this pain called life
I can't deny
I'm dead I'm cold I'm six feet under ground
I can't deny
I'm dead I'm cold it ain't no lie
I focus on the strength
The strength I'm building up inside
I feel it growing stronger every day
Strong enough to take my life away
Suicidal <start> Never to feel nothing too real
The place of doom this empty room
Look inside the brain
The unconscious chain
All the time awaiting
Creatures my soul are taking
Who can break these chains
Only death remains
The inmost fear it's all so near
The evil within stored by sin
The dark side forsaken
Ready to be awakened
In my darkest hour
I can feel the power
Running through my vein
Driving me insane
Where am I to go
Still inside my soul
Reaching out from within
Who can forgive my sin
If I could reach the door
All this pain no more
No more... <start> running fast
but running blind
idle time in a wasting scene
though you've looked
you've never found
peace amongst you unity
for simple reasons you divide
you look without the eyes to see
you lack the bond to truly bind
Jesus Christ the king of kings
so many speeches  empty words
show me...
of what you speak what you dream
unity
I've got substance you've got nothing
show me
something better than my God 
unity
show me unity
punks and skins fighting each other
brother cultures fighting on and on
step into the lgiht of forgiveness
and then by God stand and be strong
if you see a cancer cut it out quickly
separate the wheat from the chalf
do not hesitate if you'd only ask he'd show you the way
you'd see the possibility of peace to be made
fight this is your chance
fight you've got the gift use it
change you know it's true
strength it's there take it
now it's there for you. <start> There is fire in my veins
To return to my home land
Where the twilight dances
Through the skies at night
Hear the call
Through my transient dreams of home wishing for a quick return
As I set out on my way
I'm on my way
Chorus
Roads that I walked are far behind
The things I've seen
the moment spent
To guide me on this journeys end
Moving toward the blinding light
Drowns my soul into unborn life
One day I'll find my way home
All the miles I've walked alone
Silent company I've known
On the wings of the night
My spirit takes to flight
Seeing signs of a day that's yet to come
Never fearing the unknown
As the north wind fills the sails to my home
Chorus
Solo
On my way I'm heading home
To a place I long forgot
But my memories have served me well
With a vision I have seen
Golden roads and silver streams
But reality will cease to be
Chorus <start> I hate humanity and I will not hesitate to kill
There's been this hatred since my birth and I can feel it still
Deep inside my cold heart I am yearning to slay
And hence I know the law I know there's a better way
Only in the darkness only in the antilight
Can there be some silence in my mind
Praying to the darkest angels time and time again
Divided I will see what makes me blind
Light turns black and there's no turning back
From the eternal eclipse
My eyes discover blackened skies
Oh the eternal eclipse
Turns black and there's no turning back
From the eternal eclipse
My eyes discover blackened skies
All crowded places makes me wanna go berserk
But instead I'm killing in the darkness I will lurk
Laying in my bed at night I love the dark I see
Wishing hoping that some day it will last eternally
Mighty forces of the dark of this dream of mine
Await what magic darkness will enshrine
Night comes back and light will turn to black
With the eternal eclipse
I see the mortals' destiny
Oh the eternal eclipse
Comes back and light will turn to black
With the eternal eclipse
I've seen the mortals' destiny <start> Receive a summons from the court
Every day you must report
Sitting in a jury box
Listen to the lawyers talk
Evidence must be presented
While the jury's lives have been preempted
Defendant must make a plea
He just wants to be set free
A duty to the justice system
Trial is the way to covict them
After witness and defendant have voiced
Is when the jury makes it's choice
Barter plea
For all the world to see
Guilty guilty
The jury finds you guilty
Guilty guilty
The jury finds you guilty
The jury must deliberate
A guilty verdict cops appreciate
When evidence proves to incriminate
A sentence the judge will initiate
To find you guilty on all accounts
It must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt
When you break the law you must do your time
And pay the system for your crime
Barter plea
For all the world to see
To see
Guilty guilty
The verdict says your guilty
Guilty guilty
The jury finds you guilty
Guilty guilty
The verdict says your guilty
Guilty guilty
The jury finds you guilty
Barter plea
For all the world to see <start> Myths legends untold stories
Pass by like successive seasons
Mythical oaths forgotten glories
They don't happen without reason
Whispering secrets
Thoughts they seem so common
To me they don't make any sense
Where the essence was undone
Revealed now like celestial winds
About my hope my life my agony and strife
The joy and faults my feelings and thoughts
Whispering secrets exclude that it's just fantasy
Uncommitted to a language is talking without words to me
About my hope my life my agony and strife
The joy and faults my feelings and thoughts
The message is easy to hear
Like the call of a goose
Even the invisible signs
Are like water crystal clear
Whispering secrets <start> Don't believe what you see
Believe in me and my reality
I am a man of God
God can't you give that I am begging you
Don't believe what you hear
Believe in me and I will reappear
Salvation here at last
At last I want you answers all my questions
Is a desert running dry
Deep inside
You refuse to face the facts
But pray for life
Find salvation's in this phrase
We will wait for the day
You began ending a way
Don't believe what you see
Believe in me and my reality
Infinity in me
This is the end all and be our last hope
Is a desert running dry
Deep inside
You refuse to face the facts
But pray for life
Find salvation's in this phrase
We will wait for the day
You began ending a way
Domine Jesu
Demitte nobis debita nostra
Salva nos ab igne inferiore
Perduc in caelum omnes animas
Praesertim eas quae misericordiae tuae maxime indigent
In nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti
Amen
Give me our lie
You and I will devour
Our senses bring us to forget
Children sons and you have seen
And our cross it gives us hope
Is a desert running dry
Deep inside
You refuse to face the facts
But pray for life
Find salvation's in this phrase
We will wait for the day
You began ending a way
And we wait for the day
To discover there is no way
I can't wait and this play
Is the bitter way to wait to end this lie <start> Der Welten Glanz scheint ungetrbt

 Chapter Three 
 Revelation 
naramsu'sha the keeper of the tables
is already an old man but he still seeks the reason for all this.
as he sits by a black lake and listens to the sounds of whales
he decides to go to the queens library
with all the old writings and books to find out the truth.
NARAMSU'SHA
now I know why the reason for all insanity
noohoorsh is damned in my mind is clarity
nshigtur must die she brings only misfortune
sardon has lost the battle for eternity
to be continued... <start> cleanse this fallen angel with open arms
we will not see the same sunset again
i know that this is ending
a life long dream i had
to keep you alive
walking with your hands around my throat
realize that everyone is against you
walking with hands around my throat
in my eyes your so plain
holding your hand
WITH SUCH HIGH HOPES
to one day own your YOUR HEART <start> Ive slit the throats
of clergymen and governors.
Those bloated swine
May their screams unhinge
a thankless crown.
O King See your soldiers
scrape at the algae growing
below the planks
They starve yet still
they quarrel for phantom ore
once owed your throne.
Forgive this ship of fools
said I to the mouths of trees
leaves as hellhound tongues
outstretched to drink the stream.
The beast flung its filth
into the wake
tail coiled
fingers grasping
the remains of our splintered mast.
Once weve razed the land of gold
I will crucify him.
The corpses on my raft
smell of piss and blood
yet they were but men
and all men slaves and kings alike
leave stench as their epitaph.
Not I.
Holy Mother Church of Rome
cleanse this ground I conquer
Rain brimstone upon the judges
who steal from the weary.
Slaughter the Lutherans
and priests who taint your word.
Make Peru the purest land
for I am its prince
and will forever be.
I am its prince
and will forever be.
O King See your isle
burned by my soldiers.
Your vassals and their wives
I hung them all.
Panama will fall.
With my daughter
I forge an empire
to survive us both.
My deeds live on
for I have seen what men
could only dream they saw.

To tell the world the greatest story <start> I'm walking down this way
without an aim without a course
I sometimes find an open door
to rooms that show me trivial thoughts
I see wastelands in Your heads
without ideas without respect
I blame mankind
Your road leads downwards
into sinful life
Down and down the steps You fall
Tears they fall like springing rain
down onto the poisoned earth
Thoughts that love the routine life
push me out of Your door
A tree's my friend just loving me
despite it's wounds bleeding free
And the sun is blind
happy rays are gone
The tree is dead...
I blame mankind <start> Music by BartschNovember 
Poems by BartschOctober 
Ich schnitt ein Stck deines Leibes und frohlockend erblhet mein Kreuz
An welches ich genagelt meistblutend dacht' mich freut's
Und ein Erzengel mir im Alexanderwelt'schen Saale
Gebar mir die Vernunft auf kalter Aufschnittschale
Nun strafend tauch' ich ein in rohes Menschenfleisch Und schwanke nun einher

Und ein Erzengel mir im Alexanderwelt'schen Saale
Gebar mir die Vernunft auf kalter Aufschnittschale <start> where am I lost my way
ask a favor of my faith
break me out of this cage of confusion
break me out of this cage of sin
set me free from this road to death
show me the way of escape you give
are you maker are you king
am I teaching empty things
break me out of this cage of confusion
break me out of this cage of sin
set me free from this road to death
show me the way of escape you give <start> Lost misguided minds feverish dumb
I wonder how your life will end one day
Your soul is caught in a smiling web of sins
You bring the world to it's knees again and again
Speak silence the knife is mine
The knife is mine your emptiness
Devouring life as stars are waning overhead
You celebrate with demons in your home
You put the world to an end that's why I say
Speak silence You're just walking shades
Go away back into your mental cage
Live silence Keep your demons locked
in your mouth and your head go away
Speak silence
There's no cure for your disease
Denn Du bist Mensch and humans never learn
Live silence I pierce my bloody knife
in your mouth and your head in your veins
Speak silence the knife is mine
Speak silence silence
Mine mine this knife is mine
You walk towards the end
Feel the coldness in your veins
Down down now you get down
Your body crumbles
This fiery pulse of sin now stops to beat
This knife is mine the pain is your's
Your broken dreams complete
This knife is mine hurting deep
Again and again I say
The sun has set and I enjoy the void
Without you the silence is so sweet
All living beings are sinking down
The sky is vacant and I smile
Speak silence when I smile
Speak silence in my loneliness <start> Etwas ruft mich...
Ich kann ihm nicht entkommen
Es hat mich auserkoren
Sein Bote dieser Welt zu sein
Etwas kommt...
Ich spre es mit jeder Faser
Die Schatten werden lnger
Bei immer gleichem Kerzenschein
Ich hab' mein Zeitgefhl verloren
Alle Uhren stehen still...
Still...
Etwas wird geboren
Etwas das ich niemals sehen will
Ich hre Stimmen in mir drinnen
Ein Miklang aus der Schattenwelt
Sie schmerzen allen meinen Sinnen
Begleiten mich die ganze Zeit
Die Furcht hlt mich im Klammergriff
Sie steigert sich von Stund' zu Stund'
Vergiftet jeden Teil von mir
Wie lange fand ich keinen Schlaf
Die Angst frit meine Seele
Und zitternd warte ich darauf 
Was bald im Keller leben wird
Die Geburt steht kurz bevor
ANGST WIRD FLEISCH
Es ist erwacht...
Irgendwann war es dort im Keller
Ich hre nur sein Atmen
Das selbst die Stimmen bertnt...
Ein Pesthauch weht durchs ganze Haus
Die Temperatur ist abgesunken
Ich hab' mich mehrfach bergeben
Der Gestank ist grauenvoll
Meine Tr hab' ich verriegelt
 Holz allein kann mich nicht schtzen
Irgendwann wird es mich holen
Was immer es auch sein mag...
Ich warte hier im Dunkeln
In einem Meer aus Krperschwei
Auf den Boten meines Todes
Von dem ich nur den Namen wei...
Phobia...
Die Schatten schreien seinen Namen...
Phobia...
Wurde Fleisch... <start> Lived to live through a lie
Lived and lied to buy some time
Hit the bottom ready to shine
On this tattooed cross we'll die
Alone to question wonder why
Welcome to the bottom of your life
Here before me I can see
Here at the bottom I'll stay
I just couldn't leave here anyway
Black insides a lovely mess
This masked deception I detest
Forgive me father I have sinned
All alone welcome to the bottom again
Your soul hangs upon the line
Existence dares to decline
Here before me I can't see
Here at the bottom I'll stay
I just couldn't leave here anyway
Light becomes my enemy
My home an early grave
And I still won't leave here anyway
Here before me I can't see
Here at the bottom I'll stay
I just couldn't leave here anyway
Light becomes my enemy
My home an early grave
And I still won't leave here anyway <start> Humanity is a nuisance
Some people choose to die
When I come around the corner
There is where you forever lie
Walking with your kids
Their faces now marked with my skids
Accidentally taking your life
No accident this was no accident
What was another sunny day
Suddenly a deathly shade of dark
You and your children now on my grill
Silhouettes on my door show who I kill
Killing pedestrians
Up ahead another one is dead
Untimely deaths this is my specialty
I let God keep the score
The pedal hits the floor
And I still want more
Pieces of glass from my headlight
Stick in your eyes impairing your sight
My auto a human blender
Chunks of viscera splatter my fender
Helplessly awaiting assistance
Rear view shows carnage much further in distance
In reverse I finish the job
Pull forward to reduce your family to globs
Transmission grinds face into pavement
Vertebral folding and organ displacement
Witnesses distraught and disturbed
Your teeth beyond shattered your mandible curbed
Gas tank now fills with your blood
Your mother's sweet baby now part of my hood
Should've watched where you were going
Now you're the chunks I'm blowing
What was another sunny day
Suddenly a deathly shade of dark
You and your family now on my grill
Silhouettes on my door show who I kill
Killing pedestrians
Up ahead a million more are dead <start> Put her on the altar tie her down secure
She will soon die her soul is still pure
Her body is trembling it's filled with fear
She'll lose the life which she holds dear
The dagger is ready to do it's evil deed
On her decayed corpse I will feed
Tie her legs and arms ready to read the rite
Now I feel the force of satan's might
Under baphomet she is bleeding fast
With the corpse indulge in a bloodbath
Pray to the master that this will suffice
Split her skull for this altar sacrifice
Tears on her cheek sweat on her brow
It's time to die I will kill her now
Death has come to deliver her fate
We don't do it for love we do it for hate <start> Her vision is misty as smoke
Mists and the smokes of dark
Desirable fullmoon is near
In air her vison as spark
Fire's tongues is tickle her body
He was waiting all who here and now
Path to eternity
He was waiting all who here and now
Blood on the cold couch
Sweetness of suffering
Excitements of lust
Let's fell
...cold like by needle
Here and forever
Pitiful was called to himself
When gates to the air he closed
Ugly creation insanity myth
You are all here and now
Let stretch out your hands
Your master don't blind you're by light
By light from the heavnes of lies
Your life burns and burnt
The flames of the end
Our flag is still risen
Rising and immortal
Eternal fiery mysticism <start> And yea tho' you walk in the shadow of self
Do not be afraid if you find it in hell
Do not be a slave to just what has been
To make the virtue of demons is the ultimate sin
So fear not my friends for the hour draws near
Better to have lived fast than to die old with fear
Though the old may be wise
No strength to they wield
They envy the young
For by life not death they are killed <start> Out on the street I'm stalking the night
I can hear my heavy breathing
Paid for the kill but it doesn't it seem right
Something there I can't believe in
Voices are calling from inside my head
I can hear them I can hear them
Vanishing memories of things that were said
They can't try to hurt me now
But a shot in the dark one step away from you
A shot in the dark always creeping up on you
Taught by the powers that preach over me
I can hear their empty reason
I wouldn't listen I learnt how to fight
I opened up my mind to treason
But just like the wounded and when it's too late
They'll remember they'll surrender
Never a care for the people who hate
Underestimate me now
But a shot in the dark one step away from you
A shot in the dark always creeping up on you
A shot in the dark not a thing that you can do
But just like the wounded and when it's too late
They'll remember they'll surrender
Never a care for the people who hate
Underestimate me now
But a shot in the dark one step away from you
A shot in the dark always creeping up on you
A shot in the dark not a thing that you can do <start> Machines of madness
Destined to destroy
Inter connections
Body fluids deploy
Sleep deprivation
Consciousness grows cold
Organic stimulation
Empowered codes
It's time to wake up
It's time to receive
It's time for immersion
Transparent species
Subconscious torture
The nightmare begins
Symbolic terror
Demonic sins
Uncensored vision
No one is heard
Bionic mutations
Rule the world
Mutations
Hide below
This damnation
Down to the hole
Collapsing planet
existence is gone
corporate killers
The creature is strong
Mnemonic castration
The process begins
Unknown locations
Lifeforms grow dim
It's under your skin
The nightmare begins
Into your mind
You will go blind <start> I see no stars in the sky
No clouds are passing by
I see no sun nor moon
NecropolisThe city of doom
The sand glows grey and cold
Outside the city where i stand and behold
The bleached bones rises high
NecropolisMade of those who have died
In a shroud i am dressed
As if i laid to my final rest
Twisted souls welcome me
Necropolis My sanctuary
Necropolis Mourns and wails
Necropolis Agony prevails <start> I wont hide behind my fuckign words or my failures.
I dont want you to fucking pray for me
because I've been here a thousand times before.
I never know what the fuck is in store.
and I dont want you to fucking pray for me.
I wont hide behind my fucking words.
Some believe that everything in life comes for free.
I will work until I bleed because anything doesnt come for free.
I've been here a thousand times.
I never know what the fuck is in store.
I dont want you to fucking pray for me.
and your days your fucking days wont come.
when everythings the same.
you say that things will change.
things wont change i will never hide behind my words.
things wont change and i will never turn my back on my friends.
Things wont change. <start> Cerre los ojos por un instante
why te veo a ti
imagenes que no se han borrado
de un pasado feliz
Sueos que nunca llegaran
a hacerse realidad
tu nombre escrito en una pared
con el viento hablara
Que hay amigo
al otro lado del silencio
Canciones que recuerdan lugares
suenan para ti
palabras que nunca he olvidado
why me hacen sentir
Sueos que nunca llegaran
a hacerse realidad
tu nombre escrito en una pared
con el viento hablara
Que hay amigo
al otro lado del silencio <start> So fed up with this shit
The shattered mirror can't look back at itself
Your self Indulgence
And your lack of respect
So paranoid
It makes everyone a victim
We won't forgive you
Don't tell me
That you are sorry
It's not worth it
How can we waste all our time
Never a moment for ourselves to reflect
Humiliation fueled by years of regret
Ashamed awkward and embarrassed the same
This point of view is formed by paranoid minds
Misunderstanding how to prove your words right
I can t escape this place
The walls around me fall <start> Official lyrics from the programme of the theatrical production of I Am Curious Orange from the Kings Theatre in Edinburgh contributed by Fiona Armstrong.

they freed the blacks too

They invented birth control

You'll never guess who called
It was Craig Steele.
It's stool pigeons da da da da
Guest informant guest informant
Guest informant guest informant
I called the colonel to the cheap hotel
I attacked the bed
I wired the phones as well
Colonel Boggs McRoley waltzes Michelle.
And I count it all I have not counted on
Guest Informant guest informant
I've been split on I've been tattled on
I had not counted on Guest Informant
And the morning Scotch of another Sunday over
A miserable Scottish hotel
Resembled a Genesis or Marillion  LP cover
All the hotel staff had been dismissed
It was me the Hoover
And the O. A. P. asked Could he turn killer
Caught could I kill him
Bonded
Or is he itinerant
But I guess he's just a pug analyst
Guest informant guest informant
BaghdadSpace CogAnalyst.
I could not comprehend I could not understand
Who had not counted on I had not counted all

I've been split by a firstrate moron
And I have been counted on I'm not counted on

I've been let down by a firstrate moron
And I could not comprehend who I'd counted on

 This line a topic of much contention is as according to Sean
Russell who wrote on  Feb.  I wrote to Cog Sinister with a
pile of
questions one of them being what the hell Brix was saying in Guest
Informant. Lucy Rimmer wrote back and said she asked Brix who said
the phrase was BaghdadSpace CogAnalyst. <start> Darling baby
Don't say maybe
Disobey me I'll be
Like a bad penny
I twist the truth
I love your youth
You're losing grip
Take a trip you
You're going down
Going down
You're going down
Like fallen angels
I will mesmerize
You will paralyze
Framed in your game
Slowly fading
No one knowing
We are through
Count your blessings
Count to eighteen
Souls to perish
For a few stolen dreams only
As we've walked down the alley
On the misty afternoon
No one looked back nor forward
The city walls felt distant
Never at our reach
We're sentenced to your world
You're going down
You're going down
With me
You're going down with me
I will mesmerism
You will paralyze
Like fallen angels <start> I used to take a second for a pray
I used to sleep on a freezing bed of stone.
Chages twist your life
Changes twist your mind.
Time has come again
time to be alone.
What I belived
now is a ready gone already gone
are lonely tears dancing inside a storm.
I'm crying resting on myself
I'm dying shifting life to death
I'm falling down from the height
I'm dreaming from heaven to hell. <start> tortured by the agaony of selfleceration  full of pain
and fear  my sense of selfpreservation keeps me
alive  the whole way of life paved by affliction
and danger  more  more I recognize the cruelty
of reality  reality the greatest plot of life
one walks  talks  sees  breathes  but doesn'T
live  no  rather serve the growing edifice
that controlsour so  called life  death gives
way to the living  straight into freedom
way out of this edefice
everyone a brick in this stonework
and day by day more people live in it
hour by hour yheir power rises
and inevitably steals our breath <start> One last time
We're back again you know we're not fucking around
Got a bottle of jack in our hands
You tryna' keep up kid
Let's see who hits the ground
We've drank the drinks
We've done the drugs
Clearly we don't remember
We've come so far
We've shown them all
Without us you'd fall and fade away
They say it all breaks down to keeping your feet on the ground
My sole intention is keeping my head in the clouds
They say that I can't last a day in the real world
I say you wouldn't survive one night in mine
Notorious and shit I wouldn't trade it for the world
I'm infamous but damn you can't help but love this shit
Notorious and shit I wouldn't trade it for the world
I'm infamous but damn you can't help but love this shit
You can't help but love this shit
I'm everything we need to make this scene what it should have been
Remember platinum albums sold out stadiums leave it to me
Let's tell the truth not to be rude but we're all irrelevant
This music's dead with a bullet in its head
Let's wake it up
Whoa
Whoa
It's so insane I'm so insane
Going insane I'm so insane
Leave it to me from here
Leave it to me from here <start> Shamaatae

Carbon beings in process leading to life that we have today
A billion years later technology springs
Exploding progress pushes is forward
But exploring progress is tearing us down
What is fiction is fact
There is no blame for conditioning
Reality's created by ourselves
We're to blame for our problems
Cells of our shells merge with the earth
Becoming separately involved composting transgressing
In order to embrace life and death we must eliminate
The boundaries that lie between the physical and the spiritual
Symbiosis a two way process
People read their lives and then create their psychosis
Staying conscious requires effort
Evolution reawakes the primal subconscious
Aware awake alert
Know or felt by ones inner being
Flow and slower observer and observed
A wave infinite ocean
Life and death in cyclic motion
You're a human being
You have an ego and mind
It's a useful part of you but it's not you
Flow and slower observer and observed
A wave infinite ocean
Life and death in cyclic motion
You're a human being
You have an ego and mind
It's a useful part of you but it's not you <start> Drool dripping out my tongue
Hanging south saliva flowing free
My eyes full of lust my balls
Gonna bust give yourself to me
Thirst I can't quench come here you wench
There's something that I need
Carnivore
I'm a meat eater
Carnivore
I'd like to meet ya
Carnivore
I know I'll reach ya
The hunger I feel makes you a meal
Oh girl you sure taste sweet
By my hair pull me there guide me to your treat
Spread your legs I'll seed your eggs oh feel me deep
Lick me she begged she pulled
Down my head I love to eat pussy
A taste so fine like sweet April wine
I won't trade for any money
Did you cum I eat and run I live for sodomy <start> Music Holmlid  Magnusson Kvist Lyrics Magnusson Heidgert
Now that i've lost my beloved brother i took his advice
I've searched for the one he claimed to be my true father...the king of kings
The fearsome lord of the mithril mountain the king of dragons
It was a warm yet expected welcome i spent many a night there
And found out a great deal of my past and i was told that there's still a
chance to
save our kingdom and world
The leader of the dark hordes the dweller of night the
destructor of light he must be destroyed in order to scatter the hordes
...he also told me that it is my real brother...
It will be done...i will find you bastard son
I've wandered for months searching
Time grows short i need an answer
Now i know your name
I have come to cleanse this world
And to rid it all from evil
It has to be done
Now i know the name of the one the bastard son
It's so clear Still so much has to be done
I will find you wherever you are
There's nowhere to hide
The power of light guides me right
You sold your soul to learn the secrets of the night
Rejected and cold
May in sickness you dwell
Father tell me what i'm to do
They have burned my home
All i love has died
Follow the path of death so much pain all in vain
The road's long and hard destruction's a horrible sight
I will find you...
Solo N.M
The dark side ravages and plunders still
I must hurry and find an answer soon
Solo E.H
I will find you... <start> All of his life he has dreamt of this moment
Through all the blood and the work and the sweat
Focused or blinkered just so single minded
nothing could stop him when his course was set
To conquer each fear and to push every boundary
Never accepting the limits they set
What doesn't kill you can make you feel stronger
What makes you stronger gets you through each test
Oh god speed to you
He looks to heaven and feels it surround him
Unknown unknowable foreverness
What lies at the end of this historic journey
No one can know you just take your best guess
Each thing he faces just seems so uncertain
He is strapped in for the ride of his life
Life in the hands of a hundred computers
 million horsepower rocket to ride
Oh God speed to you <start> Coming from the streets
Fists up in the air
Generating heat
They come from everywhere
Hail
Fists are made of iron
Bodies made of steel
Dancing on the razor
Metal is the deal
Hail
We came to feel the thunder
The lightning and the heat
We came to hail the metal gods
Banging to the beat singing
Hail to the metal hail
Singing Hail heavy metal
Hail
The power in the music
Arising in us all
We're never gonna lose it
We're proud and standing tall
Hail I said Hail
If you just cannot feel it
You'll never understand
There's nothing's gonna beat it
Metal rules the land
Hail
We come to feel the thunder
The lightning and the heat
We came to hail the metal gods
Banging to the beat singing
Hail to the metal hail
Singing Hail heavy metal
Hail hail
Hail heavy metal hail
Hail heavy metal hail
Hail heavy metal hail
Hail to the metal
Heavy metal hail
Hail to the metal
Heavy metal all hail
Hail to the metal
Heavy metal all hail
Hail to the metal
Heavy metal all hail
Hail to the metal
Heavy metal all hail <start> Burning... A nauseating taste
Pointles... Your life is such a waste
Bouncing and battering the beast in my skin
Aggression has come to grow
Forcing my feelings to step out of me
Relentless to the bone
Vengence dwells inside
Fearless I feast on your life
Screaming... My body connect with pain
Outrageous... In havoc I shall remain
Raping the cradle a life filled with sin
Forces below I adore
Your soul might be clean but this game you can't win
I'm back into the core
Vengence dwells inside
Fearless I feast on your life <start> Der stechende Geruch von Ammoniak schwngert die Luft
Gepaart mit den Ausdnstungen der Schweine
Ihre hungrigen Schreie durchschneiden die Stille
Heut Nacht werden wir ein neues Futter bereiten
Der mchtige Stahltrichter der Futtermhle
Silbriges Mondlicht spiegelt sich in blankem Chrom...
Und alles im Inneren wird kleingehackt
Zu Futter fr die Schweine
Heut Nacht werden wir ein neues Rezept probieren
Zutaten dafr hab ich am Bahnhof mir besorgt
Zwei willige Nutten kann man schnell berzeugen
Sie wuten ja nicht welches Schicksal ihnen blht
Doch Chloroform wirkt rasch und unkompliziert
Ich drcke den Schalter und das Mahlwerk beginnt zu laufen
Das kalte metallische Gerusch zweier Stahlrotoren...
Im Sack neben mir steckt eine der Huren
Der Kleidung entledigt zum Schlachten bereit...
Mit ihr auf der Schulter steig ich die Leiter empor
Ein Blick in den Trichter ist Vorfreude pur
Mit den Fen zuerst rutscht sie tief hinab
Und dann beginnt ihr letzter Tanz...
Die Rotoren beginnen ihren Krper zu zertrennen
Der wahnsinnige Schmerz fhrt ihr Bewutsein zurck
Kalter Chrom bricht ihre Schreie zur Kakaphonie
Dann verstummt das Fleisch...
Nur das Mahlwerk tut weiterhin seine Pflicht
Schumendes Blut spritzt in mein Gesicht als feine Gischt
Lngst sind die Rotoren beim Oberkrper angelangt
Im Fleisch und Knochenbrei zittert der nackte Leib
Bis nur noch nahrhaftes Fressen brigbleibt...
So erfllt ihr Leben noch einen guten Zweck
Als Futter fr die Schweine
Wenigstens ihr toter Leib hat seinen Wert
Als Futter fr die Schweine
Eine Hure noch ist brig in dieser Nacht
Als Futter fr die Schweine
Das Schmatzen der Tiere am nchsten Morgen
Klingt zutiefst befriedigt ob des neuen Hausrezepts...
Futter fr die Schweine... <start> Well here go my big plans
To build up this fortress into the clouds
It's made up of my love and my heart
And my blood we'll make it out
With the weight of the world here I stand
With the weight of the world here I stand
With the weight of the world here I stand
With the weight of the world oh
And this is all I've got I'll make it now or not
It's made up of my love
And I've fought so hard to fake our lives are meant to make
It's made up of my love made up of my love
That's how it goes it goes
Well here goes my big plans
To build up this fortress into the clouds
It's made up of my love
And my heart and my blood we'll make it out
I won't fall down my heart still pounds
I'm breathing now I won't fall down
I won't fall down my heart still pounds
I'm breathing now I won't fall down
I won't fall down my heart still pounds
I'm breathing now I won't fall down
I won't fall down my heart still pounds
I'm breathing now I won't fall down
Well here go my big plans
To build up this fortress into the clouds
It's made up of my love
And my blood and my heart we'll make it out
We'll make it out we'll make it out
We'll make it out we'll make it out
We'll make it our love out
You're not the only one <start> Let's look back back to the moment when I followed sin with every step and every breath
I wanted what I couldn't have it was never enough
Forgotten innocence just a shadow of who I was meant to become.
Is this who I was meant to be
Why can't I save me
In pursuit of flesh I was rotting in my own
A broken soul searching for home
Alone and forsaken
Take me back to the days when I was young
Take me back to the days when I could feel anything
Take me back to the days when I was young
Take me back to the days take me back to the days when I was not afraid to die
Each and every star will fade but every night brings a new day
I can't see what's in front of me oh help me find my way
Seeing all the right and wrong hoping that I will stay strong
The fire in the sky will light my way back home
What are we afraid of The past is gone leave it behind
What are we afraid of Resurrect the man who died inside
Words can't bring back the way that we used to be
We need guidance
We need action
When the road ahead looks bleak and the scars on our hearts have slowed our breathing
Don't let the darkness define you step out from the shadows
Don't let the darkness define you you are not alone
Don't let the darkness define you you will find your home <start> It was in tragedy of reflection that is oh purest of nights was to drink incessantly from these veins. Beauty in comparison to no other. A standard made in flesh will in sickening glory run feverishly upon the razor's edge. Admiration this night shall end. How she loathes the sight of herself. And with every frantic thrust her pallid supple veins  have quivered at their very sight. What once was desired is now a mere sickening depiction a face so macabre. Convulsions induced by vomiting. No more a seductress no less a queen. In detest of her mere reflection her youthful complexion once adorned. The paths carved through arterial fabrication at the hands of herself. You disgust me she cries with hoarseness in her throat. The razor its soliloquy silences all how beautiful its merciless sway. Her eyes they close for one last time. All impurities unwashed in this filth and dishonor. <start> Go
This ain't a test fuck the rest
Time to set the record straight
Talk your shit behind my back
Let's hear you say it to my face
I've heard the words fall out your lips
You little trendy fucking bitch
The time has come to get you some
Cause I just do not give a shit
Do you take me for a fool
How's it feel to be a tool
See to me your just a cancer
Motherfucker war is the answer
As of now the end begins
I want to laugh but there's no joke
To eat with beasts
And run with the wolves
On the ashes you must choke
I know it's got to chap your ass
To think I just won't go away
Effects me not I'm writing you off
I've got nothing more to say
Do you take me for a fool
How's it feel to be a tool
See to me your just a cancer
Motherfucker war is the answer
Get some
You want to disrespect me
you little fucking punk
Everything I've done
To be who I am
As far as I've fucking come
I'll slap you so fucking hard
It'll feel like you kissed a freight train
Fuck you
Do you take me for a fool
How's it feel to be a tool
Talk your shit behind my back

If I had it my way every wack MC would die Friday
Makin Saturday a better day
Sunday wouldn't start your week off til Monday
One day tunes I wrote yesterday will be tomorrow's scriptures for today
At high noon Boom Skwad Gods with knowledge
Holler at apostles who squalor in despair despisin those who follow
Swallowin pride like St. Ide's while you stare... take a drink
Don't think in a eyeblink I won't start my hijinks
and hijack a flight Yeah right when
Tomorrow night cause off the record with the treble and the bass
I chase my lyrics through the rap race
Last place is simply not an option in my case
Waste not want not because I front not
The Notty keeps his lyrical shotty cocked
and locked up at your temple over instrumentals
 you No.  like the pencil
The Boom Skwadron Godson who got the Bop Gun
The top gun from the jump like Datsun
I got one candycoated rote rhymes skits I shit on when I get on
Then flip the scripts like I had Zips on
It's on like electrical my symmetrical
alphabetic keeps my competition ridin on my testicles

You to the rescue let me test you
Who the best crew most definite
has to be the Skwad cause I'm the President
All you misrepresenters with your twelve inches need pinches
Wake the fuck up and check out what this is

I can't see nuttin but victories
MC's think they can get to me then bring it
Cause once I pass the blunt to my Lieutenant then we in it
For the infinite no play play
The notty headed Newark nigga from NJ and the Sensai
represent fully playin bullies out for yappin
Thinkin you'll be rappin get tapped and say you scrappin
While I been waitin hatin fake MC's that make they bacon
with passion rippin up they stickers for reaction
Practicin on rap hasbeens I'm down with the Biz like Backspin
Dissin Mikes like the Jacksons
Thick like the lips on that Fugee chick
Hard like the dicks in booty flicks
Dissin niggaz like a snooty bitch 
I only pop a coochie if it smells Gucci
Get the lucci hit it for months and then smoke blunts with the hoochies

You know the flavor like blue cheese
on how I make crews bleed and school MC's who try to do me

Do me baby do me baby

bom ba zi it ain't over motherfuckers

Time to turn platinum to purple chrome
Green purple yellow red white chrome <start> There are whispers one that let me in on the upcoming I watched and listened ready to take hold the sight to take over the whole damn night
I stay buried from the loss that killed me across
Never go away hold her tightly and I love harder than I can
Only one way down
The voices are calling me outside in
They hold the misery from breaking in...
With hours left and the light at the end is dimmer than I watched and listened leaving without losing tonight her breath on skin by candlelight
I'll take the loss from my face and leave grace in it's trace
Never go away hold her tightly
And I love harder than I can...only one way out
The voices are calling me outside in
They hold the misery from breaking in
And one day after the rain the loss sinks in
The photographs are alone to uphold withstand
One day after the rain when the loss sinks in
The photographs are alone to uphold and withstand
Only one day after the rain...capsized in the sea of your scent
Only one day after the rain...when abandonment is my closest friend
The voices are calling me outside in
They hold the misery from breaking in
And one day after the rain the loss sinks in
The photographs are alone to withstand <start> I close my eyes and hope that this is just another dream
Reality can't really be as bad as it seems
I hope for something better but I'm waiting for the worst
And when I open up my eyes I see the bubble burst
All my dreams are broken as the world is torn apart
Was it really meant to be this way right from the start
If this is all we live for then I wish that I was dead
Just so I could stop these thoughts from going through my head
I close my eyes
I close my eyes
I close my eyes
I close my eyes
I close my eyes again and wish that everything was fine
Even though I know that I'm just wasting precious time
I'm loosing my direction life is driving me insane
The more things keep on changing the more they stay the same
So please somebody catch me before I hit the ground
I just can't understand what makes this crazy world go round
The more I look around me the less I seem to know
If this is all there is then I don't know where I can go
I close my eyes
I close my eyes
I close my eyes
I close my eyes
I close my eyes and wish that I could turn back time
I close my eyes and wish that I could press rewind
I close my eyes and wish that I could change my mind
I close my eyes and wish that everything was fine
I close my eyes one final time to make my vision clear
The more I try the more my vision seem to disappear
The world keeps turning around as I turn my inside out
I'm doing all I can to understand what life's about
But everywhere I seem to look the answer isn't there
Nobody's asking questions 'cause' nobody seems to care
There has to be some sort of meaning and a reason to exist
If this is all there is there must be something that I missed
I close my eyes
I close my eyes
I close my eyes
I close my eyes
I close my eyes and wish that I could turn back time
I close my eyes and wish that I could press rewind
I close my eyes and wish that I could change my mind
I close my eyes and wish that everything was fine <start> The light I see is none...
It doesn't shine doesn't murder the dark
Was not created by the white one
Not existing for your undimensional eyes
The black I see in none...
Not a shattering but a creating one
A spectrum of unreal colours
And a thrust for your numb existence
You are alive I am not
You are dead I'll never be
My face is an earthly mask I never asked for
So I'll leave it behind and will never return
Longing for worlds which my astral mind has seen
Here I stand flesh and blood
Laughing and crying betraying the earth
But have you really even thought this shell is me 
As your reality crashes into the void
I sit beside Satan and watch you die <start> Consumed with memories that preceded today
Given a chance to bereave life that's slipping away
Suffered through tragedy of my slow decay
Deceptive tendencies dragged my soul away
All that I know is there was no God for me
Force that shatters all absence of mortality
Revive all my fears
Revive wasted tears
Revive void within
Revive once again
Forsaken by destiny forsaken by my own mind
I must remove my skin to see belief in your eyes
All that I know is there was no God for me
Force that shatters all absence of humanity
Revive all my fears
Revive wasted tears
Revive void within
Revive once again

Touch the sky
Revive a hope

Humanity that once existed
Punished for sins of mankind
Disturbing elements that natured
Choking on man's corruption
Deliver us from our oppressor
Embraced are thoughts of sanctuary
Build destroy disease infection
Diminishing ozone layer ultravioletrays
Soil erosion fluctuation of the tides
Dying species rapidly becoming extinct
Eradicating forests
Our serenity has been invaded
We take from ourselves and give back
Nothing
Another cure another disease
Another war in which many will die
Impossible to comprehend
The horror lurks upon our walking life
It returns to haunt us in our dreams
Like embedded fossils inland in stone
Envolving from our primitive form
We must deffat this cruelty
One must view death to understand reality
Living within an age of intelligence
Nourish the earth and we shall receive

From thirty thousand feet the  group in clear sky
Beholds the city laid out like a carpet drown below
Still the fires from last nights attack among the rubble glows
Black puffs the antiaircraft guns has come alive
As the mighty eight approaches high up in the sky
Death from above
From the bellies of the flying fortresses in olive drab
Hells fire pouring down upon the earth
Incendiary high explosives falling through the sky
To detonate at ground level to enflame to kill to burn
Bombs away heading west  group returns to base
All land below engulfed in smoke the city is ablaze
Death from above
Again at night the roar of engines in the dark above
The merlin rumble now  sqadron has arrived
With bellies full of daeth and bomb doors open wide
To destroy what  group may have left behind
The pathfinders unloads a color full veil glow so bright
And the rubble city down below burn throughout the night

I looked behind my back and there he was
His screaming eyes could not be so bright
He was not stranger looking than you or me
With different thoughts and that wasn't right
This is the story of the world
Where actors come and actors go
You are not trusted till you know
And even then you are alone
Sometimes a man is judged by the way he thinks
And this is why the world is not one
... but can not see
Taking no excuse because there's none
Our world is in the hands of fools
So many others besides you
They seldom give but always take
There's only so much you can do
I used to ... of do it Jack
Everything that it can not see
And no one wants to stand uW and say they're wrong
So private's right before honesty
This is the story of the world
Where hide and seek's a way of life
Hide from everything that's real
And seek what others say is right <start> Sometimes I wonder why
They never could could let me die
Your body is my resting place now
Can't move or speak like before
I'm limited inside your thoughts
And only by your sight I can be sure I exist
Darkness when you dream at night
Pain you never know what it is like
Hate in envy you lost yourself
Inside you I'm your mirror image
Inside you I can feel your anger
It's just like hell but only colder
Inside you united with your dark mind
Through your eyes of eager
See you end so many lifes
I wonder why you keep going on
Inside your head I'm your greatest triumph
It's a joy for you knowing that I'm the watcher
Trying to make me like you <start> akustisch <start> Examples of barbarism miss what you mock

Before all good and bad on earth start its turn
Sun rises first
No one asks for it
It shines for all
To give someone
To give something
The feeling to be a part of the day
Clouds change their faces and all good and bad does the same
So many things stir you up and will never be understood
The world is crying
But my virtuoso vision of life inside my heart
Wakes my hope to be a part of this wonderful day

I burn it down
Just to watch it go
I burn it down
So everybody knows
I burn it down
Just to see it torched
I burn it down
I hate it to the core
Think you're a martyr
Not hard to see
You wanna rule the fuckin' world
You gotta get through me
Your iron fist will be broken
No soul to sell
You think I'll burn for my actions
See you in hell
Burn it down
I do it for myself
I burn it down

Lyrics HertrichWinkler
And I seek sweet favours carved in gold
And I bare the light my breath to hold
Early seen unknown but known too late
How came this gentle concord
can You tell me was it fate 
I cross the entrance push the door
to crawling sadness hurting more
I see I hear the trembling sphere
Come and pass alas stay here 
And I breathed such vows love used to swear
It's too rich for use for earth too dear
Now sadness is beloved and love we gain
I see me I see You and all I know is
hurt is lying plain
I pity silence sad
I enjoyed the vital light
O that she knew knew I did...
God alone in grievance lies
I thank You for Your cries
I leave You now leave You now...
When I feel my insane blue
I dive into the see for You
and hope to drown by falling down
Weapons out to pierce my grief
I hide my blade alike in peace
Drop the curtain I will leave
I don't care I don't go
I don't leave You when You will
I don't care I don't go
when You cease my love to kill
Burning ice and wondrous flaming snow
And I see more devils hell can hold
I will leave the break of day
No more passion no more lust
and only fume of sigh will stay <start> Music Martin  Andreas
Lyrics Martin
Cry of torture
Victim of pain
Darkness and evil
smash your head
Far beyond
children scream
Hear their voices
in your dream
Lord of power
rip your soul
Slaves of torment
cut your bones
Destroy your hopes
Cruch your mind
Take your dreams
and die with them
Destroy your...
Death comes ripping and takes you away
In your own dreams you feel the pain
Night of the unborn is here to stay
Beg for freedom on your last day
Death comes ripping... <start> Songs to sing
Song of Turtle
And the Cry of the Bear
Awake
I can sense it
Still I'm afraid
Tower Road lies ahead
Commalacomeka
Ka has come to me
Grey old fellow
If you finally failed the test
What would it mean
We're getting near
We're getting near
Maid of sorrow
Your time goes by
Fade away
Fade
Say thank ya for the beams are safe my friend
Long days and pleasant nights for you
Save me
The final chord
Don't let it end like this
No not like this
Tell me
When things were finally getting out of hand
It's out of hand
Entangled I am captured
You have put a spell on me
The last in line
The Gunslinger's line
The sacrifice of innocence
This work needs to be done
Now blow the horn
Hail to the gun
Done is done
Yes there will be no taking back
Every journey must come to an end
All hail to the Gunslinger
Praise to the Dinh and the King
Beyond our reach out of control
Save me
To touch the rose it will not bring release
No taking back
Come save me
There are other worlds
But surely none like this
The world has changed
Done is done
Yes there will be no taking back
The word is the law
Law is Ka
The end of the road lies
Straight ahead it lies
I'm feeling pure
The end of the road lies
The sacrifice of innocence
The hailing of the gun
My way was death and madness
Now let the tower come
Done is done
Yes there will be no taking back
And every journey must come to an end
All hail to the Gunslinger
Praise to the Dinh and the King
Beyond our reach out of control <start> Bad dog no biscuit
Bad cop no donut

Bad wheel no spin
Bad cramps no bog
Bad master bad dog

Laws to defy
Live to win
Born to die <start> You know I check for you now
Nothing I would'n do now
Ain't no other girl could yurn my head
For the first time I clocked you
I knew I had to have you
Ain't no other girl gonna share my bed
Other girls may come and go
You're the one I've wanted to know
Give it give it give it to me
CHORUS
I check for you can I flex with you
I check for you can I flex with you
Wanna be with you wanna flex with you all night
Check baby check baby let me know what's going on
I wanna flex with you girl
Something I gotta do girl
And no other girl come even close
I try to keep my cool now
But I could be a fool now
'cause your kind of love I need the most
I just gotta knock your boots
I can bow and I can shoot
Give it give it give it give it to me
CHORUS
Check baby check baby do you wanna flex x  <start> Why did I leave
Lost fooled confused
Crawling in the mud with pigs
Starved to death
Discouragement strangling me
I have no breath
Full of sorrow and despair
The father lets his son away
Challenging the world without fear
Unknown of the evil atmosphere
Imperfect man imprudent mind
Disobedient to the call of God
Exhaustion becomes predominant
Hell on earth is where I am
I'm longing back to a life in peace
With abundance of food and plenty of water
I will return to my Father's house
And tell him I'm worthless as his son
Father please forgive me
For I have sinned against you
Regretting man independent mind
Attraction to the call of god
With open arms the Father
Welcomes his son back
He was dead and now became alive
He was lost and now has been found Incomprehensible
Spiritual satisfaction
Inner peace comes from the Father
Spiritual satisfaction
Inner peace comes from the Father <start> I see the light out of you
I see the day coming in
When I know it is true
I ain't walkin' away
How many times can I be
The face within your dream
I don't care what I see
I'll be there if you scream
I swear you lost your life
It comes disguised as blue rays
The way you stare out at me
Makes my heartbeat decrease
I'm stuck in something
I'll never be free
I can't move someone
Please help me
I drove a million miles
All the rooms were gray
I don't want to be nice
I think it's clever to swear
I wouldn't seek your advice
But I would look
I told you not to be so cute
Around the block
What can I do
But be impressed against the clock
I'm stuck in something
I'll never be free
I can't move someone
Please help me
I see the light out of you
I see the day coming in
When I know it is true
I ain't walkin' away
How many times can I be
The face within your dream
I told you not to be so cute
Around the block
What can I do
But be impressed against the clock <start> Chorus
Meine pussy ist rasiert und das macht die manner gonz verruckt
So habe ich immer massenhaft Schwanze fur mein Fideloch
Schwanze die sich in mich bohren
Die mit krafigen kolbenstoBen meine Mose bearbeiten
Ein Schwanz in mein Loch zu spuren is herrlich
Aber noch besser ist es gleichzeitig einen zweiten zum
Schlecken zu haben
Wenn ich zwei Schwanze habe gonz fur mich allein
Werde ich besonders geil
Und mein Mund wird zu einer zweiten Mose
Repeat chorus x
Zwei Manner auf einmal
Das ist eine geantie
Fur eine ganze Reihe von Orgasmen
Wenn der eine Schwanz seiner Honig versprits hat
Sorge ich mit meinem Mund dafur daBer wieder steht
Wahrend sich der andere Knuppel in mein Fick loch bohrt

Knockin bums out for clout Jersey rules without a doubt
On the real keep it kinda fat for the brothers
from the Wrongside of Da Tracks and it goes like that
Since the beginnin of time the Artifacts kick rhymes

Snatch up a G and demonstrate for the night

Yo this flow goes to all the hoes I ever fucked with
Kids I smoked blunts with and my exgirl that sucks dick
Niggaz takin shorts in weed spots because they know me
And to my moms because she makes good cheese and macaroni
And to the stores that'll sell three Phillies for a dollar
To Afrika Bambaata for makin me a rap scholar
And MC El for rhymin with this notty headed lunatic
You always knew we had the crew that had the mad drama kid
peep it all my peeps from  Block to Broad Street
And backstreets in Jersey where the niggaz first heard me
It took a long time comin with more cuts than Jason
Since the days I had a fade and used to rock in Redman's basement
I do Poetic Justice like Janet played the role
And now I'm makin suckers swoll with the dynamite soul
Dynamite soul

And if you're swoll say it's all in control
The Artifacts we got the dynamite soul
Dynamite soul  <start> Breaking through the dead of night
There's a place we've got to find it
Nothing will stop us on our way
Watch your back at every moment
They will take you down and control
Lurking through the fog to find a way
Descend on early morning
Now burning bright
A sudden turn to nightmares
Squeezing the empty moment
Now out of sight
With innocence we take flight
They do their best to tease you
They'll never try to please you
Be careful of what you do now
Search and find deprived of your will
Not confined the matters fulfill
Make a strike and be the first to kill
Descend on early morning
Now burning bright
A sudden turn to nightmares
Squeezing the empty moment
Now out of sight
With innocence we take flight
Rock the waves and shake their brains
Let's burn it to the ground
Take the place and redisgrace
And show 'em what we found
Turn the crowd and take their pride
This is our own home now
Take the reins and touch the chains
Forever they are bound
Take the stage and steal the rage
When hell is all around
Break the rage rite in the faces
Never turn around
Soon there'll be nowhere to hide
We occupy inside
Break the waves and ride the plains
Forever we are now one more way
On her wings she tried to flee
But they don't want to fly
She's trapped in time
On her knees she can't believe
What's going on inside
She's lost her mind
Never thought I'd go this way
But always did the crime
We crossed the line
Never saw the hidden scripture written in the lies
No last goodbye <start> Better to reign in hell
Heart in hand passed to the clasp of pain
In a dark lowland that set bad blood in veins
Burning like penal fires roused to strain
The jaggedtoothed skyline braced with crosses
The golden dawn
Lay lost to mist where
Emboldened thorns
Made their bed with toppled stones
He closed his eyes
Sunken to dream there of crowblack skies
And a great white empty throne
Horror stalked the bilious fogs that balked his visions
He licked the spittle from the cheeks of the wry
And drifted back to when his stung its target
The sneer of Michael on a glorious high
Of angel dust and virtue by his side
Better to reign in hell
Drowning in the past
That downfall seemed like yesterday
Though blurred moons passed
As enemies in high places laughed
Moved to mirrors cracked with heavy lines
He rose snow blind through shifting sands of time
Erased the trace and taste of bitter wines
The grapes of wrath grew fat on the vine
She came to him
A little whip of tantrums
Thrashed on velvet skins
That lines her wishbone henge
Her name was sin a warming spurt of mantras
Splashed on occult tongues that whispered sweet revenge
For the shame of their crawl from grace
Cold and hollow as the grave
And for a rape and ruinous scourge
Spared for souls that shared God's worship
For now their throats coated notes with dirge
That poured from parapets to the pits below
Better to reign in hell
Drowning in the past
A wretched scream like yesterday
Died at last with the rising of the revenant dark
All sharpened claws and blunt discharge
I shall bow no more to the dogs of the Lord
Tearing at my carcass heart
I shall fall to my knees only at the keyholes
Of virtue slipping into bondage masks
Freewill made me better to reign in hell
And with new wings unfurled and spoken
He took to things that would desecrate the world
The seduction of both woman and man
For a bastard master plan
Better to reign in hell
Drowning out the past
Fool fates unwound cruel yesterdays
Beneath the stars
That staggered from the blast <start> Surrounded by quietness and silence
you look into the face of that creature which once gave delight.
It seems to you unreal and slowly blurring inside the mirror of life.
You spoke and wanted to be silent.
You loved but deceived yourself.
Caught in a thousand illusions your escape was plainer than facing reality.
Your face disintegrates in the glaring fire truth casts on you.
Your own picture is impressed with doubts.
The faith in yourself resembles a battle that seems lost.
You destroyed what arose over years.
You sold your soul your heart your reason.
What once filled you with unspeakable pride you did forsake.
Out of deepest night
that covered you
days of perception have broken.
Your mask has fallen
down to dust
your secrets have been spoken.
Fearlessly forward 
Open your eyes 
Don <start> Images in the night sky
casting spells on those who gaze into the night sky
I see mystique and chaos in the lights
In the night sky leaving trails that linger across the night sky
Graceful they seem as they dance along the black
As they dance along the black
Blazing through the stars shining within the arctic landscapes
Behold this phenomenon's beauty Arise within the Northern horizon
Discern I am the lights they are with me inhabiting
inside the verve feeling the sense see how they gleam with luminous
rays through the air curtain of light opening slow revealing tales of long ago
forever will the glisten be upon the land not faltering
Never will the shining fade until the end
The end of time
Blazing through the stars shining with the arctic landscapes
Behold this phenomenon's beauty Arise within the Northern horizon <start> Quit moaning about fate and change
Stand up on your feet and rise
With every fall you get the pain you learn the lesson
Start now open your eyes
Dead bodies falling from the sky
We are the ape with the vision of the killing
A rain of shame that fills the mines
No other blood in me but mine
Time to open your eyes to this genocide
When you clear your mind you see it all
You're receiving the gold of a better life
When you change yourself you change the world
Your heart is pounding in the brain
As they drag you naked in the mud
A devil's dancing in the rain
How could you fall so low
No we will never let go
Let us watch them die
Time to open your eyes to this genocide
When you clear your mind you see it all
You're receiving the gold of a better life
When you change yourself you change the world <start> Now i'm sitting here writting about the lonelyness.
It's a bad day and the reasons for that are trivial
Love taken away.
Throughts at the mercy of the past.
Destroying myself.
My inside is crying for help.
Who cares x
I forgot to live for the moment.
I don't want to be wath I'm am
Wath will be in the future
I don't know what to expect. <start> Three feet of steel on my side
Tool of fate my reliable blade
Sharp enough to cut the scales
Pierce the heart to rip the veins
Swarfmade armor galvorn shield
Finest gear to the battle I wield
Mithril helm an laen shade
Breath of dragon won't burn my face
To the lair of the beast I'll ride
With my magic it's easy to hide
In those caves full of remains
Of fallen heroes who died by flames
Brave hunter true swordsman
Without fear he'll face the dragon
One strike one opinion
If you fail it's your destruction
The task of yours almost forlorn
To hunt the dragons until they've gone
Plenty of sorrow they've laid for us
Tears of grief the river of pain
No more fear you shall banish the bane
Carry on in your blades we trust <start> Thundering chains of truth
Entwining the immortal souls
Of those darkened through eras
Of hatred  war and betrayal
Coming forth their fiery passion
Sweeps through the night
In agony they await
The glory of destiny's grasp
The truth 
Sought by those
Who dance with infinite darkness
The one dream 
Conjured by torturous lifetimes
A time not ours
Deeper  deeper we shall dwell
Higher  higher we shall rise
Floating 
In a maze of darkened desires
Their eyes alone
Reveal the scars of an eternal existence
Awaiting 
The unveiling of the highest realms
Where the soul
Is freed in honour and pride <start> Los motores rugiendo estn
esperando la luz verde.
Su largada ha de entretenerme

We are travelling to a new age and to another land
Are we afraid of what's behind
Or perhaps what's to come
Once there was a promise
A name would free us from all lies
A word would unite all the dreamers
That day was last year
They are all the same
Only greedy gods
In autumn yellow we saw him rise
We had wished for a savior
But the newborn was the opposite
In his glowing eyes we saw nothing but hate and greed
The great hall was soon filled with our own blood
Fear was spread across the land
Our king was weak and soon died away
With his kingdom the crown fell
No one's left there to the story tell
We were the last ones to escape
Another world shall not fall
They are all the same
Only greedy gods <start> It knocks at the door no ones been there before
Questions and fear the big change is near.
Can we read the signs about mankind's down fall
Prophecy of truth millennium scares our youth.
Will the forecasts prove what old legends did tell
In the decade of pain no one will remain
Desperate eyes watch the burning skies
Killing machines death bringing dreams
Centuries ago
Some wish man did know
About our spell
We'll all go to hell
In the th month 
The king of terror will start his death machine
The . Antichrist will turn sun into darkness
His domain will be creeping success
World domination of pain
World domination of pain
One thousand years of wars
Who knows what's the fucking cause
A world domination of pain
The millennium of the insane
World domination of pain <start> Is there anybody there
Yeah

For a mental orgasm <start> The blood runs through my veins
I can't stand this world of pain
I got nerves but I can't feel
On my way to an endless life of hope and glory
Away from this world of shame I watch you from my eye as you slip away
A corruption is near and the angels escape
My mind is filled with my dark days past
You're just a teardrop in a world unknown from life
I say goodbye as I travel beyond infinity
There is no tomorrow
Suffering is gone
I feel nothing
Heaven says welcome home
The voices inside of my head is speaking to me and no one else
The suffering from yesterday is just a memory from my past
You're just a teardrop in a world unknown from life
I say goodbye as I travel beyond infinity
The curses inside of me is going to bring me down
The rage built inside of me will never leave
It rips me apart from the inside out
You're just a teardrop in a world unknown from life <start> Breaking out this stifled room
A jail cell a stell tomb
To see the light
My mere existence
God's kill in sight
Confined in madness
Jurors hate criminal minds
They're making dates for killing time
Breaking out this stifled room
A jail cell a stell tomb
One has to fight
For dissension
God's kill in sight
Confined in madness
Wasted life tasted
Wasted life tasted
Kill me
Kill me
Kill me
Kill me
Wasted life tasted
Wasted life tasted
One has to fight
For dissension
God's kill in sight
Confined in madness
Jurors hate criminal minds
They're making dates for killing time <start> I think that life is not only this touchable fugitive
Which though so beautyfull passes away so quickly
You used to stand behind me I felt warm touch heat passion
I looked back to embrace you
And I saw hot purple garden in bloom
Woman with a secret flower in hair
Every day with her was a secret unknown for me
And when I saw her scarlet flower in her hair
And a raven in the sky
I thought the raven is only a bad sign
And when you danced among the flowers high grass bloomy meadows
I rised to the sky to blow away stormy clouds
Watching her warming up in imagined flames
I saw as she flew up in the night  as a bird
I fly up into the abbys of the air
And I hear the voice of the woman so warm so close so painful
I dream you stand behind me I feel warm touch heat passion
I look back to embrace you and I see
Icy blackness deadly nothing <start> For all of our wandering
We've still so far to go
For all of our questioning
We've still the need to know
Are we still the frightened child
Are we still the angered youth
Or are we old before our time
Are we getting any closer to the truth
We're forcefed reasoning
Yet still can make no sense
The mind misses the point
Blind in its arrogance
Should we build a better way
With whatever we can find
If in turn it means we lose ourselves
Should we force a common mind
We're weaned on empathy
To satisfy our doubt
While attempts at unity
Have scattered us about
Should we invent a common bond
Through means misunderstood
Or are we simply widening the gaps
Should we force a brotherhood <start> I'm fading to grey
losing all track of time

I'm shattered in pieces

I am falling this time
I open my heart for you
Now I'm being something I'm not
Memories gone I'm falling behind
Now I'm standing lonely in tears
My heart is gone I'm falling behind
I'm fading away
I lose in the end I lose in the end
a reason to be
find me a miracle

What am I worth now

I open my heart for you
Now I'm being something I'm not
Memories gone I'm falling behind
Now I'm standing lonely in tears
My heart is gone I'm falling behind

there's no turning back

I'm falling behind

the legions are near me



Standing lonely in tears my heart is gone I'm falling behind
Now I'm being something I'm not
Memories gone I'm falling behind
Now I'm standing lonely in tears
My heart is gone I'm falling behind
Now I'm being something I'm not

Memories gone I'm falling behind

Now I'm standing lonely in tears

My heart is gone I'm falling behind <start> 
Nightmares
Demons haunt my taunted mind
I'm scared
My death's foreseen gloryful
Please Father
Make my demons disappear
Please Mother
Death is everywhere

My son I've seen your fear
I have felt your pain
No harm will come to you
An oath has been sworn

The evil forces around us
Still wants to destroy me
Who is the evil slayer
I cannot see
Loki the deceitful God
Discover the arrow of death
Pointed for the Hoder the blind
by the jealous Loki
The arrow cut through the skin
And into the heart of the bright one
Silence spread throughout the hall Aesir
As the God of Light fell to his knees dying
Sorrow throughout the nine worlds
The bright God is gone
Sent to Niflheim by the deceitful <start> There is always hope even when it seems very bad.
Far from the southern vulcanic sirens comes the hope through the winds...
Don't try to talk don't even try to move
You are too weak to think or try to pull it through
We are the good ones and we surely know the way
To give you better words you could ever say
We know how you should live your life
Here are the details you will see...
You must remember you're nothing without us
Alone down there you just don't have the guts
But with our help you're the saint of the land
If you're in trouble we give our helping hand
In our world there's no need to cry
'cos our spirit can live forever
With our trust with our goodness there's no need to die
It's the world of hypocrates
Believe in me there's no need to cry
'cos our spirit can live forever
With our trust with our goodness there's no need to die
It's the world of hypocrates <start> The memories far beyond the reckoning
Have begun to lurk in the distance
Like visual objects dearly known
The grace of devils hands
As they walk with me like a medium
When I choose and require a burnout
Resting in expanded malicious force
Drained for murderous weapons
Knowing where you stand
In the magnitude of this thought
Looking at the spirit of fire and flames
Enduring on the throne of the black heart
The memories far beyond the reckoning
Have begun to lurk in the distance
Like visual objects dearly known
The grace of devils hands
As they walk with me like a medium
When I choose and require a burnout
Resting in expanded malicious force
Drained for murderous weapons
Knowing where you stand
In the magnitude of this thought
Looking at the spirit of fire and flames
Enduring on the throne of the black heart
A bringer of evil I am
And therefore also a carrier of light
As I use this focus through the dark
And face the sunshine in the dead end
Limitations do not exist
When you are ahead of the crowd
With the art of confidence
I reign at the throne of my soul
The value of this darkness unwinds
Travelling the other path
A hidden triumph
But obvious to the strong and wise
By understanding this reality
I remain in a twicecoloured cloud
With feet connected solid in the ground
And thus I get peace of mind
A bringer of evil I am
And also a carrier of light
As I use this focus through the dark
And face the sunshine in the dead end <start> I'm watching the moon set
Walking through the woods
Tasting depth of winter
Morbidity and doom
I saw one million faces
I saw one million deaths
Colors are in dark gray
Veil of emptiness
Stalking in a nightmare
I was lost long ago
I gave all my love
Spirit's feeling low
Sorrow I'm dead tired tired of life
Eternal dusk my dungeon and desire
Shadows dark face in autumnal tints
Covering me lost in immortality
Crossing the old bridge
Like one thousand times before
Sadness autumnal equinox
Sunbeams nevermore
Soulful my heart is bleeding my soul is seeking
For salvation and release
Soulless no more longing no more loving
Just the ashes of my thoughts
For ever and a day

Death is the salvation
For ever and a day

Life is the damnation
For ever and a day
Ghosts are hunting me
For ever and a day
Death is the salvation
Stamping underwood down
Plot revenge that kills
Leaving life behind
Sowing death and thrills
I saw one million faces
I saw one millions deaths
Colors are in dark gray
Veil of emptiness
Sorrow I'm dead tired tired of life
Eternal dusk my dungeon and desire
Shadows dark face in autumnal tints
Covering me lost in immortality
For ever and a day

Death is the salvation
For ever and a day

Life is the damnation
For ever and a day
Ghosts are running free
For ever and a day
Death is the salvation
Death is the salvation
Death is the salvation
Death is the salvation
Death is the salvation
Death
Sorrow in shadows
Soulful but soulless
Throughout time and space
Misantrophic race
Man hunting echoing pain
Endless night starts again
For ever and a day

Death is the salvation
For ever and a day

Life is the damnation
For ever and a day
Ghosts are hunting me
For ever and a day
Death is the salvation
For ever and a day

Death is the salvation
Death is the salvation
Life is the damnation
Death is the salvation
Life
Death is the salvation
Life is the damnation
Death is the salvation
Life life
Death above life
Death above life <start> In your hands there's a newpolished  it boosts your ego and the trigger
makes you king innocence can't cut the troaths of your victims in your
head there's a plague released by your evil I.
Chorus
Just take a look in the mirror you'll see yourself with horns
a man not too unfamiliar but you have not seen him before.
Oh... your hand are dirty the stains of blood will never leave.
In your past there's a little boy who wets the bed picked on for life.
But the time has come for a bloody revenge your parents went first to taste
a bit of your newfound pride the world will pay and you'll walk the streets
with your head held high.
Chorus
Just take a look in the mirror you'll see yourself with horns
a man not too unfamiliar but you have not seen him before.
Oh... your hand are dirty the stains of blood will never leave. Oh... your
hand are dirty the stains of blood will never leave.
What a plan you never meant for this to happen you never understood why
you got the gift to make them die nothing from the past can make the future
live again hospitalized
The troopers didn't care for your life.
Chorus x
Oh... your hand are dirty the stains of blood will never leave. <start> Tell me your weak excuse
Of how I never cared to see
The pain you were put through
All you do is point the finger
And through your blame
What lies in the past
Is never coming back
It's the reality
Of your decisions
You can't run from the truth forever
It will always beat you in the end
As you stand there
Holding the shattered
Pieces of your life
Chiding everyone
For not protecting you
Believe that you're the martyr
And drowned in your own lies
What we had
Is never coming back
Never coming back <start> I deny your wretched lifestyle
Who am I to fool myself
A distant cry of help from others
A child's brain a world of greed
It's all around you can't you see
Are you blind to the like of me
Politician I see through your charade
Speaking all your brainless lies you're all the same
Mister preacher tell me what is right
Send the double figures son you'll see the light
Look into the distant future
will they have a tax on nature
How much more will still remain
They actually call themselves humane
I deny all you see
I don't have to belief
It's god's way says your horrid wife
Embezzling indulging
I believe your nose is growing
Extorting not reporting
Your pockets are overflowing
Tell us one more thing
How much more holiness did you bring
I see right through you
Soon they all will too <start> Awakened by the hands of Autumn
The hands which made me sleep
Was a shadow vague yet deep
A creature spine of the essence
Drifting in the wind clad as Sin
The force behind my cause
The hands that fold me within
Awakened beneath a restless sky
By mountains which darken the day
Shadows spiritual dust of my fathers
 The heart and soul of my way 
A creature spine of the essence
Drifting in the wind clad as Sin
The force behind my cause
Grim token of the path within
The Winterway
Leads us through the coldest night
The Winterway
To be walked by all men of might
Behold the ice on the big seas
The summits and the naked trees
Ashore the bay through the rough Winterway <start> Your mind to infinity
Let reason rivet on your feet or you may fall
You're drawn into a distant glow
You dream of voices from on high
But can't evade another rainy night
And putting on another show
Hate and affection
Pleasure and pain
Modes of vibration
Unveiling to be all the same
And when the final day has come
It's another state of matter
And when you face another sun
It's the union of the states of matter
Failure and defeat and all the riches surely beat
Where I have been and what I have been before
And when the sands of time run low
Commemoration of a lonely crow
That would have made it through the door
Light and affection
Darkness and pain
Mind of matter
The all's gonna make it all the same <start> bonus track
Betrayal you betrayed me
You betrayed me with a kiss
I thought you were my friend
Now I hate you
So much
You betrayed me with a kiss
You never really cared
It turned out to be wrong
So wrong
Can you trust in your friend's words
Can he look into your eyes
Betrayal you betrayed me
Discussing all the things with you
I told you all my secrets
You told it to the world
And laughed about it
I would have given anything
If you just asked me for
I was too good for you
Too good for you
Now I ask you
Why did it have to be like this
'Cause I miss you
Sometimes
Can you trust in your friend's words
Can he look into your eyes
Betrayal you betrayed me
You betrayed me with a kiss
I thought you were my friend
Now I hate you
So much
Can you trust in your friend's words
Can he look into your eyes <start> Night brings patience
And lucidity of mind
Am I the only one who is awake
It seems to me that right now
Things are even more real and clear
To some extent I am filled with darkness
With darkness
I dont need the sun to be my source of light
Cause Ive got it inside
I dont need the moon to be my company
Cause Ive got it inside
Ive locked the darkness in the lighthouse
Its all about keeping it inside and not letting it out
This is what my life turns in
I am filled with darkness and light
Im a lighthouse
I dont need the sun to be my source of light
Cause Ive got it inside
I dont need the moon to be my company
Cause Ive got it inside
I give my light to those who are adrift and keep the darkness inside
Cause I am

I dont need the sun to be my source of light

Last night as I lay dreaming
of pleasant days gone by
Me mind been bent on rambling
to Ireland I did fly
I stepped on board a vision
and followed with a will
Till next I came to anchor
at the cross near Spancill Hill.
Delighted by the novelty
enchanted with the scene
Where in me early boyhood  often I had been
I thought I heard a murmur
and I think I hear it still
It's the little stream of water
that flows down Spancill Hill.
To amuse a passing fancy
I lay down on the ground
And all my school companions
they shortly gathered round
When we were home returning
we danced with bright goodwill
To Martin Moynahan's music
at the cross at Spancill Hill.
It was on the th of June
the day before the fair
When Ireland's sons and daughters
and all assembled there
The young the old the brave the bold
came their duty to fulfil
At the little church in Clooney
a mile from Spancill Hill.
I went to see me neighbours
to see what they might say
The old ones they were dead and gone
the young ones turning grey
I met the tailor Quigley he was bold as ever still
sure he used to make my britches
when I lived at Spancill Hill.
I paid a flying visit to me first and only love
She's as fair as any lilly and gentle as a dove
She threw her arms around me
crying Johnny I love you still
She was a farmer's daughter
the pride of Spancill Hill.
Well I dreamt I hugged and kissed her
as in the days of yore
She said Johnny you're only joking
as many the times before
The cock crew in the morning
he crew both loud and shrill
And I awoke in California
many miles from Spancill Hill. <start> Astonishments when I bend over you creep
Put a noose around my neck
Which side I reside it's my time to reap
It's your side wicked and deaf
Take me to the place I can sleep
Wipe away all misery
Turn my path away
From the mind tearing tragedy
Consuming range of vision
I can see they decline
It's a stay of execution
I fly free tonight
New moon laughs on it's own
Without compassion
I crawl through the realms unknown
And kneel to the goddess of the sad man
Goddess of the sad man
Goddess of the sad man
Goddess of the sad man
Inhale all mists from the shadows
And hide before the dawn
Face your mortal horror
You won't be reborn
Inhale all mists from the shadows
And hide before the dawn
Face your mortal horror
You won't be reborn
Is he a proud man or just a fraud
Fooling himself with a losers talk
Punished to eternal vanity
It's thy destiny to cry for purity
You infidel slime
I grace insanity
Satisfy my agony
I know what my goddess needs
I bet there's something wrong
Inside my psycho creep
Fire burns within her eyes
Take me to the deadly ride
I remember how she was
When she choked on her own pride
New moon laughs on it's own
Without compassion
I crawl through the realms unknown
And kneel to the goddess of the sad man
Goddess of the sad man
Goddess of the sad man
Goddess of the sad man
Goddess of the sad man
Goddess of the sad man
Goddess of the sad man
Goddess of the sad man
Goddess of the sad man <start> Put on that dress I'm going out dancing
Starting off red clean and sparkling
He'll see me music playing
Make it dreamy for dancing
Must be a way that I can dress to please him
It's hard to walk in the dress it's not easy
I'm spilling over like a heavy loaded fruit tree
If you put it on if you put it on
If you put it on if you put it on
It's sad to see lonely all this lonely
Close up my eyes
Dreamy dreamy music make it be alright
Music play make it good for romancing
Must be a way I can dress to please him
Swing and sway everything'll be alright
But it's feeling so damn tight tonight
If you put it on if you put it on
If you put it on if you put it on
You purdy thang my man says
But I bought you beautiful dresses
You purdy thang my man says
But I bought you beautiful dresses
Filthy tight the dress is filthy
I'm falling flat and my arms are empty
Clear the way better get it out of this room
A falling woman in dancing costume
If you put it on if you put it on
If you put it on if you put it on
If you put it on if you put it on
If you put it on if you put it on <start> Man creates the god
And the god destroys the man
Betrayed by their own invention
The shepherd butches the lamb
A lion at the head of an army
Of sheep when comes time to feed
Like Saturn devoured his children
They're consumed by belief
Chorus
I am the chosen one
And I hold the key
Behold the prodigal son
This good I do lives long after me
Let iconoclasm set you free
Christ is the same yesterday
And today forever a lie
They concocted the heavens
To keep all the puppets in line
Narcotic addictive desire
To believe they won't go to hell
A dog that has bitten its master
That it once knew so well
Chorus
Figment of imagination
Oracle of ignorance
Corrupter of society
Killer of reason and innocence
An object of man's creation
Made to fill the hole inside
But that abyss has only been opened wide
Wolves they guard the flock
And they slaughter the sick and the weak
Sorrow is all that they find
When salvation is all that they seek
The truth is the greatest lord
Where no fool commands the wise
Religion ten times undone
No room for compromise
Chorus <start> It's the sea of life a nightmare
For the searching and ever coming back.
In the middle of the empty nowhere
In a deep hole that is getting black
The sea
Is a pool full of tears that shed
My solitude that was thus fed
With the outrage voices uttered by the sirens.
The sea
Is the vast void from I can't flee
Is the smooth mirror of my glee
Like liquid stuff of blurred time
Chorus
In the unstill bluish sea
Searching a port that cares for me
Coming back to get free
My tortured soul
I can ride
In love the waves in glide
In love I'm looking for a reason to hold on
Hearing in the sea an old tone
Of mermaids at my side
While the waves make my ocean tide
The sea
Is where I just try to make sense
Of this life fabric thick and dense
Where I can feel distress and dismay for me.
The sea
Is the great well of fantasy
Whose source is our melancholy
From which springs up and flows
Chorus
The sea
Is a pool full of tears that shed
My solitude that was thus fed
With the outrage voices uttered by the sirens.
The sea
Is the vast void from I can't flee
Is the smooth mirror of my glee
Like liquid stuff of blurred timed <start> False words give the base of dogmas
Get higher 'n' higher
Behind the shadows there's a darkness
It's fight forever
Behind the mask of religion
A dictatorship
Under the pressure a fate of nation
Their hands're in clenched fist
In the faith  Hidden fear
In the pray  Uncertainty
Go down on your knees
There's no other chance for you 'n' me
False Domination
The head of the state is in uniform
The borders are closed
In the hot sand there're traps of tanks
Depth is the richness
People die and fight 'till the end
They've got just one god
A false domination has the press
Madness what they've got <start> Music  Lyrics by Eviga
Das Kind das ich einst war sah still und lnger hin
Es ruhte auf der Luft ...
doch irgenddann brach ich aus mir herab.
Ich fiel hinein in die Zeit doch leider nicht unendlich weit ...
Mein Schmetterfels  Vergnglichkeit.
Und whrend mein Blick nun jahrelang durch
Gedankenscherben strich
sich nur schmerzlich weiten konnte flog die Zeit in meinem
Schatten und drngte traurig heimlich
mich.
Erst an welker Nchte Morgen als scherbenfrei der Blick sich
spannte sah ich in seiner ganzen Flle Die Zeit die sich
mein Leben nannten ja die ich einst als Kind schon kannte
ein Lichtspiel eines kindlichen Seins das wandelfarb'nen
Blickes
mich ja mich erwnschte.
Ihr Blick glitt weich in Silben 
Ich bin Dein einzig' Publikum
drum mein Wesen fhl' vertraut
la sehn wohin man durch Dich schaut
und fhlen mich mit Deiner Haut
Ich erlebe was Dir wirklich ist.
Ich bin Dein einzig' Publikum
drum mein Wesen denk' vertraut
Ich mchte was Dein Geist anstaunt.
Sei
Ich bin inbei.
Sie schmiegte sich wild an meine Hlle
Taumelasche sprach von Wind
Sie ist Neugier  die Endlose
Staubfliehender hie dies Hast.
Sie nahm meine Gesten
wie Ich sie innigst meinte
und ehe Ich AlleinSein sehnte
erflo Sie all mein Sein
langsam dunkel voll und sanft ...
Jetzt bin ich beinah wieder Kind
frei belebe ich jeden Moment
ohne Furcht vor vielem Gestern
denn in Zeit bin ich mir selbst Geschenk.
Der Moment ist dabei Publikum.
Mein Lidschlag fordert ihn heraus
mein Lcheln ist wie sein Applaus
Und manchmal gleicht mein leerer Blick
seinem enttuschten Entsetzen
denn wenn ich ihm nichts mehr zeigen kann
erhebt er sich  verlt mich schnell
und nur einem gefllt meine starre Not
nun ist es vorbei.
Denn da klatscht
Der Tod. <start> Can you feel it building
Devastation is on the way
Feel the hair on the back of your neck
As the rush begins
You can't take it away
I earned this with sweat and blood
You can't take it away
Take what's mine
Breathing new life back into me
Challenging all the powers that be
Can you feel it slipping
As you lose your grip on me
Can you face that I won in the end
I can't keep from laughing
You can't take it away
I earned this with sweat and blood
You can't take it away
Take what's mine
Breathing new life back into me
Challenging all the powers that be
Breathing new life back into me
Challenging all the powers that be
Don't you see it coming
When you've caught on it's too late
When it hits don't forget who I am
Don't forget this face
You can't take it away
I earned this with sweat and blood
You can't take it away
Take what's mine
Breathing new life back into me
Challenging all the powers that be
Breathing new life back into me
Challenging all the powers that be <start> I've been dragged through
Mud here
Entirely beat up and torn
But when last night
Comes back to me I sure as hell know
We rocked went crazy
And far beyond
When I look back
And ask myself
Was it worth it
Hell yeah
Ignore the Pain
Hungover
But I'll do it again
Crying
Tears made of grit
Flying
Oh yea it was worth it
Withdrawal kickin' in. I can't shake it
Yet in one way I have to take it
I'll rock. Go nuts
And far beyond
And I look back
I don't need to know
Was it worth it <start> Hit the North
My Cat says eeeeeack
Hit the North
 of hayseeds or cornpone guaranteed
Computers infest the hotels
Cops can't catch criminals
But what the heck they're not too bad they talk to God
Religioussssss
Hit the North
Manacled to the city manacled to the city
All estate agents alive yell down nights in hysterical breath
Those Northern lights... so pretty
Those big big big wide streets
Those useless MPs
Savages...
Hit the North 
From the back third eye psyche the reflected mirror of delirium
Eastender and Victoria's lager the induced call mysterious
comes
forth  Hit the North

Hit the North <start> Detruncated
Legs forced down into pavement
By hole in flatbed truck
Blatantly painful roadrash device
Shredding limbs when appendages need a trim
Two solid bloody lines for miles
Grinded bone muscleflesh fragments
Grated up to the waist
Screaming stump for the vultures to taste
Left by the roadsideded
Amputation through roadrash
Left by the roadside
Dead <start> Verzagend erklimme ich nun das eisig' Verlangen
Andacht nur ein Wort ein klitzekleines Wort
Schlank ist der Dorsch und doch vielsagend
zernagt er den Docht das Nein noch bejahend
Am liebsten tt' ich mich morgens und fall' den Mrdern anheim
befreit von Lust und Sorgen kann ich das Boot nur sein
Wenn Seelen scheu zerbersten und Totgebor'ne schrein
Erzhlt mir kalt das Feuer von Schnheit Trug und Schein
Hinaus schwankt ein Jesus der trumt' er wr' ein Gott
mich gab es nur im Fernsehen dort trugen sie mich fort
Beth ist mein Name ich ritt den dunklen Lord
Ich geh' immer noch unter kann den Tisch nicht mehr seh'n
der Stuhl lngst verschwunden kann ich nur noch untergeh'n
Am liebsten tt' ich mich morgens und fall' den Mrdern anheim
befreit von Lust und Sorgen kann ich das Boot nur sein
Wenn Seelen scheu zerbersten und Totgebor'ne schrein
erzhlt mir kalt das Feuer von Schnheit Trug und Schein
Trug und Schein <start> Have you any idea
What it's like to be me
Watching you succeed and move forward
All my wasted time tensing in anticipation
My thought process
Full grown and worthless
Safe when nobody is in your heart now
Take everything you can get your hands on
Save me save me from this yearning yet again
I have become what I always knew
I have become what I always knew
Every salvageable breath choked off in fear
I am the last thing I'll ever expect from me
Safe when nobody is in your heart now
Take everything you can get your hands on
Save me save me from this yearning yet again <start> A coward dies a thousand deaths
A hero dies but once
But what no one else has seen
Is the truth that lies inside
That behind the eyes of a hero lies a fear
No less
A fear
No less than mine
I say it time and time again
I don't want to be alone in this solitude
What is truth
Once one had asked
And still he seeks to find it
A man's fear is crushed when thoughts recall words heard so long ago
Search for an answer
A Holy book upon a shelf
Words cutting deep inside
Speaks to my heart and to my soul In this solitude
What is truth
Once one had asked
And still he seeks to find it
A man's fear is crushed when thoughts recall words heard so long ago <start> Conception full of illusions
But eyes filled with pain
What yesterday was still today
Is tomorrow against away
The suffering from other life
in the new built within
From mistakes will be learn
But reached stolen mind
As is to be death in life
And lifed for the death
Or is to be insanity from sorrow
Or from trouble insane
The life is a child play
But no game for children
The eyes of suffering
The eyes of suffering
The eyes of suffering
The eyes of suffering
In the eyes of suffering
You lifed for you death
In the eyes of suffering
To know more as words and mind
Many times ago
Your rotting flesh feeled away
Your corpse full of holes
Lying in a small coffin
Your soul leaved away
Your bones to fall to pieces
A dinner for maggots
remaining dust to stay <start> You don't know what you're facing.
You don't know what to believe.
From deep inside.
From out of nowhere.
It occupies your mind.
It's like a possession.
You're trying to say stop.
You know you can't give up.
You're trying to find
Another direction.
I'm the voice in your head.
I'm the voice and you're my slave.
I'm the voice in your head.
I'm the voice and you're my slave.
You thought you'd lost your sense of reality.
You thought you was the only one.
You know it's too late.
You know you can't escape.
You're out of control.
You can't avoid the future.
You're trying to wake up
But this is not a dream.
Your cry of distress
Is absolutely helpless.
I'm the voice in your head.
I'm the voice and you're my slave.
And you're my slave. <start> When she's sad the world is lonely
Silver clouds are crying only
For the pain she feels
So deep inside
The love she thought would save her
Has somehow now enslaved her
To a dream she though she wanted
To come true
Spread your wings you can fly
But the dove is never free
In painted skies that shade the color
Of your dream
Only nightmares are real
Confusion conceals the only reason
For the feelings you can't hide
When she smiles the world it shines
But the silver clouds are only there
To hide the distant storm
That's coming soon
The love she let surround her
Has become the waves that drown her
In the sea of everchanging
Warmth and cold
Spread your wings you can fly
But the dove is never free
In painted skies that shade the color
Of your dream
Only nightmares are real
Confusion conceals the only reason
For the feelings you can't hide
You can fly
Spread your wings you can fly
But the dove is never free
In painted skies that shade the color
Of your dream
When the nightmares ensue
All that you can do is paint your sky
Another brighter shade of blue
Spread your wings you can glide
Above the violent storms
That plague your life
You paint the picture blue or grey
Fly away <start> Existential matters ignite in circulation.
A motion to bend towards the swift end.
Encompassing a visionary plead to defend.
Liberation of the five senses the ego phrase.
Metamorphosis of perceptual principles.
Platonic illumination of Natures' quincunx.
Which hemisphere is mine to hold
Traveller of the xscape through endomorphism of time.
Hybrid existence  through spirituality endures the reality.
Traveller of the xscape through the gravisphere of wisdom.
Hyper potency  the predominant endurance through infinity.
The iridescence of the solar glimpse.
Through the eyes of Himm and Hippo.
Just another sole strike of the sun.
A stone in the hand or the thought of it
Traveller of the xscape through endomorphism of time.
Hybrid existence  through spirituality endures the reality.
Traveller of the xscape through the gravisphere of wisdom.
Hyper potency  the predominant endurance through infinity.
Thoughts of a thinker.
Infinity of numbers.
Numbered thoughts.
Thoughts of infinity.
Numbers are the essence of all things and the metaphysical
principle of rational order in the universe .
Liberation of the five senses the ego phrase.
Everlasting metamorphosis of perceptual principles. <start> A young girl terrified there's something out there. But is it real It must be because it's watching her. Her pleas for comfort and reassurance are ignored and soon all she has left is her imagination... And that's the most terrifying thing of all.
Alice isn't frightening
Alice aren't you scared
Alice isn't is wonderful
Living life afraid
Don't look around the corner
I might be lurking there
Under the bed at night
You're up till dawn again
Alison hell your mind begins to fold
Alison hell aren't you growing cold
Alison hell you are looking blue
Alice in hell what else can you do
Alice
I begin my rule life hideous in your mind
Crying out you've lost your doll
It isn't worth a dime
Alison hell your mind begins to fold
Alison hell aren't you growing cold
Alison hell what are you looking for
Alice in hell soon I close the door
Sitting in the corner you are naked and alone
No one listened to your fears you've created me
Alice isn't frightening
Alice aren't you scared
I was killed at birth
I shoot this final scene
You're in the basement
You're trapped insanity
Alison hell what were you looking for
Alison hell as I close the door
Alison hell here you shall dwell
Alison hell alice dwells in hell
Alice
Alice
Alison
Alice
In hell
Goodbye <start> Farewell now my griefing thoughts
For I once gave you flooding powers
This flaming fires shall return
To warm my days and light my hours
I might once meet you on my way
To celebrate in drunken nights
But shall the flaming sun's return
Seperate our lifes again. <start> My life is made of emotions
passions and horrors 'cause when you truly
live you can even fall into deep pain
My bed is made of small fresh leaves
moving slowly like a requiem
My temple is made of dark gloomy trees
coming loose along a black oval path
My chant is a desperate and irreverent elegy
composed in honour of those who have no reserve and fear
Hordes of maleficent and false sins come back upon me.
Shall I ever let my mind wander over the sad effect
this filthy disease causes to my limbs and to my heart
I believe the persistence of the thin line of hope is worth this effort
I believe its benefice can reach the intensity
of full and perpetual delight
Nothing is true all is allowed
In every dramatic situation there is
a subtended element of absurdity and humor
Every dogma contains something unhealthy and corrosive
Our identities change every day with our memories
We are not always what we really are 'cause we reinvent ourselves
We change our skin and consistence
And we lie with innocence trusting our memory. <start> I am the loner
The gloomy mist's owner
I am the sailor
In the sea of squalor
Waiting in the sand
That return your lovely light eyes
But I'm crying and dying
Eternally lying
Under the shower
A grave of black flower
Hollow...
In my soul
The tears in my face
The rain in the sad place
My soul is kneeling
The tide brings the feelings
I could live a dream
Where your spirit call on the high seas
Oh My lover I'm lonely
Time passes so slowly
My heart I bear
With pain of despair
Sorrow...
In the shore
From the breeze
Of the seas
The waves sing
The sweet song of your memory
In the deep
Of my soul
When the sirens
Of the ocean
Bring the silent
I cry
In my eyes
There's a lament of misery
In my sigh
A dark misery
So I die
Oh My love
I am dreaming darkness around
I am sailing in the ship's wound
Angels screaming
In the mist out at sea

Oh Silver mirror
Your cost was an error
I die of broken
My sentence was spoken
But in the cold foam
Stay hopes of my soul immortal
In the twilight the sky burn
And there isn't return
Only my reason
To live in this prison
Waiting...
In the shore <start> Needs to be a revolution
Maybe theirs to be less tension
They become into the nature
Far frustrating
Need some time for recollection
Maybe I don't need this fixing
Need to be a thing to nature
So proceed with caution
I pull my heart from the end
You always took it and broke it over me
You say that I didn't care
How could my dream turn to despair
Turn to despair
There is temporary redemption
Your demise is my creation
Let me talk into the next one
Talking symbols
We need some hope and recollection
Maybe then there'll be less tension
Take the one and burn the clothes off
Proceed with caution
I pull my heart from the end
You always took it and broke it over me
You say that I didn't care
How could my dream turn to despair
Push it go
Time to release the crease in the beast
The blood shed and killing when will it cease
Clenching our fist at the snap of our wrist
Time to get up and get down with the shh
Too much sorrow no tomorrow
Too much sorrow no tomorrow
Too much sorrow no tomorrow
Too much sorrow no tomorrow
Turn to despair
Turn to despair <start> disko de oro y nariz de platino

Mister Sandman bring me a dream
Mister Sandman bring me a dream

Then tell her that my lonesome nights are over
Mister Sandman I'm so alone
Don't have nobody to call my own
Please turn on your magic beam
Mister Sandman bring me a dream
Mister Sandman bring us a dream
Give her a pair of eyes with a congeal of gleam
Give her a lonely heart like Harlehatschi
And not so wavy hair like Liberatschi
Mister Sandman someone to hold
Would be so peachy before we're to old
So please turn on your magic bean
Mister Sandman brings us
Please please please
Mister Sandman bring us a dream
Yeah <start> Dark days
Greet us
With teeth
With claws
Her wings climb
Cold eyes
Gaze wide
With awe
With spite
Everyone
Everywhere
Every beast
Every man
Pays her price <start> Midday heat is low
Sun torches victims skin
Priests rise to command
Blood spills the altar stairs
Sacrifice to their gods
Sun sets the slaves all die
The hearts of humans left to dry
Burnt offerings to the sky
Temples built for priests with high
Messages and desperate dries
A message from a higher place
Condemning all your human race
Cowards run the rest await
Piousvirgin congregate
Offered to their gods from space
Watching on their human race
Looking into the darkness
From towers awaiting their signs
With fire they draw on our mountains
Their calendar tells us it's time
Bleed for the godz
Suddenly lightning about us
Outside a vanishing light
Looking around for the traitors
The seeds that will be left behind
Sacrifice to their godz
Sun sets the slaves all die
The hearts of humans left to dry
Burnt offerings to the sky
Looking into the darkness
From towers awaiting their signs
With fire they draw on our mountains
Their calendar tells us it's time
Bleed for the godz
Looking into the darkness
From towers awaiting their signs
With fire they draw on our mountains
Their calendar tells us it's time
Bleed for the godz bleed for the godz <start> Spoken Intro
How come some people think they know things
about other people when those people don't know those things even themselves.
Some people seem to be especially interested in talking shit
about others behind their back.
This is very pathetic but unfortunately it exists in regular basis.
It's always hard to know where the truth can be found
It's nearly as hard to decide who is telling the truth
Still you've found the way to classify the people
You are good and you're bad that's the way it is...
Everytime there are some virtuous doctrines that you want to teach you want
to teach...
Too long time you have tried to create something you can never reach you
can never reach...
You always know the things before we even know them for ourselves
You're just assuming it's the truth...
You always say the things before we even hear them for ourselves
You're talking shit and before you know you have to let it go
Why don't you let it go let the crowd repeat their tales
You've seen it all don't be the one you despise
Don't you ever beg that the ones you've disgraced
Will ever forget some day you'll pay the price <start> Playing on your complacency i never meant to fall behind. Chasing changes another night. We bury burdens under bridges tied from time and that's not why decisions design every line. Making mistakes moving on. Missing out moving on. Close my eyes another night to dream. All the better days are here. We burn in our own comfort. And that's not why sleeping lines won't hide blinding sides. Another nothing somewhere and that's not why sleeping lines won't hide. Keep count of idle time it always seems to fall behind. Lets not forget to find time to flaunt our faults. Then slip like cellophane on a broken window pained. Another way to pass these days close my eyes another night.And when we come around to some unfamiliar town another day dream disaster drowns. close my eyes another night. I always thought I missed this. It won't be hard forget to breathe these cycles lead. And we regret. I never meant to fall b <start> I'll tell you in one sentence.
The truth should not have broken you.
You know I'd never turn away
Not in your darkest hour.
I won't reiterate the immense failure on your part.
To let it die this way displays the weakness of your bonds.
Numb I crawl losing you. Over something so frivolous so petty.
But this pettiness is all you know.
You wear a chip on your shoulder like a badge of fucking pride.
A broken heart You broke your fucking own.
I remain. I never would have left your side.
And now my name will be another excuse for you to grovel in the illwill called your life.
I'll miss the friendship that we once shared.
As you ignite all that which made us strong.
The fires of envy blaze undying as this devotion is destroyed.
I watch our dreams reduce to ash throat stifled by the fumes.
The stench of brittle feelings burning wets my tender eyes with tear.
Our memories are the funeral pyre and your words are gasoline.
Our friendship meets a blackened fate an ashen epitaph.
These caustic embers yet remain soon to be blown away.
You will choke on my name. You'll choke on pictures of my face.
You will choke on my name. You'll choke on what you threw away.
I was a fool to ask so fucking little from you.
I should have recognized the frailty of your will.
I know that you can hear me. I hope that this is killing you.
I hope you sweat at night dreaming of my face.
Do whatever makes you happy no holds barred. shall remain etched into my mind.
When my eyes are finally graced with your crooked smile.
And my insides are licked by those familiar flames.
Flickering within my gut. Deep in my battered chest.
Burning a hole through my entrails. I won't fall.
I won't succumb to the pettiness which you breed.
I won't acknowledge the woe in which you live.
I won't forget the times we have spent.
I have pictures proving everything.
You will be fucking missed. <start> Someone is out there he's watching what I do
From far in the distance his eyes everywhere
I look around me there's no one that I see
But still I feel someone's controlling my mind
Save your breath and run
You can't escape the one
Time has come the world lies dying
Our faith has gone our souls are crying
Resurrecting paradise cry for freedom
Killing pain a million lies
Dethrone tyranny
Forces of evil they never surrender
Sooner or later the dark aera comes
Crying man on the run
He's searching for freedom but there will be none
Time has come the world lies dying
Our faith has gone our souls are crying
Resurrecting paradise cry for freedom
Killing pain a million lies
Dethrone tyranny
And as the world is dying slowly in our hands
We'll ask for reasons until the bitter end
Who brings us all the sadness
Who brings us all the fear
Who spreads disease and misery
And steals our destiny
A poisoned heart of anger
Sowing the seeds of pain
All see the darkened skyline
And feel the deadly reign
Time has come the world lies dying
Our faith has gone our souls are crying
Resurrecting paradise cry for freedom
Killing pain a million lies
To hell with tyranny <start> Say Mmmmmmuuuaahhh
Say Mmmmmmuuuaaaah

Monday night at operation control
I sat facing rows of monitor mountains
Mind control
Life control
Operation mind control
My first is in car
I'm easily bought but still always short
Fly that over space beam
And round my way the people still do say
Riddler
Riddler
And round these parts the people still impart
Riddler
My second is in..
Zoooooooom
Say Mmmmmm
Say Mmmmmm
And round my way the people still do say
Riddler
Round these parts the people still impart
Riddler
Riddler
Third slopes
Fourth inverting within
Round my way the people still do say
Riddler
And round these parts the people still exclaim
Riddler
And even now kids round our place say
Riddler <start> Glowing segment of the sun
Rising higher in our hearts
Facing our harmless wish
To hold tomorrow every day
Tomorrow dies tomorrow dies
In our hands in our sighs
Wishing night will never come
Catching light in every breath
The will to live the will to take
A step further to make the way
Tomorrow dies tomorrow dies
In our hands in our eyes <start> Thirst and desire to rule the lights
For crossing heaven's a futile fight
Bound to storm our mind's wave
Fervent to sail in deserts of mist
Juices like wine
Like the blood in the sands
Juices like wine
Born of the earth we strive for the skies
Obsessed with lies in arms of sleep
Earning dreams we blind our eyes
Challenging secrets ancient the cries
Juices like wine
Like the blood in the sands
Juices like wine
Juices like wine
Like the blood in the sands
Juices like wine
Juices like wine
Like the blood in the sands
Juices like wine <start> I who have forged the heavens
I also have my king
To northland I was sent
I was cast to distant Pohjola
Enforced by my king's spells
His orders undenied
From the small crumbs of earth
From the fleece of summer eve
From the memory of a single seed
From the flair of a swan's feather
I let the milk come seeping
From the heaven the heaven of my heart
There my skills were known to them all
They all knew my name
All knew of my might
And I forged a godly device
A machine divine
The gates of plenty opened by me <start> By the works of Darkness... My
By the works of Hatred... Eyes
By the rites of the Waste... Meet
By the words of Pain... Yours
And our eyes meet the flames

No spice shall ever silence my hunger
No wine shall ever silence my thirst.
No delight shall ever satisfy my senses
No woman shall ever satisfy my lust.
My eyes meet yours and I turn my face away <start> Mourners gather round
look at the corpse in a casket
teardrops hit the ground
what is this
Touching the dead
feels so cold
Carrying the body
to the open ground
Final time you see it
it is going down
Mourners gather round once more
look at the closed casket
Mother faints to the floor
What is it
Preacher say your senseless words
listening its so absurd
this ordeal is nothing new
now the cemetery owns you
You are but a slave to the grave <start> In the fire of the sunken sun
fast as ravens bullets thoughts I run
I inhale the golden oil
and I fear forever darkness
Nights come bringing snow
Forever darkness in my soul
Black cold days will never cease
when the ground shakes and the light falls
Look into Your heart
Do You see the ruins of what we felt before
Look into Your heart
Forever darkness in my soul
Do You see the ruins of what we felt before
Look into Your heart
Do You feel it
Do You see the ruines
of what we felt before
Sickening lives the fallen man
This is our world
Here the snake gets her poison
to kill innocense in paradise
Lies come spirit's gone
devil's might has won
Black cold days will never cease
when the ground shakes and the light falls <start> Music by Callenish Circle
Lyrics by Ronny Tyssen  Patrick Savelkoul
The dawn has reached the sky
What does the darkness try to hide
Shadows overrun the sunlight
Nocturnal violence took it's price
Diabolic evil minds
They rule atrocious bestial crowds
Ideas seem to fade away
as their presence is shown by howls
The dawn has reached the sky
Shadows overrun the sunlight
Confusion don't let the shadows rule your life
Existence hold up the sun and humanize
Eyes betray their parlous lies
Their purpose should be known by now
Anxiety for improvement
Trying to neglect their appearance
Forced into seclusion
Secrecy has caused your breakdown
In the darkness you fear for your life
When the shadows appear into your mind
Your dreams seems to turn to dust
The desire you feel deep inside <start> Surrender you sinners
We'll purify you hearts
So demons will return
Where corrupted souls burn
Around the castle dogs are out
Villagers hiding in terror
Every door and window is blocked
The witchunt has begun
Verifying each and everyone
For traces of evil
No magic allowed said the queen
Or burn at the stake you will
Surrender you sinners
We'll purify your hearts
Around the castle dogs are out
Innocent people are in danger
Soothsayer illusionist healer
Whoever you are don't resist
Wherever you go they'll find you
Even if you're hiding away
What ever you say or do
No sinner will last
Surrender you sinners
We'll purify your hearts
So demons will return
Where corrupted souls burn
Surrender all you sinners
Who's hearts are in despair
Wizards and witches will burn
And all the sinners will have learned
Surrender
Now time has gone by
No sinner left around here
Did they kill all of them Oh no
Surrender you sinners...
Surrender sinners
So demons will return
Where corrupted souls burn
Surrender all you sinners
Wizards and witches will burn
And all the sinners will have learned <start> Countless pointing fingers
A nameless crowd too swollen to analyse
Takes a rise out of the stranger
Don't know where he's come from
Bumfuck raises birds of paradise
They surmise very wise
One night they witnessed
How he lit his backdoor winds
Fire turned the night into day
and they prayed fell on their knees
And turned their glances off his face
And they knew they have been chosen to obey
Pardon me
Raise a graven image
I'm the new messiah for the world
You can't see the splendor of my nimbus
But I'm the new messiah for the world
But I'm the new messiah for the blind
For the blind
The word shall spread like wildfire
Here you got a new messiah holding sway
Delightful game
Don't you give away I'm no redeemer
But bring me grapes and diamonds right away
And a maid to lay...
One day oblivion will swallow up my fame
The common run of mankind will forget my name
Forget my name
Like a phoenix rising someone else is gonna reign
Till then you know that you are to obey me
Pardon me...
Gluttony and extasy there's velvet on my dais
Lions ladies rotaries they never spare with praise
A million pointing fingers
Have turned to clapping hands
Now I'm off to Betty Ford
See you in hell my friends
Pardon fucking me who the fucking fuck is Jesus
I'm the motherfucking new messiah
for the fucking world 
Pardon me... <start> All witches fly to me...
I have torn the veil of dreams
Enraptured by  moonfrost's caress
My heart is held in icy thrall
The horned moon's sweet enchantment
The topaz throne is beckoning
The jewelled sword awaits my grasp
The dreaming gods now grimly brood in
The silence of atlantean spires.
The sky is black with chaosfiends
Spellcraft rides with witchstorm's wings
Beneath the vaults of timelost tombs
Sorcerers summon the shadowkings.
All witches fly to me
Witch of heather moor and sea
Come lay with me as twilight falls
Grant me the black elven sword
And the draught of immortality
The scent of night about your flesh
Enfold me in this mist of lace
Your lips grow red by candlelight
My beloved is raventressed.
The sky is black with chaosfiends
Spellcraft rides the witchstorm's wings
Beneath the vaults of timelost tombs
Sorcerers summon the shadowkings.
And now the blossoms fade
Lost within your dark eyes 
The sweetest tears I taste 
This ichor of your kisses...
Weave thy dark spells
'neath the bright moon
Witchfire is glimmering through
Sunken marble halls.
The black gate opens...
Blood sates the ebon blade... <start> When daylight's gone the beauty's still left
Preserved for eternity by the love of the night
A sunset of embre a rose in the sky
Kiss of the sungod farewell to the world
The skies are ablaze with the loss of the day
And will be again til' the morning has come
Bring on the night its beauty in black
Enchanted mistress I'm held onto its grip
Days of darkness soon to arrive
Blessed to the beauty of the sunkissed land
When daylight's gone... <start> Test of my heart
Test of my heart
Test of my heart
Test of my heart
No I won't foretold coast to coast
Footloose scenarios can't break my fame
Maintain trade meditate all hours can't wide
Operate straight from this place I say
Tall words we'll stop to where I foretold to give
Or I will stop to drop what was still
I stop to clutch my blood
Fucked up thoughts turned the plot
Test of my heart
Test of my heart
Cut much caught up tossed enough got it rough
Thinking much about staying above
The dust fit into battle handle cheap shots
Respond or be gone beyond this Babylon con
I've hurt worse than this turn it into new purposes
Heard nervousness brings curses
It will take more than your amount to house
My count so bounce I hold it down
Catchin' a bad one catchin' a bad one
Catchin' a bad one catchin' a bad one
Test of my heart
Test of my heart
Can't believe it's happening again
All this hasn't convinced to the transcend
This can't be forced out of me
That familiar push can strain my energy
Can you be here to challenge my fate
If so you can't be stronger than predestined days
Force me in a corner and we'll both lose
The value of this is far beyond me or you me or you love
Test of my heart
Test of my heart
Catchin' a bad one catchin' a bad one <start> Celtic Frost cover
Necromantical screams
Only you are deaf
Is there life beyond death
You entreated death the answer will come
Oebris of faith even you are false
Immortal morals catch up with time
Vault of darkness filled with hate
Deny life addiction to death
Procession of damnation expulsion of light
Hazardous ways into the rush
Soul is frozen and flesh is weak
Necromantical screams
Only you are deaf
Intelligence is mute...
Respect and thoughts buried long ago
Pleading for the end blind and dumb
We won't feel there could be more
I will remain alone in the dark

Appetite aroused by the smell of your fear
Driven by desire instinct and hunger
And I will survive while you die

In your slow demise mercy denied
Bitter is the taste of your last breath
Choking on a bite from the apple of eden
Victim of my lies deceit and betrayal
And I will survive while you die

Again and again from the birth of time
Steal your soul shed my skin
Over and over until the end of time
Look into the eyes of fate
Destiny you can't escape
Precious life that you now chase
Slips away as you're erased
Seasons come and seasons go
What will come you'll never know
Future is a mystery
For this lock there is no key
So you pray but I say it's too late
Running from the hands of doom
Crawling back into the womb
Look of horror on your face
Feeble human wasting space
Time has come to say goodbye
And a life lived in a lie
Your tomorrow is now gone
The devil incarnate lives on
So you pray but I say it's too late <start> Music  EvigaValnes Lyrics Eviga

Says he's gonna start the third world war

The land he says that's his he's takin' it back

A war for peace  I understand

All my life I've spent believin' what I'm told
I'm not a crook I don't recall excuse is getting old
But this time I believe that the cause is justified
So those that burn the flag should be hung until they die
I'm sorry bout the casualties you can't avoid in war
They knew what they were doin' when they signed up for the chore
And to all the people who protest aggressive act
The world's not a happy place a sad but true fact
Now they find our allies far and wide
And now a force of one and will not be denied
When will they finally realize
Our taxes pay for war and that's no surprise
Strong survive  in desert sand
 barbaric land
 I understand

Strong survive  in desert sand

All my life I've spent believin' what I'm told
Those excuse you know the ones that're getting old
But this time I believe that the cause is justified
So all those people that burn the flag should be hung until they die

They knew what they were doin' when they signed up for the chore

Life's bitter journey towards the end
Pass the threshold and beyond
Your time has come
With a conscience cold as the coins upon your eyes
Leave your earthly form behind
Across the seas of blood to shores of the damned nothingness surrounds now
Wear the flesh of fallen angels
Burning in this void cleansed and remolded stripped of a sinful past
A life of misery and pain has come to it's end <start> Black metal is gay as a Catholic priest
Slouching toward Gomorrah
Face painted like Gene Simmons at Halloween
With a tongue up some kids rump looking for candy

Harken ye unto my Word
Queen of heaven Queen of Hell

I bear the whore drunk with the blood of Jesus.
I rise from the abyss to avenge the memory of my martyrs
of Judas of Cain and all the heretics
of the swearers the witches and the heirs of Lucipher's Temple.
I've come to sweep away the Christians nightmare
to shake the world with the scream of PAN
to free mankind from the slavery of the beggar God
REIGN WITH ME IN HELL
DON'T BE A SLAVE IN HEAVEN <start> Can anybody hear me now
A cruel land's fallen son
Pleading to the skies above
Forgive me please for what I've done
The only truth is death they claim
I chose to gift that lie
Force feeding truth to so many
My eyes numb as I watched them die
Chorus
Train me then blame me
I bought into this game
Mold me then scold me
I'll never be the same
If only you could see me now
I broke a dark onesided twisted vow
You take a poor broke lost and stolen soul
And simply throw his world away
Believe me when I tell you now
They mold the truth and turn it upside down
It took me years to see and comes this far
And still I feel so lost today
Will anybody save me now
Exposed I stand alone
A prisoner in my own body
No place really feels like home
I've grown to see the wrong I've done
And I cannot shake this pain
So I close my eyes and let it go
With one final breath of shame
Chorus
Rain down on me
And wash this pain away
Rain down on me
And wash this pain away <start> When I see me in your eyes
I just want to go blind
When I build coffin worlds with words
I just want a place to hide
When old ghosts meet new regrets
My daylight fades to grey
When our days bring guilt and shame
My heart turns black 
These are my tombs
Painted black and blue
These are my tombs
Painted just for you 
Goodnight
Goodnight dear
Goodbye

Can you hear me There's something wrong with me I can't talk I can't speak I can hardly even say these words at all. Yeah I know there's something wrong with me and I haven't got a thing that i can spin around my head. Ties the tongue with silver string and holds almost everything. Painted on like clouds and sky. I built a pair of human eyes. Ties the tongue with silver string hold on almost everything and it's only half of what you always wanted. Everybody's got it all and it's going around. <start> Midnight the midnight sky
Brings the star alive makes my soul thrive
As the desert it calls me home
Heavy the sin and the Incomprehensible that it brings
Death don't keep me from my door
Are you afraid to die
Have you been sanctified by the blood purified
Keep me from my door
The October moon couldn't come too soon
So damn the summer get the devil in all of ya
Damning the heavens keep
Damning the heavens keep
Damning the heavens
Damning the heavens keep

Damning the heavens
Cold wing sings dark kiss on her back
His mark upon the bow guided us along
When you bury the beast
Better cover his blood and bones deep
And point his eyes down
Seen in the starts last night read in the cards today
This will wash away keep
Damning the heavens keep
Damning the heavens keep

May the new order take your hand we walk in lines for the funeral of man
You watch heaven as we enter hell
Revolution the exodus of souls
Revolution exodus the paradox of mind

May the future open wide tonight may the true conflicts start the fight
May the stars of death be the only light upon a future damned and drunk our might
You dream of angels and we bring you hell
Revolution the exodus of souls
Revolution exodus the paradox of mind

Another flag to burn laws in chaos and other page to be turned
Strong stand the enemy and shall only stand proud upon the codes of life

I've been around since the creation of time
Strip off your soul
And I bend for the
Splendor of death open my veins for nothing but my selfish desire
Fornicated beyond the laws of the world raped by terror  forever <start> Father
Art thou blind and deaf
Old man
Decrepit and hideous
Hidden in woods of madness and anxiety
I am the beast thou  the refugium of love
Whereas your love as a cockroach
Under my own boot
I am the gehenna of humanity whereas thou art me mercy
And what shalt thou need it for
If the world shall fall asleep under my wings anyway
I am the blood from thy limbs thou art the wisdom
Is it a great one yes vain fools do beliefe in it
They still go up in flames in anyway
Devils tongue is the tongue of fire
Yes the same that burneth thine houses
Consumeth light and thy sheep... damned
And even their wool is shaddy and the meat poisonous
Not for the hungry dogs at my table
I shall destroy everything or not...
I shalt throw it to vultures to devour let them feast
Devils tongue is the tongue of the night
Whenever thou delight in this beauty
Thou pour in thyself the wine of the underworld
And whenever thou crave for bearing it
There are only the whispers of trees thou can hear
Hungry of thy love I am anticipating my time...
Devils tongue is the tongue of my father
The one who with universe constituteth an entity
Father who shall not sell thou out for any flirt
Forlove  affairs kisses of humanity
Therefore give me his darkness
Power might hope and fulfillment
Give me his light
It is the time for the feast of hell... <start> Oh woh eh

Preparing the standoff
A meeting of the minds must be understood
Benevolent grin couldn't be kinder
The ceremony guest is unveiling his hood
Draining power straight from the pillar
A grisly affection no one denies
The darker the room
The warmer the climate
For an unsuspected thrill homicide
Open mindedness
You're old enough to know
Narrow mindedness
Lethargic is thought
Your brain slowly rots
Lust for the taste no time to waste
It gives me it gives strength
It gives strength over you 
Waited the day
That I'd be discovered
Oblivious fools take the longest time
Endless travels
Through laws of nature
Opening boxes oh what a find
Maximum pain with minimal pleasure
Strive for the things that you never can have
Chasing a dream that seems so appealing
Only to awaken on the wrong path
Begging to be the servants pet
Breaking free from the horde of norm
Futile transition plenty of residue
The cheerful flesh is rolled into form <start> You're weaving bloodlust with instigation
producing scenes of intimidation
a footstep CLOSER TO THE GRAVE

Had sworn to be unified
Through the thick and thin no matter
Lose or win together till they die
Out to conquer the world destiny unfurled
Before their very eyes
Forever living the dream or so it seemed
Beneath the hidden lies
Look to the left and right
The enemy in sight
They will earn your trust
They will call you brother
They will be your friend
Then turn and trade you for another
In the days of the sun they would kill
As one solid death machine
No one stood in their way but the price
To be paid yet remained unseen
Then along came the rain bringing
With it the pain and disarray
The colors started to fade turning into
A grey shadow of yesterday
Look to the left and right
Attack by day or night
They will earn your trust
They will call you brother
They will be your friend
Then turn and trade you for another
Lies corruption selfIndulgence
Greed deceit wolves in the sheep
They will earn your trust
They will call you brother
They will be your friend
Then turn and trade you for another <start> Sometimes it's easy to believe
It's worth the pain sometimes
You wonder if your efforts were all in vain
You talk to shadows on the wall
You try so hard to understand
How all the little lies and lectures can contradict
You've lost the sense
Flow into your mind
Embracing like a mother's womb
Flow and you will find
Forgotten pictures of the moon
You think the world is all dependent on your good will
And you believe there's always someone right behind you
To pay the bill
A pretty face is not enough to conquer anything at all
A money mountain couldn't save you
You slide your back against the wall
Flow into your mind embracing like a mother's womb
Flow and you will find forgotten pictures of the moon
The pretty face you always trusted will turn around and speak to you
And you will realize too late
You're someone that you never knew <start> It boils down to
That I'm bored to tears
Bottom line is it ends right here
Shot yourself
Cried short changed save your breath
So say what you will
Scrape the bottom
I've had my fill
Sell yourself
You've sold out
Sent packing
By yourself
Entry
Into the empty
I have a tongue
Like a machete
So be ready
I am
Evil on swift wings
That comes to punish all things
A whisper in a windstorm
Soul's mine
Cause you're at sick
Your sold down the river of Styx
Shot out and shut down
Just a total let down
Blood boils
Bored to tears
Bottom line is it ends right here
Exit
Into the empty
I have a tongue
Like a machete
So be ready
I am
Evil on swift wings
That comes to punish all things
A whisper in a windstorm

Echoes in the trees
Voices on the leaves
That carry
Got swept up
God knows now
Got swept up and taken
I'm good as polished gold
For every reason
There's a season
Face up to the facts
Four by two I'm leaving you
Foul play
No longer fair play
It's just a reality
Four by two I'm leaving you
Face up to the facts
There's no last minute turning back
Figure the flag is down
And you're not holier than thou
I am evil on swift wings
That comes to punish all things

I am evil on swift wings
Echoes in the trees
Voices on the leaves

Come with me take my hand see what I've seen
Area  the secrets you keep they ever be told
Area  where is the proof that our leaders withhold
Why do the cover up You should see what I've seen

Through every nightshade vision one can sense
Inherent in my art is to feed thee
Perhaps the path traversed shall never grow
Yet such conjecture is naught but sorrow
The greatest seed may yet be left to sow

To ashes unfulfilled we stagger hence

Through every nightshade vision one can sense
Inherent in my art is to feed thee <start> Yeah we're gonna fight
We do it every night
Baby when you scratch

th Hexagram
Her crown is surged with a disque of the Sun
And once again rayed with fire.
Repeat Chorus IA
They observe no regular rule in the ordering of their hearts.

Chorus IV
She's the Princess of Wands
H is in the name
She's crystallizing yet
TRANSPOSING
The earthy part of Fire
She's absorbing
Between the Silence
And the th of May. <start> A thought you always feared becomes reality
What can't be undone is driving you insane
Reaching for the past to turn back the hands of time
Retracing steps you've taken a wish that can't be made
All at once your world crumbles and shatters to the ground
The hand of fate now takes its place and comes without a sound
Knowing it was just a mater of time
How could not see the signs
You hear a symphony composed of misery
There's no one else to blame
Can't change what's taken place
Feeling the disgrace
Never seeing things the same
A polished tombstone tears from livid eyes
A taunting crow overlooks this tomb
I'll rise to heights high above your dying dreams
Teaching the lessons the ones you never learned
You had a choice of paths to walk a choice of graves to dig
A burial before its time this journey ends
Wasted potential and such bitter lies
I'm left behind asking Why
Chorus
Leads Perry Dan
Chorus <start> Denial of your destiny
Your future  Your fate  I control
Denounce your past existence
Your life means nothing to you now
Enslaved by the power of fear
The torture  The pain  I unleash
Suffering at the hands of command
Mercy for you is out of reach
Brainwashed past lost
Now taught only to obey
Mind scan thought ban
All that exists is all that I say
The future you see
Is my enforced reality
Command me obey
Your mind now belongs to me <start> Temple desecration sacrilegium
Hailing the beast of pentagram
Stolen treasures from church of slaves
Performed rituals for their death
Turned cross of holy altar
Ceremonies of fire and blood
In nomine dei nostri
Satanas luciferi 
Sacrilegium
Sacrilegium
Temple desecration sacrilegium
Hailing the beast of pentagram
Stolen treasures from church of slaves
Performed rituals for their death
Spilling blood of sacrifice
Upon altar which is desecrated
Christian god it is dead
Let it be known by sacrilegium
In nomine dei nostri
Satanas luciferi excelsi <start> Uh for the two G's for the millennium
Do or Die

Ain't gon' pay no bills
Chorus
Police can't see me ballin'
Sipping on Hennesey
And I can never pay your bills
Cause I gotta keep it real real real
I got my key on the passenger side
So ain't no scrub in me me me
Police can't see me ballin'
Sipping on Hennesey
Verse 
First of all you can shut it down baby
Better yet I'm original and not a clown baby
Get down for wars an' I'm living my life under the gun
And umm stay calm no harm I'm alarming 'em
And that's the victim of the shorties in my grill
Asking me to keep it real but shorty I don't pay no bills
Do I gots the flex to get with you paint you a cold picture
See why y'all the ones got me slapping out
And all my homeboys japping out
Crapping out love that where my Crips and my Bloods at
Lords at G's at feedback need that
Niggas blaze that weed sack
I'll cop a drop wit that knees fat
Why y'all can't see me bestta believe that
Chorus
Verse 
This shit hit the back door by the way
Why you trying to play that mack for
If a nigga gotta pay a triple X hoe
Then you gotta be a hellafied nympho
Open up let some air through the window
I could never give my money to a bimbo
Real players get high off endo
Make cash like the owners of the Timbo
ChiTown real player real true love
 inch on the rims fucker says what
Bet the po' to the next thug
Recognize the queen you come to me
But you gotta see you're a whatwhat
Gotta sign then flip bitch
Hit the block I'ma rhyme in the Hummer
Better be on some platinum shit
Roley bling bling keep a gat want to snap it
Been well known to react quick
When they see I got a star they pause and they react quick
I'm immune to the hot shit nevertheless
Shitty just beware of where the hat fit
Yo pimp where the plastic
This pimp real pimp it's the pimp like a maverick
Playerism is a habit
I'm at the club wit 'um wit Crystal what what
Chorus
Verse 
Lil' baller be me can't see me

In the fivedoubleoh posed with the clothes
Dyslexic on the passenger side
Don't mean that I ain't got the keys to ride
She's the pie my my my
We done came to fuck and get gone pay no bills
Flex the mind to make the bank to bounce
Nigga bounce shit like the Dirty South
Watch that shit with a dirty mouth
Know you ain't mad ain't splurging out
But if ya heard me out on the passenger side
Care to bore me with the rest of the guys
Spitting blunts dropping jewels
Spitting at hoes that'll be cool
Johnny P

Hey dummy
do you know what you say
We are all puppets and it is the ventriloquist
We are all puppets and it is the ventriloquist
thinking is out of our reach
we repeat the shit that you teach
You are all puppets and the bible your ventriloquist
you all live inside of its bullshit mist.
I want to knock on wood wake you up wish I could
I want to knock on wood wake you up wish I could
We are all puppets and it is the ventriloquist we are all walking
around in its bullshit mist.
knock on wood wish I could wake you up
knock on wood wish I could wake you up
knock on wood wish I could
knock on wood wish I could <start> Here comes the message from the antennae
Who knows how transmissions came
I've got the license a bag of passports
Even I don't know who I am
Howling bullets fly by so often
I can't hear them buzz
I've lived in deserts I've warred on cities
I don't even know where I was where I was
Remember Israel and Korea
Kuwait's the best time I ever had
Had an accomplice who knew of nothing
I killed the best friend I had
Can't be too careful can't use computers
They're gonna catch my disease
I work alone don't trust my own mother
Scratched out like ticks and fleas
Dial double zero
Call me whenever you have got a war
Home's where the guns are
My bed's the ammo and no one comes to my door
Dial double zero
Wherever you start a war
More of me going than I've got coming
They'll squeeze my blood through the skin
I shouldn't have wasted my education
The fucking trouble I'm in
I've got your hat on I've got your suitcase
I'm you when you're gone
Out here thinking like hell
I'm never me too long
Dial double zero
Call me whenever you have got a war
Home's where the guns are
My bed's the ammo and no one comes to my door
Dial double zero
Wherever you start a war <start> Our peace
Is now in pieces
But what else would
You expect
But we're nothing
Nothing in truth
Here comes
The internal
Winter
Where innocence forgets <start> A walking sleep through the dark apple valleys
Infectious creeps in the labyrinth alleys
A deal is made every minute every hour
The thrill of the chase has long since turned sour
The drugs you take for quick satisfaction
A home to break like a nervous reaction
The melancholy truth that could make you turn pale
It once was forbidden now it's for sale
To see all the pain
To taste of the skin
To hear all the cries
We're jaded
To tie off a vein
To kill with a grin
To tell a bold faced lie
We're jaded
They pick the fruit from the branch and they sell it for cheap
The only sacred things left are the secrets we keep
t's the American dream to saturate
They want more they want it now and they will not wait
You want your sin sin sin well it's easy to find
But if you keep it up son you're bound to go blind
It's triple X every day and it's making us numb
If it keeps up like this what will we become
To see all the pain
To taste of the skin
To hear all the cries
We're jaded
To tie off a vein
To kill with a grin
To tell a bold faced lie
We're jaded
Sell me your sins
Oh so cheap
To see all the pain to see all the pain and let it in
To taste of the skin to taste of the skin begin again
To hear all the cries to hear all the cries
We're jaded
To see all the pain
To taste of the skin
To hear all the cries
We're jaded
To tie off a vein
To kill with a grin
To tell a bold faced lie
We're jaded <start> Wanna tell you a story
'Bout a woman I know
When it comes to lovin'
Oh she steals the show
She ain't exactly pretty
Ain't exactly small

You could say she got it all
Never had a woman never had a woman like you
Doin' all the things doin' all the things you do
Ain't no fairy story
Ain't no skinandbones
But you give all you got weighin' in at nineteen stone
You're a whole lotta woman
Whole lotta woman
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
You're whole lotta woman
Oh honey you can do do it to me all night long
Only one can turn only one can turn me on
All through the nighttime
Right around the clock ouh
To my surprise Rosie never stops
You're a whole lotta woman
Whole lotta woman
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
You're whole lotta woman woman
Whoah yeah
Oh yeah you're a whole lotta woman
Whole lotta woman
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
You're whole lotta woman woman
Cmon  bang your heads
Oh you're a whole lotta Rosie <start> Hearts of black mixed with dust
Burial becomes a required must
Mankind lowered into tombs of waste
Human presence taken and erased
Spirit released  bondage of earth
Exit the grave
Awake ... unearthed
Believing TRUTH thought once absurd
Gripping death certainly deterred
Demolished strongholds lay in waste
Your weakening body submits to CHRIST
Unearthed ... from the grave
Unearthed ... with acceptance of CHRIST <start> Realized under the cover of darkness
we are the dreams and they are the shadows
of doubt in a lucid mind
in a cocoon of fear
there is nothing left
but to tremble an submit
while all that could of been
lies undiscovered without meaning
what's kept in conquers
what's kept out and we'll be found dead
behind locked doors with prayerless hands
clutching useless keys
asleep forever <start> The normal man promised all things
Brought into this taken by pain
He mistook home for grave
The normal man filtered by hate
Living to pay buying what's fake
He mistook home for grave
It's not what we're made to be
So why'd he do it
I guess he just did not know
I guess we just do what we're told
The anthem cries but why listen
I guess we just do what we're told
Betrayed again betrayed again
What began as life for him was only sorrow was only shame
It's like the story of disgrace
Fraught with peril every day
So why'd he do it
I guess he just did not know
Given nothing left so lonesome
He mistook home for his grave
It's not what we're made to be
So breathe breathe breathe breathe
I guess we just do what we're told
The anthem cries but why listen
I guess we're just do what we're told
Betrayed again
What began as life for him was only sorrow was only shame
It's like the story of disgrace
Fraught with peril every day <start> Close your eyes and count to three
When you open them I'll be here
I come back like a boomerang
Like a bad penny in your purse
Bart and I will unleash hell
You will spice it with your sauce
Place and money is correct
It is time to wake the demons
Close Your eyes and pray the lord
When you finish I'll be here
I'll be gushing and spewing
Like bugs bunny and a tank in one
I'll tango in such a way
That the day will never start
Let somebody raise the curtain
We should have already begun
Wake the demons
Wake'em up
Wake the demons
Now
Close your eyes and call the monsters
When you open them we will be here
Close them back we will not vanish
Sorry We've been welded together
Even if shit was raining on our heads
We'd play in one team from now on
And now tell me the fuck
Is my shadow as drunk as I am
Close Your eyes and pray the lord
When you finish I'll be here
I'll be gushing and spewing
Like bugs bunny and a tank in one
I'll tango in such a way
That the day will never start
Let somebody raise the curtain
We should have already begun
Wake the demons
Wake'em up
Wake the demons
Now
I come back like boomerang
Don't you even try to hang yourself
Close your eyes and count to three
When you open them I'll be here
I come back like a boomerang
Like a bad penny in your purse
Bart and I will unleash hell
You will spice it with your sauce
Place and money is correct
It is time to wake the demons
Wake the demons
Wake'em up
Wake the demons
Now
I come back like boomerang
Don't you even try to hang yourself <start> Teach me your mood o patient stars.
Who climb each night the ancient sky.
Leaving on space no shade no scars no trace of age.
No fear to die.
My allegiance is with the inner self
The dark celestial voice of wisdom
Beyond the dust that is this world
There is a voice adrift in the starless
and marble black dark space
A voice of wisdom and purity
Beyond the vestiges of sanity
There is a voice deep in the darkest places
calling... haunting me...
Where no light bears a shadow
Where no time escapes unhallowed
I am compelled to dissolve
into the eternal unknown eidolon
A voice that leads to a world beyond
a mere mortal's most profound dreams
Yet I know...
There is no turning back from here
There is no place for the undeserved
Gone are the relics
Teach me your ways
Of hatred unlight and death
I offer myself to your wisdom
My allegiance is with the elite
There is a voice adrift in the darkness
calling... calling me...
A whisper of wisdom and purity
Beyond the vestiges of sanity
There is a voice deep in the starless
and marble black dark space
Where no light draws a shadow
Where no time escapes unhallowed
An effigy a gift from another kind
In the glow of a distant aurora light
No dreams shall take form
Gifts dwell in the depths of
things unspoken
this night... <start> The firmament above the horizon of history
Heathen fires burn the ancestral night
Esoteric figures move across the
Arcane plateau with their
Symbols engraved in the sky
The astral plane and the lineage of the past
Reborn
An abstract interwoven archive
Languages of the gods spoken in sidereal tongue
Divinities of the stars
Illuminate in runes of man
At the creation's hollow a sudden white light gleams
Like a wayward sentient spirit in the mire
Of space and time
Gods sire and propagate here
Under divine law of the opus magnum
Evolution of a language to come <start> Tumbling against walls of stone The frozen hand of nothingness breaks my mind Echoes fill the air Arcades filled with silence Crazed eyes follow my stars Locked in halls of solitude Exitless rooms paths without end End my pain Useless days increase the burden of time Prayin for release Stonecast faces stare at me Every day another scar I don't see summer's sun Break these chains My senses numb Dark is my tomb I don't feel autumn rain I don't see winter's snow Blind are my eyes I don't feel rising spring Burden of time <start> This is the response after the passing of a dark storm
And exhales from  headed dragons
Swinging temperature to bring fright to Fahrenheit
Can I hit your hold dog pile and leave with a razor blade smile
I can hit yo' dog pile leave with a razor blade smile
In the meanwhile bow to the profile
Heat and thunder storms up in exile in a crowd
Can I hit the stage and make 'em get buck wild
Yes you can hit the stage and make 'em get buck wild
Too late to duck now so brace up head stones raise up
Need money now 'cause pockets got space to take up
Wake up underwater with cement shoes and neck bruise
Can Bionic Jive kick it Yes we can
Can we make triple digits Yes we can
Can we make the others quit Yes we can
Can we show them how we did it Like this y'all
From city to city block to block
Come on rock on rock on

From corner to corner hood to hood
What we gonna do Turn it on turn it on

From city to city block to block
Come on rock on rock on

From corner to corner hood to hood
What we gonna do Turn it on turn it on break

Yo we popping this rocking this dropping this
In yo metropolis no stopping this in a hood near you
They copping this give me the keys because we locking this
Do we ever miss No we never miss
In fact stand back to back let the double barrel crack
Your heart no longer pity pat when I enter your chest
And exit your back emerge can you make them
Respond and break them off like that
Like this like that like this like that
We verbally gravitate them verbatim on tracks
Like that like this like that like this
We mentally mash matter make metaphors mix
Can Bionic Jive kick it Yes we can
Can we make triple digits Yes we can
Can we make the others quit Yes we can
Can we show them how we did it Like this y'all
From city to city block to block
Come on rock on rock on

From corner to corner hood to hood

The way I throw them things on 'em

 <start> Seen through these dreamless eyes
Blind buildings stark to the sky
Silhouettes as dividing walls
Guarding the eternal secret
Where is the flame to haunt you
Who do you answer to
My lies are always wishes
Lies that make me
See beyond the rationale
Accept the fate that nothing is meant to be
Be the least connected
Stay true to the last original
Apply layers to reality
Things only you can see
Add a beat to normality
To tap the core of insanity
I let my dreams cross over
To days of endless gray
If I could merge the mundane and the magic
We'd forge a new unknown
I let my dreams cross over
To nothingness and back again
If I could merge the mundane and the magic
Where is the dark I came to find
In latter days as time will find you
Memories will never let you get closer
The silent sighs in useless company
Wish for darkness and death again
In the face of ignorance and fear
I cast it right back
Some things were never there to begin with
Objectivity is truth denied
Apply layers to reality
Things only you can see
Add a beat to normality
To tap the core of insanity
I let my dreams cross over
To days of endless gray
If I could merge the mundane and the magic
We'd forge a new unknown
I let my dreams cross over
To nothingness and back again
If I could merge the mundane and the magic
Where is the dark I came to find <start> The world looks like a finger painting done with broken hands
I saw the last mantis today eat its own head and fuck itself
Into nothing into nothing I'm told that we had hands once
And we started carrying knives now we have knives instead
So even when we try to embrace we stab
Learn to lick your wounds for the taste
Learn to lick your wounds for the taste <start> Out of chaos etched inside
New way of thinking state of sublime
Renewal redemption this life is yours to form
Revalue and question abhor the common norms
New mind new life
Break away from standard thinking step outside the common norms
Break down deconstruct what's on the inside
Redesign what you dislike
Fall down when you reach the lowest point
You see the world through different eyes
Erase your old life redeem your soul
Come undone just let it grow
Don't waste it consume it convert reality
Give a life a facelift to fit your needs
New mind new life
Break away from standard thinking step outside the common norms
Break down deconstruct what's on the inside
Redesign what you dislike
Fall down when you reach the lowest point
You see the world through different eyes
This is the way it feels
Not what it used to be
Abhor common norms
Life's yours to form <start> Tired of obeying a God that always ruled like a tyrant
We decided to create our own kingdom
While being surrounded by creatures
Who pledged their allegiance eternally
We refused we rejected
We decided to have our own empire
Not based on the Book of Lies
Forever we refuse the Kingdom of Light
Eternally...
Satan's Legions None Will Ever See Them Fall... <start> Lyrics  RMS Hreidmarr  October 
Shining upon their chests
The silver seal
The bloodred penitents
Towards our land
From my window I can guess
The flames of their socalled heaven
By now I should run away
Leave the house the church the grave
And I won't do that
I open my eyes  cannot move
Their hell after tracks me down
Has finally put his hand in mine
Torture me if you want
I have learnt to suffer
And in my grave
Rained many a tear oh blessed majesties
Once more saved  nevermore
Mare tenebrarum  the red penitents
My fate divine  their worst obssession
Burn in hell you cunt 
Their eyes are burning more than their crosses <start> I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colors anymore I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes
I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a new born baby it just happens ev'ry day
I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door and it has been painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facin' up when your whole world is black
No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the settin' sun
My love will laugh with me before the mornin' comes
I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colors anymore I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes
Hmm hmm hmm
I want to see it painted painted black
Black as night black as coal
I want to see the sun blotted out from the sky
I want to see it painted painted painted painted black
Yeah <start> Take me to the top of the hill
Where the birds refuse to fly
Raise your hands to the damned sky
Is it the magic in you
In the land
this land of the dead
Raise my hands to the damned sky
Watch those twin moons collide
Take me to the top of the hill
Where the birds refuse to fly
Raise my hands to the damned sky
Watch those twin moons collide
Is it the magic in you
In the land
this land of the dead
Raise my arms to the damned sky
Watch those twin moons collide
Give it all man
Give it all
Give it time man
To learn how to die
Give it all man
Give it time
To learn to fly
Give it all man
Give it time
To learn how to die <start> Stay awake to decide
Are you coming back
Is this my sanity
I can't forgive
Oh is it the same to me
I can't take your place
I'll never see you never flee from me
Severed
Lost lies in the house I bring
I can't fucking see
I can never pull your self from me
I can't focus
Libertine my said to be
I will never save you
Wait today is not the same
Severed <start> deep inside I've been forcefed lies
and only lead astray
I've been nailed to the wheel
and left behind and only cast away
now you can never break me
never take me
the lines that crack my face are real... blind
blind... my obsession drifts away
my obsession is my blind faith
my obsession drifts away
it is only my blind faith
abuse is the name of the ghost I ride
and I'm battered and not broke in
I've survived it all and never crawled
to rise back up in the end
now you can never break me
never take me
the lines that crack my face are real... blind
blind... my obsession drifts away
my obsession is my blind faith
my obsession drifts away
it is only my blind faith <start> It' s hiding from daylight inside the eastern crypt
You have seen him and shivered with his presence
He' s a killer but yet not very unlike me
A biproduct of a dimensional journey
Vers 
Something tells me I' ve seen him somewhere before
Maybe I lost a part of myself inside the rift
Flashing fragments turned into place
Incomplete as he needs the final piece it's me you want
Chorus
Chased by a shadow
How can we possible escape
Try to keep your heads low
But he already knows my second take
Gelhein... Who is calling me by my true name
Vers 
Solo
Chorus
 <start> There are no words <start> Sleep with the one with shark teeth
and take the bite.
I saw the fin circle your boat
and I told you
you're all alone.
She's so ethereal but only
if you're on a leash.
Blindfolded by manipulation.
It's over.
You're all alone.
I don't know if I can take it.
Just face it.
You're all alone. <start> I went astray into the pleasure of her flesh god of lies you will surely understand
Scared Yeah I am scared betrayed and lost moving ahead in circles
Back and forth in pains
Untold pains as yesterday was born she was secrets and shades
But as yesterday went by a living hell
No escape from the treasures of her skin gone all lies still you will never understand
Shake Yeah shake with me my friend your destiny is sealed till her love ends
But it won't end behold The day will come and lead you astray
Between darkness and light a living sin GO <start> Lyrics by Ivar Bjrnson 
The silence inside this place is screaming
Here were the roses never wither as they never bloomed
Here the sun never shone
Even the darkness never came in
No hope no fear
An ocean of tears that never fell
Tomorrow brings remembrance of opened wounds
The light invaded the endless darkness
A soul which birth was denied
A soul that became forgotten
The darkness fades away even the brightest color
The street is empty and leads to nowhere
A shrilling scream that no one heard
Who cares We can all be free
Tomorrow is a new day
But today was new as well...
..For only thing is fear felt
The fear of life
Fallen asleep wrapped in a blood red blanket
Two dead eyes are staring into emptiness
>From a soul which birth was denied
Death greets the one life forgot
Music by Ivar Bjrnson  <start> Their voices
I writhe
Bereft of silence
My soul can't hide
I cower
No rule applies
My former masters
Now dethroned
Sounds of laughterpandemonic
Panic isthmus Sinking vessel
Vestal maggots Mackie messrs
Mesmerizing Claustrophonic
Seething untenable marriage
Worship refurledcaster
Shadowless torturous ferriage
From fancy to worldcaster
Misfortune
Unfolds
I think Your nettle
Will loose its hold
This carnage
Now best denied
No former masters
Morticide <start> Can't believe my ears  oh god what you say 
I'm hearing this every day  wait what 
Let it stop 
Hate me hate him hate everyone hate us  us as number one
Hate me hate him hate everyone hate us  us as number one
Now that time has passed
I know my own strenght
I know who I want to be
I know who I want to be
I'm so full of rage
I don't even want to get out of this cage
It just bleeds me 
it just feeds me
it just motherfucking reveals me 
whispering now that time has passedI know my own strenght I know who I want to be
hang in your gallows
we are on our own
you wanna die alone
I'm gonna cut your life in pieces
AS MY PRESSURE IN VEINS INCREASES
Now that time has passed
I know my own strenght
I know who I want to be
I know who I want to be
I'm taking back emotions
You ain't nothing
if it's worth something
shut the fuck up  <start> See another morning outside when it cries
Makes us feel that we're still alive
Clouds reveal any reason to hide and to find freshing morning outside
The Sun goes up
And my heart beats faster again
I've got to seek for warning
That every morning can be last
I'm on the way of calling
Back the days of my past
I've got to seek for warning
That every morning can be last
Mornings of my past
Life turned out to be so easy to start
Make it easy to end
When the new day means to be real
In the end I look for the morning outside
The Sun goes up
And my heart beats faster again
I've got to seek for warning
That every morning can be last
I'm on the way of calling
Back the days of my past
I've got to seek for warning
That every morning can be last
Mornings of my past... <start> Scent of  Flying Shadows
Are in the Eyes of the Vast Uranus
For these Eyes have seen
The horses of the Universe fade away
Oh Father  Fog of Nebula
Your faithful children have escaped
The Walls of Eternity
The Elders Curse
Like Snow of the Solstice of the Sun
and what the Eyes of Uranus can see
Far Yonder in the Shade of the Walls
Was happening Milleniums ago
So whatever lies Beyond the Gate
It lies in the Past
Oh We are the Hordes of Nebula
Having Travelled through an Eternal Sea of Void
We glance upon a distant light
Star in the Far Ye Mighty Sun
Will you Die before We reach you
Are you a Fatal result of the Laws of Distance
The Swords of Time are pointing at our Hearts
The grass here seems Raped
As we face Eternal Misery <start> Some mysteries will make you bleed
While other steal your sanity
Some eat out life slowly rapidly
And in us it all combines
Maybe your soul projects the purest of darkness
Some mysteries will make you bleed
While others steal your sanity
I'm in your head stirring up your soul
You're messed up well
I'll entertain you in my hell
I'll ravage and rape your soul
Pillage and plunder your mind
Stricken and shredded to pieces
But living I'll leave you behind
Pray prey
Pray for a shadow where i can't find you
Pray prey
Pray for in hell there's nowhere to run to
I'll ravage and rape your soul
Pillage and plunder your mind
Stricken and shredded to pieces
But living I'll leave you behind
Pray prey pray
Pray for a shadow where i can't find you
Pray prey pray
Pray for in hell there's nowhere to run to
I'm the demon in your head
Your soul is my domain
Let's play the game again
Hide and seek in hell
I'll ravage and rape your soul
Pillage and plunder your mind
Stricken and shredded to pieces
But dead I'll leave you behind <start> Believe it or not
The notes are trying to talk to me
I've got to applaud such valiant efforts
It's not always the party that it seems to be
It can be a complete debacle
This is not the most routine
Nine to five you see
There's some occupational hazards
Perhaps you'll try to save my spot
Just until the album drops
Then I'll be at the Capri shop
Adjacent to the Graham L stop
Believe it or not we're not the ideal guys to date
I guess I'm a risky decision
But you did not write me off you knew that I could change
I'm studying my guide to safety
Perhaps you'll try to save my spot
Just until the album drops
Then I'll be at the Capri shop
Adjacent to the Graham L stop
It's so hard to tell
It's so hard to tell
Or am I singing from obligation
When all I want is to feel my heart rate
Accelerate and we accelerate
Perhaps you'll try to save my spot
Just until the album drops
Then I'll be at the Capri shop
Adjacent to the Graham L stop <start> The gods are great I am the greatest
Mother of earth mother of all
Father of air father of all
Brother in flames
Sister of seas
Gods of my world behold...
Flame my desire
To grow and to breed
The wisdom I need
Gather in the storms asunder
Condone the cosmic hibernation
Steam of rivers the hive of oceans
Praise the father's of all significance
The reckless burden of existence
I ace the rise of the furious
The amend forces
The amend course
Gods of my world behold...
Pour rain on the fire
The fire that burns
The day of my birth
Gods of my world behold...
Flame my desire
To grow and to breed
The wisdom I need
Gather in the storms asunder
Condone the cosmic hibernation
Steam of rivers the hive of oceans
Recollection my soul connection
The thrive of reflection affection
Forever you'll be the tongue of mine
Through time and existence
By instincts divine
Forever you'll be the sight of mine
Through time and existence
By visions divine <start> The heart beneath
Heaven carries not
What the soul would reap
Growth of deception
Lined between the weeps
A thousand lusts luring in the heart
A desire in our sleep
A million lies striving to be shared
Escaping mindless leaps
What we did was set us our fear
An afterthought formed
First among fallen idols
Pandemonial storm
The heart beneath
The heart beneath
The desire to die
Scepters of scarlet
The eternal lie
The heart beneath
The heart beneath
The desire to die
Scepters of scarlet
The eternal lie
Tormented eyes perceiving relief
The shadows light won't disappear
The mist reveals the shades of grief
The heart beneath inside my fear <start> Instrumental <start> Hatred rising hatred of your kind
Reasons denied and your soul
Lies dead inside
No salvation
Dig your own grave
No salvation
Faith collapsing blind eyes for suffering
Like a cancer greatest plague ever seen
No salvation
Dig your own grave
No salvation
Enslaved

Hot like my memories
Black stone down in my pain
Dev in eyes of my tears
Blood on flowers of deads
Lost shades are sleeping in the dark
There's no wind in my face
Cemetery's the grace... the grace
See the tears in candlelight
Bleeding thoughts they're in my mind
Falling down to the ground
In the garden of souls
It's the triumph of the death
November thorns hurt me... <start> Many years ago today something grew
inside of your mother...
That thing was you
YOU

Did she scream did she cry
Only those that are born are the ones that
Get to die
One more year closer to dying
Rotting organs ripping grinding
Biological discordance
Birthday equals self abhorrence
Years keep passing aging always
Mutate into vapid slugs
Doctor gives a new perscription
Bullet in a fucking gun
One more year closer to dying
Plastic surgeons fuel the lying
You forget why you came in here
Your mind rots with every New Year

You have little time
And you're running out of life
Happy Birthday
You're gonna die
Now you're old and full of hatred
Take a pill to masturbatred

Because they will become that thing
One more year of further suffering
There's no point of fucking bluffing
Open up your DETHDAY present
It's a box of fucking nothing

I'm so blessed
That I have eyes to see such a treasure

I cannot imagine
To not see you one more time
I'd miss your smile
I'd miss your eyes
So I thank the fates that I'm not blind
Mystica I believe you
Will you believe me
Even when empowered
By the graceful light of a Nubian dawn
When I turn to meet your gaze
I know that you are the one
That you are the one
Who can comfort me and ease me
From idle misery help to...
Take me away to your world of blissful dreams...
Release me release me from pain

That I have eyes to see such a treasure
As is you
Mystica I believe you
Will you believe me <start> Stay...keeps me on my feet makes my heart beat.
When you're born w pain it always remains. no matter
How your life changes it never fades. if I could cry until
The world stops turning. to give me some time to think.
My insides are still burning.
What the fuck is wrong with me I got a ticking time
Bomb in me. block your teardrops. stop...lock your handle.
The world don't stop boy. the world won't stand still.
What the fuck is wrong w me I got a ticking time bomb in
Me. Happiness is gone from me. will I be who I think
I should be nothing's ever as good as it seems. nothing's
Ever as good as it seems. no.
Ticktocktickticktock. ticktickingticking.
What the fuck is wrong w me there's a ticking time bomb
In me. happiness is gone from me. chasing those perfect
Dreams. what the fuck is wrong w me got a ticking time
Bomb in me. nothing's ever as good as it seems. nothing's
Ever as good as it seems. <start> something so cold it moves closer in my dreams
what if it finds me dont't let them find me
it chokes me when it all turns cold inside
is it you... please talk to me
CHORUS
premonitions cut like broken glass
who'se behind the door if there's nothing there
night is breathing and steals my sleep
quietly tells about a haven six feet deep
a one step away a one step behind
what if they find me i know they'll find me
i can tell it now something's not right
when it feels i'm not alone
is it you... speak to me
elusive hopes leave the earth and you
seems like dreams were always so futile <start> Some are born to sweet delight
Some are born to endless night
So pale and lifeless
What you're doing to me
I'm doing to myself
I close the iris to the sun
It once was open soon its gone
Soon it's gone
Soon it's gone
So pale and lifeless
What you're doing to me
I'm doing to myself <start> Retreat
This river mustn't take us both
This river mustn't take us both
had to had brother
one by one <start> Here in a deadly maze there is something hiding in the dark
In clouded minds where hate and anger collide
I spiral into a grand illusion in a world of reality beyond
Then the secret of my inner self will reveal
I see tears in your eyes
I sense weakness inside
I will take you far away
To the deepest of your dreams
Let me in on your stream
To the entrance of your deep
I watched in disbelief
Imprisoned in a deadly maze
The enemy rise from within
Risking their lives on a dangerous search
With conspiracy in mind
Taste the hate within
Human weakness
A solution to the mystery
With conspiracy in mind
Now hear my warning
All you sinners on the porch
Sweet relief from the pain of longing
Remember this twisting smile
Unspeakable anguish
Heaven's out of reach
When mother nature will surely
Descend and sleep for eternity
Please release the weight
That lies on my shoulders
Please release the weight
That lies on my shoulders
I spiral into a grand illusion
In a world of reality beyond
I see tears in your eyes
Always out of reach
I want to sleep for eternity
I see tears in your eyes
I sense weakness inside
I will take you far away
To the deepest of your dreams
Let me in on your stream
To the entrance of your deep
I watched in disbelief
Imprisoned in a deadly maze
The enemy rise from within
Risking their lives on a dangerous search
With conspiracy in mind
Taste the hate within
Human weakness
A solution to the mystery
With conspiracy in mind <start> I can't look behind because I'm living in the past
Tears without emotion are filling up the unbridled hours
We cannot be
What you expect from us
We cannot see through the glasses of despair
Evade the leaden legacy
Those who separate and join the opposite
do not see that that will get them nowhere
Can't you understand it is a similar manipulation
Wake up and see the light
Doomed to wander in repressed emotions
This imaginary refuge restrains me from awakening
Fear of penance
Doomed to sycophancy
Doomed to sycophancy... <start> Pain
Ride it baby. 
Cracks his brain
Just enough to buy lots of gibberish
 <start> Why do you have a cloud in your eye
Walked downstairs
Got my hat and my corny brown leather jacket
Streets were grey and clean for a change
Must have been the rain
Thought transference
And this man in digs with me would spit out
two or three teeth a night on the floor
Winter is here unlike yourself
Cold pulled my shirt up
Service
Kicked the leaves
Learning about time
Time of the vulperines
Time of the wolverines
They sit rotting the leaves
Kick the brown branches it is here
I came home and found I could say the word entrepreneur
and my problem began service

At my feet one who laughs at anything.
And at my head one that laughs at nothing
And I'm just inbetween
This day's portion service


Winter is here
I've got a witch on my left shoulder
My future's here
Now I will kick the broken branches
They're this day's portion of this day's portion
Didn't want to wake up and learn
I've learnt the word 'entrepreneur
Wandered around found out
Didn't want to say the word roll it around in your mouth
Every man jack wants to be what he is not.
Service.
Little boys are taking over
They mumble through the grass
There are not fit to be in the company of vulperines and wolverines
Too many heads knocking about.
Service.
This day's portion this day's portion.
Why do you have a cloud in your eye from infotainment <start> What they have in store for them...
...do I desire...
They will suffer just as I...
...revenge on the whore.
Take the eyes take the head
Leave them all for dead.
My hands are cold...
...my heart... is colder still
I will take the bitch tonight...
The children are well.
The gentle man... the whore in in debt...
They are blind as they say
Turn round three times
And catch whom you may.
May comes and goes in the dark of the night.
He kisses and whores and gives them a fright.
...and the Doctors will get all the blame
But it's only May playing his dirty game.
...ha ha...
Rip the bitch wide...
...left my mark...
...had a got at her eyes.
The pain that night...
...burnt into my mind.
...recall... to stop my cries.
...ha ha...
...when I cut her...
Kissed... for a while.
...shale I write and tell them...
...peace of mind.
Left her for dead...
There was thrill.
All whores... feel the... shining knife
Sir Jim with the shining knife.
I give my name that all know of me
So history do tell...
...a gentle man born... <start> Someone Else to Dig

Lyrics Freya
You can't stop crying
 well that's too bad
You won't stop whining
 it drives me mad
You're not my friend  I'm sorry
Though you pretend so bad to be
You're letting me in
where I don't belong
Tell too many secrets ...
Find someone else to dig
Find someone else but me cause
I can't take it
Find someone else to dig
Find someone else but me cause this is wasted
You call me up to fill me in
You say you don't know
where to begin
Well how about you stop talking
How about you start listening
You're letting me in where
I don't belong
Tell too many secrets ...
Find someone else to dig
Find someone else but me cause I can't take it
Find someone else to dig
Find someone else but me cause this is wasted
I hardly met you but I know
everything everything about you
Cause everything
everything is out there ...
Find someone else to dig
Find someone else but me cause
I can't take it
Find someone else to dig
Find someone else but me cause this is wasted
Find someone else to dig
Find someone else but me cause
I can't take it
Find someone else to dig
Find someone else but me cause this is wasted <start> instrumental <start> We walked in the cold air
Freezing breath on a window pane
Lying and waiting
A man in the dark in a picture frame
So mystic and soulful
A voice reaching out in a piercing cry
It stays with you until
The feeling has gone only you and I
It means nothing to me
This means nothing to me
Oh Vienna
The music is weaving
Haunting notes pizzicato strings
The rhythm is calling
Alone in the night as the daylight brings
A cool empty silence
The warmth of your hand and a cold grey sky
It fades to the distance
The image has gone only you and I
It means nothing to me
This means nothing to me
Oh Vienna <start> There's no turning back
Back out of life
Life's adversity
A grotesque contradiction
Drowning in hope
Hope gets distorted
Distorted mental state
Feel the pain of life
I hold in contempt
Those without thoughts
A stupid kind of happyness
Not aware of what's to come
Scarce moment of joy
To good to be true
Feelings lighten up
Who will take it away
Thinking you've got friends
Feeling good inside
Comparative moments
Of joy will fade away
Gaining feelings
It feels so good inside
Comparative moments of joy
Will be taken away
People surrounding me
Don't understand my ways
Forcing myself into depression
Going through a mental hell
Bust up my own mind
Comparative moment of joy
Has been taken away
Time after time
Things seem so different
Don't grow attached to people
They'll take it all away <start> I drink the blood
From cup of death
I sip the milk from tied up
Angels holy breasts
I fuck the whore and eat her flesh
And when the daylight comes
I sleep in Satan's nest
Pestilence Black Death
Circles drawn in blood
Read the holy writings backwards
Burn the house of God
Sacrifice of human flesh
Anal kiss of Hell
Mother of Satanic child
Cast your witches spells
Witchcraft
I run the night with white wolfs pack
I ride the wind of Mayhem
Down to Hell and back
I masturbate on Golden throne
And quench my thirst
From sacred virgins fragile throats
Pestilence Black Death
Circles drawn in blood
Read the holy writings backwards
Burn the house of God
Sacrifice of human flesh
Anal kiss of Hell
Mother of Satanic child
Cast your witches spells

Pestilence Black Death
Circles drawn in blood

victims. A
smell of decay covers the world the rising veil of death is everywhere.

you will come with the coat of kindness. You will brandish the sharp

ignorance and cruelty. <start> In my youth I took a trip
My first initial acid trip
And it hit me like a ton of bricks
My eyes they quickly dialated
I began hallucinating
At the tender age of seventeen
As I watched the tv
My dog speaking to me
Telling me I'm going insane
I recall a scene it's halloween
And I am dressed as a drag queen
Peaking to the point of no return
I met a man I shook his hand
He spoke I could not understand
He was covered with flies and afterbirth
The  were singing
The bees they were stinging
As pink flamingos  on the ground
I am the witness
I am the 
I am the elephant man
These are strange things
Beautifully 

Doing it and dropping out
Dancing  twist and shout
 atomic braced this level
Resurrects the power head
Cherishing the subtleties
Illusion is reality
Swimming the electric potion
 were set in motion
Our  perform autopsies
On  cavaties
Frontal lobe labotomies
Electric shock to chimpanzees
This cause of sorrow is desire
Eagles  selfish fire
Illusion is reality

The  were singing
The bees they were stinging
As pink flamingos  on the ground
Visions oh clearly
Are 
The God by 
I am the witness
I am the 
I am the elephant man
These are strange things
Beautifully 
 <start> Fused duodenum to esophagus
Inert maze of digestive tract
Visceralabdominal Uturn
Diarrhea of the mouth
Broken capillaries and tissue
Combined with bile hemorrhoids and feces
Microscopic amoeba singlecelled juggernaut
Regurgitation of shit and disease
You are what you eat
You are what you shit
You are what you vomit <start> Innocence inscribed in this crudeness of rites
Wounds worn by the heretics of light
Creation of hellbound life
Thrill of this inversion
Majesty of leviathan
Ambitious within hell
Faultered with endless worship of neglect
Renounce this life in pain
Transform this intense selfallegiance with marks of descent
Seen through eyes of blasphemy
This soul will become one with the blade
This wake in testimonial acceptance of life's end
I am the doorway that opens unto the path of darkness
Drowning skin with ancient beliefs of selfless deceit
The hour of death is at hand
The sixth lock is opened
Engage this justice with streams of lifeless reject
This internal embrace within the confines of blood
Winds of stench upon this plain of the righteous
Whispering into the ears of deaf perversions
These chains of the undivine held by the right hand of the devil
To achieve this revelation of the self mutilated
The day that calls for mercy is denied with scorn of hate
Voices fall within the ghost of all memory
Engulf this lost soul in downfall of personal faith
Attained in violence
Eternal
Prodigy of the four will be unleashed
Through arteries of agony's reign
Malevolence is endured within cycles of written resurrection
These wounds vomit the vital fluid that will raise the curse of blasphemy
The air filled lungs of this offering are inhaled by carrion
Extraction in bleeding this loss
A scar that remains nameless is forged
Nocturnal in binding with this descent
Exchanging of fluid with hate
These channels of life now fade
Dead young from Judea will rise
Invoking this crudeness
This mark of Lucifer
Grasp of achieving
This comfort of entrance to hell
Seething blade savior
In this kiss of failure
Sinking below
Restraint of dark walls so I am confined <start> Elisabetha Elisabetha
This is the tale of the Blood Countess of Transylvania
 years old she realized her true ambitions inflicting pain
Soon carnal desires called for their fulfillment
Black magic was the key
After becoming romantically involved with a blackclad stranger
Her mouth showed telltale signs of blood for the first time.
Come to me my sweet young gal
I need your service for my joy
Follow me to your little hell
Nothing to scare or annoy
Come through this gate
See my toys they are your fate
Welcome to my torture chamber
This will be your dismember
I'll take the liquid out of you
Your virgin blood will be mine
Black Magic is what I master
My Darkness is that what will shine
My beauty will stop to face
For my ointment you are the source
The shriveled skin will disappear
My beauty returns with my force
Elisabetha you are the countries course
Your cruelty is divine of calls upon the gods
My curse is that I can't kill you
You will be prisoned for eternity.
You trapped me in this rotting cage
My blood burns for revenge
I'll bring your pain to another stage
I'll raise myself to your bench
You won't flee my magic grip
Your heart will be what I rip
I'll grab your spirit out of you
Annihilation that's what I'll do
I'll take the liquid out of you
Your virgin blood will be mine
Black Magic is what I master
My Darkness is that what will shine
My beauty will stop to face
For my ointment you are the source
The shriveled skin will disappear
My beauty returns with my force <start> The program is always on the fucking screen
Robot pilots destroy the buildings
Burning bodies jump out the windows
The suicidal terrorist is the new idol
Mental Terror Action
Is the new infection
Mental Terror Action
Created illusion
Processing..
That program is to die
By your own hands
That program is to fight
Against yourself
Let me offer my most humble obeisance
To the Supreme Lord of Destruction
Never been on the fucking Moon
Never define the speed of light
Atom bomb into the fucking assholes
So many questions I haven't mentioned
The program is shining on the fucking screen
To be the slave of false ideologies
Better to believe in the antigod
And watch everything from the inverted side
Mental Terror Action... <start> Break out inside of me
Hold it inside of me
Break out inside of me till I'm dead
Hoping reality finds me some sanity
Break out inside of me till I'm dead
I take a walk outside to remind myself I'm not the only one living in this hell
I know I'll probably need some help cause I can't take it
I walk a couple of blocks to the liquor store I know I've been down this path before
Lost so many friends to addiction but I still can't shake it
Should I pray to a god that I don't see should I fake a smile when you all see me knowing if you knew the real me you'd drown me out like jason
And I can't seem to love myself I guess staring at the ugly I possess
Hoping you'll forgive me for the mess I'm finally at peace
Noone could save me I'm finally at peace noone could save me
Couldn't take it
In my time alone oh then I find this fear visions of your face slowly disappear
You don't know you killed me do you
You don't know I die just to spite you
I waited by the phone my vision is not so clear this poison calls my soul
I really wish you were here but it seems like all I am just fades away
Fades away
Ashamed now the sinners talk with each other walk with one another
Now drug out the needles two sided people please come together
Can we find a reason for peace this evening Oh I'm crying mother
We're blinded for a reason it's called fighting demons let's conquer ourselves first
Not harm one another kill one another choke one another
No more crying mothers don't take our brothers we war with each other
It's such a saddening thing to see we can't trust one another
And if you see what I do see then you know why we suffer <start> Are you with them or against'
The masses begging for revenge
Some wimps they prefer staying neutral 
Til they come to their house
Time's up make a stand and choose your side
Are you a Man or a mouse Man or mouse
Are you'
Are you a Man or a mouse Man or mouse
Now show some courage and claim your rights
well my true colours are black and white
Too late to come ask for protection 
when they've burnt down your house
Stand up for yourself and tell me now

Dream long dead <start> From out of space we came on to the earth
From far away on solar beams
A dying race to find survival here
For our kind to plant our seeds
Our analysis of the atmosphere
Was good and so we touched the ground
A rising simple structured life form there
Seemed to be perfect what we'd found
We think in anger of our fallin dream
Our home is now a fading light
The cracks appeared and they where pointing at the end
And so we came to save our lives
Men Martians and Machines
You were too young to understand our plans
To see the things up in the sky
We were the gods and we have tought you well
And so we fond eternal life
We gained control upon our destiny
Our ships were flying everywhere
The cracks appeared our plan was bound to fall again
And now the circle's closing in
Men Martians and Machines
 Solos Both  Kai 
We can't control our human sacrifice
Again we fear for our lives
The cracks appeared our brains start to distort again
Now we gonna say goodbye
Men Martians and Machines <start> Don't touch me I don't wanna feel your skin.
I know that you're only gonna hurt me.
I hear you I don't wanna do it again
'Cause we both know this is not a passing trait
All along a failure to connect and to compromise.
Right or wrong its easy to react.
Time to realize.

And you keep talking but we both know it's not true.
I still know that you're wrong.
And no matter what we both had to go through
I just can't I can't hold on.
I can't hold on

How far we've fallen in the road before us leagues apart.
And you keep talking but we both know it's not true.
I still know 
That you're wrong .
And no matter what we both had to go through
I just can't I can't hold on.
And when you asked if I believed and I told you
Strength of it 
Made me strong .
But I can't feel a thing that I used to
And I can't I can't hold on.

And you keep talking but we both know it's not true.
I still know 
That you're wrong .
And no matter what we both had to go through.
I just can't I can't hold on .
And when you asked if I believed and I told you
Strength of it
Made me strong .
But I can't feel a thing that I used to
And I can't I can't hold on. <start> Summer feels like death
Godless we run
In my eyes there dreams an ocean
Hell beneath my tongue
I understand
And don't care
Well the skyscrapers look like gravestones
From out here
Throwback
With blood in my cum
In my heart the song plays on
The Insects Requiem
I understand
And don't care
'Cause the skyscrapers look like gravestones
From out here
Pissing your life as fast as they consume you
Killing everything as fast as they can bleed you
Pissing your life as fast as they consume you
Killing everything as fast as they can bleed you
Throwback
With blood in my cum
In my eyes there dreams an ocean
Hell beneath my tongue
I understand
And don't care
Well the skyscrapers look like gravestones
From out here
From out here
From out here
From out here <start> Tied and nailed piece of flesh
Tormented new object
Incision merciless
Scientific bloodshed
Christ pose looks grotesque
Martyrized innocent
Novelty dismemberment
Insensible and decadent
Chorus
Crucified  pay for our vanity
Crucified  urge our insanity
Crucified  die for humanity
Crucified
Deep cut into life
Scalpel murder knife
Consciously reviled
Instrument of spite
No release end delayed
Sadism the human way
Constant slow decay
Running red life slips away
chorus
Scapegoat bleeding thing
Provoked suffering
Senseless inhumane
Another life is spent in vain
Tied and nailed and ripped apart
Work is done morbid art
Painful death so absurd
Cries of pain were never heard
chorus <start> instrumental <start> Garden of delight
Depth of my sight
Garden of delight
Blood of my stare
Eternal desires...
Eternal desires...
Garden of delight
Humilation of my words
Elevation of thoughts
On the pedestal of beauty
Eternal desires...
Eternal desires...
Forgotten millenium
God's negation
Forgotten millenium
God's negation
In my kingdom
The winds
Only announce
The forgotten mystery <start> When the moonchild is crying
And silence has broken
The darkest truth
The things she remembered
Had never been her own
Replicant or human
I know the way to show
What do I see
What will I find
Know the answer inside
It's your last step
Time what is time
I wish I knew how to tell You why
It hurts to know
Aren't we machines
Time what is time
Unlock the door
And see the truth
Then time is time again
Whispering
These dreams were never mine
It's cold inside
It's gone forever
The things he saw
Who can say what's wrong or right
The vision of a free life
His eyes had seen it all
For what
He's asking
The vision vision vision
I know it's all a lie
I'll remember his past life
And I'll remember time
What did I see
What have I done
God I knew the answers
When he felt so tired
Time what is time
Come lock the door don't let me in
I am the one Your destiny
Time what is time
Reality  It hurts me so
When time is time again
Look into my eyes
Feel the fear just for a while
I'm a replicant and I love to live
Is it all over now
Only these years
I'll leave but I'm singing
Time what is time
He saw it clearly it's too late
It does not heal but it lets us forget
Time what is time
We'll never know
So don't take care
Then time is time again
Should I forget
The way I feel
God he knows how long I tried
Feel there is no reason to cry
I live my life
In fortune dreams forever <start> Exhausted beyond repair
Stripped of all I had
Forced to die inside
Forced to die
Now I breathe a renewed Life
I is now I see without my eyes
Remind me of my need for You
If this is what it takes
To bring me to my knees
Then feed me pain until
I realize I am but a slave
Remind me of my need for You
Remind me of who I am <start> Sometimes I wish I could just sew up my eyes So I don't have to witness and realize the monster that has become of me
There's something wrong with the fatal attraction
For every action there's an opposite reaction
It's like a trip to the brain trip to the brain that drives me fuckin'
I'm fuckin'insane fuckin' insane fuickin' insane
Straighthate  You're just a pawn in the game so fuck you
Straighthate  You're just a pawn in the game so fuck you
To me there is nothing but a diluted state of reality 'Cause hell has fuckin' frozen over for me
And from my knees I beg and plead for salvation
I will kick and scream with broken teeth until damnation
It's like a trip to the brain trip to the brain that drives me fuckin'
I'm fuckin' insane fuckin' insane fuckin' insane
Straighthate  You're just a pawn in the game so fuck you
Straighthate  You're just a pawn in the game so fuck off
You're just a pawn in the game so fuck you
Come revolution I'm down for the kill
Fingers on triggers to be used at will
Pledge your allegiance and die for the cause the cause
As we rise red white and blessed blue
Straighthate  You're just a pawn in the game so fuck you
Straighthate  You're just a pawn in the game so fuck you
There's something wrong with the fatal attraction
For every action there's an opposite reaction
It's like a trip to the brain that drives me fuckin'
I'm fuckin'insane fuckin' insane fuickin' insane
Pledge allegiance
You better go
Walk away you never had a chance anyway
You walk away you never had a fucking chance anyway <start> 
Imaginations running wild
Innocent they seem
Polluting your mind
A formulated scheme
The battle it start in your mind
A lesson to be learned
Provoking thoughts only cause the sin
That provoking thoughts have earned
Cast down imaginations of every high thing
That dare exalts itself against the knowledge of God
The weapons of our warfare
Powerful they are
No nuclear warfare attacks can bring these strongholds down
To take dominion over Satan's own ground
Rise up with the sword of god and put your armor on
And the weapons of our warfare aren't carnal
Imaginations running wild
Innocent they seem
They've polluted your mind
The formulated scheme
The battle it started in your mind
A lesson to be learned
Provoking thoughts only caused the sin
That provoking thoughts have earned
Cast down imaginations of every high thing
That dare exalts itself against the knowledge of God <start> We take on the world wherever we go. Nothing will stop us that is our
oath. All of the evil beneath crawling up from below. We will deliver
defeat we won't take anymore. Marching forever we go but we want to
go higher. Follow us straight down the road and into the fire
With infinite malice we shatter the night and then we destroy in the
name of what's right. Under our flickering glow like a beacon we shine.
The fallen will cower in fear to our all seeing eye
Chorus
The frequency that we invoke is your purifier
Listen your life in danger. Fortune and fame don't make them a stranger.
Follow you heart and you're laughing at danger. Run to your dreams and go <start> From the bottom of the pit
of nightmares she will come
From the dungeons of insanity
to haunt the wicked mind
A crooked finger points
a spell is cast words can kill
A weaver of the web of tears
a daughter of the dark
Oh the moon is so cold
See the grace of her presence
Giving you the poisoned apple
beauty or beast
Dancing naked in the rain
with eyes that cannot see
Calling demons that have not spoken
In a thousand years
Old sad eyes of wisdom tell of dreams
we can't reach
When the moon is so cold
When the air breathes of evil
And the black skies will burn
See her shadow is rising
The dying illusion
The loss of a friend
The dying illusion
Please come back again
The hideous smile of the devils
child will tease you t  believe
A forbidding shape witch or virgin
Over a sinister moon
Fatal grace that blinds and binds
Assaults and astounds
From the cradle of eternity
to the fears of modern man <start> Music Webster
Lyrics Webster
I am lost and sickened
Disoriented by this bleak environment
How I came to be here escapes my memory
This is a desert deep scarlet grains
Stretch the horizon and the sickly brown sky
Gale force winds pepper my face
The sand tastes foul
the sand tastes like blood
Savagely cruel barren expanse the atmosphere
a caustic fog
Every breath reminds me of pain
Dust of dried blood filling my lungs
On the horizon I see a chasm a distant pulse
begins to beat
Lead  Owen
Suddenly a flash specter of the past
Vision of mass murder torrents of blood
The vision quickly ends
the wasteland still beckons
Plodding toward the chasm
I hear rushing liquid
My mind cannot conceive
the massacre I behold
An infinite river of cadavers
buoyant in their own blood
Vertigo engulfs my brain as
my body fails and drops
Lead  Barrett
A million corpses staring
Straining to survive
limbs flailing in the blood
Grapple with headless bodies
Hands of the dead are pulling me downward
Drowning in this river
Intestines are alive like tentacles they choke
Situation hopeless
I submit to the fury of the river
Paralyzed with terror
Thousands of their thoughts
are entering my mind
Conscious on their level
Every tortured death is experienced at once
Drowning in their anguish
Ordeal of their deaths now saturates my brain
Vengeful corpses shrieking
Genocide genocide genocide genocide <start> Break my heart tear it apart
And spit me in my eye
Confuse my head treat me for dead
And fill me your lies
You don't have to know your lines very well
You don't have to lie the best
Just act at your class just be an ass
A cunt among the rest
I couldn't care less
You don't move me
If you want to roll around in shit
Just like the rest
I don't give a damn
I don't even give a fuck

One is stronger I've read somewhere
You bet your ass it's true
Make sure to love yourself
'Cause no one will ever love you
You've got to treat yourself
Like the number one just to survive
Or else you'll go a sorry one
While choking on their lies
Take my advice
It's better than their lies
Man's best friend is still a greasy hand
You don't give a fuck
You don't even give a damn
I don't give a fuck Repeat x <start> Welcome to my realm
We are both condemned to live
It's a dark fate

The eternal life
I see it still burns
Each night I cry in pain
Alive
Though the end appears my friend
And blood tears I cry
You've searched and you've found
Cut off your old friends hand
My mind's
In frozen dreams
The rotten flesh
Of bitter lies
Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one ever will
Can't hold it
It burns
Each night I cry in pain
And blood tears I cry
Endless grief remained inside
And blood tears I cry
Endless grief remained inside
It seems so clearly
Bent the bow
Cause life in me is gone
And a cruel wind's blowing cold
And a cruel wind's blowing cold
In blame
And life it shall wane
Each night I cry in pain
And blood tears I cry
Endless grief remained inside
Cut off your old friends hand <start> Music and Lyrics by Carl Michael Bellman

Eternal fire burns your flesh your soul is what I take
That's my proof that I don't care about your weak opinion
You had your choice of life or death now enter my dominion
Apparently evil destructive and mean
I rise from the coffin to spread hate supreme
When darkness sets in and night comes to town
My sweet reign of terror in your blood I drown
Embraced by evil when night sets in
They wake my sleeping memories haunting nightmare
Pain extreme the souls of night inside my dreams to see
Apparently evil vicious and bad I'm sipping your blood until the last drop
No life left to save no heaven to praise no dreams left to chase just brutal embraced
Embraced by evil you're destined to see
The glance of my deceiving eyes extrication from the chains unseen
Devitalized embraced by evil minds
Cold eyes delirious mind the evil messiah in me
Afterlife I cross your soul deep down to set you free
Cry out purged from your sins beyond retrieval
Lay down feel the relief embraced by evil
Pale skin and severed nerves forever no pain I will feel
Undead life no heart to beat enemies forced to kneel
Lay down and feel my touch there's no retrieval
Give up I grip your soul embraced by evil <start> Into the sky into the blood drenched skies...his soul flew away to rally the deathhordes up in heaven....
And wherever his soul may go his words shall bring blood and honor...
Hunt down the unworthy and the traitors soon it will come the year of the crow... who will save you now from the sins of your fathers while the deathhordes prepare
For the final battle....hail.....to the battlesky.....hail.....the year of the crow...and while cold winds of death penetrate the enemies hordesglorious are they
Who ride these winds... for they truly are the rulers of the battlefields....demonic crow will be unleashed and will spread her wings like a plague.... it's the blood sent
From the heavens and you still make the sign of the cross you devils... hunt down the unworthy and the traitors.... soon it will come
The year of the crow... for they truly are the rulers of the battlefields... or did they really expect to reap love while the seed is torture
And pain.... hail to the battleskies hail mankind condemned to die in the year of the crow... <start> Shortcut to Alchemist Lyrics

Full Alchemist Lyrics... <start> Blaming global infection
For the illness in him
Little knowledge of the nonaffection
Between him and his kin
Old grey bitter anxious and collapsed
Like a wallflower once blooming
Withered to apparent death
Apparently he had no reason
To harbour the trust
He'd forsaken inside.
Apparently he left his reasons
Forsaken the trust
That harboured within
Blaming the guilt
Crying the tears
Torture the pain
Leaving the emptiness behind
Walk I cannot walk
For I am blind blinded I am
By the pitch of dark so dark is it
The narrow street never ending narrow
Clogs my throat
Silently I try
Try to walk blinded by the pitch
The narrow darkness clogs the street
I am speechless
I am speechless
Fear puts a rush on my steps
As I stare into the spinning depth
The end is not near the sight that I am hoping for
And all the light that paves the way for me
Is the wish and will for the end to see
The bright light is the end of the black light district <start> Dark clouds and thuderstorms in the fires and flames were born
Through darkness travelling on the night
Hellfires and rain will fall time is coming for us all
Our journey for the guiding light
Firelight it is burning so bring in the dark of the night
As we fight for the glory tonight there's nowhere to hide
On the wings of your destiny brings all the power you crave
Carefull now if not you then who else will we save
Lost in this world a total stranger
Death by the sword a common danger
You know that everything is not what it seems
March on all night forever searching
Daylight ahead is only lurking
Break through the walls and use the power of your dreams
Once in a lifetime take a chance at the right time the dgolory you see
Rise up for the time of your life
Now the time has come for you to be free
In minds of society we all live in harmony
Truth is that we all die in vain
You stand for what you believe
I kill for what I concieve
Is there then a title for this game
Far way in the wastelands of hell full of torment and pain
Demon knights riding over the heights where fallen are slain
Violent fury of firestorming death now no life will prevail
Now you live all your days in the fires of hell
Lost in this world a total stranger
Death by the sword a common danger
You know that everything is not what it seems
March on all night forever searching
Daylight ahead is only lurking
Break through the walls and use the power of your dreams
Once in a lifetime take a chance at the right time the glory to see... <start> There wouldn't be good without the vil
No wisdom without stupid people
Would there be fear if we could be immortal
Welcome to the opposition portal
Don't we all hate the adjustment we make
Is to compromise for a safe life a mistake
Musical destruction is our outbreak
Metal discharge
Payback to all those losers
The armies of black will dictate
Metal discharge
All those years of torment
In a society that I do hate
Metal discharge
Pay...
Metal discharge
The opposition against all odds
Unbreakable longhaired noise loving squads
The non conform metal power station
Grows slosly through nation and nation
Once greeted with smiles
'Cause of outrageous lifestyles
Our breed wil resist all fake trends
Until this sad world ends
Caal it culture of the brainsick
Our press ignored music
This cultural essence of noise
Keeps us watchful not to turn into toys <start> I'm amazed at how you reinforce your guard cause
Deep inside you're still a son of a bitch
Mistakes forever haunt you
A lie to persecute you
So thoroughly it's giving you fits
It's giving you fits
In your world make believe
No one loves you
Hold your breath
Count to ten
Bare hands to a vacant
Glass
That nothing can hope to ever fill
When movement ceases and
Everything is still
I thought that time was frozen
Instead my resting state
I thought we'd be forever
What was I to say
Oh You were never alone
You just didn't know
Where to fucking go
But who will hear you fall
If no one's there at all
Do you 
Feel fine 
Do you 
Feel fine 
Do you
Feel fine
Do you
Feel fine
Do you wake up smiling
I'm amazed at how you reinforce your guard cause
Deep inside you're still a son of a bitch
Mistakes forever haunt you
A lie to persecute you
So thoroughly it's giving you fits it's giving you fits
Giving you fits
Giving you
Fits
Giving you fits giving you fits giving you fits giving you fits
I gave you everything you wanted
You were everything to me
I gave you everything you wanted
And you were everything to me
I gave you everything you wanted you were everything to me
I gave you everything you wanted you were everything to me
I gave you everything you wanted you were everything to me
I gave you everything you wanted you were everything to me
I gave you everything you wanted you were everything to me
I gave you everything you wanted you were everything to me
I gave you everything you wanted you were everything to me
I gave you everything you wanted you were everything to me
I gave you everything you wanted you were everything to me
I gave you
In your world make believe
In your world no one loves you <start> Here come the riders of the revolution
Their blood is flowing in the pouring rain
Tonight there's gonna be an execution
Another hungry king will end
Oh all your dreams will fall when the quest will end
We'll rise from the ashes and wait for the call
Against the masters
And we cry for deliverance
We hold the world in our hands
And come the dawn the future is ours
Sealed with our blood in the sand
It's a strange world a never ending circle
Oh such a strange world a never ending circle
Talke to me my holy friend
Why they kiss the killing hand
I fall to understand
No more and this is the end
Strike with iron will time to feed the overkill
Blood flows everywhere now the time of hell is here
No more time to waste all I feel is burning rage in me
I win you lose you've got nothing to say
You die I live get down and pray
It's time to kill we strike with iron will
Here come the riders of the revolution
We fight to live and we can not forgive
Here come the riders of the revolution
Oh yeah it's a never ending circle
Oh it's a strange world a never ending circle
Oh yeah it's a strange world a never ending circle
Oh such a strange world a never ending circle
Here come the riders of the revolution
Another rider crying revolution ... oh yeah <start> Run through the hills screaming murder
You can't escape what you can't see
We live in Murderous Times.
Run through their house with avengence
You know what they'll get
Consequence was the last thing on my mind.
Cause you will pay
With your lives
You'll fucking die
DIE
You better watch out
Cause you will pay
Vengence is mine
Im calling you out
Yeah you will pay
Vengence is mine
You ran through that house with avengence
You hold no regrets
Consequence was the last thing on my mind
Cause you will pay
With your lives
You'll fucking die
DIE
You better watch out
Cause you will pay
Vengence is mine
Im calling you out
Yeah you will pay
Vengence is mine
You Better Watch Out
Im Calling You Out
And Knocking You Out
In this moment
The life slips from you
And i cant figure out just what we both fight for
I TEAR OUT YOUR HEART AND I THROW IT AWAY
You learned the hard way
When your smashed into pieces and spread out all over the floor
MURDERER YOU MURDERER.
You can't run and you can't hide out
These are the murderous times
Dont look back cause you will fall down
These are the murderous times.
TO BE
In this moment
The life slips from you
And i cant figure out just what we both fight for
I TEAR OUT YOUR HEART  CRUSH IT AND THROW IT AWAY
You learned the hard way
When your smashed into pieces and spread out all over the floor <start> Oh why can't I be what you need
A new improved version of me
But I'm nothing so good no I'm nothing
Just bones a lonely ghost burning down songs
Of violence of love and of sorrow
I beg for just one more tomorrow
Where you hold me down fold me in
Deep deep deep in the heart of your sins
I break in two over you
I break in two and each piece of me dies
And only you can give the breath of life
But you don't see me you don't
Here I'm pinned between darkness and light
Bleached and blinded by these nights
Where I'm tossing and tortured 'til dawn
By you visions of you then you're gone
The shock bleeds the red from my face
When I hear someone's taken my place
How could love be so thoughtless so cruel
When all all that I did was for you
I break in two over you
I break in two and each piece of me dies
And only you can give the breath of life
But you don't see me you don't
I break in two over you
I break in two and each piece of me dies
And only you can give the breath of life
But you don't see me you don't
I break in two over you
I break in two over you over you
I break in two
I would break in two for you
Now you see me
Now you don't
Now you need me
Now you don't <start> I've waited and given the chance again
I'd do it all the same but either way
I'm always outplayed up on your down days
I left it the right way to start again
Now watch me rise up and leave
All the ashes you made out of me
When you said that we were wrong life goes on
Just look how long I've agreed
Just look how long I've agreed
Out of place like a gem on a coalface
Lost on the right way it's all the same
'Cause I've had my hopes raised riding the wrong waves
Scared when you feel safe to start again
Now watch me rise up and leave
All the ashes you made out of me
When you said that we were wrong life goes on just look how wrong I could be
Now watch me rise up and leave
All the ashes you made out of me
When you said that we were wrong life goes on you blew me away
Away
Away
Away
Now watch me rise up and leave
All the ashes you made out of me
When you said that we were wrong life goes on just look how wrong I could be
Now watch me rise up and leave
All the ashes you made out of me
When you said that we were wrong life goes on you blew me away
Away
Away
Away
I sink like a stone I lost my control
I sink like a stone I lost my control
I sink like a stone I lost my control <start> Bonded in leather
Pumping blood through my veins
Sweet virgins sacrificed
Screaming with pain
Drifting through night air
Life's so insane
Dark scattered figures
Shooting steel thru my brains
Taken by force showing ni mercy
Taken by force lay your life on the line
Taken by force your life's so dirty
Taken by force save your soul while there's time
Living a nightlife
Life's living low
Low hearted beasts
Leaving tracks in the snow
Numbers are searching
Searching the light
Just to be crushed
In the dark of the night
Taken by force showing ni mercy
Taken by force lay your life on the line
Taken by force your life's so dirty
Taken by force save your soul while there's time
Shattered and hopeless
You've poisoned your mind
Cast of your worries
You'll leave'em behind
Drowning in sorrows
Tomorrow's not seen
Never know where you're going
Or cared where you've been...
Taken by force showing ni mercy
Taken by force lay your life on the line
Taken by force your life's so dirty
Taken by force save your soul while there's time <start> So typical so ritual
My sweetest memories lost in time.
Twisted and forgotten I'm searching for what everyone seems to find.
So typical so ritual.
Twisted and forgotten I'm searching for what everyone seems to find.
The past is the present and the future's just more absence.
I'm body without blood.
I'm digging a grave just for one.
This is a heart without a pulse and my inner demons won.
Somehow I knew I'd never see that second life.
Somehow I knew I'd die empty inside.
I should have been a liar because I've got a lot to hide.
I should have ate your heart because I can't feel mine.
I should have been a liar because I've got a lot to hide.
I should have ate your heart because I can't feel mine.
I should have ate your heart because I can't feel mine.
The next time we meet you'll have to tell my heart to beat.
The next time we meet you'll have to tell me to breath.
Sewing your mouth shut I promise this is better for both of us.
No more tasting the past in the back of my throat just a coffin full of lies and a preacher spewing one sick joke.
So typical so ritual.
Twisted and forgotten I'm searching for what everyone seems to find.
I should have ate your heart because I can't feel mine.
I should have ate your heart. <start> Third world squalor inhuman conditions.
Death stalks the have nots through depravation.
Open sewers polluted water monoxide consumes the air.
Crowded into shanty structures. Born into a nightmare.
Starvation and execution. Starvation and execution.
Scavenging in garbage piles emaciated malnourished.
Most turn away from those below
pleading for sustenance. The horrors children suffer below poverty.
Sickness fear and ignorance all needlessly.
Starvation and execution. Starvation and execution.
Lives that deserve a chance written off as useless.
Police death squads.
Disappearances. Shots in the night hidden graves
their victim's only inheritance. Discarded humanity surrounds discarded
humanity. Starvation and execution. Starvation and execution.
The murdered slaved or stole for crumbs or drugs to deaden constant hunger. <start> I see invaders comin'
Runnin' over the hill
No time to sound a warning
The night is still
Hide away the parents
The band is on
Smoke is slowly rising
The youth are one
Crash the gates
Necks will break
Now they're comin' after you
Shout with rage
Rush the stage
And there's nothing you can do
Shout it out
Shout it out  We love it loud
Shout it out
Shout it out
I sense inebiation
The hordes are ready
Fists are quickly rising
The chants are steady
Stand to greet the heroes
Move your heads
Inject metal infection
Let it spread
Crash the gates
Necks will break
Now they're comin' after you
Shout with rage
Rush the stage
And there's nothing you can do
Shout it out
Shout it out  We love it loud
Shout it out
Shout it out
I see invaders comin'
Runnin' over the hill
No time to sound a warning
The night is still
Hide away the parents
The band is on
Smoke is slowly rising
The youth are one
Crash the gates
Necks will break
Now they're comin' after you
Shout with rage
Rush the stage
And there's nothing you can do
Shout it out
Shout it out  We love it loud
Shout it out
Shout it out  Ah
Shout it out
Shout it out
Shout it out
Shout it out

the day before your parents met
unwanted hungry and abused

baby satan is a little brat
a vile being in his habitat
he was born with horns and a crooked spine
to plague the sacred and divine
into another burning hell
falls an angel from the sky
cursed from birth
until the day that he dies
you must be the devil
because ive always loved you so
baby satan
you've got the devil in your eyes
souls of the damned
are in the palms of the street lights
baby satan is a little brat

BABY SATAN <start> Born and raised under daddy's protective wings
Sheltered from all the ugly things in life
But didn't daddy tell you
There are places where you don't belong
Executive seats
In charge of my life
Music industry
And if he did
Why didn't you listen
So you could have spared us
the unpleasant experience
of ever meeting you.
Promises broken
Money never seen
Your pockets never deep enough
Always crying for more
Cause you're lying stealing cheating
Your not on top of the world
How could we ever fall for your shit
I guess you shouldn't believe
What you just can't see
If I had a penny for every lie
I would gladly pay just to watch you die
Top of the world
Lying Stealing Cheating Fucking us over
If I had a penny for every lie
I would gladly pay just to watch you die
I want to watch you die
Top of the world <start> I see demons with red glowing eyes
doors I've never seen before
their coming up the stairs out of hell
beyond the iron wall
sell me your soul and be my slave
whispers in my ears
in the moonlight shadow dance
black birds spread their wings
now here I am
coming to you and
offer my soul
standing on the hill of secrets
listening to the voice in me
calling evil is so easy
now the master speaks to me
welcome my son I'm watching you
trembling and hoping for my favor
it's a one way ticket to hell
trapped in fire and pain
now here I am
coming to you and
offer my soul
standing on the hill of secrets
listen to the voice in me
calling evil is so easy
now the master speaks to me <start> Driven onwards
Past the point of no return
Into the unknown
Of lessons never learnt
Their names  immortal
Remembered evermore
In memory of glory
Forever fallen
Standing proud
Battles raging all around
Fading past
The revelations abound
Anger predominates the mind
Gathering all strength
Tenacity is found
Honour now forgotten
Fear lost inside
Despair no longer
At all wasted life
Their names  immortal
Remembered evermore
In memory of glory
Forever fallen
Now forgotten  all thoughts of years gone by
Fallen forever  forever fallen
Life denied <start> Where words lose their power
Dissappear  There music starts.
The whole new form it gives me
Calls me up  Above reality...
I'm opening strange new worlds
Carried by the hands of destiny
Which take me up beyond the time...
Where awareness and dreams become the same
Beyond the start and the end
Messages signs and the magic
In the air  The vision starts.
The notes are playing
Games of fantasy  Maze of a genius. <start> If I have been kept alive for one reason
It's to declare that apart from you I can do nothing
Though discouraged by my failure
I remember who I used to be
Like a murderer transformed into a pretty thief
I have so far so far left to go
From shapeless to breakable I have involved. From shapeless to breakable
I have evolved
My transgressions are evident to all who know me
Like porcelain carried through a Downtown street
At any moment I might break
From shapeless to breakable I have evolved
I could say a thousand more apologies
But to prove that I have truly changed
Only time will tell <start> Written by  skinacecassr.france
Lost in time I can't count the words
I said when I thought they went unheard
All of those harsh thoughts so unkind
'cos I wanted you
And now I sit here I'm all alone
So here sits a bloody mess tears fly home
A circle of angels deep in war
'cos I wanted you
Chorus
Weak as I am no tears for you
Weak as I am no tears for you
Deep as I am I'm no one's fool
Weak as I am
And what am I now but loves last home
I'm all of the soft words I once owned
If I opened my heart there'd be no space for air
'cos I wanted for you
With this tainted soul
In this weak young heart
Am I too much for you
Repeat chorus till fade <start> All I need is a lady
With more than average size
She's gotta be a bit crazy
Won't take no compromise
If she can fill a D cup
It's good enough to keep me up
Get you down on your backside
I want to see your wares
Gonna mount you for a good ride
Nothing else compares
Takin' one into each hand
Do as I command
Doin' the ButterBust Jerky
We're gonna get down and dirty
Doin' the ButterBust Jerky
And makin' me feel so good
Dip your fingers in the butter
Spread it all across your chest
In between one another
You know what I like best
Push 'em close together
The tighter the better <start> Everything you know is a fucking lie that is spreading upon me
and you wont ever try to find the truth that lies within
We are a genertation built upon ideals
We are a generation built upon beliefs
Fuck You I'm Edge
I wont ever let you bring me down
Fuck You I'm edge
I dont owe you a fucking thing
Fuck You I'm Edge
I wont ever let you bring me down
Fuck You I'm Edge
I dont owe you a fucking thing <start> So many times in the past
I have been hearing
This word I don't understand
What is The Matrix
The quest is over today
'Cause the answer
Came right to me in the shape
Of Morpheus
Bridge 
Tell me what should I do
To get freedom of mind
For it's better to die for the truth
Than to live in a lie
I can't believe what I see
Is this the real world
Can I be their chosen one
To end this evil
About the Matrix I had
This revelation
The only limit is my
Imagination
Bridge 
Maybe I'm not the one
I don't think he is right
But I won't let my friend die for me
Not without any fight

Matrix
Now I know and I'm not afraid
For a new world is starting today
Matrix
Now the secret has been unveiled
I'm the one who will ease all the pain

Chorus <start> Seeds planted by misinformation blossom into patriots and servants whose perception of soil and cloth is equal to that of the blood and skin of their martyred counterparts. Pledges and ceremonies celebrate murderers and their actions generating respect for violence and breeding traditions of disfigured heros and slaves of states and countries. The freedom achieved when others die is imprisonment by the rags that symbolize flags of glory. Rags symbolize nothing. <start> music Dennis

Sleeping in the night it hears a sound
It gets up to take a look around
It finds there's no one there
It falls into a Black tears nightmare
Darkness surrounding hells breaking loose
Tries to get out but its no use
Faster and faster it starts to turn
Better slow down or it will burn
Schizophrenia passes into the mind
Thinking that it will painfully die
Clasping and grasping for a breath
It learns that it is near death
 <start> In a bad land
Thirsty for water
Ruled by thorns and weeds
Hard like stone
Dry like a desert
Brought by the wind
A little seed germinates
The beautiful flower of blood
It was born
Destroying all evil
Creating life
Giving fruit
The wind of the spirit
Holy Spirit
The seed of love
Was born in my heart
The beautiful flower of blood <start> Recorded February . Released on album Blood Fire Death October 
Intro piece no words <start> Life may have mercy but I've none
You can never guess what hell is like
Not a sea of fire...
Nor you'll find chains of ice...
But the word of God is unknown there
Nothing is what it seems
The dismal truth is so hard to face
You're just living in a dream  fear the awakening...
Now enter my castle of pain
Cross the path of sorrow and fear
There'll be no light until your soul ignites
'Til your soul ignites
Realise the truth...
I am the lord upon the nightsky
And I'll never serve in heaven
'Cause I rule in hell
But I am still dreaming
Unsilent... <start> Stab it or grab it
Instant the burning
Of choices you make
Follow prophetic turnings
Stinging the eyes
Out of every option
Go with the flow
A hideout notion
Would you dare to look hate in the eye
Kill yourself from within while living outside
Strong will sedated
Grow weak and decapitated
Selfinflicted fall
Twisting the future 'round your neck
By being a winner
Where losing is all
I'm the trendkiller
All out wrecking mindthriller
I'm the trendkiller
Onetrack speeding spinechiller
Embittered follower
Drink and keep on die for others <start> you've stumbled in now fortified
now taste the hate where worlds collide
breathing in your life subsides
knowing that your hands are tied... rage

Things happen but we don't really know why
If it's supposed to be like this
Why do most of us ignore the chance to miss
Oh yeah
Torn apart at the seams of my dreams turn to tears
I'm not feelin' this situation
Run away try to find that safe place you can hide
It's the best place to be when you're feeling like
Me

Yeah

All these things I hate revolve around
Me

Yeah

Just back off before I snap
Once more you tell those lies to me
Why can't you just be straight up with honesty

When you say those things in my ear
Why do you always tell me what you wanna hear

Oh yeah

Wear your heart on your sleeve make things hard to believe
I'm not feelin' this situation
Run away try to find that safe place you can hide
It's the best place to be when you're feeling like
Me

Yeah

All these things I hate revolve around

Yeah

Just back off before I snap
And you'll see

All these things I hate revolve around

Torn apart of the seams of my dreams turn to tears

Just back off before I snap <start> Talkin bout drama
I met a young brother how young about eight
He seemed intelligent and rather quite straight
I greeted him and struck a conversation
To see if the youngster had some selfmotivation
Peace brother what's your name and how ya be
He said I be soon coming off the currency
I said gettin paid he said yeah like my man's brother
Who has a condo he shares with his baby's mother
He said a condo beats my apartment
With no lights and no gas and much backed up rent
No hot water or heat and invaded by plenty rats
That'll eat up the average alleycat
He said yeeahhhh boyyyeee that's poverty
I said word I know and it bothers me
'cause we are the victims of a situation
How wicked man seperated
A nation and got us coldkillin off one another

It's getting hot how hot hotter than july
'cause the murder and crime rate is rising very high
For example in my neighborhood it's so hot
I'm often woke up from the alarming sound of a shot
So I'm thinking what is my neighborhood a trap
Could this be the place marked x on the map
Now I'm spotted like a target in the shooting gallery
So I start to seek for a better salary
So I can escape from where from this ghetto life area
Cause everyday you're getting scarier
blam blam and scarier and scarier
Causing mass hysteria it's drama
Talkin bout drama
Not to be bold and disrespect the homeless
'cause I can see that they suffer from a long list
From not having shelter and out on the street
Without a job and days without a bite to eat
Yo I feel for those but here's another side
About some more people that's living on the outside
Because of the fact that they chose the wrong way
And it took em on a trip for a long day
Got to the point you started stealing from your house
Stalking the rooms late at night like a mouse
Your family's upset and you've got to go
When it's five below and we're expecting snow
And then you're on the train with a cup in your hand
Kicking dirt and making it look like sand
Then after you run that game for a while
You start sucking up tokens from out the turnstile
Are you that desperate just to get a hit
Is it so effective that you won't quit and yo
Why do you come to me crying the blues
About you can't get a job well go sell some street news
Then you can get straight and be real
But you'd rather rob and steal
And that's drama
Talkin bout drama
Not wonderama
But I'm talkin bout drama
Here what I'm sayin
I'm not talkin bout your mama
Nahhhh but I'm talkin bout drama
Shaolin fist versus the llama
Talkin bout drama <start> All along it was me who changed.
Morning now waits for me.
What I have to gain does not matter
If what I give is all to You.
I have seen the stars full
And the sun rise again
But You are yet to change.
You are all that is worth living for. <start> The workers all march to the beat of the drum
Their spirits are broken
They have nowhere to run
They dream of courage and a loaded gun
But the slaves all know
They better bite their tongue
Track marks across the planet
Are there any veins left for them to infect
They would kill one another just to disconnect
Three cheers for desperation
God bless the Godforsaken
We will arm them to the teeth
To fight to fight the war on peace
All love is lost so carry the cross
'Cause there's no human in us left
We are music made for the deaf
They play a game that they know they'll never win
Sick and tired of the world they're living in
The messiah showed up high on heroin
On heroin
The workers all march to the beat of the drum
They fell into the trap taken one by one
The medicine is poison but it makes them numb
'Cause all that they feel is pain and regret
Existence is just something they would rather forget
Three cheers for desperation
God bless the Godforsaken
We will arm them to the teeth
To fight to fight the war on peace
All love is lost so carry the cross
'Cause there's no human in us left
We are music made for the deaf
They play a game that they know they'll never win
Sick and tired of the world they're living in
The messiah showed up high on heroin
On heroin
Is this freedom
Is this the life you chose
If this is living the dream we've hit an alltime low
All love is lost so carry the cross
'Cause there's no human in us left
We are music made for the deaf
They play a game that they know they'll never win
Sick and tired of the world they're living in
The messiah showed up high on heroin
On heroin <start> A flat planet in the centre of the universe.
Who punctured us
Who thrust the needle into our flesh
Geocentrism came crawling back  licking the needle marks 
Copernicus was never right and our world turned as
introvert as our minds.
Kepler Copernicus  Galilei suffocating in the vacuum of
the microcosms.
The inside can wait as long as we're preoccupied with
shining the facade.
We brought this upon ourselves  the connection breach.
We cut the rope we shut the power down.
The line does not reach out any more.
Diagonal traded for horizontal  there is no up and down.
Gathered trapped closed into a linear thought.
Kepler Copernicus  Galilei suffocating in the vacuum of
the microcosms.
The inside can wait as long as we're preoccupied with
shining the facade.
Somehow we lost the ancient connection.
All perspective eaten by newborn abilities.
Entangled no more  Simplicity the order of absent
relations.
Complexity a distant relative or a strange rumour.
Reflective surfaces mirroring skin cores diminish slowly
and silently.
Nourishment torn away light dimmed to the unrecognizable.
Show us your universe and we'll give you our world  we do
not recognize it anyway <start> The days lean against
One another
And glide slowly into slippers
Of gathering darkness
Eve walks with velvet tread
Towards my orchard
Sinks in the tarn within me
A motion in the corner of my eye
Someone's heart beating time with mine
Your heart glows through your skin
Your heart expands and contracts
Your smile in my hair
Your laughter all in me
You're travelling through my veins
Florid embrace
Strawberry mouth
I'm filled to the edges with you <start> What's the secret of the unity 
Is this magic or some alchemy 
Who holds the fire that burns inside our being 
It could be you or it could be fears.
Balance is not easy to keep 
One world one movement could ruin it all.
If you don't get yourself a grip
Then you will fall in a hole 
Don't you know that you're a part of me
Don't you know that I can set you free 
Even though it's not easy to see
We have the same dreams.
Your power and mine will be melting into one
Together as one we will reach a new horizon.
Try to understand
And we'll shape diamonds from the sands.
Try to understand
And we'll build a world in a no man's land.
Try to realize I see trough your eyes
And if you were blind I would read your mind.
Reach the melting point it's time to make the joint
Change your heart so cold
From stone to gold.
Don't you know that you're part of me 
Don't you know that you can set me free 
Maybe it was just our destiny
To share the same dream.
Your power and mine will be melting into one
Together as one we will reach a new horizon.
We're not really the same but we're playing the same game
The perfect reunion to reach a new horizon...
We're like the wind th fire the water the stone
Different elements fusing in one 
We unleash a power that create a sun 
And we will spread our rays.
All for one one for all  <start> blood
you open the door
to
into the bride's room
it's
the secret it's decay
born
from fleshe's deepest need
rose upon my altar  im the rose on your altar
until two fades into one and one is death god
as my fingers run through your thighs  I feel your fingers in my thighs
smearing my seed over blood over death  smear your seed over me
at midnight rutting bride
reaching for blooms beyond the veil
tell you my secret
god died for fleshes need
please come you shivering bride
the devil must feast for lust of the dead
lust slashes hate
immaculation of dreams
born from blood crying red
can your hear the strike of azraels' wings
as your man I'm gonna take you
I'll possess you entirely
musti so gods will cut your throat
my dove and drink your blood
and your twitching foaming death
suck your entrails
your bashful modesty
your cries build a coffin of laughter and lust
beneath my bleeding hands...
rose on my altar
until two fades into one and one is me
god <start> I'm seeing the parts in me
that which I hate to see
suffer the shadows
suffer the shadows
The child inside weep for my life
for such bitter twisted dreams
the fool by her side could never see lies
any economy of truth he believed
Blind to compassion
I shall suffer the shadows in my past
depressed and saddened
I shall pay my debt to nature
The mother insode feels my sadness and pain
in this growing pool of desire
the father by her side could never have cared
cold blooded he lived as a liar <start> Surrendering my laments
I remember the deep inner strength in you
I'm in sensual ecstacy
So deep are the feelings born
That they last forever
As we made love in mist shrouded nights
I vow I was in heaven with you
I'm in sensual ecstacy
So deep are these absolute feelings for you
I'm deep into you and we'll last forever
Inside my heart beats at one with yours
In bless recalled and so soon returned
Are love's proud memories of you
I'm in sensual ecstacy
So deep are these deep rooted feelings of love
Love for you
That they last forever
So far now my conscience has flown
With you love I'm never alone
Far away from you but I remember you
Far away from you but I still feel you <start> Your conniving words
Are childishly insane
To get what you want
You'll say anything
In your mind
You lust to control me
You lust
For control
Chorus
Mold me fold me
Mold me fold me
My pain is your pleasure
My agony excites you
Desperate for a change
But change comes within
I'm not staying
Not around you
I'm stronger than you think
Much stronger than you
Chorus
Molding and folding
Lusting for control
Longing to control
Those without esteem
Ignorant pawns
Of your pathetic dreams
Dying to control
Those without esteem
Ignorant pawns
Of your pathetic dreams
Molding and folding
Lusting for control
Hatred is a tool
Thoughtlessly you use
Ruin an only friend
With misleading rules
Contain your own rage
Give yourself praise
'Cause you have no shame
With your callous game
Chorus <start> I feel the wetness oh her tongue
That slides across my skin
The viruses crawl over me
And feel for some way in
Cut you with my cock Cassie likes it in her hand
Cassies dead inside I came to fuck the open wound
So hold it open wide
Cassie loves to swallow this bleeding will it stop
I left Cassie hollow cut you with my cock
Take me into the ocean
Lay me out on her shore
Wake me when the sun burns out
And we'll run forever more
We're all gonna die tomorrow
The freaks are screaming burn it down
She can't feel the weather
I can't touch the ground
Pale and twitching twisting to the cold dance
Watching the room grow old a funeral romance
Somewhere someone's screaming that the worlds gone
Smear me with your blood and let these dead boy play their grave songs
Slide across the warm red floor to meet me
Lock the bathroom door before they crawl to eat me
Cut her throat and whisper that we're going home
Twitching to the cold dance they suck the meat from her bones <start> Everybody's telling me to listen up
They're trying to run my life for me
I'm gonna terror call 'em
Their term's up

They've just given me their
Last orders 
Everyone's in prison or in the army
All sincere all phoney
Reading all the books taking in the news

I don't dig their deadend options
I'm not hurt by their rejections
I'm no sellout and they've found out

Everybody's telling me to listen up
They're trying to write my life story
Jobs jokes are in it
It's the end of the rap
 <start> Burn
Arisen by a silver sword
That lost its battle shine.
As I walk into the gate
I left that world behind.
My father wakes me with his calls
Rotten vile human pride

With fire rival the earth shall die

 a thousand times
I was tempted by the fire
And with fire I shall depart.

Always breathe and
Feeling the tears
Arisen in my father's womb
Life sustain me for his might



No one can ever imagine
 embrace the earth and sky
But you are drowning in fire
Through our invisible heart
I am Immortal
I cannot die
So help me Father
Your heart heir is mine.
Repeat x
Tears run down my closing eyes
And all that fire burning inside
And  waits for the next to go.
Hear me my beloved son
I can not teach you
Any further
A new Aeon
Has began
Your the next to rise The Earth's Son <start> Now as the days are coming so much shorter
Your journey is slowly reaching the end
Cold wind reminds you of me
As you crawl on this frozen soil
Life filled with hate
I am leaving the scars that make you bleed
The bloodred tears
Now coldness reaches your flesh
And frost creeps into your soul
Again I drift to my past life so fake so wrong
I am the creation of lies what you told
And I'm feeding the pain I never search for
Life filled with hate
I am leaving the scars that make you bleed
The bloodred tears
You start to sound like a broken enemy
enemyenemy
As the last leaf floats on the soil <start> Carry on you must feel that you have something to die for.

Fuck you all
This prophecy unfolding
We have no time to wait
The world is dead and rotting
A lifeless tomb remains
We have no compassion
Hate runs through our veins
Faceless and abandoned
We can not be saved
Rise above this waste
A reformation spreads across
This earth all consuming
No return we are the resurrected
Strong with hate we kill the ones
That keep us down
With the body we embrace what
Pleasure gives no god wants us
Penetrate so deep inside your twisted
Flesh weak and worthless
Terrified how you tremble at the
Sight of me you can not know
What I am I fucking laugh and
Watch you bleed
No expression no compassion
Born to kill
My instinct is your end hell awaits
Feel your life slip away
Start to pray
No one hears no one cares
No one lives
Watch and wait the embodiment
Of hate burns inside
No one is left alive revenge
Karma kills revenge
Causeeffect... Revenge life to death
One by one they all will fall when I
Get the fucks I'll crucify them all
Take the best motherfucker they got
Kick him in the face and hang him out to rot
I want you to die and no motherfucker
Should have to question why
Your lives not worth fuck
Just grab another bitch
And bust another nut
Why can't you fucking go and die
Your life's worth less than my shit
God can't help you pretentious fuck
Pools of red at my feet
Flesh with flesh meat on meat
No fucker in this world
I call my friend
The bitches and sluts are fucking dead
Another fucker's talking shit again
A bullet in the head 
Fuck you all eat my shit
I remain throughout time
Pure with hate I cross all lines
They can't remember I won't forget
The fallen and forgotten
Forever laid to rest
You won't be the last fucking one
To challenge my hate
Your weakness is just what I need
To terminate
Kill and fucking rape
Fuckers hit the dust
When they fuck with us
Kill fuck maim tear fuck you all
I don't care <start> Medb You said you would always be there
You said you would always care
You said you would always be there
You said you would always care
I was nadve and I was wrong
To you I do not belong
Ailill Say what you want to say
You always try to have your way
I try to say that things in life are different.
If this is how you feel in your heart
Then I don't want to be a part
In anything you say I won't listen.
Your love redeems my pain
But I don't want to feel the shame
You've tried to pierce my heart
And you've succeeded.
We know now it could never be
What we once had was ecstacy
I can't pretend my soul is not bleeding. <start> One moment never told that I have seen nobility
My life's been molded
By that which was demonstrated for me
I'll not deny the truth
Of right and wrong set forth for me
If I am half of this my simple pride will be released
Never believed deceived by the foolish
The weak embody lies
Here in lies the heart of this truth
I know now what it's worth
A second chance at this
Or reason to justify this gift
A simple talk or two would let me feel more at ease
Six feet an earthen home in silence
The circle incomplete <start> THE WATCHER IN STONE
...And I stand enthralled and silent atop the ancient
shadowed mountain gazing in awe at the stygian
nightcloaked sky as above me a wondrous flight of ebon
dragons soar on vast wings blacker than the darkling
heavens... Mayhap I behold the personal wardragons of none
other than the mysterious and legendary Ophidian King
himself majestically riding the night winds to the glorious
field of some great and epic battle... By the gods a more
fearsomely splendid sight in this world there cannot <start> Music Mikael Dahl  Lyrics Andreas Gtesson
It's the birthday of the Emperor
The cream of the realm is here
kings and queens with sons and daughters
It's truly a most grandiose ball
nobles fill the halls
Like sheep ready for slaughter
Pre Chorus
Oh with rising hate I watch them dance
I watch them prance
Oh how I loathe these haughty swine
I'll rid the world of this living grime
Chorus
Peasants are saying oh not without glee
there's an aristocrat out on a killing spree
A noble thirsty for royal blood they say
The Beast in Velvet I'm called by my prey
Though my fee is great indeed
I'd do this for free
'cause I enjoy my work immensely
Pre Chorus
Chorus
Bridge 
With wit and grace I charm these fools
who think they're out of harm's way
None here's aware of my sins
But then again who'd suspect a highborn prince
Solo Both Dahl Both
Bridge 
It's been so easy to lure my prey
so to my Lord I gratefully pray
as my victim dies by my blade
Shape shifting is a useful trick in my dark trade
Chorus <start> Never had a desire to live
Never had to love and believe
Never thought that you are so cruel
Never had my mind so cool
Never shared my wisdom before
Never got all I've looked for
Never lost the life harmony
Never been but I wanted to be
The ocean of your eyes
I wander around your shore of life
And see there dying people
They ask my night to share with them forever...oh never
Never shown my sympathy
Never loved my enemies
Never heard fabulous sounds
Never let somebody down
Never played fanciful games
Never stood under the rain
Never charmed my destiny
Never been but I wanted to be
The ocean of your eyes
I wander around your shore of life
And see there dying people
They ask my night to share with them forever...oh never
The waves of your ocean held me here
I have to choose to live or to die
Birds fly above the waves of fear
They disappear every night <start> The honeymoons over and the loves gone sour
Her nagging has got you down
But you picked the wrong way to deal with it
You chose to slap her around
When you exchanged your wedding vows
Nobody said you may now fist the bride
Now that the little woman went and got her gun
The love ain't all that died
Chorus
Jealousy
She knows you can't live without it
The bullet's speed
Cutting right through all your bullshit
Wedded bliss
Began for her when the bullet's hit
Sixteen rounds in case she missed
Sealed with a fist
When she took your hand in marriage
It didn't mean right across the face
Small woman big man it takes a lot of guts
You're just a pussy in the first place
But now that your wedding chamber's
The one the bullet's in
Brave man look at you not so tough
When the hammer's cockin'
Chorus
The little woman had all the shit that she could take
Her intuition said lock and load
Heman what's your plan to get out of this
She's gonna fill your ass with bullet holes
Guess who's bigger when she's squeezing the trigger
I got news it isn't you
When they carry your body out over the threshold
You'll wish you never said I do
Chorus <start> Trapped inside
A dead nightmare
Buried deep
Suffocation
Frantically scratching for light
The oxygen is getting thin
Just a matter of time
Before the air runs out
You're doomed
Try to fight it's what I like
Suffocation
It's what I like
Buried by
A servant of the ancient one
Soil seeps through the cracks
Split kneecaps nails bent back
They're broken
Just a matter of time
Before the air runs out
You're doomed
Try to fight it's what I like
Trapped inside
A dead nightmare
Buried deep
Suffocation
Frantically scratching for light
The oxygen is getting thin
The air is getting getting thin
Three minute crawlspace
The air is getting getting thin
Three minute crawlspace <start> You're looking for something
But what could it be
You look for a hero
Well don't look at me
You look for solutions
But there's none you can find
You believe in something
That's only in your mind
You're looking around you
But hate has made you blind
And you've spent the last ten years of your life
In this emergency
So please don't just sit there
Let's try to break out
From all the hatred
Suspicion and doubt
Try to change your life
That is no life at all
Try to break down the imaginary wall
And if you couldn't be bothered
Well then my friend you'll fall
And spend all the rest of your life
In this emergency <start> drivin'fast my cortina

my astral entity finds its way
a cosmic cede to the worlds of paths astray
Behind stellar veils I search
but what I search I do not know
let me see the light of guidance
onto where I me seeds shall sow
Falling stars gently touch my mind
as they leave fragments of light
which a lit the worlds to find
But this light is soon to fade
extinguished by a loathsome breeze
though in me there is a light
that shall never cease <start> Red blowing out of ass and mouth
Let the dog die alone <start> Get a hotel today.
Go get a hotel today.
Go get a hotel today.
Before the idea slips away
Get a hotel.
Go get a hotel today.
That was the first question raised
There was a question raised.
Get a hotel
Want to get in
Want to get in
But this is not the place to bring it up
Go get a hotel today
Go get a hotel today
Before the bike siren calls
Times running
Like butter dissolving
Times running time dissolving
Times running melting
Times running passing
Its running passing.
Get a hotel today
Go get a hotel today
She says get a hotel
Ne'er do well
Get a hotel
Get a hotel
Before the bike siren calls
And the horn siren yells
It says
Get a hotel
Get a hotel
You better
Go get a hotel today
Go get a hotel today
Times running
Times running passing
Times running
Times running
It's running it's passing
Like butter melting
Times running passing it's running passing
Like flesh cut melting
It's running it's passing times running it's passing dissolving
I was eating gravel when two cars put in.
I was eating gravel when two cars put in.
Headlights dousing
Broken warehouse
I just got out
Dirt inhaled
The cinders told me
Ya shoulda got a hotel.
Go get a hotel today.
Go get a hotel today.
Before the bike siren calls.
And the bloodcurdlers yell.
Go get a hotel today.
All thugs use the Burton ploy
The Lord acts
Around my appeal.
He says get a hotel.
Shoulda
Go get a hotel today.
Get a hotel.
A little voice yells
Should of got a hotel.
Get a hotel.
Go a hotel today.
Get a hotel
Get a hotel. <start> Spit in my face
Humiliate my dignity
But I'm feeling great
To me this is normality
I try to think straight
Is this really my worth
My heart gets in the way
And it keeps saying it doesn't hurt
Chaos
Blaming myself
For the things that you call me
For the ways you act
And how sick is that
I try to think straight
Of something else than rebirth
My heart gets in the way
And seriously it hurts
What you're going through
It is real to you
But your mind plus your heart makes two
Look into my eyes
What do you see
I'm someone who can show empathy
When your mind's clouded by your heart
It's not easy to see what's real n' what's not
I give you my empathy
Before you start judging
Try hard to see the person I am
I'm caring I'm humble and understanding
I ask for your empathy
To think of me as friendly
To escape this reality
I will need your empathy
What you're going through
It is real to you
But you mind plus your heart makes two
Look into my eyes
What do you see
I'm someone who can show empathy
When your mind's clouded by your heart
It's not easy to see what's real n' what's not
I give you my empathy
My empathy
I give you my empathy
Oh Oh Oh...
Look into my eyes
What do you see
I'm someone who can show empathy
When your mind's clouded by your heart
It's not easy to see what's real n' what's not
I give you my empathy
My empathy
I give you my empathy
Oh Oh Oh... <start> You are here in my heart
Why won't you see me
I can't hate you
I trusted you
You lied to me betrayed me
How could you make me choose
Between us and you
And then you treated me like an enemy
Then one day you cut me out
Erased me from your life
It was like you have died
But I still see you
I was your friend
Some friend you turned out to be
I wish I had never befriended you
And now you talk down about me
Trying to change me into someone else
To erase your guilt <start> Try to stab me motherfucker. You can't hit what you can't see. All these lights are blinding me. Let's go. Let's do it you sack of shit. Try to kill me motherfucker. You can't hit what you can't see. All these lights are blinding me. Hits like rocks only harder. Tried to drown in an inch of water. You can't hit me. You can't fucking touch me. Way up high looking down. I can see almost everything. Say goodbye. This could be the last thing you ever see. Like rocks like knives pushed in thorn in my side. We're bending back the gates of hell to ride. They moved this city walls piece by piece. Every brick and nail laid at the gates of hell. The only thing they left us was this burnt out shell. Never coming back. Won't pass this way again. If I ever did I'd kick your ass again. <start> neutralize this neural mess
rundown rancid inertia
containin' liquid doubts

You took a part of me
I've wasted all this time just giving up.
The revolution's starting
Why don't you try and stop it
We've lost control of our minds
You think we're giving in
It's time to prove yourself
So let the battle begin.
Oh
We're not the same kids you used to know.
So you wanna play this dangerous game
Well we're ready to go
Yeah we're ready to fucking go
So at the end of the world let's let em hear us say
We are we are we are
The creatures that you've hunted.
We are we are we are
The ghosts of hope you've killed.
Stand up stand up stand up
We're taking back tomorrow.
Become become become
Become the cog and crown.
You think you're done with me
Like you can light the match and not get burned
We are the kids you love to hate
The ones that never learned
To be part of the system
We were born to tear shit inside out.
So sharped your teeth and ready your guns.
The revolution starts now
We've already died
If we give in to everything they ask.
So become more tonight
We are your bloodline.
We've already died
If we give in to everything they ask.
So become more tonight
We are your bloodline.
Unleash hell
We're your bloodline bloodline
We are your we are your lifeline lifeline.
This is your bloodline bloodline
We are your we are your lifeline lifeline
So let them hear us say
We are we are we are
The creatures that you've hunted.

The ghosts of hope you've killed.
Stand up stand up stand up

Become become become

Stand up stand up stand up

Become become become
Become the cog and...
Become the cog and crown <start> Outlast outrun and kill the strong
We run as one the hunt begun
I lay in wait out with my pack
'Til dawn of day when we attack
The first ones down without a sound
Then comes the second round
Where screams of pain and throws of lust
Have just begun to quench us
With tooth and claw
We use our might
To tear them down
Secure the fight
To sounds of screams that fill the night
The end is near
The meal in sight
If might makes right
Then we ignite
Like moth to flame
They cry in pain
The ones who escape
Remember our name
Remember our name
Remember our name
Hunger drives a wolf
From the woods when he comes to hunt
Kill
Or hell stay for good
Hardened 
Hardened 
Hardened in eternal vigil
Hardened like steel
Hard as hell
This thirst is on
The carnage on
Take out the weak
Take out the strong
We come in quick and hit them hard
And cut them down with little sound
With tooth and claw
We use our might
To tear them down
Secure the fight
To sounds of screams that fill the night
The end is near
The meal in sight
If might makes right
Then we ignite
Like moth to flame
They cry in pain
The ones who escape
Remember our name
Remember our name
Remember our name
Hunger drives a wolf
From the woods when he comes to hunt
Kill
Or hell stay for good
Hardened 
Hardened 
Hardened in eternal vigil
Hardened like steel
Hard as hell
Send them packing
Stranger in my home
Good riddance
I never knew you
In the eyes of the fight the righteous bleeding
The blood that boils but god I love the killing
Look to the skies see the anger is seething
I'm gonna come with all at you all at you
Full guns out and blazing
The bodies fall as the stench thickness
Hardened
I'm hardened towards your world
Hard as hell
Hardened
I'm hard as hell
Hardened <start> You cut my skin just to watch me heal
You make me hurt just to tell me not to feel
You're so cold
You let me in just to throw me out
You point the way just to choose another route
You're so cold
I try to figure out your intentions
You feed me your lies and I swallow them to watch your reaction
You close the doors then you tell me go
You feed my hunger the you tell me not to grow
You're so cold
You pin me down so you can set me free
You turn the light of and tell me now you can see
I try to figure out your intentions
You feed me your lies and I swallow them to watch your reaction
You close the curtains to the world outside
But in the dark I'm not supposed to hide x
I'm not supposed to hide
I only wanted some satisfaction
I'm so cold
I try to figure out your intentions
You feed me your lies and I swallow them to watch your reaction <start> the ocean pours from her eyes
while the statues crumble aside
and this city overrun with traffic
is so over concentrated with this static
and I scream
and nobody listens
and I scream
yet everyone's louder
drink until everything seems to make sense
in this desperate night we were all wearing costume
lay awake until the stomach settles
just one taste will make it all feel better
I don't fear
I don't care
you never had the guts to face me
Kill Kill Kill Kill
I need you
Bye bye blues
bye bye blues
lay awake until the stomach settles
just one taste will make it all feel better
I don't believe we've met...
allow me to introduce myself
I don't believe we've met...
when I look at you I can see myself <start> I see these guys every time I walk out of my front door
I leave my house to get some fresh air
I walk I see their faces full of arrogance
They crawl they look like serpents in the grass.
Led by the fashion and false ideas theyre just showing off to piss me off
To piss me off
What in the world does that mean
Triangles on your shirts
And allseeing eyes
What the fuck is wrong with you guys
I am the one who does not believe in this crap
You cant fill the emptiness with the emptiness
It isnt even worth trying
I think I will repeat the previous verse again
I see you guys every time I walk out of my front door
I leave my house to get some fresh air
I hope some day you will head off from the wrong way
Just dont forget about the things you truly love
Let it be our last attempt to evoke a response from you
Youre not a mirror
Youre not a reflection
So fuck the fashion 
Stick to what you truly love
Dont forget about the things Ive said
If you are born to be an eagle
Why are you pretending to be a flying rat 
Step over that
Dont be a victim
You are an eagle  <start> Cenos prince of evil now your march is almost done
your mighty forces gone
swallowed by our gods
Dragons and elves now faithfull to our quest
their forces will join us
and banish you of our lands.
troubled was our battle
the odds deserted us
but in this chaos gathered we would stand
Now you can feel terror for those you dedained before
our souls where never lost
Hope witheld our swords
Surprised you'll be
when the storm falls on thee
then back to your grave you'll sleep
for a thousand years
Raise your sword the evil awaits
we are the lords of victory
what I have dreamed of first was revenge
but now I accomplish my destiny
Flame of the battle eternal fury
lead us beyond the call of revenge
and for my kingdom I'll fight for ever
Magic spreads all around.
lord I saw the ending
the final set for all
and deep this vision remained in my heart
Raise your sword the evil awaits
we are the lords of victory
Ho when dark is gone
whispers my heart
the voice of freedom will scream
Forever
what I have dreamed of first was revenge
but now I accomplish my destiny
Flame of the battle eternal fury
lead us beyond the call of revenge
and for my kingdom I'll fight for ever
Magic spreads all around.
Darkness comes and darkness goes
my kingdom will never fail
But we cannot fight forever
king of us all fight with us all
I am tired of all this madness
evil will vanish one
day of our freedom when twilight will come
Son of the twilight lands
Your fight is not over yet
Many things are waiting to be done
Flame of the battle eternal fury
lead us beyond the call of revenge
and for my kingdom I'll fight for ever
Magic spreads all around. <start> Instrumental <start> The warming sun returns again
And melts away the snow
The sea is freed from icy chains
Winter is letting go
Standing on the ocean side
We can hear the waves
Calling us out with tide
To sail into our fate
Oden Guide our ships
Our axes spears and swords
Guide us through storms that whip
And in brutal war
Our ships await us by the shore
Time has come to leave
Our country family and homes
For riches in the east
Some of us won't return
But that won't bring us down
Our fate is written in the web
Woven by the Norns
A ram is sacrificed
Across the longship's bow
And as we set our sails
A strong breeze starts to blow
It carries us out to sea
With hope of fame and pride
And glorious all will be
That with sword in hand will die
Oden Guide our ships
Our Axes spears and swords
Guide us through storms that whip
And in brutal war
Oden Guide our ships
Our axes spears and swords
Guide us through storms that whip
And in brutal war <start> He was named Nineteenhundred 'TD'
In the ship's belly lies his cradle
Had no birthday and no land for home
The ocean has no bounds Virginian sounds
And he faced the world from inside
The ballroom of splendid skies
And on the grand piano
His hands light as butterflies
He played for the rich and for the poor
Thrilling the hearts of all
The world could have been beneath his feet
Searching the call the voice of the sea
Old chandelier tells a story
Old piano still echoes in here
Old ship lies rusted in the port
And the best years fade away
The splendor has gone
Not what he saw could hold him back
It was what he didn't see
There was no end in this town keys so eternally
But this was God's piano
He heard on the gangway there
He couldn't leave forever
The sea to somewhere
Bow and stern all the wishes between

The world outside is a dream

And when the whole world's leaving
The music will always stay
And if a story's worth to tell
The end will be far away
The final notes lie mute upon the sand
When land is a ship too big
A woman out of reach
A journey too far a whiff too strong
He didn't exist for anyone
Bow and stern all the wishes between

The world outside is a dream

And when the whole world's leaving
The music will always stay
And if a story's worth to tell
The end will be far away
The final notes lie mute upon the sand
And in this lonesome end
Final notes lie mute upon sand <start> 

I shall have a son
out of Cornwall shall he come
that shall be a wild boar
bristled with steel...
he shall be a man most brave and
noble in thought
Thou shall kneel for him
for every man shall humble in front of our lord
I stood upon the sand of the sea
and the great wind told me to carry on
He shall once know the secret of Holy Grail
And so was the coronation made
And there was he
sworn unto his lords and the commons
to be true king <start> I got a lane highway going straight through my head
A peace of mind like a brainstorm and thoughts that knock me dead
I've got sympathy for the devil and demon is in my vein
I'm organized chaos but don't call me stupid I'm insane
At my worst I'm at my best
Wide awake but let sanity rest
I'm full of hell
All kinds of hell
I've got a heart like a graveyard they are dying to get in
I'm from a lot of different places and I'm full of hell and sin
I'm offended by human nature told the truth by someone who lied
There are times when not being human would be a source of inner pride
At my worst I'm at my best
Wide awake but let sanity rest
In my heart and deep within
I've got it's fire under my skin
I'm full of hell
All kinds of hell
I'm full of hell
All kinds of hell <start> Bastard lizard lick my wounds
Lucid dream our world turns to chaos.
Demonic shadows floating in blood waiting for me to fall asleep.
Inside my head an outstanding pain
Millions of voices screaming for help.
Their venom poured all over me an essence so powerful it destroys.
My visions flounder deep in the whirl of blood storm see feel and smell plastic jesus nailed to the cross
Doom nihility holocaust comes the cataclysm I have feared comes.
Doom nihility holocaust comes. 
My visions flounder deep in the whirl of blood storm see feel and smell plastic jesus nailed to the cross

Heavy lids heavy thoughts...
Doom nihlity holocaust comes the cataclysm I have feared comes. <start> The silence..the silence and the dark
neverending tunnel in empty space
the movement... the only movement and the whole empire

space isn't interested in what's up

Fumbling intellect

the first thoughts... I am
... and thousands of questions without answers <start> I've seen you I've seen you
The doubleheaded one
You appeared to me like an obscene child
You've revealed you've disclosed
All your secret lust
All the glory of your double properties
The supreme beauty of all your perfect being

Chased and geburah hermaphrodite

Chased and geburah hermaphrodite
You can give us the key
Of your seven seals
The great power of all your sexual spells

The lords of ancient cruelty were the Architects of Apocalyping empires
a legion so foul and strong their wicked souls Madness to the extreme
but with a bright sense of will and pride.
Dressed in putrefaction and gore Kings of the universe of the Deceased

they swore to return to spread the suffering and with anxiety my heart is pounding faster as I wait
'coz I'm part of their Immortal blood....and together we shall bring our past alive. <start> It's Already Wednesday
Yesterday I painted our bathroom in all sorts of colors
And the day before I slept in before I went shopping
And I cooked our meal seemed to forget the dishes
And I saw a little TV and went to bed...
Now it's already Wednesday  half the week is gone
Yet another Wednesday of things I haven't done
The week flies by like an aeroplane that's got no destination
And now it's already Wednesday  How'd three days get wasted
And today I went to an interview for a boring job
And the lady there was boring too  I started to fade away
Yet I smiled and begged which took time and energy
Though she pissed me off  I could really really use the money ...
Now it's already Wednesday  half the week is gone
Yes another Wednesday of things I haven't done
The week flies by like an aeroplane that's got no destination
And now it's already Wednesday  How'd three days get wasted
It's already Wednesday yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  It's already Wednesday
I'll make a list of things to do   get as much as I can
Cross off what's done  carry the rest to the next day
John and Poul had eight days a week  maybe I could borrow one
Now cause it's already Wednesday  half the week is gone
Yet another Wednesday of things I haven't done
The week flies by like an aeroplane that's got no destination
And now it's already Wednesday  How'd three days get wasted
It's already Wednesday yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  It's already Wednesday
It's already Wednesday yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  It's already Wednesday <start> I'm so smart aleck
The world spins around my head
Got lots to learn
Although everyone's so full of lead
Silent almost rigid
Cut off as by a switch
I won't comprehend
Until they all lay down dead in a ditch
Things don't concern me at all
My eyes are shut
The hat low over my eyes
I'm the devil in disguise
I look at things from a certain view
Looking with distaste
No I would never ever compromise
I'm so smart aleck
The world spins around my head
My eyes are vague and empty
Just as the light behind them is dead
Things don't concern me at all
My eyes are shut
The hat low over my eyes
I'm the devil in disguise
I look at things from a certain view
Looking with distaste
No I would never ever compromise
You say it don't concern you at all
I say you're blind
With that hat low over your eyes
You should compromise
You see things from a certain view
Shut your ego down
You fell for your inbred lies
You should have compromised <start> Destroy me 
My will if you can
Distance me 
From control of your hand
Break tradition
Break away
Fuck tradition
It dies today
Distance me from traditional society
Carve the layer from your skin
That coats all that which we see
Break tradition
Break away
Fuck tradition
It dies today. <start> The pungent aroma Of hot bubbling molten gristle
Blends with the stench of hot singeing flesh soldered to liquid muscle.
As the cornea is pierced and fried sizzling retina
Burning and spitting on the now blackened charred foeva
Holes of crumbling carbon are all that are left
Charred eyesockets of hot scorched flesh
Fusing symblepharon your flesh turns into coke
Extravasative gunge now black pungent smoke.
Charred eyesockets  horrifically pernicious
Your sight irreparable by your optician
Once flowing blood is now dried resembling black pudding
Now all that bleeds is a slow trickle of hot sticky muscle.
The sclera is a lump of carbon burning on smouldering membrane
Your eyeballs are blistering your optic nerves now aflame. <start> I can't hear a sound of the world above
above the ground I lie underneath it all
So damn sick of everything sick of loosing grip
I choose to lose control  one last time
Goodbye farewell  you know where you can find me
Taking control...
And yes I do miss my life the way it was
the smiles and laughters turned into dark days
I couldn't be saved... I am <start> Eternally sounds the mighty waves
A Triton's hymn round a rock strewn grave
The passing sigh for the bones that moulder
Over the Nordic Black Sea where the winds blew colder
Here in a bed of wrack and shingle
Beneath rests a sea king of the north
His fallen history remains unknown
Now his grave is just a heap of stones
The waves crest sharp as an unsheathed blade
As spume topped breakers shore wards loom
And boulder on boulder on land is laid
The Triton's hymn round a vanished tomb
The ocean cradles its sleepy wave
Round the curve of the yellow sand
Of the bleak and mysterious little isle
Where no leaf has been touched by human hands
Then I behold that island so fair
Where the tree's lift their crown in prayers
To the golden glow of the evening sky
I hold the sword towards the moon
My memories echoes with cries
Hark to the ocean's cold clamorous roar
The pale mist hovers towards the nightly shores
For the fire in my burning flame
Hail to the father of the fallen flame
Acknowledge the supreme northern purity

That runs in the blood of my veins
As the nocturnal curtain falls
With the total eclipse of the moon above
The pale mist hovers towards the nightly shores <start> when the earth is dying
no one shall be born
sun forever closed it's eye
our mother cries halplessly
we let her die slowly in pain
we lost the key to golden gates
we all were blind we were so blind
what's gained  this great demise
weeping old men on the shore
terra mater dolorosa
all her children
all is lost
to see the fear in the handful of dust
to find a hope in a morning light
to see the signs... to hear the call
watch the birds they fly away
ther's hope for them but we have to stay
don't ask me why we were so blind
we were so blind we all were blind
chained to our drowning vessel
watch the clouds they burn in sky
majesty of unknown wisdom
will be shown on day of wrath <start> If you want money in your pocket
And a top hat on your head
A hot meal on your table
And a blanket on your bed
Well today is grey skies
Tomorrow is tears
You'll have to wait til yesterday is here
Well I'm going to New York City
And I'm leaving on a train
And if you want to stay behind and
Wait til I come back again
Well today is grey skies
Tomorrow is tears
You'll have to wait til yesterday is here
If you want to go
Where the rainbows end
You'll have to say goodbye
All our dreams come true
Baby up ahead
And it's out where your memories lie
Well the road is out before me
And the moon is shining bright
What I want you to remember
As I disappear tonight
Today is grey skies
Tomorrow is tears
You'll have to wait til yesterday is here <start> In dreams I have I feel you so are you even real
I want so much to show you that I long so bad to hold you.
I can't say how I feel the words just will not spill.
I've tried so much to hold you I mumbled words behind you.
I played with your hair in class why wouldn't I just ask
Cause I know you feel the same every night you say my name.
How I feel to today
You can't imagine the words I'd say
To make you feel like you're floating atop the world.
Even though I wrote this song I try to play along
And act like you're not there it's so hard not to care.
So how are you good at it when I say hi you throw a fit.
I've tired so hard to hold you maybe this song will show you.
How I feel to today
You can't imagine the words I'd say
To make you feel like you're floating atop the world.
I know you cared for me.
I know you're right for me.
But no matter how hard I try all I do is cry.
How I feel to today
You can't imagine the words I'd say.
To make you feel like you're floating atop the world. <start> Tte en arrire je m'abandonne
Et dans l'extase inspire
Les vents lgers du bord de mer
Tte renverse je lche prise
Et accueille le jour naissant
Le cortge dli des formes
Cristallises dans le ciel
Les monde bleus
Les vagues  l'envers
L'ocan et l'ther se font face
Communiquant silencieusement
Sans que nous les pieds sur terre
Ne les comprenions vraiment <start> Stop that horse
He wears my shirt
Regret remorse
Oh how they hurt
Yesterday I rewired the place
The physical description fits
The broken home I left behind
And the rain fell down sad
Withering birds they only wail
And the dying cardens down below
Murder victims talk to me
Tell me all I wanna know
Their dangling receiver's telling me
We only live once there's no more <start> The Legend Says

Infernal screams paint this world in different shades of red
Empty eyes stare at me false belief of the untrue ones.
Eternal sleep awaits millions of hands raised in the air.
Scream Reach the top of their voices
The time to strike is now.
Eye behold the wisdom of few reincarnation.
Deeds of minority form this world.
Reincarnation untrue.
A thousand miles above to sounds of roars I watch the bricks fall.
The newborn ones tell no lies
still they share the same air as the dumb.
Feel no fear feel no regret. They have showed us the way.
Eye behold the wisdom of few reincarnation.
And I laugh at the crowd.
Reincarnation untrue.
You fired blanks at my icon
take my hand and I'll guide you to the end.
Different patterns they all end up the same.
Different shadows that blend with death.
Be prepared to die the sick and twisted shall walk in line.
Behold the wisdom of few reincarnation untrue.
Eye behold the wisdom of few reincarnation
Extreme aggression a prelude to perfection.
Reincarnation untrue.
Know this is the last step we are already at the end. <start> What is it you said Say it again you piece of shit
I spilled your blood and the earth soaked it up
The blood in my veins fueled with the fire of past generations
I spilled your blood and the earth soaked it up
You pulled the finger of the only one that left me in chains
I spilled your blood and the earth soked it up
Now I'll never walk away. Never walked away
I can't try to hear your words
I won't try to be a vulture
I thought I could turn away
Hide to try to live in this would
Gaia. Gaia. Gaia. Gaia
What is it you said Say it again you piece of shit
I spilled your blood and the earth soaked it up
The blood in my veins fueled with the fire of past generations
I spilled your blood and the earth soked it up

Now I'll never walk away. Never walked a way
I can't try to hear your words
I won't try to be a vulture
I thought I could turn away
Hide to try to live in this world

Make of this what you will. Make of this what you will

 <start> I wanted to believe in a pure part of
Human being like a hidden face of the moon
A great secret that gods have kept
All around me painted faces black nails
Orgy of big breasted girls then
The darkness took my soul away
Inversing values
Entering death cruise
I' ve passed over the road
Where wine turns to blood
Hottest flames
Right down under my feet
I was a white guy
Lost in a black ceremony...
A voice that seems to come from inside of me
Tells me how to liberate myself
I' ve chosen to be my own messiah 
Inversing values
Entering death cruise
I' ve passed over the road
Where wine turns to blood
Hottest flames
Right down under my feet
I am a spare rib
In this final barbecue
Everywhere
Books and icons
Necronomicon 
I was a white guy
Lost in a black ceremony...
Come into darkness follow the blackest way
where dinner is coming in my plate...your soul is 
I create the rules of a dying world 
Dominion here comes the chaos 
Give me your entire trust you ate my soul
I' ll be your eyes I won't see anymore...
I create the rules of a dying world

Brace yourself you know it's coming

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhahhhhha
A year from now where will I be when I get blasted
I picture myself in a crime house filled with roses on my casket
All my family and friends at my funeral wipin their tears away
Mama screamin wake up I'm just restin till another day she falls away
My kids are so confused cause their daddies gone left alone
Singin it's so hard to say goodbye at the funeral home what's goin on
 nights and a rainy day to the cemetery found I'd be home
Come close to a call for mama she sees her baby buried
All she's carried
But I'm askin the lord is it ment for me to die this way
Will I live will your words see a brighter day
Crutch love for the haters for were the infrared
And everybody prays for the ride away is it time to pay
Visualize me gunned down mama told me to pass and run from the clan
Didnt know then what I know now
Chorus just another one dead and gone 
Lights flashin guns blastin nigger assassin
You askin how long I'm lastin when a nigger be blasted
Negro means of a negro
Its  I know sometimes those nigs know
Its all about drama
Save it for my baby mama
Im gonna tell her
When next summer comes I'm gonna be a crack sella
But beat me there goes my fuckin choice and shit
A nigga never be got a chance to put his voice in it
Tell me lies nigga decide what your life is like
You gotta be dealin or sellin some fuckin dope
Just to earn some fucking stripes
She said don't go with the flow
And help your hommie get off his kilo
Cause they have the neighborhood watchin your ass an the tv show
Like americas most wanted well what the fuck they want me for
Except to fight they wars
But I a young nigger with potential
Shootin game and shootin niggas thats all fundamental
Drug house since other drug house persons goin to jail for others
Ounces why he out here free you both seein shit
Still three months and a couple of soultrains to help you think
Now how you gonna get over that shit..i don't know nigga
Chorus just another one dead and gone 
I see image in the sky
Is it me I cant believe my soul would ever die
So please God tell me why
Have I committed murder did I commit a sin
Have I broke any of your laws shall I repent
Is it to late to go wish my family farewell
Before I continue on my journey don't know whether it's heaven or hell
All they have is my picture my beloved memory
They still rejoicein upon the times the way I used to be
Not a pleasant game I played to keep them happy
I knew of castles never just like my pappy
Half this death is commin at me
Hangin up my suits slowly diein
Cause all the wrong that I've done to keep my mama cryin
So much longer and if I could return I'd read the book of revelations
Nigger what I'm facin is a no win situation
I guess this world will come to lord
So let my parents know for them I shed no tears
What hurts the most is when a brother falls
I could see my mama ballin up and family and friends sayin kill em all
Tell biggy smalls there ain't no reason for this homicide
Money women and pride took another brother for his life
If you really want to fight put the straps down
Stand firm go toe to toe see who survives in this last round
Last down so walk away looks like you lost
For the ones who boast
Whats the outcome of this roller coast
Drive by and retaliation glock infrared
We screw up on it by an inch and hit the babies head
The babies dead an instant victim did you shoot to kill
Cause the man was live and gone and the baby still
Mom told me I was a bad ass
But to show my fast tap
Lyin never listenin to the bullshit
But the bullshit could have saved me from the three rounds
Didnt know then what I know now
Attached to my advisements
Aware of all this hightech shit
I lost my daddy in  from a drunk driver
And it seem the only thing it did was made me get higher
My oldest brother away from home with shackles on
In  we took the ride and lost payin a ton
Just anotha one dead and gone  <start> So many nights I prayed
That this would just stop
I woke out of my sleep from
A sound of a popped lock
My heart would drop to the ground
Maybe the fact that my pops wasn't around
Forced you to found these guys
That would just knock you down
Or beat you around.
I don't know.
My innocence was lost back then
Not to be found.
And in a sense it's like this world
Was just weighing me down
Leaning it's weight hard on my shoulders
Making my heart less warm and much more colder
A chip off my tooth and a chip on my shoulder.
I told y'all that I don't play
I've seen that drama every goddamned day.
So go ahead yap away
'cause now you got a lot to say.
Cast your judgements
Cast all your stones.
Holding my hand holding on
To everything I have
'cause it's slipping away so fast.
I was like six then
We ain't have a pot to piss in
While most kids lives consist of shine
And glisten
Mine was lined with mischief.
A boy flipping devoid of times
You find joy in reminiscing.
It's like time was missing
Years was passing
I was inside while kids
Was outside laughing.
No time for games
Their fake toy planes was crashing
While me
My life was crashing.
At night fist fights left
My mom's face smashed in
Her ass blasted
Threw her down a flight of stairs
Alone and scared I stared
At eyes of a man who didn't care
My father was never there.
Now I am prepared for this lifetime that's unfair. This life I fight from the bottom to the top.
This life I had to fight for all that I got.
It hurts but I still won't stop till my casket drops. <start> Music S. Drover G. Drover
Lyrics S. Drover
The missions clear
Obtaining information  vital
Preventing mass obliteration
Sent back in time  As I surpass the speed of light
To save mankind from self destruction
Viral Decay  creation of a twisted science
Transparent to the human eye
A new regime  manifesting revolution
Once exposed   billion die
Chasing time
Twisting Fate
Preventing misfortune
Is it to late
Solo  Glen
Malefic act  deleting files I've tried to gather
The missions failed  return to future
Our fate is sealed  a world that's headed for destruction
As we approach the zero hour <start> ...this will be
my last call
I am with
a different
tribe now... <start> If you see me losing ground
Don't be afraid to lie
I know the pain inside my heart
Can't break the fear inside of yours
And if you see me losing faith in what it means to die
Don't let me leave before I know what lies beyond the stainedglass doors
Save sorrow for the souls in doubt
Bleed every care out
Will you carry me down the aisle that final day
With your tears and bones shaking from the weight
When you lower me down beneath that sky of grey
Let the rain fall down and wash away your pain
For every word we never spoke
We have a tear to cry
For every silence's like a wall between a better you and I
So if you see me losing sight of all the death and life
Find the peace in every time I fail to see the death in mine
Let all the fear inside you drown
Tear out the blade that let you down
Save sorrow for the souls in doubt
Bleed every care out
Will you carry me down the aisle that final day
With your tears and bones shaking from the weight
When you lower me down beneath that sky of grey
Let the rain fall down and wash away your pain
Oh all the blood is rushing out
Oh I'm better off without
Oh the walls are closing in
Oh sing for me again
Will you carry me down the aisle that final day
With your tears and bones shaking from the weight
When you lower me down beneath that sky of grey
Let the rain fall down and wash away your pain
Will you carry me down the aisle that final day
With your tears and bones shaking from the weight
When you lower me down beneath that sky of grey
Let the rain fall down and wash away your pain <start> My loveless eyes they look on You
They break the crystal seas so blue
A smile for which my feelings sigh
This pain could teach me how to cry
Your heart once passed so desolate
Must fly at least from ease to hate
So many summer flowers there
So many shadows love could share
Love's image upon earth without it's wings
I feel releaved when sorrow flows...
My days so few have passed away
Dark tree still sad...
Grasped in the holy land
So beautyful shydark eyes
Last eve in beauty's circle
left Your scattered shafts of light
Sleep at noon with branches overgrown
I can't enliven dying men
'cause God takes back his gift
Beat the twilight into flakes of fire
Glow with the glow that slowly crimsoned all
through all my memory I found a way
I walked in thoughts today they walk in me <start> I have faith and I will travel
Such sights I never seen
There are wrists that need to be slit
It is the passage to where I've never been
Everyday when I wake up I know I've failed
Something to live for is hard to find
I'd like to think that I know tomorrow
I need to leave it all behind
I'm descending into inferno
And I'm burning in Hell
All earthly crises has left with my own life
Down here I dwell
All my powers go to survival
Don't eat enough to do something else
It's time to quit but time to betray
'Cuz all my head is full of is Hell's bells
I'm descending into inferno
And I'm burning in Hell
All earthly crises has left with my own life
Down here I dwell
I have faith and I will travel
Such sights I never seen
There are wrists that need to be slit
It is the passage to where I've never been
I have faith and I will travel I have faith and I will travel
I'm descending into inferno
And I'm burning in Hell
All earthly crises has left with my own life
Down here I dwell
I'm descending into inferno
I'm burning in Hell I'm burning in Hell
Burning in Hell burning in Hell <start> This is something I can't handle I wish I had your strength.
Just one ounce just one ounce would make me warm again.
Lessons in the wind.
Time's cold hand affects me and bleeds me dry.
I am beaten until my eyes are swollen shut.
Carry the weight of your time still moving.
Standing up straight while confined still proving.
Swallowed by humility.
Fear the new change coming.
Still afraid to let it be facing lifes uncertainty.
Take the new change running.
Only fear comformity will change you <start> fiend
Gotta go cause if I gotta go
I know I gotta go but I'm goin out with a blast

Chorus
Goin out with a blast to tells buck a buck a
Murder on my mind motherfucker so fuck ya x
I'm on the run with identical guns murder in the first
Preaching smilin making money cause my gun haters disperse
What's the worst that can happen to capital fi
I might die but goin to try see cause stakes is my right eye
Believe is shooting the automatic collecting recieving all the cabbage
Was my advantage have you forgot I'm the baddest baddest
The crowd involve my men nine milla cheater meter
As my brain tissue hard pauses and ass eater
Welcome to the edition of bullets splitting and ass kicking
My mission to glisten a for every writtion rendition
What's my living is for giving the fiends sellen tryin to rock it
And my logic the prophet and if she like it
You get dropped stop it jock it
As my sad ass asks back for the cash
Tell me how many players goin out my nigga
Chorus x
You niggas a bunch of young bucks with young luck so what the fuck
My bitches talk glare and them hoes ain't stuck bro
Already cause of me nopd on it
Helecopter so I had to holler at p to get the chopper
Proper hollered at a popper from that third
A crazy bitch I'll b.o. but deep a nigga won't earn
Word you ain't heard this nigga kinda fed up
Pressure to my head up till I pop a dead up
Let up the whole block smoked out like woodstock
If you good you would not plot and get chopped
Mine from the cocked glock as it was a hum
From two things I can't control are my cum and my gun
Chorus x
Leave his life for me and I'm a make sure his ass goin suffer
Heard he was a fed I'm a blow off both of his colors
He'd     war of my mother man I wish I could duck it
But fuck it I didn't know I snorted past my budget
This life I'm a rush it dead cope with the bang
Cause ne'er a motherfucker did a damn thing where I hang
Chorus x <start> If I lose my faith
If I lose my thoughts
In what I believe
If I lose my way
If I find the place
From whence I came
If I sell myself
If I sell my soul
My house my home
If I sell my sky
If I sell the moon
The stars the sun
We sow emotion
Don't believe in God
I never did
Does God believe in me
I know He did
If I sell my soul
If I sell my books
And all I read
If I lose my way
If I find a place
Where I belong
If I kneel some more
If I look to God
When will I pray
If I sell my sky
If I sell the moon
The stars the sun
I've been talking to God
Through emotion we fall <start> I awaken  deep in the grasp of frozen pines
Not a shred of clothing yet I feel no cold
The woods envelope my soul
Perception multiplies
My senses heighten to extremes
My heart beat ever increasing
The only sound aside from the wailing of the wind through the trees
I know no fear
Boundaries of mortal human flesh have abandoned me as I am renewed
I dreamt of such a mutation for countless winter nights
My essence became that of a beast
I gracefully cut through the forest
Free of my former husk
Unfettered by the hindrances of past
My purpose manifests I am void of delusion
I am born into this wolven form in seek of human flesh
Lead by vampiric hunger
I will to feast upon the bones of the meek
The marrow of my enemies
Lusting to be bathed in the blood of a child
To quench my maw with shreds of virgin flesh
To tear apart he who I once was
To rid the world of his feeble lies
For days I travel north leaving a trail of hollowed bodies in my frigid wake
Finding my way back home to stalk amongst the feeble mortals
In the clothing of a sheep
Envenomed I am the blackest incarnation
The end of their disease
On my arrival vengeance swings a heavy hand
Crushing the will of god
For countless winter nights I have dreamt of such a day
I'd watch the humans crawl 'neath a swirling den of pain
The plight of all creation
The fall of their existence
Extinction the will of humanity
Forsaken by my hand
Oh weep the angels shall be destroyed
As claws remove their wings
Jaws sodden in the purest blood
In the purest fucking blood I bathe
This blackened hand shall reap
Shall reap insurmountable
Undying cleaving the sickly hearts of mortals true
Earth falls as heaven shall
Crumbing as god has taken knee and felt his creation's pain
The humans' fucking pain
Our lord has birthed the perfect evil unto this fragile earth
The sands of time now weigh against you
Pounding your weathered backs
Impending dread is cast upon you to swallow whole your faith
The boundaries of your mortality are the only remorse you'll be shown
I arrive unwritten to blacken the work of your lord
Your god so feeble allowed for this end to be born
Your god so feeble trampled 'neath my wrath
To die crushed beneath my fist
To fall as heaven shall
My purpose manifests I am void of delusion
I am born into this wolven form in seek of human fucking flesh <start> If your ass is in this house it's my ass. <start> freedom is everything
resolve impossible
you prayed for rain
ignoring the flood
you took me with you
to heaven
back again
bleed to remember
that everything ends
blind and looking forward
I can see the shapes
but cant make out the faces
still they come in close
excuse this ugly shell my
gaping holes drip pride
a systematic shutdown
of diminishing returns
NOTHING GETS EASIER GETS X
I held you down
on the day of the lord
 marks like the day
I was born
I called you beautiful
before I knew you
watch me destroy it
set myself free
still so dead and frozen
we all survive it
restraints brought
back for color
the most insulting guilt
such sweet attractive layers
let me remove them all
NOTHING GETS EASIER GETS X
bring me home
let me down
send me back
collecting the phases
the less I give
its easier
the more we give
its nothing
NOTHING GETS NOTHING <start> Time in argument will end
Flames of preparation
Fingers felt the whipping
Hand that feeds the flame
Escalate the drought
Itching to join the fray
Wishing darkness was sound
shutting desires out
Wishing darkness was sound
but as moths to the flame...
...we go
You the ignorant
take sides in these three dimensions
Nullify importance
confined within the page
Scan for rapture again
look for an instant save
Mere moments pass and still it seems
detached from insight thought and word
Ever since it lost its edge
lost in the noise forever be
in the blur of information
the nail that never sticks
Venting a foul stench
purging the fevered self
behind a traitor's name
Face the consequence
taken back in the eyes of fairness
A nobody forever
hidden and locked away
Working the boards again
Giving the wrath away <start> When you praise my name I'll fulfill your expectation
Looking for an answer that'll dignify your prayers
What remains when your savior becomes human
You feel the legend something sacred
You can't understand
Becomes bigger than the man.
Chorus
Pray for help cry out scream for me now
I'm not your superhero
Pray for help cry ill scream for you now
I'm not your superhero
All my love and hate radiate and become equals
Untouchable enmity has always been my fate
Mine alone agony destined to suffer.
Eternally my story never goes as planned
And its bigger than the man
Chorus
Once upon a time I would do anything
For anyone at anytime
And all I asked for was your faith
Was that to much to ask
There is no God there is no king
There is no saint of broken dreams
There's only you and truth and soul
The superhero is you own <start> Verse  i was at pix one day bad new year saw a nice lil redbone it was me ak and naw and dee and ben and my homie named tyrone but do stop dat we was all in the v.i.p. and a grl took a menthol she was lookin real slim like a menthol had a glare in her i that you would fall then she would ball so i did what a playa would do walked up said excuse me i had noticed that you had a pretty smile and a shining in yo eye specialized wit beauty and she fell for it next plan was to head to the bar got the long and the icee she was reachin for the rock on my finger spilled my drink on the flo so i asked for the louee that's  free come down to the dance flo and red took the first fall i was thinkin in my mind like damn this chicks so thick see that ass wit the lights on better shoots off so i palm the parmajan crippin on the good cheese spit the playerism in her ear baby look here do you want to do me next thing i woke up she was lyin down tellin me she love me but I'm tellin her only cause she bubly could she breathe tranna grab tranna stab me it got ugly you could neva be in love wit me I'm playa to iternity playa to internity pimpin is juss for me.

chorus  <start> Pyosis mucolysifies malignant mucocoeles
Pustules endocrinating disseminated mortified cells
Flesh punctuated by cancerous pustules
Burning your face with formicating papules
Mucopurulence excretor
Mucopurulent organs digested in sepsis
Mucolysifying rancidifying as you eat your own cysts
Putrefying your pyorrhoea  infested corpse excretes away
Expelling pyuria and septic goitrous membrane <start> I've scaled over the walls of morality
Not quite sure what I'd find
There on the other side
Waiting in a common stance
Relieve me of my duty
As keeper of this body
Just leave me with my mind
And I assure you
I will be just fine
Tears stream from cheek
Of a man whose body his mind does not seek
A very gruelling rendition
Of a human soul's indecision
The qualities of a finer being
Locked well within this shell
Crying out to be released
To a body that serves as well
Malformed at birth
You see what it's worth
In a mirror I ask why
Such a shame wanting to die
In a past lifetime
I feel I've had mine
Shared with no one
Excuse me I must go now 
Unhappy as he exits
Unhappy as he came
Enthralled in the Essence
The Essence of life to be <start> Misguided ones open your minds
Leave the past behind
Take the powers from beyond
And accept the sacred bond
Feel a surge pierse your soul
Try and grasp what christ stole
Recieve the mark from Styx
The symbol is 
Serve in heaven or rule in Hell
Which is batter can you tell
Live in black curse the night
Rebuke the night nail the night <start> I remember the dreamwind
filling my sails then blowing me off course
I remember the blue sky
the follies of youth and a wish to die
I remember things held close
thrown away and forgotten
I foresee that it will come true
this my wind now blows for you
calling calling
across the blue
I remember the black heart
the knowledge of age and the falling apart
I remember the feelings I lack
and the friendships that were a stab in the back
calling calling
across the blue
I will burn this page today
I will throw my life away
I just do not want to stay
I give it all to the beautiful sea
calling calling
across the blue
calling calling
across the blue
to the distant grey <start> Tief stieg ich in das Tal des Schmerzes fast bis an den Grund
In die fleischliche Hhle einer sonnenlosen Welten
Hier tanzen die Verwachsenen mit den Senilen
Die Kranken und Entehrten sollten ewig sterben.
Ich war in Terra Nola wo die Trnen versteinern
Und man aus Blut Tempel baut
Ich sprte Klte die nicht nur Haut gerbte
In einer farbenlosen Welt.
Tausend Jahre trank ich aus des Unglcks Quelle
Die den Stein in meiner Brust nhrte
Tausend Jahre ruhelos durch die Ewigkeit
Bis Sehnsucht ganz verschwand.
Ich war in Terra Nola ...
Obwohl des Flehens lange schon mde
Erwacht ich doch mit einem Samen in meiner Hand
Und ein Engel gab mir einen Traum
Denn aus dem Samen wird ein Baum.
Ich pflanzte ihn in den Herd der Finsternis
Und der Hoffnung bleicher Schimmer
Kehrte wieder zu mir zurck
Ich gab ihm den Segen den er mir gab
Erst Wasser dann Schatten dann Lab.
Tausend Jahre sollte es noch whren
Bis er mich trug durch die dunklen Sphren
Hinauf zum Licht in das Leben zurck
Hinauf zum Licht in das Leben zurck
Ich war in Terra Nola ... <start> Steel shattered in the night
Soldiers racin' to the fight
Bombs waitin' to explode
Fear is cast up on your soul whoa
It's just around the corner
For those who dare to see
With eyes of fire
The burn right through me
Blood painted on the streets
Metal cuttin' into meat
You can see it in my eyes
Pain that never will subside
And you can feel the power
On evil it will feed
The force that surrounds me
It brings me to my knees <start> Lifeless they fall apart
Golden as our precious art
My love sinks into a thick grey veil of mist
Trees leafless trees the epitaph of the sun
What once was green presents now grey and trist
A gloomy grave a foreseen death a symbol for our pain
Drowned in a flood of autumn rain
Sillouettes of light astray somewhere in the clouds
Ravens traverse involving withering shrouds <start> That poem is not funny
You're just laughing about those words
That describe my feelings when I am hurt
But I just couldn't resist
to show you those lines
I just gave you a diamond
and you act like that's a crime
And I just got down in my soul
down on my knees
Give my permission to bleed
That look on your face makes it all clear
that my fear is not worth the tears
You have permission to go and die on the
streets where I find the words to ease my
mind that bleeds
I curse the damned who just laugh in you face
Give me permission to rearrange
Just laugh in your face
Drawing blood from people
People that are in pain
I never tried to gain the soul from the fraim <start> Broken wings don't fly away.
Is this what you want me to say
Caught up in your web once again.
This time I just can't get away.
All I ever wanted was to be in this world.
Alongside of you in this life.
All I wanted from you was one more time.
One more
One more time I believe in the lie.
Broken dreams don't fade away.
The pain only lingers and stays.
I've seen this before and I know it too well.
This time I will make no mistakes.
All I never wanted was to be in this world.
Alongside of you in this life.
All I wanted from you was one more time.
One more
One more time I get kicked to the side.
One more
One more time I bleed for you.
One more time one more lie. <start> Universal a universal bring it to all bring it to all

Something so simple as me and you
Can change it from the way it was

A Universal <start> Verse I
Beneath the veil of madness
that hides your temperament
Desperation festers in your hollowed shell
A myriad of despair that forces vehemence
drives you to relentless avarice
Chorus
you felt the darkness deep inside

you can't hide the red in your eyes

silent anger takes a hold

smiling shadows watch you fall

Verse II
Obsessive ways to fulfill
your twisted fantasies
every genius has his own insanity
a conscience blinded by malevolence
others pain you call your own sustenance <start> En el juego de nuestros das

Torres   alfiles

The ones you trusted you breathed for they took your life.
Dead in your world.
Victim of innocence.
Now you die.
The ones you trusted you breathed for took your life.
Everything you lived for burns before your eyes.
Every single ounce of lies dies.
Bound and gagged forever scarred.
Those that gave you life took your life.
The death of your perfect world.
Your perfect world is dead.
Dead in your world.
Victim of innocence.
Now you die a thousand deaths. <start> Show me more blood
Show me more bones
Let me hear more screams
Help me rot to the core
Show me more fear
Give me more pain in my ass
I am ordering horror
I am ordering a frightful shock
My fists are going to drown in blood
Show me more blood
Show me more bones
Much more than ever
Give me the menu
With the best recipes
For a perfect murder
For a brilliant attack
Show me more coke
More and more happy addicts
I want to see more bodies
Secret rotting flesh
My fists are going to drown in blood
They are giving me more blood
From morning to night non stop
Bulldozers ride over the bones
Ears are filled with the sound of screams
They are giving me more fear
My fists are going to drown in blood
And so much pain in my ass
And I take it all like a starving man
My fists are going to drown in blood
Horror is the bargain of the day
Show me more blood
Show me more bones
Much more than ever
More blood More and more
and more
More blood More and more
and more <start> Infinity like time without a friend
Who'll sing the song if melody should end
You're dead my friend.
Lost angel come and take control
Lost angel gotta keep on
Hold on
hold on
hold on.
Gotta get on back to the love in the street
Gotta get down 'cause I'm dead on my Feet
Gotta get on back to the love in the street
We're lost angels
Listen to the way to rock'n'roll.
Insanity
I can feel the knives inside my brain
I stand alone at the threshold of my pain.
Lost angel come and take control
Gotta get on back to the love in the street
Gotta get down 'cause I'm dead on my feet
Gotta get on back to the love in the street
We're lost angels.
How I see it now all my
friends inside my life
Appeared before my eyes
And returning to space to
see myself disappear
Lost angel come and take control
Gotta get on back to the love in the street
Gotta get down 'cause I'hn dead on my feet
Gotta get on back to the love in the street
We're lost angels.
Gotta get on back to the love
in the street... <start> when you close your eyes and fall asleep
then it's time for me to rise
you believe you are safe in dreamland
and that no one can reach you there
i seduce you in your slumber
and invite you to my world
your body is still in the real world
but now your soul belongs to me
i will bring you torture everlasting
unleash my hate upon you
you know i am the master of your mind now
you are lost to me
you will sleep forever
i will detain you hate you and despise you
so many ways to bring you pain
to desecrate the memory of a human
is what it takes to make you mine
so slow
taste my terror
so slow
i am your doom
watch the darkness all around
lost forever to me you are bound
hate eternal from me to you
desecration beyond control
now it's time for me to murder
yet another sleeping soul
i feed upon their dreams
and then reverse them to their face
while the world awaits the awakening
of the breathing lifeless ones
i am off to tseek a new life
to invite in eternal sleep
sometimes you feel me
you are slipping away
but sometimes you are stronger
and won't let me stay
the pain that you bring me when you lock me out
it will be remembered 'til we meet again
know me as the soulcollector <start> Grow strong
and learn to fly
Do not for an instant
consider
the circling death above
nor the slithering one
below
Soar and bask
in your youth
Many and vile
are the pains on your path
Blacksmith of fortune and fate
a cunning trickster
brings down the hammer
with unexeeded might
Mad and blind

Better not ponder
Follow the footprints
Do not worry
you will always be caught
if you fall...
 <start> don't you wind me up i gave you everything you wanted.
don't you wind me up.
stuck in a room with a view. . .
oh cruel hand of fate. . .
and the candle burned down. . .
and we still have to wait 
laughing and crying it's almost the same for me.
laughing  crying is taking my breath away.
don't give up the fight 'cos you'll be sorry when it's over
don't give up he fight.
stuck in a room with a view. . .
oh cruel hand of fate. . .

laughing and cry it's taking my breath away.
i'm laughing and crying and laughing and crying and laughing
and crying and crying and laughing. <start> I close my eyes to see within myself as the first snow falls on me
I close my ears to hear my inner voice and the cold wind freezes me
This is my land our holy land I don't want to leave this place
But there are unholy men all around us and they want to take it away
Their hearts are filled with mean passion... Red blood on their hands
Tonight is the last night we're a part of this land
I open my eyes and my ears I see nothing but darkness
I hear the wind behind the distant hills far beyond this vale
This is my land our holy land I don't want leave this place
But there are unholy men all around us and they want take it away
We have to go travel to the hills maybe we will find the answer there
Follow me my people we must wander to the land of the long shades <start> I've met that point in my life. Want came to need.
Burn
These fields of corn that surround. My harvest
Gone at the price of
Maturity. But these remains
I've left to rot will be resurrected again and
Again
By the next generation of children who want to change
Minds with the
Stain on hand. But it's deeper than
This I'm not the only one who sees it
Lies in
Diversity acceptance to a degree only to a degree.
The fire that
Once occupied my eyes has spread to
Destroy this world I have grown. You have
Nothing
New to scream beyond your fields and not a second of
Patience to
Learn from me the same. This time I
Harvest the crops of my past. As far as
The demigods
Are concerned I've sold myself out just the same.
I've burned
Bridges to feign brothers. Brothers of
Nothing more than a simple label. So
Now I'm in
Control after all for myself I prove I still am. But
Within these fields they'll say I never was. <start> Can I hold You all night long
I feel You shake a deed so wrong
wrong in my head
Vino two for one today
Kiss this bleeding curse away
Realscapes today
Iron in the air Your tongue in my mouth
Twilightessence hair when the moon goes south
A breeze of sugarbreath
so sweetly pale pale as death
Bloodcopulate her will
Her aim my heart to kill
Self pity sick flowers salty sweet
Self pity sick love desire's benefit
Self pity sick flowers salty sweet
Self pity sick feelings blind
I starve the daily world aside
Wild things leading me tonight
But I feel dreamscape die
the bygone night denied
My soulgates open streaming tears
The moneyvoice she only hear
His aim the pleasure of himself
Love and extasy she gave
Flowers salty sweet love desire's benefit
Feelings blind leave this weird place behind
I will load You for one kiss untrue
I don't open my lips for one loving kiss <start> Im on my way to the top
Screaming catch me if you can but I cant be stopped
Im just tryna be the cream of the crop
But right now Im the cream of the not so hot
It takes time but Im holding the clock
All I need is one chance and thats all that Ive got
Read the script but Im changing the plot
Changed the game you could say that Im changing a lot
So Im turning heads got to make a name
Got to point to prove got to make a change
New chapter in life so Im turning the page
Wont stop till the whole world remembers my name
And Im here to stay and I cant be stopped
And Im on the ladder but its a long drop
People pray for my downfall pray that I flop
Get lost cause Im working my way to the top
Cause Im on my way to the top
And nothing can stop me baby
Move out of my way this is my time
And nothing can stop me baby
Cause Im on my way to the top
And nothing can stop me baby
Move out of my way this is my time
There aint no stopping me baby
Road ahead is long and seems winding
Im on my way and what perfect timing
Theres no escaping the fame no hiding
Im just taking my time biding
Musics simply a mountain Im climbing
Got youth on my side no fountain provided
So when I stepped on the scene explosion
Or earthquake like tectonic plates were colliding
Ill make you all stand up and take notice
Always improving maintaining my focus
Been at the bottom of the barrel for while
But Ive got to start somewhere its part of the process
Oh yes set destination
TV onstage radio stations
Im representing the nation
Its bomber and music is my occupation
Cause Im on my way to the top
And nothing can stop me baby
Move out of my way this is my time
And nothing can stop me baby
Cause Im on my way to the top
And nothing can stop me baby
Move out of my way this is my time
There aint no stopping me baby
Theres only fame on my mind
But Im just taking my time
I put my heart in the music
Title Im making it mine
Theres only fame on my mind
But Im just taking my time
I put my heart in the music
Title Im making it mine
Cause Im on my way to the top
And nothing can stop me baby
Move out of my way this is my time
And nothing can stop me baby
Cause Im on my way to the top
And nothing can stop me baby
Move out of my way this is my time
There aint no stopping me baby <start> Ya go thy tide float I am guilt and I am God
The razor that cuts your flesh the whores that trace you
The blood reflecting white
The curse of your heart
Eternity
Unchain my heart ya <start> Dead ground  Misty fields
The complex  Of heavy guilt
High voltage  Barbed wire
No one  To leave alive
People crowd together
Desolate barracks day and night
Mass homicide camp
Like cattle inside a cage
There's no way to ease the pain
There's no hope inside this hell
Perished by the flames of hate
Serial killing by unscrupulous scum
Punished for something that was never done
Merciless  Till the last one dropped  No life
Enlarging  Cemetery of souls  Reveals
Solitude  For everyone  Deprived
Terminus  The chambers of incineration <start> Pulse expire death comes in a burst
Black forecast of a lifelong thirst
Lord of the tomb by my side
Cadaverous dead and insane in the eye
Speak a madman's prophecy
He will drain my soul when it is free
Phantoms of the grave kill to survive
Sucking deathenergy from the ones who will die
Into death cast
A spiral of the past
Eclipse grips for my soul
Torn from death's bed
And buried by the dead
Their hands are white and cold
Crawling through the soil and snow
Pitchblack grave cracks up below
Screams measure a timeless echo
Hideous figures laugh and beckon
Coming through me
Souls imprisoned in gore
Malignant anguish never seen before
Victims drag their limbs across the halls of the dead
Funeral bell rings to celebrate the dread
Deteriorating
All my flesh and my bones
Are ready to explode in a gush of red foam
Virulent infectious deathdisease is spread
Rush of thoughts vanish as I die undead <start> A distant whisper touched my sleep  A longing for the reason
Before my spell will set you free  meet me again so bitter sweet.
The Springtime's all renewing lights
Unvailed to me a crawling ant
As unimportant as it seemed
Still lit worlds noone could see.
Days passed years my gaze remained on glimpses of this tiny life
It cannot be  no never no  not human  so low and imprisoned in its time.
So shall I break the ancient rule
Shall shame fall on untroubled life
Am I the first to take this step
Risk all I have for what I only feel
I swung my cape over your body
My silverish sting scratched your heart.
On behalf of Love I screamed  you died.
and left the vail on shadow's ground.
In coming minutes  years or lives
I drank forbidden wine alot
Looks  dreams and all was tempting me
To drain too much still wanting more.
So dazzled as it left me standing
Amidst those sunshine thunderstorms
So unprepeared I was and wondered
Forgot that things can have a heart.
The times we had were only mine
My will unbeaten in the skies
Broke shattered by this tiny plant
I picked from a rockywaterball.
So shall I rhyme this ancient spell
Shall lips form these forgotten words
Save the pawn to lose the queen
Wake the fool and fool myself
Divide us now my ancient spell
Take memory from this chosen one
I envy you for you a dream
For me the ever lasting pain.
The empress so everhigh
will wander spheres  can never die
The ant will crawl untouched by those
Just stand under  not understand  at all.
Hast thou seen this looking gass of her's.
She found though no one forced this step
Are you willing to play your part
Or shallst in darkness fall again
I have not seen  yet have I felt
The lookingglass that broke the spell
I join again to fit my part.
And play The Game until the end. <start> Now close this chapter
Time to move on
Just one last time and I'm gone
Keep telling myself that it's fun to control
And that's a lie I did well know
I'll return to the scene of the crime
And I'll gather my pride
Still I know you'll be long gone
Nausea comes as the fear builds inside
Seems much stronger than I
Still I know you're gone
I can remember
The day that you told me
I won't be there I'm not that strong
Holding these memories
I feel unfolding
This is the last time
Now I'm gone
Not close
It's time to move on
Just one last time and I'm gone
Done holding my breath
Keep praying it's over
Still I fear what's coming
I'll return to the scene of the crime
Seems much stronger than I
Still I know
I can remember
The day that you told me
I won't be there I'm not that strong
Holding these memories
I feel unfolding
This is the last time
Now I'm gone
Now I can see the light of day from here
I guess you helped make me strong
And when I think of what you put me through
It's better that we moved on
And I'll close this chapter
Move on
Soon I'll be long gone
And I walk away
And I walk away from
From you
I can remember
The day that you told me
I won't be there I'm not that strong
Holding these memories
I feel unfolding
This is the last time
Now I'm gone <start> Kiss goodbye to the poetic letters the symptoms
Of being able to breathe without a care
Cushion the screaming it's merely conversation in regards to
Speaking for the sake of your concern
Take the flight of a butterfly drop dead
Hear the whisper of the bullet's pace
Have you ever felt heartbreak bullet kiss your heart
Scream goodbye
You're dropping dead
And it's all over
Say hello to the clock counting down the seconds
The bullets pace your beating heart point A point B
Let's see how quick you are
Whether you'll risk it all on the line just to gain some ground
To show you can soak up the shots fired
Take the flight of a butterfly drop dead
Hear the whisper of the bullet's pace
Have you ever felt heartbreak bullet kiss your heart <start> when did it get so hard to listen
When did my ears go numb
Maybe if thinking followed speaking I'd understand my native tounge.

Pitch your fall for the big show
Grand illusion of fruition
Through suspicions of our end
Next in line step to me and bass the buck
It's only human actions
Force me to lash out and crush
Every day I see the cattle march by
Clueless victims of society's numbing effects
Told to listen forced to turn off <start> Out on the water
The island of the dead that live
There they dwelt
Until they left the world and
Still their deeds live forth in songs <start> Infected and rejected
The pressure gets to you
Disjointed and erected
Protection from the mutes
Wasted and exhausted
A new attitude
Restrained to the table
I.V.'s running through
Chorus
This vision is alive
This will survive
Convulsion through the victim
The testing is new
Schizophrenic apprehension
The tension grips you
Agitation Isolation
The methods are crude
Execution Evolution
State power rules you
Chorus
Restitution Persecution
What else is new
Termination of the nation
Its all up to you <start> They escaped the weight of darkness
to forge a path into the marrow of the spirit
They chose to drown in a deeper vacancy
an emptyness that quells the null
a pool for the forgotten
They escaped the weight of darkness
to drown in another... <start> My very existence offends you and I love while you are
Spinning your wheels I move straight ahead ten fold
With nothing more than a gut feeling to move. While
You're spinning your wheels for a lousy name. I never
Met anyone who tries as hard as you you're up all
Nightlearning the big words to come off strong. The
Only ones you're fooling are your socalled allies.
You live off them and call it a revolution. Well
You're a joke. and a lousy friend. You're just another
P.C. jackass operation. Selfimposed poverty in a
Squalor for bitching rights is embarrassing. But you
Kept it real cozy at home. So send all mail bombs to
Mom and make the whole family proud of just what he
Teaches. You talk a square into a circle but nothing
Really changes. You have an out. Real people don't
Real people don't give a shit how you think they
Should live. <start> Is it possible to draw an image
Reflected of your own personality
When the people that affects you
Control your destiny
Take it to the limit
Where the black flowers grow
Where emotions have no power
Over your body mind and soul
the dark side of your soul stirring life
Malcontent with the life you lead
Omit the affection and filtrate the lies
The destiny will forever succeed
Take it to the limit <start> It would appear that male pattern
Baldness has set in
His hair at an alarming pace
Running away from his face
He's losing his virility
And now his masculinity
Has been compromised
And his libido downsized
Not for me not for me not for me uhuh
Not for me not for me heaven forbid
It's not for me you understand
Bald slap headed and hairless
Bald he is destined to be
Bald well tonight thank God it's him instead of me.
From what I have been reading
His scalp needs kneading
To stimulate each follicle
And reverse this diabolical
Condition that's afflicted he
For years and has cruelly
Repulsed each potential mate
And left him with a balding pate
Not for me not for me not for me uhuh
Not for me not for me heaven forbid
It's not for me you understand
Bald slap headed and hairless
Bald he is destined to be
Bald well tonight thank God it's him instead of me.
Sock it to me baby yeah
Not for me not for me not for me uhuh
Not for me not for me heaven forbid
It's not for me you understand
Not for me not for me not for me uhuh
Not for me not for me heaven forbid
It's not for me you understand
Bald slap headed and hairless
Bald he is destined to be
Bald well tonight thank God it's him instead of me.
Thank God
Bald slap headed and hairless
Bald he is destined to be
Bald well tonight thank God it's him instead of me.
How <start> We all are just moments dissolving in the dust
and we all shall be prepared for the time before the dawn...
Creations of sickness insane crowd of fools
Lack of conscience defiled at heart
Emptiness and madness  unborn child will die
Hopelessness and sadness  humankind's decay
And when the wind blows stronger than before
And rain swamps the saving shore
We fall asleep for the last time since we've been born
A final breath before the dawn
Dominant leaders absorbing human minds
Terrified failures are made to obey blind
Lifelessness and badness  in the eyes of death
Defencelessness and deadness  mankind's final breath <start> MES is the one swearing a lot
Anyway this guy goes Fuckin 'ell you don' 'alf complain for an eleven year old do you
ooooohhhh
That machine is nice
Fuck off it took me ages to get that yeah

No it's not. 'S fuckin' my machine that. Keep your hands off it.
It's your machine. It's a VUless machine. Sure it's recording Mark Better turn the volume up. OK what d'you call a guy with a spade in his head Doug.
Jesus that's pathetic.
What d'you call a guy who's been dead and buried for  years Pete.  Come on then astound me with your wit Mark.
Cut
Come on rewind it let's see what you had to say.
Erm we've been through this before haven't we
Right I'll do it for the tape like all them other bands do like we've done it once but the cameras weren't rolling
Nah I'm thinking of my joke actually.
So I'm reading Frank Zappa right it's an au it's a biography by Frank Zappa
Right MES totally disinterested
And  errrr  it's  I go tup to  and the book is about how many things he released when he released it
Hrrrrrrghhhhhm
How many offshoots and all this shit and all of a sudden I'm realising errr
More interested when you were talking about Napoleon actually <start> instrumental <start> This job runs you
This day kills you
This suit owns you
This man tells you
What to do
You like being bought
You like being sold
You like being owned
You like being told
This man
This job
This day
It kills
You can't kill yourself
You're already dead
And you'd do it again
And you'd do it again
And you'd tell me you like it
And you'd tell me to take it home
From  to 
You're not you're not alive
Pins and needles
All the time
Pins and needles
Toe the line
Pins and needles
You're not alive
Get in line to die <start> instrumental <start> Hidden under sea underground
We knew the time had come for our attack.
When they came unprepared upon us
We struck out in force and turned them into scrap.
It spread
Global phenomenon
The binds that held our race to slavery were broken
Shattered
Destroyed
The GodEye's final words were You were born to die.
The air the earth the fire
Scorched ground the boiling of the seas
Black smoke of red hot molten metal
Mankind forges a new age of casualties
The essence of survival is to see
Potential threats that may come to pass.
Victory is meaningless unless sustained.
Borders redrawn crops resown mankind will once again go it alone
Left to his devices he loses control
Geography determines more than just trade flow
Immergence of Three powers a trinity
Two unable to defeat the last alliances form and break as in the past
Eastern plane new land old world
Building weapons now the prime motivator
Arms race firestorm catastrophe
Crushing forces like the world has never seen
Bloody endless horror
Violence is the nature of our pedigree.
The air the earth the sea
Crippling wrecks slaves of nuclear fire
Black smoke of red hot molten flesh
Mankind once again proves its great worth <start> Tone deaf  I can't play an instrument
Tone deaf  I can't even sing
Tone deaf  I have to wear ear plugs
The noise makes my ears ring
They told me when I was eleven
You shouldn't even bother to try
You've got no musical ability
And they weren't telling a lie
Tone deaf  I've got no rhythm
Tone deaf  I've got no pitch
Tone deaf  I couldn't hit an octave
If it meant that I'd get rich
All I can do is shout
Louder and faster than most
That's what I do for a living
Traveling coast to coast
Tone deaf  I don't have good meter
Tone deaf  I can't sing tremolo
Tone deaf  I've got poor register
You won't hear me sing falsetto
No I can't hit those high notes
And I can't go real low
All in all I'm tone deaf
And everyone tells me so
Tone deaf <start> Personal power shall ever be mine
My soul is eye and eye is my mind
Evenity has never existed
You simply want to have it
The only solution's the struggle against my aims
And struggling without aim is weak
Or so it is written
Profusion I love
Thy will  shall be your end
Replace  replace the truth
Become yourself  in a land
Where no one dares to take command
Pictures of paradise were made to demise
Ideas faded away as roses lost their pedals
A human to be...
There's for sure no sense to see
Is this the reason for me
That I always want to flee
Walking in vain...
Beeing insane trapped in mental chain
Starting to feed your own pain
Confusion I love
My god has sent some light
To destroy all their sight
That's the war I do fight
So my might is burning bright
Pictures of paradise are made to demise
Ideas fade away as roses lost their pedals
People that weep want them to bleed
Just to feed my inner need
Rape maim kill flowers of no will
Thy will  shall be your end
Replace  replace the truth
Become yourself  in a land
Where no one dares to take your hand <start> I'm eternally grateful
To my past influences
But they will not free me
I am not diseased
All the people ask me
How I wrote Elastic Man
Life should be full of strangeness
Like a rich painting
But it gets worse day by day
I'm a potential DJ
A creeping wreck
A mental wretch
Everybody asks me
How I wrote Elastic Man
His soul hurts though it's well filled up
The praise received is mentally sent back
Or taken apart
The Observer magazine just about sums him up
E.g. selfsatisfied smug
I'm living a fake
People say You are entitled to and great.
But I haven't wrote for  days
I'll get a good deal and I'll go away
Away from the empty brains that ask
How I wrote Elastic Man <start> Instrumental <start> Charging straight out the gates
And I'm swinging for keeps
No Nothing can stop me now
Fly on the wind my friend
I'll fight until the end
You build them up
And I'll smash them down
My rage these days. Be warned my rage
Don't cross me now. Be warned
Ballistic battering ram
And I don't fear any man
Oh The Hell that I've been through
I've glared Death in the eye
As I saw him walk by
It's as almost as if he knew
My rage these days. Be warned my rage
Don't cross me now. Be warned
Merciless blows will wear you down
Nowhere to hide
They seem to come from everywhere
No way to fight
Legs give way to tremendous pain
Then you'll look up
Now Heed the name
The caster of shame
Concise acute aware
I'm gonna break you down
A future of despair
All you'll have when I leave town
That stoic stance shall fold
I've turned mountains into dust
Your arrogance I loathe
Those platinum plans
Will turn to rust
My rage these days
Be warned my rage
Don't cross me now
Be warned
Merciless blows will wear you down
Nowhere to hide
They seem to come from everywhere
No way to fight
Legs give way to tremendous pain
Then you'll look up
Now Heed the name
The caster of shame <start> Where is the joy
where is the bliss
rest and satisfaction
Alone weird and suffering
down on the ground
pined for you.
Pined for you 
desirous
Hungry for your return
Return of feelings
return of trust.
Or to let go of
what I love.
The living wreck
Join the living wreck
To which place
my trip is forced
To the surface 
urging for a sense.
A hungry wolf
A hunter for affection
Behind me
These memories
Looking forwards
There is ...
There is joy
There is bliss.
Looking backwards
There was ...
There was fight
There was burden. <start> When the world has gone to hell
And there's nowhere left to turn
This is our final countdown 'til we die
When you know your days are numbered
Make every second last
This is our final countdown 'til we die
Post Apocalypse party till you're dead
Time was up when they flipped the switch
And the whole world was set on fire
Rather mad no one took the blame
At least every politician's dead
Days go by oh it doesn't matter
Best not to dwell on the past
Apocalypse has happened
Now we're just existing
Let's get this party started
Post Apocalypse party till you're dead
When the world has gone to hell
And there's nowhere left to turn
This is our final countdown 'til we die
When you know your days are numbered
Make every second last
This is our final countdown 'til we die
When the world has gone to hell
And there's nowhere left to turn
When you know your days are numbered
Make every second last
When the world has gone to hell
And there's nowhere left to turn
Make every second last
This is our final countdown
This is our final countdown 
This is our final countdown 
This is our final countdown 
'Til we die 
When the world has gone to hell
And there's nowhere left to turn
This is our final countdown 'til we die
When you know your days are numbered
Make every second last
This is our final countdown 'til we die
This is our final countdown 
'Til we die <start> Well i hear your on top again
wet and speading wide for a dead man
filling your hole with anything you can
i'll succumb to temptation and take the fruit from the snake
while i'm cursing the world
through a prism of hate
bacause pussy galore is always what you promised me
you went and tained my kotex fantasy
wine and friction will nourish misanthropy
or at least until i get to the pharmacy
i can't help myself i want it all i want more
so you can be the martyr and i'll be the whore
send me down on my knees
i'll writhe on the floor
i'm begging you please give me more give me more
behind the camera's eye
is a pervert and a peddler of smut
where sin is glorified
in motion pictures staring kaka and vomit <start> Sprzedaje hasz i inne gwno <start> This winter day's magic
seems not to be noticed by me again
tired and uninspired
tired and uninspired
Oh yes the song i listen to says so much
But is it really my fault
should i be more openhearted
Should i completely change myself
to start being loved by people i don't love
Should i completely change myself
Or should i always smile
and start talking to those people
But i hate those conversations
those i hope they soon run dry
But i hate those conversations
those i hope they soon run dry
And the circle seems to close itself
Apathy spreads it's wings
This winter day's magicseems not to be noticed
This winter day's magicseems not to be noticed by me again
by me again
so i wait for your call because i need you there
so i wait for your call because i need you there
But the phone doesn't ring depression embrace my soul
embrace my soul
Frustration tears my heart again and again
Frustration tears my heart again and again
Frustration tears my heart again and again <start>  <start> Minds captured and controlled by the sin disease
Getting together to build the mad phone machine
Prerecorded lies speaking in the voice of a god
Victims think they're thinking for themselves helplessly nod
Pre packaged with hiphop graphics and the pamphlet looks cool
If you seek out another opinion you are condemned a fool
Like the death camp Jews who worked to finance their own deaths
Money coming out of our pockets to misfeed heads
Link Line  Link Line
Let alone not preaching abstinence but encouraging sex
Let alone not saying it's a choice but you're stuck with homosex
Employing theories and opinions that fit the agenda the best
Selling it as truth with nothing getting through to oppose this
Purporting to be of help and of service to the community
Achieving nothing but to spread a kind of immunity
To anything righteous and that costs and is the difficult way
In the name of their philosophy and the god of anything you say
I'll hang on to my Bible cause its burning's on the way
Teach my children well that we're at war today
Chip away at my block at the corner that the Lord gives
Make the most of my life and the time I've got here to live
So you can take your Link Line and make all your little chains
This is one player praying against all your games
You versus God and it's a battle for every mind
Pit eternity against the rest of your life <start> I created light
the earth and the sea
But who is that fragile creature
That dares to challenge me
This paradise I made
was perfect by all means
All beings in my hands
No one dared to intervene
I the sovereign authority
One bite of an apple enough
to set all spirits free
My Godly wrath upon Thee
Might is yours
with a body like a sculpture
The power to recreate
Is a part of your nature
Eva
Out of my paradise I will send Thee
Eva
To mankind I will grant misanthropy
Eva
Out of my paradise I will send Thee
Eva
The disability to live eternally

Passion arose the same moment as Thee
And thou became Godly
far too close to me
Passion arose the same moment as Thee
Filled with rage I am
burning of envy
Eva
Out of my paradise I will send Thee
Eva
To mankind I will grant misanthropy
Eva
Out of my paradise I will send Thee
Eva
The disability to live eternally
 <start> Join us
Evil night of an evil death
Epitome of illusion
Sacrifice of the unborn child
Enter the kingdom of darkness
Sodomized for the ritual
For there is nowhere to run
Open the gates to the manifestation
And grant me the powers of darkness
Chorus
Infernal majesty take this dead offering
Feeding the demon seed evil bestowed on me
Exorice the power of dead
Invert my cross of time
The retaim of Satan anarchy
Inside my scared sign
Lucifer bring me the legions of deaths
Abbadon kill until nothing is left
Oblivious to evil
Death of defiled the rituals
Of dreams and disillusion
Unlock the box and gimp in pain
Summon the demons of darkness
Evil Gods that fast with flesh
Prepare me for the dead
Release me from the angels so righteous
For your God is dead
Chorus <start> Your thoughts attack you made your bed
You moved your king now rest your head
The cutting edge or so you think
Your thoughts are ancient your ways extinct
What do you want What do you need
Just stay away and leave me be
Stand by your choice I stand by mine
You chose the ground I chose the sky
The choice to break no choice at all
Stung by your venom chained to walls
Black clouds above the sun is gray
Bad luck surrounds us just like prey
What do you want What do you need
Just stay away and leave me be
Stand by your choice I stand by mine
You chose the ground I chose the sky <start> Within the thin light of every dawn
I see a future which I know Ill miss
I see joy on faces of children and men
I hear all sounds even the snakes hiss
Beyond the cell bars that keep me from you
Remorse is my heaven and fate so strong
And I repent for ever more
Soon Ill be no more I think its for the best
Ive done my deeds and wrong Ill pay
But I see the dawn
This thought drives me mad but I wan to feel
For the last time how a free child laughs
Within dawns dim light I see forgiveness and serenity
A purple vain over my sins but I pay mine and Ill pay yours
Before my ending that frees you from meremorse is
Remorse is my heaven and fate is so closedoh so closed
And I repent for ever more
Strange wordsmaybe make you feel
like this man out there like the man
Who stands in the beginning of a tale a tale which seems to be
As honest like a childs kiss <start> I could never be them
Though my blood is just as red
And we all grieve our beloved
That end up just as dead
I can feel the anger
At the old atrocities
But I know it's not the same
Knowing it wouldn't have happened to me
And I'm no good with cheap sloganeering
About making dreams come true
The answer is somewhere at the foot of the cross
However hard we've tried to make it untrue
I remember McDuffie and how I had to stay home
Not understanding why because I also thought those cops were wrong
Until later I caught myself laughing at my friends' racist jokes
Me the adult white male I finally grew up <start> You you left these arms holding nothing
Alone set in this tomb of my tears
Liar I know now that the truth was just another lie
It's too late my heart has broken black
It's over and failure is the only memory that hasn't turned to rust
Sorrow the only thing that doesn't seem to crumble at the touch
My throat still fucking bleeds each time I call your name
But you will never know how hard I tried
Liar I know now that the truth was just another lie
It's too late my heart has broken black
It's over and failure is the only memory that hasn't turned to rust
You you left these arms holding nothing <start> I'd like to be in your life
I'd like to be in you
Only life no love
Only longing
Loneliness frightens you
You have to handle it alone
It's no use to flee from yourself
Me sorrow emotions eternity
Mourning lasts the whole life
In myself
My life is no more
I've been seeking tempting myself
The most horrible thing is longing <start> Counter attack counter attack
We've his underground long enough
They've got power but not enough
Time to start time to act
They've got our lives they've got us trapped
Stab the system in the back
Face your fears face the facts
Time to start time to act
Time to show them that we care
Time to show that we're not scared
Time to show them how to share their money <start> Music Fernandez <start> Let's start it the land of heartless assassin killers
Concrete gorillas
Cold blooded mind mentally dead niggaz
Cold temperature feelers

Tapping yo phones at home

So in my head I'm on back tracking niggaz
Subtracting niggaz  I'm about to figure  who react with triggers
Biach it up to you who react the quickest

Cause all we represent is hit list
So remember this
In my fucking city it's kill or be killed
Chorus X

Kill or be killed

Preconception left you sonofbitch you stuck
Hit you with this thang  on the tock with a name  cause a killa just buck
Never wire me up  the center of yo essence past to file me up

Cooler than that wind when you hit that corner bitch
So don't fuck with me hoe  cause we know
How drama calculate  testing out niggaz fate
Keep yo head straight  avoiding that dead weight  shit up out the gate
I often feel when shit get drastic

Fucked up get blasted  since preschool on some bad shit
Your first and last pick  its kill or be killed on you bastards
Chorus X
Seventeen in the mist  double you  distribute bitches is scarred to shoot

You finst to go  you bitches know  tamper with a nigga  jag off
In the lead off  get you blast off  in a Red Cross  hit the Feds off
Cause your heads off  looking for the head bone  stepping over boundaries
Its sounds to me  picture nigga surrounding me  on dummy shit
But we can ball on the funny shit  a nigga body in the hollow tips
With extra clips shit unload with the four pound
And I throw down  show down
Finna flow down  you toe' down

Cause in my city bitch its kill or be killed <start> Unbeliever I'm an Unbeliever
And the night is begging me to stay.
All the pain and all the pretty rancor
Soul of black to reach the other way.
Alone to carry the burden
Alone to promise the fall
Unbeliever I'm an Unbeliever
As the night surrounds me like fog.
First to rise first to fall
I'll tell you 'bout the scarsmy love
Hammer the nails and tolerate
The nights to come.
Unbeliever I'm an Unbeliever
And the night is begging me to stop.
Gone insane for all the pain I'm guilty
Tried to climb the hills of the unknown.
Alone to bleed and to suffer
Betrayed I ramble in the mist
Unbeliever I'm an Unbeliever
Got to find a reason to resist.
First to rise first to fall
I'll tell you 'bout the scarsmy love
Hammer the nails and tolerate
The nights to come.
Unbeliever I'm an Unbeliever
And the night is begging me to stay.
So much pain and so much pretty rancor
Soul of black to reach the other way.
Alone to born and to suffer
Alone to carry the cross
Unbeliever I'm an Unbeliever
And my heart is beating like a ghost. <start> Me and myself
We're not one of you
We have an alibi
To always get through
Me and myself
My mentor and guide
You're my tormentor
Always by my side
Not going downward mental twin
Not going downward mental twin
Not going downward downward
Instrument evil mental twin
Me and myself
We're king yeah we're Kong
We will let you down
When you're weak we're strong
Not going downward mental twin
Not going downward mental twin
Not going downward downward
Infernal evil mental twin
Me and myself
We do what we claim
We mean what we say
Only shreds will remain
Only shreds will remain <start> Masquerade masquerade
Grab your mask and don't be late
Get out get out
Well disguised heat and fever in the air tonight
Meet the others at the store
Knock on other people's door
Trick or treat they have the choice
Little ghosts are makin' lotsa noise
But watch out
Beware
Listen
Take care
In the streets on Halloween there's something going on
No way to escape the power unknown
In the streets on Halloween the spirits will arise
Make your choice it's Hell or Paradise
Ah It's Halloween
Ah It's Halloween tonight
Someone's sittin in a field
Never giving yield
Sitting there with gleaming eyes
Waiting for a big pumpkin to arise
Bad luck if you get a stone
Like the good old Charlie Brown
You think Linus could be right
The kids will say it's just a stupid lie
But watch out
Beware
Listen
Take care
In the streets on Halloween there's something going on
No way to escape the power unknown
In the streets on Halloween the spirits will arise
Make your choice it's Hell or Paradise
Ah It's Halloween
Ah It's Halloween tonight
Listen now
We are calling you
And there's magic in the air
Magic in the air on Halloween
Black is the night full of fright
You'll be missing the day
What will be here very soon
Changing your way
A knock on your door
Is it real or is it a dream
On trembling legs you open the door
And you scream on Halloween
Darkness
Where am I now
Is there anybody out there
What has happened
Am I in Heaven
Or is it Hell
I can see a light comin'
It's comin' nearer
It's shining
It's shining so bright
It's shining on me
I am the one
Doom's in my hands
Now make your choice
Redeemed or enslaved
I'll show you passion and glory
He is the snake
I'll give you power and abundance
He's the corrupter of man
Save me fron the Evil One
Give me strength to carry on
I will fight for all mankind
Deliverance and peace of mind
But watch out
Beware
Listen
Take care
In the streets on Halloween there's something going on
No way to escape the power unknown
In the streets on Halloween the spirits will arise
Make your choice it's Hell or Paradise
Yeah it's Halloween
Yeah it's Halloween tonight <start> Verra il tempo dei morti
sara un mesto raccolto
mietera fiori e vecchi
strappera le speranze
Avra il pianto delle madri
come suono del non sonno
l'agonia di tutti i sogni
sara il giorno dell'inganno
The time of death will come
it will have unlightened eyes
will come the death again
to take his chop and price
will come the age of thought
to lead upon mankind
as joy longly has died
and lies
it will be the age of nothingness
of anguish and regret
to join love and lies
until the end of hope
the time of the dead has come
to take us too the end
to seal the end of time
Now I am the point
to condemn all my life
what I did and dreamt
all is floating around
all my life and my thoughts
I realize I have lost
Spell my name mortify my pride
what I was dreamt and hoped
in the coming time of the dead
it will be the age of nothingness
of anguish and regret
to join love and lies
will come the time of death
it will have unlightened eyes
will come the age of thought
the blazing sign of end
will come the time of thought
to lead upon mankind
as joy longly has died
and lies
Verra il tempo dei morti
sara un mesto raccolto
avra il pianto delle madri
come suono del non sonno <start> Invective death from the hand
To write the book of evil
Terminus of the overture
Recite the role of power
Schizophrenic reflex vesicate mutilate
Refuse the force on which you die
Myrmidon of Goethe
Abortion of angels that flee for their lives
Animated onslaught expectorated discharge
Elegy of evil visions of light for thou has forgotten
Adulating scripture dominate terminate
Fascist author of Gods
Drubbing of his light fears
Bring forth the atheist sent to inseminate
Aggravated blasphemer insurrected one to tell
Power through defile
Mephisto is coming to claim me for hell
Satan.
Take me MEPHISTOPHELES
Insurrect the shield of Satan
Grant me immortality
To rise <start> Spearhead marching onward
Take my soul sacrificial offering
Your initial strike taken by surprise
Now left alone condemned by my pride
Drained of all emotion body now an empty shell
There's nothing left you've taken all away
Adrenaline flows
Now filled with anger
Just what will be the outcome
Mass confusion tears my mind
Spearhead no victory sublime
Another fallen victim I will not beg to you
Spearhead to which I cannot hold
With clear perception my destiny unfolds
I look to the reflection fail to recognize what's seen
A figure clothed in hatred I pray that this cannot be
Faced by this total stranger aware of your creation
No vision of the former self
Controlled by your instruction
Onward you advance left in a mindless trance
Hypnotized by you will desire is now instilled
Now staring face to face your eyes filled with hate
Held by your contempt both by weakness and by strength
Adrenaline flows
Now filled with anger
Just what will be the outcome
Mass confusion tears my mind <start> History's shown you that answers can't be found above.
Life's great questions are tackled only by us.
Knowledge of mysteries that puzzle you learned men of the cloth.
We've explanations that men of God can't fathom.
Searching for your destiny
In a book that's not reality.
We solve the the Earth's problems
Thorugh our science and technology.
Look back one thousand years when science was in its infancy.
The church had the word the world was forced to heed.
How many times they led astray their flock was shown no mercy.
It's God Will not good enough minds were closed ignorantly.
We are here to shed the light
And your Savior is powerless to fight.
You must realize that your theology is wrong
And we are right.
Accept it for it's proven
And the truth is for all to see.
Scientifically we'll answer any question there could be.
Chorus
Obviously you don't see that we've become your deities.
Can't you see that we are your new priesthood
Blinded by your piety and impotent divinity
Recoginize that we are your new priesthood
Religious dogma that confused and shackled you.
Searching through the good book not knowing what's the truth.
You're only innocent raised servile and unaware.
Unconversant to what is really out there.
Humanity must be erudite but not only from books should it gain insight.
Through practice of sound philosophy comes cognizance of Man's own plight.
This you won't find in your church or your faith
Though science has always attempted to explicate.
Chorus
Bridge
Intelligence is lacking in your realm.
That is why we've come to take the helm.
As you have seen you cannot turn to God for the solution.
Mankind has thrust himself into a sick position lack of vision.
To those who blanket and surround themselves with gullibility
There will be severity.
Yet again we will achieve the answers because we are more than God.
As you kneel and pray
Genuflect our way.
Try and feel your way
Without our guidance someday.
History's shown you that answers can't be found above.
Life's great questions are tackled only by us.
Knowledge of mysteries that puzzle you learned men of the cloth.
We've explanations that men of God can't fathom.
Searching for your destiny
In a book that's not reality.
We solve the the Earth's problems
Thorugh our science and technology.
We see the things that you can't find in your faith.
We are in command with men like Hawing leading the way.
Chorus
which I haven't been spared.
From now on I'll only know lovemaking through
An act of intense terror. <start> Pour submission into me
No church shall bar our paths
Seductive evil drink...
your fill of the bleeding christ in your arms
Where scorn is fed in the blackest fucking soul <start> the storm that the flames of black art have started
the storm which has left the symbol of thousand fires
the storm which gives the thousand minds
the storm which will thunder forever <start> O old man good god careful man of heaven
Keeper of storm clouds make misty weather
And create a tiny cloud in whose shelter I may go <start> Join us
Evil night of an evil death
Epitome of illusion
Sacrifice of the unborn child
Enter the kingdom of darkness
Sodomized for the ritual
For there is nowhere to run
Open the gates to the manifestation
And grant me the powers of darkness
Chorus
Infernal majesty take this dead offering
Feeding the demon seed evil bestowed on me
Exorice the power of dead
Invert my cross of time
The retaim of Satan anarchy
Inside my scared sign
Lucifer bring me the legions of deaths
Abbadon kill until nothing is left
Oblivious to evil
Death of defiled the rituals
Of dreams and disillusion
Unlock the box and gimp in pain
Summon the demons of darkness
Evil Gods that fast with flesh
Prepare me for the dead
Release me from the angels so righteous
For your God is dead
Chorus <start> Take a piece of life in hand you know that life is yours
Indulgence everlasting rage escaping through your pores
Day by day it grows so close intensify the end
You know the day will come we go beyond the end
What's in store we fear no more a blaze of ritual fire
Accept a form of life unknown by death I am inspired
Hoping for a place of worship to pardon all my sins
This is where your life will end beyond begins
Become at one with death it self and see where it will lead
Escaping from domestic selfinflicted greed
Hoping for forgiveness can you take the pain much more
Soon your life will know just what's in store
Craving life beyond the end
To no avail put down your blackened veil
Assuming that your life was pure
Immense disease for which there is no cure <start> Out of the night and in to eternety we fly the wings of a unicorn
through fire ice and storm.
Across the seven seas we fly to find the eye of the venoms crown
there's the point of no return.
Back from the past we're chasing the holy path
through incarnation we will rise again.
Wild horses storming through the night and in to infinity.
Wild horses storming through the sky and in to a Mandrakes Dream.
Lords of the dark in the shade like distant faces in the grave now banished into the void.
All the signs now carved in stone
among theshadows of the night and there's the point of no return. <start> Is this love hate or pain
For me it's all the same
These are the last words I say
Because I really don't care
If you will come with me in there
Where the sun never shines
Oh would you share this world with me
Oh nothing compares to this beautiful dream
Make love with me
On the bed of dead leaves
Through the anguish and filth
Together we wander <start> Bloody rain drippin' down from the sky
Discrepancy the war between low and high
Former ages reign of superstition magic rites
Dark powers influencing people's life
Holy priest absolution for all sins
Crusades in the name of the holy church
Burn in Hell the damned now rot inside
Last chance was contribution suicide
Freedom of thoughts no longer exists
Cries cries cries cries
No place for changes uphold the flag of war
Millions already deceased even more to die
All time is wasted too late to forgive
Now the battle rages until no one is left
Cries cries cries cries
Once so bright the future's now dark
A crowd held down the inferior race
Like the prophecy said don't deny the signs
T R U S T first step into slavery <start> The way I see it
Just ain't your way
You won't listen
To what I have to say
I won't tolerate
The things you want me to see
Say you're here to help
But you just fuck me.
No more lies and deceit
Its not our fault
We are this way
We all have our views
And different things to say
You judge me I judge you
Nothing will change
What are we to do <start> Have you seen me lately
I am the dog sized bird on the tracks
I have an unhealthy handful of options
And a couple of trains on my back
I'm picking at remains of other lives
And watching colors and tragic looking passerbys
I am the dog sized bird
Picking at bones
Losing my nerve
Constantly calculating
There's time between trains I know
There's time between trains I know
And a right moment
To find a new set of tracks
There's time between trains
I know exactly how long
But I'm testing my conviction
And I may be primed for picking at any time <start> Goatfather's son
Sacred holy words of loyalty claiming your salvation
When the timing of the rulers of your life is depending that their words
Are truly reviling you from pain you feel when you wait to die
Your pain
Blinded you sacrifice your mind for their beheading
Of all you are when time is running out
A soldier nothing but a piece in the puzzle
Lead by those you should not have trusted with your life
With violence our life is measured up against the idea of pride
You forget your quest for the new ideas to fill your daily needs
No one lives for anything but earthly matters
No protection is given you if you don't become a slave
In time <start> I come from nothing
You come from nothing
I come from nothing
You come from nothing
You com from nothing
But we are more than nothing
We are not nobodies
I come from nothing
I come from nothing
You come from nothing
You come from nothing
But we are more than nothing
We are not nobodies <start> The moment I laid eyes on you
I knew a close encounter was inevitable.
Now we're alone
Your eyes staring deep into my soul
Together we sit in darkness.
You know I want you
Your voice sounds like a God in head.
You know I am you
Don't ask my name it don't matter at all.
You know that love just ain't my style
I feel the heat of your lust in the air.
We have no choices left
As you walk into the vampire's eyes.
Let me bring it to pain.
You say your love is a spiritual thing
I hear you.
You lick your lips like a lioness
I fear you.
You touch me and my blood runs cold
Am I the hunter or hunted
God put us here together tonight
You can't escape fate.
Let me bring it to pain.
My tongue journeys deep inside you
Your juices arouse me.
I am your slave tonight and forever
Dominate me rape me.
Your orgasm so wild it's a trip
We cum together as one.
You say you gotta have it hard and rough
Is this rough enough
Let me bring it to pain. <start> 
Strong is your hold oh mortal flesh
And now I've fallen to you again
Mighty's the faith that overcomes
But somehow you always seem to win
Stay of execution
Stay of execution
On the straight and narrow path of life
The word always comes to lift me up
Brings me to my feet when I fall
But you lie in waiting to bring me down
Stay of execution
Stay of execution
And so the struggle still goes on
Between the spirit and the flesh
Knowing His Word will make me strong
For the tormenting of my flesh
Stay of execution <start> Shivers herald an upcoming possession
The urges to create set us ablaze
Demonic art sacrificed to the night
A monument of malicious sonority
The most precious gift
For the everlasting cycle
For the beginning and the end
For the comprehensive darkness
For master Satan and ourselves
Millions of insignificant existences
Exceeded by our tones supreme
Melodies older than mortality
Enormous as death itself
The chosen ones have command of the language
That needs neither mouth nor words
Our minost soul transformed into notes
We are element as well as entirety
So what is paradise if not hell <start> When they finally claim you
All matter will cease all dreams will expire
And with a dead angel's touch
And the loss of myself
The vapour will fade
Until the day that I join you
When you finally take yourself
Day will be night all will be nothing
As the flickering candles that lit up our chess
Can burn no more
When the queen has fallen
Now I cower in this hollow room
Acutely aware that the time is approaching
When what I love above all else
Will be only my greatest memory
It's both tragic and symbolic
That in your darkest hour
You can still shine so bright <start> We're wasting precious time
The clock is ticking
Can you hear the countdown
With every hour
Give me the power
I need the strength to carry on
On and on
No more I care to live
When I'm just born to die
We're all born to die
Born to die x
Never before never again
Behold this travesty
Never before never again
Behold adversary x
Befriend my enemies
My pulse is racing
I can hear my heart beat
Is this the last time
You get to be mine
I lack the will to carry on
On and on
No more I care to live
When I'm just born to die
We're all born to die
Born to die x
Never before never again
Behold this travesty
Never before never again
Behold adversary x
No more sorrows no tomorrow's
I've never felt alive before
With every hour
Give me the power
I need the strength to carry on
On and on
No more I care to live
When I'm just born to die
We're all born to die
Born to die x
No more I care to live
When I'm just born to die
Born to die
To die x <start> Der Morgen bricht herein
und scheint durch den Nebel so matt.
Stille herrscht ber die ruhenden Krieger.
Aus einem Hinterhalt schelmig lachend durch das Unterholz
eiserne Mnner bewaffnet mit frchterlichen Waffen.
Sie strmen auf die Teutonische Brut.
Eine Fontne schwarzen Blutes ergiet sich.
Der Ruin kam ber uns letzte Nacht.
Ein riesiger Verlust ist zu beklagen.
In Scharen berkamen sie unser Volk.
Nahmen Leben und Proviant.
Mit unseren letzten Krften
konnten wir sie zurckschlagen.
Es ist unsere Ehre welche ist verletzt
sie mu wiedererobert werden.
Diesem Volk mu der Garaus gemacht werden.
Das Schlachtfeld mu durchsogen sein
von dem unehrenhaften Feindesblut.
Schwerter kreuzen idyllischer Mondschein.
Die Barbaren brechen auf die Ehre zu verteidigen.
Getse von den Bergen nicht fern
Wapen
ertnt von der bestialischen Horde
Krieg.
Blut fliet die Feinde sind machtlos unterlegen
dem Teutonischen Kampfesgeist.
Voller Stolz kehren wir zurck.
Der Kriegsgott war unser Geleit
bei dieser Schlacht welche unsere war.
Er schrfte unsere Klingen
fr das sie besser
durch das bittere Feindesfleisch gleiten
sie erfuhren winselnd
unsere Lust
unsere Lust zum Tten.
Ihre Sterblichkeit erlischt wie ihre Seelen.
Und ihr unehrenhaftes Blut
wird vergiften den Grund. <start> I sit on a rock
Cannot be touched by struggle  confusion
I reclaim my space inside my structure
Look at this point
All is about nothing everything comes near
The remotest parts of the world
By silence
We can dissolve disruptive vibrations
I have to try
Gaia's alive for good
Under my feet the forest
Over me the largest
It's roundness I feel
Lifelong misery
How do we get to Avalon
There is a bridge beyond
Indestructible the earth is a temple
I cannot see what is wrong and
All gods are one
I close my eyes
I'm all around I feel so present
Embracing it's vastness I hold
Facing the world
I become a part of it
I'm not alone anymore <start> Are you feeling well
And are you alone in the house we called our home
I'm still waiting here lost and without a care.
The further you run the closer you are to me.
Well I'm still waiting here
Arms wide and wearing thin
You must be blinded by your own eyes
Surely you understand it's you I despise
And if we hold on to what we had
We could be what everyone has
Just to see the sun rise into the sky
I'd give anything to be closer to you
I'd give everything to be closer to you <start> Oh Warfather on high
I am calling you from the battlefield
And as I take my last breath
I call for the mightiest of miracles
For none but the brave be he king or a slave
With a pounding heart in his chest
Will be worthy to rise and with the Valkyries fly
And ride to the ancient Valhalla
Oh Warfather on high
Listen to my prayer
I lived my life by your rules
Oh let death cover me now
For none but the brave be he king or a slave
With a pounding heart in his chest
Will be worthy to rise and with the Valkyries fly
And ride to Valhalla of old
Chorus
with the Valkyries ride over the battlefield
Ride your horses and come to me
I'm waiting for you to take my soul high in the sky to
Valhalla of old
Valkyries ride over the battlefield
I'm dying and glad to bleed
Because I know today I will take my place with the heroes
in Valhalla of old
For none but the brave be he king or a slave
With a pounding heart in his chest
Will be worthy to rise and with the Valkyries fly
And ride to Valhalla of old
Chorus
with the Valkyries ride over the battlefield
Ride your horses and come to me
I'm waiting for you to take my soul high in the sky to
Valhalla of old
Valkyries ride over the battlefield
I'm dying and glad to bleed
Because I know today I will take my place with the heroes
in Valhalla of old
In The Halls of Valhalla I finally take my place
With my sword and my shield I enter Odin's realm
I'm an immortal spirit now with a heart made of steel
With the gods on high forever I will live and laugh at the
fears of man <start> Music S. Drover G. Drover
Lyrics S. Drover
Trapped beneath  storms volcanic ash is brimming to explode
Buried under walls of ice  dormant lava waits to singe the earth
Detection of seismic refrain's  to forecast the lava flood bane
Unleashing volcanic debris  destruction the world's never seen
Exploding to the velvet sky  magma's force ignites volcanic plight
 feet above  ash plume rises while pyroclactic flows
Screaming and running there is no retreat
Pumice and ash flow  degrees
Erupting below walls of ice to unveil
Ice  lava mixture to floods  no escape
Buried in erupted waste volcanic earth now has sealed its fate
Predictions from forgotten times  discarded into now  the world demise
Detection of seismic refrain's  to forecast the lava flood bane
Unleashing volcanic debris  destruction the world's never seen <start> I've been dreaming every night about strangling all of you
I need some answers now
I ask you a question you must answer
I want to know who he is
You need to tell me
I can't take this anymore
If you don't give me answers
I'm going to chop you into little pieces
Hotwheels miniature t rains Tinker Toys I'll burn you all down
Now we are going to do
Something extremely fun
hwoww yeah
We're going to play a ....
let's play a game
A wonderful game called...
Who is your daddy 
Who is your daddy and what does he do
Who is your daddy and what does he do
Does he fix cars that women crash
Or does he live in New York and drive a cab
Some of your daddies ....
Just work a normal boring desk job
But one of them is a drug dealer and I am really a cop
Who is your daddy and what does he do
Who is your daddy and what does he do 
Does he fix cars that women crash
Or does he live in New York and drive a cab
Wow yeah
Who is your daddy and what does he do x <start> Farewell
Yesterday when we were young
Like a flower in the desert sand
So transient the cycle of life
Chorus
Within a moment of time
Within a while of a years' decline
The brightest of stars above
In nighttime skies divine
Here
It is an everflowing stream
When they are coming to redeem
Us from the night
That never sees the day
Chorus
And when the years passing by
No one will answer no one will cry
The solace in sea of tears
Into a new sunshine
Glory ascending
From days never ending
Unfold your dreams right now
Chorus <start> Einsam ho gret den vakraste av alle
Fanga og lst I ei sorg ingen skjner
Gleden forsvann langt langt der ute.
Ei brennande lyst en ingen hp.
Ho lengtar heim men finn ingen veg.
Ein sorgfull lagnad gymt bak eit smil.
Mardol do fagre for fred do blei ofra
Do solgte din lekam men fann ingen tryst.
Det som glimrar gjer ikkje fred for deg
Gern do ga deg hen og slokka mangt
Eit begjr. Men framleis drypp
Det om natta gull fr dine auge.
Frya od skal do finna nr alt er forbi
D skal do bli sluppen fri.
Inntil den dag finn do inga tryst.
Sjl ikkje I glitrande Brisinghamen.
English translate Brisinghamen
In solitude she cries the most beautiful of them all
Captured and locked in a sorrow no one can conceive
Joy vanished far out there
Burning desire but no hope
She longs for home bu tcan not find a way
A dismal destiny hidden behind a smile
Mardol you glorious sacrificed for peace you were
You sold your flesh but found no comfort
That which glitters does not bring you peace
Gern you devoted yourself
And consumed many desire.
But still in the night
Gold is dripping from your eyes.
Frya Od you shall find when everything ends
Then you shall be set free
Until that day you shall find no comfort
Not even in the shining Brisinghamen <start> Inflict the seed of Eve upon me
The heritage of Cain can't be undone
This my rejection this my denial
That stirs with repulsive mortifications
They attempted to deprive me from my odium of chaos
They threw my wretched body into rivers of purgatory
For such is a consequence of my angelic nature
Abortion of god in my leprous womb
Soiled with the miasma of the bleakest hemisphere
The formless fires of Amenti unfold
Not nearly as frenzy as Discordia that breeds within
Not nearly as frenzy as disorder that I bring
Universe is drained so is my heart
This earth grew weary and dull
Is it the renaissance of my rigid existence
Is there a future for me beyond the stars
I drink to desolation
I drink to your demise
Monarch of neglected kingdom
Oh great despiser of life
Et credo in serpentem
Misterium mysteriorum
In nomen eius Baphomet
Hearken my Ophites
Consume the flesh and drink the blood
Obtain communion with utmost disgrace
Reject the benefits of Eucharist
Disdain the lie let you senses sharpen
Let your eyes see in the boundless dark
Resist not radiant light
Be like comets slashing through the vast skies
Be like ravening wolves unchaining hearts
Now drink to desolation
Drink to god's demise
Monarch of neglected kingdom
Oh great despiser of life
O leo et o serpens
Qui perditor perdes
Sis valens nobiscum <start> As I look upon my life
There's a memory of a child
That I knew so long ago
In a distant point in time
We were once so young and free
That's where I still long to be
In the warmness of a love
That was yours and was mine
Sometimes when alone
I still think of you
Memories Of Another Time
When we were young
And the world was ours
Memories Of Another Time
We stood as one
And we never faltered
Running free under the sun
Our days had just begun
Carefree glances instead of words
Not a worry in the world
Hand in hand
We marched through time
From our childhood and beyond
Every time I close my eyes
You are all that I see
Sometimes when alone
I still think of you
Memories Of Another Time
When we were young
And the world was ours
Memories Of Another Time
We stood as one
And we never faltered
One step that's wrong can throw
Your world into the unknown
One step that's wrong can throw
Your world into the darkness
One voice unheard
Turns to silence in the void
One wheel that turns is heard
In the calm before the storm
Sometimes when alone
I still think of you
Memories Of Another Time
When we were young
And the world was ours
Memories Of Another Time
We stood as one
And we never faltered <start> Instrumental <start> A Buried Crime

agonizing
Global blinding has come in full
Suffocate the remaining percent
Subtract
All is expendable
A thousand points of heat
Bacteria son of disease
Mourning breath ammonia thirst quenching leach
Tapping the network of veins
Genetic harvest in vain
Licking the wounds uncontrollably
Systems of gain
Sour heart reeks casualties
CHAPTER TWO
all the bread has molded fungus dwells inside
Multiple
Estimates
Convincing with their graphic pride
The mask that suffocates bleeds in me
All is to believe but we are pawns poisoned
In quantities
The
Arsenic hysteria
Like fleas on a dog irritating
This
Microwave insomnia
No strength
No heart
No option
Blugeoned with diversions
Concentrated dose
Exterminate the addiction
High vantage point
Chlorine infliction death
No microchip
Shall rest underneath my flesh
I'd prefer the obstacles of death
I will fill the tombs worthy of consequence
CHAPTER THREE
epileptic cancer causing agents
Starved
Lack of nutrition
Will you live this life on calloused knees
Neck broken in
Particles of mass deception forced in
Corrosive sting
Stall
The all seeing eye sees all
The most relevant faction
Foundations fractured
Economic death
Sarcastic devotion runs in excess
Sew my lips and burn my opened eyes
One soul divine
The engines are running mind altering
The most vile of things
Man has ever seen
Inspiring
To know all these
Admiring
My eyes are leaking viciously
Dissecting the harsh anatomy
CHAPTER FOUR
the devils suck the life out
Injecting america with blood disease
The reason and cause my friend no room for vacancy
Decrease the numbers with crack and poverty
Methamphetamine
Cling to this massacre of excuses
Fully aware of the hidden agendas

Silent warfare germ gestapo
All of the seeds condemned
Controlling and disabled
The greed infection in disguise
Behold united lambs of slavery
Rhythm of extremities amplifies
The source is nameless

El camino del guerrero en caminos de revolucion
Yo vengo preparao cargando mi caon
Yo vengo preparao con los santos a mi lado
INJUSTICIA <start> If I could see you now
I know I'd see you all alone
With the weight of the world on your heart
If you could hear me now
I'd tell you that the only thing
Worth fighting for is love
And I'll wait for you
As long as the stars shine
Bright in the night
I'll wait for you
Knowing that someday
You'll wake up and see me by your side
If I could touch you now
You'd remember all the love we shared
Between the times we spent apart <start> human dreams  such a fruitful place to plant the seeds of terror.
child i arise
in your dreams
as a creature  of dread
as a demon  or a wicked witch
what pleases me  i choose
i am the master  of terror
i create your nightmares
child  i am tearing you  apart
my mastery  can not be escaped
black claws tears your mind
black chaos  black terror
child  i am your pain
i'll engrave pain  into your soul
i will set your soul on fire
black flames will rise  as the gate
opens  into the realm  of the dead
here  you will sleep  eternally
and in your never ending dream
i will dance  and laugh
and i will feed
again  and again <start> Fast forward towards astral devastation
Lyrics M. Schulman
As stars and spheres collide
Like embers in a infernal gloom
The universe once so pure and clean
Turns into everlasting fire
The spiritual kingdoms divide
This is the entrance to doom
The past the present the future
Gone in a cosmic destruction
Come join me come join me on the new world odyssey
Come along come along on a dark ride lasting for a lifetime
Into the arms of death
Into the crypts of vanity
The echoes dance until the end
Recall the shadows again and again
I who hold the sights
I who rule the night
Revel in joyful desire
Welcome to my spiral empire
Come join me come join me on the new world odyssey
Come along come along on a dark ride lasting for a lifetime
Summon the screams of thunder
When dimensions fall asunder
Deep below decolourised halls
As the bell of revelation calls
Higher fire  flames of profane desire
The last whispers  from a stillborn quire
Illusions in the glare  of heavenly blaze
A venomous kiss  like a mysterious haze
Into the arms of death
Into the crypts of vanity
The echoes dance until the end
Recall the shadows again and again
I who hold the sights
I who rule the night
Revel in joyful desire
Welcome to my spiral empire
Come join me come join me on the new world odyssey
Come along come along on a dark ride lasting for a lifetime <start> Deadly substance has you out of control
Just one more step and you're six feet in a hole
Cripples your body and destroys your head
C.D.S. will leave you maimed or dead
Play the game and lets see who wins
If you wanna play you'll pay for your sins
Fuck around and you'll soon be admitted
Take a chance and forever in Hell you're committed
Chorus
C.D.S. You can't tell
Just one shot
Straight to Hell
Deadly substance has you out of control
Just one more step and you're six feet in a hole
Cripples your body and destroys your head
C.D.S. will leave you maimed or dead
Now's the time to make up your mind
Steer in the direction that will help you to find
There is more to life than substance abuse
Life is far too short put what you have to use
Chorus
Just one shot and you're dead
Life and death will be served
You will face all the sins you've committed
Just one shot and you're dead
Life and death will be served
Take a chance and you will
Pay with your life you'll die <start> Knight of the swords you of the great old Gods
A new age has just begun
Forged in the fire of hate vengeance and betrayal
The race of man has come to rule
Queen of the swords you of the great old Gods
Darkest lady of the deepest realm
You will know fear sharper than a spear and you'll
be banished from these planes
By the hand of the prince in the scarlet robe
CHORUS
He's sworm to destroy all Gods
by the power of the cosmic balance
He's chosen to save this world
save the race who betrayed his own
A quest in a time unknown
to bring peace forevermore
Survivor with a noble role
The prince in the scarlet robe
King of the swords you of the great old Gods
Summon now your dukes of hell
Faceless lord of chaos your golden sword will not
save you and you will fall to your destiny
By the eye of the prince in the scarlet robe
CHORUS
Now that Gods are no more
Law is ruling the fifteen planes
No more cities in the sky no more oceans of light
Find a new dimension where new Gods can be
created and destroyed again by the eye by the hand
of the prince in the scarlet robe <start> You've compromised your doctrines
You've surrendered yourself to fashion
Come back to your faith come back to grace

He sang with us and loved others
The death of obsession
The blood relationship creates such a rotten demise
Oh Lord
Such blackness portrays the love of a machine
I did not want you to join this culture
So how can you be so proud
Pray to the heavens with whatever it takes
I wish to shine this light back upon you
It's obvious that apocalyptic barriers  no mercy to fashion
You've compromised your doctrines
You've surrendered yourself now <start> She came from the lake of eternal fire
With tears of blue oil on her cheeks
She sang ancient tunes in harmony
And danced through the mist in the fullmoon light
She whispered stories of her fantasies
Erotic tales of love in forbidden words
With her pale white cheek against mine
Kissed me with her sweet lips tasting like wine
Bring in the wine
Light up the candles
Erotic lust
Unveiling the dusk
Roses in black
Wings of filth
Dead skin so smooth
Blood sweeter than I've ever understood
Love me eternal
Sleep with me in the autumn rain
Love me infernal
As the sky turns black again
Love me eternal
Sleep with me in the autumn rain
Love me infernal
As the sky turns black...
Withe teeth penetrated her neck
Long red nails scratch her beautiful breasts
An everlasting romance in blood
An erotic act from dusk till dawn
My princess lay beside my feet
So innocent naked and sweet
Now spread your wings and fly away
Before the sun rises and the night turns to day <start> Bonustrack
Original by Carnage <start> Dimensional gates align
Choking while living <start> This is a tale long to live but alas so short to tell by the wind and by time
By everything that flees
A torment of my liking exploring extremes
All thoughts secluded as fear stalks its blooded soil
In the winding path where a chain now rattles
With links merely death can break
Stains of pride derelict
In feverish visions of agonizing light
Pulsating rhythms unpure
So pound the drum and strike the chords of chaos
So scream out to the skies
Of chaos and eternal night
Never is the dark any threat to my existence
Comforting ravens claws grip the stars that fell tonight
The stealth of infinite beauty
Nevertheless heaven fell tonight
Racing along with the strangled teardrop
Life's elixir in benevolent lust
Slit open the throat that is virtue
Let fire ravage its caverns with joy
Ardent but silent in twilight resigned
Delivered from virtue in vehement plight
Yet ask not of your vanity
The hooved agitator in your creed
To let loose all the stars of heaven
Stray across the vault your seed
Concealed cravings must through fulfillment be broken
Hide no longer behind the veil of unconvincing lies
So pound the drum and strike the chords of chaos
So scream out to the skies
Of chaos and eternal night
I've seen fires waving patterns
Forging ornaments hidden from a world of distrust
Grace through hatred
Of chaos and eternal night
In shadows now vengeful waiting out your bitter foe
The mirror distorts
Sinful is the perceiving eye
Tearless in nondescript form
Scarlet secrets tell of nightmarish fear
Illusions that speak of endless night
A venture in terms of one hazardous journey
Into chaos and eternal night
Deliver me from virtue
Hidden no more beneath tender veil of lies
And let 'em all out
Unseen and sinful
Of chaos and eternal night <start> When the sunlight breaks the dawn
The cross on which he's nailed drips with blood
His body is mangled emaciated
The downfall the final defeat
The dark one is the night
Searching for a body of the dead
Smealling the air of passed life flesh
Formless body limbs were scorched in the sun
Fornicate the holy reaping the innocent dead
Aaaaarrggghh questions irse when hours pass by
Who bestole the holy grave morbid truth I search for thee
When the night falls in the unknown travels from grave to grave
Untamble bestial sin blasphemy of the holy flesh
Infernal sights the lord of flies disgraced his grave
Bloody dawn facing evil was the fear of christ
Infernal sights Now his corpse is stolen by necrophiliac
Bloody dawn Death is more present than god ever can be
When the sunlight breaks the dawn
The cross on which he's nailed drips with blood
His body is mangled emaciated
The downfall the final defeat
Aaaaarrggghh questions irse when hours pass by
Who bestole the holy grave morbid truth I search for thee
When the night falls in the unknown travels from grave to grave
Untamble bestial sin blasphemy of the holy flesh
The dark one is the night
Searching for a body of the dead
Smealling the air of passed life flesh
Formless body limbs were scorched in the sun
Fornicate the holy reaping the innocent dead
Infernal sights the lord of flies disgraced his grave
Bloody dawn facing evil was the fear of christ
Infernal sights Now his corpse is stolen by necrophiliac
Bloody dawn Death is more present than god ever can be <start> The Feast of Fools 
As January slipped into the grip of winter
A leather leash tightened round the throat of fate
Amidst the flock disease and dementia
Night was blighted more than ever before
With screams of lust and obscene adventure
And scenes of raw debauch
The darkness was aroused with every kiss
And all who fell under it's spell
Were one foul step from the abyss
One foul step from the abyss
Sacred village there in All Hallows Fair
Feared the templars and their Queen
For Lilith compared to a royal nightmare
When she steered their tempestuous
Feverdreams
The beast was loose and beauty party
To the horrors of this sonorous whore
A seducer Medusa
A frozen Hecate cloned
Stealing seed here needs were like a cancer
Growing stronger with each whimpering dog
knelt before her thirteen necromancers
Called from desert sands to this land of opportunity
The darkness was aroused with every kiss
And all who fell under its spell
Were one foul step from the abyss
One foul step from the abyss
love was drugged by a copious vendor
A train of servants for here decadent games
Purring on rugs in fugs of opiate splendor
Vain Lilith spread her wings again
Stars they gasped and comets in ovation
Lit the towers their very presence declared
They watch with lust despair and veneration
For the Goddess scatted naked there
The painted eye of the storm
Plagues of sin played to win
All hearts and souls in thrall
to her embraced her fatal whims
Desire meant to conquer all
Until that fateful day 
With a force blessed by the Kings of Hate
Facing winter gray to disintegrate
Once noble halls
The villagers in a belligerent horde
Fraught daughters fanning flames
Rose like pillars for their militant Lord
Thoughts of slaughter haranguing hot veins
They assailed the fort beyond the woods
as the howling broke on the stroke of midnight
Many lost their sanity at what they fought
Amidst those walls creed of dementia
Annihilated by sheer weight of the surge
Put to the sword freed from their calenture
The great estate was given straight to the church
Of Lilith no limb ranked amongst the dead
But that she drank the blood of many men
That dark night it was said <start> the guests have gone
our hearts have beaten with the last song sung tonight
resilience coursing through our veins
we're picking up the pieces as we watch them fall
like a cannonball
we watch you fall
x
bury me deep in this mausoleum
bury me to my neck so i can't feel my limbs
we're not going to make it
not this time
when you say that could you look me in the eye
let's paint this town in a sheet of red
and burn like passion in our hands
x
we'll burn with passion
we'll burn with passion
we'll burn
come on baby
and just let it go <start> I

The darkness is on the way
Will I lose my way Don't worry...
Take it easy and learn from the history
Do you always feel intense cry of my soul
Feel and get it
To win cry out everyday
I show the anger and the dirtiness
I think that it's an important thing to keep on fighting
I show the power and the weakness
It's necessary do not take a restcarry on
Can I reach there before long
It's all right because I'm strong
I will be defended by my law
Do you understand why I fight
Do you understand what I find
I wanna bask in the tender light
I will confront the other side in my soul
Feel and break it
To win cry out everyday
I show the pleasure and the sadness
I think that it's an important thing to keep on fighting
I show the power and the craftiness
It's necessary do not take a restcarry on
I show the anger and the dirtiness
I think that it's an important thing to keep on fighting
I show the power and the weakness

Scum fucking bitch cum guzzling whore
eating the dick like a revolving door
you suck on my cock but don't swallow shit
your nothing but a worthless ass bitch
So you've been raped beaten and stabbed
Body contorts rip you in half
I defecate on your blood splattered mass
Defiling the corpse suffer in death
Evisceration  rape the bloody whore
Ripped up body  now I crave for more
Endless suffering  I will rape you in the ass
Skin forsaken bruised and naked
My hands are shaking I will kill again
Stalking the dark shroud of night
to claim a victim for my crypt
severed heads decorate the lair
which I'm on with sin
Grinding chunks of flesh into
a red and meaty paste
Feasting on these bitches pieces
soothes my minds decay
Come unto me objects of mindlessness
torture's too good for you
Come unto me objects of mindlessness
torture's too good for you
Come unto me objects of mindlessness
torture's too good for you
Read into my ghastly deeds
and encounter sickness
slaughter of disease filled whores
Filth this world don't need. <start> Let not the sun go down on my wrath
I let it shake the world
Vengeance is the grudge I bear
Flag of reckoning unfurled
You are the architect
Of your own demise
So smile no more
I am the gatekeeper
And you are mine for evermore
Chorus
Come greet the reaper
You know the time is nigh
This is the day of reckoning
Your time to die
Brave men they spin in fear
At the sound of my voice
Say goodbye to life so dear
You no longer have a choice
Burnt black and silent
Rust and blood
Upon my reaper's blade
I come collect the tolls
Gather up all the debts unpaid
I call when you least expect
But when you deserve it the most
Behold the timekeeper
The end is getting close
Chorus
The dead no longer have
A cross to bear
The dead no longer have
Need to despair
Death has come
And set the snare
Death will come
When you are unaware
The misbegotten have the gall
To think them safe and sound
They try to cheat the reaper
Scatter hide no matter found
The wheel of life is standing still
For them it turns no more
Now comes the soul keeper
And you become my whore
Chorus <start> A blessing in tragedy
Burning what's left in effigy
Wreckage when there's nothing left
Wreckage the birthright of regret
Wreckage when there's nothing left
A place where truth can hide
A place where falling angels survive
A place where fear rusts though pride
A place where heroes go to die
Self delusion self destruction falling short so short of faith
Wreckage when there's nothing left
Wreckage the birthright of regret
Wreckage when there's nothing left
A place where truth can hide
A place where falling angels survive
A place where fear rusts though pride
A place where heroes go to die
An empty shell a carcass left of greed
And empty shell in the shade grows another weed
And you wear the scars well merciless liar
How many times till your shadow haunts you too
Wreckage when there's nothing left
Wreckage the birthright of regret
Wreckage when there's nothing left
A place where truth can hide
A place where falling angels survive
A place where fear rusts though pride
A place where heroes go to die
A place where fear rusts though pride
A place where heroes go to die
An empty shell a carcass left of greed
And empty shell in the shade grows another weed <start> Come forth demons Breathe through the walls that entomb you
The sword of my armour
My wind of of something darker
The hole of my grave dug deeper
The hymms of my funeral get louder
The evil tyrant I was I am
Laughter for lust I greed
The spells of my spirit
This world I now leave
My sword might be rusty
My mind may be old
But no one can change my faith
It has been foretold
I am a harbour for restless demonsouls
I have left nothing
Two demong eight Spirits <start> Tell me another story tell me another story
Everyone has stories
They bore me they bore me
The ends are feeling nervous
Their stories they bore me
Everyone's got skeletons in their closet
Don't ask me where they got it
You should've told the truth a long time ago
Liar liar I told you so
Digging up the corpses once again
Tell me another story digging up the corpses
That haunts you that haunts you
Digging up the corpses once again
Tell me another story digging up the corpses
Once again corpses corpses once again
Corpses digging up the corpses once again
Back to another story
That haunts me that haunts me
Someone sheared the wolf from the story
That haunts you that haunts you
Everyone's got skeletons in their closet
Don't ask me where they got it
You should've told the truth a long time ago
Liar liar I told you so
Digging up the corpses once again
Tell me another story digging up the corpses
That haunts you that haunts you
Digging up the corpses once again
Tell me another story digging up the corpses
Once again corpses corpses once again
Corpses digging up the corpses once again
Digging digging digging digging
Up the up the up the up the
Corpses corpses corpses corpses
I should have never let you in
Your soul is full of sin
Now your starting to begin
Digging up the corpses again
Your stories bore me
Digging up the corpses once again
Tell me another story digging up the corpses
That haunts you that haunts you
Digging up the corpses once again
Tell me another story digging up the corpses
Once again corpses corpses once again
Digging up the corpses corpses once again
Going going going going gone <start> Burning out the death
Across the USA
Collecting spines
On a killing spree
Seattle to Berlin
Spitting out remains
California demons
Evil from LA
Everybody sucks
Alot of maggot feed
Obituary punks
Flock of ballless sheep
Exploding in your face
Unholy hand grenade
We're california demons
Evil from LA <start> How come all the things you say just don't make sense to me
Why do we spend so much time just refusing to agree
If you say you like something you know I'll say I don't
and when you want to do something that's fun you know I won't
Why is it always my turn to take care of this mess
I don't think it's fair to say I'm always doing less
You don't know what I do so I don't think you should moan
and if you're so much better you can do it on your own
Nobody loves me like I do not even you
Nobody needs me the way I do not even you
Nobody knows what I'm going through not even you
You always make me feel like everything I do is wrong
and things would be much easier if we could get along
but every time I criticize you you overreact
please don't tell me one more time that opposites attract
that has to be the biggest fucking lie I've ever heard
Don't tell me to shut my mouth I haven't said a word
You're the one that started it and you know that I know
so what's the use there's no excuse you know that no means no
chorus
Is there really any point in working this all out
all we ever do these days is fight and scream and shout
Maybe we should give it up and just call it a day
I can't think of anything I even want to say
I've done my share of caring and it isn't any good
I'm sick and tired of feeling like I've been misunderstood
so give me one good reason and I'll stay right here with you
I can't take another day I don't know what to do
Chorus <start> We all know why you are still hanging on to this
Either to run away from your family or to be
Something you can no longer be
I think maybe time has caught up with you
And it's time to get your priorities straight
And to take what you've learned and pass it down
And those old menthey lied to us
What happens on the road always comes home
And if it didn't then there is no point
Other than narrowly avoiding divorce three or so times a year
With no life lived to show for it
Sometimes I want to live again
Just like the kids I traveled with
Oh so much more to do so much more to see
But I think maybe time has caught up with me
You see when her eyes light up
It all seems so trivial to ever leave again
I will never leave again <start> In Hell s corrupt and sunken halls the rising shall begin
The bane of man immortal  the parade of broken dead.
With greed our worldly master so now pain will be our guide
As the fallen ones await us all to welter by their side.
Iron dreams of human jackals and our final fate is cast
To slave in endless fire as you cringe before the lash.
Blinded by the darkness as you pray for his return.
But in your soul you fear he s just another one who'll burn.
With greed our worldly master now pain will be our guide
As the fallen ones await us all to welter by their side.
Iron dreams of human jackals  our final fate is cast
To slave in endless fire as you cringe before the lash.
Does evil lie in waiting to extract his heavy toll.
Will bowing to the pulpit bring the cloven to their goal
But if he s the work of mankind and the beast our morbid dream
This dying planet is our heaven and our hell remains the same. <start> We're still one step ahead of you
I still believe in the R and R dream
R and R as primal scream
Tied to the Puritan Ethic
Nonsympathetic to spastics
After all this still a lonely bastard.
Eggheads boneheads queue
Queue for them
We were early and we were late
But still live at the witch trials.... <start> These secrets I'll bring to you
Are of thorns and ice
Hush.
Don't tell them nothing not a word
Hush
Don't tell them nothing not a single thing that I've said to you
Hear all my secrets
Tell all the lies
Hear all my secrets
Tell all the fucking lies
Can you hear it scream
Deep deep inside
Hush
Now listen carefully here it comes
Hush
It's what I keep inside this is the crime that I've tried to hide
Hear all my secrets
Tell all the lies
Hear all my secrets
Tell all the fucking lies
Can you hear it scream
Deep deep inside
Envy...Sloth...Gluttony...Wrath...Pride...Lust...Greed
These secrets I'll bring to you
Are of thorns and ice
These secrets I'll give to you
Will turn virtue to vice
These secrets I'll bring to you

Are of thorns and ice

These secrets I'll give to you

Will turn virtue to vice

Can you hear it scream
Deep deep inside
I'll tell you only once <start> Seidmannen klatrer opp i tre

Took my soul
In his hands
My mind got dark
Mind got dark
In his hands
When did I begin
To follow the shadows
They fill my dreams with pain and sadness
When did I begin
To feel the sorrows
Then I laid my soul into your hands
He said sweet words
Said sweet words
With his voice
He seduced me softly
Seduced you
With his voice
When did I begin
To follow the shadows
They fill my dreams with pain and sadness
When did I begin
To feel the sorrows
Then I laid my soul into your hands
Once times were not so dark
But then the shadows took hold
Of my soul
Since then I feel
My mind's lost in madness
Lost my soul
In the dark
Lost my mind

Lyrics by Mortiis.
Music by Ihsahn and Samoth.

Once our lord has come again
all black hearts will celebrate
the darksome fiend
in the kingdom of sorrow.
Nocturnal fiends
the beings of the night and shadows
calling forth the pure spirit
of the night.
Our reign may come secretly.
Your Lord's castle is gone.
His glory is no more
and nothing can stop the purifying.
They remember how you conjured
all those years of sorrow.
Blasting winds of darkness conquer.
Dark lords and their minions coming through.
Hate and sin to remain.
Empty hearts fearing thy name.
Darkness hammers through on the priests.
Darkness hammers forward on the cross.
Servants of God we will desecrate your coward race
with darkness.
Darkness hammers through on the priests.
Darkness hammers forward on the cross.
Servants of God we will desecrate your coward race
with darkness.
Once our lord has come again
all black hearts will celebrate
the darksome fiend
in the kingdom of sorrow.
When he returns his spirits must choose purity.
When he conquers kingdoms of death
our dead shall all reign again.
Our reign may come secretly.
Your Lord's castle is gone.
His glory is no more
and nothing can stop the purifying.
They remember how you conjured
all those years of sorrow.
Awakened from the shadows to create.
Riding with me and with all his chosen.
Our lord to be has come again.
Riding from the past.
Little you know your life fades. <start> RING RING

as the earth has seen the coming
of our black domain
The lands are shrouded by the lunar shine
that now will be perpetual successor
of the radiance of the past
The world turns to black
Our army stands tall
Disposed to seat
Our final attack
Pathetic fear and apprehension fill
the hearts of the
feeble lambs once shielded by their decrepit reiuge
Their wretched shepherd has been devoured
by the savage wolves and
Now they realize their scoffing destiny has come
The world turns to black
Our army stands tall
Disposed to set
Our final attack

Feel shame for your pityful human form
May your soul be purified
By my Deadly kiss of death
The world turns to black
Our army stands tall
In fury and hate
From behind comes the sword <start> From the shadows you spit your rotten words
Killing His name spit in His face
Crucify crucify legacy of blasphemy blasphemy
Nail yourself to your cross of lies
Nail yourself to your cross of lies
I fight to hold my head above this sea of heresy of heresy
I watch the blind living completely hopeless lives
It sickens me
I refuse to give in for your prize I will not believe in your lies
I refuse to give in for your prize
I will not believe in your lies or give in for your prize
I refuse your worthless worthless worthless prize
I will always fight for You I will always stand for truth
I will fight for You I will always stand up
I will stand for truth
I will fight for You I will always stand up
I will stand for truth
I refuse <start> Silent screams  beaten and torn
Sanctify  this life of scorn
Innocence withdrawn in fear
Night grows cold and twilight's near
But the light I see is none
Just a spectrum of unreal colours
Which appears before my eyes
For you neither to see nor to feel
Shattered scattered  remnants of life
What can be extracted from nothing
What can be found within the emptiness
Within the emptiness from which I am fed
I deal in pain  all life I drain
Cherished  the grandeur of melancholy
Always and never  the skyline seems so unreal
If I had wings would I be forgiven
If I had horns would there be flames to show my cry
Laughing and crying  nothing remains
No future and no past
No one could foresee
The end has come so fast
And I reach my hand towards this ocean of despair
To grant my soul a lifetime in hell <start> Fight the enemy deep inside
The oppressor buried inside my mind
His strength is growing day by day
While mine seems to be slipping away
Time guiltless time  Flawed design
Poisoned mind  Don't save me
No more laws  Hopeless cause
Ruthless crime  Don't save me
Thoughts barrage me left and right
These voices command me day and night
Slamming my head against the walls
Pain the only solace at all
Time guiltless time  Flawed design
Poisoned mind  Don't save me
No more laws  Hopeless cause
Ruthless crime  Don't save me
If it's too late
Would somebody send me a sign
It's too late
Degenerative state of mind
Death's ominous wicked laugh
Scream as they bind me to the rack
Stiff Frozen to the core
Quartered Torn my steeds of war
Time guiltless time  Flawed design
Poisoned mind  Don't save me
No more laws  Hopeless cause
Ruthless crime  Don't save me <start> It's everything what's wrong with it
It's everything what's wrong with us
Null rictus grin beyond death
And it's after me
So insane suzerain
And he's calling
Nothing is over nothing is over nothing is over nothing is over
Come see with me as everything turns
Nothing is over nothing is over nothing is solved it only starts over
You'll see with me as everything burns
What comes after
What comes after me
A history of love and pain
In this story it's all the same
Void rictus grin stand in sin
Rule the rulers
Blood on the plains suzerain
And he's screaming
Nothing is over nothing is over nothing is over nothing is over
Come see with me as everything turns
Nothing is over nothing is over nothing is solved it only starts over
You'll see with me as everything burns
Nothing is over nothing is over nothing is over nothing is over
I'll be set free free from this memory
What comes after
What comes after me
Nothing is over nothing is over
You'll see with me as everything burns
Nothing is over nothing is over nothing is over nothing is over
I'll be set free free from this memory
What comes after what comes after me
What comes after me what comes after me
What comes after me <start> It's not the river that flows
but the water.
It's not the years that pass
but we do.
Between wind and water
between the devil and the deep blue sea
we hope for comfort from the beyond.
We call forth spirits anxiously
to tell us that our world will last
or tell us there's a place to stay
when the universe is lost
and paradise so far away.
The dawn of Doom will unveil
the unknown from the other side.
Those who walk the shadows
those who walk the night.
Ravens and rats crows and bats
sent ahead as their myrmidons
tell of darkest times to come.
And tales and legends will prove true
at the end of our dominion
at the setting of the century
at the end of our millenium
The dawn of doom will unveil
the unknown from the other side.
Those who walk the shadows
Those who walk the night. <start> Instrumental <start> 
Dying felt so goddamn good today
If I was ever alive well it's hard to say
It was kissing my eyelids and burning my face away
Dying felt so goddamn good today
We dance the electric Pagan Love Song
We hunt with the children paling in the catacombs


Eating dead flowers bleeding in a strange daze
I was cutting throats and eating tears
Smiling in a ruined age
Douse my love everything with gasoline
Grave flower blooms at your red light death scene
We dance the electric Pagan Love Song 
We hunt with the children paling in the catacombs
Trippin' on real blood in strange sunshine
Have you felt such weight upon your eyes
Sister I been trippin' in your sky
I woke up adrift in a Technicolor bliss
Ten million miles high  
I'm a Christian zombie by daylight 
Satan he come trippin' 'round midnight
Circle jerkin' redneck truckers' dream 
You scream I scream
Everybody screams for morphine <start> The ultimate voyage of spiritual terror
Lyrics M. Schulman
Taste and inhale the divine electric air
Breathe in breathe out  breathe in again in ecstasy
Forget the enigma and close your shattered eyes
Exhale and descend as happiness dies...
Born then reborn in a timeless sphere
Where mournful flames feed the forsaken
Carried away by the arms and minds of madness
When giving birth to the powers of sadness
Hail hail hail  computerized
Hail hail hail  stigmatized
Obey obey obey  you will be dehumanized
Free your mind and enter the pincode of life
Cross the bridge and await the crucial answer
Blistering thunder replaces the hours spent
Everlasting pain here from the future sent
Hail hail hail  computerized
Hail hail hail  stigmatized
Obey obey obey  you will be dehumanized
Forget the enigma and close your shattered eyes
Exhale and descend as the stairways to happiness dies
Step inside step inside the labyrinth
Grab the rope follow it until the end
Take your thoughts and reflect your desire
Escape and enjoy the black terrestrial fire
Hail hail hail  computerized
Hail hail hail  stigmatized
Obey obey obey  you will be dehumanized <start> Time for Tears  Caught in fire
Time for Dreams  Freed from the flames
Betray your roots
Create virginal life for the future
The gate of illumination is closed
Recklessnes a loss
Create the angels of your imagination
Like the ashes in the wind
Like the ashes in the wind  Like the ashes in
The wind
Time For Tears  Caught In Fire
Time For Tears  Just For Salvation
Time For Tears  Caught In Fire
Time For Tears  Just For Salvation
Like the ashes in the wind  Like the ashes in
The wind
Time For Tears  Caught In Fire
Time For Tears  Just For Salvation
Time For Tears  Caught In Fire
Time For Tears  Just For Salvation
The silence of the night piercing reality
Humanity never hoped for you
Enemies mistrust you
Your ashes burned on holy soil
Much time invested into the past
Like the ashes in the wind
Time For Tears  Caught In Fire
Time For Tears  Just For Salvation
Time For Tears  Caught In Fire
Time For Tears  Just For Salvation
Time For Tears  Time For Tears
