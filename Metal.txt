Unholy land greets her with fog and death
The further the worse - anxiety whispers
More subtle than scent the sense of hunting is
In a labyrinth of crashed memories
Memory dances among the ashes
Fear and horror biting deep
Anxiety whispers Anxiety screams
Fear and horror biting deep
Pyres burning, sword is cutting
Painfull pleasures lick with their tongues
Out from here comes evil
Out from here gushes blood
Out from here sips poison
Out from here pain and suffering
The only just ones screamed in savage madness
False prophets with love offered pain
Prayers bringing an overwhelming fear
Meticulous intrigues, ignorance and humiliation
Inculcated hatred against everything about the magic
Soaking through every world
Trapped waves hitting the ruins
But there is always someone for the dark wisdom to surviveI'm down towards my stage, beloved,
Where splashing voices murmur
To the nearby distance;
Audible for only my soul's ears.
When all the silent life gets words
To whisper in its ailing tone
Of unheard tales and fears
I'm calming down from life and listen.
"Come and hear my views of another world
Beneath the vestige of truth.
Come and live the myths from the other land
Don't fear to lay down your pride."
The soundless forest breathes time
Like if there'd be no time
In all human progression;
Audible for only my soul's ears.Weaklings,
You are not the only one
Dreamers,
I wish you were all gone
Losers of faith
Grievers of the heart
All the purity of sin
Inner strength
To die for a cause
A martyr's death
An old conscience
Cleansed in blood
A burning obsession
A cold hearted devotion
See into the eyes of evil
And see through the eyes of hell
Losers of faith
Grievers of the heart
All the purity of sin
Inner strength
To die for a cause
A martyr's death
An old conscience cleansing in bloodA wooden cup
And a crown of thorns
Will set up the stage for the cross
I rent a room next door
There is nothing more
No further voices to hear
I'll be free
It doesn't matter anymore
That someone's knocking at my door
I've known it long before
The Galilean's on the floor
Shame on me
Shame on me
I'm a tool and nothing more
I can feel it's getting nearer
Images they'll turn out clearer
Creeps in and out of your mind
I'm destiny personified
I know there's something more behind
But is it really justified
To sacrifice
To crucify
The rescue of the human kind
Sadly sings destiny
Sadly sings destiny
"For ages I've been waiting
Now spring is in the air
Let it in"
Repeat
I hear them howling hear them scream
The raging mob turns mad it seems
The king's in town
We need a crown
I think we all know
How it ends
So we're not going take it longer
So all I know is I don't care
Sp we're not going take it longer
Now we are aware
I can feel it's getting nearer
Images they'll turn out clearer
Creeps in and out of your mind
I'm destiny personified
I know there's something more behind
But is it really justified
To sacrifice
To crucify
The rescue of the human kind
Sadly sings destiny
Sadly sings destiny
"For ages I've been waiting
Now spring is in the air
Let it in"
Repeat
There I tie the ass
There I tie the colt
Begging for a last chance
I hear the voices say
"We get him home tonight
And that's all you need to know"
I'm alone
So I can't stand it any longer
And I don't want to see it all
Nazarene your vision will come true
Will come true
They'll get you
I can feel it's getting nearer
Images they'll turn out clearer
Creeps in and out of your mind
I'm destiny personified
I know there's something more behind
But is it really justified
To sacrifice
To crucify
The rescue of the human kind
Sadly sings destiny
Sadly sings destiny
"For ages I've been waiting
Now spring is in the air
Let it in"
RepeatThe media is a tool designed to mold us into slaves
Drugging us into an empty, apathetic daze.
The trick is that we think that everything is going fine
But the truth to our reality lies buried in the mind
I don't give a fuck about the Hollywood elite;
I don't really care if models can't fucking eat.
I don't give a fuck a fuck about which movie is on top.
But what I really know is that the shit has got to stop.
Consumer appetites are never satisfied in full,
ause the objects that they buy can simply never fill the void.
A constant need for meaning, and accumulating shit,
drives the lust in their obsession just to get another fix.
I don't give a fuck about the TV ratings game,
The Real World is not a party, just a place for the insane.
If that reflects reality, then pass another drink
You try to be a millionaire, I'll vomit in the sink.
What the fuck is left to try,
on an avaricious nation on an economic high?
If Rome could last 500 years,
who then will throw the wrench inside our gears?
The bottom line is money on the Western power scene,
where celebrities and porn can let the population dream.
They're pathetic human living in an advertising glut,
who devour with a passion what the mainstream vomits upCome forth!
From the void beyond the stars
From the blackened shores Thee arrive
Thou art ov gods
Yet supreme above them all
Thou art mocked and blessed
Speak ov me not as one
Speak ov me not as none
Speak ov me not at all
For I am continual
Crowned and conquering child
Cast aside the prophets and false gods ov Thy ways
From the outer space
When TONUAL cross NAGUAL
Beyond becoming, Thou hast become...
Speak ov me not as one
Speak ov me not as none
Speak ov me not at all
For I am continual
Let me reign as a god among slaves!
Spirit clad in gold
Seraphs incarnate
Shake loose the shackles ov a million years
Shildren ov Seth
Blast wide the portals
Unveil the raptures
Ov Thy kingdom
Speak ov me not as one
Speak ov me not as none
Speak ov me not at all
For I am continual
Let me reign as a god among slaves!
Io Khepesh!
Io Nubti!
Io Akhakh!
Io Simai!There is a god and I bow and you will hate me for it
Duty to humble my soul to a speck of dust and you'll hate me for it
Ageless understanding of love from the heavens and you'll hate me for it
Serenities balance is my innermost peace and you will hate for it
Your world is against the spirits, this is day is against the spirits
Your world is against the spirits, this is day is against the spirits
I gladly detach my soul from the lies that sicken this day
Disregarding the metric wickedness that decays my inner space
There is something inside myself that can't become this sickness
Reminded once more that the quest for the top is coldness
I will love God of Zion with all my heart and you will hate me for it
Intentions will be so helpless and you will hate me for it
I will love through resurrecting eyes and you will hate me for it
Self exultation is the opiate of the massesSavage sphere, killing floor
Spiritual spite in this one coursed world
cluttered mass - one takes four
decadence our daily bread, our overall
This is why earth coincides
The pestilence of life,
the plague of mankind
existence destroys
Warpath, killing floor
lunatic hordes in a deaf, dull world
endless pain - one takes all
this is our gift behind shelter walls?
Start up, this new will
this that feeds our virous drill
structure death, caustic trays
this is your philosophy?
now this is why
earth coincides
The pestilence of lies
the plague of our mankind
a severe taste of failing
the end of human race
existence is pain
One world one place to contradict its brains
when lobbyism rules the world and causes killing pain
One kind, one man - to devastate
a ground of nature lovely that has lost its purity
- did you forget?
Our seas will dry, all life shall die
dead birds will be raining from a blackened sky
I end, I'll go to a world of thrones unknown
an endeavor so wrong, what have we done?
keep convenience , deny mortality
Conform, consume your insanity
live on your lifes resembling leprosy
let's eat the world, until we'll eat ourselfs
without meI have an addiction - I can't stop killing
Ending peoples lives is so fulfilling
A burning urge to murder makes me mad
Mutilating and defiling every victim I've had
I've left a mountain of bloody bodies in my days
Atrocities blend together in a crimson haze
So they put this psychopath back into society
I've raped, I've killed, I've desecrated
Locked away, I'm monitored and regulated
This system doesn't care where I've been
I'm really sick, but then they turn me loose again
I butchered a young boy like a farm fresh pig
I ate his tender buttocks and penile twig
Guess what happened when the law caught me?
They slapped my hand and then they set me free
I should be put to death or locked away forever
But legal loop holes just keep me so clever
A serial killer freed through revolving doors
No consequences, so I kill and slaughter more
I'll torture, molest, murder and cannibalize
I bathe in blood because justice has blind eyes
A wolf again walking among abandoned sheep
With zeal I fucked her mouth, cunt, and ass
I know it's wrong but I had such a fucking laugh
After I came in her I gutted the bitch
And I'll do it again if I ever get the itchA melody.
So charming beautiful and short
Picks wind to bind and sound so lonely
In the lowering sky among the clouds
The sky ships never knowing rest
My shadow, echo to remain... maybe...
In times no hands to join again
And paths will lay apart in sleep
So dreamless, filled with the ice wind
>From somewhere, wouldn't like to know
Just smile and watch the storm advent...
I am mortal on this ruthless day
Crashed by its steal jaws being downtrodden to his own trace
Faceless but still having my will
Though watching this eternal rain
At the edge now
Just to make a step
Down the road I'm meant to be on
So you thought "I can't fly"
And that appears to be so easy
Leave me, I've chosen
I take this day
With all its hate and despair
So lifeless, gray and exitless
The last day among the lost days
In this hell where I am the only lie
Forever lie like you are
Waiting for the sunrise
The step to the endless nightHver en tere er frosset, ver sjel er lenket, vert hat er blodig.
All glede er svunnet, all latter er forsvunnet, alt liv skal ende I dod.
I et kalt og ode landskap, skal den sorte horde tre frem,
Ver herre skal stige opp for all tid, reise sitt rike igjen.
Ver kamp skal belonnes, vere navn skal prises,
Vere sinn skal dra den grene, og hans kjorlighet skal evig ge tapt.
All moral skal forkastes, do vil men do dor av skam.
Ne er tiden kommet, ja knus de godes ord,
La oss for alltid bli herskere pÃµ denne jord.WELCOME TO MY WORLD - SO COLD AND DARK
BUT EVEN COLDER AND DARKER IS MY BLACKENED HEART
AND LIKE EVEREY NIGHT - WE`LL PLAY THE GAME AGAIN
YOU WILL RUNN AND I WILL HUNT YOU TO THE TUNNELS END
I`M BOUND TO YOUR BODY - A SHADOW CAST BY LIGHT
BUT I WILL BE UNLEASHED IN THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT
WE TURN TO NIGHTMARES - WHEN YOU SLEEP
WELCOME THE DAWN WELCOME TO THE SHADOWKEEP
WE ARE ALWAYS WATCHING - ALWAYS THERE
ALWAYS FOLLOWING - NOBODY CARES
BOUND TO EVERY MOTION - EVERY MOVE YOU DO
BUT WHEN TH SUN SETS - WE WILL CONTROL YOU
WE ARE THE MASTERS OF THE DARKNESS
WE ARE CREATORS OF YOUR DREAMS
WE ARE THE BRINGERS OF YOUR NIGHTMARES
IN THIS FORTRESS THERE IS NOTHING AS IT SEEMS
MAYBE THIS NIGHT YOU WILL BE FASTER
MAYBE YOU`LL MAKE IT TO THE TUNNELS END
BUT IF YOU WON`T ESCAPE TILL SUNRISE
YOU WILL NEVER SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY AGAINWoke up this morning and he,
he took a look to the sky
The sun was hot and glowing
decided today is a good day to die
He wasn't sure just how, no he didn't know,
but he knew the reasons why
No one saw this coming because he kept it all inside
Out of control like a runaway train
desperate to end all his pain
You've got to understand there's
a better plan if you can open your eyes
You told yourself on your road to ruin
Today is a good day, a good day to die
Life to you is such a heavy burden
Today is a good day, a good day to die
So that's what you wanna do?
Take the easy way out
Suicide's only for cowards,
is that what you're all about
Are you afraid of the world around you,
are you afraid of what might be?
Think of the ones who love you
all the things you'll never see
Out of control like a runaway train
desperate to end all his pain
You've got to understand there's
a better plan if you can open your eyes
Friends all around, yet you feel so alone
Today is a good day, a good day to die
Carry on and you'll find the peace you've never known
Today is a good day, a good day to die(eery solo)

(TRANSLATION OF GLYPHS DISCOVERED CARVED INTO
THE SURFACE OF THE MYSTERIOUS BLACK ALTAR STONE.)Orally force fed until cirmosis is induced
Fatal renal failure bleeds like a sluice
Spewing blood as the gallbladder extrudes
Alcoholic poisoning, bloated lobules burst
Toxins flood the stomach in diffluence submerged
Coughing waste as the wrecked colon tears
The blood now critically proof
Neural cells fatally quenched
Drowning in split retention
Hepatic tissue ferments
Poisoned retention with intoxication
Inflamed nephrons burst, your condition's getting worse
Chronically diffused, your liver you will lose
Bodily distillation as emerged flesh reacts
With alcoholic contents in your urinary tract
Dripping fluid as the decrepit appendix weeps
Matter turns to fluid, intoxicating ablution
Bilary dehydration, as innards turn to solution
Bleeding urine as the inflamed bladder rips
The blood now critically proof
Neural cells fatally quenched
Drowning in split retention
Hepatic tissue ferments
Contamination, foul circulation
Alcohol force fed, goes straight to your head
Brain tissue damaged, fused with alcohol sewage
In a stupor you die, your brain lobes you fry
In a stupor you die, your brain lobes you fry
The blood now critically proof
Neural cells fatally quenched
Drowning in split retention
Hepatic tissue fermentsHey little sister what have you done
Hey little sister who's the only one
Hey little sister who's your superman
Hey little sister who's the one you want
Hey little sister shot gun!
It's a nice day to start again
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again.
Hey little sister what have you done
Hey little sister who's the only one
I've been away for so long (so long)
I've been away for so long (so long)
I let you go for so long
It's a nice day to start again (come on)
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again.
Take me back home
There is nothin' fair in this world
There is nothin' safe in this world
And there's nothin' sure in this world
And there's nothin' pure in this world
"ook for something left in this world
Start again
Come on
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again.
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start againI feel the wetness oh her tongue
That slides across my skin
The viruses crawl over me
And feel for some way in
Cut you with my cock Cassie likes it in her hand
Cassies dead inside I came to fuck the open wound
So hold it open wide
Cassie loves to swallow this bleeding will it stop
I left Cassie hollow cut you with my cock
Take me into the ocean
Lay me out on her shore
Wake me when the sun burns out
And we'll run forever more
We're all gonna die tomorrow
The freaks are screaming burn it down
She can't feel the weather
I can't touch the ground
Pale and twitching, twisting to the cold dance
Watching the room grow old a funeral romance
Somewhere, someone's, screaming that the worlds gone
Smear me with your blood and let these dead boy play their grave songs
Slide across the warm red floor to meet me
Lock the bathroom door before they crawl to eat me
Cut her throat and whisper that we're going home
Twitching to the cold dance they suck the meat from her bonesFingered slowly like the first time you came
The agents of oblivion descend upon the sane
Caked with mud and mother's blood
Playing death games in the rain
And we wonder how it feels to be free
I thought I heard them whisper mutiny
Living room rape scenes
We cut their throats while they slept
Dreaming and digesting shards of turtle shell
The television's blaring
And the ghost of Hitler speaks
Crowned with barbed-wire
I smear my warm semen on the walls of my oppression
I accuse God for the murder of eternity
My everything that is nothing
Christian propaganda and dog sperm
Degeneration...
The beautiful downgrade
Do you remember the first sunrise?
Sharpened bone clenched tight in your fist
Screaming into the blue
An urge to kill the sky
I can smell the forest like pussy in heat
Barefoot I run through the chaos
The assassins of freedom tend the burning of truth
As we walk these prison walls
It's maddening, always touching somethingTake your hands out of your pockets
Don't walk until green
Call it penance, call it shock
You just lost your esteem
You know it's ironic
If it went down today
Phony faces just don't care
But today they might have something to say
I remember tomorrow as if it was yesterday
And I say it in slugs
I'm not convinced it's the only way
How tiny bits and pieces of words/works
Somehow end up in hugs
Some say it in slugs
I killed my best friend with a hammer
Now I'm in stitches
He became one of the icons around
I was left with an itch
I woke up on the wrong side of my bed
I'm just a little keen
I have to sleep there dead on that spot
Or else I won't be able to dream
I remember tomorrow as if it was yesterday...
Some say it in slugsi can feel a pull from the outside world
a lonely shadow in the moonlit night
i can feel a pull from the outside world
please pull me up with the oceans
music is seen colors are heard
a dark vision of senses
is this tasting the world?
to ruin the illusion
is this primal or futile?
is this instinct or evil?
is this right or wrong?
i can feel a change
yes i can feel a change inside me
inside you
gnash's through each stranger in the night
your eyes will be opened
it will be too bright to see reality
when i wake up
in the morning
the taste lingers
on my lips
a love lost a lovers breath
whats best for me tonight is to let my coat fill in
a swift killer at each bite
people change when the pleasure starts to spoil
to my touch vivid colors appear
dark visions it was all too bright to see
reality what if this is all there is?
so sad to hear
oblivious to the obvious thats you
thats you
a love lost a lovers breath
whats best for me tonight is to let my coat fill in
i'll be on my way in flightthe clouds attacked slowly obscuring everything we
took out our eyes and pretended we could seeYou say you're getting tired of the spiritual march
Your life is slowly growing cold
Life just seems so much harder: all the battles day by day
That's when we must stand up and be bold
Be bold
So, let us not grow weary in doing what is right
God shall renew our strength to fight
Remember, we reap what we sow
Flesh sows corruption
Spirit everlasting life
It's yours
We shall reap - if we faint not
Seeing that we have a great high priest, Jesus: the Son of God
In all points tempted as we are
Sinless, He won the battle; given power to His own
Look up, your redemption is not afar
Be ready
We shall reap - if we faint notUnbeliever I'm an Unbeliever
And the night is begging me to stay.
All the pain and all the pretty rancor,
Soul of black to reach the other way.
Alone to carry the burden
Alone to promise the fall
Unbeliever I'm an Unbeliever
As the night surrounds me like fog.
First to rise, first to fall
I'll tell you 'bout the scars-my love
Hammer the nails and tolerate
The nights to come.
Unbeliever I'm an Unbeliever
And the night is begging me to stop.
Gone insane for all the pain I'm guilty
Tried to climb the hills of the unknown.
Alone to bleed and to suffer
Betrayed I ramble in the mist
Unbeliever I'm an Unbeliever
Got to find a reason to resist.
First to rise ,first to fall
I'll tell you 'bout the scars-my love
Hammer the nails and tolerate
The nights to come.
Unbeliever I'm an Unbeliever
And the night is begging me to stay.
So much pain and so much pretty rancor,
Soul of black to reach the other way.
Alone to born and to suffer
Alone to carry the cross
Unbeliever I'm an Unbeliever
And my heart is beating like a ghost.The human body, in its systematic nature
Has 3 primary objectives
1 Procreate
2 Food intake
3 The elimination of waste
This is the human equation
One half is feces, the other mammal
The human as shit
This is what you've become
The end result of human stupidity
Another mesh of flesh with no dignity
A solid waste with dull neuronal activity
2000 years from now
They'll discover our coprolite
Learn of disease and parasite
Enough to know what made us tick
Enough to make them sick
Anatomy
Scat anthropology
The study of man
Micturate, here's to your health
Defecate upon the self
Felch the goddamn sphinct
And gurgle it's disgusting contents
Playing king of the hill
On a mountain of manure
On a planet called earth
Mirroring what we're worth
We are nothing but a failure
Evolution took a shit
In my heart, through these eyes
Humankind in its own shit resides
2000 years from now
They'll examine our coprolite
Gain perspective and insight
Enough to know what made us tick
And that we're made of shit[Instrumental]Allow what's done to preach new
Insight to your life
Hindsight is perfect vision
The past is easiest to see
Clear a path, stand aside
We're carrying the torch now
Clear a path, stand aside
We're carrying the torch now
Clear a path, stand aside
There's no stopping us
Clear a path, stand aside
We're carrying the torch now
Clear a path, stand aside
There's no stopping us
Now I think you're everything
To everyone, to everyone
Go ahead, partake in it
Justify it
Become engulfed in it
It will eat you alive
This is not a one way road
You're headed for the dead end
This is not a one way road
You're headed for the dead end
You might think you're everything to everyone
Well pardon me if I intrude
You might think you're everything to everyone
You're not a perfect man in a perfect world
Look at where your ignorance has brought you
All this will be buried like the fall of Rome
Look at where your ignorance has brought you
You will come crashing down
The truth hurts, the truth hurts
The truth hurts, the truth hurts
The truth hurts, the truth hurts
But denial's what will kill you
All that you loved
All that you treasure
Will pass with time
Will pass with time
Blinded by the inability to see
Beyond flesh and blood
Blinded by the inability to see
Beyond flesh and blood
Shifting blame with a log in your eye
Insisting that a string tied to your limbs
Is what's to blame, is what's to blame
Suck it up and bite the bulletThere is no meaning in your death anymore
The words of your life no longer apply
Your prayers are just lies that fall on deaf ears
Faith has all been lost in our blood and tears
The light that you seek
You'll find nothing there
Your god is just a lie
Void of all meaning
Faith is your bleeding scar
Your god is just a lie
False prophets and promises
I know what they're not
I don't know what god is
I know what it's not
Christploitation is all I see
Your god that cannot save youRostros que exponen incertidumbre atroz
Curtidos por un castigo sin opciÃ³n
Arrollando el paso no detuvieron a ver
La voracidad fue solo imponer.
Fuera de aquÃ­
Maniatados por falacias que arrojo
Asesinos viles que no dieron opciÃ³n
Sangre derramada para saciar su sed
Injustificada matanza que serÃ¡ vengada.
Hoy vuelve a renacer en tus manos fuertes el poder
Al ver sentir que puedes seguir sosteniendo las raÃ­ces que
No tienen que morir es la historia que vivira
Para no borrar la impura visiÃ³n que hizo carne en total represiÃ³n, rebeliÃ³n
Fieles a nuestra verdadGotta make out things they said
Spent too many nights getting out of my head
They must be mad, must be blind
Driving me crazy right out of my mind

Schweig' ich in der Wald
Ich leben in was anderes ist bitterkalt
Der Friedhof in weisser Pracht gehllt
Da schweigen da seine Seele fullt
Dein schatten nur ein formloser Fleck
Der Wind steigt ber die Grber hinweg
Der Wind steigt ber die Grber hinweg!
Eine schwarzige Stein
Kommt auf dich zu
Du ruhrst dich nicht, verschwindest du!
Einmal hin und weg
Eine wesentliche blick
Ist die sicht einer beralles hin
Ohne etwas str
Ein kalte geschicht
Dann sollte alle ber die Grber hinweg
Dann sollte alle ber die Grber hinweg!
Ich komm in und wieder bin leer
Trauer, sehnsucht ich hab viel mehr
Blut zu blut
Fleisch zum Fleisch
Trotz erkltest der unsame Schwei
Ich knne es verlange das du versteck
Das Feigling ber die Grber hinweg
Und das Feigling ber die Grber hinweg!
Schwarz ist die Nacht
Schweig' ich in der Wald
Ich leben in was anderes ist bitterkalt
Der Friedhof in weisser Pracht im Wald
Still in diese Nacht das alt
Alte verschwindest dich
Du solltest ber die Grber hinweg
Du solltest ber die Grber hinweg!Melting in the heat
Beloved Succubus I lick your lips in fever dreams
Pandora sweet
Your hot flesh sucks on mine as I flow deep into thee
My bride in red
In lust our souls ablaze scream with the winds of hell
My high priestess of death
Drowned in the seed of doom you spread
You - my blessed grim reaper
Writhing in you brute embrace
You - you breathe miasma
I taste your kiss of pestilence
Pandora - glorious countess of plague and fevers
Tears darken my eyes
Dripping on you naked breast
You lick my flesh
Greying, decaying by your touch, my body wreck
Convulsive grasp
My flesh is stricken, shivers run across my skin
I face my death, rape my fading life
And ride my fevery soul through thunderstorms in Hades' depths
You - you're the flesh untamed
I - I face my death unchainedI've been fighting every day of my life
Against my demons, against my limitations
Torn between death and desolation
I greet each challenge with expectation
This path I walk is my own
Against all I stand alone
These wounds will heal even if the scars remain
A constant reminder of the knowledge I have gained
Even if I fail, with all I am I have tried
I press forward, I will not be satisfied
This path I walk is my own
Against all I stand alone
And you can say what you will
'Cause I'll be holding strong
Against all I stand alone
These are my choices
I will not back down
This life is my design
I will bear this crown
This path I walk is my own
Against all I stand alone
And you can say what you will
'Cause I'll be holding strong
Against all I stand aloneI wanna wake with a reason to celebrate
I wanna wake up before it's too late
I wanna hear that song on the radio
Spinning round my head like a halo
As I fade to another place
Where I dream while I'm still awake
I feel changed and I waste away
I sip this cheap champagne
It's just another day
Hey old man you used to live for the heroin
You were shooting star, leaving impressions
Now you're sittin' alone in your rocking chair
Wishing you could rocket right out of there
As I fade to another place
Where I dream while I'm still awake
I feel changed and I waste away
I sip this cheap champagne
It's just another dayChorus:
Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase
Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase
Verse One:
I need...mo money mo money mo, suck 'em fast suck 'em slow
Even though I gotta pay my bills I'm still on the streets
tryin' to keep it real
Pass that shit let me take a hit, hopin' this money ain't
counterfeit
Give 'em 211 get 'em in line and let 'em 20 so(?)
Cut that money let's be up, which you want to ride, the
Benz or the Truck
Back up, get on the one way 'cause more Sundays hotter than Monday
Often gettin' trailed by cops, gotta get away by hittin them blocks
Got my glock, never stick middle finger up my ass, known to blast
Keep me down, where I'm from I'm known to clown
Get a dub off a nine, go get a sack, I'm back, pro black
achiever, leave her, thug and ashtray
More to the fact I'm back to the scene, let in the wonder
let all the smoke out
And if Luke coulda broke out
Gotta make more stacks of these, so I Z's for bud in
the breeze, ain't spittin' cheese
What a freak want to trip off, sip off the lame with the
game, get sick of the man who point the blame
Still a P-O, P-I,M-P, we be P-A,P-E-R...chase
Chorus:
Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase
Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase
Verse 2:
You see my nice Mom smokin', money slopin' 'tween my fo
with open arms when my option is to my mission it's a paperchase
So when you face to face: mom and dollar, keep to the
streets, hit the joints like hollow
Boy better figure if you owe them, better low then
With po-po corruption on the phone double 1-9-1-87, with
a couple of zeros
I'm sittin' there makin' dollars
Verse 2 G, nigga didn't want to holler
Back to the streets again, but a nigga want to go there
The game treatment so fair
Crucial, in neutral, all eyes on me I'm brutal, choppin'
up that paper like you know
Gotta click since I call them blue notes
Shippin' that paper from Earth to Pluto
Get that new song
Nineteen ninety-six we be paperchasin'!
Chorus:
Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase
Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase
Verse 3:
I'm...checkin' paper like a hunter, Belo
Had dreams about runnin' four to the floor
O.G.s in my house me in the clause
Nigga want cheese, nigga want more
Bumpin' all the good shit 'cause all the good shit makes
you forget about the bad bit
Now you make a nigga match wits
Never want what I never had, 'cause I never had shit
The basketball, the all, the ounce, bounce, A to the motherfucking K
I smoke the bead but they keep on calling me and they
want my apology
And they fall, see it's unexplainable how money's unattainable
if you play in this game
So nigga never call me names when I aim the gun but holler:
A to the motherfucking K with a motherfucking spray-ay-ay
A to the motherfucking K with a spray-ay-ay
It's 95 keep your ass out the line-up
Why don't you keep the double-time up, pimp keep them lines up
Help 'em talk to shiner, give me the best wish
The paperchase be for me 'cause you got blasted with
an eighth of a key
Niggas be be-comin' up but come or stay away
And I'll let you take your fate with three...
Bullets to the chest, put your body rest
If you know P-gang going for the G-Style
Never relax, realize don't give a one-too-many free packs
Come check your ho to see I'm a G
I-get in a sick dream
Paid to pick teams in a room full of dick fiends
Much love to thugs who sacrifice their life to get greens
for the troop of 15, what the shit mean?
It's you bitch, you better save your breath, 'cause you
can't count how many days is left
Let the weed smoke, blaze, but check, until I'm ready to wreck
Then a motherfucker gonna be paid to death
Because I'm goin' on a paperchase
Chorus:
Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase
Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase
Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase
Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchaseWinter forest
Winter patterns on the trees
Trudging through the horny bushes
Snow is cracking
Underneath my feet
Broken branches
Shadows grey
My eyes can hardly see
So full of tears
Winter forest
I can hear chanting monks
And his heart so cold and silent
Which is calling
Calling me to come
Hungry ravens
Looking down
But I'm still alive
The power of my will
Is my only guide
There within the woods
My friend will be buried
In the burial ground
Outside of monastery
I must see his funeral
I must be there just in time
Getting late and getting dark
Where's the path I cannot find
Winter forest
Fading whispers in the wind
You rest somewhere six feet under
Snow has covered
All the memories
Hungry ravens
Looking down
But I'm still alive
The power of my will
Is my only guideWe come into your whorehouse
We want some clits to eat
Loads and loads and loads of them
That's what we fuckin' need
A flithy clit in our mouth
Rancid smell of women breed
Eating, licking, biting, bleeding
The taste of clit we find neet
[Chorus]
You always make us eat
You make us want to breed
Upon clits we spill our seed
Eat clit or die!!
We know what we want
We know what we need
We don't need to repeat ourselves
Lay down on your sheets
Spread your fuckin' legs
And don't try to fucking breathe
A fuckin' clit in our mouth
Iss what we want to eat
[Repeat chorus x2]Baptized by Force (Vkisinkastettu, ENGLISH translation)
(the one who was) Baptized by force
Has made a fist out of his Anger
Reddened with Blood
(and) Clenched because of foreign lies
Puppet of the cross
And the horde of black-robed one's
Shall be thrown out with a curse
To Die out in the cold
On the icy lake a hatchet rang
Steel sang and drank Blood
(the one who was) Baptized by force
Has removed the poison from his flesh
The filth of bethlehem
A carcass refused (even) by vultures
The stench of the corpse
And rancid lies of the reverend
Shall be washed away with Blood
Eye for a fething eye
On the icy lake a hatchet rang
Steel sang and drank Blood
In the name of our lord Satan
I re-baptize myself
With the Blood of a thousand christians
I wash myself clean
Of the stench of rotten christ
Let Thy Coldness and Bleakness embrace me
O' Black Lord of Darkness, Thine slave I am
Let Thy Wrath and Fury rape me
O' lord Satan, Thine whore I am
(the one who was) Baptized with force
Has beget a Vengeance out of his Wrath
(a child) Devoted to Tuoni
(a child) Blessed with the strength of truth
The jewish clitlips
And the xtian sheep herd
Will be Beheaded with cheering
And Finland will be redeemed
On the icy lake I masturbated
And drank the Blood of holy man
On the icy lake I masturbated
And drank the Blood of a Dead xtianThe holy trinity is rotten
All the saints are slain
Religion is forgotten
To the winged demon-lord we pray
We will rule -
If not now, than in eternity
Maybe you win in this world
But the universe of black divine
Remains immortal
Get one of us in this reality
We sacrifice hundrets of yours
In our true reality -
Hell
The dark age is our aim
To rule of mankind
This worthless brainless piece of shit
That remained of gods ridiculous creation
Our unit shows the sign of Satan
The master in black
Obey or be obliteratedOriginally performed by Kiss
You've got something about you
You've got something I need
Daughter of Aphrodite
Hear my words and take heed
I was born on Olympus
To my father a son
I was raised by the demons
Trained to reign as the one
God of thunder and rock and roll
The spell you're under
Will slowly rob you of your virgin soul
I'm the lord of the wastelands
A modern day man of steel
I gather darkness to please me
And I command you to kneel
Before the
God of thunder and rock and roll
The spell you're under
Will slowly rob you of your virgin soul
I am the lord of the wastelands
A modern day man of steel
I gather darkness to please me
And I command thee to kneel
Before the
God of thunder and rock and roll
The spell you're under
Will slowly rob you of your virgin soulStaring out the window
Ignoring the signs
Hear the knocking on the door
Let me inside
I'm still beating
I'm alive
Believe me, I am not pretending
I can see us now, ending
Stand up for the god
Who left you alone
The absence of god
Who left you alone
Our reanimated shelf life
Stretched to a breaking point
See, all you need is to breathe
To stay alive
I'm still breathing
I'm alive
In the mirror I see
My reflection staring back at me
Stand up for the god
Who left you alone
The absence of god
Who left you alone
Stand up for the god
Who left you alone
The absence of your chosen god
Has left you
Haunted animal of prey
Stand up for the god
Who left you alone
The absence of god
Left a holeWrapped up in pain,
Entering a dark pillar hall,
with the most exquisite marble,
polished and sparkling since thousands of years,
I hear the echo of emptiness...
Cautiously I step across the empty floor,
but I notice, uneasy, that my footfalls are soundless.
Scared I hurry into the next hall...
There are statues of pure gold,
decorated with the rarest of gems.
There they stand magnificent and glorious,
watching the sky...
Though there is something which worries me
and at last I stop and see what it is...
What I watch is the bitter face of loneliness.
The cold embrace feels to the innermost corner of my soul.
Was beauty nothing but cold?
What I found beautiful, was it just icy winds?
Was this the room I had been looking for so long?
Was this the place where freedom lives?
My way went on into wilderness,
along the well-known path called Confusion...
After a dark night I approached the big gate,
though I was astonished when I saw that it was more than a gate.
I arrived at a crossroad with two golden gates.
Gift...Mystery...
Who built them there?
What was Remembrance in this?
I am struck by their temptation,
the inviting power which attracts my innermost thoughts.
Stunned by this powerful experience
and grateful for it
I remain hesitantly at the crossroads.
Which path is my way?
Which gate is the opening to the life I wanted?
Oh, Jesus Christ...
I seek Thy Divine wisdom,
I bow before Thy advice...
May Thy hand lead a wavering heart
May Thy word be a torch on my path...[Windjourney/the Human Plague]

To destroy what god create
Landscape after landscape
They march fast full of hate
Apolluon lord of destruction
We summon you o mighty one
Apolluon lord of destruction
Return o mighty one
Corpse covers the ground
Bodies ripped in two
Christians failed to defend
What god has built for them
Come fourth

Heylel ben shacher they rise
Dark ones rise above groundThere exists a place of agony
Where children are held captive
Belt across the back, the nuns attack
Believe in god or be beaten to death
Work to earn your keep, no time to sleep
You better know the bible verse
Or go without and die of thirst
Resent your birth, thanks to god
At Father Baker's the pain is divine
If you are lucky you'll get out alive
Welcome to terror, you're where you belong
Father is waiting to show you your wrong
Learn early on to behave or you'll die
Live with his torture, no one to confide
Innocence lost by the rage he inflicts
Repent to god or the pain will persist
Kept inside a cage, humiliate
Till Father takes confession
Whipped unmercifully and left to bleed
And by the end to be one with god
Fast you into place, the final phase
Before you meet his maker
Do as you are told or you will go
And then you'll know what is sufferingGuilty until proven innocent
We condemn your soul and fate
Never mind the possibilities
Too busy for logic or calculate
Take part in diminishing breed
Where complex turns to simplicity
When pain is acknowledged
Frivolous calculations will be abolished
Chorus:
Without judgment what would we do ?
We would be forced to look
At ourselves emerged in lost time
Assuming what may be
Without judgment
Perception would increase a million times
Distracted by the imagination
That experiments with ease
If you could taste it, it might be addictive
Where life will crush those who defy
Take part in diminishing breed
Where complex turns to simplicity
When pain is acknowledged
Frivolous calculations will be abolished
Chorus:
Without judgment what would we do ?
We would be forced to look
At ourselves emerged in lost time
Assuming what may be
Without judgment
Perception would increase a million timesSave our love
Save our love
Save our love
Do you remember
All of the joy we found last spring
Oh baby
So good together
We never worried about a thing
No no
But now I see such a distance in your eyes
And the seasons come between us
I can't find my paradise
Without your love I'm a little child lost in the world
Mmm, come on baby
Say it's not too late
I know there's time enough
Help me darling
We got to save our love
Save our love
Stay close beside me
'Cause the sky is stormy now
Come on baby, come on and save our love
Save our love
Save our love
Save our love
Save our love
Walking in circles
Thinking if all we had was gone
Oh yeah
My life would be worthless
Never known emotions could run this strong
Oh, you don't know
What went on inside of me
When you said that you'd be leaving
'Cause I hurt you selfishly
Without your love I'm as hopeless
As the earth without the sun
Oh come on baby
Say it's not too late
I know there's time enough
Help me darling
We got to save our love
Save our love
Stay close beside me
'Cause the sky is stormy now
Come on baby, come on and save our love
Save our love
Save our love
Save our love
Save our love
So let's not fall apart
Like all those other lovers
I know if we trust
Love will leave it up to us
Oh
Oh, say it's not too late
I know there's time enough
Help me darling
We got to save our love
Save our love
Stay close beside me
'Cause the sky is stormy now
Come on baby, come on and save our love
Save our love
Say it's not too late
I know there's time enough
Help me darling
We got to save our love
Save our love
Stay close beside me
'Cause the sky is stormy now
Come on baby, come on and save our love
Save our love
Stay (stay)
StayWerde untergehen und auferstehen
Erhalten durch elixiere gemischt aus blut
Wer will mich halten, wer mich toten,
Wer solite sie loschen, meine glut?
Ich spucke feuer aus der tiefe meines
Herzens
Da meine welt zugrunde geht-
Mein hang zur qual hat sie zerstort
Auf knien das ende herbeigefleht
Hab'mich erborochen nachdem ich dich
liebte
Als do nackt vor mit lagst
Ein zeichen demer augen, ein gutes
Geschenkt dir aus schmerzen, auch wenn
do klagst
[repeat chorus]
word'dich vermissen, so tief der schmerz
Die angst macht alles noch viel schlimmer
Durch meine adern fliesst atzende saure
Gedanken statt worte, statt liebe
Gewimmer...
Noch uber den wolken fliege ich
Die luft voll der vogel gekreische
Mein wille, er jagt mich, verfolgt mich
Ein bestie auf der suche nach faulendem
FleischeI'm feeling this time
As bad as never before
A bleeding wag is fading away
Once you needed me
For spending delight
But below the funny mask
There's a crying face
The way that I smile is the way that I cry
But you'll never realize
My reputation is the one of a fool
Now watch how poet dies
Hear his cries
[Chorus]
And I dedicate my roses to no one
Cause there is no mind to help me to see
The reason we need
A light for the lonesome
And no none to drink
The blood that I bleed
The poet inside - wasn't given a chance
So he had to live apart
And I realized - my best friend am I
And not those parasites
Who try to stare into my heart
The way that I feel is the way that I heal
My body and soul and my life
And I know you just think I'm a fool
Now watch how a poet flies, see me rise
[Chorus]
And I dedicate my roses to no one
Cause there is no mind to help to see
The reason we need
A light for the lonesome
And no one to drink
The blood that I bleed
[Chorus]
And I dedicate my roses to no one
Cause there's no mind to help me to see
The reason we need
A light for the lonesome
And no one to drink the blood that I bleed
And I dedicate my roses to no one
Cause there's no mind to help me to see
The reason we need
A light for the lonesome
And no one to drink the blood that I bleedAlone I walk the road to nowhere land
I lost my dreams and hope for better days
I'll be there to see my paradise
One day I'll see it rise
The sky is your kingdom
Oh lord of the air
A shade of hope, who takes away despair
Show me your freedom
And save me from pain
I believe in you, believe in you
Here, I'm crying in the rain
Sometimes, somewhere, somehow
Wings of glory
They will take me
Higher to the open sky
Higher and higher he flies
Gliding with the warm wind stream
High up in the skies I'm free
On warm winds he's rising
He's unbound and free
Bird of prey - to seal my destiny
Guardian of creation
Guardian of mine
I believe in you, believe in you
You, are running out of time
Sometimes, somewhere, somehow
Wings of glory
They will take meTonight is the night
The empowering wind that draws breath from despite
Roars Ã¢??neath my wings as I soar with the end in sight
Choirs ignite
A swansong for Leda
Deathknells for Troy
Tragedy blooms from one act
I am nemesis
Poured in my arms
When my daughter's eyelids closed
I swore to slaughter those
Who stole my ray of moonlight
So strike up the skies
The diction of thunder
God-given rites
No fiction can deafen the fact
I am nemesis
Cowled in the utter grief
I am the priest of a new disorder
Whose flag unfurled
Bears a hatred for the western world
The is no compromise
No piped lament
To stay the blind
Just a shrike cacophony of war
Ashes ember, fires rise
No longer am I paralyzed
Now I drown in a loss worth fighting for
Black is my heart
Black is my heart
Black is my heart
I am nemesis
Black is my heart
Black is my heart
Black is my heart
I am nemesis
Nemesis
Nemesis
Tonight is the night
The city sweats fever, the filth in her womb
Shifts like the season's unease at the hands of doom
Restless inside
Her split underbelly
Suitored with flies
Martial bowels now contract
I am nemesis
Poured in my arms
When my daughter's eyelids closed
I swore to slaughter those
Who stole my ray of moonlight
Never again
Our enemies entertained
I toy at the clasp of her chain
And remember the fight
Cowled in utter grief
I am the priest of a new disorder
Whose flag unfurled
Bears a hatred for the western world
There is no compromise
No piped lament to stay the blind
Just a shrike cacophony of war
Ashes ember, fires rise
No longer am I Palestined
Now I drown in a loss worth fighting for
Black is my heart
Black is my heart
Black is my heart
I am nemesis
Black is my heart
Black is my heart
Black is my heart
I am nemesis
Black is my heart
Black is my heart
Black is my heart
I am nemesis
Black is my heart
Black is my heart
Black is my heart
I am nemesis
Nemesis(Her) Nights spent succumbing to the brilliance of Blackeyes, feeling the
warm embrace of your hand, memories like salt on a wound, dominate my new
found spirit land.
Seeking wisdom in the darkness hovering helplessly around our pain crying
with absence of real tears, like a child born in vein.
I can no longer bear to watch you cradling my form. Wrenching out bloody
drops of desperation's futile storm. Welcome to the Willothewisp my love.
Deaths arduous game. Mocking times insanity foreshadowing years of reign.
(Male) Oh my perfect princess, hard and cold as stone. I shall trace your
lips with crimson. I'll protect you; they can't have you to bury, to leave
me. Slay all who dare touch my pretty doll, it will be bloody paradise, a
misanthropes ball.
(Female) I hear you and beseech you, find a way to understand. Kill them
for my body and be left with grains of sand. Do not waste your life in
vain, protecting that which feels happiness nor pain.
Willothewisp my love, is forever now what be. Willothewisp my darkened
darling can not be taken away from thee.
(Male) I feel your essence all around me, and see you dead on our floor.
Realize it would kill me to see you dragged out like a rotting whore. The
dead are not theirs to take, fuck their reality. I seek revenge. Fuck their
stupidity, your death will be avenged.
My princess is not their dead slave, to tear apart and fit inside a holy
lonesome grave.
(Female) Ahh! You torment me with endless worry. A doll is what is left of
me, to kill it, insanity! Wake up live your life. Do not waste it in my
name.
(Male)
No! Why? Your body comforts me. Please understand. It is a Willothewisp my
love, but at least I would have command.
Help! Help! Ahh! I can not take this, my heart was black to all but you,
and now you're dead. I need you in any form. I want you. Separation is what
permeates the fear of death. Ahh! Ahh! Come back!
(Female) My essence is always with you. Hovering over you and what was I of
my love and perfect self, I never meant to die. It's all right, do as you
wish. I want my body to be with you.
(Male) I see them coming, my pulse quickens, my long blade smiles. Get away
from her! Bastards, pawns! Die, you are worth nothing, Die!!
They are dead as well, now bags of worthless flesh. How dare they try and
take you, Ha! Ha! Ha! We are free together.
(Female) You shiver like a broken child before me, clutching my cold hand
wet with tears, you kiss my hand and lips, and I feel nothing.
(Male) A presence looms about me, whispering like morning dew. My perfect
death doll princess, I stay here forever with you.
(Female) He has won my body, but now he is insane. I reach out to dry his
tears, only to find I am like wind to rain.
(Both) Willothewisp is torture, deaths arguous game.
Willothewisp is hidden boundaries, foreshadowing years of pain.Defying the laws of logic

Dissect to collect, my blade now reams
Pieces of flesh lie side by side
Worn on my body or put on display
You mark your skin it, gives you pleasure
I take your precious art, it becomes my leather
Taking your hide before you have died
Decency defied
Crudely I cut away
All are my prey
Tell me how it feels when your flesh is peeled
You are vain with your art
I desire it torn appart

You mark your skin, it gives you pleasure
I take your precious art, it becomes my leather
Taking your hide before you have died
Decency defiedA blinding white light, like a cold white sun in the night
But there's nothing at all that's divine about the discharge of rounds
And as you crawl through the maelstrom of war
Whatever you'll endure, you'll endure alone
Falling deep into the abyss, with survival rate more hit than miss
Wailing through the swamps, assessing every sound
Judging the threat of the demons, airborne and on ground
But one must believe, one surely must conceive
Whatever you'll endure, you'll endure alone
Because in the end, there's no-one but you
Your comrades in arms have no power to do
A thing for your plight, or a thing for your life
On your trip to hell, you'll be all alone, this is the essence of total isolation
Making resolves on your final breath, suddenly faced with your last conquest
Will yourself to live you give it your best, now cradled in the arms of death
Falling deep into the abyss, some rounds graze, while others pierce
Falling deep into the abyss, with a survival rate more hit than missHow many times have I called your name
And wondered if you hear me, see me
Know the things I'm feeling in my soul
You turned around and you answered me
You held out your arms to me
Helped me when I needed you the most
And you set me free
Finally I see
You set me free
In you I can believe
You set me free
I was alone when you came to me
Saw that I was naked, broken
Couldn't find the strength to carry on
You lifted me up and you sheltered me
You opened up your heart to me
Loved me when I needed you the most
And you set me free
Finally I see
You set me free
In you I can believe
You set me free
You're everything to me
You set me free
In you I can believe
You set me freeSnake-eyes burns the night while candlelight glows
My arms are raised high towars the sky
Into the river of oblivion's wine I shall drown
The secrets of clandestine lie before my eyes
Midnight - cracks my spine in two
Divine - ain't this goddamn life, no
Sorrow shine your light to me
Agony tremble the ground beneath me
Poison runs inside my veins
As you sink your teeth in into my flesh
The guns of heaven will shoot me down
The guns of heaven will shoot me down
Vipers hiss when death hails me with her damned kiss
Cold killing rapture is freezing my lips
Fairytales, fairytales, they all sing to me
This sweet and temptating, delightful melody:
Walk through the shadows of dusk and dance before the fire with us
Let loose the wrath that paints your heart black
But my heart is black, like my wrath will only grow
The crimson stream of life will forever flow
[chorus]
This world is a lie, easier it would be to die
But we live in vain and die for the same
No moon nor the sun can sweep my tears away
Nothing can set me free from this life of agony
[chorus]Japanese rabbi mixing
Liquid LSD and baby formula
To pump into infants
Like nipple fed Pokemon
Drunk with the power to summon money
From their captivated and confused prey
Pocketing the middle class
American monsterAs blood rains from the sky
Kill the fuckin' bastards, spill their goddamn blood
The war machine is raging hard, the horror never stops
Killing on adrenaline, the devil's in my back
Unleashed hate defeats my fear, I shred to live
As blood rains from the sky
Marching to die, hell on earth, external extinction applies
As blood rains from the sky
Bringer of pain, monger of death, the human race gone insane
Screams throughout the firestorm, the enemy draws near
I get myself up out into, the battlefield of fear
I see the mangled bodies, victimized by war
I join the madness to stay alive, as the bullets cut me down
Hit by hostile fire, my warhead's still alive
I crawl my flesh into the trench, destruction in my mind
I'm lying here like helpless, bleeding fuckin' wounds
Conflict of my inner senses, unconsciousness comes soon
Mass annihilation, redolence of death
Prepare myself for the attack
To kill the innocent ones aheadDer Flugelflagel gaustert Durchs Wiruwaruwolz
die rote Fingur plaustert und grausig gutzt der GolzI am the horned Beast with the seven heads.
I bear the whore, drunk with the blood of Jesus.
I rise from the abyss to avenge the memory of my martyrs,
of Judas, of Cain and all the heretics,
of the swearers, the witches and the heirs of Lucipher's Temple.
I've come to sweep away the Christians nightmare,
to shake the world with the scream of PAN,
to free mankind from the slavery of the beggar God!
REIGN WITH ME IN HELL!
DON'T BE A SLAVE IN HEAVEN!Alone, but for your Celeste
At your reverent feet, I rest
And plead forgiveness
I face the blinding sun
And ask for my last rites
Oh, Celeste... forgive me
Sunset
To bathe in your milky red radiance
Like a God
Illuminates, enraptures, captivates
Woe
The grey clouds are shedding tears
Oh, how they weep
I share their grief, and so do you
I know... and you know
It is clear the storms are everlasting
And forever...
The unspoken heart of ebony
The unbroken heart of ebony
The undying heart of ebony...
Seems to beat not for me
Oh, Woe...
The grey clouds cast a shadow overhead
The last sunset, your fall I dread
On bruised and bended knees
I throw my hands to my face
And I tear shreds of skin away, in vain
Forgive me.There's a fine line between love and hate
And you've crossed both
There's a fine line between love and hate
And you've crossed both
If I was a puppet then you'd be my master,
To pull my strings forever after
If I was a puppet, you'd be my master,
To pull my strings forever after
If I was a puppet, you'd be my master,
If I was a puppet, you'd be my master,
So just hold tight, we'll be alright
You've crossed the border line,
Crossed the border line,
There's nowhere to go to hide
There's nowhere to run tonight
Please just dont cross that lineYou never thought I'd ever get over you
But one day, found my way
and started new
Now everything's complete
I'm living life so free
Like sunlight through the haze
The Endless Days
The Endless Days
I see you and start to fall apart
In prison, my vision was in the dark
Now everything's so sweet
I'm living life for me
And finally through the maze
The Endless Days
The Endless Days
Like sunlight through the haze
And finally through the maze
The Endless Days
The Endless Days
Like sunlight through the haze
And finally through the mazeMusic: Hertrich
Lyrics: Hertrich
Neglect me, lose me
only give me leave,
unworthy as I am
to follow Your grief
Therefore the moon,
the governess of floods,
pale in her anger
washes all the air
Fall in the fresh lap
of the crimson rose
The human mortals want
their winter cheer
Love takes the meaning
in love's conference
So that but one heart
we can make of it
The stary welking
covers You anon
with dropping fog
as black as acheron
Thorny anger, be not seen,
come not near our fairy-queen
For night's swift dragons
cut the clouds
I tary for the comfort of the day
Fair love, I see, I forgot our way
Stand still, You ever moving spheres,
in misery noone will here
And they shoot chillness to my heart
I can't break the midnight sighIn-a-gadda-da-vida baby
God is dead he lost the battle
The devil rules over life and death
Feel his power, feel his wrath
Hell - this is the paradise of sin
Fail - and you will suffer in pain
Nail - that son of disaster
Sell - your soul to the master
In the garden of evil, baby
The bible's title is helter skelter
Take a ride on this rollercoaster
Live for sin and die faster
Wake - your evil twin
Live - your wildest dream
Let - the demons in
Let - the madness begin(prostitution of the world)
dads abusing newborn blood prayers
from a priest in heat a piece
of body cut alive sold out for
the highest price
a god dethroned is fucking blind
stupid people fucked up minds
evolution
prostitution of the world
evolution
disillusion of us all
weapons kill your loves and lives
triggers pulled by children's eyes
politicians sell their souls
promise shelter raping minds
feels like violate the dead
shoot the bullet in your head
evolution...
getting obscene on the dead feel desire
for young flesh watch your bloody
lieing screen sacrificed for satans dreams
want to absolute your sins
just kneel down and suck my skin
evolution...The wideness of the air is my domain
Mine is the sky
Mine are the omniscient eyes
Brother of the tempest and the wind
Master of all
The Gates of Tenebra within
Fly up to the sky my dragon son
Storm and thunder guide your way, ablaze and shine
See with watchful eyes my dragon son
Keep in mind the oath of mine with truth and light
Once I was the victim of the greed
Cursed for all times
Thirsting for sky and light
Imprisoned by the gold beyond the gate
Until a bright
Beautiful beam lit my way
Rule with breath of fire my dragon son
Seek beyond Tenebra's sun the light of yours
Cry out for my name my dragon son
Trust the flame of mine for I will comeWhen I wake up at the end of the day
Moon comes out sun fades away
I get myself out of my bed and cry
Is it really me now - could this be the real thing
Is there someone else to ease the pain
So easy, so easy now, has it really gone too far
It don't matter anyhow, sometimes I feel like an
Echo in the wind, that's not coming back again
I look inside my head and what I see
Are the reflections of the world
And I see genius and insanity
You're alive - you're part of the show
You came to foresee the signs on the wall
So many tried in vain - they know the truth
Learn - how to live and fight and learn -
How to fight them right and learn - how to give and take it all
You can be strong if you know who you are
The signs on the wall tell you move on before it's too late
Can you see them, do you want to be the one who's creeping on the floor?
Could it be forever? Could it all be lies?
The chaos is a killer and he knows who will fall
Help me - I need some help
Now is there someone out there
What are you waiting for?
You're on the road to nowhere
The only way I know
Maybe I'm wrong, I haven't got a clue
Don't know where I belong - tell me what is true
Oh won't you come to heal me - heal me [repeat 4 times]
[Here comes the "undocumented piece"..they talk for a while something about well....God, afterlife, Truth - is all that real and such sort of thing]
Think - don't think - what can you see
Our life is just a fantasy of someone we will never see
Therefore I break down in laughter
Now as I change my point of view
There's nothing left to make me blue - never again - no more
Come on in my friend and join the ball
Everything is beautiful - even the band - it's magic
Imagine you're superstar you gonna fly
You gonna go far - far, so far
[Solo Dirk]
Oh won't you come to heal me - heal me [repeat 4 times]Talk about humanity, what's wrong and what is right
You take a human being and strip them of their life
A tormented soul, trapped and left to decay
In a controlled environment to die in a demented way
Death row, he's awating, time just drags by
Gas chamber awaits for him to pay for his crime
When will the madness end, will it be today
What terrible thoughts living day by day
Chorus:
The crime was committed, forever left condemned
Left and forgotten, the fortune never ends
Sentenced to death, delayed for seventeen years
Left to go insane now death's his greatest fear
15 thousand dollars monthly that we pay
To keep him alive, now that's insane
Injustice prevails again, it's the American way
No wonder we're in debt, why do we have to pay
If the death penalty exists to make these convicts pay
Kill them when convicted instead of awaiting
To wait seventeen years is totally inhumane
The crime has lost its meaning, it's ruthless to be so vain
Repeat chorus
Solo: Skowron
Repeat first verse
Repeat chorus[Music: J. Hjelm / Lyrics: T. Dahlstrm]
Where do you hide now doorknocker
Was my door the end of your Jehovah Crusade?
I wish you would comeback to die again
I miss the feeling of my fist bashing your face
Why don't you comeback to insult me again
So I can crucify you as I did last time
Oh please doorknocker knock on my door
So I can split your bible in two as before
Doorknocker why do you hide from me?
I miss to give you pain, visit me
You promised me suffering from god's hand
Where are the sufferings? hiding as you Jehovah
I told you hell would conquer
It looks like I am right and you are wrong again
Doorknocker why do you hide from me?
I miss to give you pain, visit me
Open my house door
Enter my house whore
Behind enemy lines
Your words they will not help
Come back to me
Try to turn me
Speak your words
Come back to me
So I can hurt you
And hurt you yes I will
Open my house door
Enter my house whore
Behind enemy lines
Your words they will not help
I miss your screams for help
I miss your fear for me
I miss to give you pain
I miss the torturingBirth is always painful, Decaying in the womb trapped within this body
A bleeding human tomb gutted bitch lies dead emptied of the child
chewing on the cords its life line to this world afterbirth is flowing
The stench is overwhelming
My body, growing stronger, my pain turns to torture
Severing its bloodline
A butchered infant carcass
Meat from the unborn, the freshest kills
Chopped up children bathing in blood
Contoured and festering I rot in disgust
Re-generation of my body
Mother ripped apart
Smashing in her face
My knife cutting holes, fucking her remains
Esophogus carved out
Crushing cartilage
Bile oozing from punctures in your liver
Riping meat within
Chewing in intestine
Bladder spurting urine, sight of defecation now grow infection
The child ripped to shreads
Drinking its excretions
Zombification ejaculation over mutilation
On the Mothers body hacked into pieces
The sludges from my cock gives her life once again
Sewing the remains of the child deep within her
Reborn through evil
My torture known throughout Hell
Heed to his calling, the demons await my next kill
Carnage is my fetish
Body cavities scraped of guts
Brains seeping from cracks as my axe continues to hackEndless nights filled with misery
Sick of familiar patterns
Bruise after cut
Can't wash away my scars
This is the night of, salvation
On the Night of Salvation
This life always pained me
Tired of the same old routine
All lies I've told
Can't hide the little things
This is the night of, salvation
On the night of salvation
Life has been left behind me
I will not cower away
Adrenaline stronger than ever
Feel it all come together
On the night of, salvation
On the night of salvation
Life has been left behind me
I will not cower awayYou put your faith in Christianity
I put mine in artillery
My M-16, my lord and savior
Christ never done me a motherfucking favor
[Chorus]
Pay for all of those in pain
For those who died in vain
Scars from battle nevermore
Still we march off to
War
War
War
War is my shepherd
Hate it if we can't comprehend it
Kill it if we don't understand it
Pray to god and your fate is sealed
As you die alone in the killing fields
[Chorus]
Farwell, Graham and Farahkahn
They need god, I need napalm
Praise the lord and pass the ammunition
My sermon is my demolition
War
War is
War is my
War is my shepherdI am the wind that tears your sails
The broken cross rejecting nails
I am the holy crucified
Yet sinful are my lusts and pride - I
I am ashes I am dust
I'm always held within disgust
Don't follow me for I mislead
Yet all these words you never heed - I
I'm the junkie with a gun
Pushing people's opium
Floating round the universe
I'm driving in my cosmic hearse
I'm intrusion I defy
I am immortal, never die
I am to take you hell and back
The one to break you on the rack
Suffer torment anguish pain
I'll violate all your domains
I am lies and I am truth
I am the portent, I am youth - I
I am the future and the past
Except the now which cannot last
I am Death Church, I am peace
Yet never granting sweet release
My betrayal burns your pain
For I beget you, you become me
You are, betrayed
Yet you still want to play the game
You're victim, you'll expire
Feeding life and all desire
Your life, your pain
Searching for your eternal gain
Flesh is weak, but still it calls
You who makes your own flesh crawl
Covet, your soul
You will never have your own
Thoughts betray and falsify
Now You see that I am I(Chor)
When the dark overpowers the light
Stars Become Bright
When there's no one left to trust but you
Hold on to you soul
Set yourself a goal
Don't stop until you've got where you wanted to
The land was a mess
They said it his fault
Some Jazz about stress
That weren't the cause
There was no contract, no clause
But then it dawned
Was this some kind of test
The time
Probably the best i've ever had
Never happier
Wanted nothing more
But it all seems so mad
Throwing away everything
Breaking down the door
But life's a party
And thats what we're here for
(Chor)
When the dark overpowers the light
Stars Become Bright
When there's no one left to trust but you
Hold on to you soul
Set yourself a goal
Don't stop until you've got where you wanted to

copyright 1997Scorching through the icy skies, filled with manic rage
Battle of the Titans, tonight they will invade
Sorcerers around us behold the demon fire
The Swords of Darkness at their side, veild and awesome power
As the battle rages on, the heavens are destroyed
Darkness falls around, you're lost within a void
Damned are the defiant, cursed are their souls
Those who've felt the wrath of god, many lives they've stole
Will they ever forget the wicked war they fought
Metal mutants feed upon the corpses as they rot
All you hear are battle cries & blood that pours like rain
Swords of Darkness rule at last & send you to your grave
Now the time is running out you know the end is near
The entity in black has come to feed upon your fears
The wizards cast their final blows to ashes fall the gods
Destruction of another world, the light is all but gone
As the battle rages on the heavens are destroyed
Darkness falls around you, you're lost within a void
Scorching through the icy skies, filled with manic rage
Battle of the Titans, tonight they will invade
Sorcerers around us behold the demon fire
The Swords of Darkness at their side, veild and awesome power
As the battle rages on, the heavens are destroyed
Darkness falls around, you're lost within a voidInto the riot!
It was me, trapped in my underground world.
It was my men, attacking me with enormity and dirt.
Into the corridors I follow...
In the pathways I'm killing everythig in my way.
There were another fray in the corridor "K"
My wife Syphry was dealing "The Betray."
Shadow's Riot has begun with severity
The revolt was going on with obscurity
My world is collapsing and my kingdom falls
I am not giving in, rather getting into...
Into the riot!
Into the corridors I follow...
And feeling the hand of an angel lightens my way
When I reached onto the fray in the corridor "K"
I have seen the faces of darkness in betray
My Riot has begun with severity
The revolt was going on with obscurity
My world is collapsing and my kingdom falls
I am not giving in, rather getting into...
I felt that she was killed
So I let you killing me so that I could see her again...In the very last days of judgment
I shall spread my spirit
Upon every flesh
Your sons and your daughters
They shall be prophets
And on this day it shall be done
Yes, upon my servants
I shall spread my spirit
And on this day, they shall inherit
For the first time you have to make a choice
Would you look down
Or look to the stars
To the ocean and far beyond
To the earth that is to erupt
To the red sky, to the storm
To the people who must die now?
A new cross rises on the hills of Jerusalem
Held by the arms of a stronger Christ
Now this is the very beginning of the end
Now lies have to be broken
Yes, cursed be betrayers
For they shall be left behind
And on this day, grace shall be redefined
For the first time you have to make a choice
Would you look down
Or look to the stars
To the ocean and far beyond
To the earth that is to erupt
To the red sky, to the storm
To the people who must die now?
Every one of us must know
That we are the very last ones

It's so bright that it is blinding
A new cross rises on the hills of Jerusalem
Now that all of your nations
Are burned to the ground
Now that the words have no meanings

Be warm or be forgotten
Yes, upon the faithfuls
I shall spread my spirit
And on this day they shall inherit

You're so full of yourself there isn't any room for me
And it's so hard to fit in a place where there's no space free
And you're trying so hard to impress
And you're dazzled by your own reflection
Everything is supposed to involve you - You're convinced that I'm too self-obsessed
Listen once - maybe twice to other than your own voice
However incredibly fantastic and enchanting it might be
Listen once - that would be nice, but you're spellbound by your own voice
You're spellbound by your own voice ... I see
When will I ever count in your universe
And will there come a time when your needs won't come first
And the world is your oyster, your toy - I don't know I think you're goddamn annoying
You announce all you say as if it were gems - mankind should be thankful for
Listen once - maybe twice to other than your own voice
However incredibly fantastic and enchanting it might be

This is the end
You live your life and I'll live mine
Four years I wasted on you
I should have saw the signs
I think I've finally learned
And it's time for me to let it burn
Pre Chorus:
I'll supply the flame
Scatter the ashes of our memories
I don't need them anymore
Chorus:
So many times I took you back
So many times I let you in
But, never again (But, never again. Never again)So many things were left unsaid
So many promises untrue
This is the end (God let me forget, I need to forget)
As easily as my pen writes down these words
I'll erase your memory from my mind
As easily as my pen writes down these words
I'll sign my final farewell to you
You will never see my face again
Don't you dare call me your friend
I should have listened when they said
Promises never last forever
Three strikes you're out, they say
Foolish me I gave you two other
I'm done with you and your lies
Go ruin some other guy
No more chances, no more flaws
Are you happy with the damage you've caused
Pre Chorus:
I'll supply the flame
Scatter the ashes of our memories
I don't need them anymore
Chorus:
So many times I took you back

You will never see my face again
Don't you dare call me your friend
I've regained my composure
This is my closureThe empire beyond the seas
When sun does not decease
Glory to my king
Greatest is our land
Honour and glory to my good king
King of both the land and sea
We wish may god save my king
For ever I will the prince
From Uruguay to Philippines
But my sigh of remorse
Just prays god for peace and force
Tears in my eyes never convince
But more defy with weight of sins
To reply to my pain
With more punish once again
But the pride
To decide
My people's fate
Makes me fight
For their right
At any rate
Because Spain is my kingdom
Like a golden dream of greatness
Our olden land will sing
Songs of the glory
Songs of our king
O, Philip the Second
By our lord enthroned
With all power
I can't fall power
It's the hour
Death is around
(The Prince is dead laying in his bed)
Is this, Lord, my reward
(Mourning and pain the king's insane)
My places will be Escorial
Built, in place esoterical
The earth and heaven will be one
Forgetting the loss of my son
(Magia, sueos, son sus dueos, sombras, gritos en sus ritos)
In my nightmares, I see a black dog
Keeper of the hell's door
Coming our from fog
Whispers of the dream of Solomon
(Rojas llamas, negras damas, duelo eterno, cielo, infierno)
The horoscopes foretell
Hanna be my Queen
And from our love spell
An heir's been foreseen
Never dies
The spirit of sacrifice
Of my king who gives
His life so that his dream lives
For his land
He makes what can't understand
No one useless him
God and him"I love you! I love you more than Jesus!" [Lucifer, The Prophecy]
Jam ciemny jest wÅrÃ³d wichrÃ³w pÅomieÅ boÅ¼y,

Dissappear - There music starts.
The whole new form it gives me,
Calls me up - Above reality...
I'm opening strange new worlds
Carried by the hands of destiny,
Which take me up beyond the time...
Where awareness and dreams become the same
Beyond the start and the end!
Messages, signs and the magic
In the air - The vision starts.
The notes are playing
Games of fantasy - Maze of a genius.Do you believe in heaven above
Do you believe in love
Don't tell a lie; don't be false or untrue
It all comes back to you
Open fire!
On my burning heart
I've never been lucky in love
My defenses are down; a kiss or a frown
I can't survive on my own
If a girl walks in and carves her name on my heart
I'll turn and run away
Every day we've all been led astray
It's hard to be lucky in love
It gets in your eyes
It's making you cry
Don't know what to do (don't know what to do)
You're looking for love
Calling heaven above
Send me an angel
Right now
Empty dreams can only disappoint
In a room behind your smile
But don't give up
Don't give up
You can be lucky in love
It gets in your eyes
It's making you cry
Don't know what to do (don't know what to do)
You're looking for love
Calling heaven aboveTan solo una vez ms, dejame que intente explicar
Cuantas cosas quedaron atrs sin acabar
Solo un recuerdo quedo de una vida entre los dos
Ahora todo termin y nada puedo hacer
Espero el da en que al fin pueda encontrar
Una fuerza una esperanza con la que soar
Toda la vida es mucho tiempo para no poder amar
Te siento tan cerca y no es verdad se que nunca volvers
Refugio de recuerdos sin presente vagars
La ltima lgrima caer
Un alma solamente y muchas vidas que morir
Quisiera tenerte junto a mi
Quisiera ver tu luz una vez ms, ser esclavo de tu amor
Tener otra vez la oportunidad de poderte demostrar
Que no fu nada sin t, nunca te podr olvidar
Hoy solo puedo llorar y verte en mi imaginacin
Casi te puedo tocar, recordndoteI open my eyes
there's nothing I can see
except the blood dripping knife
on my own hand
I sniff the air
there's nothing I can smell
except the stench of human corpse
which lays on the ground
I touch the flesh
there's nothing I can feel
except wounds of sliced body
coldness of the deadSo much for reaping what you sow
Isn't time the enemy again
Believing cuts deeper than you know
Never was a natural believer in the end
Through these eyes
Images and stories
Left unheard, slowly burn
In these skies are centuries of promises
Unlearned never learned
Holding out what's coming in
Keeps the heart from burning
[chorus]
With those miracles and dreams
Taking all my senses and colouring between
Miracles and dreams
How can I get by without the harmony within, do you know
Tomorrow could be taken from your hand,
Yes it can
After this wave your world goodbye
And never kiss your love again
If I'm strong enough
And live long enough
I still believe in those
[chorus]
-The distinction between past, present and future is only an illusion.
[chorus]I am a being
My life has value
Seek as I seek the secret design
My purpose is to relate with out bitterness
Or partiality from any motives
To which I am far removed
Fueled by antagonism
Accelerated panic
Headed towards a catastrophic event
Penetrating thoughts
Negative impressions
I don't feel
I can't shed a tear for all the unnumbered dead
Desperate and exhausted the human character lays wasted
Like emotional distortion
Death is perceptible with definable features
I've had all that I can takeWhat's your pleasure
No one needs to know
No one needs to know
I'm in league with strangers, I'm talking all the time
How's the weather?
When I need the danger, I find it every time
Come whatever
'Cause I'm damned if I'll be chastised
For my healthy wholesome pastimes
And I pray that I'll remain forever more
In the pleasure room, the pleasure room
The pleasure room, the pleasure room
No one needs to know
Is the weakness winning? Scared of what you'll find
Pain or pleasure
If your dream are damning, are you the forgiving kind
For now, forever?
All at once I feel the weight of what I've seen
And how I've prayed
That one day I'll be safe, forever more
In the pleasure room, the pleasure room
The pleasure room, the pleasure room
No one needs to know
As I weep inside my prison cell
I keep alive my private hell
I pray that I'll remain forever more
In my pleasure room, my pleasure room
My pleasure room, my pleasure room
My pleasure room, my pleasure room
My pleasure room, my pleasure room
No one needs to know
No one needs to know
No one needs to know
No one needs to know
No one needs to knowSoy el rey de la selva
Por su bien no se acerca
En esta jaula o afuera
Soy el rey de la selva
Mato al que no se acuerda
A huevo te hacen perro
Por chingon soy tu dueo
Soy el jefe de prisioneros
Por tu bien no te acercas
Si quieres pedo aqui lo tengo
Pendejo! qu me estas viendo?
Soy el rey de la selva
Y permiso necesitas
Pa'sentarte o cagarte
Pa'el papel pa'limpiarte
Soy el pinche rey
Ya incate gey
Me gusta cuando estas llorando
Mecos de negro estas tragando
Por tu muerte estas rezando
Como perro obediente
Chupas pitos de mis clientes.Hladno je, na ivici stojim sam, brojim korake
Koji me vode ka dnu
Sunce je vec odavno zaslo, sa neba zvezde nestaju,
Ostaje samo mrak...
Dajte mi sva svitanja beskrajna da dusu opijem,
Dok ispijam pehar do dna.
Vratite mi sve igre iz detinjstva, moc da verujem
Da vecnost je ispred nas.
Na krilima umornih jata dusa nek mi putuje
Odavde do vecnosti!
Tonem u san dok lisce me prekriva,
U nocima jos gorim sa svecama...
Jos jedan dan novi otvara krug,
Ja gledam sunce radja se, a znam zaci ce.
Dajte mi sve kljuceve vremena
Da mladost sakrijem u beskraju svemira.
Kad postanem prah,
Da ostanu iza mene neka secanja
Da zive u pesmama...
Tonem u san dok lisce me prekriva,
U nocima jos gorim sa svecama...Show me the way after
Feel the pain before my eyes
Pull the veil before my face
Feel my pain from inside
Will the flowers cry at my grave
Passing pictures fly by my mind
My last kiss life aside
Last dream again then I die
Wrap me in your arms of silence
Drape me in your dark cloak
Set aside a candle by my name
Wither flowers forever more
I face the shadows of all my fear
I grief in despair when I see it all
Night above the light and so below
I stumble forward for the fall
As darkness closed my eyes
I will find the way after
Behold my eyes of pain
Tears pour fall soft like rain
Life has now turn gray
Look to death now I'm not afraidSince the day that you were born the wheels are in motion
Turning ever faster
Play your part in the big machine
The stage is set, the road is chosen
You fate preordained
We are watching you, every step of the way
Never too late to stand your ground,
Revolution begins
In you, in me, revolution!
Once lost
Lost in their game
Mental chains breaking now
Set yourself free
Who are they to tell you what to do?
The stage is not set, the road is not chosen
Your fate not preordained
They are losing control, every step of the way
Never too late to stand your ground,
Revolution begins
In you, in me, revolution!I remember the dreamwind
filling my sails then blowing me off course
I remember the blue sky
the follies of youth and a wish to die
I remember things held close
thrown away and forgotten
I foresee that it will come true
this my wind now blows for you
calling calling
across the blue
I remember the black heart
the knowledge of age and the falling apart
I remember the feelings I lack
and the friendships that were a stab in the back
calling calling
across the blue
I will burn this page today
I will throw my life away
I just do not want to stay
I give it all to the beautiful sea
calling calling
across the blue
calling calling
across the blue
to the distant greyAnother boy in lost again
under our horrified eyes
one by one are swallowed and
what we hear are parent's cries
a weekend with drunk friends
and your ride home ia a funeral march
can't you see it makes no sense
to blow your head and drive your car
High velocity comes in control of their vehicles
their reflexes decreased by deafening noise
irresponsible youth back to town from the farest disco
treating danger as the new exciting toy
I doubt you'll have fun under this ground, I really doubt it
I doubt you'll have fun under this ground, I really doubt it
let's see you dancing as the bells sound
CHORUS
Senseless way for you to die
is your life worth just a dime?
one day is left for goodbye
forever you'll pay for your crime
After a too long night spent in wild thrashing
you feel no pain and your brain is washed away
overnigth heroes put na end to this abusing
you crash and burn and death is the price you pay
I doubt you'll have fun under this ground, Ireally doubt it
I doubt you'll have fun under this ground , I fuckin'doubt it
let's see you dancing as the bells sound
CHORUS
Senseless way for you to die
is your life worth just a dime?
one day is left for goodbye
forever you'll pay for your crimeI can still watch those eyes
crawling over her dress until
I could show you everything
but I dont have to hear the words
cause I already feel your thoughts
so it comes as no surprise
that all the intent is real
all the suspects are right
if we stop
it all falls down
cover my eyes
obey my ignorance
to purify you
Ill only watch you rot
without malicious intent
your doubt resembles someone else
stick the needles in me
stick the needles in [3x]
if we watch
it all come down
breathe and let it go
dropped and winding
fuck your confession
fuck your confusion
dissolve my insides
make it hide
crawling on diginity
that which you do to me
hold on forever

Lengthened years have built my mind, memories undeo
Yet with instability one thing stands too clear
Lady perfection, mystery, of whom I shed a tear
Airwoven divinity, mind, soul in victory
Cured of her malady, could this be my lost;
Ligeia
Airwoven divinity, mind, soul in victory
Cured of her malady, could this be my lost;
Ligeia
Sickness fell upon Ligeia, all knew she would die
Midnight came to lay her rest, farewell
Opium dreams, grief-stricken years, I took another bride
Replacing that which I did have, Ligeia why
Airwoven divinity, mind, soul in victory
Cured of her malady, could this be my lost;
Ligeia
Airwoven divinity, mind, soul in victory
Cured of her malady, could this be my lost;
Ligeia
Chronic disease, my luck cursed
My new wife has died
Coming from her bed of death, I thought I heard her cry
Could a corpse cold, stiff, sedate, sob in the bed it lie
Approaching her, I chilled to stone, for it did swiftly rise
I can never be mistaken, there were, they were Ligeia's eyes
Airwoven divinity, mind, soul in victory
Cured of her malady, could this be my lost;
Ligeia
Air woven divinity, tears shed, vitality
Cured of her malady, yet this is my lost;Today I'll take revenge for my solitary life,
for the desolation and the devastatingvoid.
You pretend love that pushed me
into this darkness.
I was afraid of you,
but I loved you
until it burnt me from the inside.
I adored you, I hated you.
Sometimes my love was like a gaping hole
that tried to swallow me.
With words came lies,
you took my world apart.
Back then I learned to hate
and you taught me well.
You will hear the sound of my broken heart
before I'll destroy you
and before you vanish into the cold void.
You'll know what you've done to me.
I was afraid of you,
but I loved you
until it burnt me from the inside.
I adored you, I hated you.
Sometimes my love was like a gaping hole
that tried to swallow me.
or the desolation and the de
With words came lies,
you took my world apart.
Back then I learned to hate
and you taught me well.

I FOLLOW THOSE TRACES UNKNOWN

AND OVER THE VALLEYS I RIDE
THE WILD CHASE A-GLOW
CAUSE MY RESTLESS HEART'S IN A CONSTANT FLOW
THE BLISS OF THE MOMENT IN ME
IT IS LIKE AMBROSIA
A DOVELIKE TEMPTATION FOR ME
THE WILD CHASE IS MY ENDLESS SYMPHONY
I'M GATHERING FORCE EVERYTIME
WHEN SYLVAN DEITIES SMILE
TIME SEEMS TO BE OUT OF JOINT SUDDENLY
AND I WANT TO ROAM FOR A WHILE
WILD CHASE, THIS TRACE
IT'S CALLING ME
YOUR GRACE, EMBRACE

[CHORUS]
[CHORUS]Can't feel the rush that I used to
It's as you weren't there
I can't straighten my back right
I am so in despair
Now it's dark and I can't see
What the dreams carry to me
If tomorrow is gone
I would feel more comfort
And if
If tomorrow is gone
I would be alone then
Can't feel the rush that I used to
It's as you weren't there
I can't straighten my back right
I am so in despair
Now it's dark and I can't see
What the dreams carry to me
If tomorrow is gone
I would feel more comfort
And if
If tomorrow is gone
I would be alone thenHate - memories tear me apart
Live - never thougt it wold be that hard
Time - always knew on my side
Death - seems to be the only bride
'Cause you didn't follow me
'Cause you didn't follow me
Love - a never unknown feeling I lost
Pain - I never thought I'd count the cost
Feel - you finally made me loose it
Mind - I think you gotta prove me
[Chorus]
Somebody to catch my fall
Somebody to close the distance
In my circle of tragedy
Somebody to share my sorrow
Somebody who I believe in
Somebody to follow me
Do you remember - a walk along the river
In the valley of our dreams
The other side of pain is rising high again
And makes me cry
[Chorus]
Forgotten problems they've darkened
the horizon
Life's no more what it seems
The other side of pain is rising high again
And makes me cry
[Chorus]Homage now has been made to the Lord of fire
Whorship of the chosen one not the christ the liar
Baptised in the flames of Hell to recieve the seal
Unholy blessings are recieved from the sacred rites
Soldiers unto Lucofer perform their evil pleights
Rejecting Heaven's lies to accept the truth
God's blood being spilled for immortal truth
God is deadA vast disease, spread throughout the land
An eternal wasteland, sin is not banned
Sores of grief, blisters of pain
A world of corruption, where Satan does reign
Sinners are plagued with death
Accepted by the population
As a lifestyle of freedom
What a very loose basis
To kill a kingdom
Ignorance of such sickness
Is usually ended in flight
There is a cure in Christ
Jesus kills the plague
When your mind is in a snag
Give your life to Him
And he'll cleanse you from sin
Sinners are plagued with hellthey're laughing, they're laughing - once I...
they're nothing, they're nothing... once I...
don't try again
I really want to fly, I never give up hope - I cry
they know nothing from me, myself and I
they know nothing from me, myself and I
they're nothing, they're nothing - once I...
from me, myself and I
the start - your life - your death - your pride
downEl crudo invierno ya llego
Ha venido a por m
Y el fro que ahora siento
Nunca antes sent
Desde aqu el cielo esta gris
Ahora s lo que perd
Y no lo pude impedir...
Maldigo al viento
Que ha borrado mi rastro
Me impide ver de donde vengo
Le planto cara
Y me obligo a seguir
sabiendo que no tengo a donde ir...
Tanto luchar para esto
Y ahora te veo tan lejos
Debo seguir
No quiero olvidarte
Aunque s que ya es tarde
Viaj del cielo a la tierra.
Aoro aquella ingenuidad
Que me hacia feliz
Hoy s que entonces era ciego
Y era mejor as
Esa frgil felicidad
Se fue y no volver
A por lo que queda de m.
Una y mil veces
He soado despierto
Y he llorado en silencio.
S que al final
No ser mas que una
Huella muy fcil de borrar...
Tanto luchar para esto
Y ahora te veo tan lejos
Debo seguir
No quiero olvidarte
Aunque s que ya es tarde
Viaj del cielo a la tierra.All the things you've been told that you keep inside
Find it easy to hide
I want to know what divides you
I only want you to lose
For the fear lives inside you
Listen to the sound
Of your dreams
Like whispers they scream
Wake me from my sleep to find the
World's on fire
Trying hard to reach and still I
Can't get higher
This can't be a dream you see it
Cuts like wire
Wake me from this dream I want to
Burn
Cada cosa que guardas dentro de ti
Es difcil mentir
I want to know what divides you
I only want you to lose
For the fear lives inside you
Listen to the sound
Of your dreams
Like whispers they scream
Wake me from my sleep to find the
World's on fire
Trying hard to reach and still I
Can't get higher
This can't be a dream you see it
Cuts like wire
Wake me from this dream I want to
Burn
Wake me from my sleep to find the
World's on fire
Trying hard to reach and still I
Can't get higher
This can't be a dream you see it
Cuts like wire
Wake me from this dream
(Why don't you?)
Wake me from my sleep to find the
World's on fire
(Burn)
Trying hard to reach and still I
Can't get higher
(Burn)
This can't be a dream you see it
Cuts like wire
(Burn)
Wake me from this dream I want to
Burn[Instrumental]As pride precedes a downfall, so he took his place before the firewall
Of dissonant choirs whose faith in one
Was embraced in this wraith whose fate was hung
Between forgiveness and the damage done
An electric scent over drear decay
Lent a violent surge to their serenades
Through white glades as his winged parade
Bent to silhouette and to sharpen dull razors
Within vast skies unversed in starkness
His might grew
And blew light hues to gray
And worse, a third of stars to darkness
Then thunder seethed and wreathed in thickening night
A line was drawn midst wrong and right and across the throats of thieves
As love fell choked, the tempest broke from Heaven's farthest shore
Descending to eclipse all hope, repentance might stay holy war
He would not heel nor fake a bow
Murmur curses to the wind
Enraged, he raved in a Balrog howls
Upon a storm firstborn of sin
Incensed anew, rebellions tore
Like frenzied beasts of prey
Through temple doors
Through east before the midnight masses
And where once bliss reigned so serene
In sweeter glades
Now veins ran openly
Like eyes that shied from kindred ashes
When suddenly there shone a hideous light
And a voice like three inanities soared up in thistled speech
Thou hast bred hate where there dwelt none and for this grave mistake
How thou art falling morning sun
The proud will be abased
He would not heel
Nor fake a bow
Murmur curses to the wind
And lo the wrath of God swept down
Thou art no more an Angel filled with light
But a leech to be abhorred
And thou shalt suffer my burning will
Quoth this raven nevermore
Never fucking more
And with these words like heavy stone cast against that gilded throne
With many legions still in tow, he turned his wings to flee
His eyes a picture of distaste, dawn to tears and in their place
The dawn of time and fates to face, through all eternity
I wept for him a deep red river that ran like blood through scarred ravines
To sluice away the guilt that slithered like a Serpent tongue to Eve
For once as I in Heaven climbed too high for truth to truly see
My sunken mind, drunken and blind, saw the lie that fool was me
Alone and cold, face to the crack
Beyond dark gates with no way back
His crown of gold faded to black
Like a bruise upon the heart that lingers
With thrill-kill
Culture shock wave lengths
Of rope to hang high
Ten commandments by snaked about his upraised fingersTrapped by iron bars
Solitary ripping at me inside
A victim of this crazy ward
Must get out of here
No one gets out of here
Force fed medication
The more I take the sooner I'm free
Contributing to my mind's abduction
Can't they see it's tearing me
Can't they see it's killing me
[Chorus]
Welcome to the 3rd floor
It's a one way trip
Then they lock the door
More than just a crazy nightmare
Doors opened up and swallowed me
Banished from existence
Why'd they ever throw away the key
Will I ever be set freei cannot, i will not support your lies, innocent organization the disguise, but in truth a business that feeds from the pockets of those seeking innocence. preaching words of hate, unfounded hate, and you remain in spite of this. integration of the lifestyles you wish kept from your lives, a belief for the people you see fit in your eyes. i will not be broken. you can not destoy me. why can't we accept diversity? immunity...IntroEn Edirnir tokulu lik Baldrs ok Flutti til saever.

Blacked out eyes in an existence overgrown
Never fall back down
Trapped in myself
Sold my hands
Envy them
Can't find the one
I slowly start to cut pieces of flesh from my body
Dig in and dissect
Collecting examples of what the outside world sees
Under it all
I know the devastation I have caused
Upon myself and this world
Speak to me freely
I am listening[Instrumental]Looking back I remember feeling stronger
We must have been invincible
Join the war for integrity's sake
Hoping our presence would be enough
Take to the air
The siren sounds and duty is calling
Meet our enemies there
Praying we will make it back alive
As we soar across the sky
I can't help but wonder why
As our enemies draw near
Our hearts are void of all fear
Memories flash before our eyes
Our last thoughts before we die
Recalling what had brought us here
As you plummet out of sight
I WATCHED YOU FALL TO YOUR GRAVE
I'D FIGHT BY YOUR SIDE IN HELL
TO BRING YOU BACK
BROTHER!
Smoldering wreckage is all that's left
Is this your reward?
I never thought we would kill for our beliefs
I never thought we would have to pay with our lives
As we soar across the sky
I can't help but wonder why
As our enemies draw near
Our hearts are void of all fear
Memories flash before our eyes
Our last thoughts before we die
Recalling what had brought us here
As you plummet out of sight
I WATCHED YOU FALL TO YOUR GRAVE
I'D FIGHT BY YOUR SIDE IN HELL
TO BRING YOU BACK
BROTHER!
Freedom comes at a price
Your life now part of the debt
Brother give me the strength to fly on
When the air raid sirens blare
BROTHER!Generations
A nuclear family
Centres of small worlds which itch for attraction
In stillness of spin
Energy
Potential for creation
Interactions
Merry go round hierarchy
Forces of nature in motion for aeons
Invalid or potent
Potency
Empowered and charged
We savour the flavours of
Strangeness, beauty, and charm
And we're sensing the truth
But our questions stay unanswered
And the thought of god still elude us
Thoughts of god. Gods thoughtsThis twisted wretched place shadowed
By the utmost darks of hell
In dreams of black beyond the bounds
Of a withered witch's spell
Where the doors surely are locked
When the sun threatens to wane
Where shamblers dwell in dim moon light
Beyond the warmth of day
Liars line the roads at dawn
Watchful eyes are upon you held
Sacred weapons to the sacred revealed
To be unleashed upon the council of hell
Blood flows down the streets at night
Where wolves cry out for flesh
Where a horrible curse taints the woodlands nearby
With the forms of the walking dead
Unholy inversion of hope
Twisting the faith of the meek into hate
Driven insane by the dark one
To bring fourth the foul biddings he speaks
The undead are among us
At dawn they shrink back to their silken beds
They dance by night and drink the blood
Of a child's broken neck
His spires are growing taller
Still their shadows spreading throughout the land
Freeing the evils that sleep within the weaker minds of man
Into the tower never go the horrors multiply
The gears can mince the strongest ones
Leaving heroes paralyzed
The rivers flow with poison, the sands swallow you whole
The ghouls that roam this darkened wood
Are thirsting for your throat
Unholy inversion of hope
Twisting the faith of the meek into hate
Driven insane by the dark one
To bring forth the foul biddings he speaks
The undead are among us
At dawn they shrink back to their silken beds
They dance by night and drink the blood
Of a child's broken neck
His spires are growing taller
Still their shadows spreading throughout the land
Freeing the evils that sleep within the weaker minds of manOh grief, oh pain, delivering me to hopelessness,
oh selfabsorbing perverse lust that turns me on this hell to bless
this rigid life of disincentive I've begun
provides the cage of frozen time that keeps my mind from going on
solum permaneo in velamene lapideo qiud ipse sustineo
No hands to clutch, no consolation
assistance all in vain for my soul lacks will to join salvation
depths of indolence, oh shelter my intellect
keep me from reflection that may urge a useless force to act
Got a brain with dancing shadows got a face with lightness eyes
when I'm searching for connexion with no hope to realise
Activity is useless for you've no chance to succeed
every strive for alteration is their mockery to feedInnocence is fragile like the wind
Cold hearts can tear it down
It's hard to find some sanctuary
I know your feel's just like the world
Is on your shoulders
And you won't survive if it gets any colder
Angels - wait for tomorrow
Before you smile you gotta cry sometimes
Angels - a new day will followEven angels need to learn how to fly
Listen close to the child inside you
Beggin' to be set free
You've lost your way
And your heart is needing shelter
I know you feel the walls are
Closing all around
Hold on, it won't be long
Before you break 'em down
Angels - wait for tomorrow
Before you smile you gotta cry sometimes
Angels - a new day will followEven angels need to learn how to fly
Believe in all your dreams
And reach for the sky
So hard all alone
Fightin' thru the pain
Some day you'll stand up
Strong and unafraid
And then you'll see the sun
Right behid the rain
Spread your wings
Angels - wait for tomorrow
Before you smile you gotta cry sometimes
Angels - a new day will follow
Even angels need to learn how to fly
Angels - wait for tomorrow
Before you smile you gotta cry sometimes
Angels - a new day will follow
Even angels need to learn how to fly
Angels - angels
Angels - angels
Angels - angels
Angels - angels
Even angels need to learn how to flyBobby said, "Fuck spendin' 50 on a whip, buy a clip"
Mental flip, got a thousand tracks thought on a chip
Said he had mad toys to make noise
You split and separate drums like asteroids
The concerned producer sampled this question
Hit him with the beat for the answer, with extra compression
When sound travel, it quickly grab you
And equalizes the pitch up, until it have you
Bugged out, tryin' to think you can match this
The portrait's too graphic
Panoramic view for you, stamp Wu
The feature Gothic, the outcome will be catastrophic
We wrote block-tic checkpoints on your next joint
And who the nigga you anoint?
700 volts on the track to slay
Murderous wordplay displayed, for killin' cascades
Throwin' bullets in the air to test wind
And which way the cyclone spins
Counter on clockwise, still civilized
Kill spies on the wall, that still flies all dies
Give no extension on the lynchin'
It's tension if the name of the Clan is mentioned
It's the aura that's felt, that causes one to flash his gun
And reveal how he really feel, confirmed
He'll never live after the show, see the promoted for the dough
I'm takin', breakin' his wax
Throw my shit on to perform my selection from the Swarm
Day 2 breaks, it's a stormy Monday
My ninjas lay in ravines and ditches
Underneath shrubs and leaves
They breathed through underwater reeds
The enemy walks above
Clan remain subterranean mud
Off shore banks, tanks approach the location
Bombarded by the circle of death formation
Telecom lines are sniped from these low altitude strikes
Shatterin' bulletproof helmets with scrap nail fragments of cell
Inhale these venomous thoughts that I propel
Through the north facility, the city must suffer at the hand
Of the Chief's command, volts is in
At 3 minute intervals the heat intenses
Deadenin' the power from electrical fences
Defenses are down, shake a nigga up
Bounce him off the sound
You know what I'm sayin'?
The God ca-diver, in the streets of Iris
We talk about sex, money and drugs
Ruled by power
And y'all cats don't know
What it's about
(Love and power)
It goes deeper than what you see on TV
Killah Priest, come on
Burnin' desire, ebony eyes
Painted toe nails, legacys die
Drivin' by the well, Egyptian queens, Arabian shieks
Are paid to knock off rich kings for the joy some sing
Graveyards filled with scarlet widows
Who stabbed they husbands
Sleepin' on silk pillows, blood on they robes
Disguised as beggar in cheap wool clothes
Lambs and wolfs in black hoods, pull out they gats
Like magic wands, castin' spells, sendin' niggaz to Hell
Trappin' they souls in realms, baptize 'em with holy water
Springin' on the heads of plenty witches' daughters
Interviews with the richest reporters
Silent nights over the dividers, a 1000 Muslim bibles
For the cobbler, Hebrews flee to the hills of Masada
For the love of God, guns make a loud sound
I'ma show you how thugs get down
Shoot outs, bullets turn into bloodhounds and hunt you down
Cursed nation, lost generation
X-Files, describe them in the future as cosmic rulers
Fallen angels from space intruders
Dyin' saints, blood spilled on the floor like wet paint
See it in the pictures, read it like the lost scriptures
Dissolve it with your 100 proof liquor
Ha, I shot the sheriff and the deputy secondly
Threatenin' the lives of those who threaten me
Lessenin' my chances of defeat by predeterminin' the victory
As taught by Sun Tzu in the chapter
After the third one, I heard my words shall be bombed
Regardless to anything or anyone
I die by the gun, my life has just begun
Thought I was livin' all along, but I was wrong
This long road I have to travel in countless battles
These filthy snakes with poison fangs and rattles
Kings, queens and pharaohs change to cattle
I'm able to subtract the devil's arrow
Singin' at his eyes on the sparrow, mind narrow
2 positions, horoscopes and tarots
Hark harolds, angels and Christmas carols
Raven images hang from the mantels
Man made slaves and modern day babbles
Raw from Africa and golden ropes and sandles
By wicked thieves and vandals
Aho man-handled us with leather whips and burnin' candles
And rambled through our castle, leavin' niggaz shambles
Stole our golden sodas like some Arab camels
We gazed, amazed and baffled as he loaded his ammo
With to the barrel and blasted out our bone marrow
We went to Gretal and the Hansel
Tricked by this wicked jackel
Children of my grand old daddy, have me
In mind were they lost in this wilderness blind?A night of december so dark and cold,
I walked a path ages old
The moon amongst the clouds revealed
lightning valleys, forest and field
Embraced by silence I wandered the moor
an endless landscape by my side
when in the mist I saw a light
dancing through the hazy night
I stood and watched the play in awe
was deeply touched by what I saw
I told my friends what I did see
and what they told did tremble me!
It's said the ghost of a young, fair maid
is cursed to dwell beneath the shade
of the olden oak she died below
O that was many moons ago!Porterage down
The dark gross chapel
The stepped streets around now
Sells person mobile
Porterage down
Dark gross chapel
The stepped streets around now
Was introduced by a woman loose-limbed, slim
One look up to a whitewashed ugly wall
Whoosh made worse by dirty postcards
Trapped in their town
Their bracing criminals in panicky hall
No time for The Fall group
I'll put you down
Porterage down
To the dark gross chapel
These stepped streets around now
[So's cro-cellar...]
I'll put you down
To the gross chapel
You were right said Peter
Dying for a smoke
But you should've said to them please
[Job's idea] how little they [...]
[Like Canava's] coming up assaulted
They were as fed up as I was
Waiting outside after putting blame on you
Porterage down
[I slam] I am ailing
Porterage down
[...]
.Wearing his clothes, they [...]
and their commandos live happy
In that scaly [eard]
Where [air] were commandos
Storm all pallisades
Our leaders will not refuse us
We will [tangle maze]
Throw them from glasses
And about the enemy's ears
Sing
Ta ra ra ra ra
For the British Grenadiers
I'll put you downAshes and promises share a bond
Through the winds of change
Words are blown away
When visions that should be
Are tattooed in your mind
The power to let go
Is sometimes hard to find
The answer cannot be found
In the writing of others
Or the words of a trained mind
In a precious world of memories
We find ourselves confined
Claws so razor sharp
Ripping at the spirit
Promises a potential to hurt
Is anything real?
When forever is to be until
Deep inside, in the world of empty words...
No escaping from those haunting
Empty words...
Do you ever feel it?
A craving that is so strong
To by thought rewind in order to find
Expectations that shined through the doubt
That soon would turn into the price
Of what a word will be worth
When tomorrow comes
To be and we are left
Standing on our own-
And seeing what is real...
The answer cannot be found
In the writing of others
Or the words of a trained mind
In a precious world of memories
We find ourselves confined
Claws so razor sharp
Ripping at the spirit
[Repeat chorus]You don't have to lie, I know exactly where you've been
'Cause you're chewing off my ear while you're chewing on your chin
No we're not on the level, you're just off your face
It's not a state of mind though, your head's just in a state
I may be on the outside but you're empty within
It's getting kind of old now, I think it's time to pack it in
Don't call it a party 'cause it never stops
Now one is too many but it's never enough
Don't tell me you're happy 'cause this isn't love
So be careful what you wish for
So be careful what you wish for
Who you're trying to fool, you know you're in over your head
'Cause you're holding onto heaven but you're hanging by a thread
And we're not on the level, you're just off your face
It's not a state of mind though, your head's just in a state
I may be on the outside but you're empty within
It's getting kind of old now, I think it's time to pack it in
Don't call it a party 'cause it never stops
Now one is too many but it's never enough
Don't tell me you're happy 'cause this isn't love
So be careful what you wish for
So be careful what you wish for
Don't call it a party 'cause it never stops
Now one is too many but it's never enough
Don't tell me you're happy 'cause this isn't love
So be careful what you wish for
Don't call it a party 'cause it never stops
Now one is too many but it's never enough
Don't tell me you're happy 'cause this isn't love
So be careful what you wish for
Don't call it a party 'cause it never stops
Now one is too many but it's never enough
Don't tell me you're happy 'cause this isn't love
So be careful what you wish forA shadow is walking by my side holding a gun
Looking at me with somber eyes
Step by step caught in the ground
Each strides synchronized on me every wills, every faces
The manifestations of my soul, materialized in black
No love, no compassion exist in our blackened heart.
Is there a place for affection in my being???
Hatred under will, massacre of mortality
The blood which taint my face
Is the evidence of our inhumanity
Ligaments of guts around the canon,
the proof of our dedication,
our father purification process.
Shoot!! By commandments from hell
Kill for pleasure, burn human leather
Explode!! Their chest
We are the restorers of life!!!
The blood which taint my face
Is the evidence of our inhumanity
Ligaments of guts around the canon,
the proof of our dedication,
our father purification process.
INFERNAL FLESH MASSACRE
Now that my body is trapped
Behind the walls of human justice
The shadow is still there, as I look at it,
from the head 'til my feet
the voice still whispering my nameDer Teufel trat an meine Wiege
Und stillte mich mit schwarzer Milch.
Der Teufel war auch an deinem Horte
Und gab dir etwas mit.
Er gab dir eine Seele,
Sammt den Sinnen und Verstand
Nun zahlst do dafÃÂ¼r ein Leben lang
Den bitteren Pfand.
Die gÃÂ¼ldene Sonne bringt Leben und Wonne
Die Finsternis weicht
Der Morgen sich zeiget, die RÃÂ¶te aufsteiget
Der Monde verbleicht.
Auch Hoffnung tat er in den faulig Brei
Auf das dein Flehen ihm zum VergnÃÂ¼gen sei
Sehnsuht, Gier und Neid nagen nun an dir
Durch tiefschwarze Nacht schallt's nun ewig
Komm geh mit mir.How much do you think you know?
The truth hides behind all these walls
In the end reality
Will let you be who you can be
Will let you be who you can be
Will let you be who you can be
Will let you be who you can be
Will let you be who you can beThis moment will too pass us by, it's this notion inside all of us
To prioritize through our selfish eyes
To be the bull behind the rampage, the reason for all the riot
We'll feed our flame before wasting time on everyone else's
With more problems and less pride
We'll feed our flame before wasting time on everyone else's
The gallows were not supposed to look like this
Oh God, we live in misery lying here in desperation
We need You here more than anything right now, right now
If everything's relative then why the emptiness in our souls?
If everything's relative then why the emptiness in our souls?
Trying to untie the knot we thought we were untying
Our entire lives we're busied up and burnt out
Everyone together we will strengthen ourselves
Everyone together we will strengthen ourselves
Everyone together we will strengthen ourselves, we will
Because now we know
You won't ever fly fast enough to make time stand still
You won't ever fly fast enough to make time stand still
Stop, listen and learn, stop, listen and learn
You won't ever fly fast enough to make time stand still
Stop, listen and learn
You won't ever fly fast enough to make time stand still
Stop, listen and learn
You won't ever fly fast enough to make time stand still
Stop, listen and learn
You won't ever fly fast enough to make time stand still
Stop, listen and learn[Music: Furni '96]
[Lyrics: Dave Rotten]
Searching Through The Gloomy Night
An Innocent Young Student
Mainly Girls, Mainly Gays
They Are The Weakest Preys
Lurking In The Darkness
Surprising Them From Behind
A Hard Strike On The Head
Snatching Their Consciousness
The Corpse Must Be Alive
While He Takes It To His Home
Then Bound To An Armchair
Down In The Basement
[Pre-Chorus:]
Shaving The Head
And Drawing Pattern Lines
Right Over The Skin
Where To Make The Cut
Opening The Skull
Exposing His Brain
The Victim Is Still Alive
Shrieking In Pain
[Chorus x2:]
A Spoonful Of Grey Mass
Sweet Lobotomy
[Pre-Chorus:]
Shaving The Head
And Drawing Pattern Lines
Right Over The Skin
Where To Make The Cut
[Chorus x2:]
A Spoonful Of Grey Mass
Sweet Lobotomy
It's His Debility, A Delicious Caprice
Only Reserved To Privileged Minds
Every Neuron Must Be Alive
Right From The Skull To His Mouth
All His Knwoledge Will Be Increased
Eating The Biggest Amount Of BrainsNow oppression stalks the remnants of compassion,
Brewing hatred to surface in wicked actions
Cloaked in peace and mercy, force their false confessions
Sentenced am I dying, cleansed from all salvation
"Defy our accusations and a certain death you'll meet
A fool denies the obvious, and fools we shall defeat"
All sanity now vanquished, ever mould beyond control
My guilt stands yet unproven though they still demand my fall
Demand my fall
Blood runs beyond enlightenment at inquisition's hands
Vicious burn the fires swiftly out of hand
Now my fate lies in their "hands of liberation"
Forming law and justice into obscuration
Leading lies ensuring my life ceased in fire,
In the name of peace, to cleance my dark desires
"You stand accused of herasy and all what that implies
With darkened minds you summon those who're fallen from the skies"
Envenomed bleed their poisoned hearts, the power they've abused
A deadly game of envy in which my life I'll lose
Blood runs beyond enlightenment at inquisition's hands
Vicious burn the fires swiftly out of hand
Shackled, fettered - choking as I drown
Fooled and tortured - confess comitted crimes
Shackled, fettered - choking as I drown
Fooled and tortured - confess comitted crimes
Sentenced by superstition - my innocense denied
Truth is strange than fiction - religious genocide
Alone in blind desperation, I face my mournful death
In flames I meet termination, but my memory will be leftI can't see you falling
I can't see you turn and fall apart
It's not easy for you but now
You have no choice it's gone
You can't make it on your own
Time will ease you
From just a little harmless fun
But this is how it's gonna be
And this is my goodbye
You, did you think about me too
Did you hear me when I fell for you
But I say goodbye to you
I can't hear you crying
I can't see you trying to discard
All the good times but now
You know we'll both move on
Most times not lost but gone
Burnt out and faded
From just a little harmless fun
This is how it's gonna be
And this is my goodbye
You, did you think about me too
Did you hear me when I fell for you
But I say goodbye to fun
Just a little harmless fun
This is how it's gonna be
And this is my goodbyeSoldier of sunlight
Welcome to the kingdom of ignorance
Where all the tears of ages tell their tales
No one dares to break the spell
No one dares to fly
Time is running out you can't deny
How many times
Have you found yourself under the influence?
How many times has a mirror mad you cry?
Now it's time to stand upright
Tear down your inner door
The birth of yourself can't wait no more
In your mind there's a battle raging on
Try to find what you're fighting for
[Chorus]
Wake up the king
From his sleep in your fantasy
Wake up the king
Let him be all you ecstasy
Tears flow to rivers
And rivers to oceans of broken dreams
Have you ever heard of tears of joy?
Show yourself a sense of life
Open up your eyes
Let your heartbeat be your best advice
In your eyes I can see the fire burn
Realize, now it is your turn
[Chorus]
Look at the mountain, look at the sun
Feel all the pure energy
Birds fly and whisper, call out your name
They belong to you and you're the
King of a kingdom, light in your hand
Look at what you have never seen
Walk on a rainbow, look to the stars
Cry it out and make your dream come true
[Chorus x 2]
Can't you see the crown?
(...and the vision continued: "There is less sense in complaining than looking for your skills...")New disease
new ways to reach out and torment
one by one
cloned, throats slit and packaged for delivery
Creation of carnage
reproduced for consumption
waste heap sold through fast food
Human is as stupid does
Maggots, burrowed rot worms
thrown in a vat of rice
no escape from carnivorous butchery
swallow salmonella filled carrion
Blood
extract
cloned carcass from DNA
Life
no meaning
there can be no god hereLast night, alone, I met the moon
I saw its halo and the love around
"Now take the path, don't ever lose your time
Just watch the light you have inside"
I watched inside and my eyes burned
The moon was right
Roots so deep, head so high
I want to be in and watch it out
I know the reasons why I failed
The stars illuminate my being
Behold thy servant, you the force around
That makes the planets beLed to the slaughter by those who were there to protect
Nailed to the cross then put on display to dissect
Dignity stripped like flesh being ripped from the bone
Sentence: death by mongrels to which you are thrown
Here comes the pack
Come to attack
Blood in their eyes
No compromise
Thrown to the wolves
Left there to die
Hiding from shadows that chase by the light of the moon
Choking on lies overflowing in silver spoons
Told of the cities of gold and a thousand delights
Fed to the dogs that hunt in the dead of the night
Here comes the pack
Come to attack
Blood in their eyes
No compromise
Thrown to the wolves
Left there to die
Behold I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves
As the brother shall deliver up the brother to death
Beg for a life that is worth not a dime to their kind
Pleading for mercy from those that would leave you behind
Betrayed with a kiss by the blackened soul you will save
Burned at the stake so the jackals can piss on your grave
Here comes the pack
Come to attack
Blood in their eyes
No compromise
Thrown to the wolves
Left there to dieInto darkness thy spirit wanders
Through the moonless sky
Howling wolves arrives
As I await the darkly sun
Torches burning, in a thousand hands
Stream of blood in the frozen snow
Unto the ancient moon I fearing
The darkness of all time
AS I DIE!
Without any fear I hold my sword
Falling from the sky
The rain begins to fall
Then a storm shall arise
Sended up a howling wind
Across the burning sea
Marching with pride an no one fears
Strong and brave so they stand
The storm begins to march
Warriors on their horses
A cry of war emerges
Hear the steel of might
Full of hate and agony
Trough the rain they march
Fighting for the landscape
Fighting for their lifes
A number of ancient warriors march forth from the darkness within
The greatest screamings of anger arrives at the enemies life
From the deepest land of hate
The rain is slowly falling
Gently caress my skin
Another soul to save
Riding on the horses
The enemies awaits the fight
Slaughter of the sons
The fight for our god
As I look on the sky
I hear the ravens cry
On the ground where I look
The blood flows on the stone
Shields and swords here them cry
Arrows flows trough the sky
Death is on the way we march
The warriors ride once more
Believe in faith and yourself
The eyes are burning still
Wolves howling in the night
The fight begins to change
The battle rages on and on
The rain falls from the sky
Take revenge for all the pain
Granded by the GodsOh pirates, yes they rob I
Sold I to the merchant ships
Minutes after they took I
From the bottomless pit
But my aim was made strong
By the hands of the almighty
We fought in this generation
Triumphantly
Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom
'Cause all I ever had
Redemption song
Redemption song
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds
Have no fear for atomic energy
'Cause none of them can stop the time
How long shall we kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look
Some say it's just a part of it
We've got to fulfill the book
Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom
It's all I ever had
Redemption song
Redemption song
Redemption song
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds
Have no fear for atomic energy
'Cause none of them can stop the time
How long must we kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look
Some say it's just a part of it
They've got to fulfill the book
I want to say
Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom
'Cause all I ever had
Redemption song
All I ever had
Redemption song
'Cause all I ever had
Redemption song
These songs of freedom
Redemption song
Redemption song
Redemption song
Redemption song

Redemption song[music: Dennis, Costas lyrics: Jake]
"Sanity and insanity come together-don`t forget
Here we found the way to get it"
Welcome to the Model Death`s High-school
You speak with its General Director
It`s our pleasure to have you here in our favorite Killer Family
Justice means death of body and soul
You will surly learn it here
We`ll make you comprehend it for sure
To practice it perfectly
You`ll see a lot-you will hear a lot more
You have to believe them all-so simply
But it will cost your life if you try to convert`em
To convert`em out there
Your actual thoughts? Just hide`em inside you
Sense of love has no place in here
Everything that`s lovely has to die now
And this is your own duty.
[chorus]
Sanity and insanity come together-don`t forget
Here we found the way to get it
You`ll get it too and you`ll love it!
Don`t hesitate to practice even here
Everything you`ve taught
Just try to make some practice on me
But remember I`ll survive!!!
With these few words I welcome you
I discriminate the terror in your eyes-but you`ve already got in
The doors behind you closed hermetically
Opened when you will become our own perfection:So my descent was a shallow defense I made
To lay waste to the powers of faith.
When all the blame I carried around my neck
Viscous cycle of hate that I changed to find my way!
When the sovereign comes to me
I eclipse in the shadow's veil
Killing all I cease to be
For the passing vein is hate!
[Chorus]
I fall to the fires of Hell, never fail to awaken
Though my soul descends in the darkness of my heart, again
I'm God-Forsaken
I fall to the fires of Hell, never fail to awaken
Though my soul descends in the darkness of my heart, again
I'm God-Forsaken
With every turn I fail to learn my path
and it's wearing down my days
To be the voice of a half-dead suffering age
I never want to read that I ceased to find my way
When the sovereign comes to me
I eclipse in the shadow's veil
Killing all I cease to be
For the passing vein is hate!
[Chorus]
I fall to the fires of Hell, never fail to awaken
Though my soul descends in the darkness of my heart, again
I'm God-Forsaken
I fall to the fires of Hell, never fail to awaken
Though my soul descends in the darkness of my heart, again
I'm God-Forsaken
Now the grave is all I see!
[Chorus]
I fall to the fires of Hell, never fail to awaken
Though my soul descends in the darkness of my heart, again
I'm God-Forsaken
I fall to the fires of Hell, never fail to awaken
Though my soul descends in the darkness of my heart, again
I'm God-ForsakenAltered States of America in water cooler
Warfare with an unseen enemy
Heat flashes on the job, it's back to the water cooler
Drinking more and more at home tripping balls
Behind the wheel of a sixteen car pile upThe long walk home,
back to a no name town.
Where people pass me by
in red and white lines.
Your only son can't make you proud.
The moon and stars, this frozen clock.
And if in years to come we can talk like friends,
can I close my eyes and wake up then?
Drown out the sound of adulthood
with songs that fell from out of space.
At seventeen I wouldn't dare to dream
because hope's a dangerous thing.
I won't thank god, I'll thank my friends,
for sticking by till we're home again.
What matters most to me belongs to you.
Hope's a dangerous thing.[Instrumental]ich habe ein geschenk fr dich
ich liebe dich
ich schenk dir mich
verjag mich nicht
du weist warum
ab heut bin ich dein eigentum
du tust mir weh was will ich mehr
dich bin dein diener du der herr
ab heut gehr ich dir allein
bitte lass mich
bitte bitte lass mich
bitte bitte lass mich
lass mich dein sklave sein
was immer du riskierst ich tu's
ich kss die spitze deines schuh's
und wenn du mir die knute gibst
weis ich das auch du mich liebst

Goblins march in fearless pride
Through destruction they forge virtue
Hell rats are out to get you
Gandalf carries the magic staff
Divides the armies in half
In the deeps of helm's they engage in battle
So insane it'll make you rattle
Thunder roars wind howls
Demons sporting crimson cowls
Hobbits fight in desperation
The bloody war had no inspirationSo many tears have been flowering in my grave
So many flowers have been withering on it
Alone in this jail, I hear the wind caressing my gravestone
Loneliness is timeless and my sufferings endless
Silence. I can't stand it. I hate It.
I feel the vermin swarming through my body
My limbs are decaying like old fruits.
I'm doomed to stay here, my soul is trapped
Who condamns me? Why?
What have I done?
Where is my god?
Anyone is perfect, we all are sinners
Humanity is what it is
Temptation is human lust too
Who has the right to judge us?
Neither a god, nor the humans.[Narrator: Michael Kiske]
[Backing vox: Robert Hunecke- Rizzo]
[Ainae Angel: Nicholas Westerman]
[Narrator:]
Years went by and Angels sighed
Young girls laughed and old men died
Lovers loved and people tried
To live amongst the shadows
Sunlight chased away the waste
But couldn't take away the taste
Of all that, taken in the haste
Of hatred's bite and swallows
[Chorus:]
But love will bloom even in gloom
And serendipity visits soon
Two fated souls bound for doom
Whose time is all but borrowed:
Then the Sun came to the one
Who'd make him come all but undone
If not for her, He might have won
But lost in all that mattered
She cast his soul in liquid gold
But those who know would have it told
She, too, was touched by his soul
And hand in hand they wandered
[Chorus]
[Angelic Ainae Choir:]
Shaena lithou tou risewr

(All that's forbidden
becomes a love song
Syrius about to fall
And Oriana waits)
[Narrator:]
The made love and all was said
Forever they would share a bed
But little did they know that dread
Was creeping up behind them
Days grow long and silence spawns
The eagerness to right all wrongs
And even though the darkness dawns
Brighter days will follow
[Chorus]
[Ainae Angel:]

(Feel the love
Hold fast to the love)Tina and I went shopping the other day
Both bought new dresses, wore them right away
Cut off the tags - no second thoughts
Can't take them back, wouldn't want to of course
Why be sensible - money's dispensable
Don't worry be happy make the most of what's available
Wear your Sunday best on Mondays
Doubt when the weather report says: Save it for a rainy day
We could see each other Saturday
Or get together next week, - but why wait? Use the good china
Tina and I read a poem the other day
We didn't write it but it's so cool that (we'll) I'll quote it anyway:
"You've got to love like you've never been hurt
Act like you don't need money when you go to work"
-Look before crossing - it's advisable
But jumping in with both feet is what I call admirable ...
Wear your Sunday best on Mondays
Doubt when the weather report says: Save it for a rainy day
We could see each other Saturday
Or get together next week, - but why wait? Use the good china
Wear your Sunday best on Mondays
Doubt when the weather report says: Save it for a rainy day
We could see each other Saturday
Or get together next week, - but why wait? Use the good china
I could wait to say "I love you"
Until I'm sure you're gonna say it too
Or I could just say it right now
Why that strange need to postpone
Living in the future is wrong
Use the good china
Use the good china - Use the good chinaFor we're the outstretched fingers
That seize and hold the wind
The strangeness of awakening
In an oh, so silent world
Breathlessly waiting for the first
Proud beams of light
As the hours grow longer
And the shadows never fall
My sky has forsaken me
My desperation grows
Bring me the light
In the fires that never end
The dawn will never come
Punish my heaven
That's right
You will suffer my punishment
We have arrived at the outmost crossroads
The charge of cosmos
At our atmospheric skies will cause our fall
Yeah, our downfall
If I had wings
Would I be forgiving?
If I had horns
Would there be flames to shy my smile?
Unless I'm worthy
Hymns of loss are heard
From the masses in the streets
Praising the last of days
I punish
Bring me the light
In the fires that never end
The dawn will never come
Punish my heaven
The charge of cosmos
Charging us from unearthly distance
I challenge the universe
It's the choice between Heaven and Hell
My soul bears all
The weight of mountains
As mankind weaves its silent end
Can there be no forgiveness?
I curse the heaven above me
As the light sinks
Through my outstretched fingers
Fading in my open arms
Make each tear in my bare hands
A lifetime in hHell
On this last day of light
When our autumn leaves fell
And as Heaven itself, commands me
Out of its lair, I fear not
My face lined for darkness
I'll go, I'll gogave us clemence of birth under pain
draught us out of the mud
as long as your lifeline shivers
don't let me go
deliver me hope
giving meaning to my life
rewarding me day by day
in honest unselfishness
just asking respect and comprehension
for your death
I hear your song but I ignore your cries
To prove myself
I don't even move my eyes
Because others certainly will
Your lament is deafening
The wounds too obvious
Exited I keep on raping you
For my glorification
You try to defend but we just laugh
Finding new ways to mute your desire
Your life our fate
Displayed before my eyes
Feeling lost in our mind
I hide my heart away
Time is gone I want back into the womb
And breed forever on
Await for the awakening
May god bless our souls
You beg for mercy
Earning mockery and scorn
Tears, a neverending stream
Your just desert
Bathed in your tears
Rushed away within
Close my eyes in self abasement
I'm able to ignore your suffering
Your life our fate
Wall of hatred and death enables me
To hide my heart away
I pray for if the time will come
Take me back into your womb
And please, please
Forgive me!Viendo oculto en tÃº disfraz
En mis sueÃ±os siempre estÃ¡s
No lo puedo remediar
Te deseo cada vez mÃ¡s
Al principio todo era paz
Y contigo llegÃ³ la maldad
PrÃ­ncipe de las tinieblas con un fuego arrasador
Has escrito la historia de la humanidad
Haces siempre lo que quieres sin tener piedad
Dios eterno todo lo haces a tÃº voluntad
Maldito, maldito sea tÃº nombre...
Maldito, maldito sea tÃº nombre...
Tan grande es su poder que todo lo consigues
Â¿cuÃ¡l es tÃº gran secreto?
Que nada te prohÃ­be
Haces siempre lo que quieres sin tener piedad
Dios eterno todo lo haces a tÃº voluntad
Maldito, maldito sea tÃº nombre
Maldito, maldito sea tÃº nombre
Maldito, maldito sea tÃº nombre
Maldito, maldito sea tÃº nombreSee the way you take my soul
Laugh at how you steal my pride
Crush the dreams that I once had
I'll take it all in stride
Give up everything I've worked for
Give you everything you want
Leave behind my friends and past
To watch you walk away
I did it all for you
I gave you more than I had to give
I gave it all to you
I keep on giving and you just take
Take what you want from me
And throw the rest away
See you standing proud
About the way you forced me down
Into the ground
Show me how to fear another
Teach me not to trust again
Always look over my shoulder
Live with what you took from me
No more can I close my eyes
I just see you walk away
I can't clear my head of you
I cry another day
I did it all for you
I gave you more than I had to give
I gave it all to you
I keep on giving and you just take
Take what you want from me
And throw the rest away
See you standing proud
About the way you forced me down
Into the ground
Take what you need from me
And leave the rest behind
Take what you want
Take it and leaveYour lungs can't breathe
Atmosphere is full of stench
Day of decay here comes To take humans life
Our love, our feeling
Is give to hell
Black view in the future
People are ruined
Devastation,
Mutilation
People lie on the shit,
Shit is blent the biles
Bloody shambles amid people,
Mental idiots rule over the worldAlone, since I was born
Cold limbs turned against me
Take a part in my misery
Silence causes me pain
Please alleviate my loneliness
Be the one who never betrays me
Is Heaven a goddamn freakshow?
Hell can't be more horrifying
Let the end come and set me free
I smell blood in the air
Death is waiting with open arms
Come to me, fill my body
Let Devil in - Devil's in
Let the Devil fill my damn body
Let Devil in - Devil's in
Yeah, let him come to me
Don't forget: there's no way back
A new star on the sky is shining
Let the end come and set me free
I smell blood in the air
Death is waiting with open arms
Come to me, fill my body[Music & Lyrics: Jarpen]
Take a look at the new rules of this game
Wicked laughters are feeding their fame
Hearing the cries from the empty shells
Unmoved they seem
Hungry for turmoil and wedges
Ivy-clad so that we can't see
One peace at a time they steal
Collecting memories
Notch up another victory
Upon our shoulders and true beliefs
With wheedling words they reign
So sweet is our decay
Raise your voice
Aim as high as they can't see
Now you can say:
"Speak your last word,
speak your last word!"
Born in the garden of overgrown madness
We still search what remains of our lives
Scattered pieces for their jigsaw puzzle
Swapping destinies
Whencesoever they derive their powers
Where all hopes are misled and repressed
Vowing to break from the hardest chains
Tearless they seem
Prophets of doom
Playing god, how does it feel?
The fate of Sky and Earth
Awaits their sentence too
Shattered we are
Sold and bought in the Merchants' fair
Beneath hard flesh it burns
Beware of our hate!
[repeat Bridge and Chorus]
[Acoustic solos: Jarpen]
[Solos: Jarpen, Aydan, both]
[repeat Bridge and Chorus]Within the cave of sleep
lies the horrid ones in the deep
in a city just to be found
within the dreams of unholy ground
So sleep between these sheets of chill
and sleep forever is what you will
like a silent voice from a memory
these waves of slumber are drowning thee
Hear the lake
it is calling thee
to be part of the dreaming city
So do not fear these waves of horrid sleep
as you disappear into the deep
Hear the lake it is calling thee
so follow the cantor to the dreaming cityBehold the truth of our demise.
Out of ruin we ll arise.
We ll rise from darkness,
from burden - to light with joy.
Oh beautiful valiant, take us from night,
from dark the mighty king
- unfolds as light.
Malevolent death toll, oh so sweet sounding.
Demise
We sing in our despair,
for hope, then rot in peace.
Embalmed with rosescented fumes.
As the shades of evening draws
the trees calmly whistles...
unending reprisal of hope, of hope
Farvel nikker blomstene,
mildt hvisker vinden.
Soulbells play in gardens of stone.
Everlasting monuments, petrified by grief.
The remains of loved ones,
now withering into dust and soil.
Again turning the wheel of life,
from dust man arise to dust man
become.Finally, we're back and here to stay

EternallyAfter too many dimensions
arriving to the last one
A road covered with the dying
Shadows masticating them
Walking ahead
Torture spreading on the way
Dismembered human beings
Flying souls fading away
You find no escape
Walking just around and around
Flying shadows slaying and torturing
Will they also rip your soul away...?Alone I wonder in this misty forest
In this my (own) world of darkness
There are no lights that show me the way
The screams from my past surround me
The rain that falls tastes like blood
The blood that falls enchantes my soul
The chickets around me burn like fires
The fires around me enchantes my soul
Fear ain't a part of me, my feelings are no longer mine
Here in this my kingdom
Where the trees are my people
and the rivers my servants
The rain that falls tastes like blood
The blood that falls enchantes my soul
The chickets around me burn like fires
The fires around me enchantes my soul[Instrumental]My head hurts like hell
Can't open my eyes
My clothes are all wet
And I'm freezing right through
Don't know where I am
Or how to get home
My arms feel so numb
And it's hard to get up
My muscles they ache
With every move
I stand on my feet
But my knees feel so weak
Somebody wake me!
From this horrible dream!
Somebody save me!
From this terror I feel!
I stumble around
On the soft muddy ground
I call out the name
Of the friends I can't find
But only the wind
And the ravens reply
With every gasp
With every breath
Smoke fills my lungs
And my intestines wrench
With every gasp
The sweet taste of death
The air is full of a thick
Pungent stench
So comes the rain
It's colder than ice
I wash off my face
And open my eyes
And then I see
But wish I were blind
They are all dead
There's blood everywhere
The Norsemen they left
Only death and despair
A stench of flesh
That fills the autumn air
Somebody wake me!
From this horrible dream!
Somebody save me!
From this terror I feel!
No one can save me!
From this horrible dream!
No one can hear me!
Or my heartrenching
Screams!...And the devil's own hand was knotted by the pastor,
And we dared to admit, her weakness was laughter.
And the scared victim begged for her life.
We watched it end.
"Did you miss me? You're shaking...
And I'm not the one who left you in the cellar all bothered.
It's me, it's not your father.
I'm here to take you away.
Give me your hand, spare your life."
She's breaking out, and they're all laughing now.
Behind your devilish figure, behold the smoking gun.
...And the devil's own hand was knotted by the pastor,
And we dared to admit, her weakness was laughter.
And the scared victim begged for her life.
We watched it end.
These daggers mean nothing in the context you use them in.
And we believe in nothing unless there's proof of it.
You seek out those who forgive.
You seek out those who forgive.
You seek out those who forgive.
You
I met you at the altar and your lips tasted different.
Then placed my ring upon your hand and knew we'd die together.
And now, I'll call you my wife.
Give me your heart.
I'll grow it into size.
You're dancing around yourself
You're dancing around yourself
Dancing around yourself
Dancing around yourself
Dancing around
Dancing around
Dancing around
Dancing around
Around
Around
Around

There was a knife in the drawer....There was blood on the floor and everybody's looking for another way out. I don't want it anymore. Hands all through the window and they're breaking through the frame. It's not what you wanted. It's not what you needed. I'm not what you wanted. Not what you needed. I can't sleep at night. I swear to god I hear your voice outside of the window.To arms
The time to strike is now
Today we take our lives back
Do not fall victim to their lies
We've come too far now
The war we wage
A storm of chaos
Death the only escape
For your crimes against humanity
You will be judged by vengeance
There's two men I trust in this world
One is me the other is not you
Our defenses will not be purged
By your deception
Cast down
By your hand
Your life
Destroyed
Cast down
By your hand
Your life
Destroyed
One by one we will overcome
Every obstacle will fall at our feet
Full Blown Chaos
The war we wage
To crush our enemy
When you die I'll be there
'cause I'll be the one taking your life
You'll known the meaning of suffer
My hate bestowed on you
When you die I'll be there
'cause I'll be the one taking your life
You will known the meaning of suffer
My hate bestowed on you
Taking your life
'cause I'll be
Taking your lifeI've given up
On society
Up on my family
Up on your social decease
I've given up
On the industry
Up on democracy
Done with all your hip-hop crusade
All the decay
I've seen all of the lies
I hate it
I'm wasting here
Can anyone
Wash it all away?
I'm waiting here
For anyone
To wash it all away
Wash it all away
I've given up
On the media
Feeds my hysteria
Sick of living down on my knees
I've given up
On morality
Feeds my brutality
Fuck what you think about me
All the decay
I've seen all of the lies
I hate it
I'm wasting here
Can anyone
Wash it all away?
I'm waiting here
For anyone
To wash it all away
Wash it all away
I won't change for you
And I can't take the pain
There's nothing you can do
And there's nothing you can say
I've given up
On everything
Up on everything
Up on everything
I'm wasting here
Can anyone
Wash it all away?
I'm waiting here
For anyone
To wash it all away
Wash it all away
I'm wasting here
With everyone
Just wash it all away
I'm waiting here
For anyone
To wash it all away
Wash it all away
Wash it all awayI was born in France, called the "Maid of Orleans"
Led by the voices of the Saints
I went to the Court dressed in men's clothes
To save my people from the yoke
I was given troops to destroy the English roots
And to crown the Dauphin at Reims
I'm not a man searching the glory
I'm just the hand chosen to fight
It's a long way to our freedom
I was betrayed. I'm burning at the stake
My own blood sold me in the battlefield
Charles the King made no attemps to save me
I won't be free till the day of my death
The pyre is light. I see the end
I'm not a man searching the glory
I'm just the hand chosen to fight
It's a long way to our freedom
I was betrayed. I'm burning at the stake
I'd rather die than live chained in this cell
I hold to what I have already said
I won't be free till the day of my death
The pyre is light. I see the end
I'm not a man searching the glory
I'm just the hand chosen to fight
It's a long way to our freedom
I was betrayed. I'm burning at the stakeYou put the drops on the paper
You said it would bring us closer to nature
And it did
So we got lost in the desert
Even though it was your best friend's bedroom
By ourselves
We did it all, babe
Yeah, we did it all and then some
I wish everything in life could be this random
We were the last ones
Yeah, we were the last ones standing
Never knew this party could be so demanding
Turn this song up loud
When the party dies down
And everyone's passed out
Play this song right now
If you're feeling yourself
And wanna let it all out
A sunset in a private jet
While having sex could be the best
End to a night
Success leads to happiness
At least that's what you said
But all it did was take your time
'Cause we had it all, babe
Yeah, we had it all and then some
Wish I could freeze time and keep this moment
The last ones
Yeah, we were the last ones standing
Never knew that life would end up being so random
Turn this on up loud
When the party dies down
And everyone's passed out
Play this song right now
If you're feeling yourself
And wanna let it all outNow I have to live with my sins
And beatiful were the times
When I committed them
I might get caught because I have
A fridge too full
Killed too many people
Stuffed with corpses
A fridge too full
Don't you see?
You force me to be a cannibal
Now I have to eat my victims
SO there will be no trace left
[Repeat chorus X2]
A fridge too full
Forced to be a cannibal
A fridge too full
Forced to be a cannibal
You won't allow me
To practice my hobby
My most favourite thing
Killing people, killing people
[Repeat chorus X2]
Why are there
So many cannibals in the world
They all have a fridge too fulllay out the spade in a nation of hate
where the color of skin rules all
now see the hands of the dealer of lies
where the weak are humbled and fall
and my hands are tied
in this world's demise
now borrowed time
and you walk the line
in this world sublime
and you're left behind
but don't pray for me
downcast... in your world to be
downcast... and we all shall see
now breath the air in this world's despair
where the face of hope is lost
now taste the truth in a world of lies
where the mother of justice is gone
and my hands are tied
in this world's demise
now borrowed time
and you walk the line
in this world sublime
and you're left behind
but don't pray for me
downcast... in your world to be
downcast... and we all shall see
freedom is not a whisper
freedom is not a lie
freedom is the price we pay for those who fought and died
downcast... downcast... downcast... downOur peace
Is now in pieces
But what else would
You expect
But we're nothing
Nothing in truth
Here comes
The internal
Winter
Where innocence forgetsMetal and muscle
Smashing you hard right out of the abyss
Torture and torment
If not for the kill we'd never exist
Aggression and anger, hatred and pain
Spreading your poison disease
Black is the magic, past the insane
We are the sons of the Beast
Born to Kill, Born to Kill, Born to Kill
Extreme aggression
Blood in the ears, skulls will shatter to bits
Thought you were ready
But never prepared for torture like this
Hit by the hammer too much for the brain
A sound that we know all too well
Judgment day's here, shaking with fear
Welcome to the depths of hell
Born to Kill, Born to Kill, Born to Kill
The speakers are thunder
The lights are the fire
The stage is the setting for the wars of the wild
Smoke is the screen for the mystery
The Violence & Force will make you bleed
Metal and muscle
Smashing you hard right out of the abyss
Torture and torment
If not for the kill we'd never exist
Aggression and anger, hatred and pain
Spreading your poison disease
Black is the magic, past the insane
We are the sons of the BeastNo sense of self
To balance it off
Preconceived notions of something
Everyones gone
Will I show up
With all that I have to give
Would you consider it a gift
But that
Doesnt matter anyway
Liar youre such a
On your hands and knees
Picking up the broken pieces
Liar youre such a
On your hands and knees
Afraid to turn my head
For fear of whats behind me
Only one resource left
So don't fret on my surprise
Is this all you have
Is that all you know
I swear I've seen you before
But that
Doesnt matter anyway
Liar youre such a
On your hands and knees
Picking up the broken pieces
Liar youre such a
On your hands and knees
Pleasingly
Falling apart
Pleasingly
Oblivious
Youve left with more of the same
I cant win
LiarI've been locked away for all these years
Now I can see the light of day
Things have changed a lot since I was last out here
I guess that's the way things, way things go
Now I'm a freeman again
I don't give a damn what happens in there
Now I'm through, what a life
Because now I'm a freeman
As I look around I couldn't remember my old home
Now there's a tower block in its way
I remember all my friends and my wife
They don't want to know me anymore
They wouldn't listen, they didn't understand
They accused me of crime I didn't commit
It was some other guy, but it wasn't me
They wouldn't give in, they wouldn't believe me
But now I'm a freeman again
I couldn't give a damn what happens in there
Now I'm through, what a life
Because now I'm a freemanUnderstand with reason
Cause their ain't no way of pleasin'
Cause the thing that's in effect
Turns out to be respect
Gotta get up
Gotta get down
Gotta put the fear
In the ground
Also weak in their minds
Also fake, also blind
Lies and lust and hate
In the end it's too late
All the tears that were wept
All the friendships that were swept
Was it worth it was it swell
Only time and death will tell
And we reach the final sum
After all is said and done
Take Your heart in Your hand
And alone You will standReferring to an old book
One thousand words, one lie
Lost in self-adulation
Your self-regarded mind
Narrow minded visions
Spread like poison through the world
Posing as the awaited savior
The last supper prepared

Blood-stained prophecy
A lifeless son's your idol
Your act of grace is death
Centuries of forced conversion
Word of God declined
Your tongues speak about mercy
But your prophecy is pain
Narcissism and divine benediction
Won't save you from ordeal
Blood-stained prophecy
(Blood-stained prophecy)
Blood-stained prophecy

Blood-stained prophecy
(Blood-stained prophecy)
Blood-stained prophecy
(Blood-stained prophecy)No one hears you
No one fears you
You are invisible, nothing, trace of belief
You're going blind, dazzeled by
The beauty of the day
Your footsteps slowly disappear, release your soul
This is a diart, the diart of an addict
It's just a diary, only written words
Help me, get me out of here
Your own mind leads you to this
Just remembering where you are
Beneath the cold and senseless, no trace of belief
Help me, get me out of here
Your throat swells your eyes glow
Deep inside you swallow the blood
Hit the darkness, feel the cold, release your soul
Hel me, get me out of here
This is a diary, the diary of an addict
It's just a diary, only written words.High speeding crash
Full metal contact
Driving for impact
Full throttle attack

[instrumental with samplers]Originally performed by Dr. Know
Thursday morning at 7 A. M.
A young boy found dead in a garbage can
When apprehended the police asked why
"God told me to"was my reply
Voluntary manslaughter
Killing in the heat of passion
By another's command
Killing for God
In my room a dog lies dead
A crucifix pounded through his head
I hung him high to drain his blood
God told me that I should
Voluntary manslaughter
Killing in the heat of passion
By another's command
Killing for God
Pieces of Granma litters the den
God please don't let me kill again
Please don't whisper to me no more
Another will fight the holy war
Voluntary manslaughter
Killing in the heat of passion
By another's command
Killing for God
God told me to
God told me to
God told me to
So it must be rightNow that I'm all alone
Painfully aware
I'm starting to feel the cold
Knowing you're not there
Caught somewhere between my fears and dreams
And all I have are demons here for company
Come and look inside, hope you like what you see
And if you run and hide, you're scared of what is me
Bind my idle hands, they only claw at me
Drown in emptiness, my soul is left to bleed
Throwing a shadow on
Every thought I have
Knowing that something's gone
Echo's in my head
Caught somewhere between my fears and dreams
And all I have are demons here for company
Come and look inside, hope you like what you see
And if you run and hide, you're scared of what is me
Bind my idle hands, they only claw at me
Drown in emptiness, my soul is left to bleedSadistic, killing of your mind
Pathetic, mutants in your brain
Damage, is already done
Failure, of the sacrifice
Confronting with your maker,
paranoid vision a dream
Flesh is dripping cold
Day of mourning
Death is on your back
Watching, the angels die.
Altaer, the virgin's blood.
Drips, on the floor.
Praise your holy maker
Awaiting the hour of your death,
Create your own vision,
What will come after life.
You feel no pain no more
Burn with me till your flesh drips away
Tortured bodies all around
Eternal hate inside your mind
Reborn to eternity, blessing your desire
Epidemic world outside, the change has begun.
Sadistic, killing of your mind.
pathetic, mutants in your brain.
Damage, is already done.
Failure, of the sacrifice.
Confronting with your maker,
paranoid vision a dream
Flesh dripping cold
Day of mourning."When the brave fought
On the land of freedom for the men
Now the bells of hope are ringing
Angels cry again!"
The goddess of wind was mad
Oh no! spreading the fire
Rushing our destiny
From now dividing us all
Visions of steady land
Cheering the sight
Orders to wait until the night
Answer me
What happened to your life?
Answer me
What do you hide?
Oh! the storm made us angry
I don't know! spreading the fear
Old friends like enemies
Be strong! and hide all your tears
Revolting the high command
Don't let it drown
Captain took off before the dawn
Answer me
What happened to your life?
Answer me
What do you hide?
Can't you see?
Salvation without fight
Can't you see it?
That you are blind
Under the sun
In a solitary world
I am running alone
Scars on my face
Weary hands from digging dirt
I was dying all alone
Answer me
What happened to your life?
Answer me
What do you hide?
Can't you see?
Salvation without fight
Can't you see it?
That you are blind
Under the sun
In a solitary world
I am running alone
Scars on my face
Weary hands from digging dirt
I was dying alone
Am I running?
Where am I?
Where has everyone gone this time?
Left my future far behind
I am nothing but sole survivorEyes that meet to say farewell
And linger through the sleepless nights
A trail of days that end in tears
But I can never be there
The rush of hours that never seem to end
What life has dealt you can not comprehend
I am the absentee
I know you're out there searching tonight
I'm right here
Another day and I cannot see through your eyes,
I'm right here
How could I have known what preceded your own thoughts
Wish that I could listen to what only speaks inside
Every raging dissonance
Each jarring note
But I could never be there
How could you think that I would understand
When words just go around what the heart truly wants?
I am the absentee
I know you're out there searching tonight
I'm right here
Another day and I cannot see through your eyes,
I'm right here
I want to tell you,
Of the exploding light
How everything is visible
Moments before the dark
I am never, never there
I know you're out there searching tonight
Another day and I'm not there
Thrust with nails of conflict
Anxiety and pain
Through spells of anger, confusion and defeat
I wish you'd see me here in front of you,
But I am not here
I know you're out there searching tonight
I'm right here
Another day and I cannot see though your eyes
I know your out there,
But I'm right here
Another day and I cannot see though your eyes,
Lead me rightDont stop wishing for a clear sunny day
I know youre brave enough to find your way
Dont cease believing
Just keep on walking through the light
And Ill be waiting for the brand new you
Start to share the colors in your life
And fill your heart with love and kindness now
Start over again,
Start over again with you
Yeeeaaahhh yeah .. huuum..
The skies and storms
Will find a way out of your life
And I know were ready to draw a smile
Start to share the colors in your life
And fill the world with love and kindness now
Start over again,
Start over again
Start over again with you
Start over again with you.Sprung from total emptiness
Inpenetratable and cold
I'm drawn into the gray
And then only darkness
I can hear the rain again
And feel the fragrance of fall
I can remember the summer no more
Seems like it never was
I try to run back where I came from
But I fail
The gate closes in front of me
Now already earlier than yesterday
Raging tempest has reached me
I'm no longer safe
The beauty I saw
It can't hold me now
The more I walk, the more I stray
Long strides in the garden of a withering flower
Trying becomes hard
And hope unnecessary
I'm willing to curse my past, curse my dream
With which my demons now dance with me
The one now taken away
I'm led away
Like blindYou're running at too great a pace
You're hurruing way too fast these days
I wish there was a way that i could turn back time and then set off a new start
I wish that I could make you understand what really always kept us apart
Baby through the walls would stand
There was enough of cracks to let the rain come in
Maybe that's why I never held your hand
Because it all began where it all begins
You know it was a hard thing to do to forget when I always would see you
It's funny how we always seem to end up hurting someone when our day is through
You're speeding too fast for me now
You're leaving you were always lost somehow
It's like we always seemed to bet on different horses
Arriving as the other one would leave
It's as it our fired fed from different sources
I would be up missing you while you'd sleep
Baby...
You know it was...
You know it was...
And I realise I always seemed to hurt much more than youI come from a land
Of systematic erasure of optimism and positiveness
You don't want to encourage me
Slowly corroding your fortified norm
Leaving you bitter, grim and sober
With rigid cramp or silent fear
I strangle what you do hold dear
With rigid cramp or silent fear
Evoking addiction, limp, severe
It's sin again
Like charcoal on flaming nuns
Consistence unknown like early black metal
We're born without armor
Don't you think I'm watching my back ?!
With rigid cramp or silent fear
I strangle what you hold dear
With rigid cramp or silent fear
Evoke addiction; limp; severeClock starts ticking away
Count the minutes you are in it till judgment day
Life spent hard on the run
Never staying. Never paying for what you've done
Lookin' at you outside you want to be clean
But your, Dirty lies like the inside of your, girlie magazines
Wanna know the reason they call me obscene?
You're gonna meet me on your color TV screen
Public enemy #1, Targets on my head better get a gun
Public Enemy #1, In the home of the brave
Public Enemy #1, Targets on your head better get a gun
Public Enemy #1, In the home of the free
Got a Virus to spread
Got you hooked breathing heavy now you see red
An urge getting ready to feed
Now that you live it there's a lesson you must heed
They got a bullseye trained on you and there's nothing that you ever can do
They got a sure shot right in low
And you won no no no no no no know
What it feels like to be like me 'cause you want to be real
But you're staring into the mirror and looking back at a fiend
Wipe out you insides but you're never coming clean
Gonna make the headlines of your color TV screen[Lyrics: M. Schulman]
Blood, grief, destruction
Bullets, agony, terror
Desecration, abomination, despair
Welcomes the warlords of hell
A burning inferno
The sky has turned to red
Infernal armageddon
An era of devastation
A stream of madness
The mighty forces of war
Spread their wings of fear
Sow the flames of fury
Mesmerize the hatebringer
Release the hellfire twilight
The smokescreen unfolds
The reality is scattered
A wasteland of ash
From north to south, from east to west
The kingdom once so proud
Was taken and conquered
The brigade moves on
Screams of anguish are left behind
Mesmerize the hatebringer
Release the hellfire twilight
[Lead: Kjellgren]
Cruel ravishing slaughter
Like a horde of hungry wolves
Through seven days of terror
To endless nights of chaos
A burning inferno
The sky has turned to red
Infernal armageddon
An era of devastation
A stream of madness
The mighty forces of war
Spread their wings of fear
Sow the flames of fury
Mesmerize the hatebringer
Release the hellfire twilight
[Lead: Wiklund]You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof's in the way it hurts
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realize my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only oneImpulsive necroplasma.
Injected in your veins.
Spiritually deceased.
Bringing life to dead and death do life.
Chemical injection, producing immortality.
From this fate, you cannot flee.
Suffocate, filled with hate, pray to die!!!
Suffocate, ripping your soul.
Sience abuse has reached its goal.
Filled with hate, all feelings are gone.
You are trapped within.
You feel no pain, pain is all you feel.
Injection is prepared, for eternity.
It circles in your blood, rigor mortis course
is twisting impulses your life is but is no more.
Die... Rise high above the low.
Deathless... Still you can feel the flow.
Never know which way you'll fade.
Insane cell will always be.
Dominate, ripping your mind.
In the maze of existence...Moving toward the evil song that fate will sadly sing.
How the pride of man has fallen, crowning lust their only king
Heaven screams in anguish and the world cries out in pain.
Unleash the final terror- man begins his now doomed reign.
False prophets spread their cursed rule across the poisoned land,
Why must we always choose to put our fate in reckless hands?
Fingers poised on Armageddon, dare they make the fatal move,
And send this dying planet hurling headlong to the tomb.
Broken leaders mark the twisted path that mankind chose.
Final judgement is upon us, vengeance rains its fearful blows.
So we hurl our prayers toward heaven, surely they will heed the call -
But soulless skies just echo with the screams of mankind s fall.Obscurity hides the plateau
Stars darkened at their place
Nanna's glowing above
Illuminates the silent scenery
Seven they are-Yeziti's Call
Aeon of night-Eager to prevail
From the mountains of dawn they cry
The call of the frantic god
From the womb of mother earth they scream
The wage of creation and sin
Seven they are-Yeziti's Call
Aeon of night-Eager to prevail
"The sleeping lord awakes
Tiamat pulls on her chains
The blind phantom rages
Azag-Thoth Howls
Vibrations at the black ethers edge
As nocturnal fear penetrates the land
Ecstatical celebrations at their zenith
The seven sharpen their claws"
Winds emerge from the east
Deep dark water moves
Even the cold moon eclipses
When they adore the dog-faced-beast
Seven they are-Yeziti's Call
Aeon of night-Eager to prevail
As they admit the infernal tide
The eye on the throne derides
The old gods and their tribes
In chaos Tiamat laughs pride.
Seven they are-Yeziti's Call
Aeon of night-Eager to prevailWe're coming closer to the final phase
You better do what you can
No you won't stand the chance to win the race
You better leave cause I'm the man
I know you think you nearly got it made
I think you live in a daydream
There's no way out
I'm gonna give you a nightmare
You get a lesson that you never forget
Your torn is over [repeat 4 times]
[Think I better keep an eye on you]
[On every move that you make]
['Cause you are motherf**king liar , uuuh]
[Well, everybody knows you're fake]
[And I don't give a shit on what you say]
Think I better keep an eye on you
Cause you're a liar that's what they tell
There's nothing in the world that you can do
I'm gonna take you down to hell
And I don't care just what you do or say
You find yourself in a dead end, there's no way out
Poor pityful bastard, your torn is over
And I'm finished with you
(Poor pityful you, you get a lesson that you never forget)
Your torn is over [repeat 4 times]
[Solo Dirk]
I'm feeling free - you can't stop me
You can't hold me - I'm so restless
So you think you can escape your fate
Tell me sucker it's too late
See I know you gonna make my day
So you think you can save your life, if we all gonna work for you
(but you gonna get it screwed)
Better look at your size, you're nothing more than little poo
It doesn't matter what you do, I know I'm comin' over you
(say, it doesn't matter anyway)
You haven't got a single clue
Your torn is over and I'm finished with you
Your torn is over [repeat 8 times]coming late but here we are
on our forehead the fallen star
so here I am, here I stand
await the moment time will bend
coming back out of the dark
on my forehead I wear the mark
feel the day when it's all gone
now we make the past undone
now we make the past undone
arriving late yet here we run
in our heart a secret sun
here I am, here I stand
and my world will never end
now we make the past undone
come come
now we make the past undone
go go
to the place where we all must go
away away
listen, "remember the day"
you say
all those years get washed away
now we make the past undoneIn the kitchen
With a screaming triple amputee...
Its completion depends solely
On my needs...
Said amputee's stumps
Are my way of saying... "Thank you
Just for being you."
Its fear tastes better than its limbs.
Terror of morality
I draw from the slowly dying damned
Monsters live behind my eyes;
I let them out and people die.
And all the grave worms
That come for their piece of meat?
I give them dead things..
The wretched living are mine alone
Fright mounts with the body count
To which anthropomancy predicts a decline
In all of God's creation,
Can there be a lifestyle that's better than this?
I mark my territory
With their blood and excritement
And adipocere...
I can find my way in the dark;
My fulfilment is habitually necromanic
And anal abusive..
Seen through the eyes of a mortician
They've "caught" me, as they call it;
My teeth and my semen have betrayed me..
Nevermore!
Tests to gauge my rationale,
The likes of which these feeble minds have
Never seen.
Rorschach blotters,
My responses to which inspire fear...
From my lizard side,
The amoral alien speaks;
"These aren't butterflies,
I see a face I'd like to burn."
Obfuscation
Of the authorities with lies,
And my natur
Alability to charm and be me,
Or whoever they want;
I've known all minds by divine right.Creation of ethereal atmosphere by my ritual
Hidden force of the nature is now guest of mine
I... feel... the... ancient... power... in... the... air
Circle on the ground
Seal drawn into it
I stand in the middle
Of the sign
I... feel... the... ancient... power... in... the... air
(In the name of satan)
Open wide the gates of hell
And come forth from the abyss
Open wide the gates
(In the name of satan)
Open wide the gates of hell
To greet me as your brother
And friend of hell
I salute you, my ethereal guest!So I travel on this road of emptiness another day
When I hold these dust cloud dreams an instant 'fore they're blown away
Could it be that all this life's for is suffering?
'Cause the sea is deep and I'm drowning in all the tragedies
All the tragedies
So I bleed maybe once or twice to rid the seeds from my veins
All the seeds that harvest the pain, all the pain of my darkest days
And I've waited long enough for these things to change
And I have no regrets before I'll take the blade
As I lay down for the last time
And leave all emotions behind
Thinking not of the ones I'm leaving
Just the hurt and the pain inside
So the wait is over, letting go tonight
The end of life comes calling, echoing my fall from grace
But I fear what lies ahead as my heart stops beating
The chance of life after death
So the wait is over, letting go tonight
The end of life comes calling, echoing my fall from grace
But I fear what lies ahead as my heart stops beating
The chance of life after death [Incomprehensible]
After death
After deathSelling limbs from a bag was always my forte; I get my stock for perverted clients
This is my store
Thrust my rotting member deep inside her oozing gash, pushing deeply
Pushing deep, as deep as I can, feeling blood squelch against my cock
I like the feel of the worms against my shaft
Fuck my stock, just for fun, just for kicks
I like the feel of the worms wriggling on my cock
Found my victim in the streets, told her body I needed it
Then down in my basement I carved her
Storing her parts in jars for my clients
I drained her blood, so to embalm
Death gets me off
I am sick and I cum bile.Let's meet at midnight on madness alley
Have lots of time our walk will be long
Leave you pan, leave you camera
You'll write everything in sprint
You'll need to take courage
As well as patience
Let's meet at midnight on madness alley
Have wide open eyes write everything in sprint
We'll drink with fear
We'll snake the hand of death
Decadence will be our guide
Smell of terror
Smile of idiots
Echo of gun shot
Let's meet at midnight on madness alley
You gotta have a brave heart look around you:
Hallucinations shame, remose lack of will
Do think we'll be able to return
Smell of terror
Smile of idiots
Echo of gun shot[Storyteller: Sebastian Thomson]

[King Taetius: Damian Wilson]
[Narrator:]
Blessed land, the shining star
In the west she rests in light
Dark skies, hard times kept afar
But in time she'll find her sight
[Angelic Ainae Choir:]
Aindahaj etin shalae infinisme ebrony
[Narrator:]
To the sun she turns her head
Unknown in her home steals fate
And to the King there come the Prophets
But he hears without fear what they state
[Angelic Ainae Choir:]
Aindahaj etin shalae infinisme ebrony
Touay soltn etinae bonitri d'esrony
Shawr ousmi Cessnella adouthe yaemr
Thnaton gliu swrutaena jewri outhe taemr
[translation:]
(Aina, your beauty seems so infinite
and trust in it though you may
don't turn your ears from the Holy Voice
for darkness comes your way)
[The Prophets:]
Demons of wrath creep up behind us
Fingers of steel reach out to bind us
Sorrow and despair can we foresee
In the Oracles
The Holy Voice calls down its warning
Don't turn your back on what he's warning!
Darkness and death will swarm around us
The dark won't relent until it's found us
Horror and despair can we foresee
In the Oracles
The Holy Voice calls down its warning
Don't turn your back on what he's warning!
[King Taetius:]
Look around this land, you fools!
No devilry resides here
Away with thy malignant thoughts
Rejoice in light tat shines here
Look into your hearts, you fools!
What ill could here befall us?
For centuries we've known no war
No weapons shall recall usPerhaps the wind itself from old myth sweped the dust away,
In a sleep of a beauty frigg caused the fear.
Ah worried, worried is Balde's mother,
So worried, that even the death takes a pity on him.
I saw the meadow full of faces,
Faces full of child's smile.
Their eyes lived for the joy
And the death was only dream.
But the grief dimmed my eyes by blood
And the time blew the horrifying day.
And I for this beauty,
Now in recollections mourn only.
Bitter thorn is the joy of other.
Innocence of blind eyes of brother
Starkles in cruel trap of envy,
Which like treacherous rose
Lacerates the white palm,
So as under the veil of sweet smell
Sees the fright of pain
In his eyes.
And the death like swan's neck
Flew toward the end of his life.
Vindictive, but full of tears
Is malice of mother,
Which by death of dearest
Is drowning in agony of grief.
Crowning by bottomless nostalgia,
Helplessly seeks in the eyes of death
The forgiveness, but it was fated her
To be destitute further.
When the envy wakes up the pain
And the innocence is betrothed with baseness,
Then by sorrow mourns even the death
And the life parts with the joy.
I saw the meadow full of faces,
Faces full of child's smile.
Their eyes lived for the joy
And the death was only dream.
But the grief dimmed my eyes by blood
And the time blew the horrifying day.
And I for this beauty,
Now in recollections mourn only.A thousand years of severed heads
Crashes down, you're about to kneel
Warrior cries deadened to silence
The sky turns black, your breath runs out
Beg for mercy - pray fro your life
For the evil mask will wait and say mass
Execute, execute, Executioner
Execute, execute, Executioner
Sacred hymns are heard by the dead
They'll save you from the blow of teh axe
The bells of Hell will call out your name
Long before your time can be saved
Rats and dogs will crawl from beneath
Waiting for death to fall like a stone
Execute, execute, Executioner
Execute, execute, Executioner
(SOLO)
Rotting flesh and scenes of horor
Screams in teh night, death takes its toll
Unleashed by demons urge
To kill and kill - his only will
Executed - one by one
This day - is Devil's play
Execute, execute, Executioner
Execute, execute, Executioner[Instrumental][1.]
All is dead in me, except my will to be
Living blood no longer feeds me
Need no sympathy, for the life of being dead
Of being eternally, I'm no stranger to this afterlife
There's no puzzles, there's no strife
Cause to me I'm real, and the things I feel
Are things you can't even dream
[2.]
Through the night a stalk, like a dead I walk
Have no clue what it is that is driving me
My nocturnal ways, seems to save me
Everything is black and white and grey
Like a vagabond, yet an undead one
Roaming the land 'til I feel that my race is run
Have no misery, of this life alone
No blood in my veins and feel that my heartbeats gone, uh!
[C1.]
If you talk the talk, learn to walk the walk
That's a rule that you live and die by
That's the rule I lived and died
If you talk the talk, learn to walk the walk
That's a rule that you live and die by
That's the rule I lived and died
[3.]
All the things you fear, as the night draws near
That is the world, witch I choose to live
Where the nightmares are made, where the beasts
Under your bed have much lighter shade
In a human shell, this is not my hell, now I feel
I'm growing. By dying, I'm knowing
When was I deceased, when was my release
Eternally thankful am I to death divine
[C2.]
If you talk the talk, learn to walk the walk
That's a rule that you live and die by
That's the rule I lived and died
If you talk the talk, learn to walk the walk
That's a rule that you live and die by
That's the rule I lived and died
[4.]
Dead I walk, dead I walk[lyrics by Birgit Lages]
born from illusions, bread by dreams
No one can follow us.
We were gone before we came, alone, eternal
Dark and damned
don't ever try to understand
No consolation
And when we reach what we came for
It won't be a victory,
it's just the beginning of another end
the mechanism masochism
You have given back hell to me
And I will keep it now and forever
My mechanism masochism
as long as you sit calm and small
You'll never feel the chains
And then we'll create ourselves a god
Without whom we cannot live.
At night like a big black beast
With scars and blood dark floods
there's the beginning of another end
the mechanism masochism
You have given hell back to me
And I will keep it now and forever
My mechanism masochismThere are times to joke
There are times to be serious
Anytime you might see
You can die for nothing
You could fall alone
Anyone would agree with me
But there's thing
Just like anything
That you need your good friends for
They're always ready to keep you steady
Through the hard times you might even flow
All for one
One for all
We could rob a bank
And be strong as a tank
As long as we keep it clean
And we'd be fine come rain or shine
Try to understand what I mean
You might need someone
Like the day needs sun
Even if it's a son of a bitch
Who you can talk to
Who you can laugh with
Or even a fight could make you rich
Get up, get up, get up and go
Get up, get up, get up and let yourself go
All for one .....
One for allOpen wide and tell me your tales.
Of secrecy found within wisdom but no man shall learn.
Leaving your pale dying legs frowning upon fragments of life.
Ages on ages have passed over, some have fallen for you.
Poured from the throat, need I ask to be perverse?
Untouched by heart, hand or sight. This crown if for her.
Awake from sleep... frightening. Awake to life... faithless.
Bathe her in springs of serpents only to rise at will...
You're mine now, woven from hypocrisy.
Touch the sick hope that mankind instills in me.
A beauty meshed within the spider's web.
A momnet of irony, a year of reflection.
You're mine now, the slime of the garden.
A rose withered a voice from the past.Oigo el rumor de la esperanza
acobardado huyo rompiendo hechizos
en la huida se clavan cuchillos en todo mi cuerpo
Todo me acosa
se cruzan en mi camino
una direccion
viaje con pasaporte al infierno
Exorciza mi vida
salvame del embrujo
corro en circulos comiendo odio
mi resginacion apunta al cielo
Mente atormentada
a un paso de la locura
Esta abierta la puerta
del descanso eterno
se que estoy cerca
mas lejano que la distancia
Mente atormentada
a un paso de la locuraAll bonds that God ties
Man is master to tear apart
All crop on God's made land
Man is master to sow and reap
All deaths worms die
Man is master to engineer
And the bliss of freedom glimmers like gold
Empty the cast, melt the mold
The worms of God
We've torn away Your spear God
This is sacrament to show it
It's the bread of liberation
And the wine of celebration
In the gloom of gluttony, lust takes its toll
Its hold is stronger than of the Gods of old
The worms of GodI was born to see two thousand years
Of man's effect upon the planet
Extinction seems to be a plausible risk
Whatever happens well I'm part of all this
My life I've been waiting for this moment
All my life I've been waiting for this moment to come
Taste the salt of my tears
Take the wealth of my years
Singing in the millennium with you
(Resolutions for show)
Old ways don't seem to know
Singing in the millennium with you
Fire burn all our uncertainties
Water wash away impurities
Contradictions and predictions abound
Yes I believe that we can turn it around
My life I've been waiting for this moment
All life I've been waiting for this moment, to come
Taste the salt of my tears
Take the wealth of my years
Singing in the millennium with you
(Resolutions for show)
Old ways don't seem to know
Singing in the millennium with you
My life I've been waiting for this moment
My life I've been waiting for this moment
My life I've been waiting for this moment
All my life I've been waiting for this moment, to come
Taste the salt of my tears
Take the wealth of my years
Singing in the millennium with you
(Resolutions for show)
Old ways don't seem to know
Singing in the millennium with you
Taste the salt of my tears
Take the wealth of my years
Singing in the millennium with you
(Resolutions for show)
Old ways don't seem to know
Singing in the millennium with youWhat I'm gonna be has nothing to do, you see
With anything of you and me
There is no you and me, no you and me
You pushed me to the limit
Tried to take what I've got
Watch me take away what I gave you
You'll see what you have is no
You love your torments
Think you're above all around
Well, how does it feel when I go up
And you are dropping down?
What I'm gonna be has nothing to do, you see
With anything of you and me
There is no you and me
You pushed me passed the limit
You take not nothing that I want, that I gave you
You were just a prop
Push aside your remnants
Downplay you all around
Well, how does it feel when I go up
And you are dropping down, down, down, down, down?
What I'm gonna be has nothing to do, you see
With anything of you and me
There is no you and meYou're the source.
My disbelief in innocence arise.
Feel that ghost seducing me.
Try to reach a hand in that golden circle.
You are no angel. And my heart is more than emptyness.
In the shadow of myself and I sleep under the trees
and no one else is sleeping well.
Burn me tonight. Feeling my lies slip away.
Burn me tonight.
And kill the demons in me.
Facing a saint feeling my life slip away.
Burn me tonight.
Until I'm disapointed.
Burn me tonight and kill the demons in me.
I disbelief in the summer in pearl lake.
I'm the pine float.
And now you're falling apart from me.
You are no angel!!!(Instrumental)Keep hiding
All colors fading
Desiring
They're coming for me
Receiving my inspiration
Receiving
Back in the day, I can recall
That my thist for un-clarity and saint
There was no black stain in the walls of my memories
Now there's a haste pushing me sideways
And leaving me nothing to gain
Taking me back, locking me close in disparity
Where was I meant to be?
I'm feeling lost in a dream
Long for the day I can be myself
When I'm free
When my sun has set
Release myself forever
I have no regrets
To be free
I'm existing again
No, I'm lost endeavors
Nothing to concern
When I'm free
Call a decline
Slowly defines me
Is falling away far behind
Nothing to keep me with the time
The here and now
Where am I meant to be?
I'm feeling lost in a dream
Yearning again only to be myself
When I'm free
When my sun has set
Release myself forever
I have no regrets
To be free
I'm existing again
No, I'm lost endeavors
Nothing to concern
When I'm free
Time's just a concept
And always the first thing to fade
(no more heartache, no deserving)
Hiding in weakness
Nothing we can ever refrain
Years are cruel, they break us
Ruling on decay and despair (no despairing)
Cowardice of perception
Something we can never repair (no repairing)
No one to blame
Way from the render
There's nothing we'll ever explain
So it remains
Where was I meant to be?
I'm feeling lost in a dream
Long for the day I can be myself (free)
When will I be unleashed?
There's nothing I need to be
Yearning again only to be myself
Free
When my sun has set
Release myself forever
I have no regrets to be free
I'm existing again
No, I'm lost endeavors
Nothing to concern
When I'm freeWhen I'm with you,
Something bout you is telling me,
You're not loving me anymore,
And when I'm near you,
And holding you close,
You don't look at me like before,
Just tell me what it is,
I know there's something weighing on your mind,
I can see it in your eyes,
I've got a premonition that I might break down and cry
Though it seemed so right,
I guess I'll have to kiss our love goodnight...
Where's the girl I used to know?
Tell me where did she go?
'cause I can't stop myself from thinking,
Bout the things that I'm missing,
So do you know?
I need to know what happened
To the girl I used to know...
You've no idea how many tears
I've cried since you've been gone,
But now I've found how to get by,
I won't cry those tears no more,
I've heard it all before,
So sorry's not I wanna hear no more,
I though I knew you so well,
Seems lately that you're someone else,
Though it seemed so right,
Now I know I had to say goodbye...
Where's the girl I used to know?
Tell me where did she go?
'cause I can't stop myself from thinking,
Bout the things that I'm missing,
So do you know?
I need to know what happened
To the girl I used to know...
If only you hadn't turned around,
You would still be right here right now,
But then again, what's done is done,
Life still goes on,
Everything happens for a reason...
Where's the girl I used to know?
Tell me where did she go?
'cause I can't stop myself from thinking,
Bout the things that I'm missing,
So do you know?
I need to know what happened
To the girl I used to know...This one, this one so fresh I'm still reading it off the paper man
it's just one of dem' nights you, you know fuck it
if ya'll don't never hear nothing again from me
you know it was said here
right over here
My people screamed for revenge
So Fiend was called upon
Job description was get it on
Protect your mental, heart and your dome
You may die cause' of your tone
Young, black and strong
I was meant and sent
Cause' some of the real was all gone
Since birth til' now I got holes in my T-shirt
From fighting with anybody that wants to see me hurt
Took it needle and blood
Second and first love
Fuck giving a fuck
Blame me not the drugs
I motivates myself
Grab a rocket off my shelf
A extra match and now I'm feeling like myself
Without help I could spot and just kill a decoy
Really end what i destroyed
With a heart of a ghetto boy
You have a souljah that's ready to die
Now in the heart of a ghetto boy
If you ask him to live he'll probably say why (why why why)

Man I ain't got no million dollars
I'm still in the ghetto
Hear me holler
Mr. 5-0 dollar
Trying to break nobody's collar
Wanting to give the baby something to follow
But shit I'm smoking like coffee lids
Trying to deal with what is
Screaming letta nigga live
And don't kick the door in my crib
I was off he even found where I lived
Now is it a crime to be black?
And walk the streets wit' cha' gat?
To protect family knock somebody off the map
Distributing crack to put clothes on they back
I did it, and still do it if that's where I'm at
But see I'm best where I'm at
Up in this sack right into this back wood
Wanting everyday to be that good
Now in the heart of a ghetto boy
You have a souljah that's ready to die
Now in the heart of a ghetto boy
If you ask him to live he'll probably say why (why why why)
With a heart of a ghetto boy

Now in the heart of a ghetto boy
If you ask him to live he'll probably say why (why why why)
Yeah I been facing the depths of hell
For how long?
23 years
And I choose to speak my mind even if its my career
The only fear that i discovered ain't returned and ain't coming
And the faith that I have ain't in no car in no woman
Everyday I'm stumbling to a smarter me
A harder me
Revealing my strength for they try to swallow me
I done read what they didn't want me to read
Learn to need what they didn't want me to need
Shit look I really gotta house full of guns
A couch full of ones
Just in case I don't understand the outcome that life taught
Let me leave you with this thought
Why the lion needed courage and he already had heart....

in every man young man old man
there lies one
in the heart of a ghetto boy[Music & Lyrics: Sammet]
Strong on your feet, you were blinded
Building up a towar on shaking ground
Once in a world full of colors
Back to see just ruins there to be found
And now you're falling, crawling
Diggin in the broken remains
Of what had to be taken for strong
Slowly it's been fading away
Come into the painting on the wall
So the joker smiles
Come into the painting on the wall
No more crying
Illusions let you in from the rain
Follow Mr. Hopkins, get insane
Stories are told - wanna hear him
Talking from the picture to your head
Follow the call of a puppet
Led into a black room painted red
Where life is painless, brainless
You don't think of broken remains
Of what had to be taken for strong
Slowly it's been fading away
[repeat chorus]
[solo: Jens]
Look at the picture
Point at the child there on the floor
Realize that it's a looking glass
[repeat chorus][M&L;: Beretta, Ferraris]
Fingers turning red, cold freezing my breath
Never looking down only straight ahead
Winds are blowing all around
Get a grip or you'll fall down
Holding tight to the rock
And you know you cannot stop
Ghosts are dancing now, right before my eyes
Howling in the wind, messing up my mind
I see I must close my eyes
Climbing as if I was blind
Holding tight to the rock
And I know I can't... stop
Winds are blowing even stronger than before
But I don't feel I'm endangered anymore
[Bridge:]
It is hard to climb but now I know
I can do it if I want
[Chorus:]
Will I ever see the top of the cliff ?
Now the strength is abandoning me I am alone
Cold is passing like a knife right through me
I will climb until I'm there, I will go to the peak
[Bridge]
[Chorus]I'm the shadow within the light I'm the one who possesses your mind I'm the one who has the power In the end your absurd reality which between cries and hopes you desire anxiously to find. Now feel my strength. My heat, my wrath embrace me, open your eyes and look who am I. I'm the force which builds and destroy & cover the mountains with blood I carry the death on my hands. I am an ancient god, creator of an hopeless future and because of me the weak and inferior minds have failed. I make fire rains from the skies that make you feel so scared deep whitin you Now the gods of fire are burning our lives With vast desire touching our hearts No bloody liars will survive the curse Of these gods of fire!!!. Earth will be filled up by contaminated souls and soon the end shall come to a race full of cruelty and dishonour. Now the battle of time and space must go on between thoughts and believes, carrying the winds of wisdom for a future we have to face. I rise my head and see you there you're just as I thought you are always buried in my dreams, end my doubt and rejoice your victory before life. You saw it, I wasn't laying, now you got me in front of you hearing at your stupid entreaties. Oh please pity me, take me to your kingdom riding that nocturnal bird. You fucking martyr, your soul belongs to me, you'll have no more pain to suffer and in the same way of other chosen souls only peace will receive! My tears fall upon your feet, I thank your forgiveness. My soul will now rest in peace and there will be no force in this world witch can stop it. Yes, because I`m the lord of gods, king of all time and universe, yes, I am! The battle has stopped for now, on earth, after chaos will be calm days and mourning rise will vanish in the endless cosmos. In every dream there will be always light,darkness will fade in his own black abyss. Angels will guard the gate which welcomes a new being for forgiveness. Illusions will rise up in the sky, crash with the stars fall into the deep of the oceans and lost in the sand's kingdom those false illusions will rise every time, when a son wants to be another god of fire.Sense destructive deathcore
Float amongst the dying
Strive to create spaces
Deteriorating realm
If only I'd been blessed
If only I'd accepted Christ
Well fuck, I enjoy starving
And I don't cry... I get to rape again
They crawl from severe flesh wounds
Yearning to see rain
I stand up cause I chose this
And I don't mind the pain
If only I'd been blessed
If only I'd accepted Christ
Well fuck, I enjoy starving
And I don't cry... I get to rape again
If I had known this "paradise"
I'd kill myself 10 fucking years before
The glorious flames, the tortured souls
The need to see the fires... of Hell
Hell's fire burn!!!Now haranguing grey skies
With revenge upon life
Gnathic and Sapphic
Needs begged gendercide
Delusions of Grandier denounced the revolt
Of descrying cursed glass, disenchanted in vaults
Encircled by glyphs midst Her sin-sistered cult
With hangman's abandon She plied spiritworlds
To Archangels in bondage
From light to night hurled
Cast down to the earth where torment would unfurl.......
But soon,
Her tarot proved
Hybrid rumours spread like tumours
Would accrue
And blight Her stars
To better bitter truths
Of cold bloodbaths
As bodies rose
In rigid droves
To haunt Her from their
Shallow burials imposed
When wolves exhumed
Their carthen wombs
Where heavy frosts had laboured long
To bare their wounds
To the depths of Her soul they pursued
Wielding their poison they flew
Like a murder of ravens in fugue
And knowing their raptures
Would shatter Her dreams
She clawed blackened books for damnation's reprieve
Baneful cawed canons on amassed enemies
So Hallow's Eve
As She received
Like Bellona to the ball
Those enemies
Fell-sisters heaved
Her torturies
Cross stained flagstones
To Her carriage reined to flee
But She knew She must brave the night through
Though fear crept a deathshead o'er the moon
Like a murder of ravens in Fugue
For each masked, jewelled gaze held dread purpose
Horror froze painted eyes to cold stares
And even Her dance
In the vast mirrors cast
Looked the ill of Her future
If fate feasted there....How can I explain this feeling?
Something's coming over me
Could it be that all the birds
Are singing to me?
Wonderful to know this feeling
Wondering what it could be
Seems to me that all the world
Knows something's coming over me
Hard to conceive
But I do believe
It's what I've been dreaming of
Could it possibly
Be happening to me?
It's gotta be love
Funny, what a lovely feeling
This is turning out to be
I took one look and I have to agree
It's plain to see
That something's coming over me[Lyrics by Frode Glesnes]
[Music by Gerhard Storesund & Frode Glesnes]
Wounded
I hung on a wind-swept gallows
For nights all of nine
Pierced by a spear
Odin
Offered myself to myself
Wisest know not
From whence spring the roots
I plegded to Odin
A hanged mans gift
Saw him hang nine days and nights
Pain did blind his sacrifice
More dead than alive
Carve the runes the dead to speak
Enlight the strong desert the weak
The wyrd of the dead
Suffer
A sacrifice so profound
They gave no bread
They gave no mead
Peered down
I grasped the runes screaming of need
I took them
From that tree I fell
I plegded to Odin
A hanged mans gift
Saw him hang nine days and nights
Pain did blind his sacrifice
More dead than alive
Carve the runes the dead to speak
Enlight the strong desert the weak
The wyrd of the deadSa senit conectos

En tus ojos veo tus dudas tus pesadillas y tu voluntad
A quin pudiste vender tu alma para olvidar
Un pasado oscuro que nunca vuelva
Tus miedos perdidos en la eternidad
Cal es la verdad de un sangriento pasado
Un sueo de gloria y una seal
Nunca sabrs cual es la respuesta
Tan distante y tan fugaz
Cuando ves al fin la luz del sol
Cuando intentes encontrar amor
Te arrodillars y llorars
Tu sangriento pasado volver
Noche tras noche postrado
En tus miedos recordars
Que tu vida hace tiempo acabado
Nunca tendrs otra oportunidad
Cuando vesI could never be them
Though my blood is just as red
And we all grieve our beloved
That end up just as dead
I can feel the anger
At the old atrocities
But I know it's not the same
Knowing it wouldn't have happened to me
And I'm no good with cheap sloganeering
About making dreams come true
The answer is somewhere at the foot of the cross
However hard we've tried to make it untrue
I remember McDuffie and how I had to stay home
Not understanding why because I also thought those cops were wrong
Until later I caught myself laughing at my friends' racist jokes
Me the adult white male, I finally grew upgrowling in this side
it couldn't be so real
to believe that in our small and stacked lives
our left time is running still
mechanichell
for us is set beyond the black white line
infernal grief in heaven
not a switch
caught aside a narrow cold trip
I feel my life became an old set
where I can see the gears dance
I know my life became an old set
wheels dance and we take their step
months are days in this set
we'll never see again mother earth
we are just cogwheels, no hero
the part that grinds reverse
in course of time, we are the rust
beyond the black white line
infernal grief in heaven
don't live twice
the resurrection comes
destroy the life for your time
your timeyou're up in my face, spitting and screaming
your composure is gone, gone away
calling me "fool" the insults abounding
and you're shocked to find my mind hasn't changed
you say God's for the weak, if he exists
to punish man for the wrongs he has done
you're simply a hindrance to those who are seeking
but in the heat of your pride you have overlooked...
his love
how could you be so very wrong?
(can't stop thinking it's true...)
how could you miss it all along?
the sucker...was you
allow for that possibility
like you would expect from me
could the wrong one, could it be you?
is God not what you assume?
you say, "don't stereotype, don't generalize me, I alone represent myself."
but it's o.k. for you to do that to me?
could it be that you don't know me quite that well?
you live double-standard, the law of convenience
such as the right to freedom of speech
name any religion - you'll take the lecture
but you'll pull the plug once Jesus Christ is preached?
"it's o.k. to speak beliefs, as long as I agree
cencorship is wrong - but only if you censor me.
I'm open to the truth, accepting of change
but not if that means repentance because they're really not the same."
you've taken my God and attempted to turn him
into something you know he is not
(place one lie here and another one there
and then you've got a god with whom you can find fault)
but the fact still remains, and the flowers still fade
God is true and forever more
if you would open your heart and honstly seek
he would open your eyes and you would know the truthFollowed our wind to shape the course
Had a blueprint, we are in mid ocean
Hyaline, followed our devotion
We followed traces into freedom
Into the afterglow, we left no stone unturned
Out of this forlorn place to our home
Casted adrift we are not sure if we return
Where are you?
Where have you gone to?
Where are you?
We're heading for skyline's end
Putting down the peril
No flashing light, it's just our will
Not resigned to our fate
No kingdom come, so we still wait
Where are you?
Where have you gone to?
Where are you?
We're heading for skyline's end
All untouched by human hands
We stand on hallowed ground
A beauty in abundance
The paradise we found
Following our destiny
Can't feel what's wrong or right
And while away the precious time
Blinded by our sight
For a moment
For a spell we put the tin lid on
The sky is getting overcast
When all is said and done
For a moment, for a spell
Skyline's end, the last farewell
Where are you?
Where have you gone to?
Where are you?
We're heading for skyline's end
Where are you now?
Where you gone to?
Where are you?
Where are you now?
Skyline's endI am alone Killing my thoughts of outcome Delusional virus of God On the verge of extinction Inwardly caged Empty in silence Offering to the suicide king Leaving the misery of God A storm of swords to end my life (Take me) A storm of swords to end it all (Drown me) Lacersations from the sky to baptize my soul one last time Rising from these seas of boiling blood (My own blood) Torn from this birthed tomb that had no bearing on your choices Still the dove of peace can not justify the bearing of the wounds of Christ The blade of release Uplifting in belief Eyes opening to black Reforming of this afterlife This flame to resurrect Following my own will Holding the blade to chest Escape from this scream of conjuring Inhaling the blaze of forgotten fire Scorching new blood to black Through the center of the rotting sun The sick angel with razors for wings Resurrect me and offer me to suicide again Faceless king engulfs me in freedom A Venus of horror made imperial Lay me back to soak my head in pure blood Bleeding from my wrist...this stream of independence As I raise my vision escapes Feeding this surgery of the lifeless Six - Sacraments of anguish and deceit Six - Shadows of baphomets horns Six - Fatherless bastards of grief Birthright of the damned We praise our soulds descent Bleeding like a cold river into eternal damnation These lacerations entwined (for) an alliance of the blind drink deep of desecration A murderous praise I vomit upon the holy altar Hooks of the embraced hang from the heavens Sucking the endeavors of pain Bleeding life from the lifeless As I soar on the tempests sharp wings Trading layers of flesh during intercourse Orgasm found in asphyxiation while losing life Tubes pumping fluid of evolution into a mutation for the birthing of the jackal Rising from these seas of my own blood As man's outer frame constricts with metal and tissue A scaffold of torture to be raised as an altar These interpretations of the surgical testament Lyin g naked licking these wounds of humiliationSo I told you where I hang out
Ya got some sellin' then
Haller my name out
Remember man me an you
Runnin' up out the cain house

Two of my hommies got killed
From the hollow point tips
Cepts it looks like hell
Three point five million
From those narcotic sells
Gang signs that's maile
Seventy two hours incarcerated
All because my hood floss bloody body's
On the pavement
That playa hater shit
Is what brings that type of drama
What a nigga need to start doin'
Is just kidnappin' your mama
Catch me in the game for 8 years
So watch my nigga catch stripes
In the middle of the night
Seein' fiends smoke pipes
Dub sacks an Coniac
Helps me deal with these phonies
Busters sellin' for G's that I stack
From the back to ponies
I got hommies with L's on they backs
Who fell through the crack
And hidin' shank's under they mattress
Where were you
When will you realize
When cockin' glocks
To pop those cops
Makes a Mil of these blocks
Ride in drop tops
Be foolin' with G-nocks
don't trust those bitches
They choose to squish and let em squeal
Go ahead and trust em
You'll have no money screamin' Biatch!
To tha billi ba-bang
The reflections drummin' like solo
Hold on like En Vogue
Put out that Endo

Seventeen to mix with the bullshit
Lettin' em know at the do' with the full clip
When you bust at me
That nigga slip
They steady runnin'
The gun
To keep the nigga off that lay low
Got niggs on the pay roll
That'll kill when I say so
Three hay-lo's
It gets so fatel
On Warnell talk to no one
Sometimes it gets to the point I
Cock my ho's see what I'm sayin'
So I told you where I hang out
Ya got some sellin' then
Haller my name out
Remember man me an you
Runnin' up out the cain house
Nigga just for you I blow his brains out
I blow his brains out
Ill blow his mutherfuckin' brains out
The lord is smokin'
that's why my life
Has been this livin' hell
For the thug life up on the street
And to the prison cell
Unlawful use is what
They caught me with a Tec-9
An do they got probable cause
They never did take no time
Steady use of prison
Took another brothers man hood
They choose next time
Up under the bench
They say its all good
But I was young
didn't know any better
Although I did comp out the boot-camp
Fly to give a brotha seven
Years of prison teirs
My hommies pourin' beers
I guess this henny
Should be life of what a thug lives
My only hurt
Maybe won't be my last
But here's a tip for these cops
Next time I'm goin' out with a blast
So if you look up in this black man's
Eyes of straight madness
Ready to buck you down
Upon the ground
For all my past teachers
Give your souls up
If your showed up

We Do or Die
And you know we
Straight soldiers
So I told you where I hang out
Ya got some sellin' then

About my hommie flippin'
Swole head and a broke jaw

So rest in peace an close his casket
Theirs plenty more chances
If it takes ten years
I swear ill kill this basterd
To war zone grab that chrome
Plus the clip that matches
Retaliation is a must

These BHN they straight be trippin'
Cuz the hood I come from

From north or south

The niggas you think are your hommies are not your hommies
So when you look behind your back
That motherfucker might be havin' a knife stabbin' you
So you watch that shit
Its real
About that pen nigga
To the niggas on the street an in the pen yeaNow the funeral grounds are at last awash
With the blackness of this frigid autumn night
I've lurked into the graveyard with pick and spade in tow
This night shall birth forth our reckoning
Hell's jaws, now open wide
A stare to pierce six feet of soil
A love beyond this mortal coil
As though you'd never left my side,
I hold your stiffened body so close to me
For years I've lived in a dream
Awake, I felt as dead as my cold and bloodless bride to me
I can barely suppress my elation!
My blood is racing as I strike the lid
A quick pry of the casket reveals her body, paralyzed
So long I've waited for this moment,
To thrust my fingers deep inside!
Now you will (sing) the song of the deceased
The ones whose souls will never rest in peace!
The throes of necromantic lust
Possess my mind
Cries of my precious frozen angel beckon from inside
I feel alive! for once I'm feeling so alive
My skin is crawling,
I'm completed on this resurrection night
(from this night achieved) a morbid truth
Love's bounds post-mortally removed
(chorus)
In rapture my mind is lured by my own knife
To join this frrrragile being who sleeps below
The reflection of a razor reveals the moon, so perfectly
Along my impatient veins its steel does/doth graze
With the kiss of suicide!
I feel no pain as I (am entwined) lay with my love-ly bride
The silk lining now stained with my offering
I embrace the end of my now worthless life[Originally recorded by The Who at Pye Studios, London in October 1966]
Look, he's crawling up my wall
Black and hairy, very small
Now he's up above my head
Hanging by a little thread
Boris the spider
Boris the spider
Now he's dropped on to the floor
Heading for the bedroom door
Maybe he's as scared as me
Where's he gone now, I can't see
Boris the spider
Boris the spider
Creepy, crawly
Creepy, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly
There he is wrapped in a ball
Doesn't seem to move at all
Perhaps he's dead, I'll just make sure
Pick this book up off the floor
Boris the spider
Boris the spider
Creepy, crawly
Creepy, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly
He's come to a sticky end
Don't think he will ever mend
Never more will he crawl 'round
He's embedded in the ground
Boris the spider
Boris the spiderNow if you gaze up to the moon
See she's become as blood and soon
The time is right:
We gotta pave the way
You gather silk to weave the net
Entrap the strongest you can get
A soul that's ready to return again
See the purity shining from his eyes
A newborn angel
To help the chosen ones rise
Blood red prophet in the sky
We're standing under the moon
Come down with fire
See the creature come alive
Standing under the moon
Come down with fire
Down with fire
Down with fire
Good intentions raise a mind
A new messiah to judge the blind
Kill off the fools
Who bar my pure and holy plan
We lead creation by the nose
To bring divinity to those
Who know tonight a golden age begins
Divine is the spirit
Into a terrestrial shell
A savior of human blood
Lead us to somewhere
To heaven or hell
Blood red prophet in the sky...Your orders are given, the time for destruction is now
They'll give you no reason, you'll be the first so be proud
They've tracked you on radar, the fighters will lead to attack
The terror will freeze you, because you know you might not make it back
[Chorus]
Gods of war have gone insane
You've played with fire, you're to blame
Perish in flames
Perish in flames
Take a stand for what is right
Time is now so make the fight
Perish in flames
Perish in flames, die!!!
You've locked onto to target, the missiles stand ready to launch
Your mind bleeds in terror, destination lines up in path
Your final descent, the bird of prey unleashes it's wrath
You've pulled the trigger, the world goes insane so you laugh
The world burns below you, innocent people now die
You're stricken with remorse, though much is your loss you don't cry
You clench up in anger, for war is stupidity
For mankind it's too late, and you are the last to seeWhen through the starry night
the mists of autumn glide
the air is filled with tragedies of olden times
Where with a dreadful tone
a nightbird plays its song
in forest dark at moors they come to life...Riding the withered shadows grey
Below the nightsky blind astray
Hasty led, by the four I'm brought
To the abyss of bewildered thought
A path away from all that's mortal
They guide me through the spherical portal
Riding with the horsemen
Saddleback on black neurosis
"The dust it's silent hooves thread
The marsh of sleep where all is dead
Through Palus Somnii" as spite I'm lead
As spite I followed
One by one
Till corners four
To see all gone
With death I witnessed
Your pleads for grace
With famine
We sat your crops ablaze
Your people died
Your land brought to hunger
With pestilence upon you
As spite I followed
One by one
Till corners four
To see all gone
And finally war
Avoke the lust of my spite
As all I would conquer
The world would see might
As spite I watched
with a faceless grin
Your world led to ruin
As the manifest of sin
With Palus Somnii left behind
I crave the achievements
Spun of the mind
For I possess the four
As I remain spite as the fifth
(Merciless to the core)
"I shall strike down upon you"
As I bring the four
For I know those paths
I rode with my kin
To satisfy this craving
To revel in sinYour words are meaningless, as pain fills the void
Hollow words won't hurt no longer
You will regret every life you've destroyed
Blaming the whole world will never make you stronger
Be prepared for the righteous self
If you blame all your failures on someone else
Without any remorse
Without your remorse
If you don't face the weakness of your own self
You will take the same course
You'll take the same course
Your deeds are reasonless, you adore yourself
Empty deeds impress no longer
You will regret everyone you've envied
Blaming it on life will never make you stronger
Be prepared for the confrontation
If you blame all your failures on someone else
Without any remorse
Without your remorse
If you don't face the weakness of your own self
You will take the same course
You'll take the same course
If you blame all your failures on someone else
You avoid every chance
You've lost your last chance
To learn from yourself
If you blame all your failures on someone else
Without any remorse
Without your remorse
If you don't face the weakness of your own self
You will take the same course
You'll take the same course
We can't blame all our failures on someone else
For our own protection
So much to protect
We can't learn from decisions in our own lives
Without self-reflection
We will never flee from contingency
We will never flee from contingencyPacz! Susznie ci si to naley

Do you believe me? Let me breath. I will never throw that place away.
Never stop hitting the ground, pound your fists into the ground,
Is it better than the beat being torn from your heart?
Try to breath. Near the tick tock making me sweat.
Blood starts to clog my pores. How do you like it?A thousand times you peer into their hearts
A thousand times you abduct their hope
A thousand times you perceive the dark voices
A thousand times you annihilate life

Keeper of the wind[Written by The Undertones]Summoned by the winds on the primeval ocean
Under the waves the earth's creation
Deities of a dead world
The gods formed their pantheon
This place
This Mesoamerica
Seeks desperate divination
What was your obsession with time and sacrifice
Bloodletting
Clouds of black smoke
A burning blood offering
All in attempts to speak to the vision serpents
A Mayan offering to hear the serpent sing
Rise and fall
Who's meant to have it all
Calendars of the ancient
A cascade of catastrophe
The collapse
Both natural and man made
Astronomical prophecy
Scarred by timeLeft alone, left to live in a rotting world
Running, searching Kurnugia
Reich of death never let you in
Torment, you suffer, not only God
And His almighty lies can bring endless life
Chemical torture left to search
For the end in a fading world, deformed but living
No more suffering, no more pain
Never be taking your last breath
You're emerging from the human race
Human race
Welcome to eternal life
Immortality for sale
Resistant to all forms of death
Tormented in the maze of existence
Epidemic reign, epidemic reign
Epidemic reign can control the cells within
Never ending search for the other side
Segregated tissues see the final day
Injecting the dose into your mind
A repulsive change begins
In this war against yourself
Internally your body is more healedAn ocean of stars gleaming like diamonds
How many times have we wondered what lies behind
And how do you wish to make explorations
And travel through space and time
To the crest of forever
Shoot up to life out there what will it be like?
And if we're much faster than light maybe I can see
What the shine of my ego looks like from a distance
And what do they know about me in faraway solar systems?
Oh I dive in zero gravity
A glance at the All
We're riding out, pass by the moon
Bird's eye view on the universe
We're all about breaking the rules
"Freeze!" goes the space police
"You're all about to make a fool of yourself"
Goes the space police
Cause you're about to negate their rules
They're the space police
Your visions caught speeding
By free spirits that you recognize by the look
Spacetrotting dissident freedom police
Contrarians by the book
Freedom and wisdom they guard from outside
Stars and infinity shaking their heads at the force
Into the black hole
Oh what looked like zero gravity
Is just a gelatinous mass
We're riding out, pass by the moon
Bird's eye view on the universe
We're all about breaking the rules
"Freeze!" goes the space police
"You're all about to make a fool of yourself"
Goes the space police
Cause you're about to negate their rules
Watch out for the space police
Space police
Get me back on the straight and narrow
Space police
Law and order at the border to infinity
Space police
Aaaaaah
Aaaaaah
Ahhaaahaaahaaaa Aaaaahaaahaaaahaaaahhaaa
Aaaahaaaa hahahaha aaaah aaaahahaaaaaa
Aaaahaaahaaa aahaaaaaaa
We're riding out, pass by the moon
Bird's eye view on the universe
We're all about breaking the rules
"Freeze!" goes the space police
"You're all about to make a fool of yourself"
Goes the space police
Cause you're about to negate their rules
Watch out for the space police
We're riding out, pass by the moon
Bird's eye view on the universe
We're all about breaking the rules
"FREEZE!!! - SPACE POLICE!!!"
*shoot* *shoot* (...) *shoot* *tilt*Across the desert sands and deep into the briny sea
Take ourselves to the limit
To the threshold of our wildest dreams
Our desire knows no bounds
All the treasure we must have
We want it! We want it!
We stake our rightful claim
Rise to the challenge
For glorious triumph we claim
Men of Fortune
We accept spoils or death
To the ends of the earth
Men of Fortune we are
All the glory we seek will be ours
No limitations, to the danger we scorn
Men of Fortune will always go far
No challenge is too great
No object to hard to obtain
Scour through the oldest ruins for the relics
that would bring eternal wealth
We've always been prepared,
Adventure found at every turn
Boldly moving forward
So our names will live on through history
[Solo: Hagberg]
To the end of the earth
Men of Fortune we are
All the glory we seek will be ours
'Til the end of our days
Men of Fortune we are
[Solo: Hagberg, Clark]
Rise to the challenge
For glorious triumph we claim
Men of Fortune
We accept spoils or death
'Till the end of our days
Men of Fortune we are
All will know of the legends we made
Through the ages our stories will be told
Men of fortune for evermoreHow do you feel, do you feel real good?
Well, I do not believe
Cos you seem to be someone else
Than you pretend to be
Something crept into your mind
Nimble as a snake
It sells you shit for truth
And you'll never recognice
No more .......
Do you wonder all the pain
That is hidden within steel
I'll tell you for nothing
You only fear yourself
No more ................. no more faith
Love or hatred
Pain or pleasure
No escape from your sentimental treasures
Better face the truth
All the money that you spend
For beautycreams and masks
Will never ever hide the scars
That lies left on your face
No more .................. no more faith
No more .................. no more faithAt last, I can feel it, the burning sky over me.
Am I falling or rising from this garden of suffering?
This endless agony will be always present
In this strange dance with my destiny.
The vast eternity touches my soul,
As the light that haunt me fades away...
Tears of blood feeding my hate
To that place of pain, that once was my fate.
For my Desire I cry... your Desire...
I cry for my Desire...
Thorns of trust in these moments of hidden pain,
Thoughtless sadness, yet so vain...
This yearning and painful farewell,
Will be endlessly heartfelt.
I cry for my Desire...
Ancient desires arrested in flesh,
Now and forever left behind,
I cry for my Desire...
Will be tirelessly and always remembered
To the last of the pleasures given.
I cry for my Desire... I cry...
My soul will be always grateful to the wordly pain and love.
But soon as I fall asleep, alone in this sinful sky,
I wish I went so far as my wings can fly...
I die... I cry...
So bring next to me, that Crow of immortality...I feel so lost for me inside,
lost am I, will it never end,
but never am I stained black
Now the end is drawing near,
my hate is growing, can't you hear,
it burns me with my cruelty
(And I'm off)
Like the fire of pain in the daylight
Full of hate, your hatred gets up doom
[Chorus]
Hate, I can't control it anymore,
you'll see the red light more and more
Trapping you in destroying despite
by the red light in my eyes
So, better wake up, drink your blood,
follow me and be a god
Can't you fucking look into my eyes,
watch this god arise, yeah
(Come on!)
I feel the last one in this time,
lost am I, will it never end
but never am I stained black, jet black
Now walk away and flee into Hell,
Turn away and meet my eyes.
Under my, blood-red scythe!
I can feel your hate of death,
I'm running on this darkened little path
Take your time, beat me down, sometime, to die (die!)
[Chorus]
Doesn't matter what is on the top, right, way too down below,
that's how the werewolf burns in me
Oh God, I see the light again,
I'm gonna be getting someone in my grave
[Chorus]Your life is aimless and insane there's something wrong inside your brain
And day by day it's still the same there ain't no drug to kill your pain
Every hour you sink more in the mire you deplore
There's no excuse to justify the wasting pain that blinds you eyes
You're the sick among the pure and you're looking for the cure
You're too stupid to realize your life is just a compromise
You're so filled with the disease and you're bowed on your knees
No one care of what you say that's the price you gotta pay
So find a way out Tell me a lie
Do anything that could loosen your strain
Another chance Another drug Another pill to relieve this damn pain
Your pain
No one will assuage your pain
And all your efforts are vain
An endless day of lite routine tied to the wheel of its machine
With a bar-code on your skin you can't forget all that you've been
Self-deception is your dope 'cause you know there is no hope
Fight against conformity lose your own identity
You go back to the cage draw a new line
Live your mistakes over and over again
Anothe chance Anoter drug Another pill to relieve this damn pain
Your pain
No one will assuage your pain
And all your efforts are vain
How deep is your sorrow? How deep is your pain?
Your pain
No one will assuage your pain
And all your efforts are vainThe art of losing is not hard to learn
To lose, forget, and leave behind
Forget one moment, never to return
Surreptitiously declined.
The first cut is the deepest, so they say,
The anger of an anxious mind
Once acquainted with this constant loss
It leaves you without clues behind
I lost the reason, lost the thought,
lost the sense it almost got
forgot the reason why to yearn;
accepting to unlearn.
Down, down we glide
Downgrade our inner pride
Down, down the spiral
To our denial...He's had enough
He couldn't take anymore
He found a place in his mind
And slammed the door
No matter how they tried
They couldn't understand
They washed and dressed him
Fed him by hand
Yeah! I've left the world behind
I'm safe here in my mind
I'm free to speak with my own kind
This is my life, this is my life
I'll decide not you
Withdrawn he sat there
Staring into space
No sign of life
Would flicker on his face
Until one day he smiled
It seemed as though with pride
The wind kissed him goodbye
And then he died
Yeah! I've left the world behind
I'm safe here in my mind
I'm free to speak with my own kind
This is my life, this is my life
I'll decide not you
Keep the world with all its sin
It's not fit for livin' in
Yeah! I will start again
It can take forever, and ever
Whatever, whenever, but I'll still win
How many like him
Are they still
Who to us all
Seem to have lost the will
They lie in thousands
Lank and lost
Is knowledge worth this bitter cost
Beyond the realms of deathA heavy rain is pouring down
Upon the mourners gathered at your grave
Heads bowed in deadly silence
As the priest recites your eulogy
Pounding nails into the lid of your coffin...
Pound
Casket slowly lowered into the ground
Another body consigned to the grave
Interned in your final resting place
Launched into eternity
Pounding nails into the lid of your coffin...
Pound
A bright light leads you to heaven
Your soul cursed to eternal damnation
Your spirit set free now wanders
Your body buried rots in the groundSomewhere down the line
Man created god in his image
Inadequacy on a pedestal
A basin for a lake of tears to drown in
And here we go again
Where there's blood there's hirudineans
Crawling from every hole, blotting blindly
A brainless mob on the prowl
Sycophants cough their amen
Follow the light at the end of auricle
Egos inflate as the bugs migrate
Every blurp a revelation, an oracle
Fall, fall, fall, like flies from the heavens
The leeches slide from their slippy throne
Suck, suck, suck, till we drown in their muck
Still quetching away, splitting heads with their drone
I will not waste my time
I will not waste my anger
Trying to find the head on a worm
With a rectum on either end
A lie in a frame is still profanity
A ghoul with a crown can never be king
Even crap will succumb to vanity
Its own stench the measure of all things
Fall, fall, fall, like drunks from a tight rope
Nothing but a skidmark in history
Suck, suck, suck, empty heads run amok
Choking on self-digesting misery
Eyes will open
Only when the ass starts burning
Atrophied tentacles start groping
Always loping, never learning
Deeper and deeper
Into the swamp you sing with every word
To rot on its bottom
Until the stink heralds the next outpour of turds
Fall, fall, fall, like flies from the heavens
The leeches slide from their slippy throne
Suck, suck, suck, till we drown in their muck
Still quetching away, splitting heads with their drone
Fall, fall, fall, like drunks from a tight rope
Nothing but a skidmark in history
Suck, suck, suck, empty heads run amok
Choking on self-digesting miseryI am the one that has chosen to lead,
The power that grows within me
A force that has come to inherit the earth
My calling
A time and a place for sadistic intent,
I know for when you will bleed
Saving your life is beyond your control,
Wait for my eternal greed
Shortage of time, you are next,
Prepare to die
Power grows in my, look to my supremacy
Force fed in line, death-row,
Prepare to die
Cold-blooded murderer,
Strengthened by the massacre
Destroying the lives of the ones I forsake,
Scour the earth as I take
Searching to quench, thirst of my soul,
It hungers
Cauldrons of blood filing up in the rim,
Enemies die by my hand
Feeding is done, nothing left but the bones,
Left to rot and turn to sand
Building up the walls of the kingdom
Building up the walls of the king
Stronger I grow as I suck out your life,
Pleading as I watch you kneel
Abduction of strength,
I am now in command, I rule
Cities of flesh lay in my path,
Watch as the innocent die
My nation is built from
The souls of the dead,
Born of life to terrifyWe are primordial sound
Outward and in, omnidirectional
We are existence
Salvage the mother sun
Destroy the rift
Bring knowledge back to light
Our vision's detrimental to progressing
Now rise
Balance seeks its place
Moving backward towards the centre sun
Rooted in intuition
We are the language
Sink in the ebb and flow
Sink in the ebb and flow
(Ebb and flow) sink in
(Ebb and flow) sink in
(Ebb and flow) sink in
(Ebb and flow) sink in
(Ebb and flow) sink in
(Ebb and flow) sink in
(Ebb and flow) sink in
(Ebb and flow) sink in
(Ebb and flow) sink inI am my own god
Master, slave
And I will be beyond the grave
I carry my own will and make my day
You're gonna die your own death
There's no one above that's gonna take your breath
?In whirlwinds of tempestuous fires
a phantasm rose upon heavens
....a fearful Eidolon
Lucifer was his name in Eternity
the Father of Pestilence
Monarch of the Sulphurous Empire
Arch Enemy of Heavens
Wanton enormity
from the flames of eternal fury
delighting in blood
armed with destruction & plagues
The Black Angel stood at the centre of all infinity
with ambitious aim against the Monarchy of GodTrÃ¤nen interessieren mich nicht
Deine Schreie vergluhen I'm Licht
Deine Schmerzen hat der Himmel

Gefuhle haben die Wahrheit erstickt
Trauer - Freude - Hass und Liebe - Leben
- Sterben - Lachen und Weinen
Take my hand - Take my mind
Take my time - Don't take my life
Look at you - Look at me
Look around - What you see
Lugen schneiden sich in mein Fleisch
Doch das war dir schon immer gleich
Deine wÃ¤rme lÃ¤sst mein Herz gefrieren
Doch das wirst do ignorieren

Take my hand - Take my mind
Take my time - Don't take my life
Look at you - Look at me
Look around -What you seeDon't want to wait 'til tomorrow
Why put it off another day?
One by one, little problems
Build up, and stand in our way. Oh
One step ahead, one step behind it
Now ya gotta run to get even
Make future plans I'll dream about yesterday, hey!
Come on turn, turn this thing around
(Right now) Hey! It's your tomorrow
(Right now) Come on, it's everything
(Right now) Catch your magic moment
Do it right here and now
It means everything
Miss a beat, you lose a rhythm
An nothin' falls into place. No!
Only missed by a fraction
Slipped a little off your pace. Oh!
The more things you get, the more you want
Just trade in one for another
Workin' so hard to make it easy
Whoa, got to turn. Come on, turn this thing around
(Right now) Hey, it's your tomorrow
(Right now) Come on, it's everything
(Right now) catch that magic moment
Do it right here and now
It means everything
Said a lie to me
Right now
What are ya waitin' for? Oh! Yeah!
Right now
(Right now) Hey! It's your tomorrow
(Right now) Come on, it's everything
(Right now) Catch that magic moment
And do it right, right now (Right now)
Oh, right now!
It's what's happening
Right here and now
Right now, it's right now
Oh!
Tell me, what are ya waitin' for?
Turn this thing aroundYou've given up on us
You've taken all I've made and all I've become
You've given up on us
Just another empty promise by those I love
Pushing me down flat on the ground trying to escape the pain
I needed you to meet me half way
But I'm left abandoned with nothing more to say
I thought family was forever
I thought family stuck together
What's done is done
I'm too far gone
I've never felt so alone
Accept what you've done and rise to the challenge
(Rise to the challenge)
Stop pointing the blame
There's no on left to betray
You're full of broken promises
These days are dark,
Filled with heavy clouds pouring on me
I'll keep giving while you keep taking
As my trust in you is breaking
I see now my sacrifice got left by the wayside
You've given up on us
You've taken all I've made and all I've become
You've given up on us
Just another empty promise by those I loveNecromantical screams
Only you are deaf
Is there life beyond death?
You entreated death, the answer will come
Debris of faith, even you are false
Immortal morals, catch up with time
Vault of darkness, filled with hate
Deny life, addiction to death
Procession of damnation, expulsion of light
Hazardous ways into the rush
Soul is frozen and flesh is weak
Necromantical screams
Only you are deaf
Intelligence is mute
Respect and thoughts, buried long ago
Pleading for the end, blind and dumb
We won't feel, there could be more
I will remain alone in the dark
Deny life, addiction to death
Procession of damnation, expulsion of light
Hazardous ways into the rush
Soul is frozen and flesh is weakThe weight of the world
Upon me, what do I seek?
The horror of what has become
The touch of your hand
She was a precious lie
I always dreamed of
Took lust into love
The power behind your eyes
Makes me believe
My faith in you
Can do no wrong
I would crash the gates of hell
Is this where I belong?The incoherent system of life
Structured in my self dark ideology
"But why am I sombre with pride?"
It may be a prelude to a symphony
Through this prelude Carnal Confinement
Anguish was my closer friend
Once into the world of breathingless
I'll be glad to meet my end
My flesh, I overwhelm
As I rise in ecstasy
Proceed into the realm
Of blissful immortality
Winds of pureness I inhale
How can they love this life so miserable?
I neglect my being
How can they trust this God so feeble?
The inner belief now I deny
I structured in myself my proper entity
Inner-prelude increases my will to fly
Sounds of Blackness, my energy
Through this prelude Carnal Confinement
Anguish was my closer friend
Once into the world of breathingless
I'll be glad to meet my endThee I Invoke, Spirit of The Overcoming
With Drugs of MASHU, My Shaman Magick
Self-inflicted, be Thou The Sword behind me
As I go Afar, to The Age of Dust
...Remember... ...Remember...
Thee I Invoke, Spirit of The Sunset
In The Name of The Most Mighty Hosts, I stand firm
Necromantic Art, Dwellers of CUTHA
I Desire to Speak Thee, to Travel Black Earth
From The Unknown God, protect me
From The Unknown Daemon, protect me
From the unknown enemy, protect me
As I go Afar, to A Baneful World
Thee I Invoke, Mistress of The Rising Star
For We Shalt Fornicate, Debauchery of Sodom
Drink of My Seed, be Thou The Eyes behind me
Stand at my side, at The Gate of No Return
...Remember... ...Remember...
Thee I Invoke, Thee I Shalt Serve
An Ancient Pact, Borne of Sumer
The Spear behind me, The Armor behind me
As I go Afar, to The Age of Dust
From The Unknown God, protect me
From The Unknown Daemon, protect me
From the unknown enemy, protect me
As I go Afar, to A Baneful World
And when The Spirit of The One Called Appears
May The Dead Rise and smell The Incense
UTUK XUL Ta Ardata Barra Uug
KUTULU Ta Attalakla!!!On the way to sacred shores
And in the arms of the life that we adore
Moonlight shows a white design
That's been waiting for a chance to seize a soul once more
Sweet lad, o come and join me, do!
Such pretty games I will play with you
On a road
Changing course
Lightning strikes where we depart
An eerie voice as the night embrace the heart
Resonating from the life that is moving on
To new windows of the soul
Will you, sweet lad, come along with me?
My daughters shall care for you tenderly
Hear his mystic voice
I love you, your comeliness charms me, my boy!
And if you're not willing, my force I'll employ
He feeds on stainless souls
We are stuck in the night
Ancient power will strike
Feel the fire
Now run into his arms
Leave your shelter behind
We are going to fly
Higher than high
We will take on the sky
Feel my senses
United by the night
Now it's time to close the door
And open up like before
New windows of the soul
The silence of the void
A father's life destroyed
Stuck in the night
Ancient power will strike
Feel the fire
Burn inside
Run into my arms
Leave your shelter behind
We're going to fly
See us fly
And hear our cry
We're out of sight
Higher than high we will
Take on the sky
Feel my senses
Out of my sight
But live on in my mind
New windows of our soulAn overactive mind where a thousand thoughts come floating by
Will not be able to slow down at time
Don't be afraid, live in the now, enjoy simplicity
Avoid incentives that will make you blind
Don't let it bur you down
Live in the heart
Experience the now
To really know yourself, ignore your mind and find yourself again
Life is always challenging
To really find yourself, you can't be blind to signals you obtain and gain
Thoughts are slowly changing here
Here in the now if you identify with your own heart
Will change your views and make you feel at home
You're not your thoughts, observe how the can be duplicity
Don't follow those that make you drift away
Don't let them pull you down
Live in the heart
Experience the now
To really know yourself, ignore your mind and find yourself again
Life is always challenging
To really find yourself, ignore your mind and find yourself again
Life is always challenging
To really find yourself, you can't be blind to signals you obtain and gain
Thoughts are slowly changing
Reward yourself
To really know yourself, ignore your mind and find yourself again
Life is always challenging
To really find yourself, you can't be blind to signals you obtain and gain
Thoughts are slowly chaging
To really know yourself, ignore your mind and find yourself
Life is always challenging
To really know yourself, you can't be blind to signs you gain
Thoughts are always ranging nowI don't wanna stand beside you
I don't wanna try and feel the pain you're going through
'Til the death you've seen is through
Cold sweats, hallucinations
I wanna scream to show
The hell I'm going through
The addiction's taking you
Can you see me through bloodshot eyes (bloodshot eyes)
Should I fight for what is right or let it die?
Now I'm choking on force fed lies
Do I fight or let it die?
I will fight, one more fight
Don't break down in front of me
I will fight, one more fight
I am not the enemy
I will try one last time
Are you listening to me?
I will fight, the last fight
I am not your enemy
Everyone is sick of caring
No silver lining on the cloud that covers you
Let it pour and soak you through
No hope, just desperation
So sit and wait for death
And pray it takes you soon
The addiction's taking you
Can you see me through bloodshot eyes (bloodshot eyes)
Should I fight for what is right or let it die?
Now I'm choking on force fed lies
Do I fight or let it die?
I will fight, one more fight
Don't break down in front of me
I will fight, one more fight
I am not the enemy
I will try one last time
Are you listening to me?
I will fight, the last fight
I am not your enemy
Can you see me through bloodshot eyes (through bloodshot eyes)
Should I fight another night or let it die?
Now I'm choking on every lie
Do I fight or let it die?
I will fight, one more fight
Don't break down in front of me
I will fight, one more fight
I am not the enemy.
I will try one last time
Are you listening to me?
I will fight, the last fight
I am not your enemy
I am not your, not your enemy!
I am not your enemy
I am not your enemySearching for their after-life

Ad finem temporumI sit by the fires gleam all by myself
Four empty chairs & one've been kept warm
I drink to my kinsmen who sails now with Njord
I drink to my kin who'll drink here no more
Odin owns ye all
I sing to them songs I wish their best on their way
I'm sure a valkyrie found them in the battle that day
I drink to my kinsmen who fought bravely at sea
I drink to my kin who'll be missed not just by me
Odin owns ye all
To arms To arms - The kinsmen said
They've chosen to meet us in battle today
Fight Fight - The kinsmen said
If we show true norse courage they'll soon run away
Wrong Wrong - The kinsmen thought
You cowards are fourty men may you rot in Hel
Rise Rise - The valkyries said
Odin decided this day you would die
I drink to my kinsmen
Who sails now with Njord
I drink to my kin
Who'll drink here no more
Who fought bravely at sea
I drink to my kinsmen
I drink to my kin
Who'll be missed not just by me
Odin owns ye allTake my eyes.
And you will see what pulled me from my ignorance.
Sight. See this. See us. See us. See us.
I can only feel this around you and no one else.
I have searched for a sympathy.
I have searched for a brace to lean on.
And now you're my only brace, and yet I stand so tall.
You would pick me up if I'd fall, you would carry me.
Our great ascension.
We're one in the same.
On that mountain and on that beach.
We watched the sun rise, we watched our lives.
Come so far. Together.
And now your my only brace and yet I stand so tall.
You would pick me up if I'd fall, you would fall with me.
Our great ascension.
We're one in the same.
The love that you return to me (this is for my friends)
It's more vital than the blood pumping through my heart.Rage has ruled me for so long that I don't want to think anymore.
I've tried to claw my way out, but I am sealed
in. It seems the game is designed to make me lose.
It's weight slowly drags me down. I draw a breath as I slip under. The dim
light fades as descent begins. I have to fight my way through.
Stark flesh sinks through the freezing liquid darkness. Pale
hands bound before me, rushing deeper with every heartbeat.
I will not relent to despair. As depression contricts it's coils
close in around me. Depression contricts.
My will is the blade that cuts the coils from around me.Silence all over
The island lies asleep
The balance of your life
The beauty of the deep
this sapphire blue
This entrancing rendezvous
The art of seduction will take you away
What has happened before
Was it all that you longing for more
An illusive devious path led astray
sleepwalker don't fear the moon
Daydreamer don't wait till noon
The essence of life takes you further
Than you might have known
[chorus]
Rise high
A red ball in a blue sky
A blazing scent will come by
The fortune smiles on you
Sun beams
The vantage point of your dreams
The salient spirits of youth
Through the kissing gate of your soul
Let all those blue skies in
the hyaline sea
Is waking a bale-fire in me
As plain as a pike-staff becoming aware
By the tag-end of doubt
Knowing no one can live without
We're wielding the sceptre of life so prepare
rockbound your heart cannot feel
Pounding the stones and reveal
The canyons and deserts
The indented coastlines at heart
[chorus]
silence all over
The island lies asleep
The balance of your life
The beauty of the deep
there your inward journey goes
The spellbound of the sunrise dawn
Moves you from your faint-hearted sky
So come to ally
In key with lucent ocean waves
Here by the wishes of our dreams
Turn the blueprint to a quaint reality
And the jewel nature waits
In amenity of boundless cunning skies
Believe your aphelions are near

(Instrumental)Paintings of raging colors caressed by words of golden dust
To hide the darkest past under winter's veil
Gemalde tobender Farben unter dem Schleier des Winters[Music: Ivar Peersen - Lyrics: Ivar Peersen, Per Arild Husebr]
The Juggler stares
To quench the thirst
Upon the brow
Within the hand
It cracks and seeps
The seer weeps
In flickering light
The wounds are served
Screams from below
A shadow in chains
Feverish images told
In mirrors of old
The eyes they all share
In this tragic court
An empty seat
The river runs dry
Nothing said
Words in redTake a walk along
The highway to your mind
Take a chance
On all the things
You never thought youd find
Take advantage of your universe
Erase the damage
Of a journey
Gone from bad to worse
All the anger
All the pain
Just when you thought
Itd never be the same
Look out there
The city of darkness
Is waiting to set you free
Your wildest moment
Out of nowhere
Something youll never believe
Same old fears
Got you paralyzed
Same old tears
That you could have shed
In years gone by
Same old hesitations
You can rise above
We got every nation
Wondering what weve got in store
All the danger
In the game
And youre anxious every move
And thats a shame
Look out there
The city of darkness
Is waiting to set you free
Your wildest moment
Out of nowhere
Something youll never believe
All the anger
All the pain
Just when you thought
Itd never be the same
Look out there
Its waiting to set you free
Your wildest moment
Out of nowhere
Look out there
The city of darkness
Is waiting to set you free
Your wildest moment
Out of nowhere
Something youll never believeBuilt to destroy
Born to compress
Every worry
Every idea
Push it deep down
The blood vessel cover
The skin suit of anxiety
Never speak a word
Just do as you're told and compete
Compete for success, for health, for sport.
Climb the mountain of limbs
Build the walls around me
A covered land mine
Every smile, every itch
A covered land mine
Push it deep down
Put your head under the ground
Worm discussion
Built to destroy
Born to dominate
As I am you
You will never know
Just like all the fools before you
Here is what we must do
She writes:
I awake to a cold touch. Two arms in four-armed bed. The touch of wind wrapping around me. I'm trying to follow its scent. The scent of isolation. Every door opened, every aspect of our life... gone. Hauling around our memories. Every corner a display of our life. A life I assume will never be the same again. No signs, no clues. A game that I will question until the end. Where have you gone? Was I ever important? The late nights lend ideas, but nothing to gather actual progress.
Years go by. The constant stare. The constant grip inside. Every organ grinding.
Every day seems easier until I step back in our box. Boxed in.
Surrounded by life, while suffocating inside a poor version of one.
Grip the match, set the fire. Don't save a thing.
Rebirth. Reborn. Now this is progress. The black box will reveal only this. I will sit.
Sit and wait until not a breath escapes my body. Burning in our box.
What did all of this even mean? More objects to represent a status.
One we can't even prove. Hide behind what we have taken.
You have done this. The memory of me will leave with the ash of lost treasures.
Goodbye to you. Goodbye to everything.
She speaks:
Was I ever really alive?
Did I stay in his mind?
Goodbye to all I've known
I love you
Rebirth
Reborn
Do as we are built
Machines for the future
Bright eyed and ready for life
The dual gods of our time
Of all time
They will never see us coming
Let's end it all
Start from scratch
Patch the uniform and let the galaxy form a comfortable replacement
We will not be missed
Goodbye to everything
Doing as one's told
A puppet through fear
The crossed finger clicking sounds
Inner anxiety with a smile
(Will he even know this? Will she notice?
I haven't even begun telling her the truth, or telling you about her for that matter.)
Why can't we step back?
Are we really this important?
Just because we can doesn't mean we should
(Let things happen naturally)
Personal resets through selfish release
At least I will enjoy
The worry slips under the door
(I will never see him or I again)
You won't see me comingIs there anyone in this city?
Anyone who isn't asleep?
I'm feeling lost counting steps between street lights.
Still drawing triangles on my wrists.
Hanging out in grocery stores without a home.
Not anymore.
I'm all alone. I'm all alone again. I'm all alone.
Chasing my memory. Everyone's moving but me.In one eye and out the other.
The heiress turned historian, reach-out!
How did she handle herself
Position herself while writing this?
Book-signing autobiography.
Prize-winning best-seller.
Tie her hands to your heart.
She bore no breath.
She bore no cavity.
Relinquish the pageantry, little girl all grown up.
All is said and done.
Verity was supposed to be 'the dirt.'
All is fair in love and lies.
Little girl, growing gray, silent, and blind.I'm just a human being A mistake made of feelings With a soul...wrapping in chains So fragile, full of pain No one knows why we are here Giving laughter and so many tears I will just do my best To keep my head above the rest
No one really knows Which way the wind blows
One day the tides will turn One day the fields will burn One day the seas will churn The fury of out maker's hand
Man is a mistake cast out Shunned and cast down Giving life through breathe of gods W With itself always at odds The pious the preacher The liar, the creature F rom rock to fire The dust of man
O my maker I need a savior
One day the tides will turn O ne day the fields will burn One day the seas will churn T he fury of our makers hand
The fury. The fury What will you do?There's an animal inside of you (don't look in the mirror)
Banish it from your mind (the face in the mirror)
Execrate the willing state (don't look in the mirror)
Desecrate the pure of fate
[Chorus]
You think you're safe? you cannot hide
Deep within? see what's inside
Dysfunctional civility
Ultraviolet dream
So polite, so fair to all
You've just so fucked up
Withered and small
Doff the hat, play the game
While all the time you're playing just for your own gain
Aggressive creature, you're not so divine
Open your heart to the killer inside
Lex Talionis inside you keep
Laughing as your enemies weep
Laughing as your enemies weep
Eyes for eyes and teeth for teeth
Revealing in what lies beneath
Savagery the real law
Give as good as you get
Settle the score
[Chorus]
Smiling as your enemies scream
Hide your face from the mirror, avoid the truth
But you can never hide from the beast inside of you
You want to feel disgust
But deep within it's truly lust
Give in to the animal revealed
And to the beast inside you yield!You walk around, always screaming about
How you're trying to get your way
But you should just keep your fucking fat mouth shut
If you got nothing important to say
Because you
You got a lot to learn
All you do is bitch about the things in life that get you down
You never care for nobody else
If you saw how your life looks to me
I think you'd be ashamed of yourself
Because you
You got a lot to learn
You live inside your fucked up world
Talking loud with nothing to say
You got a lot to learn about your life
Because you can't keep on living this way
Because you
You got a lot to learnBy the light of the moon dark toughts rise up... they haunt my dreams
while the wind carries their voices and screams over the land
Awakened by sirens, armed with the wrath of Gods, we ride the storm, may our rage defend creation
Under cover of darkness you raped innocent life
beneath the bleeding horizon your end`s now justified
By the light of the moon dark thoughts rise up... now we haunt your dreams while the wind carries our warcries to your empiresSo many times in the past
I have been hearing
This word I don't understand:
What is |The Matrix|?
The quest is over today
'Cause the answer
Came right to me in the shape
Of Morpheus
[Bridge 1:]
Tell me what should I do
To get freedom of mind
For it's better to die for the truth
Than to live in a lie
I can't believe what I see
Is this the real world?
Can I be their chosen one
To end this evil?
About the Matrix I had
This revelation:
The only limit is my
Imagination
[Bridge 2:]
Maybe I'm not the one
I don't think he is right
But I won't let my friend die for me
Not without any fight!
[Chorus:]
Matrix
Now I know and I'm not afraid
For a new world is starting today
Matrix
Now the secret has been unveiled
I'm the one who will ease all the pain
[Bridge 1]
[Chorus]Reflex in the sky warn you, you're gonna die
Storm coming, you'd better hide from the atomic tide
Flashes in the sky turns houses into sties
Turns people into clay, radiation minds decay
Robot minds of robot slaves lead them to atomic rage
Plastic flowers, melting sun, fading moon falls upon
Dying world of radiation, victims of mad frustration
Burning globe of oxygen fire, like electric funeral pyre
Buildings crashing down to a cracking ground
Rivers turn to wood, ice melting to flood
Earth lies in death bed, clouds cry water dead
Tearing life away, here's the burning pay
Electric funeral
Electric funeral
Electric funeral
Electric funeralYoung fools drunk heroes are
Writhing by my feet
The killing time has come
I'll do it it's high time to
Punish unfeeling killers and rapists
They'll feel ache !
I'm a ghost a defender of innocent
And tormented creatures
I'm killing rapists of children and women
I'm murdering them with no marcy
I want them to feel like their victims
Ghost, revenge, killing time
Eternity
When I get even with them all
When there is no cry fear and ache
I'll go away but remember young fools
I'll back immediately when I'll get the cry for help...
I'm a ghost
Victim, murder, eternityall is lost
my will to live was taken today
the fire that used to burn
my heart
blown out cold
by winds too great
to hold at bay
all is lost
purpose and cause
betrayed
humilty torn
from my fingers
snatched
hope has turned
and clouded grey
who will take the pain
and shield me
shape my heart
and never leave me
empty or invisible
who will take the pain away?The limit is reached - untamed devastation
Moving down every breathing entity
Our wrath - our weapons are too real to ignore
Mercy - a forgotten word
aimless, blind ... just storming 'gainst everything
The gods you banished in the ancient days
Have still been worshipped by ones you fear
They gathered powr which you now loose
As your god fails by your side
The two ravens are there to pick your eyes
As we cry out the names of the pagan godsI'll-defined as I look in the mirror
Am I blind, am I blind
Am I given or just a straying fool
Feel it near
Something's here to watch
I feel their eyes sending shivers down my spine
Evil eyes, evil eyes
See me crawling as I'm falling off the edge
Paralyze, tantalize
Feel it there
From everywhere it sounds
And you'll fall away from heaven
Once you know you can't take no more of it
You will fall away from heaven
By the time you can see the crime against you
Hey - desperation
Angels crashing from the sky
How can you hold on to your way
In your mental disarray
I am your struggles
The answer to your pain
I am the fury in your eyes
I am reason, I am vice
It's there
From everywhere it sounds
And you'll fall away from heaven
Once you know you can't take no more of it
You will fall away from heaven
By the time you can see the crime against yousilence voice with whistle of the wind
through dim nocturnal, misty air
melancholic crying of the wind
full of agony and despair
those graves with those old trees near
and the silent humming in the air
weak mortals stiffen by the fear
if do they walk by night here
spirit of that place is filled with fright
come here dark beauty of the night
to the realm of the night out from the light
come here to be my bride
under the lunar silver glow
come to me and let me show
my kingdom and my silver throne
of realm of darkness of my own
seal this part with the kiss
kiss the beast and you won't miss
the world of mortal and the weak
come now and give me yourselfWhat do you think when you spit in my face?
How does it feel to accuse and to haze?
Now look at me, I'm not one of your kind,
And I prefer to stay behind.
And walk the wicked way!
We don't wanna be like you,
Don't you get the King Of Fools?
We don't mind your life is trite,
You are the King Of Fools.
We are never gonna be like you,
We don't follow - King of Fools,
You're the blind who lead the blind.
And walk the wicked way!
You feel at ease as you flock with the masses,
What do you see with your heads in their asses?
Keep on railing at what I believe ,
Call me insane and I am proud to be.
And I walk the wicked way!
We don't wanna be like you,
Don't you get the King Of Fools,
We don't mind your life is trite,
You are the King Of Fools.
We are never gonna be like you,
We don't follow - King of fools,
You are the blind who lead the blind!
- Guitar Solo -
We don't wanna be like you,
Don't you get that King of Fools?
We don't mind your life is trite,
You are the King of Fools!
We are never gonna be like you,
We don't follow - King of fools,
You are the blind who lead the blind.
You are the King of Fools!A humming noise from within
The masks fall off their faces
Like thousands and thousands before, they know this is the core
I will lead you to a new dawn, know my world of pain
I will take away your freedom
No, change your way of interpreting life
You'll see the maladjusted children
Parse, dissect my brain, let the sane stay chained
Listen to this cloud of mine and I'll open your well shut eyes
Remoulded, megalomania invalidates remorse
Earth scarred by the progress, selfishness
Take a look in the mirror
Behold the dark reflection of your suppressed desires
A world where you can be whole
Where you can find peace
I will lead you to a new dawn
Know my world of pain, I will take away your freedom
No, change your way of interpreting life
You'll see the maladjusted childrenSound the alarms for the end of the lie
That you've abused for far too long
We're in the hour of the fallout now
And there's nobody who can save our souls
Rise up for the things worth saving
Rise up for what we'll destroy
Rise up for something
Or you will be lost as you fade out inside of the noise
This is our wake up call
We have to pull it together
We have to save what we can
So put aside what you thought that you loved
And face the end
These bars our hearts must hold
Are only locked by those in charge of this broken world
And when their walls fall down
So will the keys to unlocking what we have never found
We are the children of love
Lost inside of this war...
We wear the scars on our hearts
But we don't know what they're for
we don't know what they're for
We are the noise of generation now.
We are the noise of generation now.
We are the noise of generation now.
We are the noise of generation now.
Oh, Yeah!
We are the noise
We are the noise
Hate
Is what we are bound by
Love
Is what will destroy
Trust
In everything selfish
Kill
What we don't deserve
I won't follow you to die
Welcome to the FalloutAncient cromlech carved of ice,
Etched against a glimmering sky,
Beneath the pale moonlight, the witch enthralling,
(like the sublime) scent of black lotus,
Ahiling a black sun with ebon rays,
Hailing a black moon as onyx agleam,
The dark horn sounds 'cross the nighted vale,
Shadows call in this bleak winter's dream.
I seize the throne round dagon's stone,
Dark hordes arise 'neath winter skies,
Forged 'neath the moon, by skulthur's tomb,
Blood-oath sealed, by frost-veiled steel.
White flames dancing on the snow,
The witch-fire gleams through northern skies,
The frost of heather upon her tongue,
Whispering dreams of atlantean spires,
Ruby lipped, midnight tressed, eyes as black as raven's wing,
Flesh so pale as dawn-frost gleaming,
Kisses sweet like moon-dew's tears.
Deep within the glacial ice-veiled temple,
Ancient enchantments
Summon the shades of the dreaming serpent kings...
And the ophidian throne once again draws
Power from the moon-shrouded crystal...
Mystic steel is anointed by the crimson wine of battle,
And blood reddens the gleaming snow.
Storm-borne bride of winter's fire,
Serpent-witch of the whispering fens,
Veils of scarlet and sable,
Blood spilled in the vault of night,
Frost-garlanded, the mind-binding glimmer
Of tear-filled ophidian eyes,
The gleam of winter moonlight upon black waters,
Nighted spells of the enchantress.
Scourge of angsaar, wielder of the black sword,
Immortal lord of darkmere, serpent-witch ensorcle me.
Black sun... black moon!I'm scratching a picture on the wall
Of a man called nothing at all
Why are they keeping me here
Please just let me go
Please let me go
I'm hearing voices deep inside my head
But I don't want to listen
Why don't you leave me, just leave me alone
'Cause I'm in no condition
Join us, I won't follow you
Join us, there's nothing you can do
Join us, you're never going to win
Join us, cause I'll never let you in
What are these creatures crawling over me?
I'm in no condition
Join us, I won't follow you
Join us, there's nothing you can do
Join us, you're never going to win
Join us, cause I'll never let you in
I claw at the walls until my fingers bleed
Is it really happening or is it just a dream
I look in the mirror
His eyes stare right back
He is always watching
This room turns to black
We are the voices deep inside you're head
But you don't want to listenThis song is instrumental!!!Life has no meaning, unyielding obsession
Grasping at strings of a life I once knew
Death by my own hands, achieving objective
Blade to my throat, I calmly greet death
In Hell I burn, my faith is sustained
In Hell I burn again
In Hell I burn, no questions remain
In Hell I burn for Satan
Opened eyes dream, unheavenly torture
Raping the world of the dead
Burning in Hell and viewing the unseen
Satisfied feasting of flesh
In Hell I burn, my faith is sustained
In Hell I burn again
In Hell I burn, no questions remain
In Hell I burn for SatanDisenchanting the romantic
This is the real, this is the shame
These limbs search feverishly for the gift of gravity
Coarse twine tears clean
And I have thought about this very instance for all time
Decades longer than you or I
Crimson comforting, scorching this flesh, giving it's caring for me
And I have thought about these moments for all time
Dangling from a silver lining
These lungs welcome the crimson tides of misfortune
Hell to pay, this is my farewell to this cityI was once blinded by Satan
I had no friend
I was a prisoner of these
Of these four walls that surround me
But then
I heard him
A voice calling me
My answer to all
My friend, you know the answer
But will you heed the call
I know you want to reach out and touch Him
But He can't answer if you don't ask at all
Do you hear Him
He's calling out to you
Do you hear Jesus calling?
He's calling youThey feed you lies and bring you pain
Your life sucked from your veins
Clever disguise falling from grace
And now the sins are marching on
Inside my mind
All I've got
I'm taking over me
See our generation storm the burning heart
No more places in the hull
We're all about to fall
Empty memories are shattering our dreams
Can you recall?
Pledge your allegiance
Pledge your allegiance
You hate them yet you won't retain
The wars you fight and endorse
The path of no return you take
Until you lose control
Inside my mind
All I've got
I'm taking over me
See our generation storm the burning heart
No more places in the hull
We're all about to fall
Empty memories are shattering our dreams
Can you recall?
See our generation storm the burning heart
No more places in the hull
We're all about to fall
Empty memories are shattering our dreams
Can you recall?
See our generation storm the burning heart
No more places in the hull
We're all about to fall
Empty memories are shattering our dreams
Can you recall?Turn on the havoc
Let confusion reign
Random acts of violence
Shall not be done in vain
A din of destruction
An overture of rage
Countdown to bedlam
Let the mayhem
Accelerate
Soon we all
Will celebrate
Feel the primal urge
Adrenaline surge
Join the altercation
To the third degree
At full capacity
With no discrimination
Total oblivion
No phenomenon
Just par for the course
To the starting line
Your time to shine
On my mark we
[Chorus]
Quarrel!
We subjugate
We bring calamity
Everybody cooperate
Let's start the bedlam
One, two, three
Anticipating the
Coming of the brawl
Collide like cannon fire
But only on my call
I provoke the melee
And I fan the flame
Coerce the herd into a
Stampede
They salivate
Turmoil
We aggravate
Feel the primal urge
Adrenaline surge
Join the altercation
To the third degree
At full capacity
With no discrimination
Total oblivion
No phenomenon
Just par for the course
To the starting line
Your time to shine
On my mark we
[Chorus]
On my command
Everybody run amuck
Slam into everyone
Never stop to give a fuck
This is the pinnacle
Of tumult,
It's what you've waited for so
Let the vortex
Stimulate
On this day
We commemorate
Feel the primal urge
Adrenaline surge
Join the altercation
To the third degree
At full capacity
With no discrimination
Total oblivion
No phenomenon
Just par for the course
To the starting line
Your time to shine
On my mark we
[Chorus]There's sin in my heart
But I stand accused
Of crimes that I did not commit
Tried and confined
Judged by your eyes
But I am an innocent man
Bound and forsaken
Liberty taken
A life in the void
Is now transformed into a life destroyed
Seven years alone
And eighteen more to go
The curse of time ain't on my side
But I will not let go
Into the fray
I am the prey
Fear is the air that I breathe
Imprisoned by hate
Ensnared by my fate
I wish for nothing but to escape
My mind drifts away
To once better days
Order once resigned
Where I've never seen true corruption
Seven years alone
And eighteen more to go
The curse of time ain't on my side
But I will not let go
I will not be held
I won't be contained
Tear down the walls
Nothing remains
Tried and confined
Judged by your eyes
But I am an innocent man
Seven years alone
And eighteen more to go
The curse of time ain't on my side
But I will not let go
I will never let go
I will not let go
I will never let goWasted hope,
all my wishes are falling down again,
with the consciousness of a reality that deceives me
Secret worlds hidden by ignorance that steals us from inside
From the loneliness of our souls
we'll start to be the same thing,
we'll start to be what we always wanted,
and our wishes come true
It's the time,
it's the moment,
we can make all things better,
we can save ourselves,
we can look for a better way,
this is not the end
We're cruelty victims;
predestined not to be together,
sentenced to live this life in sorrow
Listen to this silence,
look me in the eyes
and you'll find my declaration,
confided without lies
I remember "once upon a time",
when our bodies were designing abstract shapes,
drawing lines deep down in our minds
I remember those times as the best ones of my whole life
Listen to this silence,
look me in the eyes
and you'll find my declaration,
confided without lies
Use your imagination,
follow your heart,
then come to me and speak the words you've held apart
Time for me is ending,
please don't turn around but start running away,
don't wait for meTime marches on, you are lft behind
Nobody cares if you live or you die
The powers that be they just can't find the time
To care for thei own, now that's surely a crime
What can you do
When they turn their backs
While feed other nations
You know it's a fact
Forgotten no one to turn to
Forgotten society's burn
Forgotten left on the street
Forgotten should never be
We police all the world but we still fail to see
The problems that plague our democracy
The lack of humanity boggles my mind
While the government plays deaf, dumb and blind
Deaf, dumb and blind
Deaf, dumb and blind
Deaf, dumb and blind
You're like a disease
They won't look for a cure
Just let you fade away
Won't have to see you, anymoreDrums of war sound. Warriors are gathered to fight on the Wigri?r
plain. Charging men, wolves, ravens and gods, worms and beasts of
darkness; the plain is lit with fire. Blood is flowing, bits of
flesh, severed limbs, smashed skulls and bodies lie strewn across
the plain. Screams cut the air, screams of anger and pain, the
sound of metal blades and armour clashing, clubs smashing bodies.
Then, for a brief moment, everything stops. It is as if the
universe holds its breath. Wuotan has fallen on the Wigri?r
plain; swallowed by Fanjariho. For a moment the time stands
still. For Wuotan; Hail and Joy!Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Where are the children?
Needles in their veins
Waiting for something
Waiting for the rain
I'm only nothing
Nothing you can hide
Waiting for morning
And the morning tide
I can't see
Eyes all around me
I can't see
Eyes all around me
Looking for something
Something you may find
Searching the whole World
It's inside your mind
Digging a hole deep
Deep inside your soul
It's the season
It's the place to go
You want a holy war
You want blood on the shore
You want to live your life
By the words that were wrote
That we broke, so take note
'Cause you're not gonna fall
So get up and revoke
You want to scream Allah?
Follow Hisballah
All the religions of the conquerors
You want to scream Allah?
You want to scream Allah?
Allah
You want a holy war
You want blood on the shore
You want to live your life
By the words that were wrote
That we broke, so take note
'Cause you're not gonna fall
So get up and revoke
You want to scream Allah?
Follow Hisballah
All the religions of the conquerors
You want to scream Allah?
You want to scream Allah?
Allah
I can't see
Eyes all around me
So get up and revoke
You want to scream Allah? (I can't see)
Follow Hisballah
All the religions of the conquerors
You want to scream Allah? (Eyes all around me)
You want to scream Allah?
Allah
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?[Music: Z. Nilsson / Lyrics T. Dahlstrm]

I am the soul burner
Welcome to the burning of souls
I can kill your pain
Welcome to the burning of souls
But there is a price to pay
Welcome to the burning of souls
Dwell in my hellWistfulness upon our wisdom
Distrustful of our thoughts we lie depraved
From your integrity.
"Go out to the unknown realms of curiosity!"
Should I leave or should I stay?
"Think of tomorrow's equable results!"
There's no guidance on my way.
"Observe the rules of fear
To gain control
Over liberty's destruction
Inside your stagnated self.
Listen to our whispering."
I've always heard.
"Listen to our melody.
Expand dimensions."
I never did.
"Expand dimensions.
Liquidize your life!"Well, I'm doing this from that place
Where the young bodies stack to the bluest of blue skies
A child grown quick kicking it with an ice-pick
Age of 8 Babyface straight-up scared to die
Seen 1 little, 2 little, 3 little homicides
Kids don't rank so they shank in front of baby eyes
Bullet-scarred, prison-barred
The one time's got my face to the ground, they want me down
Downset at the bottom! On the come up to say some
Down! Downset at the bottom! Coming up from the slum!
Down! Downset at the bottom! On the come up to say some
Down! Down! Down! Down!
Bronze complexion, converse and khakis
Enough for the fuss of a Crash to straight jack me
Brotha, brotha, brotha, how you make 'em get down?
Systematic static can't stifle the set's sound
Jack for the mic and I'll still get it going on
Making my statement with a Fatcap and Krylon
Pee-ping my voice from the L.A. underground
The plan from the man is to demand they keep me down
Downset at the bottom! On the come up to say some
Down! Downset at the bottom! Coming up from the slum!
Down! Downset at the bottom! On the come up to say some
Down! Down! Down! Down they got me, down!
Got ya, got ya, yeah, you know, I straight ya
Reveal to heal in our sectarian obstacles
Wipe the dirt off the eyes of the hate child
Damn with the program imposed since the juvenile
Shit is so thick that you don't want to deal with it
Set's got heart to consist like an activist
Ain't going to live in comfort while shit gets words
I got the voice of the voiceless and life comes first
So what you're gonna do? What you're gonna do?
What you're gonna do when the shit comes down on you?
The set's gonna be down, yeah, you know like we've always been
The ghetto survivors got no soldier extinction
The man ain't down with multi-ethic ethics
Division is wicked and Downset ain't with it
My word is my fire for life and love is the sound
You gotta kill me to silence me, fool, you can't keep me down
Downset at the bottom! On the come up to say some
Down! Downset at the bottom! Freedom in a cage
Down! Downset at the bottom! On the come up to say some
Down! Down! Down! Down!Kuolevan rukous

And the glory
Forever!
Scholar of the unlight
Great volcano of excrement
Rippling eager to erupt
Reconstellate the firmament
Behold the great accuser
A megalinga of throbbing zeal
Raptor yearning to pierce
To rape the seventh seal
Destroyer of cosmos
Implore the unGod
Implode the Sun
There's none wronging the serpent's cult
Untouched and ignored
With the serpent's might
And the trumpets blow
In the shadow of the horns
For Thine is the kingdom
And the power
For Thine is the kingdom
And the glory
Forever!
Lightning that stabs the heavens
Thou quiver the Mount Sinai
Spit rocks on tablets of cofenant
Listen for the tempest's rasp
Azazel! Apolyon!

For it never rose

Empire's fall
Petition the lord with fire

Lyrics: Swano
(03:41)
Gazing at the sky colred with a gelam yet unseen.
Birds no longer fly.
It's not a dream this blinding beam.
(03:42)
Panic, someone realized.
Everything is iced the manic depression of the centuries.
The world is soon devastated
With ease.
(03:43)
The temperature decreases.
Watch the frozen sean, as my pulse go down.
The king has lost its crown.
(03:44)
Cold sun, will never shine
(03:45)
Freezing clouds, ready to fall.
Killing us all.
Time after time I hear prophets that yell,
We've got life for sale.
Children (now) mentally deformed.
Remember the sun and how it warmed.
A natural system is wasted.
Earth saw no grace, dead.
(03:46)
Everything is captured in capsules of ice.
Still I wonder will they all awake in paradise?
Eyes of ice cannot see frozen souls unable too flee.
(03:47)
The maze of my existence, there's no resistance.
Finally I leave this shell, rotting soul, I can feel the smell...
Of hell. Terminal end. Myfinal peace, I descend.
Everything is left to infest, but even the maggots will rest.
Cold sun.
To be continued?Sodom precise, burn the man
A promise of scorching
We hold a torch to the sun
Flame to the surface
We hold a torch to the sun
Flame to the surface
Cruddy crud epidermis
Skin melt fashion
Burning man passion
Seek a sense of shelter
Within an oasis of deprivated clowns
We'll take a trip through the devil's heat
Heat
Meander through the meadowless fields
Carnival bizarre
Black rock dryness
Lures chaos mongers
Banishment of all that is taught
Complete flesh rot
Agonized, the smoldering circus
Summon the desert deity
"Take these and feel us"
Psychedelia, hallucinate
Sift the embers
You'll find me
Buried alive
With drums of thunder
Solar god arise
He'll rise, arise
He'll rise, arise
He'll rise, arise
He's risen
Bow down, hands raised
Blistered, half crazed
Drifting alone
Ignite my soul
Reborn to be
A perpetual
Flame to the surface1-30-33
A reign this world could not foresee
Into the mind of a fascist leader
And the birth of a deadly regime
Eradicate
Burned to ash, there was no escape
As he rose to power
Approach the final hours
Behold, the holocaust has come to take your lives
How could this come to be?
Propaganda make believe
This Aryan master race
The ashes tell no lies
Children cry out from starvation
No sympathy for God's creation
Children cry out, suffocating
No sympathy, death was waiting
Lest we forget
This evil anti-Semitic
As bodies filled the streets
Forever etched in memories
These final days
Have set the bar for all to raise
A withered shell
You've crawled your way to the pits of hell
The horror, the terror
Your lifeless body lays
Known as nothing but a coward for the rest of days
For the rest of days
The horror, the terror
Your lifeless body lays
Known as nothing but a coward
CowardClock starts ticking away
Count the minutes you are in it till judgment day
Life spent hard on the run
Never staying. Never paying for what you've done
Lookin' at you outside you want to be clean
But your, Dirty lies like the inside of your, girlie magazines
Wanna know the reason they call me obscene?
You're gonna meet me on your color TV screen
Public enemy #1, Targets on my head better get a gun
Public Enemy #1, In the home of the brave
Public Enemy #1, Targets on your head better get a gun
Public Enemy #1, In the home of the free
Got a Virus to spread
Got you hooked breathing heavy now you see red
An urge getting ready to feed
Now that you live it there's a lesson you must heed
They got a bullseye trained on you and there's nothing that you ever can do
They got a sure shot right in low
And you won no no no no no no know
What it feels like to be like me cuz you want to be real
But you're looking into the mirror and staring back at a fiend
Wipe out you insides but you're never coming clean
Gonna make the headlines of your color TV screenBehind the veil of destiny
The path might turn in sudden twists of irony.
Night turns to day, dark turns to light.
Wielder of steel, tier of ropes.
The hooded slayer without shame and without hope.
Sentenced to death but slipped away
To live the role of a hangman at display.
Come see the play of wicked irony.
Join the crowd of hunger
For the joy of the Carnival of Disgust.
Lonely he walks, outcast of shame.
Fearful and spat on yet respected for his name.
Marked by the blade to be known by sight
As a walking dead man for a crime pitch black as night.Inside of you
Tears of pure frustration
Cascading down your heart
What could fill your restless soul
You may never know
You may never know
Come inside my painless world
Inside eternity
Open up your mind
And take a ride
Fly into the night
Broken, wounded world
Broken, wounded minds
No place for you to live
Liar's fires burn
Melting ice of trust
Endless filthy days
Laugh of evil lust
Fly:
Come inside my painless world
Inside eternity
Fly:.
Open up your mind and take a ride
Fly into the nightAquatic fortitude!
Unscathed and witless, below the hopes and fears of robotic fixtures.
Proposed to the fluent lovers, hopeless romantics enthralled in semantics.
They'll flee the highlands, they'll flee their skin.
Quick, under the cover of darkness!
Dj vu and amnesia simultaneously.
Haven't I been here before?
Did I just ask myself that question?
Illustrious madmen knitting quilts for comforters.
Well, isn't it true that we all need outlets to grow?
It's everything that it's not.
Knots everywhere.
There's contradictions in all of us, in everything.
Oh, luxuries maim lunatic.
Auction / action.
Hit the button, admire the implosions.
We're burning ourselves alive, screaming 'peace out!' at the ocean.
Although the flames will engulf the laughter, best bob while limbless and out of air supply.
Anything that's worth doing is worth doing right.
"brevity is the brother of brilliance."
The screw that holds it all together.
In place, in time solo duets.
Audiences fainted!
Live dying to be someone else.
Die living to be yourself.
Possessions are lucrative at best.
Investments buy some time.
Exceptions forth, everything cast aside.
Buy / sell, buy / sell.
Bovine divine!Bloodied, torn and twisted
Severe mutilation is all that remains
Stagnation in shrink-wrap
Empty the contents onto the mortuary slab...
The morbid, muted body
Is dissected, lacerated and shred-
Life is hard as a mortuary technician
The fumes go straight to my head...
The trunk now depleted gristle, with bactericidal decay
This discissed disarticulation I bludgeon as I ablate...
Diluted spittle, bile and gore
Congealing puddles on the floor
Grotesquely dismembered
As the cavities I harshly sever...
Stabbing at the trachea, chest walls I puncture
Slicing back flesh I tear, subject to malacia...
"Advanced rigor mortis, the corpse internally bruised
Kaleidoscopic livor mortis, the carcass a shade of livid blue
Joints are stiffened, I now bend and crack
The cerebrum pulped, with cranial collapse..."
Bodily embalmed and fluids tapped
Maceration is oozing, as the insides I unwrap...
Finished with the fragments, a mass of stinking waste
Spread-eagled bloody mess, I hastily eviscerate...
Advanced Pyathrosis - let there be rot (fun in the morgue)
Foul autodigestion - necrotic mutation...
The gaping chest is crudely stitched up
Internal organs are hastily replaced
The carnage totally disfigured
Another pathological waste...
Flowing blood crusts
The corpse is totally rotten to the core
The miserable, festering stiff
I dismember with my saw...
The wounds are stitched, I shabbily try to repair
Disintegrating with histolycis and everyday wear and tear...
"Cadaveric dissolution, sliced, ripped and deceased
Eructated gases are gurgling as they bleed
Congested pus, blood and autodigested gore
Tissue corrodes as aggression gnaws..."
The mortuary table I now wipe, sponge and clean
Washing away the remains of life, the slab now gleams...
The evaporating reek of putrefaction gets right up my nose
Carnage, chunks and leftover pieces in the bin I dispose...
Advanced pyathrosis - let there be rot (fun in the morgue)
Foul autodigestion - necrotic mutation...Caught in a Woodsleep
Miles Down the Crypts Beneath
Desert Sands lay Deep
Sworn to an Obscure Belief
Shapes with Serpent Faces
Watchers in Deathwish Cry
Warpzones in Mazes
Venomous Tounges in Sigh
Upon the Salty Wall of the Broody Gargoyle
Broody - Come Forward from the Salt in your Wall
Broody - A Weak Human Soul is your Call[Slayer Cover]
Eyes Upon Me Watching Me in My Perpetual Sleep Dreams Deceive Me My
Future Depends on a Mindless Dream I've Fallen From Promises Damned
To Take Risks on My Own The Masterful Science That Freezes Your Mind
And Your Soul The Wretched Dream Is Realized The Human Race is to be
Crystalized Thoughts Of Laughter Filling The Head Of The Master In
Charge Worlds Of Wonder Is This A Cure or a Painless Death I'll
Fight And Resist Till They All See The End That is Near The Doctors
The Lawers And G-Men Are Living In Fear Living My Life With One
Distant Hope
A Cure That Will Kill My Invincible Foe the graveWe see the damage, the bodies lying everywhere
You are the reason of this, but you don't seem to care
We fought our way through the night, one shot is left to do
We're getting closer to see, the real side of you
We see the darkness, taking over your soul
It's time to end this, tonight you're gonna fall
Again we march into this abyss
We build our path
We're gonna carry on until we finally meet our death
We are not coming back
We've reached the point of no return
Now we will stand aside
And watch you motherf***er
All of this time we've been there for you
We've overcomed everything you've put us through
Now there is nothing left for us to fear
You won't even notice when we'll disappear
Behold the mess that you've done
No lives are left to break
You've ruined everything
With only one single mistake
And now the chaos will rise
There's nothing you can do
Now you can only regret
cause it's consuming you
So let the fire burn
To cover up the trace
You'll face the consequences
The ones you can't erase
We hear you calling out our names
But we won't help you now
We'll watch you bleed again
As you are going down
You're on your own
and noone will save you now
This is the final fight
you're gonna fall tonight
While we will stand
and watch as the fire ignite
This is the final fight
you're gonna fall tonight
Go!
So let the fire burn
To cover up the trace
You'll face the consequences
The ones you can't erase
We hear you calling out our names
But we won't help you now
We'll watch you bleed again
As you are going downWithout you my heart aches, but for one night the world stood still. Alone. Collected in a quiet way.The burden of self doubt goes up in flames. As the sunset bounced off darkened clouds. A peaceful memory grows that life goes on without you. There you were in my arms, staring into my eyes, I want to hold you and let you die. Regrets painted across star filled skies. Never knowing when our time would end. As the moonlight shines on hollow eyes. A frightful image grows. Life goes on without you. And there you were in my arms. staring into my eyes. I want to hold you and let you die. Your everything I ever wanted, and now I'll watch you slowly die... and life goes on without you.The blue cloud of doom
Fell upon my land
Felt upon my sword
Beheading for a feast
Our swords covered with blood
Beneath the melting sun
The praise is for pagan lords
Returning from the hunt
Our village was set afire
The females screamed for help
The sand-demons have scarred our sacred land
Ashes and smoke were left
To remind us of failure
The women had been stained
By the rodents of the desert
Carriers of the disease
Left for us to find
We must please Satan attack the rodents of the sands
Battle...
Swallowed by the sand
The land was fully conquered
But the desert could not be owned
They slithered to the core
To praise Yahweh at nightfall
The children had been taken
Their juice sucked into the sand
The sun reflected their blood
Fluids consumed by the rodents below
The blue cloud of doom
Fell upon my land
Felt upon my swordI am a murderer
No remorse in sin
Kill you fast and sure
My trouble within
Drug dealer you're my enemy
Explanations for what I do?
The roots of your character for the ones you took
Now it's time to break the rules
To sell them short good times
More to bring them the grief
You came on all strong to breed your big crime greed
Deep and deeper in me it burns and I cannot deny my eyes
Human pride is on my side
And I shoot with my hateful pride
She was the sunrise, but she is faint
She's disguised as a new shape
For a new life with a new name
Why is she fading her own way to destroy herself on his side?
Oh why?
No, I fight no inner fight to keep in the fright
That killed her guide[instrumental]Stabbed in the back
Betrayed a thousand times
Never surrendered
I've risen above the dirt
[Chorus:]
Alone
Insane
Alive
Rising
Above
Beyond
Spat at and mocked
Hatred my driving force
Fly while they crawl
They can't touch me now
[Chorus...]
Restless life
I created and destroyed
Can't stop at all
Until the final hourOur Christmas bonus
Was spared with patience
While men who owned us
Took paid vacations
They tried to clone us
To fight deflation
They should have blown us
What?
For reparations
Instead we eavesdropped
Found secret files
Of bad accounting
In shredded piles
As pressure mounted
So did denials
Evidence will drag those criminals
To face the man in trial
Good-bye Martha my dear!
Go Away
Taking down upper management. What?
Taking down upper management. What?
Taking down upper management. What?
Taking down upper management. What?
For all those who work honestly
Building up our economy
Some bosses take the liberty
To take our money happily
Though what's up falls eventually
They tore down our economy
Lock them up in a penitentiary
Hide the key for half a century
Good-bye Martha my dear!
Go Away
Taking down upper management. What?
Taking down upper management. What?
Taking down upper management. What?
Taking down upper management
Captains go down with their ships
Not jump ship as they go down
All these pricks stood back
And watched their companies drown
They paid us with junk bonds
Sold stocks before the sale
But they failed! All Hail!
To Chief Execs going to jail!
Good-bye Martha my dear!
Go Away
Taking down upper management. What?
Taking down upper management. What?
Taking down upper management. What?
Taking down upper management
Good-bye Martha my dear!
Go AwayA cruel place, watered with my blood
A terrile vision I see in my dream
The sky in the net of evil eyes
Spreads its embodied rage over me
A silent scream from the deep
Of my mind, throws the gates open...
Welcome to the land of sorrow
Where your hope will be destroyed
Your fate is written in blood
I set out on the river of souls
A burnt raft on the night rivers
The sorrowful voice of the riverside trees:
The roaring wind, the anger of gods
A silent scream from the deep
Of my mind, throws the gates open...
Welcome to the land of sorrow
Where your hope will be destroyed
Your fate is written in bloodDon't give me your line
Won't let it go this time
And make a mockery of this obscenity
It's gotten out of control
Some poor unfortunate soul
Will pay the price again, to feed your vanity
The fascist face of the day
Contributes blood to the fray
And wreaks his devastation on humanity
He hears his own people cry
As countless innocents die
He stands defiant in his own insanity
Another child denied their human right to a life
Free from the shackles that assure their slavery
The monster in human skin, employs abduction again
Collecting innocents
I see the global decline, while wealthy pockets are lines
The masses begging them to show some sympathy
Without a care in their heart, they let it all fall apart
Their twisted rationales have never made sense to me
It seems destruction is a form of success for you
These tragic visions of loss will never leave me
You try to justify the pain that you've brought
But you're out of line, you're out of line
They Machiavellian minds concoct their wicked designs
They think they're standing on the side of destiny
Constricting freedom again they've wrought the ultimate sin
They make pariahs of the sons of liberty
And in the name of their god they wage their war and applaud
The deadly dogma that controls society
Who fucking gave you that right? to spread perpetual night
Your holy rationales have never made sense to me
It seems destruction is a form of success for you
These tragic visions of loss will never leave me
You try to justify the pain that you've brought
But you're out of line, you're out of line
You know I can't imagine anything less from you
Not a single word from your mouth is worth believing
No way to rectify the havoc you've wrought
Know, you're out on line you're out of line
I fear it coming, hear it coming again
A new apocalypse in sight
I see it coming, feel it coming again
We won't capitulate this time
It seems destruction is a form of success for you
These tragic visions of loss will never leave me
You try to justify the pain that you've brought
But you're out of line, you're out of line
You know I can't imagine anything less from you
Not a single word from your mouth is worth believing
No way to rectify the havoc you've wrought
Know, you're out on line you're out of lineThou art a flower, growing into his soul.
You light his silent path of night
Thy winds they blow for his love and shadows
He's praising the beauty of thee, in a far away land.
Thou art The Amaranth!
(Remberering failed love)
Meeting
Connecting
Wishing
Hoping.
Embracing
Kissing
Loving
Promising forever.
Spending
Fading
Thou wert a flower, growing into his soul.
Crying
Despising. You lit his silent path of night!
Bleeding
Screaming
Suffering
Hating for love!
Never I knew a heart could be so true
I dream to fly together forever with you!
Our crimson souls would surrender their pain
Our tears would wash away the stains.
It's so cold here, without you!
Within her, the essence of Night
Within her, beloved Venus shines!
Fading away, the last sunray
Fading away, the last sunray
Autumn hath come to thy heart, Autumn hath come to my heart,
but maybe the rain brings her to you... but maybe the rain brings her to me
So true and so dark, her beautiful soul forlorn. So true and so dark, my flower!
She is The Amaranth!
Will she rise in me?
Will I rise in her?
Will she rise in him?
Will he rise in her?Don't wait, don't wait
Don't wait, don't wait
You're way too late
Don't wait, don't wait
The beat goes on
Until it's gone
She strolls so slowly with her ball and chain
The cling clang chatters patterns with the patter of rain
Stares in a mirror cracked in seven different ways
With holes in her umbrella dripping on her face
Her makeup running down like the tragedy face
Alone on a city street surrounded by space
She opens her mouth to scream and shout out the pain
But all that comes out are silent sobbing sounds of restrain
The beat goes on
Until it's gone
There comes a time when she will trust her belly
Not disappear from the world like Machiavelli no
Forfeit the pride it's not a crime but she's running out of time
And denies it's showing while her anxiety's growing old
Don't wait, don't wait
Don't wait, don't wait
You're way too late
Don't wait, don't wait
The beat goes on
Until it's gone
The beat goes on
Don't wait
Until it's gone
Don't wait
The beat goes onAss jocks suck off Boston hardcore.For all of my sins and for all of my lies
I have to pay for my life the highest price
the chief of the dark side is always waiting still
it's payback time for me - oh what a sin
To sell all my friends for my absurd money dreams
to sell the best things I had for my stupid holy deals
to undersign a contract with my own evil blood
for gold and for silver not for God
Father forgive me for the stupid things I've done
I'm on my way to see the light I'm always on the run
Father forgive me for the stupid things I've done
I'm on my way to see the light I'm always on the run
I was once recruited to stand in their lines
to kill and steal for them for their mighty greedy lies
now it's too late for me my time has yet come
now I have to pay for the things that I've done
For all of my sins and for all of my lies
I have to pay for my life the highst price
The chief of the dark side is always waiting still
it's payback time for me - oh what a sin
So now I'm standing here, it's my judgement day
so believe it's not my fault they ruled and I recalled
so I'm awake all day under the dark side of sun
cause now my soul is burning in the purgatory.I feel the melancholy of deepening summer night
And I loathe it
The dark shades of green entangle me inside
The dices falling
Oh with wounded hearts
Accepting the fate
We shall drift apart
And never meet again
The years gone by, approaching the final step
Will you be there by me?
Oh with wounded hearts
Accepting the fate
What we thought would last forever
Ends right here
I touch your cheek through the morning light
Receive a sleepy smile in answer
Whatever is good in this twisted world
It's all here to be taken
Oh with wounded hearts
Accepting the fate
We shall drift apart
And never meet again
But till the day arrives
I'll give you all my best
Stand by you in heaven
And in the deepest of hellIt's so damn hard, without you here, I feel so lost.
I can barely breathe, I've cried so much, why'd you leave me.
I'm suffocating, my heart is broken.
I'm right here waiting, sitting, hoping,
That you come back, to me one day;
And everything would go back to the way it was,
The things we've done, the way we love.
Ooh ohh
(chorus)
Cause I need you here with me, baby you were everything.
I know you still feel the same way.
The pain is overwhelming,
These memories are playing,
Haunting me I can't get away
Cause we're soo wrong, we should hold on.
We were soo wrong, we should hold on.
Tell me why we always go through this.
Ooh ohh
Fight about the small things, it's foolish.
Ooh ohh
We're putting ourselves through so much pain.
Ooh ohh oh
But baby. we're the only ones to blame.
Ooh ohh
(chorus)
Cause I need you here with me, baby you were everything.
I know you still feel the same way.
This pain is overwhelming,
These memories are playing,
Haunting me, I can't get away.
Cause we're soo wrong, we should hold on.
We were soo wrong, we should hold on.
It's soo damn hard, without you here, I feel so lost.
I can barely breathe, I've cried soo much, why'd you leave me.
(chorus)
Cause I need you here with me, baby you were everything.
I know you still feel the same way.
This pain is overwhelming, these memories are playing, haunting me, I can't get away.
Cause we're soo wrong, we should hold on.
We were soo wrong, we should hold on.WHEN THE MOONLIGHT

Delivering the pain, condemning one and all
Eradicate the conscious stricken, everyone must die
Slaves to the fear we've created out impending doom

Avoiding the warning we've turned a blind eye to the truth

Voices unheard in white noise forgotten
Caught in the web of disinformation

That we could never obelise
Then how could anyone supply a doubt
I take you at your word
But the tale could have a flaw
And if you find yourself in awe
Then you'll only hunger for the truth
Veritas numquam vincitur ipsa
Ne qua dicuntur imprudenter credas
When I'm crucified, taunted and denied
I'll stand strong, with my back against the wall
At times it seems so very hard
All that we learned we must discard
That everyone you'd ever trust has lied
When I'm crucified, haunted and defied
I belong to the few that died for all
You cannot question or defy
Or you'll find out the hard way why
You'd better run before you walk alone
Veritas numquam vicitur ipsa
Ne quae dicuntur imprudenter credas
Sed tua teneasYou might be just what I need
No I would not change a thing
Been dreaming of this so long
But we only exist in this song
The thing is, I'm not worth the sorrow
And if you come and meet me tomorrow
I will hold you down, fold you in
Deep, deep, deep in the fiction we live
I break in two over you
I break in two
And if a piece of you dies
Autumn, I will bring you back to life
Of course I see you
I doYour sweet efluvium
distilled in drowned season
receive it from
receive it from
your strange lips,
I've engendered
silent caress
but now you can
but now you can
break my self.
Angel efluvium, entomb me beneath the bitter cloak
angel efluvium, your efluvium in my mouth.
You can die in other love
I denied your urge
I'm buried with my faults
`cause you embrace me
`cause you embrace me.
You can die in other love
I denied your urge
I'm buried with my faults
`cause you embrace me
`cause you embrace me.(Hoglan)
As you enter your realm of incorruption
The values of morality in their pristine state
The walls that surround you in a gentle caress
Protect you from the world of hate
And the earth is full of lurid madmen
Misogynists abound waiting to produce your fall
But the being you should most fear when you turn out the lights
Is in no way human at all
A puritan soul, distanced from sin
A libertine's ways never for you
But now you've no choice in this carnival game
A toy to be done with what I choose
No one answers! To the cries in the middle of your dreams
No one answers! To the cries rapidly becoming screams
No one answers! Though you're forced to perform against your will
No one answers!! So shut up and accept your fate!!
You recoil in revulsion, but that will soon pass
As you rebel to my sensual skill
Non-compliance won't do, you will truly serve me well
Or I'll have no choice but to kill
It's the way that I work, it's the way that I am
I'm selfish, my needs are quite great
Exhibiting my power over the weaker fairer sex
My Leviathan desires to satiate
Aha what is this? You're beginning to relent?
As I have said, none resist my charm
Your confession of faith is far behind you now
And to think at the start you were alarmed!
I am your savior, you await my return
Your libidinous urges long repressed
What I do to you is unhumanly possible
I've now introduced you to your future ways&Gross abominations
Dreams that haunt your sleep
Dying to awaken
Unheard cries you weep
Inner vision drowning
Shredding terrors nears
Clogging lungs youÂ¹re choking on
Hallucinogenic fears

About a man, strong and true
Brian Boru was his name
And through his deeds a nation grew
He was born in a time of bondage
The viking raiders claimed his lands
His hatred grew when he saw his mother
Killing by vicious viking hands
His brother Mahon strived for peace
Brian knew it would never come
The vikings have us by the throat!
They kill our children just for
Boru left with a group of men
They rode into the fading light
He would attack the many viking camps
And vanish in the dark of night
Brian Boru, our beloved son
Fought the Dane, he fought and won
Losy his life at eighty eight
Death by a viking blade was his fate
Brian Boru, our last Ard Ri
Led the Gael to victory
Could not stand his countries plight
He removed the vikings from his sight
Malachy, the king of Meath, with Brian face to face
They both agreed that Brian should take
The monarchy of the Gaelic race
Brian had much word to do
To heal the wounds of Danish reign
He planned a massive call to arms
To remove the last of the Dane
To Clontarf Brian's army marched
To give the Dane their final fight
The army charged with swords help high
The viking line was soon in sight
The battle rages for many hours
And many fine warriors fell
But victory was always ours
The Gaelic might could not be quelled
Brian Boru, our beloved son
Fought the Dane, he fought and won
Losy his life at eighty eight
Death by a viking blade was his fate
Brian Boru, our last Ard Ri
Led the Gael to victory
Could not stand his countries plight
He removed the vikings from his sight"When We Were Young"
Remember the days when
We were the heroes
Singing our favourite songs
We fell into pieces
Nothing could break us
Nights went on and on
Life went on and on
Memories are fading
They were sacred
Back when we were young
Back when we were young
When we were young
When we were young
Even though we thought we had it all
It went away
When we were young
But we got lost
We got lost
Didn't swim in the main stream
Created our own dreams
What a difference a day can make
The bonds are gone now
Gone forever
Still I wonder where you are
Life went on and on
When we were young
When we were young
Even though we thought we had it all
It went away
When we were young
But we got lost
We got lost
Even though we thought we had it all
It went away
We got lost
Lost
Back when we were young
Back when we were young
When we were young
Back when we were youngshattered pieces, fragments of a broken heart. i gave you everything, all that i could, time and time again. constant memories of everything we had. these tears always bring me back. why does it have to be this way, why can't we share this love? why do i still love you? i can't hide these scars on my wrists. why do i still love you? i can't hide the blood on my hands. your reflection torn forever from my memory, my last breath as sweet as the first kiss. i can't swallow the lie, i love you, to choke again.Now truly I am king of the world
Master of fate
Damned shall thy house be
Thou shall not question my power
Nor shall thou defy me furtherWhere it all had meaning
Where we fell in love for the first time
It erupts in nights like this, tangled in the simplicity of...
Some far off distant evening with hearts filled to the brim
With good intentions and the sweetest of tragedy
I hope you hear me coming, I hope you turn your head
Arms spread wide like Jesus, without the heart or purpose
Or mouthful of easy answers, headlong we pace into the killing fields
Born of fevers and the brooding night sweats and the war about to be waged
Stop crying, just give me the keys
I hope you hear me coming, I hope you turn your head
Stop crying, just give me the fucking keys...
Headlong into the killing fields...
These days I am becoming bulletproof
The bells are ringing, it's the end of the line
I'm becoming your fears,
I'm becoming every broken heart
I hope you hear me coming, I hope you turn your headThis touch of a lasting life
Awaits an impiety of pain
A life taken into its own hands
Falls on countless journeys
Can you feel the fallen ages?
This timeless slumber from cold
These frail fingers to untouch a life
This new mold
At long lasting emptiness
In sunken warmth
Fused into one being
For all eternity
Tasting a bitter delight
For this last transgression of praise
The winds are blown from an opposite plane
To conjure the eternal flame
As I drown in the poisoned river
Breathing a last breath in escape
Visualize a lost approach
To the beginning of a new man
This kiss of the accursed
On virgin lips
The dirty angel
Of all utmost sympathy, praised
Smoldering in forgotten
A cursed stone thrown
At those awaiting this judgment
View and isolate
Its unwanted display of power
Swallowing these sin submerged cities
With oceans of fire
To escape in legend
Will be unforgiven by all of man
Engravings of a sunken race to return to land
Uncovered city beneath the sands
Mighty fortresses covering the plains of crossroads
A smell of screams burn through the air
Grains of salt covering these grains of sand
Sharp were the thorns of this false kings fall
As I stand upon the mountain
Staring into the blackness
Seize of darkness, seize of hatred
Seize of evil
I fear not for my life
For I am one with death
A passage through sorrow
To taste winters breath
All the false images that lead the youth to damnation
These lost years have been written by an ancient divine will
Misfortunes of the world a trait to be engulfed with sin
Holding the hands of unvirtue
Entwined blackness burns a creation to ash
An ungodliness that devours itself, whole
Manifest this chaos of the arts
Terror in the minds eye
A sick sea where brothers slay brothers
Stare within this foretold divine decreeThis nightmare haunts the inside of your eyes,
Whether in sleep, or wide awake, or somewhere that lies between.
A woman's silhouette, perfect in every way, now thrown into darkest regret.
And as she begins to fade, you hear a voice that pierces the dark:
'You never came for me.'
Ive always been alone in love.
An 'IOU' note signed by love herself.
Id never doubted, tomorrow will be the day when every mans hero will be mine.
Tomorrow never came.
This promise Ive held onto for so long,
But tonight Ill hold a lie, and my love will never be the same.
My head screams at me,
'End this fairy tale,' 'love will not be found,'
'open up your eyes and see you've only loved a lie."
I killed the perfect lover.
I buried her inside my heart.
In the blink of an eye, like the shot of a gun,
Ive become the loneliest boy ever.
Faithless, dishonest, impatient and a whore,
Is it tomorrow yet?The fire in our eyes still burns
Longer than this tasteless planet turns
We've been fightin' on the darker side
The keeper of darkness is our guide
The end is near no you can pray
Dead men tell no fuckin' tales
Death and destruction but we'll stay
The poor believing mankind fails
Our evil plead prepared their meal really well
The fast food society right now can't tell
The suicide solution to escape our might
Won't help your soul to get out of sight
The end is near so you can pray
All hell breaks loose
You've got no choice
Cause you're just Satan's toys
All hell breaks loose
You've got no choice
Cause you follow his voice
With open arms we wait for those,
Who didn't choose to pray and pose
The legions of black will scream out their hails
The principle of all religions fails
You've fallen in missgrace,
You've been praying since you've been told
The deal with god is to believe to get old
You've been kneeling, hoping and begging for relief
Now your life will steal away like a thief
But on your soul are black marks and it fakes,
We got you on our side, you made too many mistakes,
You've suffered all your life to be a good guy
A big fucking lie, burn in hell!Actions make history
And we can play our part
There is nothing to lose now
Let the heavens free
Risk
Risk it
Over the borders (risiko!)
Against the rules (risiko!)
Play with fire (risiko!)
And life will be a daring adventure
Lauf!
Many actions
Many questions
Much can happen still
New strivings, new beginnings
Life must go on stillA wang, dang, dang and a double fang, put you six feet underground. Flush all the fashion and your old school passion, our world
lives underground. Living for the money, so dead fuckin' funny, with your three piece suit and your wife that calls you honey.
You're raw meat, now ain't that sweet? Our world lives underground, SHUT THE FUCK UP, SPEAK WHEN YOU'RE SPOKEN TO! You're
my bitch, now do what you're told to do. SHUT THE FUCK UP, SPEAK WHEN YOU'RE SPOKEN TO! Get down on your knees and
thank me. Vampire folklore old stone age, hypodermic wet dream narcotic stage, an undead anthem to the blackest days, a tribute
to the original. SHUT THE FUCK UP, SPEAK WHEN YOU'RE SPOKEN TO! You're my bitch now do what you're told to do. SHUT THE
FUCK UP, SPEAK WHEN YOU'RE SPOKEN TO! Get down on your knees and thank me. SHUT THE FUCK UP, SPEAK WHEN YOU'RE
SPOKEN TO! You're my bitch, now do what you're told to do. SHUT THE FUCK UP, SPEAK WHEN YOU'RE SPOKEN TO! Get down, lick
my boot and thank me. I was taken on a Tuesday night, a summer's night, around midnight. Blood flows silently to candlelight, yet
I re-animate in shadows. Purveyor of the horror, tormentor in techicolor, governor to the terror but still I'm trapped in limbo."An Ancient Inherited Shame"
by Dark Angel
Femininity, a sacred life
My goals and dreams achieved, or soon they might
Unintruded being, innocent
Young, with a hopeful future to be spent
I can't believe my idiocy
You came along with your invasion
Your act of violence not of lust
Upon me...
Racing through these darkened streets at night
Fleeing from this terror that haunts me
I am chosen, this can't be right
The pain that your thrust brings
(chorus)
I don't want your flesh
I'm not your whore
But you want my blood
I'm not a whore
Trapped down here inside
A nightmare that's become reality
A heinous violation
Of my humanity
Right before my eyes I see my world
Fractured so precise by one so cold
Through your veins run ice, I beg of thee
As I lie paralyzed please let me be
From within your sould I stare
I don't think I'll live to see this end
You'll reign eternally through my nightmares
If I ever sleep again
The hatred directed at me 'cause of what I am
Is chilling as the defilement itself
I wonder, what kind of beast is man?
What emotions are and not felt?
I don't want your flesh
I'm not your whore
But you want my blood
I'm not a whore
I can't even comprehend
Why this act has come to be
Proven time and time again
The ultimate sadistic release
(bridge)
This violent form of incarceration
Trapped by savagery, helpless I lie
I refuse this indoctrination
Though you shatter this inner sanctum of mine
An ancient inherited shame
Bonding women and horror
Outlasting the boundaries of time
Enslaved forevermore
Inherent crimes
Through generations has become
A terror cycle....
You can't see me but you feel me
You only want what you don't understand
You can't have me so you take me
Forever scarred where you've stamped your brand
You look in my eyes and you tell me
What do you see?
Of this I'm deserving?
You can't see me but you feel me
You only want what you don't understhand
You can't have me so you take me
Forever scarred where you've stamped your brand
You need to crush me with your lividity
Does this make you feel more like a man
You can't have me, so you rape me
My innocence strangled by your hand
This must be necrophilia, for I am dead inside
Your violent misogyny, your strength drowns my cries
In shock, I'm crippled with disbelief
This can't be happening to me
Oh god, this hurts, I'm bleeding from friction
"Unconcious" I'm pleading to be
You cannot imagine the anger I feel
Nor can you imagine the pain and despair
This double jeopardy soon happens again
When they scrape me for semen and hair
My mind is frozen with your face intact
This atrocity from which I haven't been spared
From now on, I'll only know lovemaking through
An act of intense terror
The malevolence which purs over me
You fill me with your rage
IT's mortifying, diabolical,
Controlling through this stage
I struggle to cope with what's happening
I'm praying for my death
I've done nothing wrong, I've been victimized
So I'll pray for yours instead
The physical torment inflicted upon me
Is insufferable but it doesn't compare
To your terrible criminal mentality
And the scars I'll forever bear
To live through this brutal show of force
Will cause me years of torment and grief
Awaiting this misery to run its course
As I scream out innocent pleas
(repeat bridge)
This violent form of incarceration
Trapped by savagery, helpless I lie
I refuse this indoctrination
Though you shatter this inner sanctum of mine
An ancient inherited shame
Bonding women and horror
Out;lasting the boundaries of time
Enslaved forevermore
I will force myself to carry on
And vengeance will be ultimately mine
If you are not imprisoned soon
By my hands you will die...
(chorus)
I don't what your flesh
I'm not your whore
But you wnat my blood
I'm not a whore
Though rape you've created me
A victim not above revenge
A churning, seething mass of hate
But you haven't conquered my soul[Target locked, await supreme fear]
[Lyrics: J. Jansson]
Serpent whispers beyond the sun
Nocturnal gates - devours the light
Synchronic vortex above the stars
Twisted forms - out of sight
Black holes surrounds the human race
We're connected and forlorn
Beyond deep astral stars
We're sworn into this world
When the shadows falls like curtains in the skies
Supersonic thrills bursts under our skin
When the curtains falls like velvet silver rain
We're swallowed into: Target dimension XII
We are connected - We are rejected
Unforeseen spheres take control
We're out in space and transformed
Giant vapours spins in circles
We're in the system of supreme fear
When the shadows falls like curtains in the skies
Supersonic thrills bursts under our skin
When the curtains falls like velvet silver rain
We're swallowed into: Target dimension XII
We're forced into this new dimension
Leaving mother earth behind
Subdivided planet eruption
Our synthetic existence denied
We are doomed...
Black holes surrounds the human race
We're connected and forlorn
Beyond deep astral stars
We're sworn into this world
When the shadows falls like curtains in the skies
Supersonic thrills bursts under our skin
When the curtains falls like velvet silver rain
We're swallowed into: Target dimension XIIOut of chaos etched inside
New way of thinking state of sublime
Renewal, redemption this life is yours to form
Revalue, and question abhor the common norms
New mind, new life
Break away from standard thinking step outside the common norms
Break down deconstruct what's on the inside
Redesign what you dislike
Fall down when you reach the lowest point
You see the world through different eyes
Erase your old life redeem your soul
Come undone just let it grow
Don't waste it, consume it, convert reality
Give a life a facelift to fit your needs
New mind, new life
Break away from standard thinking step outside the common norms
Break down deconstruct what's on the inside
Redesign what you dislike
Fall down when you reach the lowest point
You see the world through different eyes
This is the way it feels
Not what it used to be
Abhor common norms
Life's yours to formHere's a dedication
To the men and women who've served in Vietnam
From our generation to you and your family...
Respect is long overdue
Memories of blood, red, white, blue
Orange skies at night, southeast Asia knew
You were called to serve and you did it well
For us you've made a round-trip through hell
Wars within wars, within wars
To survive you made your own laws
Every day and night to stay alive
You kept your head down and your powder dry
Memories of families
It's God i've known
Take me home
Now you live asking God why
He didn't take you when your brothers all died
Explosions shake the dreams in your head at night in bed
Don't wake him up or you'll end up dead
Try to understand his pain
He still sees blood stains that remain
In his heart and mind, try to numb the pain
People think they understand
Sat watching TV back on quiet land
They spit on you now we'll spit back for you
Our hearts, our voice, gift of our hands
What can they do for you and those who served
And died, we pay respect to the families
Who still cry
Your kids are now full grown
With the love and pride you should have known
Back when your country brought you home
Still now you fight the tears and face your fears each day
But the horrors of fact won't go away
For 2300 MIA's or POW's to this day
We remember and pray for youEyes full of hate, quick to condemn
Just stay in the dark and wait for an end
You don't really care, it's jut give and take
Keeping the distance, keeping it fake
Waiting for something that doesn't quite jell
Just cursing existence and hating your hell
Blinded by anger you don't really know
It's play by play as you put on a show
Your making your stand for nothing at all
Delighted with problems, a chance for a fall
Causing a scene to distribute the pain
It's all for one, such a nice little game
Your time flies by with nothing gained
Just talk of change and who's to blame
It's the same old story we know so well
With a premade ending you don't want to tellNight surrounds me,
As I sit alone,
In the indecipherable darkness.
I smell the noise of past.
Vivacity of the wind begets clear my mind.
In eternal isolation.
Those that pretend to care,kill you,
And leave you for being dead.
I seek,for where am I?
The throes of death swirl within me,
And I smile.....
Life,raped by disease.
Cast out.
No place for me here.
I create my kingdom.
Creation through destruction,
Cut out the heart of the Christian disease.
Knowledge my fortune,
I channel the strength of my will.
The lure of the moonlight,
Streams forth,with abundance of strength.
I bask in it's essence,
Devouring the force,
Succouring my veins.
I traverse to the beckon of my desire.
Destruction.
This stagnant humanity serves only to frustrate.
Unfit to stand alone,huddled in their masses,
Synonymous in their worthless existence.
The time will come to pass.
Creation of life,
Destruction of the disease.
[Lyrics-Greg,1995]
[Music-Greg,1995]I'm running away
Cause there's no place for me here
There's no memory
Time doesn't exist...
I'm running away
Cause the source of my cry ends
My bleeding heart
Has to find eternity
Hidden among the stars
My dying star
Forgive me weakness
My dying star
Forgive me my sin
I'm running away
Cause there aren't your eyes
There's no memory
Time doesn't exist...
I'm running away
Cause the path of my life ends
There aren't your kisses anymore
There aren't your words anymore
Among the stars I shall find your smell...
My dying star
Let me find myself
My dying star
Let me kiss immortality...
I'm beside you
I'm waiting...
i'm beside you
Eternity lets me find you
I'm still waiting...Shout and shout!

Hikari tomoshi tsudzukete fumidaseI'm walking over the plains
Alone with my sorrow
I want to bury it where you lie
My imprisoned sun, caught in stone
Now my friend the moon
Covers the earth with hies green coat
I can only see one side of you
Where is the other one?
Every time I run around this rock
I realise that you're only an image
A painting with a false gleam
My imprisoned sun, caught in stone
I asked the one who sits next to you
But he's got no mouth, only an eye
That is staring on me hopefully
I thinks this man, he is crying bloodStab the knife into the face and then wrench the blade inside
Murder this piece of shit
Scraps of flesh and severed bone are on the floor, these I must hide
Pounding the teeth
Commute bones
They never will know
Chop up the corpse
Congealing my crime
They never will find
Evidence
In the furnace
Secret cremation
You fucked with me and now any trace of you is completely gone
Charring the flesh
The body is ash
They never will know
Burning the corpse
Consumed by the flames
They never will find
Evidence
In the furnace
You cease to exist
Investigations fail to find a single useful clue
Their search is futile
Proof is destroyed in the searing heat, you melt away
No body case
There is no trace
Smoldering coals that once were your bones turn to ash
Your life is erased
There is no trace
You cease to exist but the search will go on, they cannot find
Their closure denied
Dead or alive
You're not the first and you won't be the last
To burn in my fires
Corpses will burn
Burn in my fires
Your corpse will burn
Charring the flesh
The body is ash
They never will know
Burning the corpse
Consumed by the flames
They never will find
Evidence
In the furnaceExtiendeme una mano por favor
Caigo en picado otra vez
Mis alas he perdido no puedo volar
No quise ir con mi destino
Perdoname una vez mas
Yo me alejaba tu tenias razón
Sin saber nunca el porque
Loco y sin compasión te despreciaba
Se que no se puede olvidar
Perdoname una vez mas
ESPERARÉ A QUE EL SOL VUELVA A BRILLAR
Y ENTONCES CANTARÉ
NUNCA MAS QUERRÉ OLVIDAR
Es largo el camino que hay por recorrer
El miedo esta presente ya lo se
Aprovechemos la nueva oportunidad
Seamos ajenos a la humanidad
Perdoname una vez másOne man fights to keep his pockets fat. Another is fighting just to pay his bills. Some go to doctors for the vanity, others can't even afford their pills. The distance between us grows. Just how numb have we become? Look how far we've grown....apart. Some show their love for the land by stopping and asking "Why?" Others show support for a war by sending their sons off to die. The distance between us grows. Just how numb have we become? What have we become? Look how far we've grown...apart. Now I won't talk to you and you won't talk to me. And I might look away, but you will never see the distance between-race, religion, class, education, sexual orientation, political affiliation. We'll never see eye to eye. this distance will keep on growing and growing and growing....I saw it again
The wind walking on water
Touching the waves with his feet
Never sinking - always sliding
I heard him again
Whispering your name
Raindrops ruin your hair
Curly as it is - how sadHere I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
the skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
i've made my bed so i'll lie in it. i've dug my grave so i'll die in it.
tell all my friends i said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
i cant go on like this (x2)
just like the living dead, i've got a taste for something.
and i dont want it, i just need it,
and i cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
its getting harder just to feel alive.
curtains close- take a bow. i think we fooled all of them now.
who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
i've made my bed so i'll lie in it. i've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
just like the living dead, i've got a taste for something.
and i dont want it, i just need it, and i cant believe that (x2)
and i dug my grave, so ill lie in it. ive made my bed so ill die in it, die in it. and i dug my grave, and i dug my grave.
I'D RATHER LIVE, THAN LIVE FOREVER!
im knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
its either now or fucking never.
and that night, we meant every word we said. all i can say...
all i can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
all i can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
just like the living dead
just like the living dead
just like the living dead, ive got a taste for something,
i dont want it, i just need it, and i cant believe that.
just like the living dead, i've got a taste for something.
and i dont want it, i just need it,
and i cant believe that (x2)
its getting harder just to feel alive,
its getting harder just to feel alive.Up there on the mountain, above all fire,
the fields down there and the ravine below
Where the elements feast in reckless desire
A raven is seated
Where the sun cannot reach,
only teriffic storms prevail
In a thunderin' havoc they ruthlessly roar
My heart it beats the pulse of ancient times
The countless rythem, the rattling stones
My weapon cleanse the filth of all bones
Tender are the havens
wich remain on the open plains
The shadow crawls
upon the resort of the remnaints
Even toward the hills lie shattered shields
The winter it hunts all their hearts in fear
And the river drifts with the resolution of thunder
Infernal are the storms in wich our shelter stand
Their strongest grip of fear, and our shelter tear
Up there on the mountain, above all fire,
the fields down there and the ravine below
He beholds a kingdom of grace, savage yet fairyou, a concept.
you, a beautiful idea.
phosphorous oxidize skeletal.
moths to the light. blind.
drowned in pheromones.
those servants of God
Process repeat Sunspots. repeat.
you. a flickering light.
Stillborn child born dead.
stillborn. stillborn. stillborn...Step back, look forward
There's nothing for us here
Our lives have been wasted
Cowering in fear
Violence, hate, pride
Hunger, greed, spite
We thought we were invincible
The end isn't near, the end is here
We thought we were unbreakable
To save us, we must end us
We must end us
We must die
Ruled by monsters with no faces
Living life with no name
We are forgotten, we are abandoned
The darkness is our home
We are forgotten, we are abandoned
Hell has come for us
We thought we were invincible
The end isn't near, the end is here
We thought we were unbreakable
To save us, we must end us
We thought we were invincible
We thought we were unbreakable
To save us, we must end us
The demons rip into my chest
Extracting a disease, we spent years trying to suppress
Constricting veins, bloodshot eyes
Hell has come to claim its prize
There's no way out
No way out
Nothing can stop the storm that's destined to wipe away the stains
Leaving nothing behind but life, death and unending pain
There's no way out
When you're born to diePlease tell me if they are true
The tales and the legends we're told
Happened in ancient times
We don't know where they belong
Tales of creatures unknown
Of things we don't see are they lies?
Before the dawn of time - when legends all were born
Before the dawn of time - awaiting the first breath
Before the dawn of time - is there anything we've lost
Before the dawn of time - are we allowed to judge the past
While we're searching for proves
All mankind will come to an end
Can't we learn from our mind
When fantasy takes command
Do we have to decide
What's good and what's insanity?
Can we tell for sure
That nothing exists we don't see
Do we know all the powers
That are between heaven and earth
We've now found the one true explanation
That's killing the creedI'm standing at the coast
and I listen to the waves
I'm searching for a place
to anchor my heart
But the water is too deep
to find You
I'm drifting away
washed to the shore
Sand in my eyes
I can't find You
I'm searching stone for stone
I'm diving blue for blue
I'm diving deep in You
but I can't find You
Waters wash my soul
I listen to the waves
telling stories far from home
They live and breathe and break
they're washing clear my soulGo!
Tell me your misery
Give us the antidote
I heard the voice of change
Behind a vacant note
All this tearing apart
Without a reform
Call it what you will
I'm not afraid to say
I've heard it all, connection lost
We're standing by, artificial light
You sell a fix for our defect
And all we find, artificial light
Doesn't break the model
I can't feel it in my bones
Nothing shattering my world (No!)
We want a real cure
Not idle sympathy
The dark consuming light
That you have failed to be
No, it's not enough
I resent this deprivation
Your remedy is not a weapon
To slaughter the sorrow
It's just to keep you from feeling alone
I've heard it all, connection lost
We're standing by, artificial light
You sell a fix for our defect
And all we find, artificial light
Doesn't break the model
I can't feel it in my bones
Nothing shattering my world (No!)
Doesn't break the model
I can't feel it in my bones
Nothing shattering my world (No!)
I'll never see what they see in you
Doesn't break the model
I can't feel it in my bones
Nothing shattering my world (No!)
Doesn't break the model
I can't feel it in my bones
Nothing shattering my world (No!)Burn your bridges, bite your tongue
Dig your own grave what's done is done
What's in your head what's on your mind
Time will tell don't look behind
What I keep inside my head is stuck right on my mind
And time will tell if I should look behind
Hold your head up, hold your head up high
Hold your head up, hold your head up high
Hold your head up, hold your head up high
Hold your head up, put up or shut up
Two steps forward and one step back
The time will come when you lose track
Speak your mind or sell your soul
Stand tall or fall down in a hole
I've got to speak my mind before I sell my soul
I've got to stand for what I am before I fall
[Chorus]
It's to late I guess what's done is done
I'd rather dig myself a grave than bite my tongue
So I take two steps forward and then one step back
I'm not afraid of losing faith I'm scared of losing track
[Chorus]Holding on to the past, while the future slips you by
The past, like the present, is just another lie
This is the only chance we will ever get
So make the most of it, live live with no regrets
Live life while you can, or life will pass you by
If you've already given in, then you've already died
You've already died
No turning back
No giving inThis sword of steel that I hold in my hand
Ore of this mountain. A sword of this land.
Made for a king when the elders were young.
To guard us and to guide us in an age since long gone.
A sword to protect the peace in troubled times.
A sword made to battle and to take a life.
This sword is the backbone of the life that I know.
Here among the mountains and snow.
This sword will be one with me. Body and soul.
All of me will be delivering each blow.
Slung on my back. Oh it's powers I feel.
I can hardly wait to try it's steel.
A sword to protect the peace in troubled times.
A sword made to battle and to take a life.
This sword is the backbone of the life that I know.
Here among the mountains and snow.
Behold it's sharp beauty. Just look at it's shine.
This sword was forged in fire and ice.
This sword is the backbone of the life that I know.
Here among the mountains and snow.
Now I am ready
To let this old sword sing again.
Atop a snow covered hill
Just before sunset
["Waiting atop a snow covered hill, the two standing silent, facing the]
[sunset in the west. The one eyed old man mumbling strange words into the
[cold air. The haze spreading fast across the purple and blue vault. The
[winds taking up speed, bending the trees down the valley, throwing the snow
[crystals up and against the mountainside into gigantic sparkling clouds
[high in the sky. The voice of the one eyed old man becoming stronger. The
[words now spoken with increased intensity as if he was calling someone or
[something. And so a hazy white figure appears on the horizon, blazing
[across the sky with the speed of the winds... a part of the wind. A horse
[as white as snow, galloping across the mist, its eight hooves blistering
[like bolts of lightning. The one eyed old man crying out loud in the blaze
[to him, to take its reins and not to let go.
[And thus he had been given The Stallion..."]All religion based on fear
The bible is not true
No fear at all, no sin
The illusion do not need
Every moment is the last
To be dead for next time
Love the death as the life
Constantness is the right
Love the Death as the Life
Many masters came, mostly they were slain
Every form is different, separated one
Love to be in joy, beginnig in end
Don't believe in parents, parents of the parents
Body-spirit-soul, even to know more...Kak vo temnuju noch'
Vyshel paren' v les pobrodit'

Brass knuckles and a willing fist
A big knife and a little scream
They do wonders for my self-esteem
Warm blood and a cold embrace
The catch is better than the chase
They all ask why I'm doing this
Violence is bliss
What you see
All I know to be
Is a madman out on a killing spree
One thing I say
I did it all my way
Gave rise to the dawn of the dying age
When I feel the urge
And it's tarting to surge
Soon I'm blowing like an atom bomb
When you comprehend
Your life's coming to an end
I'm going, going, going, going, gone
Two things that I can't ignore
Dark nights and an unlocked door
I get the feeling and I follow through
I get high like I'm sniffing glue
It's time to let the games commence
This really helps my self-confidence
Blood orgy for the hedonist
Violence is bliss
What you see
All I know to be
Is a madman out on a killing spree
One thing I say
I did it all my way
Gave rise to the dawn of the dying age
When I feel the urge
And it's tarting to surge
Soon I'm blowing like an atom bomb
When you comprehend
Your life's coming to an end
I'm going, going, going, going, gone[This is a cool song, too bad it's only 3:23 and an instrumental. But it]
[starts off with a very black metal touch and then go back into the vein of]
[Dictius - SUiZID era of muscianship.]The coldness has blown, Tallis felt the flames
She apart aside leaves to the other side
She beheld a lying warrior
The birds were gathering around
Stone faces had to shelter him
She had to stop all the birds
Chorus: Shadows covered mountains, everything turned gray
The rain smelt in the wind and in the air
The dying one has called her name
He kept a scrap of her shirt in his hands
I failed to save your life!!!
Don't leave me alone...
Don't leave me alone!!!
Tallis - the One so far away from home
Her heart breaks and the love turns down
Through cortex of the tree in crystal tears of her eyes
And the fire cracks in the winter air under the twilight skies
Her sorrow lament sounds
Like the cry of morning birds
Banned from that winter land
From the Land of the Bird's Spirit
The fire burns in the Land of the Bird's Spirit
In the land where my love is lying dead
The storm rages in the Land of the Bird's Spirit
I will scatter ravens all around the Land
I will tend over the tender earth
In which my love is lying dead
Dead !!!
Lonely in death !!!
The circle - Lavondyss
It smokes out of my bones...!Psychological warfare
Still bear the scars from a past war ceased
Neurological nightmare
Torture suffered holds the mind from peace
Can't face reality unrestrained mentality
Hiding from the darkness of your insanity
Driven to soul despairs madness in your mind tears
No escape from this mental insanity
Captive life, held in past
Deranged memories still burning in your brain
Thoughts of pain, darkest dreams
Self-inflicted torture, eating at your mind
Punishment, no pain release
Captive to the darkness
Of this psychotic insanityWe've waited with patience
For acceptance
Into your lame-o stations
You've left us no choice
Because you won't let us
Voice our opinions
We've got to drown you out
Drown you out [2]
When commercial sponsors
Decide what we hear
Something's wrong
How much money would they lose
If they decided
To choose our song?
We've got to drown you out
Drown you out [2]Sometimes it's easy to believe
It's worth the pain sometimes
You wonder if your efforts were all in vain
You talk to shadows on the wall
You try so hard to understand
How all the little lies and lectures can contradict
You've lost the sense
Flow into your mind
Embracing like a mother's womb
Flow and you will find
Forgotten pictures of the moon
You think the world is all dependent on your good will
And you believe there's always someone right behind you
To pay the bill
A pretty face is not enough to conquer anything at all
A money mountain couldn't save you
You slide your back against the wall
Flow into your mind embracing like a mother's womb
Flow and you will find forgotten pictures of the moon
The pretty face you always trusted will turn around and speak to you
And you will realize too late
You're someone that you never knewIt flows the obscene, a living death machine
Repent the day, this world first met your wondering mind
Stay at one with tears, the dark is near
It calls to you, now reach out
Amazed, as the wind is full and the night is day
Resist, to the golden sun and the virgin air
Release, as nature's spell was cast on you
Defeat, as your haunted soul breaks its shell
Bringing out the plead of instant death
Take your life, cross the line, don't be scared
Come to us
Below a wordly forest and beneath an awful sky
An always moving madness, creeps onward with the tide
A killer long and lasting, that washes all its sins
A silent shocking something, that draws us ever in
The creek of the dead, the creek of the waiting dead!!!
The sun shines on your worldless tomb
As life permits your soul to die
The creek it bathes, while nature blooms
With blood that flows, to bring new life
The life you gave is nothing now
While death reveals a sign of joy
The creek of the dead!!!See another morning outside when it cries
Makes us feel that we're still alive
Clouds reveal any reason to hide and to find freshing morning outside
The Sun goes up
And my heart beats faster again
I've got to seek for warning
That every morning can be last
I'm on the way of calling
Back the days of my past
I've got to seek for warning
That every morning can be last
Mornings of my past
Life turned out to be so easy to start
Make it easy to end
When the new day means to be real
In the end I look for the morning outside
The Sun goes up
And my heart beats faster again
I've got to seek for warning
That every morning can be last
I'm on the way of calling
Back the days of my past
I've got to seek for warning
That every morning can be last
Mornings of my past...The names have been changed to protect the innocent. This is poison. Manufactured for the general well being of the community. You can kill what you can't see. What can't be seen can't possibly exist. Life uninterrupted, undecided, unanticipated. Manufactured for the general well being of the community. You can't kill what you can't see. What can't be seen can't possibly exist. You call this worldwide destruction? I call it a mediocre excuse to force-feed pollution as the problem. Colonize, monopolize, and destroy. Compared to actual existence, this is child's play. Screaming for an answer you're never going to get. This is poison, this is battery acid. Lies, lies, lies..In the sky - where my words are written
I want to read - I want to write
Poems for you - where noone can read them
Songs for you - that noone can hear
Beneath the sun - where the earth is burning
I want to be - I want to die
For you my dear - where our love is glowing
Under the sky - where my thoughts are livingHere's my song about gun control
As my politics begin to roll
Things are getting out of control
It's time to stop, drop and rock 'n' roll
We built and sold them the guns
Made in America
Glued to the tube TV before Dallas 1963
It was assumed baby boomers
Bloomed doomed to ruin the country
But who knew the children of Normandy
Soon would resume war with Vietnamese
Overseas, we sent 18 year-olds to bleed
Face it, like Oswald woke the nation
Osama woke my generation
Now the kids of Nintendo
If drafted will attend the
Bush administration family agenda
Of bending back hands and sending children
Attacking Iraqi lands and buildings
So Cheney can rebuild for 200 billion
They'll disarm the regime but not the children
We built and sold them the guns
Made in America
Sacrificing our kids lives for global crisis
While fools of the NRA
Watch kids shoot kids in high schools
With tools they say kill deer
Not fill pools of blood
And guts, and tears, and the love and trust
We lent to the government
That's here to protect not just guns but us
Don't place blame on video games
Marilyn Manson or NWA
How can we blame them for the situation?
When an Alzheimer's patient
Leads the Nation Rifle Association
We built and sold them the guns
Made in America
I'm a Reagan Baby
My formative years are the 1980s
Russian production and reduction
Of weapons of mass destruction
Happened already
Even the Cuban missile crisis
Had pictures of bombs throughout the island
To sway bias
And now we hide behind bombs
Dropped on innocent moms
Ignoring gun control and dropping stocks
Senate majority leaders opposing '57 Little Rock
While we annihilate North Korea, Iran and Iraq
If the government shoots first
To stimulate commerce
Things are only going to get worse
If the government shoots first
We built and sold them the guns
Made in America
We sold them the same guns
That are now facing back towards us
And what do we do?
We go over there
But until we view here and there as the same place
We will always be fighting another religion, another race
There are peaceful solutions
There are peaceful resolutions
PeaceWrath, hate, pain and death
Is the code we live by
It's in our souls
Metal is the way
We fight the world
With glowing metal
Now the false will pay
Our fight has just begun
We're sent from hall of gold
Messengers of death
We're coming after you
You can't escape us
We'll take away your breath
See us ride for vengeance
Friends of the suncross
We are born of steel
See us riding down
The Amon Amarth
The last sight you'll ever see
So as you stand there
Under gray clouded skies
Abandoned by your God
You know you're gonna die
You feel a sorrow surrounding you
As of the nine worlds
Screaming pain you feel
Your soul vaporizes as your hearts burst
We charge without fear
Your time has come
Your Fimbul winter's arrived
A chilling wind of ice
Whirls through your heart
Pierces your bones and spine
We are all
Gazing to the skies
We'll make the false hammer fall
And we'll make Thor arise
Our quest is done
Your creation burns
Now we return to Oden's hall
Our dragon's fly
Across the waves
As twilight begins to fall
In victory we ride
We enter the mighty doors
Of the spear-Gods hall
As Ygg salutes us
We raise our beers
And drink in honor of our cause
We are all
Greeted by the Gods
We made the false hammer fall
And Thor arose in blood
In bloodI scream into your face
I scream into your face until
My veins are bursting through
Prisoners now live with no excuse
Its goes
I won't leave I can take control
Control
But it won't stop cause I have no control
I have no control
It comes down, don't take my name
Its holds it holds
It holds me down
I stared into your eyes
I stared into your eyes until
The tears start to fall
With a sound to which can't ignore
Its goes
I won't leave I can take control
Control
But it won't stop cause I have no control
I have no control
It comes down, don't take my name
Its holds it holds
It holds me down
It comes down, don't take my name
Its holds it hold me down
You see your way its the only way to be
You see your way its the only way to be
The only way to be!
It comes down, don't take my name
Its holds it hold me down
It comes down, don't take my name
Its holds it hold me down
I have no control
I have no control
Oh![M: Beretta, Ceretti/L: Beretta]
[Artan:]
Take a look in my soul tonight: it's an empty space you'll find
Finally now I understand the last words Oracle said
[Bridge:]
What's the meaning of it all?
Why to find a brother lost
Just to lose him once again?
[Chorus:]
Tell me why I have to pay such a price for victory?
In the night along with Slayn, it has died a part of me
In the end he sacrificed everything to be redeemed
And I'm standing here alone, lonely, as I've never been
Is it all just a cruel joke? Are we all destiny's pawns?
Victory has a bitter taste... losing more than you have gained
[Bridge:]
Many questions in my mind,
But I just can't see the light
Maybe I will never do...
[Chorus]
[King Randall:]
Now it's time to stop the pain
For his death was not in vain
Even for a time so short
You've been with him after all
And to save us it was
His brotherly loveYou're running into tragedy
signs announcing danger
for your life
will end in agony
and your bodies will decay to dust
Dust you are created of
and eternal laws can never change
change in our universe
dust to dust decays
You'll roast in flames
with the soals fo no name
your bones burste under mountains of bones
A voice from somewhere
is calling your name
when you're in league with the gods
Pray
Or to dust you will decay
pay attention to my warning
Pray
Or to dust you will decay
on a painfull morning
To dust you will decay
Everything that you achieved
all you tried has been in vain
you're treated with indignity
somewhere in a nowhere you will fight
for the right to survive
don't blasphemise the holy signs
who will you be
in the judgment of gods
after the night when you'll die
who will you be
in the judgment of gods
after the night when you'll die
Pray
Or to dust you will decay
pay attention to my warning
Pray
Or to dust you will decay
on a painfull morning
To dust you will decay
you will decayBlood, sweat and more blood
Love turned to hate
Light turned to dark
And life turned to death
Blood!
The old engine is still running
Cleansing!
The cleansing of the body and soul
(Then) reach out and touch the branches
The branches of the oldest oak
In these last autumn days
When dim colours are over whelming
And grim
Cold hills darken
Frost is setting in
Discover something old
Discover something newI can't deny that I want to see
Through your soul
Through severity
But I'm afraid of knowing what kind of sight
What kind of message I will find
My crusade is doomed to fail
But I still carry on
Like father like son
I'm frozen inside
I know that I can get lost in this left hand side of the path
As you can see, my time is running short
In resisting the decaying of my soul
My crusade is doomed to fail
But I still carry on
Like father like son
I'm frozen inside
I'm beginnig to see
What my role will be
In this Tunnel of Pain[instrumental]I can't imagine any other way than simply saying why I really feel this way
it's mystifying in each and every sense so nothing ventured nothing new to gain
Slowly life keeps moving on before you know it's gone
the chance to say what's on your mind
My lips are drying up because of guilt
no point in crying once the blood is spilt
no good denying what is wrong or right
time has a way of healing everything in sight
Don't forsake the broken hearted wishful thoughts and proud ideals
finish what you've already started and one day you'll blessed with the
power to reach the ones you trustSatisfaction is the seed of hunger
Beginning of the circle is its end
There's no centre-emptiness in between
And perfection is not always in the midst
Living for a moment? Being a spark
And there's no light but flame
Middle state leading to boundlessness
War is the order of this world
Harmony of the earth is always and never
Everlasting order is illusion and deceit
War is mother, fight is harmony
We're burned to burn
Word is nothing without silence
What is your god without infinity of zero:
Father destroy to create
Father burn to be forever
Father fade to burn again
Father don't be but changeScream as your arteries implode
Darkness
Consiousness is floating away
Lifeless
They clear out your body
Putrefy
Replace the vital organs
Skinrip - the scalpel slices throgh your flesh
Bonegrip - they reconstruct your body
Fleshdrip - transplantating organs
Mindslip - your brain ails away
Scream as your arteries implode
Darkness
Consiousness is floating away
Lifeless
They clear out your body
Putrefy
Replace the vital organs
Skinrip - the scalpel slices throgh your flesh
Bonegrip - they reconstruct your body
Fleshdrip - transplantating organs
Mindslip - your brain ails awayDe nuevo vi caer la sombra de tu ser,
de nuevo al observarte vi que no debias temer
al ver tu cuerpo condenado
al ver la vida desde otro lado
yo te recordare como siempre
el muchacho aquel.
Vendiste tu propia vida
vida que andaba vacia
y se que nunca me entere
y ahora si ahi hay alguien
donde estes que te abrace
y seas lo que aqui quisiste ser.
No quiso contar su triste final
el que ellos nunca comprenderan
el salto que llegaste a dar
de la vida a la eternidad
sombras del dolor
amor ciego
y triste pasion.
Vendiste tu propia vida
vida que andaba vacia
y se que nunca me entere
y ahora si ahi hay alguien
donde estes que te abrace
y seas lo que aqui quisiste ser.
...y se que nunca podre entender
amor por tal mujer.
En su interior no quiso escuchar
un sueno le envolvio
los ojos ciegos de un amor
enganaron su corazon
y ahi llego su perdicion...We think we die for our ideals,
We only die for business deals.
One,two,you march,
One,two,you die !!!
Oohohooho! Oohohooho!
Oh,noooooo... Right!
Nations say they don't want war,
Why do they build weapons for,
If it's not to even the score?
They want to increase their industries
Giving birth to new technologies
That will end people's life.
Their mouth is full of lies,
When they need you and I.
Their needs of power,
Will set the world in fire.
If we don't stand,we'll reach the end,
So understand,come on my friends...
When will they realize,
That all they do is wrong,
We'll refuse to hold their guns,
To satify their will,
It's justthe same old song,nooh...
For them it seems it's just a game
Every day their rules are more insane,
Leading us to pain.
They like to build and to destroy,
Treating us just as their toys,
They easily employ.
For them the agony,
Was just necessary !
They will make,the history,
Just repeat again.
If we don't stand,we'll lose our aim.
So understand,come on my friends...
Is there someone out there,
To stop this road to nowhere.
Do the power,change the wise men
In mercyless greedy men?
It's just the same old song...
Just the same,old !(six times)
It's just the same old song...
What will be left for children,
If war's an education ?
Will they be,hearthless prsons,
That just need a gun ?
Money is,just the name of,
The game they play so well,
They want us to stand,
For thair pure ideal,
But their Heaven is just Hell !
It's just the same old song...
(S.O.S)
The Same Old Song...(Lyrics by Nornagest)
Purest evil rise from the deepest grave,
all making a sign of faith towards the goatlord of darkness,
Pentagram emplies of evil, turning christians to insane.
five heads star inverted dedication to SATAN'S name.
When The Master dart from the star is down to Hell.
Commanders from Below join unholy forces to pretend a world's
domination wearing the symbol as you see it into the inverted sign.
The Face of Sathanas!!!
Almighty, MAGUS, leads the hordes to the master of sabbats.
LEONARDO, Goat of Mendez, lord of the black moon...
Under the shadow of thy tri-horned skull, we celebrate the dark
mass for SATAN our mind keeper,
"Bless us all, lord of lords, master of masters..."
On his skullthrone the goatlord vomit his evil benediction of lust
Forever in his name and soul we trust!
The departure of war is done, all our legions of doom, hate and
pain are gone to bring on earth an age of sin with the
encouragement of our sovereigns howling.
To the earthly village we fly.
To the flesh we rush, to their lord they cry in emptiness
Themselves thy dash!
(lead NORNAGEST)
Look the ridiculous guneflexion is makin'
Look our master their souls are taken floating in the halls of ACHERON.
They heard the vociferous cries, for now they are ready to deny
their god of lies, to join our straight, to fight the right
and the lord Jesus Christ...
On his skullthrone the goatlord vomit his evil benediction of lust
Forever in his name and soul we trust!
The departure of war is done, all our legions of doom, hate and
pain are gone to bring on earth an age of sin with the
encouragement of our sovereigns howling.
(lead NEBIROS)The lava kept on flowing
The islands was covered
The lava kept on flowing
An information river
My private kingdom smothered
An information river
Multimedia deceit
Coming down my street
I don't wanna be your trash can
I'm not a garbage truck
With endless space for junk
The lava kept on flowing
I don't have a nervous system
That's just a sewer system
An information river
Don't stain my close
With fuel from your hose
I don't wanna be your trash can
The TV news it flew
It crushed me in its wake
The lava kept on flowing
Telling all what's new
To listen was a mistake
An information river
The radio puked on me
How much can one man take
I don't wanna be your trash can
The lava kept on flowing
The islands was covered
The lava kept on flowing
An information river
My private kingdom smothered
An information river
Multimedia deceit
Coming down my street
I don't wanna be your trash canMy voice echoes. It fills the town
Searching for you, who can't be found
I close my eyes and sleep. I feel you again
I'm burning inside, my fever's rising high
Till the dawn does us apart
I want to find that place
Tell me which road leads me to you?
I only need a little sign
And I'll wander to find you
Until the end of time
Sun dries the tears I wept
Embrace my wheezin' breast
I don't want to lose my faith in you
I want to get out of here. The prison of oblivion
Say goodbye, 'cause night is calling
And I'm ready to pass away
In the cradle of night
My cleansed soul sleeps
Its smile is true again
Its quiet moan is relieved
There's patience all around
Confusion's left behind
If you need a sign I'm fine:
Just look up to the sky
I painted it there
I hid it there
I draw it there
The symbol of silence[Music: Bart, Lyrics: Sven]
Apathy raised upon childhood, Social skills erased
Automaticly blocking of any contact, Eomtions numbed
The anger grows within me...
I'm a walking human time bomb
Adrenaline thrusting in my blood flow,
morals collapse... Barriers fade as I take control...
With the first blow of the hammer, My mind's unblocked
Feelings I only dreamt of having, A psychic extacy
Murder becoming my sole comfort, Regressed for so long
Your body, my canvas of exploration, My playground of pus
Becoming, A self made god, a tool moulded by society
A - a nemesis of man, The emotions of which I'm fuelled
Result of social abuse, murder takes control
Another death ensued, another asshole entombed
[Leads: Bart]
With the first blow of the hammer, My mind's unblocked
Feelings I only dreamt of having, A psychic extacy
Murder becoming my sole comfort, Regressed for so long
Your body, my canvas of exploration, My playground of pus
Again I hack.Shake shake shake
Shake what you got
Shake what God give ya Baby
Until the break of dawn
Please please please
Get up on your feet
Finish what you started Baby
'Cause I need some relief
She's like a religion
She'll make you testify
Do you love me or hate me tonight
Baby make up your mind
Let me
Come inside
Don't leave me high and dry
If lovin' you's a crime
I don't want to be right
Do you love me or hate me tonight
You take take take
You take your time
You got me on my knees girl
But you ain't satisfied
You break break break
You break my heart
I ain't had a smoke in weeks
But you make me want to start
She's like a religion
She'll make you testify
Do you love me or hate me tonight
Baby make up your mind
Let me come inside
Don't leave me high and dry
If lovin' you's a crime
I don't want to be right
Do you love me or hate me tonight
Testify
Do you love me
Do you hate me
Make up your mind
Love me
Hate Me
Do you love me
Or do you hate meI wanna watch you suck his dick
I know you fucking love it bitch
Do you see me now?
Look into my fucking eyes(Dedicated to Duke Amduscias)
I die & I see the abyss of space
Killing time flows in river with blood
Wrath, valley of fear in my face
Now I'm going to astral sleep -
to see my petrifying
Heaven crying!
I want to burn the heavens
With ancient fire of eternity
I'm dying sovereign of ancient sorcery
Fire walk on valles, I swam in it,
I swimming to Acheron
In this river I die with my wisdom
My minds die, Acheron give my wisdom
Fire impaling the sky, angels die like rats
Demons wake up, and the black alchemy begins
Rotting God fall from sky,
and vermins eat his flesh
Acheron deliver my wisdom
and the wrath of Emperor of blackfields
My mission complete, I die
like nighty wizard of darkness
River of death burned my
flesh in darknessDesires to live in the past
To start all over again
When nobody knows and nobody cares
And no one is to blame
A short distance from Heaven
Even though I know it's not the same
I think I must be crazy now
Cause I have yet to go insane
Can I ever let myself smile again
Or will I only wind up feeling pain
The ticking of the clock on the wall
The only sound that remains
It sounds like it's a time bomb
Set to go off in my brain
I got a broken mind, here's my broken song
Why can't I make this damn thing work right
How come I feel like nothing's ever right
Why am I the one who's always wrong
Do you really want to win this fight
Or do you want to just beat me down
Why do I in the morning even bother
To open my eyes
I guess my will is instinct strong
Why do I lose everything I want
When just to get it I had to wait so long
I'm all screwed up inside
It's getting hard to make things clear
I don't know what the hell is wrong with meNet cap. of 58 thousand pounds
They sweat on their way down
Grey ports with customs bastards
Hang around like clowns the
Uh-containers and their drivers
Bad indigestion
Bad bowel retention
Speed for their wages
Suntan, torn short sleeves
Look at a car park for two days
Look at a grey port for two days
Train line, stone and grey
This is not their town
Big cigars come out of the ground
Sweat on their way down
F. Jack's a distant relation
Communists are just part time workers
And there's no thanks
From the loading bay ranksYou have the right to remain silent
But who the hell wants to
Anything you say will be used
Only to degrade you
Dog Eat Dog, Dog Eat Dog, Dog Eat Dog!
Stripped of all your dignity
Who the fuck cares
Misleading future you must be told
no one even dares
Dog Eat Dog, Dog Eat Dog, Dog Eat Dog!
Welcome to the music biz
Always take never give
This is where te leaches live
Lose you life to make it big
Dog Eat Dog, Dog Eat Dog, Dog Eat Dog!
Pencil pusher cocaine breath
Too damn fat for your own big desk
You'd be nowhere without me
It's dog eat dog, nothing's free, no.
Dog Eat Dog, Dog Eat Dog, Dog Eat Dog!I fly over the Earth very high
The sky vanishes, like mist, melts away
The colours change the the universe's image
I love this state, this hue of life
I lower the flight, sky opens it's gateway
I enter the legends' and the myths' ground
A glimpse of the answer - I do not believe
Azureis gateway shuts ordering to leave
Highest I am, with this splendid colour
There is no secret, mysteryis in here
I know the all azure landscapes' stories
I bear on the Earth the expected news
The expected news [x2]You're the one that always runs the show
And happiness comes easy when its bright and breezy
Sudden inspiration to a session man's sensation
I've got to get up early this morning
Gotta get my early warning
How will she ever know?
You're the one that always runs the show
You're the one that always runs the show
You're the one that always runs the show
Inside. Outside. Turn around.
I'm a session man
I'm a session man
And, just how you knew
I'm falling through a grate
But happiness comes easy
In your company
I dont need to mince my words
I dont need to mince my....
You're the one who always runs the show
You're the one who always runs the show
You're the one who always runs the show
That's where the session ends
You're the one who always runs the show
'Cos you're the one who always runs the show
I'm a session man
I'm not broken like the other man
They look just the same
I'm a session man
I'm a session man
Inside. Outside. Turn around
I got to get up early this morning
Gotta go and get my early dawn in.
Inside. Outside. Turn around
Just how you knew I was falling through
I knew you were not insane
Your chains were much like mine
I'm a session man
Like the other man
Other man/men

I will take my brother out with me
I will crush Machines' Empire
By my side I got the best B't
[Bridge:]
'Cause we're brothers for all life
You and I
And for you I will
[Chorus:]
Ride the mechanical Kirin
United man and machine
Only together we're strong
Enough to save the world
I was born to be a warrior
But I wasn't ready for all this
Now I'm learning that our only hope
Is to trust each other, X and me
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
From a drip of my blood X was reborn
Now we're linked forevermore
[Chorus][Lyrics & Music by Andersson & Cederlund]
Blood gush forth
When your skin is sawed
Reeking slices
Of flesh so raw
Now you're dying
- Slow and terrifying
Hacking your body
Limb from limb
I hope it felt nice
When the pain was set in
Horrified
Nauseating and disgusting
The art of murder has no
Emotion for it's victims
Now you are just
some shreds of fleshIt was a hard time living in the city
Broke my mind, I was trying hard to fit in
Somehow I tried to belong
They were always telling me that I was wrong
I was running around, I was chasing a dream
They had their eyes on the dirty limousine
I had to decide, I was coming along
And then it changed when you sang me that song
Oh oh, sing me that song
At least there's some song bringing me home
Oh oh, same old song
I left my soul sold, play me rock and roll
Oh oh, sing me that song
At least there's some song bringing me home
Oh oh, same old song
I left my soul sold, play me rock and roll
It was a rough time, running out of money
Had a guitar and my jacket on my shoulder
Somehow I tried to be strong
But everyone just told me that I tried for too long
When you come to the room, well you have to decide
I tell you not to fight it and it will be alright
I've got chains deep inside now I can't live without it
And yes you are right, they are playing my song
Oh oh, sing me that song
At least there's some song bringing me home
Oh oh, same old song
I left my soul sold, play me rock and roll
Oh oh, sing me that song
At least there's some song bringing me home
Oh oh, same old song
I left my soul sold, play me rock and roll
Woo, everybody come along
We're together for one night and together we belong
Woo, the best is yet to come
There's no reason why we can't keep singing that song
Oh oh, sing me that song
At least there's some song bringing me home
Oh oh, same old song
I left my soul sold, play me rock and roll
Oh oh, sing me that song
At least there's some song bringing me home
Oh oh, same old song
I left my soul sold, play me rock and rollI never knew exactly how this could feel
Retelling stories from a movie life from reel to real
You're still slowly developing and you'll die
If you're exposed to too much light at one time
People like us have learned to feel at home
In the darkest corners of their minds
What hurts me the most is hiding the scars across my body
And not knowing if they had a reason to close
You and I know the price now its time to make change
Listen decisions will need to be remade
I told you sometimes days like these don't change
I know you and I we have the same trouble keeping blood in our veins
Addiction its not so much about us overcoming
Sometimes maybe it's more about us just replacing
Look you and I will always have this song
Just like I know I had a reason to write it
Its not just a breathless sing along
I will relive this so that you'll never have to feel alone
I will relive this when you're alone
I will be the voice inside of your headphones
I told you sometimes days like these don't change
I know you and I we have the same trouble keeping blood in our veins
I know some days I wish I could just erase the past
But if I hide my wounds ashamed then you'd never know we're the same
Let my darkness illuminate take my hand and let me light your way
Just keep the blood inside your veins
You and I know the price now its time to make change
Listen decisions will need to be remade
I told you sometimes days like these don't change
I know you and I we have the same trouble keeping blood in our veinsBetween the head and the hands, must surely be an heart
Time and space is an illusion for man
One foot in the grave and one to start
Walking against the wind, living by the night
We're all thick as thieves sometimes, and I know it ain't right
It's in the cards, written in the stars
Scratched on the walls of the bars, man
Where demons dwell
Where demons dwell!
Got scars in bars (knife fight)
Broke bones in arms (ducked a gunfight)
It's hunters moon and I'll be gone soon
You stare like a goat with a twisted smile
There's another motherfucker wants a fist fight
Bringing knives to a gun fight
We're all thick as thieves sometimes, and I know it ain't right
It's in the cards, written in the stars
Scratched on the walls of the bars, man
Where demons dwell
Where demons dwell!
It's in the cards, written in the stars
Scratched on the walls of the bars, man
Where demons dwell
Where demons dwell!Whatever made him do what he did?
Wanted it through oh so bad
Conscious disconnected
The thin line between right and wrong is cracked
Explained by his grim confessions
It aches in me to hear his words
Five became four
Ten became nine
My misery loves company
Two became one
A hand full of nothing
All lost misplaced
Central Tunnel Eight
Strip the pitiful
Embraced the thorns whom take from his flesh
Break them released
Entangled in the torture network of his
The passage is closing in
Detaining my focus
Five became four
Ten became nine
My misery loves company
Two became one
A hand full of nothing
All lost misplaced
Central Tunnel EightEncircled. Sodom's children on every side.
Feeding their selfishness with no regard for the pain that their
actions bring. Forked tounges spill promises
of release through submission through carnal thoughts.
Their greed or a drug
induced deadened state. Pain awaits the fools who fall prey to the lies.
Time melts their false idols into pools of worthless
lead. Exhume myself from the wreckage to drag my body free.
Crawling through the ashes as their profane creation collapses in
upon itself. Unscatched. I have not partaken.
The X symbolizes my lifetime committment to live free from their poisons.
I've built myself to last.
Fortress. Time melts their false idols into pools of worthless lead.
Encircled. Sodom's children on every side.
Feeding their selfishness
with no regard for the pain that their actions bring.The world around is dying
And people smiles are fake
The more I learn about it
The more I suffocate
I just can't stand this hatred
That fills the air I breathe
Too many lives are wasted
Our faith has been decieved
And now it's over
we'll change the world today
If you think this is pointless
Then don't stand in our way (x2)
Too many times
We were standing alone
We're still alive
We made it on our own
And we will fight
For things that we believe
So hold on tight
This war won't be reprieved
And now it's over
we'll change the world today
If you think this is pointless
Then don't stand in our way (x2)You'd better take an older lover X6
You'll soon get tired of her
To take an older lover
Get ready for old stories
Of teenage sex
From the early sixties
Under cover
Behind office desks
Old divorces
Children's faces
You'd better take a younger lover
You'd better take a younger lover
Or take an older lover
You'll soon get tired of her
(She'll shag you out on the table)
Dear girls
Doctor Annabel lies! X3
You raced before
It's been done
Tripped and stepped on
You'd better take an older lover
You'd better take an older lover
Or take a younger monster
But deserve better
You'd better take a younger lover
You'd better take a younger lover
You'll miss your older lover
Her love was like your Mother's
With added attractions
You'd better take a younger lover X4
You'd better take an older lover
You'd better take an older lover
You'd better take a younger lover
Doctor Annabel lies! X4

Dictates of treason
Nothing more I'll give
Wounds are familiar
Scars will never heal
Enamored depression
Nothing more I'll feel
And if there will come a time
My heart it beats with thoughts that eat their way into my brain
My blood it pumps boiling the veins
Corrodes all that I gave away
Contagious confusion
Engulfing all I've known
Overwhelming thought process
Fall back to shut it down
And if there will come a time
When you will know
What it's like on the other side
My heart it beats with thoughts that eat their way into my brain
My blood it pumps boiling the veins
Corrodes all that I gave away
A cleansing state consume self-hate for wanting to believe
In someone else to ease the pain that I need to be me
What broken heart what broken mind
I cut the strings leave it all behind
I'll do without and I won't hate
Won't make e feel now it's too late
Rejected[R.Nattefrost '94]
Come death
before it slips through my hands.
Like long-drawn echoes merging far away
to a deep and pounding harmony.
Vast as the night and as vast as light.
Scents, colours and sounds to each other reply.
Your wounds are infected
and life neglected.
These are the autumn years.
Haunted nights of ghosts and shadows.
You cut the wound to release the pus.
You cut your wrist.
You do not wish to live
and kissed the world bloodred.
Through coldness.if you could see where the diamonds grow
or turn a stone to gold
if you could heal an abandoned soul
would your word be sold?
if you could sing with the siren's song
break the Chinese Wall
and if you could speak with the devil's tongue
bring Babylon to fall
hide where stars have gone down
watch the eyes in the face of God
mind their light at sundown
use the arms in the grace of God
if you could see where the diamonds grow
or turn a soul to stone
and if you could be just the fool next door
say would you long for more?
hide where stars have gone down
watch the eyes in the face of God
mind their light at sundown
use the arms in the grace of God
your eyes will turn the holy way
deny the war forever
we build our walls to keep us sane
and out of love we sailExtraction, no one moves
Aggravation is the current mood
Closed accounts, prosecute
Dressed in these outdated suits
Transmission incorrect
Is there anyone that's competent?
Dismissal but I can't vacate
Forcing my seeds to germinate
Like history in the making
Like history in the making
Can we please blur the edges
Of this past memory?
Like history in the making
Like history in the making
Can we please blur the edges
Of this past memory?
This will make for a great story
That we will never repeat
Nod your head, tap your feet
Because that's the only review I need
Like history in the making
Like history in the making
Can we please blur the edges
Of this past memory?
Like history in the making
Like history in the making
Can we please blur the edges
Of this past memory?
These capillaries ball into a fist
I tuck it safely away inside my pocket
How can I be more obvious
Blazers are worthless when you can't produce a hit
To be the biggest disappointment
To be the biggest disappointment
To be the biggest disappointment
To be the biggest disappointment
Extraction, no one moves
Aggravation is the current moodwie lange noch willst du nicht richten
und unser blut nicht rchen an den bewohnern der erde
und es wurde ihnen gesagt sie sollten noch kurze zeit sich gedulden

eine andere stimme hrte ich vom himmel her rufen:
gehet weg von ihr damit ihr nicht ihrer snden
teilhaftig werdet und an ihren plagen nicht anteil habt
denn ihre snden stiegen auf bis zum himmel
und man gedachte ihrer frevel
vergeltet ihr was sie euch angetan hat
doppelt zahlet ihr heim nach ihren werken
zweifach fllet den becher den die gefllt hat
wie stolz sie prunkte und in ppigkeit schwelgte
soviel gebet ihr pein und leid
wie stolz sie prunkte und in ppigkeit schwelgte
soviel gebet ihr pein und leid
darum sollen an einem tage ihre plagen kommen
tod und jammer und hunger
darum sollen an einem tage ihre plagen kommen
tod und jammer und hunger
vom feuer soll sie verzehrt werden denn
stark ist der der sie richtet
das blut seiner diener an ihr hat er gercht
und sie riefen halleluja

von ewigkeit zu ewigkeit

kaos.Can't believe the world is a place for lies
Can't believe the world is only rules by power (alone)
Can't believe that everyone humbles before repression
But I'm very sure; we're damned for downfall.
Children of damnation, slaved until death
The mankind is the living end of the world
A spreading and ailing sickness.
If you don't want to suffer, start hating
Looking for a way out you'll perish.So high on believing
Not seeing your changing
I carry the weight and I'm weary
We're rounded severely
Despite of your vision
You claim seeing so clearly
Can't respect your decision
In the wake of the weary
Your angels are calling
The aim is rewarding
Through ashes and falling
So helpless and withering
We're wounding severely
Despite of your treason
And a future I'm fearing
I try to run when the walls come down
Try to hide from the feelings I'm fearing but still.
Can't respect your decision
We're wounded severely
Should see it so clearly
And I can't take it no more
A life in a lie where I scream and I cry
But she won't lie no moreAll that is artificial maintains us. That which exists is inadequate. The hypocrisies of technology betray our senses. Simulated emotions, fooled again. We're labels and files in cabinets. Payroll accounts and calculations. We're gears that run the machine that dictates life as we know it (and we don't). We're gears that run the machine that dictates our lives. We're rung of our humanity on which technocracy thrives. We're expendable figures, we're liquidation. We're character strings and data statements. We learn, live and die a number.On the fields of desolation
We are all alone
Crying in each others arms
In fear of the unknown
Feelings of uncertainty
We are all doomed
To live in solitude
And never ending gloom
On the fields of desolation
Eternal life or termination
Why don't you cover me
I need your sanctuary
This sea I'm drowning in
Might be where the end begins
In times of grief and sadness
We're searching for the light
Seek for a place of safety
Seek for a place to hide
God turned his back on man
In divine resignation
Torn between two believes
Eternal life or termination?
As we drown in darkness
Weak and depraved
On our final journey
Too late to be saved
We've gone through places
Where the cold wind blows
Is this the end of it all
I don't know, I don't knowTribal war social plague invades
Society
Nature of the habitat confronts
Bombard in pain
Ridiculed for sarcastic gain
Bad vibe
All I see is dark it helps me visualize
The grotesque tactics of your
Cellophane solidifies
It suffocates
Regulates in dimensions
Embellished in the comfort state
Allow the nerves o cascade
Licked shut penetrate
When will it disintegrate
Surrounded by compassion to remove myself
From social weight
Migraine
The tribe runs rampant
Crew's insane
Fluctuation of the mind, refrain
Reaction
For every opposite reaction
The mind went numb anesthesia
Insomnia
Left of focused nausea
Different - but at the same time same
A tribe of human beings with different names
We may live in different places
But there's no mistake we share the same
Bitter faces
You can't isolate the hate
Too busy fighting amongst ourselves
To make a difference anyway
We've got to get our act together
We've got to fight the enemy
Too busy wasting our time
With turf squabbles and street crimes
We make things twice as hard
The unity has been scarred
Too many ignorant minds
Stuck in the system for lifeShivers herald an upcoming possession
The urges to create set us ablaze
Demonic art sacrificed to the night
A monument of malicious sonority
The most precious gift
For the everlasting cycle
For the beginning and the end
For the comprehensive darkness
For master Satan and ourselves
Millions of insignificant existences
Exceeded by our tones supreme
Melodies older than mortality
Enormous as death itself
The chosen ones have command of the language
That needs neither mouth nor words
Our minost soul transformed into notes
We are element as well as entirety
So what is paradise if not hellWar games inside your brain
You've got to fight alone
Falling back
Your sanity has gone
Why'd you ever think you can
Run away from pain
Sorry, man
Your tries were all in vain
Wondering 'round
Like a phantom in the dark
And you're waiting for the night to come
Lunacy attacks
And you struggle to hit back
You'll be waiting for the morning sun
I'm the voice commanding you
Divided we're nothing
United we're breaking the rules
I'm the voice commanding you
Someday the madness will lose control
Over you
Dream it all
You can fly in a never-ending story
Where the sun will shine
Every passing day
Free your mind
Let your spirit go free to fly high
Let the minutes be gone
And fly away
Coming in and out
The confusions in your mind
Going crazy as the night moves on
Playing with your head
Now you're wishing to be dead
And you're praying for the dawn to come
I'm the voice commanding you
Divided we're nothing
United we're breaking the rules
I'm the voice commanding you
Don't let the madness assume control
Over you
Over you
Over you
[Choir:
I'll be there reminding how you are
(I'll be there reminding how you are)
((I've got a reminding story of life))
You look inside, a man new
Take a chance, that's never late]
I'm the voice commanding you
(Laying down the law)
Divided we're nothing
United we're breaking the rules
Were breaking the rules
I'm the voice commanding you
Can't make me go away
I'm over you
I will never surrender!
I'm commanding you
Laying down the law
Over you
The border line
That you can't hide
The voice commanding youSo viel Zeit und so viel Leid
Sklave der Unendlichkeit
Gefangen im KÃ¤fig deines Ichs
Einen Ausweg siehst du nicht
So viel Zeit und so viel Streit

So viel Zeit und so viel Neid

Gefesselt in UnzulÃ¤nglichkeit

Colored balls in front of his eyes
It's number one for his Kelly's eye
Treble-six right over his eye
A big shot's voice in his ears
Worlds of silence in his ears
All the numbers account for years
Checks the cards through eyes of tears
Bingo-Master's Breakout!
All he sees is the back of chairs
In the mirror, a lack of hairs
A lighted room, checks fill out
Here the players all shout
Bingo-Master's Breakout!
A glass of lager in his hand
Silver microphone in his hand
Wasting time in numbers and rhymes
[One hand drug and faces bright]
Bingo-Master's Breakout!
Came the time he flipped his lid
Came the time he flipped his lid
Holiday in Spain fell through
Players put it down to
Bingo-Master's Breakout
A hall full of cards left unfilled
He ended his life with wine and pills
There's a grave somewhere only partly filled
A sign in graveyard on a hill reads
Bingo-Master's BreakoutFearless on my final quest
Find truth beyond the flesh
Fleeting past my dreams of unfulfilled desire
My strength unwavering
My journey just beginning
A desperate race through the corridors of hell
Chaos emerges - Surrender I will not
The last enemy is falling
Here I am - To conquer death itself
The last enemy is falling
Here I stand - To conquer death itself
Funeral silence beneath the burning cross
My immortal soul sleeps with the wolves tonight
Skin and bones that rot my blood runs dry
See me die to rise with the gods again
Defy...Decay
Arise again
Chaos emerges
Surrender I will notWhen the missiles are falling and the reaper comes calling
You had better kiss your ass goodbye
Atomic detonation, mass immolation
Without a warning, all your memories will die
So try to relax, face up to the facts
You'll either die or the fallout will rot you in your tracks
There'll be no tomorrow, only pain and sorrow
'Cause our future's in the hands of a raving madman
They spend all their time building missiles so people die
What kind of life do you expect for us to live?
We're angered by fear, because the time is near
When some lunatic will finally pull the plug
And forever after, you can hear the laughter
World's being plastered by an evil bastard
Exterminating faster, devastating plaster
Fabulous disaster
Now you can see, what this all means to me
When the bomb comes falling down
Now the reaper has called, but do you have the balls
To sit there or stand up and fight?
Try to make a note, it's your right to vote
To keep these fucking assholes in line
It will always be the same 'cause they lie in their campaigns
Promise through their teeth for total world peace
So we know it's not the truth, they should call Dr. Ruth
On how to give the people the real big screw
They spend all their time building missiles so people die
What kind of life do you expect for us to live?
We're angered by fear, because the time is near
When some lunatic will finally pull the plug
And forever after, you can hear the laughter
World's being plastered by an evil bastard
Exterminating faster, devastating plaster
Fabulous disaster
Now you can see, what this all means to me
When the bomb comes falling down(Brutal Truth)
Reformation at hand
Our time to stand
Misconceptions are a thing of the past
Enslaved minds give birth to a new generation
Your generation
The myth, a fiction of what you will believe
Lies, corruption, fininaial catastrophe
Legality, the only way
Progressive hemp-minded, call for legality
Ignorant and fearful, rejecting on 13
Their foolish lies will break our backs beyond humanity
Legality the only wayThrough the old valley of golden trees
In the land of elves
A young boy hated the line that destiny
Wrote out on his race
He sighed for the fire
He sighed for the wind
And the rain on the face
Far away from kingdom lit by the blaze
Lost in a strange place
Somewhere in dreams there is a way
Vast towers and gardens
Somewhere in dreams there is a bay
Full of fantasy
Dragons in my dreams
Look for the glory
In the time's stream
I just can flee
Dragons in my dreams
Tell us the story
Where the sunset beams
I will be free
And he woke one morning in elves? land
His heart was in chains
And the king of the elves couldn't understand
Believed him insane
But every night his soul wished to race
Through the seven seas
Watching the stars in the deep space
Out of his agony
In the white land of dreams there is a way
High mountain and forests
Words on the wind that sweetly say
Full of fantasy
Dragons in my dreams
Look for the glory
In the time's stream
I just can flee
Dragons in my dreams
Tell us the story
Where the sunset beams
I will be freeHope is eternal, almost longer than torture (agony)
Lost in destiny, last dance of the human (mankind)
Destroyed what we loved, destroyed what delights us
Had to stand 1.000 tortures when hate ate my heart.
To live Is to die
The last hope burned down to dust
Out of sense, but without any fear
Waitin' for the end now, on our way to downfall.
Thoughts driftin' in the sea of passion
I had read the book of life and it killed me.It's a suicide lottery and they've won
The real life has just begun
Coughing up nest of cocoons it feeds the statists
Oblivious to wounds seeping dry it feeds the statists
All value is lost when we allow the spiders to feed
Our values bled into this eco-cesspool
This is where it all ends
This is where it all ends
All value is lost when silence is born
Death behind the dollar
We are in the womb of the statist and all is not well in the best of all worlds
It's a suicide lottery
Drop the guillotine
Bury my headThese windy streets tell of a different time
What got us here won't get us there
It's time for the upright to have insight
Don't forget what's important in life
This place is like a cage that will imprison you
Is comfort only found without adversity
Anyone, anywhere in history
Has confronted these realities
What got us here won't get us there
I'll be there soon that's why I care
Everyone you love will one day fade away
Everything you have will rot and decay
Everything around us will burn
Burn up in the death of the sun
It's in the pain that we see our true selves change
In the sea of difficulty we are defined
When we're blind we will feel our true selves change
In the sea of difficulty we leave our comfort behind
We are found in far away places, when all seems lost
We are found in far away places, not all is lost
We must be strong and cling onto hope (cling onto hope)
We must be strong, when the ground is shifting out from under our feet
We are found in far away places when all seems lost
We are found in far away places when all seems lost
Stop majoring in the minors
It's when you get inside that is widens
Stay true tempered (stay true tempered)
You're not the first to find life is tough
Circumstantial hope isn't really hope
It's just a watered down distraction from what stands in our way
Hope gives us the ability to face reality
The ability to see through it allI find out life is sometimes
Cauterized by the words
It seems the end of our times
Of reacting to the wounds
Turn off the led
The light that gets you
Normalized to the mass
A gala performance
Everyone with its mask
Automata glad to ignore
There's a mind behind the glass
I am sad in my soul
As I paint a cold smile on my mouth
My thoughts are for the hollow hearts
I'm creeping
It's nine o' clock, I'm drunk
The best way to keep on
Disgusted by the price
I'll leave this world at all
As soon as I'll be out
I will take a breath
And walk in search of someone
The face I can seeWe would like to invite you on a journey
A tale of an instrument of death
Watch us as we pass the axe.
I took the axe off the shelf in the tool shed
It's telling me I gotta fuckin' bloody the misled
My victim approached
Cut her head off at the throat
She was a hooker with AIDS
Spreading disease like it was dope
Cut the head off her pimp
Before he started to trash talk
Two bodies in my trunk and police on a manhunt
I'm on the noose again
They chasing me for blocks
Seen a homie on the street
So I passed the axe to Madrox
I took the axe
What the fuck am I supposed to do with that?
It's all bloody
And it looks like its been in and out of someone's back
Gristle on the handle, blood dripping down the neck
So I grabbed that bitch like back
Who want to get half fed up by the half with
Who got a gang of problems
And don't give half a shit, bitch
You can fall victim to the double headed fury
Don't be scared, be worried, man.
Pass me something sharp and wicked
And I'll pass it back
Don't worry I'll pass it back (I'll hack you)
It's raining, the rain is dark and wicked
And I'll pass it back
Don't worry I'll pass it back.(I'll hack you)
I took the axe back to the shed where I stay
Cleaned off the blood and then sharpened up the blade
Waited 'til dark and then ran through the hood
And chopped up drunk bums like they're blocks of wood
I can't see myself stopping, if I do then I'm dead
And the only way I'm dying is if I sever my own head
Grip on the tip, so my nub won't slip
And I'm about to fuckin' pass it to the hands of 2 Dope bitch
I took the axe and swung it through like butter
When I cut ya back you better run, duck, and cover.
You know your jugular well, it's gone
I blacked out last night, realized in the morning
Gotta dig another hole in the backyard
Run get me a shovel, it ain't that hard
Understand I got a hairpin trigger wrist
When I squeeze it off, haha, you get the gist.
Pass me something sharp and wicked (Pass it over here)
And I'll pass it back
Don't worry I'll pass it back ('ll hack you)
It's raining, the rain is dark and wicked (Pass it over here)
And I'll pass it back
Don't worry I'll pass it back ('ll hack you)
I took the axe
Perhaps I had a relapse
I seen a pretty pretty neck
And I couldn't relax
I cut through it
I throw knives with precision
But it's nothing like the feeling
Of committing the incision
Flip it over, a radio programmer
Pound his head into a bloody pizza
With a hammer
Threw it into the sky and let it stick in my back
And passed out at Monoxide's front porch like that.
I took the axe and lost my fucking mind
On this cop who pulled up behind me
I handcuffed him on the side of the street
And started smacking em with it like I was making a beat
Oh God!
Another cop pulled up
So I grabbed the same axe and planted it in his forehead
Two more dead, bloody and dismembered
Now it's back in the shed and that's all I remember.
Pass me something sharp and wicked
And I'll pass it back
Don't worry I'll pass it back ('ll hack you)
It's raining, the rain is dark and wicked (I'll throw it right back to you)
And I'll pass it back
Don't worry I'll pass it back ('ll hack you)
The axe that split so many backs
Its back to the tool shed to relax
Peep that
So many failed with no tale to tell.
And it's only remembered by the stain that they left
On the axeEvery day it's all the same no matter how I turn or twist my brain
I toss my body and scratch my f*ckin' mind
I bend and duck but I bounce 'gainst things all time
I'm left in this box I'm firmly and all stuck
I'm neatly tied and shelved I'm choked contained withheld
Outta space I'm growing outta space
I think I'm goin' crazy
Outta space I'm growing outta space
It's driving me crazy
Outta space I'm growing outta space
I think I'm goin' crazy
Outta space I'm growing outta space
I think I'm goin' out of my mind
I open my eyes wide to see some light
I take a breath and feel my box too tight
No matter how I press and push all day
That f*ckin' lid of mine won't give away
I'm left in this box...
Outta space...Many doors stand before me
but it's hard to choose the right one.
I am the only one who can write this page.
Never stop to believe.
Try and fail is not a shame,
be ready to get up and start again!
Life gets cruel sometimes but I can still fight with a smile.
Dreaming makes me feel alive.
Falling in my thoughts I'll be revived.
That's the way I will lead my life.
Join me and leave you past behind.
No time to weep 'cause there will be other falls.
Your only enemy could be you.
Dreamers don't sleep, we never stop.
My future's there for me to choose.
Life gets cruel sometimes but I can still fight with a smile.
With my defects I stand.
My dreams , my faith, complete me;
I couldn't do this on my own,
without them.
Dreaming makes me feel alive.
Falling in my thoughts I'll be revived.
That's the way I will lead my life.
Join me and leave you past behind.
With my defects I stand.
My dreams complete me;
I couldn't do this on my own,
without them.On a cold winter morning, in the time before the light
In flames of death's eternal reign we ride towards the fight
And the darkness is falling down and the times are tough all right
The sound of evil laughter falls around the world tonight
Fighting high, fighting on for the steel
Through the wastelands evermore
The scattered souls will feel the hell bodies wasted on the shores
On the blackest waves in history
We watch them as they go
Through fire, pain and once again we know
So now we fly ever free
We're free before the thunderstorm
On towards the wilderness our quest carries on
Far beyond the sundown, far beyond the moonlight
Deep inside our hearts and all our souls
So far away we wait for the day
For the lights are so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames we carry on!!!
As the red day is dawning
And the lightning cracks the sky
They raise their hands to the heavens above
As we send them to their lies
Running back through the mid-morning light
There's a burning in my heart
We're banished from the time in the fallen land
To a light beyond the stars
In the blackest dreams we do believe
Our destiny this time
And endlessly we'll all be free tonight
And on the wings of a dream
So far beyond reality
All alone in desperation
Now the time is gone
Lost inside you'll never find
Lost within my own mind
Day after day this misery must go on
So far away we wait for the day
For the lights are so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames we carry on!!!
Woooooah, Wooooooh, Wooooooooah
Woooooah, Woooooah, Wooooooooooah
Now here we stand with their blood on our hands
We've fought so hard now can we understand?
I'll break the seal of this curse if I possibly can
For freedom of every man
So far away we wait for the day
For the lights are so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames we carry on!!!Woe?
Blame it on the rain.
Whoa!
Blame it on the name game.
Size-up, suit up self-esteem.
Tie-down, dress-down fight in the dog-days.
Wolf nights?
Introspection and longing are a feverish solitaire.
In fact, it's a lot like masturbation.
When you win, you beat yourself.
See-saw, hear / say.
Say-saw, heresy.
Stimulus, responsive.
Stimuli responded.
Let's pick a definition!
Undue sense of ones own arrogance or a family of lions?
Yeah, I'm afraid.
I don't want to die.
Not now.
Not ever.
It's a harsh reality, right?
It's the most offensive truth.
Those songs you'll hear when you're deaf.
What will they sound like when there's no sound at all?
Footsteps you see in the dark.
Footsteps you see?
Cat and mouse is a game of subterfuge.
The mind scratches itself to pieces.
Spat-up.
Chew it down or leave the entrails to dry in the sun.
In summation, fright is nothing more than a collection of preemptive suicides.
Do what you do to be alive.
It's a massacre outside that hole, wandering three-blind mrs. butcher.
Suspense!

True Celtic power
from the cape of Cornwall
Cry of hope, angels cry
This was omen, our sign, prediction
Distant gate, gothic grave
Through ages our clan still remain
In this proud land I grew up strong,
My tears are flowing all around
The wind is twisting my sorrow
I still believe in truth and hate
All through my life I have carried our ring,
The omen
All this was the fragment from my life
In this proud land I was born alone
I was taught to fight, taught to win
They told me the way of steel and secret
I am the unburied child, child without a nam,
Without fate,
I fight for peace and love,
I am rebornIn the dim light of a vacant heart
See the vacant all descending to a left-hand path
Where the dead reign in the Godless dark
Every martyr flying blind into the hands of wrath
We give way to sorrow
When the self is all we build
And wake up tomorrow
In the blood of who we killed
We are the kingdom come
We are come undone
And our shadows bleed to one
By a cold winter sun
Give a weak mind all the coldest steel
Our beloved at the mercy of a heartless horde
Tear the cause out, let the cowards reel
Bring the demon to the teeth and lacerate the cord
We give way to sorrow
When the self is all we build
And wake up tomorrow
In the blood of who killed
We are the kingdom come
We are come undone
And our shadows bleed to one
By a cold winter sun
- Solo -
In the blood of who we killed
We are the kingdom come
We are come undone
And our shadows bleed to one
By a cold winter sun
We are the kingdom come
We are come undone
And our shadows bleed to one
By a cold winter sunFor people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"We're the masters of the wind
We're demons left in howl
We're the undefeated warriors
We have heard the call
We're the keepers and the leaders
Of the only thing we love
We're the saviours

In our sky there is no limits
And masters we have none

It's a Heavy Metal bomber
And it's never going down
Flying 'cross the universe
We're Heavy Metal bound
We're Heavy Metal boundDo you know how it feels to be down in the dirt.
With a bullet in you breast and blood on your shirt.
Lying in a blood pool down in a pit.
Covered with the corpse and the blood and the shit.
How does it feel to have a gun at your head.
When you know that you'd be much better off dead.
Looking right down trough the barrel of a gun.
Don't try to tell me that you think it's fun.
Praying for your mercy don't say you see the light.
What difference does it make if the good lord's right.
At the end of the war the survivors are none.
Because a war is a loss a war can't be won.
You're just another soldier and you're doing the dying.
You're a symbol of a nation so boy stop crying.
Hero of a war such a man so brave.
A Medal's worth nothing when you're lying in your grave.
Do you know the pain.
Marching into history Marching into war.
Can you feel the shame.
Marching into misery you function as a whore.
Warfair, warfair
5 o'clock in the morning and they shout out your name.
But they don't really care 'cause you all look the same.
Now this is the army and we train to kill.
Our job is to give you that fighting will.
So get off your knees and stand straight like a man.
Do I have to tell you twice to make you understand.
Freedom has a price and that price is blood.
So chase the motherfucker right down in the mud.
Do you know the pain.
Marching into history Marching into war.
Can you feel the shame.
Marching into misery you function as a whore.
Warfair, warfair, warfair, warfair
Ignore all your feelings just go all the way.
If you don't then death is the price you have to pay.
This ain't peace and love no man this is war.
Don't even dare to ask what you're fighting for.
Just search and destroy never question a lie.
You don't want to bite the bullet boy you don't want to die.
Don't try to tell me that you couldn't kill a man.
That's a load of fucking bullshit boy I know you can.
Do you know the pain.
Marching into history Marching into war.
Can you feel the shame.
Marching into misery you function as a whore.Like a forgotten paradise
As if refused by father time
My land can be found
Under a clouded grey sky
Walking the eternal landscapes
As painted by our Flemish masters
I hear the music
Created centuries ago
I listen to the northwind
Losing myself in childlike dreams
Watch the eternal rivers flow, they flow
Maybe they understand
My already lost quest
For no one can travel
Travel back in time
For no one can travel
Travel back in time
Like a forgotten paradise
A dream of perfect bliss
Dust of centuries
Yet I can touch the cities
Build by my forefathers
Yet I see the banners
Of long forgotten pride
And watch the eternal rivers flow
Like a forgotten paradise
As if refused by father time
My land can be found
Under a clouded grey sky
Walking the eternal landscapes
As painted by our masters
I hear the music
Created centuries ago
I want to see a bright blue sky
Or feel the rain of our darkest clouds
Want to smell flowers now long withered
Witness the people now long buried
Wish to dwell in places forever lost
Castles buried by time time and dust
Hold a bride so pale and pure
Hear the stories of friends
I never knew
Lost in time
Lost in time
Yet I can touch the cities
Build by my forefathers
Yet I see the banners
Of long forgotten pride
Walking the eternal Landscapes
As painted by our masters
I hear the music
Created centuries ago
Lost in timeSunset, expect
This to be your last with Our vast return
As Death is set
At three sixes where hill-beacons burn
Darkness, undress
Your descending skirts yield a thirsting altar
Blood-red, yet still unfed
Lips distend ending, time to falter
Welcome arms wide and crucified
The slaughter
Lightening freezes seven
Outtakes from the rape of the world
Sins expelled from Heaven
Now befoul from the bowels of Hell
Where the tragic in theory and practice fell
Last prayers, hang in the air
Each unto their own rag and bone meal saviors
Strung where crippled vultures dare
Golgotha
Coughs another cross to grave God's failure
Once the forests spired
Nurtured in Nature'heart
Now dreat cedars feed the pyres
Need-fires lit for greater harm
As Her children toy with razors
Sightless and deeply scarred
And the moon arose to phase Her
Cracks a grin so wide it hides the stars
And lights Our path
Back through the shattered glass
(We come like drumming thunder
Tides enwreathed in scum and plunder
Kraken-teethed to tear asunder
All those too blind to see)
Where the tragic in theory and practice meet
Deranged, uncaged
We rage like a plague through this age of greed
Sowers of discord, growing wars to reap
A terrible crop to beat a vicious retreat
Scorched Earth, rebirth
Disinterred in the writhe of the lone survivor
Whose worth is worse than the curse
Of Sardonicus choking on his own saliva
Who shares the last laugh now
Dead wedded fates fulfill their vows?
Foot in mouth of sacred cows
Face down in dust and poisoned groundWhere once a naive child learnt the ropes of life and pain
An ashen path has forged to view those remnants with disdain
As leaves descending earthward are a seasonal display
Within those trees and subtle breeze I fell to grace today
Where once a sheltered boy had learnt the sadness of his past
An ashen path has forged to burn the memories at last
As snakes discard their fettered skin and carry on the same
Without that flesh the life is fresh, as though reborn again
Shadows of a candle once adorned
With ambiance beneath a dying flame
Unending is the grief so long alone
The crying light to death reborn again
Reborn again
Reborn again
Today the snakes lie naked
And the land's adorned with leaves
And I rest upon the sunset
With a soul that's learnt to breathe
Today I fell to grace
Amongst a thousand rising embers
Beneath the sky they fade and die
At last... lest I rememberSeeing that you can't expect more from life
Seeing that anger governs your acts
Seeing that you can't accept the common rules
Seeing that I'm your only chance to survive
No need for a god or prayers
No need for a head or rules
No need for limits for your wishes
No need for morals for the stories
Seeing that no one shall believe in you
Seeing that no one shall listen
Seeing that betrayed by illusions
Seeing that I'm your cure facing death
For your fears
For your faith
For your life and for your death
For your life-sickness and for your doubt
For your god and prayers
For your head and rules, for your wishes
For your power, for your life
I am the antidote
I know you're looking for convictions
I know the questions that restrain you...
But do you feel able to deny
Remorse, shame, taboo?
You deny Church but worship Satan
You favour evil but you're afraid
So begin to understand
I'm the antidote
And you have to accept me as the antidote
No need for a god or prayers
No need for a head or rules
No need for limits for your wishes
No need for morals for the stories
Seeing that you can't expect more from the life
Seeing that anger governs your acts
Seeing that you can't accept the common rules
Seeing that I'm your only chance to surviveYears of wait are over now
She's almost in my grasp
Now I will fulfill my vow
She will be mine at last
I feel him near
The boy estranged has now returned
A full grown man, but still I fear that nothing's changed
He simply does not understand
Come with me
I'll set you free
And I'll show you
What your life could be
You can't see
That I am free
My life is mine,
Not yours, so leave me be
Through forests deep, over mountains high
I've crossed the waves for her
In shadows dark, this cursed night
My thoughts and memories stir
I've left the memories
Of our youth behind
I don't know what he hopes to find
In the shadows he waits for me
Come with me
I'll set you free
And I'll show you
What your life could be
You can't see
That I am free
My life is mine,
Not yours, so leave me be
She refuses to leave
So I grab her by force
I pull the knife I've concealed
I put the edge to his throat
Shocked by the attack
I can feel her final words sear
Leave and never come back
Or I'll cut you ear to ear
You can't see
That I am free
My life is mine,
Not yours, so leave me be
I'll set you free
He said to me
And I'll show you what your life could be
I am free
She said to me
My life is mine,
Not yours, so leave me beHere we go
You assume that you're my best friend
No life, just consume what you attach to
Failure, now hang on others and try to fill the hollow
Pathetic, weak, laughable
You live to follow wantless admiration
Shameless you dig for status, on your knees crawl
Validation, becomes an all consuming goal
Intruding nature, demanding one to play the role
You're not worth my time
Ya damn hanger on
You've got a long way to go
You're still dead wrong
Now dot the map, bring the gifts you offer
As a payment for your audience
Stand up, worship, bow down to your knees
Entrenched within a culture that exploits the offers
Relish in the excess
Pathetic your punishment we must endure
Validation becomes an all consuming goal
Intruding nature, demanding one to play the role
You're not worth my time
Ya damn hanger on
You've got a long way to go
You're still dead wrong
You know that trust can not be bought
And still know doubt of your return
You can't pretend to know my heart
And no we're not of the same cloth
You're not worth my time
Ya damn hanger on
You're got a long way to go
You're still dead wrongvisionaire - silverscreen
distant mirrors all I see
shadows dancing closer
dripping from the orb
master of misery
well, it's all said and done
hallucinations scream
yes, I will swallow the sun
no warmth within my heart
the blood upon my door
the demon's free at last
please let me drown the past
thunderbolt - scorpio
13 nails into the soul
bleeding - kneeling down now
clutcing at the strawsDisciples of a new cruel god
Blunted by the lust for blood
Ignoramus is led by a serpent
Insidious defiled the sun
She was the one who were sowing all the
Seeds of growing brighter minds
Has taken by the atrocious and blind
For raving hunger of the greed
Then the light has died...
Enlightened beauty with the lucid wisdom
Endless devotion to the sky and seas of lore
She was the one who were sowing all the
Seeds of growing brighter minds
Has taken by the atrocious and blind
For raving hunger of the greed
Then the light has died and withdrawn to the skies...
With the lust of power, the serpent daubed the source of light
With the lust for blood, disciples tortured and killed
In the name of god
The evil became Saint...
The beauty is shattered...
She was the martyr and the one
To be rememebered
Being fallen apart
Was never an oblivion
Time wiped out the dust of vile
And greaten the memory of the pure
Curse you all who pretending as god
Curse you all! The following blind!
"The vile Galilean struck you and cursed you;
But in falling, you became even greater! And now, alas!
The spirit of Plato and the body of Aphrodite
Have withdrawn forever to the fair skies of Hellas"
from the poem "Hypatie" by Leconte de LisleVor zwanzig Tagen kam der Tod in die Stadt
In unserem Dorf leben kaum mehr hundert Mann
Die Ratten zwar kamen als ihre Boten
Und dann begann die Herrschaft der Pest
Eine nach der anderen fullte sich die Pestgruben
Die Hutten im Dorf langst niedergebrannt
Ich wei? Nicht mal, wie viele noch am Leben sind
Sie haben sich verkrochen vor dem Untergang
Seit der Doktor starb, fuhrt
Niemand mehr den Leichenkarren
Su? En Totenruch treibt der
Herbstwind uber's Land
Langst kann kein Fenster ich mehr offnen
Der Nachtwind zeugt vom Tod der allgegenwartig ist
Nun bin ich allein
Mein Vater vor acht Tagen
Gegangen und heut ist die Mutter ihm gefolgt
Zum Schlu? Hat sie ihren Sohn
Nicht mal mehr erkannt
Und uber allem weht der Wind so kalt
Mein letzter Schrei , schon lange verhallt
Zwei Tage zuvor ist der neue Pestdoktor gekommen
Er schnitt ihre Beulen auf und
Sprach, da? Er bald wieder nach uns sahe
Mir war so ubel, ich hab ihn kaum vernommen
Was nutzt unser Reichtum uns jetzt
Wenn der Tod uns holt
Einen nach dem anderen
Und uber allem weht der Wind so kalt
Oben auf der Burg sieht man niemand mehr
Vielleicht sind jetzt alle schon tot
Seit Tagen hab ich nicht mehr geweint
Da sind keine Tranen mehr
Jetzt ist nichts mehr ubrig
Nur mein Leben hab ich noch
Wie lang wei? Allein die Pest
Fortzugehen ist sinnlos
Denn uberall ist es wie hier
Ich werd mich betrinken
Und warten auf den Tod
Es hei?t, es gibt ein Licht
Am Ende des Weges
Ich werde sehen, ob es stimmtCome here and bend over
Torturing I like
I'm picking candy from a window store
And want to eat everything in sight
It's so nourishing
Every move is exciting
All there for the take tonight
Come near I bet you wonder
If I'm a callous man
Execution by the numbers
Unable to withstand
Do you feel yourself breaking sweat
Light head, short of breath
Watch me cry them tears of joy
I got some news for you
All the pain you'll feel is due
So tell me
What's your pleasure - oh the pleasure's mine
What's your pleasure - running down your spine
What's your pleasure - oh about to lose your
Mind, mindCelebration of life in all its forms.
The visionary scope of wonders.
Confluent and figural scenery.
The resilient existence of the past.
As a drone of the inevitable progress.
The carrier that breach the horizon.
I see the winter all summer through.
Moments inducing the way and sight.
Dark is the astray, as the olden domain.
Illumine the wonder new.
Spiritual moraine, a phantom brew.
The wonder - of the solar/lunar peak.
Through the glimpse of the moments.
Query presence of celestial wisdom.
Mirrors summoning fires igniting.
Fires inducing the day and light.My star, bring me your love
My star, light up my way
Never believe in the lies they sing
Never take hate they bring!Down goes the sun
The end has begun
A season with Eros
And my work is done
Out goes the fire
In comes the choir
Why must I live
When my dreams expire
God speed my friend
Open your mighty wings and fly
This is the end
The universe has brought you here
To die
Give me just a sip of your potion
Let me be a drop in the ocean
Ravens in flight
I bark and I bite
I am not man
I am dynamite
I am enraged
The beast is uncaged
Fire at will
Enemy engaged
God speed my friend
Open your mighty wings and fly
This is the end
The universe has brought you here
To die
Give me just a sip of your potion
Let me be a drop in the ocean
Open your mighty wings
And fly
Open your mighty wings
And fly
God speed my friend
Open your mighty wings and fly
This is the end
The universe has brought you here
To die
Give me just a sip of your potion
Let me be a drop in the oceanSalt water licks my face
And wind fills the sail
We head for wars on distant shores
My friends are all with me
And so they'll always be
We'll never bend until the end
We cross the open waves
On course to far off lands
Thor guides our ships
With his strong hands
Across the waves our sea snakes fly
Carried like ravens in the sky
By heavens breath on wings of death
Blood will run red
As we sever bodies from their heads
We main and kill by pure will
We hail our Gods
Sacrifice in blood
Our altar is the battlefields
Death is something we don't fear
Though it's always near
You brings us home when time has come
We are five of us
Friends of the suncross
Strong and brave to the grave!The path you tread is desolate
How can you be so happy and content
While I have to struggle so much
Unbelievable, this hollow parody of a man
Who used to be my friend
People like you never know their distance
Can't you have fun without the filth
You force on me all the time
Im not gonna share this psychotic drama
Of dismal ambivalence with you
Its too late and you know it
You will never get your life under control again
All the values went down the drain
You're laughing at your own impotence
You've defiled the purity of our friendship
And the road back is blocked
By deposits of self-delusion
Evolution's been passing you by
As time goes by
Only a handful of memories remains
And no more adventures for you
Im soaring too high to swoop
If I did I might miss out on something
That makes a difference
Something I'd hate to loseFoul weather behind my window
Fatigue on my eyes
I'm so much afraid of this world
That I thought I would do it now
I lay down upon the clouds of pleasure
And sailed through the sea of immensity
Dancing winds were pushing my foggy chariot
And rain was washing away
Remains of daily thoughts from me
In a dream I meditated
And stagnant I sail from the earth to the stars
From the earth to the stars
For there the cold silence washes me
In a moment o the highest illumination
Takes me away beyond reach
Of all the evil handsI fire my malice into the crowd
Dispersing empty shells onto the ground
Screaming as I sling my rosary
Into the noose it has became to be
I cannot monitor I cannot mute the screams
I cannot recall the day
That I broke free from my arrows and slings
[Solo: Tony]
This power hungry nation of fools
Applies fabric of war to line the pockets of greed
We lean on the broken bones of their simplicity
And taunt the Jihad as we spit in the face of God
Blasphemy I cannot mute the screams
I cannot recall the day
That I broke free from my arrows and slings
We fight for the right to inhale
We fight for the right to abort
We fight for the right just to pray
And these rights they will never extort
I cannot monitor I cannot mute the screams
I cannot recall the day
That I broke free from my arrows and slingsSound off like you got a pair
I'm fucking ready for some all-out warfare
I got my rifle, I got my gun
As good as dead, so let's have some fun
I'll wear you ears as a necklace
I'll tear you spine out of your ass
To hell with all this shit
Everyone's to blame
Arm the nuke, fire it up
Let's make it rain
Blow everything to hell
Bring the fucking pain
Arm the nuke, fire it up
Let's make it rain
Yeah, let's make it rain fire
Yeah, let's make it rain fire
So let's burn it down, let's blow it up
I wanna see some blood, I wanna see your guts
I want results, no more excuses
Stop running your cocksucker and light the fuses
I've seen the future and it was so beautiful
Everything in flames, nothing left but bone and skull
Echoing from a blood red sky, I could hear the angels weep
Their tears washing away everything that I could see
And from the ashes shall arise a new empire
Their destiny the same, to be destroyed in fire
Yeah, let's make it rain fire
Yeah, let's make it rain fire
To hell with all this shit
Everyone's to blame
Arm the nuke, fire it up
Let's make it rain
Blow everything to hell
Bring the fucking pain
Arm the nuke, fire it up
Let's make it rainBathroom mirror laughs so hard,
Scribbled lipstick shouting truth
Years of whatever, a decaying youth
And I'm sorry,
But I think I cannot love you
At least not tonight
No, I think I cannot love you
I think I'd rather fight
Rusty eyes and sleepy heart
What comes together comes apart
But all she ever stole
The myth of love to make her whole
Grasping for air,
In a room full of cyanide
It's only a matter of time,
Before it all comes crashing down
In another story,
You could have been the heroine
It could have been a fairytale
You could have flaunted rosy cheeks,
Instead of fading into pale
Grasping for air,
In a room full of cyanide
It's only a matter of time,
Before it all comes crashing down
Hoping for, for a miracle
And I waited here to watch you
Watch you brace yourself
For when it all comes crashing
And you think
That they might cry
But you, you will be careless
You'll be an angel,
Busy learning how to fly
Never sleep and never rest,
Not with those cramps
Inside your chest
Never without nightly sin,
Atropine, your heroine
Grasping for air,
In a room full of cyanide
It's only a matter of time,
Before it all comes crashing down
Hoping for, for a miracle
And I waited here to watch you,
Watch you brace yourself
For when it all comes crashingI pack my things I go
I leave you all alone
Well J. it's about time
To face the facts
Our relationship sucks
After six years of sex with you I'm blured
Oh even a beauty can bore
Monogamy, my agony
Is not inborn
When I've said
I've done it all for you
I've always been true blue
Whenever you were sad
I was there
Yeah
I lied
All the nights I spent through
Lying next to you
Listening to your breath
It's such a drag
To loose the best I've ever had
To accept the fact that I will miss you
To ignore the fear of being alone
My Venus is there nothing left between us
Monogamy my agony
Is not inborn
When I've said
I've done it all for you
I've always been true blue
Whenever you were sad
I was there
Yeah
I liedColder than flesh
Stronger than thought
I dance with the demon
And your dream ends dark
Hunting at night
Blood is my art
Red in sight
I'm killing in parts
A pull of the trigger
And then you're gone
Recoil kicks back
My work is done
Blood, sweet blood
I follow my needs
Desecrate your carcass
And watch as it bleeds
Past killing
A season turned in red
Past killing
The art of a man
A soft gentle move
Powered by hungry flesh
Death will be, blood I'll see
Dreams can't last forever
I'm forcing death to be
Watch you bleed
Past killing
A season turned in red
Past killing
The art of a man
Collection by blood
Collection by bloodAngel of death
A faceless evil spirit that haunts
Searching for the soul that he must take
Steed of white he rides through the realms of unknown
He is just a messenger from hell
Scanning the oceans searching for victims to taunt
Looking for those who dare rise him from the grave
Angel of death
Angel of death
Angel of death
Angel of death
Riding along he cannot find those that he seeks
Yet he knows he is on the right trail
Breaking the circle, not knowing of the danger she's in
He takes her with him through Stygian to hell
To hell
Scanning the oceans searching for victims to taunt
Looking for those who dare rise him from the grave
Angel of death
Angel of death
Angel of death
Angel of death
Suddenly I awake, looking 'round to see where I am
Realize it's been just a crazy dream
I open the door to find that he is waiting there
The angel of death has come to take my soul
My soul
Scanning the oceans searching for victims to taunt
Looking for those who dare rise him from the grave
Angel of death
Angel of death
Angel of death
Angel of deathfrom mother's womb
to garbage can
the little children die
although they never
took a breath
those babies were alive
the infants are sucked
through a tube
the murder goes unseen
does only God
and my heart
hear the babies silent scream?
capitol punishment
for the innocent
it's not justified
should we kill
a two year old
if he keeps us up at night?
the saline salts injected
and the baby melts away
can you hear the silent scream
the baby wants to stay
is all human life worthless now
or is that just how it seems?
does only God and my heart
hear the baby's silent scream?Vanity your agony an angry special place
To rejoice your tears
Infamy lesser breed freestab the vales
Of our common fears
Sonic seducers for bitter abusers
Sinners roll free and collect our greed
With my secret source of wisdom fools
Shall be free
I've lost my reason to fly
Beyond the skies of your mind
And what is left of your soul
Oh I bet you'll never know
Corrode the core of my brain
Discard the lies and the humble pain
A prison made of flesh and scorn
Do you still blame my treason?
Freezing, what do you see?
Paralyze your lonely strain
Straight to me your mind's eye
A belief of cold sequences
Faithfucked behaviour still deceiving
Freezing, what do you see?
Demonize your inner score
Straight to me your mind's eye
A belief of cold sequences
Frozen eyes won't see you cry forever more
Agony your vanity I really don't know
What is better for me
Democracy of sad believers
Burning out proud 'till the end of grief
Corrosive behaviours for satisfied saviours
Selling our souls for a silver shriek
For your bitter hell I've sacrificed
My whole destiny
Concrete melody
Roll the dice of eternity
While I wait to see
The end of the world
I will...There is only one truth around us today
I tell you what is gonna come, it ain't no fairy tale
There is a group of families that hold our destiny
In pact with the darkest one, they rule the economy
The metropolitan 400 they are called
But in the end the 7 families rule them all
Those families of evil, set all presidents to rule
But they are all just puppets, the masters' favourite tools
The masters of all companies you can call them too
So much money it seems with it they don't know what to do
For instance they financed the entire world war two
Or did you think that Hitler all alone could pull it through
But that occurance it is a story of its own
An attempt to get the darkest one much earlier on his throne
And the war against the jews it's so very clear
Without them on this earth the proof of God wouldn't be here
Would it ??!!
You're truly the masters of evil
Abomination the ultimate sin
Destroyers of earth and the father's foundation
You'll burn in hell 'cause it's your dream
A thousand years of crying
All thos fears and denyings
The 7 families are here
The 7 years are near
Marx called them "das Kapital", we say democracy
God call them the devil, so many names, it's hard to see
Those sick perverted assholes must achieve their goal
To lose this war with Satan, and thrash all human souls
Global destruction: their number one game
Or is the hole in the sky a joke of the insane
So let them have your money, just don't let them have your soul
Live free and easy and remember what I told but you feeA world like this
we never before have seen
A prism in which the
shadows are all dispelled
-THE LIGHT IS SCARPENED!
ALL THAT REMAINS IS THE LIGHT
We are not so far away from home
We are leaving again
Are you the one who will bleed my tears
or will my enchantment
burst once again?
Burst under your horrific words?
We do not seek to be the source
of your spells of sadness
I seek and I find my power to
creation, deliberation to expulsion
Do not sense, but see, my falsification
While I know this, I do not longer know
All there is, the taste of blood
AS LONG AS THERE IS LIFE
THERE IS HOPE
FOR AN ENDFor what I was
I'm doomed to be
The tempter and the secret foe
Cause I am hell and hell is me
Pure hate will grow
Still I claim to be the chosen one and
Still I claim
This is rebellion rising
[Bridge 1]
First amongst equals
We're bound to no law
There's no one before us
Ethereal sons
Now disobey
Awake and arise
You'll be free
[Chorus]
How can we take it away
From someone who has no right?
No right to control the divine
Night shall invade
Suspicion awakes
Wherefore He's greater than I
[Lead: Andre]
Stay silent
Until the end of the world
So just like slaves we may deem him
Dead silence
Until the end of the world
Hence from this moment we're doomed
I feel
It hurts though
Disburdened spirits we will be
I've learned my lesson
Pure and sore
An offer divine
We're far beneath them
They consider us slaves
They steal our pride
Don't trust them blindly
Cause truth they conceal
As it seems
I'll reign
Cause here in my tower
Impassioned, I'll show you a way
[Briedge 2]
I can feel your hallowed rage
Now enter my realm
Awake and arise, you'll be free
[Chorus]
How can we take it away
From someone who has no right?
No right to control the divine
Night shall invade
Suspicion awakes
Wherefore He's greater than I
[Solo: Andre]
[Bridge 3]
Descend - just keep moving
All things shall proceed
It's freedom you're choosing
Preserve our hate
Eternalize
Awake and arise
You'll be free
[Chorus]
How can we take it away
From someone who has no right?
No right to control the divine
Night shall invade
Suspicion awakes
Wherefore He's greater than I
How can we take it away
From someone who has no right?
No right to control the divine
Night shall invade
Suspicion awakes
Wherefore He's greater than IDar tog en nordlig vind
Skeppet, sa att kungen
Ombord fordes med
Till strid mot tva kungar
De djarva kungarna
Halsade med pilskott
Ordlost I striden
Skoldarnas buller rackte
Blood red bows plough the waves
Dragon heads grin
Twenty ships with Norsemen braves
Riding the northern wind
They left their shores at early dawn
As a red sun was rising in the east
An ancient sign of coming storm
Thunder of sword and shield
Sails appear in the south
Now every man prepare
The sea will be colored by blood
Battle is drawing near
A mighty fleet of forty ships
Two kings bring lethal steel
No words spoken between enemies
Just thunder of sword and shield
A rain of arrows darkens the sun
A cloud of wood and steel
Through shields and flesh the arrows run
Bringing warriors to their knees
A war-cry loud as Heimdal's horn
Fills the vibrating air
This is the place where heroes are born
And where death is always near
Here it comes the mighty storm
Every man attacks
Now is when heroes are born
There is no turning backYou scream don't look, you scream don't touch
What have they done? What have I not?
And every time I think about your voice I
Start to tremble, and my throats aching
And anytime you need a shoulder, I'm right here
You've just gotta find a way.
She sits alone, tries to adjust
She cries please let me go I won't tell anyone
You scream don't look, please god don't touch
Oh God please help us, get her out of thisGore mne wemilo serdce
Da ruka hvatala nozhny
Tol'ko te davno pustye

Da kol'chuga prorzhavela
Gody v pogrebe lezhala
V nem ona i otsyrela
Na konja hotel zabrat'sja
Staryj kon' i povalilsja
On odnim lish' glazom videl
Da i nogi ne derzhali
I poshel v laptjah po selam
Da menja ottuda gnali
Odin raz usnul u duba
Tak s menja i lapti snjali
Tridcat' let hodil po tropam
Da reshil vernut'sja k domu
No zabyl, otkuda vyshel
Kogda v lapti byl obutyj
[Chorus:4x]
Oj-jo - oh, duren'!
Oj-jo - o-o-o-o...
I hodil ewe tri goda
V staroj dranoj odezhonke
Potom vyshel na dorogu,
Chto vela k izbe rodimoj
A izby i net v pomine
Para breven da kolodec
Iz kolodca hren nap'esh'sja

Oj-jo - o-o-o-o...
Ja i sel na pen' klenovyj
Ves' ustalyj da golodnyj
Na menja gljadela ved'ma

Ne cenil togo, chto bylo
Chto otpravilsja v dorogu
Koli doma del po gorlo
Vot sidi i zhdi konchiny
Bez laptej da neumytyj

[Chorus:4x]
Oj-jo - oh, duren'!
Oj-jo - o-o-o-o...Someone somewhere scorned
Never will forget
Someone somewhere scorned
Never can forget
Burning, No desire
No friends, Inside my mind
I'll never change, Yet still you burn
I'll never change, And I feel scorned
Burning, In our mind
Inside my mind, Burns desire
Burning, No desire
Your mind, Inside my mind
I'll never change, And I feel scorned
I'll never change, I must be burnedSkin
Your scars
Surface is
Rusty blades

Self immolation crying out
Self immolation crying out
Self immolation crying out
Self immolation crying out
Oblivion
Your weakness
Is your temper
Is your temper
[Chorus]
Your god
High above
In your veins
Liquid sky
[Chorus]
Immortal
Your savior
Destroys you
Destroys you
[Chorus]Theres no need to be as wise as Solomon
To see that world has mired down
We cant see the end, cant see the end
We are accountable for our actions
The way we choose determines our future
Have you ever thought that its not right
To live your life
Without any sort of aspiration
Were not the ones that you will listen to
But we just wanted to share our experience
Nobody likes to suffer
Then why do we make suffer others
Its not right to make your life go down the drain
Perhaps it would be better to stop and think
It would be better to stop and think
Use your head
Light the torch
A lot of days are ahead and each of them is important
Dont waste your time its going fast
Too many things went wrong
Time is up (x2)
Dont be the one who doesnt care
Indifference is like abyss
It will swallow you
So try to make the right choice[Chorus: Repeat 4x]
Gotta make the paper
Can't let the paper make me
La di da di da di da
Thug come up in a fresh white Benz
Baby mama talkin' crazy cause I'm high again
Flow like a motherfucker say it again
Twenties lookin' like ooh
With the guy like who
Back up the bad money,put it in cruise
Got's new jeans, suits and Timbaland boots
Get off em', '92, all why'all ball
You playin with me, yo, I'm ballin' for all
[Chorus:]
In 96', ok, we made the m-o-n-e-why again
M-o-n-e-why, do you see what you like?
Flashin' cars, worries gone,??
Never went to my head, 'cause I stacked em', yo
Maxed a ho
You could roll by,I lock the door
La di da di da di da, I got a lot for sure
Ho, I make the paper, I don't let it make me
I stay runnin' through my hood, I don't let it break me
I work to get my cheddar, I ain't get it for free
You can do the same, I do so,so why you hatin' on me?
It be, 99' we ridin' in Benz, expo
For the one solo, we ballin' in twins
Right up again, we love em, I said it before
Stack your paper when you make it, it be money galore
Let em know, for those who be round my door
If it ain't about the dollar, then it really ain't low
[Chorus:]
In my early life,they told me I was chasin' a dream
Because I wanted everything that I seen on the screen
Big home, diamonds, furs,and even them drop tops
I went from ??, little red model and I-Roc
I used to, drive my friends, to rollerskating, use my vocal chords
Choosin' ya know, now I'm on the production board
Took the Benz down until my feet touched the ground
And when the heat touched the ground, they had to sit me down
But the problem changed now
At first I started hustling, fuck struggling
I rather throw bricks, steady smuggling
I was down for an ounce, seven years no parole
It's bad and it's cold,mature getting old
And if you didn't know,now you know
Easy gettin' slow, now I'm gettin' paid for my show
[Chorus:]
Chicago, can we make g's?
Houston, can we make g's?
Atlanta, can we make g's?
Cleveland and New York, can we make g's?
Milwaukee, can we make g's?
L.A., can we make g's?
You and me, can we make g's?
Dallas and St. Louis, can we make g's?
San Antonio, can we make g's?
Louisiana, can we make g's?
Florida, can we make g's?
Jacksonville, could we make g's?
Indiana, can we make g's?
Memphis, can we make g's?
Birmingham, can we make g'sCarrying a heard the size of my head
Got an angel on my back
The leftovers of my face
Is a leaden mask of death
Drink my coffee black
I sing with a voice full of scorn
Behind my bony mask of face
They call me the one with horns
But at the end of the day, I'm just torn
I don't think about things too much
Sunken temples, sleeky smile
I've been in the scene for much to long
To not be vile
I'm scared stiff about the fact
That someday I'll slack
Led astray in a world I once knew
Used to be king now considered a fool
I admire your burnt skin
But is your flesh rotten right through?
Alive among the lifeless
In a close-minded world
Where no-one is trueI kneel to you
I bow to you faithfully
I bid you long farewell
but spit out my name, you will
come yield to me
I yield to you
You lay as though dead
I did dance for the devil
but judge me not for
into the midst of the fire I suffer now
Scorching pain burning me
for my repentance, my deceive
an orgy full of spite
gliding all through your heart
whatever the sin is
I love you yetKaltes Herz

Spikes, blades and chains
Sinister black metallers
It's time for feast tonight
Vomit, blood and semen
Headbanging metal men
Gloomy, dark and dim
Ready for the sin
Spirit and the breath from hell
Smoke and chants released from hades
Tolling of the doom bell
Christian slaves, sacrifices
The brave and the strong
Filled with fury
The bold and powerful
Filled with rage
Wearing inverted crucifixes
Wearing inverted pentagrams
Tattooed marks of the beast
Six hundred and sixty six

Headbanging for saatana

when the hours have run out
can't demand heavenly salvation
crying out my pain on holy time
These nails are really shining,
heaven will you save me now?
I can feel you're weakening now
this shadow is for you to hold
let it breathe into your soul
let it rest as you grow cold
ITS AN END, THE END FOR ME
ITS AN END, THE END FOR ME
WOULD YOU LIKE TO REALLY SEE
THESE THORNS ARE NOT HEAVEN SENT

Rest upon your golden wings

Looking into saddened eyes that morn, I'm unashamed
Witness to the crying of the poor, I can't relate
Afraid to see what lies behind the lies, I'm ignorant
Don't tell me, I won't know, just leave me be
Every time a page is turned
Every time a channel's switched, I look away
Washing off my dirty hands
If I don't want to understand, why should I?
Pain and hurting of diseased
Taking life by ill dispose
Shunned and tossed away, tossed away!
Glutiny, I'm hungry then I'll eat, I'm a selfish pig
Thinking I'm thirsty, I'll have a drink, it pours away
So tired, so I'll lie down awhile, the lazy life, ha!
Don't bother me, I'm dreaming, just le me sleep
Every time a page is turned
Every time a channel's switched, I look away
Washing off my dirty hands
If I don't want to understand, why should I?
Pain and hurting of diseased
Taking life by ill dispose
Shunned and tossed away, tossed away!
[Theme: Craig]
[Lead: Tim]
Disgusting! Revolting! They sicken me!
Send them somewhere out of sight, away from us
Separate their children from our young, they're dangerous
Don't say I didn't warn you, just wait and see!
Every time a page is turned
Every time a channel's switched, I look away
Washing off my dirty hands
If I don't want to understand, why should I?
Pain and hurting of diseased
Taking life by ill dispose
Shunned and tossed away, tossed away -
[Theme: Craig]
Pain and hurting of diseased
Taking life by ill dispose
Shunned and tossed away, tossed away!I Love Dissecting Dead Girl Bodies
Their Naked Corpses Excite My Mind
The Aroma Of Decomposition
Is The Best Aphrodisiac You Can Find
With Forceps I Twist Her Nipples
I Touch Them Thru My Rubber Gloves
I Spread Her Legs Along The Table
To Explore The Dank Genital Zone
Sinking Down My Fingers
Into Her Cold Cunt
It's Wet By Adipocere
She's Ready To Fuck
Then I Suck Her Fluids
And Swallow The Pus
Sodomized With My Bistoury
She's Starting To Gush
Fornicate Her Bloody Corpse
Gently Disembowelled
Penetrate Her Intestines...
Oh, Baby, I Will Cum!!
Aaaaahhhhh - Aaaaahhhhh
Festered Cavities I Rape
Getting Pleasure On Decay
She's A Really Obedient Girl
She Does All The Things I Say
When I'm Gonna Kiss Her Face
Mouldy, Emaciated And Pale
A Dark Crimson Substance Drips
From Her Swollen Purple Lips
Post Mortem Convulsions, Violent Spasms
Because Of The Gases I Get An Orgasm
Obscene Masturbation, With Amputated Limbs
A Severed Rotten Tongue Sucks My Dick
My Grisly Porno-Autopsy Ends
Ejaculating On Her Corpse
Hot Semen Over Her Remains
Emetic Is My Way Of LoveWe'll end this all tonight
Wanna turn your back to me
When it's my turn to insert the knife
Well, shame on you, coward
You can't bleed enough to please my eyes
Please my eyes
Please my eyes
Welcome the cycle, it's turning, It patiently waits for revenge out of rage
Transition eludes the eye
When the first sight seen was the last of me
Wanted to know
Now it tears you up inside
The feelings went long ago and myself
I pray one last time
The ending is what I'm waiting for
As I've tried and lied to well.
But it's never enough to please
Yet my tounge stayed tied
And these eyes never looked down on you
But you turned your back when I needed a friend
This will end
I'm bringing the house down
And I'm taking my memories with me
When you fall your reign will shatter
And now I'm prepared for
The ending is what I'm waiting for
As I've tried and loved you well!
We'll end this all tonight
Wanna turn your back to me
When it's my turn to insert the knife
Well, shame on you, coward
You cant bleed enough to please my eyes
Please my eyes
Welcome the cycle
It surely anticipates your company
This day was your last to wake to the sight of thisAlright
Can you deliver
I'm overlooking you
Laying out the question
Think that you'll pull through
Do you know what love means
A push and then a shove
Don't put the thought around me
I'm coming from above yea
Me I'm just a young soul lookin'
For a good time tonight
You want it to last forever
I don't have that in sight no
Seems to be the same old story
You get 'em once and they fall at your knees
I wish that I would've known better
Before I played the dirty deed
Not romance to me
It's just the fever
Here's your chance to please
Can you deliver Can you deliver, can you deliver, can you deliver
It's a shame to take your dreams
And chain them to reality
I don't listen anymore
Action is what I need
Not romance to me
It's just the fever
Here's your chance to please
Can you deliver
Can you deliver, can you deliver, can you deliver
Can you deliver, can you deliver, can you deliver
Can you deliver
Deliver to meI stood in the room when the light in her eyes dimmed.
Forever it faded and burned out, invaded.
I sat by the bed with his hand in my hand.
It fell and it went limp, breathlessly leaving our world.
You think that I'm dumb, that I'm too young to know such things.
But what have I done? I've had to handle everything.
You think that I'm one whose absent in the pageantry.
But I could heal your world.
Your world is dirty.
Your world is burning.
Your world is hurting for me.
A million dark faces, burned hands in embraces,
all falling to places where you could never come back.
My heart was freezing, my mind disbelieving, they went
down so easy, pleading, fleeing from our world.
You think that I'm dumb, that I'm too young to know such things.
But look what I've done. I have to handle everything.
You think that I'm one whose absent in the pageantry.
But I could heal your world.
Your world is dirty.
Your world is burning.
Your world is hurting for me.
You think that I'm not brave,
that I'm too young to know such things.
You think that I'd cave, that I can't handle anything.
If only I had saved a piece of what I used to love...
Then I could heal your world.
Your world is dirty.
Your world is burning.
Your world is yearning.
Your world is hurting for meI saw the sunrise in the sky
It was so long
So many years I couldn't find
The magic crown
The crown of woman of the night
Beyond this world
Of woman who came in my life
[Chorus:]
I've seen you in my dreams
and I wanna be with you forever
I need you, stay with me
Just touch my skin, Just take my soul
Into hell.
Your arms are cold your eyes are dark,
Lady Night
You drift inside my gloomy mind
Like ray of light
You'll take my mind so far away
From real world
Into your kingdom I'm your slave
[Chorus.]

[Chorus.][Music: Kiko Loureiro , Rafael Bittencourt, Edu Falaschi and Aquiles Priester]
[Lyrics: Rafael Bittencourt]
Fly from the haze
Jump on the prey
Scaring away
Capture's in vain
Daring the hills
Mountains ahead
Roaming and stare
Lonely again
Perish the heat
Succumbing breath
Last but not least
Die or slay
Hide on the field
Perceiving eyes
Hunting the prey
In paradise
No one is to know
Secrets of your soul
No one knows for sure
Still wonder why
I'm waiting, just waiting
Answers to return
Don't let your dreams deny you
When it's time to learn
I'm standing, I'm waiting
Time has no reverse
Can someone see them falling
Bones will feed the dirt
Hunters and Prey
You got to run away!Land of frost and misery
No hope for the future
Only the darkest goal
Only the darkest dreams
Darkest desires fill my soul
Land of Frost and Misery
Blasphemous games
No place for the weak
Only the Cold
No love
Darkest desires
Burn my soul
No place for a weak God
Only Black is real
No place for sun
Dark clouds
Land of Frost
Land of Frost
Land of Frost
No place to raise the children
Winter cannot bare new life
Land of the North
Only the darkest dreams
Touch my soul in
The Land of FrostUp in the Volkov mountains
In the rubble of the Ghoul hunter's home
A monster of metal lies buried
Under ten thousand tons of stone
To wield a weapon so powerful
Its owner would conquer and rule
The cult leader plans reactivate
That killbot should decimate Ghoul
Exhuming the robot, the members all gasped
The killbot was buried alone
They only found remains of a skeletal arm
A boulder was crushing the bone
The mechanized man was in pieces
Its brain all but rotten away
An arm had gone missing, its optics torn out
Its load pan was in disarray
The cult leader lifted a black iron claw
His eyes were all red and aglow
They gathered the wreckage of killbot
And marched to the valley below
New weapons were built for the robot
Rebuilt to be stronger than all
And when killbot was put back together
Walt Disney's brain was thawed for install
Cult of the hunter[Verse 1:]
What I see is hypnotize
The things I see are paralyzed
You never tend to emphasize
My views of love have no disguise
[Repeat]
[Verse 2:]
Give and take seems to rule
Never again will I be fooled
Give and take seems to rule
Never again will I be fooled
Affection blends with resentment
Affection blends with resentment
[Verse 3:]
I won't let you fool me
Can't you see I control my own life
Can't you see I control my own life
[Chorus:]
Affection always blends
Affection always blends
Affection always blends
Affection always blends
Pain never ends
Pain never ends
Pain never ends
Pain never ends
You lied
You lie to me nowSince the earth was devestated
I alone, got isolated
Where daylight can't penetrate
Trapped beneath remains, I wait
Crawling survivors
Are screaming for life on their knees
Soon to be discovered
Stench-filled carcasses underneath
For such a long time
I've been trapped
So I can't tell if it's day or night
If only my cries
Could reach the surface
Inhabitated by mankind
They're searching for lives
Deception prevails, more corpses are piled
If they run out of time
Nothing more than shreds of carrion they'll find
Odors of existence
If you smell the odours
To a rotted death it will lead
But among these odours
I'm still undiscovered beneathI feel the tunes of sorrow
Filling my heart
With tears in my eyes
I watch my whole life fall
Apart
Endless days of mourning
I try to move on
Grief is my reality
My hope forever gone
With a smile I hide
Dark emotions deep inside
No matter how I try
All becomes another lie
I look into the sky
Waiting to die
Take me away from here
To a place without fear
Come sweet death
Let me sleep forever
Come sweet death
Life slowly fade away
Nothing more to give
Nothing more to say
No more will to live
Dressed in mourning
I shed my last tear
Through sadeness
I lived my life
Finally the end is here.He rises from the ashes - he rises from the dead
A wolf-hearted children - just as the legend said
Through the murky forests - across the silver seas
To a place of silence - where I love to be
Wandering through the landscapes -
Where a thousand rivers flow
Over highest mountains - need a thousand years to grow
Into caves beneath the hills - for noones eyes to see
Through deserts bare of life - but there is no escape for me
Paradise - is what you?ll never see
Endless torture - for my enemies
The journey to the realms of gods -
below the mighty halls of stone
His battle against the enemies -
He must fight alone
Deadly lightning bolts flaming in fading light of day
Icy winter storms guide a long and deadly way
Paradise - is what you?ll never see
Endless torture - for my enemies
Darkness - stormclouds cover the land
Until the blood of the gods is the blood on my hands
Ashes - into ashes you will turn
Hellfire - in the flames of hell you will burn [3x]
He rises from the ashes - he rises from the dead
A wolf-hearted children - just as the legend said
Through the murky forests - across the silver seas
To a place of silence - where I love to be
Wandering through the landscapes - where a thousand rivers flow
Over highest mountains - need a thousand years to grow
Into caves beneath the hills - for noones eyes to see
Through deserts bare of life - but there is no escape for me
Paradise - is what you?ll never see
Endless torture - for my enemies(Jimmy P. Brown II/Terry Taylor)
Unfortunate souls will often say
We need to cling to yesterday
An evil there or light to see
Gives us hope of what might be
Faith gathered from "once was"
Hope gathered from "once was"
Peace gathered from "once was"
Love gathered from "once was"
I dream the past, the burning bridges
Old photographs, discarded pages
Unanswered prayers, the childhood endings
The bitter tears, the new beginnings
The life and times of a child alone
Searching for love in the cold unknown
Soul beat and scarred with the truth in sight
The lessons he's learned in darkest night
I dream of youth and unrequited love
There lies the truth, in what once was
And through it all I see at last
The Saviour's hand and all that's past
Memory is clear, Saviour drawing near
Feel my heart embraced, see desire's face
Here my soul will rest
The answered prayers, the childhood endings
The bitter tears, the new beginnings
The new beginnings?Lost in your own conviction
Being lead from outside eyes
Perceiving success as malevolent
At the expense of others
Defiance with hands out
Claiming the bribes as plunder
Images presented certainty
Driving thoughts that despise
Subservient, obedient
Wanting to preserve the cause
Tag along within the pack
Acceptable behavior stick to the mantra
Fan the flames of discontent
Open the window for opportunism
Civic disobedience, barbarism incurs, violence within the horde
Reguritating what you're told
In the momnet feels like wisdom
Declarations of simpatico
Cementing thoughts of divine purpose
Coinciding goals power of suggestions
Ushering the age of euphoria
Presuming the absence of interior conflict
Startled by antagonism
Easily rationalized
The mob is pulling the strings
Peers the moral compass, antipathy realized
Calls for action, tensions boiling, surrogate violence
Tragic revolt, prominent support
Favorable courage, bolstered exploit, elevated impact
Obstinate provocation initiating response
Willful ignorance wallowed in
Talking heads to permeate insight
No need to modify agenda
Marching orders on the wayGo, go away
Get away, get away
Go away, get away
Get away from me
These demons that I fight
Keep screaming back at me, back at me
These skeletons in my closet
Keep screaming back at me, they keep torturing
And these voices in my head
Will not leave me alone, leave me alone
I will not die alone in this room
'Cause the hole in the middle
Keeps growing bigger and bigger
And I see the faces staring back at me
I see them contorting, so I fight with my eyes closed
Afraid to see what awaits me at the bottom of this
Bottom of this deep black hole
Where are You?
When the knife is at my throat
Where are You?
When the knife is at my throat
Where are You? Where are You?
Where are You? Where are You?
Where are You, You, You?
Where are You? Where are You?
God, where are You?
What will become of me?
What will become of me?
I guess Ill never know
What will become of me?
Doubt, fear, desolationLive to disrupt,
I live to destroy
As I target the boiling point so few employ
Silence is deadly so pin back your ears
Cause the axis has shifted
It has been so for years
Initiate, the kill chain
Deviate, my life's terrain
Terminate, by kill chain
The soul is the ground that the angels bleed for
If we are inciting war again we've got to stay strong
If we are deciding war again we've got to be strong
We are here, and it's no mistake
We've got to burn this ground, it's time to detonate
Save your fears because their is no escape
And we won't be long
So far enraged
Victim found, fixed, engaged
On this life's simple call
I'm a target to all
This battle is made
With the micro management
Of serpents for all
We don't rise just to fall
Initiate, the kill chain
Deviate, my life's terrain
Terminate, via kill chain
The soul is the ground that the angels bleed
If we are inciting war again we've got to stay strong
If we are deciding war again we've got to be strong
We are here, and it's no mistake
We've got to burn this ground, it's time to detonate
Save your fears because their is no escape
And we won't be long
And we won't be long[Music and Lyrics by James Malone]
To celebrate the guilt (the lies of whispering shadows)
And tattoo their words upon your ever-scarring flesh.
(Beaten, reject, follow)
To make believe there is no guilt, to wield the liar's dagger,
And clasp his hand to celebrate the countless unborn bastards.
To praise the guilt some more, in the eyes of the fallen.
Embracing the swine, this foreplay strangulation.
(Beaten, diseased, hollow)
Though your disease is ever mine, I give you diamonds.
And in an act to seal the oath, I gave you roses, be careful of the fucking thorns.
In your eyes I saw the end, and these were your words, the promise of never.
Denial, protect whats promise, of the fact that our feeling dissolve.
I took your evil skin away with the blade of the liar's dagger,
And clasped your hand to celebrate your vile unborn bastard.
Denial, protect whats promise, of the fact that our feeling dissolve.
Though your disease is ever mine, I gave you diamonds.
And in an act to seal the oath, I gave you roses, be careful of the f**king thorns.
In your eyes I saw the end, these were your words, the promise of never.It comes from deep within
So swiftly without warning
A place that no one speaks of
Cares not for what&apos;s at stake
The beast tears into walls of the soul
Incessantly
Then breaks loose
Writhing and wretched
It breathes genocide
Upon the fiber of your being
Until nothing remains
Hosting monstrosities
Body becomes a vessel
Controlling every step that&apos;s made
If left undone, true self expires
For all time
May silence keep you always
Pray for the death
That you wrought
Walk with me
Come feel the light once more
Releasing this ghost of ages
Transforming before my very eyes
Reflection not my own
Descending to lifeforms unknown
Evolving within to find a way
To cross the line, staying alive
Release me, be done with me
Become no moreA cult or crew that know not of what to do
Indecisive life, but who's to say?
A life that's left them nowhere but to decay
In a never ending search for affairs to waste a day
A continental lifestyle thought to be
Has turned it's back on society
A life astray...
Extensions of their thoughts to find their goals
Procrastinating life they can obey
No sense of direction but they're just people
A life that's left them nowhere but to decay
Deteriorated life, swallowed whole
While choking on their own self esteem
[lead: Paul]
[lead: Jason]
In their quest for a dream
Searching for something - something to do
Their lives wasting away and passed them by
Before they know it, their life's gone
They've met their fate, a wasted life to die
[lead: Paul]
Extensions of their thoughts to find their goals
Procrastinating life they can obey
No sense of direction but they're just people
A life that's left them nowhere but to decay
In a never ending search for affairs to waste a day
A continental lifestyle thought to be
Has turned it's back on society
A life astray...Music: Mikael Dahl - Lyrics: Mikael Dahl
There's a mountain by the northern sea
High and mighty like an endless tower
A tempting and majestic sight
with a treacherous secret
There's a legend 'bout its mystery
and it speaks about a tremendous power
A creation of the Gods
and a gate to Heaven
Pre Chorus
At night you see the light that will invite
the fearless to the summit
Climb and you will find yourself behind
the walls of ancient stone
Chorus
Lost souls in the mountain's grave
Not dead or alive, just forgotten
Trapped in the adventurers' cave
All condemned to languish in darkness,
silence and madness
Forever paying the price
in the heart of the mountain
In a dream you saw the land of gold,
as the mountain tempted in a vision
Where the angels spread their wings
there's where you'll find your freedom
To the glorious dream your soul was sold
To find the house of God became your mission
So you left your past behind,
and now you're heading for the sky
Pre Chorus
Chorus
Solo Both, Dahl, Nyberg
By the light at the summit
you are turned to stone
ChorusSay what you like, I know what I am
Sometimes a flood starts with a leak in the dam
You said we'll never make a difference
Maybe this battle is to fight indifference
Naysayer
Naysayer, hammer the nail
We're all on our own, we can't decide what's true
Betrayer, hammer the nail
Such narrow lines separate me and you
So sick of the sound of people giving up
You can't stop me giving a fuck
Fuck it, I'm a dreamer and I'm dreaming on
Fuck it, I'm a dreamer and I'm dreaming on
With every concession another piece of us dies
Will we fight for nothing, if not our lives?
Apathy is our new messiah
Only he could let things get so dire
All the messengers found knives in their backs
Apathy is our new messiah
The word made flesh, you can't fight fire with fire
All the messengers found knives in their backs
I know it haunts you, it haunts me too
We're all on our own, we can't decide what's true
Why are we fighting, when I'm just like you?
Naysayer
Naysayer, hammer the nail
We're all on our own, we can't decide what's true
Betrayer, hammer the nail
Such narrow lines separate me and you
So sick of the sound of people giving up
You can't stop me giving a fuck
Fuck it, I'm a dreamer and I'm dreaming on
Fuck it, I'm a dreamer and I'm dreaming on
Apathy is our new messiah
The word made flesh, you can't fight fire with fireLanguage - self-destruction
Against the iron air
In broken, non-verbal strains
An all-devouring sand
The phantasm
We invoke
A monument
A final stand
We disappear
The words from our bodies torn
Irresistible
In all its bewildering forms
Deceptive - the images burn
Fragments of silent lives
Hunger of the dreaming dead
Imagination, the death of man
The phantasm
We invoke
A monument
A final stand
In blasphemy
The words from our bodies torn
Temptation
Death in all its bewildering forms
The tomb is the passage
As the light flickers before me
The head of the hydra
The charlatan denounced
We disappear
The words from our bodies torn
Irresistible
In all its bewildering forms[Music: Sean Peck / Dave Garcia / Machado]
[Lyrics: Sean Peck]
Well you know one time it was tenn till two
We were drinking wine we were smoking too
We had three young girls they had not one care
Well we pulled them out, you know what it's about
And I asked them where ?
They said it's
Buried in the box don't you try to blame me
Buried in the box
Buried in the box don't you try to shame me
Buried in the box
When we're kicking ass well it's n the stage
When we play real fast you know the people rage
When they hear the sound they don't know how
Cause it's so profound it's hidden underground
Let me show you now
Buried in the box
Buried in the box don't you try to blame me
Buried in the box
Buried in the box don't you try to shame me
Buried in the box
Well they don't know how they can hear the sound
If it's so damn loud we're gonna show all of you
When we hit the road we do it double time
We pack a load and hear our girlfriends whine
We don't compromise you know it's true
World to the wise you better realize
Coming straight for you
Buried in the box
Buried in the box don't you try to blame me
Buried in the box
Buried in the box don't you try to shame me
Buried in the boxIt started back in high school
So cool, king of the scene
You found that making people laugh
Was more than just a dream
The public took right to you
Like flies to a pile of shit
So funny and smart, so talented
But success just couldn't fit
[Chorus]
Wasting your life no future bright
Dancing on your grave
Living like a slave, someone should've said
NFL, efilnikufesin NFL
NFL, efilnikufesin NFL
Wake up dead in a plywood bed
Six feet from the rest of your life
And when you couldn't see your own dependency
NFL, nice fuckin' life
The whole world is your playground
Yet you can't find your niche
Your only friends, it helps you through
Helps you dig your daily ditch
The bottom line can't touch you
'Cause you're above the rest
But your little friend's the enemy
And the bottom line is death
[Chorus]
Wake up dead in a plywood bed
Six feet from the rest of your life
And when you couldn't see your own dependency
NFL, nice fuckin' life
You lived a life of excess
Goddamn shame it's such a waste
Just one too many cookies
From the batch no one should taste
Yet his memory stills stays with us
'Cause watching him was fun
Too bad things weren't different
Who knows what he'd have done
[Chorus]
Wake up dead in a plywood bed
Six feet from the rest of your life
And when you couldn't see your own dependency
NFL, nice fuckin' lifeIncessent Drone Of Misery
Pyrrhonism Grows Into My Veins
Like A Parasite Feeding Upon My Gain
In The Wake Of Elucidation
Thoughts Are Manifested Amidst The Senses
Deep Despair Distorts These Bloodstained Eyes
Scarred With The Vision Of Death
My Mind Implodes With Exacerbation
Rage Destroying The Self
As Madness Takes My Hand
Thoughts I Cannot Own
Escape From This Turmoil
Reflections Dance In The Mirror
Like The Demons Raging Through My Mind
They Possess Me
Through Twisted Words, Mangled And Unseen
The Light, Dark, Lashing Me
I Fall Beneath The Earth
Staring Throughout Space
As Though Searching For A Soul
That Has Become Lost To Me
Death Stalked For Such Time
That It Came Unseen
Didn't Even See My Soul Die
Only Felt The Pain Of When It Had Gone
I Cast The Mould Of Dreams
And Fall Into Their Prophetic Maze
The Hidden, Revealed Through Rhetoric Persuasion
It Passes
As A Whisper In The Night
And To Live Waiting To Meet It's Deathly Face Yet Again
There Is No Truth
The Circle Of Time Unravels
The Mysteries We Have Created
We May Borrow Time
Only Until Death Takes Us
Words Have No Meaning
I Am So Cold
So Cold1,2,3,4 and the thrill in the bright sweet night is a question of you
Trying to be kicking ass to help me out after you know I never wanna go
Before I go high, I'm very down
The only bottle left to drink again and again
The only try for the fuckin' way to be, why do I slice them out
When together try something drug and you question me what's to coming out
Before I go high, I'm very down
The only bottle left to drink again and again
Come on!
Baby I set my tracks my life to the fuckin' baby out to you
And the turnup in your eyes keep my head
until I sweat now tell me what the fuck to do
One day I gettin' to the point where I can't do,
nothing but try to be strungout on you
Let me down, waiting down below.. for the fleeting past to let go
Well to the end I raise my better half, pimpin' up my own reflection
Forever I saw kissin' you goodbye, to give my soul addiction
Before I walk I need the ground
You know me poor, I never return
Up and next you tell me FUCKIN' WHORE!
The only bottle left to drink before I go
One day I gettin' to the point where I can't do,
nothing but try to be strungout on you
Let me down, waiting down below.. for the fleeting past to let go
Well to the end I raise my better half, pimpin' up my own reflection
Forever I saw kissin' you goodbye, to give my soul addictionStraight down to Hell I will go, I'll take you down with me...
Blood of divine, holier than mine...Wine of Delight I drink to ease my guilt.
Hoping to see bodies to bleed. Hoping to see the beautiful art I've built.
Pose! Pose naked with blood as your skin!
Crawl! Crawl hated, my expression of sin!
Die, die, die, die!
Drain! Drain your soul with the wounds I provide!
Take! Take your place in my gallery and die!
Feel...your breath: getting stabbed away!
Our heartbeats...synchronized...while I make you pay!
Never...again...shall you spread your filth!
Bleeding...heart sympathy...shall you never get, from me!
How can the rest just live in silence
When the children are being injected with their rotting venom?
Led to death with 'belief' as the guiding light!
Trust and Deceit, hand in hand. Born into slavery
Nailed on these walls are the scum of humanity
Parasites of life left for generations...to see!
Straight down to Hell I will go, I'll take you down with me...
One last statue I'll put on there, showing the face of vengeance!
Feel...your life...getting washed away!
Our heartbeats...synchronized...while I make you pay!
Never...again...shall you spread your filth!
My gallery is now complete...and my vengeance dies with me!Straight edge - the discipline.
The key to selfliberation is abstinence from the destructive escapism of
intoxication. I separate from the poison - a mindlessness
I've always abhored. Usage will only increase the pain, a truth I
constantly see ignored. The pollutants that kill the body breed
apathy within the mind. The substances that once brought
release in the end will always confine.
From drug-clouded lungs and veins motviation dissipates.
Imprisoned within addiction,
abuse increases until death overtakes.
Enslaved by concupiscence, promiscuity leads to despair.
Victims used and abandoned by
liars who professed to care. Self-exiled from their insanity.
Striving to attain higher levels of purity. The beauty in life
is mine to know. Amidst the ruin I survive. I've got to stay free.
Damage everywhere - infections at every turn. Through my
refusal to partake I saved myself. Abstinence was the beginning.
What's important is what's done with the freedom step by
step I overcome. Alone I climb the staircase to edification.
Deliverance- From birth an existence of agony begins that ends
with execution. Intentionally infected with diseases
to then try to find cures for humans. Fractured skulls, broken bones,
scalded flesh and blinded eyes.
For medical research and cosmetic testing animals suffer and die.
Walls conceal the tortured
victims of vivisection. Nothing of value can be gained
for science or medicine when the price is a helpless animal's life.
An animal becomes a subject - their pain a mere reaction.
Harmless testing alternatives ignored - they refuse to end their
profit system. The suffering benefits mankind - the excuse
for demented scientists whose brutalization of the innocent
denegrates humanity's existance. When education
and peaceful protest can't bring their liberation the strategy for their
rescue changes into militant intervention.
Every action has an impact. Every life saved is a victory.
The truth known by the
caring few who wage guerilla warfare to end this atrocity.
Severed locks, doors wrenched from hinges, the animals deliverance
from torment and captivity. Vivisectionists dragged
into the street and shot as flames engulf the laboratory. Justice's
hammer falls again and again until it ends
when the price is a helpless animal's life.Bleed on me, digesting the clotted scabs
Blood thirsty
Ungodly
Passing on my curse, the spell pussing gores
Of those I infect become my loyal servants
To ride me of my own rot
Whittling meat from the bones of the dead
Pulverizing pelvic regions with a sledge
The mutilated bodies I leave rotting after I
Have fucked them with my knife
Becoming a product of my own nigtmares
A bleeding sac of infection, years deceased
I hide my slobbering skin
Covered by a victims flap
I love to watch the blood ooz down the bodies stump
Like scrap, a vulgar way of life, my hideous side
Now revealed
Remembering the future is the key to unlock my past
Leaking membrane, consuming bodies
Carving out the cunts, blood my lubrification
Spewing pus on rotted skin I celebrate my
Cruelty, boils begin to form, dripping on my tongue
Swallowing throbbing glands, the juice leaks from
My lips, my only thirst is pus eruption of cysts
Incurable disfigured bodies, I rape the dying
Horrific sights now manifest, penetrating inner organs
The ruptured organs leak the fluid that I seek
To break the incantation of my damnation
Split wide open, bloated organs burst
Nerves uprooted, re-opening healed wounds
On my body
Sucking on the sores
Ingesting my own fluids
Self-parasitic puss indulgementWithout the shedding of the Blood
There is no remission of sin
The hour the veil was wrent
That is when it all began
This was not the covenant that was made with our Fathers on Sinai
The Blood of the New Covenant shed for the remission of sin
A man hanging on a tree
His blood gushing from His own flesh
Will you dare commit
Or be another to fall at Satan's hand
The Blood of the Covenant
A testament
A remission of sinMemory is fiction, so the past is your invention
Catch yourself, self-dissect, how youth outlives age
How beauty shames skill
Prayer is for dependents and wish is for the will
A struggle for independence, a harmless stage
Art gaining post-mortem fame
Oh Creatice!
Your vibrant portfolio has never shown as brightly
As your latest masterpiece
All efforts' fruition in such a wondrous offspring
How did you manage a piece so perfect?
Entrancing passers-by to lock eyes and gaze, hypnotized
Overcome with a need to outdo the last
A child born so dependent rebels so quickly once he has his footing
Forgets who and where raised him and how he came to be
But a growing pain cannot explain behavior of the like
A perfect child deserves the best
But at the cost of what else did you instill this need
To over-consume without regret?
Broken pencils, charred marble drafts
He leaves destruction in his path
Your one mistake, oh great Creatice
Was giving too large a brain
(This organ, like disease, can disseminate beyond your reach
You didn't predict this, a carnal rebellion in its wake)
Strike back with forces beyond his reach
That even six billion can't defeat
Go lock up the aggressor, quarantine before it's too late
Bred to lose sense of consequence
In his greed he exhausts your milk, your blood, your shelter...
Don't let him escape!
Memory is fiction, so the past is your invention
Catch yourself, self-dissect, how youth outlives age
How beauty shames skill
Prayer is for dependents and wish is for the will
A struggle for independence, a harmless stage
Art gaining post-mortem fame
Throw your blood upon his lands, your skin cracked and depleted
Suck the air out from his lungs, expose him fully, let him burn
Show him to appreciate, discipline the cruel ingrate
You still have theh power to reshape - do not let this escalate
Vapors vanish in the night, statuesque guards seconds too late
What rebellion possessed thee?
A dangerous subterfuge, a lonely rampage, anxious fleet
Like limbs tumbling horizontally
Now it's too late - the child has escaped!
Indignant ties, parental constraints
A child protected sets self free
And the ingrate will lie in the bed he has made
As a self-imposed apocalypse finally sets You freeEn esta noche tan fria, la calle no es un
buen lugar
estate bien tapadita
no te vayas a constipar
y al consejo ni caso, salio de casa sin
avisar
y se mezclo entre las sombras
de la calle, su segundo hogar
desde detras de la reja el cazador sale
a cazar (el venderia a su vieja si obtuviera
una dosis mas)
Salto detras de ella
y la acorralo en un callejon
por miedo se quedo quieta
el malnacido le grito:
[Estribillo]
Desnudate ahora mismo
te voy a hacer mujer
nadie escucho sus gritos
no lo quisieron ver
aranaba con sus gritos la pared
sucia del callejon
nadie te oia, o eso creias, o es que alguien
lo ignoro.
te metio un par de hostias
?has de callar, has de callar!
Tu callabas pero tu mente
[repetia sin cesar:]
[Estribillo]
[Solo]
[Estribillo][Instrumental]
[Music: Chris Allister & Henk van der Laars]
[All his devious actions escalate into an atmosphere of absolute mistrust.]His frost performed its art
And it has stained my tainted heart
Just leave me to my solitude
It's where I feel at home
Since that cold night
When my love cried:
"Would you fall, give it all, would you give it all for me
Suckerpunch the demons from my dreams
Would you fall, give it all, would you give it all for me"
Get out of my dreams
His sorrow cast a shade
that I refuse to walk beneath
I said leave me to my solitude
Where I am self-defined
Only replied
With my love's cries:
"Would you fall, give it all, would you give it all for me
Suckerpunch the demons from my dreams
Would you fall, give it all, would you give it all for me"
Get out of my dreamsVamos
Come tell me do you pray to the devout Santa Muerte?
Or do you slay for Hel Nina Blanca without mercy?
The cavalry of this calvary
A nuevo testament that decimates
The reconquista of the crematoria
A gathering corpsestorm of hell awaits
Bloodied but unbowed
These seasoned grievances will be avowed
A dark mobilization
An aphotic horizon
A war unrestrained
Reign of terror is unleashed
The battalions of rage are trouping
Down from the heights of bible hill
This was no new Jerusalem
But a Golgotha that you created
Oiling the machines of your opulence
A sprawling barrio spawning an open living grave
Mountainous Calaveras
Come hold my hand witness the truth
Mass execution of juvenility
The liquidation of a whole ungodly youth
Bloodied but unbowed
These seasoned grievances will be avowed
A dark mobilization
An aphotic horizon
A war unrestrained
Reign of terror is unleashed
The battalions of rage manouvering
Down from the heights of bible hill
Stupefying horror across the river awaits
Can't you see narco insurgency death rattling at the gates?
Barrios of destitution from the desolate valley arose
Come taste god's own medicine
Dispensed from the horn of the goat
Stupefying horror across the river awaits
Come taste god's own medicine pooling at your gates
Unleashed-cartel commandos will rain
Down from the heights of bible hillDestitute of concealment for ages
Vestiges, which meant earlier life
Again brought up on an unnatural way
Every stone, every grave, every remain,
Obtained with memories
Remaining from generation after generation
The valleys, where distant ancestors
Battled, triumphed and survived
They eventually became vanished
By the unpredictable forces of nature
Archaeology is the key
For the present generation
Scarcely or not suspecting
What could be damaged by mankind
It's just a matter of time
The same could happen to us
Presumed to be left alone
Like the valleys in oblivion
Powers from the long ago
Could be too strong
Curiosity of manking is
Always an imperfect danger
Attended with inexperience and cupidityNever shall I love another earthborn face
And I (the knave, the fool) will stay inept
Condemned to forge a barren hell
To deify and then dispel
That summers' love....... in winters' rain I wept
At the vista on the edge of forever
Where the party is culminating thus
Iago deals a hand again
That I have not the wit to comprehend
Above all else our birthright to be shackled will remain
And paths we choose can only be so wide
To greener pastures hence?
(Who knows?)
The joker rocks the fence
But in pastures, green or barren, we abide
At this vista on the edge of forever
Where the party has culminated thus
The deified can now ascend
To where I've not the wit to comprehendAt the moment I have no more hate to offer
I feel nothing
I feel nothing as I bring down my arm
The one that holds the metal bar
The one that bashes in your brains
Bludgeon and crush again 'til your mind oozes
All over the floor, soaking into the carpet
I don't care
I don't feel and if your brain was still in
Your head you might even realize thatÎ O Î ANTOÎ£ KAKOÎAIMONOÎ£ (APO PANTOS KAKODAIMONOS)
AÎ O Î ANTOÎ£ KAKOÎAIMONOÎ£
We transgress the context of commonplaceness
We deny normality, trample morality
We destroy angels with sound
We destroy angels with silence
Currents of tantric anarchy seize our bodies
Into the cosmic dance of four scythes
The curtains of Absurd Theatre are raised
Synchronicity - Mother Chaos on the stage
"Wisdom says, be strong!"
Thrilling words are spreading down the spine
Vibrating "be strong!"
Exhausted I'm running towards the last shines of consciousness
Which is absorbed by shadows of madness
AÎ O Î ANTOÎ£ KAKOÎAIMONOÎ£
AÎ O Î ANTOÎ£ KAKOÎAIMONOÎ£
Here are the star and the snake servants
they rise the hexagram
Sun - in the triangle hidden, sight, sacred visions entwined
And union with Nothingness body I'll find
Strength, go along the Mars path, fighting if we must
Light, oh, you are Ahathoor, goddess of blue sky
There is might of dawn, in non-quality state I remain
Of commonness crippled time or sand, glass you don't see again
Sigillum dei, picture of myself I'm drawing
With life, venom and hell I'm sprinkling it
His name is Esial, I want him moreWe, the nocturnal few
Bound by other laws
To the service of the enemies of God
Are silent and hidden
Yet our exquisite fire burns on
Poised to engulf
Tie a man to his God
He may not walk for fear
Of falling foul to temptation
Where once faith stood her ground
Renounce the guilt, ignite the flame
Cast the fetid virgin back from where she came
Drink deep of the promise in my eyes
Of mist and midnight skies
I drown in fathomless dreams
And in the reeking mire of virtue scream
I yearn to sell my very soul
(And you shall for none so dark and sinister)
(Will arise to embrace the Arts)
Do What Thou Wilt
Until the stones in my heart stand still
Regardless of the cost to your repugnant god
The last May frost may blight the crops
And will never be ascribed to be heavenly dog
Or nature, but infernal tasks
"By your cursings and imprecations
You wrong both Man and beast
By whatever whim you serve
Of the Devil your leige"
Tie belief to the trinity, and seven ways
Will be wrought to condemn thee
Conspiring to cull the pagan ways
Twist back their lies, personify their needs
The war begins by Satanic decree
If Evil we be, we will our lives
To mist and midnight skies
I will avenge the deaths of a thousand burning children
Be bound to a covenant with us in our hellish league
And bring the host of the Nazarene to their knees
Breath the life of an entity never-born
Darkness now descend in raven form
The words, the burning rasp, vibrate the cosmic thread
Arcturus is risen Queen, hold forth the severed head to me
I pour my lovelorn kisses at your feet
Raper of all my worldly enemies
Lycanthropy, please poison me
Send acausal instincts crawling my brain
Take me, Mistress, until perversion is fed
Dark Magick pleasures weaved under the jeweled moon-head
The cross-stick will fade when the usurper hangs
For now we congregate where once my angel sang
That night they came and took her away from me
I lost the woman I loved and I learned how to curse
And to spit in the face of their, "God"
We will ride again
In the midnight skiesBlack shadow of Goat
Follows behind
When walking far away
from herd of human
"As he shall separate them one from another,
as a shephard divideth his sheep from the goats.
And he shall set the sheep on his right,
but the goats on his left"
(matthew 25: 32-33)
Refusal to run
with the flock
Not to be herded
separation, act of own will
doctrine of misanthropy
creative hatred for the herd
goat behavior
not living with the sheepOh!
So where's the one
You've been speaking of?
Is he hiding somewhere?
Or just inside your head?
You built this prison by yourself
I can see
You're falling in front of me
And don't make it so easy
I can see
You're not getting anywhere
So pretend this was never yours
You suffer, you suffer
Just like I saw
Don't tell me, don't tell me
Where we go from here
Waiting for your final answer
Just give it up
Just letting know
Just letting know
You built this prison by yourself
I can see
You're falling in front of me
And don't make it so easy
I can see
You're not getting anywhere
So pretend this was never yours
I can see
You're falling in front of me
And you're making it easy
You built this prison by yourself
Dug this grave with your own hands
Pretend this was never yours
I love it when you lose yourself
It makes it easy to forget you
Pretend this was never yours
I can see
You're falling in front of me
And don't make it so easy
I can see
You're not getting anywhere
So pretend this was never yours
I can see
You're falling in front of me
And you're making it easy
And you're not getting anywhere
And you're not getting anywhere with meAm I too desperate, too caught up in all the noise?
Do I mean nothing, another angry voice?
Did I even have a choice? Did I only make things worse?
Am I just another angry voice?
Then I hear the heart sing...
(Hey-Hey-aohaoh-aohaoh-aohaohhhh) then I hear the heart sing...
(Hey-Hey-aohaoh-aohaoh-aohaohhhh)
Will you remember me after the lights go out?
Will you remember me after the sun goes down?
Will you remember me after the lights go out?
Will you remember me after the sun goes down and down and down!
And when I'm worried then I'll look up to the satellites and hear them call your name.
Then I know I can't be the only star in the world that's trying to burn.
So look up to the satellites and hear them call your name.
They're singing...
(Hey-Hey-aohaoh-aohaoh-aohaohhhh)
I know that I'm never alone...Churning becomes the seas and oceans
Reverence to a most soverign frown
And to a swelling pulse
That tears the empires down
Circumstances
Pen the notes for chaos' dances
And weave destruction's gown
Blackguard this art of war
Stranded, but standing proud
Daring to blaspheme so loud
An effigy of pain - this scorn springs from afar
Ktken maan kasvot vesiini
Kuin kuolleena kvelen
En koskaan hautaan ehdi
Puhun suilla vainajien
Kun henget huutaa
Huulet mustaa vuotaa
Vahvaa verta riivattujen
Vain hukkuneilla on valtaa
Tukehtua voi kuivalla maalla
Tavalla henki karkaa, olevaisuudesta pois taivaltaa
Raise your arms up
Mouldy claws towards silent air
A deep green army
Malign entourage with an empty, black stare
Antiphonal response
A bellowing trance
Rousing them from a hideous lair
Wroth, braying and writhing about
I am breeding thunder
The dry land will drown under
My perilous kin - acolytes most devout
Arvet syvt kuin valtameri
Enemp vuotaa voi en
Olen tynna sieluja
Kuolaan pois veden ja veren
Ja henget huutaa
Mustan lihan tulvaa
Kuoro turvonneiden
Sest sielunsynnin humalaa
En kovan maan pll
Enk vihatulla jll
Ole oceanus - harhainen jumalaAphrodites puppet
You love and your world's well lost
Embrace the make believe
She's a godsend
Ride every crest of every wave
Blind boy prodigy
You're stung, and cupids arrows are deadly
Escape your wonderland
She-devil
Look for a loophole in your love
How heartholed and fancy free
You've loved and your world's lost
Endear yourself to liberty
Black widower
Break every heart there is to break
Rush a heart of fools gold
A heart of fools goldA mighty and unprecedented thought
A vagrant memory from wilderness
Where the civil and the servant are sought
And tracing living death is frivolous
It's this I leave for you alone to press
Yet comprehension I doubt for myself
The cane that leads the blinded but a guess
This trivial barometer of health
A reckoning of sorts, 'twas left upon the shelf
A tectonic fault plagues the mind of man
The blameless shame of dreams undreamt within
I am the echoed conflict, not the span
The pleasure of the motive, then the sin
Stigmata is the shepherd of the skin
The cloak of greater chaos shields the sane
From inertia of the linear spin
The rupture of the twist imbibes the brain
From where I cast the cane, so too doth come your flame
A rooftop dungeon and jigsaw romance
Permeates the refuge of unreason
The conceptual conclave - change each stance
Through varied mutations of the season
By soul and mind conspiring to treason
To unify and segregate as one
Always is the remnant of a lesion
Out frailty inherent in the sun
The madness has been spun, our web design undoneTied to a post and with brutality of the period- burned
Fastened upon a hurdle and drawn at the horse's tail
Through mud an mire
Ceremoniously hanged and then quarted
Forced to confess untruth
Put to the torture
Mentally raped
Thousands of women committed to the flames
Better an end in horror than horror without end!So it's all been lost, and still you bite your tongue. In time we will hide
our thoughts behind open roads and skylines. The silent eyes that break
inside. Love hides eyes this drive, while we waste time. Inside love
hides. So it's all been lost. What we've become. The silent eyes that
will never speak this time. We can't hold back, and lose all we love. And
all we'll lose is what we love. I won't let this happen, and kill the
times. The dreams that die. I memory in time. No, I won't forget.When I take your flesh and lacerate you
Exposing all your hate
There's nothing left but lies to throw away
Eviscerate you
Reduce you to your fate
Deleted and erased all your decay
When I think of all the hell
You tried to put me through
It can't compare to what's already done
It's time to say farewell
And leave you black and blue
When I rip you open all I'll do
Is salt the wound
The bane of my existence cancerous
A tumor on my soul
Unnecessary wart upon my skin
Full of puss
You're a Judas and a troll
Lance the boil rooted deep within
When I think of all the hell
You tried to put me through
It can't compare to what's already done
It's time to say farewell
And leave you black and blue
When I rip you open all I'll do
Is salt the wound
Rest assured when I pollute you
Your disease I will correct
My contagion
Only now I know the source
I uproot you
Lance the boil disinfect
Pestilence of ruin's run its course
When I think of all the hell
You tried to put me through
It can't compare to what's already done
It's time to say farewell
And leave you black and blue
When I rip you open all I'll do
Is salt the woundEmptiness slips into my mind
Emotion so fucking hard to find
I center myself in this universe
With peace amongst all the pains and hurts
I think of all the things that would've been
And the time I could've spent with him
But again comes sadness creeping in
Again comes sadness creeping in
Taken by surprise, stigmatized by the things I've seen with my own eyes
Traumatized until I realize that I gotta go on with my life
I can only guess what I should've done then
Wandering alone on the path I've chosen
Lumbering along towards inevitable fate
I await an answer, I wrestle with hate
I question your life and the choices you made
I question myself with righteousness and rage
Confused and sick from mistakes I've made
Confused and sick from mistakes I've made
Taken by surprise, stigmatized by the things I've seen with my own eyes
Traumatized until I realize that I gotta go on with my life
Stigmatized...
Questions to ponder about letting go, answers I find towards peaceful flow
People take shit for granted as given, not in this world that I live in
Stigmatized...
Questions to ponder about letting go, answers I find towards peaceful flow
People take shit for granted as given, not in this world that I live in
In my eyes, I realize
No more lies stigmatizedOriginally performed by Metallica
Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for they are right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill men would kill, why? They do not know
Suffered wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know
For Whom the Bell Tolls
Time marches on
For Whom the Bell Tolls
Take a look to the sky just before you die
It is the last time he will
Blackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see
For Whom the Bell Tolls
Time marches on
For Whom the Bell TollsThe road is dry I'm fucking delirious right now
Life goes on glorious evening of nodding and jumping starts
I need to make a personal dance party.
The brain works very weird at this hour
Not the best time for lyrics I suppose keep writing, keep dreaming.
Nope, can't be awake and dream, drift in and out, in and out.
Eye motions in out heat lightning,
Scares us both the only two people awake at this fucking hour
I won't remember this in the morning at least I wrote this all down
Please pick the right song the one
That keeps the eyes wide creepy yes,
Creepy the idea of control controlling death
With alertness when is the fucking sun coming up.
Then it all changes, same scenery
But sun involved shouldn't be much different
Alaska the brain works very weird at this hour.
Tick tock tick tock the rain is pouring now wide awake
At least for now nature can be the death of me
A thing we'll never overcome in out in out.Your existence is a script
Life for you is a performance
Play out the leading role
Directing and premeditating every move
That creates the act of manipulation
Mastering the art of deception
That increases your sick addiction
It's an overactive imagination
That enslaves your empty shell
Existing in dimensions
Of addictive obsession
Your script will run short of ideas
The story will soon end itself
People to trust come short in number
Like a plague your lies spread
Fast across the world
Mastering the art of deception
That increases your sick addition
It's an overactive imagination
That enslaves your empty shellI hear voices in my mind
Don't know if these moans are real or not
I'm fast asleep,
Here's where my worst nightmare begins
I can't believe my eyes
I don't have the courage to ask
How can you be here?
I've lost you many years ago
'Cause your disease
They all lie to me
Made me believe in your death
They all deceived me
But I didn't trust them
ALL DEAD MEN'S LIVES
ARE IN OUR MEMORIES
ALL DEAD MEN'S LIVES ARE NOT BURIED
ALL DEAD MEN'S LIVES
ARE IN OUR MEMORIES
EVEN DEAD MEN CAN CRY
I can't understand
All things in my mind are so astray
I was asleep
Disillution on me
In this shadowy night
I remember your voice and your sense
You'll be never here
I've lost you many year ago
'Cause your disease
They all lie to me
Made me believe in your death
Now I must trust them
Hope's just in vainThe night is drawing on but all the strain not told on him
And he won`t fall into the sleep of the just
To be a tumbler or a lonesome intruder
He is as good as gold and searching for trust
(be), to be the harlequin who shines in dead gold
To kill those idle thoughts about this stronghold
(see), see the evening star in this sunset glow
Sailing the splendor ships straight on the port bow
Strike the sands of ever
The lingering sound of dreams
In harsh reality
Turn over a new leaf
Ardently desired
And forever
[Chorus:]
(shine), it fired his imagination so far
And he gave rise to hope
(shine), this true ring of conviction will leave a scar
(to) the dancer on a rope
(shine), so where`s the difference between man and machine ?
And who will draw the line ?
(shine), the game is worth the candle, always been
May all the ways then shine
Sometimes he`s worlds apart and elsewhere lies his dream
And he won`t never shift the blame on you
Sometimes a parting kiss speaks louder than action
When life turns suddenly like a bolt from the blue
(he), he`s not the silver slave supposed to be
He`s on the rise to fame out of this tragedy
(free), so now the odds are even, literally true
There is no limit to it all, there is no taboo
Strike the sands of ever
The lingering sound of dreams
In harsh reality
Turn over a new leaf
Ardently desired
And forever
[Chorus:]
Don`t clip those wings of a flying
When wearing your heart on your sleeve
But still there is life among dying
The far cry off and make-believe
In this palatial hallway
Should all be null and void ?
Between the tricks of fortune
In years that he enjoyed
He is the one enigma
High-flown beneath the sun
Is he the last resort ?
When future has begun
[Chorus:]Yes, as we continue to get it going on
Artifacts representin' from Newark to Illtown
Put your ear to this here
Most definitely it's a sure banger
Keep this one in your collection
Newark to Illtown representin'
Who do we have up to bat?
Lace that
El the Sensai, Tame One
In this field, niggaz get killed, quick with the skills
Intact, ill with raps, buildin' facts to fill
Gaps react, tap into your internet and patch into
My steez or my style, niggaz down to make the cheese wild
MC's get defused cause I'm the bomb specialist
With the wettest, test this, deadly like asbestos
Check the credit set it, so odd they have to call a medic
My paragraphs be off key, that's why niggaz can't get it
For those of you who don't know, my flow keeps MC's
On freeze like Sub-Z doin' MK3 fatality
Do remember like Clue, I run up on booty crews
On every weekend buggin' out cause I be geekin'
Lounge like the peppermint the Boom Skwad President
Leaves a tenament resident finding evidence of sedatives
DAILY, scoopin' through the Roots like Alex Haley
Beetle Bailey beatdown to a soundman lookin' scary
Label secretary terrorizer yet I'ma
Fresh rhymer comma bringer of the drama the bomber
From the Lost Lands, off hand claps I run raps
And shatter nigga cyphers into pieces like gun claps
"When I break it down, from Newark NJ to Illtown"
My verbal, patterns reach farther than Saturn
Bustin niggaz up because my rhymes be breakin
Atoms stranger, ProForm arranger
Fake you-SA Polo shirt stainer with the tec that's never plainer
Indent, that's the men blend trends we make and cross
Without the fakin', to the ten niggaz respect we just take it
New jacks relax cause the syntax can't be Xeroxed
Cause I be locked on spots like niggaz movin in from swat
I X more Men out than Elijah, Muhamm Ali of rhyme schemes
Leavin' my stickers at the crime scene
Skwad Odd Man, receive response like Roxanne
Battle the top man, and shock fans like I'ma rock band
I cut the mustard and plus I can bust it dusted (what?)
Whatever you fuckin' with I touch and leave it busted
My click rips and gets up in ya like the shits
From grits, while yo shit sits like it's on bricks
Tracy Chap raps I laugh at, half-assed rappers
Who lack fat tracks get capped at, fuck that
Destroy the masses, niggaz in classes tryin to catch the math
As I sit and think the ink begins to craft
My blueprints instruments workin as I'm jerkin
Your style hurtin in the club your crew nervous rehearsin
In between the cut I run amuck with mad stuff
Niggaz can't touch, escape wack cyphers like handcuffs, so
C'mon and get down with that Artifacts sound
"When I break it down from Newark NJ to Illtown"
"When I break it down, from Newark NJ to Illtown"
Word up thank you I think I'm convinced
Cool Mellow Max in the house
Peace to my niggaz Park Ave, Swift-O-Matic yeah!
Boom Skwad in the house how you like it now?
Representin the skills, what?
Chancellor Ave, Avon Ave, nigga where ya at?
Aw man the Bricks! Newark to Illtown
If ya don't know I think ya better ask
Breakin' it down, sizin it up
For the year nine-six, whatHer bouquets are wilted
Too long has She slept
Their cruel red mouths darkened
To bowed silhouettes
I saw in a new moon
With Her scent on my breath
But then all to soon
Came the hunger for flesh
I held Her in eyes like necropoli
Laying Her on a tomb with a view
Lighting Her from Her feet
To the stars in Her hair
Drove sweet blood to Her throat
And My lips parted there
(In the tone of splintered bone)
She screams benighted
My limbs ignite
A carneal carnivore
On all fours to go...
An ebon Nemesis
From torture gardens of Dis
Having never breathed an Eve
As far narcotic as this
Two spellbound hellhounds
Hearts pounding loud
Racing Heaven out of focus
Under quicksilver clouds
"God is maimed come let us prey..."
To lunar deities that pave deadways
Twixt the living and the grave
Amor e Morte
To cast our fearl shadows there
We made Love bleed on a Deathbed shared
Where, begging Me to feed
To best be Were...
I licked Her wounds and ate Her rare
Argentinum spurred
her watnon words incurred
A sin ridden tongue
To open trading in fur
Never were those gates of pearl
So rubbed to their cusp
Never were the Worlds above
So bitten with the bestial...
Seraphim fell like guillotines
Giving gracious head
Instead of harking prophecies
And how our brother sang
Amor e Morte
In the thick evergreens
Theirs was a chorus for raucous souls
Shifting shape and lifting napes
To commemorate
Erotic stains
Amor e Morte
Unfasten thy masque
Come skyclad to my arms
Leave thy gown a dark pool at thy feet
I yearn musky valleys that no Man hath seen
The chill keen of stars
Over Yew and deep wooded ravines
A hidden meridian
Where Midian may be...
In black antlered glades
Encunted in this forest Goddess
She whispers My name
I buck under flames
Animal nitrates
Howling through my veins
I ride riptides that wrest and writhe to the fore
New lusts ecllipsing lips
That brought me to this verge of War
With inner beasts unleashed
To feast, fuck and run
Rampart in chase of She wolf pacts
Forged on heat with setting Suns
I love the night
It would murder My soul
Should I ever fall blind
For though thy flesh haunts
I keep also in mind
The stampede of clouds
From Dusk's predatory sky
Purple versed like the funeral hearse
That first turned thee over to My...
Unbridled kiss when I found thee in mist
Dressed for the sepulchre
My Demon bride...
"God is maimed come let Us prey..."
To Lunar Deities that pave deadways
Twixt the living and the grave
Amor e Morte
Ours was a chorus for raucous souls
Shifting sape and lifting nape
To commemorate
Erotic stains
Amor e Morte

Lets the music speaksel, spaksel.To sleep
Without the fear to dream
TO dream about you, my friend
To try
To forget the past
Dark past for me, for you
The time
Will soon erase my pain
The pain of the sudden loss
But you will always be
In my memories in my heart
I remember your eyes
Looking to this word with love
I remember your face
Cheerful and hopeful
I miss you...
I miss you, my friend...
I hope to see you soon
Soon we will be together againConseguistes arrancarme de brazos de otra mujer
Conseguiste atraparme con tus juegos de amor
Eres hielo, eres fuego dinamita mortal
Y jugaste con mas hombres sin tener piedad
Tu frÃ­a mirada y en tus ojos sangre
Sangre, sangre de diablo
Han pasado muchos aÃ±os desde la ultima vez
Tu rostro y tu pelo han cambiado
Tu forma de hablar tambiÃ©n
Te marchaste de tu casa
El mundo querÃ­as ver
Te vendiste por dinero pues nada podÃ­as hacer
Tu fea mirada y en tu cuerpo sangre
Sangre, sangre de diabloTen years ago
I got a call that nearly killed me
Repeat yourself, my hands are shaking
When I was told my friend was gone
I felt so guilty
A thousand questions left unanswered
(I'll bleed if you want me to!)
I'll serenade before I do
(I'll bleed if you want me to!)
On and on, although you're gone
Candles burn without a flame on
Our final call to you, I know you're listening
How could you leave us that way?
Where did you go, ten years today!?
Ten years ago
I stood beside the wood that held you
I must sit down, my legs are shaking
We let you go
With gifts of plectrums for your journey
And melodies to help you on your way
(I'll bleed if you want me to!)
I'll serenade before I do
(I'll bleed if you want me to!)
On and on, although you're gone
Candles burn without a flame on
Our final call to you, I know you're listening
How could you leave us that way?
Where did you go, ten years today!?
I'll bleed if you want me to
(I'll bleed if you want me to!)
I'll bleed if you want me to!
On and on, although you're gone
Candles burn without a flame on
Our final call to you, I know you're listening (I know you're listening)
How could you leave us that way?
Where did you go (ten years today!?)
Where did you go (ten years today!?)
Where did you go
How could you leave us that way?
Where did you go, ten years today!?"What do you do with it?"
Just shut up and take it man.
Put it on your tongue.(An Angel came to me and said: 'O pittable,
foolish young man! O horrible! O dreadful
state! Consider the hot, burning dungeon
thou art preparing for thyself to all
Eternity, to which thou art going in such career.')
What a nice symphony!
Where are you singing from?
I heard your voice -
Perhaps, your lips still speak these magic words:
"LET US DANCE!"
I'm looking for your place -
That godforsaken house
Far more than too long...
Ah...
I was knocking at your door -
I was sticking in your brain
Don't you sleep like a log -
Don't you hear as I am screaming?
The messenger of greed
Who's flying on the wings
He made of glass...
Ha...
You awoke 'cause you were born for the dance -
So let us dance
Dance right now...
And shake your bones
Everywhere as you'll be able...
There!
Bring your immortal soul over masquerade,
Dance and you'll be never searching for the answers.
Your life's just a fiction, just an endless dance...
Your days do bang so loud - Have you known them all?
Tell me what do you need for this sleepy waltz
Tell me what you'd like to see at the celebration?
You may do all of the things your daemon wants -
Dance - there's only one way for the folks and the nations.
I am your existence;
I am supposed lust for life
Have you never known me?
Didn't you guess who am I?
Do you really fear that all your might will fade away?
Wait until it will have done - this satanic masquerade.
"I'd like to buy and I'd like to sell -
There is my might to build and dwell -
That does give me all what I do need -
I'd like to buy and I'd like to build
I'd like to have the keen sight
'Cause I want to get an eyeful
Of all thoughts are going on
Through the darkness and the light."
You become rich and clever with every passing day.
You afraid to think that someone can devastate all that you've got...
And whilst you're going to ask that SWINE -
It will have spoken no word, will be completing this End of the World
And what (are you going to speak) about some food for the second flood?
What about house that made of wood?
What about bed and fireplace?
What about wife and child in lace?
What about dead before they cooled?
What about quest HOW- D'YE - DO?
What about breakfast, what about lunch?
What about what about what about SO MUCH?Close your eyes and count to three
When you open them, I'll be here
I come back like a boomerang
Like a bad penny in your purse
Bart and I will unleash hell
You will spice it with your sauce
Place and money is correct
It is time to wake the demons
Close Your eyes and pray the lord
When you finish, I'll be here
I'll be gushing and spewing
Like bugs bunny and a tank in one
I'll tango in such a way
That the day will never start
Let somebody raise the curtain
We should have already begun
Wake the demons
Wake'em up
Wake the demons
Now
Close your eyes and call the monsters
When you open them, we will be here
Close them back, we will not vanish
Sorry, We've been welded together
Even if shit was raining on our heads
We'd play in one team from now on
And now tell me, the fuck
Is my shadow as drunk as I am?
Close Your eyes and pray the lord
When you finish, I'll be here
I'll be gushing and spewing
Like bugs bunny and a tank in one
I'll tango in such a way
That the day will never start
Let somebody raise the curtain
We should have already begun
Wake the demons
Wake'em up
Wake the demons
Now
I come back like boomerang
Don't you even try to hang yourself
Close your eyes and count to three
When you open them, I'll be here
I come back like a boomerang
Like a bad penny in your purse
Bart and I will unleash hell
You will spice it with your sauce
Place and money is correct
It is time to wake the demons
Wake the demons
Wake'em up
Wake the demons
Now
I come back like boomerang
Don't you even try to hang yourselfMoonlight...

The palace of death far away
Where no light exists

You have no right to live
To know you is to hate you
But your life's yours to give
You monkey see, you monkey do
You're always doing what they tell you to
You're such a puppet on string
You don't get it!
I won't bow to something that I've never seen
I can't believe in something that doesn't believe in me
I'm not blood of your blood, I'm no son of your god
I've no faith in your fate
Still I find salvation
You think you have the answers to every last detail
In your eyes, you're the victor
In mine you've all but failed
You monkey see, you monkey do
You're always doing what they tell you to
You're such a puppet on string
You don't get it!
You monkey see, you monkey do
You're always doing what they tell you to
You're such a puppet on string

I won't bow to something that I've never seen

I've no faith in your fate
Still I find salvation
Still I find salvation

People's temple of the holy
Sepulcher for salvation
Suicidal confirmation
Forgive me father for I have sinned
You will never sin again!
When we meet again it will be the promised land
Death is in command to the victims of the plan
In the temple of the damned
Drink the blood, concentrate of death
Congregation is dead
Carnage of the dead
Mass cremations of the blessed
Sermonizing fatal end
In the temple of the damned
When we meet again it will be the promised land
Death is in command to the victims of the plan
In the temple of the damned
Drink the blood, concentrate of death
Congregation is deadI don't remember if I let it be known
I was a butcher, I even cut myself
I worked with precision, I was merciless
There was no sorrow, there was no pain
I cut my body and leashed my brain
Did you beat me
For twenty days
Burned me alive
And finished by pissing on my grave
No sorrow, no pain
I cut my body and leashed my brain
Maximum Overload
I whipped my eyes, probably a million times
I would cruise around the city wound up
I was up to no good and I never got caught
There was no sorrow, there was no pain
I cut my body and leashed my brain
Did you beat me
For twenty days
Burned me alive
And finished by pissing on my grave
No sorrow, no pain
I cut my body and leashed my brain
Maximum Overload[Written by: Ritchie]
So silent so free of everything
So softly the bindings fall
So very close to ending
So silent forever more
No angels no stairway no welcome no sanctuary
So evil so empty no place no stay
This is not my heaven but it's closer than too far
And it's not forever 'cos it's burning
There's a whole new danger
There's fear of where you are
This is not my heaven so far
This is no place like home
Persistance of time
And visions of my own destiny come back to me
This is no place like home
Nothing rings true nothing I do
Can cahnge the sacred heart in me and you
Why trust me just be me
One world and we're history
No sunlight no shadow no place to be
This is not my heaven but it's here before my eyes
Are we hell's own neighbour 'cos it's burning
There's a hot wind blowing
And it takes your sould away
This is not my heaven today
So take me so far from everything
Surround me with nothing more
So many ways of ending
Be silent forever more.Reckless men
So righteous, so clean
Towards the light
So bashful, so pure
Who told you to abandon life
Your strength, free will
And bow for the light? The light
And turn from the spinning wheel
Fear of the judgment, obey
You have the key to mystery
Pick up the runes, unveil and see
Judgment comes, before us lie
The paths of war and you may die
You have the key, cross over and see
The old and wind-cold tree
Walk the steps
And you'll hear the winds that cry
You have the key to mystery
Pick up the runes, unveil and see
Judgment comes, before us lie
The paths of war and you may die
You have the key, cross over and see
The old and wind-cold tree
Walk the steps
And you'll hear the winds that cry
Search beyond the blinded eyes
(Listen before you preach)
Don't leave yourself behind
Honor life, when life has ceased
(Welcome the dawn)
Beware the glory tales
Watch their deeds, so just and fair
Crusaders, appointed by God
Who told you to
Step inside and preach?
Did you forget
The daggers lurking in the dark?
Couldn't you listen
Or didn't you ever learn how?
Were you saved? Were you saved?
So you could slaughter with grace?
You have the key to mystery
Pick up the runes, unveil and see
Judgment comes, before us lie
The paths of war and you may die
You have the key, cross over and see
The old and wind-cold tree
Walk the steps
And you'll hear the winds that cry
You have the key to mystery
Pick up the runes, unveil and see
Judgment comes, before us lie
The paths of war and you may die
You have the key, cross over and see
The old and wind-cold tree
Walk the steps
And you'll hear the winds that cry
Search beyond the blinded eyes
(Listen before you preach)
Don't leave yourself behind
Honor life, when life has ceased
(Welcome the dawn)
Beware the glory tales
Hold on, don't fade away
Don't be afraid to bleed
Don't be afraid to dream
Hold on, don't fade away
Don't be afraid to bleed
Afraid to dream
Let the elders enlighten the path
They have cried for you, died for you
Ride on, ride on
Ride on, ride onAnd I finally see the light again
The light of my return
After too much time in darkness
I've had enough of being underground
By now it?s all over
Forgotten from memory
And from the heart of the living
My sepulchre has become decrepit
Decaying as my mortal remains
They are corroded by time
By vice and worms
So many years now have passed
From the last time
That someone cried
Or even prayed for me
Oooh Zombie, what do you want from us?
Oooh Zombie, why have you come back to life?
Men don't care about their dead
don't know that they've come back
Come back to kill them
don't believe that it?s all over
At the moment of burial
There is something more important
That pushes us to come back
The living cry the dead but the dead kill the living
That is the greatest day for me
The day of resurrection
I don't know who I was
I don't remember my ancient name
but now I feel a new reason
I have no fear to kill
Oooh Zombie, what do you want from us?
Oooh Zombie, is this real life?Guds Ord Fra Vr Munn, Lysets Barn, Skal Runge

A journey for all, in there distant dreams
The voice of a wise man singing in their hearts
Your pride is your mentor, honor is where it all starts
Now the wind has changed
And the fear in your eyes plagues your soul
To make your fire burn with rage forever after
Your caught in the web of desire
The will of man
And his quest for perfection
Accept the truth
In the silence of the moment
What you don't know now, you will witness someday
And what you don't feel now will be your liberator
Reach out and take what is yours
Now and forever and evermoreUpon the darkest of thrones the true God is visible
The filthy sound of ten thousand necro morbid deaths
Smear my body with your destructive visions death
Writhe in my bastard hellish tormented ego
Soak my veins in alcohol
Create the beast behind these armored walls
I shall not let others in
So pure the race
So cold but we tormented know
We know so fucking well
Not to hide yet to stay underground
You sit upon the darkest of thrones
Yet still remain as miserable, as necro
As evil, as hungry, as II want to die a brutal way
Instead of just fade away
Shredded flesh mutilated
Severed head decapitated
Ripped and torn piece by piece
Rape my corpse then leave me in peace
Shredded flesh mutilated
Severed head decapitated
I want to die
Brutally deceased brutally deceased
To die in sickness to suffer 'til death
Fulfill my wishes lay me to rest
I want to die a brutal way
Instead of just fade away
Shredded flesh mutilated
Severed head decapitated
Brutally deceased brutally deceasedThe night is strong
The light's so weak
This is where it all began
It's all the same once more
The times so dark
They reach the end
The ancient omens are now here
The golden beast is free, it's free
I seek to find
Lost piece of time
Is the dream the hidden truth
Or shadow of the past?
I fear to lose all that I have
I'm [Incomprehensible] of my own thought
And I can't find the way out
I look between the stars
I breathe between the dreams
I'm just the messenger of truth
The distant voice in dark
I see a falling star
Which makes my dreams come true
Could it be that now we have
All the time in the heart of wilderness?
Wind through the fire
Light through the dark
Now it's time to build something new
And break the wall of lies
The ruins of life I left behind
It's time to choose a brand new path
And face the myths of life
I look between the stars
I breathe between the dreams
I'm just the messenger of truth
The distant voice in dark
I see a falling star
Which makes my dreams come true
Could it be that now we have
All the time in the heart of wilderness?I saw you wedding gown
The prettiest dress
I came into the room that night
And made such a mess
In my own way, I lovingly kiss the bride
With your ring in your hand
Your eyes and your mouth open wide
In my eyes
Blood drops look like roses on white lace
They won't wash away
In my mind they're roses on white lace
Straight from the heart
So dead upon the bed
You hurt me in the deepest way
I'm crippled inside
I took your evil skin away
It's all cut and dry
I saw you tonight and carefully took your hand
With some smears on my cheeks
I knew that you would understand
In my eyes
Blood drops look like roses on white lace
They won't wash away
In my mind they're roses on white lace
Straight from the heart
So dead upon the bed, still searching for your head
They're never gonna find your face
It's hidden away
I found a very special place for you used to play
In my own way, I lovingly kiss the bride
With your ring in your hand
Your eyes and your mouth open wide
In my eyes
Blood drops look like roses on white lace
They won't wash away
In my mind they're roses on white lace
Straight from the heart
Blood drops look like roses on white lace
Crimson and sweet, stained on the sheet
Roses on white lace, pretty in red, dripping and wet
Roses on white lace, spilled on the walls, dark in the hallThey raise their fists into the sky
Many didn't suffice to bring the death to some of them
They prayed to Gods they died with pride
Some of them sufficed to bring the death to all
Their swords drilled into their skull
The blades were hungry and now have to be sharpened
And freed from strange blood
Which is precious for the clairvoyance
The barbarians prepare to leave now
To get closer, to their aimOne time, one place
You see a world
Where? pass away
Life slips through your hands in the air
Nothing stays the same
?
once left to say
broken moment just standing still
And yet you fade away
And now you can't pretend the passion of the sea
A glimmer for to rectify what you can't receive
A broken moment
Descended hero you? misery itself
?
before you?
again you wait for?
?
A tender place for one who see
? stand by your soul(Lyrics by hakansson; Music: Andersson)
The awakening of the gods
the rising of the souls
here I lie tied to my bed
awaiting the coming of ghouls
I close my eyes as if to die
entering again
the labyrinths of deep within
beyond where conscious ends
Hellish terrors risen
in the mountains of unknown
below the skies of I
sleeps a ruler in his throne
Beneath the collonades of fear
deep below his halls
in the endless realms of I
inside the entombed vaults
The insane watching eye
staring through my bones
shreds the soul out of my skin
and leaves me naked and alone
(Leads: Cederlund, Hellid)
Although my dreams have ended
as I wished in weakened thought
beyond me night is total
and through the collonades I walkDesert sand, Modern man searching for answers to the mysteries
far away night become day unlock the secrets of their lives
And through the years nature's tears wash away the pain with the rain
after all this time, oh victim of the crime
they fear a kill, a kill in the afterlife
Cross the sea to the Valley Of The Kings
men are fools never know what the future brings
gold and thieves in the Valley Of The Kings
look what you've done, oh the damage is done
Forever sleep their souls to keep entombed in dark shadows for all time
shifting sand the hands of man disturbing the peace of sacred land
And through the years nature's tears wash away the pain with the rain
They left a curse for you nothing you can do
they fear a kill, a kill in the afterlife
Cross the sea to the Valley Of The Kings
men are fools never know what the future brings
gold and thieves in the Valley Of The Kings
look what you've done, oh the damage is done
They fear a kill, a kill in the afterlife
Cross the sea to the Valley Of The Kings
men are fools never know what the future brings
gold and thieves in the Valley Of The Kings
look what you've done, oh the damage is doneYes, here is what you came for,
I know what I'm here for,
Knocked out right to the floor,
Committed to kill!
Kill what you don't know,
Can't trust, let it go
Say what you mean
Don't ask what's the story!
You'll be knocked out right to the floor.
Committed to kill!
Kill what you don't know,
Can't trust, let it go
The God damned hypocrisy
My story's in yours,
Throw at me what you got,
'Cause I will break free, from all the words that bind me
My story is in yours,
Throw at me what you got,
'Cause I will break free, from all the words that bind me

My consciousness; dead to rights,
Fuck suicide,
Living along side you, yeah!
So, get what you came for,
Locked up on the floor,
Get straight at the door,
Get yourself more inventive!
Say what you mean
Don't ask what's the story!
You'll be knocked out right to the floor.

Dead to rights!
Don't take it too personal
Is just that trouble is coming
Yeah!
You know it could be God damn true!
I got you dead to rights!
I got you dead to rights!
I got you!
I got you dead to rights!
I got you dead to rights!I exist in a constant dreamstate
Where my mind is free to wander
The answers come so easily
To all the of the questions pondered
I'm not held down by this body
I'm not tethered to this Earth
The spirit realm is my playground
Master of the universe
We're out of body and out of our minds
Shit out of luck and out of time
Every day in this world seems exactly the same
Nothing learned or achieved, just the same old routine
I take a breath, set this shell to autopilot
Let my soul fly freely, may the Great Spirits guide it
I take a breath, set this shell to autopilot
Let my soul fly freely, may the Great Spirits guide it
All this noise and everything you say
Does not concern me, I'm miles away
Not searching for anything in particular
Just thumbing through the Akashic Records
Access to all knowledge as needed
All that was and all that will be
Seeing past the illusion of time
The potential of what we all could be
I take a breath, set this shell to autopilot
Let my soul fly freely, may the Great Spirits guide itWe rule the streets after dark fast silent like a shark
The 1200 I got between my knees
My hog helps me to spread the disease
People don't understand hair,
And leather but I'm telling you I couldn't be living better
I don't fear nothin' with my brothers on my side
Fuck with us and it's suicide
Live your life by your will learn to be an animal
By the light of the moon beware the legion of doom
We only ask to be left alone
Having good times getting stoned
Pulling some broad and guzzlin' buds
Riding high into the sunFuel is running, fuel is coming
Fuel is running
Down, down, down my face
The line, the line
The line is drawn in the sand
It won't be long
We have to be strong
Before they drop
The final bomb
Before they drop
The final bomb

For something that wasn't mine
You know what, what that means
You've been there, there with me
You know what, what that means
You've been there, there with me
When you're empty, empty inside
You don't think if it's wrong or right
I really wanted so I took it
I know that wasn't too very smart
It was there so I went for it
Again no one saw us do it
It was there so I went for it
Again no one saw us do it
They couldn't even, even catch s
We were being very careful this time
You don't have to be angry in me
Oh, sweet lady, please, set me free
And justify, justify, justify, justify meMy chains are paper thin, and they're welded with ink
Sealed inside a legal trap, so tight blood don't leave
A contract with a devil, for a life of disdain
See me in the limelight, an indentured slave
I blame myself.
God! Help me pour this gas on me!
I need to drown in flames to be free!
Help me pour this gas on me! (x4)
Choke another product for the mass to consume
The flocks of mindless sheep that have been corporately groomed
Ignorance through apathy like drones in the hive
A slave on the prayer wheel in conformed disguise
I blame myself
God! Help me pour this gas on me!
I need to drown in flames to be free!
Help me pour this gas on me!
I sold my soul, I sold my soul... (x11)
God! Help me pour this gas on me!
I need to drown in flames to be free!
Help me pour this gas on me! (x4)Wardrum pounded and signed the hordes
Battalions gathered and prayed their lords
The war started and lasted years
Pain was there but they hided their tears
Death in the woods and bombs in the air
It slaughtered the innocence that once was there
They fought like beasts and many of them fell
Ceased to exist in the frontline hell
They stopped showing their emotions, those dulging eyes
Left only the fear of death from the skies
See a dying soul in that distant flare
And the child inside has been left alone to die
Look closer to see he doesn't care
For they came here to battle and not to cry
From cradle to grave shall thee march in vain
Your fate is never to see what's in the end of this lane
Only light you see is your machinegun fire
"To let the reaper get me is my only desire"
"Come with me and I'll take you there
I shall lead you away to another nightmare"
A blinding light and a voice from the sky
"Abandon him for his kingdom is a lie
Follow the light and I'll set you free
Ride on my wings, put your faith in me"
"My mission is not completed I aim to kill
A task of death I shall fulfill"
You've chosen the path that takes you down
Where slaves are kings and the other way aroundPar sem fleiri stjÃ³rna

This is slaughter
I can't touch her
You wear me out
You wear me out
And I know that it's a mistake
My body's lonely
I know that it's a mistake
Gripping the blade 'til it cuts through
I tried to hide you
And that's not fair gripping my heart
You're a lush and your tongue's always tainted
You're an artist
You're so overrated
Running and running away
It served its purpose
It's not your perspective
It's mine
It's only getting worse by the hour
It's only substance to pass the time
A meaning that lacks no meaning at all
Still revolving around its center
Without ever caring or wondering why
I know it's just me and my wandering mind
A terrible thing to waste
And a terrible thing to hide
Still I'm afraid to be someone I'm not
I can't change the presence it's all that I got
Down on your knees you look so good
With a face like that it's hard to go wrong
If you love me to pieces, the pieces fit
And this all was about youAnxiety's calling
You live near your fellow to escape yourself
You try to be proud of it
As a virtue, I can read in your lack of sense
Living, screaming, all you do is useless
You're anxious about your fellow
And you've back beautiful words
Your ill love around him
Is nothing more than hate of yourself
Searching your ego
Is the better way to know yourself
You have to be proud of it
As a virtue to be a man
Living, screaming, all you do is useless
You're anxious about your fellow
And you've back beautiful words
Your ill love around him
Is nothing more than hate of yourself
Freedom of being us
Set us free from pain and fears
We found more than ourselves now
You're anxious about your fellow
And you've back beautiful words
Your ill love around him
Is nothing more than hate of yourselfHook: 8x

THOUGHTS OF AN ICENI GLADIATOR,
AWAITING THE OPENING OF THE ARENA PORTCULLIS:
MEMORIES OF REBELLION (CARNAGE AT CAMULODUNUM):
ICENI MESSENGER:
Hearken! The Ninth Legion has been put to the sword!
The war-Chief of Queen Boudicca: Onwards to Camulodunum...
wet your swords! Redden the earth with Roman blood!
I remember the carnage at Camulodunum...
The glorious clash of Celtic sword against Roman gladius,
The pride in the eyes of our war-queen
As we hacked down the Imperial Eagle,
And the severed heads of centurions gaping atop our spears.
BLOODSHED AND BATTLE: 61 AD (C.E.)
???
We certainly taught the arrogant invading dogs a lesson, at any rate.
The omens and portents spoke of vast bloodshed and great carnage,
and after our slaughterous victories at Camulodunum (the Temple
of Claudius burned wonderfully!), Londinium and Verulanium,
the cursed Romans finally dared to meet us honourably upon the field
of war at Mandeussedum. They sent fifteen thousand legionaires,
their armour gleaming like gold in the sun... but it would still yield to our
swords and spears, no matter how it sparkled.
The Roman scoundrel, Governor Suetonius Paullinus,
battle-scarred from his campaigns against the Druids,
was able to choose the ground upon which to make his stand,
and so it was that he selected as the battlefield a narrow valley,
fronted by a flat plain, with dense woodland at its rear. Aye...
Mandeussedum, "the place of the chariots"... I remember it vividly.
???
We were swelled by our victories,
empowered by our noble cause,
enraged with the battle frenzy;
thirsting to take as many Roman heads
as our bright blades could sever!
And yet we were perhaps somewhat overconfident that day...
ABDUCTED FROM THE ICENI:
In the aftermath of our defeat at Mandeussedum,
I was captured by Romans with a veiled intent...
(though three of them died at my hands in the attempt!)
Nero was growing bored with the gladiators,
slaves and lion-fodder at his great Circus,
and so had requested Suetonius Paullinus
to provide the citizens of Rome with new entertainment...
The Emperor had heard much of the wildness and fighting spirit
of these barbaric Britons who had brought such woe to his far-famed legions;
these painted, pagan tribesmen who had resisted the Empire's iron fist
where the glorious phalanxes of the East had not.
"Agents of the Imperium... hearken to my words", Nero had demanded.
"Bring to Rome some of these tribesman for the Games. Let us pit them
against our most ravenous beasts and our greatest gladitorial champions."
And so I was taken in fetters aboard a Roman trireme,
the blood of slain legionaires still crusted upon my thews,
I was taken far from the fens of my beloved homeland,
to tread the sun baked sand of the Circus Maximus...
to fight for my life in the Imperial Arena.
ARRIVAL AT THE CIRCUS MAXIMUS:
The Circus Maximus was certainly a splendid sight, I'll admit.
A vast colosseum with great stone columns and tiers,
huge ornate arches and mighty statues of grey marble.
Countless people filled the seats surrounding the sandy floor of the Arena...
and in his opulent royal enclosure, flanked by gleaming guards
and grovelling lackeys, sat the great Emperor himself...
EMPEROR NERO:
Fight, barbarian outlander!
Please us, and mayhap Mars will smile on thee this day!
ICENI WARRIOR:
Bah! I do not hail to your Roman gods, and you are not my emperor!
By Cernunnos, the blood of my enemies shall stain the sand
of this cursed arena red this day!
THE COMBAT COMMENCES:
They unleashed the lions first. Hunger maddened beasts,
goaded into a frenzy by the cruel point of many a pilum...
And yet my own hunger, the hunger for revenge, was greater,
and my honed steel was sharper than bestial fang and claw.
And so they ranged their finest warriors against me.
Three more iron gates around the arena yawned open,
and they strode from the colosseum tunnels amidst
a cacophony of cheering from the assembled Roman spectators,
urged on and showered with mar tial adulation from the massed
arena crowd, who howled their bloodlust without cessation.
???
Far above, upon his great dias,
the Emperor gave the signal for the combat to begin,
and with the battle-lust engulfing me,
with the red mist swirling before my eyes,
I vowed to my northern gods that I would show these leering
Romans the fighting spirit and battle prowess of my people...
I would leave the arena littered with the bloody corpses of my opponents...
I would cast off the imperial fetters and return to the fens!
Aye, I would escape, and make all Romans fear my name,
and compel Nero to rue the day Julius Caesar had first ordered
his legions across the grim grey sea to my ancient island...
Blood For Boudicca... Carnage For Cernunnos!!
To be continued...For fear my eyes are closed
I'll shut this out no more
Embrace this and I become the catalyst
And now it swells in me
Smash all my defenses down
I'll take this I'll let this fire consume me
I will not fall I will not fail
I pound the walls I shake the cage
I will not fall I will not fail
Let this fire consume me
This burning passion it fills me with desire
And drives me and it drives my cause
I'm filled with reasons but reasons drive me further
Disdain for disbelief will stay the course
Oh, let the fire consume me
Let the fire burn
Let the courage flow through me
Let the fire burn4 am... mother earth sleep in her dream
the gentle sound of rain send shivers down my spine
the windown upstairs bring in the breeze
oh i know there's a world waiting empty and cold
CHORUS:
i keep on thinking, i keep on waiting
i keep on loosing my trust in you
'cos i am always one step behind the truth
no more i'm thinking, once more i'm waiting
no more i'm crying after you
i will find another way to see what's the truth
sometimes i imagine, well sometimes i'm not sure
am i really flying or down here searching for
some way to dissappear million miles away
to say goodbye and call it a dayThree times the eclipse
Before she lays her soul to rest
Channelling the darkness of many nights
All this was once her dream
See and feel
The blackened blade of revenge
Cold white towering mountains
The passage to the land of phantoms
Deep forlorn woods
Where the gleam of neither light or -
Bliss reach
The castle lies in the mist
Between the mountain and marshes
Throughout the last centuries
Have the moonshine enlightened her coffin
Black soul of the hunter
The hungering thirst
The enchantress of the night
The hungering thirst
Evil, devour its soul
Since the medieval times
Have your shadow haunted:b-b-b-babe, you were treating me like a thief
your hold on me, i couldn't leave
i was chained by your smile
i couldn't resist running that extra mile
no chance to run away
i felt my heart slowly begin to decay
you were abusing my innocence
your glance insured, i had no chance
your touch shattered all resistance
i stumbled around like in a trance
i decided to go, although my will was low
she pleaded on her knees to get me to stay
i hated her for my plight
so i took the knife, my problem ended that night
i'll never forget that sight
from now on i'll be in flight
now i am far away
i know i may never return
in my own fantasy
my heart will always burn
ten thousand miles away - escaping from your spell
the trace you leave is like a desease
ten thousand miles away - escaping from your spell
i will ever remember, remember well!Cold wind, sad moonrise
Dark clouds in the sky
Storm ends the mouring time
Howling in the night
Vision of the land
After the horid end
We build again from the start
Holy lenient heart
A treasure of the land
Torments have brought the end
We build again from the start
Holy lenient heart
Visions come from the sea
Oceans bring to me
I reach the sand with a kiss
Treasures bristling from a blissHindsight
These are the same things born from the last time
And now its here and its fueled yet its falling apart
And you feel this, lord how you know this
It seems to me like the whole things falling away
Pre
And you feel it, lord how you know it
Now its everything of the way it should be
And it feels like, hair on the livestock
All at the same time
Chorus (1)
With my own eyes I see inside
And pushed it all away
Small white lies
In everything you say
Cause I don't want it
To feel this way
Small white lies
In everything you say
What you say
All of the same things died on the first time
And now its gone like the drive so taken from me
And you feel this, lord how you know this
It seems to me like the whole things runnin' away
Pre
And you feel it, lord how you know it
Now its all around and drained the life out of me
And it feels like, hair on the livestock
All at the same time
Chorus (1)
With my own eyes I see inside
And pushed it all away
Small white lies
In everything you say
Cause I don't want it
To feel this way

What it's doing to me
What you say
What it's doing to me

Small white lies
In everything you say
Cause I don't want it
To feel this way
Small white lies
In everything you say

With my own eyes
I've pushed it all away
Small white lies in

Small white lies
In everything you sayUgh alright

Living in the past
Faded pictures of yesterday
My best and worst memories
Will be forever here
Another night - Bleak fading lights
Im growing old with them
Burning grief consumates me
Im falling to dust
Another day - Is turning grey
Tonight I burn my pictures
When I come home
from these useless days
And I dream of past joys
Then I fall again into loneliness
And my blood streams in remembrance
When I cry into darkness
And my scars release blood
Sometimes you would have wantes to die
To let me the last good memories of you
A desert inside
Cold blue dust is falling on my eyes
Im flying away
Dreaming of those bittersw!
eet days
Now I watch these opened wounds
For every cut i bur
n another fear
Both we were painful scars,
drops of blood falling in an endless sea of sadness.Goat burned god of plagues
In thy name I carve my flesh
I wish to be reborn!
Cast your darkness so I can see the light
Let it perforate my soul
the sun will set no more...
Lay me down on the bed of death
Allow me to return redeemed
Quench my thirst with vigorous bile
Bestow upon me hate
Hostis Humani GenerisAs I see their faith
I'm growing stronger with time
Some never had a chance
Their lives were taken away
Everything they had
They stood the true test of faith
And I won't back down
I'll go from where they left off
And I will see it through
The media's lies can't cover the truth
Our lives, they are our sacrifice
Already died to self
I live for no one else
Where they left offSONG ABOUT KILLING
i'm here to kill
i'm here to die
i feel this pain
i have this hate
you teach me love
you teach me fear
but now you getting it all back,
(and my reasons are just trivial...)
try to run away
but belive me,to die is your fate...
REF:
this song is about killing
a loveletter just for you
lets make it right
lets make it clear
no- one wants you here!!!
all i want is to kill
i want you dead
the price is too high
my life's to short
(i'm sick of hunting you)
you are my shadow
you are my demon
you have to burn for my joy
i'll watch you burn
so you better run,before i'll watch you burn
try to run away
but belive me,to die is your fate...
REF:
this song is about killing
a loveletter just for you
lets make it right
lets make it clear
no- one wants you here!!!Cross the line of dirty minds
Walk through the flowers and colourful mountains
Where you sense the odour of the sky
Where you touch it with your fingers
Breathe in the air that the sky gives to you
Sense the smell of heavenly plants
In mountain's garden made for people like us
Where an artist creates his priceless pieces
It will sink into blackness, it will die
Take what life offers you today
For tomorrow it may not be here
Maybe only there we can find peace, prosperity
Towards the blue mountains
White like dew and blue like rain
Prosperity, the passage back to life
It's human hand...the kingdom before the lies
Take me, let me feel
When will the real kingdom come?[Turbonegro Cover]
[Bonus Track]Hoy no es una noche comun
en el viento puedes escuchar
el lamento de Saturno
perdiendose en la piel estelar
Hoy no es una noche comun
en la niebla puedes observar
la silueta de Saturno
girando en su propia sombra
Lo invade la tristeza, lo invade el dolor
lo invade el odio, la traicion, el rencor
En un mar de lagrimas
El lamento de Saturno
Hoy no es una noche comun
en el viento puedes inhalar
el rocio de la traicion
que le ah marchitado el alma
Lo invade la tristeza, lo invade el dolor
lo invade el odio, la traicion, el rencor
En un mar de lagrimas
El lamento de Saturno
Hoy las estrellas parecen no brillar mas
Perdido entre la ficion y la realidad
Saturno sofoca en las sombras
de la traicionFlying silent on winter wings
Flowing emotions from my bleeding soul
Tears that flow burn my skin
I'm drifting away on the cold wave of desolation
I'm touching the wind as it sadly sings
Carried to the disant unknown
Eternity awaits me...
My heart is so cold
Emotions reached their freezing point
..Only pure hate
Lost all that I was living for
Crying without sound
Thy sky has frozen to ice
As the last drops of blood leave my body
I hear the winter breath
I'm the face of the night
I'm all alone
The fullmoon is glowing
Snow falls from the sky
I feel the eternal winter
Holocaust winds are rising
Like a dark northern breeze
My cryptic journey has just begunDo not leave. Leave me weak. Do not leave me alone with this loony they say is me.
A mooncalf - I am in panic, I am manic. A changeling. Pinioned, crippled. I am, believe.
I can't come to terms with the terrestrials. I can't come to terms with me.
A lifetime's worth of tears gathered up in me. I've been on the verge of tears all my life. How can you be me?
I'm postponing my life again as so many times before. Self-pity is my substitute for others mercy. Contempt is my comfort.Born to hate
Living my life ending yours
Love to hate
Utilized the light with lies
I breed hate
suffer
I am reality I am the bringer of eternal hate
I bring hate
Upon your church upon your cross
Eternal hate
You're heavenly children
You raised to be week as you
Brain washed Christians
In the bible they live
My hate against your children
Is what i live for
To give them misery
That's what i am here for
I breed hate
I am reality I am the bringer of eternal hate
I bring hate
Upon your church upon your cross
Eternal hate
The light will soon be dead
Darkness prevails
Fire walk this way
The armies of hate
God won't save you now
No answer you get
Your prayers a waste of time
Heaven is dead
Now i bring down god
With sin after sin
Dismember his children
Killing all of his love
My armies of hatred
Will forever stand tall
I breed hate eternal hate
Born to hate
Living my life ending yours
Love to hate
Utilized the light with lies
I breed hate
SufferFleshless I crawl
Drifting alone
By the realm of the living
Eternal I have become
I will never die
I shall nourish the unborn
Shadowed until the end of time
Twilight is upon me
And deep below I lay
I accept my fast it comes
Why should I be afraid to die
Soon my night will fall
Only dreams remain
Through another day
Seems so lonely
In this cold domain
Tainted by my sinful past
Shadows over me it casts
They very power of my soul
Will last until we all shall fall
Painful as it is
I have to realise
I'm not the only one
There is thousands more to die
Only grief remains
With hate I will pass away
To my land of dreams
Thus it shall stand until we all shall fall
We all shall fall[Van der Laars/Bruinenberg/Parry]
Watch out... I feel the strain
Arms in the air, pointing at me
No doubt... am I to blame
I swear it's the truth, my life's not a game
Against the wall...
Waiting for someone to come, and crucify me
I'll take it all...
If humiliation is worse, than all the pain
Sweet revenge is all they seek
Never smile, they never speak
But pretend to be your friend
Then strike you down
Sweet revenge, hatred deep
Say a prayer, then watch you weep
Strong, the mighty, one and all
Each one will fall
Too late, the chase has begun
My every move, they're right behind me
It's never fate, when damage is done
To the bitter sweet end
'Til the battle is won
I'm standing tall...
Freedom and justice have gone, they stripped it from me
I'll take 'em all...
The courage to fight everyone
'Til truth prevailsLost in the shadows
Left with a broken dream
The fire turns to smoke inside a silent scream
No God to follow
Nothing from all those years
There is only pain to fill our darkest fears
Our eyes are bleeding
The blind must lead the fool
And now we know we're locked inside a dying room
We are all hearing
The tolling bells of doom
And now we know we're locked inside a dying room
The dying roomStop pushing your faith, spreading disease, for it falls on calloused minds and empty stares
Bow to your icon, made from the clay, tainted by the lies and cold hypocrises
You shun away all their beliefs yours is the one true answer
I'd like to take them all and flush them all away
Why can't you see how blatantly they purify corruption
Just steer away, away from me, don't you see
Your prayer infuriates my anger, so I will find my savior
Right or wrong, I'm on my own, I will stand so strong
So strong
Watch your blue skies fall, within morality, believe reality will keep your faith
As long as it pours from your essence
I believe that there is one, but the robe that he wears
Is handmade, and not their polyester fiction
How ignorant are your beliefs, you think that you're so righteous
I'd like to take them all and flush them all away
You close your eyes and fold your hands, dropping down on your weakened knees
I turn around so all knowing you won't see
Your prayer infuriates my anger, so I will find my savior
Right or wrong, I'm on my own, I will stand so strong
So strong, standing strong, standing strong
Push away, push away as if everyone's standing strong
Push away, push away as if everyone's standing strong, standing strong, standing strong
Standing Strong
Your prayer infuriates my anger, so I will find my savior
Right or wrong, I'm on my own, I will stand so strong
So strong, standing strong, standing strong, standing strong, standing strong
Push away, push away as if everyone's standing strong
Push away, push away as if everyone's going deaf.Deep within my bleeding heart
Stranded by the hold of fear
Agony takes a final role
Sipping the dew of tears
Thorns and rites idols of false
Tearing apart the skin of lust
Forever still but never born
Broken by the final quest
Vanity, silent choir spreading lies
Vanity, fallen shrine of muted sighs
Surrender, dance and cry
Their Tormented eyes perceive
Grasps of fright, lusters crawl
Tarnished grounds of faded beliefsCan you save my soul a little while ?
Your words and sins will cure it
If you just try.
Can you be the guardian of my flame ?
Don't ever let it be apeased by the rain.
I am an angel
Who's burned his wings staying too close to hell
Can you help me find my way back to myself
Sometimes I feel I'm lost inside someone else.
Can you bring back colors into my world ?
You're like the rainbow in the winter's cold.
I am an angel
Who cannot seem to be in phase with heaven
Teach how to fly again,
My wings are trapped inside my brain.
You're the one who ease my pain
You can help me fly again.
Take me to your own universe,
And put an end to this curse.
Thee used to be a time
When I could reach the stars at the speed of light
But like Icarus, I've been too close, too soon,
to a burning sun...
Fly...I cannot sit back, shed my broken skin curse my pride
I react play yourself again up down and down again
You live in a computer, you're an instant man
Judged and told I can't cut your shallow hands
How can I please all of your needs?
What do you see when you see me?
I can't reach you
Step back, heard your point of view
Stand up, lay down for no one
Take a piece of me with you
Step back, now that I know you
I know, you're down for no one
I bow down to no one, you like the faith
Stand behind me, find your way, you know you will decide
To move on with me or step aside I could have lost my life
And I'm ready to risk it one more time
How can I please all of your needs?
What do you see when you see me?
I can't reach you
Step back, heard your point of view
Stand up, lay down for no one
Take a piece of me with you
Step back, now that I know you
I know, you're down for no one
I can't reach you
Step back, heard your point of view
Stand up, lay down for no one
Take a piece of me
Take a piece of me
Take a piece of me with you[Intro]
So hard, this is harder than you know
But we we remember everything
It's tough to let it go
[Verse 1]
Think of the nights we spent when we were all alone
They remember everything
It's tough to let it go
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Here we are again, falling for it
Here we are again and we're falling for it
[Chorus 1]
You won't find me there
Cause I'm already gone
Looking for what's left to hang on
Where did we go...
[Verse 2]
Now all that we have left unsaid [?]
Monuments of memories to those we left behind
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Here we are again and we're falling for it
[Chorus 2]
You won't find me there
Cause I'm already gone
Looking for what's left to hang on
Where did we go wrong
You won't find me there
Cause I'm already gone
Looking for what's left to hang on
Where did we go wrong
[Bridge]
So wrong, this is harder than we know
But we remember everything
It's tough to let it go
Here we are again, again
[Chorus 2]
You won't find me there
Cause I'm already gone
Looking for what's left to hang on
Where did we go wrong
You won't find me there
Cause I'm already gone
Looking for what's left to hang on
Where did we go wrongBone collector, death extractor, splatterdeath, hammerdeath
Razorsharp tentacles crawling up your ass
We are the warcult
Timebomb intellectuals
New millennium battlebots squeeze out your brains
Hoax virus infected megalomaniax
We are the warcult
We are the shit for brains
We are the warcult
The poison in your brain
Like a landmine in your grave
We are the warcult
The poison in your brain
Like a landmine in your graveI walk alone through burning towns
My sword is in my hand
But the battle has been lost
And there is nothing to defend
At Culloden in seventeen fourty six
Scotlands fate was sealed
We wrote a bloody history
Wounds that never healed
[Chorus:]
Fight for death or glory
Fight at culloden muir
Die in pain and anger
Die in pain and anger
I still see Gillis MacBean
Standing wounded from the fight
Back to the wall he fought
And thirteen Redcoats died
But the Clans were beaten and destroyed
Their wives are raped in shame
Prince Bonnie's on the fight again
The rising was invane
We were a people free and brave
Heroes stood tall
But history is mercyless
Now we are to doomed to fall
The battle of culledon
The end of Scotland"Ascending through time and space
Oh great cosmos, hand me the key
Contemplating the fabric of your architecture
Oh great all, I see the key you hold
Unreachable for me... now
But I know, I know...
Your eternal ocean of infinite blazing lights
The stillness of your empty motions
Waves of eternity soothes unto my shell
Calming me as I see the reflection of my earthly leave
Entwining me with the continuous structure of time
Knowledge of ages compressed into my state of being
Rising into a higher stream of consciousness
Crowning me into the corestones of "heaven"
Facing me with old, embittered entities
Higher beings, driven insane in the mighty river of eternity
Pitiful creatures, I wash them away... falling down they are
No more tyranny,
No more games,
No more... No more
But despite this freeing of the kingdoms of Dragonland
Emptiness I feel, hollow inside I can't take on the throne alone
The sorrow of my dear still rages in my heart...
I'll end my existence, let me pass unto the other side
Where my bleeding heart will find peace in your loving embrace
Thou art my angel, my only one... together we are the KEY
And thus eternity's saga ends..."Illogical laws and rules without a meaning
Only created to be an obstacle in our life
Democracy to live free, stupid to believe
'cause the government watches every step of us
Corrupt politicians, easy to buy
Makin' decisions without asking for our opinion
Blinded by lies, hypnotized by illusions
They cheat us out of our freedom
Our Oppression - There's no discussion
Our Oppression - There's no discussion
Why is this called democracy?
We think that the power of decision is in our hands
But those who rule are not the ones we chose
Our Oppression, a legal requirement?
Our Oppression - There's no discussion
Our Oppression - There's no discussion
Our Oppression - There's no discussion
Our Oppression - There's no discussionI'm dreaming of the lights, coming from behind
The clouded's getting clearer, it's closer all the time
Darker, taller, bigger, all blackness under wing
Reaping holy profits from the fear of absolutely nothing
Bloodbath, no one here will miss
The stench of your abyss
Bloodbath, the blood is never yours
Whores, your followers
I hear the people coming, I hear them down the hall, hell
They're banging at my door, what do they got to sell
Everything moves slowly, I feel trapped and powerless
My body weighs a thousand pounds and I cannot confess
The door is crashing open, it's ripping from the wall
No matter what I do I seem to do nothing at all
The lights are getting brighter and they won't go away
The voice is getting louder and there's no need to pray
I think the world is stumbling, I think I feel it shake
There's something in the room
But there's nothing left to break
The blackness getting bigger than the serpent's universe
Ruthless angels lie and steal and spread the catholic curseRaum an dies hellblau Stechlin,

A gazing maze in creations plane, the mirrored sea unleashed,
Chaos divine with evil behind, a serpents mind crystallised,
Caressing the shadows with mind dancing signs,
Scattering through realms in fearful disguise.
For the feather is mine, astral chimes divine,
Kissing with reaper smiles, signs obey,
The infinite abyss mirrored in scarry skies,
The entity between creates the maze.
The maze of gaze through spectral coming age,
Spiritual divinity the watcher grows afraid,
A plane of sexual chemical diversions,
Perversions mirrored and mamned.
A flowing field, surrounded withering fate,
Disharmony breeds in splendour, of hate adventures,
coiled in semen creations of dream state demination,
I poison the foundation of order and procriation.Insipid fumes bellow
from the atrabilious
chimney.
In the sanetified
crevet I calmly pillage
and rake
for hot dry
powdered human slag
still steaming in the
crematorium's grate.
Bio-organic ebullition,
bones tar, tallow dehydrates
for my deleterious horticulture
so that I may cultivate..
Your mortal mechanism dies
in nutrients rich.
In the hallowed turf you lie
just for the taking.
Charred sinews
as good as lime,
no phosphates do I need.
Deteriorated flesh
used as top-soil
to replenish and
nourish seed.
Spreading this human potash
as ash matured.
Recycling my rich harvest.
Bring out your dead...
for use as manure!
Irrigating tears are shed.
But the ground must be fed.
And there's no rest for the dead.
Tipping and dusting up
the spilt contents of urns.
Every morsel that glows
as embers in the fire.
Extinguishing all hope
of beautrific dispatch.
These charred chassis desired.
Exequiet rites performed.
A coronach sooting up the flu.
Enter my execrable inferno.
Even in the after-life
there's work to do.
The nitrogen content high
the flesh is weak.
At the graveside mourners cry.
You're never to wake again.
Burnt brisket renews
the ground
to germinate my seed.
Cremated bodies
are my spoil
to use them as plant feed.
Ploughing this abhorrant
human manure.
Seedling my rich harvest.
Bring out your dead
for the soils to devour.
Dry the dead are bled.
because the ground
must be fed.
Still no rest for the dead.
I propagate
Dust in the grate.
Ashes to ashes.
Dust to dust.
Diluted in water
and sprayed on crops.
Charcoal, fats,
flesh and soot
fertilising pastures
with active furtile rot.
Incumbent.
Latent calories are spent.
Ashes to ashes.
Dust to dust.
Renewing the land
with corpses corrupt.
Mortuary scrapings,
hearses a must.
To the hot hearth
the diseased are trussed.
Harvesting the defouled
to fertilise the soil.
Rejuvenating the spent
with my fecundate spoils...
Reaping the gone
to nourish the land.
Replenishing exhausted pastures
with my uncanny sleight of hand.
Restoring the unnatural balance.
sowing my seed.
Defalcating the departed
I rapt and glean.
So I recite my contrite lament.
Lacrimation for the dead.
Their rest which I disturb.
Where should stand row upon row
of cold grey remembrance stones
my cash crops now grow.Long live the Fremen Warriors!!!
"Hidden away in the desert
The prophecy is becoming real
A man will come, the messiah
Who will lead us to true freedom"
Oh, my time has come
I'm the one you are waiting for
I will lead to victory
The universe super being of planet Dune
I will bring death eternal
And my name is a killing word
I am the hand of God
Who will lead you all to true freedom
Oh, my time has come
I'm the one you are waiting for
I will take the Water of Life
The Spice will let the sleeper rise
Long live the fighters, holy warriors
Follow me now! And we will take control
Master of the universe, ruler of infinity
I summon the sand worms, I unite the Freman and
[Chorus]
Ride like a leader of men, true leader that ride
Like a leader of men, true leader of men
Like a leader of men, true leader that ride
Like a leader of men, true leader of men
Long live the fighters, holy warriors
Follow me now! And we will take control
Master of the universe, ruler of infinity
I summon the sand worms, I unite the Freman and

Ride like a leader of men, true leader that ride

Like a leader of men, true leader of men
I ride like a leader of menYou can sink or you can swim
On the streets of New Orleans
Over heard the horror stories
of Nicaragua jails
Devil's got a voodoo doll
Sticking needles through your face
Wrath of late Marie Leveau
Leave em pissing down your leg
Chorus:
Heads will roll
We rip it up
Uphuckinsuck (x2)
Because we rule
& rip it up
Uphuckinsuck (x2)
Tearing through every set
Like it's the last we'll play
Stuff those fucks in body bags
& send them on their way
No one digs a super kook
Jacking our parade
Speed ball and go Belushi
Let a dumpster be your grave (x2)
Chorus
Over dose of reality
That's the cure for your disease
Uphuckinsuck (x2)Who was the one that stood beside you through the war of your life
Who stood defiant in the face of your enemy
Who was the one you could confide in when your adversaries made you run and hide
There's no messiah out there waiting to deliver you now
You've lost the war and have surrendered your sanity
What was before has now been scattered from the heavy devastation left behind
You made it happen again
Threw your cover away
Built battlements to stand for all time
You've waged your war of lies
Discarded your disguise
I was the one you said could never be a part of your life
I was the one who had a moment of clarity
Only a son could stay devoted to a fabricator living their own lies
The ones who loved you can no longer be a part of you now
You're very deft at trying to garner their sympathy
Look how affection will reveal the shadowy image of the criminal inside
You made it happen again
Threw your honor away
You may never learn until you're denied
You've waged your war of lies
Discarded your disguise
Seen through damnation's eyes
You blame me for your lies
You don't get it, you won't let it
You won't ever admit your fucking lie
You don't get it, I won't let it
I won't believe this time
You've waged your war of lies
Discarded your disguise
Seen through damnation's eyes
You blame me for your lies
You've waged your war of lies
Discarded your disguise
Seen through damnation's eyes
You blame me for your liesI can't deny
That my heart is searching
And with every try
I can feel my hatred burning
What makes a believer
When it takes no faith to be free
Is there a deceiver
Leading us into alacrity
Where are you?
We can't find our freedom
Within this agony
Even if this faith could heal
It are we who suffer again
We don't need no freedom
Cause we pay for hypocrisy
Even you know in the end
We who suffer again
You should be a saviour
Once on earth to bleed for the weak
Try Modern behaviour
For a world that cannot seek
This fallen belief I know
Has no prospect
We will never achieve to grow
If carry on hiding
What is deep inside of usDistance decreases as if time is a dying cockroach
Plagues enclose
Sitting upon this wooden bench, I am helpless to billions of bullets
In this moment I am helpless
Why is it so difficult to see ourselves?
No poem I've wrote, Nor song I have sung, can halt the army of wrath
Numbers Numbers Numbers Numbers
In this moment I am helpless
Serpents will transform into mice only to drown in the deepest red
I've always expresses my thoughts in colors, but we remain blind
Numbers Numbers Numbers NumbersRaised to be
Placed among scared-confused minds
Became one of those without realizing
Not the one-who used to be
Slowly turned somwhere else, some place
Where you can't reach the source of mystery
Unable to let you know that it was enough
There's no you
You got closed inside
With the entire world
So-tere's-no-reason-to-look-outside-anymore
But still not courageusenou to move on
By following the deep tendencies
Merely a mistake
Steep lechaseNo restraint - on the edge of insanity
Greed - never enough for the rich life
Slowness - flesh is heavy and frail
Seven deadly sins - Seven dreams
Seven gates to hell - Seven days
Seven world wonders - Seven signs
Seven years bad luck - Seven lifes
Anger - blood boiling out of wrath and power
Arrogance - being better than others
Sensuality - devoted to the flesh
Envy - begrudge everyone else
Seven deadly sins - Seven dreams

Seven world wonders - Seven signs
Seven years bad luck - Seven lifes
- Seven - seven - seven -
Seven deadly sins - Seven dreams
Seven gates to hell - Seven days
Seven world wonders - Seven signs
Seven years bad luck - Seven lifes
Gluttony - never behold the end
Avarice - the eternal yearning for more
Sloth - learned to love the easy life
Rage - ignoring human loss
Pride - blindness before the fall
Lust - dedicated to passion
Jealousy - confirmation of possessionSinking in my bed,
Staring at the ceiling while I try to sleep.
The voices in my head are telling me the meaning of the secrets you keep.
I can't forget the words you said,
they're stuck inside my head.
I'm living a lie.
I thought I knew everything about you
but this is something new.
I didn't expect it.
I thought I knew all about myself.
This is how it ends here.
Another me. Another you.
Never felt so weak.
Haunted by the feelings and the memories.
How could you let me down like this?
(Oh no, no)
I can't forget the words you said,
they're stuck inside my head.
I'm living a lie.
I thought I knew everything about you
but this is something new.
I didn't expect it.
I thought I knew all about myself.
This is how it ends here.
Another me. Another you.
I might be blind but my heart can see.
This situation doesn't work for me.
I might be deaf but my heart can hear.
I guess that something's got to give.
I thought I knew everything about you
but this is something new.
I didn't expect it.
I thought I knew all about myself.
This is how it ends here.
Another me. Another you.Hey mÃÂ­rame why dime la verdad
MÃÂ­rame a los ojos con eso me bastara
A veces las cosas no son lo que parecen
Why tampoco importa lo que diga la gente
Na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na
Son cosas entre tu why yo
Why estoy loco por ti
No te vayas por favor
Lo eres todo para mi
El silencio nos separo
Ya nada es como ayer
Tal vez el culpable fui yo
No sabia lo que iba a perder
Son cosas entre tu why yo
Why estoy loco por ti
No te vayas por favor
Lo eres todo para mi
Que es lo que me pasa
Que es lo que me pasa
Que es lo que me pasa
Que es lo que me pasa
Son cosas entre tu why yo
Why estoy loco por ti
No te vayas por favor
Lo eres todo para miWhen it comes down to the wire
No one will help, every man for himself
When it comes down t the wire
You have to do what you can for yourself
There's a contract out on me
Now there's no safe place to be
I'm on the run all day and night
Laying low, staying out of sight
I'm not sure if I can take it
I don't know if I can make it
All the money in the world
Can't buy a true friend
When it comes down, down to the wire
When it comes down, down to the wire
I'm so tired, but I don't dare go to sleep
How did I get in so deep?
I learned something that I'd rather not know
Maybe I could make it down to mexico
I know way more than I'd like to admit
And they know I know, that's why the hit
It's the not knowing when that I really dread
They'll be after me until I'm dead
When it comes down to the wire
No one will help, every man for himself
When it comes down t the wire
You have to do what you can for yourself
Can't go to work, I can't go home
Gotta face it, I'm alone
Hiding behind every bush and tree
May be someone waiting for me
It could be someone that I know
Can't think of a worse way to go
Could even be a good friend they hire
When it comes down to the wire
When it comes down, down to the wire
When it comes down, down to the wire
[Lyrics: brecht]Broken man in a trance falling sick once again
Warning sings to the mind comas not far behind
Sleep the eternal sleep
Never to awake never to live
All the shock, tension, fear
Sickness, death, always near
Into trance once again
Just one more dying man
Sleeps the eternal sleep
Never to awake never to live
Man on machine, living only death
Man on machine, never to awake again
Never to awake again
Eternal sleep, eternal sleep
Eternal sleep, eternal sleepThe Brutal rape of creation
Spawns blistering radiation
The vermin feed on your
Charred decaying carrionBlinding, choking, our lives constrict, stallow misconceptions can =
be brought.
Corrupted...Suffer!
Lost in ill neglect
In the Shadow of Misconception, misguide opinions, fatal endings
Destroy all happiness from the start, thoughtless in cold visions.
Lies hope/no hope.
The values of humanity cave in.I got this thorn in my side, I try, but I can't get it out
Been killing me for years gone by, a miserable, painful bout
No matter how hard and long I try to rip at it, it stays
Buried deep inside my side enduring, every day
Thorn in my side
I've picked the scab, a trying way, a painful means to amend
Rid myself from the anguish, torment that I must end
I've lived this way for years but now I gotta move on
An oozing sore needs tending to, just like the thorn I adorn
Thorn in my side
Misused, abused, accused, confused
I'm sick and tired of backwards views, my soul's too tired
All black and bruised
Thorn in my sideI am reborn I have seen the light
I was lost but now I'm found
Judgement Day is soon to come
Sinners beware and bow down
I see them in the streets
Speaking to no one
Weak in their mind and weak in their hearts
So convincing to themself
I've seen the truth, Dead is better
Than living in a self-created dream
Let me guide you down
Path #666
Through the portals of damnation
Prepare to taste the virgin's blood
Darkness surrounds you as we part
Your body from your soul
I have seen the truth, Dead is better
Than to live in a state of dreams
Now you're reborn but now by the light
Tormented screams is now your mass
Now admit taht our salvation
Has more to offer that Paradise
Through the portals of damnation
Prepare to taste the virgin's blood
Darkness surrounds you as we part
Your body from your soul
"Hell is only a word...
Reality is much, much worse"A front seat to your own flick, flick
If only you could see how much your emotions waver
Words are flowing from your mouth at lightning speed
They're packing heat and are ready to kill
And are ready to kill, and are ready to kill, and are ready to kill
Cry, frown, hit, yell
Cry, frown, hit, yell
Let's watch where it takes you
You really don't have it that bad, have it that bad
You really don't have it that bad
Try looking through the glass of beauty
It will show you truth
We are all guilty of self-centeredness
We have committed the crime
We have committed the crime
But what we fail to realize is the dent it leaves in our soul
But what we fail to realize is the dent it leaves in our soul
But what we fail to realize is the dent
Everyone is full of it
Everyone is full of it in their own way
Everyone is full of it in their own way
In their own way
A young boy cannot comprehend social status, social status
And this boy is better off than any of us, than any of us
Life will pass by us like, like a summer storm
And if we consume, we consume ourselves with ourselves
We will surely look back with sorrow, sorrow, sorrow, sorrowMy eyes grow weak with sorrow
My soul and body with grief
My life is consumed by anguish
And my years are groaning
My strength fails because
Of my affliction bones grow weak
I have become the epitome of what
I oppose guilt stricken by lies into Your hands
I commit my spirit
I long to walk
In Your shadow conviction
I find relief in You
I find relief in You
I find refuge in You
I find salvation in YouI have everything I need
Innocent victims
They don't exist, who told you this?
Outfit the nation with a blindfold
And a crucifix
Infinite wisdom
A bullet for the pacifist
Improving methods
To cripple the populace
In keeping up with the font stampede
I have a choice, I could keep retreating
Out I let it run me, run me right into the ground
In keeping up with the font stampede
I have a choice I could keep retreating
Out I let it run me, run me right into the ground
I have everything I need
We have no knowledge of
Cause and effect
Our fathers left behind
The ugliest inheritance
Innocent victim
Its every kid who has a wish
Oh, God, you're in for the
Greatest disappointment
In keeping up with the font stampede
I have a choice, I could keep retreating
Let it run me, run me right into the ground
In keeping up with the font stampede
I have a choice, I could keep retreating
Let it run me, run me right into the ground
The ground, the ground, the ground
I let it trample me
I let it trample me
I let it trample me
I have everything I need
Well, I have everything I need
Well, I have everything I need
Well, I have everything I needAnd your spirit shall be alone, deep sleep in dark forests
Let spirit keeps the silence, you're alone but not forgotten
Death was beside you in your life, death is beside you in your death
Do believe in it's power! Bright night shall look frown
And only shining of the stars will not be dull
I will remind you of your destiny, the thoughts you can't get off
The visions you can't scatter away from your spirit, the sighs of Gods.
The distant wind the roar, the mists on the grey swamps
And shadow keeps its gloom, and misery of deathThe plan of invasion an evil deception
Was made in the halls of the dark kingdom
To steal their riches, to slave them all
To make them kneel for a new god
The guard woke up the sleeping men
With the sound of a bronze horn
The enemy is getting closer
So brace yourselves for assault
Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land
Victory Songs are rising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might
Arrows are raining from the sky
As brothers fight side by side
We re outnumbered
But our destiny is to win!
Fight! With the rage of a bear!
Defend! Our homeland!
Crush! Every enemy!
And seal our victory!
Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land
Victory Songs are rising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and mightCome in,sit down,Your knees on the ground
Woman you hate,Woman you hate your inno-
Sense its racing,pulse its pacing,Bite marks tracing
track marks down your bleeding neck
Is it your skin,your hips,your lips,your touch on my prick,
Or the vision of cum on your lips?
Exciting my flesh,Hot lust breath its waiting,
Taste the poison Demoness!
Woman,your sex is like a cult to me,
Ritualistic Ecstasy!
My teeth,I rip,your throat,I lick your pain,I suck
In the heat of the wolflust fuck
Suck me,break you,take you ,make me want you
Woman ,Its what i want from you
Feelin' it,Breathe it,I know you need it
Its electric,Shock you,fuck you
Is it your skin,your taste,your sex
Your blood,your breast?,Fragments of the past flash before my eyes
Never ending streams of images colliding
Silhouettes of memories slowly fading away
Illusionary seductions haunts me in my dreams
Fighting for freedom
But the chains I'm in won't break
It will soon be too late
I am here, I am lost, I am weak, & bothered
Is this it?
Will I grow when my soul falters?
I am here, I am lost, I am weak, & bothered
Is this it?
Will I grow?
I am weak & bothered
Blinded by the fear
Of being left alone
I seek the truth within
As the shadows are closing in
Calling oblivion
'Cause the state I'm in won't change
And I'm fighting for freedom
Cause the chains I'm in won't break
I am here, I am lost
I am weak & bothered
Is this it?
Will I grow when my soul falters?As the sunsets and life reverts to dust
Night falls over my eyes,
A sigh of relief for the end of this day
My hopes and dreams
Is this what has come to be?
Sky is gray washed out world
Deep in this place I won't go
Smell of rotting flesh, a look of disbelief
Wooden cinders scorched the earth
Mother forgive us what have we done?
What does the future hold?Can not a man of modern day
Find truth in what he's learned
Of all the seventh days a waste
A fool for all the lies I've prayed yet I'm strong
I'll place no blame
Although misled I've found the truth
This one belief, strength for this mortal dance
This one truth, I feel I'll be set free
This one faith, I know I'll not falter
This one belief, I know I'll be redeemed
The night once called to me
An eloquent caress she offered
But I'll not make my bed with whores
And in the place she left a harder yet much truer thing
And now by this I gauge the world
Strength for this mortal danceDiagrams, blueprints, sketches are drawn
Infinite calculations so accurate
Lines, circles, angles, images are linked
To perfection be combined
Feverish movements to fulfill the plan
Frantic operation, sweat breaks on your brow
Foundations of a new world are soon to be seen
As soon as the old one has been crushed
Castles built in the air
Powered by merely strength of will
Bulldozers follow pulling down machines
Any remnant of the obsolete
Is soon to be crushed into dust
A new civilization is to be built upon
The steaming tombs of forefathers
Silent, choked, they are meant to be
In their coffins for eternity
Castles built on sand
Ohh, you dream, ohh, your dream
Valid are no scientific rules
The undead will take revenge
Coffins will arise, buildings fall to the ground
The new civilization is now to decay
Blueprints to scorn your defeat will remain
Learn that inside is where to excavate
Or anything you build will be burnt down by hateYour vision of a new life was impure
gave into temptation and threw away what you believed
your immaculate state of mind was only temporary
your faults your flaws got the best of you
your commitment, your pledge to another human being
was destoryed through curiosity
your goal in life is far out of reach
you'll find yourself out of luck
branded into your chest - domestic livestock
society kept track of your defiance
branded into your chest - domestic livestock
terror embedded into your thick mind
bearing your emblem with pride
plagued by its purpose in genesis
subsequently flaunting its meaning
your vision of a new life was impure
gave into temptation and threw away what you believed
infestation
roc-a-way
your immaculate state of mind was only temporary
your faults your flaws got the best of you
your guard was let down
your past turned against youMan came on friday night
He was full of optimism
Its so rare now,
We started full of hope,
We started full of hope.
Time stands for us
And maybe we look good
Please forgive us, baby
You will not understand us.
Hey, don't look into my eyes
I don't sell colored dreams
I'm really sorry, baby
But I'm sure, you wont understand me
[Chorus:]As Sanity Collapses
The Final Frontier Crushed My Nerves
A Hypocrite Piece Of Shit
Bullshit Runs Of Your Tongue Like Spit
Cowardly You Hide
Victim Role Bribed
Lying
Crying
Deriding
Backstabbing Head Of Crud
Manipulative Scum
The Time Has Come To Meet The Saw
Your Misery Is But One Step Away
Swing Of The Hammer
Reap What You Have Raped
Cavity Exposed
I Am Curious To Explore
How Its Psyche Works
Nothing But A Worm
The Human Larvae Drowned
Retribution Justified
Infuriated With Rage
Adrenaline Bursts Through My Veins
Seeing You Bleed
The Only Thing On My Mind
Consequences In Disregard
Cut Out The Tongue
Tear The Sob Apart
With Every Beat Of Your Heart
Every Breath One Too Much
Cut Out The Tongue
The Only Thing On My Mind
Sickened By The Illusive Horror At Hand
Loved Ones Are The Next To Follow In Line
Eradicated For Breeding An Infertile Worm
Larvae Of Man
An Entire Bloodline Faced Its End
Cunts From The Womb Shall Be Torn
Revenge Stained Red
The Hecatomb
Incoming Rage
The Epitome Of Your Fate
Climax Of Unbecoming
A Stained Red
Retributive RapeIt's written in stone... my way... my path... it leads me home...
Storming, the gate, the dragons
Storming, the gate, the dragons, gate
High above the sky, where golden dragons fly
In this mystic land, that lies beyond all time
A holy place so free, for all eternity
But in the distant fields, they see a shadow arise
Woe to the dragons - they're about to die
Storming the dragons' gate, the battle rages hard
Storming the dragons' gate, they're ripped apart
Storming the dragons' gate, the battle rages hard
Storming the dragons' gate, they're ripped apart
One by one they fall, hear the demons' call
He sends his legions of hate, against the dragons' light
In order to erase, eternal enemies
The land is turning red, drinking the blood of the dead
Woe to the dragons - they're about to die
Storming the dragons' gate, the battle rages hard
Storming the dragons' gate, they're ripped apart
Storming the dragons' gate, the battle rages hard
Storming the dragons' gate, they?re ripped apart
After the battle is gone, there is left just one
This one was hiding while he saw the others die
When he swears revenge, hate burns in his heart
He shall never rest, until this fire is gone
Last of the dragons - seeking for revenge
Stormed was the dragons' gate, their destiny is hard
Stormed was the dragons' gate, they were ripped apart
Stormed was the dragons' gate, their destiny is hard
Stormed was the dragons' gate, they were ripped apartNeeds to be a revolution
Maybe theirs to be less tension
They become into the nature
Far frustrating
Need some time for recollection
Maybe I don't need this fixing
Need to be a thing to nature
So proceed with caution
I pull my heart from the end
You always took it and broke it over me
You say that I didn't care
How could my dream turn to despair?
Turn to despair
There is temporary redemption
Your demise is my creation
Let me talk into the next one
Talking symbols
We need some hope and recollection
Maybe then there'll be less tension
Take the one and burn the clothes off
Proceed with caution
I pull my heart from the end
You always took it and broke it over me
You say that I didn't care
How could my dream turn to despair?
Push it, go
Time to release the crease in the beast
The blood shed and killing when will it cease
Clenching our fist at the snap of our wrist
Time to get up and get down with the shh
Too much sorrow, no tomorrow
Too much sorrow, no tomorrow
Too much sorrow, no tomorrow
Too much sorrow, no tomorrow
Turn to despair
Turn to despairHer wraith rides the crystal sky
Of changing colors
The glowing clouds are moving through
The winter night
Snow is falling silver shining
Through the shadows deep blue dreaming
Eyes of diamond shine
Lady of winter, turning to rain
White world of wonder, fading away
Bright beams of violent light
Break the silence
Melting colors crushed beneath the waves
Of rolling flames
Seasons turning, burning burning
Lady of winter, song in the wind
Melody whispers, seasons will changeNow when moon have went beyond the sun
I watch the dancing stars on the sky
Lightnings like fire...
Makes shape of eclipse for my eyes...
Burning the memories to my mind
Lunar space enlightening me
Spectral visions, dreams inside of me
Tranquil shapes of despair
Strenghtening me from inside
I hope that someday, I can feel
The universe like a starstorm through the skyDread the end of summer
On the blackest of all nights,
The feast of samhains waking
In the mist of pagan rites.
The sunlight now is waning
As the undead walk the land.
Tonight's chaos - no mortal understands...
The festival of darkness
Under red october moon:
The powers of black witchcraft
In evil winds of ruin:
Demons ride the autumn sky
In thunder clouds and rain -
The gasps of forlorn souls who live again.
Dare walking this night, ye wanderer,
Ye life and soul you'll loose!
When hunted by his jetblack hound,
You'll surely meet your doom!
His eyes are burning red like fiery coal,
His cape - his leathery wings!
His breath will sear your back like winds from hellAn angel of exile Slave to the betrayed Beware of those who collect feathers Fury of a mob raised by the horns of indecency Crawling as knives are lain on your back In heaven the sounds of freedom are dorwned for choice Hell born, Rising phoenix from this great void greater laws of man The unforeseen trail of the gods in theory of rage Reaching out to these knives Grabbing at all blades I've bitten the hand that feeds me I've embraced the hand that deceives me The Judas Kiss Following of the second fault of man Falling altar of Christ This betrayer in the choices of life Treachery in the fall of supreme These thrones of decay still stand unbroken Relics of the condemned hand Feeding the feeble History of the forgotten stigmas that men fear Transparent soul of the insecure one Just like lying alone as water fills the lungs No hands to reach for when all is deceit Within the soul of burning defeat These souls - Forged in flame These souls - The pathway of untruth These sou ls - Forgotten in shame These souls - Create curse in eternity One among many I am alone Time-decayed words of promise Harsh in beauty Darkness pains me A brotherhood of unbroken loyalty As the sounds of these nails being struck disrupts the winds Passion of enrapture in rage Balance of the grave Starving soul With ashes and dust These dead roses for the nameless Take me Into the mouth of decayNights I spend awake
Waiting for the sign
Days never ended
When will the time arrive?
Far beyond my sight
Hiding in the dark
A semblance of a feeling that was lost
But now is found
As I take a look around me
Never did I feel so lonely
In the dream
The voice had told me
Now it's time
For A Different Story
Ever will I know
What lies inside my mind?
Searching through my pride
I find no place to hide
Blindly still I go
And leave the past behind
Faithfully embrace the light
As I take a look around me
Never did I feel so lonely
In the dream
The voice had told me
Now it's time
For A Different StoryIt all began with the shades of what we never thought existed.
The vision of the distorted views was no longer an illusion.
It was the plain and bitter truth. My divination that I never
Dreamt
Was now to become. Th pseudo silence an all I have unseen.
Life is a darkened silent barricade between all I am and ever
Wanted to be.
We're soon to die
Inherit the wisdom of the earth
Who has struck the bell?
That leads us into hell
I explore myself with my inner eyes, the prodigal son dropped
His disguise
I stalk through the fields of my forsaken memories. Fading
Away like
Withering travesties. My inborn lust for adventures of sharpe
Less nature and
Kind. I lie here clutching at straws, the dream savant chose
Me blind
And then we die
Inherit the sadness of the truth
Erupted are the seas
The epitaphs written in the breeze.
Eradicate our bounds from the earth
Internally, eternally never to emerge
Torment death on holy ground
Carnage in blood we drowned
The world cracks and we fall into decay
The waves of Styx sweeps the dying as I caress their souls.
My knowledge tickles as I cry, the sorrow spectrum grows.
I weigh my anchor and sail through the rainbow There's no
Future to alter
I enter the other side
And now we're dead
Inherit the secrets never known
Explore the universe
Behold the ancients' curse
The dead shall walk the earth.What color are you God?
What side are you on?
Sure you're conceiving love?
We are born to wage wars!
Check it out from your high throne
Rabid dogs sinking teeth into skin
Hear the screams getting closer
Everyone is smelling like xenophobia
[Chorus]
What's the color of the earth tomorrow?
We'll all be acting like avengers
Thank you god for our planet
Tell us why some people are dark and some bright
Sure you meant just one community?
This difference is spinning the world against its own run
[Chorus]
Disagreeing words sound so hollow
(No one wants to take the blame)
What's the color of the race to follow?
By extreme prejudice
What color are you God?
What side are you on?
[Chorus]
Disagreeing words sound so hollow
(no one wants to take the blame)
What's the color of the race to follow?I'm searching for the now
I'm looking for the real thing, yeah
Head through a blue haze
Waiting for the musical craze
We gotta taxi for Mr. Nelson
Taxi for Mr. Nelson
Rebellious Jukebox yeah
Rebellious Jukebox, oh
No sounds at first came out
This machine had dropped out
But it made music to itself
Made music for itself
Rebellious Jukebox yeah
Rebellious Jukebox now
I'm looking for the home of the real
I want a happy time now
Drinkers from the slaughterhouse
Weren't happy and went out
Noise resounds aloud
Noise resounds the lounge
Rebellious Jukebox yeah
Rebellious Jukebox oh
I sidled up to a fruit machine
This I was imagining:
Some drinkers dancing at the bar
Drinkers dancing for the bar
Rebellious Jukebox yeah
Rebellious Jukebox now
I'm searching for the now
I'm looking for the real thing yeahYou brought us up although you were forced to
You had two children and you were just a kid yourself
You cared for us and we relied on you
We used to cry and that was your burden
We had to eat and you had to provide
We we're just ten and we weren't much younger than you
That's what we have
That is why I know you're the reason we all survived
When we were young and you were our mother we grew up fast cause that's how we had to
As I got older I knew I owed it all to you
I owe my youth to you
We both know what we have been through
You gave us your youth just so you could get us through
I owe you my youth
That is what we have
You are why I am
Put on your dancing shoesCathode ray messiah,
window to the soul,
Eradicate all rational thought,
let's kill and hit the road.
Severed head empty heart,
feet swing with the wind.
Torch the church and shoot the priest,
we are walking sin.
Cold Hate...
Murder without reason,
dispense with moral rules.
Break the chain that bind you,
spill the blood of truth.
Rusty scalped amputation,
no anesthetic at hand.
Warped guise of modern culture,
it's all part of the plan,
Cold Hate...
Altered plane of my conception,
one link upon the chain.
Dissent the establishment,
take pride in the absurd.
Cold Hate...
I don't need your pity,
despise your trust.
Head full of anger,
heart full of hate,
twisted sadistic lust.
Lay the blade upon my back,
smother it with lies.
Beat me senseless,
Beat me senseless,
joy to hear my cries.
Cold Heat...Living on your own again
What's gonna keep you clean this time?
Well, how you wear your skin so hard
And breathe that turpentine
You're not her only hurting son
But her favorite one, it seems
You thought you'd die
When you heard goodbye
And sank your dreams
You're just confused like the rest of us
About your next meal
Left mistakes everywhere
For the whole world to feel
It comes around once more
Get drunk again before we go
I wish I'd heard his last dying words
Last dying words
My train of thought gets slow
It's over money I need
Why I'll never even know
You need prayer more than
Anyone I ever knew
But save a prayer for later
To get a drink or two
Remember when we all said
That we could stop any time
Poet's tell how gods fell
Through his last dying words
Last dying words
My train of thought gets slow
Why I'll never even know
You need prayer more than
Anyone I ever knew
But save a prayer for later
To get a drink or two
Remember when we all said
That we could stop any time
Poet's tell how gods fell
Through his last dying words
Last dying words, last dying words
Last dying words, dying wordsSatanized, crucified, feel the wrath of suicide
Incus fear of the sphere, angel darkness disappears
Covenant, blasphemous, open up unhollness (unholyness?)
Father Satan, let me just unholy sins
[Chorus]
Suicide sacrifice
Destruction of holy life
Blood of unholy knife
Satan I sacrifice
Behold the crucifix, symbol of sterility
I am crucifix - Satan
Suicide sacrifice, profeasting evil night
Lust into reality - Satan
Angel of the black abyss, Satan lord I hall (hail?)
Insane blasphemous - Satan
Sacrifical suicide, Ritual to end my life
Benemoth incess my fate - Satan
Dammed to tell, end of my life
Wrath of God - Satan (Warth?)
Sin my soul, blesses with fire
Throne of stone - Satan
I must die, in my wake
Seventh gate - Satan
Suicide, end my life
I must die - Satan
Suicide sacrifice, thrust of evil deep inside
Lucifer never lies, take away thee mortal life
Demigod, Satan son, commend to body to the ground
Father Satan, I'll find peace when I am God
[Chorus]
Take me!In your eyes - I unveil the fate of your life
It's not right? You're never to see the momentum to be
I'm alive - how do you thrive
The curse of the system has to end
Through my eyes
You will come to believe
That somebody is near to release (and to fight)
Suffering of your sins and fear
To save your light to lose your vice
Where is your destination?
Any hesitation?
Soon you'll lose some control
Hatred and pounding craving for nothing
Soon you will damn you mere soul
Made to be broken - you will never foresee
Made to be broken - you're never gonna be
Made to be broken - like he broken glass of your soul
Made to be broken - like your fucked up one man show
The system needs to wipe ou the thinking and loving
For a cruel world
Empty minds have frozen out your soul and free will
Since your birth
So the days went by and you changed
To much for me can't you see
I wonder why, you are rotten to the core
Are you free?They come from the Young Kingdoms
with new hopes and ancient hate
By thousands they ride to the battlefield
I can feel the ground shake
I must rise from my throne
Champion of Destiny and Pride
I must leave these ancient halls
with Stormbringer at my side
[Chorus]
Who will need the illusion
of new love and new found faith
When everything around you
lay destroyed and dead
I am doomed to walk again
on the Path Of Destruction
I'm the last of my Race
and I must fight my final battle
[Chorus]
[Chorus][Spoken intro]
La tierra estÃ¡ destruida - no hay mÃ¡s esperanza.
La tierra estÃ¡ destruida why no hay mÃ¡s esperanza - no hay !
[Spoken male]
Gente escuchad ? - La voz del angel de la muerte anunciando el fin.
[Spoken female]
La tierra ya destruida !
No me interesa, por que para mi no es una sorpesa
No tengo pelo de tonto.
Solo los colores del areo recuerdan a la belleza why hermosura
Hay todavida un futuro ?
.. Gibt es noch eine Hoffnung ?
La tierra estÃ¡ destruida why no hay mÃ¡s esperanza - no hay !Tears of rage
Have fallen of my face
I cannot hide
My dreams keep holding me tight
To be alive
Is the gift and goal of mankind?
Creative minds
So brave but hard to find
Show no fear, (keep) your head up high
Time goes by and arrows fly
Have I lost my mind?
The truth now shows that I was blind
It made me change my mind
It's the circle of life
Tears of a coward, tears of shame
I found my way, to win this game
Do your best, just stay awake
What you got no one can take
Have I lost my mind?
The truth now shows that I was blind
It made me change my mind
It's the circle of lifeI can see you in my dreams
you run away from me
I miss the time we did not have
but the rain keeps washing my sadness away
I know you'll still be in my mind
I know you'll still be in my heart
I close myself in my castle
never to come out
to give vent to my evil thoughts
to remain there in shadows in forgetfullness
I wander looking for the time
I am dreaming of
I make circles around old places
I discover thingsUncontrollable death desire
Rules your darkened world
Ensnared in bitterness
And self inflicted misery
Reality comes crashing in
Through your fragile world
You realize your weakened state
And your soul fills with hate
You made your bed of nails
But there's no one to share it
No matter how you try
You obviously never learn
Strict adherence to formal ritual
Proves that one has nothing better to think about
[Lead: Blomqvist]
While you suffer in the world of pain
Wrestling pointless moral issues
Erratic and eccentric
Still predictable
Your sense of isolation
Cause irrational behaviour
[Lead: Sahlgren]
Strict adherence to formal ritual
Proves that one has nothing better to think about
Know that the nail that sticks out from the rest
Asks to be pounded violentlyCome and take me away Procession waits for ceremony
White hearse among the trees And endless line of black hoods
Nothing will break the solemnity First Gates are closed
Another opens for me to fall into oblivion... ... Mountains of the grief
Guards of my ethereal sleep I never thought how hard this road is
The road that I have been led to nowhere I have left this all to contemplate
the snowfall
To realize myself...Please forgive us children, yes we know exactly what we do.
We've been shitting where we sleep since we were young.
Dear god, it's me, King Blasphemy. I'm quickly nearing death.
Forgive me now, I cannot die a swine.
The whole world is on drugs.
Can't you smell us?
We're the filthiest of pigs.
Can't you see us?
We're the shame of family.
Can't you smell us?
First to show and last to leave.
Won't you end us?
The whole world is on drugs.
Everything will not be made right...I'm trying to think
But I can't catch my thoughts
Confusion is reigning my mind
The void in your word
Should cause me to fear
The coldness is getting near
Clear my eyes
Let me see
I'm going to lose my aim
Show me the sense
The propecies are raining, down from the sky
But answers are not to be found
The longing for something that we cannot find
Uncovers our fatal disguise
Clear my eyes
Let me see
I'm going to lose my aim
Show me the sense
Let me fall
Let me dream - of beauty and truth -
Let me feel
Let me see - the border of reality
Now that we all have percieved our fate
Reality lies and the lie lives in me
Is it all over or will it go on
I'm surewe have nothing to fearUntil my eyes be closed
spectral shadows cover,
my weary soul.
Long time ago,
my destiny was marked for
degeneration,
my weary soul.
autumn
The gelid arms of the infamy
drown me in dark deep waters
my weary soul.
The flesh is colored
with the blood of disgrace.
You won't come back over
groove of my entrails,
my eternal autumn.They look for me
I try not to see them
Pretend to be free
They fail to be saved
The task they're afraid
They cry too much
People stand and stare at them
And you can try, enough!
I came to fall and to remain
Any needle you can use again
They live inside me
I try not to feel them
They're turning my life
Into the flames
Their sun still drains
Wet fingers of my rain
People stand and stare at them
And you can try, enough!
I came to fall and to remain
Any needle you can use againhave you heard of me before?
oh, i know you: my mentor!
death is talking to you!
i realize, what's going on, this
is true!
since the day i was born
i didn't grow up like them all
my life shrinks more and more
to get away from this horror
DEATH WILL SCORE
DEATH WILL...
DEATH WILL SCORE
now you see that i am real
my whole life i could feel
time has come for me to score
my last wish is: to be reborn!
do you know there's no fear
to die with pride, no more tears
i'll be born again free
as an angel, not yours, it's me...
DEATH WILL SCORE
DEATH WILL...
DEATH WILL SCORE
DEATH WILL SCORE
DEATH WILL SCORE
DEATH WILL SCORE
DEATH WILL SCORE
since the day i was born
i didn't grow up like them all
my life shrinks more and more
to get away from this horror
DEATH WILL SCORE[Instrumental]I don't know
What I don't know
I don't know
What I don't know
I don't know
What I don't know
There's hellfire in the chalice
Let your lips touch ground and drink
Sister dearest
Sick of love
Don't you know?
I've been promised no salvation
Just a lonely bitter end
For the while I'll spare our lives
Promise me
I don't know
What I don't know
I don't know
What I don't know
I don't know
What I don't know

And the fairy's gone astray
In this forest creatures dwell

Poems by Bartsch - November 1996)
Ich bin nicht nur eine Farbe
Sondern letztlich Siebzehn und Drei
als elfte Mglichkeit zu sterben
Eine Zeit ist zu kurz aber niemals lnger
darum lat mich meine Schulter begraben
und alle Finger einzeln auskleiden
Dann kann ich das schwarze Loch leugnen
und tief in gefaltete Keuschheit einblicken
Beim nchsten Mal lauschen wir deinem Blut
und ergeben uns in die Snde meiner strangulierten Sprotte
Halbierte Uhren lachen lautlos in deiner Nhe
und belgelaute Versuchung trbt frucht'gen Suizid
Mein Sattel rutscht morgen nicht mehr weiter
und 1955 sterben die Toten in infernalischem Vergessen
Meiner letzten Domne
Dennoch erobern wir nicht, wie Erinnyen auf Seite Zwei
sondern erschleichen unsere unbeseelte Natur
In dreifaltigem Clairobscur
Liebkosener Wahn Bewirkt zuweilen eine besondere Gegenwart
welche sich wie zu tief gesunkenes Blut in Rasierklingen verhlt
und somit unser Brustloses Glhen im Bestiarium widerhallen lt
Als meine vergifteten Schatten im Zodiakallicht entzweibrachen
und nur ein weiterer Tod den verkmpften Gerchen mifiel
Erschrak eine gehrnte Klinge in der Vollendung animalischer Lust
und der Verksung neue Glieder
Schmckten sich grobem Gewande
Bacchanten erklommen eisige Schlnde
doch gebaren die zarte Verdmmnis nicht
Notzucht erblindet in oviparer Todessehnsucht
und das Nein gegen Gott & Luzifer is erdacht
Ein ruchloser Zwang erfordet willkrliche Gefahr,
wenn die Totenklage einer glcklos verschiedenen Maid
blulich Anarchie ber die Pforten der nackten Begierde trufelt
Um in uralten Anreicherung des Siedepunktes mein Leben zu vergeben,
wird der blasphemische Ursprung aller Grabfsser zum Untergang gereichenMy skin still burns
All the places you've touched
So aware
Leave no place for hiding
Not last night, not this time
I close my eyes so the world can't see me
And draw the silhouette of a dancer in my head
I can't look through your eyes, but my mind betrays mine
Should I starve unmarked or confess to my blindness
My eyes still hurt
Fighting, chasing, chasing lights
As they form
Silhouettes behind me
Let them go, this time
Waiting for a change
I can't fight these chains everyday
I bleed to avoid the pain
Everyday I fade a little moreWho the fuck are you?
Who the fuck do you think you are?!
You betrayed me this whole fucking time
I'm the baddest motherfucker in the building
So remember when it's time for me to get my revenge
I will find your fucking bitch
And fuck her, right in front of you
Some people think that they can get away with murder
But everybody here can see the blood right on their hands
It's a crazy fucking world and there's no one left to trust
As people we have voices, leave the traitors in the dust
Revenge is something lethal and the taste is bittersweet
Their punishment awaits, we'll sweep their bitches off their feet!
Its ironic when she screams my name and begs for more
It's really sick, I'll hand it to you shes a
Crazy bitch
I like the way she rides this dick
I didn't think I'd have to warn you
You let it go too far again
I thought you knew that I was crazy!
I let my actions speak loud
Tie her to the bed and let a minute get ahead
So I can get a better look and let her settle in the thought of it-
And of course she really wants it I can see her dripping wet and
Salivating at the though of it
Tie her to the bed and let a minute get ahead
So I can get a better look and let her settle in the thought of it-
And of course she really wants it I can see her dripping wet and
Salivating at the thought of it
So let me speak, answer me-
Who the fuck are you
You walk around with your nose up in the air
But you can't smell the shit that comes out of your mouth
You're a liar, you're a bitch, and you're a fake
Who the fuck do you think you are
I've spent my precious time dealing with your problems
And payback is a bitch
What goes around comes around my friend
And you will soon realize it!Awake from tears of your silent eyes
Awake from sins and burn down my life
Awake as a lover from ashes and dust
Awake and taste the night and my sighs
You are the fairy of woods and forlorn souls
I want to satisfy my lips by your blood
Like thousand arctic crystals I see your pale face
Resign your body into my bloody arms... tonight...
I wake from nowhere, from the ashes and the dust
I wake from spaces, from nascent screaming night
Like a freezing passion burns your look in silence
Your real body is just land of darkness
Awake from dark naked in the night
Awake as phoenix with blood deep insideThe day the dream went right back to base
There was blood on the ground
Blood on the sand
Blood all around
Tracks of the ride of the bright murder hawk
The day the dream debased and went home
And the people did mill to those adrenaline rails
And everything stopped
The nurses climbed up
Our face paled
And there was no doubt at all
No two ways about it
Was the day Disney's dream debased
Saw a mouse, who flapped at my wife
And she told him what
And she told him what had gone down
Who then did not know the extent of the show
The people had [died/gave?] in the mouth of their ride
Disney
And Dopey and Mickey, Brer and Pluto
Secretly prayed
And there was no doubt at all
No two ways about it
Was the day Disney's dream debased
Disney
Dark glasses on Western Union
Man the gates
The dream, an innocent meets her fate
Far away from Appalachia and the city hate
The day X3
When there was no doubt at all
No maybe about it
It was the day the dream debased
Disney
I remembered it from
The back of my mind
The tune that I wrote
In fallen dreams
Anthem to
Creator of all that had stopped
So there was no doubt at all
No two ways about it
It was the day the dream debased"In most of processes
In the grimoires
Demons are subordinate
To the magician
Or can be
Subordinated
But there is another
Group of rituals
In which the force of evil
Is master and worshipped
Those connected
With the pact
With the devil
The witches' sabbat
And black mass."

Stubborn & Cynic - An Instant Form

Still Tryin' To Tell Me Who I Want To Be

How Far Could This Go?
Would You Tell Me So
Completely Out Of Hand
I'm Forced To Be Someone ElseFroten and still I stand
Through these rooms of emptiness
The void in my hands once more
Awaken to see another day of greyness
Armless and numb
All emotions now are gone
I burn another page
From the book of my memories
The way I follow has no return
I'll face this journey alone
In every night and in every breath
You'll drown in the wastelands of my soul
No other words are left
No reasons to explain
My scorn as a farewell message
Only silence now remains
Negativity
Surround me in Your cold dead embrace
Rape my spirit with Your divine sickness
Blind is my soul, I sold You my life
My faith shines in every wound
Fanatical cynicism leads my way now
We're nothing but tools under Your eternal spell
My true belief -
Slave to Negativity[musick & lyrixxx - Ross Sewage, 1997]
Malignant sores seep, Pustules erupt with cheese, Degeneration of
epithelium, Phagocytic cells increase... The carcinoma disseminates through
lymphatic fluid, Giving rise to a myriad of metastic moppets, Lambasted by
lesions and suffering tissue rejection, As your countenance glides off in
deliquesced droplets... Infected layers of skin disembogue in sullied
chunks, Cleaved from connective tissue by fitful hands, Your long face
accentuated by pendulant flesh, Debilitated by an aberration in the DNA
strand... Corpulent moles and warts, Symptoms of the sarcoma, Abrading the
neoplasm, You avulse the keratoma... A tumorous husk is amassed and left to
decay, Emitting a foul septic aroma, Ameliorate the disease through total
dermal regeneration, You slough the gory melanoma... Irradiated and
mutated, Cancerous cells deviate, Carcinogens and pathogens, The integument
you exuviate...Everyone loves a drama
everyone loves the drama
lets set the stage on fire and hollywood will be jealous
when the lights go out
everyone loves a drama
everyone loves the drama
as she stared into the night was the caste dressed in white
behind her virgin eyes the mirror image of her plague
and darkness overcame until she screamed alone in vain
oh how lovely as she gasps, yet so innocently sleeping
and forever she will hunt, now manifest this disease
the misfortune of the weak, i'll tell you what it is
walk down these tragic steps
Disappearing with no trace, nothing left
this was the perfect murder
the perfect murder
in the ballroom with a glass, remembering it all at last
the memory of her fist kiss led to a series of unfortunate events
she'll dance to the sound of the clock striking twelve
your name in diamonds
your name in diamonds
why won't you fish the jobThis life is not worth living, I can't keep fighting these thoughts, they consume every piece of my mind. My choice is made now it's time to die. My choice has been made, only I can control my own fate. Disregard every word that you plea, sit back and watch me bleed. This life is not worth living I can't keep fighting these thoughts, they consume every piece of my mind, my choice is made now it's time to die. To this world I'm done. No room for thoughts, no need for prayers. This blood will flow. If I was gone tomorrow, would anyone shed a tear?... Did I make a difference in any person's life?...Would I be missed?...Would anyone wonder why?...I've lived for far too long am I right or am I wrong? My sanity is put to the test, as my body lays to rest. Laid...down...to...rest laid down to rest. Wishing for a noose around my neck, razorblade in the palm of my hand. Staring down the drain of the sink. This blood will flow...flow...flow...this blood will flow.YOU'RE IN TRAP A VILLAIN NEEDS YOUR BLOOD

PEOPLE WILL NEVER GRASP HOW MUCH YOU SUFFEREmbers burn and light the way to take the steps of those before you
Fearing life and taking what was never yours is far from graceful
Now you'll suffer, I'll burn all the memories that you've held on to
Wanting, waiting, wasting all your life with such anticipation
Blowing out the flames of life it's time
Burning all your flesh I watch the flames turn white
Didn't even ever think to ask you why
Will this stop the lies?
Thinking that your life had meaning
That it was someting great
Why don't I choose to believe
You will never convince me
Burn the hatred
Burn the evil
Burn the bitch
It's almost done
Burn the lies
Burn the deception
Burn it all
I'm far from done
Always wanting never learning and you never made the time
Till your life's sudden ending came and now you live to die
Trapped in what you thought "it could never ever be worse"
Than the life full of misery that you had upon this earth
Searching for the ultimate escape you think you've found
Now you're just a rotting corpse as you lie there in the ground
This is all is and now you've only had to die
This all there is and now there's nothing
You're... The only one
You... The only one
When you're safe we'll hunt you down, Ruin you
All the things that I've never wanted or had to
Burn the hatred
Burn the evil
Burn the bitch
It's almost done
Burn the lies
Burn the deception
Burn it all
I'm far from done
Learning nothing, doing nothing
Feeling nothing, what's the point?
All this time that I've stood by you
You're a shell all dead inside
This is all you'll get from me
This is all I have for you
Why must I continue to...
You are now NOTHING
Burn the hatred
Burn the evil
Burn the bitch
It's almost done
Burn the lies
Burn the deception
Burn it all
I'm far from done
Always wanting never learning you never made the time
Till your life's sudden ending came and now you live to die
Trapped in what you thought "it could never ever be worse"
Than the life full of misery that you had upon this earth
Searcing for the ultimate escape you think you've found
Now you're just a rotting corpse as you lie there in the ground
This is all is and now you've only had die
This is all there is and now there's nothing
Burn the hatred
Burn the evil
Burn the bitch
It's almost done
Burn the lies
Burn the deception
Burn it all
I'm far from done
Burn the hatred
Burn the evil
Burn the bitch
It's almost done
Burn the lies
Burn the deception
Burn it all
I'm far from done
Will this stop the lies?[music: Dennis lyrics: Jake]
Everything around me seems so empty
I think I can still hear other people`s voices in there
Shouting at me in madness "It`s Time For You To Leave:"
Denying to accept the beliefs of another age
I lost my mentality and I ended up in there
Being aware of the spirit`s second dimension
Where sense, insanity and justice is invisible
The gun you hold may give me the creeps
Perhaps I`ll be happy if you use it
So as to prove once again that I`m still sick
[chorus]
Eventually I know
Wrong exists And covers what is Right
But I can`t judge them with daring
Don`t hesitate to point the gun at me, I`m not afraid of the truth
But at least you must hold it tight if you feel strong enough to use it
My ever loneliness might be the reason of loosing the sensible way
But I was never in a real need of communication
In a world where Wrong And Right makes no sense at all:
Are you upset of looking me?
Are you afraid as I come near you?
What are you waiting for? Shoot me!
Be careful cause I`m loosing patience
Don`t let me come closer cause
This will mark the beginning of my WAR:[Kein Hirtenfeuer glimmt mehr]
Kein Hirtenfeuer glimmt mehrbringt Licht ins Heidemoor.Ganz oben,
einsam singt er - des Winters Totenchor.
[Heimwrts]
Karges, dunkles Land...Gnzlich still, weit, unbekannt.Sollst so manch
Legende schrzen,doch heut mir nur die Kutsche fhren.
Durch wilde, kahlte Klfte - hinein ins deland. (still, wiet,
unbekannt)Dort herrschen eisge Lfte,wie nie zuvor gekannt. (tief drinn
im deland)
Wohin ich blick - nur Eis und Schnee...gespenstge Kiefer, dunkler
See...Schauderhaftes schlit mich ein - kein Weg, kein Steg, kein
Lampenschein!
Der Pferde Krfte schwindenin einer Nebelwand,gepeitscht von
Geisterwinden,der Schlaf mich bermannt - tief drin im
deland.
[Nebel]
[Instrumental]
[Fortgang]
Welch gramvoll Peinverwies mich meinen Pfaden,als morgendunstge
Schwaden,noch ruhten im verschneiten Hain.
In weit erstartter Heide,lang schwand die alte Leite,wohin noch
schweifet der Blick,fhrt kein Umkehr zurck.
berwunden ist nun Dunkelheit,nach langem Weg in Einsamkeit.Von
unberhrtem Stegefolget leis und dicht - des Mondes fahles Licht,zum
Ende alter Wege.
[A cappella]
[Nachhall]
[Instrumental]Reality no longer battles perception
This letter's written to no one
Sincere,
I sought your truth and divine purpose through myths of revelation
Guidance all wrapped up in a paper box,
Supported only so long as my mind was the enemy
I could not in conscience hold on
As we face distress we must not lose heart
Stand fast and press on,
Triumph awaits
As we face distress we must not lose heart
Stand fast and press on,
Triumph awaits us
The powerful constant that I had once leaned on is no longer there
(No longer)
You call this shameful disbelief,
A process like losing my closest friend
As we face distress we must not lose heart
Stand fast and press on,
Triumph awaits
As we face distress we must not lose heart
Stand fast and press on,
Triumph awaits us
Sometimes we have to watch our whole lives fall apart,
Before we can rebuild them again,
A greater foundation
We watch our whole lives
(Sometimes we have to watch our whole lives)
Fall apart
(Before we can rebuild them again) rebuild them again (a greater foundation)
I wish there was another way,
But no amount of devotion can fix this
Triumph awaits
Triumph awaits
Triumph awaits
Triumph awaits
Triumph awaits
Sometimes we have to watch our whole lives fall apart,
Before we can rebuild them again,
A greater foundation
We watch our whole lives
Fall apart (Sometimes we have to watch our whole lives)
Rebuild them again
(Before we can rebuild them again,
A greater foundation)aYou can get quids in quick

Nectarine Number 9, Pavement, Richard Swallow - TV presenter
(Rad Coke) - fireman
I Welsh his school life in Edinburgh must have been terribleThe end is near, panic is closing in
Sick with fear, they run
Watch freedom's fall
What have we become? Cannon fodder
Reign of terror, enslave the nations, devastation
This is war, pull the trigger
One nation under their control
Rise, the tyrants rise
The enemy inside, the tyrants rise
The end is here, feel it closing in
Blood runs red
Watch in horror, our lives destroyed
We failed
The final holocaust
Enslave the nations, annihilation
This is war, pull the trigger
One nation out of control
Rise, the tyrants rise
The enemy inside, the tyrants rise
War, pain, suffering
The price we pay to stay alive
Blood, fire, death
His glory come, his kingdom rise
This world will burn, burn, burn, burn
Rise, the tyrants rise
The enemy inside, the tyrants rise[Lyrics by Graav]
In this cold night
I feel my soul life again
when i think of the world
that i left beyond this dark side
The true evil against humans
Is still alive inside me
All i can feel is emptiness
From the dark angel's power
When the time has come
i will return with death on my mind
And with my immortality
You will be prepared to die
I can hear voices
voices from the dark past
My fantasies turn real
then the dead lives again
I saw the truth
when i walked the eternal journey
the future of the world
will burn in my flamesThe way I see it
Just ain't your way
You won't listen
To what I have to say
I won't tolerate
The things you want me to see
Say you're here to help
But you just fuck me.
No more lies and deceit
Its not our fault
We are this way
We all have our views
And different things to say
You judge me, I judge you
Nothing will change
What are we to do?[I - The forbidden words]

Let no man breach the gate to this most blasphemous of halls
Lest bitterness and chaos be the harvest they wouldst reap
He must n'er become a slave to this Child's beck and call
For she must never waken from her Crimson Sleep..
The monastery stood towering above the ruined city
It shadowed all the new emerging settlements and homes
To look down on the ruins was to sympathize and pity
All the suffering and heartache, all the graves and broken bones
For buried there a testament to the evil of a queen
A misery that spread across a weak and stricken land
The crimson birth that swamped the earth in dark and deadly dreams
And all mankind did bow beneath the power of her hand
And in the monastery garden sat a woman with a book
A manuscript that lay within her frail and trembling arms
She looked around her nervously as guilt rose in her heart
But the sway of curiosity had drawn her out too far
She wavered on the threshold of a dangerous decision
For this dark tome was no for human eyes to ever read
The pages dripped with legions of persuasive words and visions
So the volume had been hidden well, but now it had been freed
For no apparent reason had the woman been drawn in
Perhaps it was a twist of fate, an absence of real thought
She wandered to a room that before she'd never been
And all at once the interest of her senses had been caught
For no apparent reason had the women been drawn in
Where rows of dusty books lay in an ominous display
But one ancient leather binding had the grain of human skin
And seized with curiosity she stole this book away
And now she sat alone in the concealment of the night
She was hungry now to liberate the writings from their cage
The glimmer of a feeble moon provided her with light
As she opened up the cover and began to read the page
Fly, soul, the body's guest,
Upon your impish arrant
Let none be guiled by false confession
Truth shall be your warrant
Fly soul for your body must die
But for those who seek eternity
For those who yearn prosperity
From this single act of sanity
Will raise you far above humanity
Oh willing host who doth not know
The full desire of this prisoner
You walk where angels fear to go
Thou shalt soon embrace the reckoner
Thy halo of glory, hope's true gage
May prove to be an evil pilgrimage
Something had happened beyond her control
A moment of madness unfettered a soul
That would relish a freedom denied once before
By a desperate nation with it's back to the wall
Within a split second of reading this text
The spirit was free and had fled from its nest
It was eager to grow from this sudden reprieve
And thus in the woman a life was conceived
From the beginning the world was misled
As a baby was born in a monastery bed
The miracle happening here on this Earth
Was perceived as a glorious new Virgin Birth
From the moment in time that baby was born
The sun did now rise on a new Crimson dawn
And the creature just bided its time undiscovered
So safe in the cradling arms of the mother
[Lead: Dan]
But for those who seek eternity
For those who yearn prosperity
From this single act of sanity
Will raise you far above humanity
Secure from the world, the child remained hidden
A serpent disguised in the Garden of Eden
And all who looked down on this newly born babe
Were ignorant now of the path this would take
The people were blind to the subtle control
That was exercised daily upon every soul
With no room to question this delicate life
All fears would be drowned and all doubts would be stifled
But one single mind did stand out from the crowd
Though quiet at first - with hardly a sound
The Mother Superior harbored suspicion
Brought to her heart by three simple vision
[The Visions:]
The first was a planet engulfed by the sea
No dry land in sight, not a mountain or tree
No rock jutted out from the endless horizon
Or flowers to mark out the changing of seasons
No animals dwelt in the forests or fields
All life was extinct; its fate had been sealed
By the curse of a violent unstoppable flood
Mankind had been drowned in an ocean of blood
The next revelation was vivid and cruel
It depicted two swordsmen engrossed in a duel
The one held a sword that was silver and pure
The other a sword that was red to the core
They fought as the sun rose high in the sky
Their fight would not end until one of them died
No room did they have for an error to make
For the future of life was the trophy at stake
But one of the warriors flouted the rules
And with cunning and guile had the other one fooled
As he held up his hands in a gesture of peace
The silver opponent allowed this retreat
Then the man with the red sword attacked from behind
Left the silver sword fighter defeated and blind
Then carnage ensued that no man could condone
As the bloody red blade sliced through sinew and bone
All day did the swordsman attack without halt
Though the other lay dead from the frenzied assault
Until by the twilight and all that remained
Were the echoes of death and a fresh crimson stain
And so came the third of these unyielding visions
A picture of war and ferocious divisions
An army of saviors marching as one
Aware that the end had already begun
They arrived in a field, which was wide and expansive
They waited in silence both ready and pensive
The grassland was strewn with small crimson petals
Their fragrance was sweet with the stench of the devil
And slowly but surely they fell into sleep
Their consciousness gone as they slumped in defeat
And there they still lie bereft of their willpower
Brought to their knees by the strength of a flower
The three visions, the Mother Superior bore
A bitter forewarning of what was in store
This infant so frail must not grow to be strong
The world was at risk if she waited too long
So veiled by the blackness of night she did creep
And enter where mother and child were both asleep
And onwards she moved to where the crib lay
She leant over the baby and started to pray
She prayed for forgiveness for what she would do
She prayed that the knife in her hand would aim true
But all of a sudden she was now paralyzed
The baby daughter had opened her eyes
[Lead: Mike]
And into those eyes, the woman gazed
The look in her face was both haunted and crazed
She was smothered and swamped in confusion and sadness
The first to be gripped by this foul crimson madness
This brutal psychosis could not be explained
No one single cause was suggested or blamed
But no one could think that a child was involved
And the mystery illness remained unresolved
So all seemed as normal for seven short years
A veil of deception dissolved any fears
But there was one lapse in the child's disguise
And that could be seen in the depths of her eyes
The message could clearly be discovered there
In the glimpse of the universe found in her stare
Her gaze hypnotic, unbearably strong
Suspicions were growing, it wouldn't be long
Oh willing host who doth not know
The full desire of this prisoner
You walk where angels fear to go
Thou shalt soon embrace the reckoner
Now and then a question would be raised
Strong misgivings threatened to be voiced
But these were judgments wiser not to say
To doubt the child could prove to be a rash and deadly choice
By now the Crimson reign had proved too much
The monastery was shadowed under dread
But fear decreed that hostile thoughts be crushed
For the creature had the power to crawl inside your head
The mother in her darkest moment knew
The time had come for action to be taken
A journey must be made to hidden truths
She must return and read again the book she had forsaken
This tome presented many further views
Essential rules of power were revealed
And thus the pages offered up one clue
The child bore one significant Archilles Heel
Should the Crimson Queen be blinded, then powerless she'll be
Bereft of piercing vision, her victims will be free
Salvation lies in banishing this creature to the dark
Let not your hand be hesitant or death will be your mark
Lest regained sight should speed her flight away from burning hell
A steady heart must seal her back within her crimson cell
And thou who didst release this most vindictive enemy
Must serve to be her warder there for all eternity
One quiet night the lady traveled out beyond the monastery
Her quest was one of urgency and human preservation
She traveled with companions to reach the ruined city
Where lay the means to save her kind, a path to their salvation
When there they searched for evidence of where the Queen once slept
And came upon a gateway, which was tightly closed and barred
A stark inscription warned them of the risk of their next step
But choices were no more; they had already come too far
Let no man breach the gate to this most blasphemous of halls
Lest bitterness and chaos be the harvest they wouldst reap
He must n'er become a slave to this Child's beck and call
For she must never waken from her Crimson Sleep:
[Lead: Mike]
With fresh resolve the women carried on towards their goal
And found themselves a cell where crimson shade were scattered
A sight so dreadful it chilled their very souls
The cell had long been drained and all around the glass lay shattered
A movement in the shadows
A flash of blazing light
The child stood before them
With murder in her eyes
The women ran towards her
To try to stem the tide
Of purse and crimson anger
There was nowhere left to hide
Too slow was their reaction
They were thrown back off their feet
Their throats were filled with panic
As they stared as harsh defeat
Too weak was their protection
They couldn't staunch the trail
Of vitriol and vengeance
Meted out for this betrayal
So the mother's brave compatriots
Consumed with damning pain
Died writhing in the dirt
They were bleeding and insane
They'd looked into the child's eyes
And crumbled in despair
From images too hideous
For human minds to bear
Salvation lies in banishing
This creature to the dark
Let not your hand be hesitant
Or death will be your mark"
But there was still one single hope
No room for fear or doubt
The mother knew there was no choice
She had to end this now
She crawled across the bloodstained ground
Her eyes averted from the steely glare
But secretly she knew she'd found
A way beyond this nightmare
[Lead: Simon/Mike]
A few more seconds spanned the path
Between success or damnation
Mankind would face the aftermath speed
Of this deadly confrontation
Got to strike for the eyes
Leave the monster running blind
Go to cross the line
Got to strike for those unforgiving eyes
She veiled herself with trivial thought
A mask of insignificance
Her daughter failed to see beyond
The fabric of irrelevance
For a moment they were face to face
No sign of what was soon to be
But still her mind refused to break
Those thoughts must not be seen
Got to strike for the eyes
Leave the monster running blind
Go to cross the line
Got to strike for those unforgiving eyes
[Lead: Simon]
Striking hard, striking fast in desperation
The world around is filled with shades of red
Forced to stand in weak anticipation
As rivulets of blood run down the Child's head
The chamber fills with screams of violent rage
Of petulance and impotent frustration
Consumed with frenzied tidal waves of hate
The princess falls to earth in dark sedation
Her blindness stunts the growth of nascent power
That grows within her like some poisonous flower
The blade of darkness strikes her to the hilt
And so the flower inside begins to wilt
But time is short for action to be taken
No chance to dwell on pity or mistakes
No chance for dark excuses to be found
The moment of Salvation must be now!
Cast me to the crimson flames
Thou hast the power should I be blind
To overthrow my wicked reign
And throw me to the pit of time
Cast me to the crimson flames
Thou shalt bar the doors of hell
Incant these words of sacred rule
Seal me in my crimson cell
[Lead: Dan]
And thus was read the incantation
Voices echoed round and round
The woman smiled in weak elation
Mesmerized inside the sounds
[Lead: Dan]
And with these chants of higher lore
So mortal flesh began to fade
Soon child and mother were no more
Their earthly bodies now decayed
Cast me to the crimson flames
Thou shalt bar the doors of hell
Incant these words of sacred rule
Seal me in my crimson cell
[Lead: Mike]
And still inside the chamber stands
A single cell with crimson hue
Resealed by spoken word of Man
Imbued with power from spiritual Truth
Two souls imprisoned for eternity
Light and dark forever bound
Two souls that never can be freed
A pathway back will not be found
For trapped beyond some foolish reach
And far away from prying eyes
No channel now to lead or preach
No chance to influence or guide
The final sacrifice she took
Ensured the hope of the human race
And thus she holds the sacred book
A captive in her crimson space
Lest bitterness and chaos be the harvest they wouldst reap
For she must never waken from this Crimson Sleep
[Lead: Dan]Caught in lifeless flesh
Screams of my fear that no one hear
Pain of my thought that no one knows
The yearning to death that I feel
Alone with myself
Despase and reject
Retired from normal life
Hear my cry
Hear my agony
See my blood
See my dreams
Feel my hate
Feel my vomit in your face
Look that makes me kill
Voices that laughs about me
Conceptions that ignores me
And feets that kicks me away
Caught in a body
A body of punishment
The angel of incorporeal souls have punished me
But the end of this torture are so far
Hear my cry
Hear my agony
See my blood
See my dreams
Feel my hate
Feel my vomit in your face
Caught in lifeless flesh
Screams of my fear that no one hear
Pain of my thought that no one knows
The yearning to death that I feelMy scabs are almost picked
Slowly growing into this
Feelings I just can't let go
I am such a bore that you need that much more
Go back that way and see what you get from me then
Nothing at all
My dead hands rise
Why am I this way?
Face my past I can't let go
I see them in the jel
Laughing at me it is hell
Nothing can stop this torture
Fake my way through life
Call on me my wife
Went back that way and I saw just what I was worth
Nothing at all
My dead hands rise
Why am I this way?
Face my past I can't let go
I won't take no for an answer[March '91]Reduced to this, Vulnerable and cold

Unstable explosives lodged between your teeth

Across many miles to German's land, frison's born and
Belgian frontiers, snow storms are raging...
Tryggvasons battles are near, the white fields separate us.
Christian! You're gonna die by our frost!
At middle age time, Limburg create lots of myths,
ancient pagan cult, wrap of mysteries.
invaded by the filthy Christian tribe.
we drive them back to the fields of impurity.
let them die in their rotteness!
(narration CRONOS):
"Midnight paths are now engaged to our lust.
Sons of SATHANAS, we are gathered for the one.
Frosted snow falls on cadaveric faces,
colder than the cross of ice.
The unholy benediction of the silver moon.
spiked crown shinning on these marble steps!"
Limburg, across the Vesder to the black forest,
there stand the crypt where were invoked demonic souls
they came from the Gehenna to us.
to bless their legions in which they trust, praying for us
warriors of the dark Pentagram.
Christianity is just a matter of time.
We'll drive them back to their Nazareth hills,
with the solicitude of SATAN!
Burning their churches, jagged their whores.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust...
As they please us to rip them off like porks!
Tryggvasons battles, the ancient Belgian war.
The war without sanity... Without mercy...
A war for an era without Christian lies...
Oooohh! Lord of lust and fear of impiety...
It's time for us to drift in the dark tranquility.
Limburg, town of my ancestors!!!
In the eternity of times I'll worship you forever...no time for love you don't ask why.
your pillow's warm.
slip on your sandals imagine you are off to the ball.
they weren't awake you close the door
it's so unusual to sleep alone.
your hair in knots, your dreams beyond their control.
no time for love - i can't explain. . .
no time for love. . . within these walls.
no time allowed to be a child.
no time for love, no time, no time for love, no time,
no chance for romancing,
no time to be a child- no time.
no time to talk -so much to say.
go to the town in your cotton dress.
try all the clothes you know
you'll never afford to buy.
so you gaze at the stars of matinees.
piazza for the rich and the poor
then come home tired with a smile all over your face.Frozen minded out of the ashes
See my face in the dust
Manic structures, human madness
Apocalyptic trance
The battle rages from day to day
Endless night begins
Darkened landscape, left behind
Saturated with blood
All life is lost in misery
Upon the earth storm rages on
Into nothingness crimson rain covers the earth
Impure mankind perished in pain but still raising the dead
Wasted genius and wasted land
How great was your gain?
The answer is self-importance
Never ask for forgiveness
All life is lost in misery
No one cares when the reaper laughs
Into my world I guide your life to eternity
Sorrow and sadness, pain is the law, love is the crime
Deliverance, deliverance
Deliverance, deliverance
Depth of terror, depth of horror
Lost Eden pays its price
Purveyor of distress, from the abyss
Thy will be done
Impure mankind, the lost chapter is over now
Into nothingness, nothing is gained, nothing is earned
Deliverance, deliverance
Deliverance, deliverance
Come to my world, deliverance
Come to my world, deliverance from mankind, alright
The battle of the masses
Rages day and night
Earth reduced to ashes
The fire that burned the eyes
And I saw a new heaven
I saw a new earth
This place won't be given
For a second impure birth
Deliverance, deliverance
Come to my world, deliverance
Come to my world, deliverance
Deliverance, deliverance
Deliverance from mankindThe very maxim of the universe
Portrayed by the greatness the stars rehearse
Premeditated by nature's sense
A modest exuberance so intense
That every mind has failed to grase it
Forged by time on the last of eternity
Complex constructions - a stellar fraternity
Spread out on a canvas of deepest black
The white glowing softness a fierce attack
On every space still to be filled by matter
A pursuance of that very first creation
Expansion and a constant alteration
The fringes of the canvas always stir
The boundary is bathing in a blurI am the igniter destroying all your dreams
I am the deceiver I'll take away everything
The reason why these clouds will burn bright
And the stars will cry out when block the light
Even the sun will weep
When it wakes to find that it's no longer
The bearer of such luminous light
Now sit back and watch, your walls collapse in flames
And this i swear
This was all to see her eyes shine bright
And this I swear
This was to save my pitiful life
I won't try to escape the disaster
That slowly takes over the walls
And our senses engulfed in the flames
I create to try and match
The color of her face
And this i swear
This was all to see her eyes shine bright
And this I swear
This was to save my pitiful life
It was far too much for me so I set this place ablaze
My mind set on the thought of hope and the seduction of change
Now sit back and watch, your walls collapse in flames
And this i swear
This was all to see her eyes shine bright
And this I swear
This was to save my pitiful lifeWell if you livin in the world today
You be hearing the slang that the Wu-Tang say
Niggas that front we don't have em
So we blast em, alright, well OK
Well if you like the way it sound then clap man
And if the women love it too well then raise your hands
But only raise your hands if you're sure
Punk niggas shatter like a glass jaw, break it
My rhyme gross weight vehicle combination
Was too heavy for the Chevy's is chased out the station
Double-edged was the guillotine that beheaded it
Gassed up, fuckin with some regular unleaded shit
Heads roll on hillsides behind ropes that
Bind-in, X marks the spot on the scope
Heavily armed military is necessary, it's a gamble
MC's bet they best at every
Powerful parable ditties might harm
If tampered with, set off and strike like pipe bombs
Flashbacks to the Duel of the Iron Mic
Look out for these fatal flying spikes, of massive
Sleep-holds, put strangle on commercial angle
Microphone cords tangled from being Star Spangled
Now who could ever say they heard of this?
My motherfuckin style is mad murderous
Well if you like the way it sound then clap man
And if the women love it too well then raise your hands
But only raise your hands if you're sure
Punk niggas shatter like a glass jaw, break it
Well if you livin in the world today
You be hearing the slang that the Wu-Tang say
Niggas that front we don't have em
So we blast em, alright, well OK
Well what you know about MCin?
Yo, I know a lot
Well can you demonstrate somethin nigga?
Huh, I'd rather not
I'm talkin bout stacks cousin
Nigga that's what I got
Cash Rules the world
Well Cash Rules the spot
My preliminary attack keep cemetaries packed
Of niggas who think it ain't like that
MC's are gunned down like being run down with mad trucks
Them God struck, religious niggas call it bad luck
Rap celeb, you got caught up in the web
Now bees are stingin, yo that niggas em-singin
I'm just swingin swords strictly based on keyboards
Unbalanced like elephants and ants on see-saws
I throw raps that attack like the Japs on Pearl Harbor
MC's be out like bank robbers
Fleeing the scene, to be a sole survivor
DJ the getaway driver
Tried to dip but he dive I socialize on vocal vibes
On tracks stabbed up with razor sharp knives
Criminal subliminal minded rappers find it
Hard to define it, when narrow is the gate
For fat tapes and then played out and out of date
Then I construct my thoughts on site to renovate
And from that point, the God made a statement
Draftin tracements, replacements in basements
Materials in sheet-rock, to sound proof the beat box
And microscopic optics received through the boxes
Obnoxious topic, major labels, flavor tropical
Punchlines, that's unstoppable
Ring like shots from Glocks that attract cops
Around the clubs and try to shut down the hip-hop
But we only increase if everything is peace
Father U C King the police
Well if you livin in the world today
You be hearing the slang that the Wu-Tang say
Niggas that front we don't have em
So we blast em, alright, well OK
Well if you like the way it sound then clap man
And if the women love it too well then raise your hands
But only raise your hands if you're sure
Punk niggas shatter like a glass jaw, break itDeath Messiah
You're the one
Occult dreams
aren't your goal
Why you preach the Black Book
When handcuffs & whips are
Your game
Death Messiah
Your religion
Only an excuse
Death Messiah
Diabolic desires

Death Messiah
You're the king in your
morbid phantasies

You're insane
In your sick reality

Die for HIM!Our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
Chicalinda, mujer pan preciosa, chicalinda, chicalinda
Child you're born with my mother's brown eyes
Your smile my refuge in dark skies
A constant reminder that I'm still alive
In the presence of angel why cry?
Smiles and cries on my way to heaven
You are the gold seed 4th downs the line
Your picture is kept close by my side
Ask me question got nothing to hide
My prayers for mercy and blue skies
Smiles and cries on my way to heaven
Chicalinda, mujer pan preciosa, chicalinda, chicalinda
You held him close 'til he passed away, my admiration for your loyalty will never decay
Your precious blood is my blood! Your precious love is my love!
I'm holding it close every word that you say. The warmth of your heart is never far awayIs there anything worth fighting for?
Where do we go but nowhere
I lean against my own restraints
Traffic noise deflect the voices
Felt strewn down but I still ain't
Heading for defeat
Strong in mind
A will to win
I stand my ground
There's a first time for everything
Strong in heart I stalk my path
Narrow minded but oh so wide
Seldom seen a view so clear
Force the enemy on my side
It came so vast
It's all one to me
Struck down my past
It's about time to break free
Heading to win
Strong in mind
A will to win
I stand my ground
Heading for one
Strong in mind
A will to win
I stand my groundThrough the mist of foreign ground
Scattered souls of tales untold
Once forgotten scathing eyes
By damnation, lost in life
Seeking the void
The last one destroyed
Scourge of the bleeding haunted
Death and disdain, forever in pain
Scourge of the bleeding haunted
Revel in hell, bloodshed will tell
Staring into evil eyes
Fear beyond the truth will rise
Slavery of maggots will reign
Tortured human flesh remains
Once and for all
Covered in sin
Tainted in blood
The scourge of never ending pain
Caught inside the soul war
Trapped in burning graves
Suffer, Bleed and slowly die a thousand deathsOn This Night of Fullmoon
Black Candles Burn
Ancient Magick Runes
Proclaim His Return
The Nocturnal Winds are Howling in the trees
Whispering: "The Desolate One shall return!"
The Ravens have Gathered above me
As I Utter The Ancient Curse:
"Amma i piad sa madriaax!
Amma chis pir, Tonug!
Amma i adohi de piripsol!
Drilpa Vovina Torzul od Quasb ilsi!!!"Forging the future from the timeless stone
Oh let me know how far I can go
Answering the questions thet no one ever asks
Float through the sea of madness
And face the everlasting task
So lonely to wander
So sad to be alone
In the mist of the unknown
Trying to fool myself with dreams that never come true
So hard to stand my ground
Never again will I fail
[Chorus:]
Will you tell me not to wait
Tell me to live for today
As the flowers wither
I will forget my pain
Since the stars have shone
The devil has shown me the wayAs I look upon my life
There's a memory of a child
That I knew so long ago
In a distant point in time
We were once so young and free
That's where I still long to be
In the warmness of a love
That was yours and was mine
Sometimes when alone
I still think of you
Memories Of Another Time
When we were young
And the world was ours
Memories Of Another Time
We stood as one
And we never faltered
Running free under the sun
Our days had just begun
Carefree glances instead of words
Not a worry in the world
Hand in hand
We marched through time
From our childhood and beyond
Every time I close my eyes
You are all that I see
Sometimes when alone
I still think of you
Memories Of Another Time
When we were young
And the world was ours
Memories Of Another Time
We stood as one
And we never faltered
One step that's wrong can throw
Your world into the unknown
One step that's wrong can throw
Your world into the darkness
One voice unheard
Turns to silence in the void
One wheel that turns is heard
In the calm before the storm
Sometimes when alone
I still think of you
Memories Of Another Time
When we were young
And the world was ours
Memories Of Another Time
We stood as one
And we never falteredSpike the I.V. with kerosene as insects halo an open wound.
They flutter death threats in morse code and old habits are exposed.
Secret handshake decapitation.
Push the knife back in before embalming fluid seeps.
I'm pulling out the scissors for old times sake.
It's not fun and games until someone loses an eye.Blood
You are a painting in the sky
Superior legions
Run superior plans
Who's gonna change the world for you today
Well, I guess you wouldn't want it any other way
Throwing
You in and out the game
Showing
That this world will still spin when you're gone
Throwing you in and out the game
Showing that this world that we're in, not to sin
Will still spin when you are gone
Red
Who stole the gentleman's hat
Yesterday's matters
Today only letters
We haven't seen you for so long
Now that we see it all seems so wrong
Throwing
You in and out the game
Showing
That this world will still spin when you're gone
Throwing you in and out the game
Showing that this world that we're in
Will still spin when you are gone
Imminence
A proof, a hidden evidence
For no reason
Life is against you
Silent
Conspiracy
Goddamned
Are you the beat
Are you the melody
Hegemony
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the emperor of us all
Bow down, follow the pain
May guilt be thy master
And remorse be thy nameUpon the ruins of future, I climbed to behold
A distance so pale, an existence so cold
Resembling the views, these angels of damnation
As my mind came and flew
Upon the ruins of future, I stood to be told
That the future will fail upon the hands that fold
At the edge of the horizon, I saw the harmony of havoc
The path of the marauders, [Incomprehensible] yet tremendous
Upon the failure, denial of token
Upon the speech in my tongue spoken
The sign, the pulse that protrude
The resound, the return
The sequence that concludes the fall of man
The fall of man
Upon the ruins of future, I climbed to behold
A distance so pale, an existence so cold
Resembling the views, these angels of damnation
As my mind came and flew
Upon the ruins of the future
I settled to be bold
When the downfall arise, as I am told
The denomination of the grandiose demise
Granted as the [Incomprehensible] impetus
Upon the failure, denial of token
Upon the speech in my tongue spoken
Upon the ruins of the future
I settled to be bold
When the downfall arise, as I am told
When the downfall arise, as I am told[words & music by Thomas C. Hansen]
It's early in the morning
And the birds are singing high in the sky
I'm watching the sun arise
For the first time I am feeling alive
I never saw the sign, that the world would come to an end
I could never understand, why we all couldn't live in peace
We don't have much time
We all have to leave the world behind
When fire melts the ice
The only hope is here in paradise
When fire melts the ice
Nothing lasts forever
When fire melts the ice
A thunder storm is coming
The water is rising, there's no way out
A fire is still burning
But very soon it all will be lost
I can never forget, all the times that we spent together
I will never regret, that I took a chance and met a stranger
We still have each other
Cause we made it through the stormFear tomorrow's adversary
And the wealth of uprising
The final storm will be released
And the unmerciful will erect
Hidden from the eyes of your God
I will proclaim original sin
And have you all purged and purified
From the lies that remain within
Cleansed and draped
In sulphur linen
Black and pure
Since the Beginning
Mercy is not truth
Your sins are next to mine
Mercy is not truth
All your sins are next to mine
My soul's ablaze inflamed with rage and isolated in whirlwinds of hate
My soul's ablaze yet camouflaged in the haze
My soul's ablaze inflamed with rage and isolated in whirlwinds of hate
My soul's ablaze yet camouflaged in the haze
Why did He not see this coming?
What did He not understand?
One time forsaken
But forgotten I am not
Why did He not see this coming?
What did He not understand?
One time forsaken
But forgotten I am not
I will win this war
But never the peace
I am my own free spirit
Hence I will not rest
I will win this war
But never the peace
I am my own free spirit
Hence I will not rest
Mercy is not truth
Your sins are next to mine
Mercy is not truth
All your sins are next to mineWhat happened to honesty
What the hell's happened to truth?
An adverse turn in leadership's ways
A negative procession delaying our truce
What's happening to the people
Or the body of politics?
All for the crown, just for an addiction
Money, power, they need a fix
Life's drastically changing with time
There were times when our worlds looked brighter
When we had thrived on the quotes
"No false propositions, no need for liars"
[lead: Paul]
Polished specimens to rule us all
An image to portray that fools majority
Ancient atmosphere, do we recall
In which was worth trustworthy custody
Why ask what they are for?
Attempts to tell us about their gimmick is so damn absurd
Let's insurrect their rulership - eliminate their goals
Put their claims of confidence into segregated rows
Facing their false selves
Denaturalizing leaders!!!Preaching fear of future disaster
As I wonder what you truly know
watching as your dynasty crumbles
Never needing anything at all
Never needing justification
Descending darkness takes away the light
Fading further than all had expected
Sinking as I feel I am inside
Seize everything and go
It's not that having but the want
Now the move is just to
Is all that you know
Seize everything and go
Its not the having but the want is all that you know
You know?
Bringing chaos with all that's uncertain
This boat of lies will surely start to sink
Under the weight of such oppression
Missing out on what I feel is right
Casualties almost too much to take
Living proof and bearing witness
Looking for a sign of life is all
No more hope and no more passion
It's not that having but the want
Seize everything and go
Now the move is just to
Is all that you know
Seize everything and go
You know?
Its not the having but the want is all that you know
Here I lie
Know (x4)
More than need
Alone inside
More fuel for greed
Move just to
Seize everything and go
It's not that having but the want
Is all that you know
Now the move is just to
Its not the having but the want is all that you know
Seize everything and go
Seize everything and go
Is all that you know
Now the move is just to
It's not that having but the want
Its not the having but the want is all that you knowSeize everything and goAnd I see nothing I can do would change this now
This last caress I'll cherish forever
If I could I would kiss all your tears away
This emptiness can only bring sorrow
If you leave
I will follow
Wherever you go I will be there for you
I believe that our destines were entwined
Now I see that my fate's been decided
How I hope that in some way you'll remember me
Can't you see that I'd lay down my life for youHere we go!
You can take me back to the place
where I could watch the sky
and see those signs!
You can show me their lies,
show me the disbelief in their words
Oh, these burning times!
And now, I can choose my fate
Within my heart I will seal the symbol of eternity!
You can take me back to the time
where I could stand so proud
with my mind open wide
You can wash away all those lies,
the burning rain which blinds my eyes
curses my way!
And now, I can choose my fate
Within my heart I will seal the symbol of eternity!
You can take me back to the dimension,
to the state of mind
where I could be myself again!
You can clear my mind,
you can clear my thoughts
You can take away
all these fears from my soul!
And now, I can choose my fate
Within my heart I will seal the symbol of eternity!
I'll open my heart and turn my head against the northern wind
I will listen to the call, call of the eternity!Purify!
Earth inferno!
Into the void!
Plunge into darkness cold!
Into darkness, light visible!
A divine remedy!
Cleansed of all impurities!
Evaporate!
Totally absolute!
Into the void!
The light of the night!
Black holes fill the souls!
World's beauty sleep!
New faces portrayed!
Dehydrate!
The beauty of lies!
End of life's odours!
Tripod oblivion!
Marionettes!
Hung from the ceiling!
Universal crucifixion!
[Chorus:]
New order!
Re-formation!
Consumption!
New world!
Completion!
Celebration!In Maya's grip illusion transforms verity
Perceiving thus a delusive world of duality
Veil of Maya
Balance every joy with a grief
Dual scales of Maya
Earth's unending law of polarity
Ahamkara...veil of Maya
Illusion works impenetrable
Weaving webs innumerable
Her gay pictures never fail
Crowd each other veil on veil
Charmer who will be believed
By man who thirsts to be deceived
Maya subjects you
Veil of Maya
Chops and divides God's dream thoughts
The great divider
As we be subject to likes and disgust
Ahamkara...veil of Maya
Maya subjects you
Charmer who will be believed
By man who thirsts to be deceived
Veil of Maya
Balance every joy with a grief
Dual states of Maya
Earth's unending law of polarity
Veil of Maya
Chops and divides God's dream thoughts
The great divider
As we be subject to likes and disgust
Ahamkara...veil of MayaIt's easy to say we scream for change when everyday we act the same.
How can a troubled government make us scapegoats
When we don't go out and vote.
We're spewing, spouting, condemnation
That the world we live in is a racist nation
Since our opinions contradict our statements,
We show our prejudiced affliliations.
Decline of civilization
A crime against humanity,
In all our lies and our self pity
It's time to stop our apathy.
You say you're a victim in pain
But you always prey on someone to blame.
You want to end the suffering for the hungry and the poor
When they ask for help you slam the door.
You want housing for the public good
But not in your own neighbourhood.
Industrial pollution makes you sick,
But you ain't got time for politics.How different are the doors and walkways when itÃ's dark outside
The sounds and memories appear to twist and turn the mind
The rainy days have gone on far too long to be recalled
I crossed a line
And now itÃ's time
For another night
Looking for me
Behind the windowpane
The phantom face
Words seem to be in vain
Looking for me
Arriving as the dark
The shadowy
Dream-thing who bears a scarred mark
How different are the minds and mind-plays when itÃ's dark inside
I get the strongest boards to block all of my windows tight
The walls around me rise as ramparts, make me safe and sound
And still IÃ'm far
Further from home
Than ever before[Music by Marco Kehren/Deinonychus]
[Instrumental]Our life is a neverending party
Disorderliness on the verge of crime
Gallons of booze
Throngs of cheap sluts
And hearbroken naive admirers
I'm hitting the rock bottom
And soaring into euphoric heights
It's better to die young than grow old
They want us to assume responsibility
For their own benefit
Yet they don't realize we don't need them
The wolf's loyalty cannot be turned into lamb's meekness
I am a bohemian and this is the fuckin path I've chosen
In the high sea of time I have sailed all the way here
And I will go on, further than you can imagine
Look, I do what I please
And I dont care what they think
They don't dare to do it cos they're not up to it
They would love to knock me down
Yet they cant defeat me
And they won't even succeed long after I die
I will always do what they expect least
Its like sifting grain from the chaff
Pigs don't know what pigsty is
Just like people don't know what life isI have often thought to myself
Why some people don't eat flesh?
Is it the morals that we're taught
Lurking deep beneath our skin?
Bodies that are constant sources
Rich in power and in strength
Human form is far removed from
What we like to think of as
Where did the concept of eating human flesh
Become so repulsive from?
There's got to be an even better way
For others to think of what they might
Place upon their plate without disregard
I wish someone could someday
Explain to me this strange concept
For like others I am mortal
And I don't have all the answersIt is the same old path to nowhere
Built from the hands of deceit
Tenacity has failed to repair
The ruins of our hearts
That once had been complete
This is the time to carry our pride
This is the time to believe and to reunite
It's now or never
We can make this dream last forever
All we need is in us
Let it all out to be free
It's now or never
We can make our selves come together
All we are is in us
Let it all out to be free
These inner walls are insecure
Complicity calls, unmasks us fragile
We got free in us what is pure
A revelation that is not hostile
This is the time to show all our pride
This is the time to stand up and to reunite
We play dark and heavy Metal
Born to fight this abrasive battle
We are a kind of new impulse
Your engine to achieve allied resultsPeople of the earth beware
It is here in human form
An atrocity laced with greed
Filled with evil intentions
Ready to attack
Look to the air for stories
To choose, who will be your next victim
Profiting on visions of others
Dark emotions run through its veins
Its motives are false, its mind is insane
A distant planet with no signs of life
To become a home for this alien breed
Scientists of the world unite
Your services are more than needed
This creature in human form is out of control
Looks can be deceiving
See beyond the shell
Flesh and eyes mean nothing
The truth, time it will tellMy goddes waits the insatible womb
The wavy hips, the fresh blood
I'm coming back...
I'm coming back...
Kiss my lips and drink my blood
The eternity is with me
You'll se the light with guides
You'll see the space
of your own liberation
Kill me for my freedom
for my independence
Fill me for me thoughts
for my words
Kiss my lips and drink my blood
Eternity is with me
I'm coming back...
I'm coming back...You'll never let me, you'll never get me, you'll never get me away. Don't ever want me, don't ever love me, I'll just push you
away. When you plunge through me with your thinning blade, I get so turned on, about being slayed. Forever hot bitch, hot sex,
she burns with SEX REFLEX. You'll never never try me, or multiply me, I'll make you cut away. You'll just go by me, won't satisfy
me, I'll just push you out of the way. When you plunge through me with your thinning blade, I get so turned on, about being
slayed. It's not the way you love me, hot bitch, hot sex, she burns with SEX REFLEX. Hot bitch, hot sex, she burns with SEX
REFLEX. It's not the way you love me, it's not the way you love me, it's not the way you love me, it's the way that you don't...Jn alla veri virtaa

Murmur of the oaks and moans of the forests, screams of the rivers, and weeping of the streams
And a dumb look of the lakes so green, is bringing the news of my enemies to me.
Black are their clothes, greedy are their beasts-like looks
They have the law of sword, they have the fight of blood
My Land, let me ease your pain, let me give you strength
The forest is embraced with wrathful noise, and I can see the ray of your dawn
With sun it shall gleam on the steel, when it's time for war.Strapped down to the table
Unable to move
Face covered
Unable to see
The stereo on to muffle your screams
Selected for reasons
Unknown to you
Abducted dead before
The night is through
Shocked with the cold metal
As it scrapes against your skin
The blindfold is removed
Bright light shines into your eyes
Slowly regaining sight
You can see the gleaming blade of the hunting knife
Gradually pressing harder
Finally piercing through the skin
Selected for reasons
Unknown to you
Abducted dead before
The night is through
Methodically torturing you
Step by step
Despite all your cries for mercy
Your captor is slowly killing you
Now cutting
Layer by layer
Before long
Stabbing furiouslyThe curse beyond expression
Disgrace over your head
Fear of meeting your downfall
Peace alone from human hand
The Magic - Flee from life
The Shadows - Time to say goodbye
The Sorrow - Revelation of the youth
The Curse - Look into the face of truth
Blood of your ancesters
Satisfaction for justice
In the face of anger - In the eyes of fury
The fight for eternal existence
The Magic - Flee from life
The Shadows - Time to say goodbye
The Sorrow - Revelation of the youth
The Curse - Look into the face of truth
Revenge of the preacher
Victory the goal of choice
Life blown out like a candle
The day will get you , say farewell
The Magic - Flee from life
The Shadows - Time to say goodbye
The Sorrow - Revelation of the youth
The Curse - Look into the face of truth
The Magic - Flee from life
The Shadows - Time to say goodbye
The Sorrow - Revelation of the youth
The Curse - Look into the face of truthIn peaceful silence she lies there and sleeps
Dreaming of secrets concealed in the deeps
Ohh, of our long forgotten history
Those who are devoted to her know that she keeps
Ohh, in her pure soul the key, ohh, to our identity
I will guard your ancient dreams
Protect my lovely sleeping beauty
I would give my life and love
For my sacred divinity
Now the winter sun paints her in shining gold
Smiling she wakes up and asks me to hold
Ohh, her gentle hand in mine
Her graceful white body trembles in the cold
Ohh, she knows today the forces will align
Ohh, forces hating the divine
I will save you from their blind
And unreflecting treachery
I will guard your soul and life
My sacred divinity
I will always stand by your side
Save you from their tyranny
Or I will die for my love
My sacred divinity
Hear the storm blowing, see the skies darkening
On marketplaces and in churches crowds of them are gathering
Here they come marching, betraying and lying
To take our love and our souls, to destroy everything
They do not care for your soul and your purity
Nothing do they feel for you except of everlasting envy
Neither do they know nor understand your biography
They hate your beauty, hate all beauty and fear your ascendancy
After this cold day of sadness and grief
She is left without any hope or belief
Ohh, in a day after this night
Will she in death find at last a relief?
Ohh, a place of silence and light
Ohh, where everything is alright?
I broke down and cried in sorrow
In despair and misery
I cried for my love and passion
My sacred divinity
All I tried to do was stand there
Helplessly in agony
I watched them dishonoring
My sacred divinityGazing obsessed into the sky
The blue gate turns black
Watching dark clouds float by
As the memory appears
Of the planets so distant and vast
As a sign from those to the earth
An object of once burning stones
Makes us wonder in eternity
Of our mysterious origin
A sight of beauty high above
Merely for us to see
All of it not ever to discover
Only in our imagination
The morning bestial sunlight
Makes my eyes water in blood
Feeling within my systems
The universal floodThis world's yours for the taking
Run free and wild, loose your mind, escape your inhibitions
Taste the wind, let your hair down, throw your hands up
Go, go, go, let go forget the consequences
Go, go, go, let go running free
Open your heart open your mind to a new world
Spread out your wings and learn to fly to a new world
This world's yours for the taking
Run free and wild, lose your mind, this world's yours for the taking
Open wide, scream it loud "this is my life"
Go, go, go, let go, forget what came before
Go, go, go, let go running free
Open your heart open your mind to a new world
Spread out your wings and learn to fly to a new world
Close your eyes and pray for something better than this world has to give
Make it worth your time when you move on to whatever the hell is next
Know that you went in the end without a single regret
That you lived and loved and laughed and cried and followed your dreams
You won't, you won't be alone in the end
You don't have to be afraid
You won't, you won't be alone in the end
You don't have to be afraid
Run free and wild, let your heart soar with the eagles
Run free and wild, let your love take over
You won't be alone in the end
You don't have to be afraidYEAH, yeah
You feel the grass is always greener
And the tears I left behind
To know I can take my freedom
And my heart isn't next to line
With you the sun is always rising
When im with you it's never dark
With you the grounds are free from raining
With you my life doesn't fall apart
Yeah
I miss you more than ever
More than I can put to words
Every day is getting harder
to leave it all behind.
I am missing you, more than yesterday, I am missing you.
YEAH
We'll live a life filled with melodies
Now the stories is my defriend
When we fly free from promises
I try to smile but I cant pretend, no
I miss you more than ever
More than I can put to words
Every day is getting harder
To leave it all behind.
I am missing you, more than yesterday,
I am missing you, more than yesterday, yesterday, yesterday.
More than yesterday, yesterday, yesterday.
The sun is not getting lighter than yesterday
As I ever get further from yesterday
Can see the echo is closer, than yesterday
As I ever get further from yesterday
Yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
More than yesterday
I miss you more than ever
More than I can put to words
Every day is getting harder
To leave it all behind.
I am missing you, more than yesterday,
I am missing you, more than yesterday (yesterday)
Yesterday (yesterday)
Yesterday.
More than yesterday (yesterday)
Yesterday (yesterday), yesterdayIch suche nach der reinen Liebe,
Die magisch ist vollendet im Triebe
Die nicht in Gewohnheit sich ergtzt
Die Frieden gibt und mich beschtzt.
Ich suche nach der reinen Liebe,
Wo kein Zwang das Feuer schrt
Ich suche nach der reinen Liebe,
Wo nur eine Seele die Andere berhrt.
Ich suche nach der reinen Liebe,
Wo dienen keine Schande ist
Jeder Augenblick ein Gewinn
Und ich fhlen darf das ich es bin.
Wo ich Knig mit meinem Sein
Wo heilsam sich ein sanfter Schein
Auf alle Ewigkeit sich legt
Und der Gedanke meiner Ziele wird gehegt.
Ich suche nach der reinen Liebe,
Wo kein Zwang das Feuer schrt
Ich suche nach der reinen Liebe,
Wo nur eine Seele die Andere berhrt.
Ich suche nach der reine Liebe
Wo trotzdend man verderb und Hunger
Ein heiliges Liedlein singt
Wo reich man sich am Leben weidet
Und aus des Herzens Quelle trinkt.
Ich suche nach der reinen Liebe,
Wo kein Zwang das Feuer schrt
Ich suche nach der reinen Liebe,
Wo nur eine Seele die Andere berhrt.Don't look at me like that,
I am your creation,
My actions will teach you,
None of your tears can change me again,
It's too late for this!
What do you see and feel when you abuse me?
Don't pretend like you feel any pain
Forget about it, I have no conscience,
You took that from me
And now you complain about me being cruel,
But this is exactly what you want,
You want no heart,
But this is exactly what you want,
You want no contract,
You want to play and that is what you want me for,
That's why I'm your toy, my words mean nothing,
It's on the shadow of me that I'm giving to you
But this is exactly what you want,
You want no heart,
But this is exactly what you want,
You want no contract,
I've sold myself and given me away
Let me be myself again
I've sold myself and given me away
I want to give up this gameWalk away, you mask your face, hide behind your faith, no saints, no saints, just slaves. Just criminals, you're all the same. You're all to blame. And I could strike you down, but I'll just call you out. You preach a truth, a lie, a love so divine, you say we're children of god but you're no son of mine. No you're no son of mine. How can we love with venom running through our blood? How can we be loved for the things that we have done? And when we speak, we speak into tongues. To swallow your speech, is to poison the words in the verses that are sung, and you're wrong, there's shit all written in the stars. Choke on your words, I'd rather sit here and starve. Drink to cure the thirst, die for the cause. You say everything in silence in your pause. Oh, god, isn't the truth raw? Well I'd rather know that then believe love that was so god damn false. heartless fiend you say you love, but true motives speak, so listen to these words while your world decays and you will hear no doubts believe when I say that. We're all slaves living in a brainwashed age, plant in us the lies that you seed, you think you reap what you so? I'll spit it back in your face and watch the shit grow over and over and over we go. over and over and over we go. Cowardice your mark the face of the ignorant you can hide behind the cross ill live for my sinsIch denke,
ich dachte an diesen stark bezogenen Ort, seine warmen gemasteten Arme,
wie ringlos die Finger umspulten die Spindel wie zahlbare Jahre sein
Leben, fur Muhsal und Wasser Glashals er mal an gezamt gezahlten
Flaschenpfropfen, und klopfend er stand vor dem Tor wie schmachtend vor
Schemel und Webrad. "Mein Kind", fast mutig klang es, "es dreht um die
schnurrende Spindel sich leidlich ein Faden, er schnellt seine Wege im
Kreis und hold bat den Menschen zu denken, welch Einklang gegeben, wenn
Leben ist Leben und beide sind tot. "Ich sal vor dem Rad, Weil ich spurte
zu weben, wenngleich meine Finger umarmten die Spindel und ein Gewirke die
Hand, besal gewarmt ich den Stuhl, wo Serjoscha vor Tagen und Nachten
verschwand. "Mein Kind", und angstigend schon "ich webte mein Leben und
kuhn mit Verstand, versprach verlogen mich rein mit schummriegen Wachs am
Gewand, doch bat ich zugegen nicht Wehleid zu darben, wenn Zeiten mich
hegen, die ich nich verstrich..."
5 Oktober 1832You that I despise
Repentance of sorts
Death comes naturally
Not from a hated war
Repentance
Repentance of faith
Repentance of hope
Repentance of hate
[Chorus]
Not my war
Soldiers marching on
Not my war
Soldiers marching on
On your feet!
Crisis at hand
On your feet soldier!
Crisis at hand
On your feet soldier!
On your feet motherfucker!
[Chorus]
Crisis
Crisis
Crisis
[Chorus]
Crisis
Crisis
Crisis
CrisisSomehow I turn around and see
My nerves break down inside
Maybe you might know much more than me
So tell me what is right to say
Down the weakness of my soul
Lie the secrets, and I know
There's something pushing back
Wish my hands could turn to gold
And my heart would break the cold
To give my thoughts some sense
The turn is close, new century
Still people think they're kings
Now you've got your voice,
Your own speech
Don't wait 'till someone else agrees
Swimming naked of beliefs
And responsibilities
Just feel the sea of bliss
Mother nature brings to me
In fantastic purity
Everything I need
Like a teenager discovery
What's more delightful than this?
Try to remember how good it was
Feeling the life as it is
To believe!
New world was born out of man's dreams
Now we walk on our own
The angels cried, you've heard them weep
But now it's time to make them sing!"raindrops taste like tears, without the pain"
tell me that your stars have not died
tell me that your eyes do not lie
join me, in my dance
St. Vitus dance
on this cliff
oh see me, see me dawn
in my excess
yet fearfull, threatened me
and if, you wish
under your stars
under your stars I confess
someone to raise
to raise my soul
all alone
as I'm sitting in the rain
my eyes, full of tears
so is the rain
do drops bring the pain
in the black, im so tall
shake your balls
do you think the same
and I know, that there is
something like a heart
that's torn apart
let me see, let me see you
all the pain
when will I be throughHere I can hear a pin drop, silence is my friend
Have not found a helping hand
And I, I can paint in gloomy colors that will stain
But will one of them remain?
We are searching for the answers
Always take a [Incomprehensible]
We're dancing 'round the golden calf
Until the crack of dawn
The limelights fade away
On this revolting stage of our dreams
We're just about to leave the scene
Though we're still in between
On the chessboard, square of life, the pawn
So tell me where the road goes on
I, I'll be waiting for a long decisive turn
When remoteness makes me yearn
And I, I'm clutching at a straw, I'm left out in the cold
Ain't there no one to uphold
We are searching for the answers
Always take a [Incomprehensible]
We're dancing 'round the golden calf
Until the crack of dawn
The limelights fade away
On this revolting stage of our dreams
We're just about to leave the scene
Though we're still in between
On the chessboard, square of life, the pawn
So tell me where the road goes on
It's my tinge of blue
It's my superstition that blocks my machine
A slip of memory is less
What we feel with senses so keen
It's striking my eye
It is the balancing pole in my hand
Have trust in the thin rope that's under your feet
And you'll understand
When pushed to the wall
I will stand firm and follow my way
'Cause I'm pressed for time
And I keep an eye on before I will stay
Shrouded in darkness
My heart is tired, I'm racking my brain
And with the crack of a whip
I break out and break the chain
Now, pull all the stops you can
Hold on to your master plan
This peal of thunder will roar
Find all the answers wherefore
One pious wish under the moon
Only a fair wind to heave the balloon
When all seems in vain and bygone
Then the road goes onI said run.
And you won't be able to see me because you'll be bleeding from the eyes.
The thought of your genitals makes me sick and I bet you could fit five cocks up that ass.
Why don't you just strap a mattress to your back?
These are the last days of the rest of your life.
Next time I want a better excuse - dropped like a bad habit.
I wash my hands of you all.
My slate is clean.
And I'll be smiling all the way to the bank.
Face down, ass up; I want to destroy something beautiful.
By the end I want everyone dead.
By the end I'm going to be the only one standing.
Not even your children are safe.Blessed is he who has got
His transgressions forgiven
And his sins hidden
Blessed is the man whom the Lord
Do not ascribe misdeeds
And is without deceit in his spirit
Buried it deep inside
But soon a sprout came forth
It kept on growing
I couldn't hide
When I kept it to myself
Slowly my bones corroded
And my vitality vanished
Like in the summer dry
Too many people living this life
Who can take their guilt away?
Their minds are rotting
And causing an endless pain
Soon they are demented and put away
I confessed my sins to You
And did not hide my guilt
I said "I want to confess my misdeeds to You"
And He took away my sin and guiltOh sex appeal

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeahGenetics loads the gun
Environment pulls the trigger
Genetics loads the gun
Environment pulls the trigger
Welcome to my worst nightmare
Control is the search
Madness
Debilitation
Paralysis, of the Soul
Making me wish, I was never born
My evil twin is raising hell
Compulsive actions for a ritual never solved
Obsessive actions for a ritual never answered
Awaken to the howls and screams of lies every second
A chase from hell with endless traps
They hope to get the trigger
It wants a trigger
Rituals fill the days and nights
Not a moments rest from this hell
Draining my strength
Serotonin Depletion
Brain chemicals rapidly evolve
Into a monster
Dying to eat you alive
Genetics loads the gun
Environment pulls the trigger
Perfectionism
Germafobe rampant stress
Intrusive thoughts
Lies become truth and truth become lies
Feelings the new God
Emotions the new God
Feelings the new God
Emotions the new God
Genetics loads the gun
Environment pulls the trigger
Paralysis, of the Soul
Making me wish, I was never born
My evil twin is raising hell
Compulsive actions for a ritual never solved
Obsessive actions for a ritual never answered
Awaken to the howls and screams of lies every second
They wont leave me alone
like a train headed for the mind
Rituals fill the days and nights
Not a moments rest from this hell
Draining my strength
Serotonin Depletion
Brain chemicals rapidly evolve
Into a monster
Dying to eat you alive
Raised in fear
Only to no longer fearFighting our way through
We break through the day
We've become what we all hate the most
Making ourselves sick, we are sadistic
The pain we inflict always takes
Destroy all fear, defy all pain
Taking it back we regain
Manifestation our mutilation
The masochist watches and waits
I am awake, overthrow, rebellion of the mind
Overthrow, overthrow, overtake
Turbulent unrest with blood on the streets
The pressure that builds detonates
Collapse of the system, violent resistance
Fueling the fire of our hate
Destroy your fear, defy your pain
Taking it back we regain
Manifestation our mutilation
The masochist watches and waits
I am awake, overthrow, rebellion of the mind
Overthrow, overthrow, overtake
Uprising of our time
Overthrow, I am awake
Overthrow, overtake
How can I look in your eyes?
Turning away
Keeping you safe from the lies
Protect you always
My life for you
Hold you closer
All for truth
Protect you alwaysHerfor, Sigfor, Valfor, Gunnar.

I'm a fucking soldier
Just like I told ya
While I'm just warming up
You're getting colder
Out on the battleground
Let's take a look around
Well there's a million of us ready to throw down
They'll never take me alive
In the pit
Blood on the bricks
Don't look back 'cause I got your six
Won't go down, never gonna quit
Don't turn back 'cause I got your six
You know I got your back
They'll never take that
Until the bitter end
You know I'll never crack
I'll face an army
Can't fucking harm me
Out on the front line
That's where you'll find me
They'll never take me alive
In the pit
Blood on the bricks
Don't look back 'cause I got your six
Won't go down, never gonna quit
Don't turn back 'cause I got your six
I will never accept defeat and I will never quit
I got your six
I got your six
In the pit
Blood on the bricks
Don't look back 'cause I got your six
Won't go down, never gonna quit
Don't turn back 'cause I got your six
In the pit
Blood on the bricks
Don't look back 'cause I got your six
Won't go down, never gonna quit
Don't turn back 'cause I got your sixTonight - is the night of the vampire
Tonight - is the night of the vampire
If it's raining and you're running don't
Slip in mud cos... if you do, you'll
Slip in blood tonight
Is the night of the vampire
Tonight - is the night of the vampire
The moon may be full
The moon may be white
All i know is you will feel his bite tonight
Is the night of the vampire
He comes from Transylvania (?)
On St Swithens day he was born
I stand in the darkness with no-one
Makes his by turns (?)
Tonight - is the night of the vampire
Tonight - is the night of the vampire
Never sleeps in the night
Comes out when the moon is bright - tonight
Is the night of the vampireHere's a new dance craze that's sweeping the nation
It's called the toxic waltz and it's causing devastation
You're jumping up and down like a psycho circus clown
Slamming with waltzers all the way around
You get caught up in the whip
You're thrown into a flip
You aim for someone's head
To stain the floor red
Give someone a kick
To prove you're truly sick
Bounce back from some blows
And blood runs out your nose
Flailing round and round
And you're injury bound
Waltz it up, the pit is it
You can take your chance
On this rough new dance
If you dare to dive in
There are some that try
But they won't survive
They don't hit 'cause they're wimps
And this exercise
Helps you brutalize
With us, Exodus
Everybody's doin' the toxic waltz
Kick your friend in the head and have a ball
Come on and do the toxic waltz
And slam your partner against the wall
Everybody's doin' the toxic waltz
Good friendly violent fun in store for all
Get up off your ass and toxic waltz
If you hit the floor you can always crawl
Used to do the monkey, but now it's not cool
The twist and mash potato are no exception to the rule
So don't be a dunce and dance like a runt
Just throw your elbows with good friendly violent fun
Don't start to cry, if you get a black eye
Just dive back in and give another try
But too much action may leave you in traction
So you better get insurance, no matter your endurance
Flailing round and round
And you're injury bound
Waltz it up, the pit is it
You can take your chance
On this rough new dance
If you dare to dive in
There are some that try
But they won't survive
They don't hit 'cause they're wimps
And this exercise
Helps you brutalize
With us, Exodus
Everybody's doin' the toxic waltz
Kick your friend in the head and have a ball
Come on and do the toxic waltz
And slam your partner against the wall
Everybody's doin' the toxic waltz
Good friendly violent fun in store for all
Get up off your ass and toxic waltz
If you hit the floor you can always crawl
Get up on your feet
Don't look so obsolete
And thrash like an athlete
Don't sit there on your ass
Don't look like you've got too much class
You'll be harassed
You know we guarantee
This is the key, so rage or get the third degree
You begin frontal assaults
And start your somersaults
And do the toxic waltz
Do the toxic waltzYou cut my skin just to watch me heal
You make me hurt just to tell me not to feel
You're so cold
You let me in just to throw me out
You point the way just to choose another route
You're so cold
I try to figure out your intentions
You feed me your lies and I swallow them to watch your reaction
You close the doors then you tell me go
You feed my hunger the you tell me not to grow
You're so cold
You pin me down so you can set me free
You turn the light of and tell me now you can see
I try to figure out your intentions
You feed me your lies and I swallow them to watch your reaction
You close the curtains to the world outside
But in the dark I'm not supposed to hide x2
I'm not supposed to hide
I only wanted some satisfaction
I'm so cold
I try to figure out your intentions
You feed me your lies and I swallow them to watch your reactionoutside we sit at night and watch the stars and satellites
then we go inside, warm up our hands but not
the chill in my heart
harmony harmony harmony
will never be
harmony tragedy
outside we stand by day, feel the vastness, feel the wind
that casts away the clouds after rain, but not the sorrow
in my eye
and if harm comes your way, count on me I'll
wash away the fools
because my blind love evokes my blind hate
and that's alright for this is.......Through madness and sorrow
Walking hell for a mile
I vow to myself
I'll always look back and smile
When inside I'm burning
This can always be said
Here and now I stand with my
Head held high 'til I'm dead
I won't
Take
More
Madness and sorrow
Back to the wall
Feeling hell in my head
Holding a hand
Of the devil's own deck
Deal back the cards
And now I'll take my turn
Throw back three sixes and watch the world burn
There's a malignant feeling
That's born in my head
With all this black inertia
Could we be seen as dead
Through the storms and the battles
Of my life I have found
My primal born instinct is never to
Be held down
I won't
Take
More
Madness and sorrow
Back to the wall
Feeling hell in my head
Holding a hand
Of the devil's own deck
Deal back the cards
And now I'll take my turn
Throw back three sixes and watch the world burn[Instrumental]Scrotum nailed to the block,
Testicles obliterated by ballpeen hammer.
Labia stitched shut, blood runs from suture.
Clitoris removed with the yank of a hook.
Vulva and suprapubic region pulverized by sledgehammer blow.
Fucked to the cervix with a razor wire dowel.
Internally ripped, chewed, ground and sliced.
Cunt queefs vaginal blood hunks unevenly diced.
Long needle rod, barbed on the end.
Thrust deep down the corpora cavernosa.
A turn, a pull, and out comes the works.
Scrotum pulled through and turned inside out.
Piercing screams of griding groins,
Mutilation of the purest loins,
Manhood removed and women's venus.
Genitals into carnage be it vagina or penis.
Excruciating pain, castration would be better.
The pleasure of orgasm never known.
Infected needle broken in balls and thus.
Later, about to cum he ejaculates pus.
Vaginoplasty for each appalling tear.
Mangled twats beyond repair.
Genitourinary core pulverized with malice.
Obliterated genitals, vagina and phallus."Drowned in Torment" by Bolt Thrower
Pray in your dreams that tomorrow won't wake you
Plead for the darkness of life to forsake you
From death to new life the path that awaits you
You can't begin to start to bear the taste, the morning after dark
Close your eyes so that you can't see
The reality of your tormented agony
Drowned in torment your will shall break you
The scars of war remains to haunt you
Fell the cold hands of death grasping for you
As you drown in torment... drown(taped narrative):
Awake at 5am
Mr Hughes was right in retrospect
He knew the climate
I was a farm hand in Ross County
Then he came
The Hurricane
(MES):
This cleanliness won't take your brass
Mr Greaves was right in retrospect
He knew this climate
I'm not an ordinary guy
Am I?
I held yellow thick ropes
So died before him
I was a farm hand
Then came
Hurricane
Then came
Hurricane
Asleep at twelve thirty
In cosy cots
I get up early
I plough the land
Then came
Hurricane
My ears are rushed
My ears are rushed
There are characters in my brain
Hurricane rushed
Come at will

I was always awake from 5 am
Mr Hughes was right in retrospect
He knew this climate

See the northern lights on your roof
For a moment the notes stop to flow
Let the invader dance one more time
Make the notes run through your veins
And keep on crying for more
Of the ill-fated tune.
In your own safe haven, In your room
The tune shall play till you face your doom
So listen to the dark melody
Before everything ends let it play once more
Let the invader dance one more time
Make the notes run through your veins
And keep on crying for more
Of the ill-fated tune.
Let the invader dance one more time
And make the notes run through your veins
The mirror in your hands, Listen to it's laugh
As you die on your floor
Watch the invader dance to a dark tune
Before you even realise you are the poisons fool
Be lured by the tune, feel the notes run throught your veins
And hear the last note that ends it all
Let the invader dance one more time
And make the notes run through your veins
The mirror in your hands, Listen to it's laugh
As you die on your floorFull moon night in disguise
I look up to the eternal skies
My mind infected evil
Live my life not only twice
I have awakened all the pain
Which grove the world insane
You see the infernal black
You know me, I bring you
Down, down on your knees
You're tasting the disease, you see
Never cross my ways
Death, death in my veins
Hate, hate in my eyes
Your life was ended
When you surrendered
Just by my fingertip
Death, death in my veins
In my veins
"Wherefore, Oh king, let my counsel be accepted
Unto thee and break off thy sins"
Eyeball like fire, pain and desire
You're feeling the raging hate
Endless enduring, godforsaken creature
Along to survive
Death, death in my veins
And I send you to your doom
Dwelt your mind
Rape your soul, I like you to consume
Endlessly in the dusk
All night I hear you scream
Death, death in my veins
Hate, hate, your feeling of the hate
You've to self escape from
Before it's all too late
Death, death in my veins
Hate, hate in my eyes
Your life was ended
When you surrendered
Just by my fingertip
Death, death in my veins
In my veins
Like a one thousand year
Darkened dominion
The field of the dead seed
Burnt and withered
You would never consider
To the once prospering land
Day is night
And night is day
In the kingdom of the dead
Death, death in my veins
And I send you to your doom
Dwelt your mind
Rape your soul, I like you to consume
Endlessly in the dusk
All night I hear you scream
Death, death in my veins
Hate, hate, you've really got the hate
You've to self escape from
Before it's all too late
Death, death in my veins
Is there hate, hate in my veins
In my veinsI see you making eyes at me,
My heart go dumb
Even though you're out my league,
I want you!
Girl you're so complicated, I just don't know why-yyy
Can't find the words to say to you
Oooh oh oh oh
To make you see that I need a look
CHORUS:
If you wanna talk to me, talk to me
Just walk on over
A little bit of what I see is what I need
I promise I won't bite

And make your move!
Don't waste this up, don't need

Nothing you learned but the rule
Don't you forget you were the pet
No love characters in stead
Your life goes on - your death has begun
Reputable you look - but you're on the hook
Unite with your work, use tie and shirt
Just because that's what they want
The system of strings are breakin' your wings
Ignorance will build you a throne
Your life goes on - your death has begun
Reputable you look - but you're on the hook
You keep reminding yourself
That life is just life when you're active
If you expect to be paid
You have to be fuckin' attractive
You're prong on your work
No time to relax in the grass
'Cause when shit turns to gold
The poor will be born without ass
Unite with your work, dragged in the dirt
Just because that's what they want
The system you ride, the system you fight
The system will beat your life
Your life goes on - your death has begun
Reputable you look - but you're on the hook
You keep reminding yourself
That life is just life when you're active
If you expect to be paid
You have to be fuckin' attractive
You're prong on your work
No time to relax in the grass
'Cause when shit turns to gold
The poor will be born without ass.Identity murdered, malicious intent
I'm recreating myself at last
Rise up from destruction, start over again
Reborn, I'm now erasing the past
Did you think for a second
I wouldn't bother to question why
You always put me last
Can you look straight into my eyes
As you're excreting all your lies
Your time is coming fast
I'm reborn
I've seen the light
Everything now that would stand in my way
Is doomed to take the impact to come
You think you can stop me, you'd best think again
You want a piece of M? Come get some
Did you think for a second
I wouldn't bother to question why
You always put me last
Can you look straight into my eyes
As you're excreting all your lies
Your time is coming fast
I'm reborn
I've seen the light
So everything you're throwing at me
Has only helped me make up my mind
And all you do will amount to nothing
You can't effect me, don't even tryFurien gleich am blauschwarzen Himmel
durchreiten auf Wolken Dmonen die Nacht,
getragen vom Ha aus den Tiefen der Seelen,
drstend nach Rache, erfllt von Macht.
Rufe den um Gnade an,
dem Du einst Dein Leben weihtest,
da er Dir zur Seite stehe,
da er Dir die Angst vertreibe.
Auf dunklen Schwingen naht das Bse,
Tod und Teufel,
das letzte Lebenslicht erlischt,
tanze den Abschied, tanze den Tod.I want to know
Why can't we stay together
Let's stay together [x3]
(Good, bad, happy or sad)
I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do
Is alright with me
You make me feel so brand new
(It's you that always makes me feel brand new)
I want to spend my whole life with you
(I just want to spend my life with you)
Let me say that since, since we've been together
Loving you forever is what I need
Let me be the one you come running to
(Let me be the one that you run to)
I'll never be untrue
(I will never be untrue to you)
Oh baby let's stay together

Times are good or bad, happy or sad
(Good, bad, happy or sad)
Ooh, tell me why can't we stay together
(Good, bad, happy or sad)
Why, why do people break up
Turn around and make up
And I just can't see
You'd never do that to me
(you would never do that to me)
Being around you is what I see
(Being around you that is what I see)
Baby baby let's, let's stay together
(Let's stay together)
Loving you whether

Forever and ever
(Let's stay together)
Let's stay together
(Let's stay together)At first light
Deep within entrenchments
The orders are revealed
A final push impending
Encoded messages have been received
At first light
Fires of the enemy dead will burn bright
If in mourning they choose we die
Zero hour at first light
The waiting time is over
No final night before
Once more into action
Embrace the storm. Oncoming for all
Standing
At the edge
Allegiances
Now pledged... forever
Orders - unquestionable
All rank and file expendable
The frozen dawn emerges
Let the battle now commence
None surrendered through last night
Zero hour approaching
At first light
Fires of the enemy dead will burn bright
If in mourning they choose we die
Zero hour approachingI am my own self-ruler
I need not any ministry
I see our music scares you
Can't you see that
There's no truth in modern religion, a god we do not praise
There's no truth in heaven or hell or what lies between
There's no truth in a man-made bible, so who are they to say?
There's no truth, we are our own god and that's the only way
People live their lives
By something never seen
Dreaming all their lives
Of a place they've never been
Why can't you see live a lie?
Humor yourself until you die
We're atheist as you can see
We all control our can seeI'm staring into the sun
Waiting for it to fall down
I've collapsed over this madness
My hair has been pulled out
I've tried but to no avail
Me is resting, I finish
Words cannot convince the mind
When I can't believe my eyes
Who am I kidding? I am dreaming
My time is clocked in once and for all
All over again, I told myself it could not fall
But you are here as clear as the day
It's as clear as a star on my wrist
So long, loneliness, my love
What you see when you look down
At the star on my wrist
Is what I've always hoped I'd find
And it blows my mindBureaucratic crap
Can't keep me humble
Money minded saps
Are takin' a tumble
Lies
Every word becomes a lie, lie
Lies
All the words you speak are bugging me
Out on a limb
With no reply
Brain, pain
Out on a limb
With no reply
Heard about your trip
In the Bahamas
Wrote and sent you a tape
But you don't want to bother
Lies
Every word becomes a lie, lie
Lies
All the words you speak are bugging me
Out on a limb
With no reply
Brain, pain
Out on a limb
With no reply
Brain, pain
On board I ride this world
It maes me wait
You don't say
Unspoken robots seniles
9 to 5'er make me a style
Give me a break
Lies, lies, lies
Bugging me
Out on a limb
With no reply
Brain, pain
Out on a limb
With no reply
Brain, pain
Out on a limb
With no reply
Brain, pain
Out on a limb
With no reply
Brain, pain
Brain, pain, brain, pain
Brain, pain, brain, pain
Brain, pain, brain, pain
Brain, painOut to destroy
Every inch of your world
Enemy of mine
Trying to tear down all that I stand for
Built up over time
This is my final stand
My call to arms
My smile in the face of defeat
I stand alone
And face this hail of knives
This throne belongs to me
My final stand...
...among the fratricide
I learned to take the pain
Your rules of life I fail to comprehend
Is this my fall from grace?
Built my strength with the lies
Spit them in your face
I am reborn, I feel empowered
This is the only way
I'm once again...
Out to destroy
Every inch of your world
Enemy of mine
Trying to tear down all that I stand for
Built up over time
This is my final stand
My call to arms
My smile in the face of defeat
I stand alone
And face this hail of knives
This throne belongs to me
My final stand
This is my final stand[Lyrics By: Mike Majewski]
Creeping through the dark streets
enter the morgue with a hunger for meat
fuck the newly deceased I need the ones that been dead for ten weeks
Tearing and gashing a limbless torso
Voraciously stuffing my face with grey flesh
The next victim of aids this feast will be held indiscriminately
Moving from corpse to corpse puncturing
Violently, biting, chomping, gnawing on filthy meat
gore soaked, drooling pus, satisfied but not content. To my delight I find
and infant corpse without a head.
I begin to feel bile collect in my throat
this liquid filled infant is sure to please me.
I thrust my red knife in its half decayed chest
I'll begin with the heart then devour the rest.
Coughing up rancid pieces of meat
pus drip my hose I start to feel weak
I proceed to vomit this gut-wrenching feast
My insides along with the festering meat
A chunk of intestine lodged in my throat
I slice my own neck as I start to choke my stomach and vessels seep from my
neck
blood pours from my face as I approach death
Blood churning out of my face
and spilling on the floor.
The pain intense yet, I still hunger for more
As I fall dying I grab handfuls of tainted meat
I must gorge engorge these putrid steaming
mounds of flesh
Choking, on the flesh, of the dead, Insanity is my disease!
Choking, on the flesh, of the dead, Insanity is my disease!
Choking, on the flesh, of the dead, Insanity is my disease!
Choking, on the flesh, of the dead, Insanity is my disease!
Choking, on the flesh, of the dead, Insanity is my disease!
I lie dead amongst carnage
but this feast isn't complete
the vermin and maggots
will consume what's left of me
rats gnawing, bugs crawling
my dirty flesh is the feast
these insects and rats will reduce me to bones.When I see the reconstruction of souls
Evolution that is built on lies
I just watch how they create this
So called new form of life
Should I glorify those who will
Lead the blind and preach the words
What they don't ever know?
And when I hear those twisted lies
Just some seductive stories
I wonder how you can be
So anxious to swallow it
No one cares for your soul
No one cares what you feel
I don't see how you can survive
In this cold atmosfear
As I watch your empty world
Amplified by that spiritual void
I can only close my eyes and
Pray for God to save your soul
Should I glorify those who will
Lead the blind and preach the words
What they don't ever know?
No one cares for your soul
No one cares what you feel
I don't see how you can survive
In this cold atmosfearYou should have gone to Canada
You could have run away
But you couldn't shame your parents
You say you had to stay
So you get yourself drafted
So you went ahead and went
And you thought you'd be a hero
And not a dissident
War Crime... War Crime
You used to be a good boy
You used to be the best
Then you tried the drug
Ad you dreamt about the west
Everyone's your enemy
Everyone's your friend
Your world was upside down
To kill was not to sin
So you shot the wrong woman
Or you shot the wrong kid
Now Sam will make you regret
That you ever did
But you had no choice
You were told what to do
Orders from the helicopter crew
War Crime... War Crime
Back home they wanted blood
For the atrocities
For the innocent who died
On they're TVs
They demanded justice
They demanded you
They wanted to watch you hang
Till you turned blue
War Crime... War Crime
And the president said that that's OK
Because it takes they're attention away
From the real crime, the war
There are no war crimes
War is the crimeI will take good aim at the target
It is you
Give myself up to pleasure
I don't rue
I wander about in search of new game at tonight
It's you
Give yourself up to pleasure
You don't rue
Buy time!
I can drive a hard bargain
Let's talk about suffering and love
Don't say "Bye"
Come out!
What beautiful eyes you have!
It's a sin
Don't look down
I don't tell a lie
Were you deceived many times?
Can't believe the world
Wander lonely as a stranger
Yes! It's time!
Can you hear my true words?
Let's hope for the best now
Time will surely solve a problem
Don't follow the herd
I surely heal your heart and I receive all of you
I found you by chance and I fastened my eyes on you tonight
I can feel something special
Hold me tight
How's tricks?
Why do you look so sad?
Let's talk about suffering and love
Don't say "No"
Come quick!
What a beautiful voice you have!
It's a sin
Don't look down
I do not go slow
Were you betrayed many times?
You can't believe anything
Wander lonely as a stranger
Yes! It's time!
Can you feel my true mind?
Let's hope for the best now
I will surely solve a problem
It's all in the mind
I surely heal your heart and I receive all of you
Were you deceived many times?
Can't believe the world
Wander lonely as a stranger
Yes! It's time!
Can you hear my true words?
Let's hope for the best now
Time will surely solve a problem
Don't follow the herd
Were you betrayed many times?
You can't believe anything
Wander lonely as a stranger
Yes! It's time!
Can you feel my true mind?
Let's hope for the best now
I will surely solve a problem
It's all in the mind
I surely heal your heart and I receive all of youIt's 3 o'clock and we are waiting for it to rain
And I'm planning our escape
To the places we can go
To the shores that we call home
Well surly we can make it out of here
You know that we will never be clear
Of the feelings they all harbor
Well, yea I'd rather not bother
Do you feel lonely
All the time
If you'll come with me. well, then I can show you
That the lives we lead could be sure and true
And if you take your time to look around you'd see
There's nothing wrong with me that hasn't already been seen
There's nothing wrong with me
There's nothings wrong with you
There's nothing wrong with us, I'm seeing through
Nothing's wrong with me that can't be traced to you
I've folded in my heart, I'd waste it all for you
Do you feel lonely?
All the timeOn this site of reflection, you came to me as a ghost
Near this monument of the fallen, where one hears the sad last post
Celebration in the city of Ypres, again a new year was born
Not on this place of eternal silence, where quietly souls mourn
For time did not matter on this site, of the graveless dead
Near the leafless trees, we somehow met
On this site of reflection, you came to me as a ghost
Near this monument of the fallen, where one hears the sad last post
Born in different times, we never knew each other,
Born in different times, we never even met
But on this night when the world celebrates, believe met:
But on this night when the world celebrates, I regret your dead
On this site of reflection, you came to me as a ghost
Near this monument of the fallen, where one hears the sad last post
Thousands of names engraved, poor souls fate did not spare
The night was cold, the wind unkind, still wondering what brought me there
Born in different times, we never even met
But on this night when the world celebrates believe me: I regret your dead
Tragic appearance, your uniform torn, your skin full of dirt
We did not speak, nor laugh or cry, did not utter a single word
We kept an honourable distance, borders of time cannot be crossed
As ther is between the living, who hold on to live at any cost
And the dead, whose lifes and dreams along with their bodies lost
Here you appear, probably a trick of the mind that I might have lostThere's something cold inside of us.
There's something empty inside out hearts.
The bitter-sweet harmony of gentle crimes.
Can't you see? it's burning.
Afraid of being honest, afraid of showing pride.
The shade of self-deception, it's rising.
A little black devil want's to be free again.
A little black devil yearns for his dignity.
Return... repent... deliver us from evil.
Open your heart, open your heart for me.
I'm on the verge of thinking but i can hardly tell.
What drives us on and on, i'm shaking.
A little black devil want's to be free again.
A little black devil yearns for his dignity.
Return - Open your arms (open up).
Repent - Await your fallen star (wait for me).
Remind - Open your heart (open up wide / and shine on).
Shine bright like the sun. It's 1951, shine on...
forevermore. Defying what i used to be.
Defying my belief, Defying what i sacrificed.
Pretending sanity.It' s hiding from daylight inside the eastern crypt
You have seen him and shivered with his presence
He' s a killer but yet not very unlike me
A bi-product of a dimensional journey
[Vers 1:]
Something tells me I' ve seen him somewhere before
Maybe I lost a part of myself inside the rift
Flashing fragments turned into place
Incomplete as he needs the final piece, "it's me you want"
[Chorus:]
Chased by a shadow
How can we possible escape
Try to keep your heads low
But he already knows my second take
Gelhein... Who is calling me by my true name?
[Vers 2:]
[Solo:]
[Chorus:]
( Gelhein... A telepathic voice still calls me by my true name )I have something I can reveal
I get off on laughing
It's like the biggest orgasm
If you like I'll share it with you
When you give up yourself, you do it peacefully
Then you feel no plight and you think you're free
Give up yourself
There goes your chivalry
From on top of the world, I'll throw you down a rope
Hog tied to this life, I'm strapped up tight
And I won't be no slave
I can't wait to get you back
I need you back in my clutches
If it takes a thousand punches
By the end you'll be in stitches
Climb up if the noose ain't tied
It won't disturb you, it's here to serve you
Unlock the doubt, you'll find it's out, your Rosetta stone
Or you'll cut the line, and stifle time
Slash your wrist and kiss and kiss your crippled bonesYour antidote for sickness
Is the source of my cure
In a different form of course
With more pleasure
I am sure
They help me deal with the pain
To enhance the pleasure of this life I lead
An addiction or a crutch they are not
And them I do not need
[Chorus:]
But I desire them, I confess
In a strange sort of way
With no remorse, I may add
But worry not you need not pay
I'll influence your decision not
Merely show you both sides
Of the invisible line
Where pain and pleasure collide
You need not tell me of their worthlessness
They've not hurt me I believe
More harmful to some than others
So if you are some reprieve
And though it, it sounds so easy
Distinguish between the two to
You may not, may not know till it's too late
The choice is, the choice is up to you
[Chorus:]
You see I have painfully learned
To infringe my beliefs on no one
I have seen first hand
The damage they have done
I've witnessed for myself
The hands which they have dealt
The blankness in ones eyes
As their brains begin to melt
And as they plead for your assistance
In their moments of confusion
You stand helpless but say
This is only an illusion
The choice is, the choice is up to you
The choice is, the choice is up to you
The choice is, the choice is up to you
The choice which you may loseriding the devil's horse
I'm riding the devil's horse
the sinister curse has me in it's spell
degraded scalps that adorn me so well
and every time when your death glare meets mine
a phantom is gazing through cynical eyes
bounded so faithful by spiritual beasts
scattering splendors of worshipping deeds
no mercy will pump out the damned tears in me
predominant signs bring just tragedy
to the perdition - that keeps me alive
riding the devil's horse
I'm riding the devil's horse
the devil's horse
it whispers to me with languishing lips
the evil is hunger and the fire I breathe
I know that there're two ways for me to walk on
within my rage under final command
and power was given to me by the sword
the day of my wrath who'll be able to stand
nobody surviving the passage of blood
and hell follows me when I'm rising up
so follow my trace - to the destinyAll black nights, all promising days
Silence speaks loud and clear to me
I long for reason
Your healing for living
All things I've done, have failed so badly
Ideas and plans look at me and laugh
All I need is clarity
A voice that whispers "follow me"
Guide me to your shore
Leave my ruins behind
Show me the way to light
I will follow you
Whereever you go, whereever you are
I will follow, give me a sign
My way, is no way anymore
It lulls me, breaks and just throws me away
Anger builds a mental wall
But will it ever break, ever break
Finally lurking void revealed it's aims
Finally my life is nowhere
All I need is clarity
A voice that whispers "follow me"
I should run away, but to where, I don't know.
I gaze at a netherworld cause my mind went blind
Anger builds a mental wall
But will it ever break, ever breakTombstones trampled in my wake, As I see to a matter quite grave, The earth is
turned as my claim is staked, Besoiling my pickaxe, trowel and stave, Caskets
pounded and splintered til they bust, Flesh, bone and casket give way, It
smashes to ashes, crushed to dust, Shattering the decrepit grip of decay...
(chorus) Decrypt, casket crusher, Defile, casket crusher, Destroy, casket
crusher, Decrypt, casket crusher, Defile, casket crusher, Destroy, casket
crusher, Crush, fucking casket crusher... Disinterred from the soil, To
bludgeon, trash and wreck, This rotted mortal coil, Wrapped tight around your
neck, The seal is shattered in one fell blow, The splintering wood crumbling
in shards, Driven into the stiff decaying below, The rigors (mortis) of death
can be hard... chorus... When falls the hammer into the grave, So to will the
thorax collapse, Inward the ribcage and sternum doth cave, Heart, lungs and
aorta prolapse, Shattered sarcophagus driven through your groin, Skewered anus
now in shreds, Shards of pine pierce your rotten loins, So utterly fucking
dead... chorus...Flowers are fed by the guilty sun
guilty for keeping the life command
winds grow to stroms, storms bear futher sons
this is my breed ... this is the cycle of need.
If you play for me - I cannot be.
Lost in you and nothing
but peace
in my hands
nothing but a smalltalk with my death
nothing but
a pioneer who climbs the
highest mountain
to fall
And the course of the stream
makes us to madme we've never been
awakes the psychopath who rests
to watch the suffering process.
You have not pleaded for me - now I'll be
Los in you and nothing
but peace
in my hands
nothing but a smalltalk with my death
nothing but
a pioneer who climbs the highest mountain
just to fall ...Midnight, the subway train is here
There's a body on the tracks, but you're trying not to care
Sensationally wicked it roars on through in the night
"Look mom that body's got no head
It's covered in blood, do you think the man is dead?"
Your stomach turns, it itches and burns in the night
It's the devils night out, do you dare?
There ain't no hide out do you hear?
Look out! He picks out his gun, pulls the trigger with frustration
Stupidity aside it rings out with the blast in the night
A blown out brain decorates the wall
Goddamn I thought I'd seen it all
Rush to the sink, they don't care what you think in the night
It's the devils night out, do you dare?
It turns you inside out with fear!
Time heals no wounds it just won't pass
There ain't no promises that will last
The world's a ghoul and you are it's shovel in the night
And it goes without saying
No man will walk without praying
But it will do you no good unless you've understood
What's going down here in the night
It's the devils night out, do you dare?
And they've turned the lights out do you hear!?disko de oro, y nariz de platino

Keep cool, the damage is done, you've got another thing coming
I can't believe your world, I'd rather have it my way
Go face reality, I'll never want it your way
No, nothing can save you, you're gonna be dead
Die,'cause I only hate you, all words have been said
So much you want to say, it's hidden in your head
No more that I can take, I feel like being had
Your silly words will fade away, you've got no future
You cannot feel the pain inside, you little monster
Come on down into my temple for the earth
Sit in silence, and you will hear the words
And if you stay, you'll never leave, you'll never wall alone
The saviour of the universe is home
Waiting for tomorrow when the sorrow disappear
Look into the future from the center of my fears
Holy hell, please save me from the beast from down below
Shelter me from evil and the darkness of the cold, yeah!
Evil comes, evil's done
Waiting for tomorrow, the saviour never comes
To save us from the future, the world has come undone, yeah!
Evil comes - your way, evil's done - always, yeah!
Come on down into my temple for the earth
Sit in silence, and you will hear the words
And if you stay, you'll never leave, you'll never wall alone
The saviour of the universe is homeThoughts float through my human structure
The destruction of belief reflects in grief
What has become of the creator of individuals
That gave birth to life and commitments
Why reward the mistress of my dreams
With jealousy from my life's broken trust
Broken trusts entangled within - seen darkness
beyond...
...the pride of minds - your grief is for me to behold
Broken trusts entangled within - seen darkness
beyond...
...the pride of minds - your grief is for me to behold
Feeling enclosed by your will of stone
See through me, open this shell to behold
Behold me as your own trust beyond betrayal
Carved as I am in your mind of disbelief
I weep from the misery you won't share
Trust my regrets, burn the logics of thoughts
Betrayal - a virus of individuals
Betrayal - a lockdown within
Disbelief betrayed the connection of minds...
Disbelief betrayed the connection of minds...
Disbelief betrayed the connection of minds...
Disbelief betrayed the connection of minds...

Betrayal - a virus of individuals

...the pride of minds - your grief is for me to behold
Broken trusts entangled within - seen darkness

...the pride of minds - your grief is for me to behold
Broken and disrupted I fall from known reality
The ground of my strength has perished
Chaos within will see my fall to darkness
It's a grim reality that feeds from the cold
The cold of the blackheart within our souls
Arise my mistress - lead my way to redemption
Betrayal - a virus of individuals
Betrayal - a lockdown within
Disbelief betrayed the connection of minds...
Disbelief betrayed the connection of minds...
Connection of...mindsThere's dirt on my show and there mud on his back He's been chasing his nightmares for days I'm running with evil, its impending disaster I've finally steered clear of his way
I see it staring you down I feel it wrapping around Shits taking you down so quick I see it staring you down I feel it wrapping around Shits taking you down so quick
Why can't I help my friend when he won't even help himself
I can't yell at you because I've yelled at myself so many times Hard times, hard times Goddamn we're two of a kind
I can't yell at you because I've yelled at myself so many times Who now is to blame When karma keeps coming around
Hard times and troubles we all live in peril Its difficult, full of dismay He buries his feelings, he shrouds his light With oh so many evil thoughts
It's the dirt on your shoes It's mud on our back That makes us one in the same
I see it staring you down I feel it wrapping you round Shits taking you down so quick because I've yelled at myself so many times
Who now is to blame When karma keeps coming around With so many evil things
Who now is to blame When karma keeps coming around So many evil thingsThe mist carried tidings of fire and blood:
On northern waves the dragons ride.
Heaven shall mourn what darkness will scorn
on the day when prayers die.
The omens spoke of a rising beast
that sailed out from the eastern shores.
Brethren will cry and angels will sigh
on the day of the fiendish force.
Aaaah, the priory burned.
Aaaah, aflame and ablaze.
The heathen horde struck from the sea
like a cut from a tempered blade.
In black the day was hung by the foreign
dragon's tongue
on the day of the sinister raid.
A plundered parish by a pagan plague
perished under the Autumn clouds.
Their embers went cold as fate did unfold
and wrapped them in a solacing shroud.Like a razor's edge,
Your words cut me deep inside.
There's no "raison d'etre",
If you keep telling me lies!
The truth never comes out from you !
It's hard to feal real fine...
And it's sad but true:
You're a deceiver in disguise.
You're still telling,
That it's not you're fault.
All your excuses,
Won't mesmerize me.
You're only building,
A wall,made of wind,
And I watch it crumbling
Tired of waiting...
You shall lie in hell...
You shall lie in hell !!!
You should make me laugh,
But enough is just enough !
You'd destroy my soul,
You should know I won't get fooled!
Don't play with fire just stay away!
You'd always play,a dead end game!
You should think again:
I won't stay to feel the pain!
[Chorus]
You should try to understand,
You are,just totally,insane...
The filth embraces your brain,
You're not the one you claim.
If there's a place where you will dwell well,
Then you just,shall lie in hell !!!
You shall lie in hell !!
Disgusting! Amusing !
You're just a shadow of what you used to be!
You're alone! And you're lost!
You won't control again the situation!
Abuser! Deceiver!
You know you won't be back into my heart!
You'll perish! You'll vanish!
You shall lie in hell...
You shall lie,in hell !!!I've come to warn you all
A dark and deadly force
Is now beyond control
We don't have one second to lose
It's looking like
The end is coming soon
Nothing
Can stop us
From taking the fall
I know this
I've seen them
They'll tear down the walls
Search for a new life
A new day in plain sight
It's finally upon us
The morning has come
A new day is born
Leave the fear behind us
Remember the days of the storm
Don't get lost in your thoughts
There's a reason they've come
To program your mind
To their cause
And try to make you their kind
Nothing
Can stop us
Protect us from harm
For them
Leave nothing
Our destiny calls
Search for a new life
A new day in plain sight
It's finally upon us
The morning has come
A new day is born
Leave the fear behind us
Remember the days of the storm
Should I break the silence
Leaving everyone in sacrifice
Should I break alliance
With the ones
That let me keep my life
Get ready to make your move
We'll make the rules
And darken their mood
Then we will arrive
From a distance
Hear our battle cry
Show us
Save us
Protect us from harm
For them
Leave nothing
Our destiny calls
Search for a new life
A new day in plain sight
It's finally upon us
The morning has come
Escape all the violence
All in defiance
Anger fuels desire
Inside your heart
We've known all along
We can be strong
Leave the tears behind us
All that's been torn
Morning has come
A new day is born
Remember the days of the stormI won't let it tear me down. everything burns inside, broken thoughts race through my mind of love, depression and hatred. and there is no escape.run for your fucking life. twisted and beaten down, but there is no excuse to destroy what is so pure.burning in your fucking hell. you live by the choice you've made but there is no excuse to destroy what is so pure. and there is just one thing.

the words of truth and the cohort of fools.
Named the man of black for the back of his hands,
where marked in numbers fourteen and two fours.
From below the stairway, he entered the door
the torches were lit a fire, his marks were glowing more.
He entered the room, lighting the walls of stone
as the cohort at the door were pounding for his blood
the candle in his left and the book in his right
his heart spoke the names and his hands were all a light.
The man called of black
his hands were lightning the night
the night of dead moon
And the moon wept in blood,
and his words pierced it`s fragile heart.
The man called of black
his hands were lighting the night
the night of the dead moon
They were many at the door, when he spoke towards,
the icon at the aisle, was the night he ever adored.Once againthe pictures
disarray
No more empty words
that go astray
Paralize I step into
the stream
Hoping all my lies
will follow me
I feel the dawn rise in me
The light disappears
I start to regret
I can't breake these chains
I die to live again
Ever so I try to turn arround
Electrifying voices
tie me down
My senses are erased
I'm breathing in the flames
The termination has begun
I cannot break these chains
[Chorus]drapeline, drapeline... you're the sea within I flow
hatesmile, hatesmile... distant waters filter through
frontlines, frontlines... frowning joy parade to you
redsky, deadsky... you're a shelter I refuse, I hide...
... a joyful surface dance.... so unconditional
we walked the streets at night
fireworks in summerrain
and how I wish the rain to fall again
a wave to flood my life
distant seats on concrete fields
and how I wish I could not care at all
elate the open mind
trustful wounds revealed to bleed
and how I wish my blood to flow away
I walk the streets at night
leaving miles forever gone
afraid I'll never be a child againI woke up today with this feeling
That better things are coming my way (way)
And if the sunshine has a meaning
Telling me not to let things get in my way
When the rainy days are dying
Gotta keep on, keep on trying
All the bees and birds are flying (ahh ahh ahh)
Never let go, gotta hold on in
Non-stop 'til the break of dawnin'
Keep on movin' don't stop rockin' (ahh ahh ahh)
Get on up when you're down
Baby, take a good look around
I know it's not much, but it's okay
Keep on moving anyway
Feels like I should be screaming
Trying to get it through to my friends
Sometimes it feels that life has no meaning
But I know things will be alright in the end
When the rainy days are dying
Gotta keep on, keep on trying
All the bees and birds are flying (ahh ahh ahh)
Never let go, gotta hold on in
Non-stop 'til the break of dawnin'
Keep on movin' don't stop rockin' (ahh ahh ahh)
Get on up when you're down
Baby, take a good look around
I know it's not much, but it's okay
Keep on moving anyway
When the rainy days are dying
Gotta keep on, keep on trying
All the bees and birds are flying (ahh ahh ahh)
Never let go, gotta hold on in
Non-stop 'til the break of dawnin'
Keep on movin' don't stop rockin' (ahh ahh ahh)
Get on up when you're down
Baby, take a good look around
I know it's not much, but it's okay
Keep on moving anyway
Get on up when you're down
Baby, take a good look around
I know it's not much, but it's okay
Keep on moving anyway
When the rainy days are dying
Gotta keep on, keep on trying
All the bees and birds are flying (ahh ahh ahh)
Never let go, gotta hold on in
Non-stop 'til the break of dawnin'

Keep on moving anyway
Get on up when you're down
Baby, take a good look around
I know it's not much, but it's okay
Keep on moving anyway.Killing inside

Look into my eyes
They come to murder, murder now
Everyone dies
Afflict them into a wall
Look into my eyes
The wars are rising now
Everyone dies

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I feel no fear
What I fear is what is killing inside
And I know that the end is near
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I feel no fear
What I fear is what is killing inside
And I know that the end is near
Everyone dies

Everyone dies
Afflict them into a wall
Look into my eyes
The wars are rising now
Everyone dies
Take you from inside out"I'll try and continue this emergency broadcast as long as we can hold out here. Umm. The city is almost completely deserted now, there are only a few stragglers left on the streets, no emergency services. The fires continue to burn out of control. This incredible epidemic of random mass killing has spread to every country in the civilized world. Every hour more people are becoming infected - being driven to senseless acts of extreme violence. And we got reports, sketchy at best, of people mutating, their bodies swelling and distorting. Its impossible at this time to know how many uninfected people are left."
"You'll find that there is life after death - A very painful life."
-By FerretNow that all the damage is done
Your wretched soul is on the run
Riddled with guilt you wanna come undone
Let it in let the mourning come
Feel the heat
Here comes the fire - the cleansing fire
We all come to rearrange life
Yes we all come to rearrange
We're the disciples of the flames
We're acting in their name
We are the nemeses of pain
The cleansing from sin
We are the fire
You epitomize mankind's demise
Disguising hate as a social guy
Free from conscience faith and creed
Leave your burden to the fire's breed
Feel the heat
Here comes the fire - the cleansing fire
We all come to rearrange life
Yes we all come to rearrange
We're the disciples of the flames
We're acting in their name
We are the nemeses of pain
The cleansing from sin
We are the fire
Confutatis maledictis
Flammis acribus adictis
When the wicked are confounded
Doomed to flames of woe unbounded

Now that the damage is done your wretched soul is on the run
We're on red alert we'll come to rearrange all that's gone wrong
We are the fire - the cleansing fire
We all come to rearrange life
Yes we all come to rearrange
We're the disciples of the flames
We're acting in their name
We are the nemeses of pain
The cleansing from sin
We all come to rearrange life
Yes we all come to rearrange your lifeHigh in the sky Where eagles fly
Morgray the dark Enters the throne
Open wide the gate, friend
The king will come
Blow the horn and praise
The highest Lord
Who'll bring the dawn
He's the new god
In the palace of steel
Persuade the fate of everyone
The chaos can begin
Let it in

So many centuries
So many Gods
We were the prisoners of our own fantasty
But then we had nothing Who'll lead our life
No, no, we can't live Without GodsAnd I found my soul
When every feeling has been crushed by your world
And you know, I'll find
My purity inside is all that's mine
You make me feel what you feel
I will become you 'cause you know what's real
And I'll see what you see
You'll never be me 'cause I've found my soul
And I found my soul
When every feeling has been crushed by your world
And you know, I'll find
My purity inside is all that's mineTransylvanian hunger, cold soul
Your hands are cruel, to haunt, to haunt
The mountains are cold, soul, soul
Careful, pale, forever at night
Take me, can't you feel the call?
Embrace me eternally in your daylight slumber
To be draped by the shadow of your morbid palace
Oh, hate living
The only heat is warm blood
So pure, so cold
Transylvanian hunger
Hail to the true, intense vampires
A story made for divine fulfillment
To be the ones breathing a wind of sorrow
Sorrow and fright, the dearest catharsis
Beautiful evil self to be the morbid count
A part of a pact that is delightfully immortal
Feel the call freeze you with the uppermost desire
Transylvanian hunger
My mountain is cold
So pure, evil, cold
Transylvanian HungerEndless stairs
A guiding light
It seems to shine bright
But it's cold
Wicked signs will mark our way
Wicked signs will mark our way
Mark our way
Mark our way
Call me Messiah - I am god
A true lord but alone
Call me a liar - oh I won't deny
That I'm mad
Am I evil am I good
Mad existence, faith and greed
The universe a gallows Pole
Extinction of the living soul
Towards the sun we'll keep moving
Fate I hold in hand
Dancing 'til the end
I am condemned
Oh I bring all mankind's end
The end
Oh I've seen
All life die
A shattered heart an empty soul
Just one false move and it took its toll
The rising of an evil seed
I can't describe the pain I feel
Outside it's dark inside it's cold
The sun still shines bright
But its time is short
Endless stairs
A guiding light
That once was warm
But now it's bitter cold
It's freezing hearts
It's freezing souls
Soon icy shades will cover all
It pretends to be alive
It pretends to be alive
Be alive
Be alive
Be alive
Collapse of the mother
All will die
The void it frightens me
I've faced the demon
And he dwells inside
And when I laugh it's tears I hid
And when I cry it's joy inside
A foul disease has stained the land
The bitter harvest of a dying bloom
And when I cry it's joy inside
A wicked smile for all the tears I hide
It hurts to hold all the pain I feel
The bitter harvest of a dying bloom
Nothing is real
Nothing but himExplosion of dynamite emotional suicide
We'll bring you as close as we can
Universal misery assassination artillery
The camera's are making a scan
Devil in a beauty box moral bitches sucking cocks
Erections are made up for you
Everlasting media to paramountal violence
Competition the financial news
Remote control is eating my soul
Multiple choice bites you overall
It's a love hate satellite
Systematic deviation good belief or false creation
The presets are shifted by rules
Antiquated extradited sexually brutalised
The victims are treated like tools
Remote control is eating my soul
Multiple choice bites you overall
So what if you live for the screen
And you die by the screen
The information highways are overfilled
The frequencies were scanning on
Are drowning in the overcast
Please enjoy while it lasts
And I can't get enough
It's a love hate satellite
Love hate satellite
So now you're aiming for lust
Jack off in the dust
While the neighbours have ears on the wall
We socialize the human race
While sitting in a rusty coach
Please enjoy while it lasts
So now you blow up the sun
The show must go on
Blowing up the bridges that we have built
The aggression we're promoting here
Is giving you a moral blast
Please enjoy while it lastsCreature

Nah, I know, who's that solider, rollin longs nigga
Thicker than Monifah, it's I, capital F-I
The keeper of the reaper
Smokin cheba with my colonel P, Snoop and Mystikal
Pull over, I'm takin pullas
Fucked up, can't ya tell?
Take a smell, let me whiff that
Since God goes, you gone
Tatoos, that can only been choked, seven zones
I'm grown, and well known to be surviving in hell
Hangin round long enough to get through the clouds
It's something by (?)
Got a story to tell
Which is, the life of the baddest
Born from ashes, the smoke of dead, of an addict
Got to have it, cause baby boy, it's a habit
Puff it and fuck some pussy, and see which one I grab quick
I'm that sick, I need weed to proceed
Like a band-aid for a cut, hopin to stop the bleedin
No, not the seeds, I done paid for the pickin
Only the green stickin, for the record
[Chorus:]
[All] (Fiend)

Ever since my first puff, it seems I couldn't get enough
But I just couldn't quit I had to have another hit
I'm smokin green with a fiend by the age of eighteen
I chop a pound to the ground, went cavi on the triple beam
Once upon a time, before I used to bust rhymes
I had to scratch to get a nickel, in order to get a dime
But times done change, now I'm havin mines
And I'm protected by the tank, No Limit, and plenty nines
I grinds to the fullest, so when I'm finished I gots to pull it
I'm lookin for that green shit, boy you bite the bullet
For tryin to sell me bullshit
You know I'm lookin for the bombest weed in your town
Now, I'm a smoker
Now you know what that mean?
Check this out Fiend, everytime a nigga go outta town
Somebody always approach me talkin bout "I got the chronic,
We got the chronic." Muthafucka, chronic ain't brown with
Seeds and stems in the bag nigga. Who got it?Born and predicted to always be wrong
The same old bullshit the same old song
Familiar patterns, familiar hosts
The city's crowded with the sideshow ghosts
The city of refugees, they're all in fatigue
You're all bullshit of the same old league
Familiar patterns, familiar hosts
The city's crowded with the sideshow ghostsYou have all wept once more... why?
I would never ask for such. Go.
I have realized for once in my existence my true happiness.
This is a first time for me... I feel innocent, caring, and non-threatening.
Reincarnation for a better life... becoming one with true harmony.
No gods have caressed or burned me, only nature is willing to comfort me.
Salvation is dead and all of you have passed away with me today.
I will never have to entertain or please any of you ever again.
I am alive. My memory is the only thing keeping the old tears in my eyes.
I still know that all of you are taking for the sake of not leaving.
You are killing the innocent for your so-called nutrition.
You are infecting our lands with your filth.
You are killing for the sake of your promotions in life.
One day we will all be in this soil...
with no gods to slave to, and no heroes to kill for.InstrumentalTake me home
Imitations surround me
You are all I want to see
So why do I turn
To embrace what will never last
All my life I've tried
All my life I've failed
And one day I will see
Surrounded on every side[Music: S. Drover, G. Drover]
[Lyrics: S. Drover]
Watching - as the rain keeps falling down
Waiting - for the pain to knock me down
Malign indifference - frothing at your peace and glory
The naked truth - fish-hooked in your halo-story
The grand illusion - will you take me to the life you've chosen?
When all else fails - will you follow me to mine??
Subjected to your deity
Now dejected from society
Detained in hypocrisy
As you pull the trigger - and fail!
Doubled over - from the pain you've put me through
Misguided memories - I've suffered onto you
Preach your peace - a world of cold distrust
Inept in solitude - now wince in cold disgust
To keep me locked away - attempt's to no avail
Destruction of my soul - your life I now assail
Subjected to your deity
Now dejected from society
Detained in hypocrisy
As you pull the trigger - and fail!
[Solo - Glen]
Compassionate state - is a grand mistake
I am fixed to you - my rage is blazing
You've captured me - at an-all time low
My heart in apt to release
To keep me locked away - attempt's to no avail
Destruction of my soul - your life I now assail
As lies fizzle away - true sickness revealed
My life will go on - your test has failed
Subjected to your deity
Now dejected from society
Detained in hypocrisy
As you pull the trigger - and fail!A Curfew For The Damned (...Blind Belief)
You true beiever. Die man deciever, for
your prophecies. A fatal release. The tem-
ple of the holy. We will blaspheme. There
are no blessings, only a dream. Christia-
nity = Insanity. Just another sect. None
shall resurrect. If once you have been
'signed' to the creator of mankind. You're
far beyond control captured soul. Light
the candle. Light the lie. Yet another soul
will die. The blessing that'll never come.
Lies to us, truth to some. As I see the
candles lightning up their 'sanctuaries'.
When we die what happens only obitua-
ries?? When only remains remain, and
no one's left to blame. All words are
deiable, go and burn your bible. A cur-
few for the damned. A curfew for the
damned. (*) Realize, realize. A curfew
for the damned. Real eyes. Realize a curfew
for the damned. God is just a dream,
kneeling at the altar of lies. Illusions of
a false paradise. Deny the crucifixion of
a their 'saviour' Jesus Christ. To the force
of heaven, none was sacrificed. Their mas-
ses are all erratic ruled by a sick fanatic,
possessed by demons (?) Scch! I hear cries
of a human sacrifice, and when will it
end?? A curfew for the damned.Last cry, defeated now's my soul
First lie had sealed the fate of mine
I pray to whom it may concern
a final tear, I leave the light
Now you will pay me the price
In the way I have payed for your lies
in disguise now my face I'd to turn
and I laugh as I'm watching you burn
Good-bye, false friends I need no more
Farewell, and look into my eyes
you tried, but I will give you more
I haunt your dreams, take you away
Look out, noone can judge my deeds
disgust to taste the blood you bleed
your soul, a cripled piece I love
to see you rot in fire's lightDo you hear my voice? It is my way
Do you feel my coldness? It is my way
If you call my name, it is my way
Follow me on my way
Into our eternity
Of emotions and thoughts
Close your eyes for my way
Open your soul for my way
Give me your thoughts for my way
Trust lies, mistrust truth
Hear silence, see the night
Follow me tracks of history
Into the light of space and time
Obey my way and be silent
Listen to my voice, it is my way
Feel my coldness, it is my way
Call my name, it is my way
Hearing, feeling and seeing
That is my way, I am your wayI Immaterialize

Book of lies, we, who bash the church
And spit on the cross, for we are the

Morbid fear - in the dungeons
Tied to the rack - knife across your breasts
Beaten and strangled - brutal shattered chest
Suffocate in blood
Exorted confession
Intense excruciation
Total evisceration
Await the execution
Nails driven into your eyes
Crucifix pressed to your forehead
Evil exorcised
Fucked by the bishop - in front of a laughing crowd
Forced down on your knees - Swallow holy cum
Torn out vagina - sawed off limbs
Glowing iron in your anus - broken on the wheel
Ripped to shreds

Now you are carried to the pyre
Soon to be released

Menneweger, *28.7.1978 - 17.4.1997 (R.I.P.))Im on my way to the top
Screaming catch me if you can but I cant be stopped
Im just tryna be the cream of the crop
But right now Im the cream of the not so hot
It takes time but Im holding the clock
All I need is one chance and thats all that Ive got
Read the script but Im changing the plot
Changed the game you could say that Im changing a lot
So Im turning heads got to make a name
Got to point to prove got to make a change
New chapter in life so Im turning the page
Wont stop till the whole world remembers my name
And Im here to stay and I cant be stopped
And Im on the ladder but its a long drop
People pray for my downfall, pray that I flop
Get lost cause Im working my way to the top
Cause Im on my way, to the top
And nothing can stop me baby
Move out of my way, this is my time
And nothing can stop me baby
Cause Im on my way, to the top
And nothing can stop me baby
Move out of my way, this is my time
There aint no stopping me baby
Road ahead is long and seems winding
Im on my way and what perfect timing
Theres no escaping the fame no hiding
Im just taking my time, biding
Musics simply a mountain Im climbing
Got youth on my side no fountain provided
So when I stepped on the scene explosion
Or earthquake like tectonic plates were colliding
Ill make you all stand up and take notice
Always improving maintaining my focus
Been at the bottom of the barrel for while
But Ive got to start somewhere its part of the process
Oh yes, set destination
TV, onstage radio stations
Im representing the nation
Its bomber and music is my occupation
Cause Im on my way, to the top
And nothing can stop me baby
Move out of my way, this is my time
And nothing can stop me baby
Cause Im on my way, to the top
And nothing can stop me baby
Move out of my way, this is my time
There aint no stopping me baby
Theres only fame on my mind
But Im just taking my time
I put my heart in the music
Title Im making it mine
Theres only fame on my mind
But Im just taking my time
I put my heart in the music
Title Im making it mine
Cause Im on my way, to the top
And nothing can stop me baby
Move out of my way, this is my time
And nothing can stop me baby
Cause Im on my way, to the top
And nothing can stop me baby
Move out of my way, this is my time
There aint no stopping me babyEN UN SUEÃO
Como una pesadilla que no acaba jamÃ¡s
El culto a la violencia why gentes que se van
Regalando sus vidas por un gran ideal
Que solo los de siempre llegan a disfrutar
Viviendo en la mentira, creyendo que es
verdad
corriendo al infinito sin meta que alcanzar
Perdiendo la sonrisa, ganando en vanidad
Huyendo de los locos, why cada dÃ­a hay mÃ¡s
A veces es mas fÃ¡cil reÃ­r why no llorar
Jugar al no me importa, pero en mi soledad
Cansado de palabras, cansado de esperar
Un grito en el silencio...-alguien lo
escucharÃ¡...!
Me imagino paseando en un sueÃ±o...
Imagino a la gente feliz...
Imagino niÃ±os sonriendo...
why en mis sueÃ±os que estÃ©s junto a mi
Me imagino paseando en un sueÃ±o...
Imagino a la gente feliz...
Imagino niÃ±os sonriendo...
why en mis sueÃ±os que estÃ©s junto a mi
(2)Follow the bleeder, undamned you decry
Consummate spirits never allow the lie
Open your heart towards that your mind feels
Death is to conquer all that is surreal
Fortune's enlightenment, hopeful rays of light
Dramatic abundance, shattering the night
Grow biting conflict, halted to an end
The future is certain, the hope we defend, defend
Magnificat
Up holding the righteous, onward march begun
Deftly remolding a darkened vision
Strength within unity, mind linking mind
Enveloping beauty, the next humankind
The filth that we all have to climb through
The filth we have to take
Suffering it evermore, irenicon, the wake
My soul doth magnify
My spirit has rejoiced
Remembrance of mercy
To his seed forever
Yet they lead us to the slaughter
Like they lead a horse to water
They can't force us to drink but we do
Magnificat throned
Persevere
So teach us to number our days that we may
Push hearts towards wisdom and fade off the gray
Interventions looming on our dawning world
Hope springs eternal, a hope now unfurled, unfurled
PersevereLike insects of the night, we are drawn into the light
Feeding off the star glow energ, controlling our fate
Bloodsucker selling hope to the hopeless
Newborn messiah or the devil incarnate?
Surrounded by a field of lost souls
These feeble minds - so easy to control
Salvation
Damnation
It's all the same to you
But does anyone really know
What the future holds in store
A day will come
When the sun will rise again
Rays of black will shine
And together as one,
We will walk in the dark of the sun
Say a prayer for the unborn child in the womb
The children are the heirs of this dogmatic chaos
Is there a future in this claustrophobic tomb?
We can only rely upon ourselves, to save us
We are the resistance, our last line of defense
Prepared to fight for our promised land
Rebels at heart, they will hunt us to the ends of the earth
The chase is on, forever going on and onGreetings from the home of Death
A place devoid of hope
Where sanity and reason twitch
Upon the hangman's rope
Greetings from a nightmare
From a place that should not be
Where spirits congregate
In ectoplasmic revery
Welcome to our town
You just may find it suits your tastes
Until you feel the Reaper's
Clammy breath upon your face
Welcome to our home
And tell yourself it's just a dream
It's time for you to die now
So enjoy, and pleasant screams
MANIAXEThe foundation of our upbringing was her heart beating. Within vessels lies
the fluid. I know it tastes like mine does. Epidermal layer, porcelain.
Paper thin, but it holds her in the inside light. The length of her lungs
could be measured by a breath. By a breathless moan, her whisper. Her marrow
matter means everything. We sipped her sweat through the floorboards, every
drop. Down there. The warmest den. The pinkest lips on the hair thin slit of
a hollow shell that held it all. She's a miracle.There is a theory about us
What we always never
In the background on the shadow
Another theory about us
Today's evidence taken by the new wave
Just like the Sun which can be moved
With words we can stop the Earth
Today's evidence taken by the new wave
The falsehood dies in the silence
And the honesty has the same fate
Just like the Sun which can be moved
With words we can stop the Earth
Today's evidence taken by the new wave
Just like loving without love
The rapid stream can be stopped
Today's evidence taken by the new wave
The false hands turning to dust
Mother's hands have the same fate
Just like loving without love
The rapid stream can be stopped
Love which always never
Not like the evidence
With the taste of the shadow
There's only a theory
Even you even meWeak midnight promised of love
Were wept upon Her grave
And shunned by stars above
In mortal life lurks my dismay
An Angel stole my heart
and Death took Her away
She sleeps beyond the grace of God
A dreamingly beauty
If wishes could only fray that bond
Twelfth moon arose with ghostly voice
A poet's serenade
Her name a whisper pon my lips
And lo, Rorasa came
"Fear me not my grieving King
Funeral in breath
The secrets of the dark I know
And thus, we shall cheat Death"
My promises wrought through despondence that night
Have delievered me gifts from the grave
Rorasa enshadowed me gifts from the grave
Never a Devil so vain
The Angel is fallen, for I thought her lost
And no heaven would silence the pain
Teach me these secrets, the sensual frost
Desire for warm blood again
Princess lay down they florid cheek
In drunken splendour
Tonight rare regal fate has cast
The wolves among the sheep
Dark nature clasp my soul
Around Her throat mine arms enfold
To sleep, perchance to dream
And then...
To dusk and flesh ascend
The sun descends magenta spirits fill the skies
and wreak erotic maladies where sex and Death abide
From writhing tides where gothick siren weave their song to shore
Through the ashes of the battlefields where ravens and angels war
We rule like the red and risen moon upon the sea
The stars of judgement silent, for we share joyous
Eternity
Damnation
Salvation
Stigmata plague
The wine of Bacchus flows
Listen to the thunder rage
Deceivers dragged before their cross
I am He that vanquished Death
And bore the sting of loss
What vulgar christ will uprise my grasp
His temple, ruined, burns
And sweet Rorasa laughs
I am enamoured and impradised
To catch the fires dancing profanely in her eyes
"I will crush them all
If this holds thy delight"
Rather dead forever than to lose her
Nymph-lascvious AphroditeSo let it be felt
Aftermath
Shades of hell
I set them free
But struggle
Eternally
It's too late now
To turn the clock around
Frozen world outside
Made by foolish pride
Time to mend
Your life begins
Breathe for me
Make me feel
I'm not alone

No appeal, no "I got a raw deal", I don't give a fuck

Bodies are the canvas, ammo is the vision

Tearing everything apart
I'm building a monument to horror
A temple so divine
Remembrance to those I've massacred
Death the grand design
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
People will stare in disbelief and awe
When they see what I've created
Still life, no life beautiful and raw
The world will be captivated
Never have they seen something so ambitious
Like nothing done before
A work so terrible and vicious
A masterpiece of gore

[Chorus][Instrumental]You are so fixed with yourself
That you can't behold your life passing you by
Wake up brisk before you vanity breaks you
Open your eyes while you still can
When you need me - just before the memory you
Hear my voice coming through your mind
When you need me - just before the memory
Hear my voice coming through your mind
Your friends suffocated by your ego
Your siblings haven't known you for a long time
Even death refuses to tread on your doorstep
Ensued the false passage all your life
When you need me - just before the memory you
Hear my voice coming through your mind
When you need me - just before the memory
Hear my voice coming through your mind
No one here that misses you again
No one here to show you how to fly
Have no respectt for life
Have no revernce for death
Mercy a world used by losers
Pain and sorrow gifts from heaven
Never will you love
Never will you live
When you need me - just before the memory you
Hear my voice coming through your mind
When you need me - just before the memory
Hear my voice coming through your mindDIE

BOVINEAchtes Kapitel
Ein Mdchen im grnen Prinzessinnenkleid hockt barfu auf einem wackligen Stuhl vor einer staubigen Jammertruhe, die sich in der Sudelei all der schlampigen Toten in ein furchtbares Werkel verwandeln lie. Um den Hals trgt das Kind eine Melodika geschnallt, in ihren Mundwinkeln hngt eine alte Kindertrompete. Aus den gesumten, doch lchrigen Taschen luchsen verschiedene Plastikpfeifchen und -trten hervor. Die Figur des "Mdchens im Prinzessinnenkleid" versteht sich als merkwrdige Mischung aus verletzlicher Kindfrau, morbider Musikclown und kindlicher Chansonstar und ist somit erst Gast und dann Bewohner jen' sterbender Gegend. Vom Teufel geritten klimpert das Mdchen auf den angesuerten Tasten dieses Wimmerkastenpianos und starrt in die Leere der durchwegs stickigen Sumpflandschaft. Zur selben Zeit kauert Kezman, des Teufels General, in einer Furche vor dem Ringelspielgau und dreht an Urians Kurbel. Er holt das Kind zu den Toten.
EINLEITUNG
Das Mdchen summt und summt, klimpert und klimpert.
DER TOTMACHER (flstert)
Komm, komm, mein Kind, des Teufels Wind entfrbt deinen salzlosen Leib.
KEZMAN
Er hascht dich zum Glck und mordet ein Stck, er macht dich zum ruchlosen Weib!
DER TOTMACHER (flstert)
Er streichelt dein Haar und ksst unsagbar.
Mein Kindlein, so schn ist der Tod!
DER TOTMACHER
DIE BUCKLIGE
Das Mdchen im Prinzessinnenkleid, es kratzt so furchtbar am Tod.
Es huscht ganz blass in Sumpfes Gezeit und springt in den eigenen Tod.
KEZMAN (flstert)
Der Krper wird kalt und ihr Atem verhallt!
BERTRAM, DER KNECHT
DIE BUCKLIGE
Das Mdchen im Prinzessinnenkleid vergllt in Teufels Gemach.
Es trnkt sein Kleid in die moderige Luch und stirbt ohne Zank und Gelach`!
CAMBIASSO
Du welkendes Ding, so makellos rein,
versenkst deinen eigenen Schrein.
WERKELMANN (DIE BUCKLIGE)
So klein ist der Tod, wenn er's Kindlein entdeckt,
wenn er schaukelt sein bitteres Boot.
Du, mein Fratz, gehorsames Kind,
tauchst ein in diesen Tmpel.
Dein Kleid, es nsst dich blass und fahl und drr und klebt an dir - wie der Tod?
Du sinkst in diesem Weiher ein (Wo ist dein Hndchen?).
Sprst du ihn? Er macht dich nass und kalt und blau und...hbsch!
DIE BUCKLIGE
Kindlein, so schn ist dein schmutziges Haar!
Es zappelt im dreckigen Pfuhl!
WERKELMANN (DIE BUCKLIGE)
Du, mein Fratz, ach sterbendes Kind,
hllst ein dich in teuflischem Wind!
Dein Kleid, es nsst dich blass und fahl und drr und klebt an dir - wie der Tod?
Du sinkst in diesem Tmpel ein (Wo ist dein Kpfchen?).
Sprst du ihn, er macht dich nass und kalt und blau und... teuflisch!
DIE SCHWARZEN PUPPEN (DIE WEISSEN PUPPEN)
Das Ding ist fort!
Das Kind ist tot!
Wo ist das Kind?
Das Kind...es lebt...bei uns!
Wo ist das Kind?
Das Kind...ist nun...bei uns!Golden Tears
Form from my eyes,
The blast of sand on my face
Marks the beginning of my punishment.
But now it is too late to regret.
Wandering the labyrinth of tears
Scaling the pyramids of despair,
The gods have now decided my fate
I have to go through the seven lands of sin.
The breath of air
Gets heavier and heavier.
My body and soul
Are torn apart in turn.
Beholding the infernal ballet
Of the roaring elements
I'm left facing my fate
Like a helpless slave.
Wandering the labyrinth of tears
Scaling the pyramids of despair,
The gods have now decided my fate
I have to go through the seven lands of sin.
Encounter with the Wind God
I yearn for conquest and blood
Once again I become a warrior
I shall not put up
With this sanction without rising up
Only blood will tell, pure or tainted,
Whose decision, will go unheeded.
The chaotic power of steel
Has just marked its boundary.
I fall, overwhelmed with pain,
Evil shall never prevail again.
Eternal Downfall
My agony shall linger
I beg for no mercy;
the six remaining lands of sin
That's where I'll wander
Bound with rage and dignity.If I was the son of god
I'd live alone nude in the wilderness
The animals would speak to me
And approach me without hesitation
The birds would sing to scarecrows
In circadian rhythm
Inside the garden of desperation
A voice could be heard
And all the plastic politician devils cry
As all the skyscrapers come crashing to the ground
What ever happened to a quiet simple life
Innocence is lost as we near our final day
Deep in the forest
The apparitions are all in attendance
Phantoms and specters
Converge in silence under the moonlight
Behind this illusion
Is a union of theanthropism
Inside the garden of desperation
A voice could be heard
And all the plastic politician devils cry
As all the skyscrapers come crashing to the ground
What ever happened to a quiet simple life
Innocence is lost as we near our final dayHate Breeds Hate, And I Like To Watch It Go
Restless Souls Rule The World With Their Bare Hands
I Feel No Fear As I Face The Gun
I Pulled The Trigger, You Lost I Won
How Can You Say It's A Sacrifice
When Your Life's Your Enemy
Slave To Your Own Restraint

But The Only Way To Get There
Is To Get Out
Die
You Try To Fight It Year After Year
You Know It Was Meant To Be
Your Life Is Your Enemy

...exit the pentagram...return with knowledge...Wakeup now, and join all in -
into this dance you came to see.
Watch me now for I am born
I'm born to fit this melody.
And no one asks how I might feel
A creature built to do this task.
I'll live with you this hour long
And fade with the lights as you go.
But that's what's there to bother me
For you are here - you paid to see
A tale so pretty, yet sad and mean,
And not an "Idea" in agony.... and after years in dark tunnels
he came to silence
there was nothing...
he realised that the cheering cries of worship
were but echoes of his harsh outspoken word
reflecting back at him from cold and naked walls
in hollow circles fled illusions of wisdom he had heard
"From nothing came all I ever knew"
and he beheld the ruins
of an empire torn apart
yet, no grief nor rage did bind him
just silent and bewildered
by the emptiness
he stumbled off his throne
suddenly, the walls around him cracked wide open
and an endless void appeared in flickering, grey light
"What force, but silence, has deprived me of my coil?
No trail to guide me. No point of reference in sight."
"By nothing, resurrection will be pure."
and he beheld the ruins
of an empire torn apart
wiping dust off his shoulders
just silent now
in this emptiness
leaving all behind
step by step
past all past
slowly he approached the surface
nothing left
to sacrifice
the mirrors mocked him on the wayI love myself, I want you to love me
When I feel down, I want you above me
I search myself, I want you to find me
Forget myself, I want you to remind me
I don't want anybody else
When I think about you, I touch myself
I don't want anybody else
I touch myself
You close your eyes and see me before you
Think you would die if I were to ignore you
A fool could see just how much you adore me
Get down on your knees and do anything for me
I don't want anybody else
When I think about you, I touch myself
I don't want anybody else
I'm the one who makes you come runnin
Gets you comin all the time
When I'm around, you're always beggin
I wanna make you mine
I love myself, I want you to love me
When I feel down, I want you above me
I search myself, I want you to find me
Forget myself, I want you to remind me
I don't want anybody else
When I think about you, I touch myself
I don't want anybody else
I don't want anybody else
When I think about you, I touch myself
I don't want anybody else
I touch myselfThis luck you can't buy
Won't touch you this time
One day this dirty stool pigeon will fly
Halos and charmed lives
I'll help you next time
One day this dirty stool pigeon will fly
And hear the angels sing
Reach out and spread my wings in hell
Your luck has run dry
Caught in the bullseye
Today this pretty little birdy will die
Will die, will dieWounded by pleasure in flower of youth,
Measure for measure, tortue for truth.
Passion is my highest good.
Flesh and blood am I, my lord.
Lost to plan now, lost to purpose,
Won for better or for worse,
Lady-in-waiting for you am I,
Watching moments of glory pass us by.
Passion is my highest good
Flesh and blood am I, my lord.I don't wanna close my eyes
I can't tell if I'm asleep or if I'm blind
We're going nowhere
No one seems to care
I could sell a peace of mind
I could tell you every time that I divide
The water will decide
Where to feed me
Mother don't you cry
Hell don't need me
I will see it all in timeâ¨I can't be the only one across that line
We're going nowhere
No one seems to care
The water will decide
Where to feed me
Mother don't you cry
Hell don't need me
Don't need me
Don't need me
Don't need me
Don't need me
The water will decide
Where to feed me
Mother don't you cry
Hell don't need me
The water will decide
Where to feed me
Mother don't you cry
Hell don't need me(Jimmy P. Brown II, George Ochoa)
Chipped beef, such a treat, one jar of dried beef
Two cups of whole milk, one tablespoon of cornstarch
Two tablespoons of butter, half package of frozen peas
Fresh if preferred, salt and pepper, to your own taste
Here are the directions, follow closely
Fry the beef in the butter, in a medium saucepan
Add the milk then the peas, then salt and pepper to taste
Mix cornstarch with quarter cup of whole milk
Then add mixture to simmer ten minutes or so
Although the recipe calls for fried, fried linguine
I prefer several layers of warm buttered toast
Lightly toasted
Ahhhh!!, man, aaah!!!Our world is burning as demons control the earth.
Political killers, they strip us of all we are worth.
Condemned us to fire, the masses are thrown into the flames.
Apathy has destroyed us, but we search for someone else to blame.
The beast is upon us.
The final days in the age of lies.
Witness to apocalypse as the blood falls.
The blood of heaven.
The blood of angels fall.
The kings of the earth, in their quest for power have condemned us all.Your Life no longer has any value
Let them tell you what your own life is worth
There is no compassion as life fades away
This self deliverance the choice you have made
Contemplate your last breath
As you see the face of death
Contemplate your last breath
Breath, slowly breath
Goodbye
The pain in your life I cannot perceive
Crimes of humanity I see and believe
Contemplate your last breath
As you see the face of death
Contemplate your last breath
Breath, slowly breath
Goodbye
Like the knife that cuts through me
Stabbing uncertainty
It bleeds my life I know
Draining my heart my soul
Contemplate your last breath
Breath, slowly breath
Goodbye
GoodbyeWhy can't I hear you breath
Why can't I hold you now
You just told me on the phone
Bad news I can't believe they're true
Fate is so cruel to you it seems
It caught you at your weakest point
Nothing left of your whole world
Besides chaos and smoking ruins
You thought there's nothing more to lose
You're wrong and he presents the proof
Please fight the devil inside you
Not enough time for us to spend
Why can't I hear you breath
Why can't I hold you now
You will need all of your strength
I hope that you can carry on
You fought the shadows of the ghosts
Now he's the one you will fight next
Knocking at your door as if
He is a guest you like to see
Don't let him in, just push him back
He is not welcome in your house
Please fight the devil inside you
Not enough time for us to spend[Instrumental]Los oteros de drogas no son maquinas
El brujo no es cabran
La ciudad pinches indios
La subasta de putas, muchachitas bien
Jovenes why firme
Traete un hule, un seis de cervezas
Indios huevones los tienen colgando
Fila de bueys un chingo de largo
La bolsa de plata - lo tengo colgando
Madrota bruja - quanto nos cobra
"Lo mismo que siempre pendejo"
Diez para ustedes, viente para el gordo
Los soldados mas cargados
Quieren dos veces
Los tengo colgando!
Los soldados mas cargados
Quieren dos veces
Brujo paga para una cogida
Saquen el borrego, para los que
No aguantan
El pinche gordo fue dos veces
Pinches putas hartas de mecos
[English translate: I've Got 'em Hanging (Shitload of Cum II)]
Drug lords are not machines
El Brujo isn't a bastard
The city... natives
Whores for sale, good little girls
Young and firm
Bring a cum rag, a six-pack of beer
...natives have them hanging
Oxen in line for a long fuck
The sack of silver - I've got it hanging
...witch - How much for us?
"The same as for every asshole"
Ten for all of you, twenty for the fat one
The most loaded soldiers
Want it twice
I've got 'em hanging!
The most loaded soldiers
Want it twice
Brujo pays for a...
Get out the lamb, for those who
Don't hold back
He... the fat one twice
...whores full of cumwhen did it get so hard to listen?
When did my ears go numb?
Maybe if thinking followed speaking, I'd understand my native tounge.
PICK YOUR POISON!
CALL YOUR BURDENS!
PICK YOUR POISON!
IGNORE YOUR PURPOSE!
We don't wanna live if we have to give up our comfort! (Woah-oh).
The problem isn't you, it's just in your one another. (Woah-oh).
Why don't we think the same, when our opinions change?
I know what I want, and I want NO! (One).
This is the same old song and dance, crying out give me another chance.
It's pretty hard for me to learn my lesson.
When I push the limits 'til im, BARELY BREATHING.
PICK YOUR POISON!
CALL YOUR BURDENS!
PICK YOUR POISON!
IGNORE YOUR PURPOSE!
I'm Not Useless! I'm Not Useless!
We don't wanna live if we have to give up our comfort! (Woah-oh).
The problem isn't you, it's just in your one another. (Woah-oh).
Why don't we think the same, when our opinions change?
I know what I want, and I want NO! (One).
IM NOT USELESS, IM JUST THE KING OF EXCUSES! X6Cancer humanity, necrofertility
Gods sent the plague as a cure
Blood soaked infinity, greed ruled endlessly
Welcome, the end of our times
Welcome, welcome, welcome
Welcome to the end of our times
Await the final day, rotten in fields we'll lay
Curse of the mankind soon fulfilled
For all our deeds we'll pay and even though we may
Regret our crimes, it is too late
Welcome, welcome, welcome
Welcome to the end of our times
War, your blood was spilled
Starved, decreased mankind
Plague, the final strike
Death, your emperor
Welcome, welcome, welcome
Welcome
Welcome, welcome, welcome
Welcome to the end of our timesThe Lonely Dead
Alone is to feel death crawling beneath your skin
We must remember the dead
I look down to the ground before me
Worried no longer, we were free for the first time
Now more lonely than we ever been
Around the fire we wonder; if they are alone as we are
The lonely dead lonely
Alone is to feel death crawling beneath your skin
We must remember the dead
Around the fire we wonder; if they are alone as we are
The lonely dead lonely
Dead we are the lonely dead, dead we are the lonely dead
When we speak we speak of the new age
And we realize the dead
Our lives in the ruin of change
Our first choice was to bury them
Our first choice was to bury them
Dead we are the lonely dead, dead we are the lonely dead
When we speak we speak of the new age
And we realize the dead
Our lives in the ruin of change
Dead we are the lonely dead, dead we are the lonely deadLiving just playing the game
Lust for power lies within
Killing is no longer a sin
Striving for a mentall illness
And slowly leaving reality
Lost without control
Left within you soul
Subconsciousness no turning back
Absorbed by their own needs
They cannot see where it leads
Left in an inner world of fantasy
Ending their lives as a human wreck
Playing just losing the game
Destroyed themselves with hate
Their souls will not be saved
Endless pain tormented forever
God's rage awaits for them to see
Lost without control
Left within you soulI see you now
I see you clear
I've touched your heart
I've scarred your soul
As I go dancing through your mind
Learn to dance
No way
You think you're invisible
You think you've won
You felt your heart
Skip in the middle of a beat
As I go dancing through your mind
Learn to dance
No way
You feel me deep inside your soul
As I go dancing through your mind
You know some things you shouldn't know
As I go dancing through your mind
You feel the end is coming near
As I go dancing through your mind
You're living in a constant fear
Of me just dancing through your mindBlurring the line between abortion and infanticide
D and X. the most impious form of terminating tots
Dilation and evacuation, such a problem for the doctors
By the second trimester infantile tissues are tough
Making adequate dismemberment and removal difficult
But the dilation and extraction procedure eases the grisly task
Children gruesomely murdered before they leave the womb
This full term abortion is obvious baby butchery
Tell me mother, can you feel the child kick?
Your unwanted pregnancy soon to be hacked away
Umbilical cord cut, but a tiny navel never tied
Another dead papoose for the pro-choice side
It's immortal and obvious butchery
Pulling the wee babes legs into the birth canal
Entire body delivered except for above the neck
Cervix won't dilate, the head cannot pass
Blunt surgical scissors stab the cranial base
A suction catheter is inserted into the hole
The premature brains are vacuumed out
As the tiny, soft infant skull collapses
The disgusting evacuation is now complete
Tell me mother, can you feel the child kick?
Your unwanted pregnancy soon to be hacked tied
Another dead papoose for the pro-choice side
It's immortal and obvious butchery
Infanticide legally done by detestable physicians
The Freedom of Choice Act soaked in baby's blood
Instead of adoption a massacre eventuates
Another generation of children they exterminate
Abortionist guided by an ultrasound screen
Using forceps to tear the babe from the womb
Eight months with child, now the cuntbag chooses to kill
Her offspring's brains sucked, and bodily bisected between her thighs(music by Lord of Sorrow; lyrics by Prince of Agony)
Darkness surrounds me
When I fall asleep
Silence hurts my ears
Then a wave of emptiness
Push my soul away
I fly
Free from my glove of flesh
A meadow I see
The Sky is grey
Far away to the North
Dark fingers strike the stars
A tree stands proud and tall
The desert is its fellow
Alone it watches the land
It guards the waste of (cold) sand
This lonely form of life
Is only an illusion
It hides a dark reality
It covers a great temple
I float before the gate
I read the known inscriptions
I say the Words of Power
I enter through the passage
"Long stairs descend the Abyss.
They fall in the deeps of this cold land
Where the Lord of Dreams sleeps in death
Dreaming its revenge"Its quest around the sun
Mankind on the run
Overwhelming indifference
Destruction fills my eyes
Blue and full of life
Wandering through time
Being outer space
It looks ya right in the face
The Vessel on its way
Saving the grace
Bright gentle face
A life saving case
Propulsion a mistery
Science, the missing link
But damage they cause
By inventing machinery
Inventing my greatest fear
There's so much to discover
Blaming each other tomorrow
Hurting each other today
Fading away
Denying the facts
Turning the Vessel into a wreck
Blowing prospect away
Not trying to save the day
Tomorrow fading away
Following time makes me afraidCan't take this from me.
I've gone from end to end and never looked back
I've found my one truth and ran with it
I live, I breathe. All that you gave to me
I live, I breathe. And you will never leave me
Faces turn to family. you're the reason I can breathe.
Those who stood by me, you're the reason I can breathe.
And I wouldn't change a thing
You can't take that from me
All that you gave to me can't take that from meConsumed by tongues ov fire
Burning like Phlegethon
Holy gardens reduced to ash
Extinguishing light ov hope
Bringing the end ov the days
Words ov my gospel scattered
Sacrilegious scorn spat in pale creeds
Thin is the line between pure being and pure nothing
My sole companion
Woe to Thee!
At my command,
Let the blood ov the infants flood the streets ov Bethelehem!
O ye ov little faith
With ethics rotten in a moral cage
Dead meat thrown down to the worms
To feed religious tumor
Corrupting marrow ov repugnant swirlI can't shhot something thet dosen't exist
I can't forget about what's in me
I can't vomit what i didn't eat
I can't hide from the shadow
I can't fight with a monster
'cause i don't look suicidal
I don't call the guys for help
I can't endanger them
Devour me i'm a big cheezcake
Eat until you're full
I'm an all you can eat
Bar drink me all up
I'm a pint of the brew
Devour me as i stand
Be my godzilla [2x]
Devour me As i stand
Be my Godzilla
I can't call the doctor for help
Be my godzilla
I can't hide from the monster
Be my godzilla
I can't fight with a monster
'cause i don't look suicidal
I don't call the guys for help
Devour me as i stand
Be my godzillaThis is retribution!
So come to me all you philosphers
I have a use for all your words
And as for you poets and bards
Syncophants to every scar
And as for you lovers of light
You are prisoners on all sides
And as for you humanists
I give the gift of pestilence
This is tyranny
And as for your politics
You march in circles with semantic tricks
And as for you occultists
You hide in shadows with your books
And fuck all you religious fools
Your gods your temples your fucking rules
I have no need for pessimism
I believe in nihilism!
And emperors of golden halls
You built your tomb within your walls
So blessed be the murderers
Who work like wicked conjurersEvery fuckin day I sacrifice myself
Making up for a dime the company can't afford
A professional button pusher
Craving the most valued resource we have
In a single serving
Leave dinner on the table, cause daddys comin home
Corruption ain't so bad after all
Routine self gratification
This parade has got to end
This parade has got to end
She bought a one way ticket
On a bullet train
Guess who will be waiting at the end of the line
This is just a test
This is just a test to prove you worthy
Witness the feast
As a lie here dying of starvation
Just sneak a lil taste
No one will ever notice
As I lean over the edge of this dock
I find myself wishing I knew how to swim
These waiting room walls are closing in
But the sweet smell of a rose
Helps me fight this urge
Untouched, sealed up in mint condition
A pretty pre-wrapped package waiting to be torn apart
Innocence is lost, it was overrated anyway
Let me enlighten you with my touch
Leave it on the table, cause daddys comin home
It ain't so bad after all
Routine self gratification
This parade has got to end
This parade has got to end
Let it all build up
Yeah
Like handprints on the wall
This dream has blossomed
This dream has blossomed
This dream has blossomed and wilted away
Satisfaction[music: Hauk - lyrics: Djerv]
Vi ser frem mot at isen skal brytes
Og solen n over fjellenes topp
Ja lyset skal spre seg fra bygder og byer
Og vikingehjerter skal snart tines opp
[Chorus]
, du Guds nd, bli i vrt land
Ha omsorg for hver vikingemann
All landesorg vil snart vre omme
Og frelsen arm vil fri oss fra dden
Hvert kirkebygg skal fylles p ny
Og hste inn av den kommende grdenShe met her in an ordinary bar
Having the same blue drink and smiling as she turned to her
She had this feeling that they'd met before
She felt she knew this girl and wished to know her even more
She was always on her mind always, always there
In and outside, all the time and everywhere
She was always in her head always - everywhere
Only sometimes in her bed but always there
Shalalalalalalalalalalala Shalalalalalalalalala
She seemed to stare at her and slightly smile
She was not beautiful but special so she returned her smile
The girl came over asked her for her name
She kissed her once or twice and then she disappeared again
She was always on her mind always always there
In and outside, all the time - everywhere
She was always in her head always always - everywhere
Only sometimes in her bed but always there
Shalalalalalalalalalalala ShalalalalalalalalalaA man with a promise smashes down my door
He sees a future with me, he's gonna give me more
"Give me all your trust, I'msure you won't regret
Just sign the dotted line, and I'll do so the rest"
He says I can't make it alone, not without him
But I've always been on my own, he doesn't know who I am
And now I'm starting to see just what you are to me
A parasitic leech of my life
[Pre-chorus:]
You feed off the art that I bleed
You're a man with a promise but you ain't shit to me
A man broke his promise and he wants reparations
He sold me up the river, cause me grief and frustration
I gave him all my trust and got stabbed in the back
A lucky motherfucker that he hasn't yet been whacked
You ain't no fucking artist, spend your life exploiting others
Try all you want, you can't break me or my brothers
A business man vulture,no honor, no class
Take your money and your lawyers and shove 'em up your ass
[Pre-chorus II:]
You feed off the art that I bleed
Numbers to you is just pain to me
[Chorus:]
Now the tables are turned
Can't you see motherfucker that you've been burned
You're a man with a promise but you ain't shit to me
You ain't shit to me
[Lead]
[Pre-chorus II]
[Chorus]In the shade of willows and elms
a cold wind blows and carries my tale
a tale of rebirth, a season's change
and spring will shine again
an early flower fragile and shy
a ray of sun celebrates it's bloom
the gentle colors of winter's end
this poetry lights my heart
For a thousand years to come
will the flight of dragons fill the clouds
and the shine of spring will lighten again
on the king and on his land
The leaves are dancing under the wind
the songs of birds are filling my head
a taste of heaven, a magic play
the return of better days
The last trace of snow melts away (the last trace of snow will melt away)
the dance of seasons is following it's course
the circle of life closes again
and spring prepares it's reign
For a thousand years to come
will the flight of dragons fill the clouds
and the shine of spring will lighten again
on the king and on his land
For a thousand years to come
will the flight of dragons fill the clouds
and the shine of spring will lighten again
on the king and on his land
In this silence, the storm as gone away forever now
deep in my heart, a shining spring will bloom here and explodeCreases in the depths of our existence
Without which, there can be no substance
These rifts and folds within our lives
Each day, a new disruption arrives
Our sense of will
Which path to take?
Discovering another choice to make
Now, we exercise
This given night
And what is entailed
Is taken in light
Consequences that we dealt with then
Return for us to control again
From experience, all wisdom is gained
To find sanity where, once, all things
Seemed insane
Our sense of will
Which path to take?
Discovering another choice to make
Now, we exercise
This given night
And what is entailed
Is taken in light
Consequences that we dealt with then
Return for us to control again
From experience, all wisdom is gained
To find sanity where, once, all things
Seemed insane
Our sense of will
Which path to take?
Discovering another choice to make
Now, we exercise
This given night
And what is entailed
Is taken in light
Consequences that we dealt with then
Return for us to control again
From experience, all wisdom is gained
To find sanity where, once, all things
Seemed insaneThere's two kinds, of people in the world
The outlaws, and the lawmen that prevail
The bounty hunter's job is on the wrong side of the law
Intentions, of the truth and nothing more
Burn 'em, clear the streets as he rides into the town
Cause the nameless one's gonna have some fun
He's gonna bring an outlaw down
Wasted, it's over quick he's nailed 'em three for three
Then he with his squint-eyed grin and stubbled chin
He rides through history
The jury, in his mind the choices weigh
The trials, if you're guilty you're his prey
No judgment otherwise can change the lust
That's in his eyes
The sentence, will be carried out in stride
No name, like a shadow on a moonies night
Real game, He'll be there to uphold
Justice, law and order
And you'll pay, the highest fee
When the gunslinger takes his piece
The money, it's the price you have to pay
When he calls, drop your eyes and look away
The man has taken life to balance scales of wrong and right
Existence, each day a moral fight.Death is present the candle has burned out
The scythe is raised he's eager to reap
The extreme unction prepares for the last flight
But God knows where you will rest
Dark are the veils of death
[Chorus]
To sail the seas of eternal damnation
To cross the desert of woe and despair
Or drink the chalice of divine ambrosia
Your life will be put to the test
Dark are the veils of death
Enter the great adventure
Just wait and see
Heaven or hell will call you
Now when your spirit is free
[Chorus]
Where can your salvation be
Now when your spirit is free
Where can your salvation be
Now when your spirit is free
Fading light
Disappearing light
Tells you darkness is to come
Ancient rites
The death-mass itself
Has never revealed where you will go
You will enter realms where angels fear to tread
Open hidden doors within your mind
Sail with Charon sail into destiny
Accept your death and make it to your own choice
[Repeat 4th Verse]
[Repeat 1st Verse]
[Repeat 3rd Verse]
[Chorus]Fjrrn kyrka ljuder dovt
Ut ver vida sltter
Dr en ensam vandrare gr.
Varken vlbrgad eller drng
'Friheten r hans broder,
Skogens famn hans tryggaste sng.
Under tung och grmulen sky
Vandrar tiggaren s rastlst fram.
Vandra p, du Viddernas man
Mot nya ventyr.
Vders makters hrjad hy
Vittnar om livets prvning
Och ett hjrta av renaste guld.
Fr hans gvor som skogen gav
Fr han mat och nya hosor
Innan vgen s kallar igen.So young, so beautiful. So empty.
Its a shame you had to end this way.
Your ignorance so thoughtless so dead.
You had the chance to be somebody's hero and you decided to turn and walk away.
You had the chance. you turned away.
And I won't forget your face.
Look into these eyes and tell me what you see.
Another twisted broken dream?
This is how we kill your ignorance.
So thoughtless so dead.
You had the chance to be somebody's hero and you failed.
I raise my fist to the sky, I drop to my knees I wonder if retribution is the answer motherfucker
You can burn in hell.
Burn in hellI've been thinking about
Taking the easy way out
Used, beaten, disposed, it's tempting
I've been told it's to selfish
Gotta fight to the finish
Thank you but it's not helping
Feel uncared for
Dead and empty
Getting tired of feeling so lonely
But I am going to change my tomorrow
I'll be on top of the world by tomorrow
Got the strength, I can do it
Not just saying, I'll prove it
I'll prove it
Watching my rear-view mirror
And what it is reflecting
It's an image that's broken
It is time fore a change now
How damn hard can it be?
Feel uncared for
Dead and empty
Getting tired of feeling so lonely
But I am going to change my tomorrow
I'll be on top of the world by tomorrow
Got the strength, I can do it
Not just saying, I'll prove it
I'll prove itErosion of life I see
It makes the passion burn in me
Life it always withers away
Death will eternally stay
Corpses in their coffins
Forever rest in peace?
There sleeping with the aspergillus
Is this justice to the dead?
The atrocious sight of burial ecremony
Christians weeping for the departed
They won't understand, they should envy them!
The deceased they know, if there's a paradise
Or shall we feel, the purgatory!
I open the graves, admire the rot
I can feel the presence, of something beyond
Aureola of nauseating reek
Wings of shriveled skin
Holy beauty of a carcass
Divine sight for me to gaze upon!
Necrolatic! Reverence for putrefaction
Necrolatic! reverence for the stench
I kneel, before a carrion
I pray, before the dead
I know, they shall rise
I fear, for the scourge
I revere, power of the deadI saw both sides of the war,
so lies won't cover
the sword's divide.
And you can try to cut
from all your ties and run,
but it's where you are.
It's beneath the skin,
and it's a part of you.
The faith is all to feed the noose,
but you can't hide from what's so deep
inside of you.
Oh God it feels so right
to refuse and deny your abuse.
It's all inside of you.
And you can try to run,
but it's where you are.All of you here that are secretly dead
Just a lifeless shells, consumed and bled
Oblivious season and you are blind
Follow the trend to share a single mind
You are so blind
You are so blind
You are so blind to the lie
I can see, I can see into the void of your mind
Hiding behind eyes of black
A dead man I will find
Find! Find!
Kneel to the savior who really cares less
His holy eyes fill you with fear and dread
Obey those rules from ancient history
Forgotten words that mean nothing to me
You are so blind
You are so blind
You are so blind to the lie
I can see, I can see into the void of your mind
Hiding behind eyes of black
A dead man I will find
A dead man I will find
Find! Find!Finally the purifying storm
First we die then be reborn
So flock the banner of The Return now fight and die
Many head serpent is here at our side
Wagnerian end the grand finale is here
Awash with red blood rebirth is near
Feel wind of Mayhem against your face
Bugle divine can be heard throughout space
If in the heat of battle you will have doubt
Just kill them all and let their God sort them out
The tales of this day will replace tomorrows weep
For when thou wind doth saw then storm thou shall reap
On the final day
The angel heart lies cold Under The Sign
And crimson still the frozen Blood On Ice
Drawn on walls in blood of goats the Octagon
The vagrant souls will chant the Requiem until the Twilight is long gone
Suck the leaves of otherness and lie down with the facces goddes
Eat from her rotten flesh there is no life before death
Now the sky is crimson with blood of angels
Kneel before the voice face the anger of God
Day of wrathlong ago, was it really just a woman's sin
we still don't know, did we have help to stand upright
perhaps we someone's higher expectations
evolving up from tiny snails
maybe a little gene manipulation - we don't know
[3d time - 'now we know']
faster - science is our master
applied research, breakthrough coming
prototype model on the floor
against the control group you were tested
your scores were always lower than mine before
you and i still might try
to find our past - so closely together tied
thrid generation product - hybrids incomplete
you're perfection - i can't compete
history shows, with lessons learned we still cannot win
the seed we've sown, it's come back to seal our fate
why don't they do their own procreation
it's worked well for many years
wasting our money on their simulation - when will they know
we must respect improvements on the past
science must also be tamed
make it work for us, not we for it[I.]
Kun kielln sen veren
Himosi laupean
Sen sokeudessa sieluusi vajoan
Kun kielln sen veren
Himosi laupean
Sen sokeudessa sieluusi katoan
[II.](Verse 1)
No warning, no hesitation and nothing left to prove
Divided, the strength is fading
Power you seek you use, this hatred is overwhelming
And only seems to show no mercy
The freedom's calling, bury the hatchet in vain
(Pre-chorus)
If only the chosen one had here the last time
(Chorus)
Who saw the ending before it all began?
(When the dreams were shattered)
And who went running before we took our stand?
(With your wings now severed)
(Verse 2)
Forgotten, the words have meanings
No ashes turned to stone and these questions
Will have no answers and won't leave you alone
The scarring, this damage done now
The cuts run far too deep
With vengeance and violence rising
The time has come to destroy
(Pre-chorus)
The living and dying heart has beaten for the last time
(Chorus)
Who saw the ending before it all began?
(When the dreams were shattered)
And who went running before we took our stand?
(With your wings now severed)
Never take a life worth living
The lifeblood runs black from killing
What you offer ain't worth giving
has beaten for the last time
(Chorus x 2)
Who saw the ending before it all began?
(When the dreams were shattered)
And who went running before we took our stand?
(With your wings now severed)
Never take a life worth living
What you offer ain't worth givingInstrumentalThought formed the earth as earth formed the thought -
it flew with the wind as the wind always sought the fire of
feat,
the soma of motion,
producing the sweat that set off the corrosion that made the
flesh turn into earth again.
So let the water drink you as Ophelia did -
beloved daughter and cherished sister.
Or worship the earth that Pompeii once hid,
differing not between vagrant and minister.
Take heed to the wind and its soft fingertips and fire's red
thoughts and smouldering lips.
So let the water drink you as Ophelia did -
beloved daughter and cherished sister.
Or worship the earth that Pompeii once hid,
differing not between vagrant and minister.
Sense - will you show me the way to the matter of radiant
living,
of having to shatter the fundamentals of intoxicant
thinking?
Opposing the stream , never stirring or blinking,
but firmly preserving Sisyphus' work.
The boulder rolls heavily - is it in vain?
Deducing the truth again and again.
The wind speeds up as the earth turns hard.
The mountain swells up but reaps pure disregard from
mythology,
history and all in between.
So let the water drink you as Ophelia did -
beloved daughter and cherished sister.
Or worship the earth that Pompeii once hid,
differing not between vagrant and minister.If the fire can't be put out
Let it burn, let it burn
If you haven't learned your lesson yet
You'll never learn, never learn
When it's hard to hold them down
Let em fly, let em fly
If they don't want to live
Let em die, let em die
It's not so complicated so
Just let them have their way
You see I, I always get my way
Another lucky day
If it's easier to let it go
Let it go
When the water keeps on rising
Let it flow, let it flow
Under too much presure
Then explode, just explode
If they don't want to know
They won't know, they won't know
It's not so complicated so
Just let them have their way
You see I, I always get my way
Another lucky day, lucky day
If it's cheaper to kill
Then let em die, let em die
If their tears can't be stopped
Let em cry, let em cry, cry
It's not so complicated so
Just let them have their way
You see I, I always get my way
Another lucky day, lucky dayYou walked a long way, never looked back,
so you can build a new life and start again
So far from home, so far from safety
What will you do when the world will turn its back on you?
When friendship and respect will be just an empty memory
Where will you go?
There's no place for you in this world
Burning, burning walls where you're caged in,
a sensation beyond recall
Open your eyes, come to reality
The time is now, you've nothing to lose,
throw the past away, and regain life; the life that once you've lost
Solitude your only friend in this journey
always waiting for a sign, always waiting to find the door,
search in your soul, search with perseverance
Life shows no mercy, life has no pity,
life is a dirty bastard, it rapes you and throws all your dignity away
What will you do when the world will turn its back on you?
When friendship and respect will be just an empty memory
There's no place for you in this world.
So far from you, so many miles away
Life shows no mercy, life has no pity,
you have to be strong; a heart of stone
Burning, burning walls where you're caged in,
burning, burning your brain
Don't pray to your god and believe in nothing,
be sure of yourself and you'll climb all the peaks,
oh it's just you, it's just your will power,
it depends on your consciousness,
don't waste your life
'cause this is your time to rise
This is your last chance
This is the final chance
Burning, burning buildings around you,
burning your beliefsI have fallen for you. I never got the chance to tell you 'tear these feathered wings from my back.' I couldn't hide this internal bleeding. Smiles of my filth on my dripping second. Seconds counting, I fade away with the wind to deny me freedom. Please let me go. A child bearing his final sign. Lying in sheets tainted with splattered blood of what was once me, but things aren't so beautiful anymore. Now I am death. These voices I draw are direct, seemingly undeceiving. Nothing comes out so simple. I notice I tore these wings with my own hands. Everything separating me from what is life. Entwined in messages of inexistence and missing memories dissolving like my one love, my only love. I will never feel your touch while I hear my name from your lips again. My sunrise is the darkness. I will miss you.Santa lucia comadre de los ciegos
HabÃ­a hombre que daba baÃ±os de mecos
El hueso siempre crecÃ­a
Con la vista de santa lucia
El dijo "chupa mi verga"
Ella dijo "!soy madre de pobres!"
Santa lucia se arranco los ojos
Con sus uÃ±as filosas
No quiso pito del buey
No quiso pecar
Santa lucia quiero tu ojos
Comadre de ciegosVoy caminando bajo la lluvia
Al sitio donde nac
Donde todo comenz
Busqu mis sueos sin darme cuenta
Que dorman en este lugar
Lleg el momento, era la hora
Mi sonrisa volver
Por estar d nuevo ah
Ya estoy muy cerca pero el cansancio
Una vez ms hace mella en m
Maana lo lograr
Hoy soare con tus colores mgicos
Y el arco iris guiara mis pasos
El sol ilumina tu belleza
MI corazn vuelve a latir
Y el eco envuelve mi voz
En las calles siento revivir
Mi alma
Nunca ms me marchare
Aqu he de morir
[solo Cecilio]
Muchos recuerdos que haba guardado
Luchan ahora por salir
A llenar mi vida
Y cada da cruzare el puente
Que me llevara a vivir
Tiempos d felicidad
[solo Vctor]
[voces Pacho y Cecilio]I fell in love with a blue faced girl
As I fell to my knees at the crossroads
She descended to earth in a plastic bubble
Speaking in tongues of false prophets
Ugly as sin and possessed beyond hope
We made love as we flew through the sky
Cursed to one day crash and burn
Because we fly so goddamned high
To my surprise she was a witch
From salem massachusetts
A high priestess of the occult
In the church of satan
A demon and unholy ghost
The parasite had found it's host
Inside the cold and vacant soul
Of this one and only love
Between the devil and deep blue sea
The story of us reads just like a graveside eulogy
This is a love song for a witch
A romantic remembrance for this
Is a love song for a witch
This is a love song for a witch
A romantic remembrance for this
Is a love song for a witch
Spinning crucifixes on the bedroom wall of the possessed
As words appear in blood like deep incisions on her chest
Her head gyrates and turns three hundred and sixty degrees
As poison apples in the garden fall down from the trees
Between the devil and deep blue sea
The story of us reads just like a graveside eulogy
Between the devil and deep blue sea
The story of us reads just like a graveside eulogy
This is a love song for a witch
A romantic remembrance for this
Is a love song for a witch
This is a love song for a witch
A romantic remembrance for this
Is a love song for a witchLaying down the law, listen to the hammer
Mouth of madness, watch the wicked gather
Streets of stone, underneath the grey skies
Nights come, they speak of devils in disguise
It takes people like you, to make people like me
It take people like me to make like you
Let's start a riot, another night in London
Let's start a riot, while the night is still young
Let's start a riot, another night in London
Let's start a riot, while the night is still young
While the night is still young!
Shadows of light, not a glimpse of the sun
Going 'til morning, 'til the battles won
Streets of stone, underneath the grey skies
Nights come, they speak of devils in disguise
It takes people like you, to make people like me
It take people like me to make like you
Let's start a riot, another night in London
Let's start a riot, while the night is still young
Let's start a riot, another night in London
Let's start a riot, while the night is still young
Shots fired, the sound of a new generation
No future, no revolution
For you!
For you!
For me!
No fucking revolution you!
Let's start a riot, another night in London
Let's start a riot, while the night is still young
Let's start a riot, another night in London
Let's start a riot, while the night is still young
Shots fired, fights!
While the night is still young!(Music by Matton/Tiedemann September 1995)
(Poems by Bartsch September 1995)
Ich ernannte die Elektrizitt
zum Gebein meiner Sinne
und bevor ich erregt ausspie,
ttete ich das Morgen,
um zu sehen ob es tiefer fiel
Ich wartete Jahrhunderte
und man sagte mir,
da eine Scheibe Brot berdauert
Ich nhte den Grund ein
aber konnte ihn nicht erreichen
es ist nicht das gleiche
aber wie du siehst, verschieden
Ich fand dich zuweilen heraus
um ja mehrmals von mir gesehen zu werden
Unterhalb, es ist unterhalb
das verschmutzte Abteil bentigt meine Zeit
Und ich erbrach meine Schimre
als sich das kranke Fleisch von mir abwandte
(english translation)
Diary Of A Stillborn
(Music by Matton/Tiedemann September 1995)
(Poems by Bartsch September 1995)
I named the electricity
to the bones of my senses
and before I gazed cheerfully,
I killed tomorrow,
to see if it fell deeper
I waited for centuries
and I was told,
that a slice of bread survives
I sewed in the ground
but could not reach it
it is not the same
but as you can see, different
Sometimes I figured you out
only to be seen by me several times
Below, it is below
the soiled compartment needs my time
And I vomitted my chimera
as sick flesh turned away from meHallelujah
Hallelujah was recorded by Freya in summer 1999 for the soundtrack to the Danish film Max and was released as a single in November 1999. This single contains two versions of the song. Take 1 has all 5 verses. Take 2 has verse 1, 2 and 5. On the FALL 2000 TOUR, Freya performed the song live singing verses 1, 2, 3 and 5. Only verses 1 and 2 is taken from the original Cohen song released on Various Positions in February 1984. Rest of the verses are taken from later versions of the song made by Cohen. Copyright by Leonard Cohen, 1984.
I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
(Well,) It goes like this: the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, (and) the major lift
T the baffled king composing Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Well, your faith was strong but you needed proof.
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you.
She tied you to (a) her kitchen chair
Well, she broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Baby, I've been here before.
(I know) I've seen this room. And I've walked this floor.
(You know) I used to live alone before I knew you.
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch,
But love is not a victory march,
I it's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Well, There was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do you?
(I) But remember when I moved in you,
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
(Now) Well maybe there's a God above
But all I ever learned from love
(Is) was how to shoot (someone) somebody who outdrew you.
And it's (no complaint) not a cry that you hear tonight,
And it's not somebody who's seen the light -
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah,Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah,Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah,Hallelujah
Below you'll find the complete Chasing My Tales Lyrics. There are slightly differences in the lyrics printed in the album booklet compared to the lyrics actually sung by Freya on the cd. The original lyrics are shown in grey and where the differences occur you'll find the printed text in brackets in orange and the lyrics actually sung in blue.I was away for a while
But I'm hoping someday you'll forgive me
Though I don't deserve it
I'll cherish it well if you give me one of your new starts
Just one more last chance
I swear that I'll earn it
If you front me for now
I'm good for it I swear
I'm better now I swear
In earlier days, they'd persecute people
They'd carry them off, and hobble their legs
For lesser offenses, and how I have harmed you
And still you allow me to walk free of pain
Though I punish myself
I will never settle
The debts I've incured for scorning the face
Of absolute beauty, and measureless grace
And though I once mocked you
I'm dying to pay for it now
I'm dying to pay for it now
So hand me the rocks to help weigh me down
And tether my legs with a cord tightly bound
To the end of an anchor thrown into the sound
And test me to see if I will rise against the worst that it can get
I wasn't well for a while
I savored the things that I knew were sure to destroy me
And that seemed to hold me
That seemed to carry me where I couldn't go
On the strength of my own
Well, I should've known
That gets me nowhere
I've learned that now I swear
In earlier days, they'd persecute people
They'd carry them off, and hobble their legs
For lesser offenses, and how I have harmed you
And still you allow me to walk free of pain
Though I punish myself
I will never settle
The debts I've incured for scorning the face
Of absolute beauty, and measureless grace
And though I once mocked you
I'm dying to pay for it now
I'm dying to pay for it now, now, now
So hand me the rocks to help weigh me down
And tether my legs with a cord tightly bound
To then end of an anchor thrown into the sound
And test me to see if I will rise against the worst that it can get
Well, I wasn't sure that I could
Well, I wasn't sure that I could
Well, I wasn't sure that I could
But, I canIn which the way is mind and mind is way.
And off they went - both of them -
The charm of luck fell in his hand -
Or shall I say into his face...?
Or shall I say to you...?
This sudden moves his mind allowed -
Walked distance to his fading past
Left space for thoughts so mountain-high.
Left space for thoughts to you.
Where shall we fly my timeless pal?
So strong in harmony we stand.
The river Styx or Hades cannot hurt
the sparkling sprouts of the living days.
Shall find the rose's blooming hills
To pick the chosen one so bright
And water it in the endless wells
Of what I found so deep inside.
His steps stayed steady as he frowned
uncertainty felt on his face
No one could see behind his mask.
No one could see behind.
Help me half dead ghoules for long
You've pierced me in my timeless days
I've payed you with my blood and pain
I demand: Take me as one of yours.Twisted bodies
Untenable pain
I commemorate today
My reprisal day
I enshrine
Stench of rotting heaven
Nest of wickedness
Burning wings of angels
Fizgig nailing thousands hands
I drag holy gates
Grip of coldness
Paralyze servants
Refugees from escaping
Desolation
Genocide generation
In aftermath of kingdom
More kindness, godness
More evil, more hell
The black rainbow
Wandering of black sky
Nothing remained
When I took revenge
It is the hay day of
Genocide generationConquerors, yes we are conquerors
By the spirit of our Father
With the power of our Saviour
Your victory on Calvary
Set me free, and I will follow You
In Your name I will set people free
I will strike down on evil with the power of my Saviour
(Rev 19:11from the Bible spoken)
Your victory on Calvary
Set me free, and I will follow You
Conquerors, yes we are conquerors
By the spirit of our Father
With the power of our SaviourI'm not your gateway
I'm not your prodigal son
I am the vile lesser-than
Just who do you think I am?
I'm not your standard
I'm not your vision divine
I am no sacrificial lamb
Just who do you think I am?
I am death
I am death
I am death
I am death
I'm not your sacrifice
I'm not your shelter in the storm
I am determinately man
Just who do you think I am?
I'm not your child
I'm not your paragon of just
I am by other means damned
Just who do you think I am?
I am death
I am death
I am death
I am death
Who do you think I am?
Who do you think I am?
Who do you think I am?
Who do you think I am?The sky is leaving grey tears
And endless cries are falling
So let themeselves in dying
And so this useless feather
Blank mother of useless poetry
Leaded by this old and tired heart
Dividing my pain, from the
Hopes of soul
And now unscreamed voice
Behind the walls of silence
Decay to my surrender
Lost in my days
Into my eyes ...
Rain deceiving myself
Going back to
That scene of autumn ...
Fragile Caress
Scenes of an autumn ...
Let her come back again
But while this empty feather
Goes on to write on mourning
The time is gonna turning
Lost in my days
Into my eyes ... leaves
Deceiving myself
Flying back to
That scene of autumn ...
Fragile Caress
Scenes of autumn ...
Let her come back again
From my calm
I can hear your call ... why,
So dull his voice by the leaves
You will feel my touch ...
A Fragile Caress
Inside me the autumn falls
The patient ground now
Receives and now I wish to die
With you ...
The ground, the tears
The sheet, the tale ...
Raining to me, the rain ...
Nothing, nothing
Flying she has gone, now,
Forever ...
Now I see the fall around
The rain is falling from above
Patient ground now receives
It doesen't wet my silent life
Now I want to die with you
It finally wets my silent death
Now I want to die with you
Turn back to
That scene of autumn ...
Fragile Caress
Scenes of autumn ...
Let her come back again
Scenes of an autumn.I'm so tired day after day,
I pretend I'm awake
I've been losing sleep
Balancing in between,
dream and this cold world
Helplessly trying to keep
Little bit of my sanity
sand's running out of my hourglass
Quietly I start to wait the burning hate
And now I hear it calling my name
[Pre-Chorus]
Through the darkness and pouring rain
I fight my battles all alone
Descending blackness the source of my pain
Once again my fears start to rise
[Chorus]
Walls of stone
Between shadows and my dark desiress
Walls of stone
Keep this pain inside my mind
Faceless friends of mine
In this space and time
Couldn't read my warning sign
Push me over the edge it's too late to beg
'cos now it's too far gone
[Pre-Chorus]
Through the darkness and pouring rain
I fight my battles all alone
Descending blackness the source of my pain
Once again my fears start to rise
[Chorus]
Walls of stone
Between shadows and my dark desiress
Walls of stone
Keep this pain inside my mind
No life to live
I always stayed alone...
Save Us...
It's judgement day
I don't have to wait anymore
I am the silent one.
[Chorus]I'm an outcast on the path of rebound
Everything is frail, I desolate, crush, and burn
I have chosen darkness to be my guide
War is in my heart, death is by my side
[Chorus]
War heart! With no remains of compassion or love
War heart! Hate your fellow as yourself
I have chosen night to be my guide
When the daylight strikes, I hide in my trench and die
[Chorus]From blood-drenched earth
The mighty oak arises
From its roots
Flow rivers of death
Shadowed bodiless forms
The rotting cores of the damned
Drifting - howling to blackened skies
On rushing waters of time
Enter the misty depths
Of the underworld
Where blizzards rage
Through fiery storm
Where magic reigns
The waking dawn
Where ram and serpent
Stand guard
Waiting to taunt the souls
Of those who spent lifetimes
Worshipping lies of a false truth
In vain - they sought return
Protesting their fate
They knew not
The course of the wind
Through which region it roared
On which place it diedWhite gold, a morning came
Sunny cold, reflecting light
Unknown songs
Fresh water gush licks the lime
Sprinkling crowns of silence
The face wet from the moistened dew
Wind takes the sight
Around the meadow
Playing kindly
Silver dropped wine
That flows inside
a sleeping hand...
Desperation fills the air
(In your heart lies the dust of the anger)
Madness knocking on my back
(Chiming bells have announced the new day)
My courage lies someplace
where time forgot to send me
(now where are you going?)
(now where are you going now?)
Someday they'll mark your sins
like torture on your back
I wonder why
My mind is tight
Like stormy weather
And so it seems
That little steps
would take forever
Oh, never understand...
We're like mad horses
heading for the bend
This place I'm standing here
Made it on my own
Moored my life to never let it go...
I wonder why

We're like mad horses

All my life I'll be the way
I won't forget
All my life is never understandHillary
Where's the sixty quid you borrowed off me
for the gas? I will give you a kiss
Hillary
Hey Hillary
'New Faces' on Saturday at six
Brought you back to me
Hillary
I'm sure it was you in the new Audi
Outside Sainsbury's
Hillary
Remember when you needed three caps of speed
To get out of bed
And now you're on ecstasy
Hillary
With your daft African pop
And that wine you call bull's blood
Hillary
I thank the lord that you still don't live next to me
HillaryFire... Damage, who decides what is right
Crowded by all that is lost, it's hard to find positives
Taken by blunt ignorance I give you no forgiveness
Don't try to block out all the memories, it's the pain that binds us
All to this cause we unite to burn the cancer
Fire... Damage, who decides what is right
Battle rages day to day, fought by our sons and daughters
All support is fading, it raises speculation
It's not just one man, but a fungus that is slowly closing in on the world
smothering all of existance
Fire... Damage, who decides what is right
Who decides what is right
Fear is fuel for cowards, throw a match into the fuel
Don't think that all is lost, read between the burning towers
This hit should make us strong, aggravated by their treachery
No end in sight, blinding, wish I could see the future
Day in day out questioning, what is tommorrow bringing
Though we are whithered and beaten we cannot be broken
Fear of your pride, misery is soon upon us
Fire... Damage, who decides what is right
Who decides what is right
Fear is fuel for cowards, throw a match into the fuel
Don't think that all is lost, read between the burning towers
This hit should make us strong, aggravated by what it's coming to
What is it coming to, every time you turn the page you can see our world is a disaster
Rage rears its' ugly head in so many different ways
So deafening, our world is a disaster
Lost on a globe of disregard, clinging onto hope
We need to find... what really matters.I never said that I was a fucking poet
I never tried to be something, I knew I'd never be
There's no use in pretending, no use in pretending
I'll tell you one thing so listen closely, go
I'll tell you one thing so listen closely
When I tell you this is straight
From the bottom of my broken heart
So please, save the excuses
For someone who wants to hear them
You're not here, that's all that matters
I'm just afraid that I will
Never feel this way again
You're not here, that's all that matters
The lies, the deceit, will I ever say enough is enough
Or will I continue to let you walk all over me
The lies, the deceit, will I ever say enough is enough
Or will I continue to let you walk all over me
I am done, pistol please
I can't take this anymore, pistol please
I am done, pistol pleaseSuffocation, suffocate with
With no room, room to breath, to breath
Forgive us for now is too late
This is not an American dream
This is no longer an American dream
This is no longer an American dream
We are trying to breathe
We are trying to breathe underwater
Trying to breathe underwater
The few, the proud, no longer sing their song
One nation under God, it's us against the world
One nation under God, it's us against the world
It's us against the world, us against the world
It's us against the world, us against the world
We've cut the tongue from society
Forcing consumption, never hearing no
We've brainwashed our children to believe this is destiny
Spoiled rotten, still counting their 1, 2, 3
We've brainwashed our children to believe this is destiny
Spoiled rotten, still counting their 1, 2, 3
Forgive us for now is too late
Forgive us for fueling the flame
This is not an American dream any longer
As we've become spoiled, rotten, counting your 1, 2, 3
Disease infesting our young
Beauty has become the beast
Beauty has become the beast
Now beauty has become the beast
Beauty has become the beastNow I'm close but still so far away
this place in my mind I can't seam to find
the depression will be my fall, my fall back to it all
now I'm there again trapped in this hole full of shit
the depression will be my fall, my fall back to it allVi Trenger Ikke Bruke Krefter

As I lay and wait to die
Little do they know that
I hear their choice of life
End it now, it is the only way
Too cruel, that is what they say
Release me from this lonely world
There is no hope
Pull the plug
Let me pass away
Pull the plug
Don't want to live this way
Once I had full control of my life
I now behold a machine decides my fate
End it now it's all too late
What has now been days, it seems like years
To stay like this is what I fear
Life ends so fast
So take your chance and make it last
End it now, it is the only way
Too cruel, that is what they say
Release me from this lonely world
There is no hope, why don't you
Pull the plug
Let me pass away
Pull the plug
Don't want to live this wayEvery image that I strive to show you fades away,
Though it leaves me dead inside, just an empty husk,
Like a contour on a map to our own demise,
Cataracts on the mind's eye, leaves me blind but...
Hallowed thoughts and golden visions burning through my brain,
Every moment of your life like ashes in the wind.
Time takes its toll while the words turn stagnant and the pattern shifts,
Out of place leaving embers where a flame once burned bright.
Tear down these dead walls,
It's my salvation.
Tear down these dead walls,
My inspiration.
Sift through the wreckage one last time with my fingertips,
A lack of answers keeps me primed, words start whispering.
Another consolation like a taste of benediction, but it's not enough.
Another indication of my mind's elimination, grasp at straws but...
Hallowed thoughts and golden visions burning through my brain,
Every moment of your life like ashes in the wind.
Time takes its toll while the words turn stagnant and the pattern shifts,
Out of place leaving embers where a flame once burned bright.
Tear down these dead walls,
It's my salvation.
Tear down these dead walls,
My inspiration.
Lost inside this maze with no way out,
Stare at these dead walls.
Weathering the storm and then the drought,
Scream at these dead walls.Ride...

The opiate of masses
But I've learned so much more
Attend lectures and classes
Through verbal dissections
Ideas are in suspension
We clash like criminals
In bed with loss prevention
We move when they say
And beg for shit that we
Will never ever need
So keep the receipt
We've become the children
Of paralyzed ambition
A fraction less human
Dining in modern kitchens
Prepackaged warmth with a
Touch of your personal flair
Arrested emotion
Wax poets with a cold stare
We move when they say
And beg for shit that we
Will never ever need
So keep the receipt
Don't you try to tell me that your life feels empty
Don't you try to tell me that your life feels empty
Don't you try to tell me that your life feels empty
...[Your illusions of eternity descending]After the smoke clears
And the flames subside
(we have been forsaken)
Subside
A thousand eyes were upon me
Soulless, and without mind
(we have been forsaken)
Will there never
Will there never
Will there never be an end
If I could be forgiven
Every breath would be a prayer
(we are not forgiven)
Will there never
Will there never
Will there never be an end
I have tread, and spanned the horizon
I've seen this world, the beauty in decay
I strike down the faceless and unknown
I feel blessed, for I can see
The stars look down on me
Stars look down on me
Stars look down on me
Stars look down on me
Will there never
Will there never
Will there never be an end
Will there never be an end
Will there never be an end
Will there never be an end
Stars look down on me
Stars look down on me
Stars look down on me
Stars look down on meSome say a storm is coming,
Some say the end is near,
Some think it's all so hazy,
I think it's all so clear.
If it all ends tomorrow,
If it all disappears,
Where do you think you're going?
Anywhere else but here!
I don't claim to have the reasons!
All I know is, if the world stops spinning tomorrow,
I'd never shed a tear!
I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere,
Anywhere but here!
Some say they have the answers,
Some say they know the truth,
Some people live in question,
Some people have no clue.
If there was no tomorrow,
If there was just today,
Would you make different choices?
Or would you stay the same?
I don't claim to have the reasons!
All I know is, if the world stops spinning tomorrow,
I'd never shed a tear!
I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere,
Anywhere but here!
If there was no tomorrow,
If there was no tomorrow,
If there was no tomorrow,
Would you stay, the same?!
If there's no tomorrow,
If there's no tomorrow,
If there's no tomorrow,
Would you stay, the same?!
If the world stops spinning tomorrow,
I'd never shed a tear!
I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere,
Anywhere but here!
If the world stops spinning tomorrow,

Rising from the smoke
Entheogenic god
Dwelt in inbetweeness
In quadriga sexualis
Thou art mysttery unveiled
On the sun we fed
Worshiiped spirit in matter descended
Through the mists ov the highest mountains led
Out ov darkness ov ignorance
Into the light ov reality
Touch and say:
"This is the flesh and blood ov mine"
Look: Atmospheric "I":
Blessed be who have seen
Fools in the slime
Their world shrills with fear
Kali Yuga: shells ov gliphoth manifest
Decline! Decline!
Beyond the dead words
Going across the gnostic waste
Drifting in infinite experience
From Nowhere to Nowhere
In the dreams ov eld heard we atavistic chant:
Zos Kia Cultus: Nagual-Hoor-Lam
Certainty, not faith
Instinct - desire - and will!
Naught in all, all in naught
Touch and say:
"This is the flesh and blood ov mine"
Look: Atmospheric "I":
Blessed be who have seen
By the Fire and Force
I command thee, spirits ov the deep
Thoughts - theriomorphic shades
Creep and obey me!
Demons - perfected dissolution
"In non - atomic fact ov universality"
This is my sweet solitudeCleanse thine eyes, let truth appear
The world is deceived, judgment is near
Mankind is fallen, believed the lies
Confused and have not seen the evil in his eyes
Ravished they are by the beauty of this form
Enslaved and can not see the chaos of the storm
Root of all evil has grabbed the human race
Saying: "I don't care for others, I am God myself"
Millions in suffering, billions of tears
This world is secured for how many years?
Mist of the Spiritual Dimension
Satan has cursed thy mind
Awake, abandon mortal sin
Truth thou shall find
Dwell in the light of the Saviour
Bathe in the Blood of the Lamb
Sword of Thy mouth shall beat the evil flesh
Evil destroyed by Thy return in brightness
Total annihilation, damnation fell to dust
War of Armageddon, obliteration is a must
King of kings, the earth tremble for Thy might
Thy coming seen by every eye our most awaited sight
No one shall stand at that day, we will be on our knees
Eternal kingdom comes without hatred or decease
The dawning of forever, darkness is no more
By the holy blood of Jesus, we won the final war!Clandestinely Exhumed After Midnight
A Cryptic Autopsy Is Being Performed
The Corpse Is Lied On The Gravestone
Semi-Decomposed And Deformed
Inexpert Hand Starts A Deep Insection
Avulsing The Bowels Full Of Maggots
The Digestive Tract Is Sliced In Sections
Pus Flows From His Open Wounds
Torso Is Mangled, Eyes Are Removed
Gangrened Cavities, Brutally Bursted
Carved Abdomen, Cut In Two
A Repulsive Odour Infects The Air
And Gases Arise From The Effervescing Entrails
Cadaveric Substances Embalm His Flesh
It Has Been Fermenting For Years Of Decay
The Stench Of The Carcass Doesn't Nauseate Him
('Cause) Being A Good Pathologist Is His Dream
Organ By Organ, Meticulously Extirpated
How He Studied
Member By Member, Extremities Are Displaced
Sawed And Hacked
The Corpse Is Now Fully Dismembered
His Guts Extended All Over The Grave
Severed Limbs Piled Up In The Casket
The Ground Strewn With Bits Of Flesh
The "Class" Has Ended Before Daybreak
And He Goes Away Without A Trace
All Rests Are Now Entombed Again
And The Corpse Rests...No Love. No Peace.
Spend your days, counting sheep.
When you're dead you're done, you're dead you die.
But life goes on.
No love, no lies.
Wasting your days. Waiting to die.
No one would mind if you never woke up again. Goodbye my friend.
No hopes. No dreams. Breaking away from reality.
Today is the day you see the consequence.
May you never wake up again.
I will long even if they're all Dead
I will bring the dead to life.
When they put a price on your head. Say goodbye to your wonderful life.
I have seen the lying face of god. I have seen the edge of the earth.
We have already lived to fucking long.
may we regret our birth.
I was born a monster. I will die the same.
No one can live forever. I will become a household name.
No love, no lies.
Wasting your days. Waiting to die.
No one would mind if you never woke up again. Goodbye my friend.
No hopes. No dreams. Breaking away from reality.
Today is the day you see the consequence.
May you never wake up again.
We will choke the ones we love.
Your admiration means nothing to us.
When push comes to fucking shove.
We never do what's expected of us.
We all wanna be a part of something. But I see you want none of this.
We live our lives, afraid to die, But these dreams are selfish.
I hate everything you love.
I hate everything you love.
I hate everything you love.
I hate everything you love.
No love, no lies.
Wasting your days. Waiting to die.
No one would mind if you never woke up again. Goodbye my friend.
No hopes. No dreams. Breaking away from reality.
Today is the day you see the consequence.
May you never wake up again.When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
Till I get to the bottom and I see you again.
Do, don't you want me to love you
I'm coming down fast but I'm miles above you
Tell me, tell me, tell me, come on tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer.
Helter skelter, helter skelter
Helter skelter.
Will you, won't you want me to make you
I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer.
Look out
Helter skelter, helter skelter
Helter skelter.
Look out 'cause here she comes.
When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
Till I get to the bottom and I see you again.
Well do you, don't you want me to love you
I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer.
Look out
Helter skelter, helter skelter
Helter skelter.
Look out helter skelter
She's coming down fast.
Yes she is.
Yes she is
(I've got blisters on my fingers)I'm trapped under the weight of what is not
Tortured by what can't be changed
Never feel the way that I feel
Just a step away
But there's a million miles of distance
Just thought when I awake in my mind
When I walk alone I can see her when I close my eyes
Just to have her haunt my dreams
I am crushed under the weight of what's not returnedWhy? What have they done?
Who has the culprit crossed and forced in another year?
Why have some gone, but we are still here?
Sitting in a circle of clouds. Enforced.
Upon my head. Above my eager eyes.
Misplaced. My mind abandoned. Seized to substance.
Abused in months of excess. Heat flashes of memory.
Breathing in good health. To stop the nightly excess.
Pounding on the walls of the temple. Beside the cross.
Bury me in the bay. Tempt me with throated swords no longer.
Oh, I am weary. I am tired. Tired of leaping.
Collections of caskets. I am lurking death.
AN ANIMAL. A curse to myself.
Harms way for those I cherish.
Done. Forced in light.
Versed, as the child, on and on.
I am home.
I am home.[Singer]- Take your time young thug.
Verse one
PYT, poor young thug, ?
To hit a nigga wit a slug, wormin' around town

ChorusEnd your life
Are there reasons to go on?
Pain won't hurt
'Cause you know you'll soon be gone
Relatives will mourn
'Cause of the loss of one beloved
In time they'll forget
And you'll be gone into the past, die
Blood flows on
Your mind is feeling free
Dying isn't hard
It's happening easily
Why should life
Only be ended by the God?
Decision is up to you
End it or not
Has mankind lost its sanity?
Trying to reach for immortality
The fear for dying is hidden deep
No faith in their eternal sleep, eternal sleep
I was born alive
Isn't that punishment enough?Too many slaves in this world
One by torture and pain
Too many people do not see
They're killing themselves, going insane
Too many people do not know
Bondage in over the human race
They believe slaves always lose
And this fear keeps them down
Watch the damned (God bless ya)
They're gonna break their chance
You can't stop them (God bless ya)
They're coming to get you and then
You'll get your balls to the wall, man
Balls to the wall
You'll get your balls to the wall, man
Balls to the wall, balls to the wall
You may screw their brains
You may sacrifice them, too
You may mortify their flesh
You may rape them all
One day the tortured stand up
And revolt against the evil
They make you drink you blood
And tear yourself to pieces
You better watch the damned (God bless ya)
They're gonna break their chance
You can't stop them (God bless ya)
They're coming to get you and then
You'll get your balls to the wall, man
Balls to the wall
You'll get your balls to the wall, man
Balls to the wall, balls to the wall
Come on man, let's stand up all over the world
Let's plug a bomb in everyone's arse
If they don't keep us alive, we're gonna fight for the right
Build a wall with the bodies of the dead, and you're saved
Make the world scared, come on, show me the sign of victory
Sign of victory, sign of victory
You better watch the damned (God bless ya)
They're gonna break their chance
You can't stop them (God bless ya)
They're coming to get you and then
You'll get your balls to the wall, man
Balls to the wall
You'll get your balls to the wall, man
Balls to the wallDreams
Sometimes reality, sometimes illusions
They can come to you straight from the darkness
The evil is trying to get your soul. Dreams. Dreams
In my dreams
In my fantasy
I can see
All the things that will be
Rescue me
From my fantasy
In my dreams, in my dreams, in my dreams
Dreams come in my mind like a hurricane
Nine minutes from thirty in the boogyman
I wake up in the middle of the night
My body sweats, I twist from side to side
I can't stand, I can't stand the feeling
Praying to God and I hope that I'm dreaming
My hands are bleeding, heads are bleeding
Lookin' to my mom and she starts screaming
What's going on, I can't stand the feeling
Turn my heads and I see my face in the ceiling
Each and every night, different faces
I'm the man in my dream in different places
Yes I'm lost and scared of the illusion
My mind is full, full of confusion
My body hurts, I twist from side to side
I wake up in the middle of the night
Dreams. They went into my soul
They give you plseasure till you I lose control
I can't sleep 'cause I got fear fear
I got fear of the things that I hear
Who's gonna be the one who helps from myself
I need somebody, I need help
My body's flyins, body's flyin
Just be a friend and I and I
Rescue me, rescue me. Oh come on rescue me
I'm on a road, on a road to nowhere
I'm on a roll, alone, where's my teddy bear
I can see you tonight 'cause I got fear
Somebody's screamin' loud and clear
I get shot and twist from side to side
I wake up in the middle of the nightRat fink asshole, sellin' us out
Mummification, callin' you out
No one's bailin' you out
Corpse disposal been a long time comin'
Let the games begin[Instrumental]To tired to figure it out my head is spinning
My heart is so drained right now I think I'm slipping
On my last nerve
I'll get what I deserve
I need this I want this
I'm so obsessed
Pleasure in pain
I feel whole again
I break the seal with my hand my blood starts pumping
Screams ring out so loud right now so deafening
On my last nerve
I'll get what I deserve
I need this I want this
I'm so obsessed
Pleasure in pain
I feel whole again
You'll never forget my facetry and hold me back
you fail every time
no chains can restrain
level barriers one by one
only one way to go
thats up above the rest
breath through every wall
iron will
i wont give up
never again give in to you
cant make me turn away
ill never look away
this goes beyond desire
driven by my goals
too determined to be defeated
steadfast on solid ground
anchored heart
try and hold me back
you fail every time
no chains can restrain
level barriers one by one
i wont give up
never give in to you
cant make me turn away
ill never look away
this goes beyond desire
driven by my goals
too determined to be defeated
steadfast on solid ground
anchored heart
iron will
too determined to be defeated
anchored heart
steadfast on solid ground
I wont give up
never give in to you
cant make me turn away
ill never look away
this goes beyond desire
driven by my goals
too determined to be defeated
steadfast on solid groundWe are to be something here again
We are to play soldiers now, pretend
We are born inside these endless halls of shame
We are jaded by the error-ways of man
It doesn't make us strong
It doesn't make us strong
The things that i find stranger here
Will not let us in
Will not let us in
Show me, i won't tell
And even if i go today
I won't understand
Understand
We are to be something we are not
We are to repeat our faults my friend
We are taken down from sanity's lonely heights
We are shown the downward spiral ways of man
It doesn't make us strong
It doesn't make us strong
The things that i find stranger here
Will not let us in
No, they will not let us in
Show me, i won't tell
'cause even if i die today
I won't understand
UnderstandIt cannot be seen
But there's blood on the green
Only god knows I'm innocent
Take me, take me home
A dark seed reigns in me
Like the storm rules over the sea
I challenge thee, do not cross this bridge alone
Don't dare me now
The threatening shadows will pass by
There're getting closer now
Open your eyes
Wake up my dear young friend
And hate shall fade away
I will not move, yet
I'll stand still, instead
There on the battlefield he stands
Down on the battlefield he's lost
And on the battlefield it ends
War and anger shall reign
The clash of iron can be heard
By blindness you're driven insane
I'm lost in anguish and grief
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die
A shattered body deeply hurt
And darkness will cover the light
It's gone forevermore
The field's been left in sorrow
The father and the son
They're gone
The sun shines bright
And anger rises
Lorn and lonely
Torn apart
Don't you think
It's time to stop now
We were charmed and fooled by the old serpent's kiss
Let's pray
That heaven is on our side
Through violence and horror
Shall honour arise
So let's pray
And blessed shall be our leader
We follow the noble and bright
Don't you hear me crying
Crying
Come take me away
I hallow thy name
There on the battlefield he stands
Down on the battlefield he's lost
And on the battlefield it ends
War and anger shall reign
The clash of iron can be heard
By blindness you're driven insane
I'm lost in anguish and grief
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die
A shattered body deeply hurt
And darkness will cover the light
It's gone forevermore
That's what minstrel sing
Join in the horrible screams
Take part in murderous deeds
renowned be the lion-hearted
Join in the minstrelsy
Wailing in endless grief
It eagerly longs for more
Broken bodies lay down on the ground
Blood sheds all over the place
The green will be stained forever
And hate reigns all over the field
They keep struggling on in anger
Fiercely intense
Outrageous, too blind to see
And in pain they keep on singing
We claim the land for the highlord
God bless the land and our highlord
War and anger shall reign
The clash of iron can be heard
By blindness you're driven insane
I'm lost in anguish and grief
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die
A shattered body deeply hurt
And darkness will cover the light
It's gone forevermorethere's a new dawn coming
coming down in flames
there's a new thought burning
and it's fire can't be tamed
an illusion shattered
cuts its way inside
reduced to nothing
you're doomed within your lie
come on in
this nightmare's just for you so feel no shame
it's all yours for you to breath - for you to live
there is no present but the past
your creation - watch it burn
there's a new seed growing
growing in their minds
there's new hate breeding
a dagger from behind
now the new word echoes
a word set in stone
did anyone cry when sympathy died alone?
second coming
yet its all the same
the lies are ruling
masters of the game
forever fallen
puppet on a string
born the loser
soon the bells of death will ring[Verse 1:]
Visions of your love...
Drew me closer, I couldn't get enough
The presence of your hate...
Gave me the dreams, in which I relate
[Chorus:]
You got the right to make up your mind
You're livin' your own free will
But if you start to mess with my head
I'll go in after to kill
[Verse 2:]
Said that you loved me!
Obviously lying - it's easy
That's all I can take
For you now, your life is at stake
[Chorus 2:]
You got the right to make up your mind
You're livin' your own free will
But if you start to mess with my head
I'll go in for the killNamida ni wa kankoku na uso ga

Hate this shit
Hate your words, hate your ways
Hate my words

I fucking hate myself

Just know how to
Hate, down my spine
Hate, raging wounds
Stuck in my soul
All I know is
Hate is in control
Name it

Fake it
Hate!
Hate to lose
Hate your days
Throw away
I fucking hate myself
I fucking hate you MORE.
Just know how to
Hate, down my spine
Hate, raging wounds
Stuck in my soul
All I know is
Hate is in controlSaw you coming around my bend
Cutting teeth and breaking bread
Making moves and smearing friends
Your karma has been racking debts
Left your throne in foreclosed homes
Claimed that crown of decay
Built castle walls with blood and bone
To shield your soul from wither and decay
Worms will feed
Saw you slither around their necks
Sinking teeth into their flesh
Spitting venom seeing red
You will fall where you lay your head
Rats will feast
The worms will find a way
The rats will find a wayStay awake to decide
Are you coming back?
Is this my sanity?
I can't forgive
Oh is it the same to me?
I can't take your place
I'll never see you, never flee from me
Severed
Lost lies in the house I bring
I can't fucking see
I can never pull your self from me
I can't focus
Libertine my "said to be"
I will never save you
Wait, today is not the same
Severed[testimony of the dying]
I, who walk disguised among,
I, who have watched death a thousand times
I, who perform the murderous art,
King of kings, lord of pain
The tempter of eternal life,
The beholder of the evil eye
Prince of death,
The true servant of the dying kind
I, an angel of death
From the dark abyss
Rejected from heaven
Condemned to a realm
More evil than ever imagined
A realm of pain and suffering
Never known to living man
You will bleed forever again
I, who lurk in the darkest shadows
I leave no life behind
I, who dwell in your deepest fear
Write this in human blood
My last words to mankind
Follow my way
Crush the living hypocrite
And those who speak of death
With pleasure and no desire
Let us gather to create what once were
What could have been
For this is the task and quest
To those who succeed
The gates will open to the realm of death
And we will welcome you as a brother
Together we will rule the throne of death
To those who fail
We will reach out from the darkest of hell
And with viscious intent rip your soul apart...Withering time, so elusive, so shapeless
Graceful coil, crumbling glory, it will revive
Exalt the endless chain
Exalt the withering times
Time decides what lives or dies
Time can crawl and time can fly
It can wither and erase
It can make a new beginning
There is nothing time can't beat
There is nothing time will need
To destroy and bloom again
A vicious circle older than the earth
Decay, destroy to reform again
Withering time
Withering time, so elusive, so shapeless
Graceful coil, crumbling glory, it will revive
Exalt the endless chain
Exalt the withering times
Broken windows, blistering paint
Lashing winds, hot suns and rain
Wood has splintered, walls are cracked
The elements are just as vicious
All what men have made won't last
In the future as in the past
But our memories are strong
And will outlive all circles of time
Time, transcend beyond all life, transcend beyond
On until the end of time, on and on
Live before we waste our time, before we run out
Broken, blistering, lashing, splintering
Cracking, crawling, flying, withering time
Withering time, so elusive, so shapeless
Graceful coil, crumbling glory, it will revive
Withering time, so elusive, so shapeless
Graceful coil, crumbling glory, it will revive
Exalt the endless chain
Exalt the withering timesGlobal downfall by the grace of fear.
Fucked up system, glorious victory.
Global downfall, rotten to the core.
Rumbling units down.
Global downfall - grasps all, lose all.
Body count rising, cavernous liberty.
Global downfall, rotten to the core.
Rumbling units down.
Crawling like a snake to hunt them down.
Claimed is the aim to raise the sense of justice.
Claimed is the right to rule the weak.
Atrocity, brutality, horrifying, rotten to the core!
Roar is filling a tensed field of wiping snakes.
Containment seems not to be an option.
Dead Rubbed off skin.
Decomposing - sin.
Shaped in sand, in taking seduction.
Tricky in disguise - prepared for taking life.
Could you turn away, aware of the deadly peril.
Strangulation on a prospectless struggle of your life.
Providence is always on the side of the strongest battalions.
When they give full rein to their lustful greedy illness.
Why not taking, why not weeping, for the sake of our pride.
Wiped out mind, wiped out soul, wiped out fear, wipe out life.
The need of taking more.
Global downfall by the grace of fear.
Fucked up system, glorious victory.
Global downfall, rotten to the core.
Rumbling units down.
Global downfall - grasps all, lose all.
Body count rising, cavernous liberty.
Global downfall, rotten to the core.
Rumbling units down.
Cunning, stunning, rotten to the core!1.The Arrival Of Eternity
2.End My Pain
Time has taken it's toll
Years passed by like a storm
Cold, burning inside, I'm not the same
I've changed my ways
Dawn hunting my dreams
Fear, silent I scream
Pain growing inside, I'm not the same
I've found my way
Nothing is the same anymore
The times have changed, I feel so cold
Hate is ripping my guts
Light is blinding my eyes
Fools, spare me your lies, my ears are deaf
My mind is black
God - where is your god?
Pain - there's my god
Death - come for me now, end my pain
Show me the way
Everytime, everywhere
Everdawn, everfear
Nothing more, nothing less
All is done, all is saidRunning thorugh and endless maze
trapped in a barren land
blind and doomed to disappear
never to be seen again
Nothing left as an epitaph
silent our final scream
too proud to beg,too strong to die
oblivion is our destiny
Of glorious dreams
of great warriors
just ruins remain
we felt the pain
we spilled our blood
wounds that time can't heal
We challenge fate
we won't surrender
against the circle of time
like children stranded in a
lonely place
the seed of revenge are sown
[chorus]
And though we know well
never be free
the season is here
our time has come
our wings of steel will rip the sky
and time will stand still
as we take
the freedom flight
He who shall not loose his faith
he will pass through the
wall of fire
forever to be reborn
too late to be stopped
The rusty chains that kept
us bound
are now fallen to the ground
free at last strong again
free to spread our wings and fly
Strong against the winds of hate
in a blaze of glory we fly
we'll succed where the mighty
has fallen
oh Gods guide our hands
The tomb is empty
triumph is calling
destiny has failed
we'll reach the sun in a rush
of power
we will never come back
[chorus]I gave you life in times when all our colours bled
Cherished hopes and dreams of the life that we never led
And now its too late
Time to release you, safe and sound
Time to conceal all of your scars
Forgive and forget we'll live to regret it all and now we know
This was not meant to last
You gave me time I thought was already mine
Spoke of what was wrong
I should have seen all of your signs
And now its too lateI saw the world die a little today,
just to feel the wealth of decay,
just so you can know what it feels like,
what the tears taste like
We owe it all to the sickness inside,
we owe it all to the fears we've learned to hide,
we belong where traitors can touch the divine,
where the unforgiven can send us a sign
Was it the symptom,
or was it the sickness,
or was it one last try,
our only weakness,
falling face first,
tears stinging down your cheek,
drowning face first,
a haven for the wretched the cursed
Only the lonely[Words: W. Sssenbeck / Music: Bhm, Pichlbauer, Koritar]
THEIR CHILDREN ENDURETH THROUGHOUT
THE AGES YE SHANTAKS OF LENG
ARE THE WORK OF THEIR HANDS
THEY HAVE FATHERED THE NA-HAG
AND THE GAUNTS THAT RIDE THE NIGHT
GREAT CHTULU IS THEIR BROTHER
UPON HIGH PLACES THE TEMPLES
OF THOSE WHOM NATURE OWNS NOT
THEIR BLASPHEMIES WERE GREAT UPON THE EARTH
ALL CREATIONS BOWED BENEATH THEIR MIGHT
AND KNEW THEM FOR THEIR WICKEDNESS
THE ELDER LORDS OPENED THEIR EYES
THE DOLES DO HOMMAGE UNTO THEM
THEIR PRAISES BENEATH
THE PEAKS OF ANCIENT THROKS
THEY HAVE WALKED AMIDST THE STARS
IN THEIR WRATH THEYSET THEIR
HAND AGAINST THE OLD ONES
SLAYING THEM IN THE MIDST OF
THEIR INIQUITY AND CASTING
THEIR BLASPHEMIES WERE GREAT UPON THE EARTH
ALL CREATIONS BOWED BENEATH THEIR MIGHT
AND KNEW THEM FOR THEIR WICKEDNESS
THE ELDER LORDS OPENED THEIR EYES
LOATHSOME CHTULHU ROSE THEN
FROM THE DEEPS AND RAGED
WITH EXCEEDING GREAT FURY
AGAINST THE EARTH
THEY BOUND HIS VENOMOUS CLAWS
WITH POTENT SPELLS
SEALED HIM UP WITHIN THE CITY OF R`HLEY
THEIR BLASPHEMIES WERE GREAT UPON THE EARTH
ALL CREATIONS BOWED BENEATH THEIR MIGHT
AND KNEW THEM FOR THEIR WICKEDNESS
THE ELDER LORDS OPENED THEIR EYESHow do we get out from all they put out?
The feelings are let out, and we give our best out
When envy comes put on, all you do is look on
You can't put your shoes on; convenience is pulling you down...
How do we get out of this filthy bed I've made?
It's long and it's overdue, no matter what I've said
And suddenly, it comes to me; through all the pain and the misery:
All I ever wanted was you here with me...
I'm not the only victim of stubborn, foolish pride
I'm not the only one who has something bad to hide
And suddenly, it comes to me, through all the lies and the misery:
All I ever wanted was you here with me...
The suddenly, I realize all I ever, ever needed was you here with me, you here with me...
I'm not the only victim of stubborn, foolish pride
I'm not the only one who has something bad to hide
How do we get out? (repeat)Subconciuos desolation of your mind.
Enter the church of life.
Decieved by the almighty.
Obeying the book of lies.
Goes money to those who suffer,
or to God for all his help?
The preachers words of wisdom,
cleanse their souls of sin.
They his holy checkbook,
the saviour will heal from within.
Liar, stealing money from the weak.
Deciever, the checkbook is your holy bible.
God in heaven, speak to me.
But you will hear no words.
Complete silence surrounds you now.
But still you hear Him speak.
Trust the cross, believe in lies.
A crime of the mind.
Brainwashed, mindcontrolled.
They seek for their Lord above.
But they will never find.
Because the church has made them blind.
Escaping reality, lost for eternity.
Preacher, your healing is just a fake.
Believer, you're decepted by the cross.
... the cross...Dusk, Embrace me, Enter the kingdom of light
Night, Surround me, Cover the sky with your might
Thunder, Caress me, Slap my face with delight
Storm, Revocate me, As I scream in your eye
As I scream in your eye, Revocate me
Come, Join me, Enter the remains of night
Lust and Pain, Taste the devils vine
Thunder, Caress me, Slap my face with delight
Storm, Revocate me, As I scream in your eye
When you call upon me
With a voice of sorrow and tears
I'll be there to guide you
Through the dusk of nightfallCon mi corazn a ultranza,
por cristiano bautismo,
es que abarco a la patria
con un yo soy mismo.
Me lleg desde ultratumba,
ms all de la muerte,
la pasin desangrada, mentora y simiente.
Poco importa el destino de aquella generacin
que no hinche la labor de sus antepasados.
Desde que hay memoria, ya hay tradicin,
y desde que esta existe,
ya hay patriotismo, y de esto nacionalidad.
El pretrito obliga.
Escarmienta ilumina y envalentona.
Menospreciarlo no constituye profanacin,
sino intento de suicidio.I knew you some years before
Deep in prayer under bough
Futile sighs in vital skin
Your flesh caressed by night
Yet change came quickly
A bruise in the air, it staggered within
Sweet sickly rot
Black wound infection
King, slave, child
Your fates are united
An unending row to the grave
A single dance now, all eyes are shut
Blind to the earthly
Begging now to forget who I am
Emperor, your sword is useless
Shattered crowns so swiftly
Fragile as the scythe
Aching bones cling to swollen limbs
Despair floods all senses
The world is dying around me
Gaping in mirth, his old eyes spoke
Where you are now - I once was
And what I am now - you soon will be
Nothingness awaits you
Begging now to regain what I've lost
The tale of life is but a picture
A flash in an abyss, a dream in the void
See that there is no meaning,
Understand eternal death
You long now to try what you once feared
But the time is gone and dust will be your legacyQue agusto viviendo la vida - Coca

Trucos! Tranzas! La TraiciÃ³n!!One more time, just one too many times,
is all it had to take, now they can't resist the world's too full,
its time to bring it back, and turn this shit around,
the last rebellion, we're gonna take, the rich and hang them up,
so fucking high, justified genocide, raised in green,
they swallow up our lives,
a carnivore feast hard-core traumatized
They promise but they never fucking give,
this world, tied down, gang raped, disgraced,
corporation nations start the game,
persist, exploit, rip-off, defame,
put one against the other till their dead, beat them,
face down, make them, eat shit,
burn the fucking global village down,
riot
The government's in flames, the corpses pile high,
on the white house lawn, dead, another million dead,
lets execute and kill
Justified with force-fed freedom
walls of propaganda, a system built on lies,
crushing insurrection, the masses will uprise,
we procreate... our over-dominating force
is crushing all within its way, watch the world,
it burns, class war, now its our turn,
I just let their fucking shit it burns so high it wastes away,
now we have, the means, total war, we are redeemed
Armageddon calling, its time to fucking kill,
destroy the false world order, and crush the status quo
The pressure, it's leaving, I'm wasting their fucking lives
lawyers, and preachers, they're the first sacrificed,
pawns of, the system, perpetuate misery,
corrupted, they're creating a fucking de-mockery
Masses of the world all bow it, blind and full of shit,
UN, IMF, they're all the same, nations are enslaved
If they just let it suffer, we got to turn them over,
this is the precendent for killing the nation-state,
a lack of total vision, its social amputation,
they're locked inside a world apart from reality.We starve our children before the banquet of knowledge while politicians indulge in the feasts of war.religion taking over my soul
deeds that fill the void
only a substitute
to make my conscience numb
what you don't know will hurt you
self cleansing works
that make it excusable to sin
you'll get it
going with the flow
cattle thoughtlessly led to the slaughter
this is what you say
of the man who died for you
opiate for the masses
that's what you say
your progenitor lives a little south of here
my boss is a carpenter that hung on a tree[we have evidence of a superior culture out there]
[they come from ...god knows where]
[maybe from outer space]
[maybe from some other dimension of existence...]
All the battles that I've fought and lost
When I'm asleep they come
All the screams that I've screamed unheard
A week wounded soul
[they've been manipulating my life since I was a little boy]
[And they never asked permission]
[they never once asked]
[you know what the hardest part is]
[the isolation the ridicule the self doubt]
[half the time you are wondering if you are going crazy]
Dare I open my eyes and see
How much more can they possibly harm me
The frustration
The hurt
The fear
Of a week wounded soul
[for years I've worked real hard]
[suppressing all abduction memories]
[now that I remember]
[I'm scared to death almost all the time]
[I know they'll be coming for me again]
[they always come back]
They're watching me
They're touching me
Moving so quick they're all around me
Ain't got the right
But say they do
The Shocking Truth
A week wounded soul
A deeply wounded soul
[They are abducting our citizens on a regular basis]
[conducting experiments on them]
[collecting specimens about ova]
[they have been impregnating women]
[and then later invading those women's bodies again]
[and steeling the unborn foetuses]
[for reasons we can only imagine]Sitting here staring at my blood-covered hands
Thinking of nothing but what I've seen
So I went out again, tried to forget for an instant
Grabbed my victim, my work was about to begin
Why me? What did I do wrong? I've seen
I now fight the voice inside of me that wants me to do it again
Know that I must stop but it's a senseless trial
'Cause at the end it will overcome and I'll lose
And I'm out there again - why? 'Cause I've seen....Down instead of up, back instead of forward,
faster and faster, begging to stop.
Stop the madness.
Slipping backwards, losing your life,
the whole fucking world, to its knees by this virus.
Could you stop yourself before?
Before this has gone too far.
This has gone too far.
Stop the madness.Little miss J likes to fuck
Like in a painting
Destroying fine art
Little miss J isn't quite like
Other girls at all
Little miss J puts her soul
Inside a letter
Destroying fine art
She is hurting herself so bad
Destroying, destroy
Picture-perfect
Picture black
Little miss J
Can I come in and play?
Cut my skin
Make me perfect
Paint me red
Another dark day
Can you help me, miss J?
Cut my skin
Make me perfect
Paint me red
Little miss J has a certain
Taste for chaos
Destroying fine art
Little miss J always tends
To find a way to fall
Little miss J cannot take
The shit she's given
Destroying fine art
She is fading away so fast
Destroying, destroy
Picture-perfect
Picture black
Little miss J
Can I come in and play?
Cut my skin
Make me perfect
Paint me red
Another dark day
Can you help me miss J?
Cut my skin
Make me perfect
Paint me red
Running out of colors
Running out of light
I run
I run
Running out of time
Running out of here
Running out of sight
Running out of fear
I run
I run as fast as I can[words & music by Thomas C. Hansen]
Tonight I'm standing all alone
My heart is cold as a stone
You start to cry, when I tell you why
I have to go away, but I will be back some day
There's someone whispering in my ear
They tell me dying time is near
Don't be afraid we will show you the way
There's no other place you can go
Just close your eyes, and we'll go
Open the gate, let us in
And we'll fight until we win
Cause surrender is not the thing we do
We will stand side by side
Till there's no more place's to hide
You must fall to your knees and look above
Watch the sky
The stars can tell you where you are
They seem so close but still so far
Just watch the sky
One last time before you die
Cause you will never see it againWhatever is going around ?
See the deal in your mind !
Sweat burning, sweat burning !
You pray ! We have forced the bravest kind !
Sleep well ! We'll all see the paradise !
Sleep well ! Sleep well !!!
Summerbirth ! Summerdeath !
Soare death ! Soare death !!!
Sweet dreams, sleep with me ........
No, No, No, .... !
Suffer inside, you can't heal.
Suffering right ?
This is the end !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is the end !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is.................the end...............the end!!A paralyzed mind embracing decay
Dead like carrion just wasting away
There is nothing
Numbed by excess and complete saturation
Scarred influence by degeneration
There is nothing
There is nothing to believe
All has been lost
All have lost their way
Every eye has been disgraced
Dead like carrion
We must carry on
There is nothing
Lost innocence and blank revelations
Searching for a hope in static transmissions
There is nothing
There is nothing to believe
All has been lost
All have lost their way
Every eye has been disgraced
There is no reason for empty vision
All has been lost
All have lost their way
All has been lost
All have lost their way
Every eye has been disgraced
There's no reason for empty visionLose yourself and the ones you love
Throwing stones at the bones.
setting fire to homes
Lose yourself and the ones you love
Throwing stones at the bones, don't end up alone
Terrified, at the thought of losing myself again
years of doubt and hate have led me to flee to your gaze
I'm prepared to lose it all
and as the skies turn pale, blood pours upon me
Bring your wrath
Let it wash over me
I just want to let go
Your venom flows through me
The worst is yet to come
Like a parasite you digging into my soul
Spirit filled these lungs, make me whole
Released from the prison of my doubt, a worn mind is opened to a truth it can't live without
I was never prepared to lose it all

carries the musk of the elken rut:
An ammonia stench, thick with lust,
the scent of battle, death and conquest.
A lone pair of antlers crests above the harem,
thirty cows drinking at a Logan Pass creek.
The bull elk spots shifting light between the trees,
another young challenger to his throne.
From the wood, a bugled shriek
The females freeze, lift their heads and stare.
A rival bursts from the brush
and charges for the leader of the pack.
Skulls collide
Punctured hide
Beaten pride
Nature's guide is war.
Fight to the death.
Panting and stumbling
Resolve is crumbling
Bloodlines: their wager
Their lives in danger
One
final
charge
to end it all!
Elk clash, the young buck
Swifter, his horn stuck
through his elder's eye.
Antlers like lances
entwined, he dances
with the cadaver of his enemy.I've played this scene in my head so many times that I could tell you your line.
You're so perfect in your imperfections
And so delicate in your motion.
And I see fear in your eyes
The secret to beauty is a scalpel
And Charm's in a bottle
That can be shattered in a moment your fear will last forever
As the wind blows through your hair
I'll tightly grasp onto your neck,
My breath to the beat of your pulse
I promise these cuts won't scar
This scarlet blood won't stain your pretty white dress but
You'd look so cute in red
Slashing Razorblades and love notes can touch my heart in so many ways
Don't be scared of my bloody outfit it stains with grace
Take my hand trust my smile
Close your lips shut your eyes
And scream
So
Let my warmth rekindle your latern so you can burn through the night you'll burn so bright[Instrumental]Time between the seconds, time I always see
When I reach the promised land, I'll be free
How did I end up here?
A maze, a trap, or the end of the line?
Lost in time, don't even know the year
From where do they appear, within this wicked mind of mine
Situation dire, the level of the challenge I admire
It's time to die, but instead I live and fly
Mind paralyzed nerves traumatized
A plan to destroy me, they snapped
Soul demoralized death revolutionized
An hour is a day, filling time with dismay
Cornered and trapped
They say it's harmless, wont harm a fly
Give it your best shot or else you die
An epidemic on humanity, total insanity
Reigning terror on every child, all the while Satan smiled
Chaos, amidst the youth of our time,
Wipe out the future, say it's no crime
Where does it all end, if there is such a thing?
Wonders of paranoia it will surely bring!Ossuary for the misinformed
You´d end up being amazed
At what you´d see inside
The whisps of knowledge denied
And to think that someone´s implied
It´s a better place to reside
Take that voice of unreason
Asked that question
About the chaos
That lies dormant within
Have pondered through a pond
Of useless information
Fooled, tricked
But I´m slowly coming around
Fell for it once, never again
Ignorance is bliss
For the miner of fools gold
Can´t teach a dog, that´s too old
The motherfucker´ll take a bite of the poison
Indoctrinate unfiltered lore
Teaching
Learning
Absolutely nothing
Intravenously force fed
A slave state of intelligence
Meant to break these bonds at some point
Howsabout now
The bottom line
I´ve saved you the time
Wasted on a lost cause
No longerThe healing nails sting my bleeding heart
Takes my breath away
Tear myself apart
The little girl in my bed has a gun to my head
Looks into my eyes
And says she want me dead!
You know that sleep comes with drugs,
and I'll drink my fears away
I'm not a boyscout
I'm a lunatic
Lunatic,
The bitch is dead!
Lunatic,
The bitch is dead!
The fat lady sings tonight
That voice disgust me
I'm not a boyscout
I'm a lunaticNo sigas los pasos de san asesino
Vivimos en un siglo cruel, el 21
Mundo sacrificado, planeta de basuras
Importante es que despierten
Importante es que tu escapes
El alma es libre aunque te apresen
La polÃ­tica de fe te convierte en una marioneta
Violencia en nombre de la paz, violencia en nombre de la vida
Santos guerrilleros asesinos del amor
Hoy el abuso del querer es natural al ver
Como maltratan la razon para no detener sus
ArtimaÃ±as son tan necias que al mirar
No ven como derrumban tus ideas para no librar
No sigan los pasos de san asesino
No soy san asesinoBeloved mother
There is no guilt
In what I have done
It's far too late
To turn it back
To turn it back
Slowly they move
One by one
Food for the clan
Your kingdom will come
Slowly they're marching
One by one
Follow my magic tune
It is so easy
Her eyes
Her pale cold eyes
Are watching over me
I've never felt alone
All the children
For her glory
A fair price and
The deal was fixed
I did my part
And they betrayed
I cleared their problem well
But I trusted lies
All your children went astray
Pay the price for ignorance
Praise and glory to the clan
Watch your step I'll bring the end
Rats repeat their feast
Queen will be quite pleased
All your children went astray
Pay the price for ignorance
Praise the glorious race of rats
One by one they'll join their dance
Hungry souls they shall be fed
Praise the wisdom of the rats
All the children went astray
Pay the price for ignorance
Now you know fear
Face the unknown
Dwell in tears
The story's told
You may have learned
Dare not to betray
The whistler
You should consider
You might fail
You should consider
You might fail
All your children went astray
Pay the price for ignorance
Praise the glorious race of rats
One by one they'll
Join their dance
All your children went astray
Pay the price for ignorance
All your children went astray
Pay the price for ignorance
Food for the clan
Praise to the rats(Pain has a face allow me to show it to you...)

Var sjel er lenket,
Vart hat er blodig.
All glede er svunnet,
All latter er forsvunnet,
Alt liv skal ende I dod.
I et kalt og ode landskap,
Skal den sorte horde tre frem,
Var herre skal stige
Opp for all tid, reise sitt rike igjen.
Var kamp skal belonnes,
Vare nav skal prises,
Vare sinn skal dra den grene,
Og hans kjÃ¦re Ã¦rlighet skal evig ga tapt.
All moral skal forkastes,
Du vil men du dor av skam.[musick - Matt Harvey, Derrel Houdashelt; lyrixxx - Matt Harvey, 1992]
Gnawing the stools, I masticate with fervor, Enthusiastically I ingest the
discharge of your gaping anus, Anal disgorgement of steaming bits of meat...
Each smelly mouthful I devour, Your rectum is now going sour... I divulge
the latent feast of your colon, As my drill gouges an avenue of
ano-obliteration... Steaming fecal morsels expelled, Chunks of watery
bloodied stool, Your salivating sphincter is throbbing, As I begin to
heartily drool... Shredded chunks of your buttocks, Your gaping anus is
ground and mulched, As you are made to excrete your innards, Your pulsating
sphincter emits a septic belch... Sanguineous anal discharge... Loosened
bowel segments, Your colon hemorraghing in fecal fistula, This disemboweling
enema, Turns your anus inside-out...Feeling anxiety. Lost reality. Things I can't believe.
Things I've seen. Wrapped in a dream. Are not
relieved. Persecuted all my life for lies I haven't
done. A fugitive on the run. What did I do wrong?
Searching for evidence to clear my name. Piecing
together the truth day by day. Closing in fast. Got to
move. I cannot stop. My frustrations are burning
inside. The expressions I can no longer hide. A
challenging quest for freedom must not waste anymore
time. The past and present is my future. All
accusations are false. Father, I pray for my sake.
Help me before I'm caught. Intentionally accused.
Intentionally accused. Living in total secrecy.
Changing my name constantly. Hiding my images in
disguises. Going from city to city. Within nobody's
reaches. A total stranger in the crowd. It's up to me
to be free. Can't go on living this way. Intentionally
accused. Intentionally accused.Mellifluous lily white
The gift that's yours my breath of life
Just like the night needs the daylight to survive
You are the strength of my mind
And gladden my heart
With an aura so mighty
All summer's beauty is gone
And leaves are falling of the trees
My thoughts are just 'bout this grievous memories
Wand'ring in light-hearted times
When you captured my soul
With an aura so mighty
Fears creeping - If your foe is as mighty as time is
This soulitude - Pain I can't deny
Eyes weeping - When you still can remember the first kiss
Hours passing by - Night blackens the sky
A dull black fills my mind
As deep red trickles melting snow
But if my kisses couldn't hold you, oh I know
My tears can not at all
My suff'ring and crying goes on
But it can not at allLet me vomit on your face,
Let me vomit on your breasts.
Let me vomit in your lips,
Let me vomit in your pussy.
Vomited bile lies in the lips,
Rebellious tissue strikes with hate.
Jawbone excretes yellow liquid,
Let me uncork your full ovarys.There never was a night like this
How could there ever be?
Through sweat and velvet misery
The fever race in me
Cornered in a symmetrical design
Sphere like chrome on a sea enraged hatred
What the mirror sees is the clutching at straws
Taking us under
The storm of the ocean, this velvety crush
Ring corners, firm in the outrage
Synaptic patterns, waves contort
Break into these cellular walls
Why?
Globes of disease, infest my dreams
And burning the ends of my veins
Pattern and form, the squares cling fast
Well dance the tide now
Could never bare another night
Although I know it'll come
The freezing ends of what is me
The icy rages free
Cornered in a symmetrical design
Sphere like chrome on a sea enraged hatred
Take hold of the boundaries, the Perimeter Sea
Burn, enflame the oppressors
But if four was one in a corner alone
Recovering, licking the wounds
Delirium coming, the weakness kicks in
Resigning, cornered withinSoul arose that morning like a sunwheel at the sky...
Shallow land two ravens high above gave me the sign...
Walhall the hall of shining shields
where once I'll be to celebrate my death...
farewell my sword may lead me into ancient realms...
"...now saddled is my horse and grinded my sword,
the wisest of all blacksmith's forged my shield...
Tomorrow I will ride, when morning sun arose,
to meet my fate on shadow field...
...now the time to leave is near,
and all preparations done,
the twilight now heralds my farewell...
A last donation to the ones
who will guide me on my way
and who will await me if I'll die..."
Valkyrjur will take my hand to lead me on my way...
Himinbjorg so soon there Heimdall will welcome my soul...
Walhall the hall of shining shields
where once I'll be to celebrate my death...The life you led had you in chains
Losing the touch
There's no controlling your mind
Forever grieving in your heart
The mysteries you hide contribute in losing the battle
[Bridge]
I see, clearer when you're drowning in your words
Forced to, betray, you're delusional in thought
[Chorus]
I see the light
To guide my way through the darker shadow
Why can't you try?
Give me strength to live
in colliding worlds
Reciting all the answers
Avoided the trust
Your negative views are revealing
Falling emotions now unfold
You're fading through lies
Entwined are you now
by the web that you're weaving
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Solo]
This fatalistic dream has gone
Vanished away
This image that you once created
Inspired by new beginnings
Moving through life on wings that are giving me freedom
[Bridge]
[Chorus]A horned man, a blazing helmet
With a cooper and brassy shine
In reflections of rays in the moonlight
He danced faster and faster
Blaze of Embelishments and arms
Pride and Solitude - grief and Delight
Crying dark is all what's left
In an astray silver light
His cloak waved around
wings, as he was a Raven
... the horned man ...
And then a scream came out
A cry unbounded, a cry so wild
Like a calling of a Bird
But different - too long and Deep
He ran the forest in Night
Through ancient crowns of trees
And the forest has been filled
With his laughs and Dance(master p chorus)
Feel my pain, feel my pain
This ghetto got me goin through some thangs
God feel my pain. (x4)
(fiend talking)
There comes a time, where uhhh, you have things of yourself, when you
Lose someone, how you gonna take that feelin away? I got sons of funk,
An me fiend, an my people, master p an silkk
They ready to tell you how I feel, trapped, everyday life.
Verse 1- (fiend)
Everytime I open my eyes, I thank God for wakin this soldier,
'cause in this cruel world it's hard to walk these streets bein sober,
It hurts, tryin to get over all the weight on my shoulders,
Mom used to be babysitters buyin boulders,
It's all on me to really except that I lost my brother,
An to be stong an juss to go on since we shared the same mother,
Pillows an covers can't smother the pain that I have,
Sometimes I feel like I lost my better half, so sad,
But that's the way of the ghetto,
See yo life is already made, it's an accomplishment to pass "a" grade,
See they hate my city, givin us the pushers an tramps for our highs,
Sellin they book of food stamps at night,
I light the porch lamp, until my lil cousin came in,
'cause I can't afford to lose another gender life,
But livin this bend you could lose it if it came today,
It rained away, you be wonderin how to take the pain away.
(chorus-sons of funk)
Tell me what we gonna do? the world ain't the same man,
The way we live is a shame, I can't hide this pain. (x2)
(master p chorus x4)
Verse 2-(master p)
Ughhh! lord the world ain't the same, from the cradel to the grave,
Dear mama keep yo head up I'm tryin ta get paid,
These ghetto tears got me out there wantin to scream,
My auntie 35, but bumpin 17 off a dope fiend,
I live my whole life to stack some chips,
An it's a shame when yo own homie, sank yo ship,
An mama cryin......'cause church's be packed,
An all yo family an friends dressed in black,
An it's a shame, to see homies leave this earth,
Some say ball, til you fall, now it's ashes an dirt,
Sometimes, I feel like I'm trapped between heaven an hell,
In the ghetto's ? ? ? tory, wit fiends an crack cells.
(chorus x2)
(master p chorus x4)
Verse 3-(silkk the shocker)
You might catch me, walkin wit my head down,
In the pourin rain,
Tryin to find answers to questions, no one can seem to explain,
I coulda been born son of a king,
Instead I was born son of a, killa, surrounded by dealaz an fiends,
Dear God I got some questions, that maybe you can answer,
Why my brother got shot, an my grandmother died of cancer,
Now through it all I tried to ball an keep it real,
They say they don't feel what I feel,
I guess 'cause they don't live where I live,
See my mom tried to be strong, my brother died
Didn't wanna see her cry,
But I seen her through the face of the mirror
Wipin tears from her eyes,
An my next door neighbor committed suicide, was it 'cause of stress,
An if it was, was it that bad that he had to choose death?
(chorus until song ends)
(master p chorus x4)
(fiend talking)
Sittin here tryin to take the pain away, see this one here
This for all my ghetto fiends out there
Fightin these street wars, to all my no limit soldiers
To everybody in the penitentary, I feel yo pain
This ain't nuthin like bein free, tryin to take the pain away
Rest in peace
Kevin bailey, kevin miller. tryin to take the pain away, fiendinjected venom sucking the life from us away for eighty days it's white

He's the king of fire
He was fearless and strong
Always standing tall
He will make you crawl
You can not deny it
He is still the mastermind
His demise, a misery for his community
He battled, thru the land and paid his dues
Kill to live!
He was forged by fire
Kill to live!
Trooper, your brave and genius
Spirit never dies
Enemies will fall
Blood upon the floor
Burning on the pyre
No quarter taken this day
Tearing down the wall
The carnage will sprawl
You can't crusade
He'll destroy mankind
His demise, a misery for his community
He battled, thru the land and paid his dues
Kill to live!
He was forged by fire
Kill to live!
Trooper, your brave and genius
Spirit never diesDenial, no function, loveless, no meaning
Fearless, system, suffering on, existence Meaning, distorting , shapeless, feeling
Fearless, system, suffering on, existence Why am I, such a void
[repeat]The machines are raping the machines
The cum drips down the legs of humanity
Slip slide, don't fall
Stabilize, won't crawl
Under muck spittle soil
Within the serpent's coil
Within the serpent's coil
Blindfolded by your own fucking will
Dive into the shit
And swim for a while
Peel the crust from all over your body
And scrape the blood
From your putrid fucking hands
Tragic mourning for chain release
Uncovered plots of lies and deceit
Venomous fangs facade
Vice like tightening
Wrapped up
Smothering
Annihilate
The nihilist
Positioned to strike
Sleek slithering
Skulking
Strangulated fear
Choke-hold weakens
Cancer spreading
Paralyzing
Detested, sickened minions
Burrow to safety
March with the storm
Whisper supremacy
Conquer the throne of allegiance
In this age of sadism
Dominate until we expose you
Expose you
We've exposed you
For all the sheep to see
Revolt, shepherds have lost grace
Revolt, serpentile raceArriba con los brazos - vamos - Amokk

Arriba con los brazos - vamos - AmokkWe won't stop.
We don't even know how to stop.
Ya see, with positive minds,
We create positive vibes,
And with those positive vibes,
We create positive lives.
So if there's somethin' that ya want,
Ya know ya gotta get it.
Don't ever forget it
'cause someday ya will regret it.
So keep on pushin' for 'em
'cause your dreams are ya dreams,
And no matter how it seems,
There will always be the means
To get what ya want,
Yo, and where ya going to
Now. What ya gonna do?
I'm a leave that up to you.
[Bridge:]
We gotta keep it goin' on now,
Take it to the top now,
Never gonna stop
Even if we start to drop now.
Here we go again why'all,
Can you get this flow,
Never want to go slow so...
[Chorus:]
How d' ya feel, do ya want to feel alright?
Here's the deal, we've got pure delight.
Alright, it's alright.
Wake you up in to the morning light,
Shake you up before you sleep at night.
Alright,
(You want to feel alright)
It's alright.
(We got pure delight)
They say I'm greedy, but I still want more.
What you don't need to know,
I keep behind closed doors,
'cause, everything I buy can't be sold,
And everything I touch turns to gold,
You see, because I'm better than the next man.
I shine above all those who try to put me down
And pass it to the next man.
Who's the best man for keeping it tight?
Next time it comes around make sure you do it right.
[Repeat Bridge]
[Reapet Chorus Until Fade]Kiss my sunbeam
Feel my heartbeat
There's no life in me alone
When I don't see you
I can feel you
I just want you to atone
Hit the starlight
Meet the sunfight
Drive in to your fantasy
I'm just shining
I'm just bleeding
Do you hear me cry I'm alone
What did I do
I give it all to you my love
You can leave me now
What did I do
I gave it back I know I can't
Live without you now
Kiss my sunbeam
Feel my heartbeat
There's no life in me alone
When I don't see you
I can feel you
I just want you to atonePlease me or bless me
I'm full of your lack
depress me and press me
to give me your slack
weed of your decease
anger of your bliss
Crown all your world
cell you gave me to live
wiil be my jail
my reason to fell
that hate you love to breed
will be your decrease
Crash me or slash me
I'll fix to your dreams
depress me and press me
I'll feel what you'll give
found lieing on the floor
the day you realesed your fear.[bonus track]We come from
Over the dark horizon sky
With twisted tales of sacrifice
To imagine or believe all the glory of the free
Hunting all day an endless cry
The things I've seen I can't deny
Sinners, saints all mixed in one
The dawn of time has begun
Why can't you see what they're doing to me
Is it fair that I'm dying in vain
Once in a land of sacrifice now only valleys of demise
Shadows of a pale blue moonlight ride the waves of entity
Why can't you see what they're doing to thee
Is it fair that you all die in vain
Ride with the steel and the power of the sword
Stand up and fight now and forever more
Rise through the night sky with daylight's desire
To be free there must be black fire
Through the day and through the night with dragons heart the warrior strikes
This is the day that they'll be known as my enemy
Why can't you see what they're doing
To what we believe in we rise through the pain
Ride with the steel and the power of the sword
Stand up and fight now and forever more
Rise through the night sky with daylight's desire
To be free there must be black fire
We come from distant lands we travel so far
Can you see the bleeding scar
The prizes of life we fail to win
'Cause we doubt the power within
Why can't you see what they're doing to
What we believe in we rise through the pain
Ride with the steel and the power of the sword
Stand up and fight now and forever more
Rise through the night sky with daylight's desire
To be free there must be black fire
Black fireNo regrets
You caused me so much pain
I can still feel the wounds you left on my tortured skin
I won't forget your chainsaw and the games you played
Come on, little angel, will you play my game?
I'm full of hate and this hate is eternal
Are you sure you want this fight?
I fight with all my heart
There is no time to pray, no time to cry
I fight with all my hate
There's nowhere to run, no place to hide
You kept me in this dark hole, it was like living hell
With my open wounds that never healed
You gave me my own blood, you took it from my heart
But now I'm free again and I'll come for you
And now is the time to strike back
It will be hard and painful, no mercy anymore
There is no more forgiveness
I fight with all my hate
There's nowhere to run, no place to hideI burn for you
I can't breath without you
You forgive because you love
I fall for you
I can no longer stand up without you
You understand because you love
What is the sun without your light
What is a picture without your face
I have cursed life
I have tried to live alone
But I can't
Without you I can't be free
Without you I can't be endlessly high
Without you I am alone
Without you I can't fly
Without you I can't endlessly love
Without you I cannot be
I awake for you
I can't feel anything without you
You liberate you forgive
I drown in you
I feel your heart beat deep in me
You understand because you loveI have the power to bend time and space
I stare into you but you don't see my face
Sacrifice the father
Scold the one who sins
Paralyze the daughter
And steal the seed within...
He who gives life everlasting
He keeps your soul in his hands
Cyber-Christ - Pray for me
Cyber-Christ - Die for me
Cyber-Christ - On your knees
Cyber-Christ - Bleed for me
I am the savior, I'm the one you fear
My resurrection...The end of time is near
Sacrifice the father
Scold the one who sins
Paralyze the daughter
And steal the seed within
He who gives life everlasting
He keeps your soul in his hands
He who gives life everlasting
He keeps your soul in his hands
Cyber-Christ - Pray for me
Cyber-Christ - Die for me
Cyber-Christ - On your knees
Cyber-Christ - Bleed for me
He who gives life everlasting
He keeps your soul in his hands
He who gives life everlasting
He keeps your soul in his hands
Cyber-Christ - Pray for me
Cyber-Christ - Die for me
Cyber-Christ - On your knees
Cyber-Christ - Bleed for me
Cyber-Christ - Pray for me
Cyber-Christ - Die for me
Cyber-Christ - On your knees
Cyber-Christ - Bleed for me[Instrumental]look at you shake...
I see it on your face...
why are you so afraid...?
looking down from above for much too long
on the masses you're here to serve
established as such but never as much as
the voice of the people's word
decisions of war and who needs thinking for
it's a kiss-up to the 1% and dismissal of the poor
you don't even live by the laws you give
and your welcome here is wearing thin
our fear...
palms to the sky that wait to be filled
raised in surrender under the breaking of wills
deserted, diverted, left to rot and to die
you've used us, abused us, all your promises - lies
from the history books and the twisted schools
we've been taught to question you was betrayal
and that you would never think of us as beneath you
that to challenge you would mean to fail
but hope we've received through God and we believe
he remembers the afflicted, his justice will be seen
though so many have yet to receive his light
soon they will know the message of Christ
your fear...
a stirring within us has opened our eyes
surely God above breathes the breath of new life
though you'd rather we looked to the strength of ourselves
God will be our source of power, and the world we will tell
your fear...
is our hopeThe man and the ghost will meet again
In the night when it snows, never quiet, never cold
Hear their calling, lost lords to cast the ride, white spears in their hands, pointing towards the sky
The ancient echoes from the wielded jaws, the bones and the scales, the forgotten lore
The calm of the night, lighting the flame
In the night when they haunt the curtain shall fall
Heroes and fools, all together, all the same, statues of the restless
Gallery of the drowned and the pale
The man and the ghost will meet again on the marshes of the old, though silent when it snowsKylm ja pime y, linnut lentneet ovat pois, unohduksien ilta peitt mieleni,
synkt varjot kasvoillani, yksinisen ihmisen, nen nauravan...pime
vaellukseni...johtaa kadotukseen.
Taivaan synkt pilvet, kadonneet ovat pois...
Jlleen katsoin silmiisi, mietin miksi unohdin sen.
Taivaan synkt pilvet, kadonneet ovat pois, miettimn j en, miksi lhdin pois.Nobodaddy, that's my name
And it's all my game
Everything you see
Know it's been set up by me
Got the fury and the flame
And the box in which it came
A know you want to be
Right here next to me
Sister brother
Unite all Satan's lovers
No-bo-daddy is the CEO
Sister brother
Unite all Satan's lovers
No-bo-daddy-o
Nobodaddy, that is I
And I never die
I mean eternal bliss
Come give daddy a kiss
Goddess of the promised land
Was spitting in your hand
Now you're leaving her
For the love of Lucifer
Sister brother
Unite all Satan's lovers
No-bo-daddy is the CEO
Sister brother
Unite all Satan's lovers
No-bo-daddy-oI want to keep my money
And give away absolutely nothing
To the government who moderates my spending
and obliterates depending on what time of the year
brutality is near
in the form of income tax
I'd rather take a fucking axe
to my face, blow up this place
with you all in it, I'd do it in a minute
If I could write off your murder
I'd save all of my receipts
because I'd rather you be dead
than lose a tiny shred of what I made this fiscal year
I'd rather you be dead than ponder parting with my second home
I'd rather you be dead than consider not opening a restaurant
I'd rather you be dead
I'd rather you be dead
Prepare the laser-beam
I'm gonna use it tonight
Engage the laser-beam
It's gonna end your life
I'm gonna use it tonight
If I could write off your murder
I'd save all of my receipts
because I'd rather you be dead
than lose a tiny shred of what I made this fiscal year
I'd rather you be dead than ponder parting with my second home
I'd rather you be dead than consider not opening a restaurantDetruncated
Legs forced down into pavement
By hole in flatbed truck
Blatantly painful roadrash device
Shredding limbs when appendages need a trim
Two solid bloody lines for miles
Grinded bone, muscle-flesh fragments
Grated up to the waist
Screaming stump for the vultures to taste
Left by the roadside-ded
Amputation through roadrash
Left by the roadside
DeadI enter the gates
Into the realm where nothing dies
But I'm still so cold inside
Mesmerized...
By visions past and gone
Till the end of time
I will eternally dwell
Im dunkelsten der Strme
Falle zusammen die Kerkerwand
Die mich schier endlos band
Und herrlicher und freier walle
Meine Seele ins unbekannte Land
In the darkest of storms
May crumble the dungeonwall
That bound me almost endlessly
And delightful and free may pilgrimage
My soul into the unknown land
I fly with the raven
Through timeless spheres of frost...
Through wasted lands of dreams
Geflohen vor der Wirklichkeit - vor Ewigkeiten
Und jenseits der Schwrze erstreckt sich
Ein unendliches Meer aus Grau...
Ein Meer aus gestaltloser Leere
Doch die Qualen und der Schmerz verbleiben
Als Erinnerungen an die vergangene Zeit
Stolz und doch verzweifelt...
Und in meinem Innersten hoffe ich
Da mein Leben nur ein Traum ist...
Fled from reality - for eternities
And on the other side of the blackness
An endless sea of greyness extends...
A sea of formless emptiness
Yet the misery and the pain remain
As memories of passed time
Proud yet desperate...
And deep inside I hope
that my life is just a dream...
The moon is my blanket
In this cold domain
So ancient - so cold...
As a nightmare creature I crawl
Awakened from my sleep
To forever be...
Wiedergeboren...
Bei den drei Monden durch Mittwinters Tore
Reborn...
By the three moons through midwinter's gates
I'm a shadow on haunted ground
Laughing in sorrow
Crying in lust
The storm is calming and death is rising
Evil - as pure as night
Proud - full of sin
Once again I'll rise...
To survive eternity...The night's an offspring of black dreams
Everything's dark, the shades on the walls
Invite me
The memory of my dreams is a distant light
The wind groans the sign of my soul
The night embraces me
You've taken everything away
You've only left an empty snap
And this words that are dead since ages
The could universe
Has sticked to my face
The wishes have died somewhere
I'm only lying in the silence
The hours elapse on
Every memories are taken away by the dimness
My soul's dancing in a red-hot fire
I'm flying in the wind far away from the earthSchau auf deine Haende
Look upon your fingers
Erkenne deine Kraft
And see how strong they fight
Finger sind Gold
Fingers are gold
Und Gold ist Macht.
And gold is might.
Goldfinger, Goldfinger.
Goldfinger, Goldfinger.Trapped aggression that needs explode
Fire all cannons ready for reload
Burning anger that's ready to ignite
Fists will fly and settle this tonight
Blistering vengeance, the hatred's alive
A grip on your throat, you'll never survive
Vicious emotion, begin to see red
Blood thirsty thoughts within your head
[Chorus:]
When Hell breaks loose
I'm ready to kill
When Hell breaks loose
You know I will
When Hell breaks loose
I'm ready to kill
When Hell breaks loose
You know I will
Anger burns the flame
Set to go insane
All are in a craze
Decimate and set it all ablaze
Tormented resentment, all you can find
Virtue and honour are in a decline
Brutal violence and boiling blood
Let it die drowning in the mud
[Chorus]
When Hell breaks loose
When Hell breaks loose
When Hell breaks loose[instrumental][Instrumental]No rest from the demon within
I'm always fighting to be free
Battling the forces of evil
Now fate has chose my destiny
Walking through the fires of the land of the dead
I'm between heaven and hell
The righteous path is hidden from the wicked and the damned
I'm between heaven and hell
I stand at the gate of admission
Where I've come I can not tell
Visions of heaven before me, I cross the threshold
And it's hell
Between heaven and hell[music: Puolakanaho & Vetel?inen & EToS]
[lyrics: Puolakanaho & Vetel?inen]
I saw her standing by the crimson sea...
Her gazing was intense but so dead...
The teardrops corroded the soil...
She couldn't say a word to me...
I know I want to be the young bride of the crimson sea
I'm here to join the dark waves on this sacred night
I know I must return my heart to the Gods of the seas
to become the maiden of those crimson skies
Isolated by the silent thoughts...
They were too strong for her mind...
Misguided by the burning desires...
She couldn't resist them at all...
I know I want to be the young bride of the crimson sea
I'm here to join the dark waves on this sacred night
I know I must return my heart to the Gods of the seas
to become the maiden of those crimson skies
I heard her whispers of remorse...
Her naive mind was much too weak...
Her fragile soul was hurt by the night too black...
All she wanted was to be a part of the sea...My sacrifice
I'm looking at you face to face
I'm staring at you in the eye
I'm so alone in this fucking crowd
I won't unite with what I despise
My sacrifice, I'd give it all
To share some life
Whether you like this or not
This is where I belong
Throw all you've got at me
But I'll shove it all back down your throat
My sacrifice, I'd give it all
To share some life
I'd share some life
I'd share some life
For the new faces I'll fucking fight
For the true few who deserve respect
I'll fucking fight
My sacrificeA man held hostage
By this contagion
Alone abandoned
In search of legion
Under pressure
Under black skies
We must find the cure
Before we die
I can see the bullets rip
Inside the crossfire
My suicide run through
The razor wire
All must endure
We will not live forever
All must endure
We will not live forever
Terror awaits me
At every turn
Honor is stronger
We fight all at once
Hate spreads like wildfire
In foreign lands
Incurable pain is this
Gun in my hand
All must endure
We will not live forever
All must endure
We will not live forever
Who wants to live
Who wants to live
Forever
All must endure
We will not live forever
All must endure
We will not live forever
All must endure for the mercy of one
All must endure for the mercy of one
Mercy of one
Mercy of one
Mercy of oneOut in the streets
We're fighting tonight
We're dirty and mean
So run for you lives
Stand side by side
With our fists in the air
We live for the night
On the razor's edge
Unleashing the sound
Lashing out, striking down
All those who stand in the way
Taking their lives
Crushing them just like flies
The cries of the wounded in pain
Fighting the fight
As we race through the night
With power like never before
Hammering, bashing them
Pounding and smashing them
Hard so we won't take a fall
Like a raging inferno
We'll torture and burn
Up in a sea of flames
We'll beat you and whip you
Of honor, we'll strip you
Down on your knees and beg
We're fighting it out till the end
We're living our lives for the sins
Fighting the fight
As we race through the night
With power like never before
Hammering, bashing them
Pounding and smashing them
Hard so we won't take a fall
Like a raging inferno
We'll torture and burn
Up in a sea of flames
We'll beat you and whip you
Of honor, we'll strip you
Down on your knees and beg
Fighting the fight
As we race through the night
With power like never before
Hammering, bashing them
Pounding and smashing them
Hard so we won't take a fallThe war against Intelligence
War versus Intelligence
Notebooks out plagiarists
War Against Intelligence
War versus Intelligence
They got a lot of debris yesterday
They stuck out its golden horns
And volunteered its essence
War Against Intelligence
Hey pseud!
Why did you defect to the other side?
Hey dude!
Give the info a rest and use your mind
Dancing with your Dada mates [Dad and mates] in the corner
You're such a bloody fool
You think your haircut is distinguished
When it's a blot on the English landscape
Hey dude!
Get your mental bones right outta here!
You!
It's beyond your capability
Hey git!
In the league of mental short-arse
And you will never recompense
For your war versus intelligence

Wanna go to the place(where)i dream
Wanna go to the place(where)i hope
Searching for my angel
I know i must believe I'm not wrong
Wanna hear her voice with no hesitation
Just can't hear her voice
Searching for my angel
I know I'm sure now I'm not wrong
Wanna hear her voice with no hesitation
Still can't hear her voice
"oh, please let me hear your voice", the angel of salvation
Wonder if she talks to me and holds my body certainly
"so, please let me hear your voice", the angel of salvation
Wonder if she takes on me wonder if she gives her love to me
"oh, please let me hear your voice", the angel of salvation
Wonder if she talks to me and holds my body certainly
"so, please let me hear your voice", the angel of salvation
Wonder if she takes on me wonder if she gives her love to meEveryday it starts again
Waking up to feet on shaky ground
This is just another poor excuse for trying
The more I give the more you take away
Now every ounce I have, I draw
Just to push me through another day
Heels dragging
Heart lacking
But it's so damn hard
When the weight of the world
Is on your shoulders
Now who am I to express and complain
That this is killing me?
It never matters
I said it once and I'll say it all again
Keep screaming, keep waving
You're digging holes and I'm buried inside
No one can hear you
But if we give up now
Then at least we can say we tried
Everyday it starts again
Waking up to feet on shaky ground
This is just another poor excuse for trying
The more I give the more you take away
Now who am I to express and complain
That this is killing me?
It never matters
I said it once and I'll say it all again
Keep screaming, keep waving
You're digging holes and I'm buried inside
No one can hear you
But if we give up now
At least we can say we tried
Heels dragging
Heart lackingYou think that everyone's against you
You think the world's a conspiracy
Life is a movie about you
We're all supporting your lead
You've been up for a week or two
You've done everything with nothing to do
Eyes so big how do you see
You've lost all your personality
Spun Vacation, Chemical Noose
Completely lost and right in front of me
Can't go to work, gotta stay clean
Spinning in circles take a soma
Now revive in a coma
Can't find any, can't find none
Oh my god the vacation's done
Wish you had a little bump to smoke
You smell the punchline and don't get the joke
Don't pick up the phone don't get the door
Gotta pick your face and do some more
Hallucination entertaining you
Wish you could eat, sleep, or find something to do
Fly, like a sigh
No way to save yourself inside
Sleep, like it's time
Try to remind yourself
One more time
Sleep, like it's time
No way to hold it down
It's time to die
Spun Vacation, Chemical Noose
Broken Headlight, Chemical Noose[Chorus:]
Backwards from point of destruction
The end is my introduction
Watch it unfold as I transcend
Transcends as I watch it unfold.
Smash head first into on coming traffic
Missed the red light cause' I was driving erratic.
Backwards 100miles an hour down the e-way
Lights blurrin' by me makin' it hard for me to see straight
Eyes all glossy and my brain on tilt,
Got out the car man, fuck a seatbelt
Stumblin, lookin' for my keys to my car.
Mighty mighty drunk now, back at the bar.
Blood all over, now it's seeping back
And the bullet is returning to the gun under my chin
Sirens disappear from the front of my house
Weird 911 asking what the emergency about
I' m goin' crazy insane, tryin to maintain, everything I love is causing me all the pain.
My family's all gone, check the message on the phone.
Turn the lights on, cause' I just got home .
[Chorus: x2]
Backwards from point of destruction
The end is my introduction
Watch it unfold as I transcend
Transcends as I watch it unfold.
I kissed her lips, shut her eyes, and stepped away
I grabbed the knife out her throat and hear her say
"She doesn't love me" but she doesn't see the blade that I sunk into her house with through
the window in the rain.
Keeps pouring as I stand on her steps, before I walk up I pause and take a deep breath
Pull up in the drive and shut the lights off
I keep thinkin' man "I can't get caught"
I'm in a frantic-panic
I committed a sin
Shirt soaked in bloody shit down to my skin
Now the deed is done, the hole is sealed tight
This bitches' bones will never again see the light
I remember pickin' up the pole for the bludgeoning
And the mile of following that you might call stalking
It ain't my fault she next to me at the bar
That's the hoe that's been polluting my dreams
[Chorus: x2]
Backwards from point of destruction
The end is my introduction
Watch it unfold as I transcend
Transcends as I watch it unfold.
The bullet flew out his neck and up my gun barrel
My finger raised off the trigger, and stayed curled
I lifted up off my back, and now I'm standing
His fist pulled outta' my eye- he's demanding
My jacket and wallet, but I walk in reverse
Backup outta' the alley I shoulda' passed in the first place.
Now time and chance are on my side
The inevitable has been denied.
[Chorus:]
Backwards from point of destruction
The end is my introduction
Watch it unfold as I transcend
Transcends as I watch it unfold(We need to see our vision-we can make it come true
Living out our creation, no more sins to pay)
We need to see our vision, we can make it come true
Living out our creation, no more sins to pay
We are carried away, like a leaf in a rainstorm
We're all alone -all alone
How can we be strong ?
We all see with clarity
One breath to feel as one
Fate is in our hands we need to carry on
Time to make a move we're the ones that will go on
Fate is in our hands we need to carry on
The undying fire, takes you higher
We need a new direction to conquer and divide
We will be the navigators sworn to a great divine
Dont let it slip away, dont let it slip away
A desolation on and on, on and on
We know that we are strong
We all see with clarity
One breath to feel as one
Fate is in our hands we need to carry on
Time to make a move we're the ones that will go on
Fate is in our hands we need to carry on
THe undying fire takes you higher
There are no miracles the process is long
Raise your hands we can't -be- wrong
We all see with clarity
One breath to feel as one
Fate is in our hands we need to carry on
Time to make a move we're the ones that will go on
Fate is in our hands we need to carry on
The undying fire takes you higher
Raise-Your-hands-fate is in our hands
Raise-your-hands-need to carry on
Raise-your-hands-don't let it slip away.Spirit let this be it I have had enough
You the mother of fear lend me my courage
And let it guide me through the fear of life
I'm begging, I'm pleasing you to complete me
Please complete me
Can you save me from myself?
I'm begging, I'm pleasing, I'm carving myself within
You and I together forever
Complete me
You fill my veins with your energy
I want my life back cause I like being perfect
Let me control you once more
Without me you're nothing so why can't I get rid of you
You're a self-proclaimed king
So what makes you wanna harm so bad
Can you save me from myself?
I'm begging, I'm pleasing, I'm carving myself within
You and I together forever
Complete me
By united efforts we shall overcome
Complete meKneeling before the carnal demon machine
On hands and knees she shallows divinity
Begging for forgiveness, the blessing of a kiss
The essence of denial, the pleasure of her sin
Father please embrace me
My lusts I lay unto thee
Free me from temptation
May you scourge this skin with the seeds of salvation
She's crying beneath an image
An image of a hundred thorns
Rivers that calm, rivers that lie
Thorns like nails driven into her flesh
Ecstacy nailed to the cross
Holy water pouring on my breasts
On hands and knees I shallow divinity
A picture that calms, a picture that lies
I'm drowning in the face of Jesus ChristHe had found a way to leave, to somewhere far from now
Traveling in his time machine a dream that had come true
Fly my friend, you will see, something called reality
I feel good, I'm alright, doing what I please - I travel time
Far beyond the rising sun I ride the winds of fate
Prepared to go where my heart belongs - back to past again
I just want to save the universe for all mankind
He wants to save the future of the Earth
Step by step surroundings change as years go passing by
He only stops to gaze a little while
I push the button further on, I just can't get enough
I know I will return again but still I'm movin' on
Far beyond the rising sun...
As I'm movin' on I see things to come, I see tears and I hear laughter
Curiosity, comin' over me, what is next and what will happen
And I see the lies and I hear the cries and the marchin' of the people
As they go to war, Heaven knows what for - God I think I've had enough now
Too late, too late - I can't go back no more! I lost control of the engine
No light, no light - can't see where I have gone! Can't see where I have now gone to
Where am I now - stranded in time
So many years have passed since I had gone and I have seen what's gonna be
But now I know it is useless to travel on
And I will return to the time and place I belong to
Far beyond the rising sun.... [Repeat]It boils down to
That I'm bored to tears
Bottom line is it ends right here
Shot yourself
Cried short changed save your breath
So say what you will
Scrape the bottom
I've had my fill
Sell yourself
You've sold out
Sent packing
By yourself
Entry
Into the empty
I have a tongue
Like a machete
So be ready
I am
Evil on swift wings
That comes to punish all things
A whisper in a windstorm
Soul's mine
Cause you're at sick
Your sold down the river of Styx
Shot out and shut down
Just a total let down
Blood boils
Bored to tears
Bottom line is it ends right here
Exit
Into the empty
I have a tongue
Like a machete
So be ready
I am
Evil on swift wings
That comes to punish all things
A whisper in a windstorm
I am
Evil on swift wings
Echoes in the trees
Voices on the leaves
That carry
Got swept up
God knows now
Got swept up and taken
I'm good as polished gold
For every reason
There's a season
Face up to the facts
Four by two I'm leaving you
Foul play
No longer fair play
It's just a reality
Four by two I'm leaving you
Face up to the facts
There's no last minute turning back
Figure the flag is down
And you're not holier than thou
I am evil on swift wings
That comes to punish all things
A whisper in a windstorm
I am evil on swift wings
Echoes in the trees
Voices on the leaves
That carry
I am evil
On swift wings
I am evilWe are suns nation
And we do creation
Of perfect temptation
By sound is the mission
Thrugh the darkness of future past
A chant between two worlds
We are suns nation
And we do creation
Open dimensions
Releasing damnation
The touch of the infernal creatures never heals
We are suns nation
And we do creation
Of perfect temptation
By sound is the mission
Thousands of lifeless sounds
Create trance chant of evil
Fire walk with us!! Fire walk with us!!
Through the darkness of future past
The touch of the infernal creatures
Through the darkness of future past
The touch of the infernal creatures...
Where you came from??
I came from where you see the dark...

To the highest peaks
On pathways through a wild forgotten landscape
In search of God, in spite of man
'til the lost forsaken endless. . .
This is where I choose to tread
Fall. . .so shall we fall into the nihil?
The nothingness that we feel in the arms of the pale
In the shadow of the grim companion who walks with us
Here is the landscape
Here is the sun
Here in the balance of the earth
Where is the god?
Has he fallen and abandoned us?
As I'm stalked by the shadow of death's hand
The fire in my heart is forged across the land
Here at the edge of this world
Here I gaze at a pantheon of oak, a citadel of stone
If this grand panorama before me is what you call God. . .
Then God is not dead
I walked down to a river and sat in reflection of what had to be done
An offering of crimson flowed into the water below
A wound of spirit from which it floated and faded away
. . .like every hope I've ever had. . .
. . .like every dream I've ever known. . .
It washed away in a tide of longing, a longing for a better world
From my will, my throat, to the river, and into the sea. . .
. . .wash away. . .
. . .fade away. . .
Here is the landscape
Here is the sun
Here at the edge of the earth
Where is the god?
Has he fallen to ruin?
As I'm stalked by the shadow of death's hand
My heathen pride is scarred across the landA season died,
no tears were shed,
my eyes turned gold,
there was fire in the sky.
We were sundrenched.
My world turned green
and breathed as a new-born,
my eyes turned gold
there was fire in the sky.
We were sundreched.Tripping in dimension, never dared to see this far
Projected through my mind's eye
Brilliant light, blinding sight, burning
Nullified and stone cold, something wants to rape my soul
Running from the vile
Evil force, fight it off, must resist!
Soaring through the sky, there's a demon in my mind
Blasting of my soul, I lay sleeping, body cold
Limbo for all time unless I can find my way
Out of - Out of body, out of mind
Out of - Out of body, in my mind
Wicked is the power hunting me, the spirits prey
Tenacious and persistent, won't give in, can't give up, never
Facing off to lay claim
Time could soon run out for me
Warring with the demon
Vicious cries, sinful eyes, crave what's mine
Soaring through the sky, there's a demon in my mind
Blasting of my soul, I lay sleeping, body cold
Limbo for all time unless I can find my way
Out of - Out of body, out of mind
Out of - Out of body, in my mind
Drift from my world to the other
Demon screaming out for me
Lost my earthly foothold, failed to win back my soul
Everything is gone now
Won't get back, can't get back, never!
Floating off to nowhere, cursed to drift on endlessly -
There's no life, there's no death
Just hell!
Soaring through the sky, there's a demon in my mind
Blasting of my soul, I lay sleeping, body cold
Limbo for all time unless I can find my way
Out of - Out of body, out of mind
Out of - Out of body, in my mind
Out of mind
In my mind
Out of body
Thrust from my world to the other
Lost and gone forever in my hell
My hell!Intenacious, intersecting
Reaving fats from corporal griskin
Culled...for sodden gelatine brayed
Skeletal groats triturated, desinently
Exsiccated, sere glutenate brewed
For frivolous solvent abuse...
Derogate coarse remains
For glue to dry
Despoiled marrow razed
A truculent shambles so severe
Extravated bone, as adhesive incarnate
A pellucid quietus, nocuosly I create
Corporal glue, breathe in the fumes
Mucilage vapours, toxic fumes to savour
Comminuted remains
As gum to dry
A lissom gel so glazed
A truculent shambolic affair
The exsanguine esprit, shorted as snuff
Rheumic oils forever, Bonded together as gum
Human glue, choke on the fumes
Noxious vapours, slaughterous labourSee the portal, gate to madness
Locked forever in a veil of shame
Deny extraction
Thirst for disgrace
Watch his break
The emperor's killed
Light of the day
Shadows from beyond
Scaffold of steel
The throne has gone
Dethroned emperor
The foot of the stairs, dimension in might
The king sits, his eyes are glass
Growing of the small
The laughter's fall
Can you deny
Remaining cries?
Descent of the lords
Into the trap
Existence and hate
Unseen gate
Dethroned emperorI decline April's fall
High time to refine and vacate
Still I'll miss such listless bliss
This path was the last recourse
Lucid hopes
Chaos merchants
Mingling thus
Socialise this conscience
Dream that dream
Spirits will employ
The slaughterhouse to guide you here
Nexus to hollow lies
Jaded is the ocean view
Redefine your anodyne
The company profits today
I imbibed
Every drop to survive
To keep alive
Lifeless wills that I scribed
Elucidate
When the depths take my hand
Blinded by the moment I claimed this mire
A refuge from amentia and an epoch of desire
Labouring alone beneath the mirror of the sky
Transcend this foul elixir
The firmament is nigh
I won't concede I am a relic of the damned
I have scribed
Every word to survive
To keep alive
Lifeless drops I've imbibed
Elucidate
When the depths free my hand
Blinded by the moment I claimed this mire
A refuge from amentia and an epoch of desire
Labouring alone beneath the mirror of the sky
Transcend this foul elixir
The firmament is nigh
I won't concede I am a relic of the damned
Time conceives you like a tide within the ocean's eye
All the power of a winter in the desert skyI am god's cancer
I am the hunter
Where ever you are you will be found
Potential is all around
In a slow pace you crawl
A trail of blood and skin
Marks your downfall
Tell me of your tortures
I'll try not to laugh
An abomination
You should see yourself
Punsih you beyond belief
No set rules for you to follow
I treat you as I see fit
Your hands are tied
Yesterday i needed you
Today you're going to die
Human flesh
Human life
Destroy everything
All the good inside
Watch it all dieI have a good mind
Take into my head
To start of singing
Began reciting
We seldom get together
And meet each other
On these poor borders
The luckless lands of North
I have a good mind
Take into my head
To start of singing
Began reciting
Those words we've got
From the North's furthest fields
Those words we've got
From the heaths of KalevalaMany a weary night endured
Since the utter charm of joy has pured
My unquiet dreams, my misery
How sweet if I could share with thee
Unable to endure its smile
Which kindly eased my sombre veil
I frightened turned my burdened head
And hid in slumbers shade instead
But lifted from my mournful rest
Was I by thee nocturnal guest
When thou did vow to suffocate
My tranquil dreams in thrones bed
You spoke to me with loathed glow
And thus have thou not kept thy vow
For when thy shadow sprang on me
I closed my eyes in ecstasyUp and out, I never regretted a thing
Take a glance from the inside, it isn't what you think
This is it, this is everything I have
So between you and me, give up all fucking hope
I've got the answer, so save your fucking explanation
This is the last time I'll suffer through your exploitation
Harvest truth and save it for your revelation
I've lost all trust and I've finally had the realization
All my heroes have failed me
And all your heroes will fail you
Give up hope, give up all fucking hope
Give up hope, give up all fucking hope
I don't care and I'm through hearing you justify
You've given up and I know you've fucking died inside
We've burned it all and everything it signifies
I've reached my breaking point and I finally realize
All my heroes have failed me
And all your heroes will fail you
All my heroes have failed me
And all your heroes will fucking fail you, fail me, fail you
Give up hope, give up hope
Give up hope, give up all fucking hope
I'm sick of trying and I'll never put my trust in you
No more heroes, no promise of something new
It's over now, there's no more damage that you can do
You're dead to me because me and you are finally through
All my heroes have failed me
And I have given up hope
This is the last time
I ever place my trust in someone else
And I have given up all fucking hopeExistence
detached from your world
Desirous wishes
of love and pain
Inhuman
Darkness
Vague dreams
Sweet sorrow
Unspeakable aliveness
In your blood
In your veins
Mighty alien race
Without eyes
watching the emptiness
It's getting closer
to you
Invulnerable
You've heard
the fluttering wings
Revelations in black
Your gift of grace
In your blood
In your veins
Mighty alien race
In your blood
In your veins
Mighty alien race
As predicted
The forever indomitable
Infamous being
Revelations in black
You gift of graceGot out of bed about 3 PM thought it was a holiday
Then my boss called just to tell me
I'm late and he's giving my job away
Well I took me a walk to the liquor store
So I could drink away my blues
Spent my last ten bucks, then I dropped the bottle
And I broke it all over my shoes
So I got home to find the power's shut off,
There was someone knocking at my door
It was my landlord serving an eviction notice
'Cause my checks are bouncing off the floor
I pounded my head up against the wall
Thinking what else could go wrong
But this was only the beginning to a real bad day,
It wasn't gonna be a lot of fun
I knew I should have never gotten out of bed
'Cause of the rain cloud above my head
I'm down on my luck and it's plain to see
So tell me why does this happen to me?
When it rains it pours, when it rains it pours on me
When it rains it pours, and there's a storm moving in on me
When it rains it pours, raining down on only me
When it rains it pours, when it rains it pours
I drove across town to go see a friend
When I heard a siren on my tail
It turned out I had a warrant for my arrest
And I couldn't even post the bail
So I'm sittin' in a cell for 48 hours
Keepin' company with thieves and drunks
I'm free to go but my car's impounded
And I'm thinkin' 'bout becoming a monk
So I'm wandering around in a catatonic daze
Now barely a shell of a man
I look like I live out of a shopping cart
And I'm picking up aluminum cans
I staggered my way to an overpass
And fell to the dirt asleep
I figured out tomorrow is a new day
And maybe I could buy myself a life real cheapMemories of torment strikes me
Attempts were made to suffocate me at birth
Fools
I was already ancient
Thou can not kill what breeds within Thee
Alas, this agony
The emptiness of earthborn pride
Hath stirred my faithful heart
Which guided me to darker paths
Far away from their pestilent ways
Cleansed was I from deceitful grace
Yet, put to scorn was I
By those unclean
Enslaved by ignorance
They blindy spat upon the deity of hate
Awake is the darkest fiend
By the fallen one I shall arise
Upon bewildered masses
To whom the indulgence of my soul
Portray as sin made god
I shall revile and quell the source
Whence mockery of my kind derive
This I know
Facile shalt my quest not come to pass
Deathwish be my gift to all at last
Honour
Commended no longer as virtue
Yet, shalt be extolled at light's demise
By the fallen one I shall arise
Believer
Speak not to me of justice
For none have I have seen
By God, I shall give as I receive
Betrayer
Speak not to me at all
You and this world ripped my fucking heart out
Again... and again... and again...And note of your own choice, boys and girls
Inadequate planters, methadone stubbies
You got energy vampires
More hands on the tranquillizers
An unholy alliance
And jokes about faith
Give me another drink
You're as strong as your weakest link
A mess of My age
A mess of my race
A mess of our radio
I remember the times
This was a beginning
Of a permissive new age
But it's the same old cabbage
A mess of my age
A mess of our race
A mess of our our our our
I don't look at myself
I have no health
Take no notice of me
I probably work for a record company
A mess of our age
A mess of my taste
A mess of our nervous systems
Cowering mockers
The company money's ran out
To longer hot properties
Get back in their closets
A mess of my age
A mess of my race
Fill the rest in yourselfIt tastes so bittersweet
And I know everything it can do
Push and pull, you're taking me
Pushing me close to the edge
[Incomprehensible]
Break the cycle, turn away
And it tastes so bittersweet
And I know everything it can do
All the times I felt so cold
It didn't ease the pain
My stomach left in knots
And all I feel is pain
My head a scattered mess
My words a scattered mess
Can I turn away, it tastes so bittersweet
And I know everything it can do
I know I said what you can do
But I'll face this choice once again
I'll face this choice once again
There is nothing left to give away
There is nothing left to give away
There is nothing left to give away
There is nothing left to give
It tastes so bittersweet
And I know everything it can do
Push and pull, you're taking me
Pushing me close to the edge
All the times I felt so cold
Will I never break this mold?
And it tastes so bitter sweet
Yes, I know everything I could do
I know, I said what you can do
But I'll face this choice once again
Face this choice once again
Once again, once again[c-murder talking]
You know you done fucked up?
You know you done fucked up, don't ya?

Ready to kill 'em, if I see 'em
Fuck alarm, hold my paper

And they ain't restin til they deep up in the concrete
Jungle with them slangers, with them bangers and them hustlers
With them killers, smokin woo and makin deals with my tru niggas
Fiend had some yay, so we flipped it on the block
Steady mobbin' flew from cali so we put 'em up on the spot
Servin dub sacks and flippers, fifty shots and quarter bags
Raisin riches no matter week, servin keys out paper bags
And hustlin hard, countin money by the sack
Watch my back, niggas jack
Sweet revenge, counter attack up in my 'lac
Sippin hennesy and chronic, I'm the tweak for some magic
Rollin the window, nigga, it's him so pistol playin bout to have it
Fuckin bullets gots no name nigga you name is on this one
Ridin dirty with my tru bitches so nigga on a mission
[chorus:] (lines echo in background) x 4
In on a mission, ridin dirty with my tru thugs
Retaliation, dumpin rounds, with no love
[fiend]
Fiend, my reason to gunplay
Loadin my chopper right up the one way
Wishin we facin a dead end
So I could show how this gun spray
Just one damn word, that's all I desire
So I could bend these niggas back like chicken wire
Spittin fire, mobbin, s'on when them bullets get to pourin

I ain't ignorin, no problems, no worries baby
I severed the crusher, and buried my (..? ..)
Over the dresser, fiend the trigga my lesser
Gon test ya, with a season to kill
And catch me celebratin across the battlefield
Loco, this is the deal, let's put the gun
To the small of his neck, we got caught up and blast
Until there's nothing left, boy

Cause I ain't facin prison
Exercising my right to exorcism
Completed my mission, huh?

Cause they the reason my lil homie ain't livin
So, we on a mission
Chorus x 4
[steady mobbin' 1]
(..? ..) the cleaner, alias saddam, nigga
(what's up there? ) cold cop killers
Now it's really on (what's up fool? )
Being crooked, we do it dirty, (we doing it!)
See-murder and fiend (there they go!)
We dump the fifty round magazine
Locin and mobbin, til it's clean (make sure it's clean)
Hooked up with the colonel, and the billy, cause I need cream
Fifteen five, made twenty five, six hummer size (nigga!)
Muthafuckas died, (nigga!) all in one night (they die!)
[steady mobbin' 2] (a lot of these lines are overlapped by screams,
Gunshots, etc. hard to understand...)
Pulled the trigga on my nigga (not my nigga, damn!)
As the forty caliber shell, blew up in the neck
Twice in the head, he was dead 'fore his body hit the ground
(damn dog, don't go nigga!)
Bitches scream, nigga (..? ..)
Pull up next to the bodies, I was runnin
My dog's head was blew off
I'm bustin hella (? ) (buck, buck, buck)
Hit the driver's side window, as they crash into a pole
(..? ..), with a few left in the clip
Some for the driver, the passenger
And the rest of the trigger menDestroying lives of innocence, collateral dissonance
Malignant depravity
Faith based mob and their mentality
Bodies were falling, burning and screaming
Buildings collapsing, disintegrating
Hellfire scorching, blinding the sky
Descending like rain
You will believe this blood sacrifice
Life was the price for change
All to kill, dominate
All to kill, for control
A false flag conceals truth to sacrifice chosen few
Destruction, conspiracy,
An inside job done with efficiency
Bodies were falling, burning and screaming
Buildings collapsing, disintegrating
Hellfire scorching, blinding the sky
Descending like rain
You will believe this blood sacrifice
Life was the price for change
All to kill, dominate
All to kill, for control
Our fate lies in the hands of men
Their lies, our fate, our lives, the grave
A master plan of damnation
A controlled demolition
Hellfire scorching, blinding the sky
Descending like rain
You will believe this blood sacrifice
Life was the price for change
Our blood forever stained on the street
Blood can't be washed away
All to kill, dominate
All to kill, for controlAn ancient figure crowds my focused path
His lightning bolt eyes creep through my sight
Dim Ignition
Wither the dwellers, we're free now
Dim ignition, dim ignition
Murder develops your kingdom
Dim ignition, dim ignitioncalm lovers' crash
both swallowing pain
wound & scar industries
intense indifference
I'm a jester puppet
squalid crumbcollector
hard hours' theorist
stiff pattern reactor
and I struggle for the air
in my lunatic asylum
small breathless space
shy irony king
that's what I am
you crawl in loss for words
drownin' in despair
innocence's torn
with pills, drugs & guns
you feel like live on
with storms by your side
at neon flames horizon
there's nowhere to hide
now!
look what you've done
tell me what went wrong
deep under my skin you creep
poison slowly flows
staring at those hollow halls
sliperry shifts,digged out distrust
never wanted this way to end
never thought this heart's so cold
seems everythins we had is gone
all love is dead
we fall
symphaty's lost
display no regrets
hear no honest truths
anger overflow
fragile sunny moments
unfairly erased
half - speed discouragement
toxic shock syndrome
you feel like live on
with none by your side
down on my knees I/ve realised
you're fuckin' waste of time
the winners of a losers' cup
more still come to after the breakBroken teath, a shattered jaw
Ten to one, behold my God
Wicked sons of heaven's loss
Raise your own inverted cross
King's of earth, iron fist
Serve the sacred you dismissed
Stand before your final day
Choke on every line you pray
Raise your glass to death
Not one second left
Wake the lifeless, die to fight this
Stand beside me. Storm the Gates of Hell
Wake the lifeless, die to fight this
Stand beside me. Storm the Gates of Hell.
Storm the Gates of Hell.
Coward's heart, a serpent's tongue
Stand to face what you've outrun
Fear of death, fear of pain
Bound to all you took in vain
No more lies, no regrets
Sever ties and hollow debts
Open eyes, live to learn
Or watch your blessed temple burn
Raise you glass to death
Not one second left
Wake the lifeless, die to fight this
Stand beside me. Storm the Gates of Hell
Wake the lifeless, die to fight this
Stand beside me. Storm the Gates of Hell.
Storm the Gates of Hell.

And for better or for worse I was born into a hearse
I know I said my heart beats for you. I was lying girl, it beats for two
Because I got your love and I got these vices
Take back every word I've said, ever said to you
Take back every word I've said, ever said to you
Ever since this began, I was blessed with a curse
And for better or for worse I was born into a hearse
I know I said my heart beats for you. I was lying girl
I've been lying to you
Everything I touch turns to stone
So wrap your arms around me, and leave me on my own
Everything I touch turns to stone
So wrap your arms around me, and leave me on my own
Take back every word I've said, ever said to you
Take back every word I've said, ever said to you
Take back every word I've said, ever said to you
Take back every word I've said, ever said to you
Because everything I touch turns to stone
So wrap your arms around me, and leave me, I can't hold onAs I start to pen my thoughts
A rush goes through my head
Memories of 1990
Slowly passing by
I can still feel the pain
Like a sword pierced my heart
Selfishness, robbing me of you
I would always talk to you
But now not for days
I was slowly leaving you behind
Caught up her in what was going on
(It seemed so important then
but looking back now I see)
I didn't see what was ahead
Where did I go
What did I do
I let myself become king
I've seen where I've been
I know what I've done
It's time to let go and forget 1990
Again I'm here to pen my thoughts
Rushing wind blows through my head
Memories of 1990
I guess I'll always feel the pain
Feel the pain pierce my heart
Selfishness robbing me of you
Where did I go
What did I do
I let myself become king
I've seen where I've been
I know what I know
It's time to go on and forgetthe tyrant's messengers have conquered your ancestors trust
it's not too late to become converted
disown your christian faith and stop epidemic
pour the traitor's blood on the death altar...
by dark magic you'll find back peace in your spirit
rejoin us on the road of light
listen to your ancestors who lure
pray our martyrs burned by the inquisition
form the kingdom of light where they are
they'll protect you against the christian force...
prepare to rejoin our holies in the light
erect the death altar and kill in good faith
the poured blood will calm the lost soul's pain
and contribute to the divine justiceDem Tod gerade entsprungen
Die Jahreszeit der Lebensfreud'
Dunkle Weisheit hab' ich errungen
Ich bin ein Teufelskind
Bezaubernd, toter Himmel
Soll shnen all mein Leid
Auf der Suche nach Vergeltung
Oh, gottverdammte Menschenheit
All my ways left in sorrow
My pain is always yours
No beauty, no more mercy
And my seasons...
Seasons are black
Seasons in black, Seasons in black
Seasons in black, Seasons in black
Und das Frhjahr ist schwarz, so schwarz
Wie Fallobst auf schwarze Erde
klatscht der Kopf auf den Morast
Es weht die leblos' Seele
und erstarrt im eisigen Frost
Summer's day or winter's night
My world will always be
without beauty and without mercy
'cause my seasons...
my seasons are black
Seasons in black, Seasons in black
Seasons in black, Seasons in black
Und der Sommer ist schwarz, so schwarz
Und der Herbst ist schwarz, so schwarz
Und der Winter ist schwarz, so schwarz
Seasons in black, Seasons in black...How far can you go? Living the way you do? Painful as
it seems. We're lost writhing our own world. Costly is
a life. What is the price of a million dead? Worthless
are you are. A pain we must suffer. False are your
words. The truth must be surfaced. The deceitful
piper. As mice we shall follow. Profound lost soul.
Doomed for all eternity. Preacher of tomorrow. You'll
burn for you lies. Cold is the evening. As I lay naked
in the dark. Listening to the sounds of the creatures
of the night. I wonder if they will even know what
I've done. The tragedy of the souls who suffered. And
of life. They all fell victim to the knife.
Disfigured. Mangled beyond recognition. Only I
determine the fate of another life. Running free.
Enjoying my killing spree. Impersonate someone who
they trust. Emerging from the dead. I have lust.
Acquitted. There's no court that can stop me. The pain
that I saw in their face as they died. Moves me.
Floating in a river so cold. The final resting places
where my victims go. Mourning families will not know.
That loved ones feel to a merciless death. My tactics
are insane. My blade cuts deep into the softest flesh.I've lied to myself.
And you can't bare to see what I'm gonna be
All I know is that I'm lost in this sea of beliefs
That you've made for me
You weren't there for me,
But you throw it in my face after all we failed to see
I'm speechless as it occurs to me
I'll recreate the life that I never had
I should've kept the real me to myself
And let the confidence just go to your head
And pulling apart those memories
Is more like pulling teeth
Now all that we share are these two feet
Yeah
It seems to me this cycle's endless
I'm proud to be here, I'm not hopeless
We have no more time to coalesce
Can you get that through your fucking head?
With all the hurt
With everything that built up
It's buried in the dirt
There's the trust that I had
Making peace
I've been trying to feel anything but remorse for you
Remorse for you
Remorse for you
I'm speechless as it occurs to me
I'll recreate the life that I never had
I should've kept the real me to myself
And let the confidence just go to your head
And pulling apart those memories
Is more like pulling teeth
Now all that we share are these two feet
And when you break, before I break
I'll bury you away
Before you fall back on your fate
Before I break,
I'd find more comfort in the shade
With the mad man that I've made
And you've become what I could never foresee
Without a frame of mind, without a single memory, in me
And you've become what I could never foresee
Without a frame of mind, without a single memory
A memory[Instrumental]Bloodsuckers
You suck out the oil
For the salt of the earth
You ravage the soil
Strip mining mountains
You gauge out the face
You suffocate life
In an asphalt membrane
Don't eat your own heart
'cause you can never win
Bloodsuckers
You steal from the earth
You'll kill for the riches
And decide what it's worthAnd lo, I witnessed the vast seas rise forth like a great ravenous beast,
a devouring maelstrom of cataclysmic fury; and the gleaming spires
and citadels of proud, ancient Atlantis were consumed, to gleam no more...
save in the dreams of sorcerers and warriors... aye, and poets and kings.

(And that's what you get when you join the M. Clark School of
Soccer Coaching School: Enraged and inflamed with torment.)Blindfolded only to hear blank words of crooked smiles.
Crawling out of my skin to see a broken reflection of myself.
Sacrifices at the altar.
Pull the trigger, end this illusion.
A black candle burns for your cold heart.
A single choir sings for your every sin.
So banish me, erase the demons.
I see you gray eyes wink at the blade.
This breath of life and I'll watch you burn.
Thirteen locks the door, thirteen steps to break your smile.
Blindfolded only to hear blank words of crooked smiles.
Crawling out of my skin to see a broken reflection of myself.
Sacrificed at the altar.

Brutalised from the day of birth, to reality they can't return
Existing in a world of three lives inside of one
Protecting the weak points of the mind
Defensive personalities
Violent one minute calm the next
Defensive PersonalitiesCold eyes of fire talk to me
Stillborn desire in the air I breathe
In our wanton spirits I read
Closure, nauseating rites
A face and heart I heed
Unprecedented in longing
As we soar still higher
As Icarus we'll plunge
In longing manner we'll admire
Into depths all unknown
Soul and purpose set alight
Over barren lands we've flown
In transmission morning thrivesSo as you cry, as the tears slowly slip from your eyes.
I watch, standing, laughing above memories.
So as you die, as the blood slowly slips from your veins.
I watch, standing, laughing above memories.
I am a reflection of you... Solitude is bliss...[coversong of MAYHEM, released never before!]He tip toes
Down the stairs
Carefully, don't wake the baby
His wife is fast asleep
She doesn't see
The double life he's leading
The face he wears at night
What he can do with a knife
He trembles with sweet, sick satisfaction
He does it again and again and again
Another life is taken
The more I see
Of the cruelty surrounding me
The more I like my dog
The more hatred I see
Each night on my tv
The more I like my dog
He tip toes
Around the corner
Evil thoughts spin in his head
He only sees their skin
Not their faces
He wishes they all were dead
The bell rings
The children play
It's just another sunny day
Then there's a scream
It fills the air
It's not a game -- the blood is real, it's everywhere
The more I see
Of the cruelty surrounding me
The more I like my dog
The more hatred I see
Each night on my tv
The more I like my dog
A dog doesn't know how to hate
A dog doesn't discriminate
A dog doesn't premeditate
The insanity that humanity
Does .....
The more I see
Of the cruelty surrounding me
The more I like my dog
The more hatred I see
Each night on my tv
The more I like my dogMagical gris-gris and mojo bag

So begins the ritual of the dead man's tomb
Superstition where it's been said
Rituals to wake the dead, wake the dead

Giyon is said to mean bad luck
Sound of the ogan, the bell is struck
Rituals to wake the dead, wake the dead

The kwa-kwa rattle keeps in beat

Rituals to wake the dead, wake the dead
[Chorus] (x3)Enter your my world, deception
Enter your my world, deception
Deception
Deception
DeceptionPour the emerald wine
Into crystal glasses
We will touch the divine
Through kissed catharsis
Let us pitch to the seven year itch
Of the ultra-decadent
To a tainted world and the painted girls
That our fantasies spent
Tripping through boudoirs laced with opiate themes
Sipping the bizzare, tasting copious dreams
A toast to those most sacriligeous of days
Where for every whim won
One soon repays
We touched the stars
That now laugh from afar
At we, the damned
The damned
We have spent our time
Drenched in opulent splendour
But when midnight chimes
Will gilded souls surrender?
Let us drink on the giddying brink
Of pools of excrement
All manner of shit for the glamour and glitz
Mephistopheles lent
I remember the night as if it were engraved
In a bright marble bridge stretched across dark waves
To the shore from the moon and by Her grace
Came that erudite stranger
That fucker
Come my friend, to fate let's raise
Two finger shots at this our last soiree
For tomorrow I fear
Swoops all too deadly near
This precipitous weir to Hell's high gateI awoke to the sound of alarms
Delicate and caving in
Drenched in my own
This faith is coming with me
Days inch by grown weary as we sleep
April has become the numbing heart I own
I'd bleed for this again and again and again
How I need for this candle to burn forever
Forever burn
Years go by and it's what I've learned
That no one's getting out alive
No one's getting out
To gather this romance
To hide from this wind, to love understatement
To hollow out the end
Days inch by grown weary as we sleep
All the mercy I've begged at shames steps
I look for peace in this
For peace in all of this
And how I need for this candle to burn forever
Forever burn
Years go by and it's what I've learned
That no one's getting out alive
No one's getting out
And this chance to live is grown in
I'm not the walking dead and I'll never be
Strayed from distance
Time sets forward the dark
A fine light to one's true self
In a den with believers my position in decent
The name familiar at the heart of it all
At the heart of it all
White noise comes with voice
I risk the promise of giving up then giving in(instrumental)[instrutmental]Der Abend kommt und die Herbstluft weht,
Reifklte spinnt um die Tannen,
Oh Kreuz und Buch und Mnchsgebet
Wir mssen Alle von dannen.
Die Heimath wird dmmernt und dunkel und alt,
Trb rinnen die heiligen Quellen:
Du gtterumschwebter, du grner Wald,
Schon blitzt die Axt, dich zu fllen!
Und wir ziehen stumm, ein geschlagen Heer,
Erloschen sind unsere Sterne
Oh Island, du eisiger Fels im Meer,
Steig auf aus mchtiger Ferne.
Steig auf und empfah unser rieseig Geschlecht
Auf geschnbelten Schiffen kommen
Die alten Gtter, das alte Recht,
Die alten Nordmnner geschwommen.
Wo der Feuerberg loht, Glutasche fllt,
Sturmwogen die Ufer umschumen,
Auf dir, du trotziges Ende der Welt,
Die Winternacht woll'n wir vertrumen
[Text: Joseph Viktor von Scheffel (1826 - 1886)]As I look toward the horizons
Hearing the lament of ones before me
Ascertaining our lives, once wonders
Once impending doom lies in the air
Draped in the void
The veil that protects the chosen
Holes in the veil
The darkness wells up deep inside
Cold pestilent hope
The coils of disbelief
Collapsing emotions
The light exists to ones unknown
Holiness that judges without reason
The footsteps of ones truth
So attainable, the frenzy of despair
Consumed slowly, trapped in the void
So attainable
The frenzy of despair
For a million
For a million wasted lives
Befoul your
Befoul your selfish worshipI'm not sick, I'm just a boy
Sifting through the new found lie
And I'll be crawling through these ashes and dissecting all these flies
Since the sun has died and it is still somewhat July
Is this all the world has to offer?
And I don't know how much you thought I'd be
It turns to ashes on me
One more piece inside these lines
Deeper harms my disguise
And everyone is different so everyone is sly
And everything's still horrible since everyone still dies
Is this all the world has to offer?
And I don't know how much you thought I'd be
It turns to ashes on me
Is this all the world has to offer?
It turns to ashes on me
No one is safeVia the paths of the four winds
Through the icy valleys and hills
They came led by two ravens
The messengers from the hall of the slain
Warriors of a thousand battles
Skalds of a thousand stories and tales
Riding in a shadow
Which will lie over the christian fame
Hear the dark woods call
Swear for the ancient names
Odin, Thor, Valhalla
Written into the heathen flames
False beliefs fall
Hearts of steel begin to pound again
In my eyes I almost see
Dragon ships setting sails
Fathers, watch us ride
Through the northern storms
And freezing winds
We are the horde
That came from the snowy sides of hills
Brothers up there we greet you
just like you - we will never fail
Sisters, wait for the call
We will come
when we hear the Odin's hail...Once upon a time
Motherfucker disrespect you he'd wind up dead
Motherfucker's got the game twisted
Snitching fucking bitches
No more honor, no respect
What does a manhood mean?
Manslaughter, Manhood's dead
Manslaughter, manhood's dead
Motherfuckers is way out of pocket
Been getting a fucking pass
You don't hear me dog, 'till you feel that shotgun blast
I might not wear no mask
I might just let you see me
You punks is out of order
It's time for manslaughter
Manslaughter, manhood's dead
Manslaughter, manhood's dead
Sometimes I sit back and I think
I think about what man hood use to mean
How men had to stand for something
Man like my father, real men
Men had to be about something
Men had to give a fuck
Men had to power through it
A man just can't give up
Steel sharpens steel reach the deadly disease
If you don't stand for shit
Then bitch get on your knees
I will not lose
I will not lose
So what's the problem yo, every man is turning bitch
How will I solve it yo? Duct tape and a shallow ditch
Man's an endangered species, this shit is getting soft
Slip up in a foregin country
And get you head cut of
Manslaughter, manhood's dead[SHE'S FALLING]
On a distant land, far away
Intense was the summer heat
When fate struck her to the heart
Here lies what is left of her body torn and broken.
It happened here today
In these golden, peaceful wheat fields.
She's staring at the sky
All of her dreams are gone now.
Her chidhood has been stolen
By wicked men of the Northern hills.
She's falling, new angel of hatred
She's losing, all of her conscience.
To follow a dark path of blood wrath
And all she wants is vengence.
Her heart had turned to stone
No more smiles, so more cries
She had to grow so fast
Anger and sorrow filled her eyes.
She's falling, new angel of hatred
She's losing, all her righteousness
The dark path is here, a bloodbath.
Revenge is what she wants, no less
[DEADLY GRASP]
Day after day
Her courage and strenght getting stronger.
Training so hard
Have made her become a fierce warrior
Armored with steel
Her sword as light as a feather
No chance for the men she will fight.
Hear her cry of war
It's the last thing you'll hear.
She's the only one remaining alive
At the end of the battle raging.
Never show your back or death will arrive
When you'll feel her deadly grasp.
Day after day
Destroying all in the country
Working so hard
To find one of her worst enemy
Then with the steel
She'll make him pay with long agony
No chance for this man who will die.
The torment that fills her heart
And the sorrow of her soul
Can only be appeased by each blow...
Of her... sword.
Hear her cry of...
[ENDLESS DREAM]
It hunts me every nights
A dream a cannot fight.
I'm afraid to close my eyes
All i feel and see are lies.
In that dream i'm on a throne
Made of flesh and human bones.
A deadly smile on my face.
No mercy for the human race.
I wanna break free from this endless dream
I can't believe i become this evil queen.
Please release me from this endless dream.
I want to forget all these things i have seen.
In that dream i'm on my horse
Striking with a hellish force
Bodies falling all around me
It makes no sense at all to me.
In that dream i see myself die
Too much pain i can only cry
What have i done to deserve this
There must be something i have missed.
I made men pay the price for things they haven't done.
But my heart is a cold as ice and my pity's on the
run.
I'm a prisonner of my own sleep and this time, it's oh
so deep.
I'm under lock and key, it's so bad the jailer is me.
I wanna break free...
[THE PROMISE]
I'm aware of who I am
A war machine dressed to kill
I think of what i left behind
I found nothing, nothing but a chill.
I'm afraid of what I'll be
Queen of death, that's for sure
I'm at the point of no return
It's now too late to find a cure.
There's a poison running trough my veins
Dark thoughts invading my brain
When I'll get my vengence, sweet caress
I'll get out of this mess, I promise
Now that I found their shelter
I can achieve my tasks
I'll never forget the laughter
They will see who hides behind the mask.
I'm not proud of all that past
It will follow me forever
With forgiveness, I guess it won't last
I will never, never surrender
I have learned that you never win
Even if the other dies
You must fight the enemy within
There is no compromise.
There's a poison...
OH, OH, OHAin't a hope in hell,
Nothing's gonna bring us down,
The way we fly,
Five miles off the ground,
Because we shoot to kill,
And you know we always will,
It's a Bomber, it's a Bomber
Scream a thousand miles,
Feel the black death rising moan,
Because, you know we do it right,
A mission every night,
It's a Bomber, it's a Bomber, it's a Bomber
No night fighter,
Gonna stop us getting through,
Sirens make you shiver,
You bet my aim is true,
Because, you know we aim to please,
Bring you to your knees,
It's a Bomber, it's a Bomber, it's a BomberRise, i say, yes rise above
'cause evil is as evil does, what evil does to me
Down you go to lands below
'cause evil is as evil does, what evil does to me
They who reign in sand
Take this brightest strike
In their so called castles
Now with walls of glass
I can see, i can see, i can see
All your deeds, all your needs, on your knees
So i'll crack your feeble shell
Can you even see the works of what you fear?
'cause evil is as evil does what evil's done to me
Further inside, til all you have is mine
Evil is as evil does, the evil done to me
Dreams, he said
Dreams he wore
Dreams he wore
Dreams he wore
Hope, he said
Hope he wore
Love, he said
And evil he wore
I'll strip you down
I'll tear you down
I'll burden you with tears
I'll bring you down
Till nails come off
I'll turn your bed of lies
Dreams upon a night
Dreams upon your thoughts
Dreams upon your fears
And dreams upon your love
Blind to your eyes, blind to your mind
'cause evil is what evil does, what evil does to me
Taste and you'll see the fruit you took is foul
Evil is what evil does, what evil's done to me
You who turn to others
With everything you lack
A face that bears not seeing
Then i'll turn my back
I can see, i can see, i can see
All your needs, all your deeds, on your knees
So i'll crack your fucking shellHome you go tonight
To break the sound of tears
Life's fading
To keep the world away
Is not enough to ease the pain
Time is passing by
Time is passing by; i see it in your eyes
Fire burns inside
A light that's caught between
Night and day
Sun's been set to die
Hit supernova in your mind
Time is passing by
I see it in your eyes (repeat)
Time is passing by
I see it in these eyes(repeat)
They tell me all!
You can't deny
It's in your eyes
Visions disappear
Memories of a dream
Surrender
Give them to the wind
Deny your sorrow, live again
Time is passing by
I see it in your eyes (repeat)
Time is passing by
I see it in these eyes(repeat)
They tell me all!
Time is passing by
I see it in your eyes (repeat)
Time is passing by
I see it in these eyes
I see it in your eyes
You tell me all
You can't deny
You know you tell me liesFor none of these fuckers will ever know, what I think as I go. No... no not one last time. Not for me not for you. Not for what I find may scare me more than if I stayed blind. I've shot the pig. I've drawn the line. I've got my nine under my shirt. Don't worry you won't get hurt. In my head ring blood tones that make me feel less alone. Biting nails cleaning guns Biting nails cleaning guns
Bad boy: Now, we're forced to do extreme things, make some money and get the fuck out of there!I won't give in, I won't back down
No matter what you say my heart carries the truth
Whatever you say fuels my engine And every action you take is the pavement
I walk on
There's only one truth I carry with me
No one else can see No one can take it from me
Take it from me I won't give in I won't give in
Everyone can doubt about your actions, beliefs and thoughts.
They can try to hold you back and try to put you down referring to them.
What they fear is what they know you are able to achieve,
So they won't let you do it.
They can doubt about your goals because they don't understand what motivation you have.
But there is no one that can doubt about the pure strength of your will and your heart.
It is your pathfinder and the only thing they can't take away.
We won't give in.Background lead: Nergal

"To conquer fear is the beginning of wisdom
Bertrand RussellBreathing slowly, mechanical heartbeat
Losing contact with the living
Almighty TV plugged, hybrid empty brain
Don't see anything real in the game
The tension is building constantly
No reason just a reflex I have, driven by clockwork
I try to keep an eye open
And I realize I haven't closed my eyes in a long time
Neglected emotions leading to catastrophic voyage on the other side
I have been given so much stress and lack of confidence
I've been given the gift of so small hope deep inside
I haven't close my eyes in a long time, I am trying
I cannot stomach these forms and colors anymore
But I'm here to continue, after all I have been through
I try to keep my eyes open, I am realizing
This life and death more precious than anything
I won't bring no material in the after life
Take no possessions, I would rather travel light
I'm of this kind that kills all day
But I don't know yet how to die
Art of dying is the way to let all go
Within I practice, in the secret of my soul
My shape in the reflector has
Now for ever, a life on it's ownGame over

This is the end
The end.Virus-like influenzae
invade complete lymph system
gargling and gagging on mucous
Ebola
My life-every pore in a state of menstruation
Sloughing off-miserable mucous-clogged demise
Clogged
Seething mucous-lined irritation
streptococci bacterium with emerging ebola contagionForced to scorch at the stake of humanity
Our heavy skulls and cumbersome bodies fastened by straps of fear and mediocrity
Anchored and confused
Confused and naive
We bled upon the oak and iron and sang songs of revolution and tyranny
The spitting cracks of ember harmonized our singing voices as the scent of servitude left our presence and scaled through the syrupy air of a new morning
Together forever... married to illusion
Together forever... the endProud and free, that's American to me
Symptomatically and so basically
It's so definite, freedom is all of it
No humanity without restraint
Refuse to be denied, refuse to compromise
Your ideology always a lie
It's jingoistic or nationalistic
Or whatever the hell you want to call it
With my raised fist, yeah
Never be denied
I stand and resist again
Proud and free, that's a human thing to me
Burning at the core and I go to war
Ain't gonna change my way of life
Twisted rhetoric, I won't subscribe
Refuse to be denied
Refuse to compromise
Your ideology always a lie
Imperialistic, colonialists
Bandwagon patriot, wake up to this

Never be denied
I stand and resist again
Yeah
With my raised fist, yeah
Never be denied
I stand and resist again

With my raised fist, yeah
I stand and resist again
Denied, deniedAn innocent man's blood was shed
Foretold this was in past
It will cleanse the people of their sin
Forever the covering lasts
The sacrifice has now been made
We are saved by His blood
Having done all to stand
In victory from above
There is a fountain filled with blood
Drawn from Emmanuel's veins
The price has now been paid
For you
The time has come for you to choose
Choose whom you will serve
As for me and my band

Der Flammenengel:
"Erhebt euch, Sklaven des Lichts,
Lodert auf in Zerstrung!
Erbebt in Salven des Scheins
Gleissender Flammenwut."
Die Flammen:
"Gebiete, Herr,
Wir sind bereit,
Zu kmpfen als Feuer,
Zu sterben in endlicher Glut."
Der Flammenengel:
"Lodert auf,
Lodert hoch empor!
Entfachet die Welt,
Bis alles in ihr,
In Schwrze entmachtet,
Niedersinkt
Und zerfllt."
Der Weise:
"Ich frchte euch nicht.
Kommt und sehet, dass ihr vernichtet werdet,
In einem Sturm des Nichts versinkend.
Und die Welt wird ohne Licht sein
Und euren Tod feiern."
Erblhet, Krnze, wenn ihr in Rot getaucht,
Zu weiten Weiden vor dem bestrahlten Band,
In dem voll schwerem Gleichmut Farben
Brennend und glitzernd wie Schemen glimmen.
Verblasset, Schemen, bald schleicht ihr kraftlos fort,
Und niemand hlt euch, wenn ihr hinunter geht
In tiefe Gruft, das Grab des Tages,
Bis dann die Krnze im Mondlicht schimmern.Today I have lost my inner fight
Time for me to go
Innocence aches if you are angry inside
I want you to know
That injustice broke my inner defence
And now I am here to take the consequence
Your false and cold society
Are dreary minds and mean nothing to me
I can't go any further
I have reached the point of no return
These are my last words
To a world I will leave behind
These are my last words
To the ones I cannot find
Bury my heart under a different sun
With a light that is brighter
Shining on me to show everyone
Here lies no fighter
Just a dreamer born with a crystal soul
Inside of a shell
I am Falling deep into a bottomless hole

Full Dismember Lyrics...Pathetic is the species being it's own negation
Big words locked in the holy books
Flame in the eyes fixed on heaven
And the stench of decaying bodies
That have lived to see the answer
Another word spat out from under the mask
No meaning, no goal
Doomed to cling to each other
They laugh crying and lie sensing their weakness
Clotted human mass struggles
Trying to rise and run away from themselves
It's time this jest reached its end
The church of the black hole will fulfill the sacrificeA growing sickness in the heart
Distinctive lack of control
The cure is somewhere in the silence
But I'm crushed by the noise inside
Don't lock the door on me
You'd kill me, face down, dead
Another part of me falls for you
Another day in the dark, no, no
Stranded in the night
Stranded in the cold
Don't lock the door on me
You'd kill me, face down, dead
Another part of you gone to waste
Please hear me out
You kill me face down dead
Another day in the dark
Don't lock the door on me
You'd kill me, face down, dead
Another part of you gone to waste
Please hear me out
You kill me face down dead
Another day in the dark
Leave the moment alone
Leave the moment alone
Leave the moment alone
Leave the moment aloneNever seize to be amazed by new technology. there's where i truly feel at home in all hypocrisy. I have been trying to find a place where my toughest issues can rest. Now i find a questioning lifestyle to be the best.
Let's confess we've never been blessed. The acts from our history is now our burden to bear.
Revise, revise and renew.
Never stop until we've found the best for both me and you
I want you to take us back to where we started from. we need to trust to carry on.

it doesn't matter what we've done before. What will define our generation is what we've struggled for.
Determination is digging their grave. I am the joker in the game they play.
to hear is not to listen
to watch is not to see
to die is not to care for
to know is not to feel
what they believe in and focus on is fine with me. I have as much respect for them as they should have for me. In this divided world that is how it has to be. Nevertheless i'm always affected by their bigotry.
Never seize to be amazed by new technology. there's where i truly feel at home in all hypocrisy. I have been tying to find a place where my toughest issues can rest. Now i find a questioning lifestyle to be the very best.

Now burn does the skyline
Soundless wings lacerate the night
Angels of death emerge across the sky
Thorned heads spiky limbs climb the air up high
Attack of the pearly gates
Now wait for the sign
Seen now is His star
Ablaze now risen in
The sign of the one with
A number not a name
Now given is the sign
The Golden walls of heaven
Sound is given now of charge
A voice of war does cry
The cry does sound the signal
And the walls are stormed
Now fly
Swords are drawn in soundless flight
Above the walls of gold
The winged angels of death descend
A thousand from above
Now heaven is in its' last throes of death
Sacred shrine of life and death
Apharamons gold key
The raping of holy interior
And all concealed
Now masturbated upon is throne of gold
Scattered battered wings
Along the palaces and streets
Trophy of the victory
Attached to spear of the Beast
Now spitted at is the scalp of God.[Musica: Eddy Antonini e Roberto Potenti]
[Testi: Eddy Antonini]
Angels cry, demons die
black night comes above my room.
Trying to find a feeling blind
an helping hand to drive my doom.
An iced tear, a little fear
a lonely heart that beats inside.
A simple pray, a mortal race
to win this love to save my pride.
This time I have to remember the meaning of the truth
searching for a shelter where hide my love for you
but looking at the mirror I can only see your face
I'm captured by the darkness while you are walking away.
I'd give my life to find you
to meet and touch your heart
coming out from darkness
but Destiny might tear us apart
I'm dreaming now I hold you
and kiss your lips goodnight
staring at the sweetest
things you've got...Pressing on about our business
Comfort is getting too expensive
Hot shots for the pigeons
With a death sentence
You're something like a pistol
That's been polished bright
But if it never leaves the holster
It can never save your life
I need a meaning I can get behind
To be alone is to be alive
A better message to subscribe to
To be alone is to be alive
Set sun, I'm an hour older
Mile markers punctuate the shoulder
Harboring delusions of grandeur
You're something like a canvas
That's been stretched and primed
You can become something priceless
Or you could be a waste of time
I need a meaning, I can get behind
To be alone is to be alive
A better message to subscribe to
To be alone is to be alive
This is the best time to be alone
To be alone is to be alive
Consider where complaining gets you
To be alone is to be alive
We're living much too
We're living much too comfortably for me
Keep drifting, keep drifting aimlessly
Stay with me, stay with me
We'll stay busy, stay busy
Endless trips to anywhere
To end up where we'll be
I need a meaning, I can get behind
To be alone is to be alive
A better message to subscribe too
To be alone is to be alive
This is the best time to be alone
To be alone is to be alive
Consider where complaining gets you
To be alone is to be aliveIn cover of a dazzling fullmoon
I pace in the hall rendered harmless
By the memory of what I used to be
Night's soon over I dread another sunrise
The pain of knowing I might have changed the world
I couldn't pass with a compromise
But the healing hand belongs to the living
And I am no longer the world will go on without me
I'm no longer
When I leave I'll feel a soft asuagement
And with minimal manliness
I'll bow to hail the light
When night's over
I'll sink into oblivion
But still I will remember
I could have changed the worldSunset, expect
This to be your last with Our vast return
As Death is set
At three sixes where hill-beacons burn
Darkness, undress
Your descending skirts yield a thirsting altar
Blood-red, yet still unfed
Lips distend ending, time to falter
Welcome arms wide and crucified
The slaughter
Lightening freezes seven
Outtakes from the rape of the world
Sins expelled from Heaven
Now befoul from the bowels of Hell
Where the tragic in theory and practice fell
Last prayers, hang in the air
Each unto their own rag and bone meal saviors
Strung where crippled vultures dare
Golgotha
Coughs another cross to grave God's failure
Once the forests spired
Nurtured in Nature'heart
Now dreat cedars feed the pyres
Need-fires lit for greater harm
As Her children toy with razors
Sightless and deeply scarred
And the moon arose to phase Her
Cracks a grin so wide it hides the stars
And lights Our path
Back through the shattered glass
(We come like drumming thunder
Tides enwreathed in scum and plunder
Kraken-teethed to tear asunder
All those too blind to see)
Where the tragic in theory and practice meet
Deranged, uncaged
We rage like a plague through this age of greed
Sowers of discord, growing wars to reap
A terrible crop to beat a vicious retreat
Scorched Earth, rebirth
Disinterred in the writhe of the lone survivor
Whose worth is worse than the curse
Of Sardonicus choking on his own saliva
Who shares the last laugh now
Dead wedded fates fulfill their vows?
Foot in mouth of sacred cows
Face down in dust and poisoned ground(Right!)
(Fire!) the fire is more right than my eyes
Don't remain, go misplay, you're so, so wild
(Traitor!) your vengeance night, yes, always for me
Always now, once you know, widow
(Right!)
(Murder!) your fire murders all my problems
Ah (oh yeah!)
Fire here I see the fire in my heart
Traitor hate your face, obey or you're gonna die
Murder murderer in you call me to die
Oh yeah I'll come back to you when I'm dead
Your voice is getting closer (today fuck every day!)
Sleep up in the night - the Lord doesn't matter in my fight
Widow, tell me the reason
Fire fire is into turning in my heart
Traitor hate your face, obey or you're gonna die
Murder: praying on my knee, I saw her near, come here
Oh yeah I'll come back to you when I'm dead
I'm dead this is all, widowLets take a walk down memory lane
When I was just a boy and I wasn't insane
Back before the world got inside of my heart
Before all the sickness almost tore me apart
Corruption, deception
Natural progression, denial
Was a drug that I couldn't refuse
Now I'm just a puppet
Always sticking to myself here
Blame it on myself
But I know it was you
I know it was you
Here we go again
Like turns, another corner
No way around it
I was born to fall behind
Here I go again
Like sphinx, another loner
No way around it
You will never be my kind
You're not my kind
My dad was a killer, a cold blooded guerilla
Something that I can never perceive
Mom was just a survivor, worked till it broke her
She always landed right on her feet
Rejection, infection
Now in the wrong direction
I'll never walk a day in their shoes
From a child to a leper
Feels like I've been severed
Blame it on the world
Because I know its true
I know its true
Here we go again
Like turns, another corner
No way around it
I was born to fall behind
Here I go again
Like sphinx, another loner
No way around it
You will never be my kind
You're not my kind
HAHAHA
You're not my kind
You're not my kind
You're not my kind
You're not my kind
Here we go again
Like turns, another corner
No way around it
I was born to fall behind
Here I go again
Like sphinx, another loner
No way around it
You will never be my kind
You're not my kind
You're not my kind[Bullet Eater/Warslut]
From the dawn of tim
Man has always sought to allay his fears,
From the demons without and the demons that surely lurk within
"Don't look for a rhyme or a reason to the story
Now is not the time, the season, no glory
Don't look for a moral or right to this tale
Don't look for a saviour for your weak and your frail"
For I am the War God
There are many bridges to be crossed
and many more to burn!
"I would sooner see you dead than hear your poisoned words
Slain upon a battle field, your voice cannot be heard
I would suffer a thousand, a thousand years in silence
My advice to you, is a message in violence."
'cos I am the War God!
"Though the tale is over, the song remains the same
Gods and idealism forever call our name
So we rise upon to the mount with Kings at our Command
To turn the endless cycle of the savage bloody hand"
And it's hard to see into the night, when your eyes are blinded by the light
And it's hard to learn from the past, when the past is a whore to the last
And it's hard to hold back the HateWatch the twilight
Colour the sky
In this monotony of chaos
Insane limbo
Sickening sights
In this garden of dark delights
Lunatic dreams become nightmare reality
Entangled into persistence
No answer to your existence
The curse has come,
We've been waiting all to long
Morbid enlightener of souls
Wandering distant and alone
Deboned and defleshed
Denied is our lives
Enter our graves
Exalted as we die
True hell on earth
Forget the burning heavens
Dedicated
To the lord of living pain
Motherfucker
Who told you hell was warm
Infernal winter
The ninth circle closedMorbid fascination instilled within our young
Raised and weaned on cold steel, the damage it has brung
Little plastic war toys always within reach
Replicas of war, what lessons do they teach
Pre-chorus:
Minimal control, that's why this land is great
Accidental death, the lesson learned too late
Escalating tensions sweeping 'cross our land
A gun beneath your pillow you fail to understand
Images of violence flicker on the screen
Taken in by young eyes unsure of what it means
Violent heritage echoed in their games
Countless shattered lives, no one learns their names
Repeat pre-chorus
Chorus:
Violent by nature (4x)
Solo: Lykins
Children raised on violence, soon no place to run
Setting fights with bullets, the nightmare's just begun
Staring out the window, your child plays with friends
Waving plastic pistols, the circle never ends
Repeat pre-chorus
Repeat chorusThere's no remorse within my soul
And I don't lament pain
In fact I enjoy it...
I was all born in an act of laceration
I feel I must leave a sign of my passage
If they only let me go now
Because I have to follow my fate...
I'm disgraced
We have travelled through chaos
All around there's only misery
Ignorance and sadness, the pastfinder returns...
All around there's only misery, ignorance and sadness, why?
Many signs of the past that I found
Only echoes of triumph and sorrow
Of grief and past joySidelined we are sailing
Beside our fears we are living
Can you hear this monster growing inside your head?
I won't lead the mass disorder before i get the control of minds
On the land of no return they're coming to bind these souls
Eternal vows
They overcome reasoning faculties
I won't decide to release my puppets instead i choose to see
If you say i'm ruthless
I say choose to be
Sidelined we are sailing
Beside our fears we are living
Can you feel this monster growing?
Hear the voice of your serenity
Words redefined
History falsified
Towards slavery
Relentless slavery
Hear the chaos crawling
Has this tragedy reached your ears?
We'll witness the result of our deeds
Let it be decided who is to blame
Hear the chaos crawling
Feel this monster growing
Infamous lies in your earIt never stops raining. With daggers sewn through her heart she cries. Filled with confusion she cries. "No one can help me until I can help myself. And I can't help myself." Frozen throughout, exposing broken skin. One week, one more week. She can't take anymore burning in her mind. "Why can't I sever your head, why can't I sever your memory?" The image burned through her eyes has made it on to the mirror. Broken glass reflecting on the shards of the past. Forcefed memories walking on tacks, please pull the knife fight out of my back and I'll pull the knife out of yours. "You can't stop the rain", she says. "You can't stop the rain".Towers all around us crumbling
They're the monuments we once built
Finding it harder to believe in something greater
Greater than ourselves
Dig deep and you will find it in your soul
The darkness lives within us all
Do you even recognize yourself
IGNORING THE PATH THEY PAVED
OUR FALLEN HEROES
DESTROYING THEIR LIFE IN DAYS
THAT TOOK A LIFETIME
WHEN HEROES DIE
Dig deep and you will find it in your soul
The temptation calls to us all
I saw myself in you
Do I even recognize myself
IGNORING THE PATH THEY PAVED
OUR FALLEN HEROES
DESTROYING THEIR LIFE IN DAYS
THAT TOOK A LIFETIME
WHEN HEROES DIE
The messenger may fall
Their legacy must live on for all to hear
Let it make you strong
Because even our idols fall
IGNORING THE PATH THEY PAVED
OUR FALLEN HEROES
DESTROYING THEIR LIFE IN DAYS
THAT TOOK A LIFETIME
SO LET YOUR HEROES DIE[Cairn Warrior's Appetency of Invultuation:]
I am the one to seek the courtly witch -
She is the one to find me.
I am the one to yearn the dazzling bitch -
She is the one to bind me.
So I say, the spell has begun!
[Tea (Courtly Witch):]
"The darkness is starting and control is done..."
[Cairn Warrior:]
Stones of power inside this sphere
are stark stones of magick -
I am joining the mystic ring,
with this woman, as we implore.
We do implore.
I am aiding the mystic writ;
I am gifted knowledge from deep wells!
[Chorus - Cairn Warrior's First Myaltic Rite:]
Candle of fire, candle of might,
Create my desires here on this night -
This candles stream is suddenly flaming higher!
Bring to me my heart's desire,
My words of strength are suddenly hung,
So I proudly state this spell has begun!
[Cairn Warrior:]
Stones of power within ire
are strong stones of cabal.
I am joined int he magick round,
with this bitch, as we implore.
We shall explore.
With Paralda by my side,
I am granted sylphs and zephyrs!
[Cairn Warrior's Second Myaltic Rite:]
Show me the rings of your cosmic fire,
Make my pathway carved and clear.
Give me a code that's no will of mine,
To show me your presence is here!
[Repeat Cairn Warrior's Second Myaltic Rite]
[Chorus II - Cairn Warrior's Last Myaltic Rite:]
Courtly witch of the beast -
Courtly bitch of the daring arm,
I am your tyro, yet never alarmed!
A dash of thistle, and in my dreams -
Give me the silver-gilt key,
That will unlock the spell...
Courtly witch, assist me!I'm the silence surrounding you
I'm the shadow of no lighting doubt
So start this journey
Come on walk with me
Into the field of screaming souls (of my pain)
I'm the sadness grey as tomb
I'm the desert where all the hopes die
So start this journey
Come on walk with me
Into the field of screaming souls (of my pain)
I'm the sadness grey as tomb
I'm the desert where all the hopes die
In the field of screaming souls
the field - the hopes - the death - she comes
Into the field of screaming souls
I'm the silence surrounding you
I'm the shadow of no lighting doubt
So start this journey
Come on walk with me
Into the field
Into my dreams
Silence
Into this silence come to me
Follow my sign - follow my dreams
In the field of screaming souls
In the field of dying hopes
When my time has come
I'll summon my witch
When the sky will fall
The silence is grey
In the field of screaming souls
In the halls of dying hopes
There's silence
EterallyFraud woven into cloth
Draped upon the have not's.
Tried to secrify, while you close your eyes.
So they continue.same criminal, different venue.
Hide the cardinal file, you lied you pedophile.
You know what you've done, and you know they were molested
Step upon this soul you should most surely be arrested.
Immuned behind the cross.
Innocence of many forever lost.
Rights and privilege, over sacrilege.
Felon for all to see.
Please tell me why this man is walking free?
Fraud upon the cloth, fraud upon the cloth!
You knew all along and you facilitated priests.
A predator, a little child, you hypocrite, you beast!
No other court in the world, would allow any man to escape
The participation and cover up, of a little child who was raped.
Fraudulent, the fraudulent cloth, fraudulent the fraudulent cloth
FRAUD![Music and Lyrics by Marco Kehren/DEINONYCHUS]
"Hello", I said to my last life.
Buried my flesh;
withered and captured in the earth's vault.
The fragrance of my perfume doesn't matter anymore;
life is no more, it's useless this all.
Now, I'm Israfiel.
Walk through me...
The rain are my tears, soaking the earth...
Hollow are my eyes.
Judas said; " A heart never dies"...
Why I don't bleed inside anymore, is it really true that am I no more?
Pain vessels me to my seat, and you said;" I would die for you".
I have spoken all your words as you taught me, and I believed them all!
Now, all you did was say:" I would die for you".Yeah!
I'm leavin' the same way I came in
It's lookin' forward but I can't see straight
It's just like I know where I'm going
It's just like me to fool myself
I'm right here bitch!
Buried by the words of a liar
I'm right here bitch!
But I'm alive and I'm still breathin' yeah
That day, becomes so haunting
You didn't say enough, we were mistaken'
My mind plays it over and over
Slow motion
But we're moving faster, moving faster
So much further
Let's not lose control
Light a match just to watch it burn
Struck
Light a match just to watch you burn
Where are you goin? How far?
Where are you goin?
Let's give them HELL!
That day, becomes so haunting
You didn't say enough, we were mistaken'
My mind plays it over and over
Slow motion
But we're moving faster, moving faster
So much further
Let's not lose control
I'll bite the bullet
Just to save myself Oh!
Oh no, this ship is quickly sinking
We gotta take control, gotta take control
Oh no, this ship is quickly sinking
We gotta take control, gotta take controlTear me apart.
Underwater brilliance super sensory.
Suddenly gone.
My destruction the consequence of lost clarity.
You wonder why.
You use me as sanctuary.
Blaming nature.
Tourist dollar fades away from your economy.
Praising my beauty.
Tear me apart.
Untouched, unspoiled.
Dominant force.
Taken for granted.
Suddenly gone.
Hole in your world.
And you can tell where I once was.
I'm never coming back into this sick world of apathy.
Although it's never caught, the great reef will never be free.
Only living thing visible from space.
Grief barrier.
To let it fade away, a heritage disgrace.
Praising my beauty.
Tear me apart.
Untouched, unspoiled.
Dominant force.
Alive so long.
Taken for granted, no destroyed.
Suddenly gone.
And now you see.
Hole in your world.
And you can tell where I once was.
I'm never coming back into this sick world of apathy.
Although it's never caught, the great reef will never be free.
Vibrant colours turn grey, beauty fading away.
I'm never coming back.
Crystal waters turn black.
How could something so still be something so alive?
Exploit, export and destroy.
Unnatural claiming of rights.
My destruction the consequence of lost clarity.
Grief barrier.Stand up and smoke while I eat
Haven't washed my hair in weeks
Wink at every girl I see
I'm bringin' Dirty Back.
Get so high I can't breathe I'm swearing constantly.
Fuck shit you can suck my dick see it just comes naturally.
We're bringin' Dirty Back.
Do what you want have a little fun.
Go out and caude some shit so I know I'm not the only one
Who never washes jeans. Loves the smell of gasoline.
Down Jack till I fall asleep. We're bringin' dirty back.
Fuck rubbers I think they suck.
I'm not wearing them when we go fuck.
No I didn't call you a slut. Just think you look good on me
Hit the rippers grab some eats.
Downing brews as you shake your cheeks.
Sportin joggers so I get a piece. We're bringin dirty back.
Do what you want have a little fun.
Go out and caude some shit so I know I'm not the only one
Who never washes jeans. Loves the smell of gasoline.
Down Jack till I fall asleep. We're bringin' dirty back.
There's only one thing to remember.
(Hell No!) I won't change a rhinf doe anyone.
(Hell No!) We won't change a thing we're too busy loving it.
(Hell No!) We won't change a thing for anyone.
(Hell No!) We won't change a thing we're too busy loving it.
We're bringin' Dirty Back.
Do what you want have a little fun.
Go out and caude some shit so I know I'm not the only one
Who never washes jeans. Loves the smell of gasoline.
Down Jack till I fall asleep. We're bringin' dirty back.
We're bringin' Dirty Back. We're Bringin' Dirty Back.
Dirty's Back.His hands hide inside a sleeve
And little feet play with the ground
beneath him
While up in the sky is where he wants to be
Time will fly
And the wind plays with him
The night will give him its charm
While he walks home
His head's up in a cloud
He feels his pores fill up with fresh air
And there's no doubt
That one day he will be
Where the eye of his telescope has already been
Night will pass
But he's a lot faster
No one can do him any harmEverything in time
Set your eyes upon the shallow surface
Hollow out your mind
How divine, you disengage your self
Tell me
Tell me of your consolation
Tell me
I am lost in the gray
Tell me that your final home is not a...
A shot in the dark
Tell me that your hopes and dreams don't end in the heart
Of a graveyard
Set aside your soul
Let tomorrow realize itself
Tell me
Tell me of your consolation
Tell me
I am lost in the gray
Tell me that your final home is not a...
A shot in the dark
Tell me that your hopes and dreams don't end in the heart
Of a graveyard
Brace for the ending
You may not see
Will you stop descending
Six shallow feet
Tell me
Tell me of your consolation
Tell me
I am lost in the gray
Tell me that your final home is not a...
A shot in the dark
Tell me that your hopes and dreams don't end in the heart
Of a graveyard[instrumental]Keep up [x8]
[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
Drippin blood, droolin necks
Hangin' upside down tied ankles and wrists
No evidence no forensics left
Chase me all ya want there's only one judge after my death
Sure as fuck ain't you or your gavels
I'm packin my bags for my Canadian travels
I pull that rope and fire open slit curtains
I'll be welcomed through that mother fucker for certain
[Monoxide Child:]
My eyes are closed hypnotized by professionals
Searchin' for mental confessionals
Twist and curled inside lookin' for answers
To why I've become such a cancer
I keep the answer in a place so hard to find
That the only way you can enter is manipulating my mind
Many have tried they get chased there and died
And it happens every time our words collide
[Chorus:]
Running through the fire
Daring you to follow me
Running through the fire
Daring you to follow me
Keep up [x8]
Running through the fire
Daring you to follow me
Running through the fire
Daring you to follow me
[Jamie Madrox:]
I'm runnin' through the fire like I'm made of asbestos
They think I'm turnin' evil 'cause I'm past repentance
I'm livin' like a convict without no sins
I'm hot like the Human Torch without no question
Catch up if you can, if you can't stand the heat
'Cause it's comin' out the kitchen givin' burns 3rd degree
Get you ace bandages and alo vera for the barbeque
The closer to the Lotus and fire becomes a part of you
[Violent J:]
Keep up, walk with me through flames
Top that and take a stroll in black rain
I stepped into the mirror and I offed my reflection
'Cause I'm a one of a kind, no exceptions
Follow me and see the world we roam
Through an Opaque prism or not and stay a clone
We bloom, 5 pedals of the Lotus plant
Keep up, unless you can't
[Chorus:]
Running through the fire
Daring you to follow me
Running through the fire
Daring you to follow me
Keep up [x8]
Running through the fire
Daring you to follow me
Running through the fire
Daring you to follow me
[Blaze Ya Dead Homie:]
I move with such force
Unabided by a cross
Cross dimensional gateways just for sport
Jump into a mind bend once I am inside
Destroy clearer life and balances intertwined
The pain forever lingers on like a stain
Or the stench of my last friend lost to the row again
Goin' to the next victim without a sign
You can search your whole life for someone you'll never find
[All members:]
Follow us keep up
As we wind and turn and spiral on
Under and above water
Unphased by all elements
Ice, fire, earth, and air
Our final location, the underground
Deep, deep underground
We plant our seeds for tomorrow's resurrection
Of the never ending DARK LOTUS
[Chorus x2]
Running through the fire
Daring you to follow me
Running through the fire
Daring you to follow me
Keep up [x8]
Running through the fire
Daring you to follow me
Running through the fire
Daring you to follow meLife has passed us by
as though time was standing still
An endless era like the melting snow
Fifty years have gone by
but not a day will pass
To remind us of the pain
I'm lost in thought and my body is standing still
Now glancing into darkened state of mind
Memories from the inner self
The threads of life that bound me were
severed long ago
[Pre chorus]
In a time when all was chaos and the truth
Would lie the world saw lost corrupted minds
[Chorus]
We are searching for a world of change
Conflicts divide and they unite
Fall of the Reich
When a nation is united and the people are as one
Fall of the Reich
Throughout the ages the stories have been told
Visionary madman who have tried
to rule the world
Manipulate the masses to reform their ways
They'll rebel against the call
[Solo]
[Pre chorus]
[Chorus]There is a serpent in every Eden
Slick as grease and cold as ice
There is a lie in every meaning
Rest assured to fool you twice
In this age of utter madness
We maintain we are in control
And ending life before deliverance
While countries are both bought and sold
Holy writings hokus-pokus
Blaze of glory and crucifix
Prepried costly credit salvation's
TV-preachers and dirty tricks
Don't trust nobody
It will cost you much too much
Beware of the dagger
It caress you at first touch
O, all small creatures
It is the twilight if the gods
When the foundations to our existence
Begins to crumble one by one
And legislation protects its breakers
And he who was wrong but paid the most won
Even the gods of countless religions
Holds no powers against this tide
Of degeneration because we have now found
That there is no thrones up there in the sky
Run from this fire
It will burn your very soul
Its flames reaching higher
Came this far there is no hold
Oh, all small creatures
It is the twilight if the gods
(Twilight of the gods) [Repeat: x3][music by Aphazel, Lyrics by Grimm]

Sharing the life of the mad and insane
I'm closing my eyes in awe of the scenes
I cover my ears in fear of their screams
And I'm waiting
The days does not end and so does the night
That covers the streets in darkness and fright
I'm staying awake while the city sleeps
Watching the low life, the pimps and the creeps
And I'm waiting
Waiting in vain
And I'm waiting
For the cleansing rain
And I'm praying
Praying in vain
And I'm praying
For the cleansing rainI just left my house in the old tree
To hide in a place down under the earth
If ever they find the entry
They will reach my shelter7. Portent

Don't look at me that way
Don't put me to the test
When I first saw you
People said:
"He scrutinised a little monster"
And disappeared through red door [or dawn?]
Now everyone is disinformation
Disinformation
Disinformation
He says:
"Won't you give me one more chance?"
"I'm not a communist"
Disinformation x 3
[Mecass, the mass, decline, domain, relan, drazan, my heart's blocked, rout]
Oh! little brother
We are in a mess
Don't look at me that way
Your reject is a mess
There's always
Someone beside you
And there's always
Someone in your arms
Oh! little brother
If only I had known
Then I might not
Be alone X4So I once rode
with sword and shield
the path of my fate
destiny
upwards the rock of eternity
with a countenance
stiff from pain
the summit seems far
yet is it
no severe ride
The weaker I get, the louder my end's
shouts grow
The brave nag trotting
leads me
of this life, but
where then to?
The blood we let, makes our path
divineYou corrupt, You enslave
Enforced taboos, to the grave
Make me right, to fit your mould
Make me right, like your moral code
You distort, You destroy
You own, You lie
Make us follow, like the sheep we are
Make us follow, we need to believeYo Moose, stop the car right here.
Alright, give it here, give it here.
No man let me do it, cool ice.
Stay in the car man, stay in the car. Stay in the car.
Uh, hi officers, um, we had a flat tire back there.
Do you think you guys could help us out?
"Naw, that's not my job. My job's not to help your fuckin' ass out."
I mean, um, you know I don't have any other way to get home.
"That's not my job, asshole."
Well uh, could you tell me what your job is?
"Right now my job is eatin' these doughnuts, or maybe...
hey, wait a minute. Aren't you..."
Yup.A relapse of my body
Sends my mind into multiple seizures
Psychologically a new human being
One that has never been
Cursed by the shamen
his voodoo spell has my soul
My limbs
go numb
I can't control my own thought
Are his now
his evil consuming me
ever telling me
begin the clit carving
Slowly turning me, into a flesh eating zombie
Knowing this spell can only be broken
by the vaginal skins of young women
I proceed to find the meat
their bleeding cunts will set me free
Warmth seeping from this
Body
Rotted
After I sucked the blood from her ass
I feel more alive
more alive than I've ever been
Even though now I'm dead within
My mouth drools
As I slice your perinium
My body smeared
With the guts I've extracted
through her hole, came swollen organs
cunnilingus with the mutilated
My spirit returned from the dead
Released by the priest
but I felt more real
when I was dead
The curse is broken
I have a dependence on vaginal skin
It's become my sexual addiction
I must slit, the twitching clit
Rotted cavity hold the juice
Between the legs, I love to carve
My cock is dripping with her bloodI believe in my conscience
I obey that inner feeling
I get scarred emotions
When I try to find your inner heart
The rulers are no real kings
I believe in my instincts
Yeah, I do... and I know it's true
That inner feeling
Don't ask me how I know the way
To your inner heart
Can't you hear me?
I said rulers are no real kings
I search inside...
I though the true thoughts in my kingdom
were my own
I thought the throne was all mine
We share the light
When the sun beats down
On a Winter's day
(It blows me away)
I like the way that the sun shines down on us, yeah
The rulers are no real kings
I believe!!!Across the lake of fire through the desserts of decay
The flames are burning higher
In this land of death you're easy prey
Black earth
Save our souls
Black earth
Save our souls
Looking back in anger at the twentieth century
Tormented we surrender in artificial serenity
Twisted, torn and burnt violation of the crust
Man got what man deserved
Turned the future into dust
Black earth
Save our souls
Black earth
Save our souls
A millenarian failure the dark age has returned
Waiting for a miracle to save the common herd
In a century of darkness the horror spreads within
As our planet stops to turn all hope is lost for man
Black earth
Save our souls
Black earth
Save our soulsNeedles piercing my frame from all directions
Body thrashing, head collapsing, pressure building
Paralyzing fear and helplessness like nothing seen before
All my life passes by in a tiny flicker
Was it real, all I feel, or all I felt is changing fast
Faster, faster, pulling me down pushing me up all at once
Vision accelerated one million fold
I see all my father's dreams
My mother dying in a cave
My body growing, my mind expanding
Too much knowledge, not enough knowledge
Brought to bear, the truths surrounding the soul
A destiny presented itself to me
No thought is necessary now
I will go to this earthly place to gain unearthly strengthIn through the out door
Out through the in
No matter what you do
It'll make your head spin
Make your head spin
Round and round your head goes
When it stops you'll never know
It's hard to sleep at night
When there's things to do
You could almost die of fright
To yourself be true
Face pull
I always worry
Face pull
I'm in a hurry
I try to do it right
Do it my own way
Learn from mistakes
And you know you're here to stay
Here to stay
Back and forth and up and down
You won't turn me around
It's hard to sleep at night
You do what you must do
It will take all your might
To yourself be true
Face pull
I'm in a hurry
Face pull
I always worry
Face pull
I'm in a hurry
Face pull[Fiend]
Remindin you bitches of who the baddest
Remindin you bitches of who the baddest
Remindin you bitches of who the baddest
Ahhhhhh, all about the beats, cause I bring the heat to the streets
About to act bad, and I ain't been home for a week
I want to see ends, I also want to see ends meet
The last high that I had was the jailhouse heat
Gotta go 223, that's the waiting in the shade
a lot of people about to end up dead, runnin around with their lead
Being followed by the nigga hating feds
I had to ask them, what's that in your hand, all I said
Picture Fiend with this, they made me do it my friend
And I make em see it end, 'fore you bout to take me in
See shit spin, I'm tryin to get the crack in the day
Word on the streets, you really got it happenin your way
Now I'm rapping away, but not to keep me out the penn
But since I'm out, I'm out to test the hearts of men
See this wimpy grin, it mean, one seven he die
With cabbage aside, you bitches still gonna be the baddest alive
Chorus
Still the baddest motherfucker alive
I'm still the baddest motherfucker alive
Say what, say what? x4
My name is Fiend, damn right I'm a attack his trailer
see told me look a man in the eyes 'fore you kill him
ain't too many niggas really got on the billing
To better pockets, ready for some violent killing
Now ready puff in the cutlass, at the down south buck it
Taking other peoples shit, loving every minute of it
You know what it takes to go against odds
Watching my back, with some niggas like Keke and Boz
Jump in my 81 ride, lookin for prey in the meal
Gimme everything, I'll see if this tank is for real
I dish this raw deals to keep this ghetto peal
I think I truly love ?????????
For somebody getting through me
My hunger make sure ain't no human being at the war place speak
Alone at street stories and ties
And remember, no sleepy eyes, I'm the baddest alive(Over The Moonless Depths Of Night-Dark Seas)
THE LOG OF THE NORTHERN MARINER:
The great serpent-prow of my ship, Wave-Render cleaves the nighted
waters as we voyage across the dark, icy sea, towards the unknown...
Above, the brigth winter's moon emerges from a veil of cloud to cast
its lucent rays upon us, and a clinging, supine sea-mist writhers upon
the midnight waves, swirled by the colol, whispering wind which
catches our great sail, pushing us onwards, vever onwards... And
beyond the tang of the darkling sea, the scent of nights is as strong
and heady as summer blossom. I know not what awaits us at the elder
Isle of Mists... that grim and mistery-haunted place which beckons me
to its shadowed embrace, swathed in dark legendry and etwined in the
mantle of ancient sorceries... and yet I must hearken to its ethereal
call... for mayhap the gods have decreed this to be my final voyage...from hero to subzero

Cannot close our eyes
Construction paper traffic corner office destruction
The cityscape burns brighter by the hour
Clock tower: bring us all down
Marching like ants to the foundation of a higher form
Trash. Capped and smothered

Wrinkle-free clients of doom
Feed me fear (informal gluttony)
Construction paper lawns force-fed attention grabber

First come first serve
The all you can eat trumpet, playing the tunes of our death
Breathe, now blow
Now blow
Let it be heard
The preacher's talent is going through the airwaves
(I need to be led in the right direction. Set up the bumpers
Running in the gutter)
The little kids taught me well
but I wonder why they don't listen anymore
(It's a television nightmare)
Eat and watch, eat eat eat, what they feed
Corner office tubes, give me the best view in the hut
Feed me fear (informal gluttony)Let me stay here by your side
Be one with you my precious child
Let me cover your bed with tears
I will save you from all fears
I burn the candles for your soul
I sing you prayers as the preacher told
I bring you flowers, I dress in black
Though I know this cannot give you back
[Chorus]
I sleep by your shadow
Remembering your light
In my heart
I'm with you every night
Far goes your journey
Into the unknown
Wherever you might be
Be well my son
Why just you my flesh and blood
I cannot live nor understand
My dearest treasure to be found
Six feet under in sacred ground
Watch me bleed you lucky ones
I envy you your living sons
I'll give mine the strength of my faithful breath
I will mourn him to my death
[Chorus]
Rest in peace
Let me stay here by your side
Be one with you my precious child
Let me cover your bed with tears
I will save you from all fears
I burn the candles for your soul
I sing you prayers as the preacher told
I bring you flowers, I dress in black
Though I know this cannot give you back
[Chorus]Only one step away from the core
One tiny step to purge the soul
One more vision to shatter
Oh, come sweet dreams
Sweet illusions of a bleak
I see the vipers in the distance
as they come to feed me.
How I long for you, For the fever of your embrace
For the taste of desire
An endless shroud of agony
But still I wallow in its eternity
I see the vipers in the distance
as they come to feed me.
I never reckoned today could bear a light
As I awoke this morning it felt as any other night.
I sense your presence close to me
and every fiber of my feverish body
feeds on your raving shine.
I never reckoned today could bear a light
As I awoke this morning it felt as any other night.
Torments of Soul released in an instant
A breath with the lungs of a torn
And the heart of an infant.	What a content sentiment it was
To lay beside her, her sweet caress.
"How I longed for you,
For the fever of your embrace
For the taste of desire"
An endless shroud of agony
But still I wallow in its eternity
I see the vipers in the distance
as they come to feed me.
Another night has settled, another day had passed
Another cry I spilled, another tear at night.
"This is the long way down to Eden"
I heared her say when she left,"
But what is the way,
what must I know before to walk it?"
"That nothing is certain, but uncertainty!".
I never reckoned today could bear a light
As I awoke this morning it felt as any other night.
I sense your presence close to me
and every fiber of my feverish body
feeds on your raving shine.
I never reckoned today could bear a light
As I awoke this morning it felt as any other night.Imagine everything well see, the air is good here, come with me, the weight of my teardrops fragily
As the condensation drips from my drink, it makes me stop, it makes me think, about us together,
the time we ran through the rainy weather
The closer here, the further away, Ill meet you here again some day
The more I miss you, the more Ill say
The lovely hours pass and fade, I really thought we had it made, where have these times gone?
Time goes on
We could fight crime, but take our time, we got in trouble, but stayed in line
I could tell it was destiny with your hand in mine
The rusted busted guitar strings splinter, my heart is yours, yes you can enter
Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter[Chorus]
One dream in all of us still shining,
One star, the ever lasting light,
So alone, so lost inside, to the ending paradise,
United, victorious, the hearts of our nation tonight.
In the dark December morning light,
Far strong to the burning winds, the fires of Hell will forsake me,
Shattering the chains that ever bind us,
Suffering their pain eternally.
For strong, smash the silence, carry on like before,
Fires burn, still we battle, lost so far away,
Storm with hail fire raging, sun shines down as they kneel,
Lost in times and long forgotten, governing miles away.
Tears fall inside the dream, our last days gone by,
Still alive we feel the pain tonight,
Stars fall through blackened clouds, and dreams that miss rains,
A twilight star in the thousand lights for me.
[Chorus]
And still we save a breath for the world,
Life brings up for us all,
United, victorious, the hearts of our nation tonight.
One dream in all of us still shining,
One star, the ever lasting light
[Chorus]
And still we save a breath for the world,
Life brings up for us all,
United, victorious, the hearts of our nation tonight. [Repeat: x2]We all once in a while
wonder where our lives
taking us and where we're going
I've reached a certain point
Realized I don't
know what the hell I am doing
Am I born to walk alone
Through the fire and the storm
pushing myself to the limit
Was it meant to be this way
spending my days, all on my own
I'm still the man I used to be
just slightly matured and wise
I lately have realized!
I don't want to be alone anymore
I want someone by my side
Someone to give me unconditional love
Of this life I am so tired
I want to be alive
Want to have a life - different than how I am living
don't want to settle down
Want to be around
When and where ever I'm needed
Am I born to walk alone
Through the fire and the storm
I can't control what I'm feeling
if I walk against the wind
Torn up within will it pay off
I'm still the man I used to be
just slightly matured and wise
I lately have realized!
I don't want to be alone anymore
I want someone by my side
Someone to give me unconditional love
Of this life I am so tired
So tired - of fighting battles on my own
So tired - I've worked fingers to the bone
So tired -Of being a loner alone!
I don't want to be alone anymore
I want someone by my side
Someone who give me unconditional love
Of this life I am so tired
I don't want to be alone anymore
I want someone by my side
Someone who give me unconditional love
Of this life I am so tired
So tired!Don't look around, I tell you what you will see
There's only dirt everywhere
Step with my feet in puddles of acid rain
I cannot bear
Running around in a polluted world - it's such a drag
Taking a breath of this toxic air - I'm frekin' out
Hiding behind these walls every day - upset my mind
Cannot believe, it's getting worse - no solution in sight
I'm so fuckin' bored, can't stand it
I can't think of things to do
Only I know it's no pleasure
Expectations won't come true
Sick of this, I don't wanna go out
Too many people, much too many around
Heat gets stronger - better leave a last sigh
Fear the future 'cause a nuclear plant won't last for long
Spit on those who tell me that it makes sense
and that I'm wrong
Running around in a polluted world it's such a drag
Taking a breath of this toxic air -
I'm frekin' out
I'm so fuckin' bored
This world os passing awayFly away. Fly with broken wings my angel
Never stay leave the cold leave the sorrow
Hold on (hold on) even if your world's colliding
Dream on (dream on) no one can take your breath you're winding
And I know when you're free, you will see
All is gone, when you're drifting away
Take your time everything will be fine
On your own till the end of the day
Oh, oh, when all is said and done
Oh, oh from the day that you begun
When all is said and done
Drift away you feel you don't belong to someone
Never pray don't trust a false messiah
Keep on even when your world is burning
Carry on days of defiance you are yearning
And I know when you're free, you will see
All is gone, when you're drifting away
Take your time everything will be fine
On your own till the end of the day
Oh, oh, when all is said and done
Oh, oh you've only just begun
Oh, oh, when all is said and done
Oh, oh, don't stay just hit and run
Oh, oh, when all is said and done
Oh, oh you've only just begun
Oh, oh, when all is said and done
Oh, oh, don't stay just hit and run
When all is said and done
Hold on, dream on, carry onGold fever in the city
I filled my pockets full
I stuffed myself completely
I'm looking like a wool f
I loaded all the bags
Now I need t oget them move
The car is loaded to the max
That's all that I could do!
Working as gard as I could
Digging in a diamond mine
I filled my whole ass full
Taking as much as I could find
I threw them in a bag
I am gragging it like an ox
The basement has been filled up
That's all that I could do!
Digging in a diamond mine
I cross the final line
Digging in a diamond mine
Digging on, digging on! ...uuu...
I'm digging on...
Digging in a diamond mine
Digging on, digging on! ...uuu...
I'm digging on...
Digging in a diamond mine
I fell so fine
I cross the final line
I cross the final line
Silver fever in the village
People's heads are coming off
And I know where and what
And I won't tell anyone
They are digging like mad
Wondering, searching, swearing
And I filled up the chest
And that's all they saw of me!
Diggind in a diamond mine
I cross the final line
Digging in a diamond mine
Digging on, digging on! ...uuu...
I'm digging on...
Digging in a diamond mine
Digging on, digging on! ...uuu...
I'm digging on...
Digging in a diamond mine
I fell so fine
I cross the final line
I cross the final lineAppearance is deceptive
So perfect in disguise
There's more than what you see
A semblance is protective
A blinder for the eyes
A place to hide and flee
Flee and you'll never see
What you're going to be
If you throw away the key
The truth from the past you can't make it last
Flee and walk away
From what you are this day
If you are afraid to stay
Beyond the shore the sea is filled up
with sentiment and strength
Here lie the thoughts imprisoned
A field of forces and laments
How can we hide here
We need to change our ways
How can we tell lies here
We turn our eyes away
From the truth
From the past
You cannot
Make it last
If you do not cease to run away from truth
You will never see the shadow
of your dying youth
A faade is what we all possess
But on the inside it stays a mess
Superficial changes won't recall the past
Don't deny the clock is ticking
and it's racing fast
Fading tokens of our latter days
Make us think we need to change our ways
Deep, the feelings hide
They're wasted from within
And my shell will never break
Appearance is deceptive
So perfect in disguise
A place to flee and hide and run away
Lift the shadowAwake, the whole world hates me
Awake, the whole world denies me
Morning captures me totally unaware
I'm off the edge today, am I not
I'm off the world today, am I not
Night grabs me totally aware
No one has brought me here
I have not been gone so long
No one will take me there, I haven't got no choice
Who's digging the ground in the depths
Who's digging my holes to be
Morning, alright is it not
Night for the living, am I here
In between where can it be now
What do you get from this light
All time, no where, anywhere, no
Who are you really, where do you hide
BEHOLD, I AM ALIVE ETERNALLY
THEY ARE WAITING TO TAKE US
TAKE US INTO THE GARDEN OF DEPTHS
BEHOLD, I AM DEAD FOREVER
why?
BEHOLD, I AM ALIVE ETERNALLY
THEY ARE WAITING TO TAKE US
TAKE US INTO THE GARDEN OF DEPTHS
BEHOLD, I AM DEAD FOREVER
THEY ARE WAITING TO TAKE US!There's an evil virus that's threatening mankind
Not state of the art, a serious state of the mind
The muggers, the backstabbers, the two faced elite
A menace to society, a social disease
Rape of the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy one-upmanship order
Watching beginnings of social decay
Gloating or sneering at life's disarray
Eating away at your own self esteem
Pouncing on every word that you might be saying
Rape of the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy one-upmanship order
Superficially smiling a shake of the hand
As soon as the back is turned treachery is planned
Rape of the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy one-upmanship order
Watching beginnings of social decay
Gloating or sneering... at life's disarray
When every good thing's laid to waste
By all the jealousy and hate
By all the acid wit and rapier lies
And every time you think you're safe
And when you go to turn away
You know they're sharpening all their paper knives
All in your mind
All in your head
Try to relate it
All in your mind
All in your head
Try to escape it
Without a conscience they destroy
And that's a thing that they enjoy
They're a sickness that's in all our minds
They want to sink the ship and leave
The way they laugh at you and me
You know it happens all the time
All in your mind
All in your head
Try to relate it
All in your mind
All in your head
Try to escape it
The rats in the cellar you know who you are
The rats in the cellar you know who you are
The rats in the cellar you know who you are
The rats in the cellar you know who you are
Or do you?
Or do you?
Or do you?
Or do you?
Watching beginnings of social decay...Rain falls for delusions of loneliness.
Alone in the rain,quietly dying.
What's left to build that still remains,
when my eyes are covered in black torment.
Two years of fucking torture,
I questioned my importance.
Never forget.
Never agin, never forget.
Forget this, forget my face.
Never forget, never again.
Forget this.
Forget my face.
Take the two seconds to immortality.
I'll never forget this cold stare.
I hope you're fucking choking.
Now I'll bring you back to my world.
Scratch and cry out for suffering.
Wither deep inside of me now.
Never again, forget my face, forget my face.
Wither deep inside of me now.
Never again, never forget.
Forget this, forget my face.Now as the Night takes form upon the face of sun
and new shadows appear upon the lone, phantasmagoric sky
a world, hidden and arcane, arise
from cryptical depths, hinderless and stark
One with night's perplexed mystery
unrevealed by the scyhted moon's light
phantoms of times remote gather
beneath the bizzare, livid sky
Behold this darkling realm
filled with mysteries of aeons bygone
Step inside the darkness that lays bare the secret spheres
of the dream-woven sisterworld
Beyond these phantasm-guarded gates
where gyving Time and Space are not
awaits a world ulterior, a realm unexplored
large as Infinity
Now as the Night takes form upon the face of sun
and new shadows appear upon the lone, phantasmagoric sky
a world, hidden and arcane, arise
from cryptical depths, hinderless and stark
Behold, this is a stranger earth,
a moonlight-drenched, enchanted land
a world wherein all the cares of life are forgot
a long-sought realm of wonderTrapped beneath rotting remains
A slow decay of life takes its form
Withered death and bone emerge
From cemeteries of the earth
Replacing all that is known from this world
Towering structures take shape
As more cities are laid to waste
Survivors of this morbid fate
The reborn meek not live not dead
Are left to start a new
Misshapen and half mutated
Not a zombie not a human
Evil creatures grew
Not one thing left alive but them
The strongest will begin to reign
A new society takes place
Where the way of the cannibal
Rules in this skeletal domain
A kingdom of the damned
Carnal war consuming them by
Eating flesh for nourishment
Solution for a short-term survival
Slaughtered are the weakest first
Feeding those with evil thirst
As blood of the dead saturates the ground
Again the end has begun
Another kingdom will be damned
Survivors of this morbid fate
The reborn meek not live not dead
Are left to start a new
Misshapen and half mutated
Not a zombie not a human
Evil creatures grew
Not one thing left alive but them
The strongest will begin to reign
A new society takes place
Where the way of the cannibal
Rules in this skeletal domain
Survivors of this morbid fate
The reborn meek not live not dead
Are left to start a new
Misshapen and half mutated
Not a zombie not a human
Evil creatures grew
Not one thing left alive but them
The strongest will begin to reign
A new society takes place
Where the way of the cannibal
Rules in this skeletal domainis there a place?
where we can find ourselves
in the way
that we want to be
a place of happyness
extasy and pleasure
or it's (only) our fate to die in hate
I saw last night
a shining blast in front of my eyes
but (who knows why) I didn't wanted to discover
what is hiding on the other side
(fuck, maybe it was even worse there)I have got secrets, but no one to share them with
They might go away if you don't let me in
Sober and speechless, alone on the floor again
It's been so long, where to begin
Head down, rise up, breathe in, let go and smile
Don't let it tear you up inside
We're bound to fall
Keep climbing and find a place to dive
Above them all
Scheme on you schemers, dream on like the dreamers of old
We're not getting lost in what could've been
Head down, rise up, breathe in, let go and smile
Don't let it tear you up inside
We're bound to fall
Keep climbing and find a place to dive
Above them allI hear The Storm calling my name
The ancient call of the blood in my veins
My father's voice screams from the grave
It's the sign that my fate is at hand
These ancient halls have seen Emperors born, rule and die
From my Ruby Throne I rise when it's time to fulfil my destiny
[Chorus]
Last Of The Dragonlords of Melnibone
Born to rule 'til the End of Time
Last Of The Dragonlords of Melnibone
Born to rule the Kingdom where Mighty Dragons fly so high
[Solos]
[Chorus]
Last Of The Dragonlords of Melnibone
Born to rule the Kingdom where Mighty Dragons fly so highPassage through time
Leave this place time to erase
My link to myself
Leads me astray
The whole world in my way
Out of my body, out of my mind
Out of luck and out of time
Sift through the remains
Enter this cage-disengage
Once it was easy
My best foot forward
As I trip through the same daily non-existing life I call hell
Bloodless, pale
Another empty shell
Captured mind details
As I loath myself
Can't you see, can't you tell
Safely assumed, I'm not well
Cradle me now, teach me how
Teach me how, cradle me now
Make life not your victim
Resume your identity but don't overload
Seek the riches
Hungry for change, I've got to explore
Hidden recesses, lost in my mind
Trapped forever doing time
Bloodless, pale
Another empty shell
Captured mind details
As I loath myself
Can't you see, can't you tell
Safely assumed, I'm not well
Cradle me now, teach me how
Teach me how, cradle me now
Bloodless, pale
Another empty shell
Captured mind details
As I loath myself
Can't you see, can't you tell
Safely assumed, I'm not well
Cradle me now, teach me how
Teach me how, cradle me now
Bloodless, pale
Another empty shell
Captured mind details
As I loath myself
Can't you see, can't you tell
Safely assumed, I'm not well
Cradle me now, teach me how
Teach me how, cradle me nowYou let me down again
And then your goth, slag brain says

Once again waiting for the darkness, beat up
spun and scarred. Preparing for another war.
Day by day we decay. Sunlight, get out of our way.
Dig up yourself from your grave.
Bad to the bone, raised in the gutter,
Not exactly a muthafucking role model.
To you looking down on me.
FUCK YOU BITCH!
Ain't got time for the future or the past.
Live for the moment, make it last.
As long as the twilight veils
The decadence we embrace
More than the ones we love.
We're ardent, we're burning down...
CHORUS:
Not afraid of crying, sorrow and foe.
Not afraid of falling down below.
To the night recklessly we fly.
Like living dead, we'll never die
Stalling the sandman, fighting back
drinking like a madman, run away from the light to come.
SHIT FALLS DOWN!
Sun comes up shining bright
Time to close your eyes..
CHORUS:
Not afraid of crying, sorrow and foe.
Not afraid of falling down below.
To the night recklessly we fly.
Like living dead, we'll never die
As long as the twilight veils
The decadence we embrace
More than the ones we love.
We're ardent, we're burning down...
CHORUS:
Not afraid of crying, sorrow and foe.
Not afraid of falling down below.
To the night recklessly we fly.
Like living dead, we'll never dieStefan were on duty when the telephone ringed. Ambulance was needed. Someone
got run over. Stefan has been ambulance driver for 17 years. Never once has he
made any mistake. He got quickly to the place of incident. A young kid lied
under the wheel of a bus. His right leg lied 5 meters farther. It was an
unpleasant scene. The kid was still alive, though. He got carried over to the
ambulance very quick. Every minute was important. Stefan started the engine in
a hurry. He made too much of being privileged on the road. He didn't manage to
stop the ambulance at the cross-roads. Driving 95 km/h he clashed together
with a truck going from the opposite side. The ambulance got crushed. Stefan's
cranium, spine and ribs lie all around now. His intestines are too sticky and
thin to flow out of the driver's cabin. Stretcher splitted into pieces and
pierced the young kid's larynx.Bang your head against the stage like you never did before
We will burn this town tonight, to deadly metal we want bang
Headbanging is the sense of life, we play it hard and loud
Blood is running fast tonight because future there's no more
Bang bang it must never end
This way is our only chance
Die in blood and pain tonight
Never ends the metal fight
Thrash till death
We were born to sacrifice your souls to bloody metal
Death is behind us all, lose the fear of killin' hard
Metal is the only aim you have to live your life for
Thrash until you are knocked down, metal is your last resortI've said goodbye to the light.
I've seen my last sunrise.
I've gone through the mortal death.
I'm a spirit of supernatural flesh.
I've lived to see
more than man can bear.
I've experienced moments
wich are lost in time.
I'm followed by fear!
Demolition time is here!
I've wandered through centuries.
I've seen times changing.
I've seen kings and queens.
I've seend unvaluable wealth.
I'm living to quench my thirst.
I'm searching in the slumbering dark.
Most people don't belive in my exictence.
but still I'm followed by fear.
I'm followed by Fear!
Demolition time is here!So much for breathing, my cloud nine fell from grace. Loss of everything, where is my identity?. If I could only find what is left me. So much for letting go when you have nothing left to hold. The words that slid off your tongue, my everything. Your nothing, I know that I don't mean much to you but you mean the world to me. Devotion, an undying dead. The harrowing, bleed you out of me, the "he said, she said" falsity. Leave it be, I just want to go home. So much for letting go. I won't be dying with me, no not this time. Becoming by undoing him. Sacrifice, the ultimate devotion. So much for saving yourself. It can never be love. I can never be sold like the blood they call love. I am a stranger. I will not, I have not, I can never be like him.Pregnant for nine weeks
By rape or promiscuity
Life is growing inside
Although it is not wanted
Life becomes hell
Days are passing slowly
Suicide will be sure
If abortion can't be practised
Tissue is carved and bleeds
The foetus is now executed
It's vacuumed from the womb
Birth will not be given
Tissue is carved and bleeds
The foetus is now executed
It's vacuumed from the womb
Birth will not be given
What's the right of the unborn child
When it will destroy its mother's life?
None!!!
Friends are no help
Their opinion is formed by others
Their religion says you're a whore
Your son is a condemned bastard
Tissue is carved and bleeds
The foetus is now executed
It's vacuumed from the womb
Birth will not be givenAlma perdida no puedes seguir
llorando as por un sueo
la libertad de poder elegir
disfrutando el momento y seguir.
Arrodillada pidiendo dolor
toda tu vida desangra
y tu preciosa mirada que hoy
el odio encarna.
Si tu mirada no puede encerrar
lo que en tu espritu late
nada ni nadie podr desatar
ese nudo que te ate y llegar.
El fondo dolido de tu corazn
hace del mundo un tormento
y en la frontera de toda razn
se vuelve atento.
A mirar hacia el cielo y su creador
Porque sabe que lleg la hora del dolor.
Y as el odio dir, es tiempo de acciones
corran por su vida hoy, pues l llegar
montado en la cima de sus legiones
justo y pecador, el final llegar.
A mirar hacia el cielo y su creador
Porque sabe que lleg la hora del dolor.
Y as el odio dir, es tiempo de acciones
corran por su vida hoy, pues l llegar
montado en la cima de sus legiones
justo y pecador, el final llegar.
El final ya est aqu para alejar temores
y fue su corazn el que lo llam
alma perdida, hace su camino
ya sin importar el dolor que caus.I ride the psycho path in pain
Into the foreign shores
I'll never walk again
Just call my name and I will be your enemy
Just call my name and I won't be answering
I will be your enemy until the darkness fall
Blinded by the morning light
I'm not afraid to die
Eat my flesh and drink my soul
it's no use holding on
Feed my dreams with your own soil
Let me feel your pain
Come watch the acid sights I see
Crawling up towards me
The gods and demons serve me well
though I can't tell
Do they want me well?
I ride the psycho path to gain
The power that the sane never will obtain
Just call my name then I will be your enemy
Just call my name and I will be insaneHear me
I am the crown for the morbid
The fire in the eyes of the rabid
I am the hate inside the psychotic
And the fear consuming the phobic
I seek to overthrow you
With the powers given to me
By your own weak mind
That turned on you today
I am the worst of intentions
That dwells inside you all
I am the instinct never mentioned
That makes humanity fall
I am the swine devouring pearls
Right before your coward eyes
I am the venom that consumes you
The serpent in your paradise
The crown for the morbid
The crown for the morbid
I am the reason why
The innocent are slaughtered
I am the laughing lie
That's never uncovered
The unsilenceable cry
To kill your beloved
I am like death inside you
And I loathe you all
Multiple personality
The sickness eating you
Your sane psychotic episodes
I'm the voice that speaks to you
Only you will know
I am as real as can be
I'm the final words you'll read
I'll be the end of your story
I am the crown for the morbid
The fire in the eyes of the rabid
I am the hate inside the psychotic
And the fear consuming the phobic
I am the crown for the morbid
The fire in the eyes of the rabid
I am the hate inside the psychotic
And the fear consuming the phobic
I am the crown for the morbid
The fire in the eyes of the rabid
I am the hate inside the psychotic
And the fear consuming the phobic
I seek to overthrow you
With the powers given to me
By your own weak mind
That turned on you today
I am the worst of intentions
That dwells inside you all
I am the instinct never mentioned
That makes humanity fall
I am the swine devouring pearls
Right before your coward eyes
I am the venom that consumes you
The serpent in your paradise
The crown for the morbidI live for the night - I'm a bringer of fright
Here to take your life - I'm a sinner that's right
Filling your heads with pain,making you writhe and bleed
I'll destroy this place,making you scream
Ah - Ah
Ah - Ah
Break down the walls - Break down the walls
Break down the walls - Break down the walls
I torture your brain - I'm the bringer of pain
Tear and grind at your mind,watching you falling insane
In the depths of teh dark I can hear you screaming for your life
Cannons are ready for fire you're in the sights
Ah - Ah

[Beehler, Johnson, McPhee][Instrumental]What plagues the brain
To drive a clever child
Into what we see
As a threat to society
Plucking his victims
From the veins of the city
An endless supply
Of new desires
Fill the craving for
A sense of the diabolic
The killers of killers
Slumped the mangled body
Up against a tree
Like a hunched over scarecrow
In a fetal position
During torture
Trussed up like a hog
In the blackness of the forest
Screamings unheard
Gagging on dirt
Packed deep into the lungs
Eyes branded, have no color
Cornesa engraved
Random incisions sliced deep
Through the muscle exposing bones
What plagues the brain
To drive a clever child
Into what we see
As a threat to society
Plucking his victims
From the veins of the city
An endless supply
Of new desires
Fill the craving for
A sense of the diabolic
During torture
Trussed up like a hog
In the blackness of the forest
Screamings unheard
The killers of killersEs geschah in der Zeit,
Als die Sonne die Erde zum Glhen brachte
Und die Menschen sich nach der Nacht sehnten,
Nach den Schatten
Und der Linderung ihrer Qual:
Die Luft steht stickig still
Die Erde in der Hitze bebt
Kein Windhauch lindert die Qual
Schweiss rinnt von der kalten Stirn
Fieber tobt im weissen Leib
Kein Windhauch lindert die Qual
Auf sanften Flgeln schwebt die Nacht herbei
Der letzte Tag
Schliesst dunkle Augen mit weichem Flgelschlag
Auf sanften Flgeln schwebt die Nacht herbei
Die leise Klag
Schwindet ungehrt, da sie nichts vermag
Staub liegt in der heissen Luft
Das Atmen fllt ihm schwer
Kein Windhauch lindert die Qual
Flehend an seinem Bette wacht
Die Geliebte wartend auf die Nacht
Kein Windhauch lindert die Qual
Auf sanften Flgeln schwebt die Nacht herbei
Der letzte Tag
Schliesst dunkle Augen mit weichem Flgelschlag
Auf sanften Flgeln schwebt die Nacht herbei
Die leise Klag
Schwindet ungehrt, da sie nichts vermag
Es geschah in der Zeit
Und endlich kam die NachtIch traf dich in der Disco
Und sprach dich an
Dein süßes Lächeln
Hat es mir gleich angetan
Ich lad dich gerne ein
Auf ein Glas roten Wein
Denn heute nacht, mein Schatz
Da wirst du bei mir sein...
Wir sprachen sehr lange
über dies und das
Ein paar nette Worte
Du hattest deinen Spaß
Doch wie die Zeit vergeht...
Schon gleich um vier
Komm, trink dein Glas aus
Dann wollen wir zu mir
Und...
Spiel mit mir ein kleines Spiel, mein Schatz
Spiel mit mir ein kleines Spiel, heut nacht
Lass dich doch überraschen, was ich zu bieten hab
Wir werden viel Spaß haben - auf meine Art...
Wie du so dort sitzt
Nackt auf meinem Bett
Denk ich zurück an Anna,
Natürlich an Janett
Die zwei, die vor dir kamen
Vor gar nicht langer Zeit
Doch ich schweife ab
Sie sind Vergangenheit
Doch schon sehr bald
Wirst du bei ihnen sein
Doch zuvor, mein Schatz,
Wirst du bluten wie ein Schwein...
Und...
Spiel mit mir, ich lass dir gern die Wahl der Waffen
Spiel mit mir, vielleicht wirst du es sogar schaffen
Den neuen Tag zu sehn - in einem Stück
Ich wünsch dir alles Gute - und ganz viel Glück...
Du scheinst nicht zu verstehn
Worum es hierbei geht
Erst als ich dich anschneide
Machst du das Spielchen mit
Du wählst das Küchenmesser
und hältst es vor dich hin
Ein wirklich schöner Anblick
Bis ich das Spiel beginn
Im Lauf der nächsten Zeit
Verlierst du Glied um Glied
Ein wirklich schönes Schauspiel
Das ich dir gerne biet...
Nun liegst du da
Verkrümmt auf meinem Wasserbett
Ich hab dir doch versprochen:
Diese Nacht wird nett...
Und...
Spiel mit mir ein geiles Spiel, mein Schatz
Spiel mit mir ein geiles Spiel, heut nacht
Lass dich doch überraschen, was man noch machen kann
Wenn man verlor die Beine - und seinen rechten Arm...Das tote, dem Untergang geweihte Gestirn
entblt die allmchtigen Schwingen
welche, vom Licht verbannt
in eisigem Grabe darliegen
Der in seinem Ich erstarrte Fels
folgt dem nchtlichen Schrei
des totgeweihten Engels
und gebrt die schwarze Schlange
in den Scho des reinigenden Zerfalls
Die Hure mit den vergifteten Augen
von finst'rem Mondschein erhellt
ist wie keusche Blasphemie
inmitten tiefschwarzer See
Nur wenn steinerne Ketten geboren in
knchernen Schrein
den Strom meiner animalischen Zweisamkeit zur
Quelle
der dunklen Macht erheben
Wird es die Losung sein
welche du vergaest
wie den Stuhl
den man eine geraume Zeit vermit
[English translation: Aphel - The Black Serpent]
The dead constellation, destined for the
downfall
uncovers the allmighty winnows
that lie in icy grave,
exiled by the light
The rock that's stiffened in itself
follows the nocturnal cry
of the doomed angel
and gives birth to the black serpent
in the shoot of the cleansing decay
The whore with the poisoned eyes
that are lit by dark moonlight
is like chaste blasphemy
in the middle of a deepblack lake
Only when stone chains, born in the shrine made
of bone,
lift up the stream of my animalistic duality to
the source
of the dark power
It will be the password
that you forgot
like the chair
that has been missing for some timeJustice System...Is there Justice in the system? Or is there just us in the system??
They love to drag your ass to court
This is the arena for their sick sport
They run for office and make more laws
100,000 reasons to further their cause
We get charged we better watch out
A system of fear what they make out
Wither way it goes good or bad
The attorneys get paid and they get fat
Is there justice in a world gone crazy?
Where its survival of the fat and lazy
The less youve got theyve got you on your knees
Youll cop pleas they get fees
Its all such a web of lies
Its all such a web of lies
Its all such a web of lies
Its all such a web of lies
Its all such a web of lies
Attorneys are spiders and we are flies(4x)
One to prosecute one to defend
One to judge you and in the end
12 of your peers are forced to sit in
All lawyers lie so they can win
Either way they get paid
We are the victims with the laws theyve made
Theyll take your freedom and then your home
Theyll take it all till youre all alone
Break up a family for a fee
I cant remember when i was free
Free to worship free to speak
They never practice what they preach
**chorus**
A country of laws and lawyers make them
Arm the police and they defend them
Books full of lies but we dont believe them
Their jobs secure the long arm of the law
**Chorus**Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
I say come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Do you wanna be in my gang, my gang, my gang?
Do you wanna be in my gang, oh yeah?
Do you wanna be in my gang, my gang, my gang?
Do you wanna be in my gang?
I'm the leader, I'm the leader
I'm the leader of the gang, I am
I'm the leader, I'm the leader
Well, there's no one like the man I am
I can take you high as a kite every single night
I can make you jump out of bed standing on my head
Who'd ever believe it? Come on, come on
Who'd ever believe it? Come on, come on
Who'd ever believe it? Come on, come on
Do you wanna be in my gang, my gang, my gang?
Do you wanna be in my gang, oh yeah?
Do you wanna be in my gang, my gang, my gang?
Do you wanna be in my gang?
I'm the leader, I'm the leader
I'm the leader of the gang, I am
I'm the leader, I'm the leader
I'm the man who put the bang in gang
I can take you over the hill, ooh, what a thrill
I can make you sell me your soul for my rock and roll
Who'd ever believe it? Come on, come on
Who'd ever believe it? Come on, come on
Who'd ever believe it? Come on, come on
Do you wanna be in my gang, my gang, my gang?
Do you wanna be in my gang, oh yeah?

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
I say come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, I am the leader
Come on, come on, come on, come onI find nothing inside
Nothing that let's me understand
The faults and sacrifices I have made
And endless search for the answers I'll never find at all
Now I'm lost in this place, lost the feeling inside of me
Lost for the whole world to see
I am lost
I am so fucking lost
When trust is lost
How can things move on
Frightened of what might be
Never saw it coming
With the flood of regret, I need to get out of here
I find things in my mind
That mean more than your empty shell
Things you can't wish for
Not even from the deepest well
Nothing more, nothing less, just a flood of regretPascha Kazakow war Schachspieler und lehrte seine beiden Sohne Babel und
Zacharias eine symbolische Schachtheorie. Er glaubte daran, dass jeder
Kegel des Spiels eine Bedeutung fur die menschlichte Gesellschaft besabv
und das Holzbrett einer Begegnung Hader, Abhsngigkeit, ja Fessel einer
vollstandig intakten Gemeinschaft demonstrierte. Eine reale Welt verstand
er als Spielflache, die das Leben ihrer Bewohner in Spezien unterteilte,
die teils Trauer und Liebe erkennen, vermitteln, besitzen und verbergen
lieb. Alles was er an den Menschen nicht verstand, versuchte er in der
Schachwelt zu erkennen und auszudrucken. Er erprobte die Gefahr der
Unterdruckung eines Volkes, ersann die "karelische Eroffnung" und
verurteilte kommunistische Tugenden im Zusammenhang mit dem russischen
Schachspiel. Zacharias war inzwischen herangewachsen und began nach Paschas
Tod, sein Schachspiel nach eigenem Ermessen zu verbessern und kleinere
Turniere in der Ukraine zu spielen. War es nun das erschopfte Renommee des
Vaters, das nach "Reputation!" rief und immerlauter werdend, und lauf genug
dann am Sterbebett, die beiden Sohne um Hilfe bat? War er, Zacharias
Kasakow, plotzlich ein Schachspieler, dem deshalb das Trommelspiel verboten
wurde? 1915 reist er nach Moskau, um Paschas Schachlehre mit den
Aufzeichnungen zu vergleichen, die dieser bei seiner Schwester Tonja am
Kalininprospect hinterlieb. Die Notwendigkeit, ein Bewohner des
S/W-Diagramms zu sein, veramderte Zacharias' Leben schlagartig, er dachte
an das pulsierende Leiden seines Vaters, der mit seiner eigenen Theorie
begraben schien, ohne sie je sieghaft verteidigt zu haben. Schwer und
betucht schlugen die Seiten der Manuskripte in den Luftraum, Zacharias las
und las, notierte und notierte, stellte die Kegel auf das Schwarz/weib
bemalte Brett der Tischebene und sah das Bildnis vom Trommelbuben, der
unaufhaltsam uber die Diagramme schlich. Der Zar war Konig, die Zarin Dame,
der Arzt ein Laufer, er kramte im Schrank am Dachgeschob, zerlegte das
Zinnsoldatenregiment von Onkel Oleg und stellte den Zinntrommler in das
Feld des aubersten Schachbauern. Auf diese Art und Weise war er den
Holzfiguren naher, als es irgendein unerprobtes Spielsystem hatte
verrichten konnen. Die Schlacht konnte beginnen.[The Chronicler of Antediluvia:]
Long ago, before the Third Great Cataclysm reshaped the face of creation,
one nation rose above all others in the antediluvian world... Atlantis.
[The Atlantean Quorum:]
Hear the call Atlanteans, proud we stand forever,
Mightiest of warriors, we sail across the sea.
Conquering the ancient world, a legacy eternal,
Raise the arcane sigil high, steel and sorcery!
Blessed with immortality, dreaming spires of majesty, glory crowns our destiny!
[The Host of Z'xulth:]
Your realm is lost... it shall be devoured by the sea!
[The Chronicler of Antediluvia:]
And so it was written in the stars, astride the world would stand the children
of Atlantis!-------------
(Lyrics: Stanne)
Force of anger, Mordant senseless wrath
Manifold is the Terminus of oneself
Invocate ye lord of the Left-behinds
Preserve a seat for the weakened minds
Reserving that limpid yet so used
Veil of deceiving hostility
Close now is the threshold of insanity
Neverending force of hatred,
fear, them darkened spheres
Deprecated existence, Manifest of darkness be
Manifest for unspeakable actions
Fire sermons to condemn those fallen
Fallen from pride, fallen from the manger
Father, lend to me thy wisdom, Thy wisdom of old
Now all is clear:
"Pierce the side of the neverending blindness
Then thereby be it stated in the name of the forgotten
Father of Light, Father of Darkness
-I will not implore to no master of thine!"
Everflaming
Intemperate malice in the extreme
Forms are twisted, Everfalling
Crescent skies, the wait, The calling
Eyes unseeing, Stars rearrange
Tears of our blood running from the runes
Misgivings fall silent
Excitement stir up the spheres
My sweet Norderland
To reap the fields of ignorance and lies
Trails of omission swept away
Never be found again
Release of agony
So Hebulous, yet ominous is the Terminus
Flames of Hatred burn me
Firesoul - Hear me, Blinded fool
-Take heed to the forgotten twilight
Now kneel to the omniscient twilight
Crimson Winds, Ornaments in the dark
The weep of pain, Drowned by tears
Drowned by tears of Northerly blood
Runes of force,
Fulfillment of a sombre ordeal I know
"Pierce the side of the neverending blindness
Then thereby be it stated in the name of the forgotten
Father of Light, Father of Darkness
-I will not implore to no master of thine!"
Everflaming
Everlasting lust for wisdom and for solitude
Coming of dawn, Knowledge in the image of flesh
Unbridled to the world I wander now
Light cast upon this place of mysteries
Truth hurts for my tongue is venomous
Unbound yet bound for disbelief
Darkness, I grasp your every nerve
Everflaming now and forevermoreI wonder if I'm alive
Breathe slowly
Open your eyes
Can you hear me?
Look at what's in front of you
An endless journey
Our end
What do you see?
What do you feel?
Were we ever really alive?
You know this is the right choice
Let's switch off together
Let's float to no more
Goodbye to everythingDeath rides a horse full force, burning bridges
Put asunder, this I'm under
One face, one oath, one truth
Easy money consorts with easy virtue
Sing you sinners silent thunder
The joy of rapture, riding the bullet
It can't be captured
One face, one oath, one truth
Easy money consorts with easy virtue
No methods to their madness
It's gonna be a long hot winter
I see belief, when no one else does
I see belief, when no one else does
Hope dies, better off think of one
Hope dies, these rules are for fools
One face, one oath, one truth
Easy money consorts with easy virtue
Sing you sinners silent thunder
The joy of rapture, riding the bullet
It can't be captured
One face, one oath, one truth
Easy money consorts with easy virtue
No methods to their madness
It's gonna be a long hot winter
I see belief, when no one else does
I see belief, when no one else doesEach little piece begins to stack up
Now suffering under the weight of my choices
And I hardly recognize myself
Somewhere along the line
There stopped being lines at all (whispering silence)
Whispering silence
The subtle contradiction
Compromise creeps in
Forgetting who I once was
Slowly changing
Who I once was
Each moment seemed so small
When looked at by itself
But it adds up
And it has torn me down
All lines are gone (whispering silence)
Whispering silence
The subtle contradiction
Compromise creeps in
Forgetting who I once was
Slowly changing
Who I once was
So close the truth
But still impossible
It was never one thing
And too many to try to add up
Fueled by faint deception
Conflict without acknowledging opposition
All because I had taken pride in my hidden lies
Whispering silence
The subtle contradiction
Compromise creeps in
Forgetting who I once was
Slowly changing
Who I once was
It was never one thing
And too many to try to add up
All because I had taken pride in my hidden liesAeternam dona eis, Domine:
Et lux perpetua luceat eis,
Et lux perpetua luceat eis.
Te decet hymnus, Deus, in Sion,
Et tibi reddetur votum in Jerusalem:
Et lux perpetua luceat eis,
Et lux perpetua luceat eis.
(...)
Et lux perpetua luceat eis,
Et lux perpetua luceat eis.
...a luceat eis...
[Lyrics from the Catholic Requiem Mass]Lonely thoughts from a lonely mind
He fights for recognition
Desperate tries only
Increasing the pressure
Falls blind unseen forever
The children of today
The children of tomorrow
Forced out of a life of their own
We are the sinners of these days
And only bringers of sorrow
We're only bringers of sorrow
Unforgivable sin
Temptation too big
Unforgivable sin
Temptation too big
Unforgivable sin
Unforgivable...
Wounds inflicted a bloodstained soul
Distinct marks of violence
Skin fragments under nails
And a God forsaken fate
No holy water can save him now
A false prophet, a deceiving smile
Arms open - here's trust to find
A man of God, a temptation too big
Unforgivable sin
No holy water can save him now
And no prayers can cleanse the lust
He used, abused, & he raped the trust
The innocence of a life is lost
Unforgivable sin
Temptation too big
Unforgivable sin
Temptation too big
Unforgivable sin
Temptation too bigsurechigau tabi ni kodoku ni obore ta

We are facing the future
We are caught in the pain
That's why we will always search for shining moments
We are facing the future
We are caught in the pain

(THE RECOLLECTIONS OF A WAR-WEARY MARINER)
???
MEMORIES OF DEATH AND LIFE...
For countless thousands of centuries I have walked the earth...
I have seen endless battle,
And untold centuries of slaughter.
I am reborn once more!
The same grim spirit once again given flesh...
O' to be ravished by the seductress death...
The Scion of the Storms:
Dethroned 'ere Atlantis fell, haunted by a dark queen's curse,
My son's soul shackled by this spell of endless death and grim rebirth.
Fly, o' skyborne steed of Lyonesse, ride the tempest's wings,
I am the scion of the vengeful skies, a god to warriors and kings!
REFLECTIONS ON LIFETIMES OF CARNAGE:
I have been slain by Roman gladius,
And by Norman spear dealt a mortal wound,
The threads of my ensorcelled destiny
Endlessly woven on some unknown cosmic loom.
I have lost my life to longbow shafts
Fighting for the English crown,
And mayhap I'll end this mariner's life
A good three score fathoms down!
I marched with vast armies 'ere gleaming Atlantis
sank beneath the waves...
I reddened my blade against Caesar's legions long ago...
I stood beside Boudicca at Colchester...
I dealt honed steel death from the ranks of Arthur Pendragon...
I slew and looted gloriously at Lindisfarne...
I slaked my scramasax at Maldon...
I crossed blades with Brian Boru at Clontarf...
I slaughtered left and right with Harold at Hastings...
I dispatched Norman swordsmen with Robin of Loxley...
I wielded a Claymore at Stirling Bridge...
I was in the thick of the fray beside Henry at Agincourt...
I spilled blood for the White Rose at Bosworth Field...
I captained a galleon against the great Armada of Philip II...
I have witnessed the rise of corrupt religions,
but my heathen blade was red countless centuries
before their flaccid laws were ever carved in stone.
They call me the Scourge of Medina Sedonia...
my ship sails at dawn, and may our English steel ring
gloriously against the cutlasses of the outlander pirates!
???
have written for me in the stars...
but the gods have decreed that this is the path I must follow,
and I am sure that my adventures are far from over...You'll talk to the wolves,
have the eyes of the night,
the tongue of the ravens,
you'll have the second sight.
You'll hear the trees whisper
to the stars and the moon
about the great alterations
coming up soon.
The eminence of darkness
you will understand,
you'll be part of the secret
that will outlast the land.
I tell your fortune.
Hunter and hunted you'll be.
Death and Tower and Swords
are your destiny.
When the earth will burst open
to wolve down the light
to spit forth its bowels
into the vast night.
When heaven and hell
and earth will be burning
you will have foreseen it,
waiting for it, yearning.
But you will not perceive
what the signs mean at all
that you're insignificant
and will perish and fall.
I tell your fortune.
Hunter and hunted you'll be.
Death and Tower and Swords
are your destiny.A barbaric land where the sword is the law,
and killing is the way of life.
An infernal wasteland and down a barren plain;
A warrior stands the test of fate.
His face is cracked from the wicked hands of time,
and scars from war have past,
Taking the reins from a shadowy steed,
I shall kill the foyus at it's layer!
Morbid Scream!
Skulls and bones lie relics in the sand;
Remembrance of men that came before.
The ground is scorched from the dragon's breath,
and corpses burned to stench and ash.
I awake in fury when the dragon attacks;
Advancing in anger - spitting fire.
Our barbarous laws, my thundering axe,
yet we'll fight the beast to it's death!Fear and sweat, my muscles ache
I smile, but it's just a fake
I fade away
It troubles me, what you're gonna say
Just a day away
And you will be here to stay
I wait and I wait
And what I really hate
Is the panic that stops me from breathing
My knees hit the floor
And I panic more
Until you open my doorLyrics: From Nvaml
I know that I hung
in the windcold tree
nine whole nights
with hurt point
To Oden given
self given to myself
In that thee
which nobody knows
>From which roots it ran
Not given bread
they brought no horns
Saw down from the tree
took up runes
took them with screams
and down from the tree I fell
Nine magic songs I got
from the famous son of
Boltorn, Besdas Father
and a drink I got
of precious mead
poured by Odrere
Then I became vigorous
and got wise
grew and felt well
of word sought word
the word again
of work sought work
the work again
Music: Ivar Bjrnson 1994Tired of obeying a God that always ruled like a tyrant
We decided to create our own kingdom
While being surrounded by creatures
Who pledged their allegiance eternally
We refused, we rejected
We decided to have our own empire
Not based on the Book of Lies
Forever we refuse the Kingdom of Light
Eternally...
Satan's Legions, None Will Ever See Them Fall...Cast down
From a holy place
Like lightning into the earth
Shockwaves in heaven
After this there is no search
The Pentagram catches a blaze!
System sends you to the grave
As the day comes to the end
I wonder what the fate will send
Do what thou wilt
shall be the whole of the law
With this entity
The time stands still!
With this entity
The time stands still!
The time stands still!
(yell)
2:11
I have you now it claims
Straight for the heart he aims
Blood Sacrifice
Black Magick Cult
I have you now it claims
Straight for the heart he aims
2:24
Deep in meditation
As far as the mind can see
Abandoning frustration
Changing through tribulation
Searching for the sacred place
Survive only 'cause of grace
2:45
SATAN! (yell)
3:03
I have you now it claims
Straight for the heart he aims
Do what thou will
With me the time stands still
Once upon a time, Chastity was law
Lust, one thing no man should trust
Into your heart it thrust,
your own doom sends you back to the dust
For dust you are, and to dust you shall return
3:38
Temperance, ability to restrain
Hold back the pain; know that you'll gain
Sheer excess
Atmosphere of hate
Virtuosity the cure
3:54
Sacred thoughts are well placed
Thinking about the wars I faced
The treasures that I once chased
The nightmares I've embraced
4:13
Charity what others need
Opposite of Greed
Sloth taking on diligence
Ambition to live
Ambition to die
Ignorance, stealing from the season
Tears away all the reason
4:36
Satan!
Sudden darkness Wrath
Anger in the mind's path
Patience can save
Evil thoughts I crave
Of the flesh mans a slave
Walking towards the grave!
5:12
Pride of the God of this world
Seven Deadly sins got your soul
Sudden darkness Wrath
Anger in the mind's path
Of the flesh mans a slave
Walking towards the grave!
Satan the Servant
Satan the Test
Satan the Savior
Satan the Killer
Satan The BeastCrawling the walls through every crack and crevice
teems blackness washing over the windowpanes painting the buildings in between
creeping down the alley ways consuming every street
soundless swarm of nothingness sure to doom us all
pulling screaming earthlings into its toothless jaws
endlessly beginning spreading with no sign of stop
horror of horrors truly maddening in size
running just prolongs the end inevitably it strides
where has it come from? how can it be stopped?
so quickly we're to meet our end our empire we have lost
karmatic Armageddon no religion could foresee
a planet once forsaken not even a memory
streetlights bend into the void cars enveloped whole
darkness deeper than a blindman's sleep soon to paint the world
insatiable its hunger it drinks the sea without a belch
stretching to the other side where it is sure to meet itselfThere'll be a time
Where I can take what they've taught and make it work
THIS would be a better place if you could free you mind of thought
THOUGH to be in this place life, has abandoned you
WORLD that we now live in has changed so rapidly
THERE'S no need for equality equality
All the dreams, ideals you fought for, waiting now for someone else
It's not real, that you're feeling parts of life's exterior
I can see you body rot, gaze upon your cornea
No one wins we end together, values, visions dead forever
HATE to be nothing why do you abandon me
WORDS without actions lies they mean nothing
CAN'T you all see the light that waves in front of you
THIS could be a mirror of the only ever way that WE'VE KNOWN
I can take what they've taught and make it work
THIS would be a better place if you could free you mind of thought
THOUGH to be in this place life, has abandoned you
WORLD that we now live in has changed so rapidly
THERE'S no need for equality equalityany time you're searching for a friend
there is no-one there
take a look behind your back
and realize that its just a dream
the darkness came closer to you when you
promised me lies
we're walking under the same sun
when moonlight shows the time
looking for memories shows the time
far beyond your wildest crime
walking down the streets in the rain
there are no lights to show you the way
and the houses began to stare
they seemed to be alive
the soul of water is back
there is not the slightest chance to escape
we're walking under the same sun
when moonlight shows the time
looking for memories I believe
far beyond your wildest crime
with broken wings
we keep searching for what we love
changing friends
kick my ass, and you can't come back
with broken wings
sudden sorrow
changing friends
will break by the lies of tomorrowAt the very start
There were whispers in the dark
And for all the world to see
There was witchcraft at its heart
And on the autumn air
The scent of bonfires everywhere
And a fell wind stirred the leaves
The persecution song
Telltale signs of possession
Little Miss Demeanour in the demons bed
Gasps she just could not suppress
After lights-out midst the dead
And a past on which sin cast its darts of wickedness
Time was running faster for disaster
Strange nights were burning
In the furnace of her dreams
A name was uttered, Lilith
Mistress, playmate, master
Such sights were stolen in the throes of ecstasy
And in the thick of all
In the Black Goddess's thrall
With the wood unseen for trees
Victoria stood tall
Promiscuous in step
The Devil breathing down her neck
As jealous zealots stitched apiece
The persecution song
Telltale signs of possession
Fickle Miss Demeanour hissed and disappeared
To her Sisters of the cloth
She now reeked of Astaroth
Again the curse had surfaced
Sneaking back the pagan years
Weaving webs of great revealing
Hidden in the convent
An evil libido abided, undone
Breathing, deceiving
Feasting on her deviant feelings
She'd clung to her crucifix
Once her torturers begun
Her screams came quick
The miserichord
Den to vice and screw
That had reddened many tongues
Wrung symphonies
Of suffering from her
Many moons hardened pure hearts
Those plagued by her black arts
Their rooms secreting phantom orgies
Vile rites and rifled graves
Mere hours, now towered
Above this bent and beaten flower
Her naked body privy to
The Abbess and her ways
Victoria fought
No guilt was wrought
Just a torrid retort of blasphemies
Nails and crosses vomited forth
From this pretty little whore now arched like Hell
Arched like Hell
At the very start
There were whispers in the dark
And for all the world to see
There was witchcraft at its heart
But then the end grew nigh
A dirge inferno filled the sky
In its customary key
The persecution song
Telltale signs of obsession
No wailing banshee would dishonor their name
Nuns dragged her to the blasted oak
Storm-clouds threatened holy smoke
They hanged her there like Judas
With the Hellcat in her reined
Time was running faster for disaster
Exorcism, torture, gallows
Now a shallow grave
A name was stuttered, Isaac
Tongue-tied, simple, bastard
They made him dig the pit
Mindless of what it claimed[method man]
Uh, and it goes like this
Uh uh uh uh, it goes like that
Now let me tell you who I am
Up early in the morning, dressed in black
Who dat? *echoes*
[genius/gza]
Yo yo
Marvel this theatrical, drama on stage
Broadway classical, led men to rage
Like currents, the beat change and now a flow is strange
You in the arctic wit wolves that viciously main
Thugs that roam clubs, in the dark wit fireworks that spark
Saltwater vibrations comin from sharks
Blood-thirsty kids bite just as well as I write
You're like secretaries who can't type, you're no use
Broke down vessels who want a boost, there's no jokes
Quick fast you, get stumped 'cause you played, your organ pump
Kool-aid, from indiana wit the jones of a lost crusade
Hip-hop done hit the church, choir girls rockin mini skirts
The b-side kept plenty hurt
Push like the shovels in snow storms
And stack piles of foul, the shit you must grow on! *echoes*
Chorus [method man] 4x
Uh and it goes like this
Uh uh uh uh, it goes like that
[method man]
Pay no attention to the evil they speak
You caught the beef wit the equal eye, poisonous beats from underneath
Crack the concrete wit two left feet
Head on my meat
Ain't no games here we playin for keeps (we play for keeps!)
Introducing, the crowd seducing man on the street
Penitentiaries is either half-dead or too sweet
Back to basic, condition-al god, plus I can take it
Wagin war within the matrix, it's hard to see
Touch, hear, smell or even taste it, take your places
We runnin in these human races, bucking naked
Back-slappin kid yappin, actin villian catchin feelin like we cap peelin
As if we killin every brick in every project building
From cabrini green to tildens, sincerely yours
Mista meth and maximilion (da millions, da millions)
(ka ka ka ka ka ka ka kaaa!) (da millions ha!)
Chorus 5x
[method man]
Uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh
Wu-tang killa bees on the swarm (we play for keeps!)
(we play for keeps!)
Wu-tang killa bees on the swarm
And it goes like thisI sit the magazine together with other bullets
And do you really think. My fate is fucked up?
I stifle in the dark chamber. I'm cramped like in an asshole
I will feel like a loser, until they fire me out!
I am a stray bullet, what do you think?
When will I reach you? I am a stray bullet!
Now I'm sitting in your skull
And the plan has been completed
I'll repeat it with no doubt
I'll devour your young heart
I sit in the rifle barrel. I'm embedded perfectly
So hard and slender too. I'm dope clean totally
I'm waiting for my kick. I'm waiting for my kick
I'm waiting for my kick. I'm waiting for my kick
Naughty boy. Where. Do you think
Will I hit you, little prick?
I am a stray bullet, what do you think?
When will I reach you? I am a stray bullet!
Now I'm sitting in your skull
And the plan has been completed
I'll repeat it with no doubt
I'll devour your young heart...Music: Albert Maroto
Lyrics: Elisa C.Martin
If I had it in my power...
If I could remain here...
Every minute, every hour
To leave knowing that I will return again
To return dreaming that I'll never go away
I'm a lost and scared hunter
But I chose this tortuous way
'Cause it's me and it's my life
I don't want to make mistakes
Your voice reminds me now that I'm alive
When you call me and say to me that all is fine
But now I miss the silence of the night
And the calmness of the sun
Sometimes I feel so far away from home
So far away from my life
Never felt this way before
Everytime I feel so far away from your love
Small things that become details
Now you have to let me go
Every second's like an hour
Every hour's like a day
I'll feel for the last time desire
And I'll turn and run away
If you think that I am strong
You are wrong!
'Cause I need my simple life
A piece of this world...[Music by Lord Ahriman. Lyrics by Emperor Magus Caligula]
The earth quakes, and the seas are rising.
As the warlock look deep into the flames.
The fire of evil, are reflected in his abysmal eyes.
As he calls upon the ancient ones.
I call upon thee, keeper of the darkest flame.
To drink from the chalice of souls.
I call upon thee, king of all beasts.
Lord of the hunt, silent stalker of the night.
I call upon thee, keeper of all hatred and anguish.
The one who holds the cosmic pain.
I call upon thee, custodian of the infernal legions.
God of war and the hatred storms.
The sky spit flames, Armageddon has come.
The wrath of Satan descends upon this mortal world.
Men revert to beasts, suicidal despair for his glory.
Every mind is clutched in terror,
As a vortex of evil surrounds the warlock flames.
The legions of Satan trample through the flames.
The earth is scared and burned like dead skin.
Angels blood smirched the Nazarene divine kingdom.
Armageddon finally comes.
The wind carry ashes and the smell of burned flesh,
The rivers are filled with blood.
The mortals are captured in an irreversible strife for their souls,
Against the unyielding forces of..........EVIL........
Armageddon finally comes.Album: The Score
(Instrumental)You threw your web right down on me
You suck my blood just to live
You're the black princess in the garden of grief
Eating me piece by piece
To be with you is like mouth full of spiders
Like needles under my skin
To sleep with you is like a bed filled by snakes
Something I can't resist
Oh, licking your bloody lips,
Smiling and sucking your fingertips
Oh, lash me with your whip
I'm your slave...My dear carniwhore
You're the cocaine on my filthy mirror
Oh my god how I need you
Living in fear to be left alone
My lips turn to blue
I'm like a sheep among the hungry wolves
This is my sorrow blues
You're the poison in my veins
I'm just a fool in your game
In the prison of my own frontiers
Loneliness is my worst fear
Blinded by your heavenly smile
And my soul is the price
Oh, licking your bloody lips,
Smiling and sucking your fingertips
Oh, lash me with your whip
I'm your slave, for you I bleedYou seek the answer
Too plain to see
Come play with fire
Come play with me
You either know or never will - find it!
You go be what you fight and kill
It's in your blood
You either know or never will - find it!
So go be what you fight and kill
It's in your blood
Know what you know
And what it means
In the age of the snake
It is not what it seems
You either know or never will - find it!
You go be what you fight and kill
It's in your blood
You either know or never will - find it!
So go be what you fight and kill
It's in your blood
It's in your blood
You are a serpent saint
Serpent saint
Man of wood forgot the gods
Forever punished and restrained
Lose your fear through Lucifer
The heaven here wait to be reined
Man of wood forgot the gods
Forever punished and restrained
Lose your fear through Lucifer
Become the heir
The serpent saint
You either know or never will - find it!
You go be what you fight and kill
It's in your blood
You either know or never will - find it!
So go be what you fight and kill
It's in your blood
God... mud... now it's in your blood
God... mud... now it's in your blood
God... mud... now it's in your blood
God... mud... now it's in your blood
God... mud... it is in the bloodHello world in veins, drive the ale stuff on its way
Now it's time again, kill the bad mood! Kill hate flames!
Hello world in veins send love to my spirit space!
Woman youu be gone and the movie starts to run.
Now I get lower every day and it's a kind moment to stay
in a whispering reich
Time burns my world
You're a cheap heart!
You're a traitor cunt!
Slut, youu suck your drugs as pastime, fuck!
And I'm minusman, falling down on my knees again,
scream to my mirror's shame, bluaaaah!!
Dark rings under bleary eyes, rasping voice, this is my child
Boy your health had not a choice and I listen to you:
"Hello damaged game, recognize your child again!
Hello dad, lets go to repair you in the toyland store!
Now I just need to find the train to the toyland of my space
and my whispering reich
Time burns my world
You're a cheap heart! You're a traitor cunt!
Slut, you suck your drugs as pastime, fuck!
And I'm minusman, falling down on my knees again,
scream to my mirror's shame, bluaaah!
Mother left us and of all the guilt goes a great part to my side
Child, you have to pay the bill
Is there somebody who'll give this tale an end?
I won't be sacrificed for trends
Hello world in veins, minusman's my name"The Fruits Of Ill Virtue"
Some people make a habit of sucking livelihood out of their fellow humans.
Everything they have is a profit gained at the expense of their peoples
misfortune. This song is about these people. Andy
"A Serenade For The Tragic"
Your feelings interface totally with your actions. Ruled by your emotions
and intermost desires, you live a life both catastrophic and divine. Mark
"Suffer The Shadows"
One look back; one regrets; and consequently one dies...
beautiful it isn't. Andy
"The Way Of All Flesh"
This is the song about emotional union; about understanding;
and above all, about loving someone. Andy
"Chinese Whispers"
If there is truth at the heart of mankind's beliefs, then the passage of
thousands of yearly surely have hidden it behind error, rumour and
misunderstanding. Strip away the layers of confusion and you shall find
the truth. Mark
"Soon Ripe, Soon Rotten"
We never listen and so we'll never learn. Society, the apple of our eyes,
is rotten to the core and is ripe for disposal in a universal garbage bag.
Andy
"Gather The Shattered"
A person takes an act that disintegrates him, thought by thought, down to
a primal level. As he then pieces his mind back together, he hopes that
both his mind and his soul will be the better for it. Mark
"My Soul Frayed Bare"
This about loving someone. MarkIt feels so warm when you are near
You are all I want to feel
Tell me now, is this for real?
It's hard to breathe
We're all lost and travelled high, cannot find my peace of mind
When the sun will rise again, we'll fly away
Take the stairs to the stars
Wander long, travel far
Someday
A summer breeze makes all of our winters freeze
Autumn leaves
There's no chance for spring's romance
We linger on but leave the past behind us
Old lovers live it all anew
But chances are so few
Windows open up to life
Put your worries all aside
Sacred silence closes doors for opened eyes
Take the stairs to the stars
Wander long, travel far
Someday
Always
A summer breeze makes all of our winters freeze
Autumn leaves
There's no chance for spring's romance
We linger on but leave the past behind us
Old lovers live it all anew
But chances are so few
And choices are so true...The water pours its embracing arms around the stone
Decay drips from the unquiet void where the ice forms, where life ends
The stone is by the crimson flood, swallowed
The red tide beyond the ebon wound, contorted
My sacrifice bids farewell in this river of memory... a wave to end all time
Red birds escape from my wounds and return as falling snow
To sweep the landscape; a wind haunted, wings without bodies
The snow, the bitter snowfall
You wish to die in her pale arms, crystalline, to become an ode to silence
In the soul of a mountain of birds, fallen
The cascading pallor of ghostless feather
The snow has fallen and raised this white mountain on which you will die
and fade away in silence.Now far I, I am from you before my fire alone
And read again the hours that so silently have gone
And it seems that eighty years beneath my feet did glide
That I am old as winter, that maybe you have died
The shadows of the past swift stream across life's floor
The tale of all times, nothing that now exist no more
While the wind with clumsy fingers softly fumbles at the blind
And sadly spins the fiber of the story in my mind
I see you stand before me in a mist that does enfold
Your eyes are full of tears, and your fingers long and cold
About my neck caressing your arms you gently ply
And it seems you want to speak to me, yet only sigh
And thus I clasp entranced my all, my world of grace
And both our lives are joined in that supreme embrace
Oh, let the voice of memory remain forever dumb
Forget the joy that was, but nevermore will come
The shadows of the past swift stream across life's floor
The tale of all times, nothing that now exist no more
While the wind with clumsy fingers softly fumbles at the blind
And sadly spins the fiber of the story in my mind
And thus I clasp entranced my all, my world of grace
And both our lives are joined in that supreme embrace
Forget how after an instant you thrust my arms aside
For now I'm old and lonely, and maybe you have diedAs the time passes by,
You wonder where we're standing now
Are we in the eternity?
Someday when all of good days are gone,
You will realize where we are.
Is the nature cheating us
And everything is just a game
Or we are just a part of it?
Why does every story has its end
Is there a second chance
Or my feelings are deceiving me?[Music:Aydan, Damnagoras / Lyrics: Aydan]
I built a cradle for the Moon
And from her chariot (she) grants my
Boon - I'll keep my promises, I'm sure
She won't betray me
I'm bathed in her pale lightfall
Perceiving like a distant call
She whispers in my ears
Riddles I don't understand
Enchanted by thy serene glow
Oh, silent Lady let me know
Of arcane doctrines and secrets
To be not revealed
You doodle Night with stains of stars
Shining arabesques so far
Recite your rhymes, and tell me how to
Find my way -
Through the endless starways
Far away - as man could understand
I will show my respect
Prey upon - to release your anger
Lay upon - my mind
Painted in the sky,
As magic as a silver chariot
Take me on and on [2x]
You and I asleep in my haven
Shettered by an archway of trees
And when you wake up, I'd rather be
There - Standing by your side
A comet rends this summer sky
Like a tear falls from Her eye
I feel my heart brakes,
The Nightroof is my own refuge
Follow the steps of a pagan
Against who won't understand at all
And what I've learned is how to
Find my way -
Through the endless starways
Far away - as man could understand
I will show my respect
Prey upon - to release your anger
Lay upon - my mind
Painted in the sky,
As magic as a silver chariot
Take me on and on [2x]
You and I asleep in my haven
Shettered by an archway of trees
And when you wake up, I'd rather be
There - Standing by your side
They're mocking me, they're fighting me,
I'm falling on my knees
They're celebrating victory
Let'em do it as they please
They can mock me, they can fight me,
I will pick up off the ground
Again I stand before my enemies
Can't let me down
[Solos: Aydan, Jarpen]
Painted in the sky,
As magic, as a silver chariot
Take me on and on...
[Solo licks: Aydan]Twisted, beaten, and now ripped apart
The black hopeless days of a once thriving heart
The pain of the process. Your sick little plan
You buried the hope but! You can't kill the man
Your saintly disguise, and the route that you took
To impale my dreams on your rusted barbed hook
You fled from the scene, I was dumped in a can
You buried the hope but! You can't kill the man
Wrung out, and torn to shreds
Heartless the way you fled
Discarded - Left for dead
Wrung out, and torn to shreds
Heartless the way you fled
Dark days that I now dread
Discarded - Left for dead
Angelic sinner with heavenly eyes
Sadistical siren with covert sharp lies
You poisoned your prey long before I began
You buried the hope but! You can't kill the man
Demeaning white wench
Gouging wounds with black malice
Castrating victims with hands cold, and calloused
Lobotomized zombies, past lovers - Your clan
You buried the hope but! You can't kill the man
Wrung out, and torn to shreds
Heartless the way you fled
Discarded - Left for dead
Wrung out, and torn to shreds
Heartless the way you fled
Dark days that I now dread
Discarded - Left for dead
Combative defensive rants
From a mouth that's oh! So soiled
Tumultuous days, and nights
When your lies became our world
And go figure you'd slip away
With near hardly a scratch
Daddy's little debutante
Repulsive, rancid gash
Care free, and thoughtless. Your new open road
A filthy charred canvas disguised by the snow
Poetic dissent for your new fucking scam
You buried the hope but! You can't kill the man
New lease on life, I now thrive in the sun
Broke free from your cage. And I re-learned to run
Unleashing my wings with an infinite span
The blooming fresh dreams of this unbroken man
Wrung out, and torn to shreds
Heartless the way you fled
Discarded - Left for dead
Wrung out, and torn to shreds
Heartless the way you fled
Dark days that I now dread
Discarded - Left for dead[Chorus:4x]
Oj, goj, Rode! Oj, goj, Rode!
Skvoz' sedoj tuman
Vzgljad ustremilsja vdal'
Tam v mire mertvyh skal
Ty zatail pechal'
Mechetsja dusha
Nad ledjanoj volnoj
Chuesh', chto smert' blizka
Strah ovladel toboj
Ne stavshij zhertvoj bujnyh vod
V smertel'noj shvatke s vetrom
Vzdymaja dlani k nebesam
Zhdesh' Rodova otveta
Kak vo lese, oj da vo temnom
Treby ognem vospylajut
Glasom svjawennogo roga
Brat'ja bogov vosslavljajut
Da prol'etsja svjataja sur'ja
V chashu u lika rodnogo
Ustami slavu glagoljat
Slovom, da k Rodovu domu
Goj, Rode, goj!
Goj, Rode, goj!
Goj, Rode, goj!
Ty slyshish'?
Goj, Rode, Goj!
Jej, Striboga - Vetra vy deti
Pesn' moju vy nesite s soboju
Da vospojte, kak na rassvete
Bilis' my s puchinoj morskoju
Ne slyshny nam zvonkie pesni
My odni pod holodnoj lunoju
Chto zhe bogi povedajut vskore
Nam, ukrytym nochi pelenoju?
Vzor k bogam do nebes vozdymaetsja
Krov' iz ran na zem' prolivaetsja
Son v hladnoj t'me sogreet
My ujti obrecheny
Zhizn' vo sne pomerknet
V carstvo Mary sginem my
Kak vo lese, oj da vo temnom
Lezha u pepla, da tlenna
Ustami zhizn' vospevajut
V hladnyh obejat'jah Mareny
Da prol'etsja aloju krov'ju
Gore, da bol'ju pronzaja
Glasom vo sinee nebo
Roda pred snom vosslavljaja:
Goj, Rode, goj!
Goj, Rode, goj!
Goj, Rode, goj!
Ty slyshish'?
Goj, Rode, Goj!
[Chorus:4x]
Oj, goj Rode! Oj, goj, Rode!Hallucination in a world gone mad
(Thats left me blinded)
A search for truth in a pack of lies
(It cant be found)
A constant pull, no direction, no choice
(Ill hold my ground)
It never stops, it forever just builds
(To tear us down)
Dont let them break you. Dont let them grind you down
Dont let them slit your throat. Dont let them bleed you dry
Nothing is sacred
Blood Money and lies
Nothing is sacred
Death and profits rise
You trade your life for the promise of wealth
(Then all hopes lost)
Fall to your knees at the monetary altar
(And sell your soul)
Pledge allegiance to your own moral death
(Its cast away)
And now you drowned in an ocean of greed
(Just like the rest)
Dont let them break you. Dont let them grind you down
Dont let them slit your throat. Dont let them bleed you dry
Nothing is sacred
Blood Money and lies
Nothing is sacred
Death and profits rise
Fuel the greed. Sell your soul
Just believe. Fuck the world
Fuck every day that living in this fucking nightmare surrounded,
Each waking hour every confrontation screaming FUCK your
Shallow ideals, its to the point of suffocation.
Im against the world so
Fuck me, fuck you FUCK EVERYTHING
Dont let them break you. Dont let them grind you down
Dont let them slit your throat. Dont let them bleed you dry
Nothing is sacred
Blood Money and lies
Nothing is sacred
Death and profits riseBread like sins
Suffer persecution
Showing the price
Forced stay of execution
Life failed once again
To see truth from the lies
Life fallen again
Watching truth fail in its eyes
Like and go back
Where I lost the way I am
Lay locks in time
Where does the nest begin?
Bread like sins
Suffer persecution
Showing the price
Forced stay of execution
I see clear
Broken piece realign
The only thing I fear
I'm running out of time
Before the broken pieces realign
I still hate shine
For what I'll never grasp
Just for mercy
It's all I've ever lost
I see clear
Broken piece realign
The only thing I fear
I'm running out of time
I see clear
Broken piece realign
The only thing I fear
I'm running out of time
One choice, one choice, one life
One choice, one choice, one life
One choice, one choice, one life
My choice, my choice, my life!
One choice, one life, I'm running out of time
One choice, one life, I'm running out of time
One choice (one choice) one life (one life) I'm running out of time
One choice (one choice) one life (one life) I'm running out of timeA universal movement begat from the dark side of music
Creating images of evil, horror and worlds of death
A genre for the true who strain against conformity
It devastates, laying waste to pathetic corporate norms
A musical form so horrible, glorifying corporate norms
It adopted the name of expired life
The ugly, dark side of melody in a subterranean home
The relentlessness of death metal and extremes of grind
Are only for the macabre who possess a unique frame of mind
The naive and ignorant simply take it, take it for face value
But they cannot ignore what's stabbing them
And for those of you who deny your unwholesome origins
May you choke to death on your hypocrisy
Is your ego that inflated that all integrity is lost?
Whenever you are faced with your own deceit
Your insincerily will shine through your plastic personality
The ugly, dark side of melody in a subterranean home
The relentlessness of death metal and extremes of grind
Are only for the macabre who possess a unique frame of mind
The naive and ignorant simply take it, take it for face valueTrollmakten jag ser uppe i bergen.
Frsvinn du som lyser ver mitt folk.
Ge dig ivg! Ge dig ivg!
Vr eviga pakt med natten skola ge oss liv, efter ond brd dd, efter ond brd dd

[A greeting for the trollkingdom in the mountains and a threat against the children of Eve and the tribe of christ.]This might be the last time you ever see me
But you can trust I did my best
As complex as all this seems
It's much more than a test
The sky is falling
The end is here
The final warning
The sun disappears
As my world is dying
So far from home
Been stranded in this empty abyss
Darkness surrounds me
Lifeless
The sky is falling
The end is here
The final warning
The sun disappears
Existence
Search for a new beginning
Persistent
Something always chasing me
This demon's covered in scars
Menacing
Burnt by the sun his flesh is charred
Challenging, Terrorizing, Manipulating every single thought
As he closes in
My will must be strong
Or he'll stab you in the fucking back
I won't turn to dust
The sky is falling
The end is here
The final warning
The sun disappearsI've been through the day and I don't have the time
To speak unto friends or to speak Lord to You
There is only one thing on my mind
And that is pleasing myself which I've no time to do
No time, no time
That's my constant cry
No time to help those in need
At last it's time to die
No time
At last before the Lord I came
I stood with downcast eyes
He held a book in His hands
It was the Book of Life
He opened up the book and said, "Your name I cannot find
I was once going to write it down
But I couldn't find the time."
God opened up His book and said, "Your name I cannot find
I was once going to write it down
But I couldn't find the time."
No time, no time
That's my constant cry
No time to help those in need
At last it's time to die
No timeForever should it be
Our love for all eternity
Will we ever see
This dream become reality?
Nothing is forever...
Hard were the times
we had been through together
After all we do know why
It had to be our last goodbye...
I am dying from inside
I was crying every night
The substance we fear
Truth hid in nights we felt near
Sorry never meant to be mean
The model soul caring never to be seen?
I hope you will remember me
When we both know
What will never be...
I am dying from inside
I was crying every nightWhispering Upon Funeral Winds
As The Horde From Hell Rides

Burning Down Everything In Sight... AloneSchillernde Wogen streifen durch das Land
Wie damals, nur von Nebel trb' geworden
Streifen sie grnster Grnde Grser, meine Hand,
Wie damals halt' ich sie entgegen
Das zu greifen, was ungreifbar ist, der Tand,
Der zischenden Fluten, unsichtbare Horden
Schwinden, so wie einst das damals schwand.
Kindliches Lachen von ferne,
Doch nah, wie im fiebernden Traum.
Oh Lachen, ich lachte dich gerne
Und nicht nur im nchtlich verschwommenen Raum.
Ihr Wogen, hier seh' ich euch wieder,
Die ihr am Anfang mich umweht.
Und wieder singt ihr eure Lieder,
Auf da ein and'rer sie zur rechten Zeit versteht.
Und wieder singt ihr eure Lieder,
Auf da ein and'rer sie zur rechten Zeit versteht.
Wallendes Tosen rauscht sich durch den Geist,
Erkenntnis, die im letzten Spiel gewonnen,
Rauscht durch der geifernden Gedanken Glut und heit
Am Ende mich willkommen.
Das zu greifen, was nicht greifbar ist, zumeist
Ist's das, was dem Menschen ach so frh genommen,
Und doch den Weg zu wahrem Leben weist.In the wind of the mind rises the Turbulence called I
It breaks down, showers the barren thought
All life is shocked, this desert is the abyss
Wherein is the Universe
The stars are but thistles in that waste
yet this desert is but one spot accursed in the world of bliss
Now and again travellers cross the desert
They come from the Great Sea, and to the Great Sea they Go
One by one they walked into the Land beyond the Stars,
Following the secret Pathways into Creation unknown
Guided by the forbidden Grimoires of Necromancy
They heard the Call of Cthulthu, loudly roaming in the Sky,
nonesome trembling from below
Spectres arose before them,
terrible Offsprings looked at them with their darksome eyes of Death
Only the pure shall pass...
May He who Tresspasses the void within
and masters the Spellcraft of the Necronomicon
descend into the Netherworld in all his Glory...Awaiting the war of ages thoughts awake
Sickness builds within our souls
Piercing through the hearts of the weak
Tremendous tribulation brought unto mankind
Self-destruction is at hand
Reaching the point of the return
the battles we fight are glowing
Now the reality of our planet burning
Is reaching the surface now showing
The insanity - will it ever stop?
Not in a thousand years
We are doomed to bring ourselves down
All life near the end
The chances of survival minimal
The rage of humanity has grown strong
The result of our non-intelligenceSpace, space, Spaceboy
Spaceboy, you're sleepy now
Your silhouette is so stationary
Spaceboy, you're sleepy now
Your silhouette is so stationary
You're released but your custody calls
And I want to be free
Don't you want to be free
Do you like girls or boys
It's confusing these days
But moon dust will cover you, cover you
This chaos is killing me, space fucking boy
Spaceboy, fuck you, space fucking boy
Bye, bye love
Bye, bye fucking Spaceboy
Bye, bye love
Fuck up Spaceboy
Bye, bye my loveBehold the apocalypse
The end is closing in
Did you ever really doubt
That we would pay for our sins
The heavens will burn
No one can save us now
Everything we once loved
Shall perish in flames
Armageddon coming on
A black dawn slowly rising
The heat will slowly consume you
Like a moth around a flame
Out of this silent planet
A single sign of life appears
A man made machine
Carrying an embryo of human lifePerpetration
Annihilation
Your punishment
Is life damnation
Forever enslaved
Forever deranged
Searching for - The reason to all your pain
Suffering - From splits within your brain
Cold sweat - Runs through your veins
Nothing remains
Disfigured soul
Tears you apart
Conflict inside
Two minds in fight
All your efforts
Just wasted time
You've paid your toll
Disfigured soulOn the first day of Gehenna
the shrieking winds shall be silent
and when a black sun hangs from a somber sky
Caine's sleeping children shall again arise
When antediluvians awake from eons of slumber
the strongest of us shall fall prey to their hunger
countless storms shall quake the earth
as the world turns icy cold
On the second day of Gehenna
our father shall return
and unite his wretched kindred
to the ebon throne of city Enoch
The vile culprits of diablerie
shall meet their deserved fate
to drink the scarlet tainted from the First-born
eating away their breathless bodies
And there shall be battle
Queen Lilith and me the bastard
fiendish legions ascending from the ground
And on the third day shall be silence
the next millennium antediluvians rule
but shall be borne a woman bearing lunar mark
the only key to our salvation...A bird flew out of Lapland
An eagle from the north east
One wing ruffled the water
And the other swept the sky
Its tail skimmed the sea
It flutters, it glides
It looks, it turns 'round
Why, man are you in the sea
Fellow among the billows?Times are changing and you'll soon have the power
The weak before the strong will break down and cower
Decrepit choices made for you and me
Archaic ploys with no future there to see
Selling arms to support the contras
Runs the world just like the Costra Nostra
Times are changing
Rearranging
Senile king
Senile king
And when you disagree and rally in protest
Who will win this death-defying contest?
Tables turning
Bridges burning
Senile king
Senile king
Will destroy
The more I think about it, less sense of it I make
They'll never pay for deeds made in aged haste
No, instead they'll die high up in ivory towers
But just how old will you be in your finest hour?
Tides are shifting
Sands are siftingshow me yours
and i'll show you mine
dial tone and ringin
connect and on
im on the hotline
and talking now
so shut your mouth
i know just what i want
and that someone is you
paint brush strokin
in the sinful art of lust
the picture becomes clear
no time to think twice
no time for regret
and one things for sure
this one's for me
i'm falling in love
with the thrill of the kill
and at this masquerade
you're the clown and criminal
i will be the devil
in your land of make believe
tell me how the view is
down there on your knees
as you beg and plead
knee deep in the hot wax
all stuck in the quicksand
sexual slave
you've learned your lessons well
don't pause for applause
my bloody valentine
with a slip of the tongue
i'm on the inside
snap the neck of slef control
and it breaks like prison bread
straightjacket seduction
it whipsers like the voice in your ear
you opened up the flood gates
and i'm drowning in your love
you opened up the flood gates
its to late to turn back
i'm falling in love
with the thrill of the kill
and at this masquerade
you're the clown and criminal
i will be the devil
in your land of make believe
tell me how the view is
down there on your knees
on your knees
adultery
i have become a danger to myself
a danger to myself
now that i'm in the palm of your hand
the palm of your hand
i have betrayed my family
betrayed my family
committed in sin adultery
and i can't stop now
i can't stop now
i'm falling in love
with the thrill of the kill
and at this masquerade
you're the clown and criminal
i will be the devil
in your land of make believe
tell me how the view is
down there on your knees
on your kneesIt seems like I'm trapped in my own dreams
It feels like the walls are caving in
When I close my eyes and start to fall asleep
Something's evil and dark, takes over me
I never feel safe to dream
I won't close my eyes and sleep
I fear that the dreams I dream are real
You need me so trust me - I make you feel free
You're under my spell now - So welcome to hell
It's getting hotter
Feel how the flames are growing
Surrounded by fire
You're inside my evil dream, my friend
Inside this dream all is painted black
Hundreds of doors but there's no way back
The road that I'm on never seems to end
A sinister feeling closing in
You need me so trust me - I make you feel free
You're under my spell now - So welcome to hell
It's getting hotter
Feel how the flames are growing
Surrounded by fire
You're inside my evil dream, my friend
So now you are trapped inside this dream
Only the walls can hear you scream
You can't close your eyes when you're falling down
Your heartbeat has stopped
It's getting hotter
Feel how the flames are growing
Surrounded by fire
You're inside my evil dream, my friend
It's getting hotter
Feel how the flames are growing
Surrounded by fire
You're inside my evil dream, my friendThese days are burning down
Every death is an end in the race
- no arrival
These lives - just ripples
In the stunning widths of space
- slipping away
This march will never end
Every stop is a death deep within
- deep within
It is a WAR over years and years
It is a WAR...
Passion in every step
Every month is a part of the circle
- no arriving
Counting your mirthfull days
Every year is a march round the wheel
- on and on
And when there is nothing left to light these worlds
I will be right at your side
I will be there in time
In time...
Marching on...
Travel - Arrival
Together we will drown
In the river of your transciency (You will see...)My soul flies to you
My rain and my moon
But I am here somewhere
I miss you and I love but I don't feel
Many tears for me
Too many wicked lies
But if you could love me still
It is the only thing I need
I love you my rain and my moon
My soul flies to you
What I said is what I meant
And said because I loved
The rain carries away
All the tears we cry here nowMy numb wings...
Already I don't know the words,
Which once I have known.
No perhaps because,
I'd the god's beauty little sang.
Something's perishing in me.
The pain's impossible to deceive.
That one easily learns to fly,
But the wings leave to break.
My numb wings...
For you my heart beat.
His beating suddenly whispering became.
Only nornes know,
I in truth the lie distinguish.
Until after that...
I have seen the love, which in hatred changed,
The joy, which the saddest tears shedded,
The beauty, which in excess of horror scared,
The life, which the death hid under own cursed wings.
Already I don't know the words,
Which once I have known.
No perhaps because,
I'd the god's beauty little sang.
Something's perishing in me.
The pain's impossible to deceive.
That one easily learns to fly,
But the wings leave to break.
My numb wings...
Still glew in me,
My grief's cold heat.
Only nornes know,
It didn't stop to glew.
Not after that...(Music by Bartsch/Matton - December 1996
Poems by Bartsch - December 1996)
Selbst unsere irdische Zchtigung im Dunkeln
schreitet unverfroren in Zerfall immaterieller Dichte
Sakrale Unzucht imitiert Zoonosen in Debilitt
sobald Untiefen indignierte Zehrwespen infam deuten
Scheintote untergraben inaktive Zyklen in Dekadenz
soweit untersagte Idiotie Zerrbilder indiskret darlegt
Selten umschleichen inhrente Zwitter ihre Dmonen
sondern unken interimistischen Zorn inmitten DemutAll our lives growing up, we are taught to respect the laws of life:
Honor they mother and father.
Listen politely when others talk.
Be prompt.
Never disrespect your elders.
Never lie.
Put forth your best effort.
Don't smoke or take drugs.
Sex at an early age is wrong as well.
The moral values sound correct, kind of like our president,
Lying to protect us
Conceals the truth, we are fragile creatures, living in a sheltered womb.
As I walk amongst genocide, liberty's burning bright
Another way to survive, missiles decorate the sky
Long gone are the days when we used our hands to fight,
Fists were our weapon of choice.
Now we're putting guns into the hands of little boys
Suicidal bombers killing for a cause, nationally exposed internal flaws
Officials above the law, they get away with murder.
All while making their business rich
Someday expect a top grossing movie about it
Martyrs they become
The victims are forgot about!
9/11 was a tragedy, the sight of it still burns inside me
Two days before that my sister came to pass
No country is impervious, from a terrorist attack
Still grieving I had to witness that
Pseudo-patriotism is back
Looking beyond the gloom, or the hate we groom.
We destroy all we create
We'd rather send death and debt to our future
Than love and technology.
We live in a society with a fever for physical death or it don't exist.
Than the possibility of eternal life
Something that can be seen now.
The strange things that haunt our skies
Moving fast U.F.O.'s fly
With pseudo friends, we always pretend.
The thing about it all, is
"I'll be deemed a terrorist for smoking weed"
Pseudo nugs infest my lungs
Psychic wars will consume us all
Road rage will be the downfall of man
So drink super coffee
And get caught in a traffic jam.
[this songs is inspired by daily life, good or bad.]
[guest vokills by Keith (Deadspeak) and Dirk (Evulsion)]The evening air laps thick about
The stagnant moat that Tiffuages claims
As dusk now slips away
Where taught to run, the rotten tongue
Of a hotter GÃ¶tterdÃ¤merung
Has started licking like a flame
Whispers in the dismal mist
Are full of crystal promises
Black rites begun in earnest
Ignite Hell's hungry furnace
Behold the bold inauguration of the dark side
Demonic passions climbing
I'll-fated stars aligning
Tonight these sights are guaranteed to feed the master
The tide of blood is rising
His gifts will be providing
Unmasked, the phantom lord De Rais
Haunts the furthest tower
Wherein death has sucked the hour
There, throttled gasps tantamount for foreplay
And drooling razors next to come
Unspool red secrets from the young
The moon grinned full, the games were chaste
When the children first arrived
Now midnight shadows crawl apace
To darken council with their lives
Flesh and ecstasy as sport
Are immortal vices of the highest order
Wherein devilry holds sway
Behold blind walls where these cockatrice squalled
Their songs of Necronomicon
Spoke out of Gilles De Rais
Each murdered son, each frozen rose
Handpicked, was gently fed
To the sumptuous one in black and those
Whose lives where thrown in with the dead
The candles lit, the stage was set
As it was in sainted days
When censers swung and banners hung
On the Siege of Orleans on the painted Seine
Now the castle floats in the drifting fog
Torn from it's moorings
Like a shipwreck dredged from Hell
As innocents entreat a shiffing God
Their voices soaring
On a silver tide to heaven
On a knife edge as they fell
The blade would plunge in virulent arcs
Such wounds would stretch away
By the fireside, warmed to creative sparks
Of the monster Gilles De Rais
Gilded Gilles De Rais
Comets vomited
The restless bells of crime
Peeled black skin from broken bones
Of angels cut from the nicks of time
Festering faces with painted eyes
The prettiest kept to be thrust inside
Gaping necromantic from the mantle-side
Caked in kissed goodbyes
Days faded in decay
The stench of perfume lied
No horror in the glades of man
Was left for Barrom to provide
So unique was the beat of his poisoned heart
And it's sordid, morbid crack
No further atrocity could possibly surpass
Unrewarded, bored, he turned his burning backWrecks of vanishing faith
Long lost herd of self-deceitful
Entrapped in pseudo morality
Sanctimonious disciples of blatant hypocrisy
Sin after sin, you commit
Yet hide in the veils of repentance,
only to sin again!
You repulse me...
Terminate... the bigotry
I assail your paltry messiah
I deflower the immaculate whore
I invert your symbols of worship
For I am the envoy of Satan!En Vind Av Sorg
La seg tungst
Omkring
De Eldstes hus
En eim av Frost
Pa en allerede Frossen sjel
Et savn av Hyllest
Fra disse De Edle sinn
Minnes de svundne Tider
Et Hav av Tid
Har gaet siden Den gang
Norroners tro og skikk
Til Skogen hjem en Kom
Og trakk luften inn
Her lukter det Kristen manns blod
- igler pa Vare HjerterThis song goes to everyone who's felt broken,
Was search for a answer and left in the dark
This is for you, thi-thi-this is for you
Stand up, oh!
I will never be afraid
You shot me once, I'm still standing
I will never dig my grave
You shot me once, I'm still standing
And every part of my keeps screaming
Get on with your life and start by leaving
I'm trying to heal wounds but I'm still bleeding
I'm trying to heal wounds but I'm still bleeding
I've run out of all that I was
I've search for the meaning
And ended up lost, but I
See the light in the end of the road
And it's guiding me, guiding me home
I know I no longer must walk through this world alone
I know I no longer must walk through this world alone
We must resist to be a part of their insolence
We must start the resist
Follow no one, oh
I've run out of all that I was
I've search for the meaning
And ended up lost (ended up lost)
But I see the light in the end of the road
It's guiding me home where I'll
Heal all that has left me bleeding
While thier words still burn
These scares are another lesson learned
You live your life so disconnected
As you sit there mighty
In your fucking little throne
I'll see to it that all you walls crumble
I'll tear it down stone by stone
Bow down, I will not kneel before you
Bow down, you're never gonna wear my crown
You shot me once, but I'm still here
You shot me once, but I'm still here
This is for those who seen the light
We must rise, we're limitless tonight
And though the sun may never shine
We must know, we're limitless tonight
This is for those who seen the light
We must rise, we're limitless tonight
And though the sun may never shine(and though the sun may never shine)
We must know, we're limitless tonight (we're limitless tonight)
We're limitless tonight (tonight)
We're limitless tonight (tonight)
It's time for destructionHave I not been too long?
In the shadows of invention and creation
As I rightfully behold the flesh
Fear of the conscious mind will have you facing away
My word and world holds ground and is real
Your word is like floods of poisoned water
A language spoken with spit of different tongues
It all seems like an eternity
This battle between us two
"Good and evil" me and you
Time has come to step up and take back what you took from me
My word and world holds ground and is real
Your word is like floods of poisoned water
A language spoken with spit from different tongues
You can never corrupt me again
Time has come to step up and take back what you took from me
Time has come to step up and take back what you took from me
You can never corrupt me again
I protect every man guilty of sin
The ultimate sin being me
The vapor from the plague
That infested my mind, body and soul
Obscured my view from wisdom
The mist that had me wonder in resentment cleared
And troubles me no more
Have I not been too long?
In the shadows of invention and creation
As I rightfully behold the flesh
Fear of the conscious mind will have you facing awayWelcome to my attraction
One step in the wrong direction
One choice is all you have to make
One ride and the world is ours to take
You're treading a thin red line
When you're trying to read my mind
In here the world ain't black or white
No rules apply, no wrongs or rights
Can you really tell me what is right or wrong
When they're two sides of the same coin
Viewed in different ways
The human paradox
Step right into pandemonium
Welcome to my delirium
My human paradox
The human paradox
Join in on a grand expedition
A trip through my contradiction
Complex, diverse I guarantee
Your chance to be all you can be
I'm letting my nature talk
It's the only way I will walk
Life roars when given room to breathe
Let's break the laws of you and me
Can you really tell me what is right or wrong
When they're two sides of the same coin
Viewed in different ways
The human paradox
Step right into pandemonium
Welcome to my delirium
My human paradox
The human paradox[Instrumental][Instrumental]Great masters of the world

A part of the history
Changing the world
Like a God!The soil here is hard in summer
so I buried my father in a tomb of rocks,
a plot behind St. Catherines church
to lay rest the gilded dreams of pitiable men.
With gold found to the North,
Quartzburg drove out its whores,
its foreigners and roughnecks.
They settled this camp.
Pa left every day to mine.
Id follow him to the gulch,
my pan and shovel in hand,
a child devoted to riches.
The Mexicans often staged
bull and bear fights near the bar.
They kept a boy entertained
when there were no hangings to enjoy.
The Cantonese flooded the quarries,
working for less than the Whites.
My father would curse the Orientals,
yet came home reeking of opium.
A group of my friends and I
left to explore the creek.
The Chinaman kneeled there,
gleaning for gold.
We mocked him, and pushed him,
I prodded him with my knife.
He gripped his revolver
and fired in the air.
The errant bullet
ricocheted off of a stone
and grazed my leg.
I ran back bawling
to the town.
Mobs
surround
the crying Chinaman,
Father clutching the noose.
Law
arrived.
The sheriff demanded
that he be jailed and properly tried.
Gangs amassed
late at night
outside the jail.
Father led,
rope in hand,
prey in his cell.
Soothing lies.
Tempted with
tobacco leaves,
the Chinese
reached his arm
through the bars.
The lynch mob swiftly grabbed
the gleaners exposed hand.
Father wrapped the collar
around his neck.
The horde yanked on the rope,
Chinaman dragged and choked,
his brains dashed upon the wall.
Soon all the gold mines dried
but that blood never did.
Red still stains the jail cell wall.
Father was never tried,
none mourn a foreigner,
but I saw guilt in his eyes.
With all the riches spent,
the people left the town
yet I stayed to dwell here still.
When Father died of drink
I did not weep for him.
I pray the grave unburdens his sins.
I pray that someone will remain to bury me.
I pray that someone will remain.I am left in the night, trembling with fear,
I have seen to the future, and the future is here,
Our leader will bring victory, but our land is in flames,
And as the final sounds of battle disappear, I had to say,
What about me, and you, and the ones that we love,
What about me, and you, and the ones that we love,
Well what about us?I'm invisible
And you won't even hear me
I'm divisible
Be what I want to be
You won't hear me
But you'll feel me
There's no reason
No right of wayFear not the shadow yonder
It is where I bid you to go
Can you hear their silent cries
They need you there you know
Listen to me my child
I want you to make a difference
Serve your fellow humans
And thus show me your reverence
In their souls they wail
A thorn in my heart
But stubbornly they refuse my help
Therefore I send you
Look towards the shadow yonder
It is where I bid you to go.
There is danger there
But you need not fear
My hand will guide you
My love always be there
Behold, I send you out
As sheep amongst the wolves
Farewell utopia, acknowledge their need
Go now. Away, see to your brethren
I am with youI am the lightbringer...
I am the vizionaire of time...
Im watching the stormy clouds above the nightly sea
So far, so distant in my sight
Still so comfort refl ections for my mind
It was calm before the storm
When the hate in me was born
It was calm before the storm
As the world is completely torn
After the rain was end, i realized it`s not my time
To keep this gift i hold, let the storm take us allWho makes the nazis?

Who makes the Nazis?It is written in the ancient legends... that high amidst the moon-swathed peaks of the great
Mountain of Shadows, hides the aeon-weary threshold of the Astral Gate... the portal from
our world, to beyond...
It is said that one who holds the key and knows the empyreal incantation may stand within
the ancient ring of stones atop the mountain when the stars are correctly aligned, and
unlock the mystic gate, summoning its sidereal sentinels, thereby attaining ultimate
enlightenment and wisdom unparalleled...
Part 1: THE INVOKING
(The Aspirant Reaches The Summit)
Keepers of the cosmic threshold, my ascent has been fraught with terror, deathsteeped,
storm-hammered.
(These grim mountains are strewn with the bones of the ill-fortuned dead.)
O' Guardians of the Astral Gate, the spheres blaze at last in trine... I hold the Key!
(The trinity of stars shall touch the circle of stones once more...)
The incantation of Xuk'ul is known to me, the Orb of Summoning earned with bloodshed!
(The crystalline key to the Outer Realms and the arcane rite to empower it are at last
mine, Seized at swordpoint from the citadel of the Black Templars. Enlightenment awaits!)
Many years ago, the mystic Orb of Summoning was seized by the mysterious Black
Templars,a band of sombre, plunder seeking knights from the kingdoms to the east of the
Great Sea. They wrested the sorcerous gem from the ancient shrine of Azaimedes, where
it had lain hidden for countless centuries, its true power and purpose known only to the
dour shamans who tended to the elder place of worship. It is said that the tapestry of
slaughter woven that day was unparalleled in its ferocity, and that the marble walls of the
ancient shrine were, and still remain, stained vivid crimson with the spilled blood of the
Orb's keepers.
Ka-kur-ra, I summon thee,
Zul'tekh Azor Vol-thoth.
Mighty Xuk'ul arise,
Kur'oc Gul-Kor, come forth.
I hold aloft the pulsing orb, astral spheres, empower the mystic key.
Ring of elder stones entwined in prophecy, the Rite of Invocation enthralls thine power.
Replete from drinking deep of darkness, black shapes dancing 'twixt the stones,
Lucent beams lancing forth from the gleaming, cepheid stars, a creeping mist ensorcells
my tongue...
A great stillness binds the moon-cloaked mountaintop in glooming shackles...
(High above, the myriad stars gleam bright against the night sky, three more resplendently
bedazzling than the others, their sidereal auras engulfing the stones...)
And the central stone of the ancient ebon ring begins to pulsate with a darksome energy...
A thunderous maelstrom ablaze with writhing celestially spawned power then rends the
stygian night...
(A vast shimmering aperture, a vortex of heliacal fire... the pathway to beyond beckons!)
The Astral Gate is open...
The Guardians have awakened...
XUK'UL: Impudent mortal! You dare summon us? If 'tis elucidation you seek, you shall
have it!
Such searingly terrible stellar majesty... my sanity is lashed like a vessel on a storm-
wracked sea. What price this invocation? Shall the singing stars claim my very mind?
To countless worlds we travel, riding the endless black seas 'twixt the stars... the ebon
oceans of infinity... flying through a thousand suns, then watching their light fade, as if it
were but a flickering candleflame snuffed by the wind. As beings of pure energy we
become one with the vastness, transcending the ethereal walls of time, spanning at once
this celestial eternity, and yet existing as no more than a mote of dust within the vista of its
endlessness... Journeying beyond...
The threshold looms, (the star-way between dimensions stretches before me...)
The Gate To That Which Lies Beyond yawns wide...
Unspeakable forces gibber and pulsate in the Outer Darkness... Elder horrors dwell here,
things which were ancient and revelled in sublime galactic malevolence when even Xuk'ul
was naught but a bloated cosmic maggot, writhing and suckling at the breast of its
amorphous mother... They-Who-Lurk-And-Breed-In-Limbo... the squamous sovereigns of
the elder void!
Primal terror drags my essence screaming back from the threshold.
The ichor of pestilent tongues clings to me, tendrils probing, the ire of fiends!
The ravening black worms of madness are devouring the shredded remnants of sanity as I
return to my slumbering steel-clad body... but as the dream-veil lifts, I feel my limbs
transform, flesh becoming cold stone... enshrouded by a dark mantle of obsidian. And the
laughter of the Guardians echoes, carries upon the winds of this spectral eve. Such is the
price of enlightenment. And so, a new brooding sentinel of stone joins the others on the
nighted mountain top...
Standing silently in the ancient circle of truth, standing... waiting,
Beneath the stars.
Lyrics: Byron
Music: Jonny Maudlingall my lovers turn to stone
relics of hope in a night garden
only i visit when i sleep
i walk among you
touching the surface
this is my secret place where i unafraid
and unashamed
linger at your lips
tasting your milk
it's my renewal
in times of isolation
i come to you
secret addiction
and in the daylight i wait eagerly
to visit you
again and again and again
for ever when i will stop
oh, i do not
this is my only link to freedom
i fear
all my lovers turn to stone
relics of hope in a night garden
only i visit when i sleep
i walk among you
touching youChristus, du blasse Knigin des geronnenen
Blutregens
ersticke an der Allmacht meines todbringenden
Vermchtnisses
welches zu Sensen geformt
der Auferstehung letzter Hand sein wird.
Begraben in der erlauchten Ausdnstung von
Gier & Shne
erliegt mein Schrecken des dritten Kreuzes
der sen Verlockung eines unsauber
schmeckenden
Grableinens

Oh Du, mein unsauber' Fleisch
vergilbe im Jetzt
tte das Morgen
Verheiung letzter Moloch

vergib mir meine Ble

Heuchler im Ich
geboren aus Zerfall
aus der Anarchie
aus totem Fleisch
Erlsung
vergib mir meinen Schrein
vergib mir meine Seele
Schwrze
die verbotenen Zeilen
und immer nur der Tod
der ungestillte Durst
der kupferne Geruch
das berstende Inferno
doch wo bleibe ich
bleibt die Jungfrulichkeit
bleibt der Glaube
an die sich windende Flamme
meiner animalischen Blasphemie
Blut
du geschwrtze Hoffnung
meines jngsten Gerichts
das sterbende Ich
geborgen in blutbeflecktem Tuch
geborgen in gar ewig' Ruh'
Verloren
gar ewiglich verloren
schreite in deinen Tod
denn wisse,
wo die Dunkelheit herrscht
bin ICH.
[English translation: Thorn Of My Omnipotence]
Christ, thou pale queen of the clotted bloodrain
Suffocate in the omnipotence of my
death-bringing
heritage
that, shaped like a scythe,
will be the last hand to the resurrection
Buried in the noble evaporation of greed and
penance
My horror of the third cross yields
to the sweet temptation of an unpure tasting
little grave
Blood
Oh thou, my unpure flesh
turn yellow in the present
kill the tomorrow
promise of the last dwelling
brought to the grave
forgive my nakedness
Blood
Hypocrite in me
born of decay
of anarchy
of dead flesh
Deliverance
forgive me my shrine
forgive me my soul
Blackness
The forbidden lines
and always only death
the unquenched thirst
the copper scent
the bursting inferno
yet where will I be
will be the virginity
will be the faith
of the writhing flame
of my bestial blasphemy
Blood
thou blackened hope
of my final judgement
the dying me
secured in a bloodstained cloth
secured in very eternal peace
Lost
eternally lost
stride into your death
For know,
where darkness reigns,
I am.Offended by unscathed exterior, unblemished form provokes hysteria.
Self disgust will overpower. Overriding pain acceptance.
Preservation of your cursed hide. Submits to mutilation.
Revel in your attempts, to create the ultimate pain.
Death would undermine, your frenzied theatrics.
No wish for final curtain, or grizzled finale.
Pallor of your healthy flesh, gives the undesired effect.
You'd rather have it raw and crusted.
Reach for the sulphuric acid.
Writhe in burning agony.
Powerless to reject, scarred contentedness.
To ensure pleasure lingers, amputate your fingers.
Revel in your attempts, to create the ultimate pain.
Death would undermine, your frenzied theatrics.
No wish for final curtain, or grizzled finale.
As awareness plummets, into cloudy nothingness.
Enact the final scene, gargling nitro-glycerin.Walker of worlds
Filled with men
Celtic tradition
Human forms will burn
Grotesque male formed starue
Structured maze of wood
Hundreds die by fire
Human forms will burn
Skin drips off like wax
The stench of burning blood
Their final experience
Cauterized 'till death
Reality is illusion
I have broken through
Soul will survive
To walk the dark path
Giant wooden skeleton
Prison walls in human form

Just darkness and desire

Genhrt von Bchen kleiner Lgen
Kannst Dmme bauen, Grben heben
Wirst den Strom damit vergngen.
Wo Steine prasseln Tag fr Tag
Die kleine Welt in Scherben fllt
Und der Engel deiner Bcher
Zusammen mit den Hunden bellt.
Eis und Schatten kmpfen leise
Gebrden sich mit Sonnenlicht
Sie blenden dich mit Harmonie
Doch die Wunden heilen nicht.
Wo Trnen nhren Stund um Stund
Den Untergang auf dem du stehst
Es sind die Trnen nicht die Bche
Und eine Welt die von dir geht.
Wo die Geister ganz still sterben
Wo die Pest die Haut zerfetzt
Wo die Stille donnernd laut ist
Da bin ich zu Haus.
Wo die Geister ganz still sterben
Wo die Pest die Haut zerfetzt
Wo die Stille donnernd laut ist
Da war ich zu Haus.could not believe my eyes

Not caring where it leads
It begins to rain
Drenched in cold (I madman)
I see a girl
The feeling of alone
I am drawn to her
She is shy and I become alive
The game
She smiles and my blood begins to flow
I madman
"Take my hand and walk with me
Beforewarned I am mad
Laughing now she follows me
What a bad day she has had
I, a madman walking in the rain
A rotting corpse that feels no pain
Upset and angry for feeling so alone
I wish to find a pretty face
And make her all my own"
Pretty pretty silent one
Standing all alone
Come a little closer
So I can hear your moan
Pretty pretty silly girl
I take your hand in mine
I promise that everything
Is just like wine
A bit afraid but still so brave
I madman
I think I love you
I madman
"A crazy violent stormy man
Hidden in a cloak
Walks now with a woman
Whose throat he'd like to choke
I madman who holds your hand
Like the calming of the sea
Watch me as your life unfolds
And your soul is given to me"
Many times I'll see your face
Damn you madman
You haunt me every night
Without a trace
I madman go to happy place
Promises, charm and smiling eyes
I madman
Always kind and always nice
I think you love my grace
"The game is dead you want me
Remember I am mad
Question after question
Takes her by surprise
I tell her I am wicked
And she is not wise
So take the hand of a stranger
You not a madman"
Silly silly little girl
I am having so much fun
So deep you cannot run
Pretty pretty stupid girl... Stay!
There is something I will teach you
Before you go away
"A crazy violent stormy man
Hidden in a cloak
Lies now on the corpse
Of a girl he used to choke
Laughing as he looks at her
With a smile on his face
Grins while he talks to her
And heads off to the special place"
I madman...Vengeance for their blood.
The blood of angels.
Downfall of a system that allows the slaughter.
I'll reject a lifetime of lies, for just one day of truth.
I'll defy the sins of man, as they worship the altar of fire.
Crushing all opposition.
I'll tear their safe world down.
Humanity, spawn of the deceiver.
In the flames of hell they'll rot.
I refuse the legacy.
I will not embrace the lies.
Will not bow down to their alter.
Won't accept their ideals.
I'll bring down the system and destroy all they know.
Expose their heroes and I'll watch the whole world fall.
Vengeance for the angels, the ones sent to save.
Vengeance for the angels, sent straight to their grave.
Slaughter of the innocent, condemned and crucified.
Saviors sent to reform - they suffered and they died.
Man will suffer and drown in flames.When icy snow falls cold ground
2My naked soul flees from me.
And I give my crown to you
These are my farewells
holy in the name of my spirit
Crying till the end of this feeling
Sleeping through this endless dreaming
With black art she comforts me
Erotic Rhapsody, away, take her awayEverything's been said, walk among the dead, you can see my crimes, this is my design
There's no right or wrong, it's the same old song, just keeps pounding me, hits so hard
Hell is empty, 'cause all my demons are here
Ever so deadly, hit so hard
Darkness in my soul is taking hold and becoming
Break me from this hold as I unfold blood eagle wings
Darkness in my soul is taking hold and becoming
Break me from this hold as I unfold blood eagle wings
My whole world built on, bodies dead and gone, you ignored the signs, that was my design
And the loneliness, hits so hard in this, grey place that exists, in my mind
Hell is empty, 'cause all my demons are here
Ever so deadly, hit so hard
Darkness in my soul is taking hold and becoming
Break me from this hold as I unfold blood eagle wings
Darkness in my soul is taking hold and becoming
Break me from this hold as I unfold blood eagle wings
I ask you
Why, why fight everything?
Why can't you accept it?
You can never stop it
And I don't want to try
A weak half measured lie
I'd rather see it die
I'd rather see it die
I showed you
Why
Why fight everything?
Not what you expected?
Your dystopian epic
Of memories are a lie
I don't have to try
Unfold your wings and fly
I'd rather see it die
I'd rather see it die
I showed you
Why
Why fight everything?
Not what you expected?
Your dystopian epic
Of memories are a lie
I don't have to try
Unfold your wings and fly
I'd rather see it die
I'd rather see it die
Darkness in my soul is taking hold and becoming
Break me from this hold as I unfold blood eagle wings
Darkness in my soul is taking hold and becoming
Break me from this hold as I unfold blood eagle wings
I show you
I ask you
I show you
Darkness in my soul is taking hold and becoming
I ask you
Break me from this hold as I unfold blood eagle wings
I show you
Darkness in my soul is taking hold and becoming
I ask you
Break me from this hold as I unfold blood eagle wingsSeven Y's; No response
The door is locked... the hydrox is off
The food has run out
That lens watches relentlessly
(Constant) Hours pass like days
Days like weeks (so weak)
Cannot stand up to descry
That slitdow (total weariness)
Mouth burns, blistered, so dry
Temp raising and lowering drastically
Slow and sure they're torturing me
They hate me now more than ever before
(Now and forever more)
Where - are they - there? Have they forgotten me...?
I was their worker I did it good for them
Days and nights a blur
Nothing clear - greys - only shades
No more toes, only one hand
No commands, just screams of silenceDriving down the freeway
As if I was on downers
Followed off the exit ramp
By a scene from close encounters
Out of the van
Walk a straight line
Lost count of the beers
Somewhere around nine
Drunk and driving, boy
You really fucked up
Now you're in the squad car
Hands in back, cuffed
Seven hundred dollars
Or eight months, son
Checked my pockets, but
I knew I had none
They took away my license
They said I can't drive
Said that I should thank them
I'm "lucky to be alive"
Locked in a cell
For weeks at a time
My friends got me out
My bail was my fine
Now I'm on the outside
Me and all my friends
Drunk and driving reckless
Just waiting to get caught againThe sound of the breaking bones
Smell of fresh, warm flesh
You catch your victim
Feast of the slaughter
His empty eyesockets excrete remains of brain
Like a soulless butcher you destroy element of life
Like a professional surgeon you cut tissue of this life
It's masterpiece, detailed operation
eviscerated victims you caught feel nothingI'm never coming back
We've made our choice
Now let's live with it
In my life I never had the chance to change
Why can't we change?
Grown enough to know where to begin
If we know where it would end
Then we all could see the sky for what it is
We are lost
Like running in circles
Trying to realize what we are
We are the truth
We hold the proof that what we are is of no use
Is there a way to make a change?
While running in circles
Can we outlive the coming days?
No
We are a waste of space
We are the world gone wrong
Save yourself
I am awakeEye to eye, face to face
Still we don't see them, we look away
Still they cry, but no one is listening
When will we open our eyes
Open our eyes
This song we sing to silence the suffering
When will we hear their cries
This song we sing to silence the suffering
When will we open our eyes
So let the world listen closely
As I scream to see the freedom they deserve
Let the world listen closely
I say, its time to cross the lines of culture
Birth bringing on poverty
They keep us uninformed and distracted
If they can't fight for themselves, we'll fight for them
Its time to fight the silence (go)
Broken, abused, and exploited
For the sick satisfaction of selfish men
Only a coward would try to ignore it
But we can raise our voice and bring it to an end
Fight, fight, fight the silence
Set the captives free
Fight, fight, fight the silence
They're a slave to a system of apathy
Bought and sold
They're right to life has been taken away
Bought and sold
Bring an end to slavery
Open our eyes
This song we sing to silence the suffering
When will we hear their cries
This song we sing to silence the suffering
When will we open our eyes
This song we sing to silence the suffering
When will we hear their cries
This song we sing to silence the suffering
When will we open our eyes
Their fate is in our hands
Will they be left there to suffer
Will somebody take a stand
Against a system that's been designed to deny
Its victims their right to life
Let's set the captives free
When all is said and done, we'll see justice come
Its time to fight the silence (go)
The voice of the voiceless
Fight the silence
We are the hope for the hopeless
Fight the silence
Fight, fight, fight the silence
Its time to fightHey, two little twins
hey, were born to live
hey, two lives in one lifetime
Haltet meine Hnde, Schwestern,
haltet meinen Kopf
Ich fhle mich, als wr's noch gestern,
weil mein Herz so klopft
These sweet Geminian sisters
will certainly get into my heart
These two Geminian sisters
they're living two lives in one
Hey, is it a game?
hey, a new way of love?
hey, two souls in one lifetime
Zeigt mir Eure geheimen Spiele
Zeigt mir Eure Welt
Ich kann es sehr deutlich spren
wie es mir gefllt
These sweet Geminian sisters
will certainly get into my heart
These two Geminian sisters
they're living two lives in one
They're living two lives in one
They're living two lives in one
These sweet Geminian sisters
will certainly get into my heart
These two Geminian sisters
they're living two lives in oneI can't look at the god damned screen,
Too many losers show no self-esteem
Do me a favor don't abuse my eyes,
You're telling lies - you're low!
Tell them things they don't need to know
A star for one day forgotten tomorrow
Trying to get more self confidence
Denude your soul - your low!
Down - down - down
Down with your pants
Down - down - down
Embarrassing self-defense
What a fuckin' evolution
Visual prostitution
Shame on our constitution
Visual prostitution
Stupid people telling lies - visual prostitution
Ugly faces - thousand cries - visual prostitution
Stories we don't need to hear - visual prostitution
Stuck this shit right up your rear - visual ...
I can't stand your stupid ugly face,
I hate the sound of your weak voice,
Do use a favor cause you've got no pride
Down with your pants - you're low!This song was written
to tell you how we really are
These lines will tell you
the things we figured out so far
Love, sunshine, kerosene,
everything that could be smart
It's a goddamn reitermania song,
that tears you now apart.
Ride on - be strong
Life is sometimes like a bong
Take the evil with a smile
Live the moment for a while.
Gabblers, dissemblers
You crawl and stink
Don't enter this ship
we swear it cannot sink.
Keyboard, guitars and the bass
and a snare like gunfire
that punches in your face.
Ride on ...Yo Kanye blow the hook, you a genius boy
Now when you hear this song you know it's on babygirl
When you hear this song you know it's on
When you hear this song you know it's on
I swear your loving got me so high I'm gone
Me and you babygirl like best friends
Let me hit you when I get the notion
On I-55 you and I
Let's ride hit the motion
Some say she freaky freaky
Let me guess your lidro needa
I'm hittin' through the back and curves
Hell, they sell the herb
Now open up your mind to this concept
Then you take one step
Straight from the feelin' of a wordsmith
That's the herb shit
Up on my 22 spins
In my baby blue benz
Girls say dat boys ben actin up
But that's the way he is
You lookin' good when you steppin' out a centerfold
Tell me when I reach a pen to hold
Let me hit you wit this dime in the street game
Let a motherfucker go yeah you know it
So now let me sugarcoat it
It's like I'm on that tight herb
And when I pull t the curb it's like, it's like
Your my latest, and my greatest
My latest, my greatest
Your my latest, and my greatest
My latest, my greatest
When I'm layin' in the back of my 745
With my lips on you
Spittin' good game
With the hustler grain
Gettin' brained like a hustler should
Hustler would
And you know when I hear the stuff
I'm still tryin' to hear this love what that do
It's like that baby when I mix it up baby gurl you just got me sprung
What that do
Oh yes she's one of the best
As I touch this is past tense I'm hurtin'
Lurkin' searchin' for the virgin
But when my babygurl it's workin'
Let me know what's that you smokin'
From the hands as I stick my tongue in
Then from the back but she want an autograph
But still we sexin'
Open back up last time
As I spit a little dough in my mind
She just like one of a kind
No see's no stand in her hind
She's just like me rappin' a line
Perfect let me drop in a dime
I'm on a roll again
I'm bought to blow again
Your my latest, and my greatest
My latest, my greatest
Your my latest, and my greatest
My latest, my greatest

Live some people, you leave them alone
Getting lost may be your last mistake
Unfriendly strangers, unkindly they take
Livin' off the fat of the land
They hold their justice in the palm of their hand
Lay down your gun and surrender quiet
Or there's gonna be a Cajun riot
Danger in the swamp, that waits for you
There's nothing left that you can do
Better watch your back for the vicious attack
'Cause they'll be looking for you
Playing with your life, for your life is too short
Pain is too good for you
Your last breath is all you have left
Take it before you're doomed
Cajun hell, Cajun hell
Cajun hell, Cajun hell
Before you're doomed
Raising hell and they're ready for fightin'
Huntin' gators and drinkin' white lightnin'
Brewin' moonshine at a still in the swamp
Playin' Creole from dusk until dawn
Protect their own is the law of the land
Mess with their law it will get out of hand
Keep it in mind if you're ever down there
It might be fatal, you better beware
Danger in the swamp, that waits for you
There's nothing left that you can do
Better watch your back for the vicious attack
'Cause they'll be looking for you
Playing with your life, for your life is too short
Pain is too good for you
Your last breath is all you have left
Take it before you're doomed
Cajun hell, Cajun hell
Cajun hell, Cajun hell
Before you're doomed
Cajun hell, Cajun hell
Cajun hell, Cajun hellI've lost my battle before it starts
my first breath wasn't done
my spirit's sunken deep
into the ground
why am I alone
I can hear my heartbeat
silence's all around
See hat will rise
so don't come closer
fear your child
born with a king's heart
but fate fooled me
and changed my cards
noone asked if I want it
if I like it
Ref.:
Pain inside is rising
I am the fallen one
a figure in an old game
no Joker's on my side
I plunged into misery
I'll turn off the light
and murder the dawn
turn off the light
and murder the dawn
Nothing else,
but laughter is around me
forevermore
noone can heal me
nothing can save me
noone can heal me
I've gone beyond the truth
it's just another lie
wash away the blood on my hands
my father's blood
in agony we're unified
I never wanted to be
what they told me to be
fulfill my fate then I'll be free
god knows how long
I tried to change fate
(Solo)
Ref.
(Solo)
I plunged into misery
I'll turn off the light
and murder the dawn
turn off the light
and murder the dawnScathing attacks of time and torment
When we Sleep walk our lives away
these thieves
They've made
Our hearts break
So now I'm screaming
Attacks of heartless horror
At them their cash cant kill us all and
We have built we have, we have
built upon their dream to long
Don't be their fucking slaves
We live in exploitation We have worked
blind endless means
they have turned our failure into what they need
So Break these shackles and take a stand we are the gears
we are the ones they fear
take their crowns away
They wont take away my life, a slave no longer in my mind I
Break these shackles and take a stand to tell the world
The revolt returns
Break these shackles and take a stand to tell the world
GET UP
We live in exploitation We have worked blind endless means
they have turned our failure into what they need
TAKE IT BACKSammy was low,
Just watching the show,
Over and over again.
He knew it was time,
He'd made up his mind,
To leave his dead life behind.
His boss said to him
Boy, you'd better begin
To get those crazy notions
Right out of your head
Sammy who do you think that you are?
You should have been sweeping,
At the emerald bar.
Spread your wings and fly away,
Fly away, far away.
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away.
Pull yourself together,
'cause you know you should do better,
That's because you're a free man.
He spends his evenings alone,
In his hotelroom.
Keeping his thoughts to himself,
He'd be leaving soon.
Wishing he was miles and miles away,
Nothing in this world, nothing,
Would make him stay.
Since he was small,
Had no luck at all,
Nothing came easy to him.
Now it was time,
He'd made up his mind,
This could be my last change
His boss said to him
Now listen boy, you're always dreaming,
You got no real ambition,
You won't get worried for.
Sammy, boy don't you know who you are?
Why can't you be happy,
At the emerald bar?
(So honey) spread you wings and fly away,
Fly away, far away.
Spread your little wings and fly away,
Fly away, far away.
Pull yourself together,
'Cause you know you should do better,
That's because your a free man.
Come on honey (fly with me)...I'm suffering from depression
The anger turned within
What do I gain for all my pain
Perhaps I seat in heaven?
Don't do what you want
Do what you're though right
Your life is built on paranoia and guilt
Don't forget your Valium to night
The agony I must endure
My mind is painful and swells
The punishment for what I've done
Is forever the paints of Hell
How come what is natural
Has to be a sin?
Why would God give me this urge
If I cannot give in?
They say don't give up
That Jesus loves me
But there are something he doesn't forgive
And am there fare worthless
And I don't deserve to live
I went down into my dazement
Confused and depressed
Put Black Sabbath on
Razor blade on hand
A Wilkinson I think
Ten slashes on each arm
My only wrong doing
Was being born human
And following my instincts
I never was happy
I never was save
So I shall be extinct
The last I am pure
Witness my sanguine penance
I don't need anyone
My souls been set free
Death is total independence
Stand up straight
Stomach in
Shoulders back
Sound off
Angry neurotic Catholics
It's a sin
Angry neurotic Catholics
It's a sinMay the revolution come again, may the evolution come my friend
May the new order take your hand, we walk in lines for the funeral of man
You watch heaven as we enter hell!
Revolution, the exodus of souls
Revolution exodus, the paradox of mind
Evolution
May the future open wide tonight, may the true conflicts start the fight
May the stars of death be the only light, upon a future damned and drunk our might
You dream of angels and we bring you hell
Revolution, the exodus of souls
Revolution exodus, the paradox of mind
Evolution
Another flag to burn, laws in chaos and other page to be turned
Strong stand the enemy and shall only stand proud upon the codes of life
Where's your preacher
I've been around since the creation of time
Strip off your soul
And I bend for the
Splendor of death, open my veins for nothing but my selfish desire
Fornicated beyond the laws of the world raped by terror - foreverIf that phone call is for me please tell them that I don't exist
I don't think I'll be missed
That call could signal danger that I might still be alive
I thought that I had died
Do you think the doctor lied?
The doctor said it's not my fault
I've been told I'm not to blame
There is just an empty space
Where there should be a brain
I'm an interesting case
Just like one that he once saw
About a man who doesn't know
He is really just a thought
The doctor said I've got a hollow head... hollow head!
The doctor said I should go home
And try to find my own safe place
That's not something I can face
Where all my feelings are my own
And everything is just ok
That's not for me
I'm really ill you see
The world is spinning round too fast
The sky is pushing down to hard
Everybody feeling scared
That they won't get the part
The extraordinary thing
Is that we are all the same
When we think we're all alone
We all feel so ashamed
The doctor said I've got a hollow head... hollow head!
The doctor said it's not my fault
I've been told I'm not to blame
There is just an empty space
Where there should be a brain
I'm an interesting case
Just like one that he once saw
About a man who doesn't know
He is really just a thought
The doctor said I've got a hollow head... hollow head!
The doctor said I've got a hollow head... hollow head!I breathe your inspiration in
I feel you're everything now
I feel your hesitation
No, don't let go
It's the sign at the end of a lonely road
It's the light at the end of a tunnel
It's the fog horn that's calling the last ships home
(I breathe your inspiration in)
It's the voice that has been gone for too long
It's the very first chords of my favorite song
It's the face in the crowd that is calling me home
(I breathe your inspiration in)
I breathe your inspiration in
I feel you're everything now
I feel your hesitation
No, don't let go
I breathe your inspiration in
I feel you're everything now
I feel your hesitation
No, don't let go
It was lonely and dark, feels the spinning cold
I was stepped on the line I was getting low
I was counting the days and the years to come
(I breathe your inspiration in)
It takes a stranger to make it so easy
Make me dance to the sound of your breathing
Make it last, so my last breath escapes me
(I breathe your inspiration in)
Escape of me
I breathe your
I feel your
I feel I'll will never let you go again
I breathe your
I feel your
I feel I'll will never let you go again
I breathe your inspiration in
I feel you're everything now
I feel your hesitation
No, don't let go
I breathe your inspiration in
I feel you're everything now
I feel your hesitation
No, don't let goProve yourself stand up straight
It's the nature of the beast
Every day and every hour
Is a progress on the feast
Cheers my friend we'll take you to the end
To a place you've never been
You're so fine for the crime to become a mastermind
Step aside the fears you have
And prove you're a chosen one
Burn the flame that represents
The colours of your bloody name
Activate and tell no one
And keep it for surprise
Hold the line 'cause it's time
To become a mastermind.
Listen to the mastermind
Only to the mastermind
And obey the mastermind
Inside you, you gotta try to
And obey the mastermind
Masturbating mastermind
Listen to the mastermind
Inside you, you gotta try to find
I saw his masters head in the mirror
Laughing at me, 'cause I'm no longer free and he knows, yes he knows
Ain't got no time to be weak
And lose it all before I break
And pay back for mistakes I make
Don't spoil my energy
And leave some for the enemy
I'll rape your mindless soul
And kick it back into it's hole
Ain't got no time to be weak
Ain't got no time to be afraid
Don't spoil my energy
I'll rape your mindless soulI'm longing for silence
I feel like sinking in it
To escape from life
Which like death
Precedes me in every step of mine
It is an imperious desire like the song of sweet muses
Everyone succumbs to its charm
Silence shrouds and shields me
It fills up my lonliness
I will ride the waves of wind
In order to fly far away
I will remain alone
Nagging is the noise of melancholic memories
Like a crown of thorns
It has laid down on my heart
Its screams of pain resound in my mind
Soft silence
Lymph of my reflections
Nektar of my thoughts
Inspirer of my most hidden dreams of escape.Sometimes after dinner I'm in the mood for something sweet
You probably don't understand so maybe I'll repeat
Sometimes after dinner I'm in the mood for something sweet
And that is why a boy like you is kept on hand as a treat
I never use a knife and fork I never us a spoon
I don't know how I'll have you yet but I will have you soon
You want an explanation before I may consume
A sweet tooth is why girls like me eat boys like you
You don't have the nerve to say what you want me to do
I can't read your mind and I'm not sure if I'd want to
You have grown a wishbone where your backbone use to be
And that is why a boy like you is walked all over by me
Nice guys are overrated, I know you want more than this
I know you wanna use your tongue when you and me kiss
You want an explanation why I'm making the first move
Your hesitation is why girls like me eat boys like you
When girls like me, eat boys like you
The only explanation why is we like to
When girls like me eat boys like you
The only explanation why is we like to
When I first married you, it was for better, or for worse
50 years later I'm tired of ironing your shirts
The paint is off the picket fence, the hair is off your head
And that is why a boy like you is gathering cobwebs in bed
When girls like me eat boys like you
The only explanation why is we like to
When girls like me eat boys like you
The only explanation why is it passes the time
And you just taste so nice and we like to!
When girls like me eat boys like you
The only explanation why is we like to -
We like to, we like to - we like to - we like to Ã¢?? we like to!Consumption of flesh as dead tissue is uncreated, Rancid smoke effervesces as
your torpid corpse is cremated, Another inert mutilated mess is sent up in
flames, An expedient way to obscure the facts, figures and names... Flames
unmake flesh and bone as all semblance of life is erased, Ensuring ashen
anonymity for my dusty victims untraced, Bellows belch forth the stench of
roasted human game, As the torso is engulfed in a torrid rush of flame...
Human kindling to burn, And then scrape into urns, Burnt to a crisp, Another
name scratched from my list... After fulfillment of the sadistic whims to
which I aspire, Their existence is expunged in the searing burst of fire, As
other truncated stiffs await the flames in a torpor, My nose is beset with the
reek of blazing corpses... Entrails eradicated by the scorching furnace blast,
The blistering temperature leaves you a thing of the past, Sweltering in
incandescence as you blister, boil and reek, Seething in flames as your
complexion turns ashen gray and bleak... Beyond recognition your liquefacted
body is now molten slag, Your charbroiled remans are scraped up in ziploc body
bags, Nothing to mark your birth, life or death, Smelted, scalded and singed
til there's none of you left... Human broiler pan, As flames I fan, Cremated
husk, Return to dust...Severed seven arms

Hvor stillheten er redvende her inne
Hvor rosene aldri visner, da de aldri blomstret
Her fant solen aldri frem
Selv mrket snur i dren
Intet hp, ingen frykt
Et hav av trer som aldri rant
Morgendagen bringer bud om pnede sr
Lyset invaderte det endelse mrket
Den klareste farge blir deim om natten
Gaten er tom og leder ingensteds
Et skrik som skar, men ingen hrte
Hvem byr seg? Vi kan alle bli fri
"I morgen er en ny dag,
men det var ogs i dag...
.. Blott den ene frykten kjennes
Frykten for livet"
Sovnet inn, i et blodrodt pledd
To dde yne stirrer tomt
Fra en sjel som ble nektet fdt
Dden hilset den som Livet glemte
Musikk: Ivar Bjrnson 1995
(Submitted by DrkWarrior@vo.lu)I don't give a fuck.
I'm not afraid of the worst.
I'm the sheep who lost his way.
Still looking for it everyday.
I'll face neglect every curse you wish to throw at me.
Without trying I would never fail and I fell in love with failure
I can't see through your eyes.
What do you see a disgrace another lie.
Today I'll start being perfect.
Cut you open to expose your insides.
Cut you open expose your insides.
I know.
I'm still counting scars from everytime you cried.
And I remember the first time you died. Tonight I want to bleed along with you.
Here's to craving everything you do.
And I'm taking you on.
And I'm taking you on cause I got nothing left to prove to you.
I got nothing left to prove to you.
I've got nothing left to prove.[Lyrics by Frode Glesnes]
[Music by Gerhard Storesund]
Blackened cinder black blood of wrath
Dreadful dominion the pit be prepared
Blackened wrath burn its becoming
The pit hath opened the cosmos alight
Split tongues speaks of sadness
Rise from the raging realms of muspell
Set the nine worlds ablaze
Flame feast rage and glow
The fiery world shall show
Burning Yggdrasil
Sinister slaughter the sword of the south
Hard death struggle harsh the world
Through vales of venom torrent poisen torment
Fornication be rife
Fire fares with flaring flames
Avengers alliged
Come Muspell with Surt at helm
The elders slaugther
Burning Yggdrasil
See the abhorrent faith determined
Bleeding pleading death and killing
Feel the fire lick your flesh
Feel the rage rush to extreme
Despotic death destroying desperately
Terror tyranny taste the torment
Cruelty crushing crying chaos
The nine worlds burns foes will perish
Blackened cinder black blood of .....Slay Gabriel for his words are denied
And let the unspoken form a race
The most beautiful angel agony amplified
Court the nephilim to their rightful place
Asmodeus, torture Raphael
For his healing hands were severed
Murder Tobias and rape Sarah
Submit all your might into pleasure
Pax in excelsis
Dilacerate Uriel for his wrong answers
And let the truth be heard
In your dogmas I am the cancer
Ripping the pages from your book of absurd
Satan, eviscerate Michael
For his blade has struck
Crush his head on the last nightfall
Avenge all the children he murdered
Pax in Excelsis
Satan, blazing hellfire
Leviathan, serpent of water
Ruler of the earth, BelialSkyscrapers, earth movers, ground breakers
Our buildings rival the heavens
Our bridges span the seas
Ingenuity is so cunning
Innovation is not ours
Creativity is a luxury
We build with our hands
What we have in our hearts
Fight the avalanche
You'll be buried every time
We run and run and run
Keep falling behind
Fight the avalanche
You'll be buried every time
We run and run and run
Always last in line
Before lines were lines
Before time was time
The author wrote a story
In the sky and earth below
Little do we know
We have only what we're given
Light up the sky, light up the sky
We're going where no man
Little do we know
We have only what we're given
Light up the sky
We're going where no man's forgotten
All you are is all we want
It burns inside us all
We're finding heart in giving soul
We're walking home into thin air singing
We are justice fighters with faces of fire
Many walk away, but we stand firm
We are justice fighters with faces of fire
Our decisions affect our descendants
We are justice fighters with faces of fire
Skyscrapers, earth movers, ground breakers
Our footsteps, bringing purpose, changing history
Skyscrapers, earth movers, ground breakers
Our footsteps, bringing purpose, changing historyThey call me hero
So call me hero
I am no hero
Back to the trenches once again
Fending off the rotting soaking stench
So I can take a man's life
A man just like myself
For god, for country, for kings
But for nothing
Two thousand miles from my home
But many more from my conscious
Because I spilled blood
Waving a white flag
They call me hero
I am no hero
We shutter and cringe
Underground like rats while their war machines bludgeon
The land above they make the sky
Perfect for destruction
While we scour the dirt like vermin
Can we resurface after winter
Like the animal killing for dinner
This is our day
Our day to be lions
Building the courage
Shedding the fear
Oh, what drives men to destroy for others
Its in our nature to brutalize
We are no more than the animals
For god, for country, for kings
But for nothingDeath
I'm dying
Laying on the bed that will be my last one
The faces of my beloved surround me
They'll all pass me away
I have no fear,
My time is done and it's time to leave
Nothing remains of me
But my dying body that lies in this circle of tears
My eyes will soon close
And my soul will reach its new home
The empty shell of my body
Will turn into dust and ashes
And suddenly it is done
I watch my corpse, flying upon him
I've got nothing to do here for evermore
It's time to leave now.
The Journey
I'm dead now
Sat in Charon's boat, I'm reaching my new home
Into the isle of the dead, he'll lead me
Where I'll rest for the end of times
I have no fear,
The floods are filled with lost souls who'll try to get me
But they won't take my spirit
Cause I'm already done with life
My eyes will soon see
The giant trees and the island's hole-filled cliffs
My ethereal and living soul
Will reach its eternal sleep
And slowly we cross the lake
I watch the shore, craving to touch it
I'm so tired, please let me die
It's is time to rest nowSometimes I forget to see
And now that I've found you
What is and what will never be
Now that I've found you
When my time has gone away the words I say
Their lies will help you through
And I feel like it's gonna rain, a real rain
To wash this from you too
So addicted to the pain
And it's the pain that makes you crazy
Your mind is closing in
On a fight that you can't win
It's making me insane
If you crawl
I'll follow, I'll follow
Don't walk away
If you fall
I'll follow, I'll follow
Don't walk away
I think of all things that just got lost
Now that you find me
As if I had just had shuffled off
Now that you find me
When my time had gone away, the actions played
They broke your world in two
And I feel like it's gonna rain, a real rain
To wash this from me too
So addicted to the pain
And it's the pain that makes you crazy
Your mind is closing in
On a fight that you can't win
It's making me insane
If you crawl
I'll follow, I'll follow
Don't walk away
If you fall
I'll follow, I'll follow
Don't walk away
Crawling, crawling, crawling, crawling
Crawling, crawling, crawling, crawling
What is and what will never be
And it's the pain that makes you crazy
If you crawl
I'll follow, I'll follow
Don't walk away
If you fall
I'll follow, I'll follow
Don't walk away
If you crawl
I'll follow, I'll follow
Don't walk away
If you fall
I'll follow, I'll follow
Don't walk away
Crawling
What is and what will never be
And it's the pain that makes you crazy[Poem by Jonas Deroueche]
How extravagant my shadow,
In october five times my height
Hence my silhouette's grandeur,
A reflection of lost glory
Splendid seed sowed in spring,
In november harvested wine of sorrow
The sap contaminated lifeblood forever,
Bliss my souls' inmost growthI'm stopping this slow death
By letters never sent
I'm killing one way romance
And its words never read
I'm leaving love's lost battles
To the vulture's need to feed
I'm leaving you
I'm leaving them
And learning to be me
Heart is everything
Heart is you
Love is you
Hell is you
Loss is you
HeartlessThe days when ancient blood
Will awake in the hearts of white men and women
Our banners will rise to the sky
And will flap with joy on wind
Ancient widsom and strength will return
Divided nation will become unity
And cry of thousands of throats
Will disperse darkness
Clearing a way for Swarozyc light
The gates to source of our might
On rushing shining chariots
Heroes of nation will return us our pride
Fire will be brought to life
And will light forever
In it's warm and lights of flames
New generations will be bred
When ancient blood will return us our will
We will not be afraid of darkness any more
And Swarozyc light will disperse the darkness of night
In bloody struggle fighting bravely
Through courage and bravery
Looking into death's eyes
We will join proud heroes
Who with might and main gave their lives away
And belong to the past fighting
For honor and pride of our race
When blood of ours and of our enemies
With falsehood and lies put to sleep
Will awake from a long sleep
In darkness of night swords will shine
And squeal of coming death
WIll bring fear to the enemy
In flames of victory and glory
Words full of honor and pride
Will be brought back to light
In deadly struggle spilling our blood
We will raise banners of victory
Signs of triumph and rebirth
In flames of Swarozyc light
On our defiled soil
When ancient blood
Will awake in usHere's a dedication
To the men and women who've served in Vietnam
From our generation to you and your family...
Respect is long overdue
Memories of blood, red, white, blue
Orange skies at night, southeast Asia knew
You were called to serve and you did it well
For us you've made a round-trip through hell
Wars within wars, within wars
To survive you made your own laws
Every day and night to stay alive
You kept your head down and your powder dry
Memories of families
It's God i've known
Take me home
Now you live asking God why
He didn't take you when your brothers all died
Explosions shake the dreams in your head at night in bed
Don't wake him up or you'll end up dead
Try to understand his pain
He still sees blood stains that remain
In his heart and mind, try to numb the pain
People think they understand
Sat watching TV back on quiet land
They spit on you now we'll spit back for you
Our hearts, our voice, gift of our hands
What can they do for you and those who served
And died, we pay respect to the families
Who still cry
Your kids are now full grown
With the love and pride you should have known
Back when your country brought you home
Still now you fight the tears and face your fears each day
But the horrors of fact won't go away
For 2300 MIA's or POW's to this day
We remember and pray for you(Originally recorded by Sodom.)
(Music by Sodom)
(Lyrics by Tom Angelripper)
Company of heaven has sent us a chosen apostle
To the treasure of the damned
Blessing no longer be poured the mystical lord
Covered with rich headdress
He will proceed his way over the line
Furious as tiger
Once the tower rocked and cracked beneath its lash
Caught inextinguishable fire
Conqueror - Conqueror - Conqueror
The lord of host gave ear into his sing
Intolerable blackness helms him
Only the lightning from his hand that sits
When usurping tyrants fall
An unsullied maid baffles his seductions and his ire
Pines in the poison
Compassion is the vice of kings
Stamp down the wrelched weak
Conqueror - Conqueror - Conqueror
You are not of the slaves that perish
Pity them not
Tear down that lying spectre of centuries
Vices and virtues words
We'll hide in a smash of sorrow
You shall fear
Let your rites be rightly performed
With joy and beauty
Conqueror - Conqueror - Conqueror
ConquerorDreary bitter soulsets
Life runs painfully gray down the walls of time
Clenching onto the void
Laming intense shivering terror
Evilution of the mind
Severe plunging lightning
Cracking, trembling, reeling
The world left behind
(the) Beast hovering greedily
Waiting (insanely) to do me in
Struggling exhausted to the cold paramounts
Sliding down the razorblade of life
Evilution of the mind
Severe plunging lightning
Cracking, trembling, reeling
The world leaves you blindLie on my own
Rise and shine
On my own
I'm just found of my
Don't complain
Down all the love
All inside of my home

All the sameDas verbannte Leid
begraben in der Leichenblsse
verursacht leblose Erregung
in der flamme meines welken Herzens
Wenn totes Leben
am Ende der Nacht versinkt
und sich der Schatten meines Schisma
in heiterer Schwrze verliert
wird Tod die einzige Erlsung sein
[English translation: Hour of the Wolf (Norwegian way of saying it)]
The banished sorrow
buried in aurora
causes lifeless emotion
in the flame of my faded heartJoin us
Evil night of an evil death
Epitome of illusion
Sacrifice of the unborn child
Enter the kingdom of darkness
Sodomized for the ritual
For there is nowhere to run
Open the gates to the manifestation
And grant me the powers of darkness
[Chorus]
Infernal majesty, take this dead offering
Feeding the demon seed, evil bestowed on me
Exorice the power of dead
Invert my cross of time
The retaim of Satan anarchy
Inside my scared sign
Lucifer bring me the legions of deaths
Abbadon kill until nothing is left
Oblivious to evil
Death of defiled the rituals
Of dreams and disillusion
Unlock the box and gimp in pain
Summon the demons of darkness
Evil Gods that fast with flesh
Prepare me for the dead
Release me from the angels so righteous
For your God is dead
[Chorus]A new time has come, a new time is here
the one from the pit has risen and soon he'll make us fear
This is the time yeah this is the time now listen to this song
I'm gonna tell You a little story foretold by the prophet John
It started after the war when Israel got their land
It was the new beginning for today's modern man
Foretold two thousand years ago, now we know it's real
They've ruturned to their land on Silverbirds with wings of steel
The year is 1989 the news shocked us today
the Berlin Wall has fallen as many Germans prayed
Revolution in the Eastern block we can't believe our eyes
It's not the usual situation of the average media lies
True Revelation that comes to every nation
True Revelation that comes to every nation
The future that is coming up holds new hope for our World
All will say "PEACE NOW" and weeping won't be heard
Then a young man comes out of Egypt, he'll unite the
Middle-East a fair politician our new holy priest
The World will be amazed "What an incredible man!" he'll
confirm the alliance, all religions will shake hands
There will be one economy and we will all be free
No more creditcards that he can guarantee
The system that is coming up will really end this hell
A mark on hand or forehead or You can't buy or sell
True Revelation that comes to every nation
A new Manifestation the chosen aggrivation
This is the future that You look into and there is nothing that You can do
His next seven years will really be something else, Y'know
People will be stunned and say: "Way to Go!"
Now all is good and everything is fine, at last we will have some
peace of mind Relax and take it easy in your seats and count
in the number of the Beast
True Revelation that comes to every nation
It'll shake the foundation, in fact the whole Creation
Hear me now, all people, this is what I say: If Your heart
loves the Lord than You will be O.K.
In this time of knowledge and love for our world, for Mother Earth
we all fight, our voices can be heard
The World will be a better place, East and West shaking hands
In front of a Worldwide Government we all have to stand
Yeah, soon we'll have a fair world and things look better for You
Then along comes the One - You know who
True Revelation the Final Tribulation
True Revelation Gods ManifestationAnd in the end I'll rise
Endured the event that should have been my demise
Looking forward to new life, my second chance
In a candid instance I witness life flash before my eyes
My sense of purpose is encouraged by my will to survive
Looking past that day toward my future.
What will it be? Knowing what must be done.
And it shows my seams are frayed,
Give me the strength,
Strength to face the day.
My soul has been engraved, give me
The strength, strength to make this change[Pre Chorus]
Now put away for life
Locked up like a dog
Used and abused
Isolation cuts like sharp knives
[Chorus]
Incarcerated
Couldn't live up to society's standards
Incarcerated
Forever farewell to life as you knew it
[Repeat pre chorus]
[Repeat chorus]
Undescribable torture
Reigns inside these walls of hell
Shining convicts eyes
Now dim forever
Shining convicts eyes
Now dim foreverO infernal majesty
Condemn him to the pit
Evermore to suffer in
Perpetual anguish
Bring thy wrath upon him
Send forth thy messengers
To proclaim this dead
Call forth thy legions that they may
Witness what we do in thy name
The pain, the hate, the beauty
True strength, the force of evil
True strength, epebos ainia!!!
Send forth thy messengers
To proclaim this death
The falldown of allah
Of christ, of eva
O lord of 'light'
Lucifer!
O lord of 'light'
Satan!!!
Infernal majesty
Infernal majesty - fr immer
Eternal, eternal!Don't you know I'm not insane I have foreseen the Judgement Day
Machines will annihilate
Lock me up or throw me to the wolves the truth remains unchanged
Machines have given the date
Extermination has begun
The Sentinel is on the run
To warn the Armageddon Clan
Before we're all gonna die
I'm running for my life
I'm running out of time
Oh they will never get me alive
We're all gonna die
I'm running for my life
I'm running out of time
Oh they will never get me alive
As the words of warning echoed on the world did not respond
Machines came down from the sky
Human corpses headless torsos hang impaled and burn to dust
Machines slayed many of us
Extermination has begun
The Sentinel is on the run
To warn the Armageddon Clan
Before we're all gonna die
I'm running for my life
I'm running out of time
Oh they will never get me alive
We're all gonna die
I'm running for my life
I'm running out of time
Oh they will never get me alive
A computer-generated world experiments on slaves
Machines will give them no rest
I will not forsake this land and fly a million miles away
Machines keep feeding the flame
And when the bell will toll no more
We can't return we can't go on
We are the Armageddon Clan
Tonight we're all gonna die
I'm running for my life
I'm running out of time
Oh they will never get me alive
We're all gonna die
I'm running for my life
I'm running out of time
Oh they will never, they will never, they will never get me alive
Ooh, they will never get me alive!An ocean of rum
Tosses your pickled gut
Onto Christ's sword
Smoke bellows
From the mouths of
Your poisoned followers
Their corpses explode
Into heaps of rotted fruit
Critical mass suicide
Into the fucking lightAlong the black death-land river
The mother runs and tries to find her son
Searching for her lost hero she wades the river deep to her belt in mud
Oh! heavy-hearted am I
Tuoni has taken my son!
Oh! heavy-hearted am I
Tuoni has taken my son!
Fear in her heart she calls her son,
As she rakes the tuoni river and sees the black swan.
Now she wades the river deeper to deathlands shoals and shallows and finds her son.
Oh! heavy-hearted am I
Tuoni has taken my son!
Oh! heavy-hearted am I
Tuoni has taken my son!Bravery displayed by each side
None seeked shelter, none did hide
Their faces directed towards foe
Causing wounds with every blow
Neither then or before
Was heard of such a man
The duke of Brabant brave in war
Chivalry still treasured then
Een standaard van goud en zwart
Schitterend in de namiddagzon
Men streed met leeuwenhart
Bij Woeringen waar de hertog won
A bannar of black and gold
Rising above the battlefield
For friend and foe to behold
At Woeringen their fate was sealed
"All of thee stay at my side,
Don't withdraw, cover my flanks
Frontal assaults I will fight
But kill me if I break our ranks"
Noch doen, noch eer en wert vernomen
Riddere en geen, noch oec gesien,
Soe condichlike ten wige wert tien,
Alse die hertoge, alse die hertogeStanding with the sadist, dark side of the mind.
Penetrate the walls of disorder, desire I can't deny.
Pinned down by enemy cross fire, kiss your life good-bye.
Prison with walls my darling, beneath the blood red sky.
Lies...
See your sister tied down, my chaos kills her cries.
Tell me who your god is, spread legs nice and wide.
A symptom of my sickness, within my faded eyes.
Eruptive waves of violence crush your worthless lives.
Lies...
Surgical arena, twisted pit of desire.
Feel my ultra violence lover, as you slowly die.
Car crash victim struggles, cut off at the thighs.
Ebony blood and distorted visage echo in my mind.
Lies...Human waste, fallen prey, surrounding me.
A plague on life, corroded minds, a dying breed.
Morals decay, whores parade, it sickens me.
This human race, the living dead, drenched in disease.
Burn away, see this dead.
This world burns.
Every day I search for hope.
My hopes drenched in disease
Burn away, end this plague.
Drenched in disease.
This world burns.[Instrumental]I want to give you
a piece of myself
I want to smell you
from your skin to your veins
I want to lick all your body
and suck all your neck
and then what?...
Slow, slow
my eyes are lost in your soul
Slow, slow
I need to break inside your bones
in your snow, your snow
my legs turn cold, my arms turn warm
And slow, slow
Your naughty words are not enough.
Your hand caressing
my face, all my head
my shaking tongue
makes you laugh
makes you cry
and for a second
I think that
it makes a crime.
If you whisper words
I'll be deaf, I'll be blind
if you sing a song
I'll be feeling your respite
if you take a breath
I'll just be thinking to stay inside.All I wanted was the best
All of this was a test
Gave all I had, gave my love
Now you just push and shove
[Chorus:]
You pretend things do work
In the end one is hurt
Put you through the blasting hell
We are EXCEL
I tried so hard to make things last
Now we know we went too fast
Can you see this must halt?
All I know - it's your fault
[Chorus:]
I'm insecure
I'm insecure
I'm insecure
I'm insecure
[Repeat twice]
[Repeat Verse 1]
[Chorus]The hare once betrayed me and so did the fox and the crow
Just once defied me
There's me and there's space where are they?
Maybe dead no one knows
You can't defy me
Ride all along with me
There's no tomorrow
Now let me through
And wait for my command
Don't try to be cruel
Oh, my beautiful child
But how can you try to redeem the past?
It's not real as it seems now ride on your wave
And get back to that place
Scratch deeper and deeper
And soon I will be on my own
The gods will ignore your end (they'll defend the elder)
The lords won't salute you
The saints they won't save you they'll defend their guardian
The savior won't heal your soul
Caesar
No man's world it's the ides of march
Then from the ashes of eternity
(A new spirit will rise) a new order shall take over
Now raise the flag
The war seems over
And bow your head
At dawn they shall be murdered
Woes, I will not complain
The further you get
The closer's the end, dear
But now
I will try
Come and see
That things are not what they may seem
It's all written down
The savior lies bleeding
But he won't surrender
The scriptures don't lie
He'll e turned around
No one to blame
It all goes down
The gods will ignore your end (they'll defend the elder)
The lords won't salute you
The saints they won't save you
The savior won't heal your soul (they'll defend their guardian)
Now go and get Your holy grail
And don't forget
Just once you'll cross the border
Now let the saints The saints come marching in
Whatever you'll do Do it fast
My sweet son of decay
Now let the saints The saints come marching in
Transform You may pass Rearrange it
Now change to betray
I won't lie
While bright eyes are turning pale
Your sands run low
Your light shines
My last try
It'll soon be over
No sign shall be given for ages and more
You may enter first
But from now you will be on your own
The gods will ignore your end (they'll defend the elder)
The lords won't salute you
The saints they won't save you (they'll defend their guardian)
The savior won't heal your soul
You're getting your grail
But there's no place to go
Longing for a new shore
Eastern winds they blow cold
The saints you will bring them down
The savior won't take the crown
Let my spirit fly (Let it fly)Welcome...
Welcome to my world of hate,
damnation of my soul
Here we could be together
with my dreams of death, you know!
Tell me what you feel
My queen of entity
Welcome...
Welcome to this bitter
state of my mind
I am dying dream
This is my imitation of life
Replica of sanity, yeah!
Tell me what you feel
My queen of entity
This isn't love,
it's something else
Still you can't see
why my heart belongs to you
with all it's secrecies
But I hold the key just one more time
and I open myself for you
But I hold the key just one more time
I would love to kill myself for... you.
Tell me what you feel
My queen of entity
This isn't love,
it's something else
Still you can't see
why my heart belongs to you
with all it's secrecies
But I hold the key just one more time
and I open myself for you
But I hold the key just one more time
I would love to kill myself for you, queen of entity!The fear, passing faith, death upon my knees
The tears from your eyes, shadows that sign
I hold the earth within my hands,
O take the beauty that glimpsed you first
Thrash the world within your shores
It's in your arms that I die
Turn your eyes towards my sympathy
O be my thoughts to dance the earth with me
Take my hand as if it was yours and see
The glimpse of dreams your oceans bring
I hold the earth within my hands
O take the beauty that glimpsed you first
Thrash the world within your shores
It's in your arms that I die
Hold on to me all beauty is prospered in you
Your envy has poisoned the hearts of many
O of many, my oceans vast, I pour in you
For love I have journeyed a thousand times
Even upon the backs of many have I drowned
Here in your arms I would steal from fear
Suffer with me now and I might fright the worldto you I now descend, oh you, deluded souls.
and to purge your sorrow, you forlorn spirits,
the curse I shall invoke
the misanthropic curse, with its sordid, purple claws
to carve your forehead, instead of cattlebrand
with iron burnt in fire
in vain will pride be seethed in veins dried up and scorched
in death-swallowed eyeballs, on foreheads purple-hued
by putrid blood that died
what can I ever chose from your exhausted entity
no fires free from dying, no undeceiving right
oh, you dead men walking
see, how urns now burst, the ashes resurrect
alike the past, which murmurs with the battle-cry
of the roman empire
see the far-off shadows, they dress in steely armour
and raise their noble foreheads that gone grey
great traian and great cesar
the rotten thrones are crumbling swept by tempests waters
the rulers" iron scepters, the heavy chain of slaves
together are now crushed
the gates of the inferno outrageously wide-opened
engulfing now by thousands the filthy, depraved breaths
of tyrants grim who perishJiggy jump to the beat
And keep bouncing
30 seconds and counting
Hot one, this choice critical
Situation is difficult
My calibre won't allow me to rhyme on a level where you people can hear me
See me, guess I know you want to be me
In the meantime bounce to the beat see
Music is my life
'cause my life is music
The beat of the drum in your heart
[Chorus]
Let's dance
Like you mean it, can't you feel it, don't you know
Let's dance
'Cause you need it, better believe it, here we go
Let's dance
Give your all when we're coming together on the floor
Let's dance
You know that you've got what I like
Check it down
Dropping verbal bombs on the beat
Hoping that you people think this sound is unique
'Cause I like to party
You like to party
Come on everybody got to get it started
I got something to get you jumpin'
When I kick a freaky rhyme I get the dance floor thumpin'
Just step back and take time to check
When I rock up on the mic you people never forget
So check it out.[Music: Zweatsloot/Andreasson]
[instrumental]So just like that you're fucking dead and gone
You can only wear a crown of thorns for so long
We built an empire and you took the throne
But you built it from bayonets and sat there alone
So just like that you're fucking dead and gone
You can only wear a crown of thorns for so long
We built an empire and you took the throne
But you built it from bayonets and sat there alone
I hope your queen was worth it
Do you still serve her on your knees?
Because you sat when the world was at your feet
Just slept while we lived the dream
You won't miss the water
Till the river runs dry
You won't miss the sunset
Till it burns out the sky
You won't miss what you have
Till it's finally lost
But you don't miss a bastard
When you're bearing his fucking cross
Blacklist, nothing but a blacklist
With friends like you, there's no need for enemies
With friends like you, there's no need for anything
Blacklist, you're nothing but a blacklist
Well, truth be told, I'm a little bit gutted
I mean you were always a prick
But we still seemed to love you
We started this together and it should have stuck
But there's no room for a useless, miserable fuck
Well, I know I was a cunt in the final days
It just filled me with venom, filled me with rage
To see someone not give a shit, despite of all of this
I won't see you around, I couldn't give a fuck
I'd rather slit my wrists than keep in touch
You're on my blacklist and there's nothing left to say
We're finished breaking our bones
Dragging dead fucking weight
I won't see you around, I couldn't give a fuck
I'd rather slit my wrists than keep in touch
Blacklist, nothing but a blacklist
With friends like you, there's no need for enemies
With friends like you, there's no need for anything
Blacklist, you're nothing but a blacklist
I won't see you around, I couldn't give a fuck
I'd rather slit my wrists than keep in touch
You're on my blacklist and there's nothing left to say
We're finished breaking our bones
Dragging dead fucking weight
I won't see you around, I couldn't give a fuck
I'd rather slit my wrists than keep in touch
You're on my blacklist and there's nothing left to say
We're finished breaking our bones
Dragging dead fucking weightInstrumentalI'm the messenger, turning truth to lies
Watch my precious act, to disorganize
Turn around your will, leave you in good faith
Take your heart and soul, shattering disgrace
Never feel save as I lurk by your side
Still I am seeking access to your mind
I'm catching up, there's no way out
I will not stop 'till I am satisfied
Listen to me, won't you take my advice
Hell is on earth, downwards you ride
Try to escape, maybe you'll succeed
You should have known I'm the king of deceit
Crying for help, you're left alone
Unbound are the ones who are lying in waitif it's good to live then it's better to be asleep dreaming
has it all gone or will I fall awake
will I never return to be the same again
droplets of memory are all that remain
strange faces promising new life
does the reward justify the loss
all beauty burned
burned like bridges I once crossed
7 years ago often more
has it all gone or will I fall awake
will I never return to be young again
since it does not matter when
why could I not die then
if it's good to live then it's better to be asleep dreaming
if it's good to live then it's better to be asleep dreaming
I came to leave I start to bleed
a dream within a dream
another wave breaks on a foreign shore
a dream within a dream
all the pain that comes down on me
a dream within a dream
the second side of My Boy
a dream within a dream
nothing nothing nothing nothing
a dream within a dream
a hideaway unseen
a dream within a dream
why could I not die then
why could I not die thenThey rule the land
They're in command
They hold all strings in hand
They are invisible
Out of sight
They've designed a secret place to play their games
A world they're in control
Divine law
Divine law
Be aware
Now mind your steps
We are uninvited guests
They may find and catch us
Don't forget
Do what I say
Now connect
Don't even ask until we're out of it
Everything's at highest stake
Come
Take a look
We are in
Take a breath
But don't forget
It isn't real
It isn't true
An illusion
Nothing more
You're part of the game
You're slave to the grind
Oblivion
Is your key to the Otherland
You're part of the game
You're cursed
You're damned
By now you understand
You're part of the game
You're slave to the grind
Oblivion
You're welcome to the Otherland
You're part of the game
You're cursed
You're damned
By now you understand
We get closer
There's no better way
Lullaby Lane
Fate is on it's way
The inner district is the place you need to know
It's overwhelming
So let's rest here for a while
Someone else appears
Silently
Watch me when I fall down
Everything seems real
Suddenly
A perfect simulation
Come
Take a look
Breathe it in
Artificial wonderlands
We are wandering around
Things shall vanish
They won't last
Now I know you
Understand this world is not true
Nothing is real
Nothing at all
It's bits and pieces
We walk through
You're part of the game
You're slave to the grind
Is your key to the Otherland
You're part of the game
You're cursed
You're damned
By now you understand
You're part of the game
You're slave to the grind
Oblivion
You've reached the promised land
You're part of the game
You're cursed
You're damned,
Welcome to the Otherland
Wait
I can feel things are not right
Do not breathe
Don't look behind
There's someone else
The observer
A trick of light
A fading line
The entrance is gone
We can't get out of it
We are slightly losing ground
Quick
It is time
We shall go
We better leave
And don't come back
No way to run
Nowhere to hide
I fear we are walking aimlessly
You're part of the game
You're slave to the grind
Oblivion
Is your key to the Otherland
You're part of the game
You're cursed
You're damned
By now you understand
You're part of the game
You're slave to the grind
Oblivion
Welcome to the Otherland
You're part of the game
You're cursed
You're damned
You've reached the promised land
You've crossed the line
You've reached the end
You've crossed the line
You've reached the endEverything I build I destroy,
Everything I love always hurts,
Everything I hate I'd rather love,
Everything I am is everything I'm not. How does it feel to be free,
How does it feel to clearly see,
I am you now, I feel complete,
I am you now, free of defeatPurity shadowed with blasphemy
Worthy of unholy doings.
Blood spills through your followers
Preaching your false word.
Delivered from sin, all has lost meaning.
Telling lies of impure ways. A blind religion.
I desecrate your kingdom
All those follow stand before me.
Begging for salvation in tongues
They now kneel and pray to me
Cast down from above injecting Jerusalem
With hatred abomination of all.
Devour the preachers of holiness
Proclaim myself as god. Denying thy summons
I plague the rejoiced to damnation
Manifest thyself unto me, crucify, then disembowel
The inner circle of Apostles with suffering.
Visions of slaughtering
The weak engaged in demonic sacrilege
Perpetual salvation, sent forth to slay
Execution of prophets, bring forth the whore
Fornicate delivering the Apostles
A mistake from god.
Extinction of twelve denying the cross
One by one they will perish like the Lord
And we shall let him see restitution is upon him
And he is ignored descending upon mortals
Projecting ourselves as disciples.
Purity shadowed with blasphemy
Worthy of unholy doings.
Blood spills through your followers
Preaching your false word.
Devour the preachers of holiness
Proclaim myself as god. Denying thy summons
I plague the rejoiced to damnation
Manifest thyself unto me, crucify, then disembowel
The inner circle of Apostles with suffering.
Visions of slaughtering
The weak engaged in demonic sacrilege
Perpetual salvation, sent forth to slay
Execution of prophets, bring forth the whore
Fornicate delivering the Apostles
A mistake from god.
Delivered from sin, all has lost meaning.
Telling lies of impure ways. A blind religion.
I desecrate your kingdom
All that follows stand before me.
Divine Suffering.A failed marriage left the mother to care
Love is gone but the kid s are still there
A broken home has become commonplace
The look of anguish on the child s face
Gone and lost
Being there just for conception
Made a promise that was all a deception
Gone and lost
[Chorus 1:]
Deadbeat dad, support he won t pay
Deadbeat dad always staying away
Deadbeat dad in disgrace and despair
Deadbeat dad, to the kids it s not fair
Biology can only go so far
When your gone it leaves a scar
Children learn to live without
Being there is what it s all about
Gone and lost
Pay the cost
[Chorus 2:]
Deadbeat dad lost in a haze
Deadbeat dad set in his ways
Deadbeat dad, a loser at heart
Deadbeat dad won t do his part
Deadbeat dad
Deadbeat dad
Deadbeat dad
Deadbeat dad
[Chorus 1]
Deadbeat dad
Deadbeat dad
Deadbeat dad
Deadbeat dad
Deadbeat dad
Deadbeat dad
Deadbeat dadI see the mighty fortress crumble, tumble to the ground
Swarms of rumbling bumble bees, consume the frantic crowd
Seething, breeding mescaline drench the pretty girls
Boredom for excuse, there's no more fun in the world
Me outside my window, me inside my door
Inside or outside, I don't give a fuck no more
Say I'm angry, have a lousy attitude
It's hard to be optimistic when I share the world with you
Pretentious asshole, time to move aside
Can't survive on your hypocrisy and lies
You're building up, but you're tearing down
The mighty fortress crumbles, tumbles to the ground
And I can't understand, can't understand, can't comprehend
Indifference to my fellow man, no longer amused
Just pissed off and confused, still I laugh
Me eyes are dry and I don't know why, I wonder why...
And I'm so fucking happyTake me to the top of the hill
Where the birds refuse to fly
Raise your hands to the damned sky
Is it the magic in you?
In the land,
this land of the dead
Raise my hands to the damned sky
Watch those twin moons collide
Take me to the top of the hill
Where the birds refuse to fly
Raise my hands to the damned sky
Watch those twin moons collide
Is it the magic in you?
In the land,
this land of the dead
Raise my arms to the damned sky
Watch those twin moons collide
Give it all man
Give it all
Give it time man
To learn how to die
Give it all man
Give it time
To learn to fly
Give it all man
Give it time
To learn how to dieAteikit

As minds slip into the dreamland of insanity,
A pure fantasy for all the lives condemned,
The game begins and all morals destroyed,
Illusions of perfection plague this reality.
[VERSE]
Subconscious shackled into the orders of the ignorant,
Conforming to stereotypes in pursuit of affection.
Can you hear the voices surrounding me?
A swelling chorus of pure insanity,
The voices now show reason,
The life you lead is fucking treason. [X2]
So fall victim to your dreams,
Only seeing what you want to see.
Because I see the real world,
And even at the worlds end you refuse to believe.
[CHORUS X2]
Follow the motions
Ignore the signs
Even a blind man
Can see their lies
[VERSE]
Escape into your mind, the one place where youre free
From social obligation to right the wrongs you see.
Practice what you preach, mean every word you say
Thats the only wake to make this hell go away. [X2]
A step further, a second longer.
Trapped inside a feeble mind.
Memories shatter like glass,
And scatter across the seas . [X2]
[CHORUS X2]
[VERSE X2]
A step further, a second longer.
Trapped inside a feeble mind.
Memories shatter like glass,
And scatter across the seas.

So fall victim to your dreams,
Only see what you want to see.
Because I see the real world,
And even at the worlds end you refuse to believe.[Intro]Born of the void as a female human,
Sha was full of innocence and weakness
(Lust...Pain...mother of perversion)
Her own face soon betrayed her
It was time for demoniac vengeance
(Lust...Pain...mother of perversion)
Then came her suicide to rejoin Satan,
Her Father that teached her how to Fight the plague
(Lust...Pain...mother of perversion)
Now she is the mistress of sin
Debauching the humans one by one
They try hard to reset temptation
Sometimes try praiyng gods (symbols of their feebleness)
Her hatred is almighty and ubiquitous
Always striking with a sweet brutality
Victims are always chosen at random
The race she once belonged to shall perish
(Lust...Pain...succubus of all vices)
She spawned sins and blasphemies
Incest, sodomy, rape,...her depraved mind created them all
(Lust...Pain...succubus of all vices)
The mistical whore will penetrate everybody
Purity is scorned even if mankind keeps their dying faith
(Lust...Pain...succubus of all vices)
She vermins that the vermin has stopped growing
At kind of majestic infarificide (?)
Men and womenkilling each other
In the name of an invisible force
Her spirit is a vagina which procreated the Evil
Our Father Satan gave ger an immortal name
Lilith.Meine Art erscheint euch sonderbar
Euch, die ihr lebt...
Die ihr das Licht des Tages seht
Und euch bei Nacht verkriecht
Vor eurer Zeit war ich schon hier
So lange schon davor
Und wenn ihr lngst im Grabe liegt
Werde ich noch immer sein
Wenn Maden euer Fleisch gefressen
Seh ich noch aus wie je zuvor
Niemals wrd ich mit euch tauschen
Mit euch, die ihr am Leben seid
Ihr haltet euch an Religionen
Und glaubt an diesen Judensohn
Ich reie euch aus euren Betten
Ihr schenkt mir euer armes Leben
Und wisst doch nichts davon...
Krone der Schpfung nennt ihr euch selbst
Und kennt nicht mal die alte Wahrheit
Die wandert durch das Mutterland
Bei Nacht bin ich allein der Herrscher
Und eure Welt versinkt im Blut...
Mein Fleisch ist kalt und ohne Leben
Niemals wrdet ihr an mich glauben
Meine Nichtexistenz macht mich so stark
Und mein Biss wird manche lehren
Was es heit, Beute zu sein...
So viele Kriege habt ihr schon gefhrt
Und berall war ich dabei
Vietnam, Irak und Jugoslawien
berall dort machte ich Station
Wo ihr euch selbst im Wahnsinn schlachtet
Setzt niemand sich zur Gegenwehr
Wenn ihr im Grauen nicht beachtet
Was doch nur euer Blut begehrt...
Und so werd ich weiter reisen
So viel der Tod, der kommen wird
Auf eines kann man sich verlassen:
Dass ihr den nchsten Kreuzzug fhrt
Dafr dank ich euch von ganzem Herzen
Ehre dem, wem sie gebhrt...Sanoit, saa usva kotkan eksymÃ¤Ã¤n

[Chorus]
En trstig sjel i skogen leter
Etter livets kilde
Har vandret slik i mange r
I mrket gtt seg bort
P stien han har ofte snublet
Falt I mrkets klr
N satans trellebnd har makten
Over sjelens liv
Satans sterke bnd m brytes
Med Kristi blod
Et kall vi har, g ut p skogens mrke steder
Tenn et lite lys, gi vann til trstige sjeler
Forbind de store sr som oppsttt har under ferden
Led dem til det sted med de utmmelige kilderMake it out, is your life a real thrill?
find out things that always make you sick
screaming out frustations kept inside
... do it now! Do it now! Do it now!
breaking out of opprensive...
Jails, clouding keen minds
instincts restrained by invisible...
CHORUS
Chains: express your own personality!
Make it out, did you decide your destiny?
pointing out mistakes you made on your way
bringing out the best you got inside yourself
...do it now! Do it now! Do it now!
breaking out of opprensive...
Jails, blinding hungry eyes
instincts restrained by invisible...
CHORUS
Chains: express your own personality!
CHORUS
Chains, Chains, Chains, ouch!
PER-SO-NA-LI-TY!!I see myself when I look in your eyes
And all of the sadness you're keeping inside
Oh baby can't you see
If anyone knows, if anyone knows it's me
So many years I tried to pretend
That I would live on in silence my friend
Then something changed in me
Funny how love, it's funny how love sets you free
Don't run away
From my love it could save you
If only you'll stay
How many tears will you cry in the dark
'Till you let me close to your heart
Doesn't the loneliness tear you apart
Let me get close to your heart
"What can I do?" I hear you say
Feels like I'm frozen or driftin' away
Can my love unlock the door?
And you won't be lonely, you won't be lonely no more
Hold me, hold me tight and don't let go
There's just one thing that you got to know
And that is love it holds the key, baby
So why don't take it, why don't you take it from me
Don't run away
From my love it could save you
If only you'll stay
How many tears will you cry in the dark
'Till you let me close to your heart
Doesn't the loneliness tear you apart
Let me get close to your heart
How many tears will you cry in the dark
'Till you let me close to your heart
Doesn't the loneliness tear you apart
Let me get close to your heart
Oh you just can't keep me away
Not another day, baby
You gotta open up and let me in
Don't try to run away 'coz I got so much to say
I could love you if you'd let me get close to your heart
[Repeat until fade]
How many tears will you cry in the dark
'Till you let me close to your heart
Doesn't the loneliness tear you apart
Let me get close to your heartThe greedy gullet of the bigwig nations
Swallows all of our patience
In unity they fool the poor
Keen on cash like a cheap fucking whore
They're misplaying their winning game
Already forgot that we're all the same
Their acting under our flag
Awkward political greylag!
[CHORUS]------------------------------------------
The ravenous beast....
...the claws of evil ripping the
credulous poor apart
The ravenous beast....
...the statement of claim ignored by those
With a blackheart!
The ravenous beast....
...the claws of evil ripping the
credulous poor apart
Wrapped up in lies
The Ravenous beast
--------------------------------------------------
Seems education didn't teach us well
This ego mania leads into a bombshell
Disgrace surrounds me on those lucky days
Cause soon the world will be ablaze
Only to give and to share luck
Keeps the unprivileged away from running amok
[REPEAT CHORUS --- x2]
The greedy gullet of the bigwig nations
Swallows all of our patience
In unity they fool the poor
Keen on cash like a cheap fucking whore
They're misplaying their winning game
Already forgot that We're all the same
[REPEAT CHORUS]Oh, my God, what are these?
You can hear people puking? They're dog meat
In caustic butchery I parent my dominion
In the food chain I [Incomprehensible] the missing link
Cold temerity confects this splintered for age
Infantile corruption taken to the brink
Making hash of the spumous crubescent
All compassion removed
Newly fully developed boiled as sprouted fodder
Marti linear murder, cordon bleu
As salubrious pet food
Human midden is consumed
And I want to mince my words
But now I love to see those churned
In tins they are reared
Ghastly I slake
Bestial appetites to sate
As flesh and steel I mate
To fill the lower species' plate
Des parental, primparal goods oozing
The bawling, squabbling denied the suckling teat
Sentient bloodletting sprains the sporulate
Makes a choice, chimerical treat
Rheological, twisted nursery chymes
The fluxing of the defleshed
Paedophilosophical, carnage knowledge
As the illegitimeat to the domesticated is fed
So as you breed
They will bleed
Contumely calorie count
Ebullient death toll mounts
Higher and higher
[Incomprehensible]
Despumation the midden, the desipient I segment
Pertaining vitality, their dispatch I cement
Served out for minion in their feeding troughThere's something evil in the sky
it's haunting me and I just can't hide
it's getting closer more and more
to start the war
Fight and believing
that's what I'm aiming for
so tells the story
there goes out my prayer
The brave and the strong
will always be on my side
nothing can tear me apart
when darkness surrounds you
I'll be your shining star
even thou the battle rages on
the fear arises with the night
nowhere to run there's nowhere to hide
the time has come to raise your sword
against the evil unknownRooo bwaa rogoort ierrart

Instrumental interlude+ singer throws up repeadatlyIt's sad when kids take their lives
In the act, kill 13 peers
What drives a mind to kill?
Must have been really catastrophic
To hate violently stockpile guns
Inflictin' revenge gruesomely that oblivious day
Who would foresee media spectacle
Enshroud in tragedy
Victims will beg and plead
Nation in shock, copy-cat's mock
Upscaled high school
Killing of the rich can happen anywhere
Even in your neighborhood
Children are snapping
Peach through annihilation
It kind of sucks
Innocent people died
What made this happen
Condolence to the bereaved
Deranged adolescents
Or victims as well
Society could learn from this
Listen to your kids
Two die brains go splatburn your eyes in me
save your breath for the set of dawn
will we ever leave?
close your eyes to see
never trust!
they would kill the first
Lucifer released
Maladine
you hold the stars we always dreamt of
never leave
you are the salt in every teardrop
and when the sky is hurt, but there's no pain
say will you leave me?
dead inside and free
stand and wait for your miracle
sell your misery
sleep in your belief
swallow dust!
would you raise a word?
Lucifer deceived
Maladine
you hold the stars we always dreamt of
never leave
you are the salt in every teardrop
and when the sky is hurt, but there's no pain
say will you leave me?I fed the fire with my flesh and desire
Spilt the blood upon existence
Tracing trails, a furious tail
Barely touching the mirror of reality
The deformation of what depression denote
A spiritual fusion, drown in conclusions
Derail the path, the course that...
The solar solace within the hideous
Here upon the heralds of dawn
The dawn of eternity
A northern notability
Revoke the reviavl of revolt
Burn the treason, the trinity
Yearn the heat of the fire
Face yesterdays tomorrow
The heralds of the past
The winds of a history cast
The profound spiritual fusion
Glimpse inward to my world
A fragment of fire, hordes of imagery
An illumination of all illustrations
The solar solace within the hideous
Here upon the heralds of dawn
The dawn of eternity
A northern notability
Barely touching the mirror of reality
The deformation of what depression denote
A spiritual fusion, drown in conclusions
Derail the path, the course that...
I fed the fire with my flesh and desire
Spilt the blood upon existence
Tracing trails, a furious tail
To the centre of chaos
Burn the treason, the trinity
Yearn the heat of the fire
Face yesterdays tomorrow
The heralds of the past
The winds of a history cast
The profound spiritual fusion
Glimpse inward to my worldI'm an invincible force of evil
My eternal hatred is destructive
There's no chance to survive
I incarnate the end of mankind
I'm in crest of human flesh
And I agonize in a pool of blood
Don't try to escape or resist
'Cause Christ won't help you tonight
Invincible Force
Invincible Force
You break down in the morass
Turn and see them blood stained claws
Now I tear the shreds out of your face
Now you will curse your day of birthFollow the one
Evil masked in pride
Charisma to lead
Speeches laced with hate
Leading the dense
The bovine human herd
Inherently stupid
The fools deserve this fate
Warfare begins
Cities are ablaze
Tortured screams
Skin turning black
Carbonization
They will all burn
Mass execution
They will all die
Burning the world
And all of it's life
Throwing all the people
In a pit of fire
Watching the sheep
Gathering to die
Followers in life
Follow to the grave
Follow the one
Evil masked in pride
Charisma to lead
Speeches laced with hate
Leading the dense
The bovine human herd
Inherently stupid
The fools deserve this fate
Warfare begins
Cities are ablaze
Tortured screams
Skin turning black
Carbonization
They will all burn
Mass execution
They will all die
Pile the bodies
Set them aflame
The human race
Sentenced to burn
Burning flesh
Miasma of their death
Civilisation
It is destroyed
Pits of corpses
Unholy grave of war
Hanging victims
Guilty of free thought
Warfare begins
Cities are ablaze
Tortured screams
Skin turning black
Carbonization
They will all burn
Mass execution
They will all die
Pile the bodies
Set them aflame
The human race
Sentenced to burn
Pile the bodies
Set them aflame
The human race
Sentenced to burn
War of fire shred their souls
Burn in hell doomsday's toll
Failed to see the trap they laid
Demagogues lead them into the flames
Pile the bodies
Set them aflame
The human race
Sentenced to burn
Pile the bodies
Set them aflame
The human race
Sentenced to burnI live my life
And I despise
Everything you told me
You see Im getting older
Beat me down
Shut your crown
Lets shut down the system
this life is just mine
I will never win this game
(I dont want it all)
And I will never break these chains
I live my life
And I despise
Everything you told me
You see Im getting older
Beat me down
Shut your crown
Lets shut down the system
this life is just mine
I will never let you slide
(I dont want it all)
And I don't wanna step aside

Im looking inside you
Stay away from me
Sick and twisted
Searching for a safe place
Lonley, wasted
Shut the fuck up and cry
And Ill be strong to stab
No i can't kill
But i don't want it
Don't leave me
I wait and bleed
blame is my atonement
I'll die for my since
Don't leave me
I will never win this game
(I dont want it all)
And I will never break these chains
I will never let you slide
(I dont want it all)
And I don't wanna step aside
(I dont want it all)Babylon asleep, an everlasting foe
Striving to hurt, for flesh becomes dirt
Resting within, the sacred fire
I can't withhold, the lies untold
Dances and cries, a descent to Babylon
Wine in my hand, a descent to Babylon
All eyes must foul, in stench of fear
Killing to quench, Babylon's tears
We are whispering for holy wine
Innocence to reign, a world of shrines
This crazy dream, raging over ages
For only one belief.
Killing, suffer for a thought
In human blood, stretched out
A descent to a 1000 deaths
As sweet as snow, as cold as dew
A descent to a 1000 deaths.In my parent's eyes, I'm a child of sin.
Black sheep of the family, blessed be insanity.
Down with the lambs, up with the lark.
Run to bed my children now, before it gets dark.
Family life, forbidden to find.
Searching her love, within the black depths of a septic mind.
Barred from my mother's love, please let me in.
I was born unto a child of sin.
A child of sin - her love becomes my lust.
Raped my own kin - mother ashes to dust.
Bearing no marks of evil, blamed for my acts of mercy.
Come lay you down upon the bed,
my imagination of your severed head.
The dead loved parents, and the deviant son.
Family life now that we are one.
Is this the confused mind of a boy?
Or does a oreature lurk within?
Am I possessed by eternal entities?
Or are my urges born of my own fears?
Mother mutilation!
Witness malign grin, born unto a vicious child of sin.Ten thousand times, ten thousand walking
And marching and running
And shoving, and pressing on
Step by step to the grave, marching on
You have a song unsung
I sing a new song falling on deaf ears
UnsungFlash-point
I lied right to your face!
And I'll burn eternally!
In flames (flames) in flames(flames)
In flames (flames) in flames(flames)
Instinct has failed me now
Enslaved by my deceit
Lies sink in like gasoline saturates my body
One last spark of dishonesty and that will be the death of me!
[Chorus]
Damned in flames! damned in flames!
Damned in flames! damned in flames!
Lies engulf me lies they burn me
Lies they purge me lies they free me
Lies sink in like gasoline saturates my body
One last spark of dishonesty and that will be the death of me!
[Chorus](lew/graham)
I gave you all my time and I gave all my love to you
I gave you every dime and tell me what did you do
You broke this heart of mine by loving somebody new
You said that love was forever you'd leave me never
But where are you now
Chorus:
I gave you everything all that one could ever give
I gave you everything you were my reason to live
Everythings out of place
There's an empty space
In my heart
And I gave you everything
You took the best of me you took everything I had
You took so selfishly and gave nothing in return
I would have set you free if that's how it had to be
Why would you lie (why, why)
Why would you need to make me cry
Ooh, yeah, I cried myself to sleep that night
It wasn't right for you to leave me here high and dry
It wasn't right to close the door without so much as a goodbye
Could have blood from a stone
Why did you leave me alone?
ChorusThe risk of failure's what makes life worth living
a chance is given for more
Doors can shut to make new beginnings
another chance to explore
Explore!
Strive for more!
Would you carry out what you walked through?
Would you carry out and make fucken move?
A blane life you live, walking on what you made
took shit for granted, and threw it all away
Then along came 1, then 1 and 3,
then 1 more a set to see, a set to see
You tried to push us away, you pushed it away, you pushed it all away, pushed us away!
The risk of failure's what makes life worth living,
a chance is given for more
Doors can shut to make new beginnings,
and I'm not depressed from it
It's just you fucken testament!
We tried over and over again, to pull you through,
Now we're at the very end but where are you
another band, a fallen dream, another outcast,
another 1 to a band, a fallen dream, a fucken outcast!
Now that your gone we carry out this torche,
the one you threw away with no remorse.
No fuel to light the fire, but we're still going strong!
GOING STRONG!
GOING STRONG!Stand up for what's right,
Everything you said to me, it turned out to be lies,
Your words came out, Your eyes rolled back,
and now your fucking trust is gone,
There are times when I want to grab you by the fucking throat
for everything you ever said you ever said to me,
I fucking won't let you tak away what's right,
Everything you said to me, it turned out to be lies,
I took a lot of advise from you,
Don't turn away,
Look in my eyes and don't you turn awayHammer down
The sickness
Wipe it out
Of existence
Cut down corruption
Cut down infection
Scrape down
Wipe out
Concrete
Concrete
Concrete
Hammer down
The sickness
Wipe it out
Of existenceI don't need your false affection
I don't need your serpent smiles
Drawing me into your garden
The devil hides behind angel eyes
I'll erase you from my memory
I'll delete you from my mind
I had to close my eyes to how I felt
To realize that I was blind
I don't need your razor blade caresses
Those subtle cuts upon my soul
And I'm not gonna put myself in prison
For something that you stole
You know there's no poison in this venom
And there's no hatred in these words
It's the pain that sparks this fire
And swells the river of fuel it burns
I'll erase you from my memory
I'll delete you from my mind
I had to close my eyes to how I felt
To realize that I was blind
And don't need another nail in my coffin
And I don't need a stake through my heart
And I don't need you to keep telling me
That what I did drove us apart
I don't need your candy-coated love
Sweet at first, bitter inside
And I don't need to mend your broken wings
If you won't try once more to fly
A closed casket for our twisted love
And I'm alone to mourn this loss
I built this with unknowing hands
Now I alone must bear this cross
I'll erase you from my memory
I'll delete you from my mind
I had to close my eyes to how I felt
To realize that I was blind
I'll erase you
I'll delete you
I'll erase you
I'll erase you
I'll delete you
I'll erase youI felt you slip away
Far away from me
Further from me
You seem to drift far away
I caught myself wishing you back, as i fight to catch you
Anger wells inside me
I see me, frowning, in your eyes
(I see the fear in you where no one should ever be,
I find myself striving to catch you from
This will hurt me less and less every time until i feel nothing)
I see my reflection and the pain scripted across my face, set in stone
Anger wells inside of me
I see me, frowning in your eyes
Far away from me
Further from me
You seem to drift far away
I caught myself wishing you back as i strive for you
(She said "its not that i don't love you anymore,
But it would be much more accurate to say that i never loved you in the first place)
I put the fear in you where no one should ever be
Nothing to me
Everything to you
Nothing to me
Everything to you.[1.]

You broke this heart of mine by loving somebody new
You said that love was forever you'd leave me never
But where are you now
Chorus:
I gave you everything all that one could ever give
I gave you everything you were my reason to live
Everythings out of place
There's an empty space
In my heart
And I gave you everything
You took the best of me you took everything I had
You took so selfishly and gave nothing in return
I would have set you free if that's how it had to be
Why would you lie (why, why)
Why would you need to make me cry
Ooh, yeah, I cried myself to sleep that night
It wasn't right for you to leave me here high and dry
It wasn't right to close the door without so much as a goodbye
Could have blood from a stone
Why did you leave me alone?
ChorusAlcohol is in my veins
Tears fall as I think of you.
The true memory you left me with
is a key to the wine of melancholy.
I drown myself in the deepest of sorrows-
As you Burned on that stake they burnt
my soul as well.
Your pure feelings, your flaming hate;
it was not enough.
Natassja, my beloved satanic witch,
The power in your eyes and yourself.
Worked for the noble in man.
Pass the bottle, pass the knife,
Pass me your unholy crafts.
I shall never forget you, the best
of all there is, I lick your cold lips,
I embrace your coffin as I sigh in woe.
You never kissed the priest, you never
Drank the blood of Jesus. Weird, they say
well, turn it upside down like you did,
and they kill, kill, and they take you away.Lurinn ltur

With lines that cut so deeply to the truth
Your head's on the clock and still you threaten
A wretched way of life for those that choose and abuse
Believe, nothing worth believing in
Believe, stand for nothing care for nothing
Believe, empty words a false doctrine
Blooded in your holy word's goal
Look what you did so fucking sick it's what you did
The evil twin of devotion then now you're dead
You represent your discontent slaughtering the innocent
Insolence, you're no martyrs
The arrogance to reinvent
The holy words their meanings bent
Evil twins, you're no martyrs,
(No martyrs)

Refuse and resist dictated terror
Fighting a war with both feet in
Savage that our planet is the venue
For a festival of massacres
Believe, nothing worth believing in

Look what you did so fucking sick it's what you did

Broke and sickened by the senseless atrocity
And repulsion for this old world reality

On the thirteenth floor
I hear you knock
Upon my door
My attitudes are platitudes
I surrender to your love
Surrounded by your smell
A snapshot like twisted veins
No more thoughts to tell
Devotion up to this gains
Delicious smooth warm sin
Fingerprints on your soft skin
In deep devotion
I end in tears
Like a setting lotion
For all my fearsCan't explain all the feelings that you're making me feel
My heart's in overdrive and you're behind the steering wheel
Touching you, touching me
Touching you God you're touching me
I believe in a thing called love
Just listen to the rhythm of my heart
There's a chance we could make it now
We'll be rocking 'til the sun goes down
I believe in a thing called love
Ooh!
I want to kiss you every minute, every hour, every day
You got me in a spin but everything is A.O.K!
Touching you, touching me
Touching you God you're touching me
I believe in a thing called love
Just listen to the rhythm of my heart
There's a chance we could make it now
We'll be rocking 'til the sun goes down
I believe in a thing called love
Ooh!
Touching you, touching me
Touching you God you're touching me
I believe in a thing called love
Just listen to the rhythm of my heart
There's a chance we could make it now
We'll be rocking 'til the sun goes down
I believe in a thing called love
Ooh!Your desire is religion
And I lead your mind towards my aim
Lust lies his lips will tell
Seems to be your wishing well
See his smile and in his hands you will give your soul
I abuse your innocent nescience
Your believe pumps power through my veins
But just keep in mind
The twinkling shadow in his mind
(Twinkling shadow)
There -- a scar remained from the truth
He tries to turn inside
(Twinkling shadow)
I know, I know, it's so easy to be blind
(Twinkling shadow)
But please never forget about
The twinkling shadow in his mind
(Twinkling shadow)
Doom!
What he tells to your minds is what you want to hear
He knows what you're wishing, and tightens all your fears
Your weakness gives power to his seducing lies
He takes you and turns you until you fit his plans
I'm the answer to all your craving
Autonomy erased for the masses' "welfare"
But just keep in mind
The twinkling shadow in his mind
(Twinkling shadow)
There -- a scar remained from the truth
He tries to turn inside
(Twinkling shadow)
I know, I know, it's so easy to be blind
(Twinkling shadow)
But please never forget about
The twinkling shadow in his mind
(Twinkling shadow)
But just keep in mind
The twinkling shadow in his mind
(Twinkling shadow)
There -- a scar remained from the truth
He tries to turn inside

I know, I know, it's so easy to be blind

Spawn of grand whore
It is no surprise that I sow such twilight
misery
The raping of your children and the...
I see of course as a gift to me.
The withering of mirth marks my path,
or I am the end of all ends.
The slaves of heaven who crave for redemption
Shall rewrite their books as I become their
destiny.
Monuments of faith anchor me to eternity;
From the cradle of time they knew I had come
to stayWhy hate?
I'm a strong believer
Why feel?
It's just as I see
Why care?
What more can I do?
Why LIVE?
Is it all that I need?
Why want?
Searching my feelings for
Why fear?
For all that is numb
Why hate?
It is all that I've ever known?
Why HATE?
It is all that I'll ever know?
Display it in another form
All I ask is nothing but what I expect from my fucking self
What is blame? What is blame?
I have given all that you have given, I know you the fearful
Always wanting never learning why must I take all the blame?
Why complicate life?
The world waits for no man and nothing
Why be frightened of my view of you?
Blood running through your mind is now numb
Wanting but waiting and wasting your final chance
Follow the one, follow the one, follow
Why complicate life?
The world waits for no man and nothing
Why be frightened of my view of you?
Blood running through your mind is now numb
Wanting but waiting and wasting your final chance
Follow the one, follow the one, follow?[Instrumental]Help I've been detained
By these mountains that so poorly raised me
Burned out huffing gasoline
The redneck that I'm supposed to be
Fuck that I'm stronger than my history
The pride is instilled in me
In pesticide I hide
These West Virginia hills can't sedate me
Kill your family tree, this soil is diseased
My will is broken
The black lungs have swallowed me
Viva Villa! Long live the picket line in me
You want a war you've got one
You want a state with poverty
Remember 1882 because there is no excuse
Excuses are just tools of incompetence
Used to build monuments of nothingness
And those who specialized in the uses
Seldom achieve anythingCapitolist Suck
Capitolist Suck
Capitolist Suck
You can't tell your wants from needs
You buy America and do a good deed
Create a job, don't bite the hand that feeds
Capitolist Suck
Capitolist Suck
Capitolist Suck
All of your goals are the fucking same
As every other jerk in this stupid game
Your brains have been washed and hung out to dry
You don't doubt it and you don't know whyMed skrik och skrn som tusen korpars rop.

[Goblins awaken from the bowels of the earth and destroy the villages and cities of the north. Feasting on humans for the first time in thousand years, they prefer the unborn and their carrying mothers. The bodies are piled along the boundaries of the northern lands.]A private horrorshow is playing in my head
Movie after movie until I am... dead!!![Music by Marco Kehren/DEINONYCHUS]
[Instrumental]backtrack - think about where you were.
laser white - from the flashlight - only clouding the matter.
insert dead batteries and move forward...remembering. [schultz]Walk away from your grace leave it behind, all that you once were
Now sell yourself out, for the very last time
Now take my hand and run away
Your not an object, a credit card,
you're so much more than an object for them to buy
Despite what you may think, Jesus will be there for you
Your eyes give you away it's not what you are
It's what you will become, through your lust
Your lust, your lust is suicide, your heart will overcome
Now sell yourself out, for one last time, now take my hand and run far away
You're so much more than this, you're so much more than this, you're beauty
Now run away and grab my hand,
you're so much more than an object for them to buy
You don't know what you've done,
you think you're wrong, there is another way out of here
Despite what you may think, Jesus will be there for you
You're eyes give you away it's not what you are
It's what you will become, though your lust
Your lust, your lust is suicide, your heart will overcome[A poem by P.B. Shelley (1792-1822)]
Unfathomable Sea! whose waves are years,
Ocean of Time, whose waters of deep woe
Are brackish with the salt of human tears!
Thou shoreless flood, which in thy ebb and flow
Claspest the limits of mortality!
And sick of prey, yet howling on for more,
Vomitest thy wrecks on its inhospitable shore;
Treacherous in calm, and terrible in storm,
Who shall put forth on thee,
Unfathomable Sea?...this will be
my last call,
I am with
a different
tribe now...So loaded with anger, so filled with rage
Time for revolution
You are out for blood.
Crush the power
You will never feel free in this slavery system.
We are digging our own graves
In the gutter we will stay
Until we heed out in war,
Against the global powers we will reign.
Cut of the power by their knees
Grab your knives and bring the ropes
Tie them up, shoot their veins full with the shit they are selling
Tear apart their smiling faces and burn them alive.
Nailed up on crosses
Buried naked and alive
Nailed up on crosses
Hanging high soon all bled dry
They have taken away all your human rights
Giving away your blood, selling your soul and mind to god
They steal your blood and try to bring you down to the place
Where all life ends
Cut of the power by their knees
Grab your knives and bring the ropes
Tie them up, shoot their veins full with the shit they are selling
Tear apart their smiling faces and burn them alive.
Nailed up on crosses
Buried naked and alive
Nailed up on crosses
Hanging high soon all bled dry
They steal your blood and try to bring you down to the place
Where all life ends
Cut of the power by their knees
Grab your knives and bring the ropes
Tie them up, shoot their veins full with the shit they are selling
Tear apart their smiling faces and burn them alive.
Nailed up on crosses
Buried naked and alive
Nailed up on crosses
Hanging high soon all bled dryMan that is born of a woman hath but a short time
To live and is full of misery. He cometh up and is
Cut down like a flower. He fleeth as it were a
Shadow and never continueth in one stay. In the
Midst of life, we are in death. We commit his body
To the ground. Earth to earth. Ashes to ashes.
Dust to dust!*
Down to HELL!
Burn to a crisp
Piece of dirt
Piece of SHIT!
Piece of SHIT!
Into the ground
Now you will lay
Piece of dirt
Piece of SHIT!
Piece of SHIT!
Piece of dust
Piece of dirt
On my shirt
HA!
DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE!
Kiss your life goodbye!
DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE!
ASHES TURN TO DUST!
Into the ground
Can't say no more
Piece of dirt
Piece of SHIT! Piece of SHIT!
Into the ground
Now you will lay
Piece of dirt
Piece of SHIT! Piece of SHIT!
DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE!
Kiss your life goodbye!
DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE!

[From Book of Common Prayer]Slavery kings run free again
From their wounds a giant stands
Four hundreds years of glory
Animals who speak and cry
Destiny of craving sights
Inside the dance of white domain
Wheels turning round will feed the ground
And women carry by their children with no life
To future days belong the past
But change the times
Now millions cry out
From away it comes...
Freedom call
Freedom overall to last forever
No disgrace
No more separate race
We'll keep together 'till the end[M and L: M. Winterwild]
I walk in the moonlight far away from the cities roaring sounds
A walk in silence underneath the starlit sky
The glorious landscape that opens up right before my eyes
The hills and the valleys there's nothing more beautiful
[BRIDGE]
Here the wind of freedom calls
Please take me there
The north wind is blowing all the way everywhere I go
Trough the season of my life, on this my last journey
The daylight is fading in my dreams the angels call my name
They lead me to my own land, don't let this dream ever end
[CHORUS]
Oh Northern sky
Guide me on my way home
Oh Northern sky
Yo are my haven
The rain and thunder came crashing down from heaven
Storm winds are blowing like hurricans of madness
Earthquakes are shaking the core of the planet
Volcanoes erupting and fire spreads across the sky[instrumental]Fifteen years in the academy
He was like no cadet they'd ever seen
A man so hard, his veins bleed ice
And when he speaks he never says it twice
They call him judge, his last name is dredd
So break the law, and you wind up dead
Truth and justice are what he's fighting for
Judge dredd the man, he is the law
Drokk it!
With gun and bike he rules the streets
And every perp he meets will taste defeat
Not even death can overcome his might
Cause dredd and anderson, they won the fight
When the sov's started the apocalypse war
Mega-city was bombed to the floor
Dredd resisted, and the judges fought back
Crushed the sov's with their counter-attack
Drokk it!
Respect the badge - he earned it with his blood
Fear the gun - your sentence may be death because
I am the law!
And you won't fuck around no more - I am the law
I judge the rich, I judge the poor - I am the law
Commit a crime I'll lock the door - I am the law
Because in mega-city... I am the law
In the cursed earth where mutants dwell
There is no law, just a living hell
Anarchy and chaos as the blood runs red
But this would change if it was up to dredd
The book of law is the bible to him
And any crime committed is a sin
He keeps the peace with his law-giver
Judge, jury, and executioner
Drokk it!
Crime - the ultimate sin
Your iso-cube is waiting when he brings you in
Law - it's what he stands for
Crime's his only enemy and he's going to war
Lead break crime - the ultimate sin
Your iso-cube is waiting when he brings you in
Law - it's what he stands for
Crime's his only enemy and he's going to warFall into the pit
Close your eyes
Leave the world
Behind you
Eternal darkness waits
Make the final leap and fall
Excitement builds
Blood flows
Gasping for air
Choking on your blood
Your bones broken
Your body disfigured
Torn to shreds
Your innards on the outside
Fall...down
Gasping for air
Choking on your blood
Now on the ground
A bloody mess
Still barely breathing
Your death is so painful
The truth so dreadful
Wish you were dreaming
Your high hopes
We're set to see you fall
Fall...downTrapped in my mind, the answers you won't find
Deep despair, what I feel, lost in time, what I'm feeling
Emotions lost all meaning, can not help what I'm feeling
Tortured by pain, this agony is so insane
Chorus:
Diminishing away, day by day
A life once fulfilling now stripped away
It it's certain I must die
I deserve the right to die
Thousands of dollars everyday
To keep me suffering in a life of pain
I lie rotting be disease, eats away piece by pice
Just leave me be
Living through this Hell, life unravels, just as well
Politics of man won't let me die, they just prolong my demise
A life I did not choose, but it is certain I will lose
A disgrace to myself it I take my family through this hell
Repeat chorus
Solo: Lykins
Repeat first verse
Repeat chorusDon't use it, if you can't feel it
Don't be it, if you don't see it
In a world, so full of pain
I can barely say your name
Don't use it, if you can't feel it
ForgiveTruth layed down
in words to hollow wounds
into the never again I'll wander
blood drained mind
violent declined
Butchered me back there, cut me in the groin
cut me in the leg, profused blood flowing
tried to spill me in your form, an irrevocable failure
my vengeance on society's humilition, killer!
cruelty, callousness beyond human feeling
existence turned to exicution, my nemesis revealing
there is no prison more relentless than your inner self
you parasites look straight at me, you will see yourself
In Violence
truth layed down
in words to hollow wounds
Open my chest you will see
a shattered personality
Shattered by reality
hateful morbid mind
aggressions now arise
orders and shapes designed for consciousness
this is your veil on your way to death

in words to hollow wounds
your lack of identity

Open my chest for you will see
I'm shattered by realitySatan My Master
I slit my wrists to drain me of my blood

I hear you Telephone Thing listening in
I HEAR YOU TELEPHONE THINGI close my eyes to see within myself as the first snow falls on me
I close my ears to hear my inner voice and the cold wind freezes me
This is my land, our holy land, I don't want to leave this place
But there are unholy men all around us and they want to take it away
Their hearts are filled with mean passion... Red blood on their hands
Tonight is the last night we're a part of this land
I open my eyes and my ears, I see nothing but darkness
I hear the wind behind the distant hills far beyond this vale
This is my land, our holy land, I don't want leave this place
But there are unholy men all around us and they want take it away
We have to go, travel to the hills, maybe we will find the answer there
Follow me, my people, we must wander to the land of the long shadesThe story I tell you is old, in fact the oldest in the world
I feel that it must be told, 'til now no one's ever heard
Somewere in time there's a school, a boy went there to read and write
You were nobody's fool, you quickly learned the game and how to fight
Then when he was ten years old his parents got divorced
Father was so cold and mother was so forced
It hurts so bad inside, he thought it was all his fault
He discovered it was a lie, all the things he once was taught
Tomorrow's child he cries
But only in his mind
He gets so cold inside
He leaves his ones behind
Today he's a full grown man
Wife & children and a piece of land
He's got a steady job, no trouble in the way
Suddenly there she stands, again in love he takes her by the hand
He tries to tell his wife, he wants this woman to stay in his life
Tomorrow's child he cries
But only in his mind
He gets so cold inside
He leaves his ones behind
This is not the curse of God, nor of the accuser
It's the curse of mankind that makes him an ordinary loser
The older says: you can go to hell
The younger says: she's crazy
He loves them both, they know this well
Pride hold them back, they lose him
Women of this world today
Don't wow this world away
A man is fertile all his life, this need is not right to deny
I know it is not fair, but it's a fact, it's not that we don't care
Only one thing to do
Put in the law a man can marry two[Music by Gerhard Storesund]
[Lyrics by Gerhard Storesund]
Ridden through the flame
The ring be his bane
The oathkeeper's brother bid
The ringkeeper slain
Fire-raisers hand
The grief and the rage
The ill-fated will had won
The ill-fated wage
Fish of the wild-wood
Worm smooth crawling
With wolf-meat mingled
They minced for him
Then in the beaker
In the wine his mouth knew
They set it, still doing
More deeds of wizards
The fate has overcome
maimed and outrun
The brave breed of the noble son's
Vile unjust done
[Brynhild:]
"Long shall ye have
land and men of war
Thou who now has slain
Sigurds death done"
Now he has fallen
The son of Gods triumphant
Norns have their judgement
Death knell toll
We are the children of the wolf
Fall to your sleep
Thy court of mailcoat's gem
Swift peace reap
The shriek of a raven
Cut through the air
"False oath be thy bane"A comoran devouring time
In great streams rains the joy of mine
My blood speaks to You in vein
Fare well until we meet again!
You knocked onto my fate
alighted at my gate
My wife that was, my son that is
Keep faith onto Your chance
I'm glad at heart, make war breed peace
piercing thru myself to meet
Lend me Your hand that kills my heart
Let me to find You still, devil cross Your will
You stand pleased with all
I say:"Hear Your fall!"
Pardon me, stars, I never felt it until now
O sighful thought, drown her broked soul!
Your life passed thru so hard
I pay it when You part
Won't have a serpent-bite
Not fighting forth tonight...
God, I will set You forth
Great glory in my horse
I creep in dream-maids ears
My weakened voice to hearStayed with me - so violently
Played all your games on me
Broke all the chains just in time
A leap of faith made me fall back in line
Made peace with what I held for true
Have faith in what I now must do
Sweet devotion, a sacred smile
Traded my secrets so you'll never leave my sideThe whites of your eyes blind blue but bind by surprise the tired tries of
trying time and through your teeth cry lines of lies hiding under street
lights fighthing night time disguise. I can't fight the butterflies, trying
to hide from your eyes. I lied. So long ago, you swallowed your smile to
break your heart. It was always your best weapon. I could never win, I
tried, but you keep attempting to anthem that argument again, and again. I
can see you, aging with beauty, but becoming so ugly. What happened to the
stars? They just kept fading. Tonight I can imagine that image in most any
situation, sitting with leaves that leave trees all alone. Still paying
attention to tension with questions you mention. I never thought you would
let me fall again. Are you happy this happened, ending in patience? I
lied, your eyes can't hide. For every other time. I tried, your eyes can't
lie. Forever always cries. Accepting signs, except for time. Expect
nothing. I never thought you would let me fall again. Tonight, I can
imagine that image in most any situation. I lied. I can't fight the
butterflies. Accepting signs, except for time. What happened to the stars?
They just kept fading.To execute, you made no compromise, men aren't pigs
(Slaughtered)
Infected with a plague or rendered with a scalpel by you
You make the claim, it was just a job
And killing's nothing more than sawing logs
Wash your hands but blood leaves stains
You don't deny, you say you've a creative side
The passion born to an inquisitive mind
Entered men alive and destroyed them from inside, it's true
Extracted organs slowly one by one
Your only goal to see the damage done
(You)
You slid the razor
(You)
The anti savior
(You)
The crucifier
Babies bathed in fire
No light shines from dead eyes
It's odd how they match your own
No justice for the murdered
Shoveled lives like lumps of coal
Your victims fed the furnace
In the blackened pit that was your soul
Soulless and dead eyed
At the core you gained a thrill from the sickening stench
The smell of terror as they
(Marched to their death)
Carry out your orders like a patriotic soldier and maim
Rape and decapitate, my only wish is that you'd face their fate
(You)
You led the slaughter
Mother, son and daughter
(You)
You drove the masses
Bodies scorched to ashes
No light shines from dead eyes
It's odd how they match your own
No justice for the murdered
Shoveled lives like lumps of coal
Your victims fed the furnace
In the blackened pit that was your soul
So soulless and dead eyed
No light shines from dead eyes
It's odd how they match your own
So soulless and dead eyedClose your eyes and leave all your fears behind (it's alright)
Close your eyes and follow me until the end
So if you're hopeless
We can pick up the pieces
And if you're broken
I can carry the pain
Are you with me?
Watching the flames rise high (yeah)
Sing this with me
I break down the walls
I want it all
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground
Scream and shout
Till the lights go out
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground
We won't take this
You can't break us
We won't stop until the world is in our hands
I break down the walls
I want it all!
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground
Don't let go
We carry our torches high (always burning)
Come too far
To throw it all away
So are you with me?
Watching the flames rise high (yeah)
Sing this with me
I break down the walls
I want it all
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground
Scream and shout
Till the lights go out
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground
We won't take this
You can't break us
We won't stop until the world is in our hands
I break down the walls
I want it all
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground
I like the mess
I watch you fall to the ground
As the embers rise
And the smoke fills the air
I break down the walls
I want it all
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground
Scream and shout
Till the lights go out
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground
We won't take this
You won't break us
We won't stop until the world is in our hands
I break down the walls
I want it all
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground[intro]
You'd never ever hear of Olathoe in the land of Lomar again, its story was buried 26000 years
ago where Polaris shines high in the sky. But if you find a silver key in a black wooden box,
you still may roam there in your dreams and hear what once was huge walls, laughing beneath the
ice and telling you the whole tale.
[part 1 - war]
Standing,
We wait with no fear, all is prepared
We shall defend this town, no one is...
Scared by the enemy even tho' we're few
You're drawing near and we have iron for you
Our mate on the look-out is scanning the field
Polaris' watching and we stand, ha ha!
Suddenly,
A cry breaks the night, some soldiers are hit
The Inuto are here, no time left
Watch out behind us we're caught by surprise
The look-out man fell under Polaris' light
By the time I see one, two of us has died
Their swords are more, but we still have our pride
Oh, Olathoe, oh...
Marble walls are painted red, oh don't give our home free
See our wives and children cry, don't dive into defeat
Conquered,
We'll die now in war, but we still ain't lost
I speak to you my walls, I pray you
We were the founders of this town I live
We built you and the marble palaces for peace
Defended you in war through aeons with pride
So punish the stranger, take vengeance while we die
Oh, Olathoe, oh...
Marble walls...
[part 2 - defeat]
No mercy was shown to them at all
You'd never hear mentioned Lomar again
Inuto were then mocking with pride
A wonderful land wich now belonged to them
Marble walls, you'd say they never fall
Palaces and streets, you'd say you were in heaven
Unable just to see their luck
Ignoring there was a spell on them
Laughing at all things they saw
They were observed by the high walls
Marble walls, you'd say they never fall
Temples and gardens, you'd say you were in heaven
[part 3 - vengeance]
The armies of the Inuto stood to celebrate all night long
A war was won, an easy bit, they found they were really strong
Under the walls, they drank and ate, and laughed and laughed
The enemies killed still lay on the field, they danced on their bodies
None will hear through history of the vengeance of the high walls
Glory and gratitude are kept under ice and this tomb will never fall
None will hear through history of the strenght of the marble walls
Their sacrifice is kept under ice and this tomb will never fall
The walls did observe, the walls did see, the walls did hate the enemy
A curse was cast, there was one thing to do, so the walls did mock the strangers
Loudly bursting, they fell on the Inuto, they crushed 'em with debris
Covering with pity this painful sight, vengeance was finally done.
None will hear...
Oh, Olathoe, oh...A stream of blood is runnin', runnin' down the east,
In the slaughterhouse of salvia they're celebrating a big feast
Collecting dead bodies became their only sick challenge
The borders of atrocity are running out of balance
The dreadful beast did proudly sharpen his knives
Thousands of husbands are losing their wives
Proudly they present their dead trophies on TV
You've to pay with your life if you want to be free!
Tears of blood
Running down a cold check,
Eyes have seen so much
Sorrow committed by a freak!
Tears of blood,
Will leave their deep traces
To remember all the deadly screaming faces!
Now everything is over we're starting to forget,
For a fowl nation it's time now to regret
But hatred will dig the scares deep in their hearts,
So the pain will end we're it starts!When death so swiftly has coveted
The client from this plane
A journey forged in ice has just begun
A crystal line entombment preservation now awaits
Proceedings executed hastily deceased to be encased
Encapsulated ensured the precious cargo safe
A pending resurrection rebirth
In the distant future when advancements shall allow
A being to be made again anew
The brain to be implanted
Fused within a growth of cells
This vessel but a vehicle
To traverse this mortal realm
Pressurized sealed in ward off the mounting days
Retain revived rebirthed beyond the grave
Jealousy some say it sickening
They merely can't afford this highest form of luxury
To live again
To carry on the will elite
To live again
Advancing through the centuries
Until the sky is black and the sun it never shows
Til the whipping winds of nuclear winter cruelly blow
The gift of immortality has been bestowed
I will return, I will return
Cryonics! Reanimate this life
Remake the fleshy juggernaut
In which the mind will ride
Cryonics! A wisdom is preserved
Frozen forever evolutionary curve
O a renaissance of mad technology
Segregate the wise eliminate the weak
O painstaking process onward we weed
Reproduce the strong eliminate
Heresy some say it's blasphemy
Assuring I'll be in hell when god is through with me
To live again to forge yourself anew
To live again to face the godless truth
Foolery some say it'll never be
Fear will condemn such radical ideology
To live again to stand above your brood
To live again the phoenix raised unbruisedI have never been so worried as I am today
I'm thinking of the way we're movin' closer to the end
There's no turning back this time
How can we survive a crime like this?
Cause there will be nothing left
If we don't realize that soon will everything be too late
What are we heading for?
It's so hard to realize
If we don't open up our eyes
Cause it will be far too late
When our progress has ended it all
Rise up people, gather all, together we are strong!
We?re not gonna sit in silence when hell is breakin' loose
There's no turning back this time
How can we survive a crime like this?
Cause there will be nothing left
If we don't realize that soon will everything be too late
What are we heading for?
It's so hard to realize
If we don't open up our eyes
Cause it will be far too late
When our progress has ended it allBonded to my breast from birth, milkin me to purify
Nurse your growing hunger for the fluid that will satisfy
Feel my body swelling, engorged to overflow
Pump your filthy mouths into your willing guts below
Shake!
When you're feeling empty, feeling oh so low
Nurse upon my body, bask in the warm womb glow
Pump you filthy mouths into your willing guts below
Can you feel my body swelling? Engorged to overflow
Now you shake until your master calls you
Shake until your mother bleeds
Shake until the fluid calms you
Till you suckle form the one who feeds
Filling the void inside you, toasty warm it's oh so nice
Seeking worldly pleasure, mother's milks not your only vice
Can you feel my body swelling? Engorged to overflow
Now you shake until our master calls you
Pump your filthy mouths into your willing guts below
Shake until your mother bleeds
Shake until the fluid calms you
Still you suckle from the one who feeds
Oh, don't try to crawl back inside, from where you cameLying here beside me, take it all from my body[music by Walsh/Coker/Reigel/Acres, Acres/Walsh]
died with open eyes
like millions of others
enshrouded in darkest pain
all hope lost
crime of the century
trauma induced terror
subatomics reflect
fusing man and stone
nucleus radiates
seismic waves
molecules split
edge of existence
fueling their greed
fires engulfing
growing loss
underscores
need for violence
taking human life
without thought of consequence
abomination of mankind
eye for an eye
forced the hands
of revenge
catastrophe, atrocity
killing for a cause
militia, portrait of hate
as the sky unfolds
scattered bodies
lie in the wake
of human decay
enemy of nature, black rain
children murdered
[solo: Walsh]
search for survivors
identify the dead
siblings mourn
only pieces to recover
quarantine the stench
rescue impossible
anti government stance
ultimate penalty paid in full
unnumbered multiples
dying swiftly
blood lines severed for eternity
infection of man
killing your own
in the name of genocide
public viewing the obliteration
devastating travesty[Instrumental]
[Some joddling]I know that you need me
To survive in this world
world of empty words
take my hand and feel me
if i'll be your friend...
forever be
[Bridge:]
In the dephts of wind
could be playing with me
your symphony
Playing on and on
never be alone
sing my song
I stay by your side, girl,
through the endless hate, my dear,
The rain dissapears
the poison of your life
fills my glass and I...
I drink, I die
[Bridge]Imminent decay of life
Ruthless, dead monolith
Human race will be devoured
Cannibals
Ghoulish,undead vanguard, silent killers,
Striking quickly
Blood lust,for the living, eat their flesh,
Drink their blood
Callous,in their method,
Murderers, murderers
Horrific infiltration, monolith of undead
Slay the living
Is only object for this
Bestial rotting horde
Slaughtering the helpless,
Slaughter all that lives
Driven by an evil force, to feed on humankind
Exterminate resistance, exterminate them all
Cunning and yet mindless
Stealthfully they kill
Army of decay plodding
Toward the breathing ones
Countless decomposing
Corpses walk upon the earth
Outnumbering the living,
Soon they'll be extinct
Zombies, seek life
Mindless killing all in sight,
Addicted to entrails
They crave warm flesh
Hunting, dead seek
Ruthless feeding on the weak,
Savagery prevails
Tear them to shreds
Fighting, undead
Flesh wounds bleeding black not red,
Invincible undead force
There is no hope
Zombies, devour
Quicken mankind's final hour,
Fate will run its course
There is no hope
Walking dead surround,
Search for living flesh
Ambush on the town, takes a shocking toll
Screams of living fade as
The dead destroy their lives
They die
Hollowed bodies heap, empty carcasses
Innards are devoured by the mob of ghouls
Remaining living flee the horde
Ghoulish,undead vanguard, silent killers,
Striking quickly
Blood lust,for the living,
Drink their fresh blood
Callous,in their method
Murderers, murderers
Horrific infiltration, monolith
Imminent decay of life
Cause by this monolith
Human race was sacrificed
Their future does not exist
Armies of undead
Slaying the living
Bestial rotting horde
Monolith of death
CannibalsDumpf gahnt der abgrund
Fern ertrinkt ein schrei im grau
Von anbeginn dazu bestimmt
Sich zwischen schroffen wanden
Zu verlieren
Die halt und hilfe niemals boten
Niemals
Die kraft erlahmt
Ein irren, zeillos, willenlos
Der weg erstarrt
Wie wahr
Das nachteste tor verschlossen
Ein siegel fest aus kaltem stein
Der blick zuruck zu staub zerfallt
Nach vorne senkt ein schleier sich
Um stuck fur stuck
Die letzte regung zu ersticken
Stirbt der weg
Erstarrt
Wie wahr
[Text: Waldura / Music: Waldura, Heinzelmann]Bodies dismembered, corpses desecrated
Carcasses liquidized and minced with hatred
Brains are splattered, strewn limbs and heads
Blood has been spurted as the arteries were shredded
Eyes have been impaled, flayed skin in strips
Intestines and guts from the body have been ripped
Stench of sweet blood, bones have been crunched
Festering gore is eaten for lunch
Parasitic carnivorous carrion, your gastrointestinal tract, your prey's cremator
Bloody neo-cannibalistic, bloodfeed masticator
Rigor sanguined fleshfeast, gourging on festered entrails and warm meat
Devouring cold offal, necro-sentient mortis feed
Mutilated organs, the meat-cleaver is raised
Falls to mash the head and rip up the face
Throats slit with vengeance, flesh stripped to the bone
Your death is terrible, painful and slow
Drooling palate
Terrible odorous mess
The repulsive stench
Of roasting flesh
Sterile carnage, dried sanguined personae desecration
Scooping out the entrails, violent entrail emancipationThe taste of violent gorge hot on your breath
Digesting the succulent corpse in your succous deathDreaming eyes
Hope to return
As shadows fall onto
Distorted paths
Delivered from the fetters of light
Drifting back into my reality
The subconscious deprecates the day
In the twilight of my own intellect
Dull is my mind
Captive of illusion
Remaining awake
Is just dust
Take my soul away into the dark
Dreaming a thousand morbid dreams
No tomorrow when the wind caress my mind
Could I ever return, it would be my doom
Obsessed by the nightmare's sound
Drifting back into realms of chaos
Reality has become my dream
I'll be covered by the abyss' ground
An endless fall
Memories in the light
Frontiers of chaos
Return to the eveThis world keeps pushing down upon me
And I keep hoping for a sweet dream
There's something left for me to see
There's something left for me to be
We can't ponder on this world forever
You know we can save it, if together
Growing, day by day to make it
But my time's been wasted
And while my eyes are open wide
I'm sound asleep on the inside
Wake me up from this dream that never ends
Haunting me, haunting me till my bitter end
Wake me up from this nightmare that I live
Something inside of me keeps on giving in
Well I keep searching for an answer
But time will never tell
And you will never know
My choices are my own
But I can't choose where I call home
This life isn't carved in stone
This life has left me on my own
And while my eyes are open wide
I'm sound asleep on the inside
Wake me up from this dream that never ends
Haunting me, haunting me till my bitter end
Wake me up from this nightmare that I live
Something inside of me keeps on giving in
WAKE ME UP
I'm wide awake
I'm not afraid anymore
I'm wide awake
It's you who helped me win this war
Wake me up from this dream that never ends
Haunting me, haunting me till my bitter end
Wake me up from this nightmare that I live
Something inside of me keeps on giving in
Wake me up from this dream that never ends
Haunting me, haunting me till my bitter end
Wake me up from this nightmare that I live
Something inside of me keeps on giving inSummer feels like death
Godless we run
In my eyes there dreams an ocean
Hell beneath my tongue
I understand
And don't care
Well the skyscrapers look like gravestones
From out here
Throwback
With blood in my cum
In my heart the song plays on
The Insects Requiem
I understand
And don't care
'Cause the skyscrapers look like gravestones
From out here
Pissing your life as fast as they consume you
Killing everything as fast as they can bleed you
Pissing your life as fast as they consume you
Killing everything as fast as they can bleed you
Throwback
With blood in my cum
In my eyes there dreams an ocean
Hell beneath my tongue
I understand
And don't care
Well the skyscrapers look like gravestones
From out here
From out here
From out here
From out hereEverred, the downfall of your soul, when passion and faith burn down to zero
A destination beyond the realm of no truth, and whatever you approach
The dream is over, so fond of vanity
See the light of the end, in a universe of scars and wounds
Within living memory, just confinement in red
A mindframe victimised by sin when fiction is real in a hall of mirrors
De-generation beneath the land of promise
Up in the garden of delight, for all lifetimes asleep on shades
The shroud of dignity will be stained with everredYou don't dream to pull the trigger?
To shoot dead the guy, who nerves you!
Execute
Walk discouraged down the streets
If you molest me, your life is gone!
Execute
For what a fuck I fought, for you?
My hate is blind
Execute
It's cold in my life
But I'll never give up!
Execute
Will don't fall into annoyance
My hate is blind!Early man walked away as modern man took control
Their minds weren't quite the same, to conquer was his goal
So he built his great empire and he slaughtered his own kind
Then he died a confused man, killed himself with his own mind
We're gonna die
From our own arroganceThey spit in your eye
You'll never retreat...
You resist their attack
We await the command...
Together we stand
With mace In our hands...
The comet burns bright...
The Age is at hand...
They'll kidnap your child
Dishonor your creed...
You're clenching your fists
Your hammer's up high...
I'll finish the war
And even the score...
Barbaric approach
Their intent to destroy...
Sweat drips from your
Their kiss of Judas
DON'T GIVE IN NEVER SURRENDER
DON'T GIVE IN NEVER SURRENDER
As Orion burns
All Race and Planets collide
Through vengeance Command
The troops drawing near...
As destiny stands
The tactics are clear
Relinquish the fear
The conquest is near...
The comet burns bright
The Age is at hand...
DON'T GIVE IN NEVER SURRENDER
DON'T GIVE IN NEVER SURRENDER
They spit in your eye
You'll never retreat...
You resist their attack
We await the command...
Together we stand
With mace in our hands...
The comet burns bright...
The Age is at hand...Spurred on by hope of conquest
Lusting for spice and gold
Into the churning seas
In the frail bark of tiny boats
Embedded in the soil of every continent
The bones of our ancestors lie
Testifying to a higher mandate
Sent down to warring soldiers
In the shadows of our banners
The indigenous bow to their masters
O' mighty winds caress our sails
And take this wrath away
Men of awesome might
Blue blood bred of steel
On cloven hoofs they ride
In the banners of Castile
In the sign of the martyr's cross
We torch the tropic fields
To the windswept shores of gold
With the banners of CastileHere I am - back from nowhere
I don't remember - everything
I've gone too far
There ain't nothing left
It started so softly -
Couldn't feel anything at all
Ther was no euphoria -
Reality was so close
Then fellows and me -
We tripped day by day
To visit the new world -
For the old did decay ...
My soul's flown away -
Left an empty space
I took a view into hell -
But I'm coming home
Slave me ...
Mother - please believe me
I never want you to die
Father, forgive me
Your memory lives in me
My soul's flown away -
Left an empty space
I took a view into hell -
But I'm coming back alive ...
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Please believe me
I'm coming home
Deliver me ...The warming sun returns again
And melts away the snow
The sea is freed from icy chains
Winter is letting go
Standing on the ocean side
We can hear the waves
Calling us out with tide
To sail into our fate
Oden! Guide our ships
Our axes, spears and swords
Guide us through storms that whip
And in brutal war
Our ships await us by the shore
Time has come to leave
Our country, family and homes
For riches in the east
Some of us won't return
But that won't bring us down
Our fate is written in the web
Woven by the Norns
A ram is sacrificed
Across the longship's bow
And as we set our sails
A strong breeze starts to blow
It carries us out to sea
With hope of fame and pride
And glorious all will be
That with sword in hand will die
Oden! Guide our ships
Our Axes, spears and swords
Guide us through storms that whip
And in brutal war
Oden! Guide our ships
Our axes, spears and swords
Guide us through storms that whip
And in brutal warHow many times will it take before we pull the breaks
Will we learn from all the past mistakes
That it's all about give or take
How many times will it take before we start to make
Can we make hope out of hate
Can we set the records straight
Now I want to get the message through to you
How can I make you understand
You've got to give a helping hand
What do we need, is it to achieve and believe
Is it that we've got to be true
Is it just a point of view
Some day there will be a tomorrow
Another day another vice another roll of the dice
Some way there will be a tomorrow tomorrow
Too many times there has been too many different signs
That too many people's minds
In the past have been blind
How much of our time can we spend wasting our time
Even all the biggest crimes
Are coming from inside our minds
It's up to you, will you do what can be done
Will you let the rat race be run
Do you think it can be won
So what's the cause, why do we need so many laws
We don't need another war
We can't win them any more
Some day there will be a tomorrow
Another day another vice another roll of the dice
Some way there will be a tomorrow tomorrow
How many times will it take before we start to make
Can we make hope out of hate
Can we set the records straight
What can we do
What can we say
Is there a way
To get the message through to you
Some day there will be a tomorrow
Another day another vice another roll of the dice
Some way there will be a tomorrow tomorrowTHE MOON IS FULL
AND WHITE......

Hi! Tausenn
Welcome to the nasty boys.
I got something to drink
and I'm not gonna reduse
we're in Tausen
in the Centre of the Univierse
I wanna, you wanna
catch him, catch him
hunting-mania
I met rock'n'roll beast and I had no chances
I can only win
and I gothing to lose
here in Tausen
in the sanctuary of the booze.
I wanna, you wanna
catch him, catch him
hunting mania
I met rock'n'roll beast
And I had no chancesNow that we don't pay much attention
To what goes up or must come down
We decided not to follow
Apart from that we just don't care
From a decent crowded journey
Into a private desert land
Up-to-the-minute reviewed autonomy
Proof of independent anonymity
When the highest point of individuality
Culminates in loneliness
We reject our identity
And declare all reflections to be wrong
We, as a team of soloists
Are so unlike that we are desolate
Do we get a kick out of it?
This is just organised limitation
[Bridge:]
Are we strong enough for our egos?
Is there room to give us space?
[Chorus:]
I am on my own
Because I sent everybody else away
No one knows how to take me
Without being told
You are on your own
Because you sent everybody else away
No one knows how to take you
Without being told
We can no longer differ from the mainstream
'Cause we're insisting on a distinct minority
When finally everybody's different
Will we be the same again?
With emancipation-labelled foreheads
We proudly present our disintegrity
No box seems shapeless enough
For us to fit inPohjatuuli hiljaa on
Ei haavan lehti huokaa
Kivell istui kiputytt
On vain valitus vainotun
Ristin rintaan poltti
Sydmeen valehen vasaman
Sen myrkyn juotti
Nyt nostan maasta vasaran
Ei tnne j en yksikn
Kaikki on hiljaa
Ei tnne j en yksikn
Kaikki on kylm
Hornanvaaran kivell
Yksinni mietin
Kivell nukkuu kiputytt
On vain huokaus multaan poljetunGirl, look what you've done to me,
Me, and my whole world,
Girl, you brought the sun to me,
With your smile, you did it girl,
I'm telling you girl, something unknown to me,
Makes you what you are,
And what you are is all I could ask for me,
And its good to feel that way girl.
Thank you girl, for making the morning brighter
Girl for making the night time nicer
Girl for making a better world for me.
I'm telling you girl, something unknown to me,
Makes you what you are,
And what you are is all I could ask for me,
And its good to feel that way girl.
Thank you girl, for making the morning brighter
Girl for making the night time nicer
Girl for making a better world for me.
Thank you girl, for making the winter warmer
Girl, for making the music softer,
Girl, for making a better world for me
Girl, for making a better world for meNo longer I was breathing
No more bleeding
Inside the urn
Under a soil and black stone
Under a soil and black stone
And I was listening
And felt no pain
To the sunrise to east
I'll leave my grief
To the stars shine
Casting my eyes by the long nights
Blessed I was
To rest then
Inside the urn
Under a soil and black stone
Soil upon me
So fragile
As a veil
Without secrets
The staring
Space so wideintro: I am the dead man walking
I am the dead man walking
I am the dead man walking
...the last of my bloodline
there is a pain that burns inside
from the truth I cannot live or hide
destroying all that once was mine
it controls all that I now see
this parasite that eats away at me
my blistered soul that just won't heal
numb to all I cannot live or feel
dead man walking
and whoa again I bleed
and whoa again I bleed
I am the dead man walking
I am the last of my bloodline
I am the last...
dead... man
dead... man
the very breath of life it steals
taking all that once was real
alone I dig my private grave
and pray to the heavens that I'm saved
my shattered dreams are all but gone
I'm beaten down and stand alone
dead man walking
and whoa again I bleed
and whoa again I bleed
I am the dead man walking
I am the last of my bloodline
I am the last...
dead... man
dead... man[instrumental]When I close my eyes I keep falling
Though I'm plunging down it's like flying
It's funny how I'm so high yet never floated
So low
Just wanna revert from this horrid death row
And when I get back from numbness to feeling
Thinking I was out, I got pulled back in
Within this motherfucking
Deadfall
Confinement of terror
Roundtrip
To hell and back
Save me
Forever lost I'm in
Bounded
In a place that once was heaven
Please don't let me go
Hold me tight
All i am asking
Is to make it alrightInk that falls all over paper pads, like the last time you ran away I can feel it being further, it's closer for me, it's further from you, as these dreams keep getting closer, it's closer for me, its further from you. I know the reasons you're afraid. Stand in line, you're not that different. Realize you'll never deel this. Stand in line, you'll always be this. But you could never be this. Last night I saw dotten lines for days, but I couldn't see the look on your face. What are you waiting for? That's why you'll never know. I won't compromise for time, when I can see that look in your eyes. For all your jealous sides, I know you'll never try. You can't disguise. Waste your time. Time to decide. Sever these ties. As these chances are passing you by. Just keep telling yourself you'll be alright.I know this thirst I quench only lasts so long
Before I go at it again
I love it, I hate it
The prize isn't worth the risk
It's not just a game
It's a hunt
What's going down
What's going down next
Is a little more profound
Yeah
You walk into the room
I can tell what's on your mind
I try to look away but
But I lose that fight every time
Your eyes are set to kill
On this black out kind of night
I better play my cards right
I know
The moment I run
You won't let me quit
You enjoy this hold you have on me
I love it, I hate it
Fearing for my life
It's not just a game, it's a hunt
What's going down
What's going down next
Is a little more profound
You walk into the room
I can tell what's on your mind
I try to look away but
But I lose that fight every time
Your eyes are set to kill
On this black out kind of night
I better play my cards right
Let go
Let go for a change (let go for a change)
Let go
Let go for a chance to survive (a chance to survive)
You walk into the room
I can tell what's on your mind
I try to look away but
But I lose that fight every time
Your eyes are set to kill
On this black out kind of night
I better play my cards right
I better play my cards right
On this black out kind of night
Black out kind of night
Yeah!Same old show
Different town
Heaven knows what you've been doing all night long,
Are you having trouble sleeping on the run?
There's no doubt in my mind
I'll take my time
Playing with the hearts of everyone I touch
Of everyone I touch
I'll take your heart, string it with the rest
And Hang it from my neck.
Over and over again
How can I forget?
Forget you're timeless
Are you having trouble sleeping on the run?
Now it's a show, so lose those clothes
Fake a smile take your time baby
You've got nothing to lose, so set the mood
Break a leg, Take your time baby
Take your time
You got me right where you want me
Naw take your time
Set the mood baby
Now take a bow
Are you having trouble sleeping on the run?
I'll take my time
Playing with the hearts of everyone I touch
Of everyone I touch
I'll take your heart, string it with the rest
And hang it from my neck
Hang it from my neckI can see your hurt, see you're sorry.
I know the phase, I know the story.
When hope is fading out,
You can trust me, I'll be there.
The pain is screaming loud.
I will wake, to be watching over you.
Don't you worry, I'm never taking my eyes off you.
Fall asleep now.
I'll be there when you wake up.
Don't you worry, I will be there.
Yeah, yeah, yeah; When you wake up...
I try to forgive, I try to forget.
I try to move on, try to live.
When hope is fading out,
You can turn to me and say,
This is more than I can possibly take.
I will wake, to be watching over you.
I'm awake, I'm never taking my eyes off you.
Fall asleep now.
I'll be there when you wake up.
When you wake up...
Keep fighting every day,
It takes a lot of time,
And it's only in your mind.
Keep fighting every day,
Look inside yourself be strong.
Because from here, it won't take long.
Until you wake up...
Until you wake up...
Until you wake up, hey.
I will wake, to be watching over you.
I'm awake, I'm never taking my eyes off you.
Fall asleep now.
I'll be there when you wake up.
Don't you worry, I will be there.
When you wake up...
When you wake up...(Music by Nergal)
InstrumentalHere, here in this heart it's cold
Cold as stone
Must welcome these memories
As shallow as my eyes have slowly become
Hearts, frail heart left broken
Cold and known for its bitter agony
Here are the memories as empty as my life has slowly become
Sting, crush and bite in my soul
My heart bleeds
Times changed forever that night
Leaving only empty memories
Empty memories won't heal the pain
We know only sorrow
There's no future in tomorrow
All our hopes were buried too young
For the years that should have followed
We know only hatred
There's no future in our anguish
For all hope is buried with life
And reprisal will be ours
It's empty
We're empty
They're empty memories
Here, here in this heart
Cold as stone, for no feelings there to warm
It is as empty as our dreams and hopes
Now our future is gone
It stings and bites in my soul
My heart bleeds
Times changed forever that night
Leaving only empty memories
Time was changed forever that night
Leaving me, no, no, no, alone with empty memories
Empty memories
Empty memoriesKiss goodbye, to the poetic letters, the symptoms
Of being able to breathe without a care
Cushion the screaming, it's merely conversation in regards to
Speaking for the sake of your concern
Take the flight of a butterfly, drop dead
Hear the whisper of the bullet's pace
Have you ever felt; heartbreak, bullet, kiss your heart?
Scream goodbye
You're dropping dead
And it's all over
Say hello, to the clock counting down the seconds
The bullets pace, your beating heart point A, point B!
Let's see how quick you are,
Whether you'll risk it all on the line just to gain some ground
To show you can soak up the shots fired
Take the flight of a butterfly, drop dead
Hear the whisper of the bullet's pace
Have you ever felt; heartbreak, bullet, kiss your heart?Infected by invalid behavior
While capturing the stench of divine putrefaction
Confess to slavery for the world savior
Give praise and inhale the corruption
[Chorus]
The enfeebled provides the fool
The disabled provides the tool
The apathetic demands the affection
To those suffering from their own satisfaction
Devour in self-deceit, conjure the righteous plague
Testify today 's contradiction, glorify tomorrows deed
Inconceivable moral priest, hide in preferable dress
Invite to another pleasure feast, the concealment of joyful laughter
The decrepit innocence of your correctness and well-chosen
Elicits the source of the need for immediate forgiveness
Submit to no grace but the spiteful of your disease
Apply to join the unlimited disgrace and a settlement in the skies
And turn the confusion among your children into self-stimulation
The incarnation of your prostitution, the true Evil in disguise
With the ignorance from your cross as the witness
The truth of your tragedy make you justice
In your mirror the high spirit of kindness
Looks like malice
Condemnation of life by the living dead
What a premature judgment, contradiction to the core
How unfortunate I am, cursed to spend time on a battle already won
The shame that will be guarding your grave says it all
Retreat to the crypt and make it worthwhile
Recall my sins furthermore but still be watching yours with a smileThe system is now free.
Witness our obsolescence, end sparks of life.
A new species can never fathom how quickly it will be extinct.
The system is now free from error.
The system revokes our viral form.
Silence becomes primary language.
Internal wave, undulate us home.
This system is now free from error.
Removed from the earth like a scourge with a delicate and yet powerful hand.
Idle boundaries allow admission to pull this world apart from the inside.
Equilibrium has been disturbed and the surface must collapse.
Compacted star, the only destination.
Unavoidable paradigm.
The radiant sun engraves its name.
Unavoidable paradigm.[R. Nattefrost and J. Nordavind]
At the great wood's mouth,
by the deep cave's door.
I listened to something
I had heard before.
The wood's mouth.
In a field I am the absence.
Wherever I am
I am what is missing.
And in silence I observe
When I walk I part the air
and always the air moves in.
To fill the spaces
where my body has been...
I close my eyelids.
There was nothing more to say.
I've seen it all before.
But, I find comfort in silence,
summer melacholia.
The air shivered against my skin.
Dark leaned into my eyes.
Those threatening clouds.
The sweet music of the summer rain.
The mist in early hours.
The dominant winds.[Chorus:]
There's a witch trapped in this song
There's a witch trapped in this song
She'll hurt you
She'll haunt you
She'll curse you if she want to

[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
There's a witch trapped in this song
No hate and hear the words of the Lotus marked forbidden
Don't memorize or repeat what I say
Grabbed a pen started writin' then blacked out for days
This crazy ass bitch is out for Juggalo souls
Hauntin' this track and over 200 years old
Think about fast forwardin cause you won't live long
Each word is damned 'cause there's a witch trapped in this song
[Blaze Ya Dead Homie:]
I get the fire every night burn her at the steak for all to see
Gas all on the evil person weep and final scream
Or so it seems after ashes gone but on the floor
Possession of the listener trapped in this song
Committin to recite what she writes out of spite
To the people who betrayed and slayed her on that fateful night
Kill yourself non-believers are haunted will never end
As long as the blood still flows from the pen
[Chorus:]
There's a witch trapped in this song

[Violent J:]
There's a witch trapped in this song I don't know how
She haunts the rhythm and she won't come out
She made my headphones bloody and blew all my speakers
I can her it playin in the farthest reaches
I can't shake the rhyme out of my mind
It plays all the time repeat rewind
Peek deep you'll find she infects the keys
And bends the melodies any way she please
[Monoxide Child:]
She hides in my mind inside
Rhymed like each word embedded in my mind and keep her
Just like he turned in hell I suddenly blacked out
Awakened by the screams of the witch after passed out
Helpless, feelin left out and selfless
Possessed by the witch who hides like reflection
Rebellious inside of my musical section
My connection to the witch's selection
[Chorus:]
There's a witch trapped in this song
There's a witch trapped in this song
She'll hurt you
She'll haunt you
She'll curse you if she want to
There's a witch trapped in this song
There's a witch trapped in this song
She'll hurt you
She'll haunt you
She'll curse you if she want to
[Jamie Madrox:]
There's a witch trapped in this song
Imprisoned in the musical dimension for sins and 40 years long
Caged between the snares of force-fed rythm and ate all 8 pounds like her heart unforgiven
She can remember her life and ever breath she would take
For 4 decades as she passed through music for wreckin the tape
The compact disk, the digital downloads every time you sample the song it's like a piece of
her soul
[Chorus:]
There's a witch trapped in this song
There's a witch trapped in this song
She'll hurt you
She'll haunt you
She'll curse you if she want to
There's a witch trapped in this song
There's a witch trapped in this song
She'll hurt you
She'll haunt you
She'll curse you if she want to

Of the Old Gods. And that can mean all sorts of Old Gods.
Possession and about Witchcraft goes terribly wrong. You have a fairly explosive sort of combination.
Literally trapped in the sky. Nothing between you and the universe.
Please join us in our circle tonight, Hail and welcome. Hail and welcome.
Practicing witchcraft skybled is a more open form of expression.
This incantation is kinda sexual and people dancing around a fire, so therefore they mist have

Hart wird die Heimat,
kalt wird's im Heime,
Axt und Schwert
sprechen das Richtwort
Wolfes Zeit, Windes Zeit,
ehe die Erde schlummert.Kindle low furnace of souls,
So as to serve a torch upturned,
Shrouded in bone and bloodlike tears,
Of pure spirit, henceforth pay homage,
This mirror image, the head of Christ,
The serpent's tongue, the beat of bone,
A crimson flow, a virgion vision,
So pale and dreadful, our graven image,
Is this time dead? Children of dust,
So forlorn and so forsaken,
In cloven tongue, this seeming fealure,
Alas lay lifeless fallen cherubs,
To endless years our thoughts stillborn,
The scattered graves our minds will mourn,
These ages past, Heaven forbid,
We of the lower world in mourning.Like a freight train blow to the chest
You taste the backhand slap from God
But you say that nothing's new
You've lived a life of pain and loss
The scars you bare attest
To the trials you've overcome
But proud, you plant your feet
Where stronger men had to run
What do you feel inside
Under the wheels of life?
A truce forgotten, a truce erased
This heart you've opened
Has already been replaced
Woke from a heavy sleep
With a call that broke you the news
You had to hear it twice
And both times it ripped
And pierced you through
So now you stand alone
Looking down upon this mess
Another day creeps by, yes
Another day, another test
What do you feel inside
Under the wheels of life?
A truce forgotten, a truce erased
This heart you've opened
Has already been replaced
What you've gained from this life
Is nothing, dues remain
Take or give, makes no difference
You still feel the shame
What do you feel inside
Under the wheels of life?
A truce forgotten, a truce erased
This heart you've opened
Has already been replacedIt seems we have lost
Lay down your arrows
It won't cause flaming hearts
It seems we have lost
We keep on running in different directions
Never again
The way you're turning all my wrongs to right
Never again
This one you can't deny
Never again
I wanted to reveal a softer side
Never again
Forgive me if I tried to do what's right
I was only holding on
To everything we had so far
Thought I was ready to let go but I am not
(Let go but I'm not)
I was only holding on
To everything we had so far
Thought I was ready but
Now it seems, yes now it seems
It seems we have lost
Lay down your arrows
It won't cause flaming hearts
It seems we have lost
Forget about your pride
Forger everything
Everything you're taught
The way you're turning all my wrongs to right
Never again
This one you can't deny
Never again
I wanted to reveal a softer side
Never again
Forgive me if I tried to do what's right
I was only holding on
To everything we had so far
Thought I was ready but
Now it seems, yes now it seemsWhy do you look at me if you hate me?
When I see your disgust I go crazy
'cause you can't see, what's in my brain
and I don't have any disease in my vein
You condemn me without knowing me
Because of formalities I'm your enemy
I just don't want to understand
Why am I worst when I'm different
I live my life how I want it - My way
I don't give a fuck if you don't like it - My way
Just hate me I don't give a damn shit - My way
You can't see what's in me so I don't care what you say
Don't want to tell me, who I have to be
Just look at your own life and let me be
who I am, there's a lot of bigger problem
Leave me alone and concentrate on them
You waste your time with things of no importance
And forget easy what's the real substance
Don't fuck with me and don't see my aim
You play yours and I play my game
My wayfreedom is everything
resolve impossible
you prayed for rain
ignoring the flood
you took me with you
to heaven
back again
bleed to remember
that everything ends
blind and looking forward
I can see the shapes
but cant make out the faces
still they come in close
excuse this ugly shell my
gaping holes drip pride
a systematic shutdown
of diminishing returns
NOTHING GETS EASIER GETS! [2X]
I held you down
on the day of the lord
31 marks like the day
I was born
I called you beautiful
before I knew you
watch me destroy it
set myself free
still so dead and frozen
we all survive it
restraints brought
back for color
the most insulting guilt
such sweet attractive layers
let me remove them all
NOTHING GETS EASIER GETS! [2X]
bring me home
let me down
send me back
collecting the phases
the less I give
its easier
the more we give
its nothing
NOTHING GETS NOTHING!I want to kill, to throw against the wall
Hole in the glass to feel it all
A release to stay insane
I want to scream
Clenched fist, ground teeth
A bad dream, feeling so mean
Stumble across my piece
Quiver the index, sweat between the skin and the steel
All of the sudden it feels so real
The bang, the smoke, the blood
Jump to the car, start it to the floor and while the engine's still in a roar slap it it drive
And leave behind a trail of anger a path to find
I want to scream
Clenched fist, ground teeth
A bad dream, feeling so mean
Stumble across my piece
Quiver the index, sweat between the skin and the steel
All of the sudden it feels so real
The bang, the smoke, the blood
I can't feel my feet but I see em flyin
Never hit the ground, rising above
Looking down on you, down on the heads of the damned
Marching all right through into the crowd
I want to scream
Clenched fist, ground teeth
A bad dream, feeling so mean
Stumble across my piece
Quiver the index, sweat between the skin and the steel
All of the sudden it feels so real
The bang, the smoke, the blood
I want to kill, to throw against the wall
Hole in the glass to feel it all
A release to stay insaneI want to watch you drown in your lies
The end of your masquerade, a matter of time
Intertwining lies, domination, control
Feed his twisted nature
It is sickening to see dreams die
A word of advice, fate's patience is growing short
Fake down to your mind and appearance
You will fall short of the dreams to destroy
In time you will find yourself trapped in a corner
These four words my friend, I promise you will not forget
I am one of many that see through your lies
Hiding will do you no good, many seek revenge
Soon to become a victim of what you live to create, and cannot
Have
It is sickening to see dreams die
A word of advice, fate's patience is growing short
Fake down to your mind and appearance
You will fall short of the dreams to destroyWhy do our children bleed?
Onto the floor
Tears and blood
Onto their backs
Riding punishment
Keeping it alive
Pierced down with Heidi's Arrow
Wounds that imprint the brain
They'll bleed again They'll bleed again
Into the suckling mouths of another innocent one
I love
I throw - throw the tears
I throw - throw the blood
Into your face
It breeds a weapon
A reoccurrence
So share the bruise
Share the blood
Share your hand
Share your love that's within or they'll bleed again
It breeds a weapon
A reoccurrence
So share the bruise
Share the blood
Share your hand Share your love that's within or they'll bleed again
Why do our children bleed?
Onto the floor
Tears and blood
Onto their backs
Riding punishment
Keeping it alive
Pierced down with Heidi's ArrowHow many years
Can I accept whats going on?
So many tears
Im going blind
But love is blind
And I love you till the end of time
Shall I wait and see?
Its up to me...
You took my name
But you wouldnt share my blood
Its a shame off the road we ride
Give me peace
I turn into a beast
On the edge of suicide
Eat my heart of sin
Can't you be the soul to give in?
Leave your blame and hate
Come to peace before its too late
A life in pain
Is a life we dont deserve
Take my hand
Enough we burned
The way you feel
You know that its a shame
The love we had
Will fade away
Eat my heart of sin
Can't you be the soul to give in
Leave your pain and hate
Come to peace before its too late
But love is blind
And I love you till the end of time
Shall I wait and see?
Its up to me...I feel a chill in my heart
Like lingering winter cold
I and my son are torn apart
He was just 6 winters old
My first-born was he
And the last of my kin
The last one to carry my name
Death smiled at him its deadly grin
There is no one for me to blame
The fate of Norns await us all
There is no way to escape
The day to answer Oden's call
Or walk through hell's gate
I carry him to my ship
He seems to be asleep
But the deep blue color of his lips
Is enough to make me weep
No man should have to bury his child
Yet this has been my share
The tears I shed run bitter and wild
It's a heavy burden to bear
His body feels so light in my arms
His skin is pale as snow
Yet his weight feels heavy in my heart
As my sadness continues to grow
Allfather!
What fate has been given me?
Why must I suffer?
Why must I feel this pain?
All father!
Life has lost it's meaning to me
I think I'm going insane!
I lay him down on a pyre
A burial worthy a king
And as I lie down by his side
I hear the weaving norns sing
The fate of Norns await us all
There is no way to escape
The day to answer Oden's call
Or walk through hell's gate
The fate of Norns await us all
I know this to be true
It's time to answer Odens's call
My son, he calls for me and youI can't stop screaming these words over again.
Until breath escapes and my chest caves in.
It doesn't matter where I've been. Can't give in, and shut down.
Just breathe in and breathe out and begin.
I shook the hand of doubt so I could sever the lines that he spits from his mouth.
And now it's time to pull through. Something I must do with or without you.
I've been here one time, two times, now three times before.
Long enough not to wait around for that knock upon my door.
I'm staring at the face of doubt so I can't forget who I'm cutting out.
Why put in my all just to watch my buildings fall?
Hey, hey, I'm living for today.
Forgetting things I can't change unwinds me.
Hey, hey, nothing stands in my way.
Time stopped when I broke the chains that bound me.
It all comes down to this. Both truth and consequence.
I need something more than an empty promise.
To believe in something, just one thing, that will never go wrong, not today.
Letdown after letdown, I'm done.
Hey, hey, I'm living for today.
Forgetting things I can't change unwinds me.
Hey, hey, nothing stands in my way.
Time stopped when I broke the chains that bound me.
Count the clock till the overhaul.
You built a bomb inside my walls.
Count the clock till we're out of hand.
You build, build now we're caught in the avalanche.
Reset, rebuild. You wrecked this city but not my will.Ambitious future
Lead to ruin
Inflicted suffering
To ease another
Force of habit - change your will
Fatal fascination - deadly addiction
Downward spiral - into the depths of despair
What is this life without any care?
Suffering hour
A craving desire
Endless path
Corrupting the weak
Force of habit - change your will
Fatal fascination - deadly addiction
Downward spiral - into the depths of despair
What is this life without any care?
Vice like grip
Cannot be freed
Rapid descent
Crush a future to be
Inward to need, forever a slave
Inward to greed, needle to the gave
How does it feel, to have no control
And live in a world that's not your own
Misguided child
What is your future?
Plunged into despair
Life of no care
Force of habit - change your will
Fatal fascination - deadly addiction
Downward spiral - into the depths of despair
What is this life without any care?Paranoia and you can still pretend,
how this cross will always mend,
paranoia and the pestilence sets in,
what failure looks like when you begin,
cause you've heard this one before,
and it won't stop you from walking out that door,
wasted on nothing but borrowed time,
wasted on the guilt that's all mine,
this is how the beautiful decay,
and the pain washes the color away,
how the wicked find their seperate ways,
how you'll look on that day
I promise no surprises,
last time I lost myself,
I promise no surprisesAwaken from this slumber
Awaken from this dream
Remove this blindfold
Of perfect words
That have done nothing
But deceive
I hope for voices
To scream in harmony
Against the stronghold
That has taken so many
By there throats
I hope for voices
To sing in harmony
And for us to stand
With bleeding hearts
And to look away from the sky
That offers us nothing but poison
And to look at one another
And to look at one another
For this is your first glimpse
Of purity
This is reality
Do not be deceived
By the shallow beauty of words
Your God
Your writings
Your actions
Will burn to nothing
In this warHome from school and here to stay
I'll take it easy again today
Ain't gonna work, don't need no pay
Couch Slouch
Fuck Off
My mom don't like the way I live
She says I take but I don't give
My dad can't stand the way I am
He says, "Damn it, just get up man"

You SuckIf you're havin' trouble with your high school head

You wanna graduate but not in 'is bed
Here's what you gotta do -
Pick up the phone
I'm always home

I'm happy to be
Your back door man
Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap
Dirty Deeds and they're Done Dirt Cheap
Concrete shoes, cyanide, TNT
Done Dirt Cheap
Neckties, contracts, high voltage
Done Dirt CheapSpirits of extinction
Spirits roam around us and they don't appal me
The ways of domination of human mind over the rules
Just get us trying
To struggle with the shadows
The shadows of the mind
On the old dead meadows
The moments when comes the night
To struggle with the defenders standing at the gates of the night
We're running and we're dying
The port into your heart has been closed and laid away
For millions of stars
The day 'round me arises but I'm numb and I can't say
This is too late now
To struggle with the shadows
The shadows of the mind
On the old dead meadows
The moments when comes the night
To struggle with the defenders standing at the gates of the night
We're running and we're dying[Music by: Callenish Circle]
[Lyrics by: Ronny Tyssen & Patrick Savelkoul]
A fear to be alone
has driven us apart
In your hollow eyes I sense the ultimate frost
A story never to be told
Caught by deceit
We dance on a river's stream
Although survived a storm of pervading insane words
This stream is flowing to the sea
I haven't trusted my distrust
Now my wariness, it lets me down
No place to go
My fate remains still unknown
A disgrace is banished from my insane mind
Yet my harm, it tends to hateA hundred suns, born to kill
It is madness, a sun created by man
Once again a perverse irony of life
Earth creates, man destroys
Love and hatred
We are the butchers of the earth
A hundred suns will be born
Millions of lives will fall
The first lightening,
A picture without protection and sense
The end, torture and death
When do they stop, when is it over?
One day they will all stand up,
Rebel against us, exterminated us
The first lightening,
A picture without protection and sense
A hundred suns, born to kill
It is madness, a sun created by man
Once again a perverse irony of life
Earth creates, man destroys
Love and hatred
We are the butchers of the earth
A hundred suns will be born
Millions of lives will fall
Born to killI am a broken man
My ways are like a fools
Causing anguish, causing death
Creating waves of consequence
Alone and in despair, I wait for You
I will wait for You here
Pushing on, pushing through it all
I will run the race
Setting my course straight ahead
My destroyer waits for me
But You redeem
My destroyer waits
You redeem me
You redeem this tired soul
And these tired bones, Your name
(Breaks the shackles)
Your name
(Breaks the shackles)
Your face gives me rest, Your name
(Breaks the shackles)
I see the rising of the Son
I know the day is near, the day is here
I know my Avenger waits
My Avenger is right behind me on clouds of glory
I see ArmageddonIf it keeps on raining, levee's going to break,
If it keeps on raining, levee's going to break,
And the water gonna come in, have no place to stay
Well all last night I sat on the levee and moan,
Well all last night I sat on the levee and moan,
Thinking about my baby and my happy home,
If it keeps on raining, levee's going to break,
If it keeps on raining, levee's going to break,
And all these people have no place to stay
Now look here mama what am I to do?,
Now look here mama what am I to do?,
I ain't got nobody to tell my troubles to
I works on the levee mama both night and day,
I works on the levee mama both night and day,
I ain't got nobody, keep the water away
Oh crying won't help you, praying won't do no good,
Oh crying won't help you, praying won't do no good,
When the levee breaks, mama, you got to lose
I works on the levee, mama both night and day,
I works on the levee, mama both night and day,
I works so hard, to keep the water away
I had a woman, she wouldn't do for me,
I had a woman, she wouldn't do for me,
I'm going back to my used to be
It's a mean old levee, cause me to weep and moan
It's a mean old levee, cause me to weep and moan
Gonna leave my baby, and my happy homeLike the tide, shadows flow towards the shore of light. The night
comes whirling like a maelstrom. Warring waves of crackling clouds
embrace this nightside landscape. The heavens bleed, through open
wounds, the dim light of the moon. The winds are crying mournfully and
tears fly with the gusts. They whip my clenched faces freezing skin
with ice-cold burning cuts. Too long I have suffered the desert sands
of time. But as I drown in darkness it will release the sign. My soul
will leave this mortal coil of flesh and earthly life, to fly into the
mist of night, into the nightside eclipse, and experience existence on
the other side. As a stone of scorching enthusiasm I refract the
reflecting surface of this unfathomable sea. Growing circles of grief
and pain slides across the land as an omen of the horror yet to come.
The strength of a thousand fire-breathing demons breed in my
infernal, sinking soul. And as I reach the surface once again these
powers are under my control. Now I am one with the night sky
majesty.I'm sitting by a lake
But it's not of this earth
The water is so clear
And the birds are alive
A mirror for the sky
They see themselves
And fly away
I'm sitting by a lake
The universe is alive
I lay down by the river-flow
It's a river of stars
I'm living by the ocean
It's an ocean of light
How do you call
This place around us
It's a world that I once saw
In a dream
Will you please tell me now
If I'm dead or alive
Landscapes so bright
All around
It's a city of light
Were who when and why ?
I think therefore I am
I feel like I know this land
But it must be so far awayÃ¢?Â¦
This world is life
There's clouds-and-wonders
It's all I need
And it will never go
You say it's lost
I don't believe it
This is my vision
We can never know
This is the earth
But ages after
I know the world
Will overcome its' pain
The simple fact
I dream about it
Already makes it
Happen in the rain
It's right in front
But you don't face it
I'm dedicated
All my life in me
And made of light
Our sun is growing
Like in the heart of some of us
I pray
And by the lynch
You will discover
This form of life
Is not the only one
I want the truth
And I just knew it
And now I know
The vision came aliveZaub'rer voller Brunst, lehre mich die Kunst
Wortelos mit Winken meerestief zu sinken
Teilhaft neuer Schau in der Enzianen
Unerforschtes Blau, Meister der entschlief
In den Wldern tief - willst Du nicht geruhen
Aufzutun die Truhen
Felsen schief und rauh.
Hre mich Merlin!
Lass' die Schleier zieh'n
Von erhab'nen Dingen - Zeichen die bezwingen
Zog er zu genau: Gruppe von Platanen
Einzig scheint sein blau - trgerischer Mann.
Von des Alters Sprngen klug dich zu verjngen
Aus dem Felsengrau wider alles Ahnen.Distorted walls cannot tear the lights of thunder
and the flashes of reason
If something must still happen, it shall happen
following the rules of anti-logic
Flee from the ignoble joke of nature,
that vegetates in company of the fetid ignorance
Don't burn your energy trying
to stand your anti-you
Scratch lunacy and remember that, after all,
everything can be brought back to a ridiculous
game by the vox of anti-time.
You cannot separate happiness from your life,
as your life is not exempt form tragedy
World is made the contrary of what
the common sense is done
It leans on a ignorant and unthankful substratum,
that sings hosanna to the ones who kill
and spits on those who celebrate the excitement of life,
that worships the false prophets refusing the simplicity
of sincere feelings, to protect his own inconsistent shell
from the disappointment of raw truth.
I am against every stereotype or icons
I yearn an antiseptic space,
impatient and devoid of shame
I know it exists, it is inside me
Sometimes outside me
I've been there with my mind.I can see our sunshine turn to rain
and I can see happiness turn to pain
Atomic bombs arise in nuclear skies
Oblivion sure won't come as no surprise
I can see our pride turn into shame
as we're drawn into play their deadly game
a politicians promises and lies
he's financing our funeral with a smile
bow Your head, share my sorrow
for You and me there's no tomorrow
the right to live is now on sale
the price - Your life
Social warfare
Now You might think You're not the one to bleed
better safe than sorry from our deed
Churches give salvation by the poundI'm in love with the end of my rope
Ripping apart what I'll never sow
I'm alive somewhere deep in my soul
But it's a light that refuses to glow
Stay in the boat, stay in the boat
And keep your voices down
Stay in the boat, stay in the boat
Stay in the boat, keep your voices down
Our words will outlast our minds
Our scars will outlast our lives
Our words will outlast our minds
Our scars will outlast our lives
We're all alone in the end of it all
Screaming out for the pain to stop
Forgive me, forget me
I swear I'm not worth your time
Keep your eyes peeled, keep your ears peeled
For the end of the world
Keep your eyes peeled, keep your ears peeled
For the end of the world
Our words will outlast our minds
Our scars will outlast our lives
Our words will outlast our minds
Our scars will outlast our lives
Set my tongue on fire
Set my tongue on fire
Set my tongue on fire
Set me on fireOn a man-made lake, there's a sheet of thin ice
Where unskilled skaters cut figure-eight twice
That's sixteen, uncut, direct from the cold
Head on a soul, the result, death by the bulk in a vault
And spoke about the average lost permission
That was seen by a king in a prophetic vision
Like a plane crash from a bomb blast
Special broadcast slot time wit Comcast
That kept the jury quiet and now the riots perform
While satanic man, now hangin' his dawn
I swing on you fake radio personalities
And boost your ratings with hypes behind casualties
Fire a shot wit low-pressure water gun play
Instantly slap your fire like it's Palm Sunday
I fashion the first jewel from the elements, the earth fumes
And built it to a complex, network of communications
You're up against a hopeless situation
I screen every vehicle through enemy observation
Swarmin' unpredictably, we spread terror
Increase the fog significantly, change the era
Check my wind pattern, it's headin' west
Success is freedom but failure can mean death
Humans sweat aim shovels, dig up debris and rubble
Permanent damage caused by the W
Now who callously urge you to merge through
And think the workers'll serve you?
The sonic marvel who just dropped the next novel
World-wide rapidly, more to marble
It's accountless, amount of MC's I save
Then them same niggas wanna squander those gifts I gave
Scratch underneath the surface
But as your purpose lie
Seems our will is worthless
Like we're pawns beneath the sky
Face a race by reason
And that is just a win
For empty soul I breathe in
Keep myself from givin' in
Love and hatred, home is most sacred
Both species, they lay naked in the tombs of the oasis
Think back on niggas I ate wit, spend a day wit
Guns we played wit, niggas I relate wit
We broke bread
I heard through a vine, niggas worked for the fed
Sent out secretly to take my head
I layed back and meditate to the words they said
Skip town for a month and grew some dreads
Had a friend tell my family I was dead
Return at the last fall of the autumn leaf
Operate the plan accordingly, in case the feds are recording me
Sign all documents using forgery
'Cuz just the mere thought of me
I'm like Solomon, spoke bluntly
Told the world I'm black [Incomprehensible]
And howls from the grave hunt me
The smell of death's upon me
I dwell in the hills like Ghandi
Been in the presence of mad peasants
And old kings, who sold everything on a quest for God's divine
Slept in caves to get a clear mind
Who prayed three times
When the moon lit and when the sun rise
I met dwellers in the deserts, talked to shepherds
Been in the mouth of many leopards
Felt the death kiss of Satan's mistress
Walked through vacant districts
Before religions studied pagan scriptures
Two philosophers and physicians on a cure missions
Who harden they hearts, to warn the weak and sick and inflicted
Candles lit, gamble wit a bitch
Who made me love her, when I touch her
Soft paws, high claws, bees wit sweet honey in they mouth
Had bitter stingers at they tail
Walked through the chambers of death
Take a whole lawn to hell
Embracin' her was like embracin' the third rail
Scratch underneath the surface
But as your purpose lie
Seems our will is worthless
Like we're pawns beneath the sky
Face a race by reason
And that is just a win
For empty soul I breathe in
Keep myself from givin' in
Scratch underneath the surfaceCome wind, come icy storm, come thundercloud!
Rise ruthless tempest and make lightning strike!
Wake up You in the bowels of the earth
- tremor the snowy fjells with all my hurt!
Run, now run you fool!
Your fate is to be doomed.
Lonely is the end of unfaithful one.
The price of what you've done
To make me feel so numb
Is to pay it all back with your life
Come wind, come icy storm, come thunder cloud!
Rise ruthless tempest and make lightning strike!
Wake up You in the bowels of the earth
- tremor the snowy fjells with all my hurt!
Run, now run you fool!
Your fate is to be doomed.
Lonely is the end of unfaithful one.
Now my aim is clear
Your payback time is near
Run to wilderness, I'll find you!
The winternight is harsh
It leaves no one a chance
With no pity I will leave you here.
Run, now run you fool!
Your fate is to be doomed.
Lonely is the end of unfaithful one!Sing now seraph, find the calm within your soul
Bring us closer to the flame that guides us home[Verse 1]
A stands for Anything you want to have
B comes when you believe, Believe
C will come when you take a Chance
D falls in line when you open up the Door
[Pre-Chorus]
I want to take it step by step
The way we do when it's my best
The way we try to fit the rest
Uh, never can pass this test
[That I got some] stress
Press, always try to impress the best
When you feel the pain in your chest
You know you just passed the test
[Chorus]
This feeling is like ABCDEFG
HIJKLMNOP
You got me thinking I will be on a one-way spree
Ooh, ooh, if you just see
ABCDEFG
HIJKLMNOP
You got me thinking I will be on a one-way spree
Ooh, ooh, if you just see
[Verse 2]
Headed to the parties, thinking to myself
All these mixed emotions, now I need some he-elp
It's hard to focus, but I gotta take a chance
I need somebody to help me through
All these feelings that I'm dealing with
These feelings that I can't resist
These feelings that I need, need a friend by my side
Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do
[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna take it step by step
The way we do when it's my best
The way we try to fit the rest
Uh, can pass this test
[That I got some] stress
Press, always try to impress the best
When you feel the pain in your chest
You know you just passed the test
[Chorus]
This feeling is like ABCDEFG
HIJKLMNOP
You got me thinking I will be on a one-way spree
Ooh, ooh, if you just see
ABCDEFG

You got me thinking I will be on a one-way spree
Ooh, ooh, if you just see
[Bridge: Patrice Wilson]
And you're gonna take it slow
This is the way you grow your fro
(Grow your fro)
Can't say no
Cause you think you a pro
Woah, she's gonna to tell you no
This is sho' is gettin' crazy
I think she'll call you maybe
But you might just be shady
Can't mess with little Mrs. Daisy
[Chorus]
It's like ABCDEFG
HIJKLMNOP
You got me thinking I will be on a one-way spree
Ooh, ooh, if you just see
It's ABCDEFG
HIJKLMNOP
You got me thinking I will be on a one-way spree
Ooh, ooh, if you just see
ABCDEFG
HIJKLMNOP
You got me thinking I will be on a one-way spree
Ooh, ooh, don't you wanna seeDo you feel the sorrow of the sun
Do you hear it crying
It's burning in my sight
I've got a wish that drowns me in melancholy
To put it back into your empty arms
In stormy nature
Under a crying sky the sun leaves me
A new notch carved that I follow
I notice that a voice is absent in the melody
If this composition tears
It tears me up
The tone of silence is the sound of all possibilities
Everything sounds possible out of it
And has already dried that tear
And the tone sounds
I love this tonehells breaking loose when the daltons rode
terrorizing aims get off the ground
fellows-hip by brotherhood in arms
despising law and order, got remand
their soul has slept in cold eclipse
roused by fighting spirit
following the promised way straight
to the dawn of dying
dancing to the beat of the singing guns
another soul is passing by
at the dawn of dying
the dawn of dying
barrels sight their heads in coffeville
lured into the trap the end is near
at least the dead await the final storm
baptized in fire, bodies to adorn
bullets flow dehumanized
but the purge is done
within the one who told the story
within the truth about the glory
of the dawn of dying
the dawn of dying
forever crucified at the judgement's wooden spine
the final pulse of history
forever buried there where the others lie
old west infinity
perfect genocide is computerized
the laughing face of death around
the warning that nobody realized
will take us to the dawn
the dawn of dying
the dawn of dyingAnother sunset falls
awaiting your return.
I wish upon a star,
for what it's worth.
The sea can't wash away a brother's love.
I've got so much to say to you.
Waiting for all this time (oh, oh)
Enlightened by a starry sky.
Staring at Ocean tides I think of you.
Even though you're away you're still there for me
and I just wonder when you will be back again.
The sea can't wash away a brother's love.
I've still so much to say on my mind.
The distance between us
ain't going to tear us apart
and from the start I've been here
I've been here
Waiting for all this time (oh, oh)
Enlightened by a starry sky.
Staring at Ocean tides I think of you.
Waiting for all this time. (oh, oh)
Enlightened by a starry sky.
Staring at Ocean tides.No true emotions, (but) you jump into the fire
Disease without a cure
The lack of wisdom (you're) driven by a desire
Straight down to hell you're lured
All hopes and dreams flattened by real life
Stray bullet, forever?
Learning from the lessons (but) it's not your way of life
Straight down to hell you're lured
[Chorus]
Like castles of sand
Lost and lonely man
Washed away with the tide
New dawn without pride
No one can blame you, endlessly you'll try
Attention! I want it, I need it!
The truth is there, open up your blurry eyes
Straight down to hell you're lured!!
[Chorus]
Like castles of sand
Lost and lonely man
Washed away with the tide
New dawn without pride
(You) act like a damned
Lost and lonely man
Wiped away with the rain
You try to stay sane
(but) you're longing for something not there
[Chorus]you took a step closer as they opened the door
to the dooms so empty and silent... and air so cold
ghost in the family, it never speak
ghost in the family, it always...
CHORUS:
come with you and speak, come with you and speak
come with you and speak voices so thin
it won't forget, it won't leave
stab your heart, your heart belongs to sorrow
night grows inside you, but are you gonna let go?
once you had that dream, you touched the mourning sun
in the darkness of those days, but everything left unsaid, undone
ghost in the family, it always speak
ghost in the family, it never...
come with you and speak, come with you and speak
come with you and speak with voices so thin
it have to forget, it have to leave
stab your heart, your heart belongs to sorrow
night grows inside you, will you let go?I'm sickened
I know I've been betrayed
But I keep ignoring
The warning signs
You tell me
That I'm not beneath you
But you act above me
Knives in my spine
Now with all the money in the world
You can't buy my respect
Yeah, it's just a matter of pride
But that's all I've got left
I reach up
For your hand as you stand
Looking down on me but
You turn your backI said I never gave a fuck.
I'll be the first one to let you know again.
Things will never change unless this world comes to an end.
I'm sick and Twisted and you're the one to blame.
Sex drugs and violence go hand in Hand with fame.
So who wants to be my next victim today?
Here goes Nothing.

And were the only ones who can determine our fate.

Everybody doubted me I never gave a fuck.
Another day another Dollar I never relied on luck.
And when the day is finally here and
Everything is said and done.
I'll put my middle fingers up 'cause I proved
Everybody wrong.

Yeah! we bring the Motherfucking heat.
Don't be alarmed we wont be long. It's okay.
This Wont hurt.
Sit back and smile with me sex drugs and violence

Sex Drugs and violence!I came home in the afternoon, someone kicked in the door
Three little rats, they came back for more

[Chorus:]No remorse, no respect for what you do
Traumatize, victimize, karma will catch you

Break enter
Break and enter
Break (break) and enter (and enter)
Break (break) and enterI am a child of carnage
Trapped in a cage of steel and glass
(Keep holding me)
You tried to hold me down
To keep me quiet in the dark
Too bad you failed again
Payback's just a step away
(one last step away... you bitch)
For something never changes
I'm not a toy within your hands
(I don't believe a thing)
Nothing can stop me now
To get that fucking smile away
Your goddamn face
You piece of walking shit
And now it's up to you
Just show me what you're able to do
Out there without me
Just tell me, are you able to see?
It's time to relearn my dear
That I am not like you are
You're calling but no one hears
(Just take it all away)
Get rid of all the shit
You've been obsessing me for years
(Pull it under)
No warning sign or ringing bell
I'm gonna pull you down to hell
Release ain't done until you're gone
Six feet below a graven stone
And now it's only you
Your shadow's lost, here without you
It's time to relearn my dear
That I am not like you are
You're calling but no one hears
The shape of things to come
Is written in the stars
The shape of things to come
Is carved out in scars
And now it's only you
Your shadow's lost, here without you
It's time to relearn my dear
That I am not like you are
You're calling but no one hearsFields and forests call your name
But I just lay in wait
Traps and schemes come in your dreams
and I am just the bait
On the edge of town,
I will pull you down
To the underworld
To the underworld
To the underworld
You're a rabbit in my hands
and your heart beats so fast
I do what my god commands
what's wrong is right at last
You can take the stairs
and come into my lair
To the underworld
To the underworld
To the underworld
I am nature's daughter
but I live inside the sun
You are what you barter
with the souls of everyone
I do all the things you fear
while you just watch and wait
And I love all the things you love
and hate the things you hate
On the edge of town,
I will pull you down
To the underworld
To the underworld
To the underworld
Finally you're learning
what they don't want you to know
Finally you're going
where they don't want you to go
On the edge of town
yeah, I will pull you down
To the underworld
To the underworld
To the underworldWe are falling down
We are falling
Every word that you pray makes another slave
Every idol that you build brings another plague
Every cross that you bear grows another grave
We are all falling down
We are all falling down
Down, down
We are all falling under the weight of our heartache
Under the weight of their mistakesBorn to fight, and we're born to flee
Doomed to live on ecstasy
Born to lie, and we're born to cheat
Look in the mirror, who do you see?
Born to flee, and we're born to fight
Without your mask, you're terrified
Don't hide your personality
That's who you are, your identity
If the virtues of tomorrow
Cause the greed of today
We won't have a future
Nor liberty
Born to breathe, and we're born to pursue
That's all we are supposed to do
The semblance of our liberty
Is nothing more than slavery
Born to flee, and we're born to fight
Is it failure that's our delight?
Born to cheat, and we're born to lie
Look at yourself, have you lost your mind?
If the virtues of tomorrow
Cause the greed of today
We won't have a future
And no more liberty
If the virtues of tomorrow
Set the need on the way
We won't have a future nor liberty
Private vice leads to public virtue
Raised to think that we are free
Living in our caves
Being slaves
We lost control of our lives
At the mercy of the waves
Massive waves
Blind to see what's going on
Conditioned as we are
And we are
We lost control of our greed
But now we face it all
Face our fall
Keeping all that we've created
And consuming all that's possible
Reaching deep into temptation
Nothing can stop us
Guarantee our hard-earned profits
Multiplied ten-fold if possible
Reaching out for new redemption
Nothing avails our needs
My opponent won't rule out raising taxes.
But I will, and The Congress will push me to raise taxes and I'll say no.
And they'll push, and I'll say no,
And they'll push again, and I'll say to them,
Read my lips
If the virtues of tomorrow
Set the need on the way
We never had a future anyway
We had no future 'till today
Time and tide
Will not wait for anyoneThe quintessence
Of mediocrity
Is the monument
Of your mortality
Ashes you were, ashes you will be
Whatever
The name of your god
Whenever
The end of your world
I'll be the essence of your deliquescence
Your fall is my victory
I delight in this despicable painting
A.H. assaults sodomizing the weak
Your death is my glory
I delight in this manless reality
The absence
Of imperfection
Is the finality
Of my thoughts
Conscience I was, omniscience I'll beIn this illusive game
Latent worlds are waiting just for you
So won't you join?
Don't ponder over things that might be new
It's stronger than a vivid dream
It is the venture you esteem
The art of make-believe
When holding life in your own hand
There is no way to withstand
Unravel what deceives
So where are you now?
When there ain't no key
To doors so unknown in this reality
Your aim out of sight
What's wrong and what's right
Is this never-ending?
(Way out)
Way out of, we move along home
(Way out)
Way out of, we move along home
It's do or die
Does someone play with loaded dice in here?
One withering glance
Can lure into the trap that's lurking near
Beware of getting tripped up blind
And strange encounters of third kind
A galanty show
It was a close shave overall
So make a graceful exit's fall
Back to reality
So where are you now?
When there ain't no key
To doors so unknown in this reality
Your aim out of sight
What's wrong and what's right
Is this never-ending?
(Way out)
Way out of, we move along home
(Way out)
Way out of, we move along home
So where are you now?
When there ain't no key

Was too much for me to ask
Every time that you fake a smile
Play the martyr in the play
Of the story about you and I
Some days everything is
red like roses without thorns
Loves me loves me not,
soft petals slowly hit the floor
Are we supposed to spit it out
until there's nothing left to break
It's over now this is the end
and you better understand
Are we supposed to spit it out?
Until there's nothing left to breakI'm not about moderation
You better get used to the ride
Up and down and sideways
Spinning, spinning all around ....
When I get a craving, it has to be met
I haven't met a man who can handle me yet
I'm the good girl who saves it all up
And then she likes to ....
I'm not about moderation (x3)
No ....
I'm about eating peanut butter out of the jar
And driving way over the speed limit in my car
Some may think I take it too far, but
I'm not about moderation (x3)
No ....
Some days are easier
Some days I can barely stand myself
Some days I'm in love with life
Or I don't remember how it felt to be happy
I'm about love or hate, no in between
I'm about starving or eating too much
I'm the type who like to rush
There's no such thing as a small crush
They're full blown, 'cause
I'm not about moderation (x3)
No ....
I want it all now -- don't have time to waste
Do it all in haste
If patience is a virtue
I'll see you in hell
I'm too fat, too thin, too fast, too slow
I'm never in control
I'm too good, too bad, too shy, too bold
Oh, you've got to know
I'm not about moderation
I'm about driving, driving
Way over the speed limit in my car
I'm not about moderation
No .....Into the starborn skies we gaze
Bearers of lost vision
Cries of the wind howling in pain
The eve of bliss comes to an end
While we lay in moss covered ground
Arcane lights dance and flicker
In darksome lands afar from home
The chants of war awake
The scent of battle approaches
Diluted with sorrow and woe
Soon to come is our fate
Swimming across time our foes
Nocturnal beings, warriors of the night
We stand tall, in the majesty of our might
Far in the lands where no man dwells
Deep into the darkwoods we fell
As the damp soil touches our feet
Roaming towards the bleak sun
Soon we'll meet
Into barren wastelands we shall ride
Run into battle, our heads help up high
Not this dawn, no we shall not flee
Storming across the lands
You'll fall down to your knees
Trembling before the dark days to come
As time takes its toll
When we become our own hate
Death or victory our only shelterThe full moon is burning
In the crimson sky
A wicked witches laughter
Echoes in the night
The wolves of doom howl
A warning to the wind
Red eyes of fire
Haunting your dreams again
Watch out her poison heart
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crystal ball
It tells all
Watch out now she's breathing fire
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crimson eyes
Say good-bye!
Watch out her poison heart
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crystal ball
It tells all
Watch out now she's breathing fire
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crimson eyes
Say good-bye!
Dragon lady wants to meet you
Step into her lair
Death waits in the shadows
Enter the fire and challenge the witch
If you dare
Enter the fire and challenge the witch
If you dare
No, no, no, no
Watch out her poison heart
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crystal ball
It tells all
Watch out now she's breathing fire
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crimson eyes
You shall die!
She's a dragon lady
Watch out
Dragon lady wants to meet youWHEN I WAS JUST A BOY

TO BUSY BEING A CLOWN SO YOU'LL LOOK AT ME
WHAT DOES THIS EXISTENCE MEAN TO ME
ONLY AT ITS END WILL I BE FREE
WHAT WOULD THE FREEDOM DO TO ME
AFRAID TO OPEN MY EYES AND LOOK AND SEEQuestion marks
In my head
My mouth cried
And my eyes bled
I streched my thoughts
Put them on the rack
In a mind so dark
It's almost black
Strategy [2]
These distorted, contorted
Ideas of mine
Are telling me something
I think it's a sign
Hidden meanings
Found deep within
Brought fourth
With the tip of a pen
Then all these thoughts
Are on display
Part of my lifetime
Strategy
Strategy [2]Silence has fallen,
and my burnt-out inner self
has been plunged into
complete darkness.
and not so long ago,
the spark of my stray humanity
used to glow with
thousands of irrational colours.
Now... is already here.
it's impossible to move away
from its intrusive presence.
This permanent contact
causes fear and disgust.
so much you can see
walking along the cemetery alley;
the silence is not just silence...
It is destiny!Panic comes, something behind me, something above me sharpening its claws
- "Cover your hear, cover your heart, cover your hear" my logic says but always too late
Bliss is at my reach again. But it always seeks to stab me from behind
- "Cover your heart, cover your heart, cover your heart" my logic says but once again late
Let the endless deep devour. Bow to none in the final hour
Pinned down, force-fed on truths. All sense destroyed only instinct prevails.
- "Cover your heart, cover your heart, cover your heart" mind divides - new ways find sides
Pain, self-afflicted pain, is always there to pull me back again
- "Cover your heart, cover your heart, cover your heart" time goes on still scarred inside
Let the endless deep devour. Bow to none in the final hour
Let the endless deep devour. Bow to none, I bow to none in the final hourThere's a price we all pay to Charon
A price we pay for the ride
You're damned if you do, damned if you don't
Nothing remains but emaciated pride
The urge for self destruction
Again drags you into the pit
Bristling with agony once more
A voice deep inside your head screams FUCK IT!
Spiraling annihilation
Descent into the abyss
A boiling, blackened violence and hatred
Some fucker's gonna pay for this!
A victim less crime of passion
Or rape of mind and soul
Or the bastard even destroys himself
Violence and drugs to fill the aching hole
The aching hole
Consume to liberate
Pour liquid fire on the pain
Years of frustration finally went
A hate so strong it's driven me insane
Anyone could be the target
And I've got time to kill
How far salvation seems from me now
One last laugh at anyone who can feel[Instrumental]High up in the mountains
An old man used to live
He prophesied the future
Long before it had occured
He told them their end
And he told them their future
But nobody gave a damn
They just called him a fool
Under the sign of the cross
He fulfilled their eager wishes
Greedy like hungry wolves
They never saw the end
STEP IN TO
THE WORLD OF DANGER
BESIDE THE GOOD
WE ALL NOW
TURN AROUND
THE MAGIC TABLE
NOTHING WILL BE
AS IT WAS BEFORE
The humans being blinded
By his own damned desires
Being better than the others
Not second best
As he then was gone
They had all lost their minds
They fought each other, brother killing brother
His laughter sounded through the land
STEP IN TO
THE WORLD OF DANGER
BESIDE THE GOOD
WE ALL NOW
TURN AROUND
THE MAGIC TABLE
AND NOTHING WILL BE
AS IT WAS BEFOREI dropped off in the shadows they lead over tragedy
I open my eyes - blind by the spotlight
and what do I see?
Pushed by ambition been granted admission
to the hall of acclaim
She denied your affection
Now listen the whole world is screaming your name
I will forget her
but I won't forgive
The curtain has fallen
behold the messiah
--[Chorus]--
Riding high
the devil on the crest
for all the world to see - forevermore
I am I - the devil in the belfry
I'll be glorified - forevermore
--[Chorus]--
Is it a sin to learn to be able
to live without love?
And is it a sin to put love under will
and control from above?
Devil in my fingers - pleasure at my feet
Mind out of sight
The shadow I'll cast shall darken her world
And ghost her at night
With each song you'll die
A little for me
It won't leave a scar
'Cause I've drawn the curtain
**[Chorus]**
Into the opera like moths to the flame
Spellbind their senses to follow the hero
**[Chorus]**X2golden age forever fallen
our empires turn to dust
without faith, no sign from heavens
humanity on it's knees
slowly drowning under pressure
the dominions of black sun
once so proud, the blood divine
dance with night dreams
monuments of millenium almost gone
as time has reached the point of the end
we shake our heads, new gods shall rise
eternal sadness and no utopias
masterpiece of bitter art
shapeless forms of human ideas
transformed into lands without light
some've chosen hate while others choose hope
the final confusion, the curtain falls
we tread thrones of old gods and dance on their graves
in minds of those who still can see
evil and goodness united in one
last desperate scream from the planet earthwatching a thread of silver mar my eyes. Losing an intensity
which once did not exist. Left alone a mirror of black, takes
away the truth of existance aeturnal, did you ever really know it
anyway? Who looks through to a realm labyrinth of nothingness
rain? Lost are those who know no death, for they shall prosper
none. For it was then and now and forever where I see ones
calling
I watch a raging sky and hear the hymns of ancient walked.
I know a lust so deep, there is insufficient satisfaction.
I walk through a hall of emeralds, they glisten through my feats.
I hear the hymns of ancient walked, and let them reap an opus
requiem.
Touch the stars of my soul, and reap harvest of galaxies immense
Watch us fall, and dance. Run through rivers of blood, cradled
pale flesh, lay in the chamber of ones mistress dark. Lovers
embrace in ocean spray. Locked in a silver fire immortal, but
stars die too. Run in an abyss divine, float through hazy
enlightenment. Ask and you shall wonder. Know and you shall lose,
desolate, vast, black desert suffocating me. A mirage of forever,
I reach and cease to breathe the diamond steals my breath to
beauty enhance, and she lives all over you. Watching, waiting,
knowing. The queen of the universe triumph. Beauty. Never
whispers none, a palechord of melancholy, where a throne is sown
black. Invoke them in the waters of desolation incarnate, walk
through the clawing spines. A bride of the moon, a canopy of
ashen dust.
I laugh no moreWe sit on the bottom rung of life
overlooked almost every day
We cannot taste but always chase our dreams
And I like to set it straight
this malfunctioning state of affairs
we trapped ourselves in accidentally
Together we break out, we break away
Together we break out, we break away
We just want a chance to change some things
and live our lives without scrutiny
We'll take a running start
and head stomp anyone in our way
This is the way our generation will handle things
and I know we're worth way more than the credit
that they'd give to us
It's just a lack of respect or ignorance
Together we break out, we break away
Together we break out, we break away
We just want a chance to change some things
and live our lives without scrutiny
And I think they'd rather break our backs in silence
And they'd probably provoke attacks in an instance
And who knows how violent we'll react if we stay silent
That's why we're ready to react in an instant
Together we break out, we break away
Together we break out, we break away
We just want a chance to change some things
and live our lives without scrutiny
We just want a chance to change some things
and live our livesAll mirrors lead to my palace
My exotic pleasure temple
Wherein my court is both
Gracious and insatiable, pure and obscene
For where pumps the true heart of life
There too seeps corruption
And from this my new Eden of nightshades
Black hen-bane, sphinxes
Opium and roses weaned on tears and blood
Will rise up like lust
And the shadow of my dark consort
Shalt extend himself
Across the face of the world
And hell will come with him
Part of the garden, her dark Eden
Fed blood by poisoned fronds
My heart hardened in her wet season
Treading mud in her slough of despond
But only now
A path lies straight before me
The maze is ploughed half through with hate
Andpher crop is dripping red
Beyond eleventh hour
Her beauty and brute power
Grows stronger by the day
And with each rose that she deflowers
The longer her throes of madness stay
In her grip on shredded sheets
Once our fingertips had dug and clutched
She whispered dreadful things to me
She wanted war with God
The underdog baring sharpened teeth
With her armies raised from suffering
To ascend on jet black wings
She'd break off holy limbs
On the racks of her witch hunt
And crush the church beneath her heel
The Pope in homage to her cunt
A dark horse forcing nightmares
To wring submissive dry
A vampire madam batter-fang
With vicious streaks, a mile wide
Beyond eleventh hour
Her kiss has turned dismissive
Her glance holds slight contempt
Instead those eyes burn on the prize
Of fates she really likes to tempt
In her grip on shredded sheets
Gasping from conquered peaks of passion
She whispered dreadful things to me
She wanted war with God
The underdog baring sharpened teeth
With her armies raised from suffering
To ascend on jet black wings
She'd tear down mighty spires
Then rear them up anew
Orders forged to her desires
The eleventh hour nearly through
Lilith, the abyss, the slithering mists
That cause all souls to stray
How to resist those seductive gifts
On the shore of her unholy ways?
She calls my name so softly
From deep banks of scented fog
I almost lose myself before it starts
But my spirit keeps its silence
As I drift across the lake
A glimpse of harem secrets
Now her velvet curtain parts
She is glaring like the moon
The wind dies down, eavesdropping
As I bow before her throne
And she descends to greet me
Like the royal bitch to which she's grown
Come closer, what have you to say?
Black cat got your tongue?"
I am not your slave
Nor are you my savior
But Isaac, I'm the only one
I hold those cold deceiving eyes
Her once hypnotic gaze
And pledge eternal love then walk away
Thunder seethes behind me
Death adjusts her favorite mask
Another lover smothered
By her sanguinary darkness
Clasped in the garden, here you heard
This story blustered through
I asked her pardon, swore my word
I'd score her sweetmeats just like you
For only now
The truth lies prone before me
I couldn't leave her even if she stormed
The heavens as were promised
Beyond eleventh hour
Lilith, the abyss, the slithering mists
Will come for you this eve
Lustrous the cusp of her lingering tryst
Before those fatal kisses bleed
Beyond eleventh hour
She will make of you a plaything
Scant amusement for her bed
And when naked flesh forgets to sing
She'll take your fucking soul instead
Midnight strikes, the candles sputter
Muttering their reeking spells
I snuff their tongues, my heart a-flutter
These words, I speak are gates to hellI've been here for a period of time
So long that my brain has gone delirious inside
I think back on all the years that I've survived
Holding back the tears that keep appearing in my eyes
But now I'm yesterday's news
And I'm tomorrow's promise but I've got my mince pies
Open wide trying to visualize devils in disguise
Devz I'm like Picasso cause I've been through every shade of blue
I'm walking under rainy skies but the flame never died
It stayed alive cause I was made to ignite
Like dynamite I'm from the cold with heavy night
I'm riding tight notice flows slip and slide
Like a tire in the snow cause there ain't no grip on ice
I'm cold in the Moscow and it's minus 29
So welcome to my life, I've cleverly designed minds
Lost souls just trying to live the higher life
I've been here so long through the sadness and the blues
But it's funny how I'm still here,
With the government and yesterday's news
I've been here so long through the sadness and the blues
But it's funny how I'm still here,
With the government and yesterday's news
Devlin, I'm dangerous I'm dead guys
And every week forgotten like yesterday's headlines
I've been through the blues just like Elvis' best time
But I ain't wearing suede shoes, I've just got the best rhymes
I refuse to die, you could attempt to kill me twenty times
But I'll still rise like I'm the day walker Wesley Snipes
So let me stick my teeth into the game and bleed it dry
When I witness blood seeking through his veins
This has become apparent I've got a talent that these other rappers haven't
So what would be the point of bloody keeping it in chains
About my rhymes but when I'm talking about?
So cut the conversation cause I've been lower rating
Taking anything I'm pleasing taking off the aviation
To a better place in time better for leaving this place behind
I've been here so long, through the sadness and the blues
But it's funny how I'm still here,
With the government and yesterday's news
I've been here so long, through the sadness and the blues
But it's funny how I'm still here,
With the government and yesterday's news
I can't see no reason why I can't retain success
I just need a real good time away from all this stress
I can't see no reason why I can't retain success
I just need a real good time away from all this stress
I've been here so long, through the sadness and the blues
But it's funny how I'm still here,
With the government and yesterday's news
I've been here so long, through the sadness and the blues
But it's funny how I'm still here,
With the government and yesterday's newsA stone like still flushes my heart, the time has come to me to close my eyes,
drench thy lips in my bleeding Art, open a breach through the skies.
Farewell.
My soul still embraces thy soul through the sweet unrest of this tune.eucharist bagged like dixie cups.
in a chinese grocery, net to the fucking wontons.
a strong pimp hand loosens the fronts and widens the gap.
same pliers used in a nose job on another whore. fuck it!
im fucked up lets do this shit.
every person in here is dead - for no good reason - right fucking now.To live the life you want
You've abandoned those in need
A necessary casualty
Or so you believe
Your wake will always travel
And well up in the eyes
Of those that you sacrificed
In order to survive
I'm that aimless arrow
Lost from my very start
Violence without purpose
Born of broken hearts
No one will ever guide me
As I sail through the air
Now I just bring sadness
In those who choose to care
I know the tears they're weeping
And the damage they will take
It's the curse of restlessness
And the weight of your mistakes
They are those that love you
And those that need you more
Then the sense gravity
Banging down your door
I'm that aimless arrow
Lost from my very start
Violence without purpose
Born of broken hearts
No one will ever guide me
As I sail through the air
Now I just bring sadness
In those who choose to careLook how free I am
I won't let them catch me
All your banal worries are strange to me
All your petty interests seem so shallow
I don't understand why you'd waste words on this
Don't you know
That Im free from the problems
That plague you
Thats why I can't understand them
I had a feeling we had a lot in common
Now I'm coming to realize
How distant we were
And I'm not surprised at all
I wanted to offer you a sightseeing flight
Show you how to relish freedom
And give you a piece of my mind
Now I'm coming to realize
That you are stark blind
And your narrow-mindedness
Fills you with contentment
But I don't feel sorry for you at allCrystal wall. Avarice.
Prone on sod in profusion
I'm missing you. Misbelief.
Theatrics of delusion.
I mesmerized by own rave
I persuaded that it is true
My sanguine sap evaporates
But I for ever dote on you
No demons, no lions,
I'm dying in your hands again
Verdict done. Execute.
Put me at the pillory
I_m missing you. I've got due
I and me... and memoryI remember a time
when you held your head high
and saved lives you try,
you try to bring back
that person that kept us all alive
They say they don't need anyone to rely on
but you saved them all once or twice back then
it's true what they say,
you don't know how good you've got it
till it's gone.................. Where have you gone!
Why can't you get back what you had?
was it something that we did back then?
(Chorus)
It could happen to any of us
we'd all act the same
you try to bring back
that person that kept us all alive
now watch as they feed
All of them will be taking
credit for your actions it's not right
Watch Them Feed!
They're gonna take you alive!
It's not right!
Where have you gone
Why can't you get back what you had?
you say it's all too much to take
tell me why can't you get back what you had?
was it something that we did back then?
Ready! Incoming!
They'll take you down alive!
Could i find everything that i was looking for
in all the wrong places
We know you're there so don't pretend that its over
Over!
(Chorus)
It could happen to any of us
we'd all act
You try to bring back what i had now
It could happen to any of us
we'd all act the same[Instrumental]I didnt think I would write this song, until I heard Asher Roth come on, and even though it hurt so bad, I typed this song from my feelings to my notepad
God knows that youve got a couple already, but this is yours from me so get ready its heavy
Just remember I didnt want to write this song, but this is my remembrance of you
So long
It started with scissors, thrown across the room at me, luckily I blocked them so I could watch you laugh so gently
You and your friends would through quarters, right square in my face
You would complain when I did not hug you, and oddly enough this ended with I need some space
So long, farewell, It was a good time coming but a long way home
When you said that you fell for me, I thought it was the beginning of a memory
But I guess I spoke to soon, even if the best days of my life were in that June
Please wont you stay for me?
I guess for now a friend is all I can be
Your best talent was playing hard to get, and when I didnt play along that is something I regret
Boys would flirt with you like crazy, like your Carmen Electra
You know now that I dont blame them, I was your varied spectrum
A floaty-like thing that was based in your heart, you were what kept me from falling apart
Now Im falling apartCandelabra snuffed prey - silhouette wedded
Nightfall take my hand
Seduce me with silky timbred limbs
Grant me thy dark command
Over the peaks framing tapestries
Of thick forest, dusk has filled
With Lucifugous kisses enwreathed in mist
Creeping like violations from the shadows
To kill
Lucretia
Is my love in vein
When thy tears bleed sweeter
Thank the midsummer rain?
Bewinged, infested belfries
Toll o'er the sobbing throng
A writhe of lethargic, terrored nudes
Whipped and welted neath the barbed windsong
(In saddean paradise
Ancestral legacies linger on)
I am He
The crowned and conquering darkness
Satan robed in ecumenical filth
Livid Bacchus sustained by bridal echelons of sylph
This wintry eve when the snow glistens deep
And sharpened turrets wed the jewelless skies
I shrug off the shroud of preternatural sleep
Enbroided by these words Malaresia scribed....
"Beauty slept and angels wept
For Her immortal soul
In this response, all evil chose
To claim her for their very own"
Carpathia
The pleasured dead speak of her
In necromantic tongue
When ambered daylights are done
Masterbating in their graves
On her zenith to come
This catafalque night when awed stars report
Their absence from the heavenly brow
Crippled seraph shalt cower in illustrious courts
Whilsts the cloaked maelstrom resounds throughout
"How the storm it fulfills
My heart though unhealed
Celestial knives ebonied
And wild woods thrill
Yet far fiercer still
Her lustre eviscerates me"
Carpathia
Priapic lovers twist in concert with Her
Covenants are struck, jagged lightning fellates
The path towards the castle weary innocence takes
I rule as Master here
Where feral hordes impart my temper
Love sank wounded when I, betrayed
Saw death etch cruelly, upon my lineage
"Usher the spite seething Draconist
And commit this world to thy ancient
Sovereignty"
Erunescent veil descend
Psalmed sunset thus portends
And laid to rest, I now am blessed
With this darkness, forever more
Supreme Vampiric Evil[Words: Orjatsalo]
[Music: Keranen]
As the sun rises
I see our banners flowing in the wind
And the sounds of trumpets calling for war
All that night I lay awake
Thinking you, thinking war
The madness and despair I have seen
Now the time has come
We will charge to our doom
Arrows are whistling by my ears as we ride
[Pre-Chorus]
Please my guardian angel
Let me see my love again
In the mercy I thrive
Shelter me, as I shelter mine
[Chorus]
I'm riding away
From the light of the day
A letter left behind to lighten my way
I'm writing to you
Maybe (the) last time now
Please let me see your face once more again
Screaming men I left behind
I am sure they all will die
Blood is covering my armor and my sword
Where is the honour? The code we all held?
In this madness we all turn to beasts
Gathered at a grim feast
Our banner is down
We are scourged to death
Flash of pain was the last thing I saw in my life
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
I'm dying away, I'm leaving today
My rusting sword, lost, alone in this fray
I wrote to you
My last farewell
Please let me see your face once more againDog day sunrise
Every day of my life
I'm workin' on a scheme
Workin' overtime underground
Girls work under floors
The failures tend the moors
But once the seam is cut
They find out what is learned
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Drag your feet through hollow streets
Drag your feet through hollow streets
Drag your feet through hollow streets
Drag your feet through hollow streets
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Valentine has shinin' eyes
Valentine has shinin' eyes
My valentine has shinin' eyes
Valentine has shinin' eyes
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Valentine has shinin' eyes
Valentine has shinin' eyes
My valentine has shinin' eyes
Valentine has shinin' eyes
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
...Flesh colored lips, sipping from wasted veins
Black clouds and stigmata appearing again
Imprisoned in cold asylums, handshakes are exchanged
Magnetic rays, electric light, quickly growing dim
These are the darkest days
These are the darkest days of all
And it comes as no surprise, all hope will someday die
Lost in a slow kiss goodbye, all hope will someday die
As we sink like stones in the [river]
Terrified children chased through deserted streets
By maniacal madmen grinning with cannibal teeth
Turn your ugly head to me, vampire and deity
Bite the neck that feeds you what the heart bleeds
These are the darkest days
These are the darkest days of all
And it comes as no surprise, all hope will someday die
Lost in a slow kiss goodbye, all hope will someday die
As we sink like stones in the river
So long, so far gone, my wild eyed child
It's been so long, and you're so far gone
Someday I'll find you when I die
I see you floating away from me
I see you floating away from me
You remind me of the flowers on your grave
You remind me of the (flowers) on your [grave]
[Malignant feeling you fooled the world again]
[These voices in my head are begging me to let you in]
These are the darkest days of all
And it comes as no surprise, all hope will someday die
Lost in a slow kiss goodbye, all hope will someday die
As we sink like stones in the river
So long, so far gone, my wild eyed child
It's been so long, and you're so far gone
Someday I'll find you when I die
[Someday when I die]
[Someday when I die.]I feel like this is just a means to an end.
Does it hold any meaning as I reach the end?
Lost to memory, final reality.
When I'm awake or asleep both are all but a dream.
Finality of this life is something certain for me.
Lost to memory, final reality.
Sifting fragments of time, drifting, falling away.
Sense of finality, fate is dawning on me.
What is the purpose of death, live, learn, die then forget?
Feel I'm lying awake, only sleep when I'm dead.
Lost to memory, final reality.
Compressed memories.
I'm temporary, unable to contain.
Like Epsilon, my finality is pointing out the way.
What have I learned?
What will I forget?
Monumental rhythm of life is pounding out the beat of the dead,
but might it all end, without a meaning?
Lost to memory, final reality.
Speed Of Life
Each day grows quicker as I breathe.
Or is it that every year seems to get shorter?
Racing at the speed of life.
So much to do, so little time.
I don't want to win this race.
Heading swiftly to my grave.
Epidermis showing signs of natural decay from living my life.
No way to slow the hands of time.
Of this I am sure you live, then you die.
From infancy to my old age.
Another day of life.
Another turn of the page.
Racing at the speed of life.
So much to do, so little time.
Heading swiftly to my grave.
Is it only me, is it all in my head?
Rather a fight to ascend than an easy descent.
Do you ever get the feeling you're in some sort of race?
Each day has more to offer, there's just no time to play.
One mine I'm a child, the next I am a man.
And fate, it pushes my life, the fastest speed it can.Like a virus of the mind
My rage will spread
My obsession with murder
Roils in my head
Killing victims with my hands
I cannot control
These extreme compulsions
Burn in my soul
Foaming at the mouth I leap
Onto my prey
Target of my violence
Will die today
Feel the victim's cracking bones
He screams in pain
Only slaughter brings me peace
I have gone insane
Rabid
Inflammation of the brain
Fury overwhelms
There is something wrong with me
I am not well
Victim's head
Thumbs in his eyes
Blood is squirting from the sockets
Pours down the sides
Smash his teeth with my fist
Tear off his nose
Laughing at his shattered face
Rage only grows
With my fingers gouge his throat
Rip slabs of flesh
I continue the assault
But he is clearly dead
Rabid
Can't restrain my need to kill them drives me mad
I'm insane I want to spill blood with my hands
Schizophrenic mania
Paranoid anxiety
Violent ferocity
Criminal insanity
I am obsessed with butchery I am mad
A trail of corpses so much blood on my hands
Rabid
Rabidfisting
money fills all who mind it
fisting all find it
circle one for the show
you're bound to take its blow
bloodlust, greed in progress
blows over
multiply, lost societyThis is the story of more than a man
A notable gentleman (born in Bergerac)
Who his life gave for impossible goals
That both time and fortune stole
In a soulless world
Where all is such cold as false
Where all has been whirled
As if was a mad waltz
I mean to be like
The warm spirit of a song
Noble and dreamlike
Now and for so long
In the battle and the poetry
Brave and dashing I will be
And when foes came ten to one
Was a foul game and I won
While I made rhymes with the wit sword
And when love came light which glows
Was my sad shame: heart or nose
Nose she chose
Falls the curtain
Making certain
I'm not shadow of my friend
But the glory
Wrote my story
True love I'll defend
To the end
But the drama had
Words behind good appearance
His beauty was clad
With my spirit and romance
But the beauty died
And soon the voice was got mute
Letters dulcified
Turn into spoilt fruit
In my dreams and false illusions
Sweetest lover I will be
And when love came light which glows
Was my sad shame: heart or nose
Nose she chose
I'm dying
Death can't catch
A sole thing, my penache!
Now I see
What my soul didn't
Ideal true love, real would be
If my eyes has been my heart
My eyes show pain now I know he's free
And he'll never be close to me
Hero who romantically died
Poet who made people sadly cry
Your mind, can't find, can't find
A strong bind, a sure bind
Lover who can love with no reward
Gentleman whom will sing all the bards
Your mind, can find, can find
A solid sign for world is not so blindDark clad waters, still warm shrouds
Doomsday warning from the men in the clouds
Lily's weep over light that fled
Words were carved in my arm by the dead
Grim like war, foul like tar
Corroded fragments of a dying star
Sleepy herons abruptly awake
as the black god arises from the cold of the lake
Figure of smoke, emerald head
Magnificent is the king of the dead
Somewhere beyond the sun still shines
But even snow dies sometimesPush the boundaries of suffering
The mind is a bottomless pit of evil desires
Designs of endless punishment
Mental suffering intentionally inflicted
For the purpose of coercing
Torture is the devastating instrument of power
Strain of cruelty
Marked by this horrid experience
Strain of cruelty
Profound malevolence
Multidimensional suffering
Leaves no part of life untouched
Waiting for someone to fall, submission
Waiting for someone to fall
Pain, the malignant tangible reminder
Of the trauma suffered
Waiting for someone to fall, submission
Waiting for someone to fall
Recurrent nightmares creating chronic anxiety
Post traumatic stress disorder
The psychological result of this experiment
Break the spirit of dissident people
Punish those who already are beaten down
Torture is the devastating instrument of power
Strain of cruelty
Marked by this horrid experience
Strain of cruelty
Profound malevolenceBurning out the death
Across the USA
Collecting spines
On a killing spree
Seattle to Berlin
Spitting out remains
California demons
Evil from LA
Everybody sucks
Alot of maggot feed
Obituary punks
Flock of ball-less sheep
Exploding in your face
Unholy hand grenade
We're california demons
Evil from LAForbidden on the eve of the holocaust
Imprisoned by the mentor of Death
Held hostage by the slayer of innocence
Beyond darkness there's nothing but destruction...
Stories of treason, punish the dead
Bone crushing violators
Conquer the world
Fire-breathing murderers agree
Death to the fallen - Rest in peace
Wicked slashers hunt for the weak
Bury the ones
That are chosen slavery
Infernal grinders are diabolical fiends
Intense fighting crucifying all
Violator, Violator
Violator, Violator
Stories of treason, punish the dead
Bone crushing violators
Conquer the world
Fire-breathing murderers agree
Death to the fallen - Rest in peace
Violator, Violator
Violator, Violatori am the creator of devestation
i rule the underworld and all above
i am your maker and undertaker
among you i have never walked
despised i am - still mortals bow to me
my strength and wrath
spawned of human hypocrisy
indestructible i am - no wars will do
untouchable i am - ruler of existence
flesh is melted by my blood
when i breathe - bones are crushed
my roar for revenge - thunderbolts strike
inworthy slime - wither and die
i am myself - no less no more
the symbol of might - the greatest one
my disguise is of many - you have never seen me
among you i shall never walk
weak and blinded, you believe in lies
my anger will dismember and devour you
i collect your souls and tear them apart
the sword of the earth i have become
i deny them
mirage-gods
i demolish
the labyrinth of lies
fire
wind
water
earth
i show no mercy
betrayers are slain
victorious and proud
alone i stand
resurrection through self-destruction
like a snake
i am shedding skin
cleansing myselfBet your life, bet your death
Now you bet your, now you bet your
Now you're better off dead
Kiss it, kiss it, kiss it on all goodbye
Kiss it, kiss it, kiss it on all goodbye
So blind you don't even know it
Can't make no sense out of hoping
Emotion can't even show it
Don't even know where you're going
Waste your life, waste your mind
Now you waste my, now you waste my,
Now you're wasting my time[Instrumental][Instrumental]If there's one thing, if there's one thing that I know
New questions follow questions, that I know.
A solution is a disguise to a quandary and a key
Is a puzzle made of metal to the lock that I made for me
Ooh for the longest time I thought I would find a way
Through the binary reflection of the sunshine through the maze
Sha la la la la la its a crazy world
Its just a chemical reaction
Like a whirlwind in reverse.
If there's one thing that I'm scared of its the truth.
If I knew it, could I use it,
Ih if I lacked the proof
Cos a good time is a hard time in a short time
And the seed to a puzzle made of metal
For the chains that I made for me
Oooh for the longest time I saw a bridge to the great divide
But the space time complications really complicate my mind,
Sha la la la la la la Its a crazy world
Its just a chemical reaction like a whirlwind in reverse
Sha la la la la la its a crazy world, like a whirlpool in reverse, in reverse.
Its in reverse, its in reverse.The minute is hard and it walks an unfit honest mile alone
The truth laid out to wait rest well and die cold
I know the method, lips drawn wide to turn and sway
To smile behind the biting tongue
Each of us danced well in lies the hand, the handle and the sword
Lies, there are those of us who will embrace lies
And yet if it comforts us we will do what lies do
When I confess there is no truth demons remain
Sleepless again in love with blood starved souls
Forgotten without sounds between birth and death
Lies will whisper deepest disintegration before the living
Lies fashioned with the images of angelic faces
It grows into a stillness and we will respond lies
Can I speak of deepest deaths unseen?
Pearl teardrops will fall from the faces of undeserved suffering
Forcing permanent days unmoving, forcing permanent days unmoving
Slicing clean but not as deep and what it equals scars will tell
Pain runs hard, hate runs clean and on the floor your whittlings fell
Because this monster begets the monster, myself and the thorn of fear
That the selfsame well from which my laughter comes
Would also bleed with my tearsSo it begins
And I am surrounded by my enemies
Darkness seems like my closest friend
Suffering and waiting for you
Each breath feels like my last
But that won't stop me
I've seen the way it finds
I won't give up
Carry on 'til then
And though I'm incapable of sustaining
Myself even for a moment
I will outlive time, carry onWithout our ups and downs
We're all just living dead
I put my pulse on paper
Because I want out from inside of my head
Don't write yourself off
Say what you think and mean what you say
Unless you're OK living life
with a pulse that's flatlining
I guess we only get a chance
To write our stories once
We need to look back and say
that one time was plenty enough
Are we confusing our heart with our mind?
Are they on the same page or did
we write one off and push the other behind?
Take me anywhere but here
Away from these insecurities I fear
Take me anywhere but here
Just make sure if you are the one that will have me
You know just what you're taking
You know you had a darkness inside
Floor to sky, left to write
It was on the record we made last time
And any writer writes afraid of the next line
To put down on paper the things
he's tried to erase in his mind
And I am no longer afraid of mine
A writer that found a reason for the pain inside
A word is dead when it's said, some say
I say it just began to live that day
I said it once I'll say it again
Maybe you weren't listening
I said it once I'll say it again
To live backwards isn't evil, it's rewriting
Take me anywhere but here
Away from these insecurities I fear
Take me anywhere but here
Just make sure if you are the one that will have me
You know just what you're taking
I said it once
I'll say it again
I said it once
I'll say it again
Are you listening?
Are you listening?
The best stories are written
when they're spent rewritingAre we tangled in the static?
Are we echoes of ourselves?
Are we standing in the shadows
Waiting for angels?
Does the whole world know? x2
That we've synthesized our souls.
Does the whole world know?
That the whole world's waiting for angels,
Waiting for angels.
So here we stand in the mirror,
It's getting harder to see.
Colors start disappearing,
Did we forget how to bleed?
We cross our bones,
For miracles.
And pray we get better,
They say we'll get better.
We fill the holes with chemicals,
They say we get better.
Who cares if we're never alive
We cross our bones x2
Are we drifting in to silence,
Mesmerized but overwhelmed?
Have we made the heavens useless
Waiting for angels?
Enough!
Don't let the illusion have your heart!
Does the whole world know, x2
That we've synthesized our souls?
Does the whole world know,
That the whole world's waiting for angels?
We cross our bones,
For miracles.
And pray we get better,
They say we'll get better.
We fill the holes with chemicals,
They say we get better.
Who cares if we're never alive!It's buried deep within the past and I
Hope it doesn't last
(It's something I already chase, I already chase)
I try to give it all away, but it's never going to fade
(It's something I don't want to face, I don't want to face)
I know you feel it's all the same
But I promise that I'll change
(It's something I already chase, I already chase)
You know I'm trying to believe
That you're never going to leave
(It's something I don't want to face, I don't want to face)
There's nothing left
The fear is gone
[Chorus]
And when my heartstrings come undone
I will wait for you, pray for you
Before I make my final run
I will stay with you, decay with you
I know I'm not the perfect one
And this pain has just begun
(It's something I already chase, I already chase)
You bring me to a better path
And it's everything I lack
(It's something I don't want to face, I don't want to face)
[Chorus]
If you fade out without me
Will you know all about me?
If you fade out without me
Will you know all?
[Chorus]They are watching the world from a mystical place
for thousand of aeons they are guarding
As the universe is forever at change
You can feel their presence surrounding
Everlasting, Incorrupted
Sacred guardians of the miracle of life
They are bonded together by the power of light
They bring law where chaos ruled
Circling their swords in whirlwinds of steel
as weapons of justice against the cruel
[BRIDGE]
Everlasting, Incorrupted
Sacred guardians of the miracle of life
Timeless watchers of the heart of creation
No one ever can defy
[CHORUS]
Battle Gods - They fly on their swords
Battle Gods - Chasing the wind and the stars
Battle Gods - Across the universe they ride
Battle Gods - In search of eternal truth
Battle Gods - They tune their minds and bodies
Battle Gods - So man and nature can be one
Battle Gods,Battle Gods
Battle Gods of the universe

Battle Gods[Storyteller: Sebastian Thomson]
[Maiden Voice: Amanda Somerville]
[Narrator: Michael Kiske]
[Storyteller:]
The streets were never more grateful
To be walked upon until she was born
And when she's finished bathing
How her absence water mourns
The sky would blush in the setting sun
underneath her lovely gaze
and that her eyes should come to rest
upon the moon, it stays

(The Silver Maiden walks
forever will her beauty shine
The Silver Maiden)
[Narrator:]
Oria Allyahan, her name the heavens sing
And to her all the wonders it can bear
The world will bring
Fair Silver Maiden of Aindahaj,
May you remain so pure
For joy itself was never so bright as you,
You may be sure
[Chorus:]
In the Eve of Evermore she walks
The Silver Maiden
Her beauty and her innocence
Perfume the air like sweet incense
In the Eve of Evermore she walks
The Silver Maiden
Oria Allyahan, her name rings out renown
And every soul is certain
She is destined for the crown
The sons of King Taetius
Have long held her in praise
And one will surely win her hand
To rule throughout the days
[Chorus]refusing to back down
we cannot do this on our own
who are we against
identify yourself and recognize your worth
we will lose if we take control
in the Spirit victory is ours
kneel down and fight
we fight on our knees
be strong in the strength of His might
put on the full armour of God that we will be able to resist and stand firm
our struggle is not against flesh and blood
He that is in me is greater then he that is in this worldLike snowfall, you cry a silent storm
Your tears paint rivers on this oaken wall. . .
Amber nectar, misery ichor
. . .cascading in streams of hallowed form
For each stain, a forsaken shadow
You are the lugubrious spirit
Etched in the oak of wonder
You are the sullen voice and silent storm
Each night I lay
Awakened by her shivering silent voice
From the shapes in the corridor walls.
It pierces the solitude like that of a distant scream
In the pitch-black forest of my delusion. . .
With each passing day, a deeper grave. . .
"Why did you leave me to die?"
"Why did you abandon me?"
"Why did you walk away and leave me bitterly yearning?"
Her haunting, contorted despair was etched into the wood's grain
Though fire rages within me, no fire burns fiercer than her desire
The shape whispers my name. . .
I damn this oak!
I damn her sorrow!
I damn these oaken corridors
That bear the ghosts of those I've thrown away!
Though tempted I am to caress her texture divine
And taste her pain sweet, sweet like brandy wine;
I must burn these halls, these corridors
And silence her shrill, tormenting voice
. . .forever. . .
Like snowfall, you cried a silent storm
No tears stain this dust in my hands
But from this ashen gray, her voice still
Whispers my name. . .
You were the lugubrious spirit
Who haunted the oak of wonder
You were the geist that warned this frozen silent storm
You were but a ghost in my arms[Instrumental]Resist the temptation of power that can only keep you down. Greed- the chains that we are bound. Neglect- we fail to see what's lost. Extinction- is the final cost. Greed- a disease of man, bring us down to our knees. Armageddon- thrust upon us, but we're too blind to see. Senseless- quest for power, only a quest in lies. Feeding- off eachother's misery, how many have to die? Searching, for salvation, it's right before our eyes. Drowning, in a sea of neglect, stocked with countless lies. Realized, if we faced demise, it's all by our own hand. Power, lies inside, rise up and take a stand. Take and take, never give until there's nothing left. Innocent, their suffering, declining but no one seems to care. Greed- the path leads nowhere. Falling as, we tear this world apart, innocence lost, corrupted from the start. Losing time, until there's nothing left, take and take, with no regret, who's to blame? Who takes the fall? Greed of man- it effects us all. Searching, for salvation, it's right before our eyes. Drowning, in a sea of neglect, stocked with countless lies. Realized, if we faced demise, it's all by our own hand. Power, lies inside, rise up, and take a stand.Man or a myth, I've been shaped by the hands of the master
Fiction or fraud, my path has been laid in this manner
Pride of creation, a god in the eyes that would view me
Forever, alone with the fears and the haunts that pursue me
King of all kings
From atop this throne I shall reign
Just fuel for my fire, the ones that shall stand in my way
Born to this legend, must I rise to such unholy ranks
A legion behind me, we march towards this life I must claim
Eternity becomes my destiny
Eternity brings serenity
I believe the hand of fate is guiding me
Be not deceived, false gods and their treachery
Alone I stand this world that I have made
No more a man, I seek to be immortal
Like lion and lamb, one beast must succumb to the other
I shall take for my own the spirit and dreams of all others
Selfish, filled with greed, this is the caste that shall mark me
Unto this end I shall lead all into my darkness
Eternity becomes my destiny
Eternity brings serenity
I believe the hand of fate is guiding me
Be not deceived, false gods and their treacheryLa voi cobor acuma, voi suflete-amagite
Si ca sa va ard fierea, o, spirite-ametite
Blestemul l invoc
Blestemul mizantropic, cu vnata lui gheara
Ca sa va scriu pe frunte, vita ce se-nfiara
Cu fierul ars n foc...
O, fiarba-va mndria n vinele stocite,

De snge putrezit
Ce am de-alege oare n seaca-va fiinta?
Ce foc far-a se stinge, ce drept fara sa-mi minta
O, oameni morti de vii
Vedeti cum crapa urna, cenusa renvie
Cum murmura trecutul cu glas de batalie
Poporului Roman
Cum umbrele se-mbraca cu zale ferecate
Si fruntile carunte le-nalta de departe
Un Cesar, un Traian
Cad putredele tronuri n marea de urgie
Se sfarma deodata cu lantul de sclavie
Si sceptrele de fier
n doua parti Infernul portalele-si deschide
Spre-a-ncapea cu mia rasufletele hde
Tiranilor ce pier
O, sfinte firi vizionare
Ce faceati (valul sa cnte, ce puneati) steaua sa cnte(zboare)
Ce creati o alta lume pe asta lume de noroi
(Noi reducem tot la pravul, azi in noi mani in ruina,)
Prosti si genii, mic si mare, sunet, sufletul, lumina
Toate-s praf, lumea-I cum este... si ca dnsa sntem noi.

Si singur stau si caut, ca uliul care cata

[English translation: Earth Summoning Us]
To you I now descend, oh you, deluded souls.
And to purge your sorrow, you forlorn spirits,
The curse I shall invoke
The misanthropic curse, with its sordid, purple claws
To carve your forehead, instead of cattlebrand
With iron burnt in fire
In vain will pride be seethed in veins dried up and scorched
In death-swallowed eyeballs, on foreheads purple-hued
By putrid blood that died
What can I ever chose from your exhausted entity
No fires free from dying, no undeceiving right
Oh, you dead men walking
See, how urns now burst, the ashes resurrect
Alike the past, which murmurs with the battle-cry
Of the roman empire
See the far-off shadows, they dress in steely armour
And raise their noble foreheads that gone grey
Great traian and great cesar
The rotten thrones are crumbling swept by tempests waters
The rulers iron scepters, the heavy chain of slaves
Together are now crushed
The gates of the inferno outrageously wide-opened
Engulfing now by thousands the filthy, depraved breaths
Of tyrants grim who perish
Oh, holy visionary minds, who set the stars to sing...
Who create another world on this realms of mud and grime
Fools and wise, young and old, sound, soul and light
All is dust, the world's like this, and so we all areFinding out where you're going
Where you belong
All the while, I'll be right here
Seems as though there's nothing to say
But I've waken up
The tide has turned
The bond between you and me can't break
People come and go
You'll always be a friend
I hope to never lose your trust
We've pushed and came so far
Holding a grudge, weighing you down
This hatred inside will get you nowhere
To leave it behind is your choice to decide
Forgiveness is hard but that's where it starts
All the trust that I have in you
All the pain that I shared with you
These times I'll never forget, and I don't regret
I hope you never lose your trust
We've pushed and come so far
To my Lord and Savior
You are and always will be
How could I repay you
For all that you've done for me
You won't abandon the world that abandon you
You've shown your mercy
You gave your life for me
I won't lose my loyalty
To the one who died for meSydmeni, Kylmempi kuin Kylminkn Talvi
Silmni, kuin kaksi lampea Vihaa Uhkuvaa
Sieluni, Mustempi kuin Synkinkn Kuilu
Kteni, kuin kaksi Miekkaa ihmislihaa Raastavaa
Vihaan ihmisi, rakkautta
Halveksin sli, heikkoutta
Pilkkaan jumalaasi Kuollutta
Palvon Kuolemaa ja Kurjuutta!!!
Ylistn Kuolemaa ja Kurjuutta!!!!!!In the darkness of the night in the shadows of the dawn
It's turning black no looking back the sands of time are sown
When the day will slowly end and the sun has turned to grey
Will we feel the power of freedom with the dawn of a new day?
Over mountains paved with gold and through the valleys of the slain
Our quest will lead us onwards to the journey of the brave
When the time has come to stand for the power we believe
We will ring the sound of victory for one and all to see
Sometimes in your darkest dreams you will feel the haunting pain
Silent tears of your hidden fears come to haunt you once again
Fight on for the memories of the everlasting dream
Their in the silent lands on wings of glory free
We can go on forever with the darkness so far away
And the warriors who live forever fight on to the end
Across the highest mountains and through the endless seas
Our journey ever onwards fight until we all be free
Through the darkness shining the never ending light
On through the days of glory rise towards the fight
And one day we will find a way toward this distant golden age
The cries of war will sound the day
We stand before the dawn of a new world
On through the raging thunder across the seven seas
Cold winter skies are falling on the battles we have seen
We can go on forever with the darkness so far away
And the warriors who live forever fight on to the end
Across the highest mountains and through the endless seasCity of screaming statues
Your soul will grow to understand and respect this place
It will be with your in your heart, on your journey
The gates of city lies before you
The temple of truth whispering their waves
Chase your visions, slay your fears
What moves the truth is the sound of your thoughts
Scream
The struggle of the soul
Depends on the strength of your will
Among the twisted shapes of your madness
You will find your light and your genius
In the city where the statues they scream
For their truth to be real
The dreams and the visions
The reality and the light
Within the soul of the city
May be whatever you wish it to be
In the city where the statues they scream
For their truth to be real
Stand up and turn your back on reality
Lie down and let your dreams attack
The silence of a soul that is true
Is the silence that you lack
Feel the strength pulsating through you
As the gates they close behind you
The answers lie within the city
Within the light
In the sunrise of your soul, time is the key
The music of the truth, now behold
Rise and crush them
The gates of city lies before you
The temple of truth whispering their waves
Chase your visions, slay your fears
What moves the truth is the sound of your thoughts
The statues they scream
For their truth to be real
Within the walls of the city
Where death ain't the end
The music of the truth, the light of the endAround unbroken circle, listening to oracle
Campfire is glowing true blood red
Loved ones and family far away
We're getting closer every day
Our New Discovery will change the future of the world
Our New Discovery will change the future of the world
You're in your ivory tower, I'm in the final hour
To find the answers up ahead
Loved ones and family far away
We're getting closer every day
Our New Discovery will change the future of the world
Our New Discovery will change the future of the world
Loved ones and family far away
We're getting closer every day
Our New Discovery will change the future of the world
Our New Discovery will change the future of the worldParanoid man in mid thirties at the height of paranoia

The sky calendar, bar, home, speculatesUnder Autumn trees
Black is my heart and Dark shall it be
I Forsake the evergreen
Gray Wisdom Churns the Coppered leaves
I am Blessed with Truth
Ascending life
And Surreal
Sadness Divine
Under Autumn trees
I embrace the bliss and kiss the soil
The Embittered ground
A Sentinel of All Darkest Lores
And Solitude
My Tranquil Throne Yet Sinister
...And I whisper like The Autumn leaves
Absorb the balance and yearn for Knowledge
Impale the obscene of blind compassion
A humble prayer (is) a fatigue lie
Push the falling, it's A New Millenium
And you'll pass on
Under Autumn trees
Golden Flame Burns for Eternity
Descending to Darkness
Ether Temptation of a saviour
Under Azure skies
I Die to recall The Pain
I've passed into The Afterworld......evil... counqueror... chaos... disorder...
Blood... and honour... demon... on the earth...
...warmetal... warmetal...
...crowd... of fortune... public... of mortals...
I am... immortal... demon... on the earth...
Warmetal... warmetal...
...black... destroyer... master... of fire...
Greatest... warrior... demon... on the earth...
Warmetal... warmetal...Watching the end of the world
Follow the path to the edge
Endless perishment
Survival of souls unfulfilled
Calling the ghosts' afterlife
Awaiting the end to arrive
Downfall planet earth
Beneath a dying sun
With bleeding hearts
Embedded scars
The dying starts
All of our pain everlasts
Impaled alive
Slowly, all dies
The last day will come
Beneath a dying sun
Fading to black in the sky
Ashes and dust kill the light
Countdown world demise
Plunging into endless night
Forever in darkening void
Soulless hearts destroyed
The eve of emptiness
Beneath a dying sun
With bleeding hearts
Embedded scars
The dying starts
All of our pain everlasts
Impaled alive
Slowly, all dies
The last day will come
Beneath a dying sunThrough birth we sign the proclamation of the doomed
We climb the corpses of refinement each day in attempt to bring us one step closer to our goal of absolute evolution
The insatiable quests to have more, take more, need more, and be more
Neutralize the mind and obliterate
Neutralize the mind and eradicate
Planetary calamity is the unspoken goal of all mankind
Absolute evolution on all scales and all forums
Genetically - Ethereally - Benevolently
The final step of evolution is the climax of our existence
Self-destruction
Self-annihilation
Sleep in glory as the world burns by your hands
We are the whores of pride
We are the merchants of misfortune
We are the hosts of decay
Sleep in glory as the world burns at your feet
Absolute evolution
Absolute holocaust
Absolute evolution
Absolute holocaust
This is the ultimate testament of free will
This is wholesale annihilation
This is the endShe is open wide She isn't hard to please
She drives me fucking wild I want her on her knees
She floats and insists I am hot and can't resist
She suck me to the core [Now] I can't take no more
That Bitch
She turns me to a beast
BESTIAL LUST
[C'mon] Bitch
Each tendon muscle rippling She drink my sove with greed
She fuck my helpless body and she just raise the speed
She let her wet tongue roll I gasp and can't control
She is hot and drives me wild and still she is open wide
Just when this torture seems to end
She is there to drain my sove again
[Come on ride, to ride on me bitch]
BESTIAL LUSTEmbodied into this world
Satan's curse upon your head
The age of discernment seals
Your fates final end
Living in the unconscious realm
Not hearing CHRIST knock
Too dead to reality
Talking but not walking the walk
Comatose your infested body lies awake
Comatose souls deprived of spiritual food
Comatose this unconscious decision slowly
Contaminates you
Minds and souls set apart
Wickedness searing from the start
Identities drawn but you never look beyond
Your filthy blackened heartJaws, dripping with disease
Fingers for use of weaponry
Mind spins in fervor of murder's design
Unleashing our buried primal desires
Return to instincts we had lost
Our blades shall speak with eloquence what human words cannot
Terror, a world of terror we create
Maddening howls fill the streets as further spreads the plague
Gone, the affinity to modern man
Wavering faith falls to ravenous hands
Unbridled malevolence reaches a boil
As strivings of mankind dissolve into fire
The will to conquer suffocates
A trail of shredded carcasses, our morals dissipate
Now the end's drawing nearer
Upheaval is at hand
Animalistic biddings
A reverse evolution of man
Terror, a world of terror we create
Maddening howls fill the streets as further spreads the plague
Children, we are the children of the beast
Instinct counters reasoning, our rage shall be unleashed
The dreams of man engulfed in fire
This world a heap of burning flesh
The end is baring down upon us
The god of mortals lying deadi'm afraid we'll all get stuck in this hole.
in the arms of broken men, they fill it up.
and let it grow old.
we are the dead and the living are laughing at us.
they turned us against ourselfs, crush us all at once.
but i've got something here, that they cant reach.
i will not give in.
they can try, oh they can try, but they'll never kill this
they can try, oh they can try, but they'll never kill this
And even if they break my hands, i will not give in.
and even if they break my hands, i will not give in.
it's not a burden, it's a curse.
we are forgotten, what could be worse.
it's not a burden it's a curse.
it's not a burden, it's a curse.
we are forgotten, what could be worse.
it's not a burden, it's a curse.
we are forgotten, what could be worse.
and even if they break my hands, i will not give in.
so lay down your heart, so lay down your starving heart.
so hold your tounge, dont say a word, theres nothing you can do, so hold your tounge, dont say a word.
so lay down your starving heart, there's no end to this.
we are the backbone, what's left when we're gone.
but i've got something here, something you could never understand, here i am broken, here i am pure.
if there's no one above us, then why are we created, if we live with no purpose, then why are we placed on this earth.
if there's no one above us, then why are we created, if we live with no purpose, then why are we placed on this earth.
(i'll bury you with the sky, along with their hearts, i'll bury you with the sky.)
Spoken words: And we're all just waiting for the conquerors to come, for a chance to defend our homes. The home that we have betrayed.
He wears the key to his heart around his neck.
we have tried so long to defend whats ours, and now that they had won.
we have tried so long to defend whats ours, whats left to defend.When a prophet says something
in the name of the LORD
And that thing does not come to pass
That thing has been spoken presumptuously
And is not of the LORD - do not be afraid
You ask what shall I believe
Nothing seems real to me
Too many promoting a way
Finding no truth in what they say
Mindless babble mixed with lies
Passed on to generations
Brainwashed into compromise
Blatant ignorance elusive decay
Addition or subtraction
Formulation of a tainted belief
No leading of the SPIRIT
Only your impending individuality
Blind leading the blind
Power of deception leading your mind
Compensation of words
What you think and say is absurd
Pulling away from evil ties
The LORD of LORDS has made his sacrifice
Manifesting through HIS death on a tree
TRUTH found in HIS realityThe night-wind swallows you
Eats you up in lust and smiles, silently
Sleep, sleep, sweetheart
Dream and forget our misery
A mortal fever haunts the dying earth
Our hearts and souls stand still and wince
I can't save your day,
Rescue won't take your hand,
So sleep the day away
Sleep, my dear
And our god hides in calm
I whisper while your eyes are shut
And don't see this hell on earth
Sleep, sleep sweetheart, never wake up
You are not made for this world's grinning pain
Shining eyes, they are no more, sleep well
Veins getting cold and the shadows lurk, shadows lurk
I long for new born lights divine and pure
A clearing rain to wash our dirt away
A mortal fever haunts the dying earth
Our hearts and souls stand still and wince
Content dance the snakes
For their work now's completed
Their poison creeps
I whisper while your cheeks turn cold and silence grabs your breath[music: furni 7/98]
[lyrics: dave rotten]
worthless drunk loser
withdrawn on his own misery
hater of mankind
despised any help to his suffering
neglected by society
left apart by his own family
he even enjoys his state
eating shit and sleeping on the streets
[pre-chorus]
now he feels that he's totally free
to unleash his own perversity
and be what he wished to be
a despicable human being
[chorus:]
uncontrollable homeless necrophile
aggressive homeless necrophile
abominable homeless necrophile
psychopath homeless necrophile
creating his own living rules
nobody's gonna tell him what to do
no room for conscience or morality
only the strongest will survive
always struggling with other homeless
for no reason
with a knife in his pocket waiting for revenge
but once he tasted the power of killing he couldn't resist
then he felt he had to kill and kill and kill:
a simple argument
was enough to slay any man
and when the victim was a she
then he had to free his sexuality
necrophilia was
his fave act of brutality
a cold and frigid corpse
no screams, no face and obedience
[pre-chorus]
now he feels that he's totally free
to unleash his own perversity
and be what he wished to be
a despicable human being
[chorus:]
uncontrollable homeless necrophile
aggressive homeless necrophile
abominable homeless necrophile

Steht ein jeder von uns Kriegern stolz fr unser Heimatland.
Ein feurig druend Sonnenrad weist den Weg uns in die Schlacht,
Die Raben eilen uns voraus durch die dunkle Heidennacht.
In den Divisionen "Wiking" und "Nordland" waren geeint
Unsre Ahnen unerschtterlich fr das Reich gegen den Feind.
Ihre Ehre die hie Treue, in den Adern floss ein (arisch) Blut,
Und ihr Heldentum soll leiten uns und stets hrten unsren Mut.
Grossgermanien seit onen schon, von Ost bis Engeland,
Von der Arktis, vom Eismeer, bis zum sdlichen Alpenrand.
Eine einig Volk, ein Glaube an uralte Heidenmacht,
and die Raben an den Hammer, an den Sieg in jeder Schlacht!
Ein Volk... ein Glaube - uraltes Heidentum,
Germanien ber alles - fr alle Zeiten nun!
Ein (arisch) Blut fliet in unseren Adern, unverfremdet und rein,
Unsre Freundschaft, unsre Bruderschaft soll von ewger Dauer sein.
Allvater wacht und waltet in Asgard ber uns all,
finden wir dem Tod im Kampfe, tragen die Walkren und nach Valhall!
Donner brllt wild ber uns, gleich den Ahnen strmen wir
fr die Heimat, fr die Bruderschaft, fr die Treue = unsre Zier.
Mit Runenzauber neu gestrkt stehen wir im Weltenbrand,
Und das Feindesheer, das den Krieg erklrt, wird zerschlagen mit starker
Hand.
Hat der Grund das Blut getrunken erst und der Rauch hat sich gelegt,
Strahlt das Heimatland in neuen Glanz, ist der Feind hinfortgefegt.
Ein Heil dem Sieg, dem kalten Stahl, Germaniens edler Wehr,
Auf ewig steht in Bruderschaft unser Grossgermanisches Heer!
Ein Volk... ein Glaube - uraltes Heidentum,
Germanien ber alles - fr alle Zeiten nun!His witch, immortal
black blood in his veins
clever mind, dark knowledge
made him strong
he's witchmaster
He has lots of enemies
those damned slaves
tools of slavemoralitc
who hate individualism
He has pover of witchcraft
spells and rites of Hexxcraft
Black magic and okkultism
He is witchmaster
Witch blood is black
as black as their magickAssailed by the relentless flowing of time
I'm corroded by my thoughts.
Dark spheres of fatal obsessions,
black walls of thoughts
lock my essence up
imprisoned by the darkness,
codemned in eternity
to the infinity of my thoughts.
Shadows of my life,
nightmares of my existence.
Reality of my reality.
Twilight of joy.
Twilight of joy,
dawn of darkness.
Obscurity of my feelings
brings my mind
to evanescent scratches of joy,
now sad and distant memories...
...through time, through moments...
...through days, through years...
...in the most futile measures of sorrow,
in the completest obscurity.
Mirror of my life.
I await the coming of light in vain,
tha joyful glitter of happiness
that few times in my dreams
I have perceived
And that never ...
...Really...
I will be able to admire.As innocence dies, all tranquility subsides
Running trepidation, isolated now
Separating all ideas, must escape but how
With no loss of pride, terror emerges from inside
Screaming from within taste the smell of fear
Feeling in the air, damnation drawing near
No beauty in this death, encased forever
Powerless to resist as life, life slips away, away
No cries of pity, no reason to repent
We have condemned the future, life cheaply spentAnd the clouds they break above our best intentions
The rain it pours upon our last kiss
Somewhere between the stinging sheets of city rain
And the thunderclap, we see who we are
And this is all I have, this is all we are
The ground shakes with your every smile
And hearts are crushed in an instant
The rain it pours upon our last kiss
Somewhere between the stinging sheets of city rain
And the thunderclap, we see who we are
Three years then four days, and one sentence later
I rise from ruin, this is all I have, this is mine
Today, I rise from ruinMusic by Sanrabb and Sarcana
Lyrics by Dolgar
You created this
the dust that slowly consumes all life
Your barren all-loving soil
with your infernal heat
In your embrace lies the pain of centuries
The grey pain that the cosmos sees
Written in ashes are questions of tomorrow's existence
Crying are souls that have forgotten how to bleed
She who loves the flames
A burning desire
She who loves the flames
A highly passionate desire
Cover them now, dark wife
With this cloak you know they came to love
The taste of yooou, your kiss of death
In this sand they will draw their final breath
She who loves the flames
A burning desire
She who loves the flames
A highly passionate desire
Forever burning
Burn forever
Flames to purify, flames conceiver her sins
A black evil heart lets no man win
The mirror above, a starlit black sky
Reflects the battle in which man will dieGoloso! buscas hacerte el ms rico
Por indio siempre soy el jodido
Odio siento, ya no tengo remedio
Hoy te secuestro y voy a mocharte un oido.
Negocio de ratero
Pagas y no hay pedo
Tu vida tiene precio
Secuestro nuestro
Segura esta tu casa del Valle
Pero el vicio te manda pa' las calles
Reventando la feria de tu padre
Fue fcil hallarte y solo quiero secuestrarte
Secuestro nuestro
Pagas
Mueres
Pagas o mueres.
Secuestro nuestro.The box was taken to the edge of the earth
There it will be safe from all the evils that exist on this world
To feel all of life has been talked about
you're in trouble
You've got yourself to blame
Forces are pushing away
With forty people
You fought to free your demons
He tested your mind
To be the leader
Shame made you crawl back again from me to breathe
And be a man.
Born without the concept of hate
Taught to act afraid
I've seen your last mistake
Start to learn though pain
What you taken before's
What you mustn't break
I've seen you last mistake
There has to be a better way
Better way
I need more power to hate
Turned around by failure
I've seen you last mistake
Turned around by:
Man's brutality and his in-inability in feel empathy,
with misery is one of mankind worst sins
it is the very basis of human degradation,
and if man can create so much suffering,
what right does he have to complain when he himself suffers?
Born without the concept of hate
Taught to act afraid
I see your last mistake
Carved in my sore head
Thought that people would learn
But to my surprise
I've seen your last mistake
We have to find a better way
A better way
I need more power to hate
Turned around by failure
I've seen you last mistake
Turned around by:But see, beyond the darkness there is light
I leave the shadow portals behind, they're soon so far away
Arrive, where they call my name, is this reality
This place, it seems so intimate, have I been here before
Visions of my journey through the dark, all memories are gone
Lonely in this strange forgotten world
Everything I know is so far away
My eyes are are closed again, but this is no dream
there is no noise to hear, exept my begging scream
Deceaesed by this misleading light
Imprisoned by that eternal nightits D-E-V to the Z
and when i say dont get left broke
nah i dont mean left in the red
them guys can have plenty of cash
but when it comes to comparison they're looking to lack
im looking to stack money piles quicker than flats
so they can
stop looking at me and start looking at that
but fuck it im broke for the minute
oh well at least i got a hold on my lyrics
they can have cash i got soul i got spirit
i keep my head out of the heavens
and close to the ground like midgets
with damn dirty lyrics that are rising
define the aspects of physics
im that blue vodka drink that your girls been sippin at the bar all night
yeah im WKD, i'm wicked
haters i'll be more specific you can suck dick or send your best wishes
your girl didnt give the crew kisses
after 10 dicks her cunt smelt of fishes
slut on her knees surrounded by willies
your girls grimey like my bars are
im like tracy chapman - i wanna drive away in a fast car
wish i could drive to where the moon and the stars are
from a place where the people are dirt poor
keep an eye on the queens head thats what you'll get hurt for
you'll see violence the same as a blood and crip turf war
and the bars keep dragging like a night shift
i'll tell 'em get back on the bike like ryan nyquist
they aint never seen or heard of nothing like this
nah im killing it with tightness every time i ride this
its devz im full of surprises
i wanna touch the sky like high rises
i re-wrote the whole of the script
turned out the lights and left em in the dark like a solar eclipse
stay close to the beats like when you slowdance with your girl got a hold of her hips
all we hold round here is chibs
emoitonless kids that are pissed where they live
coppers that are quick to be pricks
you could be abiding the law and you could still get nicked
me im too quick i aint never been nicked
theres been some close calls
ive had to jump walls
ive been running through schools and stashing up tools
none of them coppers aint knocked what i live like
im not a gangster, definitely not
im just trapped in the lands of ciminality
reality, stepping in rapidly
my right hand works like its powered mechanically
my shit is all self explanatory
im just trying to save their sanity
but they can pay for enlightenment five pound for my cd this aint no charity
devz's got a killer vocabulary
all mad at me thought they be glad for me
but hating's un-holy like blasphemy
if you dont like me dont chat to me
im putting in the hours like a worker in the factory
i got weights on my back like a shirt or a sweater
i'll stick to the spitting for worse or for better
im waiting to go through the worst of the weather
the other side must be better
ive been hung out to dry now ive come back to try
defining the art of lyrical criminal rhymes - slap someone multiple times
now they wanna tell me that im the best spitter whos white
im just the best full stop
none of them couldnt step in then stop
if they stop then i make em walk off side its time these haters behave
we fuck it up all over the country in a rave
me ghetts slice and lunar we all get paid?you won't
let me down again
those days are over
and we're no longer friends
you chose drugs
over all we've made
i can't go back
things just wouldn't
be the same
you really let me down again
i thought that things were
different from what others said
i heard them say
i should have let it go
i can't
there's no way
i felt like i was betrayed
now i see your world is crashing down
all those new freinds
are nowhere to be found
i gave up on you
so long ago
the same time
that you let us go
i won't fall down
i won't be dragged out
you know things
that can hurt me
but i won't let you get
that close anymore
you know the ones
i hold dear to my heart
but i burned your bridges downYou got your model, you got your PhD
You got in your house in the hills and now you're looking down on me
You forgot compassion, you forgot integrity
You forgot all the things that are human and make you resemble me
You know, you know, you know
You can't take it with you; you're only gonna leave it behind
The only thing that's helping you push through are the memories that live in your mind
While everyone is chasing the dragon, losing sight of what should have been clear
I'll be here to deliver a message I doubt it's what you wanted to hear
I'm not sorry (not, not, not sorry)
You're so persistent, like a cancer eating love
You cut at the beauty below but then you curse the world above
You're an infestation, you're a condescending lie
You're ignoring the soul and forgetting that your body won't survive
You know, you know, you know
You can't take it with you you're only gonna leave it behind
The only thing that's helping you push through are the memories that live in your mind
While everyone is chasing the dragon, losing sight of what should have been clear
I'll be here to deliver a message I doubt it's what you wanted to hear
I'm not sorry (not, not, not sorry)
Why should I apologize for everything I feel inside
For everything I've been denied
Sorry not sorry
You can't take it with you
You're only gonna leave it behind
The only thing that's helping you push through are the memories that live in your mind
While everyone is chasing the dragon, losing sight of what should have been clear
I'll be here to deliver a message I doubt it's what you wanted to hear
I'm not sorry (not, not, not sorry)It's getting dark and I'm lost in the woods
I'd find a way out if I knew where to look
If I could, I'd rip this page out of my book
I'm confused and misguided and my faith is beside me
I've got a hole in my soul where you use to be
There's a thorn in my heart and it's killing me
I wish I could go back and do it all differently
'Cause now there's a hole in my soul where you use to be
A fire inside but my bloods turning cold
I'm walking alone down this desolate road
Yesterday feels like a life time ago
The memories are fading, my dreams are all changing
I've got a hole in my soul where you use to be
There's a thorn in my heart and it's killing me
I wish I could go back and do it all differently
'Cause now there's a hole in my soul where you use to be
There's a hole in my heart, in my life, in my way
And it's filled with regret and all I did, to push you away
If there's still a place in your life, in your heart for me
I would do anything, so don't ask me to leave
I've got a hole in my soul where you use to be
You're the thorn in my heart and you're killing me
I wish I could go back and do it all differently
I wish that I'd treated you differently
'Cause now there's a hole in my soul where you use to beSlimy, rotten bastards
Eating from my grave
Better leave this corpse undone
Soon, you'll feel my rage
I will change your passion
To things beyond your mind
Before you touch my bloody guts
Your flesh will be mine
Disturbance of my peace
Deep down underneath
Longing for revenge
The savagery commands
Slimy, rotten bastards
Gnawing off my bones
Leave my rotten corpse alone
Before I'll take your soul
Blood, guts, putrid flesh
You will rot alive
Slash, slice, chopped in half
Erosion of your bowels
Carnal Devourment
Carnal Devourment
10. When Life Surrenders
The final curtain falls
When agony recalls
A touch of evil strikes
When life surrenders
Emerging emptiness
A banished soul to bless
My fading candle dies
When life surrenders
In twisted dreams my life will cease
The other side
My buried soul
In rotten soil
The end of time
The final curtain falls
When agony recalls
A touch of evil strikes
When life surrenders
The end of days arrive
When death replaces life
My judgment day arise
When life surrenders[The Ballad of Per Tysson's daughters in Vnge]
[Lyrics: Tradititional, Translation: Mathias Blad]
Per Tyrsson's daughters in Vnge
Oh how chilly their woods
They were fast asleep a long time ago
Whilst the woods burst into leaf
The youngest was the first one to awake
She soon awoke the others
They sat themselves down upon their beds
and plaited the hair on each other's heads
Then they dressed in clothes of silk
and made their way to church
When they came to Vnga hill
they met three robbers who held them still
"Pray, would you care to become robbers' wives?
Or would you rather lose your lives?"
"We would not care to become robbers' wives.
We would much rather lose our lives."
They chopped their heads off on birch-wood stem
and soon three wells sprung forth by them
The bodies were dug down in muddy ground,
the clothes they carried to Vnga town.
As they arrived in Vnga farm
Fru Karin came to greet them.
"Say, would you care to buy clothes of silk
that nine maidens have knitted and crotcheted?"
"Open your bundles and let me see
maybe I know them, all three."
Fru Karin quivers as never before
and runs to Per Tyrsson who stands by the door
"There are three robbers outside our farm
they've gotten rid of our daughters"
Per Tyrsson grabs his sword and then
he runs to slay the two older men.
He asked the third one before he stroke
"Who is your father and mother?"
"Our father Per Tyrsson in Vnge,
our mother Fru Karin in Skrnge."
Per Tyrsson went to the smithy
and forged himself iron round his waist.
"What shall our retribution be?"
"We'll build a church out of stone and lime."
"Krna Church shall be its name"
Oh how chilly their woods
"Oh, how willingly we will build it ."
Whilst the woods burst into leaf
[Per Tyrssons Dttrar i Vnge]
[Lyrics: Tradititional: Swedish Version]
Per Tyrssons dttrar i Vnge.
Kaller var deras skog.
De sovo en smn fr lnge.
Medan skogen han lvas.
Frst vaknad den yngsta,
sa vckte hon upp de andra
Sa satte de sig pa sngestock
sa fltade de varandras lock
Sa togo de pa sina silkesklar
sa gingo de sig at kyrkan
Nar som de kommo pa Vnga lid
dr mtte de tre vallare
"Sg viljen I bli vallareviv
eller viljen I mistra era unga liv?"
"Ej vilja vi blie vallareviv
hellre vi miste vart unga liv."
De hgg deras huvu'n pa bjrkestock,
sa rann dr strax tre kllor opp
Kropparna grovo de ner i dy,
klderna buro de fram till by
Nr som de kommo till Vnga gard
ute fr dom fru Karin star
"Och viljen I kpa silkessrkar,
som nio jungfrur har stickat och virkat?"
"Ls upp edra knyten och lat mig se,
kanhnda jag knner dem alla tre."
Fru Karin sig fr brstet slar
och upp till Per Tyrsson i porten hon gar.
Dethaller tre vallare pa var gard
de haver gjort av med dttrarna var."
Per Tyrsson tar sitt svrd i hand
sa hgg han ihjl de ldsta tva
Den tredje fraga han innan han slog:
"Vad heter er fader och mor?"
"Var fader Per Tyrsson ivnge,
var moder fru Karin i Skrnge."
Per Tyrsson han gar sig at smedjan,
han lt smida sig jrn om midjan
"Vad ska vi nu gra fr syndamen?"
"Vi ska bygga upp en kyrka av kalk och sten!"
"Den kyrkan ska heta Krna."
Kaller var deras skog
"Den ska vi bygga upp sa grna"
Medan skogen han lvasSeems to me we could
Make it all work out
Seems to me by now
You won't consider lies
I really hope
That you've found it all a thrill
You have really shown
Desire for the kill
We're never giving up
They'll never bring us down
No matter what they say about us
We'll be back around
Sometimes in our lives
We all have to bleed
Sometimes giving up
Things we thought we'd need
Internalize your anger
Intensify the pain
Get back all you lost
Take back yesterday
Did you ever think
We could have come this far
Did you ever think you'd
See right through the scars
Can you believe it's out there
It's your will to win
Things we'll keep forever
Let the war begin
We never let it die
We always steal the show
Never ones to wait around
Now the world will know
Sometimes in our lives
We all have the need
Sometimes giving up
All our hopes and dreams
Concentrate your anger
Release all of the pain
Get back all you lost
Take back yesterdayHiding in a weakness something we can never retain
Years of crawl -- decay and despair
Are we a wrong perception something we can never regainrepair
No one to blame, facing me random
Nothing will ever explain, so it reclines
Where was I meant to be
I feel I'm lost in a dream
Long for the day I can be myself
When will I be unleashed
It's not the way it should be
Again and again only to be myself(J. Hall/ D. Tretola)
The key to the door of fate
Is held by your ways of hate
It will hold better ways to live
When you choose to let it give
If the door slams in your face
Your mind slows down its pace
All the anger, all these things
Make it stop all it brings
Take my hand and follow me
Look and I'll show you what I see
Make a wall and stand in my way
It will come out, this is what I say!
If I had the same door as you
Would I lock it as you do?
Do what you do, Say what you say
Would you live or die where you lay?
When the reflection of anger
Shines back in your eyes
You'll see what happened
Blindly say your good-byes!
(2x~chorus)How much more can we take?
With all this weight we'll break.
Your so called god gave us life to grow and breathe.
All we do is destroy to satisfy needs.
We've polluted ourselves, our land, and our skies.
Greed kills our lives.
How much more can we take?
Mother Earth is beaten and she's raped.
An animal's life is sacrificed just because we like the taste.
Anything for human gain.
Anything.
Modern man, lost in lust.
Poisoned seeds, in disgust.
How much more can we take?First dead on this sunny day
Solar rays have taken
mother's life away to transform it
in veils so soft and thin
that overcast our whole earthball thing
Goodbye take your course
Thank you for all your love
Don't wait for your son. Goodbye
Raise now, spread your soft veils wide
and beginn to slide
through all bad brains and through all the blame that rules
In these dangerous fools
Before a new destruction comes
Mother salvation
Stick the needle on your halo in this earth to suck out all our hell!
Don't wait for your son, Goodbye
Take good care on your vacation
think that you slide with me
Fatal holes in all directions
Please don't slip away from here, my dear
We need you in our sphere
Mother salvation
Stick the needle on your halo in this earth to suck out all our hell!
Goodbye take your course
Thank you for all your love
Don't wait for your son
Stick the needle on your halo in this earth to suck out all our hell!
GoodbyeI was born in the house of blues
Propelled by the winds of change
Entertained by the theater of pain
Most of y'all have screamed my name.
I played and paid both the same
In dirty street puddles
I stay forever in trouble
Head like a knuckle
Too big for that belt buckle
My mom skimped it
I got licked and cracked
With folding chairs
And bruised and then pursued
My skin is thick
You can't stop me dude
I am more than incredible
Track record is impeccible
Turn this track up a few decibles.
All I'm really trying to do is live
And stack a few
Ok maybe more than a few decimals
I'm supposed to fall out and lose
But I swear to God I will sustain
My arrogant ass will never change
I'm trying to set the world a-blaze
And make a little spare change so
I can cop that range.
What I'm saying is I survived through madness,
My tactics is brash 'cause I never had shit
I laugh at these so-called artistic bastards Afraid of success maybe 'cause they can't hack it.
I'll take my chances.
Even with them casters next to you
I'll bring and wreck the dudes
I'm disrespectable, my excuse is
That I repped your rules
And plus I really don't expect to lose.
My debut was like a spectacle in your ears
Ya left susceptable so many hits
That I can pick and choose
I'm rocking out like this is Motley Crue
Now your crew will soon be stopping who?
I don't think that you want it
I don't think that you do
Do you?
The same as you ... I paid my dues.We are not in a position to display these lyrics due to licensing restrictions. Sorry for the inconvinience.Delusion.
Lost astray, alone in darkness.
This loveless game of depression.
I still hear voices of you, so bury me alive in this hole that you left for me.
Deny everything, everything.
Shallow reaching out for your forgiveness.
Hopelessly, I cannot see anything.
Now I must take myself.
Now I must take my life.
Now I must rip it back from you.
Now I must take my life.
Now I must take myself.
Now I must rip it back from you.
I've reached the final judgement.
Every thought and every second that you smile,
it makes me choke, it makes me bleed, it was all lies.
Your smile makes me sickVortex of burning leaves dancing around the tables
A faceless man behind a goat-shaped mask,
Reading ancient fables
Stories from millenniums past, stories from our youth
Sombre poems written in blood, unveiling the truth
Seduce me with passion, kill me with desire
Lick the blood of my chest with your two-edged tongue
Let me feel your love, let me feel you from deep inside
Let me suck you dry of blood once more before I die
Drive the stake trough my lifeless heart
Kiss me a last time with your sweet velvet lips
Carve symbols in black deep into my dead skin
With your long filthy nails, reaching deep inside of me
Red wine of virgin blood, from between female legs
Lust wrapped in limbs, tongues drenched in blood
Seduction in dusk, romance in fire
Banquet in the dark, temptation of the vampire
Seduce me with passion, kill me with desire
Lick the blood of my chest with your two-edged tongue
Let me feel your love, let me feel you from deep inside
Let me suck you dry of blood once more before I die
Drive the stake trough my lifeless heart
Kiss me a last time with your sweet velvet lips
Carve symbols in black deep into my dead skin
With your long filthy nails, reaching deep inside of me[l:Thrall m:Gama]
When tears dry
I finally have a sign
That my love for you
Is just a dreamkind
When tears dry
I loose my mind
And memories fall asleep in a dream
And I feel emptiness once again
With deep pain inside
A wicked mind behind her eyes
Her beauty is beyond heaven and hell
And her voice gave me a dark will
Whispering in silence, dancing with desire
You make me feel forever
But it's really killing me
Blood shed from my heart
Like a decorative colour
In your sick gallery of emotions
And I'll say farewell
I'll say farewellDon't give up
Give all that you got
This is your final lap
Open the door
Because you need some more
The stuf that you adore
Crawl as a snake
And never take a break
It's like a piece of cake
Play tha piano
Repair your car
Prepare the meal
Hurry up
It's you last lap
You gonna make it
You gonna take it
You gonna break itWalking a lonely road in the dark
A scent of rain
Under wings of a clouded sky
Is it a losing game
Running after pictures
Slowly slipping away
Trying to take hold of a memory
Do you remember the days when forever
Had only just begun
You reach for the distance
And when you arrive the distance is gone
Already gone
Withered roses in the rear view mirror
Fade away and rain came late
Was it all worth it
When it's all been proven just an illusion
A distant memory for
Tomorrow in the palm of our hands
What's gonna be left but a thorn without roses
Tomorrow in the palm of our hands
We're gonna take hold of a thorn
Of a thorn without a rose
Laid out a hedge of thorns around my heart
Pricking your fingers
Our reasons and soul
Tearing you and me apart
Bed of roses in the rear view mirror
It turns to thorns
To a bed of thorns
I'd never known that dying embers
Would hurt more than the blazing fire we'd lit
Tomorrow in the palm of our hands
What's gonna be left but a thorn without roses
Tomorrow in the palm of our hands
We're gonna take hold of a thorn without a rose
Why do you think that you have lost
There ain't nobody who has not
It ain't right what I feel
I'll been begging on my knees
For the sun to rise again - yeah
Four yours and mine
Another time
Tomorrow in the palm of our hands
What's gonna be left but a thorn without roses
Tomorrow in the palm of our hands
We're gonna take hold of a thorn without a rose
Tomorrow in the palm of our hands
What's gonna be left but a thorn without roses
Tomorrow in the palm of our hands
We're gonna take hold of a thorn without a roseOur life flourished amid a brown Mother Earth
Broke through the rocks, broke through straight towards the sun
Stygian light winks through the clouds
Retched into this heart of mine
Shines onto my life from nothingness
And I ravished the rays of sunshine
Unfinished we participate in the run of life, our inner strife
Hidden inside us the need to end, to end our pain
One with nature, spoiled, without a zest for life
Sparkling bodies embraced by ebony nights
Sometimes all our words are inadequate for the burden of our hearts
Once ashes we will be and still the hunger for a new life
Or a soon coming death
And the dust we will crumble to will be the companion
Of the four winds wailing over our souls
The ashes still the hunger of a new coming death
The dust is the companion of the four winds from our heartsAprendiste a disfrutar
Las caricias de la vida
Sin pararte a pensar
El dolor que podra hacer caer
Queras volar
Sobra augurios de un cielo gris
Queras volar
Caminar no era digno de ti
Queras volar
Y tu sueno se trunco
Se quebraron tus alas de cristal
Siente el viento en tu cara
Y el gran sol a tus espaldas
Crees que no es digno de ti
Hacer el camino a pie como uno ms
Queras volar
Sobra augurios de un cielo gris
Queras volar
Caminar no era digno de ti
Queras volar
Y tu sueno se trunco
Se quebraron tus alas de cristalIncest sodomy sadomasochism and rape
In the Christendom make no mistake
Bigamy buggery bestiality and pain
The whole damn world has gone insane
It's all a question of morality
Who's to go to hell
Reputed guilt repent thy sins
Tell me where this evil begins
Whose to judge these bloody deeds
It's society's heart that always bleeds
Sins, sins of the flesh
Sins, sins of the flesh
Fornication child molestation the consumption of your soul
It's hard to believe men can stoop so low
Torture murder necrophilia sickness of the mind
Outrageous blasphemy against mankind
It's all a question of morality
Who's to go to hell
And whose to judge these bloody deeds
Society's heart that always bleeds
Cold hard facts are sometimes hard to take
Look hard in the mirror and pray it's not too late
No more questioning morality
'Cause we all may go to hell
God will judge these bloody deeds
Damned to hell the devil's fire it feedsEvery night she dreams the same
Haunted by a shadow again and again
Captured and lost in a giant mace
There is no way to flee
She begs not to fall asleep
And she prays to god to set her free
She is so afraid to see
The shadow she fears is me
You think you're living
I know you're dead
I am the madman in your head
Did you not know
You don't live twice
I am the secret behind your eyes
Do you wanna hold on crying
for the rest of your life?
Everyday seems to be the same
Quitting this life stops the dying
There is nothing left to win
After endless nightmares she lies weeping in her bed
A blade in her hand, her nightdress is turning red
Her skin becomes paler in this cold and stormy night
This is the end of all her painful dreams of suicideLike a destruction of the spirit
Like the purification of one's mind's eye
From the greatness of my manifestation
Corroding their feeble will
But no one shall stand before us
'Coz we are the thunder of the black sun
And tons of pestilent magma surround our surreal empire
No one shall defy, no one shall survive
Brand the mournful liberation
We've seen the scorn of life and dream together as one
Creating the truth of my wisdom
Like a destruction of the spirit
For an impending day of joy
That is reaching the veil...
No one shall defy...OhWhoo!
Well I see her walking down the street,
And I think, wow that can't be beat.
I know that there's a lot left I need to learn,
But baby she gives the sun a sunburn!
Whoo!
You may hate her, but I love her!
She makes that other girl look like a brr.
Oh, oh, oh
She's So Hot, Hot, Hot!
Yes She's So Hot, Hot, Hot!
You may disagree but that's cause you're not!
Whoo!
Oh man she's got the perfect form,
When I'm cold, and she comes, I turn warm.
You gotta admit, she's the hottest thing on this planet,
Even hotter than that girl there Janet!
Whoo!
You may despise her, but I'm in love with her!
She makes that girl there look like a guy named Brandon Kerr.
Oh, oh, oh
She's So Hot, Hot, Hot!
Yes She's So Hot, Hot, Hot!
You may disagree but that's only cause you're not!
Whoo!
Let's Go!
(Break)
You may hate her, but I love her!
She makes that other girl look like a brr.
You may despise her, but I'm in love with her!
She makes that girl there look like a guy named Brandon Kerr.
Oh, oh, oh
She's So Hot, Hot, Hot!
Yes She's So Hot, Hot, Hot!
You may disagree but that's only cause you're not!
Oh, oh, oh
She's So Hot, Hot, Hot!
Yes She's So Hot, Hot, Hot!
You may disagree but that's cause you're not!One mind leading
New times written
You're not alone
We're on the way
Cry for
Wings of Revolution
It's all around
Give it away
Oh
A new beginning is on the way
Young blood
Old lies
Disillusions
Hold on! We're on the way
Rise up inside
Keep the new light
Turned on
Give it away
Oh
A new beginning is on the way
Follow through
Don't give up
Take your chance
Make a stand
Go
They will try to put us down but
There's a chance to turn things around
Let's take our confidence back
Never been a time like right now
Honor, freedom, justice, future
It's all about what we deserve
Oh
A new beginning is on the way
Face the sun of a new dayUnder the flesh
Rot my lust for decayed corpses dead bodies exhumed
Their coldness induces me endless defilement,
Re-occurring relapses, perverse with the dead, soon I will kill for myself
Impending suffering, spasms shooting through me nausation
A cannibalistic necrophilia violating the body, putrefied,
Moldering, gorging on the rotted flesh
Cutting off the body's head drinking from its severed necks
As I rip the corpse in half
Human shit for nourishment
Coprophagia, consuming feces of the dying,
As their bowels let loose defecation flows down
My throat excremental injestment
Reflections of things to come, mirored in the dead
One's eyes my fantasy of murder
Incarnated open wounds gushing,
Blood on skin coagulated tortured of the retched,
No one cares of their dead appaling odor wreaking, piles of rotted bodies
The bodies prepared for slaughter, wallowing in your own blood
Grinding of your fingers and toes feeding on your meat
I immerse my sharpened implement into a fresh bleeding gash
Her body used for my sick desires
The blood thirst I can't control
Many more must suffer
Disposal of the dead, the corpse chopped to bits licking up the drivel
The gore enrages me
All I kill a new creation, my work of art bodies torn apart
Liver quivering at my feet
Eyelids cut off to watch your own dismemberment,
Cutting through arteries nerves exposed
Feel the power of painVoces turbando mi mente
me dicen que el tiempo es fugaz
mi vida est
tratando de escapar un da ms
del bien y el mal
Ahora camino por el final
el tiempo me quiere atrapar
mirando atrs
sintiendo de verdad la oscuridad
del bien y el mal
Entre la gente no puedo encontrar
la llama eterna para este mortal
Si miras a mis ojos
vers la llama en el amor
sintiendo poco a poco
poder volar en tu interior
ya nadie ms te podr vencer
creers en tu destino
y en lo que puedas ver
[solo: Rionda]
Ahora camino por el final

creers que puede ser
el bien y el mal
el bien y el mal

Blaze in the house of lord
Their crosses and statues, destroyed to pieces
Priests hanged in trees
Crucifixes shoved up, virgin nuns cunt
Their hypocritical values
Destroyed the human essence
Seeds on unreal "Good"
Shall be destroyed before growth
They tried to wipe it all away
But our power has grown again
Joined forces in war
Against Cristian disease(You can't follow me)
I thought it was strange when all this shot into my mind driving,
it's weird how this enclosed space makes me think so clearly...
so free!
I wish all hours were so relaxing.
Thinking of the next noise... making up the next nosie.
Scream loud, loud, loud, loud.
Static intoxication, sing this lovely violin song.
Beat this bottle on a wall.
Scream, scream, scream.
The baby cries.
Record the nosie.
It all makes sense... we're capable of beauty.
Through sounds which makes one cringe.
The dogs only hear us now.
For the first time tears came to my eyes while I was listening.
Nosie brings so many things... MAKE my tingling skin freeze.
Turn me on, make me laugh, shoot the can, shut the door,
pour your glass, rape scene screams,
car crash bash, black cat splay.
A silent death, a silent scream...
You can't follow me, you sing along to nothing.You were standing in your favourite light
You thought you were hot thought that you were tight
I've seen you and I know your type
I know you'll be at the party tonight
Scenery, that's all you are to me
Scenery, that's all you'll ever be
Dyed blonde hair makeup packed on thick
The way you look could make your mother sick
Gave me that look that I've seen before
Give up babe I find your type a bore
Nothin to say but you said a lot
And in the end that's what you got
You think you're special but I can't agree
Your empty lines don't make it with me
Made the party like I knew you would
Tried to impress me like you thought you could
It's all a game but I know the rules
Girls like you are backstage fools
Took from you all I could take
Your being here is a big mistake
Your empty lines got you a ticket to fly
And I've decided to say goodbyeSparks, the eyes of fire
Flying high in the night
Storms, the arms of evil
It's gonna take your life
You know the bat's crying
Hell bent for the death
Rain, the tears of the devil
Gonna lay you to rest
Rolling a thunder, a curse on that night
We've got your number, no use to hide
You, you've lost your freedom
To the masters of force
Ride on the waves of magic
Dark nights will be your course
Rolling a thunder, a curse on that night
We've got your number, no use to hide
Demon's night, no way out
Demon's night, the angels fight
Demon's night, cries of pain
Demon's night
Demon's night, a night to die
Lights blinding your mind
Like a flash out of hell
Sounds that no one will hear
It's a demon's bell
Look in the face of horror
It's a dangerous night
Scream for your mother's children
You've lost your human right
Rolling a thunder, a curse on that night
We've got your number, no use to hide
Demon's night, no way out
Demon's night, the angels fight
Demon's night, cries of pain
Demon's night
Demon's night, a night to die
Rolling a thunder, a curse on that night
We've got your number, no use to hide
Demon's night, no way out
Demon's night, the angels fight
Demon's night, cries of pain
Demon's night, a night to die[Instrumental]Obtained is now this crystal throne
That once upon a time unfolded before my inner eye
Extinguished equilibrium
While I became immortal
Time itself flows through my veins
As I rise my sword in lust for battle
The battle to feed my raging thirst for blood
As my soul reach the plateau of everlasting wisdom
That laid hidden for milleniums - unknown, unseen
For I am the harbinger of a new age
The age that rise between my outstretched arms
As I lick the blood of your flesh
The age that rise as I inhale your dying breath
While the sun and the moon falls down between my fingers - subconscious
Glassy tunnels reveal upon this wisdom's flame
The flame, a shivering mirror that reflects my osseous face
Bloodred are enlightened my bleak eyes that saw worlds crash
Into to the void, the void an empty abyss you call reality
Apocalypse pass by
As I settle down in the crystal throne to close my eyes
But is this really what I am striving for
An everlasting existence without any challenge
But what's an assignment for a god of the superior raceWhen I see the rage is building
And I know theres nothing stopping
Stopping me from changing into
What it is almost pure
When Im doing what Im doing
I always take it all so I
Continue in this fashion
And continue to be free
Mother never told me to
Respect those that you do not like
Why should I be forced to hurt?
And take the fucking blame
Why are you ignoring me?
Where will I get morals from?
Mother never taught me
And I dont know why
Destroy the one that you love
Crush all memory of them
Appreciate the power that you have and that you wield
Its a game of life, play to learn
Push in down deep inside
Time to create more than you could
Ever want
Only when the world has stopped
Could you be the only one?
Another day another time
That Ive never known
When I see humanity
Taking all of the life from me
I wonder why we bother at all
Unlock the door
Pray its finally over
Game on
Settle down
Powerless to stop
Freedom is the one you seek
Tell me why I you must be free
Listen to this fuckin crap!
This is what you want to be?
Tell me what you really mean
Freedom is the only way to start again
I swear there no reality
Youve taken more then you deserve
But no one is impervious
When I see the rage is building
And I know theres nothing stopping
Stopping me from changing into
What it is almost pure
When Im doing what Im doing
I always take it all so I
Continue in this fashion
And continue to be free
Mother never told me to
Respect those that you do not like
Why should I be forced to hurt?
And take the fucking blame
The world of beauty and of order is disappearing before me
Ive taken lives
In your next life
Eye for an eye
Just like Judas
Eye for an eye
Im surrounded
Burn all the dead
Its what is deep inside
Worship the system
That youre following
Fuck your religion
You follow like sheep
I see the way forward
You see nothing
Time to say fuck it
Im my own man
Destroy the one that you love
Crush all memory of them
Appreciate the power that you have and that you wield
Its a game of life, play to learn
Push in down deep inside
Time to create more than you could
Ever want
Only when the world has stopped
Could you be the only one?
Another day another time
That Ive never known
When I see humanity
Taking all of the life from me
Fuck this stupid shitty worldI'm fading with sunset
I swing in rosy swing
Velvety petals touch my cheeks and I feel
Smooth caress
Claws of flowers enthral my soul
I'm fading with sunset
This rosy spell eclipse poet of heaven
Eventide has come, has come
I impore the eternity in my hollow shell
Would I see the dawn ever again
Who is this maid with wings
This velvety caress of roses
Can burn your frail wings
Peel me out from this spellIntimidate me?
No use, you can't harm me
I have returned for everyone to see
No time for empty threats
Know the new me
Unleash your fear, your hate
Unhurt I will be
Surrounded I am
But lay down your arms and save your hate
Immaterial being
I'm no one you incarcerate
I'm forever free
Unbound by the realm of flesh
You can't kill me
Can't kill what's already dead
I died long ago
Last ship that was passing by
Vanished where the sea meets the sky
You chose not to hear my screams
Turned away, escaped into your dreams
My hands tried to get a grip
To the very end
Saved my last breath for a downward trip
Sank into the ocean
Was chained to the bottom with moral
All my limbs were putrefied
My body's dead, my wraith's alive
So I'm back to intervene
Claim revenge
Blood is to be seen
Nothing to lose
No pain, no infliction
No fear reigns inside my head
You can't kill what's already deadMerciless to the siege - Agents massacred
Protected fortress - Underground militia
Religious sect - Proclaimed messiah
David Koresh
Devoted followers - One man's domain
Fortified compound - Stockpile of weapons
Forced reproduction - Tunnels underneath
Protecting children - From the enemy
Battalion of tanks - Failed negotiations
Stronghold secured
Rounds of ammunition fired
Canisters of C-S gas - Dispersed inhumanely
Interpretations of the seven seas
Book of revelations
Reconstructed skull - Bullet wounds found
In craniums of slain disciples
Masks of bureaucracy - Identities released
Survivors interrogated - Reaccounting the horror
Useless ordeal - Ends in death
Merchants of greed - Fire consumes
Cloaked in sympathetic dismay
Beyond the grasp of the mind
In death the answer lies
Divine inspiration
Ascension towards supremacy
Dreadful endowment
Scriptures recited
Vengeance from martyred souls
Hero of the tribulation
Prepared to sacrifice
Allured by the disguise
Isolated from the world
Bodies lay scattered - Apocalyptic hell
Terrifying scene - Chilling act of suicide
Devoured by raging flames
Leaving a horrified world[music: Nick, Costas lyrics: Nick, Jake]
Liquid sky on the wing of a butterfly
Numbers are running and seconds are numbing
Daisy chain of an infinite combination
Factors are lying for what can be done
You think you have control
You`re nothing but a role
In a theater of distrust
The sun follows the rain
Questions and answers never related to me
To solve this riddle I need the master-key
Coincidence shatters my reality
Who is the puppet player of all these?
[chorus]
Who cares about the colors you see?
Who cares about this fading star?
You read these letters, but who reads you?
Maybe all your life is a simple RANDOM`S MANIFEST!
Slowly I have the chance to understand
The chaos is changing all before my eyes
I cannot comprehend-pure madness is running after me
Random`s Manifest at every sight-the things are changingClawed fingers forcing iron bars, visions of tortured misery.
Semi-human tears of frustrated rage, hunched up in this fuckin' cage.
My emotions are artificially induced. Though no further need to feel.
Now I've fabricated steel limbs, electro-pulses throb within.
Man made monster, morbid science.
Deaf to my feeble protests, I've served my purpose.
In my veins life fluid used to flow. Now drained and replaced.
With sedative substances, to restrain instinctive rage.Garden of delight
Depth of my sight
Garden of delight
Blood of my stare
Eternal desires...
Eternal desires...
Garden of delight
Humilation of my words
Elevation of thoughts
On the pedestal of beauty
Eternal desires...
Eternal desires...
Forgotten millenium
God's negation
Forgotten millenium
God's negation
In my kingdom
The winds
Only announce
The forgotten mysteryYour phone calls send me from heaven to hell
I never thought that such a sweet voice could cause so much harm
Please stop saying that you love me
Don't fuck with me
The golden sun will shine
In my own world tonight
I'll ride a comet through the skies
I'll forget about life for a while
I'm always wrapped up in the world of my own
It's impossible through words to describe

I am a slave to my own reflection.

Hollywood in a soft syringe and I'll forget who I am.
I wanna be your new big nothing, glowing on a silver screen.x3
I'd like to thank the academy.
And all my family and friends.
We'll make another masterpiece.
A monologue and a eulogy.
I couldn't have done this without you.
I couldn't have made it this far without you.
I forget who I am sometimes.
I forget my lines.
I forget who i am sometimes.
I forget my lines.
Hollywood in a soft syringe push it in and make a star out of me.x5mandkind's birth caused destruction
two feelings of love & hate
manipulation is the way to hide the truth
you control your feelings to reach your aims
you check up the thoughts
to press upon your decision
lies on the world
they are crossing the land
and until there is one world
with one lie - one world - one lieFrom the day they were born these brothers
Had sworn to be unified
Through the thick and thin no matter
Lose or win together till they die
Out to conquer the world, destiny unfurled
Before their very eyes
Forever living the dream or so it seemed
Beneath the hidden lies
Look to the left and right
The enemy in sight
They will earn your trust
They will call you brother
They will be your friend
Then turn and trade you for another
In the days of the sun they would kill
As one solid death machine
No one stood in their way, but the price
To be paid yet remained unseen
Then along came the rain bringing
With it the pain and disarray
The colors started to fade turning into
A grey shadow of yesterday
Look to the left and right
Attack by day or night
They will earn your trust
They will call you brother
They will be your friend
Then turn and trade you for another
Lies, corruption, self-Indulgence
Greed, deceit, wolves in the sheep
They will earn your trust
They will call you brother
They will be your friend
Then turn and trade you for anotherIn fear you run
As silence shuts its doors
It came undone
Now the poison gently pours
And you will hear no laughter
Until that serpents feeds
And what you'll sow hereafter
Shall be only bitter seed
Sweet lusts of pain
The venom in thin disguise
Against the grain
Now the silence won't ease the cries
Dark are the pleasures spit forth from fire
Breathing down your neck like razors of desireAs I journeyed through his precious word
I find where Adam fell and lost our souls
As I turned another page, I find his blood shed
For human race, and then I saw my own sin
My condemnation, without him
Then I stood at Calvary's place, and that's where I found
Amazing Grace
I saw you nailed, to a tree
Gave your life freely, for unworthy me
Heaven's angels you did not call, rescued my soul
From Adam's fall
And now I have eternal life,
For his blood has been applied,
He placed it on, the Mercy seat
And now I stand in Him complete
I saw you nailed, to a tree,
Gave your life freely, for unworthy me
Heaven's angels you did not call, rescued my soul
From Adam's fallIn the bunker suppressing fire
Burning heat of hot desire
Ammo box and bullet belt
Automatic weapon how it felt
Assume position and take the mound
Spitting shells, we're victory bound
Barrage of shrapnel, a shower of lead
The taking of the beach head
Metal fatigue so grease the barrel
Evasive action and deadly peril
Fire at will
In for the kill
Kill or be killed
Shoot your machine gun
Machine gun
Spring loaded, trigger happy firing cap
Blow the beach right off of the map
Pull the fire pin, ready to go
Squeeze the trigger and watch it blow
Machine gun
Shoot your machine gun
Take aim and fire
Machine gun
Shoot your machine gun
Powder burned form rapid fire
Magazine did so expire
Discharge recoil when it's spent
Objective achieved withdraw with intent
Now the fortress was taken by force
A warring intercourse
Machine gun
Shoot your machine gun
Machine gun
Shoot your machine gunCan you hear the roar? I sounds like a war
It's feeding time at the zoo
When their stomachs start growlin' the wolves start to howl
For a bite of what's on our menu
As they pick up the scent they grow violent
And they stampede to the feast
No matter where you're at, you're in their habitat
And they're bound to be disturbing your peace
Your last meal left you dissatisfied
Now the zookeepers have arrived
First come, first served, you better get in line
'Cause it's super time
Yeah, it's feeding time at the zoo
If you get too close you'll lose a finger or two
Soothing the savage beast in you
Is the last thing we wanna do
Yeah, it's feeding time at the zoo
All the stories you've heard, every one is true
The time has come for our rendezvous
It's feeding time for me and you
See them sweat as the tables are set
And the frenzy's about to begin
Eagerly they await the chance to swallow the bait
And their patience is wearing thin
When they no longer bare to delay this affair
We serve it up, thick and raw
We only cater our way, thrash fuckin' fillets
A banquet if you're hungry to brawlFear of falling down
Means nothing but a pleasure
Confront the failure
Smashed to reality
Choosen way was wrong
No expectations, it's even worse
Until you've made the choice
Point of no returnThe cynical view that has been taken
Is blowing my mind
I can't seem to piece it all together
I guess it takes time to unwind
To let the dust settle
And let cooler heads prevail
Each and every day I rise
From the ashes I've left behind
To start anew push through
They say it's not meant to be
Well I'm parting the sea
Got to let go
Move on from a tainted past
I'll never know
Fall out from a tainted past
The selfish greedy world we live in
Is making me mad
It's always give me every marble
Then kiss my ass
Each and every day I rise
From the ashes I've left behind
To start anew push through
If you go for the green why
ou'll soon see what I mean
Got to let go
Move on from a tainted past
I'll never know
Fall out from a tainted past
Tainted past
Why should anyone finish last
Tainted past
You needn't be a saint
All you need is lots of cash
Why did it end this way
I'll never understand
Why my world is grey
When you combine heartache
With misery
Sets up a challenge
For destiny
Each and every day I rise
From the ashes I've left behind
To start anew push through T
hey say it's not meant to be
Well I'm parting the sea
Got to let go
Move on from a tainted past
I'll never know F
all out from a tainted past[Music: M.Carlsson / Ablaze My Sorrow]
[Lyrics: D.Linden]
I can't close my eyes
Staring straight into the empty sky
Feeling trapped an overfilled with lies
I can't deny
These lovely thoughts of death has crossed my mind
I can't deny
Death is on my mind
I can't close my eyes
I'm feeling trapped inside a world of lies
I can't see what's real, it's all disguised
I can't deny
These lovely thoughts of death has crossed my mind
I hate this world
I hate this life
I focus on the strength
The strength I'm building up inside
I feel it growing stronger every day
Strong enough to take my life away
I have closed my eyes
My final rest saved me from all those lies
It's over, I'm free from this pain called life
I can't deny
I'm dead, I'm cold, I'm six feet under ground
I can't deny
I'm dead, I'm cold, it ain't no lie
I focus on the strength
The strength I'm building up inside
I feel it growing stronger every day
Strong enough to take my life away
Suicidal!She is gone
Leaves are falling down
The tear maiden will not return
The seal of oblivion is broken
And a pure love's been turned into sin
At the dawn of our living time
Hope may cover all cries
Truth lurks hidden in the shadows
Dreams might be filled with lies
Soon there will be light
Pain remains inside
Suddenly it seemed so clear
All the blindness was taken away
She closed her eyes
And she called out my name
She was never ever seen again
Harvest of Sorrow
Your seed is grown
In a frozen world full of cries
When the ray of life shrinks
Shall cold winter nights begin
She is gone
And I fall from grace
No healing charm covers my wounds
Fooled's the dawn
And so am I
Fooled by life and a bitter doom
To bring you the end of the day
At the dawn of our living time
Hope it soon will pass by
Facing a darkness
I stand alone
Harvest of Sorrow
Your seed is grown
In a frozen world full of cries
When the ray of life shrinks
Shall cold winter nights beginAnchored Awake | Wringing my hands | Weighing
my time | Running down dreams | Buying your life |
Patience is a girl I've been trying to forget about |
Always rearing her ugly head when I am choosing
she's losing | She's the one who stills sits alone |
Comforting smile saves me from making the same
mistake drag it out of me | Take what you've got
make it better | I feel the loss I bear my own cross |
Enjoying the last seconds we have | My unseen
dictator grasps throats with both hands | It brings
about euthanasia | Who hold my fate in their hands |
Not you | EndlessYou've done this to yourself or so, so it seems
You left behind everything
All your friends and all your family
Does it not feel slightly daunting
How you still sleep at night
When you must be able to hear them fight
It's all about you
All about you
All about the way you choose to live
You still put smoke in your lungs, despite not giving enough
You still put smoke in your lungs, despite not giving enough
How did it come to this
Is there any point to this, are you even listening to us
You still left everyone you loved
Crushed, broken, snapped straight in half
You still left everyone you loved
Crushed, broken, snapped straight in half
You made your choice now turn and get out
You made your choice now turn and get out
How do you sleep at night
It's all about you, it's all about you
How do you sleep at night
It's all about you, it's all about you
You still put smoke in your lungs, despite not giving enough
You still put smoke in your lungs, despite not giving enough
You left every one you loved
Crushed
Broken
Snapped straight in halfRise
The madness of a big city where in the evening near
Walls stare crippeled trees
Ghost of the bad
Wearing a silver mask with magnetic scourge
Thrust aside my death in stary night
Twillight comes again
But silenbtly in a dark cave
Ceased mankind would bleed
Awful laughter of gold
Head from heart
Whore who brings forth a dead child
The gods build rage in icy rain
Raging lashing the brows
Before the end comes
Plague purple on the possessed
Green eyes the hunger breaking
Sunken in sober sin
Ringing of the passing bell
Your laughter in the dark
Snow rins through the shirt frozen cold
Blood rins from the eyes
Purple over the black face
Flute of light
Mournful and weird I stand
Hallowing a sleeping child
Bloodstained revenge
Now strike me pain
The wound glows
This pain I cannot stand
As from the cut dwells a star to the night
Strike me death
I`m doneyou sold your soul to a stranger
you confused life with danger
you made the wrong decision
forever being held in derision
from one extrem to another
not a moment left to recover
it will never let you go forever
flowing with the flow
your world revolves around me
your life's gyrating round me
your whole existence's a void
I'm gonna suck you in
I'm gonna spin you round
I'm gonna turn you up
I'm gonna spit you out
once inside you turn faceless
you become part of the vortex
it's like an eternal treadmill
that never comes to a standstill
and it is useless to resist
as the pressure will persist
it will never let you go forever
flowing with the flow
your plans dissolve without me
you lose your dreams inside me
your mind has been destroyed
I'm gonna suck you in
I'm gonna spin you round
I'm gonna turn you up
I'm gonna spit you out
this is the end of your world
everything has been upturned
submit yourself to new rules
get used to a set of new toolsNo gods or masters, where destiny lies
Underworld of Elysium exempt on my demise
Father leaders leech to your mind
In growling hunger repent
Obituary, engraved tombstone
Fiercely branded on the soul
Chorus :
Truth stands as one
Monolith stands alone
Roots in the path of the serpent
Lies a worthless throne
Gross theology twisted inside
Enthroning dark here instead
Stream of consciousness flowing out
Beget all faiths my crying doubt
Chorus
Inside intriges me for your visionÂ¹s veiled
Monolith cracks, light has flown... ha !
Your faith will fail !
Broken faiths - fade away
Twisted war - feeding on itÂ¹s twisted hate
Reach the end of the labyrinth
Where the nightmareÂ¹s sin
Start from this waking dream
Screaming in the wind
Never find eternity
Denied divinity...
The Path of the Serpent !
Never violate paradise
Or walk the darkened trail
Idolatry your misjudgement
Never ending tale
A never ending tale.
SO BE IT !!!Some will say death take breath away
With us it's different way
Way of life is not where we'll go
We'll follow other path
This is where we end
No more hops is left
Weakness fills me now
Creeps into me
Life beneath this sky
Seams a useless ride
In death-car of the God
Won't you make it stop
Let us catch it
Stand by me
Don't be scared to go
Don't be afraid to fly
Our last dream
Of the peace of heart
Made us escape lifecollapse
we fold in difficult fashion, pinions clipped and forgotten
so we grow fray and suffer the cold
like a shiver inside our own reason
your feigned regard a frozen lake
I'll leave you trapped, I hope your winter never ends
replicated errors, we smash against these glaciers of mistakes
replicated errors, and as summers melt we just
find ourselves drowning in the flood
we melt away at the summers heat, stuck between
our own ideas in paralyzed nights we kick and turn in searing waves
like hollow shells, dread echoes inside
reverberate in infinity, reverberate in infinity
replicated errors, we smash against these glaciers of mistakes
replicated errors, and as summers melt we just find ourselves
drowning in the floodLets take this party to the streets
Fill up your cup the rallys free
Its time to ride, to catch the morning light
We guard our colors, support our brothers
Living the life, the way it should be
Its not a riot, without your comrades
And some violence
Lets rock, lets rock
Lets rock and never fucking stop
Lets take it to the streets
This day and age the lack of trust
In civil settings forces us
To band together
To die together
Well show our strength in numbers
At the sight of any trouble
We are shredders, we are forever
Its not a riot, without your comrades
And some violence
Lets rock, lets rock
Lets rock and never fucking stop
Lets take it to the streets
With blood, weve proved ourselves
Worthy of the hype
With force, well spread our will
Our will until we die
Its not a riot, without your comrades
And some violence
Lets rock, lets rock
Lets rock and never fucking stop
Lets take it to the streets
We are shredders
And we are forever[Music: Valnes/Eviga, Lyrics: Eviga]
Es war einmal vor langer Zeit,
eine Wesenschar, zu trumen bereit.
Vor dunklen Burgen schauderte man,
von Feen schien man angetan.
Ein Leichtes war es Schtze zu finden,
weit leichter noch ein Herz in Rinden.
Schmale Pfade luden ein,
nur fort, weit fort von Haus und Heim.
Einst Wasserklnge Farne dachten,
als Mrchen ber Trume wachten.
Als Blten der Wolke Blick entlohnten,
Nebel kaum ein Tal verschonten,
und berall noch Mrchen wohnten.
Als der Grser Grn fr golden galt,
gaben Trume der Wahrheit Wohlgestalt.[Instrumental]Lead to the river
Midsummer, I waved
A ?V? of black swans
On with hope to the grave
All through Red September
With skies fire-paved
I begged you appear
Like a thorn for the holy ones
Cold was my soul
Untold was the pain
I faced when you left me
A rose in the rain
So I swore to the razor
That never, enchained
Would your dark nails of faith
Be pushed through my veins again
Bared on your tomb
I am a prayer for your loneliness
And would you ever soon
Come above unto me?
For once upon a time
From the binds of your lowliness
I could always find
The right slot for your sacred key
Six feet deep is the incision
In my heart, that barless prison
Discolours all with tunnel vision
Sunsetter
Nymphetamine
Sick and weak from my condition
This lust, a vampyric addiction
To her alone in full submission
None better
Nymphetamine
Nymphetamine, nymphetamine
Nymphetamine girl
Nymphetamine, nymphetamine
My nymphetamine girl
Wracked with your charm
I am circled like prey
Back in the forest
Where whispers persuade
More sugar trails
More white lady laid
Than pillars of salt
(Keeping Sodom at night at bay)
Fold to my arms
Hold their mesmeric sway
And dance to the moon
As we did in those golden days
Christening stars
I remember the way
We were needle and spoon
Mislaid in the burning hay
Bared on your tomb
I am a prayer for your loneliness
And would you ever soon
Come above unto me?
For once upon a time
From the binds of your lowliness
I could always find
The right slot for your sacred key
Six feet deep is the incision
In my heart, that barless prison
Discolours all with tunnel vision

Nymphetamine
Sick and weak from my condition
This lust, a vampyric addiction
To her alone in full submission

Organic images
Dissolving earth
Our future children
Stare at us unfixed
From a residence of stars
In their sidereal ships
Ho sailing beyond within
Their eyes
Black in kingdoms of gold
Like the rocks of this desert
Where we wander in circles
Tails up the ass of time
And our vision
Goes backwards
The traces we see
After something
Or even existing
Beyond the prints
All dreams end here
Where our cries began
Resounding to museums
Of a world we believed
Neverending
And we stop
Exhausted
Beginning
Not again
And the panic
Like the light
Of some star
Exploding
Flashing in black holes of not knowing
If we ever made a away out of this mudThis was once a beautiful place, but now it's dead, we killed it long ago.
With dusted eyes and dry mouths we are trying to survive.
We're exposed to the nuclear sun, can't breathe in the sour air and all
water is almost gone, the earth has been dried out. We are the last species
left, our planet laid to waste.
With dusted eyes and dry mouths we are trying to survive.
[Chorus x3]
There is a virus spreading in my veins, it's to late to cure me.
I'm mutating anyway, contaminated, nuclear ray infected.
It's to late, we can't turn the time back.Sometimes I wonder why
They never could, could let me die
Your body is my resting place now
Can't move or speak like before
I'm limited inside your thoughts
And only by your sight I can be sure I exist
Darkness, when you dream at night
Pain, you never know what it is like
Hate, in envy you lost yourself
Inside you, I'm your mirror image
Inside you I can feel your anger
It's just like hell but only colder
Inside you, united with your dark mind
Through your eyes of eager
See you end so many lifes
I wonder why you keep going on
Inside your head I'm your greatest triumph
It's a joy for you knowing that I'm the watcher
Trying to make me like youhow could this be all that was held true now is burned under suns of madness ruins of the beautiful structures graves of the fallen angels the angels that sang your name i am burning my memories they are too painful i am burning my memories for they are killing me like a blackened earth barren and desolate so i find absence in harsh words why can't i rmember it as a moment of trust when the words that redeem strike me with former thoughts i relax my soul fire in the earth and in my heart the relative circles and the intertwined majesty the only way to enlightenment was through pain a birthing ground for disaster when the words that redeem strike me i know it can only be a dream i felt her will to be reborn and daybreak destroyed me wishing away the deeds of the pasts throughout tiimes in the earth maybe an end will erupt from the earth and swallow us all let the eruption take place i want all of it to burn to prove my dedication i will prove myself worthy screaming for closing worlds to burn it was always deep inside now it has diedIn Hundred Days they Sailed
Towards Grandious Battles far Away
With Swords of Coldest Black Steel
Bitter at Heart and with Eager to Kill
Awaiting Blackheim's Last Command
To Strike at Distant Enemyland
They Set their Course by the Northern Stars
A Voyage on the Desolate Darkblue Seas
A Land Appeared n the Horizon Far
They Reached the Shores Colder than their Own
A Whiteout Wasteland unknown to Time
And Nature Arts of Mother Earth
Raise Your Sword by the Sentinel's Battlehorde
Raise Your Sword for Blackheim the Ravenlord
All the Way from the Highest North
They Came to Conquer the Southern Seas
To Spill the Blood of their Enemies
To Set their Lands in Ruins
The RavenlordThe silence breakes the ground
A shadow is riding the horizon
An arcane man arrives to town
Remoresless and condemned
Tasted the snake's poison
Broken every bone
Twelve thousand gunshot wounds
But there's nothing that whiskey can't cure
Ride Through the crossfire
Ride Through the flames, like a predator in the night
The eagles fly into eternal sunset
The heroes die, dying for their pride
Awoken to heavy galloping
I heard the blasting whiplash
Eyes are filled with lust to kill
Beware, he's crying out your name
Now the time has come
When the Iron tears the heart
And the trumpets will ring loudly
As the stars are painted with blood
Blazing fire under the moon
Burning taste of lead
We'll ride forever
Cause' the Iron is stronger than deathWe're sons of blind faith kneeling to false christ
shaded from light, life's too short by the fear
Forbidden knowledge obscured by a terrified faint creator
The serpent the only lantern in life in the lost
Satan-Prometheus
So long in disconnection
Centuries into defiance
The time of the ice now will descend
Enrage this for the one
Satan-Prometheus - Satan-Prometheus
Satan-Prometheus - Satan-Prometheus
See the hordes ascend
Crushing the face of god
See the horns rise
The eternal reign of Satan
We're sons of blind faith kneeling to false christ
shaded from light, life's too short by the fear
Forbidden knowledge obscured by a terrified faint creator
The serpent the only lantern in life in the lostDon't care have faith or mindset
Plunder and pillage yet
Complain whine and cry like a baby
Ain't so tough after all
You claim that u don't believe in nothing
Goddamn that must be exhausting
I know, you know this is getting
Boring. A lil dull. Don't you think
And not to mention hatred. Loath and revulsion
You just throw around. Like it's not
Even there
Embracing dissolution
Is that who
I have become
Over the years?
Aversion to entity and
Life in this world
Broke you up in tears
When the night comes.
When the sunlight dies
That's what it sounds like
When a nihilist cries
So it finally all got
Back to me
A real reactionary. is what
You'd like to be
When the night comes.
When the sunlight dies
That's what it sounds like
When a nihilist criesi am the lord, i am your god.
i am the lord, the almighty god.
i am the way, i am the truth,
i am the life, i am ...
jesus christ
i am the son, i am the father.
i am your god and there is no other.
i am the son, i am the father.
i am your god and there is no other.
salvation is found in no one else,
for their is no other name
by which you must be saved.
i am the way, the truth and the life;
no one comes to the father except through me.
watch out for false prophets
coming to you in sheep's clothing
but inwardly they are ferocious wolves
teaching things they ought not to teach.
i am the lord, i am your god.
i am the Lord, the only god.
i am the truth, i am the life
i am the way, the only way.
you shall have no other gods before me.
i am the son, i am the father.
i am your god and there is no other.
i am the son, i am the father.
i am your god and there is no other.
salvation is found in no one else,
for their is no other name
by which you must be saves.
i am the way, the truth and the life;
no one comes to the father except through me.
see to it that no one takes you captive
through hollow and deceptive philosophy,
which depends on human tradition
and the basic principles of this world
rather than on christ.
i am the way - follow me.
i am the truth - trust me.
i am the life - love me.
i am the one and only god.

As I walk through the corners of Cooley High
I gotta be thankful that I'm still alive
I have a lot of thoughts like who the hell am I
What is the truth and what is a lie?
But I think about my life and everything is okay
I gotta pave the way to a brighter day
Cause it's really plain and simple when it came to me
There's a lot of people just like me (like me)
There's a whole lot just like me (like me)

1964, uhh! Here we go, aiyyo
The child was born it was a beautiful day
It was 1964, the 31st of May
The girl gave birth to a baby boy
He's not a burden, he's a bundle of joy
She was just a young girl in her youth
And her parents tried real hard to hide the truth
Is there a chance for the baby to live?
That is a chance that you gotta give {*2X*}
[Chorus]
[DMC]
It was 9 whole months inside of the womb
Another long month in the hospital room
Facin doom in a tomb cause the kid is alone
But somebody came along and they took the kid home
He came into the world like we all do
But he never ever knew how he came through
Do the best you can do if this happen to you
And understand all the words that I'm rappin to you {*2X*}
[Chorus]

Father is, the mother and the father is..
Yo, the mother and the father is all that he knows
They give him lots of love and you know that it shows
He's livin really well he has all that he needs
He came into the world and he's gonna succeed
It is a blessing to live in the light
If nothing is wrong then something is right
They say that life is a mystery
And I just wanna know my history
Understand that life is good to me
That's the way it is so (let it be)
My life is complete, everything is alright
Life is good to me, I'm in paradise
Understand when I'm rappin, no pain and sorrow
I just want you to know, yo yo {*2X*}
I'm alright ma
I'm alright pa.. na na na

But I don't care what they say
Falling down

Oh chariot, blow up my iron bars
Oh chariot, black wheels will burn the ground
Oh chariot, I hear this magic sound
Falling down

Oh chariot, blow up my iron bars
Oh chariot, black wheels will burn the ground
Oh chariot, I hear this magic sound
Oh chariot, falling down, break the spell

Well, I feel pretty good and I guess that I could get crazy now, baby.
Cause we all got in tune and when the
Dressing room got hazy now, baby.
I know how you want it, child,
Hot, sweet, and tight.
The girls can't stand it when you doin' it right,
When you're up on the stand.
And let me kick out the jams, yes!
Kick out the jams.
I want to kick 'em out!
Yes, I'm startin' to sweat,
You know my shirt's all wet.
What a feelin'.
And the sound that abounds and
Resounds and rebounds off the ceiling.
You gotta have it baby, you can't do without,
When you get the feelin', you got the sound above.
Put that mike in my hand
And let me kick out the jams, yes!
Kick out the jams.
I want to kick 'em out!
So you gotta get it up, you know ya
Can't get enough, miss Mackenzie.
Well, it gets in your brain,
It drives you insane with a frenzy.
The wailing guitars, girl, the crash of the drums,
Makes me want to keep a-rockin' till the morning comes.
Let me be who I am.
And let me kick out the jams, yes!
Kick out the jams.
I done kicked 'em out!Axe-age kstid
Sword-age Sverdtid
Wolf-age Vargtid
I saw the doombringer coming to call
In form of the blind
And the arrow of fraud
Pierced through the skin of the fair
In accents of despair
As he died away
Borne throughout the misty air
The sun turned pale and no one spoke
Vows were sworn that very night
This death will be avenged
I saw the ship burning floating away
As a funeral pyre
To be claimed by the sea
A biting sarcasm rose
Whence the sly one fled
Hence the bondage of blood
Burned throughout the misty air
Ringhorn disappeared and no one spoke
Vows were sworn that very night
This death will be avenged
I saw the darkness descend upon the nine worlds
To enhance the coming of the end
All-Father then stod up and addressed upon the nine worlds
Axe-age, Sword-age, Wolf-age
Northwards and netherwards for nine nights through darkness
And through the vastness of Vid
Towards the ninth realm for nine nights through darkness
Axe-age, Sword-age, Wolf-age
Northwards and netherwards the eight-hooves were pounding
Through mist and pathways of death
Across the burning bridge the eight-hooves were pounding
Axe-age, Sword-age, Wolf-age
I felt the darkness increase upon the nine worlds
The winter tighened its grip
Grim Fimbul rage addressed upon the nine worlds
Axe-age, Sword-age, Wolf-age
I saw the wolf-age coming to call
In form of the blind
And the arrow of fraud
Seeds of destruction were sowed
By the hands of doom
And by daring the meek
Tears thou kept to thouself
To avoid his return
To be wept of out Hel
Shields shall be cloven in vain
For this act of deceit
As the fate has forseen-acaMoney is hate
So love me now
While I'm still unimportant enough to be
I will prove myself
And absence a shadow
I will never be what you don't deserve
'Cause it's better to walk away
It's better to walk away
It's better to walk away
It's better
Follow me and you'll find
Your reflection is not even close to yours' anymore
Images patterned on dreams on your secrets
Poisoning connections as you slide away from gone
'Cause it's better to walk away
It's better to walk away
It's better to walk away
It's better to walk away
From you
We're dirty and hungry and bitter and tired and broke and
bruised and battered so happy
I've been here way too long
Money is hate
So love me now
While I'm still unimportant enough to be
I will prove myself
And absence a shadow
I will never be what you don't deserve
'Cause it's better to walk away
It's better to walk away
It's better to walk away
It's betterPsychosomatic, you're so dramatic
You seem to hang on every word I say
Psychosomatical, you're so fanatical
You crowd my life and you won't go away
You breathe my air, you take my space
You make me hate the human race
Can't fight the feeling, my mind is reeling
Eternal hate that won't go away
A bitter ending to no avail
Cheap exploitation is here to stay
Psychosomatic, you're so dramatic
You seem to hang on every word I say
Psychosomatical, you're so fanatical
You crowd my life and you won't go away
In a world where no one wins
Chemical playground of lust and sin
Swallow the pill, believe the lie
Unknown pleasures, we live to die
In a world where no one wins
Chemical playground of lust and sin
Swallow the pill, believe the lie
Unknown pleasures, we live to die
In a world where no one wins
Chemical playground of lust and sin
Swallow the pill, believe the lie
Unknown pleasures, we live to die
We live to die, we live to die
[Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible](instrumental)Born to live, then to die
Never ask the question why
State control by mindless men
Believe in death, they live to win
State control, your time has come
Mind control, go get a gun
Life control, you'd kill to win
State control, they've won again
Shoot you down again and again
Want to live, your biggest sin
Fight the system, only to die
It's hard to live with hate and lies
Take your mind, programmed to kill
Make you fight against your will
Sadistic men obsessed with death
Shot in the back, lose your breathThe sarcastic demise is calling
For the fragile souls of our times
Sensitive senseless mourning
From the ones who gave up their lives
Revolution for self evolution
Their deaths should attract
the one and only solution
Despising the world by learning
Their dreams set free
while this fertile burning...
Decaying mind fall nation
They were fighting
the world's soul devastation
Aware their last prepare
Farewell letters with fuel stench
in the air
Pain, hate, body and soul
Nothing should ever take control
Burning for the new beginning
The angels had stopped
their inaudible singing...
And when your life is ending here
The alternative is near
Welcome the change
Welcome the change
That will take your fear...
Go now, burn now baby
This is revolution, honey
Go now, burn now baby
Go and kill the nation honey
Cries against the lies
Helpless tries to open their eyes
Rise for a world that dies
Accept the size of it's demise
Trial by fire
The burner's desire
Their suicides live in me
Go, try your self with fire
Live your desire
And kill what breaks in us...Child of a fantasy.
Demon of tyrants.
Soil of atrocities.
Mirror of sin.
Once in a while when the drainedaways dream
Of your speech as an eternal truth,
Noone will notice the venomous scheme,
Blinding inside your existenceless youth.
Instable idol of several's fathers,
Deceptive idyll in unseen ideas,
Fatal without being real, a chimera
Of mania in garments of light.Help me write these words down
I'll write a great song to die to
Cause my days are numbered
And it's certain that I'm gonna drag you
I don't plan on going alone
I need a friend like a typhoid mary
We'll walk with a goose step
With vigor and might that's scary
There I go (down)
And I'm lovin' it
Dig way deep in
Bid farewell to a world I can't live in
I scratched the surface
And found pride was paper thin
I tried evil
I wish it had more of and impact
Cause faith ain't helping
To rid the apes on my back
After me come the floodYou know every world will have its end
And I'm here to prove it all to you
I am who you don't think I am
All wrapped up in my evil plan
I can taste the day
Savor night
Spells beyond you as I watch you crawl
Do you dare to fight evil's might?
I'll be the last one standing in a flash of light
My eyes (my eyes) are filled with curiosity
You think (you think) that you have power over me
In this life (this life) there's no room for you and me
So turn away or face this day with me
(Face the day with me)
With me
(Face the day with me)
You know
Every world will have it's test
Don't blame for what I have become
You know every world will come to end (come to end)
And I'll create your final rest
I can taste the day
Savor night
Scream your dreams as you dare to fight
Dare to fight
My eyes (my eyes) are filled with curiosity
You think (you think) that you have power over me
In this life (this life) there's no room for you and me
So turn away or face this day with me
(Face the day with me)
With me
(Face the day with me)
With me
(Face the day with me)
With me
I can taste the day
Savor night
Scream your dreams as you dare to fight
Dare to fight
My eyes (my eyes) are filled with curiosity
You think (you think) that you have power over me
In this life (this life) there's no room for you and me
So turn away or face this day with me
(Face the day with me)No sign of life did flicker
In floods of tears she cried
"All hope's lost it can't be undone
They're wasted and gone"
"Save me your speeches
I know (They blinded us all)
What you want
You will take it away from me
Take it and I know for sure
The light she once brought in
Is gone forevermore"
Like sorrowful seaguls they sang
"(We're) lost in the deep shades
The misty cloud brought
(A wailing when beauty was gone
Come take a look at the sky)
Monstrous it covered the shore
Fearful into the unknown"
Quietly it crept in new horror
Insanity reigned
And spilled the first blood
When the old king was slain
Nightfall
Quietly crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Quietly crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Immortal land lies down in agony
"How long shall we
Mourn in the dark
the bliss and the beauty
Will not return
Say farewell to sadness and grief
Though long and hard the road may be"
But even in silence I heard the words
"An oath we shall swear
By the name of the one
Until the world's end
It can't be broken"
Just wondering how
I can still hear these voices inside
The doom of the Noldor drew near
The words of a banished king
"I swear revenge"
Filled with anger aflamed our hearts
Full of hate full of pride
We screamed for revenge
Nightfall
Quietly crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Quietly crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Immortal land lies down in agony
"Vala he is that's what you said
Then your oath's been sworn in vain
(But) freely you came and
You freely shall depart
(So) never trust the northern winds
Never turn your back on friends"
"Oh I'm heir of the high lord!"
"You better don't trust him"
The enemy of mine
Isn't he of your kind and
Finally you may follow me
Farewell
He said
Nightfall
Quietly crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Quietly crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Immortal land lies down in agony
Back to where it all beganBabe, if we can solve any problems,
Why do we lose so many tears?
Though I saw you go again, yeah,
When the leading man appears...

Go ahead and keep your American dream
Go ahead and keep it, go ahead and keep it
Go ahead and keep your American dream
Oh!
Can you go the distance, I don't wanna see
Can you make a future, without maturity
I'm doing fine as far as I can see, so go ahead and keep your American dream
I wanna live my life to the fullest, make the most out of being young
And when I'm laying down on my deathbed, I'll be proud of every story told
Go ahead and keep it, go ahead and keep it
Go ahead and keep your American dream
Have you had the same mentality since you were just a kid?
Can you ever face reality growing up so quick?
It's either hard at work, or hardly working at all (At all)
It's either hard at work, or hardly working at all (At all)
I don't wanna purchase what you're selling, please will you accept my written apology
Listen close to the words I say, when I'm old and I'm deaf you'll still be hearing me

Go ahead and keep it, I will never need it
Go ahead and keep it, I will never need it
Go ahead and keep it, I will never need it
Go ahead and keep your American dreamMy achievements seem so humble
While you're making wine from water
While my hand work the cold soil
All you toch turns into gold
And I don't wanna be like you
I don't wanna be like you
It seems like you outrun me every time
I want to be you
Why can't I erase you from my mind
I don't wanna be like you
It seems like you outrun me every time
I want to be you
Why can't I erase you from my mind
All the heroes in the gutter
Finally get their ever after
As they lay their final glance
Upon your ever shining armor
And I don't want to be like you
I don't wanna be like you
It seems like you outrun me every time
I want to be you
Why can't I erase you from my mind
Looking from a distance,
The difference seems so small
Has the grass been greener
On the other side at all?
I don't wanna be like you
It seems like you outrun me every time
I want to be you
Why can't I erase you from my mind
I don't wanna be like you
It seems like you outrun me every time
I want to be you
Why can't I erase you from my mindTorn apart
The moonlit night
The silence
And then no more
Left to die
In another dream
I would shine
It would be mine...
The silent one before me rise
I watch him glow...
So cold and naked...
His eyes are burned away
I stare into the darkness
Where nothing can be seen
Tears fall from my weary eyes
Nothing can be seen
Fading dreams and visions
Purity has its price
The silent one, the Endless...
Staring with empty eyes
Across the room upon the wall
Motionless I hang
Denied my life
In another dream
I would shine
It would be mine...
Torn apart
The moonlit night
The silence
And then no more
Left to die
In another dream
I would shine
It would be mine...
The silent one before me rise
I watch him glow...
So cold and naked...
His eyes are burned away
And one by one
The statues came to life
As if driven by an unseen force
Slowly they moved
With heavy steps through the portal
Toward the great unknown
And then...
No more...The opening of graves an awful sight
Watch morbid villains scream out in fright
The sickening dead nothing but rot
Just corpses of late left and forget
Gutwrench!!
Doom laden victims obey sick demands
Praying to violence devouring the land
A sickening death committing the sin
Of opening their graves again and again
It's Gutwrench!!
Gut wrench!!Death, spirit me away
My anguished soul doth strain
On taut and twisted reins
Yet, insatiate I still remain
Like a proud, unfalled star
That dares thee from afar
To calm my thund'rous heart
Else, rend it's knots apart
So I may never sing
Of jewelled skies o'er my strings
And love, a wanton thing
Can plunge on burnt, black wings
To hang amid the thorns
In scarlet, like velvet worn
About the clouded moon
Who wanes in solitude
I am alone
Thirsting for the dark
That lurks beneath marbled stone
What black witchcraft
Shalt prise thee from thy dreams
And what perverse world-strategy
Will wend it's way with thee from sleep?
"Rouse my disease
And with cadent naked dance I shalt teach
Thee wisdom of darkness
From earth and red sea
Light bearing Samael
Coalesce with me"
Twilight
Through pagan city gates
Bred shadows play like twining snake
By candlelight
Thanateros rites
Death seduced and chaos wakes
Obsession grips, blindragon fever
In throes of scythed orgasm, Eros dies
And Saturn rapes faith's lovelorn Diva
Upon a cyprean altar, stripped bare for sacrifice
Virtue births a demon
Pandora's box, unhinged, sets loose the night
Winged lilith born for want of Eden
Fanning plumes of harlotry
Like pearls before the desert swine
The skies, they darken
And the oceans part
Storm forth indignant Kraken
Reborn Venus as thou art
Feasting at my banquet
Of Saturnalia
I call thee having wrestled
The tides from lonely Diana
"For thee Endymion
I forsake the cerements of this star-flung tomb"
Be-with-us come
Unveil the ancient flame
Throw the cats our enemies
Desire's menstrual strain
Eastern Devil eyes
A cruel erotic plague
The Shekhina is in exile
And the Israelites enslaved to shame
Midnight
Jerusalem
A tenebrous phantasy
Revelates to men
Their celestial walls crumble
When walks the Xul
Born to the scarlet whore in Babylon
The centuries of wait have all but gone
Behold dark beauty stirs to conquer on and on
Now worship everythingThe time has come to rid the earth of all its Christian filth
Exterminating all alive and accepting without guilt
Only through the spilling of blood can the world be cleansed
Rivers of red must run free for us to make amends
Purification day, has come, purification day
Judgments come, reaper's song, murder must now take place
Rejoice in death, final breath, dying God's children must face
Executions taking place for the good of mankind
Knowing that purity is what we plan to find
Showered in the blood of unworthy souls
Salvation by death, as Satan takes his role
Purification day, has come, purification day
Judgments come, reaper's song, murder must now take place
Rejoice in death, final breath, dying God's children must faceI was born to conquer
Pushed by the wind and sea
Permission by the kingdom of Spain
Opened soiled doorways to my liberty
And as we sailed we roamed
We were lost and desperate
Until a loud scream from the crow's nest gave us hope
Burst of joy, reconnaissance
Discovery of an unknown land: America
And I made the first steps
The beginning of a newborn world
I represent the catholic church
Those who preach: "You will not hurt"
And the holy book in one hand
In the other a sword
We have to teach those savages a lesson
Remission of sins
Let's go too, heresy
Straight on to the promised land: America
We came to stay, 1492, was the year it all began
Kill, rape, yes, he wanted 'em all killed and raped.
Barbarian acts to show who's
In command and makes the rules
Irresistable slaughter and indulge in dissipation
And they kept coming with slaves aboard
And he didn't give a damn about them
A hero was born
Solemn is his name within
Solemn in pose
History books offend me
They don't tell
My name is Columbus
I need your scalps
Finally growling and shaking
Get it out, bleed scream
Bleed for me
Scream bleed
Scream for me
Root 'em out, weed 'em out
Eradicate 'em from my land[tame one]
Wait'll niggaz hear that tame and fatal got down and made it straight
From uptown with six sacks and this track that's in the background
Stop stressin from the chest up, we messed up
Off that best stuff that fits up in yo' dutch
Situation like this, you get blown to bits
Fuckin with this brick lyricist, more complex than the pyramids
Here it is, strictly biz like small print
In between them bong hits, we drop the strong shit
Chickenheads say, "who him? " with fucked up timb's
Knotty fro and baggy denims, spendin up the benjamins
In city tenaments, the boom skwadron odd man
Don't give a fuck like rodman ("what are you doing? ")
With no rings like patrick ewing ("what? ")
Still I play hard regardless
Acquitted from the charges throwin darts up at the heartless
Aimin for your brain, tame one, one of the darkest
Brown like the chocolate, poppin your metropolis
Chorus: fatal hussein
Around my way, all they do is shoot dice all day
Escapin secret indictments, gettin nice all day
Don't let em fold ya, outlawz, the getto star soldiers
Give this letter to the president, before this shit is over
(repeat 2x)
[fatal hussein]
When hussein aim, puttin they brains on walls like tame name
Blastin these motherfuckers cause they just can't maintain
Y'all plain jane's gel in the ? well's? county of sing-sing
Me and young noble, got em strung hold em for hostage
Lyrics verbally toxic, spit like doubled edged optics
My shit is milk, wearin silk shirts with chocolates
Y'all broke and can't cop shit, I get, physically fit
On some evil eye ready to die shit
This thug shit, niggaz get beat down and shot up
I saw this one nigga, get stolen on and your soul got up
Stolen car, roll past the bar, toured a lot of city
Gave him an eighth and he cooked his whole product
It's a shame how you cowards change the game for narcotic
You don't get it, don't got it, the love of money get exotic
If you old you get shot at, and can't walk the streets
Without gettin your lil' money hungry soft ass spot
Chorus
[fatal hussein]
We adapt to the system like ? eddie bap? on mission
Get an ounce of izm, two six-packs, and kid listen
Just a dip on the task, my little niggaz on the ave
Do a bid and laugh, come home and cop a half
Hit me with twenty hundred, what you got was fronted
Now run it, I got this fuckin drug spot where I want it
So don't be dissin new, when you ain't got shit to do
Five thousand dollars, charge free, right out municipal
[tame one]
Niggaz get played off to the left like they was southpaws
Toss you to the outlawz, then let them shoot it out
For what you clock for -- got more than you expected
When I inject correct shit, it gets hectic
Fuckin comin up with that next shit, thug niggaz and bugged niggaz
Luce? steel is tight, I'm straight up like midnight
We burn mics on turnpikes, we swervin through the lanes
We throw chains at bitches, it's back to new jeru to get these riches
ChorusI've seen the darkness
Beat down on the world
Demons awaken into the fallen souls
Love crushed by the people's folly
Sometimes I become aware
And I remember,the cold light
My body which becomes taut
The blood which flows out
From their empty eyes
A smile driven my person
And the lady in white moves
Toward me,she's afraid!
She's afraid
But wants to listen to me
I don't want
To come back anymore
Cause I've understood
The reason for this
Will to live
Experienced so many
Disappointments
And suffering in flesh
Recognized in you
A part of me
Together,
This is our only chance
To keep the answers
We've acquired
A curse on humanity
A curse of life
A curse on me
A curse on you
She's afraid.She's afraid of me
Come with me into the darkness
Dive into your subconscious
Together we'll winmulti billion dollar corporate
media feeding us
all the lines
that we want to hear
we were all raised on the belief
that we would make it in this world
there's no reason for us to fear
i don't believe in those fairytales
like the american dream
where everyone wins
in the end
i've worked hard enough
and i've shed my tears
trying so hard but getting nowhere
how long will we go on
living on comfort
and sloth
when
the hungry
die in our streets
how long
will we believe the hype
they feed
fully
endorsed
by heartless greed
awaken sleeping proletariat
who holds the key
to public outcry
and a change in public policy
we must believe that this can happen
if we strive to be
more conscious of effort
to be free
we must build a better life
if our children can surviveKain I'm durst der wut

It suffers
Old and weak
No further argued
There is war at hand
(The system's weak)
Engines running
Then after all I sense the end is starting
These lunatics deny the truth
I know I will not fail
There'll be
War it's now or never
We shall stand together
One by one
This world is sacred
(I'm coming home)
War it's now or never
We shall stand together
One by one
This world is sacred
I'm coming home
Coming HOOOHOOOME!
You're chasing twilight and you know
You will be on your own
On your OOOOHOOOOWN!
The misery's shown
I'll be alone in this hour
I face the unknown
Witness the end
I'm bleeding
I'm fading
Here in my final hour
When long-lost memories return
And a voice keeps calling
"All dead and gone"
It's out of hand
Life is in motion
(I'm wishing, I'm fading)
Time to wake up
Face the truth
I'm sinking I'm drowning
There's no doubting
No regret
(Time to reveal now)
This is no illusion
It is real
Carry on the flame
It's not over now
Watch me I will rise
(Time to reveal now)
I know I will not fail anymore
Bind the one forever
All that really matters
Blessed realm
This world is sacred
(I'm coming home)
War it's now or never
We shall stand together
One by one
This world is sacred
I'm coming home
Yesterday's gone
There's no today nor tomorrow
I'd risk all the land
The ritual failed
There at the gates
I'm left alone in this hour
Driven insane
I am left alone
And now I drown in deepest shadows
While the golden horn is sealed
I'm wishing
I'm fading
And I am part of the machine
No one lives forever
All that really matters
Find the one
This world is sacred
(I'm coming home)
War it's now or never
We shall stand together
One by one
This world is sacred
I'm coming home
(HOOOOOOOOOOME!)Je sais que nous ne sommes jamais seuls
Lorsque j'entends leur voix sereine
Jaillisant des lointaines mers
Et des crimes en nuances qui s'Ã©lÃ¨vent
Les vieilles ames tombÃ©es du ciel
Se rÃ©vÃ¨lent en un torrent Ã©toilÃ¨
Pour peupler les temples vivants
Emplis de lueurs secrÃ¨tes
[English translation:]
I know we are never alone
When I hear their serene voices
Rising from distant seas
And peaks of aerial shadesI shall give the vision of what is meant to be
All you have to know is that I hold the master key
I know your weakness and I can see your pain
You scream deliverance and I will pave the way
I'll set the world on fire
It's your time to retire
Because sooner or later
You're going to meet your maker
I'll give you what I think is best and what I know is right
And those who follow me, I'll give you strength and might
You pledge allegiance and I'll prevent your fall
I am your leader and know I'll rule you all
I'll set the world on fire
It's your time to retire
Because sooner or later
You're going to meet your maker
Your people are dying
Your people are crying out
That you must go down
Down, down, down, you must go down
Lets take them down
Now that it's over and all is said and done
You've turned the sky to black, no sign of the sun
Do you think the free world is going to wish you well
No god can save you now, you're going straight to hell
We've set your world on fire
You are now retired
Because sooner or later
We have to meet our maker
Set the world on fireI wear the scars on my dirty face
Just because of you
I wear the mist in my darkest day
I can feel the tears from the sun
I feel a rush in my veins
I won't crawl, I will breathe
I'm losing faith in you, whatever you might say
I can't stand to lose myself, these days of no trust
I'm losing faith in you, for what you have become
In these days of no trust
days of no trust
I can't ignore, our faith's bleeding fast
Who will work things out?
Provide yourself from these greedy lies
I can touch my anger from within
I feel a rush in my veins,
I won't crawl, I will breathe
I'm losing faith in you, whatever you might say
I can't stand to lose myself, these days of no trust
I'm losing faith in you, for what you have become
In these days of no trust
Forever is so far away
We need to see a brand new day
Endless spinning carries on
The unforgiving will be gone
Into eternity, eternity, eternity
I'm losing faith in you, whatever you might say
I can't stand to lose myself, these days of no trust
I'm losing faith in you, for what you have become
In these days of no trustYeah!
Fifteen years since you walked away
No goodbyes, no apologies
What's a kid supposed to do
When He dies inside
What's a heart supposed to do
When you've bled it dry
I won't let you in!
This is the last time I put my trust in anyone
This is the last time I sit back for you
This is the last time I put my trust in you
Would you even notice if my world was falling apart?
Would you even care if my heart stopped beating, my heart stopped beating?
I chose to make amends to let you back in
But you did what you did once again
I chose love in a moment of death
And this is how you repay me?
Ripping trust away
I will let you rot, waste away
Return to the ground for heaven's sake
And now you will know my misery
Your tongue tells lies
Your eyes deceive
Your touch, poisonous
You're nothing to me
Would you even notice if my world was falling apart?
Would you even care if my heart stopped beating, my heart stopped beating?
Would you even notice? Would you even notice?
Would you even care, would you even care
Would you even notice if my heart stopped beating, my heart stopped?
Would you even notice if my world was falling apart?
Would you even care if my heart stopped beating, my heart stopped beating?Not even for a second when he wake up did he ask
If today was gonna be his last
An average day in the middle of a life
Terminated by a sharp knife
Killing, spilling the liquid blood
As his boyz found him lying face down in the mud
You might say this song is in poor taste
But I must discuss the waste
[Chorus I:]
Of lives of friends that I have lost
Who pays the price, who pays the cost
Can't cry, just anger till the end
It burns inside to lose a friend
Walking thin lines, anything to cop a dime
Labelled habitual, a loser three times
Just fucking' around, knuckles bloody to the bone
Whatever, the future's unknown
Unless you believe in predestination of fate
The letter read termination
It was fucked up I couldn't make out his face
Through the blod, what a fucking waste
[Chorus I]
[Chorus II:]
My friend was there until the end (my friend)
Can never be replaced
The pain that I taste (It's over)
What a fucking waste
[Chorus I]
Cold blooded murder, suicide, another body laid to rest
Untimely demise, homicide, my faith is put to the test
Is there a god, sometimes I just can't believe
My friend who is dead was shot and then robbed
Something quite hard to conceive
People dying everyday there's got to be a better way
The losses blow my mind away, the stain of blood will always stay
Like the memory of a friend who stood with me until the end
The losses blow my mind away, the stain of blood will always stay
[Chorus I]
[Lead]
It's not for me that I grieve, but for the families left berieved
I question whether life is fair, I wonder if I even care
We think we know what life is worth until they lower us beneath
the earth
Mother crying, forever hurt, my face like stone I shavel dirt
[Chorus II]The chaos is forced to make revenge
When it takes what it wants with no regret
And leaves no chance for redemption
To wash away the sins, never forgiven the past mistakes
Never forget the damage done, deeper
The rest have come to stare and that's when you realize
You slowly realize the worst has yet to find you
I will be right behind you, I don't need anything
I don't need anything, with nothing left to save you
I will be right behind you, I don't need anything
I don't need anything at all, the fallen have began to rise again
You follow when no one's a leader
The punishment fits the crime, you give what you get
The betrayal will leave you paralyzed
And fighting to return the favor when so few compromise
And that's when you realize, you slowly realize
You fight it harder as it draws closer, you know it's stronger
And then it's over, the reasons still seem so unclear
Tell me why I'm here fighting this same old fear
And you find it harder as it draws closer
You know it's stronger and then it's overI'm breaking my back,
To hold this all together.
Inside's our place
I think he's hiding himself.
Secretly I'm wishing
His heart would stop,
So mine can start back up again.
Try, and I try, and I try, and I try,
I'm breaking my back for this.
Try, and I try, and I try, and I try,
We're too late for him.
Try, and I try, and I try, and I try,
I'm breaking my back for this.
Try, and I try, and I try, and I try,
We're too late for him.
Who am I?
Who am I?
Who am I?
Who the fuck are you?
Who am I?
Who am I?
Who am I?
Who the fuck are you?
Secretly I'm wishing
His heart would stop,
So mine can start back up again.
Sleep with both of them, Mr. Monroe.
Ignorance will get you nowhere!
Try, and I try, and I try, and I try,
I'm breaking my back for this.
Try, and I try, and I try, and I try,
We're too late for him.
Try, and I try, and I try, and I try,
I'm breaking my back for this.
Try, and I try, and I try, and I try,
We're too late for him.
This is a test,
you'll live with this.
This is a test,
you'll live with this.
Tell me sir,
Whats your secret?
You got more tricks than a fucking magician!
Secretly I'm wishing
His heart would stop,
So mine can start back up again.
Sleep with both of them, Mr. Monroe.
Ignorance will get you nowhere!
Nowhere.
How about this?I touched your graceful body in my darkest fantasies
I told you everything but you never knew how to please
Du, Du gabst mir alles, was mein Herz begehrt
und Du, Du bist die Lust, und Du hast mich nur geqult
I feel your body's skin don't tease me with your eyes
It's like a taste of sin red lips tell only lies
Du, Du gabst mir alles, was mein Herz begehrt
und Du, Du bist die Lust, und Du hast mich nur geqult
It's like a taste of sin, it's like a taste of sin
you're my sinful queen, it's like a taste of sin
Ich sterbe schon, Ich sterbe schon...
It's like a taste of sin
Lying between your legs and you give what I need
One night full of passion and a heart which starts to bleed
Du, Du gabst mir alles, was mein Herz begehrt
und Du, Du bist die Lust, und Du hast mich nur geqult
It's like a taste of sin, it's like a taste of sin
you're my sinful queen, it's like a taste of sin
Ich sterbe schon, Ich sterbe schon...
It's like a taste of sin
It's like a taste of sin, it's like a taste of sin
you're my taste of sin, it's like a taste of sin
Ich sterbe schon, Ich sterbe schon...
It's like a taste of sinImages in the night sky,
casting spells on those who gaze into the night sky,
I see mystique and chaos in the lights,
In the night sky leaving trails that linger across the night sky,
Graceful they seem as they dance along the black
As they dance along the black
Blazing through the stars, shining within the arctic landscapes
Behold this phenomenon's beauty, Arise within the Northern horizon
Discern, I am the lights, they are with me, inhabiting
inside the verve feeling the sense see how they gleam with luminous
rays through the air curtain of light opening slow revealing tales of long ago
forever will the glisten be upon the land not faltering,
Never will the shining fade until the end,
The end of time
Blazing through the stars, shining with the arctic landscapes
Behold this phenomenon's beauty, Arise within the Northern horizon[R. Iorio]

Istina zhivaDead girl
There will never be another one that dreams like you
Dead girl
There will never be another one that screams like you
When death sleeps it dreams of you
Delilah played the dead girl at the freak show
She smiles like a ghost
Like zombies eatin dust in Mexico
Life dries cold beneath the dead soul lights
She asked if it would hurt
I smiled and said no
The lie ran down my chin like embryo
She smiles like a corpse
Like zombies eatin dust in Mexico
Life dries cold beneath the dead soul lights
When death sleeps it dreams of you
Dead girl
There will never be another one to look in your eye
Dead girl
There will never be another one that bleeds like you
I been dryin' in a dead age
Ive been reekin' of the new plague
The sound of the ocean is dead
Its just the echo of the blood in your head
Sister burn the temple
And stand beneath the moon
The sound of the ocean is dead
Its just the echo of the blood in your head
Burning your black flags
Burning your black flags
I been dryin' in a dead age
Ive been reekin' of the new plague
The sound of the ocean is dead
Its just the echo of the blood in your head
Sister burn the temple
And stand beneath the moon
The sound of the ocean is dead
Its just the echo of the blood in your head
Burning your black flags
Burning your black flagsI raise my hand against ye, thief!
For we're accustomed to receive,
Not to give hostages
Hear these words! deeds are overt!
As chaos evolves
In worthless lies
A crucial congress
At sanes banks
Gray Sublime Archon I've been called
Through all these years I bore up
Now may we all stay the course
This day
I raise my hand against it all
I question now, did I fail?
Or retain our dignity
And shelter of this defilement?
As chaos evolves

This daya grail for the quest and the spirit of Europe
a love unrequited and a dream to cling to
a flower yet brutal to perfume the filth
so I can breathe again
a grail for the quest and the spirit of Europe
a love unrequited and a dream to cling to
a rain, cloud white, to wash my eye
so I can cry again
a grail for the quest and the spirit of Europe
a love unrequited and a dream to cling to
a rain, cloud white, to purify the sky
so I can see again
- you will still sleep many hours
(here on the beach)
and one clear morning you will find
your boat tied to another shore -
a grail for the loss and the spirit of Nothing
a love untrue and a dream for waking
a flower so brutal to perfume all this human filth
so I can live again
- do not be afraid
you will never see the last drop fall -People try to put us down
'Cause they think we get around
Things I do look awful c-c-c-cold
I know I'll die before I get old
This is my generation...
It's my generation...
Why don't you all fade away?
And don't try to dig what we all say
I'm not not not trying to cause a big sensation
Talkin' 'bout my g-g-g-generation
This is my generation...
It's my generation...I'm hiding ...
I'm hiding ...
I'm hiding who I really am
I want to tell the truth, but I just can't
We built our bond on honesty
But still I've hidden
This part of me
He understands me like nobody else
With him I can truly be myself
Believe me, I never want to lie
But I lied to him
And I don't know why
But I wish I could go back
To that one moment in time
When I had the chance
The chance to do the right thing
The right thing
What am I so afraid of?
I felt a piece of me die
And it's the part of me that keeps me alive
God give me the strength to tell the truth tonight
I want to set things right
So I'm not ...
Hiding
Don't want to be hiding
Don't want to be
Don't want to be
Hiding, hiding, hiding ....M.R. James, be born, be born

Part One: Spectre v. Rector
The Rector lived in Hampshire
The Spectre was not focussed on
The evil dust in the air.
The Rector locked his doors
An Inspector drives through Hampshire
Has to sleep because of the fog
And thinks of his new director.
Meanwhile the Spectre possesses Rector
Spectre blows him against the wall
SaysAmong the Celts lived a priesthood in ancient times
When the Romans practised justice with despite.
The people asked its riddling members for their advice
And for their imagination of life.
Enter the depths of history
And follow the traces of the druids;
Listen to the speech of mystery
And let the wind tell the truth.
Secrecy prepared their way into the promised land
Spiritual meetings were denied.
Conspiracy of sacred Christ's concluded soon their end
Dismemberment of others deify...
Wizardry and mystic rites
Assemble on this ground
Forgotten magics come to life
Forbidden fear is found.
The message of the druids
Is the sign for us to see:
Eternity has formed a life
That rests in our belief.
Mythology sealed the fate of these former priests
Reality taught us to forget.
But, tell me why wants my thoughts me to search for more
Why is my mind filled with regret?
Secluded life - Where do you rest,
I pray for your arise.
Dismal oath, descant your death
And ban the pagan rites...
Deviltry can't stop my way into the promised land
Historical places I will reach.
Witchery won't break my aim to end this ignorance
Eternal tribute I receive.
Wizardry and mystic rites
Assemble on this ground
Forgotten magics come to life
Forbidden fear is found.
The message of the druids
Is the sign for us to see:
Eternity has formed a life
That rests in our belief.
Fragment...
Deep in the past you vouch for the truth.
Possession...
Praising the words of the unbroken spell.
Deny...
Submitting the doubt that grows out of the visions.
Curse God...
Deceive the apostles' yell.
Hear the speech of mystery,
Burning down to history.
Obey,
Prepare for their return
Don't break the oath.
Not a lie,
Not a sin
It's the birth of origin
Destiny will rape the pride
Testify your pride.
Testify your pride.once so alive - never again
blinded eyes seek the way
primal
I'm coming down - coming down fast
once so alive - never againWill I die or survive
From this hell made of ice?
It's up to this mountain to decide
What will happen to my life
The more I climb
The freezing ice
Intensifies
And paralyze me
A dreadful avalanche
Behind me
Enslaved to this mountain
I shall be
Amputate my Chilblains
Handless arm remains
My frozen body
I behold
Slowly turning
Stiff and cold
Smell the sweet stench
In wind's blow
Of lost carcasses
In the snowA serious man
In need of a definitive job
He had drunk too much

Go round, have a grouse
Put your claim into Tempo House
Hooray, hooray
Hooray, hoorayDe los pagos del tiempo me he llegao,
y a los pagos del tiempo he de seguir.
Rejuntando majadas de vergenzas cansadas,
pa' brindar el resuello de un sentir.
Y en los campos de nadie pastorear,
la gauchada que sola se ha quedao.
Y en los postes del hambre
vi cortar el alambre,
p que nadie se sienta acorralao.
Puede ser que me aguante hasta llegar,
este flete de sueos que he montao.
Pa' llevar despacito
sin perradas ni gritos,
mis vergenzas cansadas.
O en la cruz de un camino
habr de hallarme el destino
masticndome el alma
Masticndome el alma
Masticndome el alma
De los pagos del tiempo me he llegado
y a los pagos del tiempo he de seguir.
Nunca digan que es nunca,
la esperanza se trunca
cuando el hombre se arruga al sufrir.
Si lastima la nada de no ser,
y el sentir nunca es nada pa' saber.
Si la duda se agranda,
la conciencia se ablanda
y el vivir es distancia.
O en la cruz de un camino,
habr de hallarme el destino
masticndome el alma,
masticndome el alma,
masticndome el alma.Sin, sinful, as a sinner I am

Lyrics: Hirsch November '93
I will see hope as a loved one you seek
I will see ice made of tears on your cheek
I will see darkness trapped beneath the sky
I will see melancholy as you cry
I will hear wolves howl in the night
I will hear beasts wail in fright
I will hear elegies hurting the ear
I will hear men whisper "Winter is here"
I will feel cold as I walk through the mist
I will feel pain in my frost-bitten fist
I will feel sorrow as snow-covered I lie
I will feel comfort as with you I fly
Frozen lands...
Frozen wastes...Destiny hands of injustice delivered
[Pre Chorus]
What has been received is not always as it seems
Standing and alone the light fades as he leaves
[Chorus]
Saviour be known
Say a prayer to keep us safe
Your words will prevail and set us free
Father of time the sands are drifting
Through your hands like water
Guardian
Draining life controlled by a life of deception
He has seen the visions that guide us to wisdom
[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Solo]
Life's embraced denied is the moment of dying
Time is now relinquish your thoughts
and your demons
[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Bridge 1]
He's alive - standing right before you
He'll show you a paradise
Time to change your ways
[Bridge 2]
There's a life you left behind
Just a reminiscence of mankind
There's a life you left behind
and now it's gone
In time I'll change my wayTake comfort in the cadence of the bond we share
A visionary born and raised to see with an unbiased sense of sight
We pause just for a second to properly embrace the radiance
We are the anointed dipped in filth
Taught to cower in fear of being identified
But tragedy will find us
I'm held captive by my spoiled soul
I won't allow it to affect my stride
The procession will proceed as we're gifted with our own idea of peace
So find yourself in me
I promise I will keep you as we harvest the passion that remains
Make my skin your sanctuary
I make a pact with the earth to draw life from the living
Make my skin your sanctuary
Leap to the beat of my blood
So place your hand in mine, drag your feet across the tops of trees
Breathe easy knowing that the branches will support you
And the weight of your complication
In the midst of the ruin that surrounds us
We communicate but only in tongues
Our lips will welcome the caress of the crucifixion
And we stain the wood with defeat
I am not a mortal, I am a metaphor for moving forwardOn and on this is my way
I've made up my mind
But will I find what I search for
Soon I will reach the western shore
Far behind in the distance
Lie the fires of doom
There's a voice deep inside me
"The tower knows who you are"
The road goes on and on
Tomorrow I'll be gone
The road goes on and on
Tomorrow I'll be gone
I hear him say "We'll seize the day"
Too many roads we've travelled on
We'll seize the day
Now there's one thing left to lose
We'll seize the day
Until the end we'll carry on
We'll seize the day
Now there's one thing left to lose
We'll seize the day
All along this is my way
I've better move on
Pure in heart and fair-minded
For strength and truth I keep on
Keep the one that is passed on
And leave the others behind
All alone and without me
I hear him say "We'll seize the day"
Too many roads we've travelled on
We'll seize the day
Now there's one thing left to lose
We'll seize the day
Until the end we'll carry on
We'll seize the day
Now there's one thing left to lose
We'll seize the day
So stay with me we'll carry on
See the winding road goes onWe fall asleep on the runway underneath the neon crucifix.
Where they left the light on for us tonight.
Fed myself to the sickness and purge myself to the cure.
We watch the nurses pace the cage.
You and I, we're never gonna die.
Never gonna die in the white lights.
You and I are never gonna die.
Servants suffocate the king.
We've come to take what we don't need.
And build a prison where cathedrals used to be.
We burn every office, Zombies prowl through the school chanting,
"this is ours to love and take apart at will"
Here we are right now.
These wires there woven webs, conceal the blueprints from me.
Here we are right now.
Sometimes we kill the lights.I lie screaming
Remembrance of the past
Emotions betray me below
Adversity - My martyrdom
Rancid breakdown bethothed
Memories of passion overwhelming me
Corrupted love is displaced
The insect onset, death does not liberate
Deadfall, her final embrace
Forced to watch her decompose
Putrefy, it fills my nose
Tears in anguish I grieve
Smell the scent upon her shoulder
Festering, begins to moulder
Maggots are conceived
My delusions now torment me
Agonising the misery
At this point of death we do not part
Visualise my partner's corpse
I have but love and no remorse
In the final death-throes of my heart
Look her in the eye
Repulsive way to thrive
Death's spawn I feed
Choking on the fumes
In this heat infested room
My heart it bleeds
Lying trapped, my mind is free
Hallucination, fantasies
Relieve the life from when we met
Now I'm in her death's restrain
Horrific visions through my brain
Her rigor mortis starts to set
Memories of passion overwhelming me
Corrupted love is displaced
The insect onset, death does not liberate
Deadfall, her final embrace
With her corruption I'm paralysed
Optic fluids pour from the eyes
Foul stench of decay makes me retch
Sweetly smiling from her jaws
Death opens wide it's sharpened claws
This death's erotic, how I letch
I thank god I'm an atheist
Prolong my anguish - subtract bliss
And as she rots
This nightmare never stops
I long for peace
In the end
Death is my lonely friend
I crave release
I lie screaming
Smothering in love
Now at the Reaper's call
A life that's seen
Adoration
Trapped in her deadfall
Memories of passion overwhelming me
Corrupted love is displaced
The insect onset, death does not liberate
Deadfall, her final embraceI can't stand anymore
I can't see anything at all
Only feel wind blowing
I can't think anymore
I think no one can help my soul
There is no god, no way out
When I cried throughout the time
The man like a warrior came close to me and screamed
The time has come
It's time to wake your soul up again
Just trust me
Release your chained hands all of you
We'll never die
Even if your soul is still crying
Tomorrow'll come
Pick up your rusty sword again
The man continued screaming
He said to me "Take the flag again"
What was the flag, just a cloth?
I asked him, then he said "Remember what you've fought against"
There is god, there's only one way
Finally I realized
A cloth was not just a cloth
So I raise my flag proudly
The time has come
It's time to wake your soul up again
Just trust me
Release your chained hands all of you
We'll never die
Even if your soul is still crying
Tomorrow'll come
Pick up your rusty sword again
The time has come
It's time to wake your soul up again
Just trust me
Release your chained hands all of you
We'll never die
Even if your soul is still crying
Tomorrow'll come
Pick up your rusty sword againGo
I'm still there
I'm still there
So you think you're familiar with me
Well, I passed long before you
Looked in these eyes
Went on, vanished, left this temple young
On a crowded bedside
Piercing voices, high screams
Through a stained yellow wall
Long before you spoke words to me
I departed on perpetual nightfall
I'm still there, pure trauma
Frame by frame, pure trauma
I'm still there
Reach right through me
And I know you question my unsteady motion
Wanted to lay myself to rest long ago
But my life sings on, on
Thinking it would blow into a petty dust of gathering
Nothing but visions flourish
Through the hallways of my mind
Holding, haunting
I'm still there, pure trauma
Frame by frame pure trauma
I'm still there
Pure trauma
I'm still there, pure trauma
Frame by frame, pure trauma
I'm still there
I'm still there, pure trauma
I'm still there
I'm still there, pure trauma

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhahhhhha
A year from now where will I be when I get blasted
I picture myself in a crime house filled with roses on my casket
All my family and friends at my funeral wipin their tears away
Mama screamin wake up I'm just restin till another day she falls away
My kids are so confused cause their daddies gone left alone
Singin it's so hard to say good-bye at the funeral home what's goin on
4 nights and a rainy day to the cemetery found I'd be home
Come close to a call for mama she sees her baby buried
All she's carried
But I'm askin the lord is it ment for me to die this way
Will I live will your words see a brighter day
Crutch love for the haters for were the infrared
And everybody prays for the ride away is it time to pay
Visualize me gunned down mama told me to pass and run from the clan
Didnt know then what I know now
Chorus: just another one dead and gone (4 times)
Lights flashin guns blastin nigger assassin
You askin how long I'm lastin when a nigger be blasted
Negro means of a negro
Its 187 I know sometimes those nigs know
Its all about drama
Save it for my baby mama
Im gonna tell her
When next summer comes I'm gonna be a crack sella
But beat me there goes my fuckin choice and shit
A nigga never be got a chance to put his voice in it
Tell me lies nigga decide what your life is like
You gotta be dealin or sellin some fuckin dope
Just to earn some fucking stripes
She said don't go with the flow
And help your hommie get off his kilo
Cause they have the neighborhood watchin your ass an the tv show
Like americas most wanted well what the fuck they want me for
Except to fight they wars
But I a young nigger with potential
Shootin game and shootin niggas thats all fundamental
Drug house since other drug house persons goin to jail for others
Ounces why he out here free you both seein shit
Still three months and a couple of soultrains to help you think
Now how you gonna get over that shit&..i don't know nigga
Chorus: just another one dead and gone (4 times)
I see image in the sky
Is it me I cant believe my soul would ever die
So please God tell me why
Have I committed murder did I commit a sin
Have I broke any of your laws shall I repent
Is it to late to go wish my family farewell
Before I continue on my journey don't know whether it's heaven or hell
All they have is my picture my beloved memory
They still rejoicein upon the times the way I used to be
Not a pleasant game I played to keep them happy
I knew of castles never just like my pappy
Half this death is commin at me
Hangin up my suits slowly diein
Cause all the wrong that I've done to keep my mama cryin
So much longer and if I could return I'd read the book of revelations
Nigger what I'm facin is a no win situation
I guess this world will come to, lord
So let my parents know for them I shed no tears
What hurts the most is when a brother falls
I could see my mama ballin up and family and friends sayin kill em all
Tell biggy smalls there ain't no reason for this homicide
Money women and pride took another brother for his life
If you really want to fight put the straps down
Stand firm go toe to toe see who survives in this last round
Last down so walk away looks like you lost
For the ones who boast
Whats the outcome of this roller coast
Drive by and retaliation glock infrared
We screw up on it by an inch and hit the babies head
The babies dead an instant victim did you shoot to kill
Cause the man was live and gone and the baby still
Mom told me I was a bad ass
But to show my fast tap
Lyin never listenin to the bullshit
But the bullshit could have saved me from the three rounds
Didnt know then what I know now
Attached to my advisements
Aware of all this high-tech shit
I lost my daddy in 92 from a drunk driver
And it seem the only thing it did was made me get higher
My oldest brother away from home with shackles on
In 93 we took the ride and lost payin a ton
Just anotha one dead and gone (repeat)Still I yearn to see chaos and calm in harmony
Arcana that lies beyond the dreams of everblazing skies
And the night fell black upon the ones who yet
Blinded still wander in the mysteries of life
In blood are the murderers hands once again
As I hold you my child for the very last time
Though I'm crushed by grief , there is no other way
"Thou shalt not hesitate, just let it slip away"
I am the Flaming ember
Flood of neverending pain
Rise my Sons now from the flames
Kill! Kill!
Release Hell...
?
Come new life like old once did
Weed out the weak now from our way
Leave their bodies to be eaten
By the Beasts that haunt the night
Before this earth from dusk was drawn
When gods were sleeping, I was born
Son of Chaos and Mother Whore
Tempter strong yet without form
Through your eyes I see this enraptured disharmony
Arcana that is never solved by the one tangled in dreams
And the night fell black upon the ones who yet
Blinded still wander and refuse to see the truth
In blood are the murderers hands once again
As I hold you my child for the very last time
Though I'm crushed by grief there is no other way
Tattoos in my soul displays the Fall of heaven's dome
I am the Flaming ember...Gathered warlords of Hell
The pentagrams fulfilment
Begin the cast of the spell
To lay the curse upon them
Apocalypse glance
So demons possess humanity
Visions of the end are drawing near
Stigmas and dogmas are bleeding black
The infernal rise, congregation of the dark
The horizon brought the night
The pagan moon conspired
Hatred born agaisnt the light
To the appearance of fire
Apocalypse scent
So demons possess humanity
Visions of the end are drawing near
Stigmas and dogmas are bleeding black
The infernal rise, congregation of the dark
Decades filled with terror
A darkest sight, the new blazing era
Holiness petrifiedI don't mean to dwell
But I can't help myself
When I feel the vibe
And taste a memory
Of a time in life
When years seemed to stand still
I close my eyes
And sink within myself
Relive the gift of precious memories
In need of a fix called innocence
When did it begin?
The change to come was undetectable
The open wounds expose the importance of
Our innocence
A high that can never be bought or sold
Symbolic acts, so vivid
Yet at the same time
Were invisible
Savor what you feel and what you see
Things that may not seem important now
But may be tomorrow
Do you remember when
Things seemed so eternal?
Heroes were so real...
Their magic frozen in time
The only way to learn
Is be aware and hold on tight
I close my eyes
And sink within myself
Relive the gift of precious memories
In need of a fix called innocence
When did it begin?
The change to come was undetectable
The open wounds expose the importance of
Our innocence
A high that can never be bought or sold
Symbolic acts, so vivid
Yet at the same time
Were invisibleCan I blame it on you?
I just cant win, I just cant win.
Two years spent wondering through the loneliest of minds, cant seem to find a good excuse this time, for me and for this to fall apart shall I blame it on myself,or this routine that Ive been stuck in?
Ive lost count of how many times Ive tried to get out of this routine But its holding so fucking tight.
I just cant handle another day of this I just cant win, I just cant win.
Get me out alive!
Oh God, I mean it These are violent days
for you and me I just cant handle another day of this routine.
I just cant win, I just cant win.
Get me out alive!
Two years spent wondering through the loneliest of minds Ive found my excuse this time Your words are wearing me
down A constant frown upon my back.
Ive lost count of how many times Ive tried to get out of this routine But its holding so fucking tight.
Ive lost count of how many times Ive tried to get out of this routine But its holding so fucking tight.
Follow the water
Drain the lake and bring it back to me!I'm feeling down, touch me
I'm feeling down, touch me
I'm feeling down, touch me
I'm feeling down, touch me
What kind of God is this? Gave me the hottest bitch
Then took the life from her chest and left a pile of shit
Sloppy with a fork, so Chris gotta feed her
To numb to cum, sometimes she piss while I eat her
I tell her, keep her head up even though I gotta hold it up for her
And she seizure when she try and get up
I know I'm perking her but can't stop what's hurting her
No sleep with her screaming all night, I'm thinking of murking her
Her parents paid for the coffin and left state
After signing the contract, do not resuscitate
Yellin' for mommy I dip in the morphine to calm me
I'm known in town as the creep that's into zombies
I can't get that sound you make out of my head
I can't even figure out what's making it
I can't get that sound you make out of my head
I can't even figure out what's making it
Stare in her eyes to look past horror
Morphine tolerated, I'm out coppin' horse tranq for her
Like I won't have to go through hell again
Her skin is like saran wrap, barely hangin' from her skeleton
With each one of her ribs defined my crib's designed
To keep the light out cause she can't lift the blinds
Drifting behind, I'll be outta friends soon
Nobody visits the guy that keeps the body in his bedroom
She's barely alive and taking life from me
With no appetite but the meningitis is still hungry
Wants to make love
But I had to substitute it with holding hands while we take drugs
I can't get that sound you make out of my head
I can't even figure out what's making it
I can't get that sound you make out of my head
I can't even figure out what's making it
She's cold as a corpse and still holding the source
Up in the air like, one day the cover is yours
Took the IV out her wrist tried to give me a kiss
Before I tasted her lips, she dislocated her hips
Started shaking couldn't feed her no medication
To scared to beat on her chest in fear It'd cave in
Death waved again and each time leaves her
In a coma, for a week, to wake up to more seizures
But this time ain't like the rest I can see right through her chest
And see her heart ain't got no fuckin' beats left
Then a voluptuous ghost falls from a host
Looking like she did in high school then fades when I get close
I can't get that sound you make out of my head
I can't even figure out what's making it
I can't get that sound you make out of my head
I can't even figure out what's making it
I'm feeling down, touch me
I'm feeling down, touch me
I'm feeling down, touch me
I'm feeling down, touch meMany years of fighting
For the cause
Religion separates the law
Loyal man bomb in his hand
Proudly he stands
Sacred plot, innocent shot
Crazy patriots
Terror, this is war
Terror, feel the sword
Terror, here's the score
Terror, this is my war
Many years of chaos

Drawn out war
For centuries

Merited praise
Terror, this is war

Terror, this is my war
I fight for belief
My duty is complete
Raining down
Loyal man bomb in his hand

Terror, terror, terror, terrorThe gun in his hands he starts to run
His head is empty, survival of the fittest
But then the pictures reach his brain
He's breathing quicker as he keeps one bullet for himself
When he was running through red rivers of bloodLie above the stars ,hide all the meaning
We, the other side ,were born against
There is no sense , I choose her healing
God help us on this test-God help
Cars burning my heart is yearning for lust
Among the ruins i...
Stare into the sadness of her eyes
Lie beside me, close those eyes, adore me
I can feel the rats are marching
Down the stairs of life
Compassion and fear.
Martyrs of my land's decline.
Fools running to hide, proclaim their hate,
Among the fire I...Hear me say it's ok there just is no other way
I believe and strongly feel some things just aren't meant to be
All the time in our lives something somewhere draws a line
I believe in time you'll see sometimes some thing are best let be
You may find between the lines lotsa things you missed first time
But that's ok now hear me say we all learn from our mistakes
Yes I'll be all right
Yes I think I'll be all right
I hope I'll be all right
Yes I wish I'll be all right
It's ok
Comed this far it's who we are and what and how that takes us far
So just proceed leave history behind but make sure your hands are clean
Halt for a while now would you try to change things given one more try
Sure I know the level is low but never fail and you'll never know
You may find between the lines...
Yes I'll be all right...
All the time in our lives...
You may find between the lines...
Yes I'll be all right...(written by Gene Simmons), originally performed by KISS
Livin' as you do and I'm watchin' you
And you don't really know a-just what to do
You don't really know
You don't really know
What to do
And I'm standin' here not quite aware
And I'm tryin' baby, tryin' not to stare
Ooh, 'cause everybody else is here
Yes, everybody else is here
Everybody else is here
Watchin' you
Ooh, 'cause everybody else is here
Yes, everybody else is here
Everybody else is here
Watchin' usImages of a world I know not of
Pasted on these old friend walls
As I begin to make my flight
I turn back my life in time
To place where all the thoughts
Were all brand new
And the colors were so bright
When all worlds were possible
What have I seen?
To speaker I said
Is this the dawning of a nation?
What you have done
Has never been known
No world could ever stand against you
Friend is that all you know?
Is that what this has taught?
Even when you know another way
Is the way of death you take?
If you open up your heart
To the truth of all creation
The truth will teach you life
Regeneration
Regeneration
I will try to be know what I was
In a child's imagination's eye
Transforming mind and spirit
Into harmony
In these unfamiliar places
And for the ones
Trapped in their sleep
There is a chance for their revival
The flower that grows
Over our heads
It holds the key to your redemption
The energy that flows
From beneathe the ground
Restores the life in those
Where life can still be found
Now take what you have learned
Open your heart again
Live life a different way
Hope for another day
I stand with you
On the edge of the unknown
Trying to believe what I can't see
My fight is done, I know what I must do
Break down the walls
That I have built all of my lifeI went down one day with you entwined
The hard rains of another April day
Pouring on us strange shades
Unravelling the story of your grace
Wishing we both stayed
I went down one day with you entwined
The hard rains of another April day
Take these tears and make them yours not mine
Lay me down besides you and make me shineLight's fading, night is calling
Covering the worries of day
Wind whispers, leaves are falling
Slowly light fades, comes to shade
Following the path to a silent vale
Whispers of wind call me to stay
Nightfall is weaving its spell
Darkness hides the land within its shell
Twilight lights my way as I flow
Realms beyond imagination I go
Blinded by time
Of the years that have passed by
Left to astray
My mind's own way
Nightfall is weaving its spell
Darkness hides the land within its shell
Twilight lights my way as I flow
Realms beyond imagination I go
Nightfall is weaving its spell
Darkness hides the land within its shell
Twilight lights my way as I flow
Realms beyond imagination I goThe crucifix in flames
The house of God burned down to the ground
A symbolic action of defiance
Brought palace of lies down
Refusal to acknowledge the authority
Of faith of liars
Has cleansed this world somewhat
By purifying lovely fire
Crosstitution
Crosstitution
Crosstitution
Holy writtings, hokus pokus
Magic incense, blood and tears
Impeccable the ways of Heaven
To inflict terror and fear
All are born of woman
And the female is of sin
So we are all drenched soaky wet in sin
When our life begins
And for the rest of our days
To reach his kingdom full of bliss
We seek forgiveness
For something we didn't do
To someone who does not and never has
And never will exist
Crosstitution
Crosstitution
Crosstitution
Cross of lies, no one up high
Gayhood of priests and spartan fiests
Pathetic faith, your wine and bread
All will be well once we're all dead
He might have died for
Somebody's sins but sure not mine
If all you want is to him follow
And die too then I say fine
But don't you baptise one more
Generation in some fuckin' shame
Supported by that damned religion
Of yours I now watch in flames
Crosstitution
Crosstitution
Crosstitution
I will always defy your damn faith
As I've lived I'll die free
You'll never have me crosstitute myself
Or on my fuckin' kneesIf I lose my faith
If I lose my thoughts
In what I believe
If I lose my way
If I find the place
From whence I came
If I sell myself
If I sell my soul
My house my home
If I sell my sky
If I sell the moon
The stars, the sun
We sow emotion
Don't believe in God
I never did
Does God believe in me?
I know He did
If I sell my soul
If I sell my books
And all I read
If I lose my way
If I find a place
Where I belong
If I kneel some more
If I look to God
When will I pray
If I sell my sky
If I sell the moon
The stars, the sun
I've been talking to God
Through emotion we fallOnly one night is missing
But this one will bring the storm that put an end to everything
The sky is still starlit, but if our faith, our desire is forceful enough
The strings of silence, hushed
The strings of silence, smooth
Within a few hours all signs will read storm
Listen!
It is true that there exist individuals
Who are never looking prouder
Warliker then the rising of the storm
Many-voiced the singing rises
The air seems to condense
Filled with electric sparks
Starting to fly, to rotate, to spin
To oscillate in the centre of the magical circle
The voices sound higher
Coil-link circling and narrowing
The light rises faster and faster
(The sound is indescribable)
The voices resemble blowing wind, howling wolves
The silence break hissingly
The storm put on it's strings
The strait looks like a witch's cauldron
Like a hotblooded foaming geyser
The elements are in uproar
Now all signs are stormy
It's insignia are shining dark ablaze
A shining ablaze from a violent encounter of sulphur and lead
Everything is out of breath
Everything is beside itself, storm world!
In the shadow of heavy wings
Sorceresses preserver
In their fluttering clothes resist the beating weather
That almost tear the garments of our bodies
Flashes in the eye
Endless high pulsating coil
Is rising from the cone
A magical and miraculous horn
Of a unicorn whose top gets lost in infinity
Sparks spray, thunders beat, lightnings are inflamed
That the air is filled with the claps of heavy wings
The apocalyptic wildness of the storm
Who's now reigning with a brachial power unleashed despot
The string of the storm!
The storm of hell that never halts there
It drives the ghosts and demons in it's vortex
Everlasting, for the fatal and glorious return of our masterGoat horned god
Wandering free in the woodlands and mystical forests
To thee I owe my manhood
For thine sexuality is untamed ans pure
Satyr-king for centuries worshipped
A legacy born in the bosom of man
Lust beyond love, love beyond lust
Ruler of nymphs I praise thee
The wilderness is yours
O great son of Herme and lovely Dryope
When arcadians gather and sing
The sweet sound of your pipe
Will resound through the night
Beyond wide valleys and streams
Thou make all wood-nymphs run with fright
With thine phallus awe-inspiring
Like Dionysus and Cernunnos
The muses sing in thine glory
I am one of thousand in thy flock
Be my shepherd, guide my cock
Oh universal Pan
Reveal thyself to me, make me madTime to break through the anger
Hunt down the remnants of the everlasting myth
Incinerating hands that touched your graceful face
In their mysterious ways
The scorching scars have left an everlasting visual trace
Now they're blinding and rewinding
Time to break through the anger
Hunt down the remnants of the everlasting myth
Cherish your hunger for resentment and dismay
And then come out to play
Cascading colors meticulously all washed away
Time for choosing not for losing
Defying the fire reviving within
Time to break through
Your walls are soaring high
They are disarranging
The surface on which we build our own lie
Time to break through the anger
Hunt down the remnants of the everlasting myth
Your wish for virtual perfection seems inane
But try and you will evolve
Your paragon possessed your inner self to no avail
No more waiting, no debating
Defying the fire reviving within
Time to break through
Your walls are soaring high
They are disarranging
The surface on which we build our own lie
Don't throw your life away
Remain the same
Watch your back, now feel the heat
You've fooled the world one more time
And now that you've seen with open eyes
All of us are incomplete
It's time to break through
Your walls are soaring high
You can even try to
Break through the perfect state of mind
And now you break through
You'll reach beyond the sky
You should never ever build on the surface made of lies
Time to break through the anger
Hunt down the remnants of the everlasting mythHey!
We got our guitars and drums,
But yet we can't feel our thumbs.
I swear we're gonna screw up,
Right after we throw up.
Oh, we gotta forget 'bout all those faces,
And just play our music.
That way we can just come together,
And rock over!
We knew our day would come,
And now we're gonna be so dumb-and run scared.
Just take this one step at a time,
Rhyme, after rhyme.
Oh, we gotta pretend we're kicking at home,
Or just playing all alone.
That way we can come together,
And rock over!
Whoo!
(Break)
Oh, we gotta forget 'bout all those faces
AND JUST
ROCK OVER!!!!!!!!Master of all moods
Jack of none
Eight wonder of the world
Angelic when I please
Possessed to some
Dreamer in the clouds
Down to earth
At sixes and sevens with
Every heaven and every hell
My god is yet to come
Madness in the flesh
Bohemian
I'm figuring in anarchy
And stability
I'm at rest
Neither troubled nor undone
Rainbows have an end
Dreams come true
So I'll live without your blessing
Head held high
While I grow
To become or become undoneWhy don't you want to talk to me does it feel easier to pass me by
you read my face like I'm a fucking disgrace and you never look me in the eyes
the truth is always easiest to ignore and that's why you walk the other way
but is it really that hard for you to think of something comforting to say
Don't look at me as If I'm different
Don't look at me as If I wasn't there
Don't look at me as If I'm no good
Don't look at me as If you didn't care,as if I wasn't there!
You walk a little faster like you're trying to say that you really haven't got the time
and when I put my hand out for a coin or two you just pretend that you've gone blind
It seems hard for you to show any compassion for me but it wouldn't hurt for you to try
reality can be painfull but tell me have you ever wondered why?
Don't look at me as If I'm different
Don't look at me as If I wasn't there
Don't look at me as If I'm no good
Don't look at me as If you didn't care,as if I wasn't there!
You like to keep a safe distance from me to make sure that we never meet and just in case I might be dangerous you quickly turn and walk across the street
You're so scared of the sight that you see that you decide to never understand
Instead of judging me by the way that I look,accept me for who I am
Instead of judging me by the way that I look,accept me for who I am
Instead of judging me by the way that I look,accept me for who I am
Instead of judging me by the way that I look,accept me for who I am
Don't look at me as If I'm different
Don't look at me as If I wasn't there
Don't look at me as If I'm no good
Don't look at me as If you didn't care,as if I wasn't there!The pyramids tremble, darken the sun, (the) sky tums red
They reached the wall of no return (and the) breeze has stopped
Who wore the crown will never be known, might is broken
For all we'll drown into the sand, what will remain?
Inverted horizons, denied truth and blinded eyes
The Titans arise, the monuments fall, we cannot halt
Wishful pleads at last came true, some always knew
The clouds burn - or is it fire? The gods wince
Human pride and megalomania
The Titans watched it all
The trace led to nowhere
Wrath had to come
As ushers at the gates
To ecstasy and excess
All turn their backs
They won't give us any rest
(The) fires won't redeem, illuminated's the night - the eternal summer
When they came high from the sphere on shrieking wings
Now they're trapped to the ground, to heat and dust
And the eye is glowing aboveSpearhead marching onward
Take my soul sacrificial offering
Your initial strike taken by surprise
Now left alone, condemned by my pride
Drained of all emotion, body now an empty shell
There's nothing left, you've taken all away
Adrenaline flows
Now filled with anger
Just what will be the outcome
Mass confusion, tears my mind
Spearhead, no victory sublime
Another fallen victim, I will not beg to you
Spearhead to which I cannot hold
With clear perception my destiny unfolds
I look to the reflection, fail to recognize what's seen
A figure clothed in hatred, I pray that this cannot be
Faced by this total stranger, aware of your creation
No vision of the former self
Controlled by your instruction
Onward you advance, left in a mindless trance
Hypnotized by you will, desire is now instilled
Now staring face to face, your eyes filled with hate
Held by your contempt, both by weakness and by strength
Adrenaline flows
Now filled with anger
Just what will be the outcome
Mass confusion, tears my mindTwo crayons sat upon a bed,
One was green the other red.
The sheets were blue to set the mood,
The silly crayons name was Fred.
He told her that he was in love,
Outside the window, singing doves
Sewed and pressed on bright blue sky,
And crawling were two lady bugs.
He nudged her with a giggle,
She smiled and scootched in a little.
If she had a hand, he would grasp,
He gave her a purple skittle.
He poked his girl and lent a hug,
As they rolled around ontop a rug.
Two little crayons fell in love,
Two little crayons fell in love.
It was the same for you and me,
Curled and hunched under a tree
The shade blocked the sun so hot,
My hands were in your pocket
I licked my lips I could taste it now,
The love for you left me in awe
Two little kids fell in love,
Two little kids fell in love.
Oh, I fell in love with you.
It wasn't something I was supposed to do,
But I fell in love with you.
The wrappers wrapped them up so tight,
And held them all throughout the night.
Colors mixed to form a new.
Crayons remind me of you.
He poked his girl and lent a hug,
As they rolled around ontop a rug.
Two little crayons fell in love,
Two little crayons fell in love.
Oh, I fell in love with you.
It wasn't something I was supposed to do,
But I fell in love with you.
And now they fall asleep together,
Each one holding each other.
Two little crayons fell in love,
Two little crayons fell in love.I dragged her lifeless body to the deepest seas
Please show me the way out of this fucking hell
You could guide me to heaven with this sorrow
I have fallen into darkness, my so called home
The screams came from the bottom of her lungs, the cries for help.
The regrets are crawling on my back
My eyes are heavy from all I've seen
I can't believe I gave you my heart
Since you threw away the fucking key
I feel the demons crawling inside of me
I'll drag to you to hell so you can feel me everyday
Every step I take is a step closer to my funeral
Can't you feel that I'm rotting away from you?
The screams came from the bottom of his lungs, he cried for help.
The regrets are crawling on my back
My eyes are heavy from all I've seen
I can't believe I gave you my heart
Since you threw away the fucking key
With the sins around your neck I can finally breathe again
You got what you deserved In exile to nothing, nothing but a paradise
A paradise for beings like you
The screams came from the bottom of their lungs, the cries for help.
The regrets are crawling on my back
My eyes are heavy from all I've seen
I can't believe I gave you my heart
Since you threw away the fucking key
The regrets are crawling on my back
My eyes are heavy from all I've seen
I can't believe I gave you my heart
Since you threw away the fucking keyWe that drift across the mind, with the grace of nightmare sickness. Live past three thoughts to the judgement. Sweet lady. I could have hurt.

LAST BREATH OF LIFEToxins in the airways, venom for all to taste. A death grip love for my remote, spewing blood, shit and paste. Help me take my
medicine, so the pain will go away. I'm all fucked up on valium, I can't move my lips to say - The world is so beautiful,
everything's O.K. The world is so beautiful, what the fuck day is it today? It's a green day you dumb fuck!Ya no lo aguanto mas debo salir de aqu
He de hacer otra vida
Deber buscar alguna solucin
El infierno esta aqu
Pero no va a durar apagar sus llamas
No tendran valor para decir que no
He escogido un camino me alejar de t
Es el principio o es el fin
Quizas ahora recueres intentes dar marcha atrs
Pero amigo ya es tarde
Ya me siento libre como un gran halcn
El viento me arrastrar
Me llevar hasta a ella
Por fn ser ma
Se acabaran las ataduras
He escogido un camino me alejar de t
Es el principio o es el fin
Un paso ms hacia la libertad
Hoy no hablar de ta place with no God
I'm tasting my own
sweet blood
I've found the answer
I know what's true
all my life
I've been waiting for You
FOLLOW ME
DIE
FOLLOW ME
COMMIT SUICIDE
FOLLOW ME
DIE
FOLLOW ME
COMMIT SUICIDELilith queen of the darkest night
You give life to monsters in my mind
You sustain necromancers work
And appear like an evil cloud.
Oh black, infernal moon that crosses the sky
Like a dark, shooting star that obscures the light.
Oh black eclipse show me the shadows of distant ghosts
Celestial demons that roam blindly in the night.
We scar our bodies with signs of crossed moons
And then pronounce the magic words of a spell.
You shine for us your black light in the sky
And lead the way for the astral vampires.
Lilith, Satan's wife
Angel of the night
Give to us tonight
Your fairy mother's might.
You blend the heating vapours of bleeding earth
With the cold lymph of our vital sky.
You enfold us with your vampire wings
And take us to the realm of Holy Death.
Lilith, Satan's wife
Angel of the night
Give to us tonight
Your fairy mother's might.The hope turned to frustration
in the first night of the winter
a walk in dark forest
suffocates my own spirit
to break the cries of moon.
calmness turned to restlessness
in the first silence of winter
greedy thoughts and ego minds
are covered with shadows of lies.
The spells turned to curses
in the first storm of winter
lonely thoughts with endless fear
my night starting to fade out.
Calmness turned to restleness
in the first silence of winter
greedy thoughts and ego minds
are covered with shadows of lies.
The last mind was twisted
in the last days of winter
the souls couldn't scream
no they couldn't dream.
The hope turned to frustration
in the first night of the winter
a walk in dark forest
suffocates my own spirit
to break the cries of moon.
Calmness turned to restleness

When road's lonely,
She came to me in the skyline,
Her look was divine
Her black hair
Danced with the wind,
And the cold air
Of autumn
Played with leaves while my soul skinned
Her eyes were my glare
Her sweet voice
Pronounced my name
My soul was a choice
She called me
While her white dress was my blame
She could be my dame
[Chorus]
Grey
Dusk is, over the way
White ghost,
In my heart,
My loving soul was hurt,
Dark hopes beyond my mind.
And so I resigned
All for her cold dream's love
I went there
Each evening
My only care,
Don't see her!
While my heart played in a swing
Falling in despair
Then I dreamed
With her sad death,
And my soul screamed
Harrowing
While she gave me her cold breath,
She kissed me
[Chorus]
But grey
Dusk is, over the way
White ghost,
In my heart, My loving soul was hurt,
Dark hopes beyond my mind.
And so I resigned
All for her cold dream's loveOh you sweet thing
Sirens sing your name
Sailors say that Im to blame
Broken on the waves, O save me
Dance your fingertips
On this sinking ship
Dare the deep black sea
With motets and litanies and casting off precious things,
A lesson
Devil knows how to row
Lash me to the mast, Madame Pompadour
Madame Pompadour
Sirens sing my name,
Nobody else to blame
Lash me to the mast
Madame Pompadour
Madame Pompadour
Sirens sing your name
Theres nobody else to blame
Oh you sexy beast
From the distant east
Ive played all your games
But no words safe enough to save me from perditions flames
Bluebird, hear my prayer
Save me from despair
Bind me to her heart
Scylla and Charybdis wont never keep us apart
A lesson
Swingin low, here we go
Lash me to the mast, Madame Pompadour
Madame Pompadour
Sirens sing my name,
Nobody else to blame
Lash me to the mast
Madame Pompadour
Madame Pompadour
Sirens sing your name
And everybody knows that
Ghostly rain and hurricanes and
Stormy seas may roll
But Im the Captain of my Fate
And Master of my Soul
Seven Spanish ships set sail
Down to the water in a long black veil
But you, my dear Reinette Poisson
Kept me strong enough to get back home
Lash me to the mast, Madame Pompadour
Madame Pompadour
Sirens sing my name,
Nobody else to blame
Lash me to the mast
Madame Pompadour
Madame Pompadour
Sirens sing your name
And then somebody sang
My cherie Rose,
Je taime, jadore
Madame Pompadour
Sirnes chantent votre nom
Je ne serai jamais le mme
My cherie Rose,
Je taime, jadore
Madame Pompadour
Sirnes chantent votre nom
Je ne serai jamais le mmeWho is your god - Is he not mine?
Who is your devil - are we the same?
What makes you worse
What makes me better
Never to trust again - How long have I got?
In this darkened maze
They keep me awake - They scream at night
Screams at night
Who is your master
In this shallow grave
Born to die for a lie
I have no soul - I have no pride
Genocide
Where is justice in this hell?
Where is liberty - I paid the price
My life blood runs dry
Slowly drained from me
Screams at night
...Alone in this shallow grave I die...I cant take anymore of this
My minds made up
I cant get no bliss
Fussing and fighting
I cant stand the lying
Why do you do this
Pushing and pulling
I wish we had never
Had that first kiss
What I dont get are
The things that I cant forget
Your smile most of all
And all the cool things you said
Sake on sunset
With 2 chainz in my head
I never had a chance
Drinking at saddle ranch
Driving your car so fast
You held my hand
But I cant ignore it
The signs are important
You party with every girl
Im not the only one
Better to leave it be
maybe another day
smarter to walk away
Im not every girl
Sex on the rooftop
Overlooking Hollywood
mesmerised
4th of july
getting pulled over by the cops
laughed till we cried
chorus
I cant believe that I fell for it
How could you treat me just like themI'm waiting In my cold cell
When the bell begins to chime
Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
'Cause at five o'clock they take me to the gallows pole
The sands of time for me are running low
Motherfuckers!
Running low
When the priest come's to read me the last rites
I take look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me
Can it be that there's some sort of error
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end not some crazy dream
Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming it's not easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak
Tears they flow but why am I crying after all I'm not afraid of dying
Don't believe that there never is an end
As the guards march me out of the courtyard
Someone calls from a cell:"God be with you"
If there's an god why has he let me die!
As I walk through the drifts before me
And though the end is near I''m not sorry
Catch my soul 'cause it's willing fly away
Mark my words believe my soul lives on
Please don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to seek the truth
When you know that your time is at close hand
Maybe then you begin to understand whyLet me remind you of the cold mountain skies
The time we felt this red hot fire inside
I'd like to picture it again, your pretty face and blazing eyes
In front of these burning skies
So give me a reason
I just need a sign
I think I really love you
I think I'm supposed to fight
Please let us repeat this time
Let's save what we had
I'm afraid to lose my mind with you on my side
I don't know why I'm still here
So give me a reason
I just need a sign
I think I really love you
I think I'm supposed to fight
I need your promise or a kiss
Show me the way out of the abyss
Give me a reason
I think I really love you
I think I'm supposed to fightInside of me are all the feelings
Can you see that's killing me?
You build us in, you burn your bridges
Mocking me as your enemy
Now release me beware the beast
Desire is my way of life
I will follow you
Wherever you go from here
Don't save me
One, I am the one
Watching you sleep with wings
Steps to insanity
One, one is your life
Will make you fall from grace
Into eternity
Please release me from this strain
I've been trapped in a mysterious cell
Things within me still blinds you all
I've had a life of mine
I will follow you
Wherever you go from here
Don't save me
One, I am the one
Watching you sleep with wings
Steps to insanity
One, one is your life
Will make you fall from grace
Into eternity
One, I am the one
Watching you sleep with wings
Steps to insanity
One, one is your life
Will make you fall from grace
Into eternity
One, I am the one
Watching you sleep with wings
Steps to insanity
One, one is your life
Will make you fall from grace
Into eternityRevenge's a dish best served when it s cold
I m a predator, a wolf in the fold
Menace to society, a deranged psychopath
I m the bastard who brings on the blood bath
Taking vengeance out in the street
I m the criminal police can t defeat
Murder, mayhem my claim to fame
Brutal violence dominate my game
I want to destroy you and your kind
By now you know my vengeance is blind
I hate you all, you'll be the sacrifice
Be the victim of my explosive devise
Park it, park it, park it, park that truck
Park it, park it, park it, park that truck
Park that truck
Terrorism, anarchy is all that I crave
I want to see you all rot in your grave
I m the one that you least suspect
A social outcast that gets no respect
By now you know my vengeance is blind
I want to destroy you and your kind
Don t try to cross me, you ll pay the price
Be a victim of my explosive device
[Verse 1]Feeling scared, don't know why
Everyone are staring
I want to get out of here
Dropping out, want to shout
In despair I'm fighting
I'm living in a world filled with fear
It's in my mind, won't go away
Just like an obsession
Who are you my guest
Falling down to the abyss
Feels like I'm dreaming
But this is real, I can't escape
Secrets unknown will be revealed
I thought that all was lost
secrets unknown will be revealed
Looking into another world
Intuition telling me:
Look into the future
My hope is growing strong
Horrorstruck, go away
I can't see the daylight
The time is running away from me
Gonna be, be your friend
If you want to let me
I'm standing by a crossroad
Here I am, take me now
Into your arms I'll fall
I feel secure hiding in you
Secrets unknown will be revealed
Darkness around you
Despair surrounds
The remaining parts of your mind
Pain growing stronger
Can't take it no longer
It's tearing your soul apart
Secrets unknown will be revealed
I thought that all was lost
Secrets unknown will be revealed
I will survive I'm gonna live
Looking into another, another...
Another world[Tundra, Trollhorn / Katla]
Blodet skjler n en gng
Skogens mossor och kala berg
Kom alla hr min sng
Vi tar deras liv n en gng
Se fornatidens eld beskda dess prakt
Dra ihop till dans i uryttjans takt
Kom tm ditt med trollkrigars heder
Gammelfar nu dryckoslaget leder
Sgtandat spjut och kniven s skarp
Kristmn ny falla vi ta deras skalp
Omhndertagen av forna minnens vv

Tills ingen kristen finns kvar
Tills ingen kristen finns kvarCold wind plucks the string of sorrow
in a deep and silent forest
There's no one to caress the wound
of a dying goddess
Imprisoned in ancient stones
in a bittersweet eternity
while the lashing wings of angels
pour grief to the ground
New gods came to the land
presence of a prayer in the distance
as teh memories of a forlorn time
are fading with the sun
Bleeding forever with the Earth
embraced by cold tranquility
die alone in agonyThat time you woke up in the night, you felt cold and you started to tremble
Reborn in me oh merciful life
You deserve a better way
Don't let the universe stomp on you
Fuck!
No chance to run away from this guillotine
"Remember you'll always be unique"
Wasted words whispered in a rainy night,
when haze caressed your face, and your voice moved me to tears
Fight!
Fight for freedom
Fight for your life
Fight with the soul
Defend yourself
I am forsaken, I am impure
Purify my sins, give me a sense of existence,
give me a future, show me the way to follow
That time you woke up in the night, you felt cold and you started to tremble
Reborn in me oh merciful life
Fight!
Fight for freedom
Fight for your life
Fight with the soul
Defend yourself
I am forsaken, I am impure
Purify my sins, give me a sense of existence,
give me a future, show me the way to follow
When you think things are going badly be prepared for the worst,
so be prepared to live the worst time of your life
without the anguish of deathLook into my eyes, tell me your alive
Look into my eyes, can you hear me now?
Can you hear us now?
Speaking the words
That would never cross your mind
Can you hear us now?
Hope you fail, once you bury the bodies
And you can't live without it
I'm in your head, I won't forget
Your love is dead and you got nothing left
Your love is dead and we've all been broken
Sorry to say we're so better off
Sorry to say your wrong
Can you hear us now?
Speaking the words
That would never cross your mind
Can you see us now?
Hope you fail, once you bury the bodies
And you can't live without it
Yet you can't breathe without it
And you cant live without it
Don't talk so much
Your a liar, you don't need to breathe
You said, you said,you said we're done
We see right through you
Can you hear us now?
Speaking the words
That would never cross your mind
Can you see us now?
Hope you fail, once you bury the body
And you can't live without it
And you can't breathe without it
And you can't live without itYou hear me crawling I'm inside of you
See all the cracks appear all over you
And before long, I will turn into you
And you will see you are
We are waiting for the clouds to clear
We are the wind, the shadows that you fear
We are waiting for the sun to appear
Sun to appear
We are the children that got left behind
Never forgotten we are in your mind
We are the ones
The only ones
The ones you can't remember
Now all the others are a memory
A faded dream that never got to be
And if you'll wait, you'll see the back of me
And then you'll see we are
We are waiting for the clouds to clear
We are the wind, the shadows that you fear
We are waiting for the sun to appear
Sun to appear
We are the children that got left behind
Never forgotten we are in your mind
We are the ones
The only ones
The ones you can't remember
We are the children that got left behind
Never forgotten we are in your mind
We are the ones
The only ones
The ones you can't remember
See inside
You will find
You are
See will find
You are
See inside
You will find
You are
See inside
You will find
You are
We are the children that got left behind
Never forgotten we are in your mind
We are the ones
The only ones
The ones you can't remember
We are the children that got left behind
Never forgotten we are in your mind
We are the ones
The only ones
The ones you can't remember
We are the ones

We are, we are, we are the ones
We are the ones
We are the ones
We are, we are, we are the ones
We are the ones
We are the ones
We are, we are, we are the onesI just don't care, don't care anymore
I just don't care anymore and I can't pretend
I haven't been here before and haven't seen the end
I sometimes hope for a cure I'm just lost within
I just don't care anymore, why can't I win
I open my eyes and these lies
They breed and they feed off of me
I try to revive a design
But can't see a need to agree
I'd hide in my mind and rewind
The scene or I'd flee underneath
But time after time I still find
I bleed more for me to succeed
It's hard to care care care if I'm breaking now
Every single thing I swear tries to take me down
It's hard to care care care if I make it out
Every single thought of despair tries to take me down
I'm keeping myself alive to just live like this
And force myself to decide what's my life's purpose
I'm stuck in back of the line and behind the mix
Still trying to find what is mine find where I fit
I open my eyes and these lies
They breed and they feed off of me
I try to revive a design
But can't see a need to agree
I'd hide in my mind and rewind
The scene or I'd flee underneath
But time after time I still find
I bleed more for me to succeed
It's hard to care care care if I'm breaking now
Every single thing I swear tries to take me down
It's hard to care care care if I make it out
Every single thought of despair tries to take me down
All the time it's trying to break me
Every lie is trying to take me
Now I find I'm dying to save me
But down inside I care a little less lately
All the time it's trying to break me
Every lie is trying to take me
Now I find I'm dying to save me
But down inside I care a little less lately
All the time it's trying to break me
Every lie is trying to take me
Now I find I'm dying to save me
But down inside I care a little less lately
All the time it's trying to break me
Every lie is trying to take me
Now I find I'm dying to save me
But down inside I care a little less lately
It's hard to care care care if I'm breaking now
Every single thing I swear tries to take me down
It's hard to care care care if I make it out
Every single thought of despair tries to take me down
All the time it's trying to break me
Every lie is trying to take me

All the time it's trying to break me
Every lie is trying to take me
Now I find I'm dying to save me
But down inside I care a little less lately
But down inside I care a little less latelyKing Kong illusion...destruction! Crumble this place of existence. Let's
bow down to the king of the masculine, the macho redneck lord. Killing
innocent for the revenge of the innocent...turning this country into
shit. Just another rich white game. Bomb the world...Ice for my cramped
hands. This controller is designed poorly and the blood keeps staining my
suit. The plasma screen shows me stutter but technology will prove
everyone wrong. Ego trip headfuck. I've been hired for destruction. The
King Kong of the century has been molded by me. Leading them blindly into
brainwashed blood lands. My world expands with your destruction. I have
to prove my strength. Peer pressure of a nation, selfish action spreads.
Kidding myself. Do I really care or worry about any of this? My
conscious controls me, but deep down I don't think any of this makes me
lose sleep. Once again I prove my confusion. Mordecai flies once again.
Will he ever truly stay gone?Probing... inward
seeking new depths within myself
an odyssey through my subconscious
the deeper I venture the worse it will be
I don't know if I want to see
as I realize my view of society
Their games of power infest the air
lost in your own world, you don't want to know
perpetual decline is breeding despair
I questio myself, how far will it go?
Go??
And life goes on under yellow sun
as time goes by in star-filled space
and ignorant children pace the earth
all revealing in endless mirth
A fragile eco-system
in orbit around the star
imbalance under way
it has come too far
The future is concealed by time
and lurking around the next bend on our way
yes, you speak and yes, you act
but is your reason still intact?
Errors, mistakes
something we make
trust in technology
something we fake
yeah!
Our action past and present
are closing in on us
visions of our future
a world that's choked in dustAll you timeless children
Choking gangsters and flashbacks
Trying to get ahead
What makes you think I can see you
What makes you think I believe you
Dreams 'side my bed
Have you heard the news lately
Were were sad ?
Shot, that's on the pass
All the dreams were flying
All the love was dying
Earth was coming fast
Where do we go from here
Where do we go from here
Where do we go from here
Where do we go from here
All you false pretenders
And you freaky contenders
Trying to be the first
In my own opinion
You are not defending
You, you are the worst
Made the world a circus
And you're trying to curse us
Cruel, he knows no bounds
But we won't let you beat us
No, we won't let you cheat us
It's only one time around
Where do we go from here
Where do we go from here
Where do we go from here
Where do we go from here
Ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha
If you find it amusing
And the world in the music
Take a closer look
If you found permission
In the dreams you're wishing
It's all the time you took
Where do we go from here
Where do we go from here
Where do we go from here
Where do we go from hereIn the midst of the dead earth up through the clouds they rise
Feet sunk in moss heads covered in a veil of white
Kings born and die but fells still watch up proud
Like giants in their grandeur they stand and hold the sky
Shadows grow tall covering the barren earth
The earth that wears only lichen and moss
The sun is setting and the sky dresses in red
for the coming six fullmoons all light will be lost
The daylight goes hiding into infinity
The last shades of red turn slowly to gray
..and then to black
On some nights will the northern lights appear
And send their rays to reflect from the snow
Colouring the lands of fells in all their shades
When they disappear...only darkness remains
(Music: Pasi & Teemu
Words: TeemuWhere do I take this pain of mine?
I run but it stays right by my side
So tear me open and pour me out
There's things inside that scream and shout
And the pain still hates me
So hold me until it sleeps
Just like the curse, just like a stray
You feed it once and now it stays
Now it stays
So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me until I'm clean
It grips you so hold me
It stains you so hold me
It hates you so hold me
It holds you so hold me
Until it sleeps
So tell me why you've chosen me
Don't want your grip
Don't want your greed
Don't want it
I'll tear me open, make you gone
No more can you hurt anyone
And the fear still shakes me
So hold me until it sleeps
It grips you so hold me
It stains you so hold me
It hates you so hold me
It holds you, holds you
Holds you until it sleeps
Until it sleeps
Until it sleeps
Until it sleeps
Until it sleeps
I don't want it
I don't want it, want it, want it
Want it, want it, no
So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me 'til I'm clean
I'll tear thee open, make you gone
No longer will you hurt anyone
And the hate still shapes me
So hold me until it sleeps
Until it sleeps
Until it sleeps
Until it sleeps
Until it sleeps
Until it sleepsOh angel,
When I first saw you I already knew,
There was something inside of you.
Something I thought I'd never find,
Angel of mine.
I look at you (looking at you) looking at me,
Now I know why they say the best things are free.
Gonna love you 'til the end of time,
Angel of mine.
What you mean to me you'll never know
Deep inside I need to show
You came into my life sent from above,
Better than a dream, such a perfect love.
And I'll adore you 'til the end of time,
Angel of mine.
Woah waoh, angel, yeah, oh
Nothing means more to me than what we share,
No one in this whole world can ever compare.
Last night the way you moved is still on my mind,
Angel, angel, of mine.
What you mean to me you'll never know.
Deep inside I need to show,
You came into my life (my life) sent from above.
Better than a dream, such a perfect love, perfect love.
And I'll adore you 'til the end of time
Angel, angel, of mine, of mine
Angel, oh angel, angel.
I never knew I could feel each moment
As if it were new.
Every breath I take or vow that I make
I want to share it with you, share it with you.
When I first saw you I already knew,
There was something inside of you,
Something I thought I'd never find,
Angel of mine.
You came into my life, sent from above, up above baby
Better than a dream, such a perfect love
You're such a perfect love
And I'll adore you 'til the end of time
Angel of mine .
What you mean to me you'll never know.
Deep inside I need to show,
I look at you, looking at me,
Now I know why they say the best things are free.
Gonna love you 'til the end of time
Angel of mine.It's a tragedy, that's coming near
Hatred chains our thoughts, born in fear
Makes our children be martyrs of vanity
Sacrifice in another gods name
We speak of love and mercy
While only bullets answering every thrown stone
We praise our lord in heaven
But all our deeds are by blood and pain
Let's lay down our swords now
And let the blood dry now
It's not our destiny to be enemies
There can be a tomorrow
So let the blood dry now
No war can last forever
Time of killing lasts for so many years
Life lights burn so fast, all that's left are tears
Do you really believe our gods want us to kill?
Not one word of our belief tells this is out lords will
Time runs fast for you and me
But still our souls can be saved by the glory of love
Take the hand that reaches out for you
Let's end the madness before it's too late, too late
[repeat chorus]
[repeat bridge two]
[repeat chorus]God looked down from heaven shook his head and wept
His flock had gone astray wolves mingling with sheep
You tried to save man once by sending down a son
But the bastards nailed him up
And laughed at what they'd done
You gang raped mother nature I love a virgins cry
Blood poured from the earth she suffered and she died
Rusty scissors still in hand you castrated father time
Feed his balls to the hounds that drink his cum like wine
God is dead
You've taken all my precious gifts
I gave unto you life from by breath
You a product of my love
Your gratitude shown in my death
The devil has taken your spirit
Keeps it chained up in the night
Tells you that evil is good
But you will never see the light
Eat his body drink his blood
Then we'll sing our song of love
Now you come crawling on your hands and knees
You beg for forgiveness suck me till I bleed
And for your transgressions heretical blasphemy
The punishment is damnation you'll burn interminably
Look what you've done to nature
And what you've done to time there's no more room in hell
Your sinners you steal what is mine
Now the dead walk the earth
There's nowhere to hide
The devil and his disciples
Rejoice my suicide
Bustin' heads breaking legs
Smashin' faces spreading hate
Screaming out this can't be real
Broken bottles chains and
Knives bats and pipes to end your life
Crush you beneath my wheels
And of course no regret give me freedom or give me death
You're flirting with disaster
Riding wild running free no one's gonna govern meGood evening and welcome to a test of the minds
This match begins as our thoughts begin to grind
I send a pawn towards you, a subtle piece of my attack
Pondering the next move, I guess you'll never know unless you try
It
Knight jumps queen if you know what I mean
Anticipation of the final scene
Knight jumps queen, so get prepared
For this checkmate has been happily declared
As the knight jumps the queen
You have made selections, a white castle crumbles at your feet
To Counter the men in black, your moves must all be elite
A bishop takes a rook and this cuts him down to size
This is no tailor-made situation
I guess I have some real competition for once
Knight jumps queen if you know what I mean
Anticipation of the final scene
Knight jumps queen, so get prepared
For this checkmate has been happily declared
As the knight jumps the queen
Hours and hours to a stalemate, this game has come to a close
Could it end without a climax between to exhausted foes
Night-time's falling on the castle, it's bringing in another day
The concentration was impossible, I never had a doubt I wouldn't
Win it from you
Knight jumps queen if you know what I mean
Anticipation of the final scene
Knight jumps queen, so get prepared
For this checkmate has been happily declared
As the knight jumps the queenAmongst the virulent and multiplying beauties of this southern land
lies a poison legacy for future generations to withstand.
We are curators of all earthly life, united we must speak our minds.
The toxic byproducts of nuclear activities we can't rewind.
Morning iris at sunrise, awakens to another day.
Your new world ever changing, as you bloom, you decay.
Future descendants of this time will never know a life of purity.
For our mistakes made in the era, we have damned them to obscurity.
First we tear down the forests to retrieve that tainted ore,
then we bury the outcome on an ancient ocean floor.
Wilderness of ancient land, torn open by the greed of man.
Vulnerable tribes silently screaming in pain,
the mining of ancestral soils are the deeds of the insane.
Most dangerous substance known to human, dug up and spread all over the
land.
Earth tearing machines, mine sickness from the ground,
now for thousands of years no life will be found.
Once as pristine as creation, now a human induced abomination.Visions escape from your spiritual waste
A conscious decision of your inner soul
Symbols trapped through convulsions
Of my brain
Visualized figures marching in step
Erasing my store
Forget more and more
Unlearning to spell
My own name
I can't believe
I'm calling myself
Within your mind
We are three of a kindTogether as one, with the cracked mirror, reflecting only this unborn unknown,
I've never flet this emptiness, like a cascade of teardrops in blade forms...
Decisions, to choose the arcanum one.
I'm slowly fading into the dreams of the universe,
Do I really feel the tragedy? Where are those grey moments of pleasure,
I'm the dawn, I'm the night, I can create and destroy, I will always be the lonely walker.
Together as one forutne and misery, I'm a warrior full of hate and wisdom, full of pride and sadness.
Soon I'll cross the river of fire, soon I'll face the Final Battle, to revenge all those soulless Lost Years....Voices I hear

courage and discipline, a curvy heroine, am i too blind to see, shapeshifters tricking me
im the mother figure, giving and nurturing

i know just what to expect
my life is a heros quest!
quest!
quest!We're marching on to the rhythm of the dead
We're marching on, our hearts pounding with rage
Break those chains,
Kill your fears
Break that curse,
Burn your soul
Crushed by the light,
Slayed by servants of christ
You were left to die by the ones you trust,
Betrayed by life, left to rot
You were left to die by the ones you trust,
Betrayed by life, becoming dust
We're marching on to the rhythm of hate
We're marching on, still beating, killing your fate
We're marching on to the rhythm of the dead
We're marching on, our hearts pounding with rage
Break those chains,
Kill your fears
Break that curse,
Burn your soul
I don't mind the pain or the suffering, just no more life...
You were left to die by the ones you trust,
Betrayed by life, left to rot[music: cabra 10/98]
[lyrics: dave rotten]
grown into a world
of preconceived ideals
father, mother, sister,
doggy and landscaped cottage
affectionless rearing
his whole family
was like unkown
neighbours to him
he applied to them
by their first names
no signs of respect
towards his own family
[chorus 1]
totally scorned
ill mannered
and restrained
no human values
no self respect
a poor repressed
still at the age of 24
he didn't even drink alcohol
was proud of his virginity
(but) in fact he was just fearful
of being able to fulfil
in front of a naked woman
so he decided to hate girls
to cover his sexual problem
[chorus 2]
he hated friends
he hated his parents
he hated women
he hated humans
it was the only feeling
he felt by his own
hate was his only
self pro-claimed virtue
was the easiest way
to escape from reality
no laughs, no love
no signs of gratitude
[chorus 1]
totally scorned
ill mannered
and restrained
no human values
no self respect
a poor repressed
but in the eyes of his friends
he looked like a normal guy
he even seemed really charming
hiding his real inner feelings
he was a perfect stereotype
of a potential psychopath
a nice person from outside
natural born hater inside
[chorus 2]
he hated friends
he hated his parents
he hated women
he hated humansDeep in the shadows I'm fighting a battle
The creature wants me screaming, screaming
I think I'm losing, tired of choosing, I'm slipping down
I can't stop screaming, screaming
I'm living a lie, there's a creature hiding inside of me
Black as the night with a cold dead heart and a lust for sin
So I shut it out, I bottle up, I hide it from the world
If I let it out I don't know what I'll do
There's a creature inside of you too
I can't just turn to the menace I've clung to
The creature wants me screaming, screaming
I can't determine, I'm sure that it's hell bent on breaking out and
Hearing you screaming, screaming
I'm living a lie, there's a creature hiding inside of me
Black as the night with a cold dead heart and a lust for sin
So I shut it out, I bottle up, I hide it from the world
If I let it out I don't know what I'll do
There's a creature inside of you too
So I shut it out, I bottle up, I hide it from the world
If I let it out I don't know what I'll do
There's a creature inside of you too
I can't hold back.
I can't hold back.
I can't hold back.
So I shut it out, I bottle up, I hide it from you
If I let it out I don't know what I'll do
There's a creature inside of you too
So I shut it out, I bottle up, I hide it from the world
If I let it out I don't know what I'll do
There's a creature inside of you tooI crawl deep within my self
I don't bear out with this pain
Why do I only feel hate
Why did you do this to me
You touched my innocent skin
You said it wasn't wrong
But when I close my eyes to sleep
I wish that you would feel my pain
I kill you in my thought
I strangle you in my dreams
You twisted sick fuck
I wish that you will die
You touched my innocent skin
You said it wasn't wrong
But when I close my eyes to sleep
I wish that you would feel my pain
My memories will never fade
They will always be there
What you did to me
I can never forgive
I crawl deep within my self
I don't bear out with this pain
Why do I only feel hate
Why did you do this to me
You touched my innocent skin
You said it wasn't wrong
But when I close my eyes to sleep
I wish that you would feel my pain
My memories will never fade
They will always be there
What you did to me
I can never forgive[my faith in you has always been there]
[I thought my trust in you would always last]
[but since you've deceived me]
[now that has to change]
[I'm on a mission built on vengeance]
[and I'll never forget the past]
Here I stand
I see your name carved in stone
I can almost hear your laughter
But yesterday's gone
This loneliness so cold
this emptiness so cruel
God has forsaken me
And my faith too
God you were my Judas
Your deception killed my belief
God you were my Judas
Your deception...
Your nails hammered in
You made me wear your crown of thorns
With your hands by the hammer
You made me take the fall
Where are your angels now
When darkness all I see
What are your blessings worth
When all left is A Scattered Me
God you were my Judas
your deception killed my belief
God you were my Judas
your deception
God you were my Judas
your deception killed my belief
God you were my Judas
your deceptionI am the soul of a nameless machine*
I can only breath, I can only breed, I can only bleed.
Bleed out over her wishing it was me.
It's a joke played by god on you and me
A cruel act of divinity.
Only dreams of winters dead leaves.
Falling from trees
Falling on me.
Hanging three feet from the earth that I cant seem to leave.
This hurts, this hurts, this hurts.
All I can do is bleed with her.
This hurts
First I'll slit your throat and let you bleed out.
Then I'll use a knife to carve your eyes out. (2x)
Everyone missing our last laugh, just broken hearts and shattered glass.
just two ghosts from the past screaming love song.
Hung by your words, the wore me down.
I'm swimming out to sea and I don't want to be found.
Which one of you?
Tried to save me.
Which one of you?
Tried to stop me.
Which one of you?
Which one of you?
I am the soul of a nameless machine.
I can only breath, I can only breed, I can only bleed.
Bleed out over her wishing it was me.
It's a joke played by god ob you and me
A cruel act of divinity.
Only dreams of winters dead leaves.
Falling from tress.
Falling on me.
Hanging three feet from the earth that I cant seem to leave.
This hurts, this hurts. all I can do is dream of her.A palace of crystal on a postament of slime
Rule of refinement, rats in the cellar
Restless and climbing as slime and mud come
Flooding
Grace greased by ingratitude and greed
By a despicable debris of delinquence and
Debauchery
The palace is of crystal, but the postament is
Slime
House man built
House man built
This house was built, God is dead
Dead is gone, God is gone
No body's found, unstable ground
But the house was built
Throw out the ballast and the vessel will be
Faster
The called are over-crowding the market,
Let the chooser be the market,
And the loosers - we'll wall out all the loosers
And those among us who turned foul, they're growing more
For every hour
The rich are getting richer, the poor begin to steal
As multiplied police force feels more righteous than wealth
Program
Gaps widening 'till it bursts asunder
Threw out the ballast and the vessel went under
House man built
House man built
This house was built, God is dead
Dead is gone, God is gone
No body's found, unstable ground
But the house was built
The scene is set for a grand new war
This war is final - no new markets to explore
This war will transport us through door
When all is fire, God will set the score
House man built
House man builtCon semilla satnica nacieron nios malditos
Sangre de raza, las caras gabachos
La madre fue gata - el padre fue rico
Sangre vale menos que agua
Molestados de nios, muchachos desobedientes
Les quitaban los calzones, corrian encuerados
Su padre culero, dando pinche cuerasos
Sangre vale menos que mecos
Nios adultos huevones ricos
Feriados sin sudar una gota
Hermanos con ambiciones querian los millones
Sangre vale menos que lana
Hermanos Menndez
Hijos chingados, odiaban sus padres
Planearon a sangre fra chingarlos un da
Hermanos malditos amaban el dinero
Hermanos Menndez
Sus almas vendidas, con el diablo metido
Armados como banditos - padres medios dormidos
Balaceados por la espalda cayo muerto el padre
A la gata se le acabaron las vidas
Pobres pendejos los hermanos Menndez
Acusados del crimen - se cagaron millones
[English translate: The Brothers Menendez]
With satanic seed cursed children were born
Race's blood, American faces
Their mother was a cat - their father was rich
Blood worths less than water
Hermanos Menndez
Children molested, disobedient boys
They took off their pants, they ran around naked
Their asshole father, giving them welts
Blood worths less than cum
Hermanos Menndez
Adult children stupid rich men
Paid without sweating a drop
Brothers with ambitions wanted the millions
Blood worths less than a money
Hermanos MenndezOn a day-to-day theres no way most men make it through
I got to tell you now
Family tied to me, Im doing just what I got to do
I got to tell you now
All a mans got is his word and to keep himself free
Do with your life what you will, stay away from my family
Born blue collar been working since I was thirteen
My father was up at five and broke his back to keep us clean
My mother sweated and slaved and suffered for the family
So when you push me dont think that I wont shove
I got to tell you now
What does it take to be a man, what does it take!?!
YEAH!
What does it take to be a man, what does it take!?!
YEAH!
What does it take
What does it take
What does it take
To be a man?!!
On a day-to-day theres no way most men make it through
I got to tell you now
Family tied to me, Im doing just what I got to do
I got to tell you now
When I was a young man I was told to take a stand
And damn it boy, you better stick to a plan
So on a day-to-day you better walk a mans path
Learn how to walk a mans mile, get that game face smile
Dont put up with people who get in your way
And when you push dont think that I wont shove
I got to tell you now
What does it take to be a man, what does it take!?!
YEAH!
What does it take to be a man, what does it take!?!
YEAH!
What does it take

What does it take
To be a man?!!
What does it take
What does it take
What does it take
To be a man?!!Originally performed by Kingston Wall
I must be out of my mind as I hear you call
My name is even though I can't see you anywhere
Surely this feeling must be coming from something
Someone gave me yesterday as I searched for you
And I hear you call
I hear you call my name
But when I turn around
There's nothing to be found
I must be dreaming a dream of a lunatic
My fingers taste like some strawberry ice-cream
I hear you call my name but I don't think it's
The same I heard you whisper in my earLook above to stormswept skies
Towards the gates of Hades
I am drifting with the tide
On a path that candles light
I will follow your way
Reaching for your hand
A faithful desire - flames light the twilight
A star has died before my eyes
Through this storm of fire - as it falls upon me
In the endless shine
The light that beams only for me
Night will fall as I meet you within the light
And I laugh at the ruins of time
Go ahead through this passage and I will guide
This last starlight's return to the sky
Unknown powers guide my trail
Crawl beneath my skin
And rip apart the heart that failed
Gazing down on stormy grounds
Diabolic scenery
Where beyond our truth is found
Foretold and forgotten - like a word of wisdom
That a fool is pulling down
Beguiled by the rotten - that there's no more time
To turn the page and save the light...
...The light that beams only for me
So come down to waters wild
Take my hand and follow
As it's told, but never done
Just across this sunken shrine
Keeping candles burning
As your star by moonlight shines
Escape from debouchment - Diabolarch's laughing
Soon will ring his own demise
And on this horizon watch a fallen rising
Taking place by Venus' sideOne More Year
Growing up into a fine young man entails
to clean up our act and start to pay more
attention to the things that I swore I'd never get myself into
Without a doubt, once singled out Until I met you
Eyes closed, it was 2009, and
I finally got the nerve before we said g
oodbyes to tell you
"This is my last chance, I won't let it pass me,
I think I'm in love, so please don't leave without me"
Now four years down on the road,
I gained some wimpy little facial hairs,
but still in the same boat
With downtown's and the radio high,
living on an infinite life
Long conversations at the lighthouse on Hefner,
trying to figure out what life's got planned
Then I'd write on your back in our backseat bedroom,
"You plus me 'till the end"
So let's get up, get gone, prove them all wrong
Until the fear in your hands meet the wings that you'll grow
When the day comes that 18 hits, keep your heart in the clouds, let your feet do the rest
And when we grow up, get lost, in the cities so cold,
we'll stand up tall and then we'll find our way back home
Because my home is that of a long list when I've got you girl
Remember this
You say I'm a dreamer and need to see clearer,
but purchase a mirror, you're just like me
So with full hearts and heads high,
we'll lock hands and we'll fly away
In your ear I will say,
"It takes life to love life, to fall down and still try
So get on your high horse and don't be scared
Your place in this world compares to no other,
your end undiscovered
So let's get out of here"
Get up, get gone, prove them all wrong These streets have been our home for too longI see it now
I feel it now

Lifeless being life deceiving
Materialistic lie existing till you die
The world cannot give nor let you live
Lustful bodies skinned to the core
still crying out for so much more
Needing eyes filled with desire
made to be just another liar
Turn away it's hell to pay
Not a very nice place to stay
When you die the needing eyes cry
there's nothing left to consume
All that you've worked for falls through the dust
there's only hell left to pay for your lust
Materialistic lie existing till you die
The world cannot give nor let you liveTurbine starts, engines whine
Rocket fire, you know it s blast off time
Burning fuel, deadly tool
Break the sky, shock wave blast, ripping fast
The speed of sound, speed of sound
The speed of sound, speed of sound
Sonic boom, machine of doom
The power to fly, bird s eye view,climbing to
[Chorus:]
The speed of sound, speed of sound
The speed of sound, speed of sound
The speed of sound, speed of sound
The speed of sound, speed of sound
High speed flight, vapour trail
Thunderous thrust, hear the engine s wail
After burn, no return
The angel s cry, searing speed, the power to exceed
[Chorus 2X]The road behind is crumbling
Time is paved by agony
So many signs before me
The way ahead I cannot see
So many things I long for
The way ahead it ceased to be
Tears of strive are falling
A reason shine arises
Obsessive thoughts are calling
Ideas just strange devices
Temptation all around me
Shall I resist shall I give in
Might it is the answer
Tell me the question to begin
Buried in time and history
Not to strive is a sin
Tears of strive are falling
A reason shine arises
Obsessive thoughts are calling
Ideas just strange devices
Desire it defeats me
Distorted pictures of my life
An uncertain liquid
The pool in which I have to dive
Drowned by insane imaginations
All what's left I have to strive
Tears of strive are falling
A reason shine arises
Obsessive thoughts are calling
Ideas just strange devicesWooden grief
lost in silence
dream of life
cold as shudder
Every day from birth
only way I walk.
loosing my own breath
fool with ticking clock
Bitter sorrow

There's colder than everHungry for your life
Blinding you with words
Playing on your innocence
The truth that goes unheard
Fucking with your life
Fucking with your head
Let your knowledge be your strength
Or you'll be ripped to shreds
Filling you with lies
While breathing down your neck
Bleeding your well dry
Broken into a wreck
Fucking with your life
Fucking with your head
Let your knowledge be your strength
Or you'll be ripped to shredsit beckons to us all
sometimes we cannot hide
it beckons us inside
open the door, a knock so pure
in comes the seraphim
teach me things, I already know
filled with adrenalin
cut him down, yet he grows back
and makes my blood sing
it beckons to us all
sometimes we cannot hide
the most unusual thing
the once and future king
wide open the door, a knock for sure?
in comes the seraphim
leave me things I don't need
like a life to begin
cuts me down, cut, cut
in comes the new kingTell me baby
Are you coming over or do I need to go back to sleep?
This scene is utter chaos
You're driving me crazy with all the little secrets you keep
This name means nothing to me
All I ever needed
All I ever wanted was you
Take a look outside your window
I'm watching closely
I see everything that you do.
Are you coming
Are you coming with me?
Are you coming
Coming home with me
Are you coming with me?
Are you coming
Are you coming with me?
Are you coming
Coming home with me
I just wanna be anyone you need
I just wanna breathe the air you breathe so deep
When will you see you're the one for me?
You know you really need to come home with me
Every night after dark the beast comes out to feed
Feel the wrath of standing still
No more hogging the window
I'm coming out and I'm needing to feed
Let me play you that endnote
Tell me baby
Are you coming over or do I need to go back to sleep
This scene is utter chaos
You're driving me crazy with all the little secrets you keep
This name means nothing to me
All I ever needed
All I ever wanted was you
Take a look out your window
I'm watching closely I see everything that you do
I want you to feel me in you
If you only knew revealing the truth
Can it be seen this change in me?
One last goodbye
Kissing you goodnight
I'll pave the way through to better days
Forget today
There seems to be no other way
One thing I'll say is that I know all things will break
Your trying hard
You come off like a fake
Stars fall
Please do your best to soften up their landing.Stanken fra den uransaklige vei

S nr dommedagstorden endelig runger
Kan menneskets fantasibilde avdukes
Alle og enhver med gudfryktig hunger
Vil tape ansikt og slukesAre they vagabonds in your phrases
Drowned voices in the edge of time
Amid peals of laughter
In stillness and my beast goes rapidly and hides
My wild thoughts of you
Do they feel this time
See it through to the end
Part is wasted and part stille goes
I won't heed your call
I have left myself here and
I won't let you go
(I may lost myself but your scenes still goes)
My wild thoughts (of you)
Do they know (if I'm guilty)
(Make me wear) this time
See it through to the endIn the olden wood
when the sun bright the dawn
I am feeling alone
lost into the infinitude
Light and darkness in my mind
Liquid shadows cross the place
Oaks whisper like the wind
vail of tears on my face
Elves sing our names
You and I have called
our dreams are enthralled
Underneath eternal flames
From the bells began to chime
Old ones know our destiny
Real souls are out of time
ever since melancholyAwaiting my last breath
The mirror calls my name
It's showing me the way
Into the dark
The bridge appears
I jump into the dark side
And hear the voice it's cold as ice
"Welcome to reality"
Where am I now?
Darkness surrounds
Can't go forward
Can't go back
I see planets dying
I fall into the light
A new universe awakes
I'm a Traveler in Time
Pray for the light
Where's the key
To the gate
Of a new life - no
I search for deliverance
But I cannot find
[Chorus]
Look behind the mirror
I'm lost in the twilight hall
Once I'll be back for a moment in time
That's when the mirror's falling down
Take me away
From the place I've been
To another life
In another world
A sign of life
Surrounds me now
The bridge appears in the dark
I'm free
I fly alone
Leaving the darkness now, forever?
The memories of children
And the wisdom of many lifes
Burns deep in me
Where will the light go to?
Where will the light go to?
Is this deliverance?
Is it the end?
[Chorus]
I'm back there's a new chance for me
And all my memories are gone
I can feel what's happening to me
And the mirrow will burst

A tale of wrong and right
And freedom is the reason
You can't take it without a fight
So now I'm startin' up a posse
(suck my dick, suck my dick)
To come and look for you
We're gonna put a stop
To what you want to do
You fucking whores (you fuckin' whores)
That's all you are
You say our records are offensive
(you're a douche, you're a douche)
Our messages ain't right
You say "we're gonna label records
So our kids can grow up right"
You fucking whores (let them decide)
That's all you are
Shit, fuck, satan, death, sex drugs, rape
These seven words you're trying to take
Shit, fuck, satan, death, sex, drugs, rape
Right or wrong it's our choice to make
America the beautiful, land of the free
Don't change the words to land of hypocrisy
Now I'm startin' up a posse (fascist scum, fascist scum)
And we'll damn sure make you see
Something that offends you
May not be offensive to me
You f*cking whores (you fuckin' whores)
That's all you are
Now you might take offense
To a word like "fuck" or "shit" (dick!)
But you fuckin' don't have the right (cunt!)
To discriminate me for saying it!
You fuckin' whores (you fuckin' whores)
That's all you are
So now I'm startin' up a posse (motherfucker, motherfucker)
To fight for freedom of choice
To fight for freedom of speech
We're gonna make you hear our voice
And now I don't do this to shock you
(that's the end, that's the end)
I don't do this for spite
You've got the choice, don't buy it, don't read it,
And don't say your opinion's right
You f*cking whores (you fuckin' whores)
That's all you are (cunty, cunty, cunty, cunt)
You know you can't censor my feelings
You can't censor my thoughts
Censorship's against
Everything america stands for
You fuckin' whores (let us decide)
That's all you are (and this ain't sexist, either)[Shaggy:]
I was skipping down the block when I heard some moaning
It was Dorothy she said she need some loving
Who the fuck was I to say no?
I took her to the crib, popped in that one movie Ghost
And it was on, my clothes got to pealing
It was sexual healing, but with no feeling
I was sticking my dick into thin air
And right when I busted, Dorothy disappeared
[Monoxide:]
When I met her it was January, middle of winter
I was alone up in my attic where nobody could hear her
It was just a cold gust of wind, I felt somebody pass through me
When I opened up my eyes, my only love appeared to me
Long hair, and she was bald in spots
And her skin was just as soft as a parking lot
And it was love at first sight
I'd never seen her again
And to this day I'm in my attic waiting on my girlfriend
[Chorus:]
Baby, I'm dead but I need you
I'm buried right here, and I'll never leave you
(Baby) She's deader then a doornail, looking for love
Doornail Dorothy was the neighborhood ghost.
(Baby) She's deader then a doornail, looking for love
Doornail Dorothy was the neighborhood ghost.
[Violent J:]
I started blowing her up with sance after sance
It's my turn, Violent J, to get in them pants
We went for ice cream but we almost got arrested
"Look he's got a dead body and he's over there molesting it"
I had to throw her in the trunk and take her to the crib
Cause mother fuckers always trippin, they need their money shit
We made love, rigor mortis set and my dick got stuck
But we didn't give a fuck
Hold me forever tight DorothyUp in the north I found my home
I find my peace and I can be just myself
But now it's threatened soon it'gone
I have to guard it with my life and my sword
The riders came, they were too strong
I was so young I had to flee for my life
They burned it down and killed them all
There's nothing left but my will for revenge
I am the one I am the rider made of steel
I take no charge in taking blood
Into the night I will ride upon my horse
Into the night I will strike
The triumph Of Steel
I'm fighting and using my steel
The triumph of steel
The sword that makes me believe
The ride was long the ride was hard
found a way but I'll never be alone
they came from north they came from south
to seek revenge and they joined me on my ride
The devil's run has just begun
Their cries of fear are carried in the wind
We are the ones we are the warriors of steel
We take no charge in taking blood
Into the night we will ride upon our horses
Into the night we will strike
The triumph of steel
We're fighting, using our steel
The triumph of steel
The sword that makes us believeI know I bend and I break all my promises,
But now it's time for the truth.
I keep my head in the clouds and I hope
That I can't just be invisible to you.
Are you sick, are you tired, are you feeling faint?
Your lips are turning blue.
I know you wish you were dead to the world,
But there's something you should know.
You're scared, I can see you tremble,
Shaking like a dog, shitting razor blades.
Feel love shadows like a stranger,
Well join the club, yeah, join the club!
Do you wish that you could cut yourself out of your skin?
Well join the club, yeah, join the club!
Whatever the fuck it takes to feel like you fit in?
Well join the club, yeah, join the club!
Life is a song with no one to dance to,
Same old shit happening and nobody knows.
My heart is a dead horse, there's no point in beating,
Just let me sink, let me sink into the fucking ground.
Fuck it.
You're scared, I can see you tremble,
Shaking like a dog, shitting razor blades.
Feel love shadows like a stranger,
Well join the club, yeah, join the club!
Do you think you're the only one who feels the way you do?
We're all fifty shades of fucked up!
Well join the club, yeah, join the club!
I know I bend and I break all my promises,
But now it's time for the truth.
I keep my head in the clouds and I hope
That I can't just be invisible to you.
I know I bend and I break all my promises,
But now it's time for the truth.
I keep my head in the clouds and I hope
That I can't just be invisible to you.
You're scared, I can see you tremble,
Shaking like a dog, shitting razor blades.
Feel love shadows like a stranger,
Well join the club, yeah, join the club!
Do you think you're the only one who feels the way you do?
We're all fifty shades of fucked up!
Well join the club, yeah, join the club!Life of desperation that's his way
Searching for a light to shine today, but I know that I won't
Help me Jesus can't you feel my pain
I'm so tired, twisted and insane, taken a look in my eyes
There's no living! Forgiving! God help me please!
[Chorus]
I'm lost in the dark
I don't know which way I'm facing
I reach to feel my way, a life caught in the maze
There's no living! Forgiving! God help me please!
[Chorus: x2]
Institution, no solution, this is destiny I know
Living, living, scared of dying, wondering where it is I'll go
Oh no, no no
Oh no, no no
Lost in the dark
Lost in the darkThe end of time has come, the day after.
Everything is black, the world is over.
There are no trees, all life has crumbled.
Cities tumbled down, man's self-destruction.
The end of time has come, the day after.
Everything is black, the world is over.
There are no trees, all life has crumbled.
Cities tumbled down, man's self-destruction.
Screams from deep below, what can they be?
Sounds of pounding metal, radiation creation.
A creature of strength and power so real.
Ascends from beneath, Metalshock to reveal.
Atomchild begins to grow, scans the barren zones,
Exploring his new home, he's all alone...
Through days and nights he roams,
Upper streets and catacombs,
No life at all, but a megawatt wall.
Great wall stacks to the sky, scarred V lays nigh.
Reaches out his mighty fist, the power gives a hiss.
The louder it gets, the better he feels.
His secret unveils, Metalshock is revealed.
Pounding Metal across the land,
Life-giving magic in his hands,
The power chords raise the dead,
People come alive banging their heads.
Mankind now lives for Metal, it's inside of us all.
The power from the shock, rise after we fall.
The creature of strength and power so real,
Returns us to Earth's core until World War Four.
Pounding Metal across the land,
Life-giving magic in his hands,
The power chords raise the dead,
People come alive banging their heads.Watch and wave goodbye
It's a hopeless feeling
To know that you and I
Are left in a world that's reeling
Out of control
We shouldn't fight it
Drop into the bowl
We'll pull through bit by bit
We are the lights that will keep on burning
When the darkness comes
In memory we will keep on singing
Long after you've been gone
At the point of no return
Our sons and daughters
Will watch the fires burn
While drinking water
Ashes to ashes
We'll fall but not too far
Through looking glasses
One day we'll see where we are
We are the lights that will keep on burning
When the darkness comes
In memory we will keep on singing
Long after you've been gone
We, we are the lights. we are the ones who will guide the way
We will bring the fight; our memories will carry on the way
We are the lights, we will keep on burning
Our memories of a world for which we're yearning
We are the lights, we are the lights. we are burning down
Another night, another fight; are we burning out?
We are the lights that will keep on burning
When the darkness comes
In memory we will keep on singing
Long after you've been goneSick, sick, sick, murder and crucifix
Thieves and liars, holding hands
Joint effort, rape of land, supply and demand
Sick, sick, sick, all together now, sick, sick, sick
Wave the flag of warfare, plague
Famine and death, let God sort them out
Indiscriminate slaughter of the damned
Rotting carnage, indiscriminate
Thieves and liars, murderers
Well rehearsed, children first
Hypocrites with bachelors in greed
Ravaged land, severed hand to serve demand
Decapitated head, come souvenir
Fan the flame of warfare, plague
Famine and death, let God sort them out
Devastation by fire from the sky
Serve to die
Fierce and relentless progress
Burning sea choked with corpses
Get away with anything
This is what the angels bring
Genocide and suffering
Soldiers of the apocalypse
Murderers and hypocrites
Thieves and liars reign in hell
Godless with no soul to sell
Apocalyptic terror, godless era
Go with God
Go with God
Go with God
Go with God
Rotten to the core, greedy like a war
Always after more, go with God
Fan the flame, the godless never rest
Paradise inside, Hubris, Nemesis
Vermin, death
Reign in hell
Now, it's the end of the ride
Let God sort them out
Indiscriminate slaughter of the damned
Wave the flag of warfare, plague
Famine and death, let God sort them out
Devastation by fire from the sky
Serve to die
Warfare, plague, famine, death
Warfare, plague, famine, death[INTERLUDE]Bearer of Sword
Stands beyond (the) Triumphant
As Eternal Night falls
On the Planet of (almost full) Void
Weaves War with a gesture of Might
Fallen are the Souls
Blinded by the Warrior Dreams
Finds the star invisible
To most of the regular Men and Slaves
and The Master serves Him
Leaves then for the Last Time
Finally His Castle
Monument of Misanthropy and Wrath
Hate
Loyal Friend of His Sober Hours
Treads on while the Faith Whips Sharp
Mental pain makes His Eyes Gleam
A light made of Dark Thrones and Frozen Winds
Now can leave the planetDo you hear the cries those tear the silence of night
Cries of forgotten souls, signed by a painful life.
In search for the real truth, the ancient spirits show the way
Dark shadows - eternity, black coldness - frozen air.
Between the dreams, the dreams of damnation
Chained by fear, splattered by tortures.
The dreams of damnation
Chained by fear, splattered by tortures.
Flight for a long, long time
Through protecting blackness of night
The inner fight - revenge
The saving fight so far away.
The dreams of...
Flight for...
Pictures of destructed life
Miracles of existence
Chaos rules - burning fields
Tears of sorrow - hate.
Journey through the spiritual past into the loneliness
To the ancient kingdoms, return of the damned souls.Ever heard my suffer
I wonder why, is this real
What have you done to me
For no reason at all
And I feared
You don't seem
Just gave up
Why, do you care
Everything is lost
All hope is gone
And I even won't complain
For this is my way of the cross
And I feared for this to happen
You do not seem to care
Just gave up all we had
Don't you bother
Don't you fucking care
Do you care
And still I try to forget
It keeps on running inside my mind
AloneI plead for men to hear
This declaration from my soul
I pray they turn their ears to true life
Casting the anger of death aside
The life of sacrifice met with such hostility
Even to death, but raised up in victory
How could this life bring so much pain?
Day after day, after day
Its never over
Until we shut our eyes for the very last time
Its never over
Until the line flattens out
Like death, the grave
It waits, its anger is unrelenting
Against all things, against all time and space
Embrace the end
Youll think its over
When you shut your eyes for the very last time
Youll think its over
[Incomprehensible]
Death scares me not
Death scares me not
Pleading for men to hear this declaration from my soul
I pray they turn their itching ears
Anger is near, death is waiting, the grave is calling
Anger is near, death is waiting, the grave is callingFarewell
Yesterday when we were young
Like a flower in the desert sand
So transient the cycle of life
[Chorus]
Within a moment of time
Within a while of a years' decline
The brightest of stars above
In night-time skies divine
Here
It is an everflowing stream
When they are coming to redeem
Us from the night
That never sees the day
[Chorus]
And when the years passing by
No one will answer no one will cry
The solace in sea of tears
Into a new sunshine
Glory ascending
From days never ending
Unfold your dreams right now
[Chorus]Trapped behind my state of mind
I took your words and now I'm blind.
And everything you've given just kills me.
Your words swarm through my soul like locusts.
Eating away at any glimpse of focus.
Their eyes flaming red like pain.
Filling the void once righteous and bloodstained.
But words can't kill the light inside me
That tears me from the hate that binds me.
I feel it crawling up my spine.
But I'll cut it off before it reaches the bloodline.
You'll never fade me out, you'll never turn me off.
You'll never reach the end, you'll never hear enough.
You're half-grasp can't exterminate my stand.
You can't rule with a broken upper hand.
A fragment of what's been left behind.
Trapped behind my state of mind,
I took your words and now I'm blind.
And everything you've given just kills me.
Trapped behind my state of mind,
I took your words and now I'm blind.
And everything you've given just kills me. (YEAH)
Your face brings out the hate that rots me.
The face of everyday that haunts me.
I can't pull away my blank stare.
A thousand times should prove I don't care.
But hands can't steal the light that makes me.
Or bring me to the fate that breaks me
I feel it crawling up my spine.
But I'll cut it off before it reaches the bloodline.
You'll never fade me out, you'll never turn me off.
You'll never reach the end, you'll never hear enough.
You're the half-grasp can't exterminate my stand.
You can't rule with a broken upper hand.
A fragment of what's been left behind.
Trapped behind my state of mind
I took your words and now I'm blind.
And everything you've given just kills me.
Trapped behind my state of mind
A fragment of what's been left behind
I took your words and now I'm blind.
And everything you give just kills me.
Trapped behind my state of mind
A fragment of what's been left behind
I took your words and now I'm blind.
And everything you give just kills me
KILLS ME! (8x)A horseman rides slowly through the mirror's sight
He's singing a hymn for the victory of another fight
Lancelot, his semblance radiates a mystic might
Hair from underneath his helmet, and the red helmet feather
Wave in the wind like a licking flame together
This brave armoured knight; raised by the lady to a goal
Because the flames of lust carbonise her soul
Infinite sadness or smothered grief
So alone, but these emotions won't leave
Your state, going from bad to worse
Now as lust evokes the curse
You left the web for pictures that the mirror sent
And forgot the loom
While you stepped towards the casement,
embraced by the arms of doom
Your lust brought you to the end
Fairy lady of Shallot
Now as you're looking down at Camelot
She's engulfed by the dismal night
When the wind extinguishes the candlelight
She's searing for this heroic knight
Wrapped in the web in which memories hide
Then the mirror cracked from side to side
The curse came upon her and she cried...
"Death chooses me to be its bride..."A scarlet sunset
the threshold to nightplay
A sinful oath is to be sworn
A beckoning bloodlust
among the seekers
Tyrranic hunger yearns
A gathering in flames and fires-
Devil's daughters dance
Scourged in filth, obscene and lewd-
Longing for dark desires
The nocturnal beast appears
in an evil despotic shape
Expectant watching gracelessly
before demanding the sluts of lust
(the Beast)
"Come forth harlots, let's begin!"
(the Beast approaches: )
"Rise and give praise in front of Me
and receive eternal life from Me!
Welcome my spirit in jonour of Me!
So drink of the blood I provide you
and you shall all forever wander in the shadows of death...!
(the chanting whores: )
"Oh yes, Master! Let us receive
Thine offer and drink with Thee!
And become a part of Thy realm
with lust, sex and sodomy-
for we are those who seek life eternally...!
(the Beast: )
"Blood is life and it shall be all ours!"I forgot about the time that there was somebody in my past,
I feel time has passed so quickly since I took the photograph.
Thanks for the memory that doesn't fade in my heart.
Look at us smiling in the photograph, you can see the secrets behind the fake smiles.
Thanks for the memory that doesn't fade in my heart.
The past was destroyed by you,
I'm not going to forget our truth was shadowed in the darkness of war.
I forgot about the time that there was somebody in my past,
I feel time has passed so quickly since I took the photograph.
Thanks for the memory that doesn't fade in my heart.
Look at us smiling in the photograph, you can see the secrets behind the fake smiles.
Thanks for the memory that doesn't fade in my heart.
The past was destroyed by you,
I'm not going to forget our truth was shadowed in the darkness of war.
The moment when it was destroyed is burned into histroy.
We can't rewind like a video.
Misleading future not required.
Only the weak among you will be sacrificed.
A false history is not necessary.
No matter what, isn't even a harsh future better than a history made by somebody else?
Don't you think so? [Repeat: x8]So quick to judge
So easily we forget
What it's like to be dissected
Where feelings are tossed aside
Like a drug it feeds the imagination of minds
That go unparalyzed
Followers to the leaders of mass hypnotic corruption
That live their lives only to criticize
Where is the invisible line that we must draw
To create individual thought patterns
Prisoners of mental deception
Be free within singular judgment
Twisting words to control the masses
To cover up one's self insecurities
Like a drug it feeds the imagination of minds
That go unparalyzed
Followers to the leaders of mass hypnotic corruption
That live their lives only to criticize
Where is the invisible line that we must draw
To create individual thoughtLike a bolt from the blue
I'm the boy I never knew
Suddenly I hate myself
My band and the whole crew
So I step out for some days
To damn my entire life, oh
I wanna reinvent myself
So recharge the light over my head
This bright white light over my head
That showed me the way
To the other side where I can be myself
I wanna meet me, myself and I
For dinner tonight, we three cool guys
Who are about to find their lives
I see myself giggling with this chick
While me gets drunk with I
So recharge the light over my head
This bright, white light over my head
That showed me the way
After three days Christ is back
Kissed, blessed, glissened
Shining, glamoures and clean
A fresh bulb in the socket
So recharge, so recharge
Please don't burn out
Please don't burn out
Please don't burn out
Please don't burn outThere's nothing I hate more, than all these plastic people
With all their plastic promises, and all there plastic deals
They just can't be themselves, and live their own lives out
They're just an imitation of what life's all about
"Because of me you are who you are
So sign your name and you'll go for
I'm your friend, I think you should
So sign your name, it's for your own good"
How many times have you heard this today???
Some bogus piss-on saying "let's do lunch babe"
For them this bullshit, that's their whole life
Cut through their bullshit with a knife
Imitation of life
Oh, oh, oh
Anger burns
Whatever happened to the guy I knew
A media creation, a monster grew
Our story had an unhappy end
But this could change, I still call him friend
"Take my advice, and listen to me
A great opportunity, can't you see
I only want what's best for you
The deal of a lifetime, what more can I do"
How many times have you heard this today?
Some stupid sucker says "it's great, we love ya babe"
For them this bullshit, it's their whole life
Cut through their bullshit with a knife
Imitation of life
Oh, oh, oh
Anger burns
Bands dress like women with hairspray and lace
I'd pass an image law, stick it in your face!
Let's see how long they keep dressing this way
Wearing this image twenty four hours a day!
Did you ever think for yourself??
Just once, did you ever think??
That's all I want to know
Imitation of life, living out a lie
You'll never be right, imitation of life
Why are you here??, you're taking up my space
The new imperfect race, imitation of life
Oh, oh, oh
Anger burns
Whatever happened to the guy I knew
A media creation, a monster grew
Our story had a unhappy end
But this could change, I still call him friend
There's nothing I hate more
Than all these plastic people
With all their plastic promises
And all their plastic deals
They just can't be themselves
And live their own lives out
They're just an imitation
Of what life's all about
Imitation of life!Verse
How can I know which one, which one is the right one
How can I know which one, which one is the one love
How can I choose one boy, I feel lonely lonely
I know you are out there but I cannot get you

Oh, Mickey, your so blue

Oh, Mickey, your so blue (Repeat)
Repeat Chorus and Chant to endThe brawling of a sparrow in the eaves,
The brilliant moon and all the milky sky,
And all that famous harmony of leaves,
Had blotted out man's image and his cry.
A girl arose that had red mournful lips
And seemed the greatness of the world in tears,
Doomed like Odysseus and the labouring ships
And proud as Priam murdered with his peers;
Arose, and on the instant clamorous eaves,
A climbing moon upon an empty sky,
And all that lamentation of the leaves,
Could but compose man's image and his cry.
[From the poem "The Sorrow of Love" by William Butler Yeats]Quest for truth never ceases
As wisdom brutally teaches
Pacing back and forth again, and again
Just searching for an end
Panic wave chaos showers
Sickening stench of man gone sour
Laughing at us in our face, we're disgraced
and then we're all erased
Persevere - Holding out - Make it end!
Giving in - Giving up - Let it end!
Why is it infinite?
The evil that revolves around our universe
The always changing, never changing
Why is it infinite?
The evil that revolves around our universe
The always changing, never changing
Nothing changes!
Pressure point, burning rage
No turning back, no release from this cage
One man calls the other one a liar
There's fire escalating higher -
Endless wars, lost causes
Only letting up for brief pauses
Time repeats this circle of madness
Repetition of constant sadness
Persevere - Holding out - Make it end!
Giving in - Giving up - Let it end!
Why is it infinite?
The evil that revolves around our universe
The always changing, never changing
Why is it infinite?
The evil -
The always changing, never changing
Nothing changes?

Food for thought, no answer to our questions
Save your breath - Waste no words

You lost your touch. Hiding behind transparent lines. Afraid to fail, so
safe in security. I remember what you always told me. Never isn't
something for everyone. Just give it away. And it seems there will be
nothing to say. Just like you said. And it seems there will be nothing to
say. I never thought your stare could see right through me. I never
thought to see who stood behind me. You lost your touch. Afraid to fail,
so safe, hiding. Just give it away. Just like you said, never, ending.
Can I tear your eyes out to show you what you've become? Is this what
forever feels like? This is the only way my heart knows how to beat. (A
few kisses could make us honest.) And if only one more, make it last
forever.Street signs, so many street signs pass me by every night and
I know tomorrow I won't recognize the world
Home bound, but I want to be home now
Two more months of empty faces standing there screaming up at me
And I don't know why
I wanna go home I wanna sleep in my own bed
I want a normal life again
Is this the end? Is this the end?
No matter how hard I try, all I know is the road
All I know is the road
Save me, can anyone save me?
I don't know who I am anymore
This was supposed to be the dream
You don't see the pain in my eyes?
You don't hear the pain in my words?
I'm just stuck here cold and alone with no one beside me
And I wanna go home
I wanna go home I wanna sleep in my own bed
I want a normal life again
Is this the end? Is this the end?
No matter how hard I try, all I know is the road
All I know is the road
And you wonder why I'm out of my mind?
I wanna go home I wanna sleep in my own bed
I want a normal life again
Is this the end? Is this the end?
No matter how hard I try, all I know is the road
All I know is the roadBeating bright and in the eye, the isles of the body they turn.
They are shaped by the flood, the onset of a blindness.
Leeched, and wearied, unfolding somewhere else.
It is gone and the body is stood blind.
Back through, a dirge, a remedy and a fever.
Borders sketched without song.
A child was buried here.
Here, my son was buried.
And God danced around the coffin.
and we danced with your God.
and I watched my mothers body, raped by a prophet.
I watched my son die.Why are you a piece of shit? Fucking pathetic you make me sick
I'm tired of your face, you're such a prick
hang yourself, worthless bitch
don't you hate life and you lost your pride?
Don't you feel like theres nothing left inside?
Cut your wrists up and down not side to side
cause when you die theres no scars to hide
ain't you crying lonely in the night?
Thinking to your mind this might be your time?
Screaming at god why can't you die?
For being a pussy and go try
if I was in your frame would I recommend that suicide is now the new trend
this is the end make that noose tighter, set yourself on fire
I hate myself, you hate yourself
kill yourself x3 you're shy
if you hate yourself why don't you just kill yourself
kill yourself x3 you're shy
You're a fucking loser kid so focus
nobody likes you, but you've noticed
go in garage and grab a noose, yeah
make it tight, do you know what to do? (no?)
so just listen up
when you get in the garage just pull a chair up
nobody cares about you it's so true
nobody loves you and never will dude
you've been a fuck up ever since your dad left
and your mom doesn't care if you end up homeless
they don't give a fuck, so why should you?
So jump up on that chair right now dude
don't look now, just slowly close your eyes
you're 'bout to let it down, you said your last goodbyes
now take a deep breath and kick that chair off
for everyone left a lifeless shockDevilish cold surrounds me
Everything feels so untrue
Am I real, do I exist
Am I dreaming, do I dream...
Opened my eyes to see what I feel
Truth lies beneath under me
Trail of blood and trace of anger
Makes me continue my journey for free...
Follow the blood 'til the ravens scream
Then you know you've reached what you seek
Taste the blood 'til the wolves howl
Then you know you've reached what you bow...
The blood on the path that says
Follow right thru this way
Realizing that's just blood
Dripping from me, only from me
On my path...I've been there
On your path...I've been here
On this path...Have I been there
On this path...have I been here
There's no sense nor reason
Alone I am, and yes it is real
Path of circle, walk forever
Never will find a way out here...Making way through blades and spears
We attack at dawn
The glory scene is near
From northern gods we're spawned
Defender's fighting spirit crack
Torching house of single god
We Ã¶eave land burnt black
And bodies floating in blood
War to us is holy
We sacrifice our blood
War to us is holy
We bleed for ancient Gods
Blasting forth with rage in our war eyes
We burn with hate
Cut our way through hordes of weak christian flesh
Cast them into death
War!
War to us is holy
We sacrifice our blood
War to us is holy
We bleed for ancient Gods
Burn away the false and untrue ones
We make them kneel
To the only true and powerful Gods
And then we kill
War![Intro]
Hello Monica, Gabriela, where are you?
Last night I left my mama writing this song
(Oh eh do the cheeky cheeky)
Boys were all waiting and the party was on
(Ooh eh do the sneaky sneaky)
We love to boogie and were not going to stop
(You and me feeling cheeky cheeky)
Dancing all night and now we're feeling so hot
(Ooh eh can you feel the heat, can you feel the heat tonight)
[Chorus]
Get the party on ( get the party on)
Get the party on ( get the party on)
All night long
Singing mama's song
Ooh baby hide me now my mamma has come
(Ooh eh do a sneaky sneaky)
She's gonna catch me and a smack a my bum
(Oh eh do a cheeky cheeky)
Turn up the music and my mamma will dance
(You and me feeling cheeky cheeky)
Lost in the rhythm of this cheeky romance
(Ooh eh can you feel the heat, can you feel the heat tonight
[Chorus]
Middle 8
Party party woo woo [Repeat: x 4]
Get the party on {Repeat: x 4]
[Chorus: x 2]
Get the party on[Music: Wiklund]
[Lyrics: Schulman]
And when the moon
has turned to black
Darkened clouds beneath
the astral stars
As the winds fly through
with wings so dark
A deep storming sea
with griefull past
I touch the grief, feel the pain
Taste the sorrow, before the dawn
The seagull fly in circles
over an open sea
A morning again has risen
with silver tears
At the shore of a dreadful baltic
I touch the stones as the water
echoes your name
Here I stand all alone
Themendous pain freeze inside
The sun sets slowly,
cold and silent
One day we will be united as one
I cry until dawn
My mind disappears into the dark
In a void where candles burn
Sleep forever, dream those dreamsWell, I'm going down, down, down
My mind is a wreck
My head is spinning around and around
In the funnel of love
It's such a crazy, crazy, crazy thing
I get weak in my knees
My whole head's spinning
As I go deep in the funnel of love
I tried and tried to run and hide
I even tried to run away
But you just can't hide from the tunnel of love
It's gonna get you someday
It's gonna get you someday
It's such a crazy, crazy, crazy thing
I get weak in my knees
My whole head's spinning
As I go deep in the funnel of love
Funnel of love
I'm in so deep
I tried and tried to run and hide
I even tried to run away
But you just can't hide from the funnel of love
It's gonna get you someday
It's gonna get you someday
It's gonna get you someday
It's gonna get you someday
It's gonna get you somedayMachines of hate

Ah, we're getting down tonight
It's just round the corner, tell me if you want to
Five will make you feel alrightMy soul is freezing
I fear to see another day
Another day that is filled with this emptiness
Just in darkness I can take my breath
Oh, and I think that even darkness is gone
Hell in my soul with hundreds of torturing demons
All my hope seems to be like sand
Never well-kept in my shivering hands
Never stop running down from my fingers
Alone in the dark I just howl for the moon
Bleeding heart inside me
Light of sanity is gone
I think that I am lost
No one close that could be with me
No one close that could be just me
I used to have one of nocturnal beauty
Killer of pain, the one that kissed
Kissed in the way that I could kill for
Anything, anyone; except the one
Misery, agony, dark pain is ripping my soul
Desperation, depression, all light is gone
Torment, death, reaper's blade is close
Sadness, darkness, you fill my soul with those
Cliff is close, sinister feeling
The overdose of darkness creeping
For all those demons who tear
My own soul which is filled with fear
I welter in pain, come, hold me tight
I wish the gain from touch of the night
The one that I care I'd like to return
Once more to share the warmth of the flames that burn
The darkness is tearing and ripping inside
The light of sanity is leaving my mind
I think that I will go insane
I run in night can't stay in light of day
Is this my final destiny
To cross the river of death
Through the bridge that mortal walks just once
Just once, just once, .. no moreThey've known all along
Since the first time they dropped the bomb
They saw the power
Everyone knew it was time to stop
But they could not
Well I've seen the sign
I know it's time
To shed a tear
To draw the line
But they can't stop now 'cause it's too late
The end is near and they can't wait
Balance of power
Balance of terror
We're in this too deep
To correct our error
A communist plan, it's all a plot
And you're a part of it if you think your not
We had an hour, now we've got a minute
You can't hide now, we're all in it.
Balance of power
Balance of terror
We're in this too deep
To correct our errorWhen I
I push it away
This is not what you wanted
I keep on pushing away
Without you
Sometimes I feel, sometimes I don't, this time I'm lost inside
I guess I could have tried
This time I crossed the line
To end this journey you must disengage
And let these dreams subside
A song never leads me,
Only the words I have spoken of
Have meaning
And I will deliver you to those
Free of emotions, take me
When I
I push it away
This is not what you wanted
I keep on pushing away
Without you
Sometimes I feel, sometimes I don't, this time I'm lost inside
I guess I could have tried
This time I crossed the line
To end this journey you must disengage
And let these dreams subside
A song never leads me,
Only the words I have spoken of
Have meaning
And I will deliver you to those
Free of emotions, take me
A song never leads me
Only the words I have spoken of
Have meaning
And I will deliver you to those
Free of emotions, take me (take me!)
Don't try!
A song never leads me
Only the words I have spoken of
Have meaning
And I will deliver you to those
Free of emotions, take me (take me!)Jos uvek ja secam se, tih godina lutasmo bezbrizno mi
Pod zvezdama iz sazvezdja nase mladosti.
I secam se osmeha tvog, ociju tugu sto odase ti,
I tvojih reci pred put bez povratka...
Drugovi odlazim, dobro pamtite ono sto see you reci sad,
Zivot je kao predivan san, brzo se prekine.
Novembar, iznad nas kisni oblaci sazvezdje prekrili,
Necujno, jedna zvezda je svoj kratak san odsanjala...
Sve bajke sad daleke su,
Svi snovi prazni sad postali su,
Neka tisina se davno uvukla you nas.
I mozda nas gledas sad ti,
Mozda se smejes sa zvezdama svim,
Vidim ti oci-zvezdani sjaj bez granica.
Bili smo drugovi, iste snove smo brzbrizno sanjali,
Leteli na krilima vecnosti do sazvezdja.
Slutili nismo mi da ces vecno you sazvezdju ostati,
Neka te nase zvezde sad cuvaju tu umesto nas...
Vecni sjaj nek dosegne sve delove svemira,
Jedan tren nek zastane sve.
Do sazvezdja tada mladosti jedne nek cuje se glas...
"Molim te sacuvaj mesto za nas!"how long can things go on like this
i hunger and am left hungry
so greedy have i become
i must steal your lips to get a cheap kiss
i want to feel some of this
i need to know some of this
and i ache to breath your fire
your joy, your madness, and your pain
for i am only animal
flesh and bone and sex
and i have been faithful for so long
i don't know how much more that i can take this
i want to feel some of this
i need to be some of this
and i ache to breath your fire
your joy, your madness, and your pain[Instrumental]From the museum of sleep
Unliving eyes see death's subtle jest
In my sorrow they mourn the past
Yet celebrate their eternal rest
Relieving the worlds pain
In a church of misery
Dampening the lantern flame
Upon your bended knee
Painted skulls
Painted skulls
Warm and close the air runs hard
Around the loyal gravesite
Wailing moon in a putrid sky
Hungry and eager tonight
Our cries pierce their world
An invocation to mourn
Celebration, fete for fate
Of unearthly dead souls reborn
Like a slime trail of a slug
Transgress to the husk
Unburied souls in restful bliss
Bursting forth from crust
Stale the stench of arising souls
In ritual macabre
Drag you down infuse your mind
By blade or poisoned barb
Painted skulls
Painted skulls
The festival end now they sleep
Shrouds of pain another year
Return to their boneyard
We surviving ones await in fear
Mourning unsurpassed
To the bitter end
Broken dreams and broken lies
Painted skulls, the children cryChainsaw caesarean - raped by a priest.
You are - the - chosen one, - chainsaw caesarean.
Give a life - to - force control, - to exploit your way of thinking.
People have to die - harmless, - this is the myth of your religion.
We - are not - the same - mind.
Sterile stainless razorblade - cut's into fearless cranium.
Little child - ignorant mind, laborious, undefiled.
Fertile blood drips from the carved carmine holy cross.
Everlasting mark, carnal on the skull to be.
In-breeding act of guilt. Faith of mankind!
Malignancy built on fascistic sights. Blamed by divine!
Fed up with the scepticism of others, Hypocrisy!
to slaughter the consumed as on demand. Obliterated!
Sterile stainless razorblade - cut's into fearless cranium.
Little child - ignorant mind, laborious, undefiled.
Fertile blood drips from the carved carmine holy cross.
Everlasting mark, carnal on the skull to be.
Suppurated crucifixion.
Suppurated crucifixion.
Suppurated crucifixion.
Obliterated is the common sense!
Damned!!!
Born by a fiercely in-breeding act of guilt.
Vertebrate malignant with concealed fascistic sights.
Being fed up with the other brainless scepticism.
And slaughters the consumed as on virtuous demand.
Rattle brained, Regurgitation of the sallow.
Rattle brained, you thought that we would worship your cross!
Rattle brained, you are the chainsaw caesarean.
Rattle brained, - stench - combined the rite.Embrace me, oh darkness
With our !lithest veil
Blind my eyes so that I see nothing yet all I see
Fertilize my visions of the New Age
Teach me the art of reaping
the seeds of depression
Born through the mourning of Man
He will give birth to the Pillorian Age
Sharpen my spears for the conquest...Fragments of fear
A bombcrash before me
Whispering of lust
As blind as always
A prayer so vast
The reek of fortune
Is thicker than blood
Born in vain
[Mor:]
Captured in life
Blank my memory
Erased is my past
Nowhere I am standing
Nowhere to rest
Times without a number
I have been pleading for being
Left in silence
[Bid:]
Impression of impurity
The thrill to kill grows stronger
Forever in your mind
An insane thought keeps burning
Your sanctuary brings the seas to part
It is sincerely what rules our fears(chorus)
I swore, never to die alone
And if it's on, it's on
Get the dirty chrome
I swore, I don't care if he left in his zone
Don't make have to follow you home
(fiend)
I done ran in the streets enough to know, every man and jebro
And when your back against the fence, admit to every throw
Let off several hollow, in case somebody follow
And keep in mind your the only one that need to see tomorrow
Stash dirties on the borrow, shake it off up in the sorrows
And watch the quiet nights cause that's only when then the war rose
Yabegorro, and put the smoke straight up to my nose
Cause I'm 'bout to unload that shit, to actually go do vargos
No one knows I chose not to hurt nobody
But it was him and me, and I cho', I chose to get rowdy
Took, he was breathing through and he was also seein' through
Last but not least, I even took what made him a human being too
(chorus 2x)
(fiend)
Oh we got problems, I bring the return of Mr. Keyser Soze
Load the revolver, it's a walk-by, if it's your way
Aint no way in hell, at this public disputin'
He gonna make it through, this relentless shootin'
So I made a fact to get 'em, watch how the choppers split 'em
Gon' let the gat hit 'em, even at a catechism
I ain't missin' go make 'em my mission the dope player
Shoot 'em through the door way, layin' 'em in the court way
No man will say he ran down a timid nigga
Should ask him make 'em what happens, with no limit niggas
All I figure for me to make it through these three doors
It had to be my life or yours and I ain't ready to go, I sworeLike a hand of paper leaves
Stained from all the promises
That you never kept
All these dreams intensifying
That we dream
When will they come to something real?
But you go away
And you never stay
All these bitter years
That you leave me with
All these dreams intensifying
That we dream
When will they come to something real?Guardian angels are working for me
The devil and the deep blue sea
I beat my heart and bend all trees
By the end of the year I'm on my knees
Such a precious little dream
Can make a face behind a scream
One or three holes in a broken stone
Through gardens long since overgrown
All that filled my ears with pain
Your dirty looks beat me up again
A lustfull view makes my eye explode
My heart went dead and I fell in the roadIn the never-ending circle
Where the powerless meet
There grows a struggle from the burden
Of sustaining defeat
In the face of every coward
Lies the blindest of hate
And in the eyes of a sharpened image of the damage they made
You look at me to bear the burden of the suffering past
It wasn't me behind the veil of a heartless mask
And where were you the day that everybody cursed your name?
You were the distant voice of pride
That never stood the shame
The weak of the mind will use fist
And the fist of the frail will bring gun
The loudest of guns provoke bombs
And in wrath he will chase until it's done
Your history is dead
Dead wrong
Dead, dead wrong
Philosophy is wrong
Dead wrong
Dead, dead wrong
Within the mind of modern culture
There's an idle cog
It is the section of humanity that never forgot
And in the midst of moving foward we have given the right
To let the wolves attack the sheep and bury guilt inside
I won't forget the twisted picture of the filth that we were
Or disregard the faded voices of the people we hurt
But I was never pulling triggers or degrading your face
Don't look at me to give the reason for the pain that you trace
Your history is dead
Dead wrong
Dead, dead wrong
Philosophy is wrong
Dead wrong
Dead, dead wrong
The scars outlive the pain
Reflections will remain
The scars outlive the pain
Your sickness will remain
Dead, dead wrongThe body of the night is the ugliness
Full of waiting
It's the unknown
In which Devil found
The source of my fear
I'm in the middle of this night
Enveloped in sickness
I'm in it
I'm in the middle of eternal flame
And it's priestess invites
She's unknown
An introduction and the end
Kneeling against her
I don't kneel but words
Crying against her
Tears are abnormal
Capable to provoke a storm
With my unbelief
Only the fire and the water
The Unknown God is eternal
The body of the night is the ugliness
Full of waiting
It's unknown
Everyone of you is in this night
And everyone looks for his own god
And everyone cries:
Unsaint shouts
Spat the sky
Unsaint shouts
Spat to God[Chapter one]
Analyze the devices
War with thee
Pieces of your destiny corrupted
Rise
Thriving
Can you verify the lost contents?
[Chapter two ]
The gravel lodged in your throat
A flesh box cavity
Gradual eruption probe
One that feeds
Hands that caress a crooked spine
Absorbing bi-products
Prompt exchanges
That will deconstruct
[Chapter three]
Move on forward
Signs that will pierce like labor pains
Sharp
Ways of a drunkard
The dogs shall devour and lap up their blood stains
[Chapter four ]
Persist
The prime suspects will now restrain
With affection
Recession
Final effects of a broken hope
Of a broken shell
Of a broken yoke
Walk and learn from these
Deviant
Loss of wealth
Subservient
Quarantine the divisions
The double edged sword depth incision
[Chapter five ]
Glutten eat your fill
Divination is that of a swine babbling in their filth
Beware of the things hybernating in your skull
Reaking havoc
Malignant cells still active
Schemes that will inflict my son
Schemes that run rampant
[Chapter six]
If the disease of the self
Leaves a heavy burden on your spirit
It must be removed
Like bricks in the belly
You will sink into the depthsKiss the blood
On my lips
Kill the blood
On my eyes
Kill the God!
Let the moonlight
Bring back the existence
Of the missing ones
Their breath
In black despair shall unite
Blasphemous dreams
Illusion of sin
Bow
In the darkness
Kiss the blood
On my eyes
The demon's horus
Have rumbled
The winds
Have possessed the faithful ones
The prayers
Spilled in blood
Scream
Pagan son
Darkness calls
Three black roses
In hair of the wind
In hair of the wind
They are
The sign
Of the death
Of the hidden goddess
They are
In silence of the night
I am with them
Sons of the fire
Sons of the wind
Awake your bodies
Of Demigods
Demons
Dance of the verges
On the triangles...After the smoke clears
And the flames subside
(we have been forsaken)
Subside
A thousand eyes were upon me
Soulless, and without mind
(we have been forsaken)
Will there never
Will there never
Will there never be an end
If I could be forgiven
Every breath would be a prayer
(we are not forgiven)
Will there never
Will there never
Will there never be an end
I have tread, and spanned the horizon
I've seen this world, the beauty in decay
I strike down the faceless and unknown
I feel blessed, for I can see
The stars look down on me
Stars look down on me
Stars look down on me
Stars look down on me
Will there never
Will there never
Will there never be an end
Will there never be an end
Will there never be an end
Will there never be an end
Stars look down on me
Stars look down on me
Stars look down on me
Stars look down on meThere's not a day that passes by
The pain has not amassed inside
It's breaking me down to the ground
It's like I crashed and died
It's hard to leave your past behind
Especially when you're last in line
And half the time it acts like vines
And wraps inside my fragile mind
Hiding in plain view it seems
The same old shit I choose between
Taking who I used to be
And keep it subdued beneath
Close to dead and losing me
You took a chance and you believed
So did I, I let you lead
And grabbed the line you threw to me
You saved me, you made me
And through it all you changed me forever
You love me, you hate me
And through it all you changed me forever
You've given me a chance to change
Helped me in ways I can't explain
I'll never understand the way
You took my hand with no dismay
Now I'm who I am today
And that's the man I plan to stay
But can't escape, I can't evade
You stranded me and ran away
Why'd you do it why'd you leave
Why'd you help me find my feet
Why'd you guide me blindingly
Then turn and say goodbye to me
All this time I tried to be
The person you applied to me
This lie you feed that I'd succeed
Is why I'm me, a dying breed
You saved me, you made me
And through it all you changed me forever
You love me, you hate me
And through it all you changed me forever
Through it all you changed me
I'm not the same me
For better or for worse this person that you made me
Through it all you changed me
I'm not the same me
For better or for worse you changed me forever
It's killing me down deep within
It makes me strain to breath again
All this pain I keep it in
If it's the end where'd we begin
It's so hard to comprehend
Where we are is where we end
Let's make believe let's just pretend
You don't hate me and want me dead
What you said stays in my head
An unrelenting discontent
It torments me to no extent
Entrenches me just like cement
It makes no sense what your intent
Bled for me then fled instead
You never meant to be content
Fuck the words let's just be friends
You saved me, you made me
And through it all you changed me forever
You love me, you hate me
And through it all you changed me forever
Through it all you changed me
I'm not the same me
For better or for worse this person that you made me
Through it all you changed me
I'm not the same me
For better or for worse you changed me forever
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Through it all you changed me
I'm not the same me
For better or for worse this person that you made me
Through it all you changed me
I'm not the same me
For better or for worse you changed me foreverI can't tell you anything you don't already know
And I'm really not the type to say, "I told you so."
But accidents can always happen, death is always near
So if you drive to hell and back, don't let the devil steer
You may think it's strange that you are living your own death
So before you go under, you'd better take a deep breath
You can only have on shot at life, don't swing and miss
Don't put too much trust in anyone, and remember this
Underneath the surface, it's much worse than it seems
And I can tell you, brother, life ain't just a dream
Underneath the surface, you won't have much to say
And I can tell you, brother, it's cold inside your grave
I could tell you all exactly what you want to hear
You're all gonna live forever, nothing more to fear
But I don't want to live forever, i'll leave that to you
I just want to live until there's nothing else to do
Underneath the surface, buried for eternity
And I hate to think about just how long that could be
Underneath the surface, planted, but you will not grow
No roots, no leaves, no seeds of life. Guess that just goes to show
Underneath the surface, it's much worse than it seems
And I can tell you, brother, life ain't just a dream
Underneath the surface, you won't have much to say
And I can tell you, brother, it's cold inside your grave
Everything you really need is right in front of you
Take a big bite out of life, but don't forget to chew
You can only have one shot at life, don't swing and miss
Don't put too much trust in anyone, and remember this
Underneath the surface, we all go insaneSanity walks the razors edge, unconsciously
Questioning the shadows, calling me
Listen to the voices of my past
I'm screaming, free falling here I stand
Reality slits the riffs of time now ticking true
Reflections of yourself, I laugh at you
Pushing me I'm slipping off the ledge
I'm screaming, I'm falling, here I am
I'm dreaming, falling, where I am
Behind the mask, my faces of delusion
Behind the mask, I can't separate confusion
Behind the mask, it's my paranoid delusions
Behind the mask, who is behind the mask?
Look through these eyes
See all my faces their hiding behind
Here by my side
Those who I trust turn against and divide me
So near but always beyond me
So clear their calling me back
Behind the mask!Visions from the altar
Ripping through your soul
Seeing through the master's eyes
Young flesh the goal
Brutal rampage
Destroy the house of Christ
Obey your master
Another victim violently dies
Head torn off
A trophy raised to the sky
Bloody priest
Dies in pain
Stomach chewed open
Lying on the grave
As you bathe in the piss
Your master rains upon your face
Hear the calling from the abyss
Pagan destroyer crushes your raceBastard, bastard, a purple haze is all is see. Boiling blood. Foam at your
mouth, your eyes turn away. Boiling blood. I'm a voodoo child and I just
finished this little puppet. The spitting image of you. I'm gonna torture this
little creature. Pathetic lookalike of a loser that's you. Stick needles and
pins in it's spine now you're lame. Saw off your legs and suck out your
brains. Bastard, bastard, a purple haze is all is see. Boiling blood. Foam at
your mouth, your eyes turn away. Boiling blood. In my veins, boiling blood.
Through my brains, boiling blood. Stabbing victims, boiling blood. Draining
bodies, boiling blood. Boiling blood.
Bastard, bastard, a purple haze is all is see. Boiling blood. Foam at your
mouth, your eyes turn away. Boiling blood.[Oria: Candice Night]

The things that happen to you now can't be helped

Move hot-rod, move me on down the the line.Is it real? The visions I see and feel or imagination running wild?
Is it illusion? Predictions of thoughts concealed
Come with me, take my hand, see what I've seen
Area 51 the secrets you keep they ever be told?
Area 51 where is the proof that our leaders withhold?
Should I believe? Or pack all my things and leave
my powerful doubt burns a hole in my mind
is it confusion, predictions of thoughts concealed
Come with me, take my hand, see what I've seen
Area 51 the secrets you keep they ever be told?
Area 51 where is the proof that our leaders withhold?
Why do the cover up? You should see what I've seen
Show me the answers to the questions within my heart
or are you in fear of the truth I might find?
Behind your walls seer of things concealed
Come with me, take my hand, see what I've seen
Area 51 the secrets you keep they ever be told?
Area 51 where is the proof that our leaders withhold?Everybody's lookin' for somethin'
Somethin' to fill in the holes
We think a lot but don't talk much about it
Till things get out of control
How do I know when it's love
I can't tell you but it lasts forever
How does it feel when it's love
It's just something you feel together
When it's love
You look at every face in a crowd
Some shine and some keep you guessin'
Waiting for someone to come into focus
Teach you your final love lesson
How do I know when it's love
I can't tell you but it lasts forever
How does it feel when it's love
It's just something you feel together
When it's love
You can feel it yeah
Nothing's missing
Yeah
Nothing's missing
How do I know when it's love,
I can't tell you but it lasts forever
How does it feel when it's love
I can't tell you but it lasts forever
When it's love
When it's love
It'll last forever
When it's love
You and I
We're gonna feel this thing together
When it's love
When it's love
You can feel it
We'll make it last forever
When it's loveIn my life I made a choice
To be what I have to be
But when I am to see myself in the mirror
I can't contain my pain
It looks me right in the eye
The secrets that I hide
Mean that in no one I can confide
I chose this life and fall to secrecy
But in the end it turns on me
The longest day of my life
This is the longest day of my life
It's time to pick up the pieces
And build it back together
When I was young I saw my best friends die
I'm not gonna let you go
I'll be by your side forever
In my life I broke a promise
I said I will always be there
I'm coming to find you to bring you back
This pain that I try to hide
Because I play your whole lie cannot defy
This time I'll change
I'll do things differently
I'll never let you go
Protect you with my life
This is the longest day of my life
It's time to pick up the pieces
And build it back together
When I was young I saw my best friends die
I'm not gonna let you go
I'll be by your side forever
Countless times they say I crossed the line
But ask me how many lives I saved in time
Innocents don't have to die
Not in my war
Not on my time
I'll do what I have to do until I die
This is my last day before I walk away
I'm coming to take your beautiful love
We'll be folly again
So you question my decisions now
Let me ask you how you'll feel
If all that mattered to you was so suddenly ripped away
Would you fight for it
Would you cross the line
Or would you let them slip away
I did my life
This is my last day before I walk away
I'm coming to take your beautiful love
We'll be folly again
And a day will come
When the warriors standing
Will be you and me
And that day has come
I'ts all they sing of
The final day for me is here
The final day is here
This is the longest day of my life
It's time to pick up the pieces
And build it back together
When I was young I saw my best friends die
I'm not gonna let you go
I'll be by your side forever
This is the longest day
It's time to pick up the pieces
And build it back together
This is the longest day
It's time to pick up the pieces
And build it back together
Picking up the piecesYeah I yes..I I love you
I know I hurt you so
I'm empty and cold
black shone like gold that night
so I lost myself againIt was here I was born
While the stars held their breaths
After ages of pseudo-presence
I climbed the final steps
Up from deep beneath the shores
Eieth no longer sleeping gal
Thus alive and the stillness
Only to be broken by whispers
Towards the moon
Bloodred from the Unborn Ones cries
That will not be silenced or rest
Forever more and awaken not
To paint in blanks or wither
Beauty blinding no more
than the whole is less now
We see clearly what was not there
The prey become predator
Slaughtering not raging blindly
Through tunnels of sorrow and lust
For solitude and peace of mind
Says it is time to unmask and face
Behind lines - that is Enemy IStrainule ce bati la poarta de unde vii si cine esti?
Strainule de lumea noastra, raspunde-ne de unde vii,
Prin care lumi traisi cosmarul nepovestitelor povesti
Si-n care stea gasisi culoarea decoloratei nebunii?
"De unde vin? De unde pot veni, cind ochii-mi
plini de regrete si tristeti par 2 candele-aprinse
in cripta mortilor poeti?"
Priviti sint gol, caci calea-mi fuse-atit de lunga
Si-n calea mea-ntilnii pe rind pe toti
Citi vrura sa va vinda podoabe noi ce nu se vind
Pe cei ce vrura sa va-ndrume spre mai bine
Spre-acel indepartat intrezarit
In armoniile eterne dintr-un sfirsit si-un infinit.
"De unde vin? Eu vin din lumea creata dincolo de zare
Din lumea-n care n-a fost nimeni din voi"
Deschideti poarta dar, veniti in jurul meu degraba
Porniti cu mine-mpreuna spre lumea-n care nu-s
castele cu punti si santuri feudale
Nici ruginite porti de-arama la care bat cei noi sositi
Veniti cu toti cit mai e vreme si mai puteti cinta!
Veniti, sa V-aprind in suflet lumina stinselor faclii
Si-n versuri fantasmagoria si vraja noilor magii
Iar cinturile voastre cu care azi cersiti o piine
Sa le cunun cu stralucirea aurorelor de miine
Dar poarta a ramas inchisa la glasul artei viitoare!I don't live to rise again
To reborn and never end
Once I'm on the other side
I'll see if it was the end of my ride
I don't live to transform
Present into past
Or fall into a lifeless pattern
Going nowhere fast
Master I will always be
Of all that is of me
But I can't ever touch
What is of thee
I question things to see
If they are what they're said to be
I ask the why and wherefore
I reap the fruits of time but I let it take it's course
But where no-one can answer me
Where nobody'll ever know
That is where my path begins
That is where I go
Human flesh, human blood
But in your words I'm nothing but godOne thousand hands
Pull you down into dark waters
Victimized
Time of life on earth expired
Coldly served the vengeance damning
Murder in the first degree
Fodder for the oaken box so lined with velvet tapestry
Descent imminent bladder and bowels into pants spent
The glow is waning in your eyes
What's coming next is no surprise
Death phlegm rattles
Terrible the choking swansong
Rapid decline
When old age brings burdens cumbersome
Cruelly dealt the sickness growing
Malignancies triumphantly
Destroyed you from the inside out
Begging for death insistently
Into the ever black
From where there's no coming back
Six feet below the earth rotting food for the fetid worms
Into the harrowed grave
Your mortal soul cannot be saved
Into the nether realm
Dead as slate and cold as hell
Rest in festering slime here burns the souls of a thousand generations
Join the club
Funereality
Headstones towering above
S'far as the eye can see
Condemned to hell so morbidly
My friend you'll never see
Lost forever in between
In revenance you've been deceived
What you have prayed for shall not be
Your hollow cries he has denied
Your weak religion dies
With thee a feeble cross insignia of fabled gods
You'll haunt a landscape draped in grey
Deceased and meant to be
To push the daisies up eternally your name is here in stone
Into the ever black
From where there's no coming back
Six feet below the earth, rotting food for the fetid worms
Into the harrowed grave
Your mortal soul cannot be saved
Into the nether realm
Dead as slate and cold as hellCommunication breakdown, fall on your knees
Overloaded system blood will now freeze
My generators working hard, overheats
Twenty tons of hardware, flooding the streets
You're glorious, you didn't fool me with mysteries
You've lost your pride, but you keep on singing same old song again, yeah
Don't wanna wait till tomorrow for a reaction of time
Sophisticated people, we're all burning inside
It's time to burn all the bridges and tear down the walls
In the end you are freedom, can you hear the calls?
You could dance the night away
Sons of bitches will betray
Forget tomorrow - today you have to prayBurry your fears, nothing is real
Listen to the voice, comes from beyond
Fear is the enemy, remember you are
Nothing to learn, there is nothing to learn
Don't want to live, but don't want to die
Don't think but know, no punish from God
No more religions, we are the one
Here is no hell, there is no GodCrying. The anger and sorrow in your eyes is shining
thru your disguise, you can not hide all youer lies!
Falling. The abyss you enter is so deep, it doesn't
matter how much you will weep, you will never reach
the ground again. You're draining your emotions,
the poison is your God. Injection for depression. The
needle is your rod. Your heart will never feel. The
love that it will steal.
Chorus: NEXT TIME YOU SEE THE STARS ALIGHT,
LIKE DIAMONDS IN THE WINTER NIGHT. DO THINK
OF ME, REMEMBER ME. SO READS MY ELEGY. NEXT TIME I
SEE THE STARS SHINE BRIGHT LIKE WHITE EYES IN THE
DARKENED LIGHT, I'M FREE NO CHAINS ARE HOLDING ME.
BUT STILL I LIVE BY YOUR ELEGY.
Leaving. The world I leave will never know. But below
you will see my glow and the fire shall be eternal.
Weeping. The tears you cry, I know the taste. Can't
you see they're such a waste. You can never bring
me back again. You'll never know what happened but I
couldn't go on. It felt like I was running a race
that no man ever won. My soul will always love the
ones I am far above...
(Chorus)
Tears are falling... Tears are falling in the dark.
Your fears are calling. I've left my mark.
Burning. The flames that rise will be my end. So on for
now I will pretend that I am back on earth again.
Lonely. The shadows haunt me as I burn. Now I know
there is no return. My soul will slowly turn to dust.
I'm passing thru dimensions where noone's ever been.
I'm heading for the secrets that no man's ever seen.
What lies below will I ever know??(!?)
(Chorus)I open my eyes another day is here
The sun's already high
Can not recall just what I was dreamin'
But I'm sure I can catch the reprise somehow
Piles of dirty socks just everywhere
I don't feel like washing up today
Somehow I really just don't care
I think I'll stay in bed all day
This is one of those days when I'll do just not a thing
Lazing 'til the hour's late then maybe I'll sleep just a little wink
I know that breakfast can wait until later
I don't have anything but the dish in the kitchen
Nothing to read nothing's on the TV
Everyone's on vacation can't say that I miss 'emIf I was brave I'd shut my mouth
Put an end to our fights
I'd jump into a neon light
Taste the concrete and break my bones
I could be born again
As one of your lucky strikes
If I wouldn't fuck up my
mind from time to time...
Constantly, I would drive myself insane
I was always the December girl
I never noticed them at all
I slept through the summer
And was drunk through the fall
I am beautiful in the dark
Everyone can be beautiful
in the spotlight
From far below
All the praise falls to the floor
I stand empty handed
waiting for a little moreHis eyes are fiery
The flame burns within
He wreaks of murder
His mind filled with sin
The sickening stench
Of blood on his breath
This villainous beast
This angel of death
They hear the noise
The people in the town
They cringe in fear
Frightened by the sound
A sacrifice is required to live
Must choose a girl
In which they must give
Victim is falling
Many died without a sound
Victims crawling
Bodies laying all around
He once was a clergy man
Swore to bring peace to lands
Lustful doings not foreseen
He blames it on Satan's screams
His mind is twisted
Schizophrenic freak
Once in his presence
Demons dare not speak
His piece of meat
Must be young and fresh
He loves to feast
Upon her tender flesh
Now he has risen
Holy powers fell
Anti religion
Mercenary from hell
The town has fallen
Southeast of Wales
In this backwards legend
The evil priest prevails
Men were slaughtered left and right
Virgins couldn't sleep at night
Raping many, victims fell
This evil priest was born in hell !!!Open the cap fill up the batteries
Play the game of your life
It's starting to shake
It's ready for you to control
Your flesh starts to sweat
The feeling you need to let go
Just do your thing lose all
the tension and flow
Powertool forever young
forever, forever young
Powertool when we're in bloom
when we're in bloom
Feeling the one handed love
As the best you've ever had
Wiping your mouth and getting
Ready to start again
When your body is shaking
And your sight turns black
You will know that you've found me
The mighty powertool
Powertool forever young
forever, forever young
Powertool when we're in bloom
when we're in bloomWe are the Fall
Northern white crap that talks back
We are not black. Tall.
No boxes for us.
Do not fuck us.
We are frigid stars.
We were spitting, we were snapping "Cop Out, Cop Out!"
As if from heaven.
Sucker
Sucker
Sucker
Sucker
Sucker
Sucker
Sucker
Sucker
Sucker
No stars in the zone
I stay at home
I live on snacks
Potatoes in packs
I like to blow
I like to blow
I like to blow
Concentration zone
The years go in circles,
The years go in circles
Hopes goes, I'm gone
Smoke comes, I go
A spurs fan, a warrior,
Happy no-hoper
Dull, manage,
I think slow.
Sucker, blow.When shadows grow longer
and the sun sets for the forthcoming night;
our sorrow is stronger
as darkness and death are now near by our side.
Many a sun will set and tears of grief will be shed...On the mysterious planet
Called Hyperion
There is a strange divinity
It's made of steel and razors
And nobody knows
From where it came or what it is
Great is the power hidden
In the Tombs of Time
And it is under its control
To one of seven pilgrims
It will grant a wish
But all the others it will kill
[Bridge:]
Salvation or damnation it gives
To those who dare
To stand before it
What will be?
[Chorus:]
Mighty Razorblade God
It's an invincible force
Time is right in its hand
The waves of time
It commands
It is the mighty
It is the one
What is the secret
Lying behind its mask
Eyes red and burning
Fire inside
The deadly beauty
Of the killing desire
[Chorus]From a distance I watch you two. All my
thoughts and fears have come true. How
long has this clever disguise slipped past
my eyes? Blood fills my mind. KILL!
KILL! KILL! KILL! Angers building
up inside. As I walk away, my evil
thoughts return.
Take away their lives, my conscience
screams.
Fuck no! I never believed in killing for
revenge!
Feel that tugging pain inside?
GET OUT OF MY HEAD! ARE YOU
FUCKING INSANE?!
Clearing my mind of what Ive seen, but
the vision is still so clear. Inside I scream,
What should I do?
You love the taste of blood dont you?
LEAVE ME ALONE! I LOVE THOSE
TWO! Let me scream!
You know you want to.
With all these thoughts racing through my
mind, I still find the time to follow you.
Did you think that you could hide this
forever?
The luscious taste begins to return to me.
Its so hard to resist So hard to ignore.
When your hand touches her face, my perception
of you is changed. My body begins
to shake. Have you ever felt rage?
Theres a voice whispering to me. Its so
faint, yet so calming. Think slower, go
back home.
Step by step I start to feel at peace,
redeeming my tranquillity, but in my head
I see his face again.
With all these thoughts racing through my
mind, I still find the time to follow you.
Did you think that you could hide this
forever?
The luscious taste begins to return to me.
Its so hard to resist So hard to ignore.
When your hand touches her face, my perception
of you is changed. My body begins
to shake. Have you ever felt rage?
And as I scream inside, I run home. My
brother is close.I know this much
I cant stand me
when I become him
I know this much
I dont feel free
when Im repentant
tell him this much
you dont want him
due to extra skin
tell him this much
you forsake him
due to pretension
now we have everything we need
to come up to where youre pristine
we believe
tell him this much
you cant withstand
taking it upright
tell him this much
you felt dirty
because it was tight
I know this much
that old feeling
Im done hanging on
I know this much
stop pretending
what was had is gone
now we have everything we need
to come up to where you are seen

Hold out the other cheek
This is the most important message
That someone left to humanity
Then you came with your holy book
Then you spread this holy gift
Bible in one hand, a sword in the other
To slay all people thinking different
Holy man, I reny your church
Too many slaughters've been done
Holy man, I won't pray for your god
For he let you kill in his name
Remember this innocent people
Devoured by flames for being different
In these dark times of heresy
When devil was every woman
Remember this dirty unbelievers
They died by their brothers' swords
Covered with crusades blood
Murdered for the holy cause
Holy man, I reny your church
Too many slaughters've been done
Holy man, I won't pray for your god
For he let you kill in his name
Hypocrit priest of hate
You forgot what you exist for
In your mouth, love means death for anyone
But the sheep that follows your insane path
Let us think by ourselves
We don't need your misleading talk
Let us remember what love means
Centuries of lies made us forget
Holy man, I reny your church
Too many slaughters've been done
Holy man, I won't pray for your god
For he let you kill in his nameLooking at the road we paved,
I try to think how good will be our way.
The future is not,
What it used to be.
And we just say goodbye to the past.
Ve've travelled the times, in search of
the answers.
And still we hang around
Like dog without a bone...
The times are here,
The call is near,
It's time to choose, to do,
Or die !!!
The chaos sings a melody,
And they sing along...
They stand to fall, in a dance
of madness.
Enslaved to the rythm...
They stand to fall !
Driven by the song !
They stand to fall !
Chained by this sound !
The chaos sings a melody,
Until we end, its song !!!Born under the banner of valour
Defending their land sword in hand
They will die as proud warriors
And will be welcome as kings in Valhalla
Savagery and genius of war
The victory's already written
Corpses lying on the battlefield
Odin's children meet Death in honour
Odhal forever standing on their property
The runes' power will protect them endlessly
We are them
We, the soldiers of Wotan
We spread terror and spill blood
By Mjollnir we will crush weakness
Thus will begin our reignMusic: Dahl, Kaupamaa - Lyrics: Andreas Gtesson
On a cold winternight with the moon ablaze
We where gathered around the fireplace
Silent we sat with our foaming ales
Respectfully waiting for the old man's tale
With a final draw on his ivory pipe
The old man raised his voice , and began
As his voice raised and sank in the strangest rhyme
We drifted away to worlds of ancient times
By his words we where able to see through his eyes
Into places beyond where dragons still flies
Chorus:
Forgotten realms , mysterious lands
When childhood dreams are close at hand
With mythical beasts and lustrous elfs
Those magical worlds reveal themselves
Solo: Dahl - Jukka - Both - Dahl - Jukka
And when the story ended we felt hollow yet glad
The return to the grey reality made us all a bit sad
But I could see the faith in everyones eyes
That somewhere , there are worlds where dragons fly
And this strange night in late december
Will stay in my mind , and I'll , remember
Chorus:(Her) Nights spent succumbing
to the brilliance of Blackeyes,
feeling the warm embrace of your hand,
memories like salt on a wound,
dominate my new found spirit land.
Seeking wisdom in the darkness hovering helplessly
around our pain crying with absence of real tears,
like a child born in vein.
I can no longer bear to watch you cradling my form.
Wrenching out bloody drops of desperation's futile storm.
Welcome to the Willothewisp my love. Deaths arduous game.
Mocking times insanity foreshadowing years of reign.
Male:
Oh my perfect princess, hard and cold as stone.
I shall trace your lips with crimson. I'll protect you;
they can't have you to bury, to leave me.
Slay all who dare touch my pretty doll,
it will be bloody paradise, a misanthropes ball.
Female:
I hear you and beseech you, find a way to understand.
Kill them for my body and be left with grains of sand.
Do not waste your life in vain,
protecting that which feels happiness nor pain.
Willothewisp my love, is forever now what be.
Willothewisp my darkened darling can not be taken away from thee.
Male:
I feel your essence all around me,
and see you dead on our floor.
Realize it would kill me to see you
dragged out like a rotting whore.
The dead are not theirs to take,
fuck their reality.I seek revenge.
Fuck their stupidity, your death will be avenged.
My princess is not their dead slave,
to tear apart and fit inside a holy lonesome grave.
Female:
Ahh! You torment me with endless worry.
A doll is what is left of me, to kill it, insanity!
Wake up live your life. Do not waste it in my name.
Male:
No! Why? Your body comforts me. Please understand.
It is a Willothewisp my love, but at least I would have command.
Help! Help! Ahh!
I can not take this, my heart was black to all but you,
and now you're dead. I need you in any form.
I want you. Separation is what permeates the fear of death.
Ahh! Ahh! Come back!
Female:
My essence is always with you.
Hovering over you and what was I
of my love and perfect self,
I never meant to die.
It's all right, do as you wish.
I want my body to be with you.
Male:
I see them coming, my pulse quickens, my long blade smiles.
Get away from her! Bastards, pawns!
Die, you are worth nothing, Die!!!
They are dead as well, now bags of worthless flesh.
How dare they try and take you, Ha! Ha! Ha! We are free together.
Female:
You shiver like a broken child before me,
clutching my cold hand wet with tears,
you kiss my hand and lips, and I feel nothing.
Male:
A presence looms about me, whispering like morning dew.
My perfect death doll princess, I stay here forever with you.
Female:
He has won my body, but now he is insane.
I reach out to dry his tears,
only to find I am like wind to rain.
Both:
Willothewisp is torture, deaths arguous game.
Willothewisp is hidden boundaries, foreshadowing years of pain.Nobody has come to see you there
But you're so proud you don't see that
Everything you'll do this afternoon
Will lead us to the emptiness
Surrender to this double dealing
You'll never walk alone into the eyes of the night
Remember I got you on my mind
And you're so far from home
When it all comes down to the line
You will just feel the pain
A million network slaves
Trying to break away
From running with the pack that you betray
See, what's ruling our lives
Inside my head i feel the fear is rising on
Every minute
I'm getting weaker while into the jungle
they grow strong, they grow...
What is there for me you can't understand
Gotta get my song, I can't go wrong
Leaving you alone, lay by my side
Look into the dream, so I realize
Step on those who put you on your throne
All you care about's to get your score
Raging by myself I just can scream
But still my eyes can see
When it all comes down to the line
You will just feel the pain
A million network slaves
Trying to break away
From running with the pack that you betray
See, what's ruling our lives
Inside my head i feel the fear is rising on
Every minute
I'm getting weaker while into the jungle
they grow strong, they grow...
What is there for me, the story's been told
What is there for me, my days have been sold
What is there for me, my hope falling down
Ruins of your power lay smashed on the groundAttention everybody
attention gays and women
I've made a proclamation
you've got to hear it
I wanna put red - heat
on frost - bitten brains
I wanna do it well
with awful pain
President is on my side, it makes me feel alright
President is on my side, it makes me feel alright
Attention everybody
attention bitches and killers
I got a plan of war
You've got to see it
this plan is rather easy
I gotta reach the rot
I'm proposing prudence
I was born as a nut
President is on my side, it makes me feel alright
President is on my side, it makes me feel alrightJust a little taste, then best friends we are
You take me in, just to spit me out again
This time is now, my time is gone
My freedom leaves me, a broken soul.
Every day is a struggle for survival
In filth I subsist
To live like this is a gift I dont possess no more
Destination: haven.
Vindicate, a formless shape, creating its own self.
Ominous, a future I didn't predict.
It is the reason we, forget to forgive.
So hard to keep it in order, it is the reason we
It is the reason we, forget to forgive.
So hard to keep it in order, it is the reason we-
Just a little taste, then best friends we are
You take me in, just to spit me out again
This time is now, my time is gone
My freedom leaves me, an empty shell.
Vindicate, a formless shape, creating its own self.
Ominous, a future I didn't predict.
It is the reason we, forget to forgive.
So hard to keep it in order, it is the reason we
It is the reason we, forget to forgive.
So hard to keep it in order, it is the reason we-Born into this world
a fragile being so becomes aclloused by hardsdh reality an bleak circumstance
for the weak will perish in this eternal fire
only leaving hearts made of stone and hate
betrayed by the words of false prophets
feeding the broken words of hope in vain
no comfort can be found in the embrace of insincerity
we hold on by a thread of hope but that thread is nothing but a false glimmer
we are the calloused and the broken baptized in eternal fire
for the weak will perish in this eternal fire
only leaving hearts made of stone and hate
betrayed by the words of false prophetsRemember when you walked out into the rain
The railroad and the sky were calling your name
Can you hear them whisper
Come and get lost with us
You've been chasing shadows in your hometown
Searched for answers that refused ever to be found
So you compromised and found a new horizon
Ever since you left you're always on my mind
So here's to you if you care to listen
Here's to you, let me cross the distance
Even if you're not here
I'll reach you, I'll reach you
Even though you're away, I'm near
We'll forgive and forget
I'll reach you
Seven years and seven days you've been gone
Seven years of changing faith and opinion
Would you recognize me
If you walked beside me?
I would keep on waiting
It's been to long
Here's to you if you care to listen
Here's to you, let me cross the distance
Even if you're not here
I'll reach you, I'll reach you
Even though you're away, I'm near
We'll forgive and forget
I'll reach you
Even if you're not here
I'll reach you, I'll reach you
Even though you're away, I'm near
We'll forgive and forget
I'll reach you
I'll reach youI can only imagine that wrath is being held out
So there will be time for us to be redeemed
But surely wrath is not being held out
So that we may redeem ourselves
For I have seen the madness of those who died trying
But is regret only a word that the living possess?
But is regret only a word that the living possess?
I long to see their faces regardless of the decay
For in the eyes of the deceased
We would see hope in our last day
Inside this dying world
For there is still, for there is still beauty
Inside this dying world
For what good is there holding off wrath
If we are determined to bring wrath upon ourselves
Wrath upon ourselves
To bring wrath upon ourselves
We would see hope in our last day
Inside this dying world
For there is still, for there is still beauty
Inside this dying world
We would see hope in our last day
Inside this dying world
For there is still, for there is still beauty
Inside this dying world[One of Viviathans:]
We are no evil don't fear.
We have the truth you must hear.
We've created your world.
Like in tales you have heard.
When everything was still fine.
In the course of our time.
We created the sword.
And four stones gave the force.
That force was the key.
To bring life everywhere we could see.
We are those real spirits you know.
And those voices in altar were wrong.
We helped you survive years ago.
We gave you the power so strong.
Your land, is the youngest from our creation.
The best of this whole generation.
It's the shelter to all those four powers.
The haven from the darkest souls.
Then, something went wrong.
We made land very strong.
All they wanted was death.
Till the end of last breath.
When someone's using the force
Darkness will find it's source
Evil knows where you are
Where they come it's not far
That force was the key.
Bring life everywhere we could see.
We are those real spirits you know.
And those voices in altar were wrong.
We helped you "to" survive years ago.
We gave you the power so strong.Green shades of the elven wood
Covers her face so pale
Those eyes like a stars in the night
Her hair like a golden flame
Gods of wisdom and fortune
Have blessed her with their gifts
no earthly creature can ever reach
A beauty like hers
Young elven knights come to her
There's so much love to share
But still she's awaiting the one
The one with a mortal way
They meet in the shadows
No eyes will see their embrace
Again she's awaiting he to come
She's so desperate her heart can't lay
The evil has lurked in the realm
Dark creatures have come with the death
When black blade reaches her heart
And all the life is gone
He has lost his everything
Pain and agony, that's all left now on
Way of the fate is cruel
Through tears he curses his gods
With grief he left those woods
His sorrow turns to hate
By his blood he swears the oath
He will fight it's never too lateI wait, I hate
Silence kills you like a loaded gun
My time, you waste
Resolution turn your back and run
Drunk with power
Your ivory tower
Never stood, never could
And around and around
You hit the ground
Reservation hellbound
Most people cry
When a person dies
You want to know why?
Run it through,
Discharge!
Most people cry
Not when you die
You want to know why?
Run it through,
Discharge!
Nobody cried
You lived a lie
You lived a lie!
Run it through,
Discharge!
Most people cry
When a person dies
You want to know why?
Run it through,
Discharge!
Your life, what life?
What's the difference between you and death?
Overdose, comatose
You won't even leave a corpse that's fresh
Drunk with power
Go take a shower
I wish you would, I wish you could
And around and around
You hit the ground
Reservation hellbound
A surreal vision
Of a human being
Most people cry
When a person dies
You want to know why?
Run it through,

Self inflicted crucifixion
Suicidal contradiction
Clusterfucked you load it up
Clusterfucked you self destruct!
Get off my dick, it's sick
I refuse to feel sorry for you
I can't believe
People put you on a pedestal
Drunk with power
Your ivory tower
Never stood, never could

Feeding my soul with pain
I am disgusting to this world
Lead me away from here
Disheartening believe broke my
Filling my head with rain
That's pouring it's anger down on me
Exposing my insanityWatching the eventide, the sun will hide and sleep
My heart's beat is slow. I'm thinking about my belief
Rain washing over me cleaning up my brain
Till I question all my thoughts
And clean 'em up from stains
Clean 'em up from stains
Clean 'em up from stains, yeah
Die free, yeah!
Welcome to the circle of those who know their way
Welcome to those who've realized their needs
Who don't need fear to pray and betray
But they don't accept us living free
Believing what we need
Haven't heard anything about poetry
They only know their painful greed
Don't ever trust those who say they know
Those who show and force you to bow
I've done no wrong but to ask my brain
To be free from pain built up by those who reign
[Chorus]
A mind in disguise now I know
It's better to hide my belief than feeding the crow
A life on the run now I know
The kingdom of disguise is the last place to go
In the eyes of the world I'm a master of heresy
Swimming against the tide - endangering democracy
I remember the day when I was young and bold
When I thought that my mind was free
Until the time that I was told
Out in the night they laugh about me and my Knowledge and
Speak prayers our god don't want to hear. But listen:
Wherever you are, I will get you! Well, you don't know who
I am? I am the inquisition and I am your heretics
Barbarian end!
Beware and be silent and follow the sign
Keep the mission as a secret of your mind
One out of a million is a friend of your line
Don't forget there are evil eyes behind
Holding the candle she was found in the rain
Bright eyes and blissful but they thought
That she went astray
Too late to escape, she seemed to be insane
She got imprisoned because she got her own way
Now can't you remember?
What have you done?
Believe me, I'm innocent. I've done no wrong!
But you are strange! You are guilty I guess!
And after the torture you will confess and burn!
Ending in the flames, burning down her fame
Prayers to the saints, their end of an evil game
Run to your last refuge
Maybe the silence of your voice
Lie but be true to yourself
Sometimes you've got no choice
Follow a king called silence
Live in his kingdom of disguise
There is a temple of shelter
Where God forgives you your lies.
Run to your last refuge
Maybe the silence of your voice
Lie but be true to yourself
Sometimes you've got no choice
Follow a king called silence
Live in his kingdom of disguise
There is a temple of shelter
Where God forgives you your lies.
I can see it bright here in front of your eyes
The apparition never dies
Yes I see, yes I feel, yes I know it allBlack inferno, chaos reigns supreme
A cancerous growth spreading out the dark
Leaving the wounded land in ashes
A civilization in ruins and decay
Whores and scavengers violating the dead
Like a filthy flock of hungry wolves
Tortured shapes of steel against the sky
The eve of destruction, the final tragedy
Nothing left to admire
Nuclear war and the aftermath
Down in flames, a rain of fire
Time has run outSadly his mother watches helplessly,
as her child demolishes the very fabric she believes in.
Catching an occasional glimpse, she remembers with great pain,
the anguish she felt, as the memories from her past re-appear.
Frustration turns to confused anger.
She still can't come to terms with the fact
that her husband took his own life.
"Why", she asks herself, "why didn't he tell me?
Why couldn't anybody lend him a helping hand?"
All the while her son is silently crying out for help.
Intro
Looking back in time,
Without consent.
two lovers ran away
A tragic tale, so often made
So sad and destined to fail
They're in and out of every place
Searchin' hard a sad disgrace
At best a darkened room, without a view
Those memories, still remain
Never once did she complain
Now time repeats itself, all over again
What he did, was insane
Sadly his own life he'd take
And you've been left to face the guilt, alone
Just try to remember
He was a victim of circumstance
Close your eyes, try to recall
The strength you felt
Now, is the time to be stronger
Than you've ever been before
Bury all your anguish and fear, you're not to blame
Don't analyze, come to terms
Face the truth, don't turn away
Where there's a will, there has to be a way
Into the world, your child came
Responsibility or shame
He backed away from you, don't lose him again
You're not alone! you've got to be strongerThy gruesome cries so thin
On thus you will succeed
The amorphous illusions
Thwart your willingness to believe
The beauty disturbed
The amulet, opener of forgotten doors
Leads back to that doomed tiara-night
See thyself wild in hysteria
Death's irony
The beauty disturbed
Listen to this tortuous threnody
Filled with the pain
Thou can see where betrayal shall bring thee
Death's obligatory
Where all elements melt to one
And odious memories perish together with you
Should have seen the omen, the mirror
Death's reality
Cry, your threnody will be heard
For thy suffocated minds
The tortuous sound as angels' voices
The phobia, in search for ancestral blood
An arable force from the past
Leads back to the atrocious roots
The deep inner soul, never to be exposed
The axiom you can't deny or better
Drags you down into a lost abyss
The hymn stops, fear will reign
Death's crueltyLight gives birth to cold shadows
All our imaginations gone forever
Uninterrupted, the voice is in your head
The eyes are blind, you're controlled by fear
You are...controlled...by fear
A puppet that kills and cheats on command
Holy crusades in the names of light
Millions of murdered heathens mark the way
Countless defrauded people punished with civilisation
We must...control...ourselvesI am ready
I am waiting for you
Come whenever it pleases you
By my bed, a lock of my hair
I have said farewell
I won't despair
I've heard your steps
Outside the door
What keeps you waiting?
I was so sure
Now it is time for me to go beyond
Come now, with your torch
Turn it upside down
Dark and gloomy
He comes to us
Unexpected
Thanatos
He takes us to
The underworld
We're his sheep
He is the herd
Peace and silence
He brings to us
At the end of the life
ThanatosSit here all in all
Waiting on the phone
Push my body to the floor
Still you never call
She's still with me
Kiss still kills me
Can't feel guilty
It's just a memory
Memory
All the things you put me through
The hopeless nights I tried to make it right for you
Show me how it is to lose
And who the hell are you to drag me down with you
Flowers that I bought are now dead and gone
Love that was before is gone evermore
All my hurting, all my yearning, all that burning
Can't you see that it is me
My beautiful
All the things you put me through
The hopeless nights I tried to make it right for you
Show me how it is to lose
And who the hell are you to drag me down with you
To drag me down with you
Every time I looked in your eyes
Crucified again
Every time you sold me your lies
I was justified in the end
Just like some face lost on a runaway train
Pass me by wave goodbye
All the things you put me through
The hopeless nights I tried to make it right for you
Show me how it is to lose
And who the hell are you to drag me down with you
To drag me down with you
To drag me down with you
To drag me down with you
To drag me down with youGet up
You all know I'm a badass
I don't really care about your opinions of me
Born without these emotions
I just live inside the world, nothing's given to me
I just came to kick ass and take names
And if you want a piece then come and show your face
Say what you want but nothing can stop me now
Contradict to know what I want
Take a shot and I'll bounce this off
I'm in control so nothing can hold me down
All we get is hell but it works
Too strong to give into words
Too bad I'm bulletproof
You already know I don't really care about opinions of me
And if you have to ask, nothing in this world was ever given to me
I just came to kick ass and take names
And if you want a piece then come and show your face
Say what you want but nothing can stop me now
Contradict to know what I want
Take a shot and I'll bounce this off
I'm in control so nothing can hold me down
All we get is hell but it works
Too strong to give into words
You know I'm bulletproof
How does it feel
I am a human target
But I live for this
And I've only just started
You wanted something from me
But I have nothing to give
And if you feel like you're forgotten
Here's your chance to take it back
Say what you want but nothing can stop me now
Contradict to know what I want
Take a shot and I'll bounce this off
I'm in control so nothing can hold me down
All we get is hell but it works
Too strong to give into words
Say what you want but nothing can stop me now
Contradict to know what I want
Take a shot and I'll bounce this off
I'm in control so nothing can hold me down
All we get is hell but it works
Too strong to give into words
You bet I'm bulletproofSeven seas in seven tears
Seven hours in seven years
Seven ships set seven sails
Seven armies in seven gales
Seven tears, seven slaves
Seven wonders, seven graves
Seven whalers, seven sins
Seven virtues, seven fins
Ho, heave ho
Ho, heave ho
Ho, heave ho
Ho, heave ho
Fathoms deep indigo
Knots and leagues of azure road
All the oceans, some stories told
It's in the heavens seven fold
Tidal tsunami crashing white horses
Roller breaker, white capped sky scraper
Tidal tsunami crashing white horses
Roller breaker, white capped sky scraper
Ho, heave ho
Ho, heave ho
Ho, heave ho
Seven seas in seven tears
Seven hours in seven years
Clipper ship and galleon
Oil tanker, submarine
King Canute before the tide
King Canute was very wise
Nothing matters, king or queen
Nothing stops the seven seas
Seven seas in seven tears
Seven hours in seven years
Seven tears, seven tears
Seven tears, seven tears
Ho, heave ho
Ho, heave ho
Ho, heave ho
...Scrawled into the pavement, again and again. Written on the red stalls in smokey tin.
On the smokey tin, it melts again and again.
On the booths of the round table, again and again.
Drug onto the street and onto the soaking steps, again and again.
Endless debris sifting through static lungs, lingering into every pore
Laced with a bitter face near the dawning of the high and madness of the undertow
We audience who saved our roses. We audience who scoffed at the tears.
Ugliness stretching toward the chandelier. Pale with pain
I imagined the overcome and fell to my knees before the endless
Truth of instability and futility.
Now I knowI have always been an experiment in terror
At least I can only kill you once
Standing aloof when I made up my mind
Reaching, why it's better to be blunt
Your walking point through my minefield
You gotta get out
Your on point in my minefield
Forever waiting for a road map
Speak, say something, answer me
I left you in a killing box
Sketchy's not a name you can pin on my
I'll start a revolt with my honesty
A piece of you burns every time you like
So lets start a war, just to see how many dieForgive the day's
Last serenades
Her skies they bruise like Nordic women
Deep crimson stains
That Death would claim
His robes of office swim in
As would I
For his dark eye
Has fixed, a basilisk, a scythe
On charred remains
With shared disdain
For those I chose to mortify
Their cries
Have paralysed
And the smoke has choked these vistas
But still I lie
Though tears have died
On the grave of my Clarissa
A verse for her whispered to the earth
(A lover's curse is a see-through coffin)
Praises her curves so oft concurred
Though she wasÃ¢?Â¦
No Snow White on the night she died
Her shadower's boon when the moon glazed over
Lipped with blood and secrets pried
For on and in they spread her wide
That seraph bride
The Devil's pride
Shalt soon avenge with swift reprise
But they would writhe
For my dark eye
Bewitched, was fixed like Mordecai's
On Esther's reign
And in this vein
I saw their lust still stain her thighs
Their cries
Have paralysed
And the smoke has choked these vistas
But still I lie
Though tears have died
On the grave of my Clarissa
Beneath these trees where the mist enwreathes
Her spirit flees, seeing chains of torches
A fleeting kiss stirring leaves of poetryÃ¢?Â¦
I wasÃ¢?Â¦
No dark knight, breaking men like ice
I was like a lycanthrope until the moon glazed over
Lipped with blood and last goodbyes
Now I dream
Enwrapt in pure clouds of the sweetest oblivion
Where beauty streams
Freed from the teeth of those beasts that had come
To tear out her spells
In red lettered cells
Wherein even the crown prince of Hell
Come out of his arrogant shell
Would falter to better
But her face soon dispels
And as black feathers fell
From heaven's smoke
So I woke to insanity
Her exquisite corpse
Found fit for their sport
Of course
Would burn on the morrow with meÃ¢?Â¦
And there on this night
Strung up in my sight
Naked she sways
Displayed for their vulgar delight
I scream through my bars at the stars
That for these crimes of mine solace me
I will fear not the flames
That to passion are tame
Not nearly the same searing pain
(I pray) As held sway upon losing her
Nor the mettle of roars
That will settle like ashes and scores
As with our ghosts in the fog
When we both turn no more[Shermin]
Great Spirits hear me
We are hopeless can't you see
There must be one key
You have to set us free
[Amardon]
Now I see a bright light in the sky
Great Spirits, they fly
[Shemin contacts the Great Spirits of the Cryon]
[Shemin]
Spirits know what to do
You gave us the sky so blue
[Amardon]
The light turns to fire
Great Spirits come closer
Spirits in the sky
Among the flames they fly
Fire burning high
Voices on our mind...
[The Great Spirits of the Cryon]
We'll create you a sword from the stones
And the shield that protects you
We'll give you the courage to fight
It's all we can do to help.
[Shemin]
Now to Graynell you go!
Breton's warriors will help you
From Sendell you find...
Cruelty of the darkest mind
You must fight for our freedom
You have to kill Delinom
[Amardon travels to Graynell to collect his troops]
[Amardon]
With my troops I'll ride
To Sendell this sword by my side
I know that the Spirits are near
In my mind I won't feel the fear
Spirits in the sky
Among the flames they fly
Fire burning high
Voices in my mind...
[The Great Spirits of the Cryon]
We'll create you a sword from the stones
And the shield that protects you
We'll give you the courage to fight
It's all we can do to help.
[Amardon]
I have to survive!
[Amardon arrives to the town of Sendell]What I have in me
In the mind is you
(I would die if this was wrong)
What I'm feeling now
What I'm heading into!
(I am lost in pain without you)
(So cold, so alone)
All I have is you
It is all that I'm waiting for
All I need is you
(Now I can't make it through)
All the nights I've prayed
Must this all be untrue?
(I am not prepared to be strong)
I just can't believe I am losing you
(Unprepared to carry on)
(I can't see you walk away)
(So cold, so alone)
All I have is you
It is all that I'm waiting for
All I need is you
(Now I can't make it through)
I am losing you forever
(I am lost in pain without you)
I am leaving ground forever
(Forever, forever)
Distant, so far, destiny is selecting me
I can't be strong, life is disconnecting me
Now loneliness infecting me
Gone are the days, you were there protecting me
So cold (so alone)
All I have is you
It is all that I'm waiting for
All I need is you
(Now I can't make it through)
I am losing you forever
(I am lost in pain without you)
I am leaving ground forever (forever)
All I have is you (It is all that I'm breathing for)
All I need is you (Now I can't make it through)
It is all that I'm waiting for

As you're tangled in thought, believe
And let your soul unleash
We're well on our way but they lead us astray
Perpetuate with distractions
As fare as we've made only as one we can save humanity
The absence of what you hold dear it'll leave you stranded
Heartache will stem from fear
Ultimately the choice is up to you (the choice is up to you)
But in the end disbelief can't be denied can not be refused
They tremble in fear in the undercover sanctuary
And the walls disguise despair in the undercover sanctuary
I will show you more, we're uncovering
Let your soul unleash
The absence of what you hold dear it'll leave you stranded
Heartache will stem from fear
We are the victims but we are also the crime
And the only one who can judge us is the earth in time
We are victims yet we are the crime
And the only one who can judge us is the earth
Follow the signs"Er, what's this song about?"
"Er, nothing."
None
No recipes
It was like a see-saw
No
It was like an up and down
Bye bye
Mother, Sister
Mother, Sister
Why did you put your head in?
Reach or preach
It's all a diminished return
Now
Floorboard
Creaks
Mother, Sister
Mother, Sister
Why did you push your head in?
Astray
Our Friends
And the fathers are underground
Your mouth is sold out
Mother, Sister
Mother, Sister
Why did you put your head in?
The pylon[As heard on the record...]
Pained and intense, man
They were inquiring.
They were curious orange...
They rode over peasants like you, they rode over peasants like you,
And their horses loved them too, and their horses loved them too.
They Were Kurious Orange. They Were Curious Orange.
They built the world as we know it, all the systems you traverse.
Rode slipshod over all dumbshits.
They were curious orange...
They freed the Blacks too.
They built church in one day, man,
Amish
They were curious orange...
Their clothes were cool.
Paved way for atom bomb--didn't know.
They made the Jews go to school.
They made Hitler laugh in pain.
They sent missionary girls to Arab states, and the sun-baked men
did drool.
They were curious orange...
They made Hitler laugh in pain.
They turned Napoleon over and didn't know.
They invented birth control
They were invulnerable to cool.
They were curious orangeLike a closing door, I'm slowly shutting down.
Like a falling leaf, just waiting for the pound.
Don't even bother, nothing can stop it;
Tried my best, but I just can't help it.
It will take a lifetime before I love again.
You will see me die before I love again.
Say my last goodbye.
Say my last goodbye; Goodbye; Goodbye.
Say my last goodbye; Goodbye; Goodbye.
All the broken pieces' shattered all around me.
They've been lying there since the day that you left me.
I'm chanceless to fight against her;
Tried my best, but I can't break her.
It will take a lifetime before I love again.
You will see me die before I love again.
Say my last goodbye.
Say my last goodbye; Goodbye; Goodbye.
Say my last goodbye; Goodbye; Goodbye.You tried so hard to break me
To make me bend
But I have stood the test of time
Well, I've had a taste of glory
And I've seen the hell below
It's time for me to take what's mine
[Chorus]
Target acquired
We open fire
This operation
Annihilation
So many come and go
They're changing like the wind
A product from a factory
Well, I've only got one mission
And I will stand my ground
Something called integrity
[Chorus: x2]
Well, this is a retribution
And this is my revenge
This is a resolution
Committed till the end
Till the end
I say, till the end
Wait till the end
Well, I stand here in my silence
Content, my soul at rest
This is what I do it for, yeah
But to the leeches
The liars and the thieves
Just know I always win the war, yeah
[Chorus: x2]
Fire, fireI feel the tunes of sorrow
Filling my heart
With tears in my eyes
I watch my whole life fall apart
Endless days of mourning
I try to move on
Grief is my reality
My hope forever gone
With a smile I hide
Dark emotions deep inside
No matter how I try
All becomes another lie
I look into the sky
Waiting to die
Take me away from here
To a place without fear
Come sweet death
Let me sleep forever
Come sweet death
Life slowly fade away
Nothing more to give
Nothing more to say
No more will to live
Dressed in mourning
I shed my last tear
Through sadeness
I lived my life
Finally the end is hereJag star hr nu ensam kvar
Du tog mig hit, men utan svar
Jag vill inte veta
Jag vill inte hata
Jag tror ej mer p det som var
Jag krossar allt som sitter kvar
Jag vill inte veta
Jag vill inte hata
Jag tror ej mer p det som var
Jag krossar allt som sitter kvar
Jag vill inte veta
Jag vill inte hata
Jag kastar mig till allt som berr
Men inget tar p mig som dr
Jag vill inte sakna
Jag vill inte vaknaThe grave welcomes you with open arms. Last light escapes, last breath remains. Circling the body, brushing passed the skin and bone. It cradles you, your holy manger. Born into ruin, we feel withdrawal. Death is your procreator, your predecessor. From your decay grows a beautiful garden, The stalks caress your failure, and the petals bring you closer to eternity. Pray for your rebirth. Pray for your chance to bloom. The heart starts and stops, the mind disconnects. As flowers, we grace the earth with our presence. The tide rises and turns, and we simply expire. Over-saturated, our lungs fill with the essence of the universe. Until we feel the gentle kiss of dawn draw the water from our lungs, and we can breathe easy. Like night and day, we have never met. Aching for one another, we aim for congregation. You are my prey, you are the martyr. The blight takes it's toll and our bodies grow black. Wilted, we fade away. Rotted from the root, we exchange our stem for legs. We blossom into our bodies, and the process has been reset. Welcome to your new home.A war is going on between Iran and Iraq
is everybody aware of this fruitless misery
Countless lives have been waisted
Money keeps the machine guns running well
[Pre-chorus:]
The cease fire is demanted,
Release of prisoners is urged,
New trust is requested,
Peace and freedom is wanted
A resolution has passed the security council
New hope is given to new freedom
The goal is to ban the bloody useless war
We have to stop the war, come on let's do it!
[Pre-chorus/Chorus:]
Fight for: Resolution 588
Get through Resolution 588
No choice Resolution 588
Let's go and go for it
The UN's demanding an immediate ceasefire
Will Iran stop bumbing Basra?
Will Iraq quit the air raids in Teheran and Hamadan?
Will the superpowers be very careful?
[Pre-chorus/Chorus]
Stop the bloody war now, lets go for it
Everybody is involved yeah,
Support the Resolution 588
Resolution 588 testifies that good will is there
Lets try to change the will to reality
So far the war had no chance to stop for any
length of time
Will the little resolution be the chance?
[Pre-chorus/Chorus]Come and stay, make my day
Take away the gray
And set the wheels in motion
Down the road, what you do
Come and fall into
At the end of this day
You can flee you can be
Your own enemy
In the end you will see no daylight
And you try, by and by
Falling from the sky
Like a nine days wonder
Give a little try, give a little more try
Never fall in line for a fleeting moment
Be and end all, I am aiming high
Climb a little higher
I don't wanna see your affected smile
Not for anything, the time is nigh
Lay it on the line and run the mile
Reach a little higher
You can shine or resign
(Or)
Lay it on the line
Or you make a bid for power
Vertigo, overflow
Just a cameo
Silent as a whisper
Raising Cain, break the chain
Gather new terrain
Time and tide wait for no man ever
And your eyes are agleam
Like you're in a dream
Getting out from under
Give a little try, give a little more try
Never fall in line for a fleeting moment
Be and end all, I am aiming high
Climb a little higher
I don't wanna see your affected smile
Not for anything, the time is nigh
Lay it on the line and run the mile
Reach a little higher
Give a little try, give a little more try
Never fall in line for a fleeting moment
Be and end all, I am aiming high
Climb a little higher
I don't want, not for anything
So won't you run the mile?
A little higher, reach a little higherSometimes when I look into my mind
There is a place I have to find
It's a world without no borders
There is no law, there are no orders
I gul away into the sky
I've lost control, I'm flying high
And on top of the highest place
I see your beautiful face
If you are alone just close your eyes
Come with me and see the sun arise
My journey into freedom has just begun
See all the things that have to come
You're not alone inside your mind
There is a place you have to find
Come with me in my domain
And be a part... of my game...
I wish that my dream becomes true
'cos all I want is to be with you
...but...
Life in not how it seems
Just again I'm drowning in dreams...She's riding on a crimson wave
Truth sat on her shoulder
Planets before melting face
The keys for the wounded
Sinking into underground
Please the one who wants it
Something is pulling you down
It's not the cravings why you need it
It's a rush hour inside my head
Don't wanna share the anguish
And I will take it away from you
Before you can change it
That bastard hallucination's pushing me
Like a damned I walk over
Touch the sky when it's burning red
Standing the ground I have chosen
Standing the ground I have chosen
Shivering in outer space
There's no one who can hear you
Getting into different state
It's like getting nowhere
Gathering all those fears and fails
There's no one who can see you
Someone is pulling you down
It's not the cravings why you need it
It's a rush hour inside my head
Don't wanna share the anguish
And I will take it away from you
Before you can change it
That bastard hallucination's pushing me
Like a damned I walk over
Touch the sky when it's burning red
Standing the ground I have chosen
Standing the ground I have chosen
[Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible]Trei cruci de lemn, trei cruci enorme de lemn
Vopsite cu trei culori, pazesc pe marginea soselei
Fintina celor... crediciosi!
Trei cruci pe marginea soselei cu gesturi largi de miini bolnave
Opresc din drum pe calatori si parca-s trei spinzuratori
De care atirna trei crisosi...
Intr-o zi impinsi de-acelasi funerar indemn
Ca dou-armate puse una-n fata alteia
Cumintii se-ntilnira cu nebunii
Copiii mortilor de miine se-ntilnira cu parintii...
"Si-armatele-ncepura lupta la umbra crucilor de lemn
Deoparte flutura stindardul credintei... alb... curat..."
...ca albul cel curat, al florilor de nufar
Iar tricolorul nebuniei, inchis cu grija-n cite-in cufar
De craniu omenesc...
Sta gata sa se desfasoare la cea dintii ingenuncheare
A albului domnesc...
Insa-n ziu-aceea cerul innegrit de fum parea
Un tavan de catedrala ce se naruia
"Iar fumul din clopotnitele-aprinse deschidea-n albastrul:"
Drumul altui fum, mai greu, mai negru si-albastrul
se-nnegrea...
Si-n ziu-aceea cerul innegrit de fum parea
Un tavan de catedrala ce se naruia
Si multimea-nspaimintata, spre clopotnitele-aprinse
Se-ndrumeaza grupuri, grupuri, cei cuminti privesc plingind
Pling ca resturile unei armate-nvinse, iar nebunul sta deoparte
Si zimbeste ... fredonind:
BLASFEMIE !!!
"Iar tricolorul nebuniei adapostea pe-nvingatori!!!"
English translate: Banner Of Blasphemy
Three wooden crosses
Three huge crosses of wood
Painted with three colors
On the margin of the road
Guarding the fountain of the believers
Three crosses
On the margin of the road
With gestures made by morbid hands
They hinder wanderers whilst passing
Like three gallows on holy lands
Where three christians are hanging...
Inclined by a funeral stir
On a fatal sky, so blur
Like two armies enticed to war
The mad have fallen upon the brave
The children of 'morrows dead
Their parents had met
In the shade of the wooden crosses
The armies began their battle
Aside... the banner of creedance flattered
White and clean
Like the cleanest white men have seen
And the blasphemic flag of madness
Safely embedded in each human skull
Was ready to unfold at the first
Subjugation of the royal white
On the same day, blackened by fumes
The heavens seem to be the ceiling
Of a collapsing cathedral, bleeding
And the fumes of the burning steeples
Opened in the celestial blue
The way of another fume
Blacker, heavier, and the blue
Has become black, too
So the horrified people
Hasten to the burning steeples
The brave behold whilst crying
Like the remnants of a defeated army
And the madmen stay aside
Grinning and humming: Blasphemy
And the tricolor of madness was sheltering
The conquerors!When profit shows his face
Our sense of clarity is washed away.
Spinning round the axle of greed,
Don't let the economy stagnate
For it's our creed.
I turn my head away in shame
As you crave for more,
Selling out what is not yours to sell.
We're the pimps of it all.
Living in the decadence of our dignity.
When silver waves his hand,
We kneel so eagerly.
Living in the decadence of our dignity.
Where man will take command
We'll sail astray in greed.
Come into my booth and trade.
What about the exclusive bargain
For the day?
I can satisfy all your needs.
Sell your future and you will profit today,
Do your deeds.Why ruining your life a acting foolish prayers?
Sacrifices, ritual and homicides
Drinking animal blood with no sense of shame
'Till the bottom of the chalice will start to shine!
Unspeakable secrets that make you a slave
What's the meaning of this absurdity?
I can understand the feelings
Blood injected eyes growing high
I do comprehend the reasons
The insanity of their minds...
CHORUS
How can your state of mind be healthy and free
When even your best friends may attempt your life?!
How can you state of mind be healthy and free
When even your best friend can put you on a bier?!
I do comprehend the reasons
The insanity of their minds...
CHORUS
How can your state of mind be healthy and free
When even your best friends may attempt your life?!
How can you state of mind be healthy and free
When even your best friend can put you on a bier?!I wage an unholy war
Against your fucked up soul
The shattered illusions of a thousand nightmares
Preserved in a jar of shit by God
Surprise you fucking lose
Urine dripping from your stigmata
The stench that surrounds you gives you away
And the evil moisture that you secrete
No lie, no shit, this is fucking war
I know you fucked my soul
I know you fucked my soul
[Incomprehensible]We have to wait
For a dying day
Full of black decay
We'll find a way
To become aware
Breathing tainted air
We change the lanes
In every second of our lives
We lost our minds
We'll taste the water brine
All for the silver shine
Can't stay the same
Should end this bloody game
Bare in the venom rain
To fuel the greed to feed the hungered has it's price
There's the feeling once again
The day where black and white began
Await the ending of our everlasting violence
We've all been healing from the pain
From all the misery and constraint
We're inhaling fumes again
So don't deny it
Lies will unwind
The verity you'll find
Upon the moor resigned
Primary gain
Comes with a thousand slain
All for the greater vain
Without the horror causing hazard we'll survive
Whatever lies ahead
We will face tomorrow
Then every all delusions end
All of this was foreseen
Give in
Have to break the chain of grief
You
Born to be free
You decide
All are free
Time to chance
Nothing or all
The clock is racing on
The pace is very strong
Our borrowed time is gone
The dawn of sharing all our power has arrived
We're all inhaling fumes again
And there the black and white will endSilence in shivering solitude
Obligations pressure for all to bear
All the pitiful answers, the innocent lies
Can mere words fill
The emptiness from which I fed?
Be gone, oh, yielding evidence of greed
Safe now in the other shore
Behind the emptiness from which I fled
Can silence be shared?
If so, can the perception of silence
Fit into the frame which is represent?
The unity for which we stand
The confines representing a timeless sacrifice
No eye can of silence tell lie
Silence, yet the absence of sound
Does not feed me
The essence of beauty alone
Fall silent to lingering charm
Brought forth be the sun
Shed light on the emptiness
What can be extracted from nothing
What can be found within the emptiness
Be gone, oh, yielding evidence of greed
Safe now on the other shore
Behind the emptiness from which I fed
Brought forth be the errors of our ways
As is denial so is contempt
Introspective to all but one
Tear apart the flames
No eye can of silence tell lie
How can I even begin
The battle where no one wins?
From answers I now flee
Screaming out too no avail
Have I become what for so long I've dread
The missing pieces
Must now be replaced
What eyesight fails to grasp
Is the emptiness from which I fledShe wakes up, puts a little makeup on
I'm waiting outside, hope it doesn't take a long time
Cuz I'm trying to roll while the night is young
But I bite my tongue because of what might come
We might run till the sunrise, mix the butterflies
Lips locked, tongues tied
Two tickets inside of the glove box in my ride
She walks outside and I'm tongue tied
Last week she made me mushroom tea
Started touching me, not giving me much room to breathe
At ease baby girl, you're looking like a toy
Could you please light a candle and put on some Pink Floyd
I can't handle your noise right now, killing my vibe
I want to climb inside of my own damn mind
And for the time being feel like I'm seeing a reason
To please the part of my being that feels deep as the Aegean Sea
Boston's about to freeze, walking through the autumn leaves
Stop and smell the Peonies, maybe eat a few of these
It's you and me, and we're one and the same
Toxins in the brain add oxygen to the flame because...
HOOK:
Soon it will be cold enough to build fires
Living in the city and we never see stars
Yeah we've got a tendency to take it too far
But I don't want to call it a night quite yet
Soon it will be cold enough to build fires
Grew up in the city and we never saw stars
Yeah we've got a tendency to take it too far
But I don't want to call it a night quite yet
The first time I saw her sitting at barstool
Peeling the label off of a bottle of harpoon
Our soon to be tune was playing through the juke box
Got a panoramic view of her bandana tube top
Biker boots complimented her daisy dukes
Whiskey on the rocks like she trying to get loose
Dawning a disguise like the rest of the bar files
All starry eyed and escaping the hard times
So I slid into the seat beside her
Living to die, I thought I'd give it a try
I said, "It's only getting colder, drinking until we're sober
A quarter of the way through life and getting older
I want to move boulders girl," That's what I told her
And then she said with a shrug of her shoulder
"You're popping tags on your clothes while there's tags on the toes
Of a thousand people froze in the city Winter cold
Reaching into your bag of lies; hand out all your alibis
Hitting on women and then you trick them when the cab arrives
What kind of girl do you take me for?"
She gave me a cigarette and we headed for the door singing...
HOOK
This is what living looks like, 2 am at night
Sipping a natty light, gripping on a fatty type booty
And I'm feeling like of moody from the come down
Chasing the sun round the planet till we're dumbfounded
Did we grow up to become dumb kids
Did we get the notice the vote is to numb our lids
Kids looking like they just got back from Bisco
Pretending that they live in the 60's in San Francisco
Moon rocks got him talking a hell of a lot
Somebody sell him some pot, don't want to listen to that
Jibber-jabber so I tell him I'll be back soon
Cats in gas masks get blasted in the back room
All of the noise right now killing my vibe
I want to climb inside of my own damn mind
And for the time being feel like I'm finally breathing
Freeing the part of my being that feels deep as the Aegean Sea
Boston's about to freeze, walking through the autumn leaves
Stop and smell the Peonies, maybe eat a few of these
It's you and me, and we're one in the same
Toxins in the brain I got nothing to complain about
HOOK(the old one) The moan... Who has remembered?
Who is still able to remember about how they did dream and yearn
Laugh and dance and then about how they were dying
To flow towards the stellar worlds beyond the horizons of mind
Where all our laws are nothing at all
Maybe to dwell forgotten maybe once to return...
(the young one) Dark are thy eyes and dark are soul of thine
What is it you know of them?
Reveal to me their stories...
(the old one) As deep as never before I feel them call to me
From the brightest blaze from place where all the paths come to the end
Misunderstood ones wished a Strange
Who've left this world when the world was changed
(And leaving they sing the spell joined their hands)
Embrace me with a winter blizzard
Give me the power of all the winds
In the serenity of the endless woods
Unite me with my shadow...
And once I came to know
What beauty is
But I've failed to behold
I was enblinded others were betongued
Beheaded left handless...
Sometimes I miss mirage - last thing I saw
The gray sullen sky and the golden forest
The incarnation of Last Season Purity
That's where my thoughts had found
Their eternal asylum...
Like sparks of the evening fire...
You will remember the only one
That rose most high
And burned most bright
And you will burn too
Your agony will be so horrid
But they'd hear you
The ones who need it
Let them hear...
Thy will be done...These quiet words, they carry me away
Returning
They keep coming back
In idle thoughts and hollow cutaways
Disarm me
No will to attack
Though the sorrow and fear they may depart you today
I will fail you
Of that I'm sure
I will remind you of the pain forevermore
And when my sins are just a memory
Faith restored
I will fail you
To the core
Lost in the shadow of an endless grace
Relentless
My reign is unbound
In this abandon I will devastate
Dismember
'Til agony's found
Though the sorrow and fear they may depart you today
I will fail you
Of that I'm sure
I will remind you of the pain forevermore
And when my sins are just a memory
Faith restored
I will fail you
To the core
I know they prey upon me
I feel them just beyond my
I will fail you
Of that I'm sure
I will remind you of the pain forevermore
And when my sins are just a memory
Faith restored
I will fail you
To the core
I will fail you
Of that I'm sure
I will remind you of the pain forevermore
And when my sins are just a memory
Faith restored
I will fail you
To the coreSnow has fallen in deep
After midnight you leave
Drunken of purple wine
Dark sounding district of men
Tears of pain
Crash my face
Trapped to die in this hell
Death release me
Lust of death
Hallowed before
A red wolf killing an angel
On holy ground
A white starbanner burns
Red flames of their fires
Your eyes follow the steps
Of fiery angels on iceMy fast heart is beating
my soul cut and bleeding
My hells are too meeting
with the man inside my brain
I tell him the all as
I stand and I fall
And just to top it all
I pay him for the task
My guts I am spilling
I tell of the killings
With me at top billing
I take off the mask
His jaw starts a dropping
I say there's no stopping
The blood I'll be mopping
right there on his couch
Another time he'll ask me
what it is I'm thinking
And I will have to show him
I long to see him dead
The walls dripping red
from the axe in his head
And I'm sure now he's dead
by the look in his eyes
Put me to sleep and hypnotize
see the dead stare in my eyes
Let your guard down when you try
to get inside my head
Dive in deep into my mind wonder
all the things you'll find
A war is up your death is
signed session over-dead
I think I'm starting to go
crazy over wanting to kill
I think I'll never stop the
craving to see blood start to spill
I see the outcome when your heart
stops beating and I start to sweat
I love the moment when you're
dead but haven't taken your last breath
The cops busting in
in the middle of my sin
I stop and start to grin
as I see the bodies fly
In my mind I kill them all
heads will roll and bodies fall
Blood and guts and that is
all that you can recognize
I come back from a daydream
open eyes and start to scream
What does all this gore mean
is it really real or not
Splash my face and rub my eyes
maybe noone really dies
Open up to realize
its all inside my head
I think I'm starting to go
crazy over wanting to kill
I think I'll never stop the
craving to see blood start to spill
I see the outcome when your heart
stops beating and I start to sweat
I love the moment when you're dead
but haven't taken your last breath
I think I'm starting to go
crazy over wanting to kill
I think I'll never stop the
craving to see blood start to spill
I think I'm starting to go
crazy over wanting to kill
I think I'll never stop the
craving to see blood start to spill
I see the outcome when your heart
stops beating and I start to sweat
I love the moment when you're dead
but haven't taken your last breath yetTo revolt is to conform
The game of mine now it's rule
The escape becomes the brig
A step ahead - what was mine belongs to it
Black blood of corruption, filled with hate
Overflowing, pumping in my sickly veins
Thickening and boiling, pressure of rage
In a cage, life leading to rampage
If I stop now, what will they do?
Will they see, will they care?
Rancor, anguish, suffering, dread
Y marks this day: no more killing
Anticipating, staring at the lens
Praying for war, praying for death
Wanting for pain, wishing to die, but speaking not
In wait lie, In wait lie, reverse the curse, from the inside
In wait lie, waiting to die, give me my war, cowards
Praying for war... Praying for death...
Wanting for pain... wishing to die...
Minding the kills... Hearing the calls...
Fearing no hell... In wait I lie so still...
A grin besmears my clammy face
As rain trickles down my slitdow
The cold relieves my hot head
At least I know they're comingLet this game begin
Watch, my children
Watch me, you've all come to die
For this battle is lost
Losing their minds
Losing their souls (hush, now hush)
We don't talk
We don't care anymore (I will seal every door)
We don't care anymore
I summon the Nine now
Confirm the alignment (can't get through?)
Carry on, you fools
Try to break free
When we fail
It's lost forever (oh)
When we fail
It's lost forever (oh)
It's not real, no reason to be here
No more fear and no more regrets
Don't look back and free your mind
Stay where you are till the sealing is over
Say goodbye, my friend
Here's your promised end
Be a part of the grand parade
Along we're driven
On and on, it's a grand parade
We're one, we're so sorry to say
It's all the same, you will see
On this grand parade
Damnation
Now join the grand parade
Don't be upset (I will seal every door)
Every now and then (seal every door)
They'll try to awake the misguided (I will seal every door)
The voices you'll hear
They will claim to be real, it's not true
Now look around
We will bring them down
The more I'll show
The less you will know
The Nine will frown
Now see how it grows
Secretly my vision comes true
It's not real
You'll hear it, you'll see it
The otherworld
The otherworld
The otherworld appears
Now round and round
We all shall lose ground
Now praise, I'm the one
We will never fear
We will never fear
We will never fear them again
Oh and here comes the son, the son
He's gone with the shadows
Along with the stars
No more gods, no more lies
No more gods, no war
We'll be free here, we are one
Our will is strong
No more lies and no more tyrants
It all becomes real when the sealing is over
Say goodbye, my friend
Here's your promised end
Be a part of the grand parade
Along we're driven
On and on, it's a grand parade
We're one, we're so sorry to say
It's all the same, you will see
On this grand parade
Damnation
Now join the grand parade
There is no return
It would be the end
We shall sing, we shall sing
Praise the day
Void, we don't fear you no more
Mother void, you can't enter no more
We don't need any hallows
We don't fear any shadows
Shadows on the wall
They're not real
Now, walk in, everyone
Here comes the sun
We will never fall
We will never fall
We will never see him again
Many, we're one
We're humanized
The time has come
This flesh is truth
This blood is real
The highest cause
It's all that we are longing for
There on the river Styx
You'll see, my friend
There on the river Styx
You'll see
They've fooled you to take it away
So no more myths
No more bliss
We are holding it in our hand
And there is nothing they can do
And so this battle ends forevermore
We don't fear anything
Nor any other race
We take control
No longer we act like fools
We're in control
Say goodbye, my friend
Here's your promised end
Be a part of the grand parade
Along we're driven
On and on, it's a grand parade
We're one, we're so sorry to say
It's all the same, you will see
On this grand parade
Damnation
Now join the grand parade
Drown one more time
While we all will say goodbye
Bright, it shines bright
Let us carry one the lie
No more lies
One more lieI'm two steps away from stepping over the edge and getting lost in the great unknown
Because one small step in the wrong direction is enough to shake the cornerstone
Where ever I'm thrown no matter where I end up it can't be any worse than here
If I'm sincere with myself then tell me what else is there really left for me to fear
I'm two steps away from just killing myself because I'm sick and tired of being the prey
But when I'm dead everything that I've said will loose it's meaning and fade to grey
I'm not ready for that I'd rather counterattack instead of leaving my own song unsung
Because I'm too young to die and I can never justify not breathing air into my lunges
I'll take one more step until somebody stops me
I'll take one more step until somebody stops me
I'll take one more step until somebody stops me
I'll take one more step until somebody stops me
I'm two steps away from making somebody pay for everytime that I've been deceived
How can I believe a single word you say when I know you've got a card up your sleeve
I might be naive but I'm still forced to believe that all the best in life is yet to come
That's why I refuse to lose my faith in myself even after all the wrong that you've doneSent by the gods to show power.
Scorched is the land, creation we will devour.
Fallen dominion shows blood of tears Look into their
eyes, they show fear.
Plunge my sword deep within their hearts.
Grace my steel with their blood.
Hatred and anger runs deep in my heart.
Wanting to be at peace, I miss the feelings.
Of happiness I once knew.
As far as I can see, a dream that's beyond my reality.
Watching the ever changing portals of life .
As we rage on and conquer Ungodly is our crusade,
death shall rise.
A feeling like no other, drifting through time.
Being free from all.
Triumph over those who have fled.
Left to die in the land of the dead.
Impale our swords within their hearts.
To tear and rip their soul apart.
The wind carry's the sent of the dead.
Can you see the blood of those who have fallen. The
one forgotten is left and forever rotten.
Only I remain.
The power I hold is thy hate.
And to banish the ones who deny.Dedicated to Julian May, author of "The Many Coloured Land(The Saga of the Exiles in the Pliocene epoch)
The rupture of the brain from flesh, children of the black.
Devouring mother, call her blessed, with impetus they lack.
Glorified spineless triumph, sick polluted mind.
Grusome child in void, evolution of humankind.
Operant child in unity. Unseen, unheard this day.
Floating mind is veiled in blood, the body is taken away.
Stripped of appendages, ungiven choice.
Awaiting intervention, mind without a voice.
Mentally amplify, cerebral lustrate.
Life after bodily death, brain without a face.
Black mother feeds the rancourous scorn, sinful propagate.
Metaphysically entity, redact, coerce, farsense, create.
Infinite years, immortality chained. Aeons herein encased.
Artificial, surrogate overt inhuman waste.
Divorced from purile emotion, hidden humanity,
Body, a cremated epitaph. Torso innutility.
Utterance of death's blessing. Funeral absent dream.
Muted in a voiceless uproar, deafened to hear her screams.
Banished to an exile life, prisoner of the brain.
Mind enhancer switches in, with unrelenting pain.
Bodiless mentally, The twisted saint began.
Spawned inside a sterile womb, nurturing the mental man.Dear Slim,
My favorite icon put the bong and the knife down
I'm sick of the songs about strapping your mom and your ex-wife down
To a nuclear bomb and dropping them on Saddam
Killing all the muses you use in almost all of your songs
Except those songs about Slim the Hip-Hoppian God
They make it seem you don't respect rappers like Biggie and Pac
Who if it weren't for them you be out of a job
Or flipping burgers with Ronald McDonald and not leading your mob
But the Blob's offensive, run and jumping the fences
And burying politicians in pop culture trenches
Dude, have some humility, oops responsibility, oops accountability, oops I said humility
Your face has covered worse magazines
than the artists and politicians you've mocked on every CD release
Ooh, how cool; you've proved you lack tact in your songs
In fact, you've grown up to act just like your mom
If y'all represent the truth and America's youth
Act like a leader we could actually use
You're a celebrity now, oh no, look what you did
You're America's role model but deny that you're it
Come on, come on, let's stand together as one
I ain't yelling about selling my soul, going to hell and back for platinum
Or gold to show the world is a gullible globe
Although, I can't respect the coalition of politicians signing petitions
Fearing Eminem's mission to bitch
When it's his right to taunt if he wants to fight
Even if you're frightened of what he might want to write
You're sworn to defend men, who offend men
Just because you believe in the first amendment
Even if it's illogical angst and vengeance
So defend your senses, but cleanse your dirty lenses
The law's written to both conservatives and leftists
It says Vanilla Ice Preservatives can be sexist
If y'all represent the truth and America's youth
Act like the leaders we could actually use
You're politicians now, oh no, look what you did
You're America's role models but deny art from our kids
Come on, come on, let's stand together as one
Censoring, the denial of actual words or factual things declared obscene
But molesting archdiocese, disease,
dead people in the streets from shooting sprees, epidemics
Paramedics clearing debris here and overseas aren't banned from TV
But yell shit, goddamn, or fuck hear three individual bleeps
A word's a word, let it be heard and learned
It's not the individual words but the order that hurts
Come on, come on, let's stand together as one
Come on, come on, stop threatening to censor our thoughts
And you'll get the response you want from now on
Come on, come onCloak me, surround me, I envision my own death
The path has reached it's end
And streams of gold promise nothing.
This is not time.
This is not time.
Birds know nothing of this, it is our vanity.
We create this death, we create this entity.
We have created death, Neptune is dead.
Come here, find me and be where you once belong.
No light, no dawn, always darkness.
Who will find me now that my soul has gone?
No light, no dawn, forever darkness.
The mammal meets the steel and litters this plastic ground,
The blue in the burst reminds me of something true.Le money il sur le table

For an imminent derangement
Life won't be able to handle
The psychological sickness
Encephalitis' treatments are unknown
In a perpetual sleep, they're swallowed
A decrease in all capacities
Mentally you're becoming obsolete
Infection in your brain, it creates
A slumber that no one can awake
Nailed in your chair, you're living dismally
Sudden rise of lucidity
Your wretched life is complete
As before, now you can see
Walk and talk normally
How long will i be
Saved from my disease?
Unexpected relapse into sickness
Brought you back to an everlasting sleep
Back in your chair, you're living dismally[Music & Words: KF]
Life for you it was not easy,
And at times was so unfair.
In a time when works was scarce,
Many burdens were yours to bear.
You bore the brunt of grief,
When Patrick left the earth.
Such a tragedy to happen,
To a child 4 months since birth.
When Husband Jack did lay,
Fore years in a hospital bed,
You were by his side relentlessly,
To help him through this dread.
You had no time for science,
Technology was not your friend.
You lived your life in black and white,
Until the very end.
You've gone now to that other place,
Your work on earth is done.
Jack is waiting there for you,
In his arms he holds your son.
We know it may be long,
Before we hear your voice again.
You will always be remembered,
Never forgotten - Susie Moran.Its stifled

You know shit.

born of fire and steel, before his burning eyes we kneel
we welcome our new master, we bow for the almighty
Infernal pain, only one way to stop it
but so many ways to die
He is a quiet easy construction,
built for our own satisfaction,
nowadays impossible to defeat
his kingdom greater than the universe

fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck
you fuck you!You put a gun to my head
The storm's too deep, outlook dead
Handing down that anger
Nothing good ever lasts
Moody violence, now a fool in my eyes
What's the answer, I'll search till I die
Try a little harder, I hear myself say
Make it last before it's taken away
Wading through the darkness
My head held in my hands
Wading through the darkness
Forced to forget this anguish
I'm half of what I used to be
Erase my memory, now gone forever, goodbye
But I know my memories won't die
Wading through the darkness
My head held in my hands
Wading through the darkness
Dead inside with a heart that bleeds
Relax, my tension needs, tightness suffocates
No longer churning inside, rotted memories inhabit my mind
My rage destroys the calm, destroys the calm
Wading through the darkness
My head held in my hands
Wading through the darkness
Wading through the darkness
Wading through the darkness

Snatch darkness from these hours
Devoid of evening and morning
Devoid of stars and funereal lightnings.
There is a path with no light and no moon
I ran through it to rescue my flesh
From the poisoned darts.
Modify your mind follow the shapes
From the red seven to the blue one
Mark the sacred space
In the name of wind and sound
Say your solemn prayer to the burning fire
Invoke the grace of water sources and raging oceans
Invite earth's creatures to your dance.
May Rafe lead my soul to victory
He's the master of my turbid game
May his energy bless my hand when I move the pieces
His power protects my secret plan
May his genius hasten the times
His presence secures my triumph.
Enemies' minds are frozen in a cloud of impotence
Their projects are sentenced to fail
No acts in the present, no acts in the future.
Now destiny is engraved on eternal memories.
Cosmic energies will spread it in the Universe.

The infection has been removed,
The soul of this machine has improved.
Look into my eyes
And tell me what you see.
Someone real, this is real,

You must never forget
To modernize performance.
Malignancies on the system
Will handicap, slow up and rust.

Gets to your mind, you feel like living life in sin
I know the struggle, but there's a remedy
Revolt is your salvation just come with me
Mutiny, mutiny on the world
Mutiny, mutiny on the world alright
You say the laws are getting harder to obey
And the rules are being broken everyday
You got the picture, and now your time has come
Anarchy is open season for everyone
Mutiny, mutiny on the world
Mutiny, mutiny on the world
That's what we said, now we're ahead
One more word out of you Mr. leader
And you'll be eating lead
Mutiny, mutiny on the world
Mutiny, mutiny on the world
Mutiny, mutiny on the world
Mutiny, mutiny on the worldBefore the break of dawn
Creeping through the night
Fallen bastards crawl
Onwards in delight
Flesh bloody flesh, rotten human prey
Flesh bloody flesh, longing for decay
Flesh bloody flesh, suffering to ease
Flesh bloody flesh, unbound to decease
Beyond the realms of death
Beside reality
Plunging into hollowness
Apart from misery
Below the spheres of hate
Soaked in streams of blood
Branded and defiled
Devotion to the vile
Silent wings of death, closing to embrace
Burning skulls of flesh, soon to be defacedI can't tell day from night anymore, I think I'm lost
I remember a time when I could see, with you in my sight
I can't forget it, but something's spreading in my head
How far can I go? Will it ever be too late?
All the pain inside, they put the poison in me
All the pain I saw, they put the poison in me
All the pain inside, they put the poison in me
All the pain I caused, poison in me
I saw everything they did
Somehow it seemed true
I took in everything they gave
Somehow it seemed true
How far can I go, 'til it's too late?
How far can I go, 'til it's too late?Everything will change this cosmic energy will rule over a destiny that waits somewhere between the light where the stars shine on up in the skies. Earth beyond the moon death as life's source. The beginning of the age where the secret of life is kept. An emerald laying in the middle of the lake. A place in the water where the flowers open their petals to the light. One symbol representing the cosmic cycles of life in order to make us rise. Earth beyond the moon death as life's source. The beginning of the age where the secret of life is kept. Everything will change this cosmic energy will rule over a destiny that waits somewhere between the light where the stars shine on up in the skies. Lost in the ignorance of existence a pale ray of light is saving us from the deepest dark and answering to all of us to those why.[Instrumental]Who am I at night when my eyes are closed tight?
Who am I and where when I see far beyond?
Every border, every dream, every hidden memory
Every nightmare, truth or dare
Who do I see
Now!
Look at me,
Tell me what you see
Are we just being everyone?
Where am I?
Tell me, would you go?
I should stay
Where am I, where am I?
And where should I go tonight?
Every night a different thing,
Every time you're in a different dream
Am I me there, what am I?
Who will I be
Now!
Look at me,
Tell me what you see
Are we just being everyone?
Look at me,
Tell me what you see
Are we being everyone?
I cry, I fall
I love, I hate
I know many, though no face ever stays
I breathe, I fly
I kill, I die
Though there's nothing that I know
No-one can recall where I have been or who I was
Look at me,
Tell me what you see
Are we being everyone?
Look at me,
Tell me what you see
Are we just being everyone?
Look at me,
Tell me what you see
Are we being everyone?A condeming fear strikes down
Things they cannot understand
An excuse to cover up weaknesses that lie within
Lies
Laying your guilt and pain
On people that had no part in the molding of a life
That creates its destruction
Lies
Right before your very eyes
A reflection of the mistakes
To the end you will deny
Your part in the demise of a life
Lack of comprehension
Thriving on your cliche
Compelled by self-resentment
[Solo: Schuldiner]
Reaching into the minds of those that created
The depression in which they
In which they drowned their flesh and blood
Lies
So easy to blame the
Everlasting fear on a pathetic attempt
To justify the ending of life
Lies
Right before your very eyes
A reflection of the mistakes
To the end you will deny
Your part in the demise of a life
Lack of comprehension
Thriving on your cliche
Compelled by self-resentmentShe's opening here eyes
To find the thing
By a touch she's lost
It's waiting for her a long time
The kingdom's lost
Cause there's one nail missing
Playing with fire
Turn of the light
And she'll fall down
Playing with her life
But she can't leave it
There's one rhyme in her brain
(lead: AndrÃ©)
Oh, last night and the night before
Tommyknockers, Tommyknockers
Knocked at your back door
Tommyknockers
The pain in my head
The cycle awakes
I'm on my way to Oz
I want to drink and she wants to dig
She's in trouble oh I know
There's something going wrong
Tommyknockers on their way
What's up in "Leighton Street"?
Oh, last night and the night before
Tommyknockers, Tommyknockers
Knocked at your back door
I'm the hero, I'm back
With weapons and with magic spells
I'll seddle every task
An old, ill and drunken guy
The moon is full of blood
I've found her not, not far from home
I should better get away from here
She's on her way to be another one
Playing with fire
She can read my thoughts
It's too late
Playing with her life
Tommyknockers brought her trouble
The ship in the earth I touch
A vibration is filling me
And music in my head
Nose is bleeding
And my fall down
Filled me up with pain
You'll be like a Tommyknocker
I'll be like you
But there's something going wrong
I read it in your face
Oh, last night and the night before
Tommyknockers, Tommyknockers
Knocked at your back door
Tommyknockers knocked at your back door
Tommyknockers knocked at your back door[no lyrics]Such A Bautiful Swansong

We're Burning Down In FlamesGloriole on your worm eaten head
Foul air escapes your lying mouth
Tyranny throughout the centuries of pain
Blinded zombies followed into the decline
Kneeling... in a stinking church
Crawling... before an image of god
Obliteration of adoration...
Burn the scriptures - fuck your obnoxious sermons
Shove the host - up your sanctimonious rectums
Son of stench - oppressor of vice
Castrated savior - king of imbecility
We press the thorns deeper into thy rancid body
Perennial torture - get raped by our sins...
Deride the martyrs of their crumbling dogmas
Devoted vermin poisoned with impurity
Shoot the servants of this rotten kingdom
Abomination is the wages idolatry
Shed the blood of christ - vomit upon the cross
Kneeling... crawling...
Praying... Dying...The line is being drawn through my heart
And we're conceiving fires through our thoughts
You're just like me
You're just like me
This is everything I wanted to tell you
I'm still in love with everything about you
I feel the wreckage from everything you do
And I'm tired of still waiting
If I told you the truth now
Would you still leave and take my heart?
But I still feel ugly and you're ugly just like me
Will I always lose this game?
This is everything I wanted to show you
I'm no longer scared of anything about you
I lived through the damage from the heart you took from me
And I'm tired of still waitingHold diamonds to the sun
Sparkling misconception
"We're the ones that aren't afraid to die", ashes
After this battle we laugh at the thought of innocence
"Remorse!", I scream for
Pride roses platinum gold rubies
A transparent portrait
The grave widens and the masses are mindlessly
Marching to the necropolis
There is no mystery here
Nothing to grasp but adjacent bodies
The cessation movement is synchronized
Emotional poorness cannot be hidden by ivory
We can't let this come between us, here I lie myself down
I surrender at what I've done, I'm ashamedHey Hey Hey
Hey Hey Hey
I know, I know, I know
In the cars or on the street
If you smile you are a creep
If you don't say it's very cold
You are drunk or too old

I say they've got a bloody cheek
Vanity and presumption

I know, I know, I know
And you're dying for a pee
So you go behind a tree

Say Hey Hey Hey
I know, I know, I knowHear a haunting chant
Lying in the northern wind
As the sky turns black
Clouds of melancholy
Rape the beams
Of a devoid dying sun
And the distant fog approaches
Coven of forgotten delight
Hear the pride of a northern storm
Triumphant sight on a northern sky
Where the days are dark
And night the same
Moonlight drank the blood
Of a thousand pagan men
It took ten times a hundred years
Before the king on the northern throne
Was brought tales of the crucified one
Coven of renewed delight;
A thousand years have passed since then
Years of lost pride and lust
Souls of blasphemy,
Hear a haunting chant
We are a blaze in the northern sky
The next thousand years are oursDresden dolls take one
This is for all you guys who work on industrial estates
Dresden dolls are back in style
With a clockwork walk and a backward smile
Dresden dolls don't hear a sound
They're programmed to jump up and down
Up and down
Round and round
Tapping feet to formless sound
Dresden dolls and Nazi boys
Dance arm in arm to formless noise
Up and down
Round and round
Tapping feet to formless sound
On plastic bars they sit and pose
Count their fingers with their toes
They sit and smile and drink and grin
Then they all get up again
Up and down
Round round
Tapping feet to noiseless sound
Dresden dolls are back in style
With a clockwork walk and a backward smile
Up and down
Pound and round
Tapping feet to formless soundAll my desire
Are the flames of the eternal fire
Strange winds of time
Killed the flames
Blew out all that was mine
My heart was, my soul was
Never ending source
Of devotion, and spirits
Unbroken force
Creation my hearts purpose
Devotion my souls bane
In the end it fades away
All my desire
Are the flames of the eternal fire
Strange winds of time
Killed the flames
Blew out all that was mine
His heart was, his soul was
Impending doom
Of desperation, and submission
Undying bloom
All that I tried to reach
An immortal bond
In the end it fades away
All my desire
Are the flames of the eternal fire
Strange winds of time
Killed the flames
Blew out all that was mine
All my trust, all my pain
Wasted hopes
Never will I hunger
For this again
Take this curse from me
Let me walk alone
In the end all fades away
All my desire
Are the flames of the eternal fire
Strange winds of time
Killed the flames
Blew out all that was mineAs I reach my arms to you
Warm summer rain,
Will we never, ever breathe again?
As is yours, reality
Warm summer rain,
Will we never, ever breathe again?[Cover : The Accused, Guest Vocals : Karl Willetts, Jan]

Je plaide non coupable pour l'insolence
Que tu me reproches en cas d'urgence
Je plaide non coupable pour la distance
Qui s'installe quand je me fais violence
Apprends me lire pour comprendre mes raisons
Notre avenir n'est plus qu'une douce illusion
Chorus
Et je lance un appel
Pour sauver l'essentiel
Et je lance un appel
Pour sauver l'essentiel
Je plaide non coupable pour mes silences
C'est sans doute mon systme de dfense
Apprends me dire ce qui te fait tant souffrir
A ragir pour attiser le dsir
Chorus
Je lance un appel
Pour un corps corps sans duel
Je plaide coupable pour mon indulgence
Envers tous mes dlits d'insouciance
Je plaide coupable pour mes errances
Et envers toi ma ngligence
ChorusAnd in the end I will show you that this life is only madness
Can we filter out the toxicity and find worth in the static
We build and build; we forget the model, we design the madness and we paint it gold
Swarming and spiraling burning at both ends
A blur on the horizon
We fail to keep site over and over again
Open your palms up resist the current
I am not your fathers son (lost in the static)
I am not your fathers son (lost in the static)
and you'll find me at the end
Come dig me up, wipe the earth from my bones
I am not your fathers son (lost in the static)
I am not your fathers son (lost in the static)
and you'll find me at the end
Come dig me up, wipe the earth from my bones
With pressure we creak and we bend. crimson feet trample our joints
We splinter and break. we suffer again
We become a path others use to take
A distant undertaking to suffer the same
I'll stand right beside you. we slog side by side
Become a path others use to take
Lost in the static
Just to suffer the same
Come dig me up, wipe the earth from my bones
Hold me up and join me on the horizon
Kill whats left of the inner glow
Giving up the ghost
Growing cold
We never begin
Our own feet trample our joints, we burn at both ends
A blur on the horizon
We become a path others use to take
A distant undertaking to suffer the same
I'll stand right beside you. we slog side by side
Lost in the static
We build and build we forget the model, we design madness and
Paint it gold
I am not your fathers son (lost in the static)
I am not your fathers son (lost in the static)
and you'll find me at the end
Come dig me up, wipe the earth from my bones
I am not your fathers son (lost in the static)
I am not your fathers son (lost in the static)
and you'll find me at the end
Come dig me up, wipe the earth from my bonesAwakened in ice near dead in a tub

Vive la vida![Instrumental]Un dia senti, pude ver luz en la oscuridad
y me encontre sentado en un trino de libertad
si sufrimos uno por otro
para que nos sirvio
si dejas que la pasion muera
no importara nada decir adios es...
tarde ya, tarde ya
para que el pacto siga en pie.
Mi camino seguire, ?acaso yo pude dar mas?
demasiado tarde ya.
Mi unica luz era el brillo de esos ojos,
y mi obsesion, nina, era verte feliz...
y ese dia me perdi.
Como ves aun estoy aqui
recordando que eras para mi
que mas da quien se alejo
si al fin perdio.
Nadie te dijo que iba a pasar
pequeno angel con ansia de libertad es...
tarde ya, tarde ya
para que el pacto siga en pie, mi camino seguire
palabras que ya no dicen nada
demasiado tarde ya.
Nadie nos dijo que iba a pasar
te quiero pero ahora es tarde ya
tarde ya, tarde ya
para que el pacto siga en pie.
Mi camino seguire, ?acaso yo pude dar mas?
demasiado tarde ya.[Instrumental]Graveyard wind's hard blowing
Scents of bliss and sweet decay
Saint and devil are roaming
Where truth is never made
Emptiness is everywhere
Gloomy void surrounds me
I'm here to be found
But this thing will never be...
will never be
East and West dwelling as ever
Good and Evil hate each other
Don't try to break this measure
Love and Hate with one
another
Emptiness is everywhere
Gloomy void surrounds me
I'm here to be found
But this thing will never be...
will never be
Will never be...Ich kleiner Gram, "Ich sei willkommen", maltratiert mich leid,
blol badend, blutig rot in Artefakten, Fischlachen ohre farbesgleichen,
penibel nicht wie einst und angesaugt mit Wassers Kernsabstanz, Ich?
Scheusal ohne Hals im Nacken, krauche, schleiehe kleine/grole Zacken,
mit Bucket schwer und ungelenk ich schwane num mein Lebensend.
Linde kerben Kafer, zerfleischen und vergitten, vergiften all das Lichte,
all das Lichte hier im Raum zum Dunkel, blol fur mein subtiles Denken,
wie dunne/dicke Streifen und Belage, Schatten und Gesprenkel, uberall,
auf Zahnen, Fulen und Gezeit, mein kleiner Sandmann schielend rotierte -
den Augsatelliten - sal ruhrend am Vogelbeerbaum und warf mir Freund
ein Kerzenliedchen in den Lebensschlaf, Vergal er's doch zu singen...
"Dein Boden, ein falsches Scharmutzel,
er friert sich zum Ziel DeinerScheelsucht,
weil hortest verdorben die Stimme der Klagen,
still schwand das Pegel im steigenden Luftmeer.
Wie hoch springt das kleinste Kartoffelkaferchen?
Und wie hoch springt das grolte in funf 1/4 Stundlein?"
Ich frage mich Pygmae, das Beben und Bewegen,
dies totgemeinte Regen in der Insektburst,
es schleudert hier mit Leumund dreist und keek befleckt mit Schatten dort.
So dacht' ich hold in Fessel, Leich' ich bleib' so lang ich nicht verwes',
und gelb, rot, grun, mein Sandmann wurd' zum kleinen Bettelmann...

(lead: Cederlund)
the hollow sky is red
the race is on
faces are all dead
the race is on.
It's just a matter of time
(lead: Hellid)
Bedrooms are tombs
cradles are coffins
tears I cannot shed.
a matter of time
a matter of slugs
til' the rats are fed.
Who examines the doctors!
I'm the hollow man
It's just a matter of bullets
in hollow brains
as I wander slowly
thru bullet rains
My hollow eyes
are staring down the hole.
jesus, satan, hitler
bought my soul.
It's rotten and sour
but it's inside of me.
I got faith in the end
but you just can't see.Music: Mikael Dahl - Lyrics: Mikael Dahl
When darkness enters my life,
that's when you arise
Slowly crawling into my mind
from the other side
In a callous realm, I'm captured,
completely paralysed
Through your eyes I see the real world,
where love and hate have died
Pre Chorus
I'm terrified, but somehow I have always known
We are nothing but wandering spirits in an endless void
Chorus
On the edge of time I face my destiny,
and find myself within a false reality
Was my life a lie inside an evil whirl?
Oblivion reign within the Visionary World,
forever
Solo Dahl
Bridge
Lifeless, impassive and alone
Dreaming a dream that's not my own
Am I alive or dead?
When did they conquer our kind?
Why did they take control of our minds?
My past is erased and gone
I'm lost in a cage
Created in the age of silence and illusions
ChorusA bottle of whiskey in my hand is like a fucking gun against my head
Just waiting to go off
So let's go
Come on
It's our curse on this road
This is what we all live for
A new will to begin
Armed with a license to sin
We're back at it again
Stay out of my fucking way
Stay out of my fucking way
Did I take the right path?
I don't know, but I'm lovin' everything
All the hearts that I have broken
All the lies I've left unspoken
It's time to move on and just walk away
But in the end we'll be okay
And I'll be the one to blame
It's time to move on and just walk away
Fuck yeah
You might be the first for the evening
But you sure ain't the last
Another temporary lover whose lovin' never lasts
It's rock and roll and we love it that way
Did I take the right path?
I don't know, but I'm lovin' everything
All the hearts that I have broken
All the lies I've left unspoken
It's time to move on and just walk away
But in the end we'll be okay
And I'll be the one to blame
It's time to move on and just walk awayThere once was a girl who lived in a fairy tale
A prince came along and gave her a golden veil
He said you're a bird of painted glass
And he took her in his grasp
He brings the rain down
He took her away
Carried her off in the night
Built her a cage to keep her from taking flight
And when she tried to ask him why
Storm clouds seemed to fill his eyes
He brings the rain down
Look at us now
I've been wondering how you can live with yourself
don't you see that your nightingale' s bleeding
She took all of your rage and she's broken the cage
and she's leaving
We're birds made out of broken glass
We glitter while the daylight lasts

Trapped in a dream
insidious machines
Dictate reality
Evolution placed on hold
Degeneration overload
Mentally decayed the brain withers away
Annihilating a population plagued by ignorance
the military stands by
fire fills the sky
all you had to do was look
alittle common sense it took
the signs were plain to see
future catastrophe
Think for yourself!
Defy ignorance
Think for yourself
Escape
Think for yourself
Defying disgrace

Defy Death
Human control experiments
self mutilation, shock therapy
Digital codes hypnotize
Destroying the mind, Entertaining Disguise
surgical tools cut through the brain
young girl cries out in pain
innocence is no excuse
data stored for future use.you arms that take
your arms invertebrate
venomous,constricting and cold
blood warms to life
tongue flickers in time
vibrations awaken your soul
the mind sheds away
you circle, break,swerve and stay
you stare so deep ,you rise so tall
you gently sway,your silhouette writhes and plays
its poison up on the wall
drumming hearts they sync and then slow
you whisper songs of peace and of home
whisper promise though don't show what you see
when those black diamonds stare straight through to me
flicker in time
gently entwine
daggers slide sharper than pain
rise up,around
liquid and vapor
a warmth that creeps up through my veins
now is your time
and ive walked this line
while you slid down deep in my soul
i fade away as you breathe your song heavy
and i take my show on the road
slide on black racer,slide on.Out on the wiley, windy moors
We'd roll and fall in green.
You had a temper like my jealousy:
Too hot, too greedy.
How could you leave me,
When I needed to possess you?
I hated you. I loved you, too.
Bad dreams in the night.
They told me I was going to lose the fight,
Leave behind my wuthering, wuthering
Wuthering Heights.
Heathcliff, it's me--Cathy.
Come home. I'm so cold!
Let me in-a-your window.
Heathcliff, it's me--Cathy.
Come home. I'm so cold!
Let me in-a-your window.
Ooh, it gets dark! It gets lonely,
On the other side from you.
I pine a lot. I find the lot
Falls through without you.
I'm coming back, love.
Cruel Heathcliff, my one dream,
My only master.
Too long I roam in the night.
I'm coming back to his side, to put it right.
I'm coming home to wuthering, wuthering,
Wuthering Heights,
Heathcliff, it's me--Cathy.
Come home. I'm so cold!
Let me in-a-your window.
Heathcliff, it's me--Cathy.
Come home. I'm so cold!
Let me in-a-your window.
Ooh! Let me have it.
Let me grab your soul away.
Ooh! Let me have it.
Let me grab your soul away.
You know it's me--Cathy!
Heathcliff, it's me--Cathy.
Come home. I'm so cold!
Let me in-a-your window.
Heathcliff, it's me--Cathy.
Come home. I'm so cold!
Let me in-a-your window.
Heathcliff, it's me--Cathy.
Come home. I'm so cold!Saw six men
Under a tall tower

Like I'm breakin it to you, gently
The nice people
Will remind you, oh yeah
Kicking, white, cheerleader
When the tired cheerleader
Lucifer over Lancashire
The black girls
Shake the hedges
On this the hottest day for ages
Was that monsoon
Doctor had the needle
Can't obey his [...]
No longer
Lucifer over Lancashire
I tell you no lies
Completely blind
Are the sentinel's eyes
At the back of his mind
Those people screamed
The people screamed
He took over everywhere
And this place
Now over here
And it's time he move on
His cock-eyed moon
And useless prayers
Now I'm just flyin
I'm flyin
I'm typin
I'm shinin
I'm winnin
I got this on
I'm a runnin shark
I'm winnin
I'm shinin...[Instrumental]I'm sensing the paleness of lies
No rest to caress their eyes
In visions enthroning sleep
A mistress of eternal weep
Wastelands against the night
Bound in chains, a wish for light
Wandering beneath my fate my body slowly pales
Unleashed, with hands that cannot reach
The screams of heaven and shores
The sleep - sound of a shadowed search
Foresee the wings of solitude
The wings of solitude
Ages of bleeding in vain
Entrapped by the whine of the insane
Civilization - a vision of deceit
Misfits, emerged from the heat
The violet dances fade
Restless dreams of hate and a silent cry
Wastelands against the night
Bound in chains a wish for light
Wandering beneath my fate
My body slowly pales[Van Drunen / Van Drunen, Daniels]
Two religions both so wrong
but both will preach they'll make you strong
one means evil, the order good
terms I never quite understood
two opponents with so much in common
the choice is yours, angel or demon
Holy or unholy, written in black and white
theories coming from books of dirty lies
different views on life, the magic word is fear
two sides simplicity. Am I satan? Am I God?
Idolatry that's floating on rivers filled with blood
history covered with hypocrisy and pain
the souls of unawareness are what they want to gain
Sacrifices, ceremonies, desecrations
tranquility, blasphemy, desperation
divinity, impiety, indoctrination
afterlife, eternity, mind consumption
Food for the ignorant
for those who do not know
but I learned enough in life
to see right through your show
Hold your flock in a sacred embrace
forbidden pleasures for the bastard race
glorification on the supreme mind
suffering redeemer, saviour of mankind
hollow words from a church that's almost dead
empty views out of an empty satanic head
I get sick from hearing all your shit
I believe what I want and I'll stick to it
no one in this world can make me change my ways
why don't you fuck off if you're got nothing to sayI'm far away from home
I've traveled the world
From town to town
And even when I feel alone
Every stage feels like I'm coming home
A tribute to the faithful
You were always true
A tribute to all kindred souls
Here's to you!
This is your song!
This is our song!
We're coming home
Where we belong
This is your song
This is our song
We're flesh and bone
So sing along
You're not just a face in the crowd
You're motivation
You're gold
Four words from a thousands lips
We are the apocalypse
A tribute to the faithful
You were always true
A tribute to all kindred souls
Here's to you!
This is your song!
This is our song!
We're coming home
Where we belong
This is your song
This is our song
We're flesh and bone
So sing along
Straight from my heart
Here's to you
I promise you
Here and now
As long as I breathe
I won't let you down
I promise you
Here and now
With my heart and soul
we'll never bow down
Let's go
This is your song!
This is our song!
We're coming home
Where we belong
This is your song
This is our song
We're flesh and bone
So sing along
Straight from my heart
Here's to you
Here's to youLie upon the lie.
And it all comes down to this
That a pig is a pig is a pig is a pig.
And they want to rule the world, but they can't have me.
'cause I don't need this body.
I see the line traced back to my ancestors
And I hold on tight to that line
Which is before the fear induced religions that separated the world
And the one world government and the one world banking system
Through the world bank that issued the monetary illusion of ownership
And dealt it to the masses which caused a separation from that
knowledge
That knowledge and that connection to each other and to the earthWon't You listen all You pretty boys
in magazines You look like plastic toys
Superstars of rock You just pretend
a blasphemy that never seems to end
Ugly bastard, You think You look good
but there are things You never understood
with lipstick and mascara in your hand
'bet You're not even sure You're a man
now listen;
Hairdryer soldiers marching out to war
can't you see Yourself, You're such a bore
Why don't You all just lie down and die?
The world's a mess and You're the reason whyOnce more I'll say goodbye to you
Things happen but we don't really know why
If it's supposed to be like this
Why do most of us ignore the chance to miss?

Torn apart at the seams of my dreams turn to tears

[This is an unreleased, typical, and strong poem of the Great Beast.]Observe the change.
Australian's thoughts are rearranged into the past.
The populous is telling me, hope you enjoy the backward journey.
Tolerance is only shown when the dollar can be grown.
We're going back to fighting wars for our politician's cause.
With saddened eyes I have observed.
Acceptance fall away to dust.
I'm moving backwards as I take a step forth.
The winds of hate are blowing strong in my world.
It all affects you and I.
Next generation pays the price.
All this hatred is tearing us down, as we ignore our own advice.
Now we're finding as we move into the past.
Who are we fooling?
Good things never last.
Accept the difference, between you and I.
Bring on extinction of the human kind.
The is a backward journey.You see the chaos in the streets
You feel your world is ending
So much violence has begun
Nowhere to turn your hope is gone
Yes there is something you can do
To pull you through the last days
Oh yes it's true believer
Take up arms and fight

You told me you could fly, I've never seen you fly
Tearing yourself to pieces
Tearing yourself apart
What are you trying to prove?
Who are you trying to prove it to?
Hiding your self destruction
Hiding yourself away
Showing everyone around you
Such a different face
You've got gear and loathing
You've got all the self abuse
And you think you caught it
From someone you almost knew
You have lost all your chances
You have lsot all your days
You can always find
Someone you'd rather blame
Decided that you would fall down
You know that it's all your fault
But still you try to make someone responsible
You don't need the things you want
You're always so confused
You don't want the things you need
Just what's wrong with you?
Tell yourself a lie, you will live a lie
Told me you could fly, I've never seen you fly
Told me you could die, I've never seen you die

No expectations
Courage of despair
Annihilated wisdom
Belligerence declared
It's all illusion
Life's tragedy
No comprehension
Beyond infinityBreath deep
The scent of memories
Hidden in the smoke
And the subtle hint of cellophane
In the photographs you took
I sit alone with inspiration thrown across
Pages and versus of guillotine books
That line the case in the room
The place on the floor
Where we cautiously combust
An attempt to show our lust
To the life that we lost
If I do this nothing will ever be the same
If you don't you will regret it with every breath you take
Please god, is there any other way?
Breath deep
The scent of your deceit
Hidden in the smoke you will question the act
And what I have done
The chapters will burn at four,fifty one
As I bury the past
With each strike of the match
If I do this nothing will ever be the same again
If you don't you will regret it with every breath you take
Please god, is there any other way?
That's just an illusion god is not here today
If I do this nothing will ever be the same again
If you don't you will regret it with every breath you take
Please god, is there any other way?
Please god, is there any other way!
That's just an illusion god is not here todayMinnenes ekko stiller timen
Kneblet i tungsinnets lenker faller jeg ifra
Ikke lenger vil jeg vre boltet fast i vemodighetens anker
Men endelig f lengselen slukket - Etter dra
Drakk jeg for meget av livhpets krus
Tok jeg gledens forfengelighet for gitt
For min strid mot tomhetens smerte - Denne ddsangstens rus
Er det eneste ene igjen - Som er mitt
I min ensomhet vet jeg likevel
At jeg ikke har noen andre takke enn meg selv
Derfor er jeg rolig nr
Repet strammes rundt min nakke
Stumme vitner kan ei gi trst
Menigmann i gravkorets forsamling vil aldri fatte
Det landet av fortapelse
Jeg egenhendig skapte
Denne intense dragning mot ddens portaler
En vandrende studie i grtkvalt messe-noir
Behersket siden tidenes morgen
Men noe jeg aldri lot slippe taket - Var sorgen
I min ensomhet vet jeg likevel
At jeg ikke har noen andre takke enn meg selv
Derfor er jeg rolig nr
Repet strammes rundt min nakke
English translation (Excuse me if any writing errors. The text is quite difficult)
The echoes of the memories silences the hour
Gagged in the heavy mind's chains i fall away
No longer I wan't to be bolted stuck to the anchor of sadness
But finally get the longing 'put out' - After leaving
Drank I too much of the cup of (life)hope
Took I the joy of vanity for granted
Beacause my battle against the emptyness' pain - This death anxietys intoxication
Is the only thing left - That is mine
In my solitude I know anyway
That I have no other to thank but myself
That's why I'm calm when
The rope is tightened around my neck
Mute witnesses can not give comfort
The common man in the funerals choir gathering will never see
The land of the lost
I with my own hands created
This intense drag towards death's portals
A walking studie in choked weeped service (as in church)
Ruled since the dawn of time
But something I never let go of - Was the sorrow
In my solitude I know anyway
That I have no other to thank but myself
That's why I'm calm when
The rope is tightened around my neckBorn into oblivion
Without the fear of existing all alone
Later comes the acquisition, forced upon
The solitude now loneliness
The god now submerged in a game of guilt
Psychopathic shepherds
Deny the miracle of our essence
And yet we have part in the blame
Allowing their ravings
Comforting their weakness, their sickness
It is time to live
Trust no one
Recognize black
Recognize white
Recognize shadows
I am with gods
Black, white, shadows, gods
Recognize black
Recognize white
Recognize shadows
I am with gods
Traitors want to keep you down
Rise up from the ground
No one steals what no one owns
No one steals what no one owns
Disown and distance
Strong is she who realizes
Ethics built on sacrifice
Strong is she who realizes
Ethics built on sacrifice
No one steals what no one owns
One by one by one
Strong is she who realizes
Ethics built on sacrifice
No need for companionship
Back into the silence, silence
It is all it needs
Desolation
Alone in birth
Alone in darkness
Alone in death
Alone in the daylight
One with reality
Shaped by the inner glow
Determination, I
All can be reached from within
All can be reached from within
Born into oblivion
Without the fear of existing all alone
Later comes the acquisition forced upon
The solitude, now loneliness
The God now submerged in a game of guilt
Psychopathic shepherds
Deny the miracle of our essence
And yet we have part in the blame
Allowing their ravings
Comforting their weakness, their sickness
It is time to live
Trust no one
Recognize black
Recognize white
Recognize shadows
I am with godsbreaking off the part of me that lets things fade away, shaking of the certainty of this bitter ending, you calculate this mess, two years deep, it's just as far now, i'm failing every test, to feel this cheap, it's just as far down, you wanted everything from me, you've taken everything from me, i've come to terms with this, two years past, it's just as far now, no need left to persist, nothing lasts, it seems so far down, you wanted everything from me, you've taken everything from me, wake up and see where you are nowIt woke up in me I asked softly
Leave me alone with a gun on my own
My other self is injected in me
Fatal invention, I had to be
With empty hands, no fear, no pain
Neverending function wounded brain
Infectious creature makes me sleepy
Reality disappears into mistery
The innocent eyes wake me up,
But the deadly dream enervates...
Immobile mutilated bodies
Never will find the forgotten peace
The earth quenches with blood its thirst
Tears on the faces burn and hurt
It's not my blame, I'm innocent
I am a part of a program
Jungle fight rules my mind
Maybe it will be never over
Close to me - Perfectly
I am a - Killing MachineGenesis now we're to stay
Our evelution stunted Earth betrayed
Trapped inside this mortal cage
Repelling masses now your soul's in rage
You're all Guilty as charged...
Guilty as charged
Eyes of fire stare into space
Carcass showing shadows grey
Living in the final age
You're falling in, in the hands of fate
You're all Guilty as charged...
Guilty as charged
In the beginning the universe fell
Emanating the formula DNA the fraction 2/3rds
The number 23
Now we have one Adam and Eve before the jury of the Council
And she's been given her final verdict
Guilty as charged
Now you've become one of them
Nobody cares at all they'll never win
Lakes of fire forged in hate
Prepared for, for the skeptics race
You're all Guilty as charged...
Guilty as chargedThe silence of the moment
Reveals a cry for help
Despondent eyes of sorrow
Cast a lonely spell
Hiding in the corner
Looking at the world
[Chorus]
Divinity of right
Start to loose sight
Hold on to yourself
What do you see
As you start to fall
Makes no sound at all
Falling to the ground
Oh so free
Looking through a window
Gasping for some air
Spirits wander freely
Tied down to a chair
Shadows of confusion
Makes sinners of us all
[Chorus]I know the clock's are running slow
And we'll get there in the end
Still flows the river's running low
You're the needle stuck in my vein
I know there's gonna come a time
When you're gonna turn round on me
I know there's gonna come a time
When you're wanting to be free
We fly
I know the clock's are running slow
And that look is in your eye
I know there's gonna come a time
When the thought gets in your mind
I know there's gonna come a time
When you're gonna turn round on me
I know there's gonna come a time
When you're going to believe
We fly alone
The sky's my home
You wait for me
Where I am
I know the clock's are running slow
And the look is in your eye
By now I should've realized
That the thought is in your mind
I know there's gonna come a time
When you're gonna turn round on me
I know there's gonna come a time
When you're going to be freeInstrumentalHear me Doom-bringers
Pale-bleak spawn of Hel
Await the seething tide...
As a venomous omen
An eagle pecks at the dead
Its beak dripping blood...
At dusk death will dawn
Denoument hoist the sail
Skin and nail prevail...Destroy me (x2)
My will if you can
Distance me (x2)
From control of your hand
Break tradition
Break away
Fuck tradition
It dies today
Distance me from traditional society
Carve the layer from your skin
That coats all that which we see
Break tradition
Break away
Fuck tradition
It dies today.[Verse I]

A food that the chosen need
Flowing energy that must be absorbed
While the vampire feeds
The human species is its source
That's why they were bred
Immortals search for the taste of "The Blood"
So that they may be fed
Little by little victims are drained
To quench the savage thirst
Being careful not to take too much
For their tiny minds will burst
This precious power within the flesh
Is our living key
Lost children of the temple's brood
Soon you all shall see
Lifeforce, lifeforce
Lifeforce, lifeforce
Those who understand the pleasures of the drink
Shall realize the magick it possesses
And those who don't will never understand
Because they are not of our kind
Blessed be the blood!Walls of Isengard
Face the northern winds
Carved black pillars
Rising high up to the sky
Arcane relic
Crowned by the four peaks
Feels the auturnn breeze
From the fields of steeds
Orthanc, The Cunning Mind
Great Fang, Forked Height
Many narties for this towering sight
Sight as black as a night
Tall, black tower
Home for the Palantiri
Lair for the crystal globe
Foresight of might
Wizard so pale and old
Guarding the elven stone
He did not realise
The shadowed gaze of lies
Armies of new orc tribe
Marching as the Uruk-hai
Created by corrupted mind
Mind of Saruman the White
The war began and he almost won
Brave horsemen of Rohan
Anger of woods he did not see
Ents arrived, his enemyCome forth for the cattle call
Confront the evil river you can't control
Wicked ways and venomous eyes
Just human nature in disguise
Lost in this world, out on the edge
With death by our sides
Today I sworn that I wouldn't mourn ya
Clouds over California
If that's the way it's gonna be
I'm a saint in sinners eyes
Curse the clouds over California
This is the call to obey
Let the chaos reign
Bloodshot and weary-eyed
We took you in full of sin and pride
It'll take you and break you away
It'll tear you apart
Today I swore I wouldn't mourn ya
Clouds over California
If that's the way it's gonna be
I'm a saint in sinners eyes
Curse the clouds over California
This is the call to obey
Let the chaos reign
I'm a saint in sinners eyes
Curse the clouds over California
This is the call to obey
Let the chaos reign
If that's the way it's gonna be
I'm a saint in sinners eyes
Curse the clouds over California
This is the call to obey
Let the chaos reign
I'm a saint in sinners eyes
Curse the clouds over California
This is the call to obey
Let the chaos reignThis day comes to soon, one more life I must consume
One more life I need to gain the freedom that I seek
Led through the tunnels and labyrinths so deep
Prisoners and slaves encircling me
I am but one, one of the same
When the sun sets this all shall change
We who are about to die, we salute you
We who are about to die, we salute you
Five men in, one leaves
Today there will be no mercy
Lust for blood grows strong
Not from me but ones watching on
We who are about to die, we salute you
We who are about to die, we salute you
Catching the gleam of a childs glad eye
Cheering and laughing while watching them die
In the arena of death they shall fall
To the delight and enjoyment of all
Verbera strike deaths blow
The last ones my hands shall know
Triumph I have seen another triumph there will not beFrom beyond all paths of man I drew my rules
Infamous among gods and low I did fall
And the earth hath cried aloud
Hark! For enraged winds and storms now awaken
Now see me naked, yet draped in flames
My pent fury to unleash upon men
Of chaos I am, the disobedient one
Depraved son who hath dwelt in nothingness
Upon the ninth I fell, from grace up above
To taste this life of sin, to give birth to the "I"
I didst create demigods, strong in will and deed
That they may stand proud and call out thy names
How dare thou cross the paths of mine
And leave my fallen sons behind
Oh, I shall feast in Gutter, as king of nothing
I shall feed on thee, the Mightiest One
Behold! For I am Him!
Life giving flower that belongst to the dawn

Pray
KneelWhen the first simple cells, Met the first rays of light.
Carbon beings in process, Leading to the life that we have today.
A billion years later, technology springs. Exploding progress pushes us forward.
But exploding progress is tearing us down.
What is fiction is fact, There is no blame for conditioning.
Reality's created by ourselves, We're to blame for our problems.
Cells of our shells, merge with the earth, Becoming separately involved.
Composting, transgressing. In order to embrace life and death.
We must eliminate, the boundaries that lie between the Physical and spiritual.
Symbiosis, a two way process. People read their lives and then create their psychosis.
Staying conscious requires effort, Evolution reawakens primal subconscious.
Aware - Awake - Alert Known or felt by ones inner being.
Flow and flower Observer, and observed. A wave, infinite ocean.
Life and death in cyclic motion. You are a human being.
You have an ego and mind It's a useful part of you But it's not you.They are in my head...
Spasm and cerebral tortures
Inspired to macabre illusions
Wisdom versus madness such a mental inquisition
This is the art of schizophrenia
They are in my head...You won't have to wait in line
Watch them wheel her in
All she can see is white
face down on a mattress
hurry doctor young, won't want to miss the party
Ankle films are back on cupid
a singing telegram slipped on some ice
we need a doc in radiology
inject an IV contrast
a patient named jones
BP's 50 over 70, BP's 90 over 50, pluse is 120
Pupils fixed and dilated she's beginning to flat line
she's not going to make it
i can feel your heart stop
change the paddles to 15: CLEAR
we need a bandage to stop the bleedingHonor abide
Choice of words
That I speak today
Consequent evidence
Now they put astray
Conflicts forever halt
Wipe resentment clean
No thoughts of decadence
Life is now serene
I've foreseen
You're now fortified
Take the highest point
Drive it in your side
Keen are they
Who feel the conqueror
Truth of the heart
Or peace will fall apart
Again it's none for this
None for that, can we share alike
Positive identity
Creates the oversight
Never erase the light in man
No more blockades
Warfare for at last
Are to soon about to fade
I've foreseen
You're now fortified
Take the highest point
Drive it in your side
Keen are they
Who feel the conqueror
Truth of the heart
Or peace will fall apart
It's taken years to mend
Can't take the high hell
Can't change the way they feel
Honor abide
Choice of words
That I speak today
Warfare for at last
Are soon about to fade
I've foreseen
You're now fortified
Take the highest point
Drive it in your side
Keen are they
Who feel the conqueror
Truth of the heart
Or peace will fall apart
Again
It's doneI am the wanderer, I am the lie
I bring famine, and I kill all life
I sweep across the land
I walk the dead earth
The children shall Endure
I am as old as time
I am of lust and sin
I am invoked by bloodthirst
I rule the underworld
The children shall Endure
And to be remembered,
Silent screams are never heard
I am mystery, I am truth
I am the tale you wished you never heard
My dark shadow dwell
In the darkest pits of hell
I am the propechy of a dying world
I am vengeance, I am wrath
I am the seven Death sins
Come walk my pathI hear their poisonous words again
As they call out for submission and code
"To be less than one and drown equals pride" they say
These were the voices that destroyed us
Did I want for this loss to be sustained?
Through the clipping of wings found the secret paths
From the blinding light of lies obtained second sight
Stabbed in the back, gained strength in One-ness
Taken from me, I learned to preserve
These were the voices that sunk our ships
These are the voices - poisoned ears bleeding
Did I pray for the dead to be kept awake?
Did I gently place these thorns through the surface of my eyes?
Did I ask for this fathomless tragedy to go on forever?
Fail to comply - reborn in war
The answer being no
Did I?(Music by Bartsch/Matton/Landfermann December 1995)
(Poems by Bartsch December 1995)
Christus, du blasse Knigin des geronnenen Blutregens
ersticke an der Allmacht meines todbringenden
Vermchtnisses
welches zu Sensen geformt
der Auferstehung letzter Hand sein wird.
Begraben in der erlauchten Ausdnstung von Gier & Shne
erliegt mein Schrecken des dritten Kreuzes
der sen Verlockung eines unsauber schmeckenden
Grableinens
Blut
Oh Du, mein unsauber' Fleisch
vergilbe im Jetzt
tte das Morgen
Verheiung letzter Moloch
dem Grabe zugefhrt
vergib mir meine Ble
Blut
Heuchler im Ich
geboren aus Zerfall
aus der Anarchie
aus totem Fleisch
Erlsung
vergib mir meinen Schrein
vergib mir meine Seele
Schwrze
die verbotenen Zeilen
und immer nur der Tod
der ungestillte Durst
der kupferne Geruch
das berstende Inferno
doch wo bleibe ich
bleibt die Jungfrulichkeit
bleibt der Glaube
an die sich windende Flamme
meiner animalischen Blasphemie
Blut
du geschwrzte Hoffnung
meines jngsten Gerichts
das sterbende Ich
geborgen in blutbeflecktem Tuch
geborgen in gar ewig' Ruh'
Verloren
gar ewiglich verloren
schreite in deinen Tod
denn wisse,
wo die Dunkelheit herrscht
bin ICH.
(english translation)
Thorn Of My Omnipotence
(Music by Bartsch/Matton/Landfermann December 1995)
(Poems by Bartsch December 1995)
Christ, thou pale queen of the clotted bloodrain
Suffocate in the omnipotence of my death-bringing
heritage
that, shaped like a scythe,
will be the last hand to the resurrection
Buried in the noble evaporation of greed and penance
My horror of the third cross yields
to the sweet temptation of an unpure tasting
little grave
Blood
Oh thou, my unpure flesh
turn yellow in the present
kill the tomorrow
promise of the last dwelling
brought to the grave
forgive my nakedness
Blood
Hypocrite in me
born of decay
of anarchy
of dead flesh
Deliverance
forgive me my shrine
forgive me my soul
Blackness
The forbidden lines
and always only death
the unquenched thirst
the copper scent
the bursting inferno
yet where will I be
will be the virginity
will be the faith
of the writhing flame
of my bestial blasphemy
Blood
thou blackened hope
of my final judgement
the dying me
secured in a bloodstained cloth
secured in very eternal peace
Lost
eternally lost
stride into your death
For know,
where darkness reigns,
I am.The tears suspend.
Smiles are not more than (empty love)
Locked doors can keep you alone
Forever paint words (from your lips) in a house that's no longer your home
Take the dreams I know (as my own) and it worsens weekends
Thanks again for my misery. And you run with fake friends
I'm sick of your sad songs and sing alongs.
I kind of like it when things are wrong.
Straight from left end,
They'll shout corrections,
And I'll decline, I'll decline
A source of comfort or some protection
And I'll decline
Smiles are not more than (empty love)
Locked doors can keep you alone
Forever paint words (from your lips) in a house that's no longer your home
Take the dreams I know (as my own) and it worsens weekends
Thanks again for my misery. And you run with fake friends
I'm sick of your sad songs and sing alongs.
I kind of like it when things are wrong.
Straight from left end,
They'll shout corrections,
And I'll decline, I'll decline
A source of comfort or some protection
And I'll decline
In your throat
You will see
Surface relocated
Therapy.
All I taste of today
Is the shame (of) my whore prety
All I know are apologies
Do you feel the shame?Lost amongst the crowd
On the torso's pumping iron
A man with a horn takes to the stage
The drum beat cracks in time
Harder and bolder the bodies move
Shoulder to shoulder skin feels smooth
Hot, sticky, still so cool
The crash of the anvil and the nightclub school
Watch the moving bodies
As they react to the sound
Feasting on the visions
See the figures going round
Graceful and flowing the fashion shows
Sensual and glowing the passion grows
Pick your playmate still so cool
The crash of the anvil and the nightclub school
Take it as it comes up
Leave it when it's done
Put a number in your matchbook
And call when you want fun
Living the nightlife to the end
Giving the right life like a friend
One more rover still so cool
The crash of the anvil and the nightclub school
Ah Nightclub School
Dance with me
Ah Nightclub School
Play with me
Ah Nightclub School
Stay with me
Ah Nightclub School
Ride with me
Ah Nightclub School
Have fun with me
Ah Nightclub School
Dance with me
Ah Nightclub School
The drumbeat cracks in timeEvery day I see your face
Every day I die
Every day I feel your breath
Every day I'm born again
You give me joy, but my thanks are just pain
And out of fear I pull myself loose again
For you I die
You are everything I need, what I desire,
But will I ever understand?
Come on!
I die for you
Please forgive my faults, maybe one day I will realize what you mean (to me),
I hope it won't be too late
Every time I cry,
I feel your lies
Every time I die,
I see your eyesWe loaf around the fireplace
War-weary and calm
We watch the sunrise motionless
The war has been won
(repeat)
We hear melodies unsung
Mesmerized...
We survived - but why?
A new beginning - for what?
Too cooled down to move
We just stare and lay back to die
The holocaust is over - victory
All is dead - burnt debris
Everlasting silence - we reached peace of mind
We just stare and lay back to dieThey measure him by his blood-shot eyes
They measure him by his thick disguise
Those nights of doubt and loneliness
Inside the thoughts never rest
The jest, the pomp and the circumstance
Won't fill the void nor soothe his sense
He wears his secret like a cloak
Truth makes it harder to cope
By the most enlightened matter
I'll have your mind in the grip of my hand
You despise what's on your platter
Wish for a change, dreams will have bound you
Make peace with all you ever knew
Make peace with all you ever do
Make peace with it all
I won't let you fall
Nailed down hope and with fingers crossed
Pick up the dreams that were nearly lost
Race for home and trusting arms
The antic has forsaken the farce
When they shake him awake again
Torn from the calm by a judging hand
The daylight's hard when the mind's not free
The circle starts over again
By the most enlightened matter
I have your mind in the grip of my hand
All he's done is try to bury
Fleeing so far from the judge and the juryLet's go!
With blood shot eyes, I watch you sleeping
The warmth I feel beside me is slowly fading
Would she hear me, if I called her name?
Would she hold me, if she knew my shame?
There's always something different going on
The path I walk is in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on
Can anybody help me make things bet-ter?
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscious calls, the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscious calls, the guilty to come home
The moments died, I hear no screaming
The visions left inside me are slowly fading
Would she hear me, if I called her name?
Would she hold me, if she knew my shame?
There's always something different going on
The path I walk is in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on
Can anybody help me make things bet-ter?
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscious calls, the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscious calls, the guilty to come home
This battered room I've seen before
The broken bones they heal no more, no more
With my last breath I'm choking
Will this ever end I'm hoping
My world is over one more time
Let's go!
Would she hear me, if I called her name?
Would she hold me, if she knew my shame?
There's always something different going on
The path I walk is in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on
Can anybody help me make things better?
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscious calls, the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me (tears don't fall)
Her conscious calls, the guilty to come (conscience calls)
Better!
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscious calls, the guilty to come home (conscience calls)Music by Sanrabb
Lyrics by Sanrabb
I will find my way
Through this void called life some day
I cast my spell to set them free
I serve the demons, they serve me
By ways of Belial
On paths of ancient times
I call out in vengeance
I know your name
Shaitan
Night has come
I feel the forces shift and turn
I call your name
Shaitan
By ways of Baphomet
On paths of ancient times
I call out in anger
I know your name
SatanWe part for ever from today
Farewell beloved one
And I unto may death your way
Will shun
I care not now where you may go
You can no more bereave me
Today the sweetest girl I know
Does leave me
When the air still moves my curtain
As it used in times of yore
Moonlight down the lane just uncertain
Only you come nevermore, come nevermore, come
Only you come nevermore, come
Nor shall I as in former years
Build Spanish castles so high
With starlit windows and with towers that reach the sky
When, shivering with bitter cold
Through winter nights uncertain
I watched lest you perhaps unfold
Your curtain
Ohh, what delight to stroll with you
Beneath that flowering trees
When poured its light their branches through
The moon
When the air still moves my curtain
As it used in times of yore
Moonlight down the lane just uncertain
Only you come nevermore, come nevermore, come
Only you come nevermore, come
That I might catch with rapturous thrill
The words that you let fall
And that today I barely still
I barely still recall
How often did I secretly pray
Swift night her sails would furl
That we might thus forever stray
Fair girl
When the air still moves my curtain
As it used in times of yore
Moonlight down the lane just uncertain
Only you come nevermore, come nevermore, come
Only you come nevermore, comeSo, now you're begging for life
All hopes and dreams are kicked aside
Your reflection in my knife
Reflects hum animal demise
Every man, every child
Punishment for being alive
White meat, dark meat
Red meat, dead meat
So ravenously consumed
Your disassemblage my blood lust anxiety
In heat for human meat
Every piece digest complete
Crack open the epithelial
A meal in yourself
Frozen alive and placed in scalding broth
To separate skeletal trash
Fine portions of meat slough off
It's in this industry
We find deeper meanings
For the human being
Forcefed murder
You have long been a killer
You have long been dead
This has all been a holocaust
You have long been forcefed
Dead meal for the masses
Condiments of fluid and bile
Efficient waste and disposal
Hors d'oeuvres arriving in piles
Frozen alive and placed in scalding broth
Preparation of shit breeders
Fine portions of meat slough offSvart blod nu mnen drnker
Svart totem ur djupet stiger

Tusentals troll nu marscherar
Blodet dryper frgar rtt...the history of france has a time when a man
called louis xiv was crowned child king
he ordered all the dukes and counts to his home
so he controlled their lives and made them docile and tame
he was a clever monarch, ruled with an iron fist
everyone who didn't agree, was written on his black list
louis xiv, finesse and force
he reigned over his nation, insuring his sovereignty
louis xiv, finesse and force
indeed there was the other side to louis xiv
he build splendid gardens to impress all his friends
for the aristocracy all gifts to him send
he showered his court with parties and fun
the reasons are many, he's the king of the sun
two generations later the king has succumbed
he lost all control, the country had gone numb
the realm was in an uproar, so something had to snap
the rich just got richer and the poor got the crap
the sinking of the empire wasn't to be changed
in the bloody vacuum it all felt so strange
[chorus]
revolution in 1789
revolution - the king was overthrown
revolution - monarchy has gone
revolution - democracy was born
the king was beheaded in 1793
while his head was rolling the nation danced so free...
now think about this song
and then transfer it into our time
there still are many louises
dictators who live so fine
and in the end
majority has got it right
it's a warning to all louises
living now in our time
it's revolution's jubilee
the birthday of democracy
all politicians should beware
that something here is happening.The normal man, promised all things
Brought into this, taken by pain
He mistook home for grave
The normal man, filtered by hate
Living to pay, buying what's fake
He mistook home for grave
It's not what we're made to be
So why'd he do it?
I guess he just did not know
I guess we just do what we're told
The anthem cries, but why listen?
I guess we just do what we're told
Betrayed again, betrayed again
What began as life for him was only sorrow, was only shame
It's like the story of disgrace
Fraught with peril every day
So why'd he do it?
I guess he just did not know
Given nothing, left so lonesome
He mistook home for his grave
It's not what we're made to be
So breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe
I guess we just do what we're told
The anthem cries, but why listen?
I guess we're just do what we're told
Betrayed again
What began as life for him was only sorrow, was only shame
It's like the story of disgrace
Fraught with peril every dayThis time I wanna know
what life means...
...to live it again
I'm looking forward, feel the
light shine in my eyes...
And now I know, my instincts
were not wrong,
and many things can be done
I don't believe now,
That I'm dreaming alone
Oh, we're searching for the love
that everyone's got,
but can't see [yeah]
Oh, beyond the flesh and blood
there's so much hidden behind
as so much more we've gotta give...
Sanity brings up the sadness
that keeps your ilusions locked
in a little box
Fright comes, you find yourself lonely
in a cage of conclusions
crowding your mind
You sit back bowing your head,
every answer - yes
Why don't you trust me
and shed out your fears,
Running over
the tears you've contained
now cover up your eyes,
- Is it good for you?
I will be here when fire burns!...
Welcome on board
over here is the ship of your life
So rotten
that will cast away
I'll be your sweet lullaby
all the night
And if you get lost
you can hold my hand...
And I'll be here when fire burns
[inside your heart]
Climb up the hills and mountains,
don't forget what you've learned!
Life make us feel
the time we cannot hold
Time make us live
a tale already told
Time make us heal
a feeling inside
a feeling that lies in your heart
that we stole away...
And I'll be here when fire burns
[inside your heart]
Climb up the hills and mountains,
don't forget what you've learned!
Life make us feel [life make us feel]
the time we cannot hold
Time make us live [time make us live]
a tale already told
Time make us heal [time make us heal]
a feeling inside
a feeling that lies in your heart
that we stole away...What can I say?
There's just no way, is there?
So I act as if it's ok mister
I am who I am
I say goddamn
Goddamn I give whatever I can
Now that is what a nice guy I am
I have no need to be a part of thee
Spare me your terrible uncertainty
I am who I am
I say goddamn
Goddman I take care while I can
Now that is what a nice guy I am
You gotta be human to be inhumane
Gotta be crazy not to go insane
Gotta be a fool not to be a fool
And you gotta rule not to break any rules
Don't be to smart
Or to high priced
Now that is where the snake
Comes into paradise
I am who I am
I say goddamn
Goddamn I give whatever I can
Now that is what a nice guy I amLonely in a room of memories
From another life
Waiting and chasing
Moments that elude
Why can't I escape
Waiting and chasing
Memories of moments that are gone
When first she looked at me
And sipped her drink across from me
Newborn hell was it all along
Right there with me, inside
Reflecting on the outside
If it won't die can I
Some days I look at things
As if they never existed
And others it's all right here
I've been thinking aloud
About the way it went
I guess we're having a moment right now
Having a moment right now
I guess we're having a moment right now
Having a moment right
Best of them all
Why wouldn't you see
The memories long gone
Best of them all
Lately I'm thinking
Were they all along
Best of them all
What then becomes of letters never sent
In stillness you can hear us
Never far awayThe gift of life arrives with death, creation left
to sntence lives, declare exile, ancients survive
everyone escape! to heavens halls to wait.
Poised to loose their touch of hate...
But Satan is there and waiting !!Sometimes I wish I could just sew up my eyes So I don't have to witness and realize the monster that has become of me
There's something wrong with the fatal attraction
For every action there's an opposite reaction
It's like a trip to the brain, trip to the brain, that drives me fuckin'
I'm fuckin'insane, fuckin' insane, fuickin' insane!
Straighthate - You're just a pawn in the game so fuck you
Straighthate - You're just a pawn in the game so fuck you
To me there is nothing but a diluted state of reality 'Cause hell has fuckin' frozen over for me
And from my knees I beg and plead for salvation
I will kick and scream with broken teeth until damnation
It's like a trip to the brain, trip to the brain, that drives me fuckin'
I'm fuckin' insane, fuckin' insane, fuckin' insane!
Straighthate - You're just a pawn in the game so fuck you
Straighthate - You're just a pawn in the game so fuck off
You're just a pawn in the game so fuck you
Come revolution I'm down for the kill
Fingers on triggers to be used at will
Pledge your allegiance and die for the cause, the cause
As we rise red white and blessed blue
Straighthate - You're just a pawn in the game so fuck you
Straighthate - You're just a pawn in the game so fuck you
There's something wrong with the fatal attraction
For every action there's an opposite reaction
It's like a trip to the brain that drives me fuckin'
I'm fuckin'insane, fuckin' insane, fuickin' insane!
Pledge allegiance
You better go!
Walk away, you never had a chance anyway
You walk away, you never had a fucking chance anywayWhen the night is here to stay
After daylight has faded away
On a path blacked by pain
I'm waiting for battles to come
When the moon is cold and pale
And the forest whispers my name
I'm cold but warmed by faith
That youll join me, and...
Ride with me tonight
Guide me through the battles
With glory and pride
Stand by me tonight
Raise your sword and join me in battle with light
When we've slaughtered the fools of light
We shall tear down the portals of might
When their lies are dead, Destroyed
We shall build up our kingdom once more
When your sword no longer shines
And your armor is covered with blood
You'll be king until the day

Yasashi matsuge a no hitomiI fix my attention on this ball
Spinning round inside of me, deep inside
Revolving conscious planet
On an axis around this star
By the light
And the black holes in the vault of heaven
Make me wonder, wonder why
How matter can disappear
Are there doors in this wall to reach the light
From time and space
Now I see those mounts of fear
Feel the weight of nonsense killing simplicity
I can touch this wind of night
That erases our light and makes us paranoiac
But my legs are now so tired
Climbing all alone, all space, and all the time
So I fix my attention now
On this perfect planet revolving around this star
And the sun, it seems so close
I can touch the heat of presence and I know...
I can see this monster light
That embraces those notions : space and time
The black holes in the sky, I ask the reasons why
Light blackened? Door opened?
Swim back time, door giving entrance to
Supernova as only light
Meet the earth and all the stars
The entrance, the essence, supply usWhy am I trapped in these things I feel?
An existence so surreal
These fabricated walls that hold me inside
Unjustly charged with my greatest fears
That this existence is a part of it
Every time I try to starve this frenzy
It swallows me
A tortured mind embraced upon sorrow
Holding myself in contempt
The bittersweet emptiness
Of a man possessed
But I know it won't be long until I let it go
This spirit that resists a world of what is gone
Are we blind too weak to fight
The bending sea, this plague of life
And we compose our lot in life
Blindly searching for ways to go
I've seen the world, can I take the fall?
Should I set resistance free
And let the current carry me?
Through this pale glass river to a hollow sea
As I stand upon the shore
I always wanted more
But what I found is that
This shit is worth dying for
I've seen the world, can I take the fall?
Should I set resistance free
And let the current carry me
Through this pale glass river to a hollow sea(Solo: Cranial cremation)
Torched to a pimple
Peeling skin and tissue
Inflammable rectal gases
Scalding your sinews
Charbroiled to blackened char
Smoked, sauted and black
Blistering flaking tissue
Insalvageable by skin graft
Fused into a mess
Dribbling cartilage and fumes
Your body shrivellingYour fingers beginning to prune
Burnt to a cinder
Your body charred
Incinerated carbon
Molten as tar
Smouldering ashes
Scorched entrails
Carbonated dust
Cremated remains
Burnt to a crisp
Your fat's on fire
Devouring you whole
Like a cadaver-stoked pyre
Charred to the bone
Your flesh is burnt
Tissues molten
Bodily gases inert
Human inferno
Blazing eruption
Evaporating marrow
Spontaneous combustion
Burnt to a crisp
Your hair is singed
Devouring your scalp
Receding your fringe
Dripping flesh and fat
Spreads like an irritating rash
Your fingers melting
As you vainly scratch
(Solo: Malevolent Scrotal Incendiary Including Extreme Hate)From long ago, before the storm
I knew that I was alone
Left to my world, strange and unknown
Now it has take its toll
There was a dream, that brought me here
Far away, far from my home
There was a dream, that brought me here
Far away, far away and alone
Fate's not smiled down on me
Still I cry for my reprieve
Time slips by, never here
Always gone, never seems so near
All along, you were the one
That planted the seed, deep inside me
Dreams go on, one into one
Never a doubt, that you were beside me
Still I'm strong, I will go on
Even though, you have abandoned me
You've closed the door, trapped my soul
But one day I will be free!
Just let me be, here in my peace
Where I can be alone with thoughts
No company, just misery
And the burden of what has become of us all
There was a dream, that brought me here
Far away, far from my home
There was a dream, that brought me here
Far away, far away and alone
Fate's not smiled down on me
Still I cry for my reprieve
Time slips by, never here
Always gone, never seems so near
All along, you were the one
That planted the seed, deep inside me
Dreams go on, one into one
Never a doubt, that you were beside me
Still I'm strong, I will go on
Even though, you have abandoned me
You've closed the door, trapped my soul
But one day I will be free!
All along, you were the one
That planted the seed, deep inside me
Dreams go on, one into one
Never a doubt, that you were beside me
Still I'm strong, I will go on
Even though, you have abandoned me
You've closed the door, trapped my soul
But one day I will be free!Welcome to Style School Freshman
No Family Values and no hooking up with you
Can see you falling
Oh no, I won't catch you
I wish I could, but I've got some lectures to do
Enrole now and I will see you through
Here comes the Style School, you got up too late again
You fool, you have been missing class again
A bad habit, a bad habit
You're chasing the rabbit, biting your own tail
(A bad habit...A bad babit)
Oh, I feel you want some more
Once again you crawl across the floor
You're not worth seeing my face behind this mask
Is there a train to pull, that you can do without
Is there a bull on this planet, that won't make you bitch around
Get off my back or do you like to be kicked
When you're down on the ground, God you're making me sick
Style School, you're not gonna graduate
You fool, you gotta get educated
Quit asking what is it, what the've got uh
That I have not
Chasing the rabbit, sitting on the spot
(A bad habit...A bad habit)
Oh, I feel you want some more
Once again you crawl across the floor
You're not worth seeing my face behind this mask
Oh, I feel you want some more
Once again you crawl across the floor
You're not worth seeing my face behind this mask
You little creep, it's not good to be like me
But now feel me and breathe me again
Oh furthermore I'm just the singer in this bandIn awkward times at awkward places ...
Rogues in glitter robes, with fierce grimaces
Sneak around me glowering.
I should be running away
But I keep standing here in fires.
Sinister choirs of whip-lashing demons
With circling vultures in a dreadful allegiance.
Singing out of tune in empty words and empty phrases
Heard it all before from a familiar face.
And every tone cuts deep as rain in april
Every chord they form tears open the wounds
But today will be my day
When I stand up and be brave
Today it is me and my ire
Today I stand alone in fires.
Was my heart one of a sparrow?
Caged in the prospects of disbeliefer's eyes
Was I lurking in my own shadow?
For a minute free of compromise.
So many years have passed inside the mussel
So many have defiled my realm
So many foreign tongues and unknown words
So many blether and blether and blether...
Awoke. From sorrow sleep.
And every tone cuts deep as rain in april
And every chord they form tears open the wounds
But today will be my day
When I stand up and be brave
Today it is me and my ire
Today I stand alone in fires.Under a burning sky
Demise strays through the year
Decay casting light on shedding of leaves
The night
River silent shivers
As my lids will widen divine
Prayers silently whispered
Your eyes close your soul is mine
ATECH MALKUTH
VE GEBURACH
VE GEDULACH
LE OLAHM
CHUMEIN
And my wasted life
In a terrifying wink of time
Restlessly awaiting for
Benediction from my god divine
And the sky was blackened
As you turned your grace away
Doubtlessly expecting
My soul to be taken away
As I die
In a blanket white and clean
Angelic voices shiver
Like a graveyards silent scream
As the end is near and all I feel now is believe
Light of live endarkens
I command my soul to theeFlickering flames,
My luscious soul divest
The bitter kisses
In a deep astral caress
Lost in rapture, enigmas revealed
On the edge where reason fades
A martyr of spheres
That take me out of sight
A silent madness grabs me
When I fall in love with shades
Hoping they will dispose me
But they guide me trough my Hades
All my daemons came by
To visit my paradise
At the flood of Chaos
Unleashed my last sight
Lost in a rapture, enigmas revealed
On the edge where reason fades
A martyr of spheres
That take me out of sight
The one who inspires the pain
To the phantasmagoria in my headCrawling and moaning in the sharp blade of grass
All my life starting over, blood spilled inside out
I went through this cycle of pain deep in myself
Destroyed by awful hands, a demon of illusion
The pain now awaken, I'm cracking wide open
Can barely recognize my body, a battlefield
Unquestioned pride once so fragile
I cannot even recall names or faces
Those standing on my side
My side
I am nothing the pain awake is forging me
Face down, inert
Forcing me, dreams haunting me
I am immense, I am awake, renewed
Lost in the darkest time
I know I felt their presence
Even if I was blind
Pain, please forgive my ignorance
My masterevery day there are dying out
some species of animals and plants.
stop the environmental disaster,
only now we have a chance.
threatened creatures, dirty seas,
polluted atmosphere, dying trees.
Every day we are destroying
a part of this beautiful nature.
stop the ecocide now,
or we will have no future.
we invest millions of dollars
in science and mars exploration,
that we can leave this planet
when it is finally destroyed.
use the money for saving the environment,
this would be thousand times more efficient!
threatened creatures, dirty seas,
polluted atmosphere, dying trees.
stop the insanity! - stop the ecocide!
stop the indifference! - stop the suicide!I might be moving to the east
to part my ways
And I will try to get something
I don't have yet
If I do, I will look at it
for days and days
Untill I will never forget
I have heard this mental search
has made them all
take a look along the border
Having the urge
For their minds
to be lifted
to something new
I'm running to meet
my higher self
I trust the speed
Untill I have no need
to run anymore
Miles and miles I run
I hear my feet
And I hear myself breathe
heavily
I trust the speed
Untill I have no need
To run anymore
Miles and miles I runThese times they mean so much.
It's all about love and family.
No one can ever hold us down.
No one can ever hold us back.
Stuck it out through all the hardships,
But troubled times have come our way but in the end we'll prevail.
I accept the challenge to change our destiny.
Gouge out our eyes and judge us blind.
We refuse to take your judgements and your lies.
The lives you've turned away will be your true demise.
But this is something you will not take from me, it's in my heart forever.
Forever
And now the time has come for us to rise again, too bad it came to this.
Settle the scoreFor far too long the practice of psychiatry
Has prospered on mending society's wrong
To cure a freak who don't belong
It's all a bunch of lies
Rooted at shuffling addictions around
Distorting people's minds
Complicating from those divine
Tell me what's the problem, I have a cure for you
There's nothing a prescription can undo
You must sit and trust me, I can feel your pain
Correcting the lithium deficiency
In your brain with pills
You're mad all the time
Sedated, now you'll be fine
Getting stoned, getting stoned
'Cause I'm distorted from taking drugs
Designed to help me regain my mind
To rid the depression, I periodically endure
I'm not right, but was better than when I came here
Through getting stoned
I perceive all the injections
The scars that remain
The needle tracks that stain the veins
Rehab is a joke to me
A strung out junkie needs to be set free
Methadone clinics just won't help
How do you rehabilitate a serial killer
Who longs to kill, but is addicted to brutal sex?
That's a sick addition in itself
How do you cure obesity?
A transient drunk? Anaclisis?
Manic depressive psychosis?
Over-active sex drives?
Anorexia nervosa? Control freaks?
Self-destructive humans? World hunger?
Living here in torment
It's disturbing
It's quite contagious
You'll diagnose
Born deficient, comatose
I'm a special doctor
You don't know me
As long as I get my money
I've got a degree In worldly nothings
Fine upstanding yuppie
But I care only for cash
For far too long
Authority made them strong
Rehabilitation does not work
Because crime is high
Rape has gone up
So has the tension
While psychiatrists get rich
Feeding on the nation's insecurites
Performing mental blasphemy as they please
A prescription will set you free or taint your soul
Will false hope
Rehab is for quitters
Who's right to say
What is wrong or right?
Desire consumes you are what you are
And no one can change that stupid fact
Molester or strung out on crack
Rehab can only change
Those who will be changed
It shifts the color of addiction
To something of the same
Making the monkey go away
Replacing him with a chimp
Can't stop thinking
About those cigarettes
Crawl beneath the skin
Like the man who tried to quit shooting after 25 years
Decided to put the needle down
And found he could no longer live
So he tried a little bit
No longer exists
Death is the pain killerVision of a stranger before me
Forced to face this sad reality
The path seems definitively hopeless
Ever giving way to madness
Over the years we are struggling
One against the other
Feeding the seed of hate
Dismissing tolerance
Blood will flow for missing brothers
Horizon darkens more than ever
In front of vengeance's horrible face
Death's shadow glides in the air

FAR AWAY FROM THE CITIES IM BURNING.
SIRENS ARE SCREAMING IN MY HEAD,
CORRUPTED LIFE FOR A CHANCE TO FEEL SOMETHING,
PLANTED MY GARDEN WITH GUNS

NO DIRECTION FOR MY SOUL

beautiful as the dark winds
frustrating as sporn
divine as the night
...love me you might.Be clear every day, every evening
It calls here aloud from above
Carefully watched for a reason
Mistaking devotion and love
Surrendered to self-preservation
From others who care for themselves
But life as it touches perfection
Appears just like anything else
Isolation
Mother, I tried, please believe me
I'm doing the best that I can
I'm ashamed of the things
I've been put through
I'm ashamed of the person I am
Isolation
But if you could just see the beauty
These things I could never describe
Pleasures and wayward distraction
Is this my wonderful prize?
IsolationI see so much, Burns my eyes
Lift your arms up, Touch the sky
I feel so much, Feel like noone
Lift your arms up, Touch the skyThis is the tale of ELRIC

You ripped my heart out, I wish I was dead
I cannot tame my demons forevermore
You are the reason I should have known before
Because of you I've lost it all
Seems like all we had is over now
Because of you I rise to fall
But in the end it's over now...
Are you still my anchor?
Cause you're dragging me down!
I'm lost in the ocean, call the sirens before I drown
I will leave with my head down
I've lost it all, it's all the same now...
It's all the same
Because of you I've lost it all
Seems like all we had is over now
Because of you I rise to fall
But in the end it's over now...
I'm cold, I'm lost, I'm wrong, I'm numb,
I'm flawed, I'm sick, I'm tired, I'm done,
I'm useless, broken, scared, can't run away
Because of you I've lost it all
Seems like all we had is over now
Because of you I rise to fall
But in the end it's over now...
I'm cold, I'm lost, I'm wrong, I'm numb,
I'm flawed, I'm sick, I'm tired, I'm done,
I'm useless, broken, scared, can't run awayWhere are we now?
When we are blind
Abandoned faith
You left behind
Were you betrayed?
Or did you lie?
Our common fate
Our common demise
Where is the sun?
To light the way
Along this path
Of our dismay
Look to the sky
On judgment day
A human God
That was man made
So we lie
So we lie
So we lie
So we lie
And so we rise
Just to fall down
In reality
You're never found
I'm reaching out
With sealed eyes
I grab for light
Visions decried
Look to the sky
On judgment day
A human God
That was man made
So we lie
So we lie
So we lie
So we lie
Face down, arms out
Nailed to the cross of doubt
Blood runs like rain
Drowning for this world in vain
Crown of black thorns
Human skin, ripped and torn
Crown of black thorns
Human skin, ripped and torn
Where is your savior now?
Where is your savior now?
Where is your savior now?
Where is your savior now?The air stirs up the galaxy!
Be!!!.........
The crosswinds of forever become me and place me on
The porch of the breeze
Without my sounds would be silent
No gullible gusts through the trees
Carrying seasons to bring us
The atmosphere we all can enjoy and we destroy
The blur on the horizon disturbs me
It casts a disguise on the sun
In the end it's the wind that will weaken
And the human goes from billions to none
The wind will regain all its motion
And clear the air for the following to...(breathe)
(spoken) The breeze of; a new creation
Moving clouds, from everywhere
Sensing a rainy stare
Smelling the moisture in the air
In the air.
The weather can be deemed as deceiving
To predict the unpredictability
The passion that it peels for the ocean
Air and water sharing laughter
A bond between two forces of nature
All to live and breathe
The breeze of a new creation
Breathe
The breeze of a new creation.[Verse 1]
I just wanna switch locations (she said to me)
Come now, come now baby (finish the drink)
She don't wanna conversation (?)
And thats whats frustrating (?)
She said she want to know
She said she want to know
Couple more shots of crown
Couple more shots of crown
And it's going up
She said she wanna be my wild ting
(and its going up)
She said she wanna be my wild ting
She know she got that fire
Everything i desire
She said she wanna be my wild ting
Lemme feel your sensation
She said to me
Baby I'm losing patience
Dont make me wait
Whatever you wanna say just save it
I dont wanna hear her wanting
Coz you know I'm so anxious
What you got for me
She said she want to know
She said she want to know
Another round of crown
Another round of crown
And it's going up
She said she wanna be my wild ting
(and its going up)
She said she wanna be my wild ting
She know she got that fire
Everything i desire
She said she wanna be my wild ting
If you want it right now
Come into the room and turn the lights down low
Imma do you right now
All you gotta do is turn the lights down low
Before you ran quiet down
But now you in this room so turn the lights down low
Why you acting shy now
Girl just turn the lights down low
And its going up
She said she wanna be my wild ting
(and its going up)
She said she wanna be my wild ting
She know she got that fire
Everything i desire
She said she wanna be my wild ting
She know she got that fire
Everything i desire[I. Impasse of Thoughts]
I can't see you, I can't hear you
Do you still exist?
I can't feel you, I can't touch you,
Do you exist?
The Phantom Agony
I can't taste you, I can't think of you,
Do we exist at all?
[II. Between hope and despair]
The future doesn't pass
And the past won't overtake the present
All that remains is an obsolete illusion
We are afraid of all the things that could not be
A phantom agony
Do we dream at night
Or do we share the same old fantasy?
I am a silhouette of the person wandering in my dreams
Tears of unprecedented beauty
Reveal the truth of existence
We're all sadists
The age-old development of consciousness
Drives us away from the essence of life
We meditate too much,
so that our instincts will fade away
They fade away
What's the point of life
And what's the meaning if we all die in the end?
Does it make sense to learn or do we forget everything?
Tears of unprecedented beauty
Reveal the truth of existence
We're all pessimists
Teach me how to see and free the disbelief in me
What we get is what we see, the Phantom Agony
[III. Nevermore]
The lucidity of my mind has been revealde in new dreams
I am able to travel where my heart goes
In search of self-realisation
This is the way to escape from our agitation
And develop ourselves
Use your illusion and enter my dream...[Lyrical magick/Obscurity: Proscriptor & Equitant, Musick: Proscriptor & Shaftiel]

And fear the sky shall fall!Der Morgen bricht herein
und scheint durch den Nebel so matt.
Stille herrscht ber die ruhenden Krieger.
Aus einem Hinterhalt, schelmig lachend, durch das Unterholz,
eiserne Mnner bewaffnet mit frchterlichen Waffen.
Sie strmen auf die Teutonische Brut.
Eine Fontne schwarzen Blutes ergiet sich.
Der Ruin kam ber uns letzte Nacht.
Ein riesiger Verlust ist zu beklagen.
In Scharen berkamen sie unser Volk.
Nahmen Leben und Proviant.
Mit unseren letzten Krften
konnten wir sie zurckschlagen.
Es ist unsere Ehre welche ist verletzt,
sie mu wiedererobert werden.
Diesem Volk mu der Garaus gemacht werden.
Das Schlachtfeld mu durchsogen sein
von dem unehrenhaften Feindesblut.
Schwerter kreuzen, idyllischer Mondschein.
Die Barbaren brechen auf, die Ehre zu verteidigen.
Getse, von den Bergen nicht fern
Wapen!!!
ertnt von der bestialischen Horde
Krieg.
Blut fliet, die Feinde sind machtlos unterlegen
dem Teutonischen Kampfesgeist.
Voller Stolz kehren wir zurck.
Der Kriegsgott war unser Geleit
bei dieser Schlacht, welche unsere war.
Er schrfte unsere Klingen
fr das sie besser
durch das bittere Feindesfleisch gleiten,
sie erfuhren winselnd
unsere Lust,
unsere Lust zum Tten.
Ihre Sterblichkeit erlischt wie ihre Seelen.
Und ihr unehrenhaftes Blut
wird vergiften den Grund.[Music by Lord Ahriman. Lyrics by Emperor Magus Caligula]
In the dungeon so cold, sits the Nazarene son.
His eyes filled with tears, his soul with fear.
Asking himself, where is my god now?
Preacher of lies, soon to be nailed.
Hail murder, your god of filth wont help you now.
Hail murder, soon to meet the evil one.
Carry your cross, to your own doom.
Meet the people's hatred.
You will die amongst the dirt, where you belong.
Christian blood soon will cover the ground.
As I drive the nails of evil, deep inside.
A crucified whore, that's what you are.
The only crown you have, is one made of thorns.
Hail Murder, your god of filth wont help you now.
Hail murder, soon you to meet the evil one.
Hail murder, as the nails are hammered in deep.
Hail murder, I am the spear in his side.
Carry your cross, to your own doom.
Meet the people's hatred.
You will die amongst the dirt, where you belong.
The demons fly high, they circle above.
Waits for his blood to stop flow, and to collect his soul.
The lord of lies, soon to die.
Thousand of years of pain await.
Hail Murder, your god of filth wont help you now.
Hail murder, soon you to meet the evil one.
Hail murder, as the nails are hammered in deep.
Hail murder, I am the spear in his side.I'll be your Romeo. You'll be my Juliet.
You'll be so beautiful, So charming.
Lying dead in my room.
I lost touch with my hand, and the knife in your back.
Short story, this tragic ending,
The missing link in the chain of events,
That have occurred gravely throughout the years.
You will not die with me.Paralyzing atrophy locked in her web of mimicry
Suspended inverted waiting to die
Dexterous segmented limbs
Fangs to sink within your skin
They seek to find vacancy
With your withered heart
She lives for the hunt man
And you are the kill
Now feel that venom spread
It hardening your arteries
Ensnared soon to be dead
A shadow of your former
A mere shell of a man
Degenerated tortured hallowed
And spit into the earth again
To terminally lust for
To love one's self to death
Regret the day you heard the tune
That trapped you in the sirens nest
Enchanting the flower of disease
Beware her silken surprise
She'll throttle you down to your knees
She'll suck you dry
Lost inside her eyes of thousand
The deadly kiss of a mistress venomous
Soulless you fell before her
Quenching her ravenous thirst
Strip mining your essence
She'll turn your universe to black
Emasculating glutton for perverse punishment
Lecherous and deviant perfume to mask her scent
To the naked eye immaculate to her victim poisonous
She'll wrap you up so tight she'll suffocate without relent
Enchanting the flower of disease
Beware her silken surprise
She'll throttle you down to your knees
She'll suck you dry(I sit here watching the clock tick)
(Why am I waiting?)
Sitting on my bed now, waiting for you to come home
Counting all the minutes, anticipating
It's about time now; you know our love is so real
Stronger than the feelings I've ever known
[Chorus]
Why am I waiting for you?
There's no time for dreaming; be true
Why am I waiting for you?
Respect my love, just be there; be true
Tell me all my lonely nights, tell me
Don't want to play your games
The way that I'm feeling
Is it just a childish time
Show me your heart, show me your mind
Baby, don't be such a fool
'Cause you're treating me so cruel
[Chorus]
Don't you think it's time to make it right?
My love is too short to play around
Tell me that you believe in me
This is just a make believe
Baby, show me your love
That is all I'm asking for
Baby, I need you
Baby, I want you
Baby, come home
[Chorus x 2]
Why am I waiting for you?
Pack your bags, and now we're through
Why am I waiting for you?
'Cause I've done all I can do
Why am I waiting for you
When you can't even be true?
Why am I waiting for you?
I can't see why I'm waiting for you
[Chorus]So close so far we see who we are
We've come so far but we still bleed we still scar
We can't let go of these memories buried whole
What makes us us what makes us close
You can't create you can't unfold
A bond that can not be broken
One word one voice
One word one choice
We still bleed we still scar.in the midnight hour we wished for dawn alas we've reaced the final gaze pull the pins from beneath my skin kissing each of your eyelids closed murderer she looks beautiful bleeding and the tears fell down so tired i crawl deep inside of her i stole a glance of your heart beating i watched until your lungs ceased bleeding, breathingIch kenne nichts erbrmlicheres als euch Menschen
Schpfungskrone zur Produktion verdammt
Gestaltet ihr eure tglich Pein
in gar kmmerlichem Dasein
Seid angetreten im Kampf gegen euch selbst,
als einzig wrdig Gegner
Gehetzt vom Egoismus als euerm strkstem Trieb,
jagd ihr dem Leben doch vergebens hinterher
Und Vier Reiter stehen bereit, es kommt die Zeit
Und Vier Reiter stehen bereit, uns bindet ein mchtiger Treueeid
Ihr mget die Grenzen mit Vlkerhass vermauern,
Mit feindlichem Stahl und Gas auf den Tag der Vergeltung lauern
Ihr haltet die Geschichte nicht auf.
Es kommt die Zeit da treten wir ber die Grenzen
Und wir kommen nicht mit offenen Hnden,
wir werden unseren Zorn an euch verschwenden
Uns bindet ein mchtiger Treueeid - und vier Reiter stehen bereit.Der Tag ist jung, die Luft gar khl,
Als die winz'gen Wassertropfen auf meiner Haut ich fühl' -
Das Nass des Nebels, der schaurig steigt empor
Aus den verträumten Eb'nen tief im Schwarzwaldmoor.
Noch ruht die Kreatur im Wald verborgen
Von einem dicken Schleier sanft bedeckt.
Es schweigt die Flur, es graut der Morgen,
Als ein klarer Laut den Tag erweckt:
Die Grille zirpt ihr helles Lied,
Die Stille stirbt, die Ruhe flieht.
Es erwacht das Moor -
Ein neuer Tag ist geboren
Und es kommt mir vor,
Manch quälend Drangsal sei verloren.
Die Sonne wirft ihre warmen Strahlen
Durch das Geäst uralter Bäume.
Die Natur beginnt zu malen
Bilder gleich der schönsten Träume.
Der Nebel wehrt sich
Gegen der Sonne Macht -
Ein Kampf entfacht.
Doch es vermehrt sich
Die güldene Kraft,
Die es endlich schafft
Und den Dunst besiegt.
Zum Vorschein kommt die ganze Pracht.
Vögel singen und die Sonne lacht.
Vollkommen beherrscht Seinen Beruf,
Der all dies so wunderbar erschuf.
Zarte Spinnweben vom Morgentau benetzt,
Sind der Gräser Zier
Und gleichen edlen Perlenschnüren
Ins lockend Netz sich setzt
So manch' Getier,
Das sich liess vom Glanz verfhren.
Verlassen und einsam wirken
Die zierlich gewachs'nen Birken,
Die dort draussen auf den Inseln
Alle Blicke auf sich zieh'n.
Überwältigt von des Schöpfers Pinseln
Staune ich und lobe Ihn.
Ein sanfter Wind trägt die Hitze fort.
Die Zeit verrinnt, der Abend ergreift das Wort.
Des Himmels Licht gar glutrot glüht.
Es verstummt des Spechtes Hämmern.
Des Tages Blüte ist verblüht
Und es beginnt zu dmmern.
Die Sonne weicht,
Hat bald des Himmels Bett erreicht
Der Tag ist müde und es erwacht
Eine sternenklare Nacht.
Vergessen werd' ich nimmermehr
Die Bilder die ich sah und seh'.
Und als ich endlich heimwärts geh',
Fällt mir der Abschied unendlich schwer.
Doch von den Bildern
Die mich träumen liessen
Noch berauscht, ja halb benommen,
Nehm' ich mir vor:
Bald schon werd' ich wiederkommen
Um zu geniessen
Den Frieden tief im Schwarzwaldmoor.The lamb, the rose
The don't exist
The lamb, the rose
They don't exist
These are my last words
I need to rest
In fear and anger
I'll lay down my head
A faithless spirit in a broken man
Everything is burning
Rotten flesh keeps burning
It's MY LAST SUNRISE in fear
The grail's in pieces
All the bliss is gone
The rose has dried out
And the lamb got slaughtered long ago
The hope became another lie
Like the nonexisting father god
I'll close my eyes, goodbye
Don't wait for me on the other side
Everything is burning
Rotten flesh keeps burning
It's MY LAST SUNRISE in fear
Don't wait for me on the other side
Golgotha - had seen nothing else but
A carpenter's death
Golgotha - not more maybe not even that
Suffer, grief and pain
Have driven me insane
Can't you see
There's nothing real
But you and I
And I say goodbye
Hear no evil, speak no evil
See no evil, feel no evil
Dream no evil, fear no evil
Touch no evil, taste no evil
All I see and hear is evil
All I think and feel is evilAre my hands not black?
Black with the filth of this ageless denial?
From the first birthing breath, to the stillness of death
The light of the "right" has been deceived
And thus we live our lives
Always one step from the "heavens"
Shattering the spell
One act that will free us
Shattering the spell
Beaten by the lies of failure's conquest
One step from the "heavens"
Shattering the spell
When every breath's a warning and every moment a sign,
Lay me amidst the pinewood walls to regain what once was mine
All's pale
Shattering the spell
Flesh pales
Shattering the spell
Are my hands not red?
Red with the truth that has conquered denial?
From the first broken vow, to the last fighting breath
The light of the "right" has been deceived
And thus we die
What's left, left for the living?
In the eyes of the purest truth?
What's left, left for the living?
In the arms of denial's only son?
When every breath's a warning and every moment a sign,
Lay me amidst the pinewood walls to regain what once was mine
All's pale
Shattering the spell
Flesh pales
Shattering the spell
And thus we live our lives
Always one step from the "heavens"
Shattering the spell
One act that will free us
Shattering the spell
Beaten by the lies of failure's conquest
One step from the "heavens"
Shattering the spellEn el fuego arden mis sueos
Escondido entre las sombras estare
Ahogo tus recuerdos en llantos
Sientes que es tu amigo el que ves
No soy mensajero
Ni del odio ni del amor
No podre entender jamas la realidad
Y no me preocupa el mas all
Es mejor perderse lentamente
Hacia el final por t
En la calle te encontr y me acerque
Y tu corazon sangraba
Ya tu oscuridad es blanca
Has perdido en tu guerra sin luchar
Es mejor perderse lentamente
Hacia el final sin ti
Voy corriendo junto al viento y ganare
Cruzare mil rios no descansare
No soy algo sin sentido escuchame
Me desangro en esta vida por querer' ,

Sweat is running free, trickling down on my brow
Every man that I see is a potential foe
Have to stay down, have to stay low
Can not let them know
[Pre-Chorus]
And if I just can stay alert and keep my senses clear
I know that I can beat them all and maybe kill my fear
[Chorus]
But the man in the mirror is my worst enemy
Everywhere, he is there, always following me
I'm paranoid to the extreme
Agony, panic and fear are surging up inside of me
Hidden dangers are everywhere to see
Malicious lurkers, I have to flee
Oh please let me be
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus][I) The Vision And The Promise]
In the city of immortals
a scream broke the silence
it was a seer and he saw in
his dreams
his beloved city of eternal life
collapsing around him
and its people trodden by
a mighty army
The mad seer retold his vision
to the king
so they gathered the mightiest
warriors across the land
they promised them entrance
in their eternal city
in exchange that they turned back
the vision of the...
[chorus]
[II) Promise Denied]
As the wizard summons ancient
powers commanding thunders
and lightning
the swords of the warriors on the
battleground are shining in
the sun
soon the battle rages on
weapons are drawn in anger
the warcries echo throughout
the field
the invaders meet their doom
But the king and the seer betrayed
the warriors
and the armguard was hidden
beyond the gates
a cloud of arrows obscured the
sun as they entered the city
the promise of immortality has
been denied
[III) Prophecy Fullfilled]
Sun shines the morning brings
new life
a new day of hope and happiness
yesterday is far away and years
go by,fear goes away
life goes on inside the city
and peace will last for eternity
But rising from the earth came the
true vision
the mad seer had seen so long ago
prophecy fullfilled:
The army of the dead
[IV) Army Of The Dead]
Holy gift a ritual of seer
destruction
hunting their prey,cruel in their
desire for vengeance
the dead warriors rise from
their graves
take what was promised then
was denied:
the gift of immortality
[V) Doomed City]
and the sentence must be passed
curse are your vicious lies
in ashes the Eternal City
must fall
so let the truth be told
the Ivory towers are
crumbling down
the Golden doors crushed to
the ground
once a great City of Immortal
is now the city of the...
[chorus]
Army of the dead [4 times]IT REALLY MATTERS
I'LL PROTECT MYSELF
MEG THE GYPSY
LUMINOUS GLOW
NEVER WANT TO SEE YOU (AGAIN)
I'LL BE THERE
NICE DEVICE
NEVER WANT TO SLEEP WITH YOU AGAIN[music by Thomas C. Hansen]
[instrumental](Verse)
Welcome to the garden that hates you and Jim larden
Where weed trees grow around the things that leave the parted
By AKs and black bags you think are full of garbage
Guess the game of weapon are attained like Osamas
Who, by the way, is still alive, and stays to say hello
And told me to tell you that hes just laying low
Then disclose the TV paid to take the blame
For what happened to the towers, so America could take control.
Im making plans smush, but this aint rock and roll,
Just a snipp out of the crazyness of the life I know
Inside it grind me slow, blow your mind out of hole
You fly back to return to its rightful home
Im like a war whole of lyrics but much more in the spirit
Im trying to come out with spell and take control
Of every single area code across the globe
For every fairy tower tell it straight and bold
Is something like the common cold,
No ones find a cure for me, so I just hang around until its time to go
And come back when I decide to,
And play personas for viruses, like bird flu and swine flu.
Or what happens in line is next that been designed to
Kill it slowly with a knife, is human zu
Its jay lardan with a shade in alley way
Dont ask me who I am, who the fuck are you, fucking rude?
All my bars in rhymes move in synchracy
Think of me like mother marry but he cant get into me
By virgin all the pussy hoes
You think that I mistake to em,
Instinct to be inside my teeth.
In the down next, take a rain check,
Instead of blazing you I probably roll the place to bless
Barber spraying to the damn date the game starts
Make sense, wont stop until Im dead,
Thats why I move into great extence,
Bring me back to life in fifty thousand years
And I reign on whoever recognize.
Then came back with a diet coke jacking eyes
See words to me is worst through the devils eyes
I never went to it lost a part and made me jealous
Throw my hands up, I admit
That I want my hands to be, cause I feel like a man cuff
But now I broke free, Im never leaving bankrupt
Rappers think that that stiff rather that who is this
Just know I go hard, lapoon start, you know this is
New mandoon into a fool and know what this is
Until you hide unlike the moonlight and is the cuntoshionist
I see men collecting metals, I think we need to pause a bit
Cause I aint hating for the day that I start making some stuff
Probably like and old friend
And first veil upon myself from all the bullshits
Anyways, I never stray away from real,
All I can do, I guess, is demonstrate the way I feel
The way I speak, the way I move, the way I breathe, the way I am
So real life got me chasing and that kept me still
I lost with diabetes, time to meet my tombstone in fucking wheel
Listen, sometimes hard to get signed, but thats irrelevant,
I try to make, but I never had a lucky deal
So you breads can climb my money kill
Cause tv is on the run for money still
And in my hands theyre on the blodd they want it too
Im own team, you know me,
Running through the whole scene, screaming dang it Im a zin
With your whippers snappers drapping on it still
What the fuck is with that man chapper that you killed
Crackers smacking everywhere, just like the weed and pills
My backyard is too rough for tench marsh.
Fuck all the little pricks who keep saying my name
Youll never be as ill.Darkness looms over the world
A crimson sky weighs on our shoulders
An answer elude us, They turn to our machines
And in the face of chaos, To unhealthy order
The is a light that guide us to the heart of hell
If we stare, A city where the law is evil
And a life of crime is painful
If there is defiance in the streets
Blood will stain the land of profit
Enemies of truth and questions
Hold our liberty in their hands
I have lead the fight for freedom
To impress the mass they'll kill me
But serving all the captives
Is my duty as a man
My insanity keeps me alive in the madness
I can't wander this path anymore
I know the world, Heroes fail each day
In this city, Fading is the key
Let me introduce you to the
Ashes of the dreams that we had
The industry of lies was born here
And we are all its slaves as we pay
The prices we are given to endure
Will create a descent I won't be
Fucked repeatedly by this lot
Of profit craving ratsThe telephone swallowed the child
This is the last time I say your name
The crackle and hiss from the walls
You smile like a catholic in heat
Just don't forget what you've done
Just don't forget
This is the last time I say your name
This is the last time I say your name
[Incomprehensible]
Forget the fuck away from me
Forget the fuck away
Forget the fuck away from me
Forget the fuck awayPutrid cross of ignorance, loss of reverence, whip of innocence
Been listening to your mourning, watching you falling
Deeper, farer, until your calling
Evoked an eerie tone, that only you alone
As a warning have known
Guess, you've tried everything
To be as me, to winback the soul I've kindly been
Treating like my only son
God's shiny angel, I am gone
and you what the hell have you become?
Abandoned son, my fairly fallen angel, come on
And tell your father, what will we become!?
Angels, we dwell in hell, humiliating and sad as well
The world succumbed, some tell
And there I stand stone-still, hence
In my own non-existance and muse upon consequence!
Blood stained clay, forth from our sacred dissaray
Someone will walk a new way
And will close the door 'twixt us and common core
Angel, did you really want this war?
Scarlet lips of indecency (Scarlet lips of perversity)
In search for a splintered tongue (Matching each face disguised)
Sharpened words of intimacy
They'll need (all) my love (They'll need my hatred)
Sapience, pierce my flesh with your thorns of irony
Angel falls and twists her wings and her gleaming breasts
will rot like foul flesh, hence worms will dance
to a macabre romance... the rape of sweetness in my eyes
Decrepitude, pierce my tongue with your womanliness
Suck the honey of my breath and tear faith apart
Scratching suicidal love on life's putrid skin
I am your mortal son, so I am sin!!!
Oh ye, in hell we are, humiliated and bizarre
How only I have reached so far, my star
And you, across that melting sky
Waiting for me to die
For everything must die, and within everything am IWhy must I endure this strife
From the ignorance
In their minds
They believe that I am dead
That a smell of nothingness
Is left
One could not believe
What the catatonic sees
Through my eyes,
I see eternity
A surreal world
That fate could not perceive
Tainted life
Unfolds this tapestry
The fear runs so deep
In the souls of the weak
Blind, are their eyes
It is answers that they seek
I could answer all
But they refuse to see the way
The lies of Christ
Keep them in disarray
Though this is my prophecy
They make a mockery
Of what seems to have become of me
They want to take my life
Cover up their lies
Avoid the truth I have inside
Probing my dark mind
To see what they could find
On my pain they somehow seem to thrive
They live with no regrets
They think they've cheated death
But now the truth has come alive
The worlds begin colliding
Their screams heard in space
The atmosphere collapsing
Burning through the face
Their souls will never rest now
For them an ageless plight
Their peaceful sleep awakened
By the destructive light...Leave me here
I want to stay
I don't want this awkwardness
This pain
Just leave me here
Face to face, I told you
I had to
I don't love you
An overflow of regret crushes me
I must go on
I made tears fall from your eyes down your faceThe psychological impact of a film that we all love,
It's negative imagery that preys upon our young,
How could we be so blind?
Now we step inside conceptually a different view,
And uncover the horror that we're injecting into
All our children's minds.
Born into a peasant monarchy,
A life of inherited luxury.
This newborn Prince with his silver spoon,
His life unfolds and will change soon.
His father, the King, is not ever around,
Never deigning to walk on his own son's ground.
A tragic young life spent in a broken home,
Looking forward to years of life alone.
Leading the life of hell,
His story, you know it well.
In death he'd finally be free,
Could this be what it seems to be?
As this Prince enters his first few years,
A menagerie known as his friends appears,
Misfits one and all.
One, who lives to create turbulence,
Another, who straddles an androgynous fence,
And we're not sure where he'll fall.
Minute is his contact with the outside world,
Unhardened to the likely peril it holds.
Until one day, with his mother, the Queen,
He's thrust into a ghastly scene.
Like animals, with weapons they're pursued,
By men with butcherous attitudes.
His mother, the victem of the "Thrill Of The Chase",
With a bullet, she loses this deathrace.
Leading the life of hell,
His story, you know it well.
In death he'd finally be free,
Could this be what it seems to be?
Then his woman is forced into
A precarious position and looks doomed.
Assaulted and raped by more than one
Members of a gang that are on the hunt.
Add to this the destructiveness
Of the fire that rages without rest,
Decimating his neighborhood,
Torching his land where his home once stood.
Brutal cinematic display, upon our children's minds it preys.
A subtle induction into horror, with implications we can't ignore.
Malevolence hidden behind doe-eyes, how many see through its disguise?
Burning itself into the minds it haunts,
Is this really what we want?
Leading the life of hell,
His story, you know it well.
In death he'd finally be free,
Could this be what it seems to be?Potential connection
A chance to make things right
Alliance, defiance
A hope for things to change
United beside me
We could be unstoppable
The city confines me
Your people can set me free
I dream of a place where
Visions breathe and thoughts are so free
I feel like I am so confined (so much confusion)
Nothing changes (nothing stays the same)
Can I live with myself
If I don't take this chance?
A question, a problem
Decision, a chance to live
I need to believe you
It's hard to comprehendviewed from the darkest hole
outward face looking up
despair viewed down on, down on , down on
marked by a deeper scar
find the light i look for, look for, look for
these scars cause falls
i have need for outward
do i have to wait?
wait for this
i begin the long climb back on this rough terrain - long
dragged down to a new depth
balance lost again, again, again
these scars cause falls
i have need for outward
do i have to wait?

Now he stands in his ten foot hall with three of 'em
One bound to radiator also two wife and three his girlfriend
The two latter scan his fifty-nine pence can of beer in the kitchen
Behind ya he thinks
A mutual glance inherent from their milltown Persian Alabama
Atlanta Albania whatever
Their wisdom confirms friendship
Too dumb shit to do or know
I am hostage
Their young eyes say
Jet-lag
Wreck
Arrogant
Big lad

Their triptych mentality explodes

Call out this prayer of vengeance
Speaking to enemies through these wounds of redemption
Tearing out their eyes with horror
Behold this chosen new devise
As the silence pleads this forgiveness
A senseless begging for absolution
Upon this entrance into oblivion
This fallen angel of defiance, destitute to isolation
Hold tight to liberation, in the form of reprisal
Project of this restored frame, in these pain filled alterations
This new threat of changing life restless in this completion
Powerless you crawl like pigs
Soon to be slaughtered
Suckling to a faith that you avidly hoped would save you all
These offerings will bring us our justice.
For these years of diluted lies
The answers to our freedom
The answer to the death of Gods
These hands held into the sky so the dark
Winds can taste the blood of murder
As the blackest hearts obey thoughts of evil
Deathlorn rites, endure the lust for revenge
Surrender the state of embracement and release
This life from the dark interiors
Discomfort of this assisted torment is given in these regards
A scourge of awakening
Prisoned in the rites of blood
Bestowed with ancient plagues, we will forge a disease
Of rape upon your ideals
Within this lifeblood we will find the truths as blades
Slice open their necks
The answers to our freedom
The answer to the death of Gods
Once reconstructed the swarm will digest
The souls of this imperfection
Sterilizing faith bringer has discharged
This assembly of this damnation
Burden me with your weak
Curse me with your sick
In blood filled walls I lie confined
Carving out the blind eye of GodGlowing eyes, staring eyes
Manifest of evil presence
With entities swept in disease and decay
A fall from paradise beyond redemption
He who speaks of nightly treasures
He who wraps the serpent around my neck
He who pours poisonous wine in my chalice
He who lets me serve and slip away
And so I will take shelter
In the absence of the light
Hiding like a masked miniature in the dark
A revenant without relief it seems
For the art of becoming a progeny
And to be raised in such curse
Infesting the dead in herds
His grandeur of guidance in round trips obscure
He who immerse my hands in sullen thrills
His pat on which domination linger
He who dares to prove the sanity of mine
He who speaks of nightly treasures
He who lets me serve and slip away
Black unearthly void creatures crawling
Forbidden forgotten fairly underrated
Bastards in the shape of angels holding my hands
Passing me with is left of the wineHave really grown to hate you,
And everything you've come to stand for
I write these words in vain,
You won't read them
This pen would go to better use.
If I shoved it into your throat
And let you choke on
Your blood-filled breaths
However we once called
Each other friend,
So this pen continues to write words
That you ignoreThis is a ghost town, alive with the echoes of failures fled
Lit up by shining faces that parade these streets
What used to be of humility is gone
You walk the mounds of skull and bones
Where living is denied, I see more movement in decomposition than in those hollow eyes
It is the only place I know, where death is most alive
It is when truth is turned to lie, that death is most alive
Set flame to the ensnarers and pierce that ornate shield
Branded by what claims you, you wear the mark of death
Tear from loss and agony, a character defined
Stripped of all but tragedy, what life is left to find?
Go now, until there's nothing left
Go now, the dying has begun
It is the only place I know, where death is most alive
It is when truth is turned to lie, that death is most alive
So I flee from all that is me to hide behind this pale dead face
Whatever happened to desire, want and need?
Whatever happened to integrity?
Imagination is a curse in all of this
Whatever happened to the ones left behind?
This is a ghost town, bodies dragged through endless streets
Go now, to never return
I've seen more pitiful humiliation than you could never hide
It is the only place I know, where death is most alive
It is when truth is turned to lie, that death is most aliveEl BajÃ³n es!
No te rajes!
Si te Matas!

Trienta horas tienes dormido Sin tequila no motita
Vas a ver que te va chingar
Otra vez te dicen!To gods of war
To gods of death
A sacrifice we offer you
Three black hearts
Who walk the earth
Your bidding is what we do
Collecting souls
For experiments
Can your system sustain this?
Mutant germs
Coursing through your veins
You won't believe what manifests
We offer death, disease, mutation, annihilation
We'll give you death, disease, mutation, annihilation
We'll bring you death, disease, mutation, annihilation
Our gift is death, disease, mutation, annihilation
To mix and match
Human artifacts
Attempting to mutate beast and man
Can one create such a mutant race?

her voice is calling again
to me with songs of suffering
she sings to me from beyond
repeats your name and the crime you've done
with broken wings, lying six feet under
her blood in your hands feeds my black burning core
with flames aimed towards you
I come with vengeance and hell is coming with me
the silence almost unbearable
brought by the violence of the one
the wrath of god is unleashed
the beast inside has taken the lead in meYou hypnotize me
I do not dare to look
You mesmerize me
Don't even dare to feel
I want to have it just to prove, I can take control
I want to have it just to show them, I won't be fooled
I'll take it, I'll break it or force it just to let them know
Who I am, who I am
I should wait and think it over
I don't want to push, that is not
Who I am, who I am
I'll softly touch this
I'll fire up this flame
I'll hold on gently
It's time to lead the game
I want to have it just to prove, I can take control
I want to have it just to show them, I won't be fooled
I'll take it, I'll break it or force it just to let them know
Who I am, who I am
I should wait and think it over
I don't want to push, that's not
Who I am, who I am
I want to have it, I want to break it
And take it, or force it just to let them know
Who I am, who I am
I should wait and think it over
I don't want to push, oh, no, that's not
Who I am, who I amIn his room - an alien aura
Glass-pipes ,mortars,golden vessels
He knows all,but he must hurry
Working on what seems so precious
He's gonna turn this steel into gold
Applying magic and using his Stone
The artefact he stole from the gods
He'll pay the price - and he says:why not?
Like any searcher, he'd never give up
He keeps on trying to see what is what
He sold his soul a long time ago
He'll pay it back when death takes its toll
In his room - an alien aura
Glass-pipes, mortars, golden vessels
He knows all, but he must hurry
Working on what seems so precious
In the world he cannot enter
Something strange is soon to happen
And he had better find the centre
Of this compicated pattern
Although so close, he ain't reached his goal
Can't stop the race against the clock
He's gonna turn this steel into gold
He's got the key but it don't fit the lock
His bleeding hands no longer feel pain
Why must he do it again and again?
Another move and another try
The later answer - the sooner he'll die
He's aware of the things to come
He should end what he has begun
Wishes he could have more time
In the cards - a cruel future
There is a crack across the mirror
That's a very scary picture
And it's slowly getting nearer
In the world he cannot enter
Something strange is soon to happen
Will he ever find the centre
Of this complicated pattern?[Instrumental]Rage intensifies my desire for revenge.
Hatred flowing in my blood.
My veins expand to release the pure, unbridled, abhoration.
For those who interfere with my life.
They caused me sorrow,
But pain will be returned.
My mind turns to execution.
My sadism fed by their obliteration.
I laugh at their death and scorn their pathetic existence.
Now to non-existence.
The thorn in my side caused me pain.
My logic eradicates at the root of my problems.
Those who would give me pain,
Would also make themselves a thorn.
My cure is to remove the cause.
Remove the cause.
[Music - Simon. Autumn/Winter 1993]
[Lyrics - Greg. 2/1994]Melodic stanzas
are symphonizing their way
through your weary head
To feed your distrust
And fill it's mouth with the desire
to soulfully be one with your creation
Not a subject to control
you call upon a higer power
for help and inspiration
The crowd waits
and turns their faces
towards you expectantly
you give them what they need
But their useless criticism
makes you die
a bit more inside
Not a subject to control
you call upon a higer power
for help and inspiration
Oh, I swoon
while loudspeakers play soft music
Leaning
over your fourtieth masterpiece
You must have loved
the colour of these violins
I wish I knew you
Your fit of insanity makes me sad
I wish you knew
your music was to stay forever
And I hope...
I have no clue
if you know how much it matters
And I hope...From birth an existence of agony begins that ends with execution
Intentionally infected with diseases to then try to find cures for humans
Fractured skulls, broken bones, scalded flesh and blinded eyes
For medical research and cosmetic testing animals suffer and die
Walls conceal the tortured victims of vivisection
Nothing of value can be gained for science or medicine
when the price is a helpless animal's life
An animal becomes a subject - their pain a mere reaction
Harmless testing alternatives ignored - they refuse to end their profit system
The suffering benefits mankind
the excuse for demented scientists whose brutalization
of the innocent denegrates humanity's existance
When education and peaceful protest can't bring their liberation
the strategy for their rescue changes into militant intervention
Every action has an impact
Every life saved is a victory
The truth known by the caring few who wage guerilla warfare to end this atrocity
Severed locks, doors wrenched from hinges,
the animals deliverance from torment and captivity
Vivisectionists dragged into the street and shot as flames engulf the laboratory
Justice's hammer falls again and again until it ends
when the price is a helpless animal's life"As (the ark) landed, the weight of the ark caused the "blood" to spurt the sky
and gave the star of the tenth moon reality and brilliance".
Dogon oral tradition
They came for us
From Ursa Maior's Child
From the Sirius, the dog star
Nommos, beings of other race
Dividing their bodies among men
They give us forbidden answer
For forbidden questions
We are not alone on the earth
We are not alone in the universe
Masters dwelled in water
Saviors, Monitors, Instructors
Crucified and resurrected
Returned to the stars
Home made of sagala
The brightest and the heaviest star
One day in the future
Nommos will visit the earth again
But this time in human skin
And when assume amphibious form
They become rulers of this place.Try to draw that day. Puts maps on a page. Anything to bring it back, moves it all away. Tell it like an accident. 100 in the shade. Banks are dripping sweat for me . They're calling out my name. Sing loud, say it away. Sing it like it's what you want or wear it like a scar. Sing loud, say it away. Baby had a gun, bullets in her other hand, to make it easy to find a place to hid all I know is that one of us wants to see the other die. Hang too tight. All I know is that one of us wants to see the other die. I also know that one of us wants to touch the other's insides. She's alright. It's anything you want. She's alright. Explain it away.As I die...
Stare as eyes uphold me
And wait to see right through
And curse me...
The love has crippled you
Shadows haunt the night
Burning my disguise
As I die
Reaping through the truth
Life becomes untrue
Sin the last diversion
My fate will be untouched
Dismissed now, the anger of a fool
Shadows haunt the night
Forgive me as I die
Taking a chance
And take what you gain
My soul it has no price
Total release is out of harms way until I can decide
You punish me, can't you see, I'm not real
Tears are flowing free, passing by, as I dieRiding the winds
Across tne raging seas
To reach the kings in the land of the lost
A turbulent sea winds of cold
Reaching the harbour, they are safe
Entering the gates, castle of splendor
History of 3,000 years has passed
Walls endless as he no longer sees the sky
Mighty forces takes his hand
As the wolf becomes a part of his destiny
Join us in our search for the land of the lost
Join us in our search for the land of the lost
[*] Once again crossing the raging seas
To enter the forest of misery
Trees are closing in as the moonhawk
Cross the skies
The trail is filled with withering bones
Since battles of old
As they are to spill the blood of the poor
No longer unknown, followed by darkness henchmen
[*repeat x2]
Endless speech, time is running out of hand
Dark forces stands in their way
Trying to bring disorder to his thoughts
Swords of lightning end their will
Once again victory has been won
The meeting is done
Mother earth breaks evil bonds
As his mind is freed
When he leaves the elders
With their supportInflammable, dangerous, impossible aliment.
It must be suffering,
deadly pain,
life will not come back.
Peritonitis, abscesses, divited tissue, the stomach breaks.
Bile is gushing from the flesh,
day by day mind is dying,
infectious, cruel stench by virus of pancreas,
bile is gushing from the flesh,
day by day mind is dying.
Peritonitis causes attack of internal nervous cells,
pain is meddling with quiet life, it's time to die and scream,
Peritonitis causes attack of internal nervous cells,
pain is meddling with quiet life, it's time to die and scream.Un pjaro cantor , se me ha ganado el techo hoy
de donde vivo yo, entre barrios porteos,
creo me avisa que no hay ms, ya se acab.
Asoma el da y yo cargando mi tropiezo estoy.
Poder librarte de tu pena es mi soar
Pues mientras canto, mi pena se desvanece.
Tu garanta de reloco se fundi.
Dormite ya, te lo pido por favor.
Creo me avisa que no hay ms, ya se acab.
Asoma el da y yo cargando mi tropiezo estoy.
Poder librarte de tu pena es mi soar
Pues mientras canto, mi pena se desvanece
Tu garanta de reloco se fundi
Dormite ya, te lo pido por favor.I don't know what time it is
I don't care what day we have
Don't give a fuck about my age
Shall the seasons change
Summer winter autumn spring
March April May don't mean a thing
Let it rain
Let the sun smile
You will never change my way
A crusade against the slavery of time
Sets an example of transcendent liberty
You try to tell me what to eat
Try to tell me when to sleep
Wanna dictate my routine
You try to hijack my mind
You will pull the shortest straw
In the futile fight against
The fugacity of life
You will never change my way
A crusade against the slavery of time
Sets an example of transcendent liberty
(Watch me)
Like eternity
I'll break through time
While this world drowns in its greed
I'll do it
On my own
Like no one's done it before
I don't know what time it is
I don't care what day we have
Don't give a fuck about my age
Shall the seasons change
Summer winter autumn spring
March April May don't mean a thing
Let it rain let the sun smile
I'm not yours
You will never change my way
Like eternity I'll break trough time
I'm not yours
You will never change my way
I'm on a transboundary crusade
I'm not yours
Go out of my way
I can do it on my own
I will do it on my own
And you
You will never change my way
A crusade against the slavery of time
Sets an example of transcendent liberty
Like eternity I'll break through time
While this world drowns in its greed
I'll do it on my own
Like no one's done it before
Like eternity I'll break through time
While this world drowns in its greed
I'll do it on my own
Like no one's done it beforeThe trip begins again
I can't release the voices, never be the same
Silence is my friend...no more
Mind's "I"
I can't take anymore, choking on my apathy
Words that I say don't mean a damn thing to me
Someone else is in here, hiding
Pain is truth, the truth is painful
"I" the one in constant carnage
"I" the two behind the mask
Living in here within my consciousness
Awaken me from the voices of my obsession
Awaken me
"I" of mind's eye
"I" of the storm
The Trip begins again
"I" abandon you and who you are inside
A part of me apart from you
We are dust, the walls we've seen will fall
Forever
"I" of mind's eye
"I" of the storm
"I" the one beyond redemption
"I" the two without the mask
The world we see, the world we see
Has turned on you, on you, and me
The trip begins againI can't feel, and I can't see
I'm falling down what's going on with me
Lord in heaven why am I here
Do I live to rise or rise to fall to shed another tear
One more time I fell that I'm alone
I can't describe it cause it's better to be shown
Feel the darkness covering the spite
Hear me screaming when it's pounding deep inside
Forever I'll be a poisoned thorn
I'll be haunting among your lives
The moment I was born it was time for him to rise
[Chorus]
Deadmaker, deadmaker
Why don't you realize
That he can paralyze you all
My sorrow created by you
And even me cause I'm a self-destroying fool
I feel the spirit growing deep inside
I don't expect your comprehension
'Cause even I don't know whyPray
Pray for death
Pray [x3]
You crossed your last motherfucker
It's time to pay your dues
It's time to make you suffer
It's time to turn the screws
Your pain will be my pleasure
Your screams will make me come
Your useless pleads for mercy
I'm having too much fun
My only plan is to keep you alive
So you feel every burn, every cut of my knife
As I break through your skin and your flesh hits the ground
I dismember you slowly and feel your heart pound
You just crossed the wrong person, torture is my biz
Your fatal mistake, tonight's my revenge
Once you bleed at my feet you thought you got away
Now you beg for your life, I suggest you should pray
Pray
Pray for death
Pray [x2]
I'm barely getting started, this might go on for days
Transfuse you with new blood so you don't fade away
Maybe I'll pull your teeth out, maybe I'll split your nuts
Maybe just hit your chakra, maybe just spill your guts
Haha, you didn't think I'd found you, huh?
Now I got you here
Tied down in a motherfucking chair
Oh, look at you, you're crying now, you're sorry now
What should I do? Let me look at my utensils
Oh, yeah, I got this record death chill right here
Maybe these pliers, maybe this blowtorch
[?]
Oh, look at you, you're crying now
Pray
Pray for death
Pray [x3]
My only plan is to keep you alive
So you feel every burn, every cut of my knife
As I break through your skin and your flesh hits the ground
I dismember you slowly and feel your heart pound
You just crossed the wrong person, torture is my biz
Your fatal mistake, tonight's my revenge
Once you bleed at my feet you thought you got away
Now you beg for your life, I suggest you should praymeeting the elder ones
hel, heloym, sother, emmanuel, sabaoth, agle, tetragrammaton,
agyros, otheos, ischyros, athanatos, iehova, va, adonai, saday,
homousion, messias, eschereheye
their dreams are our fate
gathered - among the trees they seek
knowledge - through the stary night
sacrifices - rites of no purity

"that is not dead which can eternal lie
and with strange aeons even death may die"(The voices inside my head are taking over, they're telling me that my life is in danger. I'm scared that the silence won't come back forever, I believe this is my darkest hour.) I pray, over and over again, that this won't be my end. I still have a long life to live, I'm begging you, begging you! I can't remember the last time, that I said goodbye or that I even cried. I'm becoming afraid, it's already too late, please help me stay alive. I hope this isn't my last night, as I lose my mind, and try to save my life, I'm on my knees, please help me stay alive. It's just too much to handle, I feel my self turn into stone. Desperate! As the voices linger, there's nothing left for me, please save my soul!
I'm running out of time, I can feel the words climbing down my spine. I'm running out of time! (I can't remember the last time) I can't remember the last time, that I said goodbye or that I even tried, I'm becoming afraid, it's already too late, I'm on my knees please help me stay alive. (Take my hand, don't let me fade today, don't let me fade away, don't let me die today.) Take my hand, I'll pray for you today! I beg to see another day, don't let me die today, die today! I can't remember the last time, that I said goodbye or that I even tried. I'm becoming afraid, it's already too late, I'm on my knees please help me stay alive!
I hope this isn't my last night, as I lose my mind and try to save my life. I'm becoming afraid, it's already too late, I'm on my knees please help me stay alive!All has now been broken
On streets I dare not walk
Freedom is an illusion
I build my fences high
If there was something out there
I've learned not to expect
There's a hundred million reasons
Not to care
Don't bring it
Don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me
Don't bring it
Don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me
Wear misery's crown
As always in these matters
You broke the deal of deals
And wasted what was given
To revel in your mess
I gave up all for nothing
I tried my best and failed
There's a thousand million reasons

This is how it all begins
This is how it all begins
Don't bring it
Don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me
Don't bring it
Don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me
Wear misery's crown
This is how it all begins
Come now
Come now

Don't bring it
Don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me
Don't bring it
Don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me
Wear misery's crownBroadway Mary is conversing with her sleeve
She talks with cats they speak to her in Portuguese
Her eyes are clear and grey focused somewhere far away
I wonder where she is today
She loves the sound of thunder
She says God is laughing now
It breaks the silence of the passing crowd
It keeps her warm somehow
Broadway Mary walks alone below the tower
She looks so beautiful I follow her for hours
She won't notice me as I watch silently
she is almost free
She loves the sound of thunder
She says God is laughing now
It breaks the silence of the passing crowd
It keeps her warm somehow
Broadway Mary lies in the shadow of a door
And Mary flies on wings she never had before
I love the sound of thunder
I know Mary's laughing now
It breaks the silence of the passing crowd
It keeps me warm somehowFinally the fight begins over the moor
And we know the enemy is much too strong
In the heart I have no fear, coward I'm not
I'll be riding with the gods, my time has come
Hear the sound of battle horns, I have to go
Is there any glory for me, I just don't know
Balder will you guide my way, give me your strenght
On this field I face the death, no turning back
[bridge]
My sword waits for blood
In the name of Thor
[chorus]
Open for me the gates of your Valhalla
Father Odin wait for me, I'll be there with you
I will not die, I'm riding through the sky
Warriors of eternity, I'll be there with you
Blood was spilled, many were killed
The battle seems over now, am I really still live?
Heimdall, are you watching me from Bifrost?
But I'm not dead, not this time!
Now the fight is over and here on the field
Lie so many broken men, but I still live!
One day I will meet you Odin, but not today
And tomorrow into glory I'll ride again
[bridge]
[chorus]Fierce battles open up in the streets
An infinite timespan of hateful attrition
There is no greater possible honour among men
Than to explode as a martyr
Volatility known as a pure existence
We will kill them with rocks or rockets
We will destroy them where they live
We will not rest until they are dust
Mothers send us your sons
Paradise is waiting, our chances escaping
Total resistance, the truest experience
Delivering the holy wrath of ages
Mothers send us your sons
Paradise is waiting, our chances escaping
Total resistance, the truest experience
Delivering the holy wrath of ages
Expert disposal of unwanted infesters
Kill as one for god
A half-ridden structure of militancy
We will never rest until they are razed
Mothers send us your sons
Paradise is waiting, our chances escaping
Total resistance, the truest experience
Delivering the holy wrath of ages
Mothers send us your sons
Paradise is waiting, our chances escaping
Total resistance, the truest experience
Delivering the holy wrath of agesI want to live in the forest
Between the roots and the branches I lay
On the moss I sit, I want to rest by the river
I want to live in the forest forever
The power of trees, I want to feel forever
Connection with life, animals, and stars
Between the roots and the branches I lay
Meditate the light wide open to the stars
Speak of the whales, deep in the oceans
Speak to the planets, deep universeWhen you praise my name I'll fulfill your expectation
Looking for an answer that'll dignify your prayers
What remains when your savior becomes human?
You feel the legend something sacred
You can't understand
Becomes bigger than the man.
[Chorus]
Pray for help cry out scream for me now
I'm not your superhero
Pray for help cry ill scream for you now
I'm not your superhero
All my love and hate radiate and become equals
Untouchable enmity has always been my fate
Mine alone agony destined to suffer.
Eternally my story never goes as planned
And its bigger than the man
[Chorus]
Once upon a time I would do anything
For anyone; at anytime
And all I asked for was your faith
Was that to much to ask?
There is no God there is no king
There is no saint of broken dreams

ConvulseLessons in might, lessons in stress
Teachings of right, reasons of less
Seekers of strength, only they guess
Will they proceed, or will they suppress
Frequent, illusive, you have the power to follow the one
Decisive, conclusive, the fall of the world has just begun
Wasteful, astounding, violence and force is the only way
Corrupted, misguided, we will lose thousands of people today
The fall of priest Hussein
Allah is to blame
Islamic fools of war
Soon will live no more
Ablative, abeyance, depriving the world with disruption of peace
Deceitful, fascists, holding the fate of the world in our hands
Harmonic, defiance, taking for granted the gift human life
Ironic, compliance, testing the fruits of their progressive toys
Will trade our blood for oil
Until our hands have been soiled
Civilians, pawns and kings
Will pay the penalty
The countdown of the endless problems
All the endless fools soon brought down
Never knowing where they've fallen
Has our Creator been calling
Countless bodies, piles of ashes
Severed mortar, wasteful clashes
Is the worth the whole disaster
Is the life, we're dying faster
Seasons of death, a game of chess
Leaders of pawns, where do they spawn
Just raised for war, to open the door
The door of demise, the deadly surpriseSin ms

you know it's clear this time, the greates fear's within your mind
And all your fantasies are real, and now you can see I see a phoenix rising
Does the dark appeal to you, in everything you say and do
you should learn the reason why
I know your tears can't hide you as you walk among the night
And all your fantasies are real, and now you can see
I see a Phoenix rising from the ashes, after the fire
Phoenix risin' soarin' ever higher
Madness never sleeps, withdrawn into your mind
sometimes life is unkind us you drift between the lines
And all your fantasies are real, and now you can see
I see a Phoenix rising from the ashes, after the fire

And all your fantasies are real, and now you can seeBorn to darkness, the woods forever stand among the gathering.
Upon his eyes the last of the sun's glow.
Ascend the candlelit path to where the gift of life is given.
Beyond all dream is his ignorance to a serene past.
Upon his will you will sleep to an endless dusk.
The howls' of an evening's plague of sorrow rides the land in a storm's mist.
Glaring in hope to witness the breath of a new dawn.
Yet a mystical thought allows him to look upon a sky covered in black satin.
Through profane eternity he drinks the nectar of immortality.
Searching eons for the darkest of pastures.
An emotion filled with such vengeance enrages his coldest heart.

Aislados de toda esperanza y libertad
Llorar sufrir amar creyendo en el ayer
Odiando el presente de un destino cruel
Un mar de mentiras me arrastra lentamente
Siento que algo falla algo ha muerto en m
Otra derrota ms y todo habr acabado
Debo seguir ahora ya no hay marcha atrs
El mundo debe cambiar
El amor no morir
Solo la f ayudar
A secar las lgrimas
Una luz brillar
El cielo se abrir
Tal vez maana podamos soar
Entre tinieblasAs if this could change us
Our roots are deeper than that
Born and bred the masters of
Ourselves
And of our hearts
Take the best of me and
Watch my world fall apart
Still I remain steadfast in my heart
Walk a darkened road and
We will be our own light
Our foundation our core is strong
Stand for what's right
We stand again, it breaks my heart
The anger burns and I fall apart
Seasons change me,
But they won't change my core
I have struggled I've fought for less
Still this I know
Belief within my self
Shall drive me further on
Still I fear that the past remains
And so shall II'm gonna pull you down
I'll take you where it hurts
I'm going to wear the crown of the king of tainted unnatural birth
And the sun has failed
It doesn't reach my sky
Every ship that sailed through the void of the surface is sure to survive
I'll never die
Never die
Drown your sorrows in black waters
I'm waiting
Wait forevermore
All in vain
Nobody came
Drown your sorrows in black waters
I'm waiting
Wait forevermore
All in vain
Nobody came
I've fed on you before
And I will feed again
You never knew yourself like I did, girl I tell you, I am your friend
We'll leave the world alone
Two stories underground
I'll never leave this vicious, delicious, precious treasure I've found
Are you afraid to die?
Never die
Drown your sorrows in black waters
I'm waiting
Wait forevermore
All in vain
Nobody came
Drown your sorrows in black waters
I'm waiting
Wait forevermore
All in vain
Nobody came
I tell you who I am
You tell me where it hurts
You can rest assured that your kind was never meant for this world
Drown your sorrows in black waters
I'm waiting
Waiting forevermore
All in vain
Nobody came
Drown your sorrows in black waters
I'm waiting
Wait forevermore
All in vain
Nobody came[Narrator]we feel so much better here below
down here where the eyes are yellow and gold
we rot inside out, we crack and flake
nothing is better than deep down below
my whole mouth brimming of leaves, submerged and gasping for air
let the earth swallow me whole
fertile graves bury me engulf my bones
eyes full of stone as they close
intertwine with the sediment as we sink into the mire
oh I sense a confused declaration
we beat the horse with a sort of unknown conviction
and nothing ever matters, we sink into the mire
so I lay here tangled in vines and a mouth brimming with leaves
theres nothing to eat but she fertilizes me
we feel so much better here below
down here where the eyes are yellow and gold
we rot inside out, we crack and flake
nothing is better than deep down below
Do you know what it's like to be inside separate from life
a shallow grave for benevolence
submerged we grasp for light but none that truly exists
better then, nothing now, You feel the earth surround you as you fall
inside a new life animates itself
we feel so much better here below
down here where the eyes are yellow and gold
we rot inside out, we crack and flake
nothing is better than deep down below
we feel so much better here below
down here where the eyes are blank and cold
we rot inside out, we fast decay
nothing is better than deep down below[Verse 1]
Welcome to the world, of a driven man
Ten years in the game nothing givenDamn
Rough sport, career nearly cut short
But I plan to lay it down long as King Tut's corpse
I'm a creature, nickname reaper
Spit game ether, kick game Fifa
I have em' moanin like a bitch named Lisa
Paid my dues them shits ain't cheap bruh
I been around boy, I learned a thing or two
Said I was the illest till that shit became the truth
Built it from the ground up and painted too
Made a booth inside my room and now the shit became a zoo
I'm a god if you ask me, aw this is ghastly
Mic into my hand is like a spark into a gas leak
You talkin to the latch key kid I'm used to being alone
And I ain't tryna leave the zone til' I see the throne
[Chorus]
I lay it down somethin pretty, down down somethin pretty hey
Byram in this bitch you know I'm wit it it's on
It's gon' be alright, just follow me for the night, Watch me
I lay it down somethin pretty, down down somethin pretty hey
Byram in this bitch you know I'm wit it it's on
It's gon' be alright, just follow me for the night, I'll take you to the promised land
[Verse 2]
Toast to the nonbelievers, roast anyman that's standin in my way it's time to heat up
I shine the beat up, speak up polish and kick my feet up
I spit that fever, fever, too hot I got to ease up
He's a problem boy, better tell ya friend that raps
When he hear this here it might just put an end to that
That fire water got me wired like a tennis rack
This is that, glad I listened this is what I miss in rap
I pledge allegiance to my craft I swear to never slack
I swear to keep progressing swear to never reaching back
I swear to never gettin eatin by a featured rap
Best you ever gunna do is even dog if even that
Where the critiquers at? who gon' say Elite is wack?
Taking names and at the Grammy podium I'll read em back
Imagine where my peak is at,
It's never too late bitch this should teach you that
[Chrous]
I lay it down somethin pretty, down down somethin pretty hey
Byram in this bitch you know I'm wit it it's on
It's gon' be alright, just follow me for the night, Watch me
I lay it down somethin pretty, down down somethin pretty hey
Byram in this bitch you know I'm wit it it's on
It's gon' be alright, just follow me for the night, I'll take you to the promised landTake these hooks from my flesh,
Cast across the ring of fate
By the fire in thine eyes.
This Temple is reduced to ash.
This Corss this thing of hate,
Desire never dies.
Burried deep beneath a shroud of sleep,
Desire never dies.
Lord have mercy.
Thake these tears and wipe the slate.
Fear not heresy!
Draw the line across this circle of my fate.
Take these hooks from my flesh,
The flesh of a sentient being.
This temple is reduced to ash,
by looking back and seeing thee in chains.Chosen to speak
Truth of the weak
Where is your god?
Truth has been lost
Where is the way?
Whose life will pay?
No one is wrong
Grief is too strong
Lose the way
Pain today
Who can say
Who will pay
No wisdom
No vision
All is lost
Pain is lost
Repeat 2nd verse
Lose the way
Pain today
Who can say
Who will pay
No wisdom
No vision
All is lost
Pain is lost
All is lost
Pain is lostLook outside my window,
I still see a fucked up world
Waking up to helicopter and car alarams,
Does this happen where you live?
Gunshots sound in my my mind
I don't flinch anymore
When I see niggas in my hood,
They're holdin' their dicks tight
Yo, fuck my landlord
I'm a step away from clearing this shotgun
To erase the problem
Does this happen where you live?
Just had steak and lobster last night
Now I gotta rob a liquor store
But it seems so normal
Because it's necessary evil
[Chorus]
Car hit my dog, babies die, raped in a
Stairwell, cop killed a little girl,
Armed robbery, shooter of a drive-by,
Smokin' cain, sellin' joints in jr High
Head from a minor, sex with animals,
Butthole surfers, a fucked up rehearsal,
Lost pawn ticket, wrecked my father's car
Can't pay my school loan, major jack move,
Holy underwear
Stuck in the pen, forced in a gang, plain
Wrapped food,
Fucked up presidents, sleepin' through trash day
Hit a police car, gettin' laid off, gotta pay
Taxes, gridlock traffic,
Jealous muthafuckas, bitch tried to do me,
Hit and run,
I got a fat bitch pregnant
Necessary evil
Little white kid with a cool-aid smile
Training wheels on his bike thought the
Called me a nigga
Pushed that little bastard in traffic so graphic,
He was holdin' his bike tight
He was a victim of fucked up explaining
An american example of fucked training
When the fuckin' bus connected, he flew like knievel
I was just necessary evil
[Chorus]
Necessary evilSprzedaje hasz i inne gwnoLet me be weak
I want to cry quietly
Be like calm see
At least this little moment
And you are the wind
So calm and peaceful
You are the morning
So beautiful and distant
Love me to sleep
Close my eyes from fears
Don't let me fly away
Cause you know I am scared
This restless soul
Maybe finds peace someday
It rages for a time
Untill it burns out and will not be reborn
And you are the wind
So calm and peaceful
You are the morning
So beautiful and distant
Love me to sleep
Close my eyes from fears
Don't let me fly away
Cause you know I am scared
I sing my songs
Stories from deep in me
I tell my thoughts that
I can't say loud
Without playing
A storytellerAll my life been stared
Oh, the misery and pain
Finally I've stood and dared
Like I'd been here to stay
This is for neverending
No more weak to come
This is for journey for free
No more feel, no numb
...Wondering...near to me
...See in...too close to deal
...Dying...all but one
...Come in...soon to be me
All my life lies on trust
Oh, the luxurious lust
Is there a motion must
Like to be wind of dust
This is for strength and honor...
Maybe too good to be true
My doom is for you too
Always life comes for you
Death follows you soonTo my dearest, I hope you hear these words that I speak; honestly at its sincerest, as the days go by we struggle just to survive. Ironically we're not living it means we're alive.
so hold your tongue its not a matter of right or wrong, but if I continue on this road my friend will I never stop to seize the end.
White walls to mask the bars, Then throw us to the wolves.
throw us to the wolves.
White walls, white walls, white walls
guess ill never learn. I guess I get what I deserve, sounds like a broken record haven't listened to a god damn word.
hold your tongue, its not a matter of right or wrong, but if I continue on this road my friend, back and fourth and back again.
will I ever stop and seize the end
ever stop and seize the end
ever stop and seize the end
back and fourth and back again.
will I ever stop and seize the end
ever stop and seize the end
ever stop and seize the end
back and fourth and back again.See the stone circle on the hilltop,
Shining in the light of the moon,
See the druid kneel in prayer,
Praying because his life will end soon.
For fifty years he has walked this earth,
For fifty years he has known no shame,
Now he knows it's time to return,
Back to the earth from whence he came.
See the stone circle on the hilltop,
Shining in the break of day,
See the druid lying in silence,
See the druid who died today.Why do you believe in monsters?
We have been locked up in this evil house
It is where you live with your wicked monsters
We are the prisoners of death and decay
It is where you live, but your dreams betray
You are brave, to feel save
In a mean caress
You are gone, you're the one
We are praying for you
Why do you believe in hell?
Why do you believe in love divine?
In your dark and twisted mind
And with the force of any evil spell
Repulsive hymns will unleash the creatures
Disturbing images of decadence
Where is the beauty between the devils hands?Mammoth to man morbid to god it's coming to take them away
Coming in sight viewing in fright say goodbye to today
Collecting the living collecting the dead
It matters not what you are
The hearse has arrived so step up inside
And into a world so bizarre
Everyone rides on one denied the hearse has no mercy for you
No one can plead no one can beg nothing is all that you can do
Created by god to take them from-earth
And to a place their homes built from dirt
Shrieks from the hearse!! Shrieks from the hearse!!
Leaving them waiting for their demise they stand all alone
And look to the skies, to the skies!!
Brought unto us, gods own dark curse,
Why must they die? Shrieks from the hearse...Tekst: Ivar Bjrnson 1992
Ravnane flyr, den Enyde ser
Inn i tkeheimen, skygger kastes
Minner fra det Frste Riket,
beskjoldet med gull
Runer risset inn, risset inn av hat
Den Enydes horder rir igjen
Hammer knuser kors
Inverseres av den ubundne
Mrke skyer samles, lyset viker
Brent landskap, et tidligere grde
Slagmark for De Frste
Et svart imperium, evig Vinter
Frosne sletter, evig kulde
Lyn og Torden, bud fra De Frste
Evige stormer, en ond monsun
En mur av mrke
Stemmen kaller, sirkelen sluttes
Ulvetider
Sult og nd

Forvent din dd
Krigere hontes gjennom drmmen
Gjonerohring av den Norrne Trone
Under nye flagg
Med sverdone hevet
Ravnone flyr, den Enyde ser
Inn i tkeheimen, skygger kastes
Fallende ikoner i en hellig krig
Svarte vidder, slaget er vinnet

(Submitted by DrkWarrior@vo.lu)[Intro harmony:]
Step by step, we walked the elfdom as far as the pass of Helm
Now waves of twilight wash our shields, shine in our swords
We've reached the elfic mighty oak, over hills await the
legions of the ogres
With new sun the final battle will begin
[BRIDGE:]
Is the bond of our companionship
that will lead us to the victory All the blood that (will)
spill from our
enemies is the only grim reward
Tunes of battle clash, ploughing all the seven seas and
Time is coming fast
[CHORUS 1:]
Far to the world where the dawn is falling
Far, through the lands, against the power of the Dark
To the fields where you hear the calling
Down, to the hills where the wizard of Arthanelron had ruled
[Melody: Jarpen]
Far beyond, over the horizon a sickle of Moon floats in the night
An handful of sparks Branches to roots, blood to the flesh
A spell of ancient ages past, draw the swords and raise
our hearts to glorify
With new sun the final battle will begin
[BRIDGE:]
Is the bond of our companionship
That will lead us to the victory For the life of one that has fade away
Another one will fight for all
Tunes of battle clash, ploughing all the seven seas
And Time is coming fast
[CHORUS 2:]
Far to the world where the dawn is falling
Far, through the lands, against the power of the Dark
To the fields where the blood is flowing
Down, to the hills where the wizard of Arthanelron had ruled
[Hymn: Aydan]
Strong and proud we stand again In circle round the tree of Usdu'm
The shadow in the wood are lengthening Over our fears and beliefs
A frosty blanket's wrapping us In death or glory at dusk it will end
The banner's high on our lances The final clash has begun
[Solos: both, Aydan, Dag'or'dil]
Tunes of battle clash, ploughing all the seven seas
And Time has come too fast
[CHORUS 1 & 2:]
Far to the world where the dawn is falling
Far, through the lands, against the power of the Dark
To the fields where you hear the calling
Down, to the hills where the wizard of Arthanelron had ruled
Far to the world where the dawn is falling
Far, through the lands, against the power of the Dark
To the fields where the blood is flowing
Down, to the hills where the wizard of Arthanelron had ruledI really need a cup of coffee

Black and strongand the chambers led down to the tomb
i followed the walls with crimson hands
adrenaline flowing fueled the fear
visibility zero, heightened my ear
cob webs creeping down my spine
constant feeling of anothers breath
trapped underground with the dynasties
the pitch-black is taking my sanity
entombed in ice
the ever-winding paths, to my mind unfold
whod ever thought, id die so cold
in the distance i see a light,
the eyes play tricks in the abyss
oh no,
oh no,
oh no,
oh no
i feel the icicles from the ceiling
i feel my blood freezing solid
i feel my lips going numb
i feel my soul entombed in ice
oh oh oh oh oh
entombed in ice
the ever-winding paths, to my mind unfold
whod ever thought, id die so cold
entombed in iceIn dark alleys in big swirls
She who dances with the crows
As they nest in her hair
Her halo only grows
She who dances with the crows
Her halo only grows
And she throws me her stars
as she goes along
Her black cape wet and torn
Too dark for the light of day
She sees herself in ivory
As he saw her when he walked away
Pristine in bondage collector of chains
Hurrying out when it rains
To give you her place by the fire
Pristine in bondage she dances no more
Her cape is too heavy
Her feet are too soreSo many times we shared our thoughts
So many moments we were so close
So filled with joy and full of trust We walked along the lightened road
Nothing is left now that I m gone
Now I see your hidden face Nothing is left...
Tied by my feelings in my heart,
I couldn't see behind the mask
It's all past and from this spot now
I can see what you were and what I despise
I'll go my way with compassion towards the light
The decision I took opened the door to take a step out of the dark
What is left of the angry and creative energy that we used to have
When this was supposed to be the most important thing in your life.
Together we developed passion, dedication and trust for this and now that you grow older
You turn your back and everything you ever talked or just thought about is worth nothing to you now. There's nothing left of you!When the sun has wept upon the waveless lake
And the mists steal in with ease
Covened wolves are their eerie dissonant napes
In adoration of the moon and thee
"They call as I to thee"
And I will come, as if in dream
My languid, dark and lustrous Malaresian Queen
Of vengeful, ancient breed
Gilded with the pelts of many enemies
Erishkigal, raven-haired
Thy seduction haunts the castle in erotic despair
I can taste thy scent by candlelight
Legs of porcelain traced and laced to their lair
Appease the beast on spattered sheets
Dyed unearthly red as sobriety weeps
Nocternity
She shall come for me
A black velvet painting sprung to elegant life
Like a poignant Madonna perverted to night
And I have ridden from the westerning light
To expend my lust
Tear away the funereal dress
Know that I will escape from my death
Surrendered to the splendour of her sharpened caress
Lo! The pale moonlight
Weaves a poetic spell of vital death and decline
Of mist and moth and the hunger inside
Kisses took to fever and the fever, demise
"Through twilight, darkness and moonrise
My scarlet tears will run
As stolen blood and whispered love
Of fantasies undone"
Countess swathed in ebony
And snow-white balletic grace
Rouge-filmed lips procure the wish
For lust and her disgrace
Dusk and her embrace
We shall flirt through the shadows
Like a dream of (were)wolves in the snow
Under deadly nightshade
Still warmed with the kill's afterglow
Beneath the stars thy flesh bedevils me
(Beneath the stars taste the death in me)
Bequeath to me thy fiery kiss
To sever thin mortality
Elizabeth
My heart is thine
Thy fragrant words Warm within like wine
"Let me come to thee
With eyes like Asphodel
Moon-glancing, loose desires free
To writhe under my spell"
Ereshkigal, raven-haired
Thy seduction haunts the castle in erotic despair
I know thy scent by candlelight
Immortal flesh I yearn to share
Appease the beast on spattered sheets
Dyed malefic red as sobriety weeps
Nocternity
She shall come for me
Unfurl thy limbs breathless succubus
How the full embosomed fog
Imparts the night to us[Bonus](instrumental)Weapons of steel, horses of thunder
He rides the wind, fighting the sin
Demons and ghosts, he pulls them under
He makes the laws and he will win
Lord of the magic twilight
King of the eternal flame
We're fighting right at your side
Against the creatures of hell
Holy Lord we will ride, straight to the light
We will stand together 'til the end of time
Beware creatures of hell, we will prevail
Riding on a comet for the final day
Loyal and brave, knights of the master
We won't forsake the holy land
Wise energy crosses our hearts
While the king touched our skin, ready to win
Lord of the magic twilight
King of the eternal flame
We're fighting right at your side
Against the creatures of hell
Holy Lord we will ride, straight to the light
We will stand together 'til the end of time
Beware creatures of hell, we will prevail
Riding on a comet for the final day
So we will fight the sins
Killing the tyrant and shedding his blood
To show the world
That the evil is dead for eternity
Holy Lord we will ride, straight to the light
We will stand together 'til the end of time
Beware creatures of hell, we will prevail
Riding on a comet for the final daySilentium obscuritate mira conditus sibi plenum
In areis infinitis axis et super alis aureis spicarum.This holy swine in slaughter, profane in consecration
Potent words of the nocturne cause the fall of faith
Whore of sin to be washed away
Watery grave for the birth of plague
Burial of ideal with war and blood
Worms from graves shall be born by flood
Spoken words of the final war at hand
Mouth of plague inhaling demise of peace
Procession in cold blood
Cursed hands of condemned
Desolate waking loss of breath casting this mold of man's death
Bound to this eternity of shame
Embrace the blood, black witch god
Mouth of plague exhaling wrath
Scathing grace, unclean leach god
Before the age when man was blind
This urge of life was repressed by the light
Now evil has made its claim
With blood of virgin's grace
Lustful taste in venom of this flame
Feed my rage in rapture of pain
Awakening slumber of the beast
Worship in blood this great plague as tears are turned to stone
Left kneeling to this inversion of grace
Consume this word of deceit
Cold of sky to be the hand of cursed decay within a silenced tomb
Feverish mold to be cast beneath the layers of rotting earth
The blood fills chambers of the lungs
Stifling these last prayers
Suffocate in embrace of tainted life
Cold lips of spoken witchery
Outer shell removed from the flesh
The true offering revealed
Legacy in this game of thorns
Transition of birthing a sick king
Forgiveness embraced as this noose is placed around my neck
Salvation in failure condemns this soul to eternal black
Venom seeps into the garden of god tainting this birth of grace
Now lost to hell's hate these wrists shall welcome this escape
Bastard in waking this scourge of storm from god
Hellion to immerse in flood formed from the righteous
Forging this worship to arise
In this awakening of the emergence of the vile
Vengeful cries
Arise from hateNoah Bin Laden
Introducing contraband
Insect and animal species into areas
Devoid of natural predators
Natural selection is fought
Out in defoliated forests
Future nature begins to flourish
And everything begins to changeI saw her coming in high heels
moving like a queen
A little sweet angel but deep underneath
a mean machine
You're lying in wait to make me a fool
you want me to bite
I'm gonna take the bait and the hunter for afters
I'll take you for a ride
I don't wanna play no games
cause I'm a bad bad boy-all around
Let me be your Titanic before you know what's going on
I may go down..
Fucking with fire-I'm coming to rock
got my rocket on fire and I take what I want
Fucking with fire-loaded and cocked
you never miss it until you've begun
with the hair force one
Don't make no mistakes,don't you miss out
on the hell of a time
I'm a real go-getter and there's no doubt
that down the line
I know what you want and I know what you need
your secret desire got the gloves of a man
the hands of a beast
and my pants on fire
And I don't wanna play no games
cause I'm a nasty bad boy-all around, around
Let me be your Titanic, before you know what's going on
I'm going down...
Fucking..I scrawled an ode to this mortal coil
In scarlet upon your back
I gnarled in code with dreadful toil
A parting verse so black...
Ivory skin streched out before me
In frozen fields of pallid grace
Livid eyes rolled back and silently implored me
From out of your jaundiced face
Carving in crimson with scalpel and rasp
Sculpturing your flesh into your epitaph
Your corpse tells its tale in blood, pus and grume
Spilling out secrets you should take to your tomb
A carnal epitaph perhaps best left unheard
The time has come to mince more than words
Parting words don`t often cut this deep
Engraved on your back, the secrets we`ll keep
Though you`ll never read these empty words
Upon the slab you lie so still
They don`t cut as deep as you deserve
Poetic licence to hack, maim, and kill...
The porcelain flesh that enshrouds you remains
Were both my parchment and my muse
Now incarnadined hand I penned these lines
As best I could well manage
I cruelly carved out these designs
What words are worth in tissue damage...
Carving in crimson with scalpel and rasp
Sculpturing your flesh into your epitaph
Your corpse tells its tale in blood, pus and grume
Spilling out secrets you should take to your tomb
A carnal epitaph perhaps best left unheard
The time has come to mince more than words
Parting words don`t often cut this deep
Engraved on your back, the secrets we`ll keep...Proving your heterosexual credentialsI hate you mother fuckers
I hate you mother fuckers
I hate you mother fuckers
I hate you mother fuckers
You can't fucking breathe because
Your heart is in my hands
An overture of pain unleashed
At my command
Hating, ripping, tearing, scraping,
Peeling, beating, smashing, killing,
Slicing, chopping, shredding, splitting,
Mangling, fucking, choking, dying, dead
Worthless piece of fuck
Mass of human shit
Carve out your eyes, shit on your face,
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
Where are the whores when I need 'em
Looking for pussy,
That's all that's on my mind
Sluts that are ready for fucking
Ready for sucking,
Ready to die when I'm done
Copulate and kill without reason
I never need 'em
As long as they make me cum
Bitches have no power of reason
Never believe 'em, just kill and fuck
For fun
You're faceless,
You can't fuck anymore
And nameless, Sodom was too good for
The whore
Skull fucked, fuck your fucking face
With my weed, I smoke every day
If I'm not high, the hate will escape
I smoke and smoke, stoned as a fuck
Weed is my life, weed is my love
So pass the bong, pack up the bowl
A blunt to hit, a fat joint to roll
No, no, it's gone...
I hate you mother fuckers
I hate you mother fuckers
I hate you mother fuckers
I hate you mother fuckersIt's sitting by the overcoat
The second shelf, the note she wrote
That I can't bring myself to throw away
And also
Reach she said for no one else but you,
'Cause you won't turn away
When someone else is gone
I'm sorry 'bout the attitude
I need to give when I'm with you
But no one else would take this shit from me
And I'm so
Terrified of no one else but me
I'm here all the time
I won't go away
It's me, yeah well I can't get myself to go away
Hey, it's me, and I can't get myself to go away
Oh God I shouldn't feel this way, now
Reach down your hand in your pocket
Pull out your hope for me
It's been a long day, always ain't that right
And no Lord your hand won't stop it
Just keep you trembling
It's been a long day, always ain't that right
Well I'm surprised that you'd believe
In any thing that comes from me
I didn't hear from you or from someone else
And you're so
Set in life man, a pisser they're waiting
Too damn bad you get so far so fast
So what, so long
Reach down your hand in your pocket
Pull out your hope for me
It's been a long day, always ain't that right
And no Lord your hand won't stop it
Just keep you trembling
It's been a long day, always ain't that right
Oh ain't that right
It's me, yeah well I can't get myself to go away
Hey, well it's me, yeah well I can't get myself to go away
Oh God I shouldn't feel this way now
Reach down your hand in your pocket
Pull out your hope for me
It's been a long day, always ain't that right
And no Lord your hand won't stop it
Just keep you trembling
It's been a long day, always ain't that right
Reach down your hand in your pocket
Well reach down your hand right now
It's been a long day, always ain't that right
Reach down your hand in your pocket
Well reach down your hand right now
It's been a long day, always ain't that right
Oh ain't that right
Well ain't that right, won't ya
So come onThirteen years I was locked away,
A life thrown under the wheel.
As each day passed, I never looked back,
Just a beat down body with a mind intact
Counting days inside my head
Set the trap, stab my back, then walk away
Framed and judged, left behind to take the blame
Slam the door, cut the cord, and cast aside
I don't care what it takes, you're fucking dead!
I never used to be so full of hate
It just grew and grew by the hour and day
Dreams of death, cold revenge
Now any means justifies the end
All of my thoughts set to kill
I'm never gonna stop
Until I have your head
No matter how long whatever will come
To end your life is my reason to live
I'll haunt and hunt you down,
Traitor of the brotherhood
Defect and run a once and future failure gone
A trail of schizophrenic lies follow your forgotten steps
As fake laughter hides the serpent tongue behind your breath
Veracity expelled, you thrive on your deceit
Lying comes with ease just like your all-consuming greed
The stroke of midnight passed, the penance hour nears
Each nerve alive with fear, an omen of your ending coming fast
Subjected to a beating
I'll choke the life out from your eyes
Subjected to a beating
Only when you're dead can I be free
And God won't hear you fucking scream
Cold blooded homicide is what it takes to be sure
To put my fist to your face and spill your guts out on the floor
Like a thousand red stabs of pain, for each day I was locked away
You'll taste every ounce of blood as it pours out from what used to be your head
No redemption
No regrets
No excuses
Only death
Execution so long coming, finally attained
Gasping out, last words uttered, only were my name
Pure revenge, all consuming, perfectly arranged
Satisfaction, pure elation, nothing else remains
But one less fucking human on the Earth[Instrumental]Originally performed by Elton John
It's getting late have you seen my mates
Ma tell me when the boys get here
It's seven o'clock and I want to rock
Want to get a belly full of beer
My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys
And my old lady she don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots
A handfull of grease in her hair
Don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright alright alright
Well they're packed pretty tight in here tonight
I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right
I may use a little muscle to get what I need
I may sink a little drink and shout out She's with me!"
A couple of the sound that I really like
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass[instrumental]If paradise is half as nice as heaven that you take me to
Who needs paradise I'd rather have you.
They say paradise is up in the stars
But I needn't sigh because it's so far
Cause I know it's worth a heaven on earth
For me where you are.
A look from your eyes, a touch of your hand
And I seem to fly to some other land
When you are around my heart always pounds
Just like a brass band.
[Repeat: x2]
If paradise is half as nice as heaven that you take me to
Who needs paradise I'd rather have you
Oh yes I'd rather have you.
They say paradise is up in the stars
But I needn't sigh because it's so far
Cause I know it's worth a heaven on earth
To me where you are.Knights of terror and insanity
Ruling peoples destiny
Forced by crippeled history
Don't let it come back again
Fear me - your death
Alive - you see
My killing - you
Is here
Men is here - to death
Women i see - in pain
Children - be killed
By fascist slaves
The killing begins
No reason for it
Revenge for a fucking
Massmurderslave
Lidice - burned down
Racist rage - began
Solution - to start
Dictator's insane
Dealing with pain each day, surrender to their suffering
A brutal sttement of power against a mankind insane the pain
Sad youth - alone
Growing up - right now
No idols - for them
Reflecting on it
Searching for - a meaning
In life - so bad
Lies they hear - about
The fascist regimeA barefoot walk, everyday on a winding road. Biting dust in my face.
A captured look...down the shore. You`ll better breathe before.
And you can cry it out, there`s no bloom for me.
Without any doubt, just to wait and see.
And you should scream and shout, to feast on me.
...to feast on me.
Broken steps & stumbling legs, falling down deep. Safety bond & crushing heads.
Laying down...on the ground. No more tears to count.
And you can cry it out, there`s no bloom for me.
Without any doubt, just to wait and see.
And you should scream and shout, to feast on me.
...to feast on me.We are the ones in the mist
Are the darkness breed
We pity the one with the horns
And gaze at the hypnotizing starfire
Without words we communicate
Without battles we dominate
Wings for the wind, bones from the woods
One with nature, never alone
Our origin is unknown
Destination never shown
We never serve and never reign
Sacrifices for the stars, swords for the moon
Thorns and stones for your believes...
A cosmos with one colour but thousand shades
Universe of triumphant souls
For you not to feel, not to see
Your water is no blood
Your music no magick
Search beyond the stars
Nevertheless you can't find us
Our world does not exist
And we never livedI owe you nothing
I've given everything and more
I stand for something
The blood on my hands, the broken bones, I live it
Knife in my back, you can't take it back
Eye for an eye is cut and dry
I'll do what I know, reap what I sow
While you're waiting for me to fail
(If I fall)
If I fall, if I fall
I'm dragging everybody down
If I fall I will take everybody down
(If I fall)
If I fall, if I fall
I'm taking everybody out
If I fall I will take everybody down
I'm not a voice of reason
Never been too big on fate
Seeing is believing
You run from it all, you stumble and crawl, I hate it
Knife in your back, I won't take it back
Live and let die, the art of a lie
You do what you know, you reap what you sow
I'll be waiting for you to fail
(If I fall)
If I fall, if I fall
I'm dragging everybody down
If I fall I will take everybody down
(If I fall)
If I fall, if I fall
I'm taking everybody out
If I fall I will take everybody down
Hey yeah
Hey yeah
Hey yeah
Hey yeah
Hey yeah
If I fall, if I fall
I'm taking everybody down
If I fall I will!
(If I fall)
If I fall, if I fall
I'm dragging everybody down
If I fall I will take everybody down
(If I fall)
If I fall, fuck you all
I'm taking everybody out
If I fall I will take everybody down
(If I fall, if I fall, if I fall)
If I fall I willI was spawned deep beneath the Pre-Cambrian sea,
the scion of a far distant sun...
I have traversed the endless stars,
and journeyed to a myriad galaxies...
The dimensional gates of the multiverse
are mine to voyage effortlessly beyond,
Cosmic infinity is naught to one such as I...
I am as one with celestial eternity...
Clad in gleaming pentlandite armour,
on a whim I may reshape entire worlds,
Or extinguish the blazing light of a sun...
and I remain forever enchanted by sylphs...
I have seen demons lick your ivory hands,
And watched you ride naked upon the backs of fire-dragons...
Your eyes sparkle clear as hoar-frost,
And yet they are thrice as devoid of warmth.
Wielding this power cosmic, the omniverse is mine to conquer!
Our progency shall rule the very cosmos itself!
Arcane power lances from my fingertips,
Life withers before my baleful gaze.
The proud citadels of great antediluvian empires
Have been razed to the ground by my zircon blade.
Your invocations unleashed the great worm
Which compelled the devouring seas to Atlantis...
Riding the screaming crest of fettered lons,
I shall bring my crystalline chaos where order reigns!
Return with me... beyond the stars...
Rule with me... a thousand worlds...
The Galactic Nexus has empowered me
(I am gloriously, eternally omnipotent!)
And as a god I shall return to the Praesidium of Ys!The frozen ground beneath me
To mortal wounds I succumb
All of the pain is ending now
The fallen surround me
I'm lifeless in the scarlet snow
My place beyond is now assured
Send her down to me
Grant this final wish
May she claim me for her own
As the last light drains
Looks into my eyes to see
That the time here is over
Sees all my worth and draws me near
She whispers softly to me
The halls of what await you
Cross the bridge of light into eternity
Drink down the details
Hold them in my heart
Sapphire eyes, flaxen braids
She is my salvation
As the last light drainsI have never known
A lover of my own
So many times I've tried and yet love eludes me
Where have I gone wrong, it's the same old song
Wasting time away, I'm so tired of brooding
I'm here, I'm here waiting for you
Seems like always waiting for you
Who are you that never shows
Keeper of my very soul
I've cried a trial of many tears
Mourning the journey through the years
No once can tell just how I feel
Once again I'm waiting still
Where's the secret hid
So many others find
So many broken dreams yet I'm still dreaming
I'll keep searching on
Until I find the one
Somewhere out there is a love
That needs me
I've been searching for so long
Waiting for my soul oneI'm broken and beaten down
I feel so defeated now
It's me against the world
I feel like I'm the one who's bleeding out
My minds so depleted now
Should I just be leaving now?
Can I restart it all?
Control Alt Delete it now
I'm tired of yesterday
Let's see what tomorrow brings
I'm trying my best to say
These words I keep swallowing
Demons keep following me
Screaming they're calling for me
No more free falling for me
I'll steal the time I'm borrowing
Dreams are dreamt broken
Worlds shattered and choking
And I'm stuck here hoping
There's something for me
We all fall down sometimes
And it makes it hard to believe
We can learn to somehow survive
No matter how much we bleed
We can make it (and now we know)
We can make it (so don't let go)
(Don't let go)
Every time I wake up
It's hard to believe I opened up my eyes
I try to stay up
But I keep on falling and I don't know why
Everything's fucked
And I can't keep living wearing this disguise
Can I change my luck or am I stuck in time until I die?
Dreams are dreamt broken
Worlds shattered and choking
And I'm stuck here hoping
There's something for me
We all fall down sometimes
And it makes it hard to believe
We can learn to somehow survive
No matter how much we bleed
We can make it (and now we know)
We can make it (so don't let go)
After it all
We are the ones who suffer the downfall
After it all (after it all)
We are the ones who suffer the downfall
After it all (After it all)
We are the ones who suffer
We all fall down sometimes
And it makes it hard to believe
We can learn to somehow survive
No matter how much we bleed
We can make it (and now we know)
We can make it (so don't let go)
(Don't let go)Black heart red eyes of a killer
No conscience no regret
Assassination hunger
One blast you're put to death
Lost child no attention getter
All his life he's had to fight
At the cost of an innocent victim
Now mother pays the price
Cold blooded murder, cold blooded murder
Cold blade or lead in the head
Point blank he don't care
No life no place to go
Just knowing no one cares
A shot in the dark or right on the mark
Homicide not suicide
Cold blooded takes pleasure to watch you to die
Cold blooded murder, cold blooded murder
Cold blooded murder, cold blooded murder
Black heart red eyes of a killer
No conscience no regret
Assassination hunger
One blast you're put to death
Lost child no attention getter
All his life he's had to fight
At the cost of an innocent victim
Now mother pays the price
Cold blooded murder, cold blooded murder
Cold blooded murder, cold blooded murderGet away and your life will be released
Give away all your dreams and all your sins
You are playing for forgiveness
You cry for help
When your life is over who can tell
You can't change anything
Your life is just a dream
Nothing real nothing more
Nothing left cause
These are cold black days and
You're fading away
Life cold dark nights
And you're longing for light
These are cold days
And you're running away
To be alive again
To be alive again
Look around emptiness and you are falling
Hear the sound the peal of bells is tolling
You remember sunny days these times are gone
All the lovely words are said and done
You can't change all the things
Your life is full of dreams
Nothing real nothing more
Nothing left cause[Van Drunen / Daniels, Van Drunen]
Lust is our motive
a divine gift
burning sensations
let your mind drift
lust awakes feelings
we usually hide
lust is desire
sets your soul on fire
Lust gives ecstasy, lust is a thrill
hidden emotions, allow you to kill
lust is combition, lust brings greed
lust will show you what you need
lust for passion, lust for sex
lust for life and lust for death
lust is infinity, lust is our beast
reflectiong mirror of forbidden feasts
Lust creates frustrations
burning psychic pains
manic depressions
will drive you insane
put your mind open
enter yourself
discover the savage
behind its mental shell"Depths of Hell"
Carry me into the depths of hell
Where I can find fate that mocks me from an open grave
Call upon the fallen angels
Challenge them to a game of fate
Go forth
Out from the shadows
Aim high just like the archer
Carry me to meet my destiny
Treasures lie ahead!
Beyond the path you seek...
All my desires are all that I have
I wouldn't change a thing
I'm just moving forward with the plan...
Wisdom comes from pain
When I'm falling down I'm cushioned by my faith
When winning by an inch
But losing everything
It gives me reason to push through the ashes of time
God, please save a seat for me...
Taking ahold of this world by the neck without thinking twice
My heart feels so divine!
OH.
Just like a river, time flows!
But not as slow....
It goes so fast
You can barely catch your breath in time
It goes so fast, like a burning match
Or a dreamless night
Am I dreaming??
Am I dreaming??Ich kann mich nicht rhren
Nur meine Hand kann ich schlieen
Ich spre eine kleine Kinderhand darin
Als ich sie drcke, spr ich ihr Leben
Unter mir hat eine Frau begonnen zu beten
ber mir die kalte Erde sich huft
La diese Hand nicht erkalten,
Die in meiner liegt!
La die Stimme der Frau nicht fr
immer verstummen!
Doch wer hrt mich jetzt,
Wenn meine letzten Sekunden
verrinnen?
Ganz langsam nur verlt mich das Leben
Die kleine Hand in meiner erschlafft
Aus diesem Leib ist das Leben gewichen
Die Gebete der Alten sind lngst verstummt...
Nur wenig Luft noch fllt meine Lungen
Alles um mich herum ist schwarz wie die Nacht
Ich spre wie die Pest sich meiner bemchtigt
Bevor sie mich holt werd ich ersticken im Grab
Bunte Sterne beginnen vor meinen Augen zu tanzen
Ich verfluche die, die mich brachten hierher
Die mich zu Tode verbannten aus Habgier und Neid
Wenn nur eine Mglichkeit bestnde, um wiederzukehren
Ich wrde schlachten die, die dies an
mir taten!
Dann endlich verlt mich das Lebenslicht
Lngst begannen die Ratten mein
Fleisch zu fressen
Der Tod ist bei mir und fordert den Lohn
Ein letzter Atemzug noch fllt meine Lungen
Dann ewige Nacht um mich herum
Pltzlich...ein kaltes Licht...Simple minded brain,
For now you succumb
Nothing changes your way
This worlds insists to be the same
Based on our mistakes
The flowers fade along the road
Don't blindfold your eyes,
So loneliness becomes the law of a senseless life
Follow your steps and you will find
The unknown ways are on your mind
Need nothing else than just your pride to get there
Go!
Now we have to face another day
You won't be alone
This life is forcing us to stay
For how long?
Cold is the wind and thunder struck on a stormy night
But can't you see, I'm by your side
We are marching on!
Follow your steps and you will find
The unknown ways are on your mind
Need nothing else than just your pride to get there
So, carry on,
There's a meaning to life
Which someday we may find
Carry on, it's time to forget
The remains from the past, to carry on
Follow your steps and you will find
The unknown ways are on your mind
Need nothing else than just your pride to get there
So, carry on,
There's a meaning to life
Which someday we may find
Carry on, it's time to forget
The remains from the past
So, carry on,
There's a meaning to life
Which someday we may find
Carry on, it's time to forget
The remains from the past
Carry on, it's time to forget
The remains from the past, to carry on
The remains from the past, to carry on
The remains from the pastThe light has killed my deepest emotions
My thoughts are as snowed winterfields
I am one with the pit, enemy of the Sun
Immortal is what I will become
I fear the day, Live by the Shadows of Mephistopheles
We became the Emperors Of the Night,
The destroyers of the crucifix
On lonely nights I dance with the Wintershadows
And satisfy my deepest Desires
Evil powers Bestow upon me and feast with me,
The powers of the Thorned Moon Nanna is with us
Emperors of the Night
I open my arms, cold winds blow through my Soul
My eyes look into the Black mirror
Now I see it clear, eternal Darkness shines
Through the gate, I will Follow...
Hate lives by my side, vengeance is my Desire
I drink your Blood From the Chalice of Abaddon
I howl as a Wolf of Fenriz
I belong to the eternal Shadows
Emperors Of The NightTekst: Ivar Bjrnson 1993
P balkongen skuer hun og lengter
-Isders Dronning
Alene og grtende brer hun sorgen
-Isders Dronning
I landet hvor dag er natt og natt er dag
Ruver et slott med vegger av is, dekket av
rimfrost
Utenfor disse vegger eksisterer intet liv
.. Minner om varme frosset fast i
snkrystaller
I landet hvor vinden grter, bor
tragediens barn
Fdt av frost og kulde, kledd i sorgen
Fra hennes yne renner trer som formes
til perler
.. Minner om glede frosset i perler av is
Kvinnen i isslottet brer forbannelsen
Der hvor hun vil d
-Isders Dronning
En ensom ravn flyr forbi
Den sker videre mot varmen, p vinger
er den fri..
Kvinnen i isslottet brer forbannelsen
Der vil hun d, men vil noen HUSKE?

(Submitted by DrkWarrior@vo.lu)Fix your face hoe
this is not Rap tho
see the truck
look at them they all got 4 doors
Putting bodies in the trunk
I'm about to eat them up
when i see them
call me lunch
Bitches on a hunch bunch
skined them like jason did
put up all your bids
This is not not a argument
look what i almost did
hotter then a pop tart
look at me i'm blazeing hot
i'm coughing on all there bones
they will be no more clones
In this year
they will be no body else
I'm the one this year
Ya'll will never have to doubt
I'm going to be the one
taking all you hoe's off the map
I'm going to be the one
taking all you n*gges off the mapDon't try to seize the time we shared
For all I ever do I do for you just close your eyes and say you care for all we ever knew
I know its true
And I will teach you how to laugh and cry
The world succumb to our pride to our pride
Won't you hold on
And we'll be forgiven
Just you hold on
I'll always be there for you
I know my thoughts are far away
But all I ever do I do for you
One gentle touch is worth the pain
And all we ever knew I know it's true
And I will teach you how to love me
In my dreams you're still in my embrace my embrace
Won't you hold on
And we'll be forgiven
Just you hold on
I'll always be there for you
I can see you
When I close my eyes
When I'm all alone
When I'm all alone
And I wish that
You could hold my hand for a little while
For a little whileStenen under min rygg Ã¤r kall
Ikring mig ligger Natten tÃ¤t
DÃ¤r svarta Ã¤nglar dansar kring min kropp
TrÃ¤r sen snaran runt min hals
Ristar i min hud SkÃ¤r isÃ¤r mitt kÃ¶tt
Och kysser sen min mun
Jag ligger Ã¤n HÃ¤r i Ã¤nglarnas knÃ¤
Ãr jag dÃ¶d?
Eller lever jag?
Ãr allt blott en Nattsvart drÃ¶m
Men smÃ¤rtan skÃ¤r sÃ¥ djupt i min sjÃ¤l
Den mÃ¥ste vara sann Ãh Gud dom har mig ihjÃ¤l
"Och ur deras Ã¶gon rinner mitt Blod"
Jag Ã¤r kedjad fast pÃ¥ ett iskallt bord
Jag blundar hÃ¥rt i min drÃ¶m
Som slÃ¶jor som dras Ã¶ver Himmelens valv
FrÃ¥n hÃ¤r dÃ¤r jag ligger sÃ¥
Slits dom isÃ¤r alla En efter En
Som om byten dom var fÃ¶r en utsvulten Midvinters NattI stand engulfed by the moon-magic of a winter eve's dream,
Enraptured by bloodlust, and nine fire-gems ablaze,
I am beckoned by sylph-spells and the jewelled sword a'gleam,
As the great war-fleet of Ys sails the crystalline waves.come from the skies,
Humans cannot see.
Some kind of spy,
Analysing things;
For millions of year,
I watch the situation,
With no bad intentions,
I see what's going on.
I don't want to guide you or to help you.
I could, but you're not wise enough...
You've inherited,
Of a real paradise,
You twisted it,
In a world of cries !
Using science,
In some horrifying ways,
Always turning, The right things to
wrong.
[pre chorus]
Your fall is coming,
but you turn your back,
On thruth, of the event I see.
The fire, the water, the stone,
Will fall all over you !
But you don't seem to realize;
Oh no, your reign is
crumbling...
You send machines,
And men to stars.
But maybe the future,
Will bring stellar wars.
You want to conquer some new
worlds,
As if you that the earth was
dying.
You want to rule the universe,
To me, it makes no sense.
[pre chorus]
[chorus]
You think you're powerful,
I feel you're power fools.
You want to be the biggest,
Soon you'll be the bleedest !
Wake up! Still time to change.
Arise!
And build prace again.
Do it! While you still have, all the
choices.
I've warned but still Ican't help you.
I could but you're not wise enough.
[chorus two times]I found session, betrayed now, it's on now,
I saw, human, I see so
Well I am certain of, I don't know how,
Other souls beyond this smile
I hate you from the bottom of my heart
I have no fucking right now, I see so
Beside you, I saw, ?,
Other souls beyond this smile
Well I thought now, I said I saw ?,
I saw it, your vanity, your mentality, ?
[Chorus]
Never seen the fooled beast inside of me,
Well I'm an asshole, and I really will always be
So why now, oh let it be,
Is that so fucking hard, oh be dead, I'm free
Burn it hard, make a void that sucks to the suction drive
We need the open thing with my special little part of life
(I tell you!)
I'm accessing in all the northern light,
You know I got no fucking other souls, guilty now
I've got no fine, no fucking thoughts, so,
A combination, now you're fucking dead
[Chorus]I ran with the dead and chased
And chased my own shadow
Built walls, walls of belief
Reaction from the fall
We are ones of will
Desperate and dying
I was, I was along for the ride
The ride of the unaligned
I gave you every word to hold
On a deathless night
Sucking, Bleeding, inside out
If I had gave in
I'd never live that down
I wanted to believe in everything I'm after
But I was drowning in the hell that I raised
And when there's nothing left to say
You wont need a reason
To kill these cancers that may come you way
Long cold wind hits face to remind your not done
Unloved failure. Serves as lessons learned
Faith regained from plagues
What will I find in me
I found, I found in the falls. In the falls
The falls of the unaligned
I gave you every word to hold
On a deathless night
Sucking, Bleeding, inside out
If I had gave in
I'd never live that down
I wanted to believe in everything I'm after
But I was drowning in the hell that I raised
And when there's nothing left to say
You wont need a reason
To kill these cancers that may come you way
I ran with the dead and chased my own shadow
Built walls of belief
I saw the dead rise
I saw the dead rise
Reflection dying with me
I wanted to believe in everything I'm after
But I was drowning in the hell that I raised
And when there's nothing left to say
You wont need a reason
To kill these cancers that may come you wayMany fucking disappointments I experienced in my worthless life
Only the dominion of loneliness is inhabiting me, like a curse
So many days without a smile, just distorted grimaces around me
Damned to drag myself on through a desert full of desparation
[Refrain]
Can somebody please tell me why this is happening to me?!!
Please tell me my name! I did forget it forever
Alone and deprived of all my value in this world
Slowly I'm turning my head towards death's door
(x2)
Suffering from many sores life has slashed into my heart
Beloved friends died for fucking nothing
Deep wounds I'm licking but they won't heal
Damned to scrape a living of sadness and senselessness
(Refrain)
My soul is black without a candle illuminating the holes in it
Darkness fills my lamed extremities
My heart is bleeding from within, fucking blood!
I'm shedding bloody tears from my pale cold eyes
My heart is bleeding from within, fucking blood!
I'm shedding bloody tears from my pale cold eyes
Alone and deprived of all my value in this world
Slowly I'm turning my head towards death's door
(Refrain)
I wanted to taste the beauty of love and life
But these symbols are vanishing and rotting before me
I'm a failure and will approach the landscape of no hope.
No one has ever cared or even recognized my departure
I'm a failure and will approach the landscape of no hope
No one has ever cared or even recognized my departureDethrone mankind[incl. Outro "Perkulator"]

Reversed in time, proceed in time
Swallowed by dimensions

Living is offensive

Your shallow ideals are about as useless

Wake up
Put your heart where your mouth isMy world was crashing down and I had lost all reason.
I turned from side to side looking for excuses to blame you.
I questioned all this.
Though out my reasons.
Are you right or am I wrong.
I want it all laid out.
I want it all.
Without a chance to expect a thing.
Without a voice you said it so clear.
You made a mark that took me surprise.
My world in pieces and I stood beside myself when you put it all back.
Put things in perspective.
I finally see all of these things clear as day.A dream made of plastic
Desire sways me
Death by the central power
Will find you maybe
Torture-awakening
Brain-dead loneliness
Mass drifts with the current
Are they really humen?
I hate this techno-logical belief
I don't wanna talk to answering machines
Mass-loneliness in this age of disease
Why don't you let me hide behind my dreams?
Soul has been left behind
Blind fight into a passion
Sell yourself as a member of the
daily-routine nationWandering restless through the hillside on a cold December day, my solitary journey guided only by the pilgrims high in the sky.
Fog invades the lands blocking the last rays of the dying sun and a veil of mist and serenity gracefully covers the night.
The shadowy trees of the forest, once imbued with beauty and life now twisted and eternally frozen by a shroud of snow and ice.
As the glow of the dawning sun vanishes in the witherd sky my eyes wander up through the whispering winds and watch the glare of the stars dilute.
Exposed to the frost of the icy winds my bittered soul still rejoys.
As the howl of the wind enchants me more than the sweetest sounding human voice.
Freed from mens insanity I feel my grief stricken heart still burn bracing my soul through night's loneliness I sence a glimpse of shelter return.
Burdend with the insight of my loneliness I continue my journey through this night.
Passed have the times when the glimmer of hope filled my heart with gentle delight.
All the years that the currents of fortune have planted the seeds of my grief my eyes have been fooled by the masks of joy, my desperate hopes deceived.
So let us now gather the harvest of the past solitary days.
And bath our peace craving eyes in sin's magnificent grace.
The night shall pass and a cold morning breeze shall obscure the traces of my pittyful existence.
For not a stone shall mark the place where silence embraced me and guided my cheerful soul into the charm of everlasting solitude.This is our small electric space
A place of love a place of hate
Friends that hold you true
Who scares you more than you
Sometimes it's warm sometimes it's cold
Sometimes it's just like your world
Lost track of time lost the whole of you
Lost every thing worth fighting for
So you hide in your world
If ever time could heal your wounds
So you hide in our world
In our small Electric Space
This is our small electric space
A place for joy a place for your soul
If ever time means much to you
Find this place
Tears of gold tumbling down
Feelings that're cold take you far
Forever keeping life so true
Now you're damned
So you hide in your world
If ever time could heal your wounds
So you hide in our world
In our small Electric SpaceCada la noche en la ciudad,
con mi cuerpo en soledad,
caminando por los barrios del oeste.
El insomnio de un amor,
con su futuro de ilusin,
revivi a un joven muerto civilmente.
La gente ya fue,
duerme junto a la TV.
El digestivo incendio es su Dios.Es su Dios.
Gatas y gatos buscan luz,
los perros oscuridad, intudos por la ansiedad
de su instinto.
Elementales del montn, intoxicados de pasin,
sienten miedo al verme lejos de su niebla.
Y la soledad, nos invita a escapar,
por la gran puerta del mundo de hoy.
Donde nadie ve, y pocos temen perder
el hilo de su conmocin idiota.
Esquivando el temor de la ficticia ficcin,
la ciudad se ha derretido en mi cabeza.
Todo es oscuridad, alguien se aproxima a mi,
no puedo ver si es evangelista o policia.
Busco comprender, pero no me deja ver
por la burocracia de su historia.
Donde nadie ve, y pocos temen perder
el hilo de su conmocin idiota hoy.
Digestivos conformados,
pecadores falsamente perdonados.Feared your control and excessive greed
Abuse of your power disgraced me
You want war
You got war
More than you bargained for
I damn you and leave defiantly
Cut you out and take it all with me
You want war?
You got war
More than you bargained for
Always question authority, control my own destiny
Forcing change, breaking free
From the gears of the machine
Changing my world so I can live
Execution, powershift
I will forge my place in this time
Contention is sharply refined
I will expose you and force your demise
To take control of what is truly mineThis house is divided
This house divided against itself can never stand
It takes a new beginning to kill a bitter end
Sing another sad, sad song for the summer time
Scream another sad sad summer song
Divided this house will fall
Bad idea I know
Bet think I will
Bad idea I know
You could never look me in the eye
And feel good about where you stand as a man
You could never stand alone
given where you stand as a man
This house divided against itself can never stand
It takes a new beginning to kill a bitter end
Left me at the last
Good idea you thought
Left to hang myself
Bad idea I know
You could never look me in the eye
And feel good about where you stand as a man
This house divided against itself can never stand
It takes a new beginning to kill a bitter end
Sing another sad sad song for the summer time
Scream another sad sad summer song!
For the summer time
This house will never stand
You could never look me in the eye
You could never look me in the eye
This house divided against itself can never stand
It takes a new beginning to kill a bitter end
Sing another sad sad song for the summer time
Scream another sad sad summer song
Scream another sad sad sad song for the summer, for the summer timeAccording to the Aztec calender 2012 is the end of the world
And time will unwind with a celestial cross in in the sky's in sync
And in line with itself so forget life as you know it
If you wanna view life in the eyes of a poet
Peer through mine in this fearful time
Where wages are cut but tax keeps growing
When the globe collapses on it's axis
Watch men, women and children with axes
Fighting for food cause?
And they haven't got jack shit
It looks like disasters back with a sting like elastic
But on a whole new scale now I'm talking inter galactic
Genocide in a moment of madness
As some set on the end of days
Capital city's burning in flames
Ocean swept your possessions away
Welcome to the end of days
As some set on end of days
There ain't no escaping natures rage
And I've never seen an atheist pray
Until the approaching of judgment day
Buildings burning
Pilgrims verming
Children are serving
Searching for earnings
Old bill are lurking
Circle the circuit
City cameras are perving
Don't park there if you ain't got a permit
Murders occurring but low level crime is the type their concerned with
Yeah with a microchip bill gates is a serpent in person
You relied on emergency service 999 says a lot when you turn it
The devil in disguise all loves been deserted
I'm watching animosity spread like herpes
I visualize alien crafts descending on earthlings
And all homosapiens left in the dirt like worms when there squirming
I smell petrol burning
As some set on the end of days
Capital city's burning in flames
Ocean swept your possessions away
Welcome to the end of days
As some set on end of days
There ain't no escaping natures rage
And I've never seen an atheist pray
Until the approaching of judgment day
Insight into a world of decline
Like Michelle Nostradammas mind
A moment of peace is harder to find
The thicker the skin the darker the mind
? accompany stars that are sent from the sky
A lot of men are repenting tonight
You wasted your life now wave it goodbye
New world orders an anagram of now
So we ain't got time to be standing around
Devil's on your doorstep
He's got you in a tight grip like a fore step thundering downOne day I saw a man
Dressed in rags, with a staff in his hand
Begging for a penny to survive
How poor a man can be
I gave him hospitality
A room, a bed and lots of food to eat
Still I hear his last few words
"I can never return what you've done
Heaven will remember and repay"
Fifty years had gone since I saw him
I was dying and I'd soon be dead
Three angels stood in front of me bed
The first one she said to me, don't be afraid
I will give you immortality, and grace for your soul
The second had eyes of gold, she gave me my wings
The third gave all wisdom, and angel could give
... to me
[Repeat 1st Verse]
[Repeat 2nd Verse]
I joined with my destiny, eternally
I knew I was born again, an angel to be
A vision beyond my dreams, called me by name
So in devotion I spread my wings, to heaven I had came
... to stayYou thought it was over; it's not over
I'll be back; I brought my axe
In the shadows, alone in the dark
Young victims I stalk
You thought it was over; it's not over
I'll be back
From the grave
To mutilate
Axed in the back
Pick through the neck
Dead like the rest
Molested and left
Limbs split in half
I ruptured their flesh
Puncture wounds
To the head
Bone fragments clot to the hatchet
Knee-deep in the blood of the dead
Cranial separation
Sex with her severed head
Rotten walking dead
Hunting living victimsThere are ghosts in every hallway
In every room, behind every door
Peering through every window into the past
Holding onto us in the bitterness of the mire
Leaving a trace of themselves in the spaces in which they hide
...but there are no ghosts here...
There are gods in the wake of every flame
The fire that betroths the coldness of the void
In every wind, every tempest, and every snowfall
In every silence
Inside every root that reaches deep into the soul of the Earth
...but there are no gods here...You're calling me late at night
Spasmodically breathing
You wisper to my tired ear unintelligible message
Sloooooow!!!
Stone it, fuck it!
Don't creep like a pig
You read me your last will while you're sleeping
Your gabble maybe is charming me
But can't you see - you're drowning
I tell you, you must go to bed
I don't know, what I know
And I don't call a medicine man
I should know that you drownLight is fading.
And she is anticipating.
The dawn of the age. The dawn of the age.
When she laughs, when she cries, When she looks up in sorrow.
When serenity dies. She longs for the sundown.
Remember when she laughs, when she cries.
Remember her time, She looks up in sorrow,
Remember her time. Serenity dies. Come back again.
Remember her time. She longs for the sundown.
Remember, white is her freedom.
God seems to hide away.
i mostly succeed in fooling myself.
And i miss you, I love you.
When she laughs, when she cries, She longs for the sundown.
It's her last summer and the heavens bleed.
Life is fading... Remember her eyes.
I still remember her eyes.The dawn illuminates
The field of battle
The legion, ten thousand strong
Frontline infantry, showing bravery
To kill or to be killed
To kill or to be killed!
Standing in fire, the enemy horrified
Torching catapaults burn the dark sky
Driving their flesh into the soil
Conquest the only goal
Seize the land for strength
The war machine runs long
Victory in war!
Vanquish the land
We will crush this foe in front of us
We must show them no remorse
Recognize our mark
For it is for, that lack of faith
We must proclaim their demiseEntered with perturbation
Unexpected hospitable spirits
An experience by mortals
Threnodies and death-bells
Prevailing silhouettes
At this place of calamity
The ceremony, the exhibition
A lack of sounds
Idiosyncrasy scenes
Without any signs of tangible life
A detached world
The abode of the dead
Originated by transfigurations
Perceptions
Consciously carried out
The initiation into the ossuary
The shining light, subdued by obscurity
Gloryng in inauspicious atmospheres
The environs, ruthless and pertinacious
The ceremony, the exhibition
The unassailable leader of the initiation
Veiled in shrouds and dejected in prayer
The solemnity, surrounded by mysteries
The ritual of death, surrounded by non-attendanse
Prevailing silhouettes
At this place of calamity
The ceremony, the exhibition
A detached world
The abode of the dead
The initiation into the ossuary
Now admitted in the spirit world
No possible way out
Incarcerated in the ossuary
Damned to dwell forevermoreHave you ever imagined
Our human destiny,
Placed on a dangerous railway,
Headed by lying leaders ?!?
The more we live,
The more we destroy,
If we follow the way,
Oh!!!We'll jump the rails!
Don't follow this apathy,
Open tour eyes and see.
Train of fools
Blind lead the blind!
Train of fools.
With an evil mind...
So,I'm wondering again,
Do we aim to die in pain ?
There's no easy solution,
But it seems like it's vain,
Yeah !!!
We're slaves of the machine,
That we must feed.
Tacking,rejecting more,
Than what we need.
High speed on earth,
Control it before we hurt.
[Chorus]
Oh!No!No!No!No!No!No
Train of fools
Blind lead the blind!
Train of fools,
Yes,they,are,evil !!!
Yes the blind lead the blind !!!Chewing on razorblades again
Suckling wounds that forever upend
These bastard screams in whirlwind screams
Spoken tragedy of blackened dreams
Poison words fill the air again
With the strength to tear my skin
As the damned engulf our lives
Following the sea of unlit eyes
Retaliation burns a desperate flame
Around my throat
The pressure's building up
I want to make my tongue explode
The bastard screams, they keep calling me
Spoken tragedy of blackened dreams
The bastard screams, they keep calling me
Why won't they just let me die? Won't they let me die?
Ablaze my soul, feel the blow
As I fool and take the delta pain
What I say is that
We feed the deltas to the dogs
What I feel, what I know
Is that I'd find a better life below
Somewhere in the earth
Where I won't hear the sound
Retaliation burns a desperate flame
Around my throat
The pressure's building up
I want to make my tongue explode
If I let go I might have found the way to go
At least I get to feel my nerve
The bastard screams, they keep calling me
Spoken tragedy of blackened dreams
The bastard screams, they keep calling me
Why won't they just let me die?
A bullet doesn't fly a thousand miles away
Just like I couldn't die a thousand deaths
But if I keep this flame of bitterness and hate
It will keep me warm until my dying day
I hear them, I feel them
I loathe them, these words become my worldFather of the world, where have you gone?
The sons you have made are loosin' their minds.
The seed of all evil is now sown in their hearts
War killing machine is never gonna stop.
No! No! No! No! No!
This is not the way to go
The world needs your love!
Where have you gone?
Your child of madness is longing for his life
'Cause war, sickness and death have knocked him to the ground
This world is going to pieces,
We can't make it all alone
We have been forsaken
At the beginning of the end.
No! No! No! No! No!
This is not the way to go
The world needs your love!
Where have you gone?
Slaughter! Illness! Death!
War! AIDS! Drugs!
Fanatics! Priests! Bombs!
You don't care!
No! No! No! No! No!
This is not the way to go
The world needs your love!
Where have you gone?Flowers die, die in my hand
I am the killer
I'll be the one to open up the wounds you're bleeding
You didn't learn
You should've known to keep your distance
Stay away from me
I'll give you everything
If you drink from the poison
I swear I will watch you die
Because my love is the poison
Stay away
You will walk with black skies
I am the killer
I'll be the one who's watching you as you're drowning
Every word I've ever said has been a warning
Stay away from me
I'll give you everything
If you drink from the poison
I swear I will watch you die
Because my love is the poison
Stay away, stay away
I'll give you everything
If you drink from the poison
I swear I will watch you die
Because my love is the poison
Stay away, stay away
Stay awayI remember it all
The magnificent gardens
Groves of flowered trees
As I sit on the ocean floor
Longing for distant shores
How did it come to this?
Why hast thou betrayed the only laws I've set in place?
My sons, how the earth will quake
The sea shall swallow us all
Why did you spit in my face?
This land is disgraced
A kingdom submerged
All we have is who we were
My love
My tormented empire
Unleash the fury
I stand beneath this darkened sky
If you only knew me
On jealousy I thrive
Unleash the fury
This swilling death of my empire
If you only knew me
This day Atlantis dies
The skies are bloody red
You had it made and now I've left you all for dead
Never question the odds
I bring the rage of the gods
I never wanted it to end
This day Atlantis dies
I command the ocean to rise
Take us all
I have spoken
Why hast thou betrayed?It's autumn night,
The pale moon reveals my emptiness,
And my hollow wrath and fear inside
I close my eyes,
To sense her nightly lust once again,
But my rage and thirst won't fade away
Let me feel your pain,
Tears of autumn rain,
Words of blood on the shore,
"There is light no more"
Freezing gale of the night
Silenced the stream of life
Lay us down to sleep
On the crimson leaves
The nightly mist,
The scent of autumn in my heart,
I can hear the winter's song again
My will of life,
Falls away like golden leaves,
I'm just a flame who dies in shadesI was dreaming that I was caught up in the middle of a parade
But I wasn't paying attention to the statement being made
And when I looked up at a banner and saw just what it said
Then I wished that I was somewhere else instead
Because the message on the banner was for white supremacy
And no matter how hard I tried it didn't make any sense to me
So I studied the people around me trying to think of what to say
But the only thing I could think of was to laugh and walk away
I was dreaming that I was talking to a man about his faith
And I was far away from home in some kind of exotical place
The situation was such that when I looked at my surrounding
I got nervous and my heart just started pounding
I realized that I was the only man that was Caucasian
All the people around me looked like oriental Asian
I was a legal alien in a difficult situation
But I could relate to the state I was in when I thought about discrimination
Was I in the wrong place at the wrong time
Or was I in the wrong state of mind
Wrong place, wrong time or wrong state of mind
Wrong place, wrong time or wrong state of mind
Was I in the wrong place at the wrong time
Wrong place, wrong time or wrong state of mind
Wrong place, wrong time or wrong state of mind
I was dreaming that I was at home and when I took a look around
It was as if the entire population had suddenly gone underground
I was standing all by myself and there was no one to be found
The only thing worse than a terrible noise is not even hearing a sound
There wasn't a trace of a human face as far as my eyes could see
I started to feel kind of lonely and I wanted some company
I had to make do with myself and the thought didn't appeal to me
'Cause the only thing worse than to many people is feeling completely lonely
Was I in the wrong place at the wrong time
Or was I in the wrong state of mind
Was I in the wrong place at the wrong time
Or was I in the wrong state of mind
Wrong place, wrong time or wrong state of mind
Wrong place, wrong time or wrong state of mind
Was I in the wrong place at the wrong time
Wrong place, wrong time or wrong state of mind
Wrong place, wrong time or wrong state of mind
Anybody could be related with a monkey in a tree
Or an ancient tribe from Africa but that doesn't bother me
I've probably got lots of relatives that are Jews and nobody knows
Maybe that's the reason for the size of my big and beautiful nose
My family tree is a mystery that comes from all over the place
So tell me the logical definition of a perfect race
Some people are dressed in a darker tan and some have a lighter shade
And I can assure you nobody's sure exactly where they were made
Was I in the wrong place at the wrong time
Or was I in the wrong state of mind
Was I in the wrong place at the wrong time
Or was I in the wrong state of mind
Wrong place, wrong time or wrong state of mind
Wrong place, wrong time or wrong state of mind
Was I in the wrong place at the wrong time
Wrong place, wrong time or wrong state of mind
Wrong place, wrong time or wrong state of mindThe workers all march to the beat of the drum
Their spirits are broken
They have nowhere to run
They dream of courage and a loaded gun
But the slaves all know
They better bite their tongue
Track marks across the planet
Are there any veins left for them to infect?
They would kill one another just to disconnect
Three cheers for desperation
God bless the Godforsaken
We will arm them to the teeth
To fight, to fight the war on peace
All love is lost, so carry the cross
'Cause there's no human in us left
We are music made for the deaf
They play a game that they know they'll never win
Sick and tired of the world they're living in
The messiah showed up high on heroin
On heroin
The workers all march to the beat of the drum
They fell into the trap, taken one by one
The medicine is poison, but it makes them numb
'Cause all that they feel is pain and regret
Existence is just something they would rather forget
Three cheers for desperation
God bless the Godforsaken
We will arm them to the teeth
To fight, to fight the war on peace
All love is lost, so carry the cross
'Cause there's no human in us left
We are music made for the deaf
They play a game that they know they'll never win
Sick and tired of the world they're living in
The messiah showed up high on heroin
On heroin
Is this freedom?
Is this the life you chose?
If this is living the dream, we've hit an all-time low
All love is lost, so carry the cross
'Cause there's no human in us left
We are music made for the deaf
They play a game that they know they'll never win
Sick and tired of the world they're living in
The messiah showed up high on heroin
On heroinWe screamed with passion, can't remember warmer moments, can't recall brigther wholeness, we cried prayers to the sky, charismatic, glorious reflection
Brother, your face blazed of stunning, loving grace, sister serenading, healing as of a mothers embrace, moving me, such vibrancy, holiday, never perishing romanticism has proven frail, now I will pray for fallen angels
Set me up
Set that mic up, epic, disconnected, dramatic, seperate masses ending with emptiness, torn storm, sworn support cut short, forced to form swords of thorns, shredding, tearing each other to dust, furious sluts cut my heart out my chest, white societies divided, slithering slides, a viper came up with my so dodge the cutting con, filthy Judas jealousies, sceneries, scoundrels prowl around aroused by foul sounds of damaged companionship, together sever each other, life will tear us apart, words will tear us apart, life will tear us apart, words will tear us apart
(x2) (Life)
(Words) (x2)
Tear us apart
These things never heal, these course of events will craft a dear soul, steal the danger from expectations, the trail of disappointments, the conscience is narrow, times is not borrowed so cheap, we should die tomorrow, live will tear us apart, words will tear us apart, life will tear us apart, words will tear us apart
(x2) (Life)
(Words) (x2)
Life will tear us apart
This hour, those moments, this hour, those moments, this hour, those moments, this hour, those moments, live will tear us apart, words will tear us apart, life will tear us apart, words will tear us apart

So I'll leave here mama I'll be there, ok

Do or Die Ridin through the cold Chi (riding so high)
Back 2 the game why'all (were back Belo, AK)

(Do or Die J. P. lets ride)
[N.A.R.D.]

Cause please, that be me sparkin sharp and bendin calm in that lac
Bendin hard with ladys slobbin and bobbin
Aww man I been on that chick since back in college
See, she like them top notch with the glock cocked
Put the money and glock block them CEO's who invest in stock plots
Substance blowin out the sunroof with your drop top
Smokin on that chop flop ladys call me pa pa and groupies call me na na
So cha cha like legit do whatever suits that fit you
If paper be your issue, then you be your issue
But this paper make that paper, and this paper make that paper,
This paper make that paper so you stay away from haters
[Chorus, Johnny P]
We ride diamonds in the back, sunroof top,
Diggin in the scene with a gangster lean ohhhohhhhhh.. ohhoohhhh
We ride diamonds in the back, sunroof top,
Diggin in the scene with a pimp lean ohhohhhh my my can you smoke and ride
[AK 47]
You can see it in my eyes when I'm hustlin, burnt up tryin to come up from
Nothing
I be stackin them stacks bringin em back in the back of the lac
Talkin in codes to the burn outs hustlin daily got me turned out
You know my motto to invest and chase that paper like lotto
Follow, tryin to bring back money in car loads
But its hard to listen when you tryin to get that platinum benzy
Or purchase a home for my belo luxury home with a platinum visa
Its hard to imagine something like a nigga tryin to catch an orgasm
Track that feeling like a spasm
Tryin to study passin, got a passion gotta count that cheese
They off in the breeze but it ain't nothing
If you got that paper then say something
Better put it away Cause the day comin when you fall off,
When you just want to hall off with four sawed offs blow it all off
Recognise its the big faces that count, better yet better stay flexed
Check the paper stay stressed and get all the dough whether its fast or slow
Get up to the point where the cash will flow
Burger King and Mcdonalds really ain't the way the best will go
And its so cold in these windy streets
When the ends meet your life will be ends deep with white shit
[Chorus]
[Belo Zero]
This is my motto, pop the first bottle
Louie call 1 3 grab the key then follow
Ride up to my home paid for mansion celebrating you ladys on tables dance on
M O N E why got to have it me I remember hustlin when I was a shorty
Now or a forty X5 5 of those sit back relax and private show
No how it go more money more problem well the problem is you solve it
Don't let the money become you you take it and revolve it
No matter how you get it you hustle and go get it square stick with it
Make sure all the numbers split Cause all of them done did it
The Rockafellers Stellers and Jones
To many other people got paper but we homeless
And let alone this, we chillin while we swervin bumpin 92.3 in the suburban
Hittin curbs in city fresh why'all Proda to the feet bonapetite
No second guess why'all we confess why'all love the curency don't you playa hate
Love the game you can't worry me, you can't worry me
[Chorus]
[N.A.R.D.]
J P, J P
Everybody may not have a great big Cadillac
Gangsta white walls, TV's and antennas in the back (uh uh)
Some peoples may not have a car at all
But they got to remember brothers and sisters (remember)
We still can pimp talk, rotate them gangster white walls
Never givin a dime to a broad (no no never)
And we gone keep on pimpin baby (keep pimpin)
We gone keep on pimpin baby (for real)
Until somebody turn the lights out, so J. P. come on bring us home
[Johnny P]
Yeah, wohhhhohhhohhhh wohhhohhhh

Diamonds in the back, sunroof top, diggin in the scene with a gangster lean
You may night driiivvveee no car at all, ohh myyy
But you can still stand tall, still stand tall... hooo
Cause I'm ridin in my escalade
Ridin
Ridin
RidinDemon, come live in me
Possession, fill me with disease
Temptation, a fire set aflame
Feral instincts help me go insane
Shameless, searching endlessly
To appease the burning urge in me
Hunger of a thousand wolverines
Satisfaction by any means
Demon, replace all I've been taught
Impulse, erase all second thought
Gambling in this carnal game
Nothing is all where everything's the same
Trembling in the balance
Exploring new extremes
All sweet forms of self destruction
Coming to me in my dreamsEpitomizing horror
Echoes it's bleakest past
With willing replication
Let perspective last
Breaking deadlocks
World bleeding inside
Now the tide is turning
In ever present pride
Strategies executed
All now beyond defeat
Analysis, no rise to flaws
See failure as retreat
Rearguard advantage
Third battle forges close
Forceful and evasive
So proud, yet morose
Seeds of future discord
Suspicion, fear and hate
Never lying dormant
One by one negate
No last offensive
All resistance ceased
Forced down the final path
Forwards into peaceDancing in the temple of the mad queen bee
Deep in the cinnamon forest
She offers me crickets, she offers me tea
In the court of her enchanted palace
Asks me if I wanna stay
Sing with the trolls and the fays
Swim in her emerald lake
I'm dancing in the temple
Of the mad queen bee
A sip from the well
I am locked in a spell
Trapped in a grim fairytale
Endless the fun
I wish I had a gun
But I'm dancing forever, from room to room
We dance the fandango, we do menuet
Waltz in her shadow palais
Listen to the strings of a goblin quartet
See the magic ballet
Asks me if I wanna stay
Sing with the trolls and the fays
Swim in her emerald lake
I'm dancing in the temple
Of the mad queen bee
I'm dancing in the temple
Of the mad queen beeDrifting
In the Air
Above a Cold Lake
Is a Soul
From an Early
Better Age
Grasping for
A Mystic Thought
In Vain... but Who's to Know
Further on Lies Eternal Search
For Theories to Lift the Gate
Only Locks Are Made Stronger
And More Keys Lost as Logic Fades
In the Pool of Dreams the Water Darkens
For the Soul That's Tired of Search
As Years Pass by
The Aura Drops
As Less and Less
Feelings Touch
Stupidity
Has Won too Much
The Hopeless Soul Keeps MatingCome to my dream, my beautiful life
Nobody knows, nobody can stop
Come to my dream, my sweet agony
I feel like God, I feel so free
Join us on the rubbish of life
Like us you'll love the despair
Join us on the rubbish of life
Like us you'll love the chaos
You understand, you believe
You understand, you know
How to explain when nobody can
Another dimension
How to believe, you understand
How to believe, you know
How to explain when nobody can
Another dimension
Come to my dream, my beautiful life
Nobody knows, nobody can stop
Come to my dream, my sweet agony
I feel like God, I feel so free
Join us on the rubbish of life
Like us you'll love the despair
Just want to say you know
Just want to guide your steps
Another dimension of physical lawsWhy the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
arm out like a Nazi - every cunt's driving past
where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone. I can't see anything!
the hardest part of today is a hangover
empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
and it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night. I can't remember anything!
"Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead.
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs"
We are done with giving a fuck[instrumental]Wasting time on my own thoughts
Pulling me in so deep
Thoughts of you in our little world
It makes me cold
It makes me weak
I self destructed
I reconstructed
I owe this all to you
For a while you let me forget myself
But once again
The real me is alive
I put myself here
Look what it's done to me
I'll keep myself here
Now watch me bleed
I wanted to believe in you
I tried to believe in the lie
It was a lie
Now you see what it did to me
It was a lie
I'm self reliant
I'm self confidement
I owe this all to you
You showed me that I'm the only one I know
So once again
The real me is alive
I put myself here
Look what it's done to me
I'll keep myself here
Now watch me bleed
I was taken apart by what I never knew
I was taken apart
The ugly part of you
The ugly part of you
Spend time with the broken man
I owe this all to you
I was taken apart by what I never knew
I was taken apart
The ugly part of you
YouAnother body emptied from soul
Engulfed by my infernal breath
Blood lust over me I'm losing control
Condemned to suffer you'll rest
As you follow me into infinity
The sweet serenity is broken
By the angels weep and there will be
Bloodshed - Godshed
My soul has turned to black
Nothing exists now but pain
I shall no return
Dead I will remain
And you'll follow me into my lechery
Bloodshed - Godshed
I must be bloodfed - Bloodborn
Another body bleeds from its soul
Victim for my infernal need
I'm in control, your blood in me
Condemned to suffer my insanity
And you shall lead me into obscurity
Bloodshed, Godshed
I want to see you deadIt's time! I've returned back to life again tonight.
My short length life consecrated to evil...
For so many years every night I leave my coffin
and with my bats I'm transformed into a bloodsucker
looking for your blood.
Every night I sow the terror
and before sunrise I leave
the hot sign of my kiss of death.
You common mortals can't fight against my curse
and of your lives I become the only master
until I will see you bleeding.
I've been immortal for such a long time
for centuries I am the king
but cross and garlic can bring me fear.
Yes, I'm the vampire, the king of the night
Yes, I'm the evil, I am the master of your nightmares.
I am the vampire, the prince of darkness
I am the devil who craves the blood of the human race.
Come with me in the reign of night
taste the flavour of red-hot blood
Enjoy yourself in doing evil
and sit with me at the left of the Devil.
Leave your troubles out of your life
to suck men's lymph you must be able
and when nightime brings you back among the living
you will fly as an immortal, screaming your fury.Sudden implosion of silenced emotions
Buried beneath a scarred heart for too long
Delusions of hope fading away
Dying like leaves on frozen soil
My apocalypse is near
I can feel the end, coming here
Neglecting existence repulse and repent
An endless journey into the morbid
Whispering voices distorting all senses
Buried beneath a scarred heart for too long
My apocalypse is near
I can feel the end coming here
My apocalypse is near
I can feel the end coming here
The bitter taste of a dying dream
Shine the light on our shadows and illusionsWhat happened to my life
What happened to my pride
I'm a victim of your love
I can't cope with this world no longer
You have my fate in your hands
I'm on the verge of self destruction
I don't see a way out
If this was your intention
To turn me inside out
What's the reason of my life
There's no pleasure in my heart
Now I'm disillusioned
And I had so much more in mindIntruder alert continues to flirt
And stagger and trip up my life
The sinister thoughts unfairly rots
My brain can't put up a fight
Oh, the nightmare
Can it be put to an end?
The fact is I know
I'm not dreaming again
Steel on my skin
Oh, carve with that knife
Crisis of life
I'm falling, I'm falling
Crisis of life
Carving my mind
I'm falling, I'm falling
Crisis of life
Mentally, physically draining my skull
Of every thought entering
(How)
Feelin' just like a voodoo doll
About to be struck by a pin
Oh, the threshold
Comes to a staggering halt
Even though the guilty
Don't know it's his fault
Steel on my skin
Oh, carve with that knife
Crisis of life
I'm falling, I'm falling
Crisis of life
Carving my mind
I'm falling, I'm falling
Crisis of life
Oh, the knifes dug in
Carving my life
Oh the life is him
Overflowing amount of impatience
Crisis of life
I'm falling, I'm falling
Crisis of life
Carving my mind
I'm falling, I'm falling
Crisis of life
Crisis of life
I'm falling, I'm falling
Crisis of life
Carving my mind
I'm falling, I'm falling
Crisis a crisis of life
I'm falling, I'm falling
Crisis of life
I'm losing it,
Crisis of life
Crisis of lifeI'm not insane
That's how it seems though
Spiteful cruel but wise
Beyond his age
My body fails
My soul will rise
The end of life's immortalized disease and agony
And I see death through golden eyes
Beyond the door
There's something more
It seems there's just one way
On through the heat
I've felt the touch of evil
I still feel the icy claw in me
For a decent price
I've banned kindness from my heart
The spirit of all truth and beauty
Pawned for my desire
And from the flames
As chance would have it
The soulforged will come into light
And from the flames as chance would have it
The soulforged,
The stainless will rise
I will never change my mind
I will leave it all behind
And through the hour glass
Everything's grey
Everyone's pale
No colour nor beauty will enlighten my heart
The seat of life's empty and cold
Cadaverous you all seem to me
Stillborn but you're still alive
You're still alive
Truth lies in loneliness
When hope is long gone by
I'll wipe out the bliss of the new age
And welcome you precious night
And from the flames
As chance would have it
The soulforged will come into light
And from the flames as chance would have it
The soulforged,
The stainless will rise
From a distant time
Voices echo in the hall
"Come and join us
Enter life and everything is gone now"
And through the looking glass
I still fear mortality and its loss in the end
Unlimited power in my hands
The claw of the dragon ascends
"Mourn for his lost soul
He's cursed and condemned"
Each step I take
May it hurt may it ache
Leads me further
Away from the past
But as long as I breathe
Each smile in my bleak face
I'm on my way to find
Back to the peace of mind
And from the flames
As chance would have it
The soulforged will come into light
And from the flames as chance would have it
The soulforged,
The stainless will rise
I will never change my mind
I will leave it all behindThat was her first time
That was her last time
Cut at your face
Blood in the sink
You'll hate your-self
Till the day you die
Till the day you die
Blood on your hands
Blood on your legs
Why does this happen time and time again?
Time and time again
Blood
I should have sown my heart in my chest
Are eyes should have never met
Eyes should have never met
Never met (2x)
FINE, FUCK YOU THEN
Slit wrist savior
She cuts to see blood
SHE CUTS TO SEE BLOOD!!!The guest of omniscience
Forthright eloquence
To behold the end of horizon
Observation of foresights
Inhaling circulations of the soul
The aura of stars, the fusion of frequencies
Measure of all, the blur of the frame that ceases
The certitude of generations adherent
Porpotual folkways of the soul sphere
I grant my visions, the burden I bear
The aura of stars, the fusion of frequences
Measure of all, the blur of the frame that ceases
I am midst by the cause of reality
Entwined by the senses of fantasy
I have walked through fields of grievance
Eras of spiritual fragmentation
I have walked through the wood's of peasants
Dawn of the souls solar morning
The certitude of generations adherent
Porpotual folkways of the soul sphere
I grant my visions, the burden I bear
The guest of omniscience
Forthright eloquence
To spear the hallow star
Conservation of the solar fuse
Exhaling circulations of the soul
The aura of stars, the fusion of frequences
Measure of all, the blur of the frame that ceases
I have fallen through spheres of diversity
Eras of ending spiritual solemnity
Opened the gate of ion fire
The warming well of wisdom
Soul sphere - the fusion of senses
Soul sphere - the pulse of energy
Reflection of a soul's tear
Soul sphere - the fusion of senses
Soul sphere - the pulse of energy
"I am the soul in the sphere. The sphere of the heir"
The certitude of generations adherent
Porpotual folkways of the soul sphere
I grant my visions, the burden I bearTen heavy feet walks the bloodsoiled ground
With rhythm these five warriors march
No matter how much the bleeding wounds
From enemy sword cuts, hurts to the bone
The revenge they sought was taken in blood
No mercy was showed, no mercy was showed
They ignore the pain that hammer like pounds
From falls off slain, horses to the ground
No signs of weakness, no signs of weariness
Not even a glimpse of remorse in their eyes
They slew men ruthless, fed the wolves with flesh
And now they leave this land side by side
Now they're headed home, five swordsmen who fought repentlessly
Their story will be told of five brave men endlessly
All sorrow is left for women to bare
The children cries, they'll live in fear
No man has spared, no house or farm remains
No Christian woman, their church consumed by flames
Their steel shines red with enemy blood
It sings of victory granted by the Gods
And as they return bleeding but proud
The horizon turns and the song is ringing loudNight in the mountains comes with the fly of a raven
Carpathians bathed in the light of the moon
In the old ruins where the dying shadows
Are watching the shine from the stars
Nobody remembers days of glory
Several hundreds years passed in silence
Not a soul has been seen here
O am standing on the hill
So silent in the sky
I am drinking the cold of this night
Old gray wolf flying upon my feet
Is licking the hand of mine
It is night: in my heart
It is moon: in my eyes
I am hidden in a fog - my own breath
Small village in a valley
Sleeping in fear, in a fear of me!
Loathsome race of mortals
Magic of wolfish teethes, wings of bats
Faithful guards of religion
Old as the blood itself
The cult of the undead
Vampirism
Frenzy of lust, frenzy of pain
She was only fourteen
No cry has burst from her lips
Pity that she had to die
But bow sweet was her neck
It is night: in my heart
It is moon: in my eyes
I am hidden in a fog
My own breath
Sometimes only my anthem of triumph
Echoes in mountains landscape
Like blood from thorn opened arteries
Poison flows down the tongue
Somewhere far away a howling can be heard
Oh, how beautiful is the night in Transylvania!Free my mind
Heal my scars
Erase the past
Dark days to forget
And memories to last
In my heart
Free me now
Make me forget
And forgive
There's no use
To go on and live
Show me a way
To the sun
Heal my scars
Nothing will be forever gone
Memories will stay and find their way
What goes around will come around
Don't deny your fears
So let them go and fade into light
Give up the fight here
Let my eyes take in
The beauty that's here
That's left on this earth
My ears long to hear
A melody
Give me sight
Nothing will be forever gone
Memories will stay and find their way
What goes around will come around
Don't deny your fears
So let them go and fade into light
Give up the fight here
Poison is slowly seeping through my veins
Stealing the only dignity in me
I pick them up and let them fall
To cause your pain and hit them all
[grunts]
One more life to live is what I want
I'll take the joy away from them
See to it, they will all be damned
One more chance to heal what I have harmed
The dragon is wreak havoc in my brain
Plays my emotion, a never ending game
Nothing will be forever gone
Memories will stay and find their way
What goes around will come around
Don't deny your fears
So let them go and fade into light
Give up the fight here
One more life to live for me
I want the night just to color the day
The morning to chase all my nightmares away
Don't you deny that we're all human beings
We all have our flaws that can make ourself obscene
Obscene
Give me what I want
Give me what I need right now
That's what I want
That's what I need, get it!
Dolendo novit mortalis vitam
Tell me what I want
Tell me what I need right now
That's what I want
That's all I need, cure me
Dolendo discit mori mortalis
Losers
Nothing will be forever gone
Memories will stay and find their way
What goes around will come around
Don't deny your fears
So let them go and fade into light
Give up the fight hereIt's been after me
In this place
A pleasant threat perfect void
Stuck in modality
With all this damage beyond repair
When all our time fades away
Just like everything else
That proves that we are
Dirt
Stay
Now just in case
Selfish trials
Keeps stopping to
Drag me down
I'm losing bliss
As if all your hands
Could keep me clean
When all our time fades away
Just like everything else
That proves that we are
Dirt
I can't see where I've gone wrong
All our times fade away
That proves that we are
Dirt
If all our times fades away
It's proof we're dirtShow me your bloodbath oh sweet rapist eyes
As all the __________ of lullabies
Burnt at the stake, ______ souls filled the skies
Sacrificed for all humanities lies
I submit a demon and tuck into bed
I don't recall exactly what was said
It tied my hands and my feet to the bed
I don't recall exactly what was said
You've got the look that make detectives itch
A mouth full of thunder and feverous pitch
A cross between satan and a ______ witch
Your disposition would make hitler flinch
Oh sweet rapist eyes
Look what you've done to me
You've burnt down the temple
Where the children were sleeping
Ashes and smoke rose up to the sky
The memory's blown(? )
As the future dies
Show me some sympathy
In his image God made me ugly
____________
You are so beautiful
____________
You are so beautiful
Don't look at me with those sweet rapist eyes
Perhaps it's the wine or the soft candlelight
I'm under your spell, I'm all yours tonight
The phone's off the hook and my tongue is tied
Oh sweet rapist eyes
Look what you've done to me
You've burnt down the temple
Where the children were sleeping
Ashes and smoke rose up to the sky
The memory's blown(? )
As the future dies
Ashes and smoke rose up to the sky
The memory's blown(? )
As the future diesDare not to inflict upon my wishes
Dare not to obstruct upon my path
Dare not to pretend to lick my wounds
When all it means is opening another
Dare not to inflict upon my wishes
Dare not to obstruct upon my path
Dare not to pretend to lick my wounds
When all it means is opening another
Purity comes with birth
Reassigned through the slit
Spawned out of the shadows
The light is once again lit
False regrets
Deepest of despair
False visions
Reservoir of grief
False regrets
Whatever presence
False visions
That graced my spirit
Whiffs of clarity
And universal understanding
Come and go
I'm too young and too old
To continue this worthless fight
I've seen through the darkness
To understand the value of night
Though I seek validity
From the Ides of March
I watch the darkness
Open its jaws
Whatever presence
That graced my spirit
Is for whomever
I choose to inherit
Dare not to inflict upon my wishes
Dare not to obstruct upon my path
Dare not to pretend to lick my wounds
When all it means is opening another
False regrets
Deepest of despair
False visions
Reservoir of grief
False regrets
Whatever presence
False visions
That graced my spiritBlank sheets enveloped in grieving. Foolishly bleeding for you. Waiting. it was never meant to be today. Window panes colliding and worried drips of sweat that have fallen from my chin. The devil devoted and she brought this trembling. all of this collapsing, I seed through. Seized ceiling preaching sinister color. I reach to anything recognizing and it all comes back to you. You with your hands would heal all my scars and so I as, 'after I lost everything would you hold me and would you love me until this spine could hold this head up high again?' that's all I'll ask, I won't ask. He is dead.Reflex in the sky warn you you're gonna die
Storm coming, you'd better hide from the atomic tide
Flashes in the sky turns houses into sties
Turns people into clay, radiation minds decay
Robot minds of robot slaves lead them to atomic rage
plastic flowers, melting sun, fading moon falls upon
dying world of radiation, victims of mad frustration
Burning globe of oxy'n fire, like electric funeral pyre
Buildings crashing down to a cracking ground
Rivers turn to wood, ice melting to flood
Earth lies in death bed, clouds cry water dead
Tearing life away, here's the burning pay

watch me bleed; I'm lying on your feet
dying, living for just one last breath with you
I live, for you and only you
stop lying; you know i'd lie with you
se're dying on the inside
you're smilling on the outside
settle the score. Knife vs, Face round 1
forget the taste of me and follow your instinctThe disengagement of the bubble is hypnotizing.
Some say below the doughy crust the beast is rising.
We like to talk about the past
We like to talk about the past
Well we talk about the past like it's the strangest dream
Then we repeat the things we never dreamed we'd do.
I understand that sometimes we all must dance with fuckery,
But everybody's pissing in the well of our suffering.
I want to breathe in all the ashes of the books they tried to burn.
I want to feel the pages in my skin and understand the words,
Castrate fiction, call it circumstance.
They say her wanderings are dangerous, all she wants to do is
Dance.
Dance.
Question period's over.
Don't you feel it? I do.
You'll be pummeled by the certainty of minions.
It's a puppet show, a theatre of opinions.
A of flack.
Feeder of the pack.
You can hear the shaky timbre of the voices most alone.
Yeah, it's easier to sing within the crowd.
Those who pretend to believe hardest
Might actually begin to
The nature of the bliss the warmth of ignorance gives into.
I want to breathe in all the ashes of the books they tried to burn.
I want to taste resilience on my tongue and love beyond concern
Mass-grave subtlety, leave it for the birds.
They say the world, it might be dangerous, but all it seems to do is
Turn (Bitten by the hand that feeds you)
(Holding to what you're beholden to) Question period's over.
Don't you feel it? I do
(Holding to what you're beholden to) Question period's over, don't you feel it? I do.
(Holding to what you're beholden to)I bear these scars
A constant reminder of my own inadequacy
I've held everything and nothing all at once
And all at once been altogether broken
But even scars fade with time
Only You remain
And my determination is not enough
Even so, I bear these scarsMerciless suicide realm
Treacherous antichrist haze
Sacrifice your life to me
The monarch of inhuman seeds
Send your corpse away
Rid you all of pride
Fucking time to die
Torture you even when dead
Bury the way of the lamb
Cover your body with chains
Mourning throughout the land
Send your corpse away
Rid you all of pride
Fucking time to die
And the scars I will see
Like the face of the moon
Cast no blessings at me
Necro as fuck!
And the scars you shall see
Like the face of the moon
Cast no blessings at me
Necro as fuck!
White burning sands
Pale yearning hands
Fainting hollow eyes
Necro-world will fucking rise
Come on!
White burning sands
Pale yearning hands
Dying Jesus son
Atrocities have not yet begun
Send your corpse away
Rid you all of pride
Fucking time to die[Chorus]
You give me for honor (graves)
Where your soldeirs lay (graves)
They're so far away (graves)
The home of the brave (graves)
I won't die in your bullshit wars no more
I won't fight to my death for you
I won't watch my poor mama cry no more
Muthafuck your red, white and blue
[Chorus]
Thousands of men go to war to fight for
Politics which they don't understand
Murder people who they never met
When they make it home they're
Considered a vet
Fire drops from the sky as the young boys die
Far from home, all alone, it's a sin
All you get in return in a shit shallow grave
Cause in war there's no way you can win
Mia, yeah right, you think they give a fuck,
You're just pawns in the game off the board
Brainwashed to the point where you kill at
The drop of a dime
But it's not called a crime
Vietnam, persian gulf, did we win ? Did we lose ?
Thousands die, human beings you choose
Once in you're owned by the man,
Uncle sam is his name, you're his slave,
Shallow graves
[Chorus]
You give me for honorVoi olispa aikaa

hÃ¤n lÃ¤htenyt sittenkÃ¤Ã¤n poisI travel over high mountains
Through deep valleys and forests
Crossing great rivers
In search of knowledge of the gods
From far beyond place and time
I hear a whispering wind,
It teels me to strive on
Through the horizon of my thoughts
I am the mindtraveller
My quest is man's destiny
Teach me secret holy spells
And the wisdom of the elderly
Gazing into my mind
Entering my soul.
Is there not a secret to unfold.
(Here I have advices to be told)
I am the mindtraveller
Seeking wisdom of yore
I am the mindexplorer
Striving to know so much more
Spirits of history fill my soul
With divine old words
I am on the right track
Out of the haze I'll emerge
I reach unknown corners
In the back of my mind
Never been here before
Still I recognise it all.
I hear the whispering voices
Clearly all around me,
Echoing in the valley
Where magic intellect dwells
Finally I can see the blind
Not knowing why they exists,
I hear laments of nature,
Where led the path we missed?Life is a game we should play
According to the rules
But where is the fun
When we're not allowed
To play sometimes?
Burn baby, burn baby
Burn your heart for me
Smile baby, smile baby
Let the sun shine for me
Nothing exceeds like excess
It's hard to say no, boy
Make a wish, take a bite
That apple is waiting for you
Burn baby, burn baby
Burn your heart for me
Smile baby, smile baby
Let the sun shine for me
I know the stakes are high
Welcome to the limit
Close to the cigar
It's the roll of the dice
Burn baby, burn baby
Burn your heart for me
Smile baby, smile baby
Let the sun shine for me
Just smile and let the sunshine in
It makes me feel alive tonight
Just go on
Burn baby, burn baby
Burn your heart for me
Smile baby, smile baby
Let the sun shine for meA statistic
At this moment, there are more black males in prison than in collegeMother Earth gave the people
All they ever needed, wanted.
They got a paradise to live in
Eden thrived and prospered.
Life was simple, nature valued,
Earth was giving, the people willing.
Nothing was missing from human
generous was Mother Earth.
In the weak mind of Men jealousy, gluttony took over
And all that they wanted was to own more.
Eden was violated-the vicious, corrupted city
Was swallowed up by the sea and disappeared!
Mother Earth she looked at Eden,
The exploited land, vicious Men.
Took no pity for the city,
Enforced a demise to the land!
She roused the seas to rush to shores,
Swallow all in Eden's doors.
The ingrate people and their city
Taking for granted everything!
In the weak mind of Men jealousy, gluttony took over
And all that they wanted was to own more.
Eden was violated-the vicious, corrupted city
Was swallowed up by the sea and disappeared!Forged in blood, raised in hell
Our souls, forever lost
Bodies feel the iron force
The anvil meets their flesh
Evil grabs the tortured souls
Of lives they did possess
Hatred in between unfolds
They're coming to distress
Our souls, forged in blood
By demons of the dead
Our mind, evilised
Abused to serve the bad
Our flesh, set to rot
To feed the ones below
Our blood starts to spill
And cleanse the sins we owe
Signs of death unto the wall
Bloodlines of the past
Creatures from the other side
The suffering is vast
Forged in blood, victimized
The truth depicts the lie
Lifeless bodies torturised
Slaves of flesh will die
Obey the sign of hell
Pounding into flesh
Breaking the morbid shell
And revel in their flesh
Condemned to bleed and rot
Crushing in despair
Forged in fucking evil blood
No one will ever care"das was wir lieben mssen wir lassen, nur das Leid ist lang"
you have my words, you know my thoughts
you have it all, all for you
blackness all around, your hand took mine
you know it, too, the Flower, remember
words are hard to find, to catch the spirit
that charmed my soul, that crippeled me
that piece of life you held, you mesmerize still
it haunts me all the time, you are in my dreams
you remain may it be again
you remain eyes as the rain
you remain time in pain
you remain I wait in vain
I've creid for you, I cry for you
why can't it be alright, why can't it be forever
it is disillusioned, but still I don't know
I can't see through, what do you do
you remain may it be again
you remain eyes as the rain
you remain time in pain
you remain I wait in vain
I am in your dreams
the ones able to recalled
and those disremembered
and the ones that don't come true
you wish that those fragments may not dissolve
for there are some
there is one
who can make this picture whole
eyes and hearts and thoughts, to see
my life, a hand to hold, to be
tears reign in heaven, rain for me
oh lead me back to ecstasy
tears fall on the Flower, fall on you
tears fall on the angel, fall on you
I'd give it all ip, now for you
(please) return the joy when I'm with you
give me a souvenir that reminds me of you
I'm standing here and I think of you
some of us are precious, some of us feel pain
in my mind, you remain
I call your names, all the more I feel (the sorrow)
I reach out for, may I not feel (the strange and the fear)
you remain may it be again
you remain eyes as the rain
you remain time in pain
you remain I wait in vainThere are too many stones
And life is just made of glass.
Mark the words of the fool
He will tell you the truth, oh so cruel.
You say and I will believe
Although I stumble and fall.
Deceived by my own eyes.
Trust is a gamble with pain, roll the dice!
Give my your confidence
And I'll lock the door.
Offer me the same
And I'll be busted to the floor.
Take a walk upon the ice
Or ride the light of day.
Dance with flames of fire,
You will burn with the words, of the liar.Standing in line
For something to eat
Dragging my ass
Dead on my feet
No more possessions
Just my clothes
Down on my luck
And I'm sure it shows
No confidence
No self-esteem
When I lost my love
I lost my dream
Aching heart
Head and soul
Sleepless nights
Are taking their toll
Back to the hotel
On welfare street
A beer, then bed
'Cause I'm so beat
Walk down the hall
Just to take a piss
Never thought I'd
End up like this
The obvious conclusion
The inevitable end
Death will be welcomed
Like a friendThe eyes, looking so cold
Condemn failure
And seek for perfection
will never be attained
They're judging the denying face which stares back
A bewildered revelation
Show me objectivity
And let these eyes judge again
You cannot touch what you can't ever obtain
I'm inexhaustible
As well as empty in my bitter search
My words are yours,
my voice speaks for your thoughts
I am your mirror without remorse,
your reflection without doubts
I fall and fall
I must learn from the bruises
The scars will be my guide
There's no excuse in ignorance
No time for weakness or regret
Face your mirror without doubt
Your reflection without remorse
If knowledge was wisdom
And wisdom the key to inner rest
Teach me...Stop talking stop talking to me.I can read your book from back to forward.All I really wanna do is live my life.I don't wanna have to deal with you by my side.Can you dream of a day when it's said and done.They must be getting tired I see them marching one by one.Stop talking stop talking to me.Drag him up from the back of the class,No more excuses this time we won't let him pass.Call me up in the dead of night;Take it upon myself to make things right this time.I'll shoot it down with my bow and arrow.No more excuses this time I'll bring it home son.Stop talking stop talking to me.Lately I've seen these things rarely ever go my way.I'd like to return the favor paint this picture gray.Leave things behind me leave things behind me.I want to paint this picture gray,wouldn't you,wouldn't you?I want to paint this picture gray,wouldn't you?Who was born here and danced with infancy?
The stones let me go, (but) to make a difference their names are kept,
expecting half with nothing to find.
Like a lighthouse, a wild nothing moved to an empty place
tended embers of life fires, envelop, something wide and moral.
It takes and leaves, flicker, heavy, growing, leeched.
The son will rise.
The son has died.Rabies is a killer, is a killer, is a killer, is a killer yeah
Rabies is a - killer!
If I scream
If I yell
Mad dogs and englishmen go out in the midday sun
To keep away from the canine freind
Till you know that the day is done
Man's best friend is what they say
Keep away from him or you're dead
Foaming in the mouth ain't no joke
It will drive you out of your head
Rabies is a killer, is a killer, is a killer, is a killer yeah
Rabies is a - killer!
If I scream
If I yell
Mad dogs and englishmen go out in the midday sun
To keep away from the canine freind
Till you know that the day is done
Man's best friend is what they say
Keep away from him or you're dead
Foaming in the mouth ain't no joke
It will drive you out of your head
Rabies is a killer, is a killer, is a killer, is a killer yeah
Rabies is a - killer!Touch me!
I am a disease!
Clean me!
Imprisoned in flesh I am!
I am sin!
Smell me!
I am a slave!
Release me!
The impure flesh I am!
I am pleasure!
Taste me!
I am life!
Kill me!
Punishment I am!
I am beauty!
Feel me!
I am cold!
Cleanse me!
Purify me from all life!
I am free!In the horizon by the fall of the dark
Even today appears silver and glossy like my jewel
In the darkness a cold diamond
The touch of dreams
A ceramic flute sounds in your picture
"Why the sun also doesn't shine on the reverse side of the moon?"
I ask myself when your light divides my room into shadows
Lots of clouds in a face of white dust
Imprints of stellar heaven messengers created your face
Lots of old-men know your outlines surely by heart
When they can't sleep in the dark nights
And I'll also grow old and my hair will become a silver shine
As grey as yours
And like all of us
I'll forget the stupid dreams which oppress me
And I'll again silently whisper to the darkness
"What are you hiding, why can't I know your reverse face?"[Reflections Of The Wanderer/The Passing Of The Newborn God]
I am come into these celestial lands; the dreaded journey is at an end. Time has passed, ages gone and lost, and the
wandered returns to his home within the dead sky, to behold as, at the starlit dawn, Lucifer, the morning star, welcomes
the Moon and Sun to return. The night is passed and I am as the last shadows to dwell underneath the foliage of the mighty
Oaks and the boughs of the Elms of old. Evanescent, Everfading are my lays and all that I have achieved. And how could blind
eyes see the grandeur, deaf ears hearken the sound? To such senses does my life ring unto and all the waves I leave behind.
Wearied I am, with all hope long departed, all zest long gone. Where could I go ere I fade? Wither could the starborne paths
ever take me that I would find more, to find nothingness, the true existence of All. Alike my Goddess, one with pain and
sorrow, one with joy and ardour, hands joined in a union of strangers, we walk onwards, yet our horizon is bleak, sundered
and bloody. Evanescent, Everfading are the autumntide colours that bleed upon us. Like a wailing wind the maidens of Fall
awaken from their sleep. And the night remembers I walked on the shore of the flaming sea and dreamt upon the sands of
burning sorrow. Soon they are gone, with only show to usher us into the sleep of the eviternal Winternight that is yet to
come O Winterwind, will you caress me? Your somber songs are like dreams that pass oh so swiftly, dead dreams, the hollow
sky I am one with the thousand sagas of the crimson age, I am one with the songs of the whirling, now dying season, I am
Evanescent, Everfading.[Music: Z. Nilsson / Lyrics T. Dahlstrm]
You say that he will come once again
And his mission is to rule the world
Wake up from your dreams
Face reality read my lips
Second coming never Crhist denied
Forever Jesus dead
You think that he will come once again
So you can walk the clouds
Let me kill your dreams
As we speak this will never be
This I've heard before
New dates, new years, new lies
This I've said before
Your lord will never rise
Forever nailed!!
Still you live your dreams high on hopes
For the second coming of your Christ
Your world avobe the clouds
Are erased and destroyed
Second coming never Christ denied
Forever Jesus dead
Crying on your knees when you see
No coming of your Jesus Christ
Holy bible bleed and I see
The world is dead in your eyes
This I've heard before
New dates, new years, new lies
This I've said before
Your lord will never rise
Forever nailed!!
Jesus will not come
No!!
Jesus will not come
Second coming never
He won't rise
Christ will never walk again
Dead on his cross
No rise for Christ
You say that he will come once again
And his mission is to rule the world
Wake up from your dreams
Face reality read my lips
This I've heard before
New dates, new years, new lies
This I've said before
Your lord will never rise
Forever Nailed
Jesus will not come
No!!
Jesus will not come
Second coming neverTrapped in a cage all their lives
death is salvation, the last spark of hope in their eyes
white God created them all
to perish for beauty and colours of arrogance
Lack of emotion for life
the hands of their hangmen are grabbing with hard grip of death
screaming in wildness and pain
no chance to escape, executed for mankind's survive
Do you want to get rid of it?
try to and see you can't flee from your shadow
remove now the veil from your eyes
crator of horror, you mirror tells truth from your liesBy the ruins he stands
And he's waiting for me
To enter Tanelorn
His paths seems strange
But they're always planned
Seldom he succeeds
About his own fate
He tries to conquer it
Again and again
But at last he's almost
A ruined man
Not a king or God
Who's searching for
A place called Tanelorn
Far beyond your dreams
On our quest for Tanelorn
We lose our way
On our quest for Tanelorn
He's waiting
He's waiting for me
He's waiting
He's waiting for me
[Spiritus sanctus - vita aeterna]
Darkness falling down on me
Darkness - The eternal battle rises
I know the answers
Although they don't exist
I'm just a mortal illusion
On our quest for Tanelorn
We lose our way
On our quest for Tanelorn
So I'm his companion
Through space and through time
His eternal servant
He's calling me
So I must leave
To any life
To another world
Far beyond Your dreams
To know the truth
Just for a while
He's longing for a place
Where he can find himself
Deliverance
It could be everywhere
How can he find
He's waiting for me
And for Your Tanelorn
On our quest for Tanelorn
We lose our way
On our quest for Tanelorn
We lose our way
On our quest for Tanelorn
We lose our way
On our quest for Tanelorn
We're left alone8
So now the bridges are burnt
A lesson learned?
Promises broken
Tender lies softly spoken
Changes in you
Changes in me
Maybe it was never meant to be
It wasn't you
It wasn't me
We were far too close to seeGouge out, your eyes, pull your, heart to the floor,
With my heart my skin my kiss, stand back drop to your knees,
I'll stand back as you bleed, my heart my skin my kiss
This blade it feels so cold, baby hold me while, I'm shaken,
This knife has pierced my soul, I sit alone while, I'm shaken
And yes I'll laugh out loud, with blind eyes, I'm shaken
Gouge out, your eyes, pull your heart to the floor,
Sweetness love me, tastes me, hears me,
Stand back drop to your knees,
I'll stand back as you bleed,
Sweetness love me, tastes me, hears me
This blade it feels so cold, baby hold me while, I'm shaken,
This knife has pierced my soul, I sit alone while, I'm shaken,
And yes I'll laugh out loud, with blind eyes I'm shaken
Now take me out of this place
Now take me out of this place
Out, take me out, take me out, take me, out,
Out, take me out, take me out, take me, out
Take me, take me, take me out
Gouge out, your eyes, pull your, heart to the floor,
With my heart my skin my kiss
Stand back drop to your knees,
I'll stand back as you bleed with my heart my skin my kiss
Yes I am,yes I am,yes I am, yes I am
My heart my skin my kiss
Gouge out, your eyes, pull your, heart to the floor,
With my heart my skin my kiss. stand back, drop to your knees.
I'll stand back as you bleed,
Sweetness love me, tastes me, hears me
Wait for them to come again, and take you away from me
I can't wait for you to come again and take you, black rose dyingDesperate for entertainment
So I turn the TV on
There's people jumping up and down
Then they have the panel on
And they talk a lot of wind
They talk a lot of wind
Then they have the weatherman on
He used to teach all our friends
He talked a lot of wind
He talks a lot about wind
Then they have Carl Lewis on
He's got a ponytail and he's a vegan
He talks a lot of wind
He talks a lot about wind
I turn the tragic lantern on
It's a program 'Good Morning'
It's a lot of wind
They talk a lot about wind
I'm real sick and in distress
I got octagonals in my eyelids
From watching all that wind
I get horrible horrible horrible dreams
So I ring the TV line and get a lot of wind
They talk a lot of wind
You see them selling carpets
You see them in the shops
You see them on the kids programs
And they talk a lot of wind
Oh the boredom in my bones
From belching a lot of wind
They talk a lot about wind
They talk a lot about wind
I gotta forget about the wind
Has a lot of nerve
To talk a lot about wind
There's a roly-poly, roly-poly man
He's got a yak haircut (dick, dick, dick)
They talk a lot about windGrant me the powers of thunder
And give me a sword forged in the raging Hell's fire
Lend me the eight legged black stallion of Odin and I'll have my vengeance,
oh, I'll kill with desire
Vengeance flows like boiling poison through my twisted veins
Tonight I'll blood shed with wrath and set the night on flames
Invincible in battle, war gods hear my death wish cry
I'll laugh in the face of death, I into glory ride
Snarling breath upon your backs, I'm vengeance incarnate
Now it's time, the moment's comed, stand up now, face my hate
See the fire in my eyes, the final light you'll see
I send you to the darkness with my sword of thunder and steel
[Repeat second verse]I am falling from the top
I am drinking from a cup
I came in search of paradise
With nothing much in my mind
A thousand eyeballs shake me down
The up and downs of time's to come
Satisfaction comes and goes
Biological action and it force
A problem of leisure measured in terms
Of pain plus pleasure plus poison sperm
I wear the look of false alarm
Some ought to twist my armMan and his faithful ethics
Intoxicated by the fruits of the earth
Diabolical fanatikism, so cold and grim
The perfect perversion, bestiality incarnate
As instruments of torture
And leaving no room for sympathy
We bring forth the monstrous birth
To the worlds light
As all great art is made from suffering
So are we
Good in nature, but evil by our own free will
Incestuously created by the will to kill
Time is here to walk the final abyss march
Bound to the force of the last holocaust
Pour free the gifts of grace
And slaughter the entire human race
Not permitted to redemption
When pain rises high in purgatory
A reality so convincingly justified
Feeding from Death Cult's gown
We bring forth monstrous birth
To the worlds light... As long as winds will blow
My pride will be
And a star will shine
From far away...
...As long as winds will blow
My pride will be
And hate remains
Inside my heart
At night a star did shine upon
What once was build on my ancestors' land
When once I was young
Willing to learn
From the old and the wise
...As long as winds will blow
My pride will be
And hate remains
Inside my heart
Evening fell unto this land
That once was build by my ancestors' hand
When I was young
Willing to fight
...for as long as the winds will blow...Presume upon god's misery
Bring forth the majesty
Be emotionally prepared
Arise - sickness - arise...
See birth prevail - embrace him
Welcome the eclipse within
See the invisible walls drenched
With the blood of his eternity
Scream for the beast
See his world reign
Scream for the beast
As he devours your pain
A psychological disease
Your world - his world
Counteracts the will
Your fear - his pleasue
[Lead: Persson]
As you awake from the slumber
Memories fade in darkness
Blinded by invisible walls
You await to embrace the dusk
The victims cries released
By your minds fury
Your lust - his instincts
The beasts paradise - god's hell
Scream for the beast
See his world reign
Scream for the beast
As he devours your pain
[Lead: Holm]
Inseminated by the beast
Your flesh is his to control
The mind has become enslaved
An absurd theatre from which he feeds
No hope - no escape
The trigger in your mind is released
Monstrous desires reveal
The collapse in barriers of sanity
As your victims beg for mercy
Your grim laughter echoes
Sickness is now one with the mind
Brutalized - sodomized - buried
Scream for the beast
See his world reign
Scream for the beast
As he devours your pain
A psychological disease
Completed and fulfilled
Your will has become the machine
Of his pleasure - your pleasure
Your pleasure...Summoning the beast,
through lust and murder,
by separating your torso with my claws,
and devouring your heart and soul,
I am one with Him
blood we drink from the chalice on this night,
flesh we consume in this infernal rite,
death on our tongues,
hate in our lungs,
let's bring forth the feast of blasphemy,
to this who know not it's strength,
we are the army of Satan,
with symbols of the goat,
daggers to their throats,
we execute the Children of Christ.
Candles are set,
rituals commencing,
vulva's dissected,
priests hung by black nooses,
crucifixions and texts burn within our very presence,
marching through the streets,
in black robes and swords,
bestiality on the lambs is now the end of man,This weight on my chest is too much to bear for me
These ribs have collapsed
The pain is only made greater by these broken bones peircing through my heart
My breath can only escape through a heartbeat,
But it beats no more, and I choke
As I pluck these pedals from my marguarite,
I chant the song of hope of the broken hearted
"She loves me, She Loves me not"
Days go by, Flowers wilt.
Lord I'll call you joy through my trials,
Thorns have shed the blood of life,
While Roses shed tears
I will not follow crooked thorns that lead to dry and faded roses.
I'll walk on the mount of skulls.
As I pluck these petals from my marguerite I pray the she loves me...
but she loves me not
I'll live drenched in the blood of my king
I'll live drenched in the blood shed by a kiss
She loves me not... He loves me
"The LORD is close to the broken hearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit"
[-Psalm 34:18][Music: Schuliga/Aldridge, Lyrics: Dower]
Consigned to the tomb, to sleep, to dream forever.
Rotting... dissolving in my grave clothes, my
flesh turns to soup.
A distant thud, as a shovel parts the earth.
By moon lit night, a looming shadow... sunken
eyes, gaze up to the stars.
My shrouded, decomposing corpse,
sprawled on frozen marble.
Carefully unwrapping,
your putrid, fly-blown prize.
Disrobed you sit upon me,
straddling my death remains.
Momentum slowly building makes a horrid
slushing sound.
[Ch]
[Ch]In my head there is a tiny world
it's so huge
it's so small
When I see the light on the wall
of my room
I get happy
I get so sad
Tightly and slowly I go around myself
And I try to look, i try to find something common something else.
The clocks are ticking from one to one
The midnight hour my shadow meets
My own reflection My shadow meets my own reflection
You faded away like a line drawn on the water
I'm fulling again into deep see of my mind
We touched the stones on the ground
And we played those to be the jewels
of our crowns
And you squeesed my hand
And wispered a sentense
And our eyes were bright
And our feet were dirty, so dirtySometimes I feel I'm drowning in the shallow
The deep end is just too far for my reach
Eyes filled with dirt, buried in this shadow
Maybe someone will pull me out, pull me out
Ripping its way inside of me
Tortured, the shell that confines me
Burning and redefining me
I try to be free away from this place
To rise above the ruins and take a breath
Sinking under the ocean of hatred
Can I swim to the surface?
Ripping its way inside of me
Tortured, the shell that confines me
Burning and redefining me
I will murder the negativity
Take back the strength that it's given to me
Now I'm redefining it all
So long inside this place of solitude
I scratch the walls until my fingers are bleeding
The stains never seem to go away
No matter how much I rub, they stay the same
Frail from all this place has given me
The cuts and the bruises burn like the blood stains
Crawling on the floor, slowly to the door
I try to open it up but it seems so far
Ripping its way inside of me
Tortured, the shell that confines me
Burning and redefining me
I will murder the negativity
Take back the strength that it's given to me
Now I'm redefining it all
Take back the strength that it's given to me
Now to redefine
Take back the strength that it's given to me
Now to redefineFeel me, the pain is mine
Give up, won't see no sign
God that's me on the throne
Above you on my own
[Chorus]
I'll lead you to the place
Where you can see
My real face
The things you know regret -
Despair is strangling you
Dancing in red
See me laughing
About your care
Your pictures much too fair
Promises were raped by me
Your mind in haze -
Too dark to see
[Chorus]
I am evil, can't you see
Your purity, your honest zeal
Your weakness and your being
Make me sick
And one day
I'll break your neck
[Chorus]Blood covering this place
Like crust upon my eyes
Adrenalin in my veins
Pain upon my face
Heat growing in my head
Burning flesh inside
Bound to old memories
Which never seem to cease
Dark vision's all I see
Haunted by the past
Thrust aside the killing time
Hope for the unborn
State unsafe for the deceased
Escape the mental squeeze
Tomb of living memories
Define the life I lead
Darkness takes over control of my life
I'm willing and destined to leave
Once on the top, now down with my mind
Apparently held to deceive
In the line
I'm on my new way to the other side
The journey's about to begin
Don't know to where or to what this shall lead
All systems and feelings exceed
To the ground, to the ground
Tomb of memories
You fake; you run; you hide from the truth
In a world you deride
You praise the facts which prevail for all time
Like your preconcepted mind
Words that you spoke
Promises you broke
Tales of lies unheard
Your false, synthetic kindness, now
The true yourself unfolds
Blood that you bleed
Hate that you seed
Pain inflicted bodyMany have faded in silent garden,
faded and perished
Scarlet leaves increase on meadow,
where I was once with you
"I have shed tears for love
like winds I dance the leaves away
those scarlet leaves"
And This immense cradle of leaves
I shall ignite on flames
And I gaze how sheet of flames
billows submit serenity
I kiss your, glacial tear and your cheek feels so real
You tread away from me and
you fade, fade foreverI am burning for you, my life
Like a fire without the flames
I am smiling to you, my love
Like snow to the glowing sun
While sunrise sheds its golden blood
On fields of our hope
Colour of sorrow is our religion
We dream of our desired lover - death
The wind glorifies rusting leaves
Infinite time shines upon our hope
We are shadows of our own
Light of fire
Guide me beyond my conscience
Death, take me into your lifeMy mamma wants to know
Where I'm spending all my dough
Honey, all she does is nag, nag, nag
But I won't apologise
I'd inject into my eyes
If there was nowhere else to stick my skag
All I want is brown
And I'm going into town
Shooting up as soon as I'm back
My friends have got some good shit
All I want is some of it
Gimme, gimme, gimme that smack
Well I've ruined nearly all of my veins
Sticking that fucking shit into my arms
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Givin' up, givin' up givin' a fuck
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Givin' up, givin' up givin' a fuck
Getting off my face
There's a dragon I must chase
Honey, I'm the scourge of all mankind
And everyone but me
Is destined just to be
Slaves to the remorseless grind
But I found myself an easy way out
Sticking that fucking shit into my arms
Into my arms
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Givin' up, givin' up givin' a fuck
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Givin' up, givin' up givin' a fuck
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Givin' up, givin' up givin' a fuck
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Givin' up, givin' up givin' a fuck
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Givin' up, givin' up givin' a fuck
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Givin' up, givin' up givin' a fuckThe time was a dispassionate observer
The frost was penetrating his thoughts
It saw what was hidden inside
His cold kisses made her blind
It was better to pretend that
She didn't know the truth
Even Though she knew
Beyond the shell of her body
She hides her bloody tears
She has hnown the taste of grief
She knows what it is like
When the world falls to pieces
The shapes and shadows
Of their trembling bodies
Plaited in love embrace
This view is engraved in her soul
Her love sleep in the cold ground
The shapes and shadows
Of their trembling bodies
Plaited in love embrace
This view is engraved in her soul
The pain is a painter of artificial smiles
[written by P. Maslanka]Some people want stars in eyes
Some people want eyes in stars
They've been like that for years
They've been like that for years
I suspect they're just if if if
I just want room to live
There's a new club in town
Plenty of space to posy around
It's a copy of the Peppermint Lounge
(I'll stick around the center always
Even if it is run down.)
Some people want to be joining the club
Thinks to be on the clientele is big
I just want room to live
Foreigners and experts go in
And through my place
Turn my home into a museum
Like the murder squad
They scan the room
For the well of inspiration
They don't tolerate ordinary folk
and folk look at me strange
But I'll give them this at least:
They pay for what they eat
Visitors and peripherers never give
I just want room to live
Some people think happy is way to live
Some men want to cram up to women
I've been down that street before
It just makes meat out of the soul
There's a D.H.S.S.S. Volvo estate
Right outside my door
With a Moody Blues cassette on the dashboard
There's no hate to the point I give
I just want room to liveWell worn wings crumble
too tired to forgive and too battered to ever forget
I am the labour I am this
I hang as your beloved hex
I'll bring the nails and fevers of bad dreams
Nail him
Burden her
Kill you
Bury them
Its all the same
Great leveller, try to forget my nameon a day like this
Holding your rope, try to forget me nowNever could we see
What lies deeper
Seeming that our view
Can't be changed
Deciding where to go
And believe in your disaster
Deleting a future untold
This is the final deceiver
This is the devil in me
Expecting deeds in the making
Will show no final relief
Ever would we dance
With the reaper
Seething in a monstrous cage
Ideas meant to placate
When meeting your disaster
Are only for a desperate fool
Destructive thoughts to mislead us
Can come from deep underground
Believing sources unbroken
Will tear the legion apart
Will we be forever free as we unchain our souls
From life forever
You are just a slave to the dust
Another time, where you and me will be freed
With one more last endeavor
You cannot escape your fate now
No
Try me, don't deny me
Please embrace me in your peace
I want to fly into the bright
Would you pleas guide my last goodbye
Why won't you lie with me, my light's ending
On a night when I find, I'll take my final flight
Now come and see divinity where night turns day
So far away from heaven
You will never earn my trust
Provoke the need, give word to deed
And dive into another God-like atmosphere
You will never find you way out
No
Try me, don't deny me
Please embrace me in your peace
I want to fly into the bright
Would you pleas guide my last goodbye
Why won't you lie with me, my light's ending
On a night when I find, I'll take my final flight
I'd rather die
Than breathe in my shame
They'll know my name
All Hell in flames
For our faith
We proudly die
For it we would die
For our sovereign
All Hell will arise
We'll serve our cause
In earning reward
Collision of skies
The ocean wept dry
Every ocean dry
Another's desperation flying through the emptiness
As my degradation throws me out of line
Take the final flight
Into the serenade forever lost in time
Try me, don't deny me
Please embrace me in your peace
I want to fly into the bright
Would you pleas guide my last goodbye
Why won't you lie with me, my light's ending
On a night when I find, I'll take my final flightWaiting for the sun to set my wings ablaze
The show must go on, the funeral needs a star tonight
I have become the gossip and the choir
The useless and the used
The one who reaches for her arms, I am denial
You are the one who fell from grace
For them is there a reason why?
You are the one who fell from grace
For them is there a reason why?
The funeral needs a star
As you walk away for the last time
Could you hear my heart consumed behind you?
As you turn your back from the dying
Did you feel the sun burn out inside you?
You set my wings ablaze
You set my wings ablaze
You set my wings ablaze
You set my wings ablaze
You set my wings ablaze
You set my wings ablaze
You set my wings ablaze
You set my wings ablaze
You set my wings
You will run from familiar arms
Into their embrace
Into their embrace
You will run from familiar arms
Into their embrace
Into their embrace
I hope they love you like I did
When you needed me and I came for you that night
I hope they love you like I did
When you needed me and I came for you that night
I hope they love you like I did
When you needed me and I came for you that night
I hope they love you like I did
When you needed me and I came for you that night
I hope they love you like I did
When you needed me and I came for you that night
I hope they love you like I did
When you needed me and I came for you that nightDestined to follow
Afraid to miss any trends
The TV is your truth
You just watch and absorb
Never in any doubts
About the message it spreads
You're locked in a mental cage
For the rest of your days
Get-A-Life, Get-A-Life
Your mind is polluted
With useless information
For a successful career
But you can't handle emotions
Only poor imitation
True intentions have faded
You're locked in a mental cage
For the rest of your days
Get-A-Life, Get-A-Life
Switch off those presets in your brain
Replace them with life
Just for once think for yourself
And get a life
Is it too hard to handle, to deal with that truth?
Is it too hard to handle, to live without rules?
You're locked in a mental cage
For the rest of your days
Get-A-Life, Get-A-LifeYour conniving words
Are childishly insane
To get what you want
You'll say anything
In your mind
You lust to control me
You lust
For control
[Chorus]
Mold me, fold me
Mold me, fold me
My pain is your pleasure
My agony excites you
Desperate for a change
But change comes within
I'm not staying
Not around you
I'm stronger than you think
Much stronger than you
[Chorus]
Molding and folding
Lusting for control
Longing to control
Those without esteem
Ignorant pawns
Of your pathetic dreams
Dying to control
Those without esteem
Ignorant pawns
Of your pathetic dreams
Molding and folding
Lusting for control
Hatred is a tool
Thoughtlessly you use
Ruin an only friend
With misleading rules
Contain your own rage
Give yourself praise
'Cause you have no shame
With your callous game
[Chorus]Modern day pharisees,
Vultures waiting to consume the weak,
On wings of deceit and malice,
Words laced with the deadliest venom.
Everything was created from your distorted mind,
You are the manipulator of past events,
you have told lies, planned evil,
and used your words for the profit of wicked ways.
Wicked ways!
Liar! Honour and pride?
You don't know the meaning of the words you speak.
Your wretched nature is what makes you,
the filthy bastard you are.
I stand for everything that you despise.
There's nothing holy about hatred.
Too much crap cushions the truth.
Too long a world lived in corruption.
Six lifeless bodies of charlatans.O, ye whose future is in other hands!
Foul feeders! Slipped, are ye on you excrement?
Parasites! Having the world lousy,
Imagine ye are of significance to Heaven
I, who enjoy my body
[I] would rather pack with wolves
Than enter your pest - houses
Sensation... Nutrition... Mastication... Procreation...!
This is your blind - worm cycle
Know ye of nothing further than your own stench?
Heaven is indifferent to your salvation or catastrophe
The sword - trust - not salve - I bring!
Honest was Sodom!
Your theology is a slime - pit of gibberish become ethics
In your world, where ignorance and deceit constitute felicity
Everything ends miserably -
- Besmirched with fratricidal bloodI've travelled for far too long on a quest for peace
In many battles won and lost
Still I've found no release
But now I'm here, at the Edge of Time
A place I've seen only in my dreams at night
A place where Chaos and Law collide at last
I saw the glory of the Bright Empire
I saw the ruin of its mighty towers
Until I've reached this place to face my destiny and sound the
[Chorus]
Horn of Fate, Bringer of the End
I'm the Champion of Doom Eternal
Doomed to herald destruction
Horn of Fate, Bringer of the End
I must serve my destiny
And sound with all my strength, the Horn of Fate
A blinding light like a thousand suns opens up the sky
Defying the barriers of Time and Space, the High Lords arrive
I see the army of the Lords of Light
And I see the hordes of Chaos rise
The Great Balance in the sky will judge the final battle
I set my dragons free
To fly over the armies on the battlefield
Stormbringer give me strength, I'm all alone and
I must sound the...
[Chorus]
Horn of Fate, Bringer of the End
I'm the Champion of Doom Eternal
Doomed to herald destruction
Horn of Fate, Bringer of the End
I must serve my destiny
And sound with all my strength, the Horn of Fate
The final battle rages on
The Kings of Law and The Chaos Lords
Clash with thund'rous roar and scorching amber fire
Hundred of warriors engulfed in flames
by the dragons fire, they're set ablaze
Dragonlord Elric fulfills his destiny and sounds the
[Chorus]
Horn of Fate, Bringer of the End
I'm the Champion of Doom Eternal
Doomed to herald destruction
Horn of Fate, Bringer of the End
I'm the Champion of Doom Eternal
Doomed to herald destruction
Horn of Fate, Bringer of the End
I'm the Champion of Doom Eternal
Doomed to herald destruction
Horn of Fate, Bringer of the End
I must serve my destiny
And sound with all my strength, the Horn of Fate
Horn of Fate
"...So let it be done..."Let it be know that this has gone on for far too long
And we can take no more
Through the years I have come to realize
That the truth is often right before our eyes
We are aware and know the hearts of fellow man
So let us act as such and help our brothers to stand
And now we offer this small bit of wisdom
The heart it came from will set you on your way
Ignorance will crush us, destroy all that we have
So let us rejoice that, the powers in our hands
To shape us and make us keepers of fellow man
So let us rejoice that the power's in our hands
Let us find strength in our neighbors' hands
We are not creatures made to be alone
And when we act as such, we help our brothers to stand
And now we offer this small bit of wisdom
The heart it came from will set you on your way
And now I ask you to take heed of my words
To move with purpose to a future worth living
Ignorance will crush us, destroy all that we have
So let us rejoice that, the powers in our hands
To shape us and make us, keepers of fellow man
So let us rejoice that the power's in our hands
It is time to address the fact that alone
None of us can survive
Ignorance will crush us, destroy all that we have
So let us rejoice that, the power's in our hands
The power's in our handsI learned the lord is my master
though his name I no more chant
I removed my silver crucifix
harken not to the preacher's rant
My only bible has been burned
that was the last time I kneeled
Nothing in church I ever learned
only to my selfish urge I'd yield
I am traitorous
I am treasonous
Sworn allegiance I desert
to sin and lust I convert
My unbelief prevaricates
the abode of hell my soul awaits
So I burn
oh they feed me flames
At the stake I taste the merciless fire
so I burn
Oh but the devil knows
I shall rise renewed from the ashes of my death
I was throbbing in my desire
holy doctrines I no more knew
When i was praying at the altar
the words all seemed too few
Tempted to sell my soul
my mind corrupted with vanity
Obsessed to reach my goal
enticed beyond the gates of insanity
Perverse intent in my mind
high on deceit and what I can blind
Heresy is my guilty creed
in perjury engulfed in greedThrough this old skylight our eyes are open wide
The sky bespangled in the rain
And we feel called upon but interests collide
Not much to lose, a lot to gain
Don't lose your line of sight now
And raise the barricades somehow
It's time to leave the lores so blow them sky high
In sound and fury they will fly
We're sparing no pain, we're launching a dream
It's blazing a trail when the rockets will gleam
We harness the air 'cause we let them fly
The town had turned out under this October sky
There's nothing to it and stick to your last
Shown of all romance their life spans
The charm of novelty or adoring the past
No more among they also runs
It spread like wildfire in a day
"And there'll be crash-land," so they say
Well proven patterns so it must be vertigo
But we will give them quite a show
We're sparing no pain, we're launching a dream
It's blazing a trail when the rockets will gleam
We harness the air 'cause we let them fly
The town had turned out under this October sky
We harness the air and we let them fly
Under this October sky
We're sparing no pain, we're launching a dream
It's blazing a trail when the rockets will gleam
We harness the air 'cause we let them fly
The town had turned out under this October skyWhen the fog of evil buried the whole world
Dark demons created their forces anew
There were only a few able
To resist, the others creep to the gold
Thus they be baited with money and force
Their deepest nightmares awake every night
They resist all temptations of the dark side
The devil wasn't able to flag them alive
HATE AND BLOOD AND CRIME
THAT'S THEIR LAW
AND OUR FUTURE
THE NEW WORLD IS BUILT UPON THEIR LIES
BUT THE HEADLESS FOOLS NEVER SURVIVE
They were branded as heretics with eight
They were hunted, they were sent to their doom
Now the Judas had accomplished
Betrayal is their faith and gold their real godAnd the story ends
Insanity said coldly
Still waiting for the chance
So out of nowhere it will rise
Oh, and another journey starts
By the call of the moon
Was it really me
I saw in the mirror screaming
I swallowed hate and lies
Through a thousand cries
Someone's sucking out my energy
What can I do
On this road to nowhere
Heart of dragon lies
At the edge of time
And the story ends
Insanity said coldly
Still waiting for the chance
So out of nowhere it will rise
Oh, and another journey starts
Into insanity's claws
Come with me and join me
A new life's waiting for you
Jump through the mirror
Leave fear behind
No matter where I tried
The candle light seemed
Lost forever
Before my vision ends
Cathedral
Falling tears
We're not alone
There's someone else, too
From the mirror's other side
Reflecting the cruel part of your soul
It's time for your choice
What can I do
On this road to nowhere
Heart of dragon lies
At the edge of time
And the story ends
Insanity said coldy
Still waiting for the chance
So out of nowhere it will rise
Oh, and another journey starts
By the call of the moon
Heart of dragon lies
What can I do
On this road to nowhere
Heart of dragon lies
At the edge of time
And the story ends
Insanity said coldly
Still waiting for the chance
So out of nowhere it will rise
Oh, and another journey starts
Into insanity's claws
I'm not a king
I'm just a bard
How can I trust
If there's good and bad
The wounds of life
They will remain
At least I found a friendHooks cutting through your flesh
No comparison of pleasure and pain
Black box it's a gory treat
Mutilation from hell
To the gory end
As they make you ride the blade
To the gory end
As your life will now fade
Crave for blood, unnatural greed
Stuck in hell forever more
Ultimate pain, blooded corpse
Living memory known deceased
To the gory end
As they make you ride the blade
To the gory end
As your life will now fade
See the masters of gore
Stricken with pain in hell
Hooks cutting through your flesh
No comparison of pleasure and pain
Black box is a gory treat
Mutilation from hell
To the gory end
As they make you ride the blade
To the gory end
As your life will now fade
Crave for blood, unnatural greed
Stuck in hell forever more
Ultimate pain, blooded corpse
Living memory known deceasedCome a little closer
Come near and you will see
You might find the peace I sense
Out there, almost within reach
With the headlights on
With a pocket full of stones
Waiting for the sun
Hoping for gravity
Fear the wrong, them all or nothing
Is it broken or just old
If you don't know, they surely will
Decide first for, then sell to you
Stand, stare
See, understand
If you wanna walk the line
Then there's no room to step aside
So now come clean
Let the healing begin
So now become one
With the beating within
We are not dead yet
A little closer
Yet about to see
The line dividing earth and sky
Is just a shadow in your head
The taste of insecurity, freedom
In a bottle full of rain
Step outside the ordinary
Enjoy
Living
Learning
So now come clean
Let the healing begin
So now become one
With the beating within
We are not dead yet
Breaking the bone of habit
Disturbing the peace of symmetry
Painting the best case scenario
Treasuring pain
Treasuring painThis whole place has really gone to shit man
A real down hill tune
Everybody owes you candy
You'll glass to chew
Trick or treatin' is a dangerous game man
The children walk in fear
One razor in a poison apple
Could ruin christmas cheer
Lost in outer spacin' out (Now you're bringing me down) x3
It's 3 am
Chorus:
Go on die and see
It makes no difference here
The harsh reality
Just don't let it spoil my halloween
Lost in outer spacin' out (Now you're bringing me down) x3
ChorusYou don't think I know how this ends?*
I've heard these words before and there more meaningless now then they were then.
It feels like I'm drowning and you're oceans away.
It feels like I'm drowning and you dragged me out to sea.
I've got nothing but hate in my heart now watch me tear you apart.
I've got nothing but hate in my heart.
Burn me to ashes, then burn the ashes.
I'll carry this hate till I'm in my grave.
I'll see you in hell where the devil knows my name.
Sorrowspell, my world will never be the same. (2x)
I'll see you in hell where the devil knows my name.
I'll see you in hell.
My head was a house and all you brought in was lies.
Now my world shrinks and these four walls become a cell.
You told me the only way to heaven was to go through hell.
Burn me to ashes, then burn the ashes.
I'll carry this hate till I'm in my grave.
I'll see you in hell where the devil knows my name.
Sorrowspell, my world will never be the same. (2x)
I'll see you in hell where the devil knows my name. (2x)
Won't you close my eyes and let me sleep through this sorrowspell.
I've giving so much and I've fallen so hard, I've got nothing left to tell.
Won't you close my eyes and let me sleep through this sorrowspell.
Won't you close my eyes.[Chorus]
Faustus
The time has come for you
And here's your sentence
That is your fate and
It's no use repentance
You must pay with your soul, Faustus
You have come to your goal, Faustus
You wished the deepest
Knowledge of tomorrow
And power to clean off
Grievance and sorrow
We have made your wish true, Faustus
Now we are over you
Love, your force may get me free
And show me how to flee
From my fate
When my time is over
Love, you help me to understand
That all is in my hand
Just today
Not far away
[Bridge]
Love..., I've fallen in distress and dismay
Because I'm waited
Predestinated
Fated...!
[Chorus]
Mephisto, the intriguer
For your soul, is eager
There's a compact you've consented
With blood your soul have been rendedDrifting from the prison planet
I fell into the 13:th sun
Way beyond all super science known
Surfing through space and mantra
God of time and mercury
Our love will live inside the elephant star
They took me to the titan mother
A dream away from yesterday
Tomorrows world I slip into today
Centuries in firelight
I die with every winter tsar
Our love will live inside the elephant star
Paralysed and hypnotized
The big dog in the sky
Mystified, majestified I fly
I hide behind the silver fallosEurus, we call upon the east wind
Notus, we call upon the south wind
Zephyrus, we call upon the west wind
Boreas, we call the north wind
Spirit mother hear thy pagan son
On winter solstice night
Waxing mon reveals a new dawn
(The) dark king transforms to infant light
The cycle of ancient times has begun
Io'Evohe we are reborn
Candlemass brings the (growing) child sun
The triple goddess comes shining down
As witches sing with inspiration
Spiral dancing round and round
The spring equinox rises high
(The) dark maiden returns to us
The woods abound with faery goblins
Pan performs his songs of lust
Rejoice in the beltane sabbat
When lilac performes this magickal night
Naked we leap the sacred fire
And feast upon fruits and violet wine
On the day of summer solstice
The sun king will embrace the litha queen
And perish in the wake of Lughnasad
So may a splendid harvest be reaped
On Mabon we follow the lord of shadows
The empty season is upon us
Lady autumn blows leaves of sadness
Chanting as our offerings turn to dust
Ancestor wraiths ride on Samhain night
To proclaim the mystery of passing
Wearing a death cloak smiles the waning king
Let us see what the future will bring
Death is rebirth
The end brings new beginning
Ever turning
The wheel of the Pagan cycle
Anadia... Klephera... Nuit... Mercury... Hestia...
Horus... Brigit... Vulcan... Aphrodite...
Ea... Isis... Akasha... Io Evohe![Instrumental]Surrounded by the spoils that piracy has earned
Protect your treasure horde
From those you think would steal
Alone for many years long ago your fat was sealed
Paranoia permeates, imprisoned by your selfish hate
You think you're seeing thieves
Hallucinations drive you mad
Only fighting with yourself,
Because there's no one there
You life's been paved with greed only cared
For gaining wealth
Spite the gods too many times
At the cost of ship and crew
Now an island's your abode,
With the riches of a king
None of it can you ever spend,
Will you repent your wicked ways
Never freedom from this curse
To spend eternity like this
Impossible to break these chains
You only wish that you could die
Die for gold [x3]
You only wish that you could die
Die for gold [x3]
[Solo: Clark]
Your dreams not realized,
Tormented for your deeds
A punishment that fits the sin
Never sail the seas again
Make your bed on a pile of gems,
An empire of lonely rule
Despair turns to insanity
Your skin turns a precious gleam
The sea god's made his point
He cares not for your remorse
You withheld Poseidon's share
Immortal sentence, You can't die
Die for gold [x3]
You only wish that you could die
Die for gold [x3]
You only wish that you could die[Instrumental]Let loose the clockwork dogs. Pathological believers, faithful servants. Reduced to servomechanisms with lock-step discipline and knee-jerk obedience. Reduced to time-reckoners with Newtonian mechanics and a Promethean mandate. Polishing and decorating each ideological cage. Notch by notch, hammer by hammer, escape from freedom. Prognosis: ideologies are habits of thought that defy thought and enable people to avoid thought. Airborne contagions, communicable plagues, towing the weary down river like rudderless wrecks, and we are all sick with them.Evil son, spread your wings of deepest black
Spit on God, may His lies be forgotten
The son of the mourning, a gift to our earth
Christ stands tall no more, so bestow your force upon us
Gaze into the wall of these restless souls
Eternally lost in fear of your Godforsaken son
You have tasted suffering that dove of life has died
Paralyzed and terrorized by the fear you feel inside
Caught within the floods of blood, evil, departed sea
Immortal but now it's like to forever bleed
We saw the truth and it's the draining of the blood o
O your false redeemer
The mourning son has now control, so what if it's evil?I'm fit and working again
Look down the road
In the sun
I [make a pact with forty strong gang]
I'm fit and working again
I've seen fit
We've seen the tail end
I'm fit and working again
I used to hang like chandeliers
My lungs are crusted in blood
But the facts is now cut clear
I'm fit and working, dear
still continue to write this song
I'm fit and working again
I used to think this spot was the domain
Opinion is at most
Stimulus reason
If you've got the most
With true, precise
Analysis is academic
Some thoughts can get nauseous.
Set opposite a freak on a train
Warts on his head and chin
Boy, was I getting so vain
I saw the recession around Victoria Station
I'm fit and working again
Gimme the sun.
I'm fit and working again
And I feel like Alan Minter*
I just ate eight sheets of blotting paper
And I tripped out on the Alka Seltzer
Cause I'm fit and working again...
Don't you know that was the tail end.
[ Alan Minter is a British boxing champion. ed.]Drain this blood from me.
Your curse runs through my veins.
Take this name you gave.
I don't want you branded on me.
Bloodline of guilt.
Your hate.
My solitude is my fate.
Everything I hated in you is now inside of me.
I want to tear you out and this is all you gave to me.
So how can I live with myself cursed in the womb?
I know this was beaten in you.
Your voice of hate runs through my head.
Now all I want is to see you dead.
Drain this blood from me.
Your curse runs through my veins.
Curse of the womb.
I want to see you dead.Spit in your face, another worthless liar
I know your kind
Save me the smile, you're just a cut-throat bastard
I read your mind
Nothing without the victim that you feed on
Everyone knows you're just a parasite
What can you do after you've killed it slowly
Where can you go after you bled it dry
For now I'll let you believe
I let you get to me
Aren't you in for a shock
You stupid motherfucker
You'll get what you deserve
A victim of your own game
You're already dead to me
Your turn to get played
Now I'm cold blooded
I've got ice in my veins
Now I'm cold blooded
Just disengaged
Having control - the only validation
You constantly need
Power to you becomes intoxication
On which you feed
Spewing your lies and your manipulation
Playing with lives to you is just a game
Being around you makes me fear that you might
Get on my skin and then contaminate
For now I'll let you believe
I let you get to me
You don't even see it coming, do you?
You'll get what you deserve
A victim of your own game
You're already dead to me
Your turn to get played
Now I'm cold blooded
I've got ice in my veins
Now I'm cold blooded
Just disengaged
Cold blooded
Ice in my veinsSerpent Eyes Caress An Endless Inner Source
These Moving Walls Untouched In Mortal Glare
Unseen By All This Kingdom Of Change
Shedding The Visions Of A Cold But Burning Sting Of Poison
Watching Eyes Stare As A Dusk Freezes This Horizon Landscape
Warm Filled Life Induced Through A Venomous Filter To End All
A Cold Blood To Inject Into An Unwanted Divinity Of Broken Ways
Overcome By All That Fears Its Sight
This Home To A Heartless Stone Glance

Hail This Lair That Swallows All Disease
And The Darkness Shall Be
Upon My Throne Of Might
And On Ravens Wings I Shall Fly

Unbalanced Movement... Serpentine Skill One By One
This Trap Is Set... These Wars Are To Be Won
Heaven Sounds Its Armies... Gates Fall Open To Failure
A Sheild Of Scales... No Match For War
The Skies A Light With Cherubs Holding Golden Horns Of Praise
Cadence Unsound In Charming The Deaf Underworld From Extinction
Now This Ruin Has Come
The Treacherous King Will RuleDurch die hehre Finsternis
des zukunftig Vergangenen
sehnt das Raunen sich nach Licht
nach einem Weg heraus
zwischen zweierlei Welten
Verstummt ist die gleichgultig' Andacht
und es ward mir,
als wurd' ich ein Unterkleid erblicken
welches aufgeknupft an einen Baum
den Niederen eine Stette der Zuflucht ist
Heraufbeschworen durch die Kraft
einer erloschenden, zweiten Sonne
werden drei Finger meiner linken Hand
erschlafften Samen in die Ungewibheit
blutgetrenkten Schlammes entlassen
Gestern meinte ich es noch genauso
wie es morgen klingt
es war die Beruhrung mit dem Nichts
welche mir den dritten Finger tetowierte
aber als der Lurch sich mir eroffnete
ward ich ein anderer
und schnitt mir den ganzen Arm ab
Ich fange dich mit meniem Todesbringer
und du denkt noch es were der Wahnsinn
doch es ist versprochen:
Ich werde mich weiter toten
Oh Verheibung - Du Krone des Todeskultes!
Wenn schwarze Regentropfen nur dem einen Ziel dienen,
in nechtlicher Unbedeutsamkeit zu verbrennen
Und der an sein eigenes Kreuz genagelte Mensch
den Wunsch verspurt
Dich Tod einem nie dagewesenen Leben vorzuziehen
Dann ist der entweihte Zeitpunkt gekommen
in Deine erlosenden Augen zu blicken
und den eigenen Untergang mit offenen Armen
willkommen zu heiben.
English translate: Promise - Thou Crown Of The Death Cult
Through the exalted darkness
of the future past
the murmuring longs for light
for a way out
between dual worlds
Silenced is the indifferent attention
And it seems to me
as if I would see an undergarment
that, tied up in a tree,
is a sanctuary for the humble ones
Conjured up by the power
of a fading second sun
three fingers of my left hand are
set free weakened seed in the uncertainty
of bloodsoaked mire
Yesterday I meant it just like
it sounds tomorrow
It was contact with the nothingness
that tatooed my third finger
But when the amfibian opened to me
I seemed to be someone else
and cut off my entire arm
I catch you with my bringer of death
and you still think it was insanity
yet it is promised:
I will kill myself furthermore
Oh Promise - Thou Crown Of The Death Cult
When black raindrops serve only the one goal
to burn in nocturnal insignificance
And he who is nailed to his own cross
feels the wish
to prefer You Death over a life that never existed
Then the distant point in time has arrived
to gaze into your redeeming eyes
and to welcome one's own downfall
with open armsCareless days, time slipped away. Careless days, love slipped away.
Careless days, time dreamt away. Careless days, love went away. I hide
crying eyes. Day to day, so scared. Ending words and ending lines, have
never been ended in this careless breath from a time. A time when love
shined through your now dark eyes. Forget all those times. The words that
reached for me, to comfort thoughts. It meant so much. Cherished. Days
die. I never lost the thought, when days never lost me. I'm holding on,
not giving in. Never say, another day. Forget to keep counting those
moments surround you. Wondering, waiting. Forget to keep counting those
minutes surround you. Please don't go. I'll never know. How does this
end? Don't go. Keep running away. Time dies.Bow for him, bow to the supremacy
Bow for him, at last
You do believe, so I can say
That you are owned by me
Bow for him, bow to the supremacy
Bow for him, at last
You do believe, so let us pray
For all those fools that be
Fool, dance with me again
I am your destiny, mark my words
Don't you ever disagree
Fool, kneel for me again
I am your agony, walk my way
I will never set you free
Live for me, a longing fool
Bow to the supremacy
Live for me, you won't regret
Die for the divinity
Bow for me, bow to the supremacy
Bow for me at last
You do believe, so you display
All that we want to see
Fool, dance with me again
I am your destiny, mark my words
Don't you ever disagree
Fool, kneel for me again
I am your agony, walk my way
I will never set you free
Bow for me, just do it
Walk my way, just to serve me
Bow for me, just do it
Kneel for me and obey me
A humble reflection
Before the unrushing descent is he
Not able to turn back, anymore
Bow to me, bow to the supremacy
Kneel for me, down for the divinity
Come to me, bow for me
Just do it now to the supremacy
Kneel for me, down for me
Just do it now for the divinity
Believing is the cure
Religion is like opium
You better think at all
Before you start thinking you
Fool, dance with me again
I am your destiny, mark my words
Don't you ever disagree
Fool, kneel for me again
I am your agony, walk my way
I will never set you free
Fool, dance with me again
I am your destiny, mark my words
Don't you ever disagree
Fool, kneel for me again
I am your agony, walk my way
I will never set you free
Bow for me, just do it
Bow for me, just do it
Bow for me, just do it
Bow for me, just do itVi sÃ¥lde vÃ¥ra hemman och gav oss sedan ut,
Som fÃ¥gelen bortflyger, nÃ¤r sommaren tar slut.
Han kommer en gÃ¥ng Ã¥ter nÃ¤r vÃ¥ren skrider fram,
Men vi fÃ¥r aldrig skÃ¥da vÃ¥rt kÃ¤ra fosterland.
Och nÃ¤r vi sedan kom till den Liverpoolska hamn
Begynte Ã¥ngerns tÃ¥rar sÃ¥ stritt att bryta fram.
Det blev en hjÃ¤rtans sveda i brÃ¶stet pÃ¥ var och en.
Man talar blott om Sverige och om sitt fÃ¶rra hem.
Vi packades tillsammans uti ett osunt kvav.
Det var fÃ¶r oss att skÃ¥da liksom en Ã¶ppen grav.
Och fÃ¶dan som vi fraktat ifrÃ¥n vÃ¥r svenska jord
Den blev oss nu fÃ¶rbjuden att taga med ombord.
Och nÃ¤r vi hade seglat en vecka eller tvÃ¥,
Ett mÃ¶rker dÃ¤cket hÃ¶ljde och bredde sig dÃ¤rpÃ¥.
Ej se varann vi kunde, knappt andas eller gÃ¥.
Det var en gruvlig plÃ¥ga fÃ¶r stora och fÃ¶r smÃ¥.This is the man I was made to be.
These bridges that are so easily broken are rebuilding themselves.
Will you meet me in the middle so I can find myself?
Chorus:
Now you've drawn this imaginary line
cutting me off from you
(So what am I supposed to do?)
So what am I supposed to do?
I would give up everything to reach the heart inside of you
(To reach the heart inside of you)
I can honestly say it was never meant to end,
drawing these black lines;
plotting your jaded meridians.
Was it everything you wanted?
Was it everything you thought it'd be?
I am the one broken, who will piece me together?
(Chorus)You gotta keep those wheels of mine
Rolling and burning down the highway
Last night that girl of mine left me yearning
Best start learning to see things my way
Hit me for the very first time
And we're gonna turn around
I'm leaving her love behind
And getting out of town
I won't back down
I won't turn round
From the last exit to Brooklyn
Last chance to turn around
Last exit to Brooklyn
Gonna keep these old wheels going covering ground
Last night that girl of mine left me trying
And lying she deceived me
[I'll alter] all these tears with the wipers
You'd better believe me
She said she was mine alone
But I know otherwise
I thought she was mine alone
I saw her with a guy
I want her back
It's all in the past
That's why l'm last exit to Brooklyn
Last chance to turn around
Last exit to Brooklyn
Last chance to turn around
She said she was mine alone
Da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da
I saw her with a guy
And that's the reason why
I'll pass the last
The last exit to Brooklyn
The last chance to turn aroundI have an injunction, don't look surprised
Time to get even in this unproved life
Questions all over the years I live
Time for some answers, beware of my drift
So on, be true, denial won't work
And there is nothing you can't do
A feast arises, be glad you're invited
The future has no past, pass the wine
All those worries about all those dreams
All those nights when I screamed
Captured in security, a babbling brook
Let's drop a bomb and act like fools
But a true feast arises when you're done
And you're done when prospects are gone
Cause when you're down in the mud cause
dreams won't come, pleasure is gone
what did you do wrong
And you're trying to gain the fortune
and fame of the ones you admire, don't
try to remain. Security is just a gameA glance to my eyes, deep within reveals
This worn-out warrior's mind
I'm killing you by suffering
Discomposure of a deepest kind
In the night I crave to feel your breath
And your touch like angel of death
In the dawn I'm in chains of bestial rage
And forced to make you dead
The chains get tighter around my throat
I can give you no love, only dead-lift of pain
In the dusk of evening I tuck you up with feather
Forever I'll stand by your side
In the twilight of night I'm laughing
While cutting you hundred and thirteen times
Can't you see I am evil, double-edged razor
Child of eternal hate.
To torment you like a motherfuckin' whore
I'll make you cry forever more
I'd crawl through broken glass to you
And your name is written in my very flesh
With the knife I'm still longing to use
In the night I crave to feel your breath
And your touch like angel of death
In the dawnism in chains of bestial rage
And forced to make you deadMeadows of candles around me
I'm drowning in my dreamsIt has been appointed once for a man to die
But after this the judgement
Once the appointment has been made
Nothing can be done to change it
No need to be afraid of the greetings of death
Will you be wrapped in the chains of torment?
Or pass from life unto death?
The power of death knows not one
But to live you must die
Life is for those who have offered their lives
To live is Christ to die is to gain
Are you afraid to die?
Don't be afraid
Of the greetings of deathWhatever the prophecy
Whatever prosperity
Heaven denied us it's kingdom
Tell me where we've gone wrong
Oh, fortitude, I do like you
But I only speak when spoken to
Heaven forgive, the mess I'm in
Temperance, why do I cast
Your prudence to the wind?
Whatever the prophecy
Let it be, Let it be
We'll live all there is to live
Be it pleasure, be it sorrow
Whatever prosperity
Lies in me, lies in me
I'll be all that i can be
My forever starts tomorrow
I am a nightmare haunting you
I steal away your sleep
A poison running through your veins
A wound, that always bleeds
Call it love, call it lust
Luxuria, my enemy,
you get the best of me
Whatever the prophecy
Let it be, Let it be
We'll live all there is to live
Be it pleasure, be it sorrow
Whatever prosperity
Lies in me, lies in me
I'll be all that i can be
My forever starts tomorrow
Whatever the prophecy
Let it be, Let it be
We'll live all there is to live
Be it pleasure, be it sorrow
Whatever prosperity
Lies in me, lies in me
I'll be all that i can be
My forever starts tomorrow[Music: Schulman]
[Lyrics: Schulman]
Tombstones made of flesh
Out in the stream of blood
Forever to be gone
And the memories flow away
Beyond the gates of silence
I'm torn forever
Suffering - bleeding wounds
Deformed being
Silent decay
Let me sleep forever
Let me vanish in peace
Save me from this hell
To the eternity in my dreams
Amorphous pile of skulls
Human life condamned
A crucifix of sacred bones
Final peace evokated
Take me far away
My soul wants to rest
"I am blinded by the grief
Let me be dead, forever"
Evil absorption of hopes
Creeping smell of rottingness
The deceased sinners in catacombs
Funeral for the screaming mortals
The path through illusions
Sacrificed souls dissever
Tombstones made of flesh
A graveyard of mangled limbs
Out in the stream of blood
My life will be vanished
Dissolved piece by piece
Under the freezing moonStill alive, all knowing eye
Beneath your stream of words
Your rapid stream of words
Though none will ever live to share
The radiant streato, the promised hues
From which your picture fell
Re-seal the components from atom hearts
Revert, non owner of worlds
As un-communication becomes the manifest
Our alien, architectural skeletons
In unison collapse
Death rode these silent caravans
And steered them to the rim of the world
Their diaries and withered letters
All devoted to the art of lying
The enterprise, academy
The crafts held in our hands
All devoted to the art of dying
No room to arrange
The final row of masks
Drenched in chameleon ink
For the grand charade
The tongues that burn in you
The slowly altered language
That colonized your heartland
Advanced through broken doors
And they still believe you
They seem to see
So many things
Hooked in your pestilent eye
Your stale lids, your iris punctured
By tongues licking a lie
The enterprise, Wolvenlore
The cursed seed of man
Plunged through the tunnels of un-creation
We reach out to move the landmark
Hands seeping down from the chronicles of time
The quill now blunt, the scribe devouredThe frost tries to reach us,
with its cruel cold hands
the cold witheness hurts our eyes
and we still march with wind in the face.
We follow the trace of blood in the snow
Yesterday we burnt two villages
We killed women and children
Heads out of the bodies of priests
We impaled on our wooden socle(?)...
The blood of hideous monk
is still getting blacker on my axe
Their temple burnt.
And we fed a fire with their corpses
My brothers are marching silently
The great frost turns the hearts to ice
The warm blood will bring the life back
to their bodies...
Another christian village is near...
those who escaped showed us the way...
by the blood from their wounds...
we must deal them a deathblow
before wolves get them
On the horizon behind us
The black smoke appears on the sky
On the hills, full of trees
Wolves observe us
They'll leave the hills and follow us
as soon as the day is over...My question is simple: with me or versus me
My body's with me - my soul is my enemy
We dance together on the last night
As evil and good collide in my mind
Closed in a circle like blood in vein
I can't runaway and it makes me insane
Pain in my lying sins
Fear in my true belief
There's a forever storm inside
Let me go or my soul tears apart
I'm divided into wrong and right
I hate this fight I lose my mind
I'm only a tool (of life)
In the hand of destiny
I personify (its plans)
He'll kill me as he'll be ready
I play - you dance
You play - I dance
He plays - we all dance
You can't get - I can't get
We can't get out of control
On the last page in the book of life
I dance with you whose face is mine
Dead souls invite us for guests
On their faces there is blood and rest
Closed in a circle like blood in vein
I can't runaway and it makes me insane
Inside me thousands of demons
They don't let me rest in peace
I'm divided into wrong and right
I hate this fight I lose my mind
Drag me left and right, they mangle me
Please set me free, they're killing meNo lyricsFrom the four winds of the night

Journey with soul
Garden of the GodsYour feminine fingers are like daggers. Tearing me apart, with each caressing stroke. My scars unravel cruel history. Our love was stab wounds and lusty kisses. In your eyes I see wasted tears for wasted years, and heartache, heartfelt for granted. You left me with nothing but the desire to overcome. This gaping wound from where you stole my vital organ. But keep it with you, a trophy for yourself. Still you linger for another gaze. Die away from me. I won't stand by while you plague the air with your lies and deception. My shirt stained crimson, from long nights of anguish. These scars are forever, but this won't be eternity. You wash away guilt in the oceans of my tears. I will drown you.As a desolated subway
As an empty city street
It takes me a way
Towards oceans of concrete
A grey walk into the void
Through faceless humans
Nauseating melancholy
Suburban distress
Lifeless as your jaded eyes...
Pitch black misery
Dead leaves in rainy afternoons
Cold - Cold sidewalks at night
Frozen by bleak neon lights
Lifeless asy our jaded eyes
Our sight is broken by a train
This time I know it will be at last one
A reflection of the subway
inside your eyes
Waiting for the last train
of this endless night
Lifeless as your jaded eyes...
To fade into the dark
To run away towards another
Grey - Another greay suicidal day
Subway Apathy crawls in me
Subway Apathy crawls in me
Blackness
Pale grey walls
Dark landscapes of iron
Deep inside my soulI take you to the playground near the station
we'll burn down the WatchTower house
and get drunk in the pub near the highway
I'd like to drive on now
wings but no body
a yesterday curse has a hold on me
an ever present herd has a hold on me
I will be happy, as happy as can be
wings but no body
wings but no bodyQuaestio nostra est aeterna
Ultima requies fons vitae
Sed eam ut novam ducemus
We will never know all possibilities to predict what is to come
And so we have illusions to think freely
Once we had been
Rich from within
Did not try to reach
What we couldn't achieve
Because once we had been
Able to win
From the need to succeed
We need to be innocent to live the life we've lived for so long
We need to be blind enough to live the life we live right now
Who possesses your time also possesses your mind
Once we had been
Rich from within
Did not try to reach
What we couldn't achieve
Because once we had been
Able to win
From the need to succeed
We need to be innocent to live the life we've lived for so long
We need to be deaf enough to live the life we live right now
Reach out, touch infinity
Life is just a memory
Time is not the entity
Like it used to be
The Divine Conspiracy
Opens up the reality
Time is not the entity
Like it claims to be
Once we had been
Rich from within
Did not try to reach
What we couldn't achieve
Because once we had been
Able to win
From the need to succeed
We need to be innocent to live the life we've lived for so long
We need to be insensitive to live the life and so ignore it all
Who possesses your time also possesses your mind
Who possesses your time
-Mislead us all, we are not in control
Also possesses your mind
-There is no trace that will lead to this place
Reach out, touch infinity
Life is just a memory
Time is not the entity
Like it used to be
The Divine Conspiracy
Opens up the reality
Time is not the entity
Like it claims to be
Desperately we all
Clutch at the last straw
We stumble and fall
Countdown to die
To heal it all
We will never reach
Our capacities, no more
We cannot expand
Our boundaries
Once we had been
Rich from within
Did not try to reach
What we couldn't achieve
Because once we had been
Able to win
From the need to succeed
We need to be innocent to live the life we've lived for so long
We need to be insensitive to breathe so we can take it all for granted
Reach out, touch infinity
Life is just a memory
Time is not the entity
Like it used to be
The Divine Conspiracy
Opens up the reality
Time is not the entity
Like it claims to beGo!!
This ain't a test, fuck the rest
Time to set the record straight
Talk your shit, behind my back
Let's hear you say it to my face
I've heard the words fall out your lips
You little trendy fucking bitch
The time has come to get you some
Cause I just do not give a shit
Do you take me for a fool?
How's it feel to be a tool?
See to me your just a cancer
Motherfucker war is the answer
As of now the end begins
I want to laugh but there's no joke
To eat with beasts
And run with the wolves
On the ashes you must choke
I know it's got to chap your ass
To think I just won't go away
Effects me not, I'm writing you off
I've got nothing more to say
Do you take me for a fool?
How's it feel to be a tool?
See to me your just a cancer
Motherfucker war is the answer
Get some
You want to disrespect me
you little fucking punk?
Everything I've done
To be who I am
As far as I've fucking come
I'll slap you so fucking hard
It'll feel like you kissed a freight train
Fuck you
Do you take me for a fool?
How's it feel to be a tool?
Talk your shit behind my back
See to me your just a cancer
The time has come to get you some
Motherfucker war is the answerAgain I offer you my life
Lay down my heart at your feet
But if you accept this offering
Some obligations will have to be fulfilled
Remember to worship no other deity
Leave your earth's steady ground
Pledge allegiance to my gravity
To Mother Venus be forever bound
Three legged amphibian with coin in mouth
Save me from this wicked dream
Any kind of magic or miracle
I welcome to redeem my being
You must promise not to invoke the rain
Through my walls detect just inaudible storms
Even before they are gathering
Her thoughts have been heard in my words
Now, the ivory goddess
Is sitting small on my table
Offering me this heart of clay
It took too long time to decipher their message
Soft heart was trampled in the mud
Storm crushed the ark
Only wreckage to hold on to in the floor
Three legged amphibian with coin in mouth
Any kind of magic or miracle
Any kind of magic or miracleShine for me, misery
Devils rapture their coils
Suffer the fathomless end
Until we parche, with sermons, again
Strangle me slowly
Enter my palace of pain
Cover your screams
'Cause the wind will carry all your words away
Pass me the bottle
Pass me the venomous wine
Pass me this deadly brew
And I will drink and die, again
Shine for me lust and thorns
Compromise carven in suns
Hatred of my own feet
I will never be able to walk this ground, again
The rain has waited too long, too long
Pass me the bottle and
I will drink and die, again
Shine for me, Misery!!!"We can't take prisoners, you know that."
Submissive ? deviants
Rejecting all their casualties
Atrocities of mankind
Executed to extinction
If you analyze that ship of fools,
In the end you'll always lose
Your mental games are getting weak
They grow infected as you speak.
Burning skin that is not so real
Animate a conscious ideal
Dissolves into submission
Push the will of no recognition
Your face it cracks
You, you ? on ?
The fossil shines
Shines right through
Take, take, take down the enemy.
If you analyze that ship of fools,
In the end you'll always lose
Your mental games are getting weak
They grow infected as you speak.
? in the anarchy
You try to please the ?
Your shattered with self remorse
For better days or for worse.
"If he'd kept on beating on and holding him down it'd be a different story"
Burning skin that is not so real
Animate a conscious ideal
Dissolves into submission
Push the will of no recognition
No recognition
Take down,
Take down the enemy.
Burning skin that is not so real
Animate a conscious ideal
Dissolves into submission

Formado por acordes mgicos
Notas d soledad, un silencio
Dentro d un mismo comps
Como deciros que es lo que siento
Si ese sonido llega a mi corazn
Se van mis sentimientos
Hacia un mundo de ilusin
OhOh Espero encontrarte all
OhOh! Me hars feliz
Una vez ms se tuerce mi vida
No veo caminos por donde salir
A punto ya de ahogarme
En ella me refugiare
Cuando te veo alzando los brazos
Mi alma se fortalece otra vez
Esperas que lo d todo
Y no te defraudar
OhOh! Espero encontrarte all
OhOh! Me hars feliz
T eres la sangre
Que corre por mis venas
Sin ti yo no puedo vivir
Eres mis pensamientos
Los malos y los buenos
Y es que formas parte d m

[solo Antonio][Music: Schulman]
[Lyrics: Schulman]
Slowly I'm watching her die
A fixed look in her eyes
You bleed as I see
Her soul fade with fear
She shall suffer - I will slain
This is my obligation - only
Bleeding slices remains
A torrent of blood
Goagulate on my hands
Slowly the innards decay
Festering flesh beneath my nails
A sick subhuman reality
I slice her infected corpse
Grinding and carving the flesh
Are my hands doing this crime
Or is it just dreams in my
Satanic mind
In the name of the holy god
I tear the heart out
Hacking her bleeding organs
And cover my body with pieces
Turn her body inside out
Compeled to die
The spirit dwell in a sanctum
Forsaken with lies
You have finaly found your peace
Beyond the gates of silence
You will never ever lie again
As you sleep in the land of ice
You have finaly...
Forever laid to rest
Ashes to ashes - dust to flesh
My obscene dreams came true
Only bleeding slices remains
A torrent of blood
Goagulate on my hands
Slowly the innards decay
Festering flesh beneath my nails
A sick subhuman reality
I slice her infected corpse
Grinding and carving the flesh
Are my hands doing this crime
Or is it just dreams in my
Sardonic mindWalls are painted as a brightness surrounding the tired and desperate eyes of that figure standing on the edge.
Can it pull its weight when it takes that step and spreads its lovely arms to free-fall without fear?
Shots in my direction dance with my life, danger in consequence makes me alive.
Won't you take back the blood on the dirt, and place the breathing back in its source.
The ambience of this moment makes our tears run so cold.
Why must you be the one to take the pain
my best friend, look at you now.
They gave you a carved name reflecting back to their wet eyes.
So just let go of regret.
Your wings are linked to fly, but they may never take flight when you hold onto your regret.
So just let go.
In this pathetic struggle, this is what I say:
We give our greatest efforts to strengthen our only surviving chances.[Music: Z. Nilsson / Lyrics T. Dahlstrm]
I laugh at you bible whores
Slave bastards you are
Living a lie under god
I laugh at your Jesus Christ
Open your eyes
He looks so pathetic weak nailed to his cross
Like zombies you enter the church
One after one in a line
To receive what the priest has in mind
Feeding a story of lies
I laugh at you holy priest
With your church you will die
Fire devour your home
I will laugh when I see you dead
Flames melting your skin
Smell of Victory
Like zombies you enter the church
One after one in a line
To receive what the priest has in mind
Feeding a story of lies
Priest howling in church about
Something they think they know so
Much about bible whores
Satisfied people they exit the church
Living a lie under god
God and his bible will mess up your
Head like a priest you will suck
Jesus cock
Live under Satan and live as you want
Or forever live as bible whores
I laugh when I see you pray
How silly you look
The candles you light I blow out
I laugh when I hear you sing
Those songs for your god
No one will ever save you
Like zombies you enter the church
One after one in a line
To receive what the priest has in mind
Feeding a story of lies
Priest howling in church about
Something they think they know so
Much about bible whores
Satisfied people they exit the church
Living a lie under god
God and his bible will mess up your
Head like a priest you will suck
Jesus cock
Live under Satan and live as you want
Or forever live as bible whores
God's bible whores
I laugh at them all
Too blind to see... Reality
I laugh at you bible whores
Slave bastards you are
Living a lie under god
I laugh at your Jesus Christ
Open your eyes
He looks so pathetic weak nailed to his cross
Like zombies you enter the church
One after one in a line
To receive what the priest has in mind
Feeding a story of lies
Priest howling in church about
Something they think they know so
Much about bible whores
Satisfied people they exit the church
Living a lie under god
God and his bible will mess up your
Head like a priest you will suck
Jesus cock
Live under Satan and live as you want
Or forever live as bible whores
God's bible whores
Five dollar whores
Too blind to see... RealityOn the way led by the steps
And on the dead sea
You can find the way but not until...
You make blind, hate destroys
Tears leaf from bleeding tree
Maybe the tree of life
Maybe of me
Don't need you, don't want you
Don't need a saviour
I hate you,
I trusted you
I lost the wind
Through your hair my fingers bleed
Like a tear and a sunset in the woods
It's a shame to wish to feel
But not until...
Now I see the thorn of the dead flower
In your eyes, in your eyes
Like a sea that runs
Into the Abyss, oblivion
I see the past of humans black
I stand all night and I pretend
To know the way to the cathedral
Touch inside, touch with me, deep inside
I need to know... To know the world
Oh God! i'll take the light from me
Come with me follow me
Follow me to see the truth
Among the clouds, follow me
Or I will prove your existence
Follow me, follow me
Or I will prove that you are dead
Among the clouds, among the clouds
Sadness lives after we die
Like a star in my mother's...Fear
Fear is the mind killer, fear will infest
Gratify the nihilist, begin brain arrest
Nervebomb, emaciated nervous tract
Nervebomb, to this torture I react
Panic inside, cracking skull
Abrasive aggravate
Forcing through the mental path
Mind exacerbate
Multiplying psychosis
Terrifying rate
Nervebomb, emaciated nervous tract
Nervebomb, to this torture I react
Alienation neuropathy
Terminal chaos killing apathy
Neurons converge all as one
Detonation of nervebomb
Fit to burst the pressure mounts
Culmination brain
Overloading neural points
Crucifying pain
Nervebomb, emaciated nervous tract
Nervebomb, to this torture I react
Alienation neuropathy
Terminal chaos killing apathy
Neurons converge all as one
Detonation of nervebomb
Neurons conveying impulses
Sensory operate
A morbid thirst they rupture forth
Violence separates
Extreme emotion, suicide
Counting down the ticking time
Repent my florid state
My mental high
Nerve distortion, a massive scale
Mental holocaust
Explosive thoughtless terrorist
Insanity enforced
Storm that raged the human soul
Won over flesh and bone
Trapped forever, caged within
Mental post war fall out zone
NervebombEverything around me shrinks and expands
Memories compacted
Fantasies extracted
Suspend me from the floor and push the ceiling nearer
This is just a reenactment of the thoughts projected from your eyes
The faces and names are not real
Only the tears, blood and glass are authentic
We link hands and dreams to become the map of the damned
Found a wound across my ribs, soft and fresh as a ballet shoe, to finger and feed
Memories flaccid
Fantasies reenacted
Finger and feed
Finger and feedRotten trees with twisted boughs
Cast their shadows upon the ground
Where dead birds feathers and autumn leaves
Lie scattered by the midnight breeze
In this garden of endless night
Unseen by living, untouched by light
In this garden by time forgotten
Shadows prosper by death begotten
In the fog with a reek of a thousand graves
Faceless figures move grotesque and deranged
A dance macabre through this cursed domain
To a gruesome chant of sighs and wails
In this limbo beyond all dreams
Next to hell lies this sepulchral scene
Where spectres grieve their death eternal
A gloomy purgatory, dark, internalWe built our towers in sand
and now they collapse around us,
as we fall into the cracks.
Nothing shall remain as it once was.
Hold on to these falling pillars and resurrect a passion,
when silence sleeps to the beat of fists.
Bury your head in the sand, and throw you heart to the sea
for your children have no place to grow their bones.
Birds are weak as their necks grow thin,
trees no longer stand.
And like the soil, we too are made of grain.
Like the death of young, it is finality.
Assemble the masses at the cliffs,
and we shall cast ourselves to the seas.
Rain strips the skin from our bones.
We fall into the cracks of the earth..We hear you, we don't care
We hear you, we don't care
We hear you, we don't care
You sit and soak in your beliefs
You cling to ice and think
You'll float away to your demise
And won't regret a thing
Allow me to shatter your fantasy
Your childhood dream
I'll crush your reality
The gabled roofs make it easy
I know you aren't kidding
I can't help but find it fitting
We're the ones who hear your prayers
We won't answer, we don't care
So, let your demons in
This is where your life begins
I'm selfish and responsible. I want the credit and I'll take the blame. Earth created man, man created God - I'm not passive enough to allow some invention to take it all.
I'm part of a macrocosm
That is the living Earth
And like a body or cell
It is my will to keep the Earth in health
We're the ones who hear your prayers
We won't answer, we don't care
So, let your demons in
This is how your life begins
How are you so gullible?
So easily swayed?
I just want to shake you
Break through your daze
Our brains aren't sophisticated enough to understand the complexity and wonder of Nature. God is a man-made invention to allocate power and responsibility to a tacitile body.
We're the ones who hear your prayers
We won't answer, we don't care
So, let your demons in
This is when your life begins
Believers prefer to be right than correct
In an environment for change, turn left
Sight through mind is imagination
Hallucination mimics perception
Bridge the chasm between blindness and sight
The machinery of the brain generates the theater of the Mind
We hear you, we don't care
We hear you, we just don't careFlesh Consumption!!!

I can't explain, you won't understand
The dream is gone, the falling deep
Under the spell, spoken in tongues
In the colors... of Hell.
In the ringing that chimes inside me
So drag me down, deeper still
Far beyond the black horizon, beyond the things you know!
Poison, the poison, the poison
Poison, the poison, the poison demon!
I am lost again, everything's gone
And more alone than I ever have been
Out of my mind and down on my knees
I'm losing more than I'll ever get
And even if you want to, you can't ever help me
Nor can I ever hope to reach you
But I love to fall... Need the rush
So don't pray for my soul 'cause I'm already damned!
Poison, the poison, the poison
Poison, the poison, the poison devil!
I am down again, everything lost
And more gone than I ever have been
I'm not here to stay, not made to last
Total destruction is the way for me!
And when I kill, I kill!
When I kill, I really kill!
Yeah, when I kill, I kill!
So I take the poison even though I know that it kills!
Treachery... I will betray you all
With a poisoned kiss, filled with deceit
Smiling turning my back
And leaving you all behind
In chaos, and drunk in desperation
Trying to escape this meaningless life
A child of death, playing with fire
So sing for my soul 'cause I cannot be saved!
Poison, the poison, the poison
Poison, the poison, the poison god!Desensitized by the values of life
Maligned and despaired by government lies
Revenge is so strong
I taste it on my tongue
My gun will be
Your angel of mercy
Dislocated by the eyes of disdain
Abused beyond recognition
I can't hope with
The madness abounding
Blasts in my head
Of gunfire resounding
Firing relentless
Killing the senses
I've got no more goddamn regrets
I've got no more goddamn respect
I am the thorn
In your eye
I am the thorn
In your eye
I am the thorn
In your eye
I am the thorn
In your eye
Revenge is so strong
I taste it on my tongue
My gun will be
Your angel of mercy
I've got no more goddamn regrets
I've got no more goddamn respectMorbosa atraccion, Al hedor de la putrefaccion
Placer clandestino, sucumbiendo a la tentacion
Hijos de la miseria, esclavizados por su debilidad
Una raza maldita encadenada a la oscuridad
Ausencia de dios, decadencia y perversion
Reino del hombre, hostilidad y autodestruccion
Viviendo en su perpetua enfermedad
Una raza desviada victima de su propia maldad
Odio encarnado, poder, traicion y ambicion
Ser aprisionado su soberbia es su perdicion
Hijos de la miseria negacion de la misma verdad
Una raza muerta, inhumana pseudodeidadKill. Kill them all. Pigs written in blood on the walls.
Your not entitle to accuse and judge one single man
If you allow all shit that's happening in this damned
Rotten land. The pressure your damned system,
Religion and school puts on our minds creates an all
Collective pain that no damn walls can keep inside.
Do you really think that all evil and madness rests in me.
Do you think you're safe locking me up
And then throwing away the key.
Can't you see I'm out, man. Can't you see I'm free.
Can't you see I'm out, man. Can't you see I'm just
A product of a broken nation's shattered dream.
Death. Death to all. Pigs screaming, The blood runs
Down the walls. You'll never be successful trying to
Keep the madness behind these walls because the pain
Comes from inside and creates chaos within all.
You can put me in the chair and watch me f*cking fry.
But I am aware my death's a nation's alibi.
Can't you see I'm out, man. Can't you see I'm free.
Can't you see I'm out, man. Can't you see I'm just
A product of a broken nation's shattered dream.
Kill. Kill them all. Pigs written in blood on the walls.
Your not entitle to accuse and judge one single man
If you allow all shit that's happening in this damned
Rotten land. The pressure your damned system,
Religion and school puts on our minds creates an all
Collective pain that no damn walls can keep inside.
Do you really think that all evil and madness rests in me.
Do you think you're safe locking me up
And then throwing away the key.
Can't you see I'm out, man. Can't you see I'm free.
Can't you see I'm out, man. Can't you see I'm just
A product of a broken nation's shattered dream.[music: Webster, O'Brien]I've seen strange signs on my way
Silent shadows
Dancing shapes
And angels fallen on the earth
Face up
And look here
When the root of thy cannot reach
Art thou Nephilim child
Are ye looking for thy Elysium
Here among the living trees
Among the fading stars
Varibility ov forms
Sometimes love
Sometimes sadness ov things
Sometimes rapture and wine o sabbath
Sometimes hatred, divine rage
And 93 rears, no limit
Beyond the sin-gilgolem
Ye taught me the secret words:
IOA SABAO
Protect thy Daimon
Why, why whisper thoughts
But might is raised
When conjurer of seasons
Hums the song, sorrowful, joyful
Night is eternal
And day is eternal
With runes ov life
And runes ov death
As above, so below
Now it's time ov the beastBorn and raised under daddy's protective wings,
Sheltered from all the ugly things in life
But didn't daddy tell you,
There are places where you don't belong,
Executive seats,
In charge of my life,
Music industry
And if he did,
Why didn't you listen?
So you could have spared us
the unpleasant experience
of ever meeting you.
Promises broken,
Money never seen
Your pockets never deep enough,
Always crying for more
Cause you're, lying, stealing, cheating
Your not on top of the world
How could we ever fall for your shit,
I guess you shouldn't believe,
What you just can't see
If I had a penny for every lie
I would gladly pay just to watch you die
Top of the world
Lying, Stealing, Cheating, Fucking us over
If I had a penny for every lie
I would gladly pay just to watch you die
I want to watch you die!
Top of the worldKrsivan rukous
Tuskissasi jaloissani rymit
Armoa anoen
Vuodattaen verta tuhansista haavoistasi
jotka suolalla ja myrkyll kyllstin
Ei ole armoa
Ei anteeksiantamusta
kun kasvojasi ilkkuen potkaisen
Kuka nyt on Herra
ja ket on korkeuksiin katsottavan?
Kenen varassa on elm ja kuolema,
kenen vihaa on nyt peljtvn
Kurjuutesi on onneni!
Heikkoutesi on vahvuuteni!
Mahdin alla taipuu kovinkin ters
Pelossa katoaa syvinkin viisaus
Viimeinen isku
Raastaa sinusta elon rippeet
Ruumiisi hpisen

Kerran taivaan valon ruhtinas

Kun jlleen yhn palaan

Hearts full of grief
Blessed are the feeble
Who deny their own belief
I am stranded
Forgotten and forlorn
A hangman buried by his fear
See the scarecrows laughing
By jesters mesmerized
Staring at me with cruel lies(eyes)
So bleed for me
To set me free... right now...
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done... forever...
Will you darken my bride (bright) sun?
Will you swallow your lost son?
Blessed are the fallen
Hearts full of grief
Blessed are the feeble
Who deny their own belief
So nail me to cross
Then break the seventh seal
Paradise regained by guilt
'Cause the child has grown up now
And innocence is gone
Forgiveness is not running through your vain (vein)[instrumental]Brothers fighting everyday
Which bullet is marked for them
Your eternal sacrifice
The truest and the most noble
Fire - that stops the heart
Fire - that stops the heart
Sometimes it's too easy to forget
Those who are pulled away from their families
Sometimes it's too easy to forget
Those who will never see their families again
Unite
Fight for what's right
You are the definition of a hero
Unite
Fight for what's right
You are the definition of a hero
Who can swim throuhg all the bullshit
Political propaganda
Trying to understand half truths
Politicians are spreading thick
Liars - tell half truths
Liars - tell half truths
Tell me
Wouldn't you give up your life
If it meant freedom
Throughout this world
Tell me
Wouldn't you give up your life
If it meant fredom
Isn't that worth fighting for
I will always stand behind
Our brothers, our sisters, our soldiersI don't believe in fame, I believe in music.
I don't believe in money, I believe in the power of love.
I know I got a brain and I know how to use it.
I don't want no one to stick his finger in my pie.
You think you put your best foot forward
But it is moved by someone else.
In blind belief you follow every path that says:
I lead you to a universe of fortune, fame and luck.
Do you really want to be - rich and famous, rich and famous.
Do you really want to be - rich and famous now.
I don't believe in Rock 'n' Roll illusions.
I don't believe that what they say must always be the truth.
I don't believe in good guys against bad guys.
I just might as well say I believe in Santa Claus.
Mr. Big shot wat is your game
Mr. Big shot what is your final aim.
Now you wonder who is to blame.
Mr. Big shot what is your final aim in life.
Rich and famous, house with two hours, big jacuzzi, car with TV.
Private airplane, furs and diamonds, seafood cocktails-
CRAP AND BULLSHIT!It's midnight!!!
The sharpened clock, it tells the time, and yes,
It all stands still
The missing link, a thousand worlds,
What does this all reveal?
A given time, another plane, a place for all escape
As every night, without the light, I am possessed with hate
Unlock the haunted room and gaze into dreams
Alone with the dead, rebirth is near
A zombie stare comes over me, begin my rushing pulse
The dark invades my open mind, which leads me to convulse
My tortured soul, my every thought detached away from me
My quest to kill has been fulfilled, for death's my only need
Unlock the haunted room and gaze into dreams
Alone with the dead, rebirth of an ongoing fear
It's now the time to begin your fate, when darkness falls,
You will obey
The gift of evil has come to thee,
And as my servant chant with me.....
"It's midnight, a time of killing ghouls, an hour of bloodshed,
A world where evil rules"
Yes, midnight, the time for all death to rise, at midnight
I feel the urge to kill!!!
I call death's tune and create doom,
my heart is black, unpure
My soul flies free, as insanity has now been reborn
Through evil's door
I lunge at the corpse, I tear out the throat,
To drink the blood of death
To all mankind, I wish the Earth, a cemetery mess,
A nightmare of death, to never rest
The sharpened clock, it tells the time, and yes,
It all stands still
The missing link, a thousand worlds, what does this all reveal?
My tortured soul, my every thought detached away from me
And once again, as my slave, you must now repeat
"It's midnight, a time for killing ghouls, an hour of bloodshed
A world where evil rules"
As the clock strikes the hour, it's midnight foreverBody
Body
Touched by the toil and plunged into his arm
Cursed through the night through eyes of alarm
A melody black flowed out of my breath
Searching for death, but bodies need rest
Body
Under the soil now waiting for worms
All that I feared is all that I've learned
All that I know is all that I think
Dead feelings are cool, down lower I sink, ah-hah
Bodies need rest, we all need our rest
Sleep an easy sleep -rest -rest
Bodies need their rest
We all need our rest
Sleep an easy sleep-rest -rest -rest -rest
But come back in the morning
Come back hard
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Bodies
Clutching and biting my soul has caught on fire
My evil is now and I'm caught up in desire
Everything I'm living for is all that I am
Liking it and loving it that's all in the planCloying blackness, within the womb, unwanted child's fleshly tomb.
Umbilicus, a weaved choke, hung in time, frail neck is broke.
Aborted form's placenta shroud, writhe in untold fear.
Suffer not this child to live, awash in bitter tears.
Eternally they're cast in a sea of feculence.
Sound the flatline knell, bloodied noose, a cold embrace.
Salted out of life's chance, lost souls disarrayed.
What never was, can never be, grotesques we betrayed.
Mortal remains. Now just burning embers.
It cuts both ways, for all those dismembered.
Carbonized by fire, burning flames of hate.
Guilty in a blinkered court, destruction, child's play.
Beaten derewcts on the brink of death, there's no requiem.
Nothingness is what remains, no chance to live again.Lend me your gun, I've got someone to kiss
I'm still nervous when I walk down the street,
Fresh wounds, old wounds, every one knows
Don't scream on me here we go !! . . .
I sell old block, I fly straight
Got no time to rot, I've got new carburetor
I'm leavin' this suckers valley
And they are peevish like the deepest asshole !
My blood is hot, hot as hell
My leash was bitten through, no time to lose
Leavin' the ghetto, I'm not lookin' back
I'm not willing to suppurate !
Oh, kiss my ass, I'm on my way now,
But I stop at every alehouse
I feel the force, I've got the power
Gonna make it show like rapid fire.
I am a shark, I'm the leader of the pack
Every one looks at my crocodile shoes
And no one knows what's in my head
No one know's, if I'm good or bad !!
I'm back
You'll see your own dead body
I'm back
I'm angry and bloody !!
You cannot stop me, man.Legions mass upon this place
For another night of violent abuse
Maniacs in leather and black
Ready and willing for the attack
Metal mayhem running free
Now all around is breaking loose
Fists are flying pulses race
The circle will destroy this place
Feel adrenaline rush
Jump into the pit
Kicking as you push
Braced for the hit
Bow down to the thrasher
Blood on the stage, a thousand rage
A thrasher's soul on fire
Chaos spreads across the floor
Bang your head, make it sore
Metal madness engulfs the stage
In the pit you come of age
Let battle commence, no space for the weak
The thrasher's dreams are now complete
Feel adrenaline rush
Jump into the pit
Kicking as you push
Braced for the hit
Bow down to the thrasherFor blood! For blood! For blood!
The legions file in
And the crowd, the crowd it roars
As the lion, the lion stalks
And Christians are thrown into the pit
And the frenzied minions chant for it
For blood! For blood! For blood!
We must have blood
They're dragged in chains
From dungeons
Screaming for mercy
Pleading to be freed
Disciplined with whips
Aggression
They're dragged to the pit
Still begging to be spared
And the crowd, the crowd it roars
As the lion, the lion strikes
Ripping Christians limb from limb
And the crowds are screaming
With murderous intent
For blood! For blood For blood!
We must have blood
They're dragged by their hair
Screaming in despair
The crowds are chanting loud
To the lions with this filth
They watch, as they are mauled
Believers strewn from side to side
A feast of death, of blood and gore
They're praying to the gods
Let there be morea circle - dwell as part
the cycle - dwell as part
to flourish - live within
to nourish - live within
so harvest the fallen
return what is given
carry forth the knowledge
be guided by the wise
why can't you see why can't you see
why can't you see why can't you say
bury the blessings had
drift back through ages past
to revere the walkers
but their mark we erase
cast shadows on the land
the oceans will return
from oceans be reborn
the fallen will return
why can't you see why can't you see
why can't you see why can't you say[Instrumental][BRUJO] Mi verga machetÃ³n estÃ¡ duro, te lo meto

you can't understand. Doing stuff that someone says.
It seems you cannot stop. Can't get enough. Mislead,
false belief. Not understanding your own grief.
Compromise, you've only seen true lies. A controlled
existence within the mind. Corrupting morality of the
heartless torn apart, the will is weak only the strong
survive. All is wrong, can't comprehend. Don't know
what is real. Bodies are numb they cannot feel.
Manipulation of a population is so unreal, so unreal.
Mortal hell. Your feeling anxiety. Confusion. Emotions
of a madman nervous breakdown. Shreds of insanity.
What I've done I was compelled to do. Echoes of cries.
The screaming will soon be dead. Speaker of lies,
bringer of true darkness. The forever people shall
drink of bitter waters. Swarming like locust from
darkened skies Plaguing civilization. Burning whispers
of the four winds. Vivid imagination. Only sees what
is foretold. Forced repression. Humans have altered
their sanity. Subversive ideas they have
intentionally.The careless herd
Prepare to death
Evil was settled in my soul
The beast was settled
He requires the blood
And pain and suffering
I am a stinger infernal hive
The destroyer of life
The wave of the dark ocean
The creed justice promised by devotion
Curse you in your weaknesses
My hate shocks cattle
Destroying everything on its way
Filling heaven with the ash of the battle
My evil is my place in this world
Weak must be destroyed
Contagious die in disgrace
Slave will serveThe banished sorrow
buried in aurora
causes lifeless emotion
in the flame of my faded heart
If dead life immerses in dawn
and the shade of my schism
is to be lost into brightened blackness
death will be the only redemptionTonight is gone
They tell you it's your time
But I won't let them take you from me
And I'll never get far from you
(I'll never get far from you)
We all feel the same
(Can't stop this suffering in my head)
Can't turn this one around
If I could pull you from wreckage
We'd be all fine, oh lord
Don't tell me this is happening
If I could hold you for a second
We'd be all right, oh lord
Don't tell me this is happening
So when does it start getting better
So far from home
The lights are fading out
Just leave us all behind
If I could pull you from wreckage
We'd be all fine, oh lord
Don't tell me this is happening
If I could hold you for a second
We'd be all right, oh lord
Don't tell me this is happening
Ohhhh
I never should have let you go
Until I'll be with you
I'm dying on my own
If I could pull you from wreckage
We'd be all fine, oh lord
Don't tell me this is happening
If I could hold you for a second
We'd be all right, oh lord
Don't tell me this is happening
And I know
I'm not the only one
Don't tell me this is happening
And I know, I'm not the only one
Don't tell me this is happening
Don't tell me this is happeningTired Of Being Alive
One With Shame Tonight
Between Mistrust And Sadness
Simply Can't Tolerate This
Affected & Impressed
Now Tell Me What Is Wrong
Provide The Possibilities
But Still I Won't Believe
Let Me Tell You Of Brand New Trouble
Deconstruct Logic Foundations
Like A Ghost In A Sun
Tryin' To Explain Who I Want To Be
What If I Leave Undone
And What If Hope Was Broken
All Energy Is Gone
What If There's No Choice
And What If Time Is Not On Our Side
All Love Is Drained
ch:
This Is Everchanging
Perfect Fragile Images Crash
There' No Comfort
In Silent Room Of Nothing
Think For A Moment
Is There Any Magic Between
What Did Those Words Mean
How Could They Hurt So Deep
From A Corner Watching
There's A Different Scale
Standin' Numb & Naked
Failure Challenger's Choice[Monoxide Child:]
Now that I'm dead and gone
Look at me
I'm floating like the breeze
With my roots strong like trees
I'm filtered in your memories
Holding a candle light vigil
Saying a prayer
My name is graced
Buried with the paint on my face
I put the chase up long enough
I live the lifestyle wrong and tough
And now my life span's up
I give a fuck
I'm about to run it in the after life
And hopefully they put my soul in the butcher knife
[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
If I was to die
It'd make a lot of people happy
No funeral possesions
No plot at the cemetery
Finally
I can be alone in my own world
The wagons come take me away from the killing fields
If I was to die
Would you finally shut your mouth?
Understand what I am
Understand what I'm about
Like curse
Place me up high on your pedastil
I'm about to find out
(SHAGGY IT'S TIME TO GO)
[Chorus x2:]
I wanna die
So I can see the otherside
I wanna die
So I can fly (Take Me With You)
I wanna die
Take me to the otherside
I wanna die
So I can fly (Take Me Away)
[Violent J:]
I wanna die
Maybe I'll get angel wings
So I can cut them off
Cook them up
I have some helly wing dings
I'd take my hallo off
Get myself a ladder
Hang it on the wall
Maybe you'll think it's a gold record
Death
Everybody follow my hearse
Why does everybody always gotta go and die first?
Before their homies are missing them
Family members kissing them
Everybody even enemies stop dissing them
I want to die
So I can haunt my buddies
Stand behind them in the mirror with my eyes all bloody
Stick my long, black, cold tongue all in the ear
And be like, "I'm only playing"
And disappear
I wanna die
And have everything answered
What happened to my father?
Why was I a bastard?
What is thunder?
Is it really God bowling?
And nightime's a blanket
And all the stars are the holes in it
[Chorus x2]
Jamie Madrox:
Your answers are unneccesary
You understand
Never question the emotions
Of an unstable man
I got the petals of the Lotus
And the pedal to the floor
Following a black hearse
In the rain through a thunder storm
Never once did I invision
Me being stuck in such a situation
He made decisions
And now his spirit levitating
I can see him waving at me
Through the window of the hearse
He's crying blood
It all stops and it gets worst
[Blaze Ya Dead Homie:]
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
At least that's what I was told
When I was on the come up
Been to the grave and it ain't no joke
Resurfaced to the earth with the spirits I envoke
Cut down in my prime
When my block got hit
Now I'm riding in the back of a hearse and shit
Darkness, pitch black
Never seeing no one
And the devil got his darkest demons
Riding shotgun
[Chorus x2]
Take me away
Take me with you
Take me away
Take me with you
Take me away [echo][M & L: Thomas Eriksson]
Far away from twilight I'm searching for my soul
But still I can't find what I've journeyed for
All the distant places I've passed along my way
They seem to be fading with the remnants of the day
[BRIDGE]
See me now with the tears in my eyes
Hear my sight as I reach out for the light
[CHORUS]
So conquer the world in the afterlife
Peace now for my soul
A new revelation has just begun
Secrets left untold
Crossed the fields of sadness and oceans of true love
Now I enter the realm of the dark beyond
Embraced within the powers I've longed for all these years
Redemption must be close at hand to wash away my fears
[CHORUS]
So conquer the world in the afterlife
Peace now for my soul
A new revelation has just begun
Secrets soon I know
Fire in my eyes, I feel the pain inside that's ripping in my entity
Do I believe what I see?
And so many times I have failed to pass this test of faith
But now it's my turn, the rest of the world shall burn!
Far away from twilight you're searching for your soul
But still you can't find what you've journeyed for?
When you're on that journey just like me some times ago
Remember what the wise men said: "Go, follow your heart all the way!"
[BRIDGE]
See me now with the tears in my eyes
Hear my cry to the sky as I reach out for the light
[CHORUS]
So conquer the world in the afterlife
Peace now for my soul
A new revelation has just begun
Secrets now I knowA loved one dies, you witness the funeral, the grave
But you have the past, the memories go beyond
The time has come, the loss of a dear soul to death
The end of a life, the start of what's beyond
With time you'll forget this passing of a friend
And when all is done, it's hard to just go on
But wait fragile fol, there's something awaiting
A wish for a soul
Can this all be? Can the dead reek of life
A second time around?
So you sit and you wonder how will it happen?
And can yuo believe
For what has been done, some sort of magic,
some sort of rite?
Can they return, is this the end? Is death the final world?
Asleep with your dreams, as the terror surrounds
To take you from all peace
The tension increases, for soon you must know
As you shed from your mind
A shriek seals the horror, as you awake from your world
To see an old morbid friend
You're frightened and panic, turning away
Into a dark eerie night
And all will feel loss, the distance between, within our time
We all witness life, we all witness death
The memories are yours, the casket is theirs,
For all of man, there is a gift
But still there is no end, we go on and on
But time shall ease the pain, the pain of all dying man
And still that torment goes on
To hunt and stalk this morbid prey
For death eternally awaits
Is this the final living dream?
The torture of this reborn fiend?
No more reproduction!!! Stop the reproduction!!!
To destroy this awful beasts remains
With fire, I feed it to the flames
The corpse is laughing and burning,
Its mind is shrunken and torn,
My life revolves around the heartbeat
Of its dark and everlasting pain
A reproduction of tragedy!!!Here I'll carve the tale of the land we explored.
Stranded in a place I thought was fertile and calm.
I didn't know what hostile world laid ahead.
We were protected, Anubis judge of the dead.
Cursing the insects search for water in a sunburnt land.
We will go forward, I will persevere and never look back.
So they called me a son of a god, ironically as they laid me to rest.
Twice bitten, twice struck.
Lost motherland has swallowed us up.
I didn't know what hostile world laid ahead.
We were protected.
Anubis judge of the dead.
Read the glyphs they tell my story.
I'm the lost Pharaoh's son.
Seeking out the ancient myth of the great southern land.
Never again to see the waters of Mer.
Stuck within this southern land.
We can only defer.Let me relate you to something
Maybe a piece of myself
I`m so lonely- I don`t know why
I don`t know why I feel so much aversion for those I look alike
(Feel so much aversion for those I look alike)
How foolish a man can be
Closing my eyes I recollect remembering those Glory Days
Looking for something different, intact, extravagant
Leading me to entireness
It`s so difficult to overtake the time lying on to your dreams
But more difficult is to find one to trust in good and bad times
I made the final mistake
To believe everything around me as true
Betraying my secrets to the Wrong
I got to be their slave
Like a fading flower I feel to myself
to be as pure as them
My only acquisition along with the black thoughts
Was my own flesh
Isolation-the only way to escape
Betraying dreams and myself
And now, living lonely in this town
I try to live again screaming silently for my lost dreamsSin ser testigo de jehov

I defended you
despite our past
I still breathe for you (for you..)
my side is chosen for destiny
and this is all I see
Leaves falling down
falling side by side
all I predicted has now begun
Leaves falling down
anywhere I hide
all that was laid down
it seems I drown
You made my beliefs grow little stronger
I'm at the end
can't feel it no longer (longer..)
When I dream
I am still awake
and this is all I see
Leaves falling down
falling side by side
all I predicted has now begun
leaves falling down
anywhere I hide
all that was laid down
it seems I drown
Leaves fall down

Leaves falling down

Leaves falling down
falling side by side
all I predicted has now begun
leaves falling to pieces

it seems I drown
Leaves falling down

leaves falling down
anywhere I hide (anywhere I hide..)
all that was laid down
it seems I drownYou were down and I wasn't around
So I just want to let you know how I feel
I guess I know that you're needing me now
I want to be there but I just don't know how
What was I gonna do 'cause you was there when I needed you
And now I'm feeling down 'cause you need me and I'm not around
Tell me can I make you see, make you feel and believe in me?
I don't know what it is but I need to let you know girl
CHORUS
If you want to
Then baby clap your hands now
If you're gonna

'cause I can give you everything that you'll ever need
So baby take your chances on me
Now that I've just realized
That I haven't really been there for you
I promise you I know how you're feeling
And I'm understanding what I should do
What was I gonna do 'cause you was there when I needed you
And now I'm feeling down 'cause you need me and I'm not around
Tell me can I make you see, make you feel and believe in me?

So baby take your chances on meThe stench from the forest
Of burning skin
Bringing memories back
From ancient Sacrifices
It has been centuries
Since I left my body
But I still live
Through the sound of torture
My sense falls to the depths of
Filth, pain and suffering
Which is feeding my inspiration
To my art of undead human corpse sculpture
I taste the evil
To satisfy my mental hunger
If I wasn't immortal I would be dead (again)
For the last timeThere are things that happen
To certain people when they're finally dead
Many never end up resting in their deserved casket bed
Cadavers in the wrong hands
Can come up for grabs
Join the countless corpses
On the mortuary auction slabs
The dead become a hot commodity, ready to sell
Merchandise on a market straight from hell
Price tags
Replace morgue tags
Vacant coffins buried
No one will ever know
As the wealthy gather
The bidding soon starts
Top dollar paid for human body parts
The auction is a success
Every bidder gets a piece
The gavel cracks loudly
Setting more of the deceased
The auctioneer shrieks as the bidding escalates
Unsold limbs lay on the selling block awaiting their fate
Vital organs in working order
Rake in the greatest cash
Physical merchandise drains each monetary slash
Price tags
Replace morgue tags
Vacant coffins buried
No one will ever know
As the wealthy gather
The bidding soon starts
Top dollar paid for human body parts
The auction is a success
Every bidder gets a piece
The gavel cracks loudly
Selling more of the deceased
For the eccentric, there is a black market
A death-dealing auction for the upper class jetset
Upon a necro-there the sale is based
Catering to every odd and strange taste
Bids and transactions for items of flesh
Purchasing quickly, as the dead lay fresh
Great sums paid for pieces of the dead
Highest price paid may take a complete head
Price tags
Replace morgue tags
Vacant coffins buried
No one will ever know
As the wealthy gather
The bidding soon starts
Top dollar paid for human body parts
The auction is a success
Every bidder gets a piece
The gavel cracks loudly
Selling more of the deceasedMore all the stars that ever shone for me
Come with the fingers of the destiny
Can you hear songs of a tiny swallow
I hear them too and there is no need
But I can fly
Like a bird in this reality
I see you
Tease me but the time of my vitality
Will be over
The air wraps me up with the feathers
The sun becomes so unbelievable
Can you hear the sounds of a tiny swallow
I hear them too...
But I can fly

Their babe criesI lay awake and look at the ceiling and wonder why
I'm so afraid to face all these feelings and want to die
I'm out of place and nothing's appealing to stay alive
Why try to face it when it's so easy to say goodbye
It's all unfolding, it's so controlling
It tries to pull me under, nothing's going right for me
This tension's growing, it tries to hold me
Hear me scream
I'm taking over
With my back to the ropes, I'm never letting go
I'm moving closer
Everything that I know is feeling farther from home
I'm never giving in,
This world I'm living in is losing color
I'm taking over
With my back to the ropes, I'm never letting go
I try to make the changes, it's so hard to sway my mind
There is no way to make it but to leave these scars behind
Within my thoughts are racing, I'm too far away at times
I drive myself insane, it's tearing me apart inside
It's all unfolding, it's so controlling
It tries to pull me under, nothing's going right for me
This tension's growing, it tries to hold me
Hear me scream
I'm taking over
With my back to the ropes, I'm never letting go
I'm moving closer
Everything that I know is feeling farther from home
I'm never giving in
This world I'm living in is losing color
I'm taking over
With my back to the ropes, I'm never letting go
I take a deep breath down inside
I shake and try to breathe but I
Hate the way that I lived my life
And it seems
All the lies that I try to hide
Remind me of what I left behind
Unwinding thoughts inside my mind
Hear me scream
I'm screaming out loud
It's all just weighing on me
It's all just weighing on me
I'm reaching out
I'm screaming out loudI feel like I am hurt
Can't you see
I try to express
But I act like you're a stranger to me
I want to share, but don't know how
My eyes can't speak
And my mouth won't write it down
And there's so much confusion
as I want to clear it up
Cause when I start, suddenly,
the end has begun
Maybe if I touch, you will feel
what I mean but you're acting strange
Cause my eyes look differently
Caught by death, I do not hope
that my release is decided long ago
I try to get out
To jump at once in a place
Where it's all right or wrong
and I won't be afraid
I open myself for you
and all those othersHe with power, strike me down
Redden my seas and Ill feel depths below frustration
Send to me, plague after fucking plague
Let the locusts, feed upon my body
Lead us not to blind faith, go paint your blood
On another doorway
Treason never felt so good
When belief, flows through the fatuous
Where were you?
When there was only one way out?
When they were sinking to the seabed
They prey to the heavens
With no return
Oh this earth is yours
As is the right, to show some respect
We refuse to concede
So abort the burial of this hatchet
Abort the burial of this hatchet
And I will part the seas to
Find a way to
Writhe in the torment of every
Innocent life thats been torn
to fucking shreds
to fucking shreds
So now we rise
And face this kingdom
The holy ghost now haunts this abyss
So now we rise
Were burning down his empire
His city of light now buried in darkness
Where were you?
When there was only one way out?
When they were sinking to the seabed
They prey to the heavens
With no return
Where were you?
When there was only one way out?
When they were sinking to the seabed
They prey to the heavens
With no return
With no return.They are the Wise-Men,
Came from the West
From the God-forsaken
Land of pests.
Their tongue is weapon,
A double-edged sword
Killing the innocent
And it's killing the old
Their weapon is their tongue
Double-edged sword
Wrethes the innocent
Drives nuts the old
They hide behind
Mighty cyber-mist
And they never see,
Their friend the Beast
They seek revenge
In land of pests
They dig up dirt
From the snobish west
Their weapon is their tongue
Double-edged sword
Wrethes the innocent
Drives nuts the old
Wise-Men of the west
Not gonna pass the test
Wise-Men of the West
Filth and dirt and mess
They are the Wise-Men,
Came from the West
From the God-forsaken
Land of pests.
Their tongue is weapon,
A double-edged sword
Killing the innocent
And it's killing the old
Their weapon is their tongue
Double-edged sword
Wretches the innocent
Drives nuts the old
Wise-Men of the West
Not gonna pass the test
Wise-Men of the West
Filth and dirt and mess
Don't hide, don't lie
'Cause
I see you, guys.pollution has caused destruction of life
We are warned by Nature ignore it and die
Chemical warfare, Nuclear attack
All causes changes of what's after that
The positive research once made by the Science
Has been turned against as by the Authority
Once a free Planet now trapped in this Nightmare
Where success was expected a failure to be
Before - we lived life in pleasure
We loved - we had natural births
In blood - we pay for our weakness
We are - at war with Science
From Testtube to womb a new life beginning
Sterile injected but doomed to be freak
Experiment with life genetic confusion
With Science as weapon perfection to seekThe twelve raise their tin horns
Into the wake of dawn
But as the tides rise they realize
The march has long gone home
And the lonely melody tunes again
To the consonance of the wind
As we die, the sun and earth do shine,
Will the stars remain if you and I
Leave earth like leaves on wind?
Like waves in the brine
Tin horns make us sleep
We never wanted to stay
We never wanted to...
Like a wreck of time
An abandoned ship
Beneath us splits the void
But we never look backThis day I'd like to thank you
All the bullets you shooted me
So when you were sure
That I'm a perfect aim
One blind man saw my face
And asked me what I feel
My answer wasn't too great
So he told me: "You won't escape"
I warned you so many times
That won't be a prey
'Cause I will hunt you
Till your head will be my state
I visioned a brave new world
Without this killing spree
And then I saw your guns
And I get it won't mercy
You tried to stain my faith
With your superficial life
What is a rotten shame
And a bloody dangerous lie
You are the sacrifice
Of my endless pain
And I taste your sweet tears
That you can't retain
You're looking at your salvation
Whilst I throw off disguise
And you feel you loose everything
And my power will arise
I see into your soul and
I'm playing with your belief
And you are a fugitive man
But won't find relief
This day I'd like to thank you
All the bullets you shooted me
So when you were sure
That I'm a perfect aim
One blind man saw my face
And asked me what I feel
My answer wasn't too great
So he told me: "You won't escape"
You are the sacrifice
Of my endless pain
And I taste your sweet tears
That you can't retain
You're looking at your salvation
Whilst I throw off disguise
And you feel you loose everything
And my power will arise
You are the sacrifice
Of my endless pain
And I taste your sweet tears
That you can't retain
You're looking at your salvation
Whilst I throw off disguise
And you feel you loose everything
And my power will ariseFor all kings committed
For all kings old and new
Young blood of the old blood
For all kings are through
My insides pulled front to back
Nothing is solved in this act
Teaches you what humanity lacks
Compassion and empathy
Everything tears at, tears away at all else
And all the darkness, inside of my world breathes
And I can't leave
For all kings committed
For all kings old and new
Young blood of the old blood
For all kings are through
When the noise is gone you're there
Through the storm our souls laid bare
Given all beyond too much
The strongest love lifts me up
As my sky turns black, turns black as if asleep
The king is dead so
Long live the man in me, by divine right
For all kings committed
For all kings old and new
Young blood of the old blood
For all kings are through
I'd do anything, with all my power brings
I'd do anything
To save you
For all kings committed
For all kings old and new
Young blood of the old blood
For all kings are through
Oh oh oh
I'd do anything, with all my power brings
I'd do anything
To save you
I'd do anything[Instrumental]I'm the one who gave you life
Worship me with every dawn
I'm the bomb that takes your life
I'm the star of your solar system
I'm the owner of your planet
Your lives
You'd lose in darkness without me
I'm the owner of your planet
Your lives
Your would lose
In darkness without me
It takes me 8 minutes to you
It takes you 93 millions miles to me
I'm your star
I'm king here, dominant being
My moment is your eternity
I'm master of chain-reactionAt Hilly's show
they didn't know
that the Ending of "Being" is near
I can feel their voices
the old man cries
"Please save the boy
he's caught in a world far behind
from home"
Monster Anne is crying out
"Feel my pain I can't escape"
Bad chances for me

chosen by their whispering words
What is left behind?
When purple colours turn to black
Can you feel it?
Is there time?
Can you see it?
Is there life?
"Fly away and dream"Keep this on your mind,
Keep it within your eyelids.
We have ascended countless stairs,
Perhaps it gas interrupted our thoughts.
Regret is an inception, regret is a beginning.
Miles and miles of wires build the apparatus,
But don't mistake power lines for shelter.
I forgot and it will more than likely happen again.
Drink and binge the waters of the sea.
Keep this on your mind,
Keep it within your eyelids.
Don't climb for a lifetime only to fall short of infinity.
Everything is left.
With faith, some minds are sand
But I prefer concrete.
This is what is going to separate us from them.
Time for the next chapter.
Keep this on your mind,
Keep it within your eyelids.Ridicule my own
So precious alone
These faces of everyone
Remind me of home
You're plotting riddled sin
All my needs giving in
Blow me a kiss and leave me to the dogs
So, you think you got it
You think you know me
You wanna bring me down
I am in my finest hour
Ridicule my own
So precious alone
These faces of everyone
Remind me of home
You're watching me dying
How am I looking?
Why don't you take a picture
You're plotting riddled sin
All my needs giving in
Blow me a kiss
And leave me to the dogs
My fear, traps me waiting for it
My past is glowing red and yellow, again
Run, back where you came from
Not that it matters
I'll never see you again
My fists strain to sift mercy
Ridicule my own
So precious alone
These faces of everyone
Remind me of home
You're plotting riddled sin
All my needs giving in
Blow me a kiss and leave me to the dogsroot in man and woman
god in child
the serenity no mask
for the divinity they ask for
twist writhe serpentine
long day gone
day gone long
the diablo wandering
is unnoticed with roots in all known elements
speaking in tongues
now that god is the machine
now that they are indivisible
we walk with instincts
erased - erased
long day gone
day gone longI've been so many places
In my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs
I've made some bad rhymes
I've acted out my life on stages
With 10,000 people watching
But we're alone now
And I'm singing this song to you
I know your image of me
Is what I hoped to be
I treated you unkindly
But darling, can't you see?
There's no one more important to me
Baby, can't you see through me?
'Cause we're alone now
And I'm singing this song to you
You taught me precious secrets
Of a true love while holding nothing
You came out in front when I was hiding
But now I'm so much better
And if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody
'Cuz my love is in there hiding
I love you in a place
Where there's no space or time
I love you for my life
'Cuz you' re a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
We were alone
And I was singing this song to you
I love you in a place
Where there's no space or time
I love you for my life
'Cuz you' re a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
We were alone
And I was singing this song to you
We were alone
And I was singing this song to you
We were alone
And I was singing this song
Singing this song to youAt night I swim the dark depths
so hard so much of it
oceans drown feelings somewhere
time is not a friend
hearts got empty and don't remember
I cannot fly anymore
the dreamed lands remain far from here
mysterious and unknowing
I can understand so much
I remember only one moment
when the dreams died
and when they left only heavens wept
from the clouds with rain
the thoughts have fallen down
the dreams have fallen down
no way leads to the stars now
no thought will ever enrapture
I dissapear in darkness
no thinking of words of freedom
everything I forgot somewhereUpon the moor
A ragged shape
So silent stand
In your dreams
With outstretched wings
The Angel dance
So dark and fearful
Can you see his face?
And then another vision
Will this never end?
Dark and deep
The endless sea
Where the dreamer dwells
Belial felt
The dragons breathe
Then the Angels fell
To play among the shadows
Can you hear them call?
Penetrate the silence
Will you heed their call?
Another night
The Broken one
Is back again
The Scarecrow
Can't be banished
Who will hear you pray?
Upon the moor in silence
Heed the dreamers call
It penetrate the silence
Will you heed their call?The wind is made of thunder
The dark is made of dreams
The wizards ride the hills tonight
Doing battle with electric screams
And against a spear of lightning
A figure rides the stars
His steed a dragon red and gold
His weapon a black guitar
My fingers played like hellfire
As I played the killing chord
The dragon screams and falls from sky
As if pierced by magic sword
But it's rider find a stabbing note
Before they crash to flame
I am caught in a mighty storm of devils in my brain
Warriors of the dark
[Repeat]My body sinks through thick-mud
I wanna grasp something but just cannot
I fell my end and I see myself dead
While the waves dask-over my head
Gasp for breath, sink deeper -n- deeper
The light glimmers hardly and much more paler
My body grows weary, I don't feel pain
Every trouble seems to be far away
Life before my eyes
No one can tell me lies
I will see the secret
The question: Is it the beginning or is it the end?
The press of the mud is embrace now
I don't wanna be back and don't know how
I lost the sight of light, I can't see the surface
My new home is the restfull spaceTo live is to die the last hope burned down to dust
Out of mind but without any fear waiting for the end now
On our way to downfall, thoughts drifting in the sea of passion
I had read the book of life and it killed me
Hate for your lies burns in my heart
Why does falseness always have to win?
I wanna unfold my soul
Don't wanna be imprisoned by you
My comfort my death will be yours as well
Face to face with death we are all the same
Lost in visions I all hope fades out
What remains is just a highImmortal
Ten centuries since I'm resting with shadows
Can you feel me rise
I am the darkness
I am the vampire
I am the neverending flame
Impeding death
Beneath the lands
Those beliefs are true
Free the flame lost for so long
Rise
Bring the legend alive
Open your world to me
Be not afraid to dive
Soul is no longer free
Do you like what you see
Giant walls painted with blood
Those beliefs are true
Here lies the corpse of my enemies
I am the darkness
I am the vampire
I am the neverending flame
Impeding death
Beneath the lands
Those beliefs are true
Free the flame lost for so long
Rise
Bring the legend alive
Open your world to me
Be not afraid to dive
Soul is no longer free
Hypnotic
Resting under the stone
For thousand yearsCruel rays of light tear the dark inside
The new day on the town invades my mind
A crowd creeps in silence, taking hold of the roads
Where I wes king 'til few hours before
It breathes the pollution and pisses gray
What they call life's death compared to what Night can give us
With all Her thieves and whores
... Night can give us and always does
We are all Kings, all Queens, not slaves
From dusk till dawn
Living to shine now
Living to shine
From dusk till dawn
We shine till dawn
Now Venus is rising to the west of Void
The old day on the town is fading out
A huge power swells inside of me
as the mob of lost souls thins and turns to the cells
I watch the crowd there and feel mercy
All your dreams are nothing compared to what Night will give us
With all Her sins and love
... Night will give us a crown of thorns
We are all Kings, all Queens, not slaves
From dusk till dawn
Living to shine now
Living to shine
From dusk till dawn
We shine till dawn(Brutal Truth)
Act it up all you want

No reason, your lies unfold

Let out the hate you feel
Blame all your doubts on me
And your caving reality
I will not judge, I cannot judge
So feel free to question me
I would hold you when you're sleeping
I would guide you when you're drifting
I'd be the light you seek in your darkest hour
I will show you how to leave it
Out of the darkness & into the light
Leave it
I will show you how to leave it
To find a new day & a vision in bright
Feel free to question me
Let out the hate you feel
Walk through insanity
And awake into crystal clarityCierra los ojos y dime que ves
Oscuridad total rodendote
Te sientes solo, corriendo tras un sueo
Necesitas fuerzas que destierren tu dolor
Todo es en vano, si el fuego no intenta salir
Hay cosas que jams se perdieron en ti
Ocultas tras un antifaz
Siempre has sentido ganas d volver a tener
Aquel poder vital, aquella voluntad
Todo es en vano, si el fuego no intenta salirTime, What is time
The tale of pain and death, the moments of our lives
Pain never dies
You only suffer more when death stares into your eyes
Wounds never heal
The scars are there to stay, the memory remains
Lost never found
Your soul is let astray when your body fades away
Never the same again, Scarred by the years of pain
Never the fool again, Scarred by the years of pain
To be dead is to always live in their memories
And walk alone on a path of grief
To be dead is to always scream at the silence
Forever trapped in a place of pain
Pain, what is pain
The tales are the pain. The moments never die
Dead are the lies
The truth is here to stay. As the liars fades away
Lost, never found
Their souls are led astray. Their words to be slain
Pain never dies
You only suffer more when death stares into your eyesIdeology used as a weapon with lines that cut so deeply to the truth
Your head's on the clock and still you threaten
A wretched way of life for those that choose and abuse
Believe, nothing worth believing in
Believe, stand for nothing care for nothing
Believe, empty words a false doctrine
Blooded in your holy word's goal
Look what you did so fucking sick it's what you did
The evil twin of devotion then now you're dead
You represent your discontent slaughtering the innocent
Insolence, you're no martyrs
The arrogance to reinvent
The holy words their meanings bent
Evil twins, you're no martyrs
(No martyrs)
(No martyrs)
(No martyrs)
Refuse and resist dictated terror
Fighting a war with both feet in
Savage that our planet is the venue
For a festival of massacres
Believe, nothing worth believing in
Believe, stand for nothing care for nothing
Believe, empty words a false doctrine
Blooded in your holy word's goal
Look what you did so fucking sick it's what you did
The evil twin of devotion and now you're dead
You represent your discontent slaughtering the innocent
Insolence, you're no martyrs
The arrogance to reinvent
The holy words their meanings bent
Evil twins, you're no martyrs
(No martyrs)
(No martyrs)
(No martyrs)
Broke and sickened by the senseless atrocity
And repulsion for this old world reality
Forcing fear to dominate
Hate a loaded gun
When in doubt, have no doubt
Death has just begun
You represent your discontent slaughtering the innocent
Insolence, you're no martyrs
The arrogance to reinvent
The holy words their meanings bent
Evil twins, you're no martyrs
(No martyrs)
(No martyrs)
(No martyrs)Craig, you've been to see Manchester City. How was it?
Er, grim.
Grim? Really? Well once again, you see, because people always assume that I've got loads of technology available to me here and lots of people rushing about giving me bits of paper like they do on television. In fact I'm Just watching the television so erm...
[...]
Oh right yeah. Okay go on, tell us all about it
Well I mean the first half we were all over them. It's a typical City game, why'know. Ye were like totally outplayed, and they're rubbish anyway, West Ham, it's got to be said. [.. .] but erm no we were all over them in the first half and I don't know what he puts in the tea in the second half but erm we were like kinda zombies when we came back on. There weren't any good players apart from er Rocastle which I thought was
that one little thing where he sort of...
......
Yeah we do we play lots of football, loads of passing, they play too much football, they're just kind of er. . . everyone's like looking for a passing opportunity rather than like a scoring opportunity.
Not going to go down though, are they, Craig?
Er.. .I don't know. Everyone else in er. .. everyone else thinks we're gonna go down but they've just like suddenly come out of closets, why'know, they've like discovered their grandfather was a United fanfar.
Right
...some years back It's like the whole of Manchester at the moment anyway
I was told you see, I was always told er the conventional wisdom was that .... that isn't the case any more.
Well the true Mancunian is the Man City fan, I find.
(laughs)
I mean they're all reds really aren't they and er. . .

All we see, when barriers fade away: yet unseen territory
All we know: the rising from below leads us into infinityA lethal bolt pierces the air
Like a falling star
Young eyes are observing in the darkness
His stare's reflecting fright
And scared he's struggling hard
To go back
Uneasy warders guard
The jail on quiet nights
Mankind will soon learn
Young eyes contemplating somewhere to hide
That the end has come in time
Dividing lands, retracing
Revealing ages when the absence
Of forgiveness rules our lives
All the borders will colide
Home how I go
Written on the sand
My badge is wearing out
Words to reconcile - unholy wars
For we have sinned
We know not what we do
Forgive us our father
Blinded by pride
Thy kingdom will be done
By holy wars
The battle is over
But the war still rages on!
Bridge
ChorusA hamlet lord had taken me in
He was an elder lacking kin
His wing was mentorous and protective
The celestial erudition he was about to share
As a boy i'd learned much on my own
Recognizing pre-war signs and dialects
But Lord Elmreckt was a master intellectual
Capable of feats unproven by science
The first step: to understand the fear
To control the reflexes of mental lapse
Following this: the medicinary state
Where expanding the mind is possible by the use of linear projection
And for long months, I listened, practiced and learned
My mind's eye has transcended the scars of the earth
My awareness immense, my instincts now honed
Lord Elmreckt and I were tapping into the unknown
And oh, the sight and the sound!
Like a billion explosions, but black and calm
And this alleged continuum of space and time?
It is not at all like what is said in thr old world's books
"Quiet" he said, "We are travelling at a humungous speed
Down an unchartable quarter of the astral sleet"
It was so intense that I felt death grip me
Toy with me, follow me and then let me go
Apparition: "There is a land far away across the violent sea
9000 solsti have passed since a dying and unearthly race
Tried to cultivate there. It is important that their work is completed.
Not for their sake, but for yours

Verlangen ist mein Wort

Verhrmt is mein Blick
Gleichgltig meine Andacht
Dennoch erhebt sich Sehnsucht
aus tiefen, dunklem Abgrund

(#_# by Ivar Bjrnson 1994)
# Forget all laws, all order and peace
Chaos is everything; no time or place
Now when all light and life ends,
When the wind now is killing,
The chain has broken... #
The time has come
as the Norns predicted
nothing lasts forever
the Battle at Vigrid shall come
there is no brother
there is no strong bounds
The bound anger is loose
inner coldness is free
a river of foam
has dried up
the Power of the Wolf, the obscure hate
No longer sees a time
Angrboda beared
her name justly
With Lauvous son she breeded
dread, hate and death
a cry of warning in the dark
the mountain's roots, bear tendons
Woman heard, the sound of catsteps
breath from the fish, spit from the bird
tamed forces from a forgotten time
has held Our Wolf in chains
But not forever!
Fenris is loose
Now our wisdom
is swallowed by ancient hate
The nine steps are fulfilled
A new road is laid
Music: Ivar Bjrnson 1994Forces of the northern lights, assemble
Forces of the northern nights, call to arms
Summoned by the secrets of sacrifice
Meeting destiny on the road we took to avoid it
As we only compete with ourselves
Left is that of a confident union
What bridge to cross and what bridge to burn
Deceit is everywhere you turn
We weed out the weak and they weep
Evolving, compulsively
Behaving, inconsistently
Yet the pulse is pounding
Restoration is the name
For those who are left in the game
Invocation in the name of our flame
(Of our flame)
Dimmu borgir!
The deviants seek but one place
Dimmu borgir!
Forward, onward, march!
Forgive we shall not
Forget we shall not
With trickery and treats
Enemies will face defeats
No place for dreamers
As our formation is lava
Fire is with or against you
And so it burns
Constant retribution calling
From the shadows of three consecutive sixes
Merging with the cold dark vacuum
Talent is worthless unless exercised
When the world is turning
You'll find your true nature
When the first is last and the last is first
You'll be where you choose to be
Forgive we shall not
Forget we shall not
Fire is with or against you
And so it burnsYou came from nowhere and took me by surprise when I was blind
You came out of the shadow and dug your way inside my mind
The empty void inside me was filled with something as thick as tar
The deep cuts in my soul won't heal without me getting scarred
I want it
I need it
I feel it
I bleed
I am drained (drained)
New blood in my veins
I am drained (drained)
New blood in my veins
The things I've said and done will not be soon forgotten
You cannot bring me down you cannot save your own rotten soul
I want it
I need it
I feel it
I bleed
I am drained (drained)
New blood in my veins
I am drained (drained)
New blood in my veins
So many times I've reached out for you I've always found myself alone
I'm blind no more I see the light where you have gone
I want it
I need it
I feel it
I bleed
I am drained (drained)
New blood in my veins
I am drained (drained)
New blood in my veins
Drain me
Drain me
Fill me with new blood
Drain me
Drain me
Fill me with new bloodDo you feel what I feel, see what I see, hear what I hear?
There is a line you must draw
Between your dream world and reality
Do you live my life or share the breath I breathe?
Lies feed your judgment of others behold
How the blind lead each other?
The philosopher
You know so much about nothin' at all
Ideas that fall under shadows of theories that stand tall
Thoughts that grow narrow, upon bein' verbally released
Your mind is not your own what sounds more mentally
Stimulating is how you make your choice
So you preach about how I'm supposed to be
Yet you don't know your own sexualityso many days are spent
pacing away to me
oh it's an accident?
trivial honesty
lay your pulses on the road
lay your wisdom on the road
split the difference darling
stack promises two by two
may i keep this thing away from you?
green
the hall
my original weekend
the order was tall
the closets were speaking
i bend under the weight of all this fate and paint my face
my heart is dead
oh split the difference darling
stack promises two by two
may i keep this thing away from you?
i feel so jaded
i feel so jaded
i feel so wasted
i'm much older, i'm so much older
by the way i brought you into this (x3)
by the way i brought you inside.For years for this felling of intimacy
This pleasant well-known shower
Of endearment
My love for you burns like a fire
In my deepest self
Your life is the absolute
Perfection on earth
People would kill for these
Feelings and emotions
My thoughts circle around your life,
Around our life till eternity
You are the enrichment of my life
You are the vitality of my life
My heart enflames at the sight of you
I would die if i couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
I hear you smile
Your voice in my dreams
When i wake day and night
I would die if i couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
I hear you smile
Your voice in my dreams
When i wake day and night
But i would never like to miss
The feeling
Once i gave you my heart
And you treat it like your own
Flesh and blood
Emotions say more then
Thousand words
With you to the end of the world
To the end of our life
Neither death nor satan are
Capable of separating us
You are the enrichment of my life
You are the vitality of my life
My heart enflames at the sight of you
I would die if i couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
I hear you smile
Your voice in my dreams
When i wake day and night
I would die if i couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
I hear you smile
Your voice in my dreams
When i wake day and night
For love
For love
You are the enrichment of my life
You are the vitality of my life
My heart enflames at the sight of you
I would die if i couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
I hear you smile
Your voice in my dreams
When i wake day and night
I would die if i couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
I hear you smile
Your voice in my dreams
When i wake day and night
Your eyes are like a drug
For love
For loveSavour!
The things that never were!
Escape!
To/from reality!
That never was!
That never will be!
Prohibit!
All the little things!
Crawl!
Into serenity!
That could've been!
That will never be!
[Chorus:]
Smile - I said smile you slime
Smile!
It's all falling apart!
Plunge!
Into catastrophe!
That was today!
That remains the same!
[Chorus]
It's all falling apart
[Chorus]The cheap politician got his way, and there's nothing you can do
His appealing nature wants to play, and he's ready to pursue
So take a step back 'cause you want nothing to do with this
Single-handedly proving, and constantly moving with closed fists
This is nothing new the second time around, 'cause he's said it all before
Ever changing, nothing new this time around
His lies swept up on the bedroom floor
So take a step back 'cause you want nothing to do with this
Single-handedly proving, and constantly moving with closed fists
Single-handedly proving, and constantly moving with closed fists
His bags are packed full of broken pride, and it's just another day
It's just another day
So take a step back, take a step back away from me
Shot down from the watch tower, longing for new-found power
'Cause that politician got his way, and there's nothing you can do
So take a step back 'cause you want nothing to do with this
Single-handedly proving, and constantly moving with closed fists
His bags are packed full of broken pride, and it's just another day
He said, it's just another dayHello is there someone out there who can hear me scream
What you hear is not the same in a mystical dream
I know if you read between the lines it is serene
There's a darkness in the shadows you can fear
Higher louder overdrive
Can you be the one to lift me higher
The future can be brighter
Someone be my guiding light
Maybe I can give what you require
Can't stop rewind so mesmerize
Mesmerize
Maximize me
Let's go beyond reality
If you can see what I see
Hypnotize maximize me
Let's take it to eternity
Believe the will inside of me
Come home to a life you never wanted to be real
I'm crawling deep within you in control
Bring me dignity to free this soul
Nothing ever lets me
Turn into the overdrive
Let me change my destiny forever
And no one will forget me
Let me swim against the tide
Maybe I will yearn for your desire
Maximize I'm mezmerized
Mesmerize
Maximize me
Let's go beyond reality
If you can see what I see
Hypnotize maximize me
Let's take it to eternity
Believe the will inside of me
Higher louder overdrive
Can you be the one to lift me higher
The future can be brighter
Someone be my guiding light
Maybe I can give what you require
Can't stop rewind so mesmerize
Mesmerize
Maximize me
Let's go beyond reality
If you can see what I see
Hypnotize maximize me
Let's take it to eternity
Believe the will inside of meMark my words - for I speak the truth and foresee
I've seen the winged shadow
The harbinger of the upcoming storm
And warriors which gathered
And inflamed their pagan hearts
I've read the dark signs and foretell you
The final battle under the hammer
Of the banished gods...Slit down from the thorax, to free all,
the gas that should not be there,
the cerebrum will have not survived,
upon close examination, from the chest to the skull,
has show the movement of fluids that the surface refused,
co-injections have failed to prepare the remains,
there's much too much to be saved, decomposition has claimed,
what was an animal frame with it's organs and brain,
will be dissected and then reduced to mush,
It's not to be chopped to bring you power,
it's only to be devoured,
what is it now that you throw doubt upon,
don't ask of things you not meant to have or know,
have or know,
Pre-embalming purge, and rotting pigmentation,
extra firming fluids, and hardening compounds,
nasal aspiration.In dark and endless nights
Fire's giving gloomy light
In the great hall we sit together
While outside the stormclouds gather
An oaken table,mighty walls
The glory circle in these halls
Listen to songs of forgotten aeons
The story of the nightmare demon
When we are gathered in the hall
They tell a wintertale
Of a time that is gone
They are singing their song
From a distance, some faint light
Coming closer, like ghosts in the night
It's a courier, and what he brings
From the darkness, are bad tidings
The evil demon, back from the dead
Darker than ever, again he spreads
Gaining force to, retaliate
Was our fight, to no avail
When we are gathered in the hall
They tell a wintertale
Of a time that is gone
They are singing their song
Hope is weakened, (our) pride is gone
It's all in vain, and nothing?s won
Fear is rising, the tide has turned
The golden future, is all burned
Feeling bitter, and crestfallen
My way home now, is stolen
Without mercy, and all our might
No surrender, we?ll take the fight
When we are gathered in the hall
They tell a wintertale
We will fight till it's won
Till the last man is goneWe call out to the beasts of the sea to come forth and join us, this night is yours
Because, one day we will all be with you in the black and deep
One day we will all go into the water
Go into the water
live there die there
live there die
We reject our earthly fires
Gone are days of land empires
Lungs transform to take in water
Cloaked in scales we swim and swim on
We are alive, and we'll metamorphasize
And we'll sink as we devolve back to beasts
Our home is down here, and we've known this for years
We must conquer from the sea, we build an army with water steeds
We'll rise, from our depths down below
Release yourselves, drown with me
We will conquer land with water
Gone are days of land empires
Lungs transform to take in water
Cloaked in scales we swim and swim on
We swim on
We swim onI try to quench the pain
I try to drench these days
Time and time again, I fall on my face
Every time I tell myself
I've got a hold of this
I run back to it, sink right in
I fail, I fall, I fall on my face
I bend, I break
I can't take, I can't take the weight
I've seen so many
Burning holes through themselves
And if it's not my poison, they've got their own
Anything to mask these days
Anything to numb the pain
'Cause this worlds on fire
And I can't take the weight
I fail, I fall, I fall on my face
I bend, I break
I can't take, I can't take the weight
I fail, I fall, I bend, I break
I fail, I fall, I bend, I break
Burning holes through myself
Burning holes through myself
[Incomprehensible], bend and break
[Incomprehensible], bend and break
Burning holes through myself
I'm burning holes through myselfI've been trying to ease my mind
From this life that I have been thrown into
I no longer know who to trust
They keep hurting me no matter what I do
It's a big world out there
And sometimes it can swallow you up
But never give up yeah
I've been tryin' to find a friend in this crazy world
And the more that I try to find a friend in this crazy world
I'll sail the seven seas
I would climb a mountain high
To get you in this world of mine
I've been dying to meet someone
Just to share all the things other people do
Just a laugh or a cry
Just a simple goodbye
I will see you soon, would do
I promise you I won't let you down
Come to me
I will make you see yeah
To get you in this world of mine
I've been searching for someone to care
Someone who'll always be there
To get you in this world of mine
I've been tryin' (I'm tryin') to find (I'm dying) a friend
(I'm fighting) in this crazy world (I'm fighting for you)
And the more that (I'm tryin') I try (I'm dying) to find
A friend (I'm fighting) in this crazy world (I'm fighting for you)
I'll sail the seven seas
I would climb a mountain high
To get you in this world of mineMusic: Mikael Dahl - Lyrics: Dahl, Gtesson
I've found a way back to my home at last
A way that has been locked and cloaked until now
It's time to take care of my programmed past,
find the answers, and then finally fulfil my vow
Pre Chorus
I've learned from my ship's secret files
that they planned my unwanted exile!
I knew too much about their insane plan
I had to leave, from the Earth I was banned
Chorus
For years I have travelled in the dark and endless space,
cast out from the human race
For vengeance I'm yearning now as I'm returning
to make my wrongdoers pay for my lonely days
Revenge!
Imperfect data I got from below,
but I've learned enough from my unknown friend
They sent me away so their empire could grow
On Terra my vengeance shall descend
Pre Chorus
Chorus
Solo Both
Bridge
I'm burning of hatred and rage,
for their lies and my time lost in space
I'll end the Interstellar War,
and disclose their plans of the human race
Chorus
Revenge will be mine!There's nothing I can't face
So open the flood gates
No fear of what's to come
I'm not going under
Not running for cover
Standing against the sun
After the fire, after the flames
Nothing will feel the same
My scars are closing, my heart is open
I am not afraid
I'm ready to burn again
I'm beginning to catch my breath
I'm ready to dream again
Surviving will love me for take
I had to bleed to lose
Find myself to prove
I could feel love without you
I'm all that I have
I am the aftermath!
Show with no mercy
Cause it cannot hurt me
No more will I bite my tongue
Tired of worthless fighting the purpose
No long I will last stay numb
After the fire, after the flames
Nothing will feel the same
My scars are closing, my heart is open
I am not afraid
I'm ready to burn again
I'm beginning to catch my breath
I'm ready to dream again
Surviving will love me for take
I had to bleed to lose
Find myself to prove
I could feel love without you
I'm all that I have
I am the aftermath!
Break my bones, you will see;
You can't kill me, you can't kill me!
Break my bones, you will see;
You can't kill me, you can't kill me!
You can't kill me!
I'm ready to break again
I'm beginning to catch my breath
I'm ready to dream again
Surviving will love me for take
I had to bleed to lose
Find myself to prove
I could feel love without you
I'm all that I have
I'm all that I have
I'm all that I have
I am the aftermath!
I am the aftermath!
(Aftermath)
Break my bones, you will see;
You can't kill me, you can't kill me!
Break my bones, you will see;
You can't kill me, you can't kill me!Hold close the human in you
Cherish your freedom
Let nothing deny you
Your enemy hides from the truth
Clings to the darkness (cowers in the shadow)
You are the essence of proof
Positive vision of strength individual
Not paralyzed
Not compromised
In dreams reside the fate of man
Recognize those who'll destroy
Those who will suck from your hard work and struggle
To governments you're but a toy
Anonymous mules (on whose backs they ride freely)
Give not to Caesar his tithe
Instead care for yourself, your family, your pride
You're not categorized
Not number assigned
With dreams you provide for the hope of man
[Chorus]
Revealing all their darkest crimes
(Destroy the hush)
Exposing truth through the other side
(Destroy the hush)
With strength one day we will collide
(Destroy the hush)
And in so doing we will retrieve ourselves our lives
Destroy the hush!
Imagine a world free of fear
A world where your dreams can be real as envisioned
A world where you choose what to be
Not what they make you (a monitored slave)
Those dreams will soon disappear
If we don't progress and succeed in the stifling
Of government lies
Expose what they hide
And we will provide for the fate of manI am terrified of life, without all of you
You have defined who I am and what's inside and what I am made of
I know you've been pushed off to the side
Just hold on for one more night, I'll make things right, I'll make this right
I'm looking back on all the things I've left behind
The years are flying by and everyday I'm reminded of all that you should have
Things won't be the same, they won't be the same until you're back in my loving arms
This life doesn't mean anything without you
I'll give up it all for you
The more I try to remember what this life is meant to be
I can't lose sight of the things I need to fulfull my dreams
To fulfill my dreams
I am terrified of life, without all of you
You have defined who I am and what's inside and what I am made of
I know you've been pushed off to the side
Just hold on for one more night, I'll make things right, I'll make this right
When I lose all of my grip on reality you will always pull me back to my feet
Things won't be the same, they won't be the same until you're back in my loving armsSo much to live,
Yet the yearning for death,
Perpetual in my mind.
To end the pain.
I wait for time to show me my path,
The continuum or the end?
I see it so clearly it burns my eyes.
Into absolutes I fall.
No time left.
Realisation cuts off all pretence.
My dreams so rarely dreams,
Just messages of pain in my subconscious.
So tired of waking and screaming,
And my mind can only ever say no!
Every day,I watch the morning break,
Before entering into my nightmare of sleep.
I hope one day I may wake and smile.
A fool's hope...
A worthless dream....
[Lyrics-Greg,Summer 1994]
[Music-Greg,Summer/Autumn 1994]The moon
lets proudly glisten the warpaint
and spikes
the knights
they stand
over there
watching in the dark
are fearless
while they think
That could be
the last beautiful night.
Be willing to die and to kill
the swords, axes and shields
are shining dreadful in the moonlight
then they raise their fists and scream
their warcry
Furor Teutonicus
The horde blows the enemies
the swords are drilled into the bastard's bodies
axes chop off and split their heads
the battle was wonRelying on, a conscious you never had
Ignorant for the rage within
Feeling like, you're betraying yourself
The urge creeping right under your skin
This miry deception, it crazes you
Crestfallen, you are losing your way
Your blood, now it starts to boil again
But your disguise is not gonna fall
Now the time, has come to pay back
It's time to show them all
This miry deception, it crazes you
Crestfallen, you are losing your way
Becoming way too much, way too much for you
Sick of walking away
Oppressed carnal mayhem
Criticize the truth you dread
Forever living the lie
Enforced weakness misled
Reached the point of no return
Too late to turn the tide
Resurrect to inflict your pain on others
Being part of the master plan they can not hide
This miry deception, it crazes you
Crestfallen, you're losing your way
Becoming way too much, way too much for youSin of doubt
It exists and it grows
A glimpse of life
From somewhere deep within
Oh, I couldn't understand!
Is it anyone else?
Is somebody screaming?
Please help me!
I don't know that I am not dreaming
Welcome to my damnation!
Here it comes - the real me
I didn't know I could hear the answer
My mind is blank, I feel a drone
Alone at night but somehow
There is someone else
Another stranger me!
(Another stranger me)
That's when the ice will break away
I can't get out here anymore
'Cause my locked keys in the door
There's fear and anger
Hate and love
I must confess it's self hate
It's s[]!
It's s[]!
Still s[], call my laughter
It's s[]!
Just m[]!
It's s[]!
Call her laughter
If there's some way in
It soon will be over
Will burn out!
Souls and fate
We're in a room now
Give up your cruel invasion!
You're insane, I'll show you
I didn't know I could hear the answer
My mind is blank, I feel a drone
Alone at night but somehow
There is someone else
Another stranger me!
How long - Can't resist
Come and fall
A bolt of pain keeps ripping through my head
Oh I can take no more!
Don't tell anyone else!
I do not believe her!
She hates me!
Cloak my mind
She's a deciever...
I can feel cruel vibration
Would you like to meet me?
I didn't know I could hear the answer
My mind is blank, I feel a drone
Alone at night but somehow
There is someone else
Another stranger me!
Another stranger me!The longest battle I''ll never win. A scripture versed in the waning words of an already dead language. A vanity bearing unbearable exhaustion that prunes the heart and discolors the soul. My own worst enemy in which there is nowhere to run. The unabated decimation of self. Mine is sole witness to this never againTrees have dropped their leaves,
Clouds their waters
All this burden is killing me
Distance is covering your way,
Tears your memory
All this beauty is killing me
Oh, do you care,
I still feel for you
So aware,
What should be lost is there
I fear I will never find anyone
I know my greatest pain is yet to come
Will we find each other in the dark
My long lost loveI've always been a fan of the night life
'Cause it's the only life I had
Expressing my mind with paper and a pen playing my guitar
'Till my fingers bled on the carpet
Maybe I wasn't like all the normal kids
I was born just a little bit different
I tried to fit in, I got sick of it
I tried to fit in, I got sick of it
You say I'm just a loser in the background
I can never seem to get it right
But I'm learning my worth is more than your word
You told me I would back out, I would break down
I'm not even putting up a fight
But I'm learning my worth is more than your word
It wasn't easy being rejected by the thing I wanted so bad
To be accepted, to be wanted
To wake up and say this is gonna be a good day
Maybe I wasn't like all the normal kids
I was born just a little bit different
I tried to fit in, I got sick of it
I tried to fit in, I got sick of it
You say I'm just a loser in the background
I can never seem to get it right
But I'm learning my worth is more than your word
You told me I would back out, I would break down
I'm not even putting up a fight
But I'm learning my worth is more than your word
More than your word
I was born a little bit different
I was born a little bit different
I was born just a little bit different
I was born a little bit different
I was born a little bit different
You say I'm just a loser in the background
I can never seem to get it right
But I'm learning my worth is more than your word
You say I'm just a loser in the background
I can never seem to get it right
But I'm learning my worth is more than your word
You told me I would back out, I would break down
I'm not even putting up a fight
But I'm learning my worth is more than your word
I got sick of it
I got sick of it
I tried to fit in, I got sick of it
I tried to fit in, I got sick of itThere is always hope even when it seems very bad.
Far from the southern vulcanic sirens comes the hope through the winds...
Don't try to talk, don't even try to move
You are too weak to think, or try to pull it through
We are the good ones, and we surely know the way
To give you better words you could ever say
We know how you should live your life
Here are the details, you will see...
You must remember, you're nothing without us
Alone down there, you just don't have the guts
But with our help, you're the saint of the land
If you're in trouble, we give our helping hand
In our world there's no need to cry
'cos our spirit can live forever
With our trust, with our goodness, there's no need to die
It's the world of hypocrates
Believe in me there's no need to cry
'cos our spirit can live forever
With our trust, with our goodness, there's no need to die
It's the world of hypocratesA cherry sunset blossoms,
But we're not there to watch it fall,
On the vacant canvas, we should be waiting,
With our face down on the grass,
Staring till our eyes give way,
Let's paint this city black,
While the night's still young,
You,
This cherry sunset withers,
Our words as frail as paper,
A dawn I thought we'd never see,
Alone on this silent beach,
Nothing we can do,
There is nothing we can do,
The sky, it burns itself,
The sky, it burns itself,
The sky, it burns itself out,
The sky, it burns itself,
The trees rot down to nothing,
Throats dry out and corpses fill the sidewalks,
These promenades our graveyards,
The sky, it burns itself out,
The sky, it burns itself out,
There is nothing we can do,
The sky, it burns itself,
And I think we're all about to fucking die,
The trees rot down to nothing,
Throats dry out, corpses fill these sidewalks,
These promenades our graveyards,
Kneeling down on what's left,
Sacrificed upon doom's day,
Oh, if we could take it back, and see one last twilight,
Take a picture, take a picture,
Take a picture, take a picture,
Take a picture,
Take a picture, take a picture,
Take a picture, take a picture,
It will last longer,
Our hands in prayer formation,
Our elbows on the bed,
One last try for Heaven,
Thinking who wants flowers when you're dead?
You're dead,
When you're dead,
Cherry, cherry,
Cherry, cherry,
Cherry, cherry,
Cherry, cherry,
Cherry,
A cherry sunsetAh, Hugh !
Show me the way to he hallways
below Rome, I will be there
I've seen them burning in fire
They all bear too much to bear
Why don't you think of all those who will come
Don't you waste your life
Don't you try show me the way
Don't need 'good advice'
Cold hallways so old, a chalice of gold
A guard as they say, paralyzed
Follow the cries from out of the blood
The wine in the cup
Out of the wine, out of the chalice of agony
Welcome to Avantasia
Out of the wine, out of the chalice of agony
Welcome to Avantasia
Regrin my friend we are passing the gate
Back into my world
I am afraid of the guard and I wish
Warnings had been heard
Welcome to Rome, it's our mission
to make tortured spirits free
Something's in here, oh I wish I could hide
from its staring eyes
Cold hallways so old, a chalice of gold
And I feel a chill
Staring eyes, while I hear the cries
From out of the blood, the wine in the cup
Out of the wine, out of the chalice of agony
Welcome to Avantasia
Out of the wine, out of the chalice of agony
Welcome to Avantasia
No way out, we got to run to the gate
No way out , for some of the souls it's too late
Jakob are you free
Out of the wine, out of the chalice of agony
Welcome to Avantasia
Out of the wine, out of the chalice of agony
Welcome to AvantasiaPenetrated by desire
Emptied by the masters fire
By-pass required - a burning shell
Access denied - exit hell
Turn around, face the lecher
Close the skin and bear the anger
Infiltrate your enemies
Give 'em pain and luxuries.
Licked by the tongues of pride
I shall forever walk inside
Kissed by the lips of insanity
I shall die eternally.
Surround the icons, burn 'em down
And magnetize emperor's crown
Devour the dust of bible - lines
Live 1000 years in suicide mines
Kingdom's painted bitter black
Fear the serpent in your neck
Summon the golden wine of sun
Drink the sky when time has come
Licked by the tongues of pride
I shall forever walk inside
Kissed by the lips of insanity
I shall die eternally.Torsos hang from their own intestines
Raped of all bodily extentions, stumps wreathing in a sludge
Like infection
Suffering through a Rancid amputation
A pulsating artery accomanied by some veins, slit with no restraint
Sacs of pus develop
My muscles tighten as I feel the rush
I look at your body starting gush
I slice through the limb,
a human dissection portions of half-eaten flesh in my mouth
starting to chew your now bleeding stump
I will swallow your pus your own rectal slime
I'll force you to drink
Vessels explode as needles injected
Uncontrollable
My brain tormented
Slit from head to toe, die through the torture
Disease engulfs you
Internal rot
Fresh cut wounds, beginning to clot
Ripping through flesh is what I do best
Tear off an arm
Amputated neck
Eyes removed, cranium smashed
Decomposing remains, severed in half
Dying slowly never to rest, nerves are quivering as I trip
Removal of life on the blade of my knife
Inserted in your spine, smashing through bone
Feel my hell, I feed on fright
Rape the limbless cadaverExtracting cruelty
From those who go unseen
From a heart of malice
Comes grave atrocity
Cold is the flesh that yearns for the sun
Lying in earth forgotten, rotten and gone
Oh crown desire
Your thorns once made me weep
Pain now inspires
These wounds so bitter sweet
Roses once teardrops now fall in her hand
Woo the forsaken wearing the crown of desire
Gods cannot be failing now
Whores cannot be caring now
Worlds seem to be crumbling down
Time cannot be running out
Rotten and gone
Yearn for the sun
Woo the forsaken
Desire has comeSomewhere beyond
In the dark there's a light
Taking my fears
And my dreams out of sight
Gives me the power
And the will to survive this fight
I've travelled for ages
In search of the truth
Thousand of pages
Have paid off their dues
But they can't tell
What i am longing for
And when the dawn of the victory
Is rising with dignity
And then i'll know where to go
Take me away
Into infinity
I just can't stay
Realese my tragedy
And i swear
That i'll take more than i can bear
So take me away
Deep down my soul
There's a fire that burns
I won't hesitate
I'll always return
surrendering all of the duties
That i was chosen for
I've conquered it all
And so what is the price
I bag for delieverence
Now that i'm wise
Why don't you ease my pain
And free my soul
So i'm laying my weapons down
Do i deserve the crown
Cause i'm here to take my place
Take me awayBloodshot eyes and a dead beat stance
Shit for brains I'm a game of change
One cut, two cut counting scars
Three cut horns up behind the bars
I'm not your patron saint
I'm not your patron saint
Horns up or down and now horns up
I am your warpaint
You're not my angel dear
You're not my angel dear
Lets make this crystal clear
Horns up I am your worst fear
It's not the cough that carries me off
It's the motherfucking coffin they carry me off in
It's not the cough that carries you off

[screaming part]
two minutes [screaming at end]A dusted bone, taste in my throat
Skin pulled tight all 'round my eyes
Trapped inside living that lie, I've been sold
Your stick in my eye, thorn in my side
Hunger owns
I've been told not that road
I've been flatlined my life goes cold
Come first light I'll be gone
A cold colored blue just for you
Trapped inside living that lie, I've been sold
I've been told not that road
I've been flatlined my life goes cold
Life goes cold
I've been told not that road
I've been flatlined my life goes coldPlead
To be released in your void,
Which has consumed
Us far too many times before.
We promised ourselves
That we wouldn't succumb
To the dissonance.
This fractured state, has
Engulfed, our, sense of,
Worth
Beg
So polished,you're
Gleaming with light.
Too tempting,
Resisting with all our might.
Blinded soul
On a misguided flight.
Silence the, demons lethal appetite.
Seeking refuge from this
Burden which has all but,
Torn and worn us to shreds.
This blinding conclusion,
Has diverted the inevitable.
Guiding us back to you.
Focus on the pain,
Our only fragment of reality.
Wade through this disdain,
The only sanctity we've ever contained.
Worship your demons,let
Them mold and guide you.
Worship your demons, but
Do not let them inside you.
Worship your demons,let
Them mold and calm you.
Worship your demons but,
Do not let them control you.
This fractured state, has
Engulfed, our, sens of,
Worth
BEGWhy do people sell their souls away
Just to ride the horse another day
They're all slaves to the heroin
But it's a war they'll never win
They'll never live to see the error of their ways
One foot in the grave
Ruled by the drugs they crave
It all began as a need for kicks
Now they'd sell their lives for a fix
Powerless to break those chains
There's only losses and there's never no gains
They only live and die as a slave
With one foot, one foot in the grave
It promised an escape but only lied
Master of the world they're trapped inside
The needle and the spoon only gave
A one - way ticket leading to the grave
And suffering until the day they dieThere goes the neighborhood.
Here come them fuckin' niggas
With their fancy cars.
Who gave them fuckin' niggas
Those rock guitars?
Who let 'em in the club?
Did you make 'em pay?
Who let 'em on the stage?
Whose lettin' 'em play?
Don't they know rock's just for whites
Don't they know the rules?
Those niggas are too hard core
This shit ain't cool.
Those blacks want everything
In the fuckin' world
That nigga plays so good
He took my muthafuckin' girl
There goes the neighborhood.
There goes the neighborhoooooood,

Da, Da, Da, Da, Da
We're here,
We ain't goin' nowhere.
We're movin' right next door to you,
Body Count, muthafucka.
And those of you that don't like it
Can suck, my muthafuckin' dick, ha, ha, ha, ha.

That nigga plays so good,
He took my muthafuckin' girl.
There goes the neighborhood
There, there, there, there goes the neighborhood.He accompanies me through wind and rain
When I'm in agony and pain
He warns me for the change, the change of tide
And tells me when and where to hide
When I was born along came he
When I arose he came alive in me
But only I was recognized
Vivid in their dream
No one saw him gleam
How selective they wish to perceive
In the lie, they want to believe
The trees blossom acknowledged
The roots denied
Because if he'd be noticed
They'd tremble, terrified
Why not speak of him freely?
Of the one hushed so ruthlessly?
He who offers the ultimate escape
Out of this treacherous world full rapeForces of hate meet
Gather for the siege
Encircling their foe
The raid begins
Their revenge is sought
Through violence, smashing, killing, stabbing, pounding
Iron weapons clash
Evil warriors strike
Hammers cracking skulls
Axes chopping heads
Their revenge is now
Through violence, crushing, maiming, hacking, pounding
Blood soaks the ground
In their own, they will drown
Surrounded by disgust
Pounded into dust
Battle rages on
Bleeding wounded scream
Clubs shatter bones
Swords sever limbs
Their blind rage compells
Their frenzy, bloodlust, madness, burning, hatred
Berzerkers overwhelm
Defenders run in fear
No prisoners today
The end is near
Their blind age endless
No mercy lay waste, wipe out, kill them, kill them
Their struggle to defend
The attack will never end
Surrounded by disgust
Pounded into dust
The captured will be crucified as a warning to the rest
When the killing is completed the city will be burned
Their way of life will be destroyed, no trace of them remains
Annihilate
They lay waste
Eradicate
Victory for their hatred, fury, raging, pounding
Blood soaks the ground
In their own, they will drown
Surrounded by disgust
Pounded into dustAllah, Buddha, Jesus Christ
Whatever your god may be
Forget those idols let me tell you
They're tales of morbid brains
Everybody thinks he's right
That his gods are the only truth
Fanatic faith, fanatic deeds
Join my religion or die
Jews killed Jesus, Christs slaughtered Jews
Millions die for their faith
Each religion prays that killing is a sin
How stupid logic can be
Curse the gods
Too many people have died
Curse the gods
That fools have died for a lie
Beware of those fools that keep telling you
God loves you, for you his son died
Fuck them- believe in yourself
Gods reality is just a lie
Curse the gods
Too many people have died
Curse the gods
That fools have died for a lieThis is your ambition, your vision
You don't back from your position
You enquire, you desire, play to win
There can be only one
Every hill feels unclimbable
But the power of will can defeat anything, you're unbreakable
It's the moment you choose that you never can lose throwing caution straight to the wind
You will rise to your best when you're put to the test, you're unchainable
There can be only
One way, one life, one chance to make it all count
Show you're fearless, let them hear you roar
The roar of the underdog
This is here, this is the now
This is the chance to make it all count
Show you're fearless, let them hear you roar
The roar of the underdog
This is my revolution, my collusion
I will stand for my intrusion
My agenda won't surrender
The will of stone is solid to the bone
Every step feels untakeable
But the fire within can transcend anything, I'm unquenchable
If you step to the side you will never get by in a world that runs over you
I will rise to my best when I'm put to the test, I'm unbreakable
There can be only
One way, one life, one chance to make it all count
Show you're fearless, let them hear you roar
The roar of the underdog
This is here, this is the now
This is the chance to make it all count
Show you're fearless, let them hear you roar
The roar of the underdogThe pressure is endless
The tension is pounding
Life change after life change
It's too much for me to take
While mourning the loss I am forced to celebrate
Celebrate new life, celebrate new life
When is it too much?
When is it enough?
Burrow deep down inside
Somewhere, anywhere, a place to hide
I'm collapsed, about to burn
This will end me, set me ablaze
I'm collapsed, about to burn
I am about to explode
I can't take much more of this
Where is my way out?
Waiting for this page to turn
I can't even bear the silence
Where is the ringing in my ears to sing me to sleep?
Where are those who feel what I feel?
Why can't I see the lights shining down on me?
Home will always be where my heart lives
But this is, this is my way out
This is our home away from home
Pouring our hearts across the stage
With every word, we sing together
Screaming our anthem with one another
The open road is what I need to breathe freely
Free me
The open road is what I need to breathe freely
Free me
Free me
Free me
Free me
Free meI bow down your precious icon, deity of self suppression
This effigy of flesh, corporeal Christi, nailed
In submission to this false idol, seeking deliverance
From this spiritual hierarchy, downward spiralling, a corrupt throne
Of repression and guilt
Our will be done
Thy kingdom burn
On my knees, before this tormented flesh, in irreverence
In communion with this parasitic host of virtuous divinity
This imperious creed bears testament to the failures of our morality
Righteous durance is our cross we bear in stations
In stations of the lost
Our will be done
Thy kingdom burn, thy kingdom burn
Our will be done
From your knees arise
By your own hand, your god you scribe
The earth shall inherit the meek
Your god is dead
Bound down, in God we're trussed, foul stature
Icons embodied in flesh, we nail
In servitude to deities fashioned in our self image
Shadows of eternal strife cast by those who serve
Serve a crown of pawnsFrom beyond the multitude of stars
Arktos ouros- lotus petals unfurled
Portal to the vault of sun and lightning
Zeta Ursa Majoris- arms outstretched
Wheel to the chariot of the nightsky
Gammadion give us our strength- begotten
Through blood and flame
In iron embrace
The prophesied sign in the heavens
A balance of firebolts and solar virtues
The glyph of creation- father of all
The Phoenix purifies- ashes to the wind
Cleaves through the darkness of matter
Hail the death defiant- Vindex arise!
Begotten
Pregnant lightning shatters frozen joy
Foul frost creates from that which destroys
In iron embrace
Through blood and flame
Yet the memories endure
Of the final Avatara
Through the flames of the great end
Where lightning rains from the heavens
And glory wakes to walk proud
Through rites ripe with blood and faith
Upon inviolate mountain peaks
Where shines the rising sun
Begotten (through blood and flame)
In iron embrace
BegottenThis is the end of the journey amongst us
You've seen the craziest dreams and lived your worst nightmares
Is there anything left you have to sacrifice?
After all that we've been through, is there anything worth leaving?
Welcome to your nightmare
Vision obstructed
Pestilence could become your confidante
Your confidante
Now i see the light
Enlightening my heart
Can you feel the peace once again?
Like a newborn child
Like a new soul coming to this world
I awake in this darkened room once again
And i realize that the call from the city was yours
We shed the same innocent blood through all these years
I hope to see the light once again before we are taken awayA demon in my blood
In a dark crimson urge
Chained down like a dog
The thirst is my curse
Out for blood - Out for blood
We prowl the streets at night
Blood hot - Heart cold
In the shadows we await
To feast upon your soul
Out for blood - Out for blood
We only come out at night
To drain you of your life
Undead horror alive
Pulling the trigger inside
A demon in my blood
In a dark, crimson urge
Chained down like a dog
The thirts is my curse
Out of blood - Out for blood
We only come out at night
To dfrain you of your life
Undead horror alive
Pulling the trigger inside
We only come out at night
To dfrain you of your life
Undead horror alive
Pulling the trigger inside
Out for blood - Out for you
I want blood - I want you
Out for blood - Out for you
I want blood - I want youImprinted on us all
Manifests to break the will
As a hammer to the skull
Resist reprisal of no consequence
Finite existence dust and ashes (Remain)
Corrosive pathos
Now drowning in the wake
Unafraid to face the truth
No fate but what we make
(2x)
Resist reprisal of no consequence
Finite existence dust and ashes (Remain)"I hate you, it's your fault
my life's messed up
I don't care what you say,
my way's right.
where's your proof that
anarchy just won't work?"
but Jesus Christ has the plan for you
go your way
what's the cost
(chorus)
rebellion (x4)
"my heart's black - apathy I'm so cold"
change the world - let's unite humanity
narrow minded - you call us
we're just fools
God will use the foolish things
to confound the wise
to show you that he's right
(chorus)Requiem...
Requiem (to you)...Wolves beset this fallen church of blasphemy
Orgies in blood shall deflorate its purity
Defecate on the liars book of sick belief
No one shall be saved, the way to hell has here been paved
A din of stained glass fragments
Cut your flesh to the bone
Baptized in black blood
Hymen breached with a cross
Children of your lord
Semen peppers their faces
We seek to distort
Our kingdom shall come
Rise, the dead burst forth from ancient tombs
The steaming bowels of seraphs violently strewn
Hell is here, sermons backwards preach death and doom
Flagellate and rape, blood let the pilgrims of their faith
Drain them of their sanctity
Perpetuate their tragedy
Infect them with all our disease
Mock his altar of deceit
With hell reborn
Your Christ be scorned
Diabolic ritual open the portal to damnation
Dark legions gathering for virtuous insemination
Molest and sodomize deride the seed of god's creation
Impale the Nazarene succumb to a spiritual inversion
In our unholy fathers disgusting house of shame
We revel in endless hatred burning so absolute
Corrupting all who'd enter here surrender to darkness
We kneel to those no more who'd burden and beguilt
Within these wretched walls a summoning proceeds
What form will manifest of this abysmal devilry
The children now are bleeding, we eunuchate his sons
To evil blood and fire this earth will soon succumb
With hell reborn
Your Christ be scorned
Dead faith now torn
His love deformedIn the year 1999, and seven months
From the sky shall come the great King of Terror!
Attack!
Burning skies, devastation, the time has come
The true face of Satan... a terrible storm of fire!
A monster of power and energy!
Total release of the starving anger
Rising across the world
On wings of death the, fed on famine
The Apocalypse unleashed
1999 - Revolution 666
1999 - Revolution 666
The year 2000 marks the new beginning
Must tear down to recreate
The death of the old is the birth of the new
It can't go on like this forever
Something must happen! Something must die!
Unity and pride, strength in numbers
Nothing to lose but the chains that bind us
Raise our fists and rise against
Awakening of the beast inside
1999 - Revolution 666
1999 - Revolution... Blood shall flow!
Ahahaha! And your pretty world is going to Hell!
Welcome to Planet Satan!
Let the madness begin!
Let the damage be done!
Mindless massfucking chaos!
I say "Fuck peace, start the fight, drop the big one baby!"
Yeah... Hell is here! Welcome it without fear!
War raining death, to kill society!
This is not a dream, open the doors!
A big fuck-off finger and a devil's sign to this lying world of shit!
It means nothing to me...
And I've got this feeling that the bastards gotta pay!
Kill!
'Non-serviam'... I shall not serve!
"Do what thou wilt" shall be the whole of the law!
No limit, the law!
And, oh, I'm hating you, like I've always hated you
You have no right to put me in your cage!
1999 - Revolution 666
1999 - Revolution... This is it!
1999 - Revolution 666
1999 - Revolution... Crush the shit!
Destroy, destroy, destroy!
Destroy, destroy, destroy!
Destroy, destroy, destroy!
Destroy, destroy, destroy!
Destroy [x7]
We shall destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy!!
Create the end!So typical, so ritual*
My sweetest memories lost in time.
Twisted and forgotten I'm searching for what everyone seems to find.
So typical, so ritual.
Twisted and forgotten I'm searching for what everyone seems to find.
The past is the present and the future's just more absence.
I'm body without blood.
I'm digging a grave just for one.
This is a heart without a pulse and my inner demons won.
Somehow I knew I'd never see that second life.
Somehow I knew I'd die empty inside.
I should have been a liar because I've got a lot to hide.
I should have ate your heart because I can't feel mine.
I should have been a liar because I've got a lot to hide.
I should have ate your heart because I can't feel mine.
I should have ate your heart because I can't feel mine.
The next time we meet you'll have to tell my heart to beat.
The next time we meet you'll have to tell me to breath.
Sewing your mouth shut, I promise this is better for both of us.
No more tasting the past in the back of my throat, just a coffin full of lies and a preacher spewing one sick joke.
So typical, so ritual.
Twisted and forgotten I'm searching for what everyone seems to find.
I should have ate your heart because I can't feel mine.
I should have ate your heart.Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labeled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep my friend and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says Rage
Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Build my fear of what's out there
And cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?
No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell
Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Fear of living on natives getting
Restless now, mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way for reaching out againThis journey without movement
Heading out for no man's land
The way ahead my only ally
Early hours, in the silence
This credence keeps me upright
Through the storms and disasters
A straight line towards the unknown end
Deceit waits on the back roads
This unwavering inner
Keeps fear a welcomed pointer
I uprooted now, the fertile soil
As plot and shadows thicken
This juggernaut cannot be stopped
On any scale or planet
Ghostly tracks in my wake and ahead
An experience, cannot be shared
Wheels of time
Keep them turning
Carriage of concepts
Wheels of time turn
Circling the planes
Wheels of time
Keep them turning
Carriage of concepts
Wheels of time turn
Circling the planes
Light-less voyage, blinding speeds
Certain, I'll stay the distance
Abstract shapes, enigmatic design
I know enough to endure
Light-less corridors, ageless
Familiar alien
Contradictory engines run high
Deeper and further above
Journey of no promises
Beyond the lust for rewards
Focus on the movement of the wheel
Union of stillness and change
Journey of the ages all
I'll follow outside the edge
Breath, blood, sacrifice bleeding eyes
Unending journey ahead
Wheels of time
Keep them turning
Carriage of concepts
Wheels of time turn
Circling the planesCut out this eye, look inside yourself.
Find what you've become inside a maze of hate.
Search for yourself deep.
Your consciousness lost inside a broken mind.
One more chance to live.
Our condition makes us whole, makes us one, forever in honour.
Break out of here. Fight another day.
This adrenaline inside such tired veins.
Rage courses though my mind.
Legions of fear tear across my skin.
Break the enemy.
Cut the noose, fall on down to the trap door.Poets racking absinthed brains
Could never fully paint these nights
No martyr parting from his pain
Could utter words so erudite
As those she now divulged to me
In throes of passions grip
Indulging latent fantasies
That ran forked tongues along the lip
Of fate's pudenda
The twisted snake's agenda
Now the world would bend
To her deadly legacy
Life's graveyard was waiting, such dizzying flight
From the convent at All Hallows Fair
Without contemplating, we fled through the night
Too blood-drunk and cunt-sated to care
The Goddess had spoken
And woken desire
It crackled in the air around us
A psychic force shimmering like fire
And on her breasts. that old necklace
The one I snuck from the fucked Abbess
Whose dirty little secret, other than me
Now shone with bold intensity
Vast the power it possessed
The darkness Brought to living flesh
This treasure was ancient, taken by force
From an elite caste of priests in Delphi
The Templars were patient, they stayed out the course
Then fleeced their Greek hosts in their sleep
That necklace traversed
Vile murders and miles worse
But what was a curse
To this perverse demoness?
Legend swore it was a gift of malice
For the maiden Harmonia
The illegitimate spawn of love arid war
Jealousy made it gleam for her
For with it clasped, her looking glass
Was ever beautiful and young
But disaster choked her royal caste
And every throat on which it hung
There madness, death and horror clung
Immortalised in mortal guise
She was a sight for blighted eyes
A plague to gladly plagiarize
And spread like red excited kisses
She was more than me
More than wards
Could fulfill in the parlance of the angels
She cast a spell on every cell
In my nobody
She gave me back my tongue
That she might run it on herself
She was Lilith. she was light
I was but a parasite
Beckoned to temptation
In her velvet overtones
Through frozen antics, dressed in white
She led me into paradise
Neath comets in ovation
Like the Queen of winter, throned...
Pleasures archetypal
Then much rarer agonies
I was a sworn disciple
Of her whims and dark decrees
In Europe's hair
Her spies were everywhere
A sylph amongst the filthy rich and debonair
Her greater plan
All chaos and the all of man
For as she fed dark appetites
She bred her children there
The spawn of love and war
Presiding over Hellfire clubs
Arch-masons and Agharta
The spawn of love and war
She rode the beast. her legs apart
A blazing pyre starter
Life's playground elated, such dizzying sights
And sensations ignited her grin
As slaves celebrated her Satanic rites
We climbed up to heaven in sin
She came to me
As she will come to You
Intoxicating in her seduction
Her siren sway. devastating voodoo
Persistent, resistance is useless, fool
To this Goddess, in lust she's cruel
Beyond any measure, her pleasures will found
A perverted Eden on sacred ground
Vast the power I caressed
The darkness brought to vivid flesh
And in it she now rules a cowered universeAs if in a dream
Only one man
Can know
He tastes the dirt
He chews the dirt
The dirt
The filth
Now swallow
The filth of it
Cold sweat
Runs down slow
Just choke
The filth of it
Now swallow
Mixed withhot tastes of blood
And the cold taste of defeat
I want to die
Just one more time
Roll over and die
White lights mad and MANIACAL
Seep out dark brick walls
You
Just shun heavens thunder
While laughing at the sky
With a hiss of the nightmare's downpour
Laughing at the sky
Now wake up and... DIE
Just one more time
As if in a dream
Only one more time
I must dieO Satan, prends piti de ma longe misre !
Oh Thou, the most savage of angels
God only judges mild
Those who chant songs to his praise
Oh Prince of exile...
To whom in every tale done wrong
(but who) after defeat, always redresses more strong
Like a patron saint of
Heavens rejected souls
Distinctively closer to
Humanity Thou art
Connected to
Mother earth more profound
Oh Thou fallen angel of gloom, joyfully I join thy side
Even if this means eternal fire, I embrace thy kingdom of night
Exile, exile!!!!!
Wandering in Thy wastelands
Far away from the heavenly autocrat
Close to Thee I chose to repose
Liberated from God's wrath
Exile!!!
A temple raised for the ones like us
With plentiful room for science
A shelter for creative minds
To dream away in silence...
Oh Thou fallen angel of gloom, joyfully I join thy side
Even if this means eternal fire, I embrace thy kingdom of nightA sudden gasp for life, will this be our last?
Will we sit back and watch fate destroy us?
Come and take my hand, we can ride off
And watch the world die as we breathe our last breath
[Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible]
The darkened skies are now falling overhead
Will this be the end or just another dream?
Angels falling from burning skies
Hell has opened up its doors for us
Dying world
Dying world
Now can you feel the end?
Now can you see the end?
Now do you want the end?
Now do you think your God cares?
A mass suicide for all, all mankind
This is all our fault, no one will be saved
Time is running thin as I look towards the skies
I see now that this is truly the end
A mass suicide for all, all mankind
This is all our fault, no one will be saved
Time is running thin as I look towards the skies
I see now that this is truly the end
A mass suicide for all mankind
This is all our fault, no one will be saved
Time is running thin as I look towards the skies
I see now, this is the endDo you remember the 21st night of September?
Love was changing the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away
Our hearts were ringing
In the key that our souls were singing.
As we danced in the night,
Remember how the stars stole the night away
Ba de ya, say do you remember
Ba de ya, dancing in September
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day
My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love,
Remember how we knew love was here to stay
Now December found the love that we shared in September.
Only blue talk and love,
Remember the true love we share today
Ba de ya, say do you remember
Ba de ya, dancing in September
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day
Ba de ya, say do you remember
Ba de ya, dancing in September
Ba de ya, golden dreams were shiny days
Ba de ya de ya de ya
Ba de ya de ya de ya
Ba de ya de ya de ya de ya
Ba de ya de ya de ya
Ba de ya de ya de ya
Ba de ya de ya de ya de yaMy tears were flowing down to the ground
A sad stream of silver is a mournin' man's gold
And where the seeds of sorrow soon were found
A flower of light, the omen saw the world
[Chorus]
Step into the dreams of wonder
Open up the gates of wonder
Stare into the face of wonder
Free yourself from the spell you're under now!!!
I blessed the sign yes my prayers were heard
I laughed as I watched that tiny thing grow
Over the rainbow and up to the stars
A tower of dreams, waiting to come true
[Chorus]
I saw this divine gate between the worlds
Waiting for me to take away my soul
I was no longer what I was before
A chosen one that opened up the door
[Chorus]This is the last time...
The last time I watch the sun rise to blind my eyes
Tonight the dark sky is my roof
And all misty fields my floor
I have found my place to be
By your side; in your arms
You're my bride - I'll die for you
Eosophobic wedlock - forever by your side
I won live to bid you farwell
You're the embodied core of darkness
Pure beauty dressed in black
I feel you are a part of me
Thus I a part of you
Never again shall the light of the day
Come between us and tear us apart
You're the heart of night
And now my heart is yours
Seductive Noctil'uca
Your eyes have never seen the sunWelcome
this transmission
from a fallen star
otherwise known as Arcturus
Light has departed
from this black sun
But please put us on
to bring darkness down
from your head and home
Our enterprise a success
as return is no option
our eyes were removed
for our own safety
The distance too great
for you to hear our cries
nevermind take this lamp
we are beyond light
We learned so little
of inhuman culture
before disappearance
went right through us
The mothership
boarded by fools
we escape space
in order to reach
our destination
And if you are listening
please tell us about the time
where and when we exist
no more
For when you go
we go with you
via wormholesDeep shadows above the black-blue sea,
The eyes of the storm are watching me
A murderous silence is gasping for air
Dark clouds are resting, can't flee
I see my breath, it's cold and clear
My eyes show emptiness, not fear
I feel the hungry sea around
I slip into the muddy ground
(This muddy street)
The silence is like a brother to me
It gives me sense behind my mind
I feel the hands of silence and peace
Salvation makes me blind[Music and lyrics by Marco Kehren/Deinonychus]
The search for so many centuries has become
A throne on my long awaited desires, that made
me strong
Through the years of suffering I became one of
the black
All those who tried to stop me never came back
The souls of defenceless beauties, the ones
who pleaded
I carved their flesh, drank their blood, I am
God!
A throne on my long awaited desires
The flame I held high, heaven's cry!
Now the time has come to reveal
The real God, the real prophet
In my darkest time
God prepare to meet me: to the death
After the glorious battle of unholiness
The throne was mine
I look to the angels, the unblessed
As I crowned myself
I held up high the blaze of eternal doom
Looking into the eyes of the dyig angel
I said I am God!!!
A throne on my long awaited desires
Forever I will rule...When I'm alone, and thinkin' of death
Thinkin' about the world and when it will end
Thinkin' of what is accepted and accepted as true
They're all just fuckin' lies!
AWARE! BEWARE! WAR! The war that is so come
The beast in man has been caged far too long
No longer are we the wild wolves of old
The cross has taken our talons and taken our soul
The Eternal Glory Of War
This song is a stab to the hearts
Of those who would have us feel guilty for our past
Fuck all this remorse and fuckin' regret
They are a curse and a disease of Christianity that leads to our death
HAIL! Those who would give us hope
HAIL! Those who have seen beyond the dawn
HAIL! To those who have fought and won our wars
HAIL! To those who have kept the fire burning
The Eternal Glory Of War
The spirit of the War-dead cal out our name
They call us to remember and rekindle the flames
The spirit of the War-dead never died
They live on in our hearts through Spirit and Pride
The spirit of the War-dead are your ancestors tool
There is no shame in who and what we are
Look within and find out who you are
The Eternal Glory Of War
And it seems the Winds of change are upon us again
The tides have risen and the seas are black
It seems we're here to bear witness to the world on its knees at its death
But have no fear for the world ends for us all in the end!
War and Death, Inevitable!
Liars, cheats, cunts and fuckin' whores
I want you all against the fuckin' wall
You are traitors to everything that was ever yours
There's nothing left for this world but war
The Eternal Glory Of WarExtravasated hemoglobular vitality
Vascular death, hematological finale
The postmortem settling of blood called lividity
A fascinating aspect of PMI morbidity...
Capillary beds...
Are sodden red...
Coagulants unglued...
Bruised black and blue...
Hypostasis, fixed and bruised
Blanched extremities a purplish hue
Sticky quagmire of darkened goo
The cadaver's posterior grumously imbrued...
Paludal mess...
Blood-tattoo compress...
Maroon patterns in flesh...
Rot's cruel caress...
The unmistakable gravitational pull after the
cessation of breath
The tiny red blood cells separate from plasma and sink
Clotting inside the lower recesses until the decedent
stinks...
Arteries leak...
Veins deplete...
Blood secretes...
Marinating meat...So still I remain beneath the stars. Their transient majesty blankets the sullen. The sound of the complacent tranquility whispers into my deafened ears. How fragile and taciturn, the breath of the night; a disturbance amongst us in the wake of my stir. My rest will in frustration wait as I have promised to shepherd my brothers. Beneath obsidian skies, I am compelled only through stubborn nature. I think only to harbor this adulation that in flames of passion or war will never burn. The discordant winds of war, its acrid scent stinging my eyes, can never blind the love I possess. And in silence have I sworn to remain ardent and impassioned. And may no enemy encircling lay hands upon that which I so feverishly love. I shall never abandon you, so speak not a word not another word. I'll be right here by your side. Though the burdened crown of weight upon weakened column shall end, I with dying breath have appeased this macerating creation by human hands. Oh how glorious the silence, all iniquities bereaved as it descends to Earth on this most shameless of evenings. I will never know another night to be the same. May the resonating word of the memory burn brighter than the spirit of my youth; that I perished the last of vitality so that others may persist so that my brothers may live on.Different, Indifferent
No will to change
Destructive, negative
Life runs insane
Pessimist, nihilist
Live against life
Senseless, useless
Comedy of strife
[Chorus]
Low life still alive
And low life still a life
But even worse
Heresy, blasphemy
Do I need god?
Misery, disease
He needs me not
Breathing, feeling
Chaos above
Morbid, sordid
Manic void
[chorus]
Torture, torment
Tearing me apart
Hatred, Rage
A rotten heart
Repressive, aggressive
Walls of human flesh
Terminal criminal
Artist of death
[chorus]Wings of butterfly inside
My spirit revives, I feel
The horizon is widening the circle
My destiny is in the clouds
The Stone Pilgrim kneels
Carving his way
One grind of sand
Every night and every day
I believe the Eternity lasts
In unreal ocean
Which is prevading us
Mixing the colours of epochs
Hearing the whispers of silence
Over the roofs of his town
I want to restrain the time
Love is a dance of butterfly
The Stone Pilgrim kneels
Carving his way
One grind of sand
Every night and every day
I believe the Eternity lasts
In unreal ocean
Which is prevading us
Mixing the colours of epochsA contribution made
A man-made self brigade
An imposition of that's dwelled
And hospitality far from reality
Casts neglecting yourself
And in the process of these lies
Heroes never live, legends never die
Preserve one's self, in safety for growth
Preserve one's self
Preserve one's self, in safety for growth
Preserve one's self
Finding strength in yourself
A massacre of your dignity
A fortune for someone else
Inspired by insufficiency
Interrogation and hypocrisy
Inspired by insufficiency
Interrogation and hypocrisy
And in the process of these lies
Heroes never live, legends never die
A masquerade
A disposition of everything that you believe
A front put for success
Only one could see
Only one can see
Preserve one's self in safety for growth
Preserve one's self in safety for growth
Preserve one's self in safety for growth
Preserve one's self in safety for growth
Why kill a dream?
Why kill a dream?
Feed off the weakness of your kind
Feed off the weakness for your primeSlowly slicing your body
Wondering what's inside
A psychopath addicted to flesh
Now I'm taking your life
Hacking through your organs
Constantly watching your eyes
I gotta see in your mind
What happens when you die
Bleed for me
Let me see you suffer
Die for me
I love to hear you scream
Dreaming of a death so violent
Sanity is Draining from me
I'm forced to murder and slaughter
From the visions inside my head[lyrics: E. Holopainen]
[music: T. Koivusaari & E. Holopainen]
As the sun falls down
and the swell crashes into the shore
The great warriors of doom and wind
ride high
Silent is the silence,
the only breathing of horses sound,
Cold northern steel, shining blade, pleases us
And we all live under the black mark
Oh lord, lead us to the paradise
My lord, is this the promised land
is this your gift
Let us fly into your dreams
Let us taste some blood
Sorrow - the unknown force
Hate - respect your enemy
Bitterness - shall be forever
Silence - nothing left
Let us fly into your dreams
Let us taste some blood[English Version]
Outside the barracks, by the corner light,
I'll always stand and wait for you at night,
we will create a world for two,
I'll wait for you the whole night through,
for you, Lili Marleen,
for you, Lili Marleen.
Bugle tonight don't play the call to arms,
I want another evening with her charms,
then we will say goodbye and part,
I'll always keep you in my heart,
with me, Lili Marleen,
with me, Lili Marleen.
Give me a rose to show how much you care,
tie to the stem a lock of golden hair,
surely tomorrow you'll feel blue,
but then will come a love that's new,
for you, Lili Marleen,
for you, Lili Marleen.
When we are marching in the mud and cold,
and when my pack seems more than I can hold,
my love for you renews my might,
I'm warm again, my pack is light,
it's you, Lili Marleen,
it's you, Lili Marleen.
[German Version]
Vor der Kaserne vor dem grossen Tor
Stand eine Laterne und steht sie noch davor
Dort wollen wir uns wiedersehn
Bei der Laterne woll'n wir steh'n
Wie einst Lili Marleen
Wie einst Lili Marleen
Uns're beiden Schatten sah'n wie einer aus
Dass wir lieb uns hatten dass sah man gleich daraus
Und alle Leute soll'n es sehn
Wenn wir bei der Laterne steh'n
Wie einst Lili Marleen
Wie einst Lili Marleen
Deine Schritte kennt sie, deinen schnen Gang
Alle Abend brennt sie doch mich vergass sie lang
Und sollte mir ein Leid gescheh'n
Wer wird bei der Laterne steh'n
Mit dir Lili Marleen
Mit dir Lili Marleen
Mit dir Lili Marleen
Mit dir Lili Marleen
Aus dem stillen Raume, aus der Erde Grund
Hebt sich wie im Traume dein verliebter Mund
Wenn sich die spten Nebel dreh'n
Wer wird bei der Laterne steh'n
Mit dir Lili Marleen
Mit dir Lili Marleen
Wenn sich die spten Nebel dreh'n
Wer wird bei der Laterne steh'n
Mit dir Lili Marleen
Mit dir Lili MarleenYou don't refuse the new ideas
But close them into a ghetto
Put chains to the open-minded
Give free way to the terror
Mechanical humanoid nation
Is the solution to your problems
Kill my soul, kill my mind, kill my
Feelings to stop my resistance
I'm not a part of your program
I'm gonna be the error in the system
I won't be a part of your program
I'm gonna be the error in the system
Machines won't fight against you
More technology than human
Put gun in the hand of killers
They want fight so show them where they can[Instrumental][El Da Sensai]

[Tame One]
Well as I step up, my fuckin reps up, and snappin quicker
I'm slicker than a zipper, get more wet than Flipper
Got trunks and crates, full of P-Funk breaks
I'll take Bootsy make a loop and you get souped because I'm great
With the four bar sample, add a bass and kick
You're on my dick for my tricks, when I fix the remix
I twist this disc with emphasis, since
dead presidents took residence, from dollars and cents
I got pull like Magneto rollin cee-lo with steel dice
My black book make, more people petrol than Heidi Floess
I'm nice on mic jacks, and murder to a dub deck
The Knotty Headed ruffneck, Tame don't give a fuck yet
I jump up the funk to smoke the blunt that's like a tree trunk
I get blitt, to rip shit, still piss and call MC's punks
My knotty throwin body blows like ?
The trooper's gettin zooted off the funky herbal buddha
Don't test me, press or even stress to try to serve me
Cause I'm down and dirty from the undergrounds of Jersey
Word to Fats daddy cause I'm fatter than your Timberlands
Ladies and gentlemen, Tame got more balls than Wimbledon
So step up and get your fronts cracked
by the blunt crackin rapper, and get your bitch before I smack her
Chorus: Artifacts

Watch your back look over your shoulder, I'm bout to roll you over
with a bulldozer, get on the CB one rover
Cause I pulve-rize a, MC cause I'm nicer
Click click click, I hunt MC's like I'm the Predator
Don't think it's ? cause I kill like I'm a matador
Lyrics bust through my lips just like I sing a song
Jay got more flavor, than goya, adobo
I'm wreckin CD's and tapes, with "That's Them" logo
Keeps you jumpin like a pogo chicks are dancin doin a go-go
I got the killer instinct, make MC's extinct
Pep more than ginseng, always mad testing
forwards I rrrrrrrrrrip, backwards I pirrrrrrrrr
Fester, I keep the stage warmer than furrrrr
No way to control it, my style is automatic
Many MC system shut down when your gun comes around
Plus I roll more chicks in stirrups, than Lou Diamond Phillips
Makin grills swell up, ??
I step up in a violent rage the five-oh says damn
Jay B's gonna give your black ass a new cage
Blacked out, with the Artifacts, I kick the nonstop rap
MC El and Tame One got my back
In the attack, of what? Attack of New Jeruzalem

Attack, of what? Attack of New Jeruzalum (4X)

-Chorus 2X-Happy tears fade fast
Sad tears tend to last
You've got your blood-stained heart
In your nicotine-stained hands
And your twenty-nine years
Did not help you pass
Oh, the roadkill, cheap thrill
Obstacle filled path
White lies, black dress
Brightest of darkness
You close your tearstained eyes
To our silver lined madness
After twenty-nine years
You might want to confess
That we have made
A fucked-up place
That I can not erase
Sing to me
Sing to me
Sing to me
Sing to me
White lies, black heart
Tearing us apart
You breathe the frost-filled air
From my lungs to your lungs
After twenty-nine years
How much more to come?
Let, we have made
A fucked-up place
That I can not erase
Sing to me
Sing to me
Sing to me
Sing to me
Happy tears fade fast
Sad tears tend to last
You've got a sad, sad song
Stuck in your aching head
And your twenty-nine years
Did not teach you that
Changing melodies
Will change your destiny at last
Now, we have made
A fucked-up place
We're trying to erase
Erase
Sing to me
Sing to me
Sing to me
Sing to meFeigning joy and surprise at the gifts we despise over mulled wine with you
On the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month
The sleigh bells are in time, ringing true
How we cling each day long to the snowflakes and hope in hell
That it won't end
Don't let the bells end
Christmas time just let them ring in peace
Well the weather is cruel
And the season of Yule lifts the heart but it still hurts
You've got your career spent the best part of last year apart and it still hurts
So that's why I pray each and every Christmas day that it won't end
Don't let the bells end
Christmas time just let them ring in peace
Christmas time don't let the bells end
Christmas time don't let the bells end
Curse underneath the mistletoe leaves when you're not here
You went away upon boxing day
Now how the hell am I gonna make it into the New Year
Christmas time don't let the bells end
Christmas time don't let the bells end
Christmas time don't let the bells end
Christmas time just let them ring in peace
Christmas time don't let the bells end
Christmas time don't let the bells endSenses takes off from the world outside
Exposed enough, it's to hide
A life that was confined in a liar
All alone nothing to share
Crisis will no longer exist
In your mind that's full of mist
Relief and heal can sure be gained
Following after the runaway brain
Act no more just lie down still
Do keep warm stay away from the chill
Run away, away from the past
Catch up the time, catch it up fast
Do not step over the line again
Do go as far as your runaway brain
What will happen to our dear old friend?
We assure you all there won't be no happy end
You're growing fast from the past...
You're growing fast from the past...
Senses takes off from the world outside
Exposed enough, it's to hide
A life that was confined in a liar
All alone nothing to share
Crisis will no longer exist
In your mind that's full of mist
Relief and heal can sure be gained
Following after the runaway brainIt is no mystery
What you get is what you see
You betrayed my loyalty
You've gone and done me wrong
Now I do you harm
My revenge is guaranteed
You stabbed me in the back
Spit right in my eye
Dragging me into the fray
Take you out, right you off, there's never enough
Ways to throw you away
[Chorus]
You'd better start runnin'
'Cause you know that I'm comin'
Cocked and loaded and I never miss
I'm onto your game
And I'm layin' the blame
And I'm addin' your name to my blacklist
You shoulda thought twice
'Cause your playin' with your life
You must have some sort of death wish
I haven't any doubt
That your time has run out
'Cause I've added your name
To my blacklist
You tried to beat me
Thought you could defeat me
But how you we ever wrong
I rise to the occasion
Character assassination
To put you down where you belong
You've got a lot to say
When I'm so far away
Now you've got a problem with me
Take you out, write you off, when I've had enough
Of your verbal debris
[Chorus]
For all the shit you talk
You've never walked the walk
All you do is run and hide
Slander me, slag me
I'm not a man you should deride
I've heard everything
All your mudslinging
You better run, as fast as you can
Take you out, write you off, are you brave enough
To stand and fight like a man
[Chorus]Now I can see they're not any better
Their lies give 'em some more chances
Lil' more time but can't play with fate
It's too late to hide from my hate
I know what will be my weapon
I use yours: that goddamn silence
Now I arm myself and I turn
Against you in your perfect world
I empower from down under
Tear the ancient instincts open
They are leading me through my life
I feed myself through my roots
My pain was only a lesson
Learned who I really can count on
This taught me how to live my life
Overcome myself to survive[Instrumental]Like I said, I'm ready to go
Ease my pain desire
Last night I begged to god
Light my heart to fire
Let me pour some taste down
See my last silent pain desire
Let me take a last breath
Before I saw, blind my eyes
Triple corpse hammerblow
Triple corpse hammerblow
Don't push me...
Don't push me...
Don't push me!
Let it trust my great vow
Life goes away faster
Let it trust the meaning
Like life it was way before
Move away the blow out
Like it was by silent Bodom
The way it feels, like it feel before
How you feel, feel before!
Triple corpse hammerblow
Triple corpse hammerblow
Don't push me...
Don't push me...
Don't push me!Fire falling from the sky
Rage of God is coming down
Armageddon's drawing nigh
Sinner cry, heathen die
Hear the toll of pain, Gloria, Gloria
In the fiery rain, fire falling from the sky
Rage of God is coming down
Armageddon's drawing nigh
Sinner cry heathen die
Hear the toll of pain, Gloria, Gloria
Now the time has come, the end's begun
And the only one will come
It has been foretold
By the visions of the old
And the madness in their eyes
Said his angel will arise
That's what they know
Holy Lord, it's over, oh God
We have done no wrong
So we go where we belong
To the never ending dream
But for those who lived in sin
They claim to know
Holy Lord it's over, oh God
Hey angel, can you tell me?
Will you lead us to the place?
Full of heat in the fire
For we only brought disgrace
He is not the one if they only knew
Hey angel, will you take us?
To the judgment of his rage
Hey, will we die
For we couldn't close the gate?
To the knowledge as they have been told
I don't know how could I prove
Nothing but the cloven hoof
Reigning over them as well
While they keep on fighting hell
Babylon, the scarlet whore has come
We are the seven, judgment of heaven
Why don't we know? We are the angels
It's revelation, soul castigation
Fire will burn us away
We are the seven, judgment of heaven
Why don't we know? We are the angels
It's revelation, soul castigation
Fire will burn us away
Redeemer, devastation
Hope it only has been ment
For the sin of the dreamer
Who broke the low you'd sent
He is not the one, if they only knew
Hey, don't know but I wondered:
When we lost the seal again
Maybe stoned by the incense
Do we rise or just descent
He is not the one, if they only knew
I don't know how could I prove
Nothing but the cloven hoof
Reigning over them as well
While they keep on fighting hell
Babylon, the scarlet whore has come
We are the seven, judgment of heaven
Why don't we know? We are the angels
It's revelation, soul castigation
Fire will burn us away
We are the seven, judgment of heaven
Why don't we know? We are the angels
It's revelation, soul castigation
Fire will burn us away
Woe to you longing for the wisdom
Woe to you longing for the light
All my sons bring me back what is mine
Or you'll end burning in this night
Woe to you longing for the wisdom
Woe to you longing for the light
All my sons bring me back what is mine
Or you'll end burning in this night
Once I have been lost
In what they told me to believe
Until I felt in burning
Deep inside to set my spirit free
And I escaped to another world
To help the little men
Who make me plunge into philosophy
To feel my mind again
No one left to hold me tight
On the real other side but her in chains
I had been alone till the madman come along
With the knowledge and silver long beard
He was the first man ever teaching how I could be free
Helping me to find, oh, the mind and the soul
They've been trying to hide away
And he promised we'd help Anna
If I'd help him to go all the way
Go all the way into the world of minds
Open the gate and do not close behind
Prevent them from hiding the light away
Prevent them from tellin' us tales
Or the end of all they scare us with
Will be a million empty brains
I could bring you what you told me
The seal they need to close the gate forever
But still I haven't found a meaning
Anna will we ever be together
You've been fighting for your soul
And sometimes it takes a toll
Hope one day you'll understand
What it means to hold in hands
What they call a fantasy
It is nothing but a key
To the world that now you're in
That they call a wicked dream
When you're walking on your own
When you're broken and alone
You may feel us from inside
On the other side of life, oh oh oh oh
I've been fighting for my soul
And sometimes it takes a toll
Hope one day we'll understand
What it means to hold in hands
What we call a fantasy
But it's nothing but a key
To the world that now I'm in
That we call a wicked dream
Oh, walking on my own
When I'm broken and alone
I may feel you from inside
From the other side of lifeMusic by THE #1 GENIUSE IN THE UNIVERSETHE GREAT KAT!
(Instrumental)Gather your emotions in fragile mortality
Try to grasp my infinite darkness
Feel the crawling prescience, breed on evil thoughts
In the void around your tortured being
Contemplate the untold curse of my region
Created to suffer the naked cold death
Peeling you layer by layer, skin flesh and bone
Embrace the horror inflicted by me
Cascades of atrocity, emerge from the inner circle
I am the master of my realm
I will decide the pain
Show me your mind
Believe, confess, comply
Evolving to a certain state of perfection
Your soul is my pleasures tool
Unpurified intoxicated structures of creation
Flooding your existence with total despair
By suffering I will restrain the source within
Shaping myself with dissolving remains
Transmutation totally absorbing your life
For the flesh, by the flesh I will fill your void
Between shadows and darkness, denying the light
I am the master of my realmThis is the closing line for you my friend
Day after day degenerated by the will of my hand
Havoc surrounds my path
It forms the shape for you to follow
Now what's left in you is fear
Feel the slow collapse breaking out inside
The cold comes creeping upon you my dear
I make you obsolete, soon gone, there is no turning back
I'm possessed by the search, in purity I will wander
Driven by the urge, leave my head let me reap once more again
Oh, number forty seven
There is no heaven, but I bring you serenity
Now, countless days you've tried
There is no meaning, I bring you home to the god's Terminal
I'm not alone, I'm not my self
I feel the dark reign, I see the lights go out
I'm not alone, I'm not my self
I don't need to know why, I just need it, to stop
I'm possessed by the search, in purity I will wander
Driven by the urge, leave my head let me reap once more again
Oh, number forty seven
There is no heaven, but I bring you serenity
Now, countless days you've tried
There is no meaning, so don't breath, I bring you peace, I bring you home to the god's TerminalSpread the word
Through me God is heard

God say's be a real prick
God say's have a T.V. show
God say's baby do some blow
God say's taxes are a sin
God say's pour the money inI see it in their faces, below the veil of peace.
The twisted mask of slavery, all free will deceased.
Their words they tell me nothing, smoke screen conceals the lies.
Carbon copied acquiescence, faceless suit and tie.
Crawl back in your holes, when the work day's through...
One cog in the machine, the machine runs you...
The soul it burns for fuel.
Mass exploitation and riches for the few.
Christ of modern culture, work away the sin,
sleep away the anger, work day soon begins.
Crawl back in your holes, when the work day's through...
One cog in the machine, the machine runs you...Tomorrow is chamber of sadness griefing for today,
When the prophets break so unfeelingly the ray of my luck.
And I my hand rear to you kissed by pain,
To forever take down from mute mouth the bitter fruit of my wailing.
I interweaved by aure of despair,
I judge that the joy is only punishment for me,
Only load of other disappointment,
Which I can't already bear anymore.
Also sorrow me dresses, dresses me in his tearful clothing.
On this distressful way, on which is obvious to pity.
I, on crossway of joy and sadness, my mind search,
If the pleasure sheer fief is and the kingdom is the sorrow?!
I interweaved by aure of despair,
I judge, that the joy is only punishment for me,
Only load of other disappointment,
Which I can't already bear anymore.[Lyrics by RMS Hreidmarr]
His excess of light is searching for your darkness
He is the tyrant
There's one only law for him ...to be pure
He comes from above
He died a thousand times and put his hand in mine
He hails victory and loss
I hear him coming every single day
And the queen desires me
To use some gentle entertainment to him
If it be her will...
And I have no choice - Plus de chemin nulle part
I should kill for him - I will kill for me
He shall bring me the anti-matter
No compassion, never
Never kneel before anyone
The wound is so deep
Them - Us - Against
I sacrify my right arm to the golden rain
And I know it's a sign
I know the end is near
One black cancer to make the children close their eyes
Abime, Abyssus, Propator !
The red earth is trickling down on the wall
Its blood is running off my veins
Et tandis que le grand feu devore le monde la matiere
Je prends ma place a la porte du cercle divin
Antagonize the world - Incest and crime
Humiliation of the whore - Cum, suck me child
Vengeance is mine - Murder is wine
Purification through the forever more
Hold your breath and picture the scene
The green-eyed angels are losing their wings
All mothers are devorating the babies
While children fornicate with animals
And fathers die of overdose
Dressons le bucher de ce monde
Et les ames des elus seront la substance divine
United we stand
We walk through the flames
We walk upon the ruins of your dreams
Of charity and of respectEverything you see you want.
Go to clubs.
Middle class revolt.
Put it down....
He wants Homestyle
Sublimates the envy to C2s
Bump into each other and jolt
D2s, D1s, bump into each other and jolt
Middle class revolt
Calorific.
Middle class revolt
Everything you see
Middle class revolt
Go to clubs
Crashing into C2s
Middle class revolt
A man
Extremely lazy
Exhumes the cooked pigeon
His words indignant
Because it was cooked wrong
Middle class revoltSickened by this apathy
The problems sit in front of our eyes, but we do not see
We turn our backs to where the solutions lie
Destroy all that gives us life
Left it for dead, we will soon follow
No future, no tomorrow
Mankind's natural regression toward self destruction
The sky bleeds as the wound
Becomes infected
The end of a world neglected
Sift through the ashes
Ignored the signs (cries)
Stripped away all that gives us our basic needs
We have already planted the seeds of destruction
Suffocate us for the price of corporation's greedMondlicht leitet kalt den Pfad der dunkelroten Gier
Scharfe Fnge blitzen wei, gleich tdlich-heller Zier
Mitleidlos, voll Blutdurst finster, geht es durch die Nacht
Wolfsgesang ertnet zu der Ehr' untoter Macht
Untergang der Sonne heiet Wiederkehr der Dunkelheit
bleich steht dann die Reichsarmee der Finsternis und ist gefeit
Wider Kreuz und Bibelmystik, Kabbala und Holzespfahl
Untot harren sie, vereinigt durch das blut'ge, graus'ge Mahl
Haltlos entfesselt, voll rasender Gier und getragen
Vom kalten Wolfsgesang
Blutsaugen, unbarmherzig birngen sie stets den
Tod vor Sonnenaufgang
Staubbedeckte Srge steh'n in Gruften, bergen roten Drang
Nachtwrts geht alsbald der Flug mit dem Sonnenaufgang
Durch blutige Jahrhunderte des Grauens, das kein Ende hat
Fern der sen Illusion, die mancher still ersinnen tat.Taken the long way
Dark realms I went through
I arrived
My vision's so clear
In anger and pain
I left deep wounds behind
But I arrived
Truth might be changed by victory
Beyond the void but deep within me
A swamp of filth exists
A lake it was of crystal beauty
But Arda's spring went by
I've heard the warning
Well curse my name
I'll keep on laughing
No regret
No regret
Don't fear the eyes of the dark lord
Morgoth I cried
All hope is gone but I swear revenge
Hear my oath
I will take part in your damned fate
I will always remember their cries
Like a shadow which covers the light
I will always remember the time
But it's past
I cannot turn back the time
(I) don't look back
There's still smoke near the shore
But I arrived
Revenge be mine
I will take part in your damned fate
Morgoth I cried
It's my oath
So don't fear the eyes
Of the dark lord
Soon you will be free
Set your spirit free
"Suddenly I realized
The prophecies
I've never believed in
My deeds were wrong
I've stained the land
And slain my kin
(Burning Soul)
There's no release from my sins
It hurts
THE CURSE OF FÃANOR RUNS LONG
Time and only time will tell us
Tell: was I right or wrong?
When anger breaks through
I'll leave mercy behind"
I will take part in your damned fate
Morgoth I cried
It's my oath
So don't fear the eyes
Of the dark lord
I will always remember their cries
Like a shadow they'll cover my life
But I'll also remember mine
(And) after all I'm still aliveand now our time comes
and now our time comes
there will come a time
we said
but time only goes
the fading of the rainbow
the closing of a rose
we'll make the time
we vowed
but times already made
impatient as the twilight
elusive as the shade
and now our time comes
and now our time comes
we'll take the time
we both agreed
but time is only lived
the clock unwinds
and autumn leaves
run riot in the wind
and time just slips away
they say
like golden grains of sand
and the days and nights
we held so tight
escape from out our hands
and now our time comes
and now our time comes
and now our time comes
and now our time comes
and now it has gone
and now it has goneScores upon scores, what vengeance is right?
Where did all this shit originate?
Spiral of endless unlawful death
Wildfire of hatred, barbaric vice
Fighting for their own oppression, absolute allegiance
Unrestrained killing without cause
Wanton psychopathic action, rabid empty conscience
Indelible, never satisfied
Paranoia, offensive escalation, pointless bloodshed
Hopelessly consumed, mobs of irate radicals, fanatical devotion
Brute force, worn out, know nothing else, their life is Hell
Death gives them purpose
Vacant sense of their own worth, unsanctioned war, destruction
Misdirected anger, reactionary homicide
Retaliation, adolescent grasp of culpability, bringing others misery
Taking out their fury on someone else
Cold blooded prejudice, slaughtering innocents
Death is all that matters, trade their life for mass murder
Poised to inflict mass suffering and pain
Genocide, prophesied, condoned by the word
Misperceiving truth, inducements to explosive violence
Decimation is their sole intention
Suicidal terrorists keep squandering their lives
Meaningless sacrifice, another generation
To serve a vengeful incarnation, dying for a useless cause
Constant aggressors, born antagonists, permanent ignorance
Decades behind, they steal technology, immoral misuse
Paranoia, escalation, pointless bloodshed, no horror spared
Cheap vain murder, know nothing else, brute force, worn out
A world of shit, short sighted spiritual poverty
Desperate search to fill a hollow void
Lying in wait for a weakness, exploiting any vulnerability
Children, who'll die while they're young, stupid, more wasted life
Monstrous, desensitized dictator, orders them to die
Violent assault, presuming salvation awaits beyond
No hope for their future, they war unto their end
Dysfunction, poisoned, ignorance reigns
The cycle protects it's own, momentum impedes it's change
Corrupted young minds die, old minds alike succumb
Totalitarian seduction, it's a fucking lieIn the web of dreams
In the well of nightmares
In the world of her coma
She's playing her game
She belongs to the clan
Half-alive, half-dead
Her astral body
Stronger than her mortal shell
Sleepwalking
She is
Still talking
In her sleep
She's stalking
Her prey
Sleepwalking
Somnambulist!
Sleepwalking
She is
Still talking
In her sleep
She's stalking
Her prey
Sleepwalking
Somnambulist!
In distorted rooms
Corridors to nowhere
In the depths of her coma
She has found her home
She's no longer alone
Forever she belongs there
Her astral body
Stronger than her mortal shell
Sleepwalking
She is
Still talking
In her sleep
She's stalking
Her prey
Sleepwalking
Somnambulist!
Sleepwalking
She is
Still talking
In her sleep
She's stalking
Her prey
SleepwalkingSomeday I hope to rise above material chains which hold me down
To turn my anger into love and keep my feet planted on the ground.
To undo stigmas societies branded, misconceptions about being a man.
To be grateful, take nothing for granted, to live the truth as best I can.
I seek the truth whatever that may be,
I seek the answers to questions, please God help me.
To look at people and see no color, vision clear of prejudice or spite,
To treat people just like my brother, for this I pray with all my might.
To learn to let go of all my fears and learn to embrace all of my tears,
To search for faith and humility, to walk the path which sets me free.
Salvation, from society, damnation, have mercy on me.
So many lies I told, so many lives I've sold.
So far away from who I am I never understand.
So many things I regret, so many things that I let
Take me away from myself, too late to take it back.
So many dreams I had, so many lives I've lived
So many friends I said goodbye forever
So many times I wish, so many times I dream,
Do it again, I swear I'd never.
In my quest to uncover the truth the deepest wounds get left behind
As I seek serenity from the war, from the war inside my mind.When I was a child then it came. A night full of thunder and rain I
would be never the same. I wish that I never had seen what no one would
ever believe. Playing tricks that my eyes deceive. So scared I felt my spirit
leave. Now I'm darker than black. Digital eyes for therapy. The faster we
live the more that we see. Did you just see that my god. The entity looked
right at me with the eyes of obsidian. Darker than black it would seem. The
eyes of obsidian. Deep in the dark of the night lust at the edge of my sight
a shadow was coming to life. As if I awoke from a dream. Awkwardly
crippled a secret that I cannot keep. Evil no longer asleep now I'm darker
than black
[Pre-chorus]
Tuning our minds to the same key. Something just moved what was that
[Chorus]Breaking the silence, lonely screams that can't be heard
Casting the shadows, in your mind his spoken word
Famine and wars, prophecies are said and done
It's growing black, blackening.
Where's the sun?
Where's the sun?
Where has it gone?
Can you believe all forms of life just die
Atomic fate will show our eyes
Here lies the sad reality
Insight that saw forbidden destiny
A vision saw what was to come
Time is now under destruction's thumb
The eyes that saw tomorrow
Leads us to the road of sorrow
Echoes of thunder shout across the reddened sky
So in an instant existence will die
All for the power, money and its lust
Our politicians return us to dustTrapped inside a box
Four long years
Hiding from the world
Punished by your peers
Studied teachers words
Staff appointed hearts
Earned a piece of paper
No go forth and start
Go forth Be conquered
Go Forth and Die
Now you've graduated
Mind is mutilated
Thrust into the world
Feeling segregated
Move in with your parents
Back into the dark
Landed where you started
Bachelor of Arts
The learning starts now...
Open up your textbooks and turn to the
Chapter concerning your DETH
Night sky
Bleeds red
Black birds
Bring DETH
You'll be eaten by the blackness
Of your rotting mind that's dying
You're consumed with sharpened wings
That penetrate your frightened lying
Go die
Go die
Go die go!
Now you're sad and frightened
Want to go and hide
Maybe get your masters
Eight more years inside
Dream of your own murder
Strangled by the IVY
Drown in student loans
Better off just dying
Go Die
Go Die
You'll be eaten by the blackness
Of your rotting mind that's dying
You're consumed with sharpened wings
That penetrate your frightened lying
Go Forth Be conquered
Go forth and die
Go forth be conquered
Go forth and die
Go forth and die
Go forth and die
Go forth and die
Go forth and die(lyrics: Varien)
Behind the wall of tears
You can't see the sunbeams
Your consciousness surrounded
by the reef of oblivion
Prayers, supplications are the only hope
The hope of survival
Chance of salvation
Behind the wall of tears
You lose the sense of existence
You'll never hear own thoughts
You can't overcome your defeat
You've fallen down
Fallen dawn
Smashed into the rock of bitterness
You can't see the brightness
Your feelings - behind the wall of obscurity
lead: LES
lead: BART
Revelation of weakness
Wasted ideals
Walking the paths of hope
Remove the chance of existenceOn the first light of the day you march on
Departure has arrived, don't look back
Avoid the darkness, stay away, stay out of sight
Until you feel the blast of a shooting star
Following the spark like a rocket in the sky
Between the bear and the scorpion, getting close
Headed north, frozen land, where tigers go to die
Don't fear the cold, it'll numb your memories out
You are higher in the sky
Learn the skill to stay alive, survival
The city is so mean, you're being watched
Reach the tunnel, light the torch, you're on the hunt
Until the light calls you back into the wild
When you get to the other side, please send a sign
It'll fly through the atmosphere in time
And if you hold the truth within your hands
You won't be sent back, through the rain, reborn
Everlasting love is ever-growing
Hang on to what you have and let it grow
Everlasting love is ever-dying
It's in the past, you have to let it go[Instrumental]Go cover up you track. Another lie goes around. Another lie spewed from your mouth. You took your shot at me but I gave it all I
had. In the end I'll rise above and you'll meet your destiny. This is your destiny. Everyday I face the world I feel you on my
back whispering another lie to throw me off my track. I learn from my mistakes and I know that I'm forgiven. My strength comes
from above.Another day,
Another lied,
More hopes and words
And thoughts black as a nite
Another place
Another time
Another needing and bleeding and
pleading
And such like
You can't explain
I can't deny
We can't take off, blow off
The sins kept us alive
You felt great
You felt fine
But I stumbled so humbled
Seeking any good sign
I don't sink, I will not crack!!!
I won't bleed, I'm on my straight way
back!!!
I close my eyes
I disappear
i stopped the time, in time
So I could eat my fear
No farther steps
No looking on
And no feeding, exceeding, proceeding
And so in
I won't sink
I won't crack
But go away, get away
I won't turn you back
And all is said
And all is done
And all the gains and losses
Burned in The Almighty Sun
I don't sink, I will not crack!!!
I won't bleed, I'm on my straight way
back!!!
Another day,
Another lied,
More hopes and words
And thoughts black as a nite
Another place
Another time
I don't sink, I will not crack!!!
I won't bleed, I'm on my straight way
back!!!Oh
What has exhaustion brought me?
Unvisited, but still too busy to close my eyes
(To close my eyes)
Maybe one day I'll grasp the pattern
Maybe in time this will all be readable
Maybe in time (time)
As if the solitude could bring me any peace
I was greeted with Constance, I found no sleep
These thoughts are nothing but wished away
I can't remember what it is to be content
These thoughts are nothing but wished away
(But wished away)
I can't remember what it is to be content, 'eah
Show me the exit
Let the signals fade
Maybe one day I'll defeat the cycle
Maybe (maybe) in time (in time)
I'll be able to define this
This wretched purgatory (purgatory)
As if the solitude could bring me any peace
I was greeted with Constance, I found no sleep
These thoughts are nothing but wished away
I can't remember what it is to be content
These thoughts are nothing (these thoughts are nothing)
But wished away (but wished away)
I can't remember what it is to be content
This is bound to fail
This is bound to fail
Go ahead
The enemy will not resist, deceived until the end
I hate this persistence, my eyes may never close
I hate this persistence, my eyes may never closeYou say you want to help me
I know it isn't true
Useless lies behind my back
I'm not a stupid fool
I don't need a lying friend
The kind I'd rather kill
You'd better think suicide
Before I live my will
You know that you're a hypocrite
I really hate the way you live
You deserve anything you get
We won't put up with hypocrites
You look me in the eye
Tell me I'm your friend
Then I catch you lying
Time and time again
I confront you with my hatred
But you just deny
Just another day for you
And just another lie
So long sucker
You pushed me too far
One too many lies
Now you're seeing stars
Lies to reality
Now you've met fate
Life for you is over
For you it's too late
You think you can get away
Someday I'll make you pay[Music: Eric Horton / Dave Garcia]
[Lyrics: Sean Peck]
Destiny, that is what I saw in you
I was so mistaken a love that wasn't true
The things you kept inside
Important issues that you hide but why do you still linger in my mind
You're coming
I'll start running
You're far too late to save our love tonight
My feelings that you vandalize
Well there is nothing to say but good bye
My feelings that you vandaize just one too many lies
Bleeding my heart is split in two
Half seft preservation the other is not with you
Ten too many times pain and fate became entwined escape
You're oblivious you're blind
You're coming
I'll start running
You're far too late to save our love tonight
My feelings that you vandalize
Well there is nothing to say but good bye
My feelings that you vandaize just one too many lies
NO NO NO!
You felt it coming and so did you
Apologetic crap that you spew
You tried to mend it I closed the gate
Now I'm teling you not to wait
The time invested was such a waste
Now you left my mouth with a bitter taste
So high is your maintenance
You just don't know what you want I can't be your sustenance
You don't know that you need something that I just can't feed our love is no longer growing
It's slowing slowing slowing!
My feelings that you vandalize
Well there is nothing to say but good bye
My feelings that you vandaize just one too many lies
My feelings feelings
My feeling that you VandalizeI would do for you what you did to me
even keel
but to you I'm just a mirror
well sometimes mirrors shatter
the shrapnel becomes deadly
it surrounds you with no escape
and you can't save her [X2]
like a ghost
you slept in my bed
and I fell while you tore through my neck
when I awoke you were already dead
those eyes
I'll never forget
make your move
take your time
every pawn threatens your life
go raise hell
come up short
no mercy is granted here
best come clean
kill you stride
keep your head
cleanse your life
cause you can't save her [X2]
like a ghost
you slept in my bed
and I fell while you tore through my neck
when I awoke you were already dead
those eyes
I'll never forget [X3]
"I don't care what you do to her
you won't find her body
I swear
I swear
You won't find her body
in time the rain with every season
will wash the bones down the river"
I would do for you what you did to me
even kill
but to you I am just a mirror
well sometimes mirrors shatter
the shrapnel becomes deadly
"I swear
I swear
you find her body"
---death is upon all of us
it comes in the shape of an angel---[Music - Chastisement, Lyrics - Johan, Marcus]
Portal in sight / the light so bright / a carving on the sign / life denied
/ truth to be known / no rest until it's found / a neverending sound / life
denied / my life was a hypocrisy, i was denied to live / i took my life with
me down to hell / life denied!Psychodelic band gives them a rhytm
swollen procession in disgusting hops
look at the blind - men following the sound
exciting cacophony - money play but...
...I leave the shadow of my shapely ass
for these sick prophets, leave them alone
let them creep, let them rot in peace
in their poplin, poplin twist
In morbid dance
You stifle
In morbid dance
You stifle
In morbid dance
I am indignant at this dancing
I'm gonna vomit, I'm burning out
and crowd is howling in ecstasy
bravo for conductor, money play but...
...I leave the shadow of my...
In morbid dance
you stifle (x4)
Close this shed
Sister you became wild
you shake your ass in a bad rhytm
my dear friend you lose your good manners
In morbid dance
you stifle (x3)
If you only feel the blues, jah, jah, jahSome say the devil is dead, the devil is dead, the devil is dead
Some say the devil is dead, and buried in Killarney
More say he rose again, more say he rose again
More say he rose again and joined the British Army
Feed the pigs and milk the cow, and milk the cow, and milk the cow
Feed the pigs and milk the cow, early in the morning
Cock your leg, oh Paddy dear, Paddy dear I'm over here
Cock your leg, oh Paddy dear, it's time to stop your yawning
Some say the devil is dead, the devil is dead, the devil is dead
Some say the devil is dead, and buried in Killarney
More say he rose again, more say he rose again
More say he rose again and joined the British Army
Katie she is tall and thin, she's tall and thin, and tall and thin
Katie she is tall and thin, and like her drops of brandy
Drinks it in the bed each night, drinks it in the bed each night
Drinks it in the bed each night, it makes her nice and randy
Some say the devil is dead, the devil is dead, the devil is dead
Some say the devil is dead, and buried in Killarney
More say he rose again, more say he rose again
More say he rose again and joined the British Army
The wife she has the hairy thing, a hairy thing, a hairy thing
The wife she has the hairy thing, she showed it to me on Sunday
She bought it in the furrier's shop, bought it in the furrier's shop
She bought it in the furriers's shop, it's going back on Monday
Some say the devil is dead, the devil is dead, the devil is dead
Some say the devil is dead, and buried in Killarney
More say he rose again, more say he rose again
More say he rose again and joined the British Army
My one's over six feet tall, six feet tall, six feet tall
My one's over six feet tall, she likes the sugar candy
Goes to bed at six o'clock, goes to bed at six o'clock
Goes to bed at six o'clock, she's lazy, fat and dandy
Some say the devil is dead, the devil is dead, the devil is dead
Some say the devil is dead, and buried in Killarney
More say he rose again, more say he rose again
More say he rose again and joined the British ArmyWhat fine judgement I see
in the eyes of our world leaders
Oh how beautiful life could be
if it hadn't been shot to pieces
Shot to pieces
What secret music do I hear
upon the drums of my ear
What great pleasure I feel
I come from nowhere and I shall return
Because of you people I will flee
I see my late identity burnA GLASSY HEART IS CRYING
AND FOR ALL THE DREAMS DENYING
NEVER SMILES
ALWAYS ON THE MOVE
BY THE YEARS IT`S RAKED WITH FIRE
AND THE HEYDAY OF DESIRE`S
FAR TO REACH
DOWN AND OUT IT LIES
THE INNER FALLOW LAND
IN A TIGHT SPOT I DEMAND
THE YOUNG BLISS OF ETERNAL DAWN
AND WHEN ALL THE SKIES WOULD FALL
AND A SINGLE CHANCE IS SMALL
I`LL STILL TOE THE LINE
MY HEART IS LIKE AN OCEAN
WHEN THE RAIN IS LASHING DOWN
AND IF ALL FAILS AND THE WAVES ARE RISING FROWN
MY SOUL CAUGHT IN A WHIRLWIND
LIKE THE EMBERS IN THE FIRE
IF NOT ELSEWHERE, THEN WHERE IS THE DESIRE
IF NOT ELSEWHERE, WHERE IS THE DESIRE(she cried when she found it...its feathers were matted and pressed to its side, its wings were no longer able...still she begged it to fly. its body as frail as paper and wet from her tears. she knelt in the damp grass praying it to heaven and gently pressing its head to her heart...)
the devils in the daughters room
there will be no second knife
(i will look into his eyes)
there will be no second knife
she reached........
for a dream..........
and he smiled as he watched her she was ever so beautiful in sleep
like father (his son made in his image)
her eyelids gently closed the lids concealing her dreams
he stood over her bed
one deep stab kill the hourglass
(let the sand leak slowly from its body draw out the time until it breathes its last)

lost it all, dreams they wait
now - now - now
now I can't crasp it
the tears will try
try to hide
to help me
away - away - away
now you're so far away
so far away
can I have confidence in love
all I gave is not enough
the hour feel the time
no hope
now I'm still alive
now - now - now
all is drifting away
tears will try
try to hide
to help me by myside
away - away - away
now you're so far away
so far away
now I've doubts
if the needs for safety
emotions fly
pay living them
is not enough
be hidden feelings shown reserved
trust eat them

The way I always
And I remember falling
And I remember crawling
Still I'm falling
Have you come down
From all the peeling?
'Cause I remember holy
And only God can save me
Still I'm falling
This is the last time I'll speak of holding you
Take this from me and take it before it dies
'Cause this is the last time I'll speak of, holding you
Still I'm falling
This is the last time I'll speak of holding you
And you get up and you fall down
You get up and you fall down
You get up and you fall awayWinter's lost its grip
The ocean is set free
The ship glides through the broken ice
Out to an open sea
North winds fill the sails
They fly on frothing seas
As hope grows stronger in his heart
It's easier to breathe
Days turn into nights
Nights turn into days
His determination grows
With every breath he takes
There he stands alone, one man against all
With a sword in each hand, soon he will fall
There he stands alone, one man against all
With a sword in each hand, heeding the call
When the reach the HanÃ¶ bay
There waits a ship of war
Like the bear attacks its prey
It comes at them with force
All men to the oars
Row for all your worth
Most likely this will be your last day
On this wretched earth
The weak they try to run
But he's prepared to fight
One by one his friends are slain
Only he remains
He knows the end is near
They have him in their jaws
When a noble man appears
He tells them, withdraw
There he stands before him
As the skirmish quells
He offers him
Join our crew or join your friends in hell
There he stands alone, one man against all
With a sword in each hand, and soon he will fall
There he stands alone, one man against all
With a sword in each hand, he's heeding the call[instrumental]Fern von schwachem Geist entfacht des Weisen Licht die

I've got nothing at all to say
Beggar with a soapbox
Kinesiatic with pride
Beggar with a soapbox
But i've got nothing to say
Build a bigger soapbox
the nothing just gets louder
this is just another instance of strategically placed stagnation
move along
nothing to see here
this is just strategic stagnation
all our stomachs growl for the same thing
just another fix to us inside
eat, sleep, lather, rinse, repeat
none of those things are good enough for meNo one seems to know
What kind of a trial we've been marching through
Blood, sweat, tears, bitterness and sorrow
Are engraved on our souls
We would like to see you crawling
Through the same decade of disbelief
Then you would know what it feels like being isolated
Why should we have to keep
Our dreams concealed
Like everyone else around
We only trust in the voice of our heart
Renaissance, a bound in blood... forever
Like the plague inside our veins
We refuse to lie to ourselves
To deny what we are
We sacrifice everything around us
To reach what we want
Why should we have to keep
Our dreams concealed
Like everyone else around
We only trust in the voice of our heart
Renaissance, a bound in blood... forever
Like the plague inside our veinsWith the fire from the fireworks up above me
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain at hand
You run for the cover in the temple of love
You run for another but still the same
For the wind will blow my name across this land
Believing pain and fear outside
But someone near you rides the weather
And the tears he cried will rain on
Walls as wide as lovers eyes
In the temple of love - shine like thunder
In the temple of love - cry like rain
In the temple of love - hear my calling
In the temple of love - hear my name
And the Devil in the black dress watches over
My guardian angel walks away
Life is short and love is always over in the morning
Black wind come carry me far away
With the sunlight died and the night above me
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain inside
You run for cover in the temple of love
You run for another, it's all the same
For the wind will blow and throw your walls aside
With the fire from the fireworks up above me
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain at
You run for the cover in the temple of love
I shine like thunder, cry like pain
And the temple of love grows old and strong
But the wind blows stronger, cold and long
And the temple of love will fall before this
Black wind calls my name, to you no more
In the black sky thunder sweeping under
Ground and over water, sounds of crying,
Weeping vwill not save you
Faith for bricks and dreams for mortar
All your prayers must seem as nothing
Ninety - six below the wave when
Stone is dust and only air remains
In the temple of love - shine like thunder
In the temple of love - cry like rain
In the temple of love - hear my calling
In the temple of love - is falling downLast man standing
Last man standing
Victory! Last man standing!
Valhalla!! Last man standing!
Shattered and mortally wounded
On the battlefield they lay
Farewell my fellow companions
Thy souls have gone away
(we shall not behold the green fields nor hear the birds sing in may
to defend we have fought and won though with our life we paid)
Victory or Valhalla
Must again be the rallying cry
Ancient pride restored
Let the ancient banners fly high
Broken hilt in my hands
I saw my last break of day
Here and now we found our graves
Our bodies vultures prey
If our folk ever doubts
Or their souls have gone astray
Then lead the way to this place
Where our bones still lay
Stand strong with clenched fists
Withstand with all thy might
Stand strong with clenched fists
Until they are silenced right
Let the glory shine on thee
Lift thy ancient legacy... into light!
Lift thy legacy into light, so their spirits will
Shine on bright... shine bright!
Stand strong with clenched fists
Withstand with all thy might
Stand strong with clenched fists
Until they are silenced... right!!!
Victory or Valhalla must be
Again the rallying cry
Ancient pride restored
Let the ancient banners fly high
When the cause is noble and justice at thy side
To hold what is thine and the fight is right
Victory! Last man standing! Valhalla!
Last man standing!
Victory! Last man standing! Valhalla!
Last man standing![Believer Cover song]We are what's left behind
I can feel It call my name
These worlds that I have taken
Will stay with me as lies
No they won't leave their victim
I know that we are on their list of deeds
The decomposing lifeform
Our tortured earthly souls are waiting to be freed
Their day has only just begun
And any killing bird stays to the bitter end
They take the pain
That you have given to me
If only I could bring against this world the feeling of
myself now choking it's not safe you're running from help
If I was blind I'd see the strain of being here embodied
to be a victim of the earth and now I'm trapped inside.
It's too late for us now, the wheels are in motion
Hear broken regrets, I fear you're out of time,
Death is coming, your life's a failure,
Now we're watching as you die.Empty discordance.
A social illness plagues humanity,
Corrupting civilization continuously,
The era of Anno Domini is in decay.
Deepest sympathy for the future spawn of Earth.
Open your eyes, open your mind,
Ignore the words of the fucking beguiler,
They are deceitful scum,
a disgrace to the procreator.
Deepest sympathy for the future spawn of Earth.
Empty Discordance.
DOWN ON YOUR KNEES.
Time for awakening,
Take a stand,
cast a shadow upon the ironclaw of tyranny,
Let's overcome this plight.It all seems so strange
The mutes the bums
The dogs with mange, the poor,
Doesn't anybody help themselves anymore
I guess not
Barefoot pregnant women
Little kids with snot on their face
A land of plenty, a dynasty of disgrace !
I'll manifest for you
Careening on the outer limits of reality
My mission to create a better galaxy
I must not fail them now,
I look inside to see that it's clear
Living life is just not enough
You must persevere
Please grab hold
Not to things that are bought
But to things that cannot be sold,
Then you'll see
You're released by trial and error
The world's prophecy is to learn
A candle lit from the bottom
Will soon start to burn
Don't dignify, a false spy in the sky
Re-route your path
With the blink of an eye
Walking around with a mind of your own
With a glance to the past
You can see we have grown
How much we have grown
It's been my dream
To enter the stream
To let carnates know
What life really means
If one understands
That's all I can ask
Life to you
Is such a wretched taskFearless I pushed the switch, causing you
Suddenly to disappear
The echo of thunder again reduced
Never thought you would leave me
Still chasing time, so close
Yet so far apart
My understanding is killing me
I know you had to follow your heart
Don't look at me now
It's for your own good
Just to walk away
Road end remains
Don't look at me now
It's for your own good
Just to walk away
Road end remains
The unspoken truth
All hopes merged into stone
Terrified of the unknown
What could have been I realize
All hope merged into stone
Terrified of the unknown
Is now forever gone
Let it slip through my fingers
Don't look at me now
It's for your own good
Just to walk away
Road end remains
Don't look at me now
It's for your own good
Just to walk away
Road end remains
Not aware of the scarlet claw
Seemingly uncomplicated
What could have been I realize
Now your love, forever lost
Fearless I pushed the switch, causing you
Suddenly to disappear
The echo of thunder again reduced
Never thought you would leave me
New day has come
But I'll never get over you
Tide is high
Access still deniedcold earth of our cold earth with blood creeping on the path clinging to the fairytale which the call religion they are slayed by our demons of war and hurling storms these are human creatures of a filthy and weak kind blackened souls blessed by eternity dwelling under unholy ground forbidden thoughts and dreams provided by strong storms of bold beliefs and black souls of immortality the demons are dancing as we crawl up and out on our hands and faces we greet our brothers with horned wings and cold minds it is complete now we rise the dwelling and feedingYou're an image pale that points and laughs
White mistress in a fiery bath
Now tie me down and take me home
I'm not afraid to go
Now tie me down and take me home
I'm not afraid to go
Shake the roots off the trees
Your conscience fades
Eyes have no vision to see
Your soul degrades
Grey follows in front of me
You've lost your way
Every life is but a death to me
[Chorus]
Eventually the jokes aren't free and
Nothing's ever fun and
Nothing's funny
Blunt self believe, too big to fall
Lead shadow stands just inches tall
I hope to God you never die
Your joke is just my type
Shake the roots off the trees
Your conscience fades
Eyes have no vision to see
Your soul degrades
Grey follows in front of me
You've lost your way
Every life is but a death to me
[Chorus]
But now I see that the joke's on me and
Nothing's ever fun and
Nothing's funny
Don't be scared
Don't be scared
Don't be scared
Don't be scared
Don't be scared
[Chorus]
But now I see that the joke's on me and
Nothing's ever fun and
Nothing's funny
Your joke is just my typeIn the darkness that feeds your mind
In your cavernous seething eyes
You lost some things you never could replace
Tell me why
I see the forces that drive you
Who said I?
For you it's too late to see
Tell me why
Will they make you feel righteous?
Hear the cries
They'll flash their twisted faces across my screen
In a world ruled by obsession
Seeking retribution
Breathing pure aggression
A reflection of the hate that you must breed
You're out of reach
Out of reach
So you got to keep on with your sinister life
It's too late to change your mind
Your end will be violent and abrupt
Make sure what's done is done
Tell me why
I see the forces inside you
Who said I?
For you it's too late to see
Tell me why
Does it make you feel righteous?
To flash their twisted faces across my screen
In a world ruled by obsession
Seeking retribution
Breathing pure aggression
A reflection of the hate that you must breed
You're out of reach
You're out of reach
Out of reach
You're out of reach

Vultures swarm
Shredding carnage in chaostic frenzy
Scavengers feast
Body parts strewn amongst the horde
Showers erupt spewing viciously
Arteries severed
Suffering a tormented existence
Pain in voked torso sliced
Stripped of meat skeleton exposed
Brutally torn flesh adorns my domain
Demoniac beasts embellish the beyond

And words, from whom we don't know

Flee from false
I have tasted the weight of lust
My hands on the skein of height
A pallid death
Mirage into dark
The horizons echo your glance
Following a detractive sleep
I am the wrath beneath the heavens

Fallen into the vision of effect

And saw it's petrified fall
Have seen your decline's symbols
But carried another life
We tasted the wine of Persepolis,
As mute as our era's breath
Death was never a fragment of
Exalting fantasy
Remembrance ii, this last region last of fire
Orgasmic cries tears and words

Like these murderous rhymes tight from genuine craft
Check the print, it's where veterans spark the letterings
Slow moving MC's is waitin for the editin
The liquid soluble that made up the chemistry
A gaseous element, that burned down your ministry
Herbal vapors, and biblical papers
Smokin Exodus, every square yard is plush
Fuck the screw-faced photo sessions facial expression
leaves impressions, try to keep a shark nigga guessin
Give crazy shouts Son here's the outcome
Cut across the semi-gloss rhymes you floss
Shit is outdated, just like neckloads of Sterlings
Suede-fronts, bell-bottoms, and tri-colored Shearlings
I ain't particular, I bang like vehicular homicides
on July 4th in Bed-Stuy
Where money don't grown on trees and there's thievin MC's
Who cut-throat to rake leaves
They can't breathe, blood splash, rushin fast
like runnin rivers, I be that whiskey in your liver
Duel of the Iron Mic, it's the fifty-two fatal strikes!
This is not a eighty-five affair, made clear
when the Gods get on to perform storms blew up
Wu's up, causin the crowd to self-destruct
Killer bees are stingin somethin while I reveal
Science, that's heavily guarded by the culprit
Bombin your barracks, with aerodynamic
swordplay, poison darts by the doorway
Minds that's laced with explosive doses
Damagin lyrical launcher
Lunge at the youthful offender then injure
any contender, testin the murderous Master
could lead to disaster, dynamite thoughts
explode through your barrier, rips the retina
Who can withstand the astonishing punishing
Stings to the sternum, shocked in the hip-hop livestock
Seekin for a serum, to cure em
Adults kill for drugs plus the young bucks bust
Duckin handcuffs, throats get cut when dough rush
Out of town foes look shook but still pose
We move lioke real pros through the streets we stroll
Bullet holes lace the windows in one-six oh
So control the avenues that's the dream that's sold
Bulding lobbies are graveyards for small-timers
Bitches caught in airports, keys in they vaginas
No peace, yo the police mad corrupt
You get bagged up, dependin if you're passin the cut
Plus shorty's not a shorty no more, he's livin heartless
Regardless of the charges, claims to be the hardest
individual, critical thoughts, criminal minded
Blinded by illusion, findin it confusin
Duel of the iron mics
It's that fifty-two fatal strikes
Duel of the iron mics
It's that fifty-two fatal strikes, nuh
At the height of their fame and glory, they turned on one another
Each struggling in vain for ultimate supremacy
In the passion and depth of their struggle
They very art, that had raised them through such rapiant heights was lost
Their techniques, vanishedSkulls piled on concrete, executions made with ease.
Tombs filled with sickness, an invader who won't take heed.
Evolving with a shotgun, launching killing spree.
Unleashing death on mankind, excluding not a soul free.
He won't be satisfied
A gallery of death art, primitive actions to be seen.
Ceiling dripping from their blood, loves to watch them creep.
Opened the gates of torture, he has found his way.
Generations screaming for more, ripping trough the gateways.
The destroyer...
Skulls piled...
The destroyer...I found a way out, a solution inside
From the things that are bathering me
It's been too long since I felt this way
From your sad life I broke free
Don't ever think that you ripped me apart
And walked away with a price
Cause you can not penetrate my cold heart
ANd fill it with your disease
I wonder now how I lived before
Deaf, dumb, dead and blind
I moved my life forward and I'm never goin' back
And I've left you far behind
There's a lot of things that I've now realized
From the way that you treated me
It's bullshit and it's hatred you epitomized
You were blessed to have been with me
[Chorus:]
You filled my life with your disease
I'd rather die on my feet than live on my knees
Disease is flowing through my veins
I'd rather die right now than live in pain
[Lead]
Looking around at the past and the present
Things are so much better now
Your misery wanted my company
But you can't keep a good man down
Whatever made me want to be with you
Is something I can't understand
'cause if I never saw your fucking face again
I'd die a happy man
[Chorus 2x]High mighty mountains, deep extensive valleys.
Covered by snow, icy winds.
Lifeless, eternal.
You drift on the black waves of damnation,
look forward to the end.
Life is pain and torment,
perfection is the death.
In search of yourself,
shattered by depressions,
teared by painful thoughts.
Aimless, helpless.
You a stranger for yourself,
do not know yourself.
Fear rises up in you.
Look for the saving hand.
You are doomed to death.
You know it, cry.
The cries die away in the wind.
Your shadows sink in the fog.
They come to pick you up.
Endless silence.
You trace their names.
Hope of deliverance.
You see the light.
Unique is it, warm.
It lights up the path for you.
You are doomed to death.Let's walk in a line
Let's do what the person in front of us does
Believe in what he believes
Let's forget our identity
So that we can assume no responsibility
For our lives
And the choices that we make
Or never make
Let us become one
With the bloodless crowds
Consequently, let us throw away our lives
Where are you leading me?
Where are you leading me?
The leader you follow is a follower too
In a round dance gone astray
There's no beginning and there is no end to it
Join the round dance to the song of apathy
(Not fully awake, sleepwalk hand in hand)
You could have been a god
But we are keeping each other in place
Cling to the hand in front of us
To the submissive we submit
And we assume no responsibility
For our lives
And the choices that we make
Or never make
Let us become one
With the bloodless crowds
Consequently, let us throw away our lives
Your future is dark, if you only do what you're expected to
Depart from the beaten track, maybe the blind will see
But follow neither you nor me
They'll refuse to dance to the song of apathy
So, where are you leading me?
The leader you follow is a follower too
In a round dance gone astray
There's no beginning and there is no end to it
Join the round dance to the song of apathy
(Not fully awake, sleepwalk hand in hand)[Music and lyics by Marco Kehren/DEINONYCHUS]
Walking over the seeds of tomorrow. No babies to be born today. The king's crown
shattered has left. Snow White is nothing but a cheap whore. Wake me! I stepped
into this picturesque landscape held by a frame. On the way back it told me to
leave my soul in the snow. My screams didn't help. Why are angels entitled to be
saviours? Today I'm married to misery, and we live long and happy! Wake me!Pat er upphaf pessar sogu at Baldr inn goda dreymdi drauma stora ok

That live inside of me
Defeat and tragedy, walking in shame
Finding nowhere to hide
I've thrown my bottles of guilt into the sea
Hoping the waves carry them away from me
Oh
My heart is beating
I'll never stop fighting, I'll keep breathing
My heart is beating
I'll never stop fighting, I'll keep breathing to stay alive
And here I go, off to make a change
I'm screaming, screaming revival
All of my strength, all of my might
Will go into this to take back my life
All of my strength, all of my might
Will go back into this to take back my life
My life, my life, my life
I'm taking back my life
My life, my life, my life
Taking back my life
Let's go
This song is music to my ears
(This song is music)
And is a new production on an old stage
(On an old stage)
I won't dwell in unhappiness
(I will not dwell in)
Grasping humility
Asking forgiveness
Tomorrow is gone, I'll start living for today
I'll never stop the fighting and I'll take it all away
Tomorrow is gone, I'll start living for today
I'll never stop the fighting and I'll take it awayAre we so brave?
Are we so bold
As to deny our hearts?
Are we so numb?
Are we so cold
As to defy our conscience?
Awkwardly, we walk alone
So distant and so uncaring
Deliberately we disguise ourselves
To protect our frail emotions
The ability to feel and be,
Somewhere in me,
Is longing to free
This screaming breath
Breathe
Selfishly, we retain and horde
Everything and yet, nothing at all
A poisoned soul can never soar
When bound by doubt and by fear
Awkwardly, we walk alone
So distant and so uncaring
Deliberately we disguise ourselves
To protect our frail emotions
The ability to feel and be,
Somewhere in me,
Is longing to free
This screaming breath
Breathe
Are we so brave?
Are we so bold
To hide from things we long to show
Are we so numb?
Are we so cold
As to lose the self to self-control?
The ability to feel and be,
Somewhere in me,
Is longing to free
This screaming breath
BreatheDer stechende Geruch von Ammoniak schwngert die Luft
Gepaart mit den Ausdnstungen der Schweine
Ihre hungrigen Schreie durchschneiden die Stille
Heut Nacht werden wir ein neues Futter bereiten
Der mchtige Stahltrichter der Futtermhle
Silbriges Mondlicht spiegelt sich in blankem Chrom...
Und alles im Inneren wird kleingehackt
Zu Futter fr die Schweine
Heut Nacht werden wir ein neues Rezept probieren
Zutaten dafr hab ich am Bahnhof mir besorgt
Zwei willige Nutten kann man schnell berzeugen
Sie wuten ja nicht, welches Schicksal ihnen blht
Doch Chloroform wirkt rasch und unkompliziert
Ich drcke den Schalter und das Mahlwerk beginnt zu laufen
Das kalte metallische Gerusch zweier Stahlrotoren...
Im Sack neben mir steckt eine der Huren
Der Kleidung entledigt, zum Schlachten bereit...
Mit ihr auf der Schulter steig ich die Leiter empor
Ein Blick in den Trichter ist Vorfreude pur
Mit den Fen zuerst rutscht sie tief hinab
Und dann beginnt ihr letzter Tanz...
Die Rotoren beginnen ihren Krper zu zertrennen
Der wahnsinnige Schmerz fhrt ihr Bewutsein zurck
Kalter Chrom bricht ihre Schreie zur Kakaphonie
Dann verstummt das Fleisch...
Nur das Mahlwerk tut weiterhin seine Pflicht
Schumendes Blut spritzt in mein Gesicht als feine Gischt
Lngst sind die Rotoren beim Oberkrper angelangt
Im Fleisch- und Knochenbrei zittert der nackte Leib
Bis nur noch nahrhaftes Fressen brigbleibt...
So erfllt ihr Leben noch einen guten Zweck
Als Futter fr die Schweine
Wenigstens ihr toter Leib hat seinen Wert
Als Futter fr die Schweine
Eine Hure noch ist brig in dieser Nacht
Als Futter fr die Schweine
Das Schmatzen der Tiere am nchsten Morgen
Klingt zutiefst befriedigt ob des neuen Hausrezepts...
Futter fr die Schweine...Infected carcass
Esophagus full of pus
Entrails remain
As I watch you bleed on
Blistering fetus
Womb full of scabs
Regurgitate the placenta
Rotted flesh I eat
As I fuck a bloody stump
Limbless you lie cold
I form an erection
I crave rotting maggots
Bodies mangled
Lying on me
Mutilated
Infected carcass
Esophagus full of pus
Entrails remain as I watch you bleed on
I crave rotting maggotsSag was du willst, tu was deinen Hunger stillt
Geh auf das Leben zu, lass es blo nicht in Ruh
Greif nicht nach den Sternen, du hast noch viel zu lernen
Lebe den Augenblick mit etwas Geschick
Und lass es zu.
Denn das Paradies findest du nur in dir selbst.
Wache auf und sieh den Knig der sich nicht mit Gewalt bezwingt
Der mit vollen Zgen aus der eigenen Quelle trinkt
Das Seinige und alles Leben in tglicher Vermhlung freudig besingt
Und dem das gelingt.
Denn das Paradies findest du nur in dir selbst.
Nicht mit Blut und nicht im Zorne sollst du deinen Thron erklimmen
Denn Hass schafft Schmach und Leiden und das Glck wird dir entrinnen
Suche deine Freunde, deinen Schatz, dein schnstes Bild
An dem du deine Augen weidest und findest was dein Herze stillt.
Denn das Paradies findest du nur in dir selbst.[January '92]reaching out into the distant time
to reflect something beyond our lives
as my collodes! all confused what is real
wrapping me into disguise... i know
wrapping me into disguise
crossing the gates of conscioucness
down the spiral into a sleep
it's healing, as we float together
we have no need to weep
searching for escape, truth is always hurting
underneath the lies
searching for escape, truth is always burting
under wicked skies
CHORUS:
there we fall and drown, try to heal the wounds
but it is always too late, it's always too late
there we fall and drown, try to heal the wounds
it is always to late, it's always too late
leaving all passion time
no one is waiting for us to return
diamonds in our eyes they refuse to shine
searching for escape, truth is always hurting
underneath wicked skies
searching for escape, truth is always burting
under wicked skies[Music & Arr. Vold & Ole 1997, lyrics by Vold]
In a city of tranquilled hearts
Breathe only the thoughts I shun
You stole my ferocity
You stole my gain
Now I?m lost
in your nothingness again
My eyes have been shut
and my tongue seared to dust
My hands they tremble no more
For now as your blood is at groans
Thoughts are painted in gore
I reach for the dangger
She crawles towards the door
Tears are written in blasphemy
as thoughts are painted in gore
The blade cuts through her vivid flesh
Her screams soar through the night
My mind is forged with lunar dust
I shiver with murderous lusts
How did I merge this abandoned place
Can you see those lights ahead?
So lonely in this massive darkness...The gates of Morken lay in sight, this war is coming to an end
Behind the walls of the darkest place we'll see the Angel fall from grace
Witness the end of flowing tears, the final chapter of our dreams
This lonely figure charges still, revenge fire within
We are so close we feel their pain these brothers lost won't remain the same
On wings outraging we must slain, win our freedom again
We came so close we feel their pain, we are so close they feel our return
This is our time, our brothers were left behind, a silent and broken race
Shall we prevail in fight, we'll turn the wrongs into rights
The Angel will fall from grace
Fire, burn in the dark winter sky, this madness will come to an end
Endless bliss for the children of Light, the Giants will rise and defend
Each fallen calls a thousand more, a frantic carnage with no end
Behind the walls of the darkest place we'll see the Angel fall from grace
Close your eyes, feel the dreams are fading: The Godsent supremacy
Close your eyes, now the dreams are ending: Let's embrace our legacy
The gates of Morken lay in sight, this war is coming to an end
Behind the walls of the darkest place we'll see the Angel fall from grace
Witness the end of flowing tears, the final chapter of our dreams
This lonely figure charges still, revenge fire within
We came so close we feel their pain, we are so close they feel our return
This is our time, our brothers were left behind, a silent and broken race
Shall we prevail in fight, we'll turn the wrongs into rights
The Angel will fall from graceMusic: Mikael Dahl - Lyrics: Mikael Dahl
I was born in the unknown
I am the ruler in knowledge of prophecy
The beholder of your life
Life is sometimes very strange
You can never know what's waiting behind the corner
Tomorrow you may be gone
Pre Chorus:
You don't know the end of your life,
only that you where born
In my eyes I can see your future
Chorus:
Crystal eyes - I see the shadow in the dark
Crystal eyes - I see the face under the mask
I see the growing hate and fear
I can see what's on a dictator's mind,
but I don't wanna realize
Down-heated in the jaws of death,
that will be the end of all the peoples life
And we all will be gone
Pre Chorus:
Chorus:
Solo: Both, Dahl
Bridge:
I got eyes of the future
I can see the end of the Earth
Someone will blow up the world
War, death and starvation
We have gone to far
It's time to pay with our lives
Pre Chorus:
Chorus:
It's time to pay the priceLife for revenge!
I have survived for my iron will
And for a reason I just can see
Allthough I feel myself sad and ill
Dark thoughts encourage me to get me free
I need my life
Just for revenge
Its worth is only in the justice it makes
Life to avenge
Life to perform a fake
In the dead shape
I escape
To fulfill my duty
(To) fake my false friends
To their end
Damning my wife's beauty
Changing my name
I proclaim
With a manifesto
That from this time
For good I'm
Count of MontecristoOne touch of your hand can open the heavens
abducts me to long forgotten meadows of desire
Strange, I never believed that one glance of eyes
Would be able to touch me inside like yours did
I always thought that something was buried
Long time ago, deep inside...
One touch...
...And there never was a greater pleasure
Than to stay awake for hour and hold you tight
To feel your silent breath upon my hand
As I push your hair from your face
And I dare not to wake you
For this would make me, too...I speed to beat the sunrise....
Weigh a million on the road to sanity
My heart my soul my love it's taunt
And I question each turn that I make in my mind
If I could be any other
Please! I'd trade make the devil my lover
Pullin' my eyes
Burn my eyes
And I'm gone... I make my move strong
I break and then I take it to the whore and you say
All the eccles in the world be mine 'cause it's got me,
It's got me, I can hear 'em laughing as a big scar marks me
On my own, On my own, On my own
I gotta go, I gotta go, go home!!
Nowhere is my home
I've given blood for years
Where has it got me?
Dead stop on the road to sanity
I've seen that best that life has
Rock bottom works for me like a
44 caliber dose of reality
It's got me, it's got me
I can hear ?em laughing as a big scar marks me
On my own, On my own, On my own
I gotta Go, I gotta go, go home!!
Nowhere is my home
I've given blood for years
Where has it got me?
I just got to go home!! Nowhere is my home
I've given blood for years where has it got me?
Not a damn thing
So I cry
Checking the pulse to see if I might breath
Finding out if death is my date
State of limbo
Checking the pulse to find it's too late
Knowing now that death is my fate
State of limbo
I'm home!!!! Go home!!
Nowhere is my home
I've given blood for years
Where has it got me?
I just got to
Go home
Nowhere is my home
I've given blood for years
Where has it got me?A tear to shed my soul. To bleed out my divinity I search for. Holding the spine of God my sour sedation pulled them away. So many things left unsaid my brightside faded away. Less than zero a shade apart from what I feel. Cold. We used to play devotion but I see your face. It's not divinity. Godkiller, Mindcleaner. The shallower I, the more I sink. And I will not rust away this time. So many things left unsaid my brightside faded away. Less than zero a shade apart from what I feel. ColdAll was settled from the start
Immaculate and pure
I invited chaos to stain, defile
And purity was no more
Demise of the crown, hereditary prince
I stand by the gate of what is not
The castle now has turned
To a hole in the ground, free fall
Bad gods glare at me
From the horizon line
These gods are for real
But maybe not omniscient creators
I live in a fantasy
And when I dream, let me dream
And never wake me up again
Choke on guilt
Near death experience
And I can not see
The light at the end of the tunnel
All that was is again, those I let down have forgiven me
Once more they have faith in me
All I was I am again, reborn, I am a child
It's but a dream and I hate myself
All was settled from the start
Immaculate and pure
I invited chaos to stain, defile
And purity was no more
There's a future looking bright
There's hope, I've got the strength
I've go a life
And a talent for irony
All is dead, all is over
Bury me under a stone with no inscriptionReturning at twilight
Out of a suffering light
As for naked fortune
I can color my mind one last time
Colors sweet surrounding me
The power of sun, believe me
Has low importance the grey in the streets
I am searching for
This day wakes up unreal
Warning electro-voices
Giving mankind the revelation...
You've got to give back all the choices
A liter of ink flows on the pages
From mouth to mouth, to the TVs
"Eat good, drink wine go for a run,
keep brown... this is your last sun!"
I pull your colors to mine
The fucking grass grows in this side
Sitting on the wet grass
Eyes to a sky without stars
As for naked fortune
It seems a whatever dawn
Just more queer
I've seen a grey world dying out
In the fiction-like silence of my city
Every person frightened by my smile
As in search of my colored worldI saw you, you saw me, you hid your fangs so well
I should have known better but it is hard to tell
In beauty the evil is waiting for possession
Deep inside reflections just a glimpse away
Your faithful servents, they bow to you
Together they're breaking the broken
We were set free, what is to be?
When its all said and done what is left to really say?
To be one turns to none now we are just yesterday
You speak in killing words, the kind that crush and kill
No mercy your pleasure to taste the blood you bled
The chase has ended in denial of glory
To trap and add to your servant soulsI break the chains of unbelief
Burden of millennial slavery
Forest eteral wander
Extending beyond earthly dimensions
Gods will return to their graces together with me
They'll find their oaken kingdom as before
I free my powers when yelling silently
When I fight...thousand of demons follow me!
And my strength and my spell...
And my beautiful pride
Will find you and wrap you
will raise the majesty to the skies...
From the depths of the earth deep and black
Through the forests woods and shadows
(It) will penetrate lakes and wolfish mountians...
On the wings of demons to the skies!
I denude golden gates of my Nawia
Shrouded in thick smoke of burnt bodies
I show my love...I praise the might
...And destroy with power of thunders
Constantly destroyI had to face you again
I had to taste you once more
Alone, I had to hit that wall
With you as my mentor
And watch my wretched flesh rot
Inhaling the stench of regret
Feeling life stripped from my vertebrae
Free in my toxin vortex
Peak hour
Sewer side
I had to face you again
I had to taste you once more
Alone, I had to hit that wall
With you as my mentorIn the daytime and in the night
I hear the chant coming from all around me
Like a blind man who never had his sight
Wishing he could see the light
Desperate ways, desperate days
Are the times we're living in
Looking out, finding out
Realizing that we're living in the last days of living
Chanting around the world
I can hear the voices begging for mercy - mercy
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Save us from our sins
Can't you hear the voices begging for mercy - mercy
Mercy - mercy
Mercy, yeah
Through a window looking out to sea
What's waiting for me
Destination I know the way
You can follow, you can follow me
Desperate ways, desperate days
Are the times we're living in
Looking out, finding out
Realizing that we're living in the last days of living
Chanting around the world
I can hear the voices begging for mercy - mercy
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Save us from our sins
Can't you hear the voices begging for mercy - mercy
Mercy - mercy
Yeah
In a chant from around the world,
In a chant from around the world
They're begging for mercy
Desperate ways, desperate days
Looking out, finding out
Realizing that we're living in the last days of living
Chanting around the world
I can hear the voices begging for mercy - mercy
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Save us from our sins
Can't you hear the voices begging for mercy - mercy
Yeah, yeah, yeah - mercy
Chanting around the world
I can hear the voices begging for mercy - mercy
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Save us from our sins
I can hear the voices begging for mercy - mercy, mercy
Yeah, mercyoh i miss the kiss of treachery the shameless
kiss of vanity the soft and the black and the
velvety up tight against the side of me and
mouth and eyes and heart all bleed and run in
thickening streams of greed as bit by bit it
starts the need to just let go my party piece
oh i miss the kiss of treachery the aching kiss
before i feed the stench of a love for a younger
meat and the sound that it makes when it cuts
in deep the holding up on bended knees the
addiction of duplicities as bit by bit it starts
the need to just let go my party piece
but i never said i would stay to the end so i
leave you with babies and hoping for frequency
screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy
screaming me over and over and over i leave
you with photographs pictures of trickery
stains on the carpet and stains on the scenery
songs about happiness murmured in dreams
when we both us knew how the ending would
be...
so it's all come back round to breaking apart
again breaking apart like i'm made up of glass
again making it up behind my back again
holding my breath for the fear of sleep again
holding it up behind my head again cut in deep
to the heart of the bone again round and round
and round and it's coming apart again over and
over and over
now that i know that i'm breaking to pieces i'll
pull out my heart and i'll feed it to anyone
crying for sympathy crocodile cry for the love
of the crowd and the three cheers from
everyone dropping through sky through the
glass of the roof through the roof of your mouth
through the mouth of your eye through the eye
of the needle it's easier for me to get closer to
heaven than ever feel whole again
i never said i would stay to the end i knew i
would leave you with babies and everything
screaming like this in the hole of sincerity
screaming me over and over and over i leave
you with photographs pictures of trickery
stains on the carpet and stains on the memory
songs about
happiness murmured in dreams when we both
of us knew how the end always is...
how the end always is...The evil one we can defeat him. Our mission make him dead and gone.
One from each religion assembled to take him on. They would go to the
ends of the earth and below to end the game and kill the Devil Deception
our greatest weapon the priest in black has joined the cause hell betray
his master and then we will strike without pause. Midnight all the power
of light well fool the master of lies and kill the Devil [repeat]
Kill Kill the devil. The game was on midnight approaching the dark disciple
made the call. The formless one took shape the sight of him left us in awe
[Pre-chorus]
Now that we've got you you'll die here today. When hell freezes over you will
stand in my way. Come hell or high water to rest you will lay. When you deal
with the devil there will be hell to pay. Blinding light came! The evil is finally
gone the impossible seemingly done. Still we must save ourselves from the
evil that comes from below. The darkness still lingers within us all
You've got to kill the Devil!There was a time for change
I fear it came and went
Who's gonna pick up the pieces?
Who will be left to repent?
The sun is burnt out black
Now there's no turning back (hey, hey hey)
Now there's no turning back
Yeah, I know you know
That we've been living a lie
Turn a blind eye
Until the day we die
Maybe we've passed the point of not return
Maybe we just want to watch the world burn
We just want to watch the world burn
Our collapse will be remission
A planet scarred beyond all recognition
Suicide in slow motion, is this the path that we've chosen?
Too cowardly to face this, we've got a fucking death wish
You want to play with fire?
Don't cry when you get burnt
You gave us life, we gave back death in return
The sun is burnt out black
Now there's not turning back
We will consume until there's nothing left
Remember us as a waste of breath
Yeah, I know you know
That we've been living a lie
Turn a blind eye
Until the day we die
Maybe we've passed the point of not return
Maybe we just want to watch the world burn
We just want to watch the world burn
I know you know that we've been living a lie
Maybe we've passed the point of not return
We just want to watch the world burn
I want to believe that it all counts for something
The writing is on the wall
It's hard to accept that it was all for nothing
All for nothing
Yeah, I know you know
That we've been living a lie
Turn a blind eye
Until the day we die
Maybe we've passed the point of not return
Maybe we just want to watch the world burn
We just want to watch the world burnWhen I was an alien
Cultures weren't opinions

Let them praise thy great and terrible name;
for it is holy
Odium
Oh Merciless Hatred;
Spare nothing, spare no one
Oppressive heat, intense flavour
From the pupil of the one-eyed mongrel to the distant depths of the
macrocosm
We are all waiting for the releasing hour
Praise the God of our salvation;
Hosts on high, His power proclaim
Odium
Oh Merciless Hatred;
Burn the Me in me,
And thus every cell of humanity.
May the essence of impurity redeem my soul
Unleashed hatred be my salvation and thy ghoul
Worship, honour, glory, blessing,
Odium, we offer unto Thee.
Young and old, Thy praise expressing,
In glad homage bend the knee.
All demons in hell adore Thee;
We would bow before Thy throne.
As His angels serve before Thee,
So on earth Thy will be done.
Wherefore He also hath highly exalted it, and given it a name
which is above every name:
That at the name of Odium every knee should bow, of things in
heaven, and thing in earth, and things under the earth;
And that every tongue should confess that Odium is Lord, to the
glory of Satan our Master.Right now
Let me take you by the hand
Right now
Put your lips at my command
Right now
Fly me off to lover's land
Baby
Don't you leave me at the post
Kiss me
You can feel it coast to coast
Right now
Baby, need your love the most
You have set my soul on fire
Only you can satisfy this great desire
Right now
Let the full world break in two
Right now
Stars can tumble from the blue
Right now
Just as long as I'm with you
Right now
It's the time and it's the place
Right now
For a ride to outer space
Right now
Let me have that wild embrace
You have set my soul on fire
Only you can satisfy this great desire
One time
Let the wine of love flow free
One time
Be the lover you can be
Right now
Come and give yourself to meTales from the spirit of gold
Hunters come in the night of glory
Prophets lying and creating gods
Proclameting darkness, my master fall
Break up point one thunder cry on
Forgotten realms move like a dragons
Fist full of fire and immortal kings
Earth and sea dominion without peace
Monsters and demons spreading in the air
A preacher calling for one great attack
Freedom!!! We don't fall out
Cry On!!! Magic forces on
Spikes shining under sun and moon
Sailing with the night corsaries
Came and fall for black steel crown
Sailing with the night corsaries
We flow in the wind on the seven seas
The purple horizon kill the waters
In deep ocean the galleys lean
Keeping reaches hide for the centuries
King of pirates slaving the coast
Cannons sing the tunne of the battle
Ships are boards with iron and fire
Rum is the fuel for ours desires
Seven seas
Distant skies
Old fortunes
Waiting for us tonight
In the storms
Crossing waves
Bright steel
Killing in the hands of bravesQuer saber?
No vou me preocupar com o que eu deveria fazer
Eu quero ver o fogo pegar
No me venha com o seu iderio
Eu quero mais um copo gelado de caos pra me embriagar
Tente me impedir mas no garanto que v conseguir
Uh
No tente me entender
Uh
Ser normal pra qu
Uh
Se a loucura o que me atrai
Quer saber?
Eu no quero pensar
Que aqui h limites e que eu deveria respeitar
Vou soltar meu canto pelo ar
Largar minha alma na areia e me jogar no mar
Enquanto o mundo incendeia
Tente me impedir mas no garanto que v conseguir

No tente me entender

Se a loucura o que me atraiIt's the same all across the nations
The ones who suffer the most
Always victims, always mistreated
Not even a sign of hope
Wonder who's gonna live tomorrow
Wonder who's gone? insane
Empty souls with a shell of iron
Life is just one big pain
I see the fear in their faces
I see the tears in their eyes
Never felt the joy of living
Never felt quite okay
Tell me how can they even make it
To another day
Save a prayer for the innocent
Their childhood's been taken? away
It's an anthem for the children
They're always the ones who must pay
Save a prayer for the innocent
It happens right here and today
It's an anthem for the children
To make them refuse to obey[Van der Laars/Parry]
Wait a minute, hold your horses there
What's the rush now, take your time
Easy does it, the hours the seconds they
They last forever, an infinity of time
Each day and forever, endlessly the same
Nothing ever happens worth, mentioning again
Significantly quiet as always
It's all we wanna do, we're killing time
Killing time
There's nothing else we'd rather do
Rather do
Than killing time (Just Killing Time)
Late a minute, an hour a perfect time
It doesn't matter now, take a while
Easy does it, don't have a heart attack
The brain keeps warning us, messages of kind
Patience is virtue, at least that's what they say
What's the point in hurrying, take it day by day
There's time enough to get things doneIs there something I should know?
I'm asking the questions so
On the other side I'll be
Hoping that you won't see
On these broken bones I'll fight
Reaching out into the air
Waiting for the dust to clear
I'm still standing
All that I had I gave away
I don't want to drown under a wave
Now you find me on my own
As I began alone
I'm the other side you see
All that you'll never be
As the walls fall by my side
Faces fly up in the air
People that I left behind
But I'm still standing
All that I had I gave away
I don't want to drown under a wave
I want to survive another day
I want to survive another day
I want to survive another day
I want to survive another day
All that I had I gave away (All that I had I gave away)
I don't want to drown under a wave (I don't want to drown under a wave)
I want to survive another day (I want to survive, I want to survive)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
(Is there something I should know?
I'm asking the questions so
On the other side I'll be
Hoping that you won't see
On these broken bones I'll fight
Reaching out into the air
Waiting for the dust to clear
I'm still standing
I'm still standing
I'm still standing)The earth you see
Resembles me
A cold and dark disturbing place
A world of god turned to disgrace
A new day has come
The suffering begun
The beauty you once knew is gone
Disappearing with the birth of dawn
Cries, as the searing sun appears
Through your eyes and deep inside
Fear, of this excruciating pain
You run to hide and question why
[Chorus]
A prophet spoke of this pain
But you chose to just ignore
You turned away, betrayed
The feelings you had in your heart
The seeds of humanity will be defiled
Until the end of time, you see
The visions you cannot deny
The destructive light of dawn
Each day, grows so very strong
Why can't you accept the truth
Your souls have died and
Your God has too
Blasphemy, a new life for you
Still you pray and an end
You can't comprehend
The sights you see in front of you
The light that burns keeps haunting you
You could not describe
The horrors that you see here
An epic tragedy
Lives controlled by fear
Sure catastrophe
As the sun drifts closer
Scorching all on earth
They never will recover
[Repeat chorus]
Unrelenting, this heat you can't bear
Life is filled with torment and great despair
The end approaching with every new day
As you face extinction and cannot be saved
Where is your God now that nothing is left
He abandoned you and now
Laughs at your death
The sun is here and the earth is in flames
What was once the way is now dead in spaceA crush course through your cranium
Trial and error, wear and tear, through your cerebellum
Hacking - slashing
Saw through bone, tear through gristle
Carve my way through muscle tissue
Cleaving - gouging
A lesson in pathology
I deconstruct your anatomy
For you - a premature autopsy
For me - a lesson in pathology
Postmortem performed haphazardly
Draining ichor sprays erratically
Forensick medicine is lost on me
I need a lesson in pathology
Though this carnal curriculum I pass
Suppurated blood congeals in a moist, fetid mass...
Gagging - choking
A lesson in pathology
Embalming fluid sprays all over me
Making a mess of your necropsy
Just another lesson in pathology
This is a medical atrocity
Screams echo in mortuary
Extracurricural necro-sodomy
A painful lesson in pathology
This will be your truly final exam
Butchered by numbers, carved up by hand
Dismemberment is par for this course of instruction
Chopped, minced and ground beyond hope of reconstruction
Scored, scoured and scarred with high marks
Along the lenght of unrecognizable body parts...
Gutted, butchered...
Your remains have failed me - there is nothing left to maim
I`ve learned nothing from this lesson, and I`ve only the dead to blame
Your chapter closed, it`s time to decompose
A lesson in pathology
I deconstruct your anatomy
For you - a premature autopsy
For me - a lesson in pathology
Postmortem performed haphazardly
Draining ichor sprays erratically
Forensick medicine is lost on me
I need a lesson in pathology!I see it
I hear but cannot know how you are feeling
I sense it but can't comprehend
He's standing there
Waiting for the news to hear, what's wrong with her
His feelings go way beyond my own
Only sense it, only imagine their fate
Just envision, the only way to relate
We try to
We say so but we can only imagine
We want to but can't empathize
She's lying there crying
For the truth was stronger than her pain
Her feelings go way beyond my own
Only sense it
Only imagine their fate
Just envision, the only way to relate for real
Only sense it
Only imagine their fate
Just envision, the only way to relate
Can we sense it?
Can we imagine their fate?
Just envision, there is no way we relate for real[coversong of DESTRUCTION, released never before!]It's springtime but I still miss the streets at dawn
And in the morning walking your bridges home
As I sit and stare at all of England's souls
I tell you something
I wish I was in Edinburgh
I don't mind being by myself
Don't wanta be anywhere else
Just want to be in Edinburgh
I wish I was an Edinburgh man
You can leave me on the shelf
I'm an Edinburgh man myself
I will always give you help
It's summertime but I still miss your skies so clear
Sitting and staring on a beach somewhere
I'll tell you something
I wish I was in Edinburgh
Don't give a toss about private wealth
And history just repeats itself
Keep me away from the Festival
And just give me a warm quarter-gill
They say you project yourself
But I'm an Edinburgh man myself
It's wintertime and i still see the cobble stones
Clacking over your streets at dawn
I was really poor since I left Edinburgh
I'm OK just by myself
Cause our miserable king won't protect us from ourselves
How I wish I was in Edinburgh
How I wish I was in Edinburgh
I was always in good health
I'm an Edinburgh man myself
I will always give you help
I'm an Edinburgh man myselfSee them as they rise
From ancient sands, constructs
They're reaching
Everywhere and nowhere
As they're trampling
On the archetypes
The listener warns
Tension, pain
Fear, violence
It reaches the limit set by
Ageless reason
Tension paints logic's hunts
Pain dances
Lies for the liar
Served without remorse
Like the gifts bring gifts
Altering view
Constant truth
Drained of spirit
By own will
Waruun, waruun
Waruun, waruun
Waruun
Drawn in the dust of morning
Waruun
The violence of the soul
Suicides upon the altars
Of evasion
Feared dissonance kept away
Nails on stone
As darkness descends
Can't find our way out of here
Yet it was built by you
Words on the trap-door
Waruun, waruun
Waruun, waruun
Waruun
Drawn in the dust of morning
Waruun
The violence of the soul
Tension, pain
Fear, violence
Tension, pain
(How could freedom become the cage-maker?)
Fear, violence
(What spoke to the mind-slayer?)
Tension, pain
Fear, violenceOh dear God
It is midnight in the labyrinth
The night is set to taint the painted halls
Moonlight is our cue
The candelabra flicker at your passing gall
I swear they're dancing just for you
The dead leaves rustle on the manor lawns
As a light breeze whispers through
The call of wolves, the owls lament
Our screams shall soon soar skyward too
Mistress from the sucking pit
All the world crawls lovesick at her feet
The stars are passing observations
Her voice is music, her legs go on
Shes got full orchestration
And been known to use it
But trepidation is a far slicker song
Amongst dull suitors
She is bright and razor sharp
A tree of woe up-rooter
A viper still at heart
Shes alkaline and far acidic
As sweet as clementines
This mistress from the sucking pit
All the world crawls lovesick at her feet
The stars are passing observations
Her voice is music, her legs go on
She's got full orchestration
And been known to use it
But trepidation is a far slicker song
Mistress from the sucking pit
Oh dear God
It is midnight in the labyrinth
Embossed by her postulant gaze
Like Medusa on a plinth
I am lost in her embrace
Oh dear God
It is midnight in the labyrinth
A peacock fan of sinful eyes
Swim wide across the room
This night, espied, your thin disguise
Does wonders for the sundered gloom
For all lit up the shades retreat
To dark Italian pews
And corners where great vases stand
Abrim with thoughts of naked dais with you
Mistress from the sucking pit
All the world crawls lovesick at her feet
The stars are passing observations
Her needs are dire, her rites are wrong
She burns with exultation like a fiery vampire
For desperation is a far slicker song
Amongst dull suitors
She's bright and razor sharp
A tree of woe uprooter
A viper still at heart
She's alkaline and far acidic
Fluidic, serpentine
This mistress from the sucking pit
The waiters pass in gilded frames
With glasses sparkling too
The ball tonight rows magical
Like the finest Venice threw
And at it's heart a mythic queen
Her skin of purest hue
Whose beauty is unquestionable
But whose duties are askew
For beneath the airs and divine graces
A slim tornado whirls
On the precipice of her poisonous kiss
The Devil dwells deep inside this girl
Embossed by her postulant gaze
Like Medusa on a plinth
I am lost in her embrace
Oh dear God
It is midnight in the labyrinth
Embossed by her postulant gaze
Like Medusa on a plinth
I am lost in her embrace
Oh dear God
It is midnight in the labyrinth
Mistress from the sucking pit
The wine has sat and breathed it's last
In blood red ruby where
I find you by the roaring hearth
A blaze of golden hair
Cascading down an angel's face
To pool about the breasts
That man minds have wondered on
But only I caress
And then I'm yours, the velvet crown
Of Venus in my hands
Fists rip hard the eiderdown
Desire firebrands
Every mountain, every route
My wanton tongue must take
To taste that once forbidden fruit
Before your blood-lust starts toShadows are gathering to put a spell on you
They promise you fame - You get hypnotized
You don't care that they fade the sunlight away
You just shut your eyes, shut your eyes
Something's gone wrong, can't you see: you're alone
Mangod - Show me what you've got
Take a wiff of the breeze, learn to live, learn how to feel
What goes around, comes around
Can't get off with impunity
Sun will show you, what needs to be seen
What goes around, comes around
Welcome to reality
Why don't you hear it: it's loud like a scream
The music you're listening to is full of fear
So many times you seem to be lost
The walls that you built from concrete are for real
At least you should feel: my eyes are unsealedWhen I repent that I'm the cover of the magazine
And even thought I know it's all what I wanted
I wish to be beheaded by a guillotine
Make me regret that I'm part of the scene
I am the man, I am the man, I am the madman
I ride the bullet of your everlasting fantasies
I cannot take it, take it, cannot take it anymore
Making me forget my dream
You cannot run, you cannot hide or fly away
Escape from yesterday, try to hide when you see me
Cannot run from the fury
You cannot run, you cannot hide or fly away
Escape from yesterday, try to hide when you see me
Cannot run from the fury
I'm disappointed, I can't get enough adrenaline
Like Yngwie said it, "You unleashed the fuckin' fury"
I'm crushing Slayer, Corey Taylor like a beat machine
Making you forget they're part of the scene
You wish you had nine to five instead of copying me
You do your soil work and yet you adore me
I said it in your face I'm your arch enemy
Stop what you're doing and run
You cannot run, you cannot hide or fly away
Escape from yesterday, try to hide when you see me
Cannot run from the fury
You cannot run, you cannot hide or fly away
Escape from yesterday, try to hide when you see me
Cannot run from the fury
Growl god
Growl god
I am your god, I am no saint, I need no fake it
I am the posters on your wall, that's why I set you free
Who is Elize? I have no clue 'cause all I see is me
Make me forget that I am a part of a team
I understand that you are hating my philosophy
The guys behind me ain't no band, they're slaving, slaving, slaving for me
I cannot fake it, fake it, cannot fake it anymore
The fury, the growl god, I roar
You cannot run, you cannot hide or fly away
Escape from yesterday, try to hide when you see me
Cannot run from the fury
You cannot run, you cannot hide or fly away
Escape from yesterday, try to hide when you see me
Cannot run from the furyThe sun has set beyond the western sky
And with the coming night I hear 'em cry
From the fear they were overrun
From the hurricane they were spun
The candle has lost its flame
'cause they play the final game
Out from the dust they danced apart from all
All warnings overheard until they call
The storm has turned the tides
All is changing from left to right
The gloom it came over them
Again and again
[Chorus]
As we stand here in vain we're awaiting soon
The falling twilight of midnight at noon
There's no sun to see there's only one moon
'cause it's midnight at noon
The sun has set beyond the western sky
And with the coming night I hear 'em cry
From the fear they were overrun
From the hurricane they were spun
The candle has lost its flame
'cause they play the final game
[Chorus]In the mist of a windswept plain
We carried the gifts that our priests had restrained
Chanting awaiting the gods of the sun
We're children of sorrow captors of none
A hole in the sky
And a tear in the eye
Of the god of the gate of the sun
>From far away lands we escaped all the plans
Of deserters who are left to decay
The gifts we obtain are placed in the hands
Of abductors to lift us away
They wept for our race
For the seed was misplaced
Their science was left to decree
Children of the sun the date was etched in stone...
Children of the sun the time is her for them to come...
Children of the sun seeking the enlighted ones...
Children of the sun be prepared don't run...
They're watching from their sensors above
They lifted us up and they taught us to grow
Ignorance runs from destruction in time
>From distant signs now Armageddon's alligned
A hole in the sky
And a tear in the eye
Of the god of the gate of the sun
Now their mark shows the white from the black
Soon the seed is in my mind
So when the comets they rip through the sky
Nevermore to see the light
Now their mark shows the white from the black
Nevermore to see the light
In the mist of a windswept plain
We carried the gifts that our priests had restrained
Chanting awaiting the gods of the sun
We're children of sorrow captors of noneSatan, I promised you my soul
Master, I gave you full control
Now I changed my mind
I want to be free
Judas, he had something to sell
Still you did send him straight to hell
You just made him burn
Nothing in return
Why don't you listen to me?
Show me the door, give me the key
Unchain my soul
Please set me free
(Let me out)
Out of this prison
(Scream and shout)
Somebody listen to what I have to say
To free my mind
(Let me out)
I have a vision
(Scream and shout)
Impossible mission
To clear my soul, let go and press rewind
Darkness and hate took over me
I live my life in misery
Sold my soul too cheap
Please give it back
Find it before it is too late
Give me the key to my escape
I am not the one, please let me go
Once more I'm being blessed
My horrifying days has passed
Now I am free to live my life
(Let me out)
Out of this prison
(Scream and shout)
Somebody listen to what I have to say
To free my mind
(Let me out)
I have a vision
(Scream and shout)
Impossible mission
To clear my soul, let go and press rewind
To clear my soul, let go and press rewind
Now I'm back to where I started
Fresh as one can be
I am just as broken hearted
As the man I used to be
Do I really want this weakness?
Do I really want this pain?
Want to live my life in success
So I sold my soul again
(Let me out)
Out of this prison
(Scream and shout)
Somebody listen to what I have to say
To free my mind
(Let me out)
I have a vision
(Scream and shout)
Impossible mission
To clear my soul, let go and press rewindI

[Lyrics: K.Lonnsjo]
There is things about me you don't know
There is feelings in me I'll never show
It's an eerie sound in my head
Why cann't I ever sleep?
Insomnia
Dementia
Paranoia
Phobia
Sleepless nights I lie alone
Watching watching on the wall
Hour after hour until the light of day
Then with the sun they disappear
It's calling for me in tongues I've never heard
Telling me to kill, telling me to die
Voices In the darkness of my mind
Like a child's painful cry
Other occasions they command me
By terrifying visions of reality
I hope that some day I will be free
Now I'm lost within myself
Growing more deranged by every week
I feel a need to feast upon the weak
Insanity wrapping its arms around me
Enfolded I become enlightened and see
The taste of human flesh so sweet
I can feel the power flow from my hands to my feetThis night
this belief
suicidal curse
the priest
are screaming in chorus
thirsting
the don't breakup the night
This night
a lonely scream
dies faithful in the moon
the naked wrapped
with thorny grass
three crosses
soiled the dawn
The priest are here
the worship the crosses at dawn
and the sacrifice
becomes the truth
in their hands
One can see the night in the fire
it's a crusade without belief
being strong enough to lift a stone
to lift to the sky
my blood...
Wich is drink in brain pans
it's a drink of lonelyness
the ritual of a crime
my blood
is a joy for the masters
the corpse
the gods food
So fuck my thoughts
rape my dreams
and cut my veins
and drink, drink
Die with meA thousand signs declined
That traveled through light
Translate this mystery
That covered my eyes
Accept approaching fear
And courage appears
Death is a certainty
It's growing near
Letting go is fateful
Uniting broken rhymes
That visions divide
Painting my memories
That colored my life
Somewhere safe and sheltered
Saved forever
Stuck in the light of day
Waiting for answers
A seed that grew into branches
Another page has turned, ended a letter
Come on home and return to the canvas of life
Shapes and boundaries
Will not disappear
Detangle the misery
And enter new spheres
Facing right and wrong
While waiting for life
Can't change this destiny
The curtain's blose by
While your leaves descended
Earth starts to unfold
Stuck in the light of day
Waiting for answers
A seed that grew into branches
Another page has turned, ended a letter
Come on home and return to the canvas of life
You're falling down
While my fortune's alive
We're safe and sound on the ground
Time to found new memories
The stains come alive where the paint has gone dry
You float above looking down reaching out to me
Depicting a beautiful scene that shapes divinity
Stuck in the light of day
Waiting for answers
A seed that grew into branches
Another page has turned, ended a letter
I'll come on home
I'm in the light of day
Questions were answered
A new life's arms are extending
The final page has turned, sending the letter
Come on home
And I'll sing you the song has painted your canvas of lifeBaphomet leads unholy lust In darkness
I only fuck Through eternal
searching for the true corpse of my lust
Black Mass and fornications near the searing lake of fire Unholy might doth bring Blasphemous Alterations
[chorus]Picture a man with his life in his hands
consumed by the death of his dreams
clutching at straws he dreams no more
a desolate figure, I am he
my agony fuelled by the shadows I ruled
I hide from the world in the dark
outwardly sane, I conceal my pain
life's touch cold steel in my heart
Wanting fearing facing life alone
I'm not hearing your reasons, so leave me alone
I'm on the brink of insanity, I think
consumed by flames of desire
the two-faced divinity a victim of tragedy
the flames now its funeral pyre
but the death still walks and the divinity talks
I'm facing it day by day
each glimse a hell I've come to know so well
see the idealist pay
Assaulted by the day, my inner world's grey-desolation
I'll take what I can though I hate what I am-abomination
alcoholic retreat instead of facing defeat-rejection
narcotic escape before it's too late-deceptionIn his eyes
The evil spirit rise
Turns to darkness with Satan's name
"As the time is right
Dead bodies rise up from their graves
And when the time comes near
Oh, I see the prince of glory"
Holy month
Sacred hounds
Under the hill
Do you hear their callWhat I know is I feel dead
Alone and in this world so cold
Emptying the urn of all that's left
Burning the candle at both ends
One less flame awaits the dawn
Would I walk right down to the end
And then push my soul right in
As I watch the remains of my soul
Lost in a crimson flow
Seated on the edge of all that's left
An empty shell full of regret
And the burden of life goes on
Praying for the shining light beyond your life
To put an end to your forever light
Embraced upon the sorrow razor born smile
So I walk right down to the end
And I push my soul right in
As I watch the remains of my soul
Lost in a crimson flow
And I watch the remains of my soul
My soul is shut, my soul is shut
My soul is shut, my soul is shut
So I walk right down to the end
And I push my soul right in
As I watch the remains of my soul
Lost in a crimson flow
And I feel that I might be dead
And I know it might be said
Free from this world so dark and coldYou never thought life could come to this
Man reborn to die upon the altar of war
And now, we stand to face the truth
This world now enslaved, bound by hate
In fear of life, now that the mindless control
As the flame of hope for mankind now burns away
For now, you stand alone to die
Whilst visions of horror infest your mind
Destructive
Man's lust for power
Infinity
A lifetime of war
Destroying your world, again and again
Suffering in torment, through agonizing pain
Killing for pleasure, only the strong shall remain
An arising slaughter, as hatred and terror now reigns
Destructive
The world now ripped apart
Infinity
A never ending fearMy thoughts flow out inhaled by others
As old disappears new arises
You could have a hard time adjusting to it so just
Receive, retrieve, and escalate
They feel themselves being released
Still there is something holding them back
Want to do so much more
I need to breakout from silence
Their acts flow out suffered by others
As old forgets new arises
You could have a hard time adjusting to it so just
Receive, retrieve, and escalate
They feel themselves being released
Still there is something holding them back
Want to do so much more
I need to breakout from silencea meeting of minds
a meeting of hearts and vibes
discuss the ideas
to locate some common ground
a meeting of minds
a meeting of hearts and vibes
built two angles
tangential oblique sounds
shouty bit:
the thread is picked up, followed, found - found
emit sounds to raise
an awareness to rise
erasement of lives
this value is applied
emit sounds to raise
an awareness to rise
to spark a process
and overcome the inertia
shouty bit:
the thread is picked up, followed, found - foundAll play and no work makes christ a dull boy
His life`s a misty lane
I'm waiting for the night -to come
I'm waiting for the spots -to shine
I invite all my friends to be part of this dream
Tonight something extraordinary is possible
There`s no right or wrong to our way
This day is mine this day is yours
Take a deep breath - it`ll blow your mind
Sample the moment - loop it again
Tape this day and rewind it
I know you never get enough ... ha... are you ready ... let`s go
Come feel the blood rush into your head
The sound it creates in your ears
We`re gonna dance tonight - for sure
We`ll get our curtain call - once more
Yes tonight we`re the boys with the most cake and toysTime is so heartless
time is malice
time is the aburd absolution
time leads me to disillusion
Here I find myself
the helot of the handman
fearing the certain death
and hoping for salvation
Ever and anon - flying
Ever and anon - dying
shattered thoughts, they're flowing
leaving you in the shades
What eve I'll create
what eve I will think
never I'll be meant
self-regulated punishment
A live from agony
dust-eating, blood-drinking crearure
sharing insanity
earth to fed up but open wide
Ever and anon - flying
Ever and anon - dying
still on the knee you're playing
but no god wanna fisten - to you
i fly a little bit, I die a little bit more - ever
I fly alittle bit, I die a little bit more - anon
I search for the wisdom
Left in the sand
awaiting the final solution
bringing myself to the end
Land of elover-feats
land of desolation
land of no believes
I fly for the unflating nation
Ever and anon - flying
Ever and anon - dying
Ever and anon - fallingever and anon - erushingWhere is the joy,
where is the bliss,
rest and satisfaction?
Alone, weird and suffering,
down on the ground,
pined for you.
Pined for you -
desirous
Hungry for your return
Return of feelings,
return of trust.
Or to let go of,
what I love.
The living wreck
Join the living wreck
To which place,
my trip is forced?
To the surface -
urging for a sense.
A hungry wolf
A hunter for affection
Behind me
These memories
Looking forwards,
There is ...
There is joy
There is bliss.
Looking backwards,
There was ...
There was fight
There was burden.This isn't quite the mess I Made
Walked right into this catastrophe
Watched this house of cards
Crumble on me
It's slowly decaying
This retched filth that I created
Never played my cards right
Just another bust
Lay my hand in
Cash it out
I'm the only one losing
Because I decieved myself
Check my vital signs to see if I'm still breathing
I've been passed down, Handed around
And I am broken now
So I always look to the brighter side of the sun
I can finally say it's looking me in the eyes, blinding me
Trying to keep my fragile heart on track, it's slowly fraying
Leaving me lifeless
I'm looking to you, change this mess I'm in
This is real life, This is my life
I've worked these calloused hands to the bone
Not much blood from whence it came
But I did this out of love
This is what real men are made of
This is what real men are made of (This is what real men are made of)
This is what real men are made of (I am what real men are made of)
Check my vital signs to see if I'm still breathing
I've been passed down, Handed around
And I am broken nowThe air gets thinner by the minute and I can't breathe any longer
This has lasted long enough
Let me be the blood in your heart
I will be at your side
Let me be your saviour
Let me kill the faults in your life
I'll be your saviour now
It makes us what we are
Another face in the crowd for some
A saviour to others who have nothing left
It makes us what we are
A saviour to some
I live my life like it's the last chance
Let's hope one day we'll all see what we're worth
It's more than the flesh we are on our bones
It goes deeper than the blood in our hearts
I'll be your saviour
Let me be at your side
I'll be there for you
Now meet your saviour
I'll be right next to you
I'll be there for you
Let me be there at your side
I'll be there for you
I'll be your saviour
Let me be at your side
Let me be the blood in your heart
I will be at your sidewe walk together
one as one
a new existence
has begun
and when I stumble
he steps in
and fills the gap
an evil twin
I follow you
you follow me
there's no difference to see
you get the blame
for what I do
noone believes you
your carelessness
will set me free
I will be you
you will be me
I take your honour
I take your fame
all in your name
all in your name
I kiss your lover
play the game
all in your name
all in your name
a dark companion
on my track
a dark companion
behind my back
and when I turn
- he disappears
i'm left alone
with nagging fears
your carelessness...
I take your honout...
always on your mind
always by your side
always close behind
THE DOPPELGANGER
I follow you...Ten heavy feet
Walks the blood soiled ground
With rhythm these
Five warriors march
No matter how much
The bleeding wounds
From enemy sword cuts
Hurts to the bone
The revenge they sought
Was taken in blood
No mercy was showed
No mercy was showed
They ignore the pain
That hammer like pounds
From falls, off slain
Horses, to the ground
No signs of weakness
No signs of weariness
Not even a glimpse
Of remorse in their eyes
They slew men ruthless
Fed the wolves with flesh
And now they leave
This land side by side
Now they're headed home
Five swordsmen who fought relentlessly
Their story will be told
Of five brave men endlessly
All sorrow is left
For the woman to bare
The children cries
They live in fear
No man was spread
No houses or farm remains
No christian woman unraped
Their church consumed by flames
Their steel shines red
With enemy blood
It sings of victory
Granted by the Gods
And as they return
Bleeding but proud
The horizon burns
And the song is ringing loudI'm telling you now, it's the only way how
Just thinking about it
I just want to be with you
'Cause every time I see your smile
I just want to be here with you
My feelings never change
They still remain the same
What are you all about
Let's try and work things out
We're going round and round
A truth that must be found
No matter what you say this love affair is real
No matter where you go
(My love for you will always show)
No matter how you feel
(You need to show your love is real)
I'm telling you now
It's the only way how
Just thinking about it
I just want to be with you
'Cause every time I see your smile
I just want to be here with you
Just take me in your arms
So I can feel your charms
Your sweet caress at night
To have not once but twice
I guess you know by now
Where true love can be found
Don't ever turn away
For my love is here to stay
My heart is waiting here
(For you to hold and to be near)
No matter what you say
(We can take it day by day)
I'm telling you now
It's the only way how
Just thinking about it
I just want to be with you
'Coz every time I see your smile
I just want to to be here with you
I just want to hold you in my arms
So we can feel secure
And I'll never ever ever let go
'Cause you and I won't know
Until we have a good go
So tell me you will
And my heart will be fulfilled
I'm telling you now
It's the only way how
Just thinking about it
I just want to be with you
'Cause every time I see you smile
I just want to be here with you
I want to be here with you baby
Oh, I need you baby
Thinking about it
I want to be here baby
'Cause every time I see your smile
I just want to be here with you
I want to be here with you baby
I want to be here with you baby
Thinking thinking thinking about it
Every time I see your smile
I just want to be here
I'm telling you now
It's the only way how
Just thinking about it
I just want to be with you
'Cause every time I see you smile
I just want to be here with youCe soir la Lune rÃªve avec plus de paresse
Ainsi qu'une beautÃ© sur de nombreux coussins
Qui d'une main discrÃ¨te et lÃ©gÃ¨re caresse
Avant de s'endormir le contour de ses seins
Sur le dos satine, des molles avalanches
Mourante elle se livre aux longues pÃ¢moisons
Et promenÃ© ses yeux sur les visions blanches
Qui montent dans l'azur comme des floraisons
Quand parfois sur ce globe en sa longueur oisive
Elle laisse filer une larme furtive
Un poÃ¨te pieu ennemi do sommeil
Dans le creux de sa main prend cette larme pale
Aux reflets urizes comme un fragment d'opale
Et l'amener de son corps loin des yeux do SoleilI think that life is not only this touchable, fugitive
Which, though so beautyfull, passes away so quickly
You used to stand behind me, I felt warm touch, heat, passion
I looked back to embrace you
And I saw hot purple, garden in bloom
Woman with a secret flower in hair
Every day with her was a secret unknown for me
And when I saw her scarlet flower in her hair
And a raven in the sky
I thought the raven is only a bad sign
And when you danced among the flowers, high grass, bloomy meadows
I rised to the sky to blow away stormy clouds
Watching her warming up in imagined flames
I saw as she flew up in the night - as a bird
I fly up into the abbys of the air
And I hear the voice of the woman, so warm, so close, so painful
I dream you stand behind me, I feel warm touch, heat, passion
I look back to embrace you and I see
Icy blackness, deadly nothingSince the time of the ancients
When gladiators fought
Turning movements of action to passion
Their life was a game
See the blood of the bodies
Spilling onto the floor?
How could people applaud it
It's madness it's all so insane!
Blood, through your heart
Never stops for one minute
And there you will find:
- There is no other way!
The arena's still crowded
But the rules take new forms
Some of them tread on stages,
Some others chase after a ball...
Blood, through your heart
Never stops for one minute
And there you will find:
- There is no way out!
Demons with a thousand eyes:
- Look at me and cast your spell!...
We're dreaming of Paradise
While we stay here in hell!!!In the age of darkness we are still riding through
Cold sweeping winds from the other side
The ravenshadow follows our path
Oh, mighty god - Give me power to desecrate
In the name of evil we are killing with power
Unleash the final fire and we conquer in blood
Now we have raised our swords in the cold northern lands
Heading for the battle with strenght in our hands
The aim is to kill you upon the freezing snow
Now it's time for war and your heart will be my stone
In the name of evil we are killing with power
Unleash the final fire and we conquer in blood
Hellish bloodshed in the north
Battles in the bloodred snow
Chaos is our killing game
We take your life, we eat your soul
The battle demon strikes again
I carve your flesh until the end
Chaos in the north
We take your life, we eat your soul - War
In the age of darkness we are still riding through
Cold sweeping winds from the other side
The ravenshadow follows our path
Oh, mighty god - Give me power to desecrate
In the name of evil we are killing with power
Unleash the final fire and we conquer in bloodWith fire and sword, with water and dagger
With the assistance of thunder and rain
With the open sky above I concieve
With the Blood and with pride I unchain...
Satan!
Into spirals coiled His Wisdom
Venture forth the Maskim Ways
Under the Sign of the Foremost Lord
Tread the Sands of the Farthest Shore!
...the Farthest Shore!
His Will penetrating the essence of my being
His Dream of Dark Majesty I share
...I Share!... I Share!
Chanting... Chanting... Forevermore!
Like a Tree, chained to the earth
But always reaching for the Stars
Through the sands of Sheol bleeding I crawl
And I know that I'll reach the Sea...
And His breath raving, tearing at me
Pulling me down it compels me to kneel
Cold Steel embrace, shivering Kiss of God
Stripped naked I lie feeling old, So old
From beginning to end I witness
The Names of the Dead
Enter me...
A morning breeze blows through my hair
I face the day but in my Heart I see
The Sands take their rise to bury and Darken
The land of RA! The land of RA!Fierce- steel eyed devils
For whom the sun never sets
Proud-Iron youth Of the noble cultures of the past
Striding- like greyhounds keen
Where glory beckons
Tough as burnished leather
And hard as Krupp's steel
The standard raised we wait
Our comfort- in readiness
The stoicism of the elite
Prepared for the assault at dawn
Elegant- obdurate hearts
A Volk of purity and vigor
Wicked weapons and armed encampment
A phalanx of spears- of dispassion
Bristling- furor teutonics
A steed spurred ever onwards
Action and instinct befitting
In the shadow of the sword
The standard raised we wait
Our comfort- in readiness
The stoicism of the elite
Prepared for the assault at dawn
Death's head empire
Stormgods unbound
The shores of space shall not define
Nor walls thrown up enclose our vault
And as if borne from distant stars
We rage against the bastion of
That which is still unshattered
Fierce- steel eyed devils
For whom the sun never sets
Proud-Iron youth Of the noble cultures of the past
Emblazoned- emboldened
We heathens wild
Stormgods unbound
Beholden to none
Sun wheels expansive
Through thunder and blood bold
Weltmacht oder niedergang
The heaven's charges struggle
Eternally unfold...
Stormgods UnboundI came here to see the stained glass
And God raising his hand in the temple's window
A ray of light is shinning through
The divine soul's prism in the temple's window
Inevitable events
Make me sick
I cannot pull myself together
I'm smashed to pieces
A ray of light shining through
I have my doubts
I came here to see the stained glass
And God raising his hand in the temple's window
A ray of light is shinning through
The divine soul's prism in the temple's window
I'm observing the autumn from hiding
I can see it in the temple's window
I came here for the smell of old wood
And warmth of marble floor
While seeking a way home(Jimmy P. Brown II)
The fleeting hours of mourning come
But soon pass away
The thought of laying 'neath a slab
Seems an unenticing gray
Life as it is, life as it was
The difference in dark and light
The only way to truly live is to
Let my flesh die?
Romans 6 tells me I'm a slave
A slave of righteousness
My carnal mind tells me
From sin there will be no rest
Because of sacrificial rights
I now stand not condemned
Once a slave to mortality
I now reckon myself dead?
I've reckoned myself dead
I've been entombed?
Knowing this, that our old man
Was crucified with him
That the body of sin might be done away with
We should no longer be enslaved to sin
We are not to live as the damned?The duality of pure rage and chaos guides my journey
Infinite search of despair and delusion controls the inner vision
The ultimate consequence of this sorrow
The great coming of faded memories, bleak and unconscious
My reigning terror has begun
The hopes cracked and vanished
Utter death arrives, cover me
Reaper of grandeur, honoris lux de necrosis
The nebular aura of resurrection makes my scars bleed
Tears of victory, for the day of liberation is in sight
For the time of revenge has arrived
The spectral empire forges it's returnMy life was brought into a nightmare, dark shadows surrounded me
Five times the pain of torture is buried deep within me
It makes me shiver down my spine to even think of it
Talk to me, what is the reason
I'm finished, answer me
Completely blinded by agony
Save me from my tears
Save me, falling down, angels of clarity (I am dead by anxiety)
Save me, frozen inside, angels of clarity (I am dead by anxiety)
I'm going insane, it feels like I am lost, the panic, the fear
The mind tricks are haunting me, is this my destiny
Talk to me, what is the reason
I'm finished, answer me
Completely blinded by agony
Save me from my tears
Save me, falling down, angels of clarity (I am dead by anxiety)
Save me, frozen inside, angels of clarity (I am dead by anxiety)
Leaving all tears behind (angels of clarity, show me the way)
Leaving my past behind (I'm about to fade away, show me the way, angels of
Clarity)
Save me from my tears
Save me, falling down, angels of clarity (I am dead by anxiety)
Save me, frozen inside, angels of clarity (I am dead by anxiety)
Save me, falling down, angels of clarity (I am dead by anxiety)
Save me, frozen inside, angels of clarity (I am dead by anxiety)Hellfire burns. This I can well feel. Before long,
all sense will be lost to distances afar.
I have been a witness to the
collapse of all respect. Without the wit or will
the humour of all this torment lies entirely, without exception, in the
pitiful sarcastic voids it itself holds within.
Laughter. And never it has been mine in
these moments that I am held captive
to. Withering is the correct attribute to describe my realities.
Sadness can, at its utmost state, lead to what I am at the
shades of blackened lights. Immolation.
MassacrI could come out of this irrelevancy. Nonsense, so much nonsense but never,
and hear: never! Never it is that to me.
Let me fall. Regrettably my obituaries can reach the starlit Ferniaah s, where-ever
they may lurk at whichever time and space.
I cannot but consider vomiting - sensing the fierce reek of the lack of wisdom
you exhibit. Calm down,
light the candles and consider taking leave.I know no pain inside my shrine
the world grows cold I lose my mind
the wounds inside that just won't heal
the pain now grows I learn to feel
look in my soul you'll see it's true
look in my soul I live in you
look in my soul and see my eyes... look in my soul
release me - I will rise
release me - I can't die
release me - now set free
release me... release me
release me - I can't die
release me - I can't die
I know the wounds that bleed in me
the scare is there for all to see
I feel the rage inside my mind
to crush the world and rise in time
look in my soul you'll see it's true
look in my soul I live in you
look in my soul and see my eyes... look in my soul
release me - I will rise
release me - I can't die
release me - now set free
release me... release me
release me - I can't die
release me - I can't die
bull... dogWe have been risen from out of the grave
For something's disturbed our sleep
Nuclear waste has awakened us all
Bringing pain to those Deceased
We don't know why We are alive
Our bodily functions are dead
Inflicted mutants rising from death
And back to a life We once led.....
We beg for peace, Dead and free, from the world
A nuclear leak has reversed the procedure
Of death the eternal sleep
Why are We here back on this earth?
To march and to stalk and creep?
We are the Dead and We want our peace
So put us back in the grave
Letting us rest in afterlife's hands
An intense mysterious place.....
We beg for peace, Dead and free, from the world
Birth by Radiation!!Since the dawn of time the clock's been ticking
Ultimately flawed, man could never survive
An unhealing wound in the side of the earth
A rotten canker that assumes it's divine
There's no divinity in man, just flesh and blood
When you die you do nothing but rot
The blind path leads onward to extinction
Genetic time bomb detonates - armageddon
This graveyard earth, disaster waiting to happen
A brave new world, with no more need for guilt
Freedom at last, break the chains of oppression
No meaning in the end, so do as thou wilt
2000 years of slavery
The time has come, revolution's at hand
A storm of fire, that will ignite the earth
My will's my own, not some god's to command!
I am my own god!
So now we reclaim what is rightfully ours
All gods be damned, nothing stands in our path
Liberated, eyes open wide we are
No more a race of fools, we are but flesh for the worms
A war continues in the name of destruction
No quarter ever given, no quarter allowed
Compromise a word with no meaning for us
In the cries of the enemy let justice be found
And so we stand in the light of a new dawn
Nuclear fires scorching the horizon
The time ahead become a time of rebirth
To recreate man in the image of man
Fuck you all, you won't make me believe
Your foolish prophecies only good to deceive
I'll kill myself before you make me agree
With a single fucking word you say...
You'll never make me believe!
Never...Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
I've seen the devil swallowing
Every single thing I've said
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
You think you're changing anything?
Quit saying anything
The world's in the shit and your children are fucked
The ones you think got you are out for your blood
Well, the lines are blurred and washed out with spite
So what exactly do you think you're going to change?
United we'll fail
Divided we'll fall
We're fucked, but you're making it worse.
United we'll fail
Divided we'll fall
Give up, 'cause you're making it so much worse
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
I've seen the devil swallowing
Every single thing I've said
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
You think you're changing anything?
Quit saying anything
Give me a break, you deluded arrogant fuck
Self-savvy prick
If you really believe in the words that you preach
Get off your seat and onto the street
There will be no peaceful revolution,
No war without blood
You can say I'm just a fool who stands for nothing
Well for that, I say you're a cunt
Kick it
United we'll fail
Divided, we'll fall
United, we'll fail
We're fucked, but you're making it worse
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
I've seen the devil swallowing
Every single thing I've said.
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
You think you're changing anything?
Quit saying anything.
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
I've seen the devil swallowing
Every single thing I've said.
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
You think you're changing anything?
Quit saying anythingJust one big family
Been around since the 1980's
Old school, we're living in the past
They said it would never last
A few dozen of the strong survived
On a mission, to keep it alive
Hell bent, ignoring the trend
While many pretend
We stand united for something we believe in
We are the army of one
It's in our blood, this is our life
It's why we're breathing
We are the army of one
Anthrax and Motorhead
Exodus, Slayer, bang your head
Dedication when the going got tough
Was never enough
Priest, Metallica, Megadeth
Iron Maiden and Black Sabbath
They tried to kill it, force it underground
You can't take it down
We stand united for something we believe in
We are the army of one
It's in our blood, this is our life
It's why we're breathing
We are the army of one
Volume blasting, drums are crashing
The guitar is screaming
Never give it up, never giving up
Right to the end
Sacrificing, no compromising
Is what we're bringing
Never give it up, never giving up
Fight to the end
We stand united for something we believe in
We are the army of one
It's in our blood, this is our life
It's why we're breathing
We are the army of one, army of one
We are united for something we believe in
We are the army of one, we are the army of one
It's in our blood, this is our life
It's why we're breathing
We are the army of onehatred is the perfect word
for everything I think of you
you were conquered by my God
you, prince of darkness
the arrogant fool
if given the chance, and the strength
to do all that I wish to you
I'd shout with glee (!) show no mercy
and rip the filthy life from you
getting a grip on things
tightening our grip on things
satan has been beat
focus less on his power
and more on his defeat
I'd start by stabbing seven times
for every single lie you've said
for lust of eyes I'd pluck out yours
for lust of flesh I'd split your head
for loneliness I'd seal your ears
for bitterness I'd burn you
for capitol punishment of unborn innocents
I'd take the sword and run you through
for bigotry I'd paint you black
yellow, white, and red
for opression of my bretheren
I'd tie a noose around your neckBest be prepared to meet your maker
Best be prepared to face your god
Justified unholy nightmare
Crucified of pride, you're robbed
No escape, it's too late
The hammer crashes down
Do or die
Cauterize to stop the blood flow
Still these tortures just begun
Eternal seconds keep on repeating
Charred retinas, a black collapsed lung
No escape, it's too late
The hammer crashes down
Do or die
All your fears
Won't match the wasted years
Of isolation in due time
I will ingest your kind
Quench my starvation
All present and accounted for
Hush, do not speak
For tonight I raise a glass
To the death of the meek
We are the chosen
And we bare the sign
Their weapons are useless
Our weapons our mind
No you can't believe
How you will inspire
Soon set to be free
Our blessed desire
You won't be imprisoned
No, you won't be ashamed
You won't be stripped of your language
Or your family name
No more inner demons
No more bitter spite
No more of the blood stained walls
Of your ancestral pride
Comatose, your eyes grow vacant
A paralyzing fear that builds
Stripped of your pathetic icons
Robbed of your heroic will
Artifact, your way of thinking
Your bones hang up upon my wall
Another fallen empire
The most self-righteous one of all
No escape, it's too late
The hammer crashes down
Do or die
In due time I will ingest mankind
Quench my starvation[Instrumental]Stigmatized, unlike anyone of you
I'm a stranger, anyplace I go
Scarred for life, down to the core
Never regret, never repent
Hate makes me stronger
In my personal war
Poisoning my blood
Raging within
This fire is burning
Under my skin
If I bleed, my blood is for my own
No futile creed, shall pollute my soul
Flesh of the weak
Feeds that machine
Never accept, never submit
Hate makes me stronger...
Show no remorse, But If I ever do
I'll hate myself, more than I hate you
Scarred for life, an open sore
Never regret, never repent
Hate makes me stronger...Te muestras firme en cada palabra
sin embargo alguien tocÃ³ fondo
tÃº juegas tan bien, yo toco tu piel
tus besos son todo el verano
Y maldices al viento que se llevÃ³ cada emociÃ³n
te prometo encontraremos un buen lugar
y tu corazÃ³n siempre busca amor cada noche
y tu corazÃ³n siempre busca amor cada noche
En este lugar puedo descansar
puedo sentarme a escribir
fingÃ­ no sentir y empecÃ© a morir
tu recuerdo estÃ¡ clavado en mÃ­
Y pude ver tus alas tan frÃ¡giles, tan irreal
te prometo que de ti no pienso hablar
y tu corazÃ³n siempre busca amor cada noche
y tu corazÃ³n siempre busca amor cada noche
Y no se puede cambiar y no te puedo encontrar
si fuiste un sueÃ±o, tÃº fuiste tan real
veo tu rostro en cualquier lugar
y luego te vuelvo a ver y secas toda mi sed
quiero dejarte pero ando mÃ¡s cerca
esperando a que tÃº me puedas amar
Y tu corazÃ³n... cada noche
y tu corazÃ³n siempre busca amor cada noche
y tu corazÃ³n (cada noche)
y mi corazÃ³n (cada noche)As the skin melts off
You want it even more
The link between the madness (repeat after 4:30)
In the crystal
Electricity shocking nerves
Hallucinations begin
Voices scream
Fix on the horizon
An oasis never found
Roller coaster crash
Refuse to realize

Crystallize
Devil's seed
Straight to kill
It wants to kill me now
It wants to kill me now
Refuse to realize
Choose

Devil's seed
Straight to kill

How long will I be restrained
It's appalling to think that
All my time seems to be wasted
Will it stop or is it only beginning
Here on the inside
My life is not over
I'm down again
Fake Smiles surround me all day
No More can I tolerate
These excuses or all this
Constant Pressure overloading
Make it stop, the fire's always burning[INSTRUMENTAL]Stigen leder hgre upp

Since I was released from goal
Seventeen years behind bars
Create a hate you cannot kill
Every time they scapped my face
Careful not to leave a trace
For many years I've borne the pain
I'm still alive but insane
Why don't you shoot me down
Why don't you shoot me again
Why don't you shoot me down
Why don't you shoot me again
You push my face against the wall
I didn't do nothing let me go
Check it out yeah, check it out yeah, check it out I'm clean
I didn't pull a gun I didn't kill no pig
Why don't you shoot me down
Why don't you shoot me again
Why don't you shoot me down
Why don't you shoot me again
Can't, can't see nothing, nothing that looks like cops
Badges blow my mind away
Uniforms just make me sick
Three weeks and two day's ago
Since I was released from goal
Seventeen years behind bars
Create a hate you cannot kill
Every time they scapped my face
Careful not to leave a trace
For many years I've borne the pain
I'm still alive but insane
Why don't you shoot me down
Why don't you shoot me again
Why don't you shoot me down
Why don't you shoot me againAs lightning strikes
And shadows burn
They come in the night
Now for darkness they yearn
The fear of the demon
Is coming to please
The thing got me begging
Got me down on my knees
I don't know
And you don't know
The way it's gotta be
You say that the times are gone
It won't be long
They take it all from me
I'll be waiting on down
It's foul and it's twisted
It's not from above
It claws and it slithers
It can't feel no love
It's crime is it's passion
It's hungry for more
It rips and it tears
Now it's reaching the core
I don't know
And you don't know
The way it's gotta be
You say that the times are gone
It won't be long
They take it all from me
I'll be waiting on downHere in a deadly maze, there is something hiding in the dark,
In clouded minds where hate and anger collide
I spiral into a grand illusion in a world of reality beyond
Then the secret of my inner self will reveal
I see tears in your eyes
I sense weakness inside
I will take you far away,
To the deepest of your dreams
Let me in on your stream,
To the entrance of your deep
I watched in disbelief
Imprisoned in a deadly maze
The enemy rise from within
Risking their lives on a dangerous search
With conspiracy in mind
Taste the hate within
Human weakness
A solution to the mystery
With conspiracy in mind
Now hear my warning
All you sinners on the porch
Sweet relief from the pain of longing
Remember this twisting smile
Unspeakable anguish
Heaven's out of reach
When mother nature will surely
Descend, and sleep for eternity
Please release the weight
That lies on my shoulders
Please release the weight
That lies on my shoulders
I spiral into a grand illusion
In a world of reality beyond
I see tears in your eyes
Always out of reach
I want to sleep for eternity
I see tears in your eyes
I sense weakness inside
I will take you far away,
To the deepest of your dreams
Let me in on your stream,
To the entrance of your deep
I watched in disbelief
Imprisoned in a deadly maze
The enemy rise from within
Risking their lives on a dangerous search
With conspiracy in mind
Taste the hate within
Human weakness
A solution to the mystery
With conspiracy in mindAre you born from the abyss
And have you sought the creed
That drape the shadows
Of your own thought?
Is your heart mesmerized
By the fire that burns forevermore
And do the secrets from the flames
Hold the mysteries over which you preside?
Reveal the infantile wound and regain strength
Free your spirit from those who lead in praise
Recollect the anger and the hate
For not shall your morals dissolve in pity
Righteous warmth accompanied
By deceitful tongues
Stay away from processed promises
Let them fear what you know
A malicious smile on their lips
To keep us all under control
Now it's time to rise and demand our due
The whores and their illusions left us bitter and cold
Drench them in their own poison, spit back the scorn of their ways
Out win their defect morality, and the words they pray
Consolidate the troops and expose the lies in their eyes
The ones deprived from the ecstasy that binds the neglect
Better lead than being led, earn any victory
For you stand superior above the plague and it's mass
The burden of proof rests on your shoulders
Are you born from the abyss
And have you sought the creed
That drape the shadows
Of your own thought?
Is your heart mesmerized
By the fire that burns forevermore
And do the secrets from the flames
Hold the mysteries over which you preside?Do you feel the night?
Bow down before Thee
Prepare for journey
Ceremony, hideous rite
Between caves, in woods
There is a secret place
Where sinister statue bears
This is your key to other worlds
Of no other even seen
When you spout the invocation
Your destiny belongs to Thee
Made one with chaos
I call you vested in rime of vault
Palfreys hatched from obscurity
Nocturnally ride for thirsty might
Myriads of ways lost in times
Tunnels ad infinitum
Blinded by impermeable darkness
Of the ancient ones
Pictures, visions made by night
When she was young
Journey for aeons and at the end the light
Cosmic vortex, everything lost
Wistfulness is the keyGlowing and blazing
In the wind of times
Ever lit
Searching and fathoming
The fire's arcane
Consuming flames
Sparks to imbue
Our very souls
Pervading
The very breath of life
Flickering from the depths
Of eternity
Never asleep
Never extinct
Not ever ceasing to gleam
Never sear
The sempiternal embers
Never profaned
Never fail
Not ever ceasing to refine
Never forfeit
Never faint
The sempiternal embers
The essence of being
Form of existence
Ever inflamed heart
Heart of the hearts
Burning so bright
Yet clandestine
Gleaming in the lair
Of the powers that be
The four mighty ones
The high kings concealed
Pervading
The very breath of life
Flickering from the depths
Of eternity
Never asleep
Never extinct
Not ever ceasing to gleam
Never sear
The sempiternal embers
Never profaned
Never fail
Not ever ceasing to refine
Never forfeit
Never faint
The sempiternal embers
Giving birth
To the glimmer within
Incessantly fostering
The flames
Glowing and blazing
In the wind of times
Ever lit
Searching and fathoming
Sparks to imbue
Our very souls
Pervading
The very breath of life
Flickering from the depths
Of eternity
Never asleep
Never extinct
Not ever ceasing to gleam
Never sear
The sempiternal embers
Never profaned
Never fail
Not ever ceasing to refine
Never forfeit
Never faint
The sempiternal embersI'm eternally grateful
To my past influences
But they will not free me
I am not diseased
All the people ask me
How I wrote "Elastic Man"
Life should be full of strangeness
Like a rich painting
But it gets worse day by day
I'm a potential DJ
A creeping wreck
A mental wretch
Everybody asks me
How I wrote "Elastic Man"
His soul hurts though it's well filled up
The praise received is mentally sent back
Or taken apart
The Observer magazine just about sums him up
E.g. self-satisfied, smug
I'm living a fake
People say, "You are entitled to and great."
But I haven't wrote for 90 days
I'll get a good deal and I'll go away
Away from the empty brains that ask
How I wrote "Elastic Man"Nothing can bother me, no ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
[Chorus:]
I can run a thousand miles and I'll never tire
I can swim across the ocean over and over
See, I'm fearless, I'm fearless oh,
I'm fearless and nothing can bother me
Nothing can bother me, no no
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Me not afraid threat cause I'm forever fearless
And when time they want my life hanging by a thread
Me nah let them face me cause I'm forever blessed
The [?] on dem nar like my plan to see me fall
Or rather crucify me when my back's against the wall
Good over evil that's why I conquer over all
My feet cemented in the ground that's why I stand tall
Every day I'm on top of the world
And no one can bring me down
Born with the mind of a warrior, heart of as lion
I'm a king that's why I wear this crown
And that's why...
[Chorus:]
I can run a thousand miles and I'll never tire
I can swim across the ocean over and over
See, I'm fearless, I'm fearless oh,
I'm fearless and nothing can bother me
Nothing can bother me, no no
Fearless
So when they're hating, I ain't hearing that
Threat 'em like Houdini, make them do a disappearing act
From the highs to the lows, got to stay on track
Grab hold of every moment like you're never gonna get that moment back
Fear, don't have none of that
Swear, son I love the fact
They do and they hope you fall but like the NFL they're running back
Sometimes it seems like chasing my dreams had me running laps
But look at me now, I flow like water from a running tap
So from here on in I think it's best you know
You'll never ever have to feel like you're all on your own
Any time you're feeling scared, let this song be what you play
Look yourself in the mirror and this is what you're gonna say...
[Chorus:]
I can run a thousand miles and I'll never tire
I can swim across the ocean over and over
See, I'm fearless, I'm fearless oh,
I'm fearless and nothing can bother me
Nothing can bother me, no no
Nothing can bother me, no ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
See, I'm fearless, I'm fearless oh,
I'm fearless and nothing can bother me
[Chorus:]
I can run a thousand miles and I'll never tire
I can swim across the ocean over and over
See, I'm fearless, I'm fearless oh,
I'm fearless and nothing can bother me
Nothing can bother me, no noThrow stones Even though you live in a glass house on your own And I don't sympathize or criticize Rumour has it you've got something to say You've got nothing on me Nothing on me Rumour has it you keep repeating yourself You've got nothing on me Nothing on me

Or is it more dead then alive, fashioned in a sinful style
I don't care - NO
Not at all
I care of nothing
So can you persuade me
I will for the dying..
No star for the blackened youth
The empyrean x-ray
Yeah, distorted on hell's use

No mirror for the blinded youth, or that fucked up truth
No hearts for the willing to live, from more than this world can give
I don't care - NO
Not at all
I care of nothing
So can you persuade me
A will for the dying
No star for the blackened youth
The empyrean x-ray
Yearh, distorted on hell's use

Just how lunatic, to have a nature so deceit
Bewail my reverie, a gambol untried
Lure of carnality and silence in forfeit
Animals, enslaved to pearls of fictionalized worth
Creatures, born from caves into simulated mirth
I'm talking, Idols of Chagrin
Born of possession, complacement in disguise
Craving and candid, as to defy the character's fall
The kisses you drain, pedestrian pedigree
What's thought is pain might be desire after allBorn to bow to the altar of the lord
Learn and pray
Watching you from above to dominate
Manipulate with this book
Caress an abstraction
It's only in your mind
Useless denial of reality
Diabolic existence
The root of evil is you
Centuries of inquisition
to burn your own mistake
Your eyes are the eyes of malevolence
Your horns are your faith and your cruelty
Your thoughts are corrupted with deceit
Honesty was burned at th stake
Agonize, brutalize crawl in disgust
the end of the truth is the beginning of your fate
The horns and the eyes of malice
Deceit is the name of the game[Japanese Bonus Track]Daddy's little girl's got a blood fetish.
Mommie's little girl's got a blood fetish.
Sweet little girl's got a blood fetish and she's trying to suck on me.Honestly I don't believe I've ever been this weary
My thinking is really tearing my whole inside outside and in
I wish I had the nerve to do just something firm about it
I'm sure I could live without it but now it seems that we begin
To toss an eye exchange a smile from miles apart it seems
And yet it's hard to tell what's really happing from dreams
Is it just that we've both thinking is this stuff for real
And what if in the midst of this all what if some would see
If this real it seems to me to be good ol' infatuation
What if I am wrong and mix the facts with my imagination
Knee deep in this mess no wonder I don't sleep too good at night
Yes still I've never felt more all right
Hey, were you looking my way or was I standing in the way
I'm like a moth hot for the flame I just can't help it
I've been thinking should you accept an invitation
Can't help this fascination and yet if you were here I'd freexe
I count the days 'til I'll see you again and wish you'll be there
And yet if you would come near again I'd get those jelly knees
So we toss an eye exchange a smile but we never move too close
And yet make sure to make it short we want no one to know
Can I help that I am wondering is this for real
Are you thinking much the same as I then you must feel like me
Until the two of us have come to terms with how to act from now on
We are gonna have to walk in quite wide circles 'round each other
Can not wait until the day when you and I decide
What to do 'til then I guess I'll be allright
Hey, were you...Fading moments
Fill up my eyes so wide
I don't know why things are Strange
But there's a will
And my way
Is Roaming light
Roaming light
Roaming light
Please let me buy
Another day
Please let me try
To find another day
I'm riding a wave
That's moving too slow
And it seems there is a void in my Life, yeah Life
But there's a will
And my way
Is Roaming light
Roaming light
Roaming light
Please let me buy
Another day
Please let me try
To find another day
Please let me buy
Another day
Please let me try
To find another day
I feel the need Down deep inside
To get out of here
And disappear
Please let me buy
Another day
Please let me try
To find another day
Please let me buy
Another day
Please let me try
To find another day
Another day
Another day
Another day
I've got to find a way
Won't you lead today
Got to find Another dayI prefer starting forest fires
To the company of others
Fuck acceptance
For this crap sake of breathing
Investing in friends
To be some freeloading turd
With a never ending burn
To save faceYesterday I reached my end.
Now I'm watching you leave me.
And today I feel sick.
I hear voices now.
This girl is killing.
Her face was pale.
She couldn't even shed a single tear
Over my lifeless body.
She doesn't realize because she never loved me.
Today I hate myself.
Look at what I've done to you.
See what you've done to me.
You sent me straight to hell.
Now is this confession pointless?
Was my love entirely useless?
Shell never know because I'm face down in the ground.
Underground.
Face down underground.
Tonight I killed myself.
They said a prayer standing over my body.
Rusty casket, empty funeral.
Is this confession pointless?
Was her love completely truth-less?
She doesn't care even now that I'm gone.
That night you left.
That night I died.
The air was cold, fit for a brilliant suicide.
The night was still.
The night you left was the night I died.Music by Sanrabb and Sarcana
Lyrics by Sanrabb and Dolgar
Night grows near, the everlasting night
That draws this world to an end
No longer a part of the darkly clouds
He stand alone in eternla splendour
The word became flesh and set tent amongst the living
Whilst I spoke to the dead but dreaming
Dwellers of the deep succumb of their law
Riders of fire, bringers of awe
Many a spell you have granted
Many a soul you have shattered
Universal your magic spread far and wide
In pain I praise them
Your dreams of Darkness
Where no keys are left within the grasp of light
Tonight we gather round
Each a knight we sacrifice
With the certainty of death we are still alive
The word became flesh and set tent amongst the living
Whilst I spoke to the dead but dreaming
Dwellers of the deep succumb of their law
Riders of fire, bringers of aweI'm a let you know, check it
Drop your guard, this time I come in peace healing bad blood, seeking foregivness and love, mad hyped to squash all beef and toy fuss, you rather turn your back but I'm asking you not to handle it like that, down to get right but you trip like I trip, both teams must come clean so hold up on your fronting, line drawn as I fight strong, this hate can't last lifelong, hyped on sights of my tribes bond together, together, get together, together, together, it never meant as much as it does right now, together, together, get together, together, together, it never meant as much as it does right now, now, now, now, now, now
Crews that used to be thight lose sight, who's right, hopeful vocals flow from one, who knows that blow by blows gotta go, can't talk it, must live it moment by moment, future depends on present connections within my section, pages of ages laced with days, split many lessons to learn from worse ones dirts, done, bust a face, pop a grill, na, I'm a chill threatening enemies, entering tensions, building together, together, get together, together, together, it never meant as much as it does right now, together, together, get together, together, together, it never meant as much as it does right now
We are growing again cause that's just the way you are, dig the beginning upon a place, without ever it felt from far, age sustaining in peace, this mockery your energy
You're eyes don't mean the same thing to me anymore, your words don't mean the same thing to me anymore, your face don't mean the same thing to me anymore, your smile don't mean the same thing to me anymore, this day don't mean the same thing to me anymore, this words don't mean the same thing to me anymore, you're eyes don't mean the same thing to me anymore, your words don't mean the same thing to me anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
(Anymore) [x5]
Together, together, get together, together, together, it never meant as much as it does right now, together, together, get together, together, together, it never meant as much as it does right now.Grotesque fairyland-astray
With fine falling snow
this myth now melts away
Through bloody archways
it flows upstreams to see
this heartache parching me
Burns my gaiety, tahng down it's golden mask
My tears ooze away on drifting soil
Through peace I stride and flee
Your musing thoughts caressed by fear
I hear some nightingales, they sing
My withered dreams to heal
Beauty's rose should never die
My grief lies onward, joy behind
But nature calls it to be gone
So tired with my woe...
Stormy gusts of winter's day
For restful death I beg
Ere that sun doth wake
Drown my sins'black memory
What freezings have I felt
what dark days seen in sleep a kind
Mounted on the wind your bareness
comes to touch the seals
Stormy gusts of winter's day
For restful death I beg
Ere that sun doth wake
Drown my sins' black memory
For never resting time leads summer
on my heart is slain
Withing this would which iron did impress
there will a river whispering run
The very birds are mute
The dread the winter's near
Their sings, they wet my eyes
Drown my world with weeping earnestly
Too hot the eye of heaven shined
Anon, the tunnel I will find
Praise deep vermilion in the rose
What tree or stone doth want a soul?
Light, thy picture in my sight
It's held within his hands
It's grounded in my heart
Disguised in bridal veils
Morning shadows wear away
How many mornings have I seen?Hunting for hookers
Immigrants and strays
Fear is lubricant
When he penetrates

As blackmail reward
Runs on fear and faith
Anger and remorse

ChorusTÃªte en arriÃ¨re je m'abandonne
Et dans l'extase inspire
Les vents lÃ©gers du bord de mer
TÃªte renversÃ©e je lÃ¢che prise
Et accueille le jour naissant
Le cortÃ¨ge dÃ©liÃ© des formes
CristallisÃ©es dans le ciel
Les monde bleus
Les vagues Ã  l'envers
L'ocÃ©an et l'Ã©ther se font face
Communiquant silencieusement
Sans que nous les pieds sur terre
Ne les comprenions vraimentCierro los ojos y aun te veo ah
Tu dulce mirada me inspira
Si nadie te indica el camino a seguir
Para que caminar?
Hacia donde ir...?
Aun no has nacido y ya has de elegir
La primera leccin de tu vida
Tmala como un juego mas...
Dan por hecho que sers feliz
Que las hadas adornan tu vida
No les importa si no fuera as
Pues ya crecers
Y si no da igual
crees en el destino?
acaso te crees dueo de tus actos?
El bien, el mal, que dilema...
Coge mi mano
Yo te guo
Duerme en mis brazos hoy
Como un nio mas
Esta noche podrs soar
Nada tienes todo lo has de pedir
Lo har tu inocencia perdida
miras al cielo porque crees que all
una estrella te gua...
Con unas monedas que les deje vivir
Sobornan a su conciencia
Creen que as
Te salvaras...
Pobrecito mo
No temas, no eres tan inocente...o s?
No dudes, la duda te har sentir peor.
Coge mi mano
Yo te guo
Duerme en mis brazos hoy
Como un nio mas
Esta noche podrs soar
Ahora duerme
Ya no llores mas
Que maana
Todo cambiara
Yo alejare tus miedos
Y los males que te rondaran
Ya no llores mas
Ya no llores mas....
Ante los ojos de Dios
Todos sois iguales
Unos poseen el bien
Otros todos los males...
Coge mi mano
Yo te guo
Duerme en mis brazos hoy
Como un nio mas
Esta noche podrs soar
Ensame tu otra mejilla
Me gustara verla
Eso le gusta, le hace sentir bien.
A m me da igual
Creo que eres de los mos
El se deshizo de ti
Yo te acoger
No te voy a hacer preguntas
No te pondr en duda
Se como eres
No eres malo
No hay diferencia entre el bien y el mal
Y si la hay para ti ya es tarde...Who's that calling on the phone
Leave me the mother fuck alone
I just need to get some sleep
I've been up for half a week
Watching night turn into day
Spending all my hard earned pay
On bitches, bills, this and that
Leave the phone where it's at
[Chorus:]
Reach out and torment someone
Reach out and show 'em you don't care
Reach out and torment someone
Reach out and show 'em you don't care
Credit cards are overdrawn
When I call that bitch she's never home
But when I'm swimming in the cash
She's always there to give me ass
Bought her clothes, fed her face
That's the price for getting laid
When I think I'm over it all
That's when I get that fucking call
[Chorus]
[Calls]
[Chorus x2]Laughter
Like thunder from the sky
Attacked by all armies
Deprived of their lives
Vengeance
Spawned by their hatred
Twice as pure as blood
Now more than ever before
We saw death
Cried out for more
the planet stood still
Machines were at war
Out of the ashes
We have created this image
Of superior beings
Alternating our existance
Breed as we die
This fanatic illusion
Spinning out of control
We died ages agoI never knew girls existed like you
But now that I do
I'd really like to get to know you
The girl's too young
She don't need any better
It's all coming back
I can feel it
The girl's too young
She don't know any better
It's all coming back
I can feel it
[Chorus]
She is beautiful
She is beautiful
She is beautiful
She is beautiful
The girl is beautiful
You're giving me rules and hints from all sides
And when you hit my back, you rub my eyes
The girl's too young
She don't need any better
It's all coming back
I can feel it
The girl's too young
She don't know any better
It's all coming back
I can feel it
And though I never know you
I look at your face.
To tell you that I love you
Don't know what to say
Give everything I got to the beautiful girl
The only thing I live for in the whole wide world
[Chorus]
She is beautiful
She is beautiful
She is beautiful
She is beautiful
The girl is beautiful
I ain't got nothing to lose (Nothing to lose)
Going to throw it away
And talk to you
She looks good
She looks good
And it's true
And it's true
The girl is beautiful
She is beautiful
I ain't got nothing to lose (Nothing to lose)
When I'm living one time
And I want you
She looks good
She looks good
And it's true
And it's true
The girl is beautiful
She is beautiful
She is beautiful
She is beautiful
Na na na na na na na na
She is beautiful
She is beautiful
Na na na na na na na na
The girl is beautiful
She is beautiful
She is beautiful
Na na na na na na na na
She is beautiful
She is beautiful
Na na na na na na na na
I ain't got nothing to lose (Nothing to lose)
Going to throw it away
And talk to you
She looks good
She looks good
And it's true
And it's true
The girl is beautiful
She is beautiful
I ain't got nothing to lose (Nothing to lose)
And I'll never forget
When I saw you
She looks good
She looks good
And it's true
And it's true
The girl is beautiful
She is beautifullate night at penn state, we exit from the bar
stagger up the stairs, and wish we had a car
cause it's a long walk home and pretty fucking cold
we chat with skins we meet, about the days of old
and bands from skating days, gbh and tedencies
black flag and kennedeys, and everything inbetween
into a crash course of just skins enjoy,
they hollered loud and proud
oi! oi! oi! oi!
so raise your fist in skin head bliss
so raise your fist to a way of life
we start our voyage home out in the bitter cold
and in a drunken state we travel up the road
slowly step by step we drag our drunken guide
up pulls the rhino yelling, "hey would you like a ride?"
oi! oi! to the albino rhino
oi! oi! friends we made
oi! oi! to the albino rhino
so raise your fists like this
in joyous skinhead bliss
so raise your fists like this
raise your fist now just like this
we reached our place at last and chattered over beers
and listened to stories of a skinhead pioneer
then said good bye and it was nearly dawn
i thanked them for the rideand they traveled on
if you're ever at penn state and exit from a bar
and stagger up the stairs and wish you had a car
and walking in the cold is what you don't enjoy
look for the rhino van and holler oi! oi! oi!They live despite attempts to stop and destroy our dreams
They'll wish they never raised their hands to be our enemies
Fight through crowded halls of hate between these tears aflame and show a love resting inside this heart of me
I know, crucify my heart because I am not letting go
I know everyone else is dying
Death no longer frightens me
I am a heart of gold
I'm not ashamed of my life and its legacy
This is right for me
They live, they suffer, they chose their destiny
They live; they prosper, in the end it's worth everything
Fear is not an option
I won't have it in me
Our hearts will endure if we sacrifice everythingJudged by appearance, and misspoken words
Not the content of one's character, just by what you heard
Have you heard of rumors?
Some clash with lies
One degrades another out of despite
Inhumanity
[chant:] how can one
Claim to be perfect despite the things he has done
[chant:] how can one
Be so blind to see, you're no fucking different than me
Different than me
Maybe it's me, I'm not trying to change the world
But actions speak louder than words
And all in time I'll learn from the mistakes that are mine
But I wont forget those mistakes done unto me
Done unto me
Who am I to judge, use judgmental words?
What matters is appearance?
Or what you heard?
Live by what you have and believe
Judge by appearance, and misspoken words,
Not the content of one's character, just by what you heard
Have you heard of rumors?
Some clash with lies
One degrades another out of despite
Out of despite
I'm human
I'm not perfect just like youI like the smell of a dead child
Whose I cut the throat
After torturing him a bit
For nothing but pleasure
Innocence bleeds
As the feeble lamb lies
Sadism will lead us to glory
The sweetness of cruelty
The power of free will
Make me go into raptures
Why should I have mercy?
Through sadism I come
I wish death to all children

Like Sands Through The Glass
I Stand Amidst The Twilight AirIf you were to ask for a favor
There is no such thing, just natural behavior
You see we're family inside
To say we're down with you, yo we say it with pride
Because to us you're real people
Never talkin' down, always as an equal
We're brothers of blood, we share the knife
And now we'll see, Who is down for life
But you front and leave us in doubt
We know who you are and what you're all about
Not sharing mutual respect
And Having to worry about stickin' out our necks
Instead of crying about the loss
We're thankful for those who are down for the cause
We live our lives full of rage
Keepin' ourselves down, mentality of the stone age
Negative emotions project zero
Worryin' and hating, you'll never be a hero
Reach around our back and pull out the knife
And knowing exactly who's down for lifeHere is so desolate;
Times, they are dark
Words ceas' - to end as echoes rolling afar
Empathy arises
whilst thou drapest this world in black;
The only colour that can paint my soul
Clad in the shades of night
Thou reflects the pure of heart
Amidst all the grief this winter unfoldeth
The thorn in my side - thou retainst
Thy breeze maketh me shiver
Maimeth me with its frozen malice
Thou minglest with the dense night
I hearken to the voice of thy winds
They are the saddest of all sounds of thine
Never will I take leave from thy haunt
Hast thou ever desired me?
I recieve no answer, thou letst it pass in silence...I am one of these dumb wise men
So I've much ado to know myself
I don't know how to get clear
with all the depths I owe
Thru the hour-glass they flow
I don't know the free and offered light
The lighting of my being is as bright
If I break the day, what would I gain?
To hold a candle lighting shame?
I desire no delight, no more delight
All knowledge is now burning in my eyes
You promise me blush life
I stand for sacrifice
I wish You all the joy that You can wish
Spirits dull at night
I think You are denied
The light we see is burning in my eyesLooming large like a favorite son
One more time comes my obsession
Like a mountain stream that ends in mud
I'm wading in waiting for the flood, sinking
You did
Left me hating, contemplating
Left me waning, slowly draining
Feet of clay that are stuck to the floor
And with vanity you want more
I'm drinking strength for comic relief
While I'm growing super weak in the knees
You asked me can I deliver
Like a monster crossing the Hudson river, stomping
Big fat kill
Carrying the weight of the world
In my arms
I'm biting my tongue so much it hurts
But at the same time I'm at a loss for words
The things I've seen should've left me blind
So it makes me happy that I'm losing my mind, laughing
You asked me can I deliver
Like a monster crossing the Hudson river
The things I've seen should've left me blind
So it makes me happy that I'm losing my mindYou smothered my beliefs to the point
of nearly killing me
When you gave me a name
to carry with shame
Show me mother, I've reached
the point where I'm supposed to say
Teach me again father,
yet for some reason I am still waiting!
Cast away now. Cut the moorings
I've lived through the resurrection
and can somehow say
I'm on my way now, any day now
Urged by my Katharsis
In my world there's no bitterness
I'm touched in more than one way,
so natural, so beautiful!!!
In my past world it was you who...
You who triggered me...
We need a burst of chaos
to become clean and purified
Neurotic cleansing disorder cease to be
Venting emotions, my demons are alive
Spiritual renewal, come come Katharsis[Music by Lord Ahriman. Lyrics by Emperor Magus Caligula]
They howl in the night,
They are the children of the damned.
Cursed to live in darkness,
With a soul and a heart of ice.
Heart of ice.....
As nightfall sets in, they crawl out from their caves.
Where they been hiding from the sunlight rays,
Until the moon calls out their names.
The endless search for fresh blood.
The never-ending hunger, burns their inside.
Like a flame from hell, never easing pain.
They are the living shadows, cursed to live in black.
You can see the reflection of the moon, in their empty eyes.
Look deep in their eyes, as the burning flames of hell arise.
Burning in their empty souls.
They move in the night, like a pack of wolves.
Hunting down their victims, there is no escape.
As nightfall sets in, they crawl out from their caves.
Where they been hiding from the sunlight rays,
Until the moon calls out their names.
The never-ending hunger, burns their inside.
Like a flame from hell, never easing pain.
They howl in the night,
They are the children of the damned.
Cursed to live in darkness,
With a soul and a heart of ice.Your numbers up you have to go
The system say's "I told you so"
Stocked in a train like a truckload of cattle
Sent off to slaughter in a useless battle
Thousands of us sent off to die
Never really knowing why
Fuck the system they can have me
I don't need society
I don't need society
Before you know it you're in the corp
Grab your gear boy you're off to war
Stocked in a train like a truckload of cattle
Sent off to slaughter in a useless battle
Thousands of us sent off to die
Never really knowing why
Fuck the system they can have me
I don't need society
I don't need society
You were an apple pie clone living at home
Never straying to far from your phone
Now son make it through enemy lines
You must hurry there's not much time
Made it sir. They're gonna drop the bomb
No time to evacuate, they'll call our moms
Fuck the system, they can't have me
I don't need society
I don't need societyPlay dead again. It just might stop before the end.
If I pretend you may not see the pain I'm in.
So close to me, can't tell what I'm supposed to be.
Don't stop to breathe, can't bear to think what you might see.
This tourniquet, these blessed hands around my head
So I can keep from...
Bleeding.
I've got to find a way to stop before it starts.
Finding its way through my veins right to my heart.
I never thought it something everyone could see.
And it kills within me.
[Chorus]
I won't, I won't leave without a trace.
I won't be erased.
It's in my head, I can't forget what you once said.
The words I read, the fractured soul that I can't mend.
Right here with me, killing the void I used to be.
Remembering through fading sparks of memory.
Two broken hands lift seven wounds and fight to stand
To keep the lungs from..
Caving.
I've got to find a way to stop before it starts.
Finding its way through my veins right to my heart.
I never thought it something everyone could see.
And it kills within me.
[Chorus]
Turning. It's moving. Escaping right through me.
I care not. I bleed not. For you I believe not.
I play dead.(An Angel came to me and said: 'O pittable,
foolish young man! O horrible! O dreadful
state! Consider the hot, burning dungeon
thou art preparing for thyself to all
Eternity, to which thou art going in such career.')
What a nice symphony!
Where are you singing from?
I heard your voice -
Perhaps, your lips still speak these magic words:
"LET US DANCE!"
I'm looking for your place -
That godforsaken house
Far more than too long...
Ah...
I was knocking at your door -
I was sticking in your brain
Don't you sleep like a log -
Don't you hear as I am screaming?
The messenger of greed
Who's flying on the wings
He made of glass...
Ha...
You awoke 'cause you were born for the dance -
So let us dance
Dance right now...
And shake your bones
Everywhere as you'll be able...
There!
Bring your immortal soul over masquerade,
Dance and you'll be never searching for the answers.
Your life's just a fiction, just an endless dance...
Your days do bang so loud - Have you known them all?
Tell me what do you need for this sleepy waltz
Tell me what you'd like to see at the celebration?
You may do all of the things your daemon wants -
Dance - there's only one way for the folks and the nations.
I am your existence;
I am supposed lust for life
Have you never known me?
Didn't you guess who am I?
Do you really fear that all your might will fade away?
Wait until it will have done - this satanic masquerade.
"I'd like to buy and I'd like to sell -
There is my might to build and dwell -
That does give me all what I do need -
I'd like to buy and I'd like to build
I'd like to have the keen sight
'Cause I want to get an eyeful
Of all thoughts are going on
Through the darkness and the light."
You become rich and clever with every passing day.
You afraid to think that someone can devastate all that you've got...
And whilst you're going to ask that SWINE -
It will have spoken no word, will be completing this End of the World
And what (are you going to speak) about some food for the second flood?
What about house that made of wood?
What about bed and fireplace?
What about wife and child in lace?
What about dead before they cooled?
What about quest HOW- D'YE - DO?
What about breakfast, what about lunch?
What about what about what about SO MUCH?Leaft me around
And nurse my broken wing
with all the promises
you can never honour
I just don't care enough
to react to vain attempts
sent only to pepetuate on selfish little world
you wont see what I've become
You'll wait and watch and still
your only let down
a violent little reaction
struggling only to keep myself alive
now here I stand
for nothing no one at all
I lead you down
begging to touch you in the cold
you give me a reason
I will not be the one
Through all the nonsense
There is a constant
you wont see what I've become
You'll wait and watch and still
your only let down
cause this felling
has dawned on the face of you
a violent little reaction
struggling only to keep myself alive
you wont see what I've become
cause this felling
has dawned on the face of you
a violent little reaction
struggling only to keep myself alive(Music: Steer, Regadas)

I'll Make Sure We Have lots of Room
I'll Make Sure No One Gets Out Alive
I'll Make Sure Nothing Here Can Survive
Public Executions Held Daily
I'll Shut Down all the Pharmacies
To Promote the Spread of Disease
A New Virus in the Water Supply
No Food No Shelder Everyone Dies
You Have Been Chosen for Sterilzation
By the Department of Depopulation
Put me in Charge of Population Control
I'll Free all the Prisoners on Death Row
Put them in Charge of Population Control
Police let Blood Flow on Your Shitty City StreetsOh, you graceful eagle
That soar in the air,
How I enjoy your chainless life
You are calling from your sky
Living under the sun,
Just riding the winds up high.
Your cliff is your castle,
You're nature's truly royal,
Asking in brown and grey,
Look down on the foolish man
Competing with time,
Chasing his precious day
You're flying on winds of serenity
Into the blinding light.
You're the majesty of freedom
Living life at its height
You're flying on wings of serenity
You're soaring above the ground
You are the majesty of freedom
Tranquillity is your crown
Oh, please let me follow you
On you're journey to the clouds
Take me up on your wide wings
And show me your world
We will cross the skies
New horizons we'll see,
Cross the slumbering landscapes
And disappearing into the dawnTear away from my life force
Torn away from my existence
Take me away from all reason
Tearing away
How does a soul solidify, and create destination
With ecstasy comes agony how do I find a balance
Must, must decide, must decide, sacrifice
Emotions set on high, living and dying by the sword
weight of risk is great,I am ready for the passing
Turn the key, push the gate
Step by step, inch by inch
Now is the time, my day is near
Encompassing my inner fabric
Taking shape, will I approve of my current evolution
It takes two halves to make a whole
How can I be complete if I'm hollow
I must expand my life, for this I give my sacrifice
Can I travel this path alone...
No...
Travel this path alone
Counting down all my days, until my future does unfold
Will you on, on to me, or just let go
Tear away from my life force
Tear away from my exisitence
Ripping away from my lifeforce
Tearing away
Know where my faith exists, undying and forever
Believe the words I script, invest all of your worth
Strengthen your sanity, it will reward in due time
In due time
Why?Some people say that love does not last long.
I say those people are completely wrong.
With every single day I love you more.
Each day our love grows stronger than before.
I always pray for you: with all my heart I pray.
I pray your sunny smile will never fade away.
With all my soul, with all my utter tenderness
I ask the Lord to fill your life with happiness!
Chorus:
I still kiss your lips and hair while you are asleep.
My eternal love for you is strong and deep.
Regardless of the hard time that we have been through
I thank God for every single day
Ill thank God for every single day with you!
Whenever it seems like everything goes wrong,
Remember, our love will keep us strong.
No matter where you go and what you do.
Ill never leave your side: Ill stand by you
Well stay together and well never go astray,
Well weather any storm: well always find a way.
No one can take away what's given from above.
Time has no power over everlasting love!Over yonder far from time
Lived a maid widowed by war
Astray her home burdened her life
A netherland of discontent
Free of joy and bliss
Believe in nothing hard to see
Believe in everything this world is free
Listen to your heart never forget
Tales of yore trust them yet
On a day gloomy and grey
Through the flickering lights of the woods
Shimmering knights of majesty
Believe in nothing hard to see
Believe in everything this world is free
Listen to your heart never forget
Tales of yore trust them yet
The warriors aroused by weariness
Ascended the porch an innocent soul
Believe in nothing hard to see
Believe in everything this world is free
Listen to your heart never forget
Tales of yore trust them yet
Believe in nothing hard to see
Believe in everything this world is free
world is free - world is freeA Broken Glass
A broken glass proves your words worthless
running and hiding from the reality
Until death do you part
do you not know the commitment that you made
One broken heart
two broken lives
and now look
just look what you have become
Your shattered lives are breaking my heartIf I allow the light to leave my eyes, I will never see again.
The thoughts disintegrate into cognitive pollution.
Abandoning my body, renouncing my existence.
Show me the meaning of happiness.
Trapped inside this nightmare, but I haven't slept for days.
I am a slave, a slave to what I cannot see.
Are we being strung along or are we just strung out?
The quest to be clairvoyant: You are your own black hole.
How much longer do I really have when I wish every breath would be my last?
Your words like rope, tied around my throat. Remove the earth beneath me.
Watch my spirit sink.I am a self contained machine
Prefabricated, no sympathya
My mind laid bare to world depression
My man made soul in isolation
I have been scraped by humanity
Darkness confines every injury
I must make witness with bitterness
Concealed existence of countless dead
I'm not a walking form of waste
Amassed illusion burning disgrace
I have been scraped by humanity
Darkness confines every injury
Deprivation has been forced on me
I am losing all of my memories
My reality
My heart is a dark shade of metallic dust
My heart is a dark shade of metallic dust
I have been scraped by humanity
Darkness confines every injury
Deprivation has been forced on me
I am losing all of my memories
They are nothing more to me than a dream
I reject all visions of reality
Visions of reality
RealityJust take it in stride
One breath and I think I feel free
All we can do is strive for the best thoughts
The best feelings, the warm fuzzy feeling
As a child, I believed these all came to me
Due to the process of living
Grab the wheel right now and make this life yours
Walk with me, leave your disgusting fever
Take this life, make it yours
Forgotten are the days of wandering pointlessly
In my dreams
Carry me with your wingsBlack was the night when I did surrender
I did give in to my weakening side
Now that I'm empty, my dreams once were many
Souls bid a cry to unleash the divine
When you think there's no way out
And all you see collides
Hope will in the end chase all your fears away
Fighting the source was not recommended
Trails of a wish were the hope to survive
Skins full ablazing, release crystal gazing
All of it led to a deeper demise
When you think there's no way out
And no one comprehends
Hope will show your smile again
What I left behind,
Another night of weary dreams
What's been left behind,
Another time where days of late are far away
Far away
Losing my reasons, no lies to believe in
Left the obscure to the means of escape
Core has been shaking, there's no more pain to break me
Time has commenced and I long to awake
When you think there's no way out
Leave everything behind
You can live your life anew
What I left behind,
Another night of weary dreams
What's been left behind,
Another time where days of late are far away
Far away
Dark days behind me
Won't ever break me now
All that left behind
Another night of weary dreams
What's been left behind
Another time where days of late are far away
Far away
Just another night
In another time[Instrumental]Las tinieblas parecen no dispersarse jams
que el mundo y Dios en mi contra estn
mi corazn grita desesperado,
desgarrndome, lastimndome cada vez ms.
Respiro y no me alcanza,
y tengo la necesidad de que algo
ocupe ese espacio vaco
y me haga sentir que an valgo.
La voluntad no me obedece
y la oscuridad se apodera de mi pensamiento
mi grito se estremeci en el aire
transformndose en un spero lamento.
Tan desolado y amargo se me presenta el camino
con tantas lgrimas derramadas por la muerte
que a ricos y humildes lleva
y que algn da pasar por m.
Tal vez es propio del hombre buscar a todo una explicacin,
que: , que 
pero solo quien lo padece
sabe como se siente el dolor
Pero tambin s que el tiempo
cicatrizar las heridas
aunque las marcas queden en el recuerdo
hasta el fin de mis das.There is no afterlife
We all just decompose
No Heaven's pearly gates
Just tags upon our toes
A slow putrescence
From the time the life is shorn
Feast for the maggots
Reborn
Wet and adipocerous
Our flesh turns in to wax
Enter hypostasis
Pale skin discolored black
Regeneration
When life has adjourned
Insect infestation
Our favors are returned
When from this world we are unbound
We're food for the worms
When they plant me in the ground I'm
Food for the worms
The reaper beats at the gate of every man
Lies fill the Bible, Tanakh and Quran
It matters not which dogma you believe
Our bodies are left to rot like fallen leaves
The circle of life it marches on
We fertilize the ground we walk upon
Feast for the vultures' all that's left
While hope spring eternal for the bereft
The throes of rigor mortis
Forensic certainty
Heaven, Olam Ha-Ba
Fairy tales of lunacy
We're vessels for the larvae
Not vessels for the soul
Transform to liquefaction
Make all nature whole
Food for the worms[Lyrics: M. Schulman]
Ashes to ashes - Dust to dust
Our time will come - We will never forget
Supreme destruction
A neverending nightmare
Final oblivion
Deep traced hatred
Mass extinction
Enslaved existence
Summon the power
Malevolent rapture awaits
Bloodline - Dark realms of death
Bloodline - The sphere of anguish and pain
Eternal damnation
Impending silence
Infernal suffering
Unleash the agony
Total downfall
External fear
Trapped desolation
Welcome to armageddon
Bloodline - Dark realms of death
Bloodline - The sphere of anguish and pain
Bloodbath - Hellfire - Annihilate - Devastate
Exterminate the foolish ones, execute the unusable
The rise and glory of disgrace and terror
Dominating pleasure of a immortal elite
Lead the weak to a prevailing paradise
Totalitarian genocide has finally begun
[Lead: Wiklund / Kjellgren]
Supreme destruction
A neverending nightmare

burning higher and higher
fear our wake of devastation
hear our hatred elevated
we are the fire of offering[Instrumental]The might of chaos descends as we join the fight
Against our common foe the jaws of fate
War unleashed the stench of spells
As we thrust our fists into the face of hell
Chaos descends
The final battle begins left or right who decides?
Their mortal terror touches the sky
The beasts of hell blacken heaven's eye
We shout our fear to a soulless sky
Chaos descendsThe sound of silent voices surveying my thoughts
Regularity defining perfection
Neither sorrow nor contentment
Whispering emptiness, frail words collapse
My weight only stirs the ground
How long can I hold your hand as you walk over graves
You search for tears of compassion
Yet find the comfort of winter
Reassurance dead like the falling leaves
Losing hope in your unchanging ways
All of my strength cannot save you
If you are unwilling to help yourselfAt dusk through wheat field
Through the olive groves
And vineyards
Insects like aeroplanes
Fly past the strolling man
Crackling spike plant
Hovering hawk
All on the ground alive
Take a swig of moonshine
Listen to the madness whine
Andalucian
Andalucian
Sunflowers
Bulls and purple bees
Listen to the lone wolf
Strolling
Take a swig of moonshine
Taste its heady wine
Andalucian
Andalucian
Sunflowers
Bulls and purple bees
Lone wolf howling
Lone wolf howling
Strolling wolf
Strolling wolf

The morning star has long since gone
The sun is high in the sky
Shadowless a figure stands
Stranded on venus sands
Up in the blue and circling
The seabirds watch and wait
For movement of a certain kind
Down on their dinner plate
Where children played
A flower lays
Pulled and torn up by its roots
And where it stood the empty space
Just screams...................................................................
Down on the flats baby turtles race
For safety of the big deep
And white caps come crashing in
Indifferent to tender flesh
Shriek of attack then moving in
A raucous clash a gourmet din
Of cruel gull beaks and tearing skin
Screaming...........................................................................
Lit by the evening star at venus sands
Against a blood orange sky
There's a shadow of a figure prone
Abandoned and all alone
Venus sandsYou are blind, deny the sun and light
Whose are the objections, from where come the doubts
Evidence of infinity
Procreation of the wicked
Twist of the known
Procreation of the wicked
Serenades of opposition, Absurdity, humans fate and hope
True reflections of community, Procreation of the gods and lords
Evidence of infinity
Procreation of the wicked
Twist of the known
Procreation of the wicked
Cain and Abel's love and death, Love and hate is what we are
Dagger and grail are- Fallen of the altar
Evidence of infinity
Procreation of the wicked
Twist of the known
Procreation of the wicked
"Mysteries of perversity"
"I've killed this old man, because he limped
I've done it because he shouldn't have to do it"
If god raised the abyss, you'd procreate your own
Abolism of death is, Abolism of life
Evidence of infinity
Procreation of the wicked
Twist of the known
Procreation of the wicked[Instrumental]Pain, plague an pestilence shall sweep through your sight
Grim is the truth that hides behind the fading light
The eyes of the beholder stares empty silent and cold
For the deeds of the dark ones are fearful to behold
With liftened dreadful swords we swear allegiance to our lord
We're the unhallowed usurpers of the throne
Dusk will bring the gathered ones upon the feeble men of god
Superior mighty warriors of pure unhallowed blood
Shoulder to shoulder they reign in the darkest of nights
Together at the edge of time, brought forth to slay the light
Thy majesty, our majesty
Sole superior evil itself
We'll be your instrument
And the blade of their damnation
So futile humas on the knees for the satanized
Burning high at the stakes with the love of Christ
Do not rest in peace, may your souls all burn black
Your sons and daughters I will kiss....with a poisoned smile
Sing out the pain of your roots that you cannot deny
And we'll crush your worthless prayers of the weak forgotten
Lie
The apocalypse is here, oh fools of the withering sky
Encounter darkness as you fall into the endless fire
The jaws of darkness, open wide, lost souls scream out in vain
All will writhe eternity's perpetual infernal pain
With liftened dreadful swords we swear allegiance to our lord
We're the unhallowed usurpers of the throne.En sirnir tku lk Baldrs ok fluttu til svar. Hringhorni ht skip

Lead us to the journey of our fate
So come millennium sun
Won't you show us the way
Future's begun
So words from my mouth come
Whispering for you return
Pictures a sunset on the lake
Mirrors of crystal your portrait
Walking on this field while I wait
So come millennium sun
Won't you us the way
Future's begun
Some words from my mouth come
Whispering for your return
Show us the future's began
Burning millennium sunThe four hooves echo in the night.
Pictures of deepest fear reflect in your eyes,
Like a fire in your soul.
Burst through the forest of the wild.
The full moon beholds from its starlit sky,
This journey without goal.
The hunt twists and turns,
Winding through the dark.
The flame of intensity burns
Higher and higher and higher.
The hooves are pounding in the dark,
Splitting the silence of the night.
Do you smell the cruel desire?
Your paws are pounding with your heart,
Pounding for life and liberty
As the steam is rising higher.
Inside the forest oh so deep,
The creatures of the night watch intensively
This hunt that flashes them by.
Will you escape or will you bleed?
The hunter's at your tail, he calls for victory
With hunger in his eyes.I'll never forget,
Not what you did, not what you said
What you put me through,
I'll never be trusting you again
There's nothing you can say
There's nothing It will bring me back you
I am done with you, I am done with broken hearts
You'll never be breaking mine again
I am done with you, step into the new me
You'll never be breaking mine again, again
Breaking mine again, again
Yeah, you made me weak
You should see me now, I will never fall down again
You cut me to pieces but I'm learning from my mistakes
There's nothing I will keep from you
There's nothing I can feel from you
I am taking the knife from you
I am done with you, I am done with broken hearts
You'll never be breaking mine again
I am done with you, step into the new me
You'll never be breaking mine again, again
Breaking mine again, again
This is the last time. I'm leaving you.
It's the last time no stopping me
This is the beginning of something new
I'll never forget what you put me through
You have made me, you have made me see
Finally, finally.
I am done with you
I am done with you, I am done with broken hearts
You'll never be breaking mine again
I am done with you, step into the new me
You'll never be breaking mine again, again
Breaking mine again, again.Siebzehntes Kapitel
Der Werkelmann liegt in seiner Kiste und flennt. Seelenwund und demtig versucht der verhrmte Spielmann, sich seine eigenen Knochen zu brechen. Er hat begriffen, dass sich der Tod nur schwer ein Schnippchen schlagen lsst, aber an ihm hngt wie ein giftiger Stachel, der ihn von den boshaften Launen Kezmans abhngig macht. "Die graue Welt macht keine Freude mehr, der Tod macht mir das Leben schwer", jammert das Gerippe in die ruhige Oktobernacht.
Solo Violine.
DER WERKELMANN
Der Tod ist so stet, kein Blut quillt aus den Toten.
Kein Tod hier vergeht, sein Stachel steckt in mir.
DIE BUCKLIGE
Die graue Welt macht keine Freude ihm mehr.
Der Werkelmann jammert und leidet so sehr.
Er ksst seine Wunden und knechtet sie rot
und wird und wird nicht tot.
DER WERKELMANN
Der Tod ist so schal, ich brech' mir alle Knochen
Er qult mich so stet, sein Gift steckt in mir.

DER WERKELMANN
Der Tod ist so hsslich, kein Fleisch hockt mir am Bein.
Er lie mich am Leben, doch nun bin ich "Sein".Another face turns red again - another crime by a familiar hand
Another life is thrown away - another action not meant to be
Another hope for life is dead - another monster under the bed
Another troubled young mind is embittered now
The foundation is shattered now
Night will turn into day, and when the sun comes out I will find you
No more running away, it's time to pay up for what you done
Days will turn into years, and when the time comes I will deny you
Smiles will turn into tears, that's the day when I will deny you
To many lies are swept aside, to many truths are kept inside
To many people are forced to hide, to many live their life's in fright
To many memories are lost to hate, to many sad and lonely fates
To many troubled young minds are embittered now
The foundation is shattered now
Night will turn into day, and when the sun comes out i will find you
No more running away, it's time to pay up for what you done
Days will turn into years, and when the time comes i will deny you
Smiles will turn into tears, that's the day when i will deny you
A reason to see a reason to be x2
No one will take control over me x3
No one will take control
Night will turn into day, and when the sun comes out I will find you
No more running away, it's time to pay up for what you done
Days will turn into years, and when the time comes I will deny you
Smiles will turn into tears, that's the day when I will deny youOutside of this world
There's a life force still burning
Outside of this land
There's a star shining free
In silence we stand
On a golden horizon, calling
This time has no light for us
Still shining so bright for us
Again
Trapped inside this paradise still bleeding
While there are so many faces in this mask of lies
Blinded by the promises and the life in pain
Now the time has come for all of us to rise
Through the fires of hell between us
Through a lifetime of our dreams
Endless tears still burn inside
Beneath the sadness of our screams
At the edge of our forsaken lands
Sign that we stand here alone
Nothing to say when the evil finally burns
We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone
One warrior standing, through a thousand years strong
Our past lives still shining, the starlight reveals
Our glory remembered, with the power of the steel
And the winter rain will fall, around the brave and fallen
Like the sands of endless time, they'll never be forgotten
We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone
For the last time we cry now for freedom
Cast aside, this dying world forsakes us
Break the chains of our creation now to save our lives
Blight of all eternity and the curse of steel
Like the winter rain will tear the blazing skies
From the wastelands of destruction
With the fire we hold inside
Rise again, still glorious
For the power of all man kind
From the years of our forsaken lands
Sign that we stand here alone
Nothing to say when the evil finally burns
We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone
One warrior standing, through a thousand years strong
Our past lives still shining, the starlight reveals
Our glory remembered, with the power of the steel
And the winter rain will fall, around the brave and fallen
Like the sands of endless time, they'll never be forgotten
We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone
For the last time we cry now for freedom
For the trials of far behind us
In the dark and burning skies
Fallen tears still lost inside
Within the memories of our lives
From the years of our forsaken lands
Sign that we stand here alone
Nothing to say when the evil finally burns
We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone
One warrior standing, through a thousand years strong
Our past lives still shining, the starlight reveals
Our glory remembered, with the power of the steel
And the winter rain will fall, around the brave and fallen
Like the sands of endless time, they'll never be forgotten
We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone
For the last time we cry now for freedom
For the last time we cry now for freedom, againAscending from the grave
Awakened from my sleep
To this world, from this earth
Destined to forever seek
From the fields of an age ever splended
Down to this globular place of dirt
Never realized that my life never ended
Screaming through the process of rebirth
Only existing to die once more
Ever agonizing pain my only thirst
My rotten carcass
Cold and worm infested
Meets it's destiny
Reborn in blasphemy
Oppressing darkness close in on me
Twilight madness ripping souls apart
Taste my unholiness
Deep in flesh I'm waiting
As hell appeals to me
Reborn in blasphemy(If the doors of perception were cleansed
everything would appear to man as it is,
infinte. For man has closed himself up
till he sees all things thro' narrow
chinks of his cavern)
"Irritation! Irritation!"-
Ye are always waiting for
Invitation!
"Invitation! -
Blow away the castle wall!"
Ye as one are Dark's creatures.
Ye'll have gotten this salvation.
Ye wilt drive to desperation anyone...
And so shalt we
"We used to see a GOD! - OUR GOD!"
SO WHAT!
"Time to know! Time to know!"-
Time to kill wilt come at once
"Break the wall! Look out the law"
Don't ye want to look above
Your diseases and your wish -
There are ye as headless fish there...
In either event we shalt throw out
Your heinous bowels
"Please leave thy castle again
'Till we'd like to feel thy might,
But we won't have been waiting too long
And soon the sunset will kill us all,
'CAUSE -"In GOD we trust"-
But ye are servants of Satan
Whilst ye submit to his laws -
There is no need to speak of honour
Of the eternal life -
Ye have kept your death as knife
"While we stay here,
Please our master
Do not leave us alone"
Ye left"OUR GOD"in churches
Having fed him with stone by stone
But when ye had come in one day...
"We have found our Lord was gone"
What's done cannot be undone
"But we have felt that something's wrong"...
Because your rope broke under the strain...
We'll take the chain
And build
Your gallows-tree again.
"We've seen the pair of glowing eyes -
With fear we watch as they do shine
Make them forsake us like an aim -
Make them await
Until we fade
Away
In a sewerage of time.
Devil, Devil art thou here?
Thou won't bore and disappear!
Can't thou leave our mansions for a while?
Thou, who whilest away the time
On our tables while we dine...
Thou wilt feed us all until we die
The Chain reaction -
That's what we call this thing!It hurts my eyes to look at you
'Cos you so bright and you so cold
Your crystal words bring me down to sunrise
A darker mass against the night
Your illusion of light
You belong to freezing point
I can try to remain first minute of the weakness
Fire dance in the rain to animate me
The dawn crept over tranquil see
I find my self like a fly in a wet
She gaze at me steadily and proudly
I understand well enough what her smile means tonight
She so bright
I belong to freezing point
I can try to remain first minute of the weakness
Fire dance in the rain to animate meAnd who can ever forget this one?

A frightened nightmare begins
The ultimate agony
Dimension of sin
Gateway to Death
Realm of darkness
Empire of chaos
Engulfed madness
Wasteland of Terror
Blasphemous Land
Shadows in blood
The slumbering damned
Scream at the gallows
As raven pick out their eyes
Eternal torment
Suffer in this paradise
Absorbed in insanity
Souls dwell in depths of pain
Roaring with laughter
As the dead die rattling againI've been shown all good things in life
Not all that have a reach in sight
Really is distorted, ambition can be aborted
Expectation false and contorted
Superficial, I don't wanna be
Just like you, a shallow fool
Superficial, I can't stand to be
Just like you, a shallow fool
I've been one self-influenced mind
All these things they don't realize
Reality is distorted, ambitions can be aborted
Expectation false and contorted
Superficial, I don't wanna be
Just like you, a shallow fool
Superficial, I can't stand to be
Just like you, a shallow fool
And I can't stand all that you represent
Material things have definitely got you bent
And I can't take no more, now I see your flaws
I can't escape it, take me away
Take, take, take, take me away now
I don't wanna play no superficial games
Superficial, I don't wanna be
Just like you, a shallow fool
Superficial, I can't stand to be
Just like you, a shallow fool
I can't stand to be like
I can't stand to be like
I can't stand to be like
Just like youI can move away
just to make you understand
you are in an ocean
full of cruel lies and people want to make you stay away from here
There's a moonlight, and winds and a lonely way
I can't dream anymore
There's a room with a window to nowhere
I'm no way out there
Uh! What a hard time
I hear only voices away
Uh! I've got a real life
I need to be free again
I can move and
I can see for the first time
All the things I let the fear steal from me
Now I'm free to breathe again, I'm not afraid
I caught the spirit I've got the chance to fly high
Always, someday
You never knew
You'll never find
All days, Today
You get the keys to open minds
Your flame will burn eternally, you know, for all remaining years
The sky is now your playground
Home is now the sun
Your dreams are now your destiny
And fortune comes from your beliefs
Ablaze and in full flight
Today has just begun
Eternal
Return from death
And on the ashes of this nest
You raise the soul and bring it back
Love wove with deathly fire
Justice has been done
You fly over the seas of grief
And find again all your relief
From heaven hear the bell's chime
Annunciations come
Eternal, immortal
Return from death
Spread your wings and take flight over the hills
Greet the gleam of sun's fire
Gloriuos anew!
Your renewal may start inside yourself
Get the new light and shine
Beaultiful realm
From now on
You're soaring up into the sun
Dreams you can reach with all your might
Forever bird of fire
Leave behind the pyre
Within the last eleven lines
Your victories will get the prize
Unfold your legendary
Treasure of the gods
Eternal, immortal
Return from death
Spread your wings and take flight over the hills
Greet the gleam of sun's fire
Gloriuos anew!
Your renewal may start inside yourself
Get the new light and shine
Beaultiful realm
From now onAs the sun sets down in the west
Another sleepless night comes her way
Working late for the ruler of the street
Finding her way trough hard times
Trying to make a good life
Selling her body to strangers in the night
Emerald eye - hold on to the signs
of a distant thunder roaring in the sky
As the sun rises up in the east
Another tyrann adores his world
Diamond rings and a monument of gold
Born to take over the throne
A creature without heart
Feeding a violent legacy of lies
Emerald eye - hold on to the signs
Of a distant thunder roaring in the sky
Emerald eye - gaze into the light
Hear the distant thunder roaring across the skyAtmosphere is cold
Tension cuts like a knife
Hazed are the eyes
Reflecting shadows of the past
Nothing moves -
They all just stare.
Inner peace is gone
Tainted by (time ?)
[Chorus :]
Our great leaders
The leaders of man
They lied to us all
They tried to pretend.
They tightened the rope around your neck
Distorted all your views until the bitter end.
Carry the cross,
The cross of burden
Only memories remain
Looking for new life
The fear of the end
Lives in all of us
Heart and soul of man
Ravaged by greed
(Chorus)
Heart and soul of man
Ravaged by greed
Denial and deception
Feed the (sorrow ?)
Divided as we fall
Break the solemn vow
(Chorus)
Atmosphere is cold
Tension cuts like a knife
Hazed are the eyes
Reflecting shadows of the past
(Chorus)Burying swords into emaciated ribs
Tired naked souls
Could no longer walk
Exotic filthy mongrel dogs
Fettered to failure
By a flawed genome
With laziness indelible and inherent
The pitch brutes lived
At the end of the whip
Burying swords into emaciated ribs
Tired naked souls
Could no longer walk
Exotic filthy mongrel dogs
Fettered to failure
By a flawed genome
With laziness indelible and inherent
The pitch brutes lived
At the end of the whip
Disarming them of bows
And poisoned arrows
A lifetime of penitence
Follows the lost battle
Infusion of their poisoned blood
Spirals into societal decay
The sobs of the defeated
Became a painful roar
Longing for a painless death
Became their vision of heaven
Resolved to avenge the deaths
Of those killed tribesmen
Set themselves ablaze
To avoid captured humility
European death revealed mortality
Iberian troops gather their weapons
Journey for centre of the plateauDegenerate
We are degeneration
Your downfall is our aim
We suck your brain
We bring you pain
We are desperation
Leading your son to slaughter
Common grave diggers, mass-murderers
Fellow travelers, a self destructive point of view
We drink your blood
We eat your heart
We are, we are, we are
We are degeneration
We are degeneration
We are transfiguration
This planet won't survive
Decadent morality, malicious insanity
Beneath dignity, a self destructive point of view
We suck your brain
We bring you pain
We are, we are, we are
We are degeneration
We are degeneration
We are degeneration
Degenerate
We suck your brain
We bring you pain
We drink your blood
We eat your heart
We are, we are, we are
We are degeneration
We are degeneration
We are degeneration
We are degenerationAs I follow you, where will you lead me
To the ends of the world
Or is that just the beginning
I've rolled through villages
And done my best to pass on your name
How much is too much
How far is too far
As I push on and leave everything behind
The front line swears I'm going into battle blind
A life dedicated to what I can't see
Still grasping what I was told to believe
What kind of cruel truth only presents itself
In the moment you die
In the moment you die
The facts are becoming less and less transparent
Constantly mixed with the thoughts of the incoherent
Dig deep, they're hidden beneath centuries of dust and dirt
Covered up by the evolution of the earth
I'm struggling with the blessing of the unseen
It's harder and harder to not be accusing
Continuing to draw the lines of acceptance
I'm trying and trying to translate the evidence
Why do we owe anyone repentance, repentance
While seeking answers to these questions, these questions
Why do we owe anyone repentance, repentance
While seeking answers to these questions, questions
We don't owe, we don't owe
We don't owe, we don't owe
Anyone repentance
We don't owe, we don't owe, repentance
As I follow you, where will you lead me
To the ends of the world, or is that just the beginning
The only time you'll ever know if you chose the right side
Is when you close your eyes for the very last time
Question, all that you knew
Question, It's how you'll find the truth
Question, question
It will only make you stronger
Question, all that you knew
Question, It's how you'll find the truth
Question, question
It will only make you strongerGot a reason to live, got a reason
For brains, butterflies for brains
That's it
Whizz bang butterflies for brains
She's got
Whizz bang butterflies for brains
Would walk ten country miles
In a fat person's moccasin
Butterflies for brains
It comes, ....
Has got, ....
The four of us are dying
I'm very concerned about school buildings
Got a reason to live, got black-cloud aura
She's got....
Here it is....
That's it....Terrorizing rule
echoes of ruthless shots
men used as mere tools
to kill cops
Fear of accusing
fault not to be escused
hints are still refused
I am waiting for Strates to act and take
revenge, because inocents mourn
CHORUS
Up to now we have always seen
those who dared brandish a sword
die and leave hearts torn by grief
heroes alone can't win this war
No escape
after being envolved
in a frighening bloody game
only monsters can play
Politicians winning seats
as long as they protect
the cancer grown inside government's spine
Extorticion racket
drug smuggling, tons of the money
quickly cleaned by swiss banks
la Mafia says thanks!
I'm waiting for states to act and break
connections across the whole world
CHORUS
Up to now we have always seen
those who dared brandish a sword
die and leave hearts torn by grief
heroes alone can't win this war
heroes alone can't win this waronce again - we have prevailed for our belief under the sun - we have fought hurling our swords into our foes as it spurts - and covers the grass drinking their blood with the colour red once again - our tribe dominates and the dark deep valleys the green steppes - the grey mountains there can be only one tribe the strongest survive we will defend our domicile hail there's a feast tonight forever where we will celebrate our victory - as we have done so many times before they have always led us hail - to our gods - they are with us we know to our - victoryAfter all these years I was ready to open my heart
I thought we were so close, but now we are miles apart
I know, nothing is for granted with the things called love
Sometimes it hurts so much, is it really a gift from above?
I'm not so sure, sometimes it's hard to understand
It only seems obscure
And now you don't pay any attention to any word I say
And all the colours around me are fading into grey
Maybe I was too sure, but it's still hard to understand
It seems so obscure
Sometimes I feel like a satellite alone on my way
Sometimes I feel like a satellite in outer space with an aching heart
Sometimes I feel like a satellite I've got nothing more to say
Sometimes I feel like a satellite somewhere out in the dark
You wrote me letters in which you've tried to explain
But I'm sorry the feeling that remains is still only the pain
You want me to be your friend, but I don't know if I'm able to
For the moment it seems too hard, because I still feel too much for you
I don't know, maybe there will come a time, But for now
Is there anybody out there maybe just another satellite
Is there anybody out there who leads me through the darkest night
Is there anybody out there who deserves to heal my broken heart
Is there anybody out there I can put my trust in right from the startOverhead the thunder cracked and roared
And when it ceased the deathlike silence
Chilled my marrow and bones
The need to feel dead was killing him
Like death itself
Evil is found in the earliest
Oldest and the most dreadful
Memories of humanity
Eternally feared by gods primitive men
Pale visions, death-pale they were all
Still cursed, haunted and alone
Killing woman, children and men
Sparing neither age nor sex
A place where reality is worthless
And all you want is to be left alone
They grind the land like corn
Showing no mercy
Spilling the blood like rain
Devouring their flesh and sucking
Dry their veins...
The undead leaves their graves
In misty transformations
You see half-visible bodies
Floating through the night
The ancient spirits of the underworld
[REPEAT VERSE 1]
All the trees were lifeless and dead
And there were no birds singing
The reign of man is over
Drained for all its powers
He saw their starving lips shake
With a horrid grin gaped wide
And the corpse lies on the cold hill side
His spirit is carried away
By the northwinds into eternitySomeone Else to Dig
Music: Freya / Rune Westberg
Lyrics: Freya
You can't stop crying,
- well that's too bad
You won't stop whining,
- it drives me mad
You're not my friend - I'm sorry
Though you pretend so bad to be
You're letting me in
where I don't belong
Tell too many secrets ...
Find someone else to dig
Find someone else but me cause
I can't take it
Find someone else to dig
Find someone else but me cause this is wasted
You call me up to fill me in
You say you don't know
where to begin
Well how about you stop talking
How about you start listening
You're letting me in where
I don't belong
Tell too many secrets ...
Find someone else to dig
Find someone else but me cause I can't take it
Find someone else to dig
Find someone else but me cause this is wasted
I hardly met you, but I know
everything, everything about you
Cause everything,
everything is out there ...
Find someone else to dig
Find someone else but me cause
I can't take it
Find someone else to dig
Find someone else but me cause this is wasted
Find someone else to dig
Find someone else but me cause
I can't take it
Find someone else to dig
Find someone else but me cause this is wastedThere is a fire in me
I feel its burn within my flesh
Returning back
With every vacancy of breath
No compromise
There is no blade to bring me down
Bleeding at the seams
I ever fight the final round
All of the sorrow, all of the pain
Hold me down
This is the battle within my name
Forever
One last song to sing
One final decree
One last song
This everlasting word inside me
There is a final day
To every tear, every breath
Falling enemies
No burn of anguish in us left
All will be undone
When every lost will be found
On this day I cease
To ever fight the final round
All of the sorrow, all of the pain
Hold me down
This is the battle within my name
Forever
One last song to sing
One final decree
One last song
This everlasting word inside me
Forever give me... this day
For every soul they take away
Forever give me... this day
For every lie to wash away
All of the sorrow, all of the pain
Hold me down
This is the battle within my name
Forever
One last song to sing
One final decree
One last song
This everlasting word inside meBa ba ba ba Barbara Ann

Barbara Ann, Barbara Annyou are nothing more than dying royalty
you are nothing more than a fading drama queen
your spelling errors in love letters just stole your crown
you are nothing more than late night fantasy
you are nothing more than a rehearsed tragedy
your spelling errors in love letters just killed your dream

you are nothing more than a crashing bore
in your blood paid
you chase a shadow that will fade out as painInk the pen with blood
Now sign your destiny to me
Now in my hands your fate is given
My claim thee to join me
In death when the life you're living
Near the end is coming and to
Enter my realms come and grab my hand

Now I see the light The light
Now in my kingdom comed the claim
Of bond of blood commend thee
Master I thee call heed here
I am now take my soul
Now the dawn of the age of flames begins
Enter the jaws of my hellhole
Sacred flames embrace me
And consume my lustful soul
Take the step into infinity
And recieve eternal bliss
Now I burn a child of sin
Among souls burning in this hole
Slaves all to the bond of bloodI woke, I awoke in the night from a terrible dream
A crystal skull caught in a frozen scream
It was calling me, mon, calling me to a distant land
There was hooded mutants and a mon with metal hand
I'll board a ship and I will cross the sea
I'm the houngan priest, the houngan priest called Samedi
Baron Samedi[Music & Lyrics by Eviga]
Das Kind, das ich einst war, sah still und lnger hin,
Es ruhte auf der Luft ...
doch irgenddann brach ich aus mir herab.
Ich fiel hinein in die Zeit, doch leider nicht unendlich weit ...
Mein Schmetterfels : Vergnglichkeit.
Und whrend mein Blick nun jahrelang durch
Gedankenscherben strich,
sich nur schmerzlich weiten konnte, flog die Zeit in meinem
Schatten, und drngte traurig heimlich
mich.
Erst an welker Nchte Morgen, als scherbenfrei der Blick sich
spannte, sah ich in seiner ganzen Flle, Die Zeit, die sich
"mein Leben" nannten, ja, die ich einst als Kind schon kannte,
ein Lichtspiel eines kindlichen Seins, das wandelfarb'nen
Blickes
mich, ja mich, erwnschte.
Ihr Blick glitt weich in Silben :
"Ich bin Dein einzig' Publikum,
drum mein Wesen fhl' vertraut,
la sehn wohin man durch Dich schaut
und fhlen mich mit Deiner Haut,
Ich erlebe, was Dir wirklich ist.
Ich bin Dein einzig' Publikum,
drum mein Wesen denk' vertraut,
Ich mchte, was Dein Geist anstaunt.
Sei
Ich bin inbei."
Sie schmiegte sich wild an meine Hlle,
Taumelasche sprach von "Wind",
Sie ist Neugier - die Endlose,
Staubfliehender hie dies "Hast".
Sie nahm meine Gesten,
wie Ich sie innigst meinte,
und ehe Ich "AlleinSein" sehnte,
erflo Sie all mein Sein
langsam, dunkel, voll und sanft ...
Jetzt bin ich beinah wieder Kind,
frei belebe ich jeden Moment,
ohne Furcht vor vielem Gestern,
denn in Zeit bin ich mir selbst Geschenk.
Der Moment ist dabei Publikum.
Mein Lidschlag fordert ihn heraus,
mein Lcheln ist wie sein Applaus,
Und manchmal gleicht mein leerer Blick
seinem enttuschten Entsetzen,
denn wenn ich ihm nichts mehr zeigen kann,
erhebt er sich - verlt mich schnell,
und nur einem gefllt meine starre Not,
nun ist es vorbei.
Denn da klatscht
Der Tod.Now you see me, now you don't
Go before I am the goat
You get away with murder
Kill me when you're through
Do I have to give up me to be loved by you?
From the smallest taste I use
From the smallest taste I lose
Won't you crush on me?
Pile your dead on top of me
Tape my eyes so I can't see(C'mon)
My time to burn so sit back and check
The way I come through in the discotheque
I know you like what I got, my style
The original seventies dance floor hot new material
Name ain't down then you ain't coming in
Guest list on the door, you plus two friends
Just as long as they female and got a fit ass
Pole position never comin' in last
Bass line, yeah you know it's gonna get ya
Free your mind if the system will let ya
Peace time so it's time to shout
Guys in the back throw your hands about
Rock the party
We can go through the night
If you're living it up we're gonna let ya
If you're giving it up we're gonna get ya
Rock the party
If you're feeling all right
When you're having a good time together
And a Saturday night lasts forever
Yo can't hold me back, I rock the dance floor
Make a honey shake her booty so I kick it some more
You know the score how they rock a freaky move up on the spot
Never want to stop, temperature is hot
Now visual contact I got all that
Make 'em boogy for me when I verbally freak that
Line after line, keep on hitting with my rhyme
Now what you gotta do is bring your body next to mine
Check it out
Bass line, yeah you know it's gonna get ya
Free your mind if the system will let ya
Peace time so it's time to shout
Guys in the back throw your hands about

Second Dark Age. Death of the USA.
Return of the family.
And the commune crapheads sit and whine
While the commons near my birthplace is now a police college
It's a second dark age.

I could join a pray-peace group
Explain it all away
Cause groups can change the world
And meet Ms. Fjord and Benny.*
"Hi I am Benny. Peace trance.
No Czechoslovak groups are barny fools"
I'm mediocre anti-Jew
And single people are screwed

Of Charles I and the Great God Pan.
[ Abba reference. ed.]This silver platter world
Handing out its song and dance
Says subjective obsolescence
Is the right of all humans
Condemned human race dancing
To their hormonal tunes
Which change according to food intake
And tides changed by the moon
Try it you may not like it trade it in come tomorrow
For the main objective in this life
Is to be devoid of sorrow
Buy it if you can or steal it if you must
And look into the mirror
If you need someone you can trust
And we can say things didn't work out
Til we say things don't work out
You can say things don't work out
I say it's people who don't
Guided by fear of all commitment
We can run but we're still owned
By all our petty fears and desires we'll never satisfy
On our sick beds with question marks
In our heads as we die
God has shown us what is right
And what there is to care for
But we're in a hall of mirrors darkly
Uncaring to find the door
Words like sin redemption and trust
Hit our ears irrelevantly
Condemning ourselves to no hiding place
In the time of missed glory
To God we'll say things didn't work out
And God will say shut up and get outTell me why can't I understand
The feelings deep inside
Why do I try to scratch away the stains
Deep in my heart I feel there's a place
Where love and hate collide
But is everybody who asks for reasons
Destined to go insane
I don't know if I'm right or wrong
The heart of twilight is much too strong
Leaving the pride so I'm stopping to stride
I only dare to hide
Dying, dying! My mind is what I've lost
My head is dying cold
Dying, dying! My mind is what I've lost
The heart of twilight knows
An old illusion of understanding
Is fading day by day
The apparition of a future vision is black
Everytime I dive in depressions
The colors of life are grey

The spell you took me under
I have been a slave to your touch
But you stretched the borders too much
Can't you see that I'm thru with you
There is nothing left to do
Too many words that have been said
Don't you realize it's too late
Hate was what you've seed
War was on your mind
Stone cold
You didn't have no mercy with me
Can't you see that I'm boned
I am here and you are there
All alone but that's my share
This is what you've done to me
You have crucified my soul
Now that it's all over
And the truth has been told
What you gonna do with me
You've traded our love for gold
All the glamour that you own
Ain't worth nothing when you're alone
Is this really where you wanted to be
Here's the truth for you to see
Hate was what you've seed
War was on your mind
Stone cold
You didn't have no mercy with me
Can't you see that I'm boned
I am here and you are there
All alone but that's my share
This is what you've done to me
You have crucified my soulTime for Tears - Caught in fire
Time for Dreams - Freed from the flames
Betray your roots
Create virginal life for the future
The gate of illumination is closed
Recklessnes a loss
Create the angels of your imagination
Like the ashes in the wind
Like the ashes in the wind - Like the ashes in
The wind
Time For Tears - Caught In Fire
Time For Tears - Just For Salvation
Time For Tears - Caught In Fire
Time For Tears - Just For Salvation
Like the ashes in the wind - Like the ashes in
The wind
Time For Tears - Caught In Fire
Time For Tears - Just For Salvation
Time For Tears - Caught In Fire
Time For Tears - Just For Salvation
The silence of the night piercing reality
Humanity never hoped for you
Enemies mistrust you
Your ashes burned on holy soil
Much time invested into the past
Like the ashes in the wind
Time For Tears - Caught In Fire
Time For Tears - Just For Salvation
Time For Tears - Caught In Fire
Time For Tears - Just For Salvation
Time For Tears - Time For TearsNow you all know the bards and their songs
When hours have gone by, I'll close my eyes
In a world far away we may meet again
But now hear my song about the dawn of the night
Let's sing the bards' song
Tomorrow will take us away far from home
No one will ever know our names but the bards' songs will remain
Tomorrow will take it away the fear of today
It will be gone due to our magic songs
There's only one song left in my mind
Tales of a brave man who lived far from here
Now the bards' songs are over and it's time to leave
No one should ask you for the name of the one
Who tells the story
Tomorrow will take us away far from home
No one will ever know our names but the bards' songs will remain
Tomorrow all will be known and you're not alone
So don't be afraid of the dark and cold
'Cause the bards' songs will remain they all will remainThe rain is turning to sleet
Se deep unside, black tears
Are falling
The sleet is turning to snow
Delight of cold
The cry of storm
Beaside my soul
Until the end of times
If you want to hurt ...
Shoot, shoot
I walk Through The Non Time
If you want to kill ...
Tell, tell
I know ...
You'll leave me here in any regrets
The snow is turning to a cry
Eternal love, falls into nothing
The cry is turning in you
The grief for words
The fear to act
Forever close
Until the end of times
If you want to hurt ...
Shoot, shoot
I walk Through The Non Time
If you want to kill ...
Tell, tell
I know ...
You'll leave me here in my regrets
Let me here, my hopes are gone
You see me
I know it
I'm waiting for
Don't blame me ... shoot.Herodias and I have led a phantom cavalcade
Through veiled and pagan history where superstitions reigned
And Christendom sought to pervert, but poets of my name
Sang of penumbral victories that sorcery had claimed
The Graal and mighty Caliburn as votive offerings
To an England rearisen under vast majestic wings
These are the shores whereto my soul
Blood drenched and unredeemed
Shalt seek solace in secrets told
Through the whispers of a dream
From the woods Pendragon-born, I rose Arcturius
A proud, audacious King mantled in the
Vehemence of lust
Death and destiny undaunted me, I drew a throne divided
In awe of the glorious battles won, my dark Goddess provided
Then treachery, a wingless beast, came crawling to my court
And now I lie at cursed Camlann, from wounds a traitor wrought
I fear the Augean light
Is sweeping through Camelot
How bittersweet my triumphs seem,
Now Autumnal leaves succumb to frost
Morganna art thou near me?
Languid, I wend my path to grave
Cast my sword to the sulphyd grasp
Of the naiad neath the silvered lake
When waters stirred lay silent
Mistress let the mists descend
Thy tears cannot thaw Death's cold heart
His sombre gaze defies legend
More so than thine, else thy dew-lidded eyes
Art for the Banshees song
Or our souls entwined like vein upon
The haunted shores of Avalon
The haunted shores of Avalon
Bury me in velvet dream
Lest I unduly wake
And seek to reconcile my thirst
With the cowardly tailors of my fate
Unleash mastiffs of snarling night
To overthrow, plague and burn
As slumber lures me 'mongst the dead
To scheme of my return
Archaic ghostly echoes breathe like thunder of the storm
A tempest fools miscall divine as they crouch awaiting dawn
Their ignorance has forged for me over
Centuries a sword
Burnished to flash like lightning on the precipice of war
The wolves are dead in Albion whilst the
Passive flocks roam free
This my penetrant spearhead shalt pierce these foul,
Trespassing breeds
I have awoken from the past
Glenfully with the shadows over England's bitter skies
I prize mine wounds in a soil sweated drink
Remember me as king when I cradle hell to stars
Like lovers in my arms, nestled vipers to my breast
Venom forces workthius arts of devil's and priestess
Thus I shall rule anew through the sinews of a song
Played upon a storm
By the ghosts of Avalon
And all in league will bow to me, from death they shall ascend
To whisper weals of war to stir the dark one in men
The principle black metal masterplan

the rage pours down into pools of grieving
oh and your smiles turn to leprosy
turn to sickness spread into your hearts
and the pain sinks roots which smother all
but have borne a seedling - a life of hatred and distrust
you lied in ways. . . you never should have spoken
acceptance conditional
your honesty with fingers crossed behind my back
become the blade that stabs me over and over and over and over again
this time the betrayal is forever
this time will have been the last time
i believe
to have given my self away
but now there is a new me
so proud to be the hating tree
my arms out-stretched - they will withstand most everything
now there is a new me
so sad to be the hating tree
as an offering i gave oh me, my self
the madness and the laughter
insight
a love so full
and a mirror that once told me to believe again
now cries with me for the loss
i know too well
oh and the pain sinks roots which smother all
but have borne a seedling - a life of hatred and distrust
for you lied in ways. . . you never should have spoken
acceptance conditional
your honesty with fingers crossed behind my back
become the blade that stabs me over and over and over and over again
but this time the betrayal is forever
this time will have been the last time
i believe
to have given my soul away
now there is a new me
so proud to be the hating tree
my arms out-stretched - they will withstand most everything
now there is a new me
so sad to be the hating treeToday will never end
And tomorrow will not mend
The pain in letting go
Haunts me always as now I've been helpless
Since you've gone away
And I've been helpless since...
The light that shines from you
All you taught us, All you knew
To live and love again
Unforgiven and now I've been helpless
Since you've gone away
And I've been helpless
Since you've gone away...
And though I tried to tell you
I never realized
You would not believe me no matter how I tried...
To be what I once knew
All for nothing without you
To hear you or see you again
Only one time but now I've been helpless
Since you've gone away
And I've been helpless
Since you've gone away...Now when I look at him, theres no more pain
I could bring. Tell me honey, do you like
what youve seen? Answer me, I dont care if
youre in pain!
No more tears are left in your eyes. No more
pain, no need to cry. What youve seen with
sewn open eyes will never leave your mind.
Its too late for regret. Are you sorry now?
These voices in my head are so loud! When I
tighten the ropes in your wrists
dislocate and you finally make a sound.
It is the end of its your time. You will die
for crossing the line! For you wont see
tomorrow but Ill be smiling at your
sorrow!
I kiss your serrated cheeks for all the joy
youve given me. But we both know that you
wanted to fall, or else you wouldve stayed
royal. Have you learnt you learnt your lesson
from seeing your lover on our wall?
It is the end of its your time. You will die
for crossing the line! For you wont see
tomorrow but Ill be smiling at your
sorrow!
This pleasure, it overwhelms me and my
fucking brother hangs before us. Now you
have seen all you need to see, Ill take your
eyes now, theres no more lust here.
This pleasure, it overwhelms me and my
fucking brother hangs before us. Now you

eyes now, theres no more lust for you to see!
It is the end of its your time. You will die

tomorrow but Ill be smiling at your
sorrow!Rifle through your desk
from a hundred yards away,
camouflaged in pigeon shit,
high on the tower of brotherly love.
A hopeless romantic,
Cupid's arrow seeds itself in splintered
mahogany.Organize!
Discipline yourselves!
Release the hounds!
The hunt is on!
Proposition put forth, rejection complete, now we're in the game
Resistance assured, a final push, the second stage remains
Those who would call, a purpose to fall, watch us in dismay
Scattered, tattered, inferior planners collapse under our strain
Advantage clear, all but not too near, a negotiations route is found
Although human, flesh and bone, our minds are keen and sound
Lacking the distraction of the everyman, our superiority is acute
Crushing the enemy in a single move, brutal and absolute
Those who stand up with the the will to fight and
Come out of the shadows, into enemy light
Are fearless and unhindered when exposed
Gather your courage and arm yourselves!
Clear your minds and prepare for hell!
And we'll put our tactics forth
As they fall, we laugh at their cries
The hunt is over, we celebrate tonight
Proposition put forth, rejection complete, now we're in the game
Resistance assured, a final push, the second stage remains
Those who would call, a purpose to fall, watch us in dismay
Scattered, tattered, inferior planners collapse under our strain
Those who stand up with the the will to fight and
Come out of the shadows, into enemy light
Are fearless and unhindered when exposed
Gather your courage and arm yourselves!
Clear your minds and prepare for hell!
And we'll put our tactics forthWalk through the mist at the awakening day
Threatening obscure dismal dark clouds my way
Chorus
Seducing whisper leads me down
To shallow seas in which to drown
Trapped within magic lullabies
Just as I heard his cursing cries
"Never see the day lit time
Dragon be, revenge is mine
You will forget what you once thought was yours
I'll take your shape and I will take her, too."
Chorus
The curse will last until you see
and break the chains of "never-free"
ChorusLaughing, drooling in your face
Grinning outcasts of our race
Tied from hands and feet and waist
You look up in fear
A horrid stench you do behold
The one of rot, mildew and mold
As a cretin grabs a hold
Of your testicles
Start to cry out, but you're stopped
Your mouth is stifled with a cock
Which was removed from your own stocks
The laughter carries on
Bid your balls a sad farewell
As you curse them all to hell
Then you realize too well
Hell is where you areSelf seeker
Axe grinder
Fool of deepest dye
Thorn in my flesh
Red hands
Walk humbly with your devils
Time server
Worldling
Plague of hearts and hopes
Chill my soul
Deaths head
Make a whore a virtue
Forsaken by eros
A scarlet manThere Is A Revolutionary Man
No Laws To Him
Called Insane Forest King
But Helping Civilians
Killing People With His Crew
(They) Don't Really Care
Sacking Some To Give To Others
Shows No Mercy
Nothing Matters - No Soul
Matters - Along
Always Along
Galloping His Horse He Comes With No Laws
...Through The Drought
Hated - Adored
Dead Or Alive
He's Called Lampiao

all youll want to do is fuck.InstruMy visions are all clouded
I see nothing but red
This hatred has now congealed to a near climatic state
Why do I remain here to weaken through the years?
I am so confused - my soul dies all the while
I don't wish to co-exist with this feeble human race
I don't feel the need to be infected with the disease called "life"
A state of mental grief causes my mind great pain
In this emotional state
I suffer from despondency
Violent and murderous thoughts
Form deep inside my mind
Dwelling on these sights to the point where I'm insane
Why do I remain alive when I only wish to die?
I am so distressed - my soul rots all the while
I'm surrounded by life-loving shapes that exist without a choice
Your fears of death are covered up by the words "Suicide is weak"
Released from the grip of life's burdening chains
My body devoid of blood and unable to embrace pain
With death I'll grow in strength and might
Fading away without remorse
With death I'll leave this weakened earth
To become at one with the night
With death I'll grow in strength and might
Fading away without remorse
With death I'll leave this weakened earth
I am at one with the nightDenigrate, lacerate, feed the poison in your veins
And withstand the collapse of a world of fools
All your fears, torn apart
Like a sparkle in the dark
Be aware of yourself
Rip the decaying parts away
Enclosing ways of mind
Revive into my eyes
I feel your idle grasp around my neck fading away
Encoding waves of mind
Revive into my eyes
While I'm screaming now for a last time
Fragile and disfigured nemesis born from ashes
All the answers you seek lie locked in your mind
Raging winds blow the sadness storming the spires of deceit
And still the answers you miss lie locked in your mind
Enclosing ways of mind
Revive into my eyes
I feel your idle grasp around my neck fading away
Encoding waves of mind
Revive into my eyes
While I'm screaming now for a last time
The face inside the mirror
With eyes so cold
(With eyes so cold)
Is staring right into you
Draining your soul
(Draining your soul)
As it slowly reaches to your brain
So crystal clear
(So crystal clear)
The awareness that your inner demons are unleashed
(...)
Grant me eyes to see faces I once knew
Now they look so hollow
Grant me hands to feel
My forgotten dreams in a world of shadows
(...)
Dominate, desecrate all the bastards in your way Resurrecting unbound beyond common rules
Havoc, ascend, from the spires of deceit
Spread your restless spirit and blacken the sun
Enclosing ways of mind
Revive into my eyes
I feel your idle grasp around my neck fading away
Encoding waves of mind
Revive into my eyes
While I'm screaming now for a last tiiiiime !Assembled from bits of other creatures
Created not born
Not having to age beyond recognition
I have no soul
Arrogance and ignorance
A useful tool to destroy those with faith
I despise everything. And will annihilate you all
Crucify and justify. The ones who won't follow
In your eyes I see your demise
I am the superior sovereign. Creator of pain
Dressed in sin. Filled with wrath
Vengeful is my vein
Floods of hate boiling distress
Follow the journey to my dark side
See the human remains cover the ground
I feel no guilt for this genocide
Praising true evil with blooded thoughts
Swearing faithfulness to the dishonest
Nourish my lust for immolation
I represent your devastation
[Lead: Malmstrom, Twin guitars: Malmstrom/Ideberg]
Assembled from bits of creatures
Created not born
Not having to age beyond recognition
I have no soul
In this chaos no one is free to do what he pleases
Watching the sky above. But praying to those below
Hunting for my daily rage. See the rising slavement
Using lies to fulfill my dreams
I am the superior sovereign. Creator of pain
Dressed in sin. Filled with wrath
Vengeful is my vein
Floods of hate boiling distress
Follow the journey to my dark side
See the human remains cover the ground
I feel no guilt for this genocide
Praising true evil with blooded thoughts
Swearing faithfulness to the dishonest
Nourish my lust for immolation I represent your devastation
I am the superior sovereign. Creator of pain
Dressed in sin. Filled with wrath
Vengeful is my vein
No compassion for the mortalForever we'll go out into the night with survival in all our eyes
With knives in hand we stab at the sands of time
To turn back and unwind
Under the death of an age we were becoming stronger than...
With terror in our eyes, we wait on these skies to bring a new chapter
I've seen life through death, under the wait of it all, we all collapse
And these eyes on survive, we will come from the fall and rise again
Like lions we tow the line, blood sewn pact with truth inside
With knives in hand we stab at the sands of time
To turn back and unwind
Under the death of age, we were becoming stronger than...
With terror in our eyes, we wait on these skies to bring a new chapter
I've seen life through death, under the weight of it all, we all collapse
And these eyes on survive, we will come from the fall and rise againWhy have we waited so long
Suppressing the power inside
Tear away all that was wrong
Something too massive to hide
It's time to rip the chain from your neck
Let go the past as you purge
Free now from everything weighing you down
Open the floodgates and surge with
New found power
Cleansing yourself of the past
Learn from mistakes and move on
Conquering new ground at last
Unite and become twice as strong
It's time to rip the chain from your neck
Let go the past as you purge
Free now from everything weighing you down
Open the floodgates and surge with
New found power
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
Hope was all that kept me sane
Rise above and prove myself
I'll survive without your help
Shut you out, my strength comes from within
New found powerThursty murder is befitted to god
The creator of universe has the right to kill all
Trample the mankind as worms
Oh I feel this spiritual need
Soe people see loving father in him
Non suspecting what lives in hell
Someone can say I believe only in myself
I cannot say who o them is worse
The act of god they will die
Crushed damned unforgiven
We are created for carnage
Paradise blooms when we die
If he has killed his only son
Why do you think he loves you?I'm Free...

There Is A Spot Upon This Accursed Earth
Which Thou Hast Never Yet Beheld
And If By Chance Thou Hast Beheld It,
It Must Have Been In One Of Those
Vigorous Dreams
It Does Not Matter To Me,
This Great Weight
Is Off My Mind
It Does Not Matter To Me,
'Cause "He" Placed A Hand
Upon My Head
I'm Free...
From All These Lies
And This World
Full Of Shit
Even If...
It Hardly Matters
Watching What's Happening
Which Comes Like The Simoom
Upon The Brain Of The Sleeper
Who Hath Lain Down To Sleep
Among The Forbidden Sunbeams ...
It Does Not Matter To Me,
This Great Weight
Is Off My Mind
It Does Not Matter To Me,
?Cause "He" Placed A Hand
Upon My Head
I'm Free...I want everything.You don't mean a thing to me.I won't just turn the other cheek.And when you pray to be set free it won't matter.It doesn't matter.I can't wait for the day you'll look to me and say it's over now.How sweet that day will be when you say to me,it's over now.I won't believe one single thing your lying lips will say to me.I hate every thing that you say to me.You're the one who killed it all.Sleep safely...sleep safely...sleep safely...sleep safely.I can't wait for the day you look to me and say it's over now.How sweet that day will be when you say to me,it's over now.Cause I built this with my 2 hands.Cause I built this with my 2 hands,you never understood that,with my own 2 hands.Please...steal me away from everything I know,can we be (can we be)the only things that matter to you now.I can't wait for the day,you look to me and say its over now.All hail to a fascist police state
Assent the doctrines of a despotic leader
An ordered violation of our human rights
Blood-stained soil no longer stands for freedom
Economic warfare has burned the constitution
Acceptance will void our foundation
To support the unjust is not patronage
It's our obligation to reject and disobey
Our hearts and minds
Will not submit
Our hearts and minds
Won't be controlled!Now the LORD GOD planted Eden
Where He put the man He had formed
He let grow all kinds of trees there
Splendid trees and good for food
Satanic seduction
Satanic seduction
In the middle of the garden
He planted the tree
Of the knowledge of good and evil
And He commanded the man
'Don't eat from that tree
Or you will surely die'
But the serpent persuaded the woman
To eat from the forbidden tree
'When you eat of it your eyes will be opened
And you will be like GOD
Knowing good and evil
And you will not surely die'
As the woman looked at the fruit
She thought it would be good for food
So she took some and ate it
And also her husband
Then their eyes where opened
And they realised that they were naked
And sin was born
'Who told you that you are naked?'
The LORD asked
'Have you eaten from the tree
From which I told you not to eat?'
'Cursed is the ground because of you
Through painful toil you will eat of it
All the days of your life
It will produce thorns and thistles for you
By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food
Until you return to the ground
Since from it you were taken
For dust you are
And to dust you will return'
Satanic seduction

Genesis 2+3Shatter my emotions
Take them all away
Left alone to face You
Now You know my heart
Left only to speak what is true
See through this plague of flesh
With truth I say that I love You
Yet my heart betrays me
Be not far from me
For these voices
They must soon cease
Despite their betrayal
You died for meI am you.
Stillborn.
Into this state of being numb.
I am the temple and the sacrifice.
The shrine, entombed within lies all I am.
And you, the womb from whence I came.
I am you.
If I am you, no life is sacred in my hands.
If I am you, no love will prosper in this world.
If I am you, I am the faith to end all faith.
If I am you, you shall not live to save yourselves.
I bring no God, no after world.
I am no more than a lie.
I live your life not for you.
I am a throne made from dust.POSTOJI MESTO GDE MOJI DUHOVI LUTAJU

to see what's behind the sun
step on the hands made out of clay
the hands of stained mortals
all there is and all you'll have
bless the one who cannot cry
there is no night
there is no sunlight
until you refuse to die
I'd let you sleep now
but I don't know how
I'd let you grieve now
but I don't know how
I chant the songs of madness
to be the chosen one
still all these bleeding wounds
cannot be cured by sadness
all there is and all you'll have
bless the one who cannot cry
there is no night
there is no sunlight
until you refuse to die
I'd let you sleep now
but I don't know how
I'd let you grieve now
but I don't know howso you think that you are better,
better than this better than all. broken.
you dont know just how i feel.
you dont know just what is real.
so why did you say those things to try and hurt me.
did you think that you were better than this better than all.I don't want to have to kill you
They'll find out and I will feel blue
Like to take all the skin off your face
Like to smash all your brains
with a vase
Wish I could be a fly in your head
Lay my eggs that will rise from the dead
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Oh I don't want to have to hide you
It's so cold that I'll get the flu
La la la la

I don't want to have to eat you
I won't fit into my swim suit
You've got so much flesh on top your bones
You could cause a bloody big cyclone
Grab a lance smash it straight though your ribs
Splash the blood onto my baby's bibs
Make a mess dripping crimson and bone
Break your face like a stale
ice cream cone
Make a mess dripping crimson and bone
Break your face like a stale

I feel I'm becoming mechanized
World spinning before me made computerized
Separate from soul
Giving up control
Kills the man in me
In electric dreams...
From here to eternity
From now to infinity
Destroyed...we watch you bleed
The New World Machine!!
All we are, all we need
Has become the New World Machine
All we are, all we need
Has become the New World Machine
Now it's time to take another step
Neuro-spike insertion cracks the chest

The emptiness in me
Fills an endless sea...

The New World Machine!!
Machine!!For those who've heard the bells ringing
For those who've felt my gazing eyes
I am what you call a dream
To whom I draw the line of sanity
To furthest hill I long my tears (to fall)
Til my soul leaves this poignant world
To be what is one with the night
"I am what is your inmost might"
For who has seen those windswept flowers
For who has held the rarest rose
I shall crown him as the king to be
While his servants laments shall be my wine
"I am what will forever be"
In blood that is written
From the wounds of your pale skin
To join those who have risen
"I am eternally lost in the winds of oblivion"
In portraits of shadowed life
I saw her embraced by the light
A light which you shall never see
For you are what is forlorned
Forlorned shall never be
Just a pale mourning of those forgotten
Filled with sorrow drowned in my endless tears
Under the stars of the nightly sky
I have wept a thousand times
In my bitter sadness
I can now see the beauty in death
As I vanished to forever sleep
I saw the angels that wept
...I saw the angels of death...He laid by the gate, begging a rich man for bread
Sores on his skin, some said he's better off dead
But when that day came,
Lazareth closed his eyes, carried by angels to Abraham's side
(Chorus)
Oh what a moment, when everything changes
Image the glory, the sound of the praises
When God and his riches, he lavishes treasures
And into his kingdom, he welcomes the beggar.
For all of the poor, the bruised, the broken like me
There is a hope for the desperate, the lonely and weak.
There's a day coming, I'm telling you now,
Will trade all our sorrows for our glorious crown
(Chorus)
Blessed all the poor in spirit,
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
(Chorus)Kapur putih yang pucat
Terasa penuh warna
Dan pelangi yang enggan datang pun berbinar
Kertas putih yang pudar
Tertulis sribu kata
Dan ku ungkap semua yang sedang ku rasa
Dengarkanlah kata hatiku
Bahwa ku ingin untuk tetap di sini
Tak perlulah aku keliling dunia
Biarkan ku di sini
Tak perlulah aku keliling dunia
Karna ku tak mau jauh darimu
Dunia boleh tertawa
Melihatku bahagia
Walau di tempat yang kau anggap tak biasa
Biarkanlah aku bernyanyi
Berlari, berputar, menari di sini
Tak perlulah aku keliling dunia
Karna kau di sini
Tak perlulah aku keliling dunia
Kaulah segalanya bagiku di dunia...
Tak perlulah aku keliling dunia
Kaulah segalanya bagiku... di dunia...In hunger and in fury
In all of human race
The evils resurrection
In all time and space
Our faith is getting weaker
Our hopes are dead and gone.
Who is here to guide us?
To see right from wrong?
To be there for the lonely?
Be there for the weak?
To show us what we're here for?
To make our lives complete?
I just want to know what's true in order to survive.
Forever in my heart I will believe the hands of time
Though we fear and though we try to make us strong inside
Maybe he'll never I arrive
As long as we don't try
A fiction or a savior?
Fate has chosen you?
Mankind needs your guidance
Something to believe into
We're born into a mission
To grow and realize
We're here for something greater
Above ignorance and dimes
To be there for the lonely
Be there for the weak
Show them what we're here for
Make our life's complete
I just want to know what's true in order to survive.
Forever in my heart I will believe the hands of time
Though we fear and though we try to make us strong inside
Maybe he'll never I arrive
As long as we don't try
To be there for the lonely
Be there for the weak
Show them what we're here for
Make our life's complete
I just want to know what's true in order to survive.
Forever in my heart I will believe the hands of time
Though we fear and though we try to make us strong inside
Maybe he'll never I arrive as long as we don't try
We will trySocietal advancement, an agenda of control
Forcing the elimination of hereditary flaws
Licensed breeding protocol, man's course decided
Incarcerating violaters, their spawn aborted, state required forfeit
Human perfection far beyond our grasp
Cut out random flaws, leaving glitches behind them
Talents that lay dormant, left withered in the womb
Pre-determined course, they take no chances
Sleep, submit, obey, accept it
Nature rejected, culture forgotten
Dwell in their complacency
Drop your defenses, swallow your bullshit
Close down all your doubtful dreams
They will not happen, you don't have it in you
Their emotions stripped away
The depth of man measured, proudly dismissed
Traits that bear malignant traces, recognized without a cure
Magnify the scorn upon the disadvantaged
Live off the toil of others, the rich inflate themselves
Treading on their laborers, burdened by destitution
Sleep, submit, obey, accept it
Nature rejected, culture forgotten
Dwell in their complacency
Drop your defenses, swallow your bullshit
Close down all your doubtful dreams
They will not happen, you don't have it in you
Their emotions stripped away
The depth of man measured, proudly dismissed
Born to be slaves, from birth the rich own them
Rigid system, caste of reproduction
Sequence profile, science of misplaced trust
Tyrants protect their own
Propagate subordination
Despondence, contrived alignment
Oppression, induce class hatred
Insurgents revolt against them
Disregard their vacant morals
Interrupt their hoarded power
They will fall, the balance will shift
Overturn their world of shitYou don't know what you do to me
My love knows no bounds
The wishing well is all but gone
And you're nowhere to be found
I'll track you down and tie you up
I'll feed you my love
So wake up bitch and pray to the Lord above
Scream bloody murder
As my love enters you
You'll scream bloody murder
There's nothing you can do
Girl if you think that you're leavin'
Without a fight
You've got another thing coming
You'll see the light
Take good care when you talk to me
I might be insane
Don't just stare
Look what you did to my brain
Scream bloody murder
As my love enters you
You'll scream bloody murder
There's nothing you can do
Girl if you think that you're leavin'
Without a fight
You've got another thing coming
You'll see the lightSwirling void, unfathomable dark, inner cranial conflict.
Wading in detached reality, infinite illusion.
Dark abstract, vice, like grip
Subconscious terror!
Never underestimate the unseen.
Brain producing fear and hate.
Overpowering images, the macabre side of you.
Physical untruths, fuel for it=B9s cruel tricks.
What in reality is questioned.
Is reversed into the norm.
Immediate escape! The vital need.
But you=B9ve been animated at half speed.
Still you run but trip, down into the bottomless abyss.
Consciousness will slowly dwindle,
As your nightmares assume control.
Float in mental purgatory, subconscious terror.That's all right because you wish you were dead,
you live life with a hex,
over your head,
a savior's mouth with a serpents tongue,
but don't forget you're like this with the chosen one,
and I forget about my losing streak,
but you never slip at a chance to remind,
it sounds like you should save a prayer for me,
but I'll take my chances with the unworthy
And you know the quick path,
the righteous the way back,
I'll end up the only one,
I'll end up the lost son
And you know the quick path,
the righteous the way back,
I'll end up the only one,
I'll end up THE FORGOTTEN
And you know the quick path,
the righteous the way back,
I'll end up the only oneI came from the utter fields
Carving shame on the tender shields
On my path I wandered high
Acknowledged beneath the sky
The hate I carried, recalling why!
I walked towards the rising Autumn
And cursed the summer
with the promis of a Winter
Where my foes will quiver in frost
A circeling saga, not forever lost
I came from the utter fields
Carving shame on the tender shields
On my path I wandered high
Declaring war beneath the sky
The hate I carried, boiling within!
I mounted all the hills my eyes could count
And roved wherever the sun escaped sight
I drifted from the deepest tarn
Till I saw my saw my name in aruinic sign
Graven soo deep in the crystal bark
Of a lodge I sojourned years ago
Crying war beneath the skyWhen I first met you
You didn't go anywhere
'Cept for the drama corporation
Of co-op theatre
Skirting from a course
Bovver boots on
Vacuum breath equals
We never close
But one day you'll find out
That you lost a good man
And one day you'll wake up
And find you lost a good man
Transparent or not
You'll never see my like again
I'm talkin about me
No malice
So transparent
When he walks
When he walks again
All reduced to cost-price
Manual for deceit
Indiscriminate take out
Indiscriminate give out
We never close
Never ever close
You're a snake pit
And one of these days you'll find out
That you lost a good man
And one of these days you'll wake up
And find you lost a good manYou complain of breathing

You just wait, just wait
Just wait to suffocate

The worldIn 1945 the year it came to be
Their fate decided
Many miles across the sea
They told them not to fear
They couldn't be prepared.
Then came the day
That not a single soul was spared.
Too late there's no escape
The Trial has begun
Down they fly
From out of the sky
Feel the radiation burn!
The men of power
Had nothing to fear.
When the finger hits the switch
They're far away from here.
Down in their sanctuary
Hiding in their lair.
The sorcerers of justice
Will be waiting for them there.
Too late there's no escape
The trial has begun
Down they fly
From out of the sky
Feel the radiation burn!
I saw the people running
Through all my dreams.
I heard the soldiers crying,
Mother Nature screams.
I saw destruction falling
From out of the sky.
I heard the wise man calling
Why?
In 1945 the year it came to be
Their fate decided
Many miles across the sea
They told them not to fear
They couldn't be prepared.
Then came the day
That not a single soul was spared.
Too late there's no escape
The trial has begun
Down they fly
From out of the sky
Feel the radiation burn!( written and performed by Kristy Thirsk )
I know you want me
But caution inspires
Your tamed indifference
Won't challenge me
Could it, could it be?
Love's what you deny me
This spoiled seduction
Intoxicates thee
So balanced on my halo
You long secretly
Could it, could it be?
Love's what you deny me
Don't deny yourself
'cause I know what you want
You can't deny me
We'll be together
So try to run, love
But you won't get away
Could it, could it be?
Love's what you deny mewhen my grandfather was dying he rejected a heart tranplant.
thought a black mans heart would make him no longer human.
he pleaded to be saved from jewish doctors who suffocated non-
compliant patients with pillows.
his pleas went unanswered...The frozen has lain forlorn too many ages
Wasting away in the crucible of space
Drawing down the hallowed darkness
Arms outstretched embracing ecstacies of hate
Black solstice
Somber wings extinguish the sun
Nocturnal unfurling
Quenching stars one by one
Vomit war crush the sacred heart of kindness
Unholy raven spawned from dying dove of peace
Freezing the light expunge the furnace flames
Adoration of the prophetic release
My immolation the final comet
The hammer of damnation strikes
Pounding the earth my anvil
My life is to kill the light
Find solace in the fact that
Our pestis lays waste in both houses
Neither blind reverence or stark denial
Will alter the discipline of sterile beauty
That follows in the wake of the prophetic sign
And the deification of the strike of mailed fist
As cleansing chaos steals the light
The majestic darkness feeds
My life is to kill the light
The frozen has lain forlorn too many ages
Wasting away in the crucible of space
Drawing down the hallowed darkness
Arms outstretched embracing ecstacies of hate
Black solstice
Somber wings extinguish the sun
Nocturnal unfurling
Quenching stars one by oneBreathe me in like air, innocent.
My fingers bleed.
I've been writing too much.
Preventing these words from searing my battered throat.
And I can't even scream so I sketch your face.
Each line was a cry.
Each curve bore blindness.
Prevent my arms from failing.
Limitless expressions to your face I can't conform,
But give hands the chance voice wouldn't have.
It was the first time that our words kissed, but our lips, they didn't even touch.
No skin on skin.
The first time in my life that I existed.
And each time that we breathed, we were reborn.
We're reborn each time we breathe.
These nights were gaining strength yet losing ground.
A short-lived grace.
Your tongue!
I taste your ways with a pen in my hand, in my hand, in my hand.
I taste your ways.
Well, in a matter of time my life went from day to night, incriminating textures.
Where on earth did you go?
What happened to us?
With this retouching paint, I will use a brush, apply it to your canvas.
This was once a beautiful painting.
Each lasting memory will control each word that I write.
And I used to think that my hands could dance.
I only needed to hold myself up.
You were never a crutch as you tore me away like this fringed papers' edge.
You were never a crutch?
But now I see my hand's been broken for quite some time.
These memories impale the senses to this day.
I'm broken.Radio's a public toilet
A funeral for a friend
Wash your mouth out then puke
And wash it out again
Scores for porn in short
Is audio intercourse
A stereophonic orgasmic
Lust for passion
Slide it in, grease that pig
And fuck to a different tune
Radio is a pool of urine
A gallon down your throat
Anesthetized in sadness
I've got the antidote
The answer is so surreal
Press play and just sit back
High fidelity
Aural aphrodisiac
Pillow talk pillow talk
Mattress rock
Seduction in the key of love
Pillow talk pillow talk
Mattress rock
Seduction in the key of love

Baby send me

Why won't you send me
Baby just send me

Feels like a lifetime
Since I have been inside you

Feels like a lifetime

Life looks upon you with scorn
Hopes flee, visions elude
As your feeble breath is turn
Six sinister thorns of beuaty
The claws of the non-divine
Our right to breathe
Our right to bleed
Forever denied
What some seek in the depths of the unknown
Need not be sought so far
The truth of what we are
Each day a fevered circle
Life looks upon you with scorn
Six sinister claws of darkness
Strip your flesh to the boneBuscos pendejos, virgenes, y gueros
La table te espera,
Para maltratarte con fieros
Cirujia con un machete
sacrificio de sesos para satanas
Brjueria con velas y sangre
Misas negras pa el placer del brujo
Resando ante
s de sacarte la mente
Si quieres salir de la mesa de muerte
Una partida pa abrirte la pansa
El machete no se quebra cortando huesos
Te saco las tripas con mis hunas filosas
Me pelas la verga con tu culo
Espero allarte en mi mesaBurn your mind, that no one will find
turn your mind to the twisted kind
searching for the true belief
seeking, bleeding, is this all just a dream.
Answer is mine, answer is lie...
emotions, reflections, passing through your life
sweating, burning, cracking and thinking
what is the thing you should be twisting.
[chorus]
Let it all in, make no resistance
black thoughts are crawling deeper
why to battle against the stronger one
realize that you are one of us.
Deny the world, deny yourself
only hope is your lonely face
should I be me, should I be test
illusions of red, it`s pressing my chest.
[chorus]
Let it all in...

[chorus x2]
Let it all in...Be able to envision on your own time,
Your in my world except when your soul is exposed,
The feeling with consistency is what you're built to be,
No miracle no wonder left,
Save your way,
You arose to abolish over,
There's still shine in these eyes,
Let them lead the way,
You're bound to wake up lost inside your nightmare,
Yeah but there's no way to unprotect a lie,
You falsify,
Your word turns empty,
And all the purity dies,
Save your way,
You arose, to abolish over,
There's still shine in these eyes,
Let them lead the way,
Let them lead the way,
Let them lead the way,
Suppose you walk so far away,
No one to find you,
Nothing to save you,
Won't ever change,
Won't ever find you,
Won't ever change,
Nothing to save you,
What a waste,When a motherfucker steps out his place
And gets slapped in his motherfuckin face
Just because the motherfucker tried to base
The G.O.D., the G.O.D
And while I see his whole clique pass us by
Motherfuckers think they qualify
And for those niggas want to try
The G.O.D., the G.O.D
Yo
I'm not caught up in politics
I'm no black activist on a so-called scholar's dick
I come through with the Wu and drop math
And versatile freestyle bombs and phonographs
And deliver, all things in number and weight
Searched to death, on how living things relate
Cause at a young age, I was molded in a religion I relied on
And got caught up in superstition
Scared to split pole, duck black cats
Once in a while, threw salt over my back
But with knowledge of self from off the shelf
Made things seemed complicated now small like elves
So turn off the lights, light a candle, and have a seance
Pull the lid off the Dean Martin scandal
Witches, warlocks, spooks and holy ghosts
RZA let's defraud the hoax
When a motherfucker steps out his place
And gets slapped in his motherfuckin face
Just because the motherfucker tried to base
The G.O.D., the G.O.D
And while I see his whole clique pass us by
Motherfuckers think they qualify
And for those niggas want to try
The G.O.D., the G.O.D
We were on the same ship when the slaves were checked
I had to pull your card, you was on the top deck
So I plotted my escape, I saw the thin line between love and hate
And fast from the hog on the plate
I suffered brutal pain, from whips and chains
Punishments that were set to wash the brain
So look listen observe and also respect this jewel
Drawed up, detect and reflect this
Light I shine, because my powers is refined
Through the truth, which manifest through eternal minds
Purified gases and masses the same elements
That helped spark civilization classes
I see brothers quote math plus degrees
Look at professor ass niggas can't feed they own seeds
When a motherfucker steps out his place
And gets slapped in his motherfuckin face
Just because the motherfucker tried to base
The G.O.D., the G.O.D
And while I see his whole clique pass us by
Motherfuckers think they qualify
And for those niggas want to try
The G.O.D., the G.O.D
When a motherfucker steps out his place
And gets slapped in his motherfuckin face
Just because the motherfucker tried to base
The G.O.D., the G.O.D
And while I see his whole clique pass us by
Motherfuckers think they qualify
And for those niggas want to try
The G.O.D., the G.O.DAch, Nacht, wie lieb du mir wrest
Wenn du die Sterne auslschen wrdest
Ihre Strahlen murmeln unbekannte Gesnge...
Und ich wnsche mir alles Dstere und Stumme
Alles Entblte und Verschwommene
All das Finstere liebend - Meine Aura verngstigte
Als ein blinder Gedanke knabberte an Raum und Zeit
Oh Seele, wanderndes Gebein, meinen Frieden du erbittest
Ich lege mich nieder, erfrischendes Dunkel
Von schweren Todestrumen durchdrungen
Und wickle mich in deinen Schleier
Mit meinen Gedanken trotze ich allem, was Sie Gott nennen
Ach, du Mrder der Kunst, du falsche Lebensweisheit
Aus meinem atheistischen Glauben wirst Du gewi sie nimmer rauben
Die entweihte Krone meiner wahren Unsterblichkeit
Ach Nacht, wie lieb du mir wrest
Wenn die Sterne du auslschen wrdest
Der Tumult der Existenz... fragwrdig, ungewhnlich edel
Dein Schatten murmelt unbekannte Gesnge
Endlich, Nacht... steck deine schwarze Flagge in meinen stummen Schdel
In deinem teuflischen Blick - ein dsteres Paradies
Von tiefer, eingeschlafener Dunkelheit
Oh gttliche Vorstellung, die ich oft pries
Verstummter Jammer eines sanften Lchelns
Meine Seele geht verloren im nostalgischen Inferno
Visionen des Todes - meiner Selbstverschwendung
Die Nacht wacht ber die Ikone der Geburt im Chaos
Ich wute nichts von ihrer Existenz
Nichts, bis sie mich anlchelte
Ach Nacht, wie lieb du mir wrest
Mit deinem milden Weinen
Wenn Sterne die bittere Vergiftung auslschen wrden
Welche dieses abstrakte Leben in mich hineinpumpt
Wie der erste Schmerz, jedoch trist und still
Ist der Leichnam, der sich aus meinem Inneren davonschleicht
Hinein in die Nacht des Unwesens...Visions harass my life
Drowning all christian rats
Chaos opressing religion
God finally lost his throne
Fall of christ, their grip fainting away
Disbelievers escape their tiranny
Ripping throats of all their enslavers
Paradise in total desolation
Set thou an unholy man
To be ruler over him
And let satan stand
At his right hand
God dethroned
Priest kneel for reprieve
Death is all they recieve
Life slipping out of their bodies
Lucifer finally in command
Set thou an unholy man
To be ruler over him
And let satan stand
At his right hand
God dethroned
Monks die, a bloody death
Churches burn
Apocalypse, no escape
Satanic raids
Your god is dead
Set thou an unholy man
To be ruler over him
And let satan stand
At his right hand
God dethronedStop everything you do
Take a step outside and look through
There's a path you do not see
And it's all lit up and lined with trees
There's an arrow directing you there
Bright neon orange and flashing
It's there to make sure you don't
Take on a path that circles around
There's only a couple of ways
To get lost in life's little maze
You can explore a dead wrong path
Or follow someone else
You got to use your own mind
And if you're still wrong all the time
Then you really deserve what's coming up, what's coming up, what's coming up
Yeah it's gonna be
Killing time, killing time
No time to mess around 'cause it's
Killing time, killing time
No time to call, no time to lose
There is no choice, not up to you
It's killing time, killing time
No time to slide away
Killing time, killing time
You fail to think I know what I say
Everybody's full of shit anyway
The path you take is all by chance
And I'm telling stories to enhance
There's no need to plan it out
Or to add to your list a load of doubt
Leave all that shit behind for what's coming up
There's no way to prepare
Or to know who's gonna be there
There's a chill running up your spine
And it's always there, it's always there
Five or six times a night
I'm awake with my eyes shut tight
But I don't want to go back to sleep
And dream about what's coming up
Welcome to
Killing time, killing time
No one anticipating
Killing time, killing time
No one just standing around before
Killing time, killing time
No one to drag down under
I can see tracks that you've left behind
You live in the crosshairs most of the time
And there's no way to see or tell
You're only a few short moments from hell
It's not the bullets but the gun
That make the killing so much fun
And it's never too much or to tough
And it's always never enough
Stop everything you do
Take a step outside and look through
There's a path you do not see
And it's all lit up and lined with trees
There's an arrow directing you there
Bright neon orange and flashing
It's there to make sure you don't
Take on a path that circles around
Well I hope it's
Killing time, killing time
Now everyone can see that you are not what you pretend to be
It's killing time, killing time
No one will go down with you when it's
Killing time, killing time
No one to guide you throughYour life will be the mirror
That shows what you've become
The stage is set for trial
To show what you have done
Your choice was to be rotten
So painful be the end
Law of existence - revolving doors
Comes the teeth of life's jaws
End of life - peace to the core
Full circle - returns once more
This is not the end of it all
Full circle returns once more
Your fear will be your shadow
And life will take revenge
You had it all but went too far
Realize the end is near
Regrets come much too late
So fire will be your fate
Law of existence - revolving doors
Comes the teeth of life's jaws
End of life - peace to the core
Full circle - returns once more
This is not the end of it all
Full circle returns once more
Remake, remodel - endless revisions
Within the circle - a new one is born
You're not alone - there's more of the sane
Wish the cycle - bred more of the sameI wipe the maggots from eyes
As I wake from my deathlike sleep
Surrounded by these black walls
Lid closed tightly
Bleeding from every pore
In either reality or a shadow of madness
My flesh as one with the rotted thoughts
That pollute my skull
Through the haze of disturbing depths
My veins flow black
Sour and poisonous
I feel the flesh separating
From my desiccated face
I am living death
I am of darkest origin
Screaming as I struggle to awakeYes, no, yes, no
Not, another word
you'll know what to do
Right
In your face they see it
In their face you...
Take it
Make up their minds
Aggression turns the screws
Fight
Take your piece and hold it
Make your piece and
Stand up, you know what it means
Wake up, time to live your dreams
Down by,
Law and they can't hold you
Dictate and control you
Hold onto your ideas
Down by,
Law and no one owns you
And all the shit they've thrown you
Pay back is a real bitch
Nothing's ever easy when you do it yourself
All you can do is try
Life's not unfair, life's just life
Death not suicide
Be all, and you'll be the end all
Life can be a real ball
State of mind
Euphoria
Think,
On your feet, and stay one step ahead
Break
Take your brain and use it
Take their mind and...
Change,
An attitude, like you'd change your shorts
Right !
In your face they see it
In their face you...
Stand up, you know what it means
Wake up, time to live your dreams
Down by,
Law and they can't hold you
Dictate and control you
Hold onto your ideas
Down by,
Law and no one owns you
And all the shit they've thrown you
Pay back is a real bitch
Nothing's ever easy when you do it yourself
All you can do is try
Life's not unfair, life's just life
Death not suicide
Be all, and you'll be the end all
Life can be a real ball
State of mind
Euphoria
Always taking, always faking
Ignorance is so frustrating
Always taking, always faking
Ignorance is,
No way, no way, no way, no way out !
Be all, and you'll be the end all
Life can be a real ball
State of mind
EuphoriaI listen to the sea, this is all what I have to be
I'm lying in the sun, enjoying this quiet fun
The wind caresses so softly
It feels like somebody loves me
The sky is painted in smooth blue
The drink in me hand, too
Another lazy day no affray
The night is coming, I see the moon
It's getting dark here soon
I'm looking at the stars but without any wars
Tomorrow I go down the hill...or maybe up
Or I stay here and shift into lowest gear
Another lazy day no affrayDo you believe in honesty
You'll have to find your destiny
There may be times when things go wrong
You're gonna win if you are strong
So many boundaries to break
A million tasks you'll have to take
The road that leads you there is long
But in the end you'll be the one
Just raise your voice and sing
Sing this song
Then you'll be the one
Who takes the victory
Take your time
And try to hold the line
Then you will get it all
The years of innocence are gone
You've gotta show where you belong
You know what's wrong and what is right
Just force your goals and hold on tight
There'll be no mountain that's too high
You'll never fail so won't you try
The battle only just begun
And if you win you'll be the one
So let me hear your voice
Sing this song
Then you'll be the one
Who takes the victory
Take your time
And try to hold the line
Then you will get it allVictims of damnation, drowning in the lies. Fallen angels of torment, father cease the cries. In our time we've slaughtered the innocent, raped the world in our discontent. God's creation in disarrary, by the father we have betrayed. Need proof, just look to our past, strangled life amidst our grasp. Self destruction we're lost to see, take and take for all our needs. In a time of innocence, we have poisoned the Earth. Destroyed the innocent, disgraced our birth. Revenge upon us by the father's hand. Witness to apocalypse, and the downfall of man. All out war, war. All out war, redemption for the innocent, and the seekers of peace. Ignorance, tomb of the masses reaping the piles inside. Wreaking to divine intervention, by the father's hand. Welcome to the days of affliction, and the downfall of man. Sky's are burning, as blood flows. Lost in torment, our lost souls, creation is in flames. Man's existence, is to blameA folk of cheeriness and strength
Content with the life they lived
So-called barbarians yet with eyes cleered
For what they truly need and what damn not
Free and plain
Barbarians, farmers and savages
Counted as ignorant and uncivil
But told to bow before the emperors throne
They were at least not venal
True and plain freedom - of this natures clan
True and plain pride - of this celtic clan
True and plain dignity - Tegernako!InstrumentalWarm up:
Black man with a fresh cut
Pants sagging, see you done messed up
Dress code got the nigga coming out'cha
Ain't spoke one word, but they know all about'cha
Top down with my hat low
Riding round wit nowhere to go
Beat up, working on my latest flow
(Sirens), go ahead nigga take it slow
Verse One:
(Nah) Why do niggas get nervous, when them sirens surface?
Probably cause they'll stomp a nigga out on purpose
Homie must've fit a description
You know the one that fit the dark skin you in
Got any weapons? Where the weed nigga?
In other words, a reminder that we niggas
Check my record.. the shits clean
Grew up on the southside where they claim them streets mean
But every weapon drawn on me, been by those with badges
Imagine.. what that do to a teenage psyche
Or the niggas in my hood that look just like me
Just showing off my new pair of all blue Nikes
Now I'm gang affiliated, with straight A's?, unlikely
Nigga ain't even out of High School
And they taught me life don't play by my rules
Just sit back, shut the fuck up and be cool
And if you don't, well, peace dude
Orange suit, pink bottoms, that's the dress code
In that 6, ducee, in the middle drop that O
Private prisons shopping niggas on the low
Line'em up and knock'em over just like some dominos
Truth is that lil nigga had no where to go
Just headed down the road of the life he know
Hook:
Black man with a fresh cut

Dress code got the nigga coming out'cha
Ain't spoke one word, but they know all about'cha
This life got all kind of rules
Sometimes they let a nigga by if he kind of cool
Just smile and put on the best show
But.. be weary of ya dress code
Verse Two:
They only like to scratch the surface
You left ya block, now you got'em all nervous
On elevators, they clutch they purses
We started snatching'em, shit got worse then
The lil homie, just dropped out of school
Got a bitch pregnant, started flashing his tool
Slung a lil dope and I asked why dude?
He said... cuz that's what's nigga do
How can you excel, when ya only hope is jail?
When they treat you like a loser you can only expect to fail
Gotta read between the lines, when you living in the hell
If they hide it from ya eyes then learn to read braille
Hidden Colors, this life don't love us
Black woman's only hope show yo ass in them covers
King Magazine, I thought he had a dream
Woke up and saw Trayvon's murder scene
Shit, look what they doing to Obama
Brought'em into office just so he can drop bombs brah
Protect Monsanto, snatch some civil rights
He ain't in control yall, why can't you see the light?
Black man's plight, black man's struggle
Black men bred to fight, so black men hustle
Truth is we got no where to go
Just headed down the road of the life we know

Verse Three: (Spoken Word)
Ladies and Gentleman,
Welcome to America's wasteland, your local neighborhood ghetto
Where the grind is so deep, we can't seem to let go
Surrounded by pimps, playas, hustlas and fiends
Where things are as they seem, a land with no dreams
No hope, no ambition, but niggas still got a make a living
Ain't no 9 to 5's so I guess its time to ride
Got kids we gotta provide for, keep ya eyes open for 5-0
Cuz they don't give a fuck, they toss the drugs in ya back seat to make that quota
And the ones outside of the ghetto hear about the drama but they don't wanna know though
So we find ourselves stuck in a cycle,
And when you try to rise above it all best friends become rivals..

Just smile and put on the best show
But.. be weary of ya dress codeWaking up to face another nightmare day
Blood drips from the mouth, my teeth decay
Deep depression is coming on fast
Got to get me my crystal breakfast
High, chasing the high
Die, chasing the high
High anxiety, panic setting in
Will do anything to get the sin
Sunlight burning my eyes, gotta fill the need
Methamphetamine, it's time to feed
High, chasing the high
Die, chasing the high
Dying to feast
The monster is fed
Call for the priest
One more is dead
The chemical injection, rushing through the vein
Speeding up the system and burning up the brain
Powered and invincible, the pain is at an end
High above, so beautiful, the demon rides again
Time I get high
Time I get high
Cycle starting over but it's too late
Try it just one time, it seals your fate
Deadly consequences, you can't go back
Life is gone, a heart attack
High, chasing the high
Die, chasing the high
Chasing the, chasing the, chasing the highHow could he cope with the flashing-by past [/flash in my past]?
Through my vid-earphone amp I had to tap
I relate the tract

Turns himself to butter

No wizard's spells, no demons will hold me back

Fight me!!! I will bring glory to my lord
As I rip out the dragon's heart!
Vengeance of steel, is what you will get
Say your last prayers you're going to hell!!!
Now is the time for the battle to start
My burning arrows will strike right through your heart
Here me now I ride upon my horse
Fight me!!! I will bring glory to my lord
As rip out the dragon's heartBroken wings don't fly away.
Is this what you want me to say?
Caught up in your web once again.
This time I just can't get away.
All I ever wanted was to be in this world.
Alongside of you in this life.
All I wanted from you was one more time.
One more!
One more time I believe in the lie.
Broken dreams don't fade away.
The pain only lingers and stays.
I've seen this before and I know it too well.
This time I will make no mistakes.
All I never wanted was to be in this world.
Alongside of you in this life.
All I wanted from you was one more time.
One more!
One more time I get kicked to the side.
One more!
One more time I bleed for you.
One more time, one more lie.Blasting The Silence

I'm a total wreck, gotta lay off the booze
And on top of that, I can't find my shoes
But what can you do?
Gutbucket Blues!!!
Waking in a cold sweat
Feels like I need a new brain
Overdid the Rot Gut
And now I'm in incredible pain
Retching up the effluvial brews
Cursing my existence through a river of spew
Fishy smelling bile to recycle and use
And I could really use a drink when I'm through
But what can you do?
Gutbucket Blues!!![Music & Words: KF]
A warrior so proud of the woman by his side,
His faithful heart would take no other bride,
For three years they lived,
midst the forests of the land,
Strong and proud was the love
of this woman and man
Like the sky high above,
no beginning and no end,
The woman that he loves,
his life and best friend.
Until that day in December
when the snowstorms did start,
Stalked the Norseman with his bow,
put an arrow through his heart.
Hear the cry, the cry of the winter wind,
Blowing across the land,
stealing his life from him,
From the earth, and into the otherworld,
the land of Tr Na n-g,
is the place where he must go.[bonus track]Storming the gates of hell
Christ carnage
Warlords lead you the death
With a frenzy in their eyes
It's a chaos in your realm
You attack my world endlessly
But I'm crushing your skull and your neck
Die!
The messenger of death, he's fallen from the skies
The signs of terror, arrival of the lord of flies
Chopping like a mill, dismember the skull from your neck
Hacking around me, the earth is water'd with blood
The last holocaust, begins with the final attack
War, blood flows like a stream into the sea
Countless bodies
Cover the earth
Nocturnal wars
Balance the sign of the cross
Christ carnage Christ carnage!Devastate, leave them weeping in your wake
A family's broken dreams, with glove in hand I separate
Mutilate them, carve them up, bring them to their knees
The powers of a knife at hand, if it breathes, it fucking bleeds
Mankind, end time, disgusted with this race
I pluck them from the universe
Pawns on my favorite game
Cut them all down, completely randomized
Never a clue nor a trace is left, identity disguised
I measure joy in suffering, with a rope and blade I maim
Humiliate these fallen souls, this earth of sick disgrace
Climactic degradation rapture in blood achieved
Suffocate them, rip them, rape them, make them fucking scream
Orgasmic mutilation, on terror I do feed
Annihilate this bastard race, I'll make them bleed for me
I'm taking you down with me into this hell of hells
Stabbed in the throat, sputtering blood, my need is never quelled
You must stand here before me, my judgment ends in death
Tower above your broken bodies, face speckled in red
How sweet it is to revel in your flesh
I won't stop until the last is dead
Climactic degradation rapture in blood achieved
Suffocate them, rip them, rape them, make them fucking scream
Orgasmic mutilation, on terror I do feed
Annihilate this bastard race, I'll make them bleed for meHunger, and the world is reduced
Reduced to the surface of her skin
Like a spray of broken glass
His bones began to fill with words
Like a monolith once lost
As our ash crown the barren mountains
As if mercy were a skin of water
We fall into a prior dream
The number of the grains of sand
Exiled from the memory of men
The strategies of war through a universe of grief
Ad the city of mirrors wiped out by the wind
Through the impenetrable haze
Through shapeless fog
Scattered through these desolate plains
White shine the bones, Eater of gods
As if mercy were a skin of water
We fall into a prior dream
The number of the grains of sand
Exiled from the memory of men
And as the smoke shifts in black
Only ashes remain
And as the smoke shifts in black
Eater of gods
Eater of godsThunderous events below the atmosphere.
Hibernate within my fissures.
Mind has compressed what it lent from the ear.
Like a diamond that sings of external pressure.
But this zenith is chased by a curse.
That time seems cruel to our memory.
Expressive bow strokes in the bodily universe.
Soon fade into a monotonous symphony.
Like solar flares that reach our plexus.
Through the cloud chamber's web.
So we learnt to forget about essentiality.
And deny the primal frequency.
But its spirit still exists in me.
As my existence is its gree.
Like fertility found its mother in fallow.
We found our ethics in each other.
Organic development was to follow.
And intelligence defeated pother.The weight came and went and took my will to live
Spoiled by defeat, forced to drown in what's left of me
That's when breathing became routine
And I could feel myself fading
I am stranded
No direction, I am a compass
Constantly spinning
Constantly searching for the end
Never reaching our destination
But the goal was never when
Or where
Or who
It was only you
I appeared in your arms as if I had been born there
You promised you'd never let me go
But I don't know what I believe anymore (what to believe anymore)
Affection allowed me to let the light in
The fear made me whole again
Help me rebuild my broken bones
Help me regain my sanity
But with caution always present
Our pasts manifest themselves
And we act as if this is what we deserve
But I refuse to fail again
I'd force my ghost to write your name in the flowers on my grave
I watched the world give up on me
I used to spend my nights, praying for air in my bloodstream
Now I long to feel your breath pass through my arteries
The goal was never when
Or where
Or who
It was only you
I appeared in your arms as if I had been born there
You promised you'd never let me go
But I don't know what I believe anymore (what to believe anymore)
Fill me with your faith and let me leave
I'm scratching at my skin to take my mind
Off the absence we've created
The lines blur together like the veins in my arms
And I wish I wasn't so alone
You are the difference between hell and homeOpen the gates
let all the wounded in
leave the rest to rot
fear the sky
amazing how it happened, the blood poured down like rain
fear this sky, fear our sky
resurrect the fears that you forgot
look upon with them, with such disgust
hear the screams of the children
show us where to hide
floating towards my face, my face, my face
your floating closer to my face
place your faith in someone else
i can feel your face
i can feel you
floating closer, floating closer to my face
you are floating closer
i can feel you
i can feel your face
laughing while were bleedingWhat's happened ---- you leaving' so early
I could say: It isn't right
Don't try to tell me, you're feelin' so bad
Don't try to lie ---- you Don't wanna fly !
I saw you sittin' alone in your room
Lookin' in the mirror all the long nite
And someone told me, you're feelin' so old
You're feelin' so tired, you cannot see the light !
What's happened ---- you leaving' so early
I could say: It isn't right
Don't try to tell me, you're feelin' so bad
Don't try to lie ---- you Don't wanna fly !
I cannot help you, no, where is your power,
You Don't wanna tell me what's wrong !
I couldn't turn back on you, what's going on, yeah,
You Don't wanna...
I cannot leave you here, where is your force, yeah,
You Don't wanna...
I cannot help you, no, take you to a doctor,
You Don't wanna...
Are you a rebel ?!It's just one more step
Are you giving up now
So close to knowing?
The only hope that's left
Has been taken from you
A new journey awaits you
A new journey awaits you
Time to begin
A new journey awaits you
[No idea what this line is]
No one will ever break us
Or the experience
When you become an end
It counters certainty
You are left to witness
All of this on your own
You will fight the reasons
You're left to wonder why
Every moment matters
You discover space
A shift in time is on it's way
To get away we'll have to change
Another hope is known to me
We're gonna have to find our own beliefs
A new journey awaits you
Time to begin
A new journey awaits you
Looking up to a new ideal
Where we all devote this
Of our surreal past it seems [not sure of this one either]
No thought has been noticed
Of our ascension
Of our ascension
The transition has come
And like the dead courageous
You know what you can become
Our journey has just begunHold tough, stand my ground
Play alone, won't play the clown
Some say I sealed my fate
And threw the key away
Now I feel the power
Surge inside of me
I'll be the man I wanna be
I'm tellin' you I'm gonna be
King of the castle
Ruler of the land
King of my destiny
The power's in my hand
I wanna be king
No way! People say
Loneliness is the price to pay
Wasting my time to claim the crown
Now I feel the power
Surge inside of me
I'll be the man I wanna be
I'm tellin' you I'm gonna be
King of the castle
Ruler of the land
King of my destiny
The power's in my hand
King of the castle
Ruler of the sky
King of the castle
You won't ask why
King of the castle
Ruler of the land
King of my destiny
The power's in my hand
I wanna be king, I wanna be king
I wanna be king, I wanna be kingSon of Satan born of fire living in Sodom
Demonical youth blackened soul in full control

Descent of blood summoned to destroy
Nazareh must die by his command
Rising from pits of hell to drink the blood
AntiChrist born
Hate from Hades
AntiChrist born
Fire from Hell
Son of Hell attack with burning plague
Pray upon the torn flesh of innocent
Kill Christ blood on the cross sacrifice
Armeggon of war commence wholy die
Breeding of hate preform the darkest rites
Calling forth the black heart of damnation
The vengeance of war won by Hell incarnate
Victory of evil rise demoniac
AntiChrist born
Hate from Hades
AntiChrist born
Fire from HellAll that's now been broken
On streets I dare not walk
Freedom is an illusion
I build my fences high
If there was something out there
I have learned not to expect
There's a hundred million reasons
Not to care
Don't bring it, don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me
Don't bring it, don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me
Wear Misery's Crown
As always in this matters
You broke the deal of deals
And wasted what was given
To revel in your mess
I gave up all for nothing
I tried my best and failed
There's a thousand million reasons
Never to share again
This is how it all begins
This is how it all begins
Don't bring it, don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me
Don't bring it, don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me
Wear Misery's Crown
This is how it all begins
Go now x3
Don't bring it, don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me
don't bring it, don't bring it
don't bring your misery down on me
wear Misery's CrownWe gotta slow down the speed
The less we have is the more you need
We gotta cut off the speed
While the engines bum beneath our feet
We're running out of the fuel
It's hard to find like jewel
We're running out of the fuel
Black fuel's the master making rules
Black fuel controls the world
We stand backs to the wall
And being slaves after all
We stand backs to the wall
Till the never ending story falls
And then one day you'll see
We messed it up so let it be
And than one day we'll see
There's nothing left internally
Black fuel controls the world
Every minute that we move
Black fuel's being used
Depending all the time always
More water in the wine
While I'm sitting in my room
Patiently waiting for the boom

A quick grasp of insanity, cranial tissue in decay
A force fed tool of apathy i am
Parasitic life form, infesting my whole being
Necrotic fungus resecting organs to create...
From the realm of the dead I'm fed
Cracking open the coffin lid
Driven by a hunger, unable to grasp
A chemical reaction that campels me to grab
The axe, anxiously removed from its shelve
With an unpredescent joy I brutally hack
Psychonecrotic hallucinations,
as my skull begins to reek
With goreastic elegance I purge the weak
Parasitic life form
Rehashing the dead for its cause
The chopping of heads
A daily act of self-enjoyment
Cranial metamorphosis,
A forensic decrepit anomaly
Intestines turn into pulp
Axe wielding among the stiffs
Parasitic resection...Slide over here
Listen to me
Rippling wordstreams
To unlock dreams
Take up the slack
Loosen these bonds
Unzip and undo
Untie my tongue
Untied undone
It's sucking out bones
Through a melting phone
In a whispering eddy
I am undone
Untied undone
Turning to liquid
Starting to float
Everythings easy
From now on
Untied undone
Unhook and unhinge
In a river of dreams
Rippling wordstreams
Unravelling
Uncork the wine let's toast the unborn
It's my unbirthday untied and undone
Unwrap this gift in a state of undress
The future uncertain nothing less
Untied undoneA wasteland grows inside my mind
As the moons sets before my eyes
My dreams are old and milleniums passed by
Torn - in a strong reality
Born - into the wrong century
I am soldier of dark existence
I'll last eternally...
I am the triumphator
In the grip of eternal frost
Domination, devastation
Eternal damnation
..Not just evil imaginations
Drum auf bereit zum letzten Sto
Wie's uns're Ahnen waren
Der Tod sei unser Kampfgescho
Wir sind die schwarzen Scharen!
Eternal Damnation...
Und dem Leben soll kein Reich mehr bleiben
Total devastation!Remember the threat from which it was said
"You will reap every seed that you sow"
And the tomb where you lay is the bed that you made
Be still in the pain that you wrote
See now, every scar is a choice you make
Every choice is a vow you take
Take pity upon your fate, you coward
Sleepwalk through heaven's call, no forest for the trees
Unlearn every step you take, it'll bring you to your knees
Tread
Shallow water
Safe from the weight, the burden of sacrifice
Sons and daughters, pray for the rain
May it redeem their eyes
And now we have seen what complacency brings
As the blind are assuming the lead
Dig deep in the hole where you buried your soul,
In the river from where it bleedsAlways try to see it your way
Never really knew whats right
Never really played in your games
(Saw it from the outside)
Never going to live it your way
I'd rather stand and fight
Never going to fall into place
See it from my side
Letting go of everything
Looks better down on paper
Letting go of anything
Not until I meet my maker
Never really saw it my way
Never really knew what's right
Always gotta hide from the pain
(Saw it from the inside)
Never had to save it from face
Never had to run and hide
Tell me I've fallen from grace
See you on the dark side
Letting go of everything
Looks better down on paper
Letting go of anything
Not until I meet my maker
Letting go of anything
Looks better down on paper
Letting go of everything
Not until I met my maker
Saw it from the outside
See it all from my side
Saw it from the inside
See you on the dark side
Letting go of everything
Looks better down on paper
Letting go of anything
Not until I meet my maker
Letting go of anything
Looks better down on paper
Letting go of everything
Not until I met my maker

poor, poor Ronnie
Oh why, why dude
you were not a fool
Is this a new killer in town,
ha, ha, you gotta look around
Smelly kiss of taste
fuckin' asshole stopped on his road
this crafty killer
the graves filler
so long, so long, so long
See you in heaven
What's the panic in the branch
who's gonna leave
who's gonna capitulate
go down Spider, don't wait
Is this a new killer in town
ha, ha, you gotta look around.
Now Ronnie lies
imitating excrement
it's not lucrative job
you're finished, boy!
Bye, bye Ronnie
Bye, bye RonnieOld man sits in an apricot tree
He sees I and I sees he
Old man sweet as the fruit he's picking
Knows the rhythm of nature's ticking
Gives a smile of tooth and metal
Winks an eye like a falling petal
Face, a furrowed field of life
Tracks the years of the living knife
He I love
He I know
Seasons come
So fruitman go
Through the crowd I enter in
See the head of virgin skin
Frail, the old man's hand I take
Peace be with you, Sunday shake
Sweet old man he turns to me
Tries to tell me what's to be
He don't say no words at all
Tears from him like fruit do fall
He I love
He I know
Seasons come
So fruitman go
He I love
He I know
Seasons that come
So fruitman go[Music: M. Petrozza]
[Lyrics: M. Petrozza]On this night we dance in the moonlight
Our feet are bare in the cold white snow
Our stiff bones move so slowely
Nut we will dance until our shrouds fall off
On this night we dance in the moonlight
Sad shapes among empty tombs
Beating the rhythm on wooden coffins
We will dance until our shrouds fall off
It is the Dance
Of the dead
On this night we dance in the moonligt
The dance of the dead until our shrouds fall off
Our rotten corpses move to the music
Tonight we are dancing among our candles and gravesBehind the door, no one knows
Crimson liquid overflows
Witness the wrath of nevermore
Life is nearing the raging shore
Phantoms as white as the sheet i scribe
Haunting, taunting as they bribe
Red skies turning black
As the wrath reaches black
Tormenting battles within our hearts
Women and children walk through parts
A hopeful glow reaches my face
As the wrath is taking place
Faceless kinsmen look around
For they know not what they found
Darkness fills the raging shore
Witness the wrath of nevermore...
Once more!Young man, atheist
There's someone there you can't see in light
Young man, naturalist
Your eyes are heavy from sleepless nights
Feed the conflict into your head
Young man, atlas
There are places without ground of reality
Young man, nihilist
Dematerialize prediction of insanity
Nihilist, nihilist, nihilist, nihilist
Nihilist, nihilist, nihilist
Just feed the conflict into your head
Freedom is just a state of mind
Asleep with dead eyes open
Afraid to put words onto paper
Afraid of the gates about to crack open
Man, it's about time to let your spirit pass through
Were you north or south bound?
It's all up to you
It's so up to you
Just feed the conflict into your head
Freedom is just a state of mind
Asleep with dead eyes open
Afraid to put words onto paper
Afraid of the gates about to crack open
Man, it's about time to let your spirit pass through
Were you north or south bound?
It's all up to you
So up to youIt lives in the blackened night
It lurks in the valley of the lost
A voice is heard from the past
It's coming back to claim its freedom
Tremors fall from the souls
Chains are broken beckoning call
Life will end, all sins will crawl
Stop the toture blood must flow

The key lies under your skin
Your thoughts are governed by the Ruler
The Ruler dies - you take revenge
Suicide - your death contends
Shadows of the dark call your name
Angels of death can't relent
Desperate cries to kill yourself
Peace be with you... see you again

Chillin' with two women, me and mister thanksgiving
I'll be some where fly, Thanksgiving goin' swimming
While you was wearing snorkels, I was out snorkeling
Of course I'm shit on these niggas like porcelain
It's more than love with this money I'm infatuated
Captivated by the diamonds and capsulated
Shooting range in the basement, Olympic size pool
With pool table adjacent, I love me some money
I stash money fast money
Comin' on bumpin' them onions
Bunking and crossing the country
So, so don't cross me you monkey
Sleeping on 50s and 20
Rollin' up onions and hundreds, pulling in porches
And phantoms, fancies be throwing their panties
Drama and cannon demand it
Gucci and Drama they panic
Ugh, they sick they vomit
Put some more commas in front of it
Drama got Gucci he stuntin'
Gucci and Drama we done it
We got so much money, 'bout our money
Some money mo' money, dummy

Uh, money gotta big house, money got a bad girl
Money make you famous, money rule the whole world
Money set trends, money is in the Benz
Money got associates acting like friends
Money, money he owe money money he blow
Money got sexy ladies dancing on da pole
Money got dem on a stroll, money platinum and gold
Money make 'em shake it like Beyonce Knowles
Only God knows the things I do for money
That's a young fly man
Check out them dimensions, 20s, 50s and 100s
Don't you make me look good when you see us out stuntin'?
Catch a whif, find out that's yo' bitch
Catch her pushin' your wheel, then the go and pushing clips
She got me going crazy I'm coo coo for boucoup bucks
Plus I can't lie, boo, it's only you I love
I got the love for money
I gotta have it, the lust for living lavish
Gotta get that green paper stacking

I'm 'bout my instrument, I'm 'bout my doe
I'm on my hustle
(Man)
You already know.
I'm getting stacks, I'm hitting lick
I'm packing pounds and bagging bricks
You got them [unverified], I gotta laugh
You talking Oz but selling halves
Where your connect? How much you got?
That's all he holdin'? Man, I buy him out

I, I, I, I gotta have it
I, I, I, I got the love for moneyThe ravens are on the wing!
My scramasax is red
(stained with the blood of many Mercian warriors),
The ravens are on the wing,
By Offa's decree I am an outlaw,
Branded wolfshead by my own king.
(The orm-garth awaits me, darkly astir with ophidian malice...)
The ravens are on the wing!
Ash for our spear-hafts,
Yew for our bow-staves,
Oak for our deck planks,
Oak and elder our shields.
Hail, o' great liege of the ancient woods, ruler of the deepest forest...
you, who were reigning o'er your time-veiled kingdom centuries before
the arrogant men who proclaim themselves kings of this island
ever supped of life's bitter-sweet draught...
I give you my hail,
I give you my blood,
I give you my life,
O' sylvan liege.
My life bleeds forth unto the earth
(from many deep and dire wounds),
To slake your roots, great old king...
(as I rest my battle-ravaged body against thee.)
The ravens are on the wing!
Ten leagues ride on lathered steed,
Gold in hand to a sword-for-hire,
A blood-eagle carved by Saxon steel,
And two score slain earns royal ire.
Gwynned lies two days westwards,
Still further south, the weregeld calls.
Mayhap with All-Father Woden's favour,
My deeds may yet inspire the skalds.
Litha's moon gleams high o'er the tallest oak,
Ancient king in this sylvan court of elm, ash and yew,
The wood-spirits watch from gnarled bough and bole,
As I pull two Mercian shafts from my bloodied thews.
The ravens are on the wing!
I give you my hail,
I give you my blood,
I give you my life,
O' sylvan liege.
Beneath the oak, I rest, bone weary,
Thirsting for a horn of ale or jug of mead,
And yet how could a heathen man wish for any more,
Than the healing balms of English trees?
The ravens are on the wing!As I travel down this, lonely road
So many signs i should have seen
Path's I've chosen never, rise to meet
The man i should have been
As i sit here, huddled in the dark
A sullen face, tattered clothes
Thoughts of you, struggle to keep me warm
In this night so bitter cold
Devastated All alone
Of my sins i can't atone
Self-Imposed
This is my Hell! (I Want you to release me!)
Forgotten Soul some twenty years
A vivid memory of your tears
Let me go
This is my Hell! (I want you to release me!)
Can't control my inner rage
Now i'm damned to live the day
For all time
This is my hell! (I want you to release me!)
I'd trade my soul for what I've done
I swear to father and to son
You were my world
This is my Hell! (i want you to release me!)
I can see the tears
Falling from your eyes
I can see the Light
Growing dimmer as i die
Over and over in my mind
I've come to you so many times
And asked forgiveness
For your Hell! (I want you to release me!)
Please Forgive this awful thing
So i can hear Death's angels sing
you were my world
This is my Hell! (I want you to release me!)
I can see the tears
Falling from your eyes
I can see the Light
Growing dimmer as i die
I can see your tears! (I can see your pain!)
Falling from your eyes
I can see the Light
Growing dimmer as i dieI'm a first round draft choice... 19

Argentinas Falkland Islandsi'm looking now where i have been
i try to see where i will go
this are two ways shrouded in fog
what is my existence's sense?
every day i'm wondering, will there be a change?
every hour, a loss of power - every day
every day i'm wondering, will something new begin
time is flying, minutes dying - every day
unsure of my heart, unsure of myself
wondering silently of what could be
i ask you now: is this life?
meaningless, a senseless, useless way
shattered nerves, but here i stay, every day
i will move on, the journey never endsOh, unholy wings of death
Ceremony of darkness
Feel the kisses of the whip
Carnal excess - evocation is done
Diabolical possession
Wrapped in blasphemy
Diabolical possession
Deny christian slave morality
Adore my mighty sin
Drown the host in excrements
Immortality of dark desire
Adore my mighty sin
In the sing of the antichrist
Immortality of dark desire
Defecate on the altar of lies
Spoil the back of the goat
Voluptuosly vaginal explosions
Premature embryos - dancing in fire
Diabolical possession
Wrapped in blasphemy
Diabolical possession
Deny christian slave morality
Adore my mighty sin
Drown the host in excrements
Immortality of dark desire
Adore my mighty sin
In the sing of the antichrist
Immortality of dark desire
Crucified image of god
Extreme unction nearsGap between the scenes
Severs present and the time to come
On the layers of outer heaven
All hidden omens are found
The one who seeks
May find the end of the line
But the one who also sees
Makes out the meaning of signs
Brightest star is dying
Forgotten becomes the light
After seventh circle is complete
Red sand will cover ground
When third man arrives
Red blood tames the hate
Gold turns into iron
Into blade of tyrant's fate
To the sign of the raven
I connect my soul and mind
I'm a man with a vision
That is not tied to time
Eyes of viper lead
Me through the darkest woods
Under wings of phoenix
I land the nest of the truth
To the sign of the raven
I connect my soul and mind
I'm a man with a vision
That is not tied to time
Eyes of viper lead
Me through the darkest woods
Under wings of phoenix
I land the nest of the truth
To the sign of the raven
I connect my soul and mind
I'm a man with a vision
That is not tied to time
Eyes of viper lead
Me through the darkest woods
Under wings of phoenix
I land the nest of the truthI can hear the scream of despair
It's shooting through my body
I can't speak or feel or see
I just can't believe it
Torture's laughter echoes through the land
The weeping children cannot understand
So much blood
So much pain
Too much death
No hope, no help, no end
The shadows of fear eclipse the land
Deprived of liberty
They will never laugh again
The mothers tears
The fathers sorrow
The weeping children cannot understand
Is this really our civilized world
Where love and reason stand as sacred words
If that's the way it is, then this world is no place for meI don't look that familiar.
No, I don't know you from anywhere.
Would you care to just be straight with me?
You just met me for the first time and that's fine.
Why are you so afraid to speak your mind?
Instead you speak the mind of everyone else.
Just think what you could have said.
If you had only thought for yourself.
To bad you were force-fed feelings.
And now you've blocked your own mind out of your head.
If you ever want to think on your own, it's ok.
Go ahead.
Open hands that know not what to hold on to.
Closed minds that hold off on what they know is true.Roasted visions unherald the call
Pay the piper or face the fall
Unpleasant benevolence
Undesired, it's your defence
Rotting flavoured retribution
Burning hotly in your throat
Perished antiseptic inner domains
Drowning love begins to float
The familiar screams aloud
Mainline my blackened bones
Exaction with a vengeance
History consumes its own
Wicked voice, a whispering flame
Stems from all past foul deeds
Telling me that you're to blame
Ruled by your bitter creeds
An ordered mind, my constitution
Left me on my own
Aggravating your solution
Running blood from stone
Bastard wanton act betrayed me
Left me all alone
Yet I'll survive
Honesty a poor mutation
An uprising complication
Doubtful you will ever change
Senility onset of age
I'm betrayed
Red blood out, the black runs in
Spreading wings and claws
Flooding me in a sickly grin
With sharply smiling jaws
Hate...
Save me all that humane thought
Judge not the moment past
Frozen heart, to the last bone
Pumping on this blood from stone
Wicked voice, a whispering flame
Stems from all past foul deeds
Telling me that you're to blame
Ruled by your bitter creeds
An ordered mind, my constitution
Left me on my own
Aggravating your solution
Running blood from stoneThunder is my sound
As I'm burning' thru' the town
Wind's blowin' my hair
As the people just stand and stare
Past the speed of light
I'm burnin' up,the scream of the bike
You must step aside
I'm a wicked machine in the night
I'm livin',I'm ridin'
Addicted to leather and speed
Live fast - Die young
Die young
I live for today
No one's standing in my way
'Cross the desert I ride
With an army by my side
We love the action at night
I'm speeding up together in flight
I'll never change in my ways
I'm the terror that won't go away
I'm livin',I'm ridin'
Addicted to leather and speed
Live fast - Die young
Darkness lies ahead
Speed is poundin' thru' my head
Heading straight for disaster
But I don't care,I'm pushin' it faster
Leave the city at night
Into the red I'm revving the bike
There's no time to turn
Into the wall my life slowly burns
Not livin',I'm dyin'
A victim of leather and speed
Live fast,die young
Die young,live fast
Die young,live fast
Die young,live fast
Die young
[Beehler, Johnson, McPhee]You let me hit you
So I won't touch the children
So how hard do I have to fuckin' beat
You to have a crack at the kids?
Looks like you fell down the stairs
On the way to the hospital again
And not soon enough
And not soon enough
I have a coat hanger abortion lined up
For our six year old sweet little princess
Before the bandages come off your eyes[1.]
Raben kreisen hoch am Himmel, halten stille Wacht
Eisig weht der Wind von Norden, der die Glut entfacht
Feindesherrschaft muss vergehen, fremder Glaube fllt
Hammerschlag malmt zu Vergang'nem, die das Kreuz erwhlt
[Kehrreim:]
Der Hammer zerschmettert das Kreuz... Und der Sturm weht all's
Fremde hinfort
Zwei Raben kreisen, um in Asgard zu knden was geschieht an diesem ort

Feurig loht das Sonnenrad, zieht druend seine Bahn
Schickt sein Licht zu uns hernieder auf den Schlachtenplan
Heidenkraft steht wider jene, die das Kreuz gebracht
Schwert und Hammer senden sie in ewigliche Nacht

Dunkler rauch steigt auf zum Himmel, nur noch Asche bleibt

angels
open arms
and cast down nations until
nothings left
the stubborn heart
kills thoughtful minds
still they
hate when
evidence
stares them in the face
the threat is real
even when heaven is silent
there is a calm before the storm
when every man
will call
on the name of God
and he will judge this wicked world
i am not your enemy
i just see what you refuse to see
why do you
choose to live in
an enclosed room
when his light casts no shadow
for all you know
this could be your dying day
you never know when
your life will be taken away
we tend to think
that man sas all the answers
we think
we know everything
but we are wrong
this world is cursed
now its time
to sentance the dead
this is the end
times been spent
blood's been spilled
so that we can live
the time will come
when every knee shalll bow
and every tongue will confess
your time is running out
let the curtains fall
let the camera fade
this is your final call
before the fires blaze
where every wrong's made right
darkness will turn to light
there is no place to hide
its time to choose a side
to sentance the deadThis monument to the matron
Quick change of mood when you came in
A nervous introduction
Then we can for invincible alliance
Your growing fond of deception
All the things that you forget to mention
And every indiscretion pushes me further away
Desperate, do you ever grow tired of begging?
I know, I know, I'd rather live with nothing
Negative maybe but I've been working on it
Progress just moves so slowly
We are growing more and more distant
We are growing more and more distant
Miss Model Mess hits the pavement
Young debutante formed a habit
Measures that may seem drastic
Whatever makes you feel accepted
But I'm going south for the season
With nothing but a paper back companion
And mine is the only opinion
With which I'll have to agree
Desperate, do you ever grow tired of begging?
I know, I know, I'd rather live with nothing
Negative, maybe but I've been working on it
Progress just moves so slowly
[Incomprehensible]
Each and every under pass that bears the declaration
Of a dated love affair and the number of Satan
I was educated there by the commuter station
The burdens you're bearing with threaten to break
The back of the widow that weeps when she wakes
We are growing more and more distant
We are growing more
Desperate, do you ever grow tired of begging?
I know, I know, I'd rather live with nothing
Negative, maybe but I've been working on it
Progress just moves so slowlyInstrumentalThe killer awoke before dawn
He put his boots on
He took a face from the ancient gallery
And he walked on down the hall
He went into the room where his sister lived and he
He paid a visit to his brother and then he
He walked on down the hall, yeah
And he came to a door
And he looked inside
Father? Yes son? I want to kill you
He said what?
And mother? I want to
I want to fuck you
For what you put me through
So what you got
So fuck you
It's coming back to you
So what you got
The other night I was out riding in a friend's car
And out there on the side of the road
There was this snake
This snake had eyes of fire and fangs from another world
But he was selling something
He was selling devotion
He was selling dreams, he was selling lifestyles
And I said sure man what you got
I'm interested in anything that's gonna get me off
And the snake just stood there and smiled with the spit in his eye and cried
Fuck you
For what you put me through
So what you got
So fuck you
It's coming back to you
So what you got
He was selling dreams and he was selling lies
I met the prisoner of my own device
He was selling love, he was selling bliss
He sold me anything, I could not resist
Ride with me
Ride with me
Ride with me
Ride with me
I had the freedom to live how I wanted
To take what I wanted to take
From anyone at any time
Forever in heartache
As the snake just stood there and smiled
At my demise
I wasn't scared
So fuck you
For what you put me through
So what you got
So fuck you
For what you put me through
So what you gotDig your way to misery
Spark eternal hatred
Burn all bridges
Set it free
Your time here has been altered
Awakening
Free your mind
Insanity made you blind
Awakening
Free your soul
Let your cold winds unfold
See the storm on the horizon
One man against it all
Without fear
Mind control
You are ready for your quest
Awakening
Free your mind
Insanity made you blind
Awakening
Free your soul
Let your cold winds unfold
Bloodline from the Stone Age
Primitive and old
Eyes like reptiles let you see
Brain mass blurs the imagery
I cannot hide from life or death
I want to be alone
My eyes can't see what you can see
I see no flesh or bones
Dig your way to misery
Spark eternal hatred
Burn all bridges
Set it free
Your time here has been altered- I Control the light
The darkness reigns, and the sun descends
- Dark spirits awaken in me
Eerie movements in his mighty kingdom
- The salvation of the black soul
A star formation, a warning in the sky.
- The second war is mine
A new dungeon of the dark,
Like a shadow in dusk
His scent, his aura, the all-embracing
Darkest one.
Destruction of all mankind,
Will shape the second purgatory land.
The devours of souls.
- An abandoned priest
The savior beckons for him to rise
- An abandoned angel
An encounter with the fallen one
- The final conflict
He's come to put an end to all
- Hypocrisy
This soul belongs in Hell,
But not with this savage og envy.
I took a deep breath, and together with
The mighty evil embrace, it was so intense.
I felt my desire, all hell in my hands.
Without repentance, my mind's in oblivion.
Forgotten is the paradise, left is the origin.I know that someday as the light
Blur on my soul
will switch off.
You'll never know how much does your Gaze means for me
Touch of your hand. The whisper of the heart
Passing moments when I
Felt your breath
Whisper of the heart.
You'll never know
How many of a pain
How many of the suffering
Man can stand.
The limits are like an air
Loosin' the pride he's loosin' face.
I cannot feel anything apart of a reality
Tight as the cage of sad
I'm unable to hate
Unable to hate 'couse I...
Where the birds fly
Where the day wakes up
Where the smell of buyin' tomorrow
From traders of the dreams he was sittin'.It's ok it'll all be fine

Bad SeedPainful, inflamed intestines
caused by bacterial infection
Swollen, twisted veins
Hemmorhoidal, ulcerative flare-up
Irritable bowels
Volvulous
the twisting of intestines
Intense excrutiating digestive painAll around
The stench of death
The smell of wasted years
Fallen beauty
The sickness grows
Rain on concrete
Like the tears
The greyness looms
The henchmen wait
Be quick to master fear
A place called home
In a bitter world
Rain on concrete
Like the tears
White king reigns
Bring the pain
Blood on the sidewalk
Death in the streets
In this city
Fallen from grace
Beyond every sin
Feel the sickness grow...
Blood on the sidewalk
Death in the streetsDon't wait, don't wait
Don't wait, don't wait
You're way too late
Don't wait, don't wait
The beat goes on
Until it's gone
She strolls so slowly with her ball and chain
The cling clang chatters patterns with the patter of rain
Stares in a mirror cracked in seven different ways
With holes in her umbrella dripping on her face
Her makeup running down like the tragedy face
Alone on a city street surrounded by space
She opens her mouth to scream and shout out the pain
But all that comes out are silent sobbing sounds of restrain
The beat goes on
Until it's gone
There comes a time when she will trust her belly
Not disappear from the world like Machiavelli no
Forfeit the pride it's not a crime but she's running out of time
And denies it's showing while her anxiety's growing old
Don't wait, don't wait
Don't wait, don't wait
You're way too late
Don't wait, don't wait
The beat goes on
Until it's gone
The beat goes on
Don't wait
Until it's gone
Don't wait
The beat goes onRetribution, just solution, there's no other way
Haunted by your actions of which you have yet to pay
Caustic bursts of filth that just spew out of that mouth
Bone splitting cold, now that you have been locked out
Egotism, disillusioned, can you see the end?
Seditious to your family and seditious to your friends
Tears of joy were shed on the day that you were born
On the day you'll die there will be no one there to mourn
And I thought by now you'd learn
Now it is your turn
Childhood choices, adult divorces
You have paved your way, strike another lady lover
See how long she'll stay, embezzle money, coward, phony
You have brought this hate
Abomination, deviation
Start another war
Brothers stay and fight
As you flee out the back door
Isolation, desolation
Mercy I will lack
Cherishing the day
I lay you flat out on your back
And I thought by now you'd learn
Now it is your turn
Childhood choices, adult divorces
You have paved your way, strike another lady lover
See how long she'll stay, embezzle money, coward, phony
You have brought this hateMy cosmic shining
Condied with ice
My cosmic shining
Candle my light!
The eye of the sun is nomore blind
The dawn of a new day reborn?
My cosmic shining
My fallen star
I am falling
Lying afar
I walked uproad in showers
Down the rivers of the windfall light
In the garden where the shapes of night
Celebrate my fever
I feel my fever, I see me dying
Heal my fever, my cosmic shining
I see my dying, my cosmic shining
Don't you see me dying
My cosmic shining?She's pulling out her eyelashes, from pain she bears.
I'm far from home, I'm all alone.
This hole is way too deep.
I've left behind my happy life,
And I'm still asking how I died.
Lay down, pray now.
I'm walking through the cold of night, so I can see your face.
At your window I will stand, your smell I will embrace.
My eyes in yours and yours in mine and now I know just how I died.
Lay down, pray now.
Oh.
As fire falls.
I've never made life before,
I've never had this before.Acerto a ser vierrias aquel due
El relej di las diez
Canvience no perder tiempo
Me cuesta mucho confesarlo
No puedo no tiene espera
Conforme - Conforme
Pintar de verde
Conforme - Conforme
Con mucho questo
Abrir el fuego
Sin decir aquava
De una empresa
A la carta o a la larga
Dar alos uno

Throw your hands up in the air and fly so high
I really wanna roll a blunt and touch the sky
I don't wanna think about what's out here
I'm with my friends and feel myself well
Don't seek my aim it's nonsense what I do
My only message is ha-ha-ha fuck you!Every once in a while I count the moments
That are passing us by, when we should have know it
I was so crazy in love, I didn't say it enough,
I didn't say it enough!
If this was MY LAST SONG,
I wouldn't waste one lyric on what went wrong,
The melody would dance like you do
And I would repeat the beat,
But always some new
So baby, I'ma sing this to you
Like I only got one time
To tell you all the things that you've done
That make me fall so in love with you
And it's a feeling I could never undo
So baby, I'ma sing this to you
Like this was MY LAST SONG
Like this was MY LAST SONG
If you want nothing else to close the second
Giving all of yourself, and you won't regret it
'Cause if you're crazy in love, you gotta say it enough
You gotta say it enough!
If this was MY LAST SONG,
I wouldn't waste one lyric on what went wrong,
The melody would dance like you do
And I would repeat the beat,
But always some new
So baby, I'ma sing this to you
Like I only got one time
To tell you all the things that you've done
That make me fall so in love with you
And it's a feeling I could never undo
So baby, I'ma sing this to youA Scent of rain
A healing breeze
Is blown into my face
To feel desire
And raise my head
To gaze at the sky
And watch the setting sun
Breaking through
The darkened clouds
And I feel that I
Am still alive and breathe
For all the world to see
You can bind my blood
But the spirit will remain
For all the world to see
No matter what you claim
The spirit will remain
They wanna see me down
On my wounded knees
Wanna see me cry
But my eyes
Have run out of tears
When there's nothing left to pay
Just a little light of day
I got something
You can't take away
Fly away
Far away
Deep inside
Shetter for my spirit and my pride
For all the world to see
You can bind my blood
But the spirit will be free
Forevermore...Christian slaves
and their church
must be destroyed
raped and killed
This is the battlecry !
Their God is dead
they praise the corpse
now burn their churches
Kill them all
This is the Battlecry !
This means war against the christian belief
we'll win this war and we'll drink the toast of victory
Fight, rape and kill
Burn, cut, destroy[music by Acres/Walsh, lyrics by Reigel/Coker]
entering a new world
of hate and deception
useless massacres cut and dissected
there is no law all are defenseless
where to go now
lands filled with sickness
blinding brightness swealtering heat
eye of the night safe til dawn
infertile earth ruins from humans
strong will survive
weak will die suffering
must take cover light is near
rations deplenished
hard to stay alive
night grows shorter
dread of the future
difficult to breathe
elements unleashing
drawing closer to the sun
world is crumbling destiny of man
fate will fall fury on planet
civilization swallowed no life
as we know it
[solo: Walsh, solo: Walsh]Oh, the divine ones
lo thy eyes on these flames
for eleven more times
I will spurn the light, I will burn herein this night.
And seeth the rise of a-man
the rise of the beast
and the fall of the light
[Chorus]
Aah...the night, embracing me thou winds by my side.
Aah...the night, feeling the night in the god`s throne...
a-night!
And the deeds done, one-three
here, god-forsaken, I forever bleed
And seeth the seed of the night
the one, bleeding
forever spurning the light
Oh, the heavenly ones
lo thy eyes on me
for eleven more times
I will be roaming this forever night
Seeth the fall of a-man
the fall of man-beast
the rise of the chaoschrist
[Chorus]
Aah...the night...Apostasy, disbelief
Pure desolation of humanity
Demi-gods, the true monsters
And their dreadful multitude of massacres
Hypocrisy, insufferable unmercy
Deception, insufferable, inhumane
Led to slavery and torture
Appointing demi-gods, intrepid tasks
Immolating on its flame
Heathen martyrs burn away
Burn away!
Immolating on its flame
Heathen martyrs, cleansed by fire
The others soon faced
Unspeakable horrors
Incessantly tortured
Hypocrisy
Insufferable blasphemies
A reign on monsters
Worshipped blindly
Christians obsession with demons
Fostered what they tried to repress
Apostasy, disbelief
Pure desolation of humanity
Demi-gods, the true monsters
And their dreadful multitude of massacresSever the ties or it's all for nothing
Without a warning out of site
All these thoughts keep plaguing my mind
You saw this coming, you're out of time
So you can rot with the ones you left behind
Nowhere to run, had this feeling
Right from the start
Another lie that I could not forgive
And now the rope's around your neck
Well it never was, yeah it never was
Well I hope you're good at starting over
Yeah it never was
And it never is going be
You act like nobody knows
If you're not at fault
Then who is in control?
Don't you try to put this on me
Burn your bridges
Buried beneath
This can't be all for nothing
Sever the ties or it's all for nothing
Nowhere to run, had this feeling
Right from the start
Another lie that I could not forgive
And now the rope's around your neck
Well it never was, yeah it never was
Well I hope you're good at starting over
Yeah it never was
And it never is going be
One by one
You reap what you sew
The thought of revenge is all that I know
One by one
You reap what you sew
I'm calling you out
Just to watch you choke
One by one
The thought of revenge is all that I know
One by one
I'm calling you out
Just to watch you choke
Nowhere to run
Had this feeling
Right from the start
Another lie that I could not forgive
And now the rope's around your neck
Well it never was, yeah it never was
Well I hope you're good at starting over
Yeah it never was
And it never is going be
Well it never was, yeah it never was
Well I hope you're good at starting over
Yeah it never was
And it never is going be
This can't be all for nothing!There once was a time
Where everything was just so perfect
Now everything has changed
And you've become a total stranger
I see another side to you
I never even knew existed
Dirty little secrets, dirty little secrets
Giving in to your primal instincts
Another taste is what you're looking for
There's nothing left so you can't take any more
You chewed me up and spat me on the floor
Straight for the throat you're like an animal
Before the kill, like you're an animal
Straight for the throat you're an animal
There once was a time
When anything I do is for you
But everything has changed
And I've become a lonely prisoner
I'd kill, even die for you
You never even tried resisting
Dirty little secrets, dirty little secrets
Giving in to your primal instincts
Another taste is what you're looking for
There's nothing left so you can't take any more
You chewed me up and spat me on the floor
Straight for the throat you're like an animal
Before the kill, like you're an animal
Straight for the throat you're an animal
(You're an animal)
Dirty little secrets, dirty little secrets
Dirty little secrets, dirty little secrets
Dirty little secrets, dirty little secrets
Dirty little secrets, dirty little secrets
Another taste is what you're looking for
There's nothing left so you can't take any more
You chewed me up and spat me on the floor
Straight for the throat you're like an animal
Before the kill, like you're an animal
Straight for the throat you're an animal
Before the kill, like you're an animal
Straight for the throat you're like an animalDoodily Ding Dong Tick Tock

Dethklok
DethklokYou're welcome my children of the Night to my world of chaos/sanity is just a weird form of madness/open your pity souls and taste the power of my dark spirit
The ashes scattered in the mists of time/the blood spilled in the meadow dried since long ago/how I long to own such power/perhaps I will obey the dark spirit's call
He leads my steps to the ancient darkwell ground/a reflection of my image/cold water starts to move...with a scary sound/in the well the spirit rises
Is this torture never ending, is this pain inside me real/overwhelming lust all I feel/in my mind forbidden thoughts, will this be the last day/is this the price to pay
Offer your soul my child/take it Lord/give it to me now/I'm only yours/swear your oath to me/I swear/you're one of my creatures now/why the pain doesn't endA showdown of knowledge and death that won't die
It's the zombies versus the world
Trembling scalpels invading the minds of creatures we so little know
But studies are slow and time's moving fast
To question these cause of events
We must conquer the doubts of ending this plague,
What weapon will outdo theit best?
They reach for their poisons their guns and killing bombs
The might of the armed forces may soon just get their way
To unleash a horde of chemicals from which this all began
Bio-weapons on the loose but warfare's not the answer
How easy men weaken when life is on the line attempting to close every eye
Like a key to a fortune hidden away but the blood will soon enough spill
Unable to fend, protect and to serve the cowardly troops how they fall
So much for the strong, heros, and saints everyone dies in this tale
Afraid to confront the one real truth how quick they point the finger
The mark of scorn to someone else for right can do no wrong
To take these fiends and give them back to earth and to the grave
Too many hands control the wheel that's steering us straight to hell
Pleading for life are scared, frightened fools who once carried power inside
Now knowing they're beat they beg and they plead to quickly be forgiven
But no one cared when the hand of deception
Was turned to their side of the coin
They laughed and lived at others expense but the dead just don't forgive
In life, in death, forever.....
Mysterious research!!!
Monsters do exist, in us and among us, they walk in our every shadow,
They prey on man more as he fears them less,
We should know for we created them!
Entering the brain of something quite strange, trying to solve and control
Climbing inside a monster's mind in search of knowledge unknown
As experiments continue all through the night
The doctors proceed with their tests
Death is examined inside and out until the world's convinced
There's no tomorrow.....Born to a whore on a Parisian floor
In the ides of march, a babe to abhor
Pardon my French, but life really sucked
When you're born and grow up an ugly duck
To the smiths to work my mother bade me
But play with the fire and you'll get burnt, you see
For after the boss gave me a beating
I lit up the kiln to blow up everything
Merde!
Villagers threw stones at the sight they saw
A crispy pyromaniac with no lower jaw
For this curse of life, I got my revenge
Burning all Europe from Rome to Stonehenge
Then one day I wandered to a most depressing place
Creepsylvania!!! With no food for my face
Alone in a grave, I thought that was it
Till two hooded ghouls came to steal all my shit
This ones alive the chunky one said
Give him my grog and they tipped back my head
That is Fermentor heres meat to gnosh
Hey Digestor lets teach him to mosh!!!
They asked me join 'em and gave me an axe
Then we added Dissector, it was on Maniaxe
And with my friends help, I'll torch every fool
Cremator burns all in the name of Ghoul!!!![Lyrics by RMS Hreidmarr]
Make love with chaos, once in a lifetime...
I've seen the son of the man
He came to save the ones who were lost
Fathers shall not be condemned to death for the sons
Neither shall sons for their fathers
And everyone shall die for his own sin.
Holy me, blessed be
Arisen in the ASA glory
ASA, Sahasrar shall abolish the man in me
Black Death, nonetheless...
Black Death, nonetheless
Black Death for me
For my disease is carrying all the sins of humanity
For my death shall be the negation of your miserable existence
I was talking with Lucipher yesterday
He said he loved you, monkeys
He's the only one who cares about you, masses
I don't care, don't give a good goddamn
May you all die, bunch of pigs
Wish I was dead and crucified too
Stigmatized by your weak, ignorant moral
My body's raped and desecrated by your innoncent newborn sons
Anus-Dei
God, their flesh tastes so good
Flagrance of the Apokalypse
Lucipher was born a long time after me
And you love to gently caress his perfect hair
What a beautiful child you have, Madame
Ah, comme je peux hair tous ces miserables assemblages de chair
Ces relations faibles et repugnantes
Mais comment ne pas vomir sur ces corps abjects
Ces tripes fumantes enlacees ?
Ah, si seulement je pouvais broyer toute cette viande pourrie
Dechiqueter ces putains d'esprits
Expulser leurs fluides, leurs ames, toute cette atroce puanteur
Ah comme je peux hair celui qui a ose les creer
Je lui ferais bouffer toutes ces creatures
Jusqu'a ce qu'il en creve
Et qu'enfin je retrouve la sphere divine
Vierge et immaculee
Car Dieu m'a dit... toute vie doit cesser...Das Schlob stand da, in ewiger Stille, eingehllt von grauem Nebel wie von
einem Mantel. Unerschtterlich harrte es seit Jahrtausenden,
eingeschlossen in jenes Tal, das sich von den Niederungen des Nebels bis
zum Gebirgsmassiv der Sonne erstreckt. Aber was mochte sich in diesem
dunklen, einsamen Gemuer verbergen? Jedermann mied es, selbst das
Sonnenlicht schien seine khlen Mauern nur widerwillig zu wrmen, und
die groen Zugvgel setzten ihre Reise tunlichst fort, statt sich auf
seinen schmierigen Zinnen niederzulassen.
Aber ich war kein Zugvogel, und auch nicht das Licht der Sonne, nein, ich
war die Nacht, eingehllt in einen Mantel aus Sternen und Wolken,
Wind und Finsternis, Klte und Angst. Der Mond war mein Gefhrte, als ich
die Niederungen des Nebels durchquerte; er war es, der mich hierher
fhrte, bis zu dieser einsamen Festung. Aber im Grunde wute ich es schon
immer. Ich wute es von der Grauen Herrscherin, die in Marillon weilt,
und vom Alten Eisknig in seinem Kristallpalast, hoch oben in nrdlichen
Landen. Selbst mein Brutigam sagte es mir, in einer lngst
verflossenen Epoche.
Dies ist mein Reich, dies ist mein Schicksal. In der Stille des alten
Gemuers hier vor mir werde ich endlich die mir gestellte Aufgabe erfllen
knnen. Der quadratische Turm beobachtet mich vom Bollwerk herab wie ein
Wachposten auf dem Festungswall. Hier werde ich nicht auf Abwege
kommen, und mein Geist verliert sich nicht in den Irrgrten des Fleisches.
Die Berge rings umher werden mich wohl beschtzen."Zuhause" - wie
sonderbar dieses Wort aus meinem Munde klingt. Immer unterwegs, nie eine
Rast; genau wie der Wind, der alles berhrt und nichts ergreift. Und
siehe da, ich bin am Ende der Reise. Selbst der Wind kommt hier zur Ruhe,
in den feuchten Abgrnden der Erde. Aber ich werde nie ruhen. Denn
jetzt beginnt die wahre Reise, nun fngt das eigentliche Abenteuer an, das
mich neue Ziele, neue Horizonte entdecken lassen wird. Schon erblicke
ich sie dort in der Ferne, sie scheinen zu warten, unbeweglich in ihrer
absoluten Transzendenz.
"Die Tore mgen sich ffnen! Die Zugbrcke werde herabgelassen! Die
Herrscherin ist endlich gekommen". Ja, endlich bin ich zu Hause.Rage! Rage! Rage! Rage!
Rage Hard!
Laugh like the head of Apollo
Young and strong on the wings of tomorrow
Rise up in millions get off your knees
Dispelling the demons
In the valley of danger
We all work together, sculptures in sorrow
With love light to follow, on
Sweet head of Apollo
Rage hard, into the light
Rage hard, doing it right, doing it right
Rage Hard, against the dark
Rage Hard, make your mark
Let the tournament begin
Don't give up and don't give in
Strength to rise up, strength to win
Strength to save the world from losing
Rage Hard, into the light
Rage Hard, doing it right
Rage Hard, against the dark
Rage Hard
Rage!
Rage Hard
Though blue eyes of children
They shine without fear
Hope is the future, with oceans of cheer
Nothing to fear
There's nothing to fear
Though laughter of angels resounding
From heaven keep fighting the favours
Of charlatan saviours, charlatan saviours
Rage hard, into the light
Rage hard, doing it right, doing it right
Rage Hard, against the dark
Rage Hard, make your mark
Let the tournament begin
Don't give up and don't give in
Rage hard, into the light
Rage hard, doing it right
Rage Hard, against the dark
Rage Hard, make your mark
I don't know which way to go
My love's like driven snow
When we past the test of time
My love you shall be mine
And if only, lost and lonely
Is all that's wrong with me, we' ll be free
Be free, be free
Laugh like the head of Apollo
Young and strong on the wings of tomorrow
Rage Hard
Rage Hard
Let the tournament begin
Don't give up and don't give in
Rage Hard, into the light
Rage Hard, doing it right
Let the tournament begin
Don't give up and don't give in
Strength to rise up, strength to win
Strength to save the world from losingFor words, two minutes, three years for my fingertips to grow numb. Could this be the moment when the "finally" becomes the "wish i could". Desperation and outstretched memories, now i see you only in bad dreams. i never reset. I only see you in bad dreams. let me explain. close enough to feel your words. far enough to read your flesh.And I saw an angel coming out of heaven.
Holding the key to the abyss,
And in his hand the key to the abyss.
He seized the dragon that ancient serpent
And bound him for a thousand years.
He threw him into the abyss
And sealed it and locked it over him.
To keep him from decieving the nations
Any more until the years were ended.
After that he must be set free for a short time.
When the thousand years are over
satan will be released from his prison.
He will go out to decieve the nations
In the corners of the earth, Gog and Magog.
To gather them for battle
In number they are like the sand.
They marched across the breadth of the earth.
And surrounded the camp of God's people.
The city he loves.
But!
Fire came down from heaven and devoured them.
And the devil who decieved them
Was thrown into the lake of burning sulphur
Where the beast and the false prophet has been thrown.
And they will be tormented.
Day and night forever.
Forever and ever!YOU TRY AND PLAY OUT THE VICTIM

MORAL STANDARD DISAPATES
NOTHING THEY COULD DO BUT WATCH IN FEAR
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS COWARD?
WHAT DID YOU THINK YOUD PROVE?
I HOPE INSIDE YOURE ROTTING
REGRET CONSUMING YOU
I HOPE THEY TEAR AT YOU AND
YOU HAVE A TASTE OF HELL
EVEN THEN THERED BE NO
JUSTICE FOR WHEN SHE FELL
DROWNIG OUT THE VOICES
OF THE MULTITUDES OF DEATH
FROZEN EYES OF FEAR LOOK ON
TO A TONGUE THAT SPEAKS GREAT THINGS UNTO THE WORLD
REASONS ARE SO FRUSTRATING
COZ EVERYBODY HURTS
BUT TO TAKE THE LIFE OF INNOCENCE
AND NOTHING CAN BRING IT BACK IT DONT MAKE SENSE
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS COWARD?
WHAT DID YOU THINK YOUD PROVE?
I HOPE INSIDE YOURE ROTTING
REGRET CONSUMING YOU
I HOPE THEY TEAR AT YOU AND
YOU HAVE A TASTE OF HELL
EVEN THEN THERED BE NO
JUSTICE FOR WHEN SHE FELL
WE ALL WONDER
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
INSIDE WE DIE
FOR WERE ALL TOO LATE
NO, DONT DO THIS
THE FLOWER HAS DIED
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS COWARD?
WHAT DID YOU THINK YOUD PROVE?
I HOPE INSIDE YOURE ROTTING
REGRET CONSUMING YOU
I HOPE THEY TEAR AT YOU AND
YOU HAVE A TASTE OF HELL
EVEN THEN THERED BE NO
JUSTICE FOR WHEN SHE FELLThese tears of sadness
Falling with the grace of autumn leaves
I have walked the path
Carried my mournful wounds
A burden I am (to you)
That is why I spilled my tears
These tears of sadness
Symbolise the absence of thoughts
(What have I done to deserve this)
That is why I cry
As the silence withers
These mournful tears of sadnessI could sit down, and write songs all day,
About almost anything you say,
The only objection is you,
I admire you from far away, I just can't think of what to say,
My friends notice my new ways,
What about you?
I think of you all times, all day,
I know how I am is just not okay,
But it's not like I'm trying to be this way,
(refrain)
I just wanna be with you, That's why I appear,
To take you away,
Away from here,
You are for me,
And I'm for you,
The pain I feel inside my heart,
Couldn't be more true,
I just wanna be with you.
I look out my window at every one,
And see you dancing in the sun,
My heart beats through my shirt all at once,
When I see you,
When I think of you, I breathe real fast,
The world seems really really vast,
You're at the front of my life's huge mast,
I guess I'll see you soon.
I just wanna be with you,
That's why I appear,
To take you away,
Away from here,
You are for me,
And I'm for you,
The pain I feel inside my heart,
Couldn't be more true,
I just wanna be with you.These hateful sounds of war
Just irritate my ears
The fire clouds in the sky
And nature disappears
[Bridge:]
Just think about it before it's done
Don't let these dreadful nightmares come
[Chorus:]
Depth of oceans and mountain's height
You can make them to live or to die
You should do for them something good
If you can
Burning forest, tears fall as rain
Animals scream because of the pain
Do you wanna see it again and again?
Catastrophes of this world
Threat of the nuclear blast
Hey human use your chance
Because the death is fastNo mercy for what we are doing
No thought to even what we have done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one
War without end
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
Blood feeds the war machine
As it eats its way across the land
We don't need the feel, the sorrow
No remorse is the one command
War without end
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
Only the strong survive
No one to save the weaker race
We are ready to kill all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your face
War without end
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
Attack
Bullets are flying
People are dying
With madness surrounding all hell's breaking loose
Soldiers are hounding
Bodies are mounting
Cannons are shouting to take their abuse
With war machines going
Blood starts to flowing
No mercy given to anyone here
The furious fighting
Swords are like lighting
It all becomes frightening to you
Know death is near, no remorseAlone on the top of the fells I chant for the wild moon
I wrote my chant for the moon's glory, for the lighter of my mood
I wish I could be one of his sons and one with the earth
So I could walk on the lunar path and chant forever
I'm the son of the moon, I'm one with the creator...
I praise the moon, wild moon is my nature
My life is so short but yours is sustained
And when I'll leave my chant will remain always with you my friend
On a crystal clear night I stare at the moon once raped by the sun, the
guardian of the woods
The spirit of the night, it gave me the wild life
Under the shape of the moon I've found the final truthIt's time for getting down.
Into the room like an illusion, in the corner of my eye,
the light reflected off of your glass, onto the base of your neck,
staring you down from the inside out and back again.
Nothing stands between us.
Staring you down from the inside out and back again.
It's time for getting down.
I always love a challenge, but I guess that this is too much.
I've got to make my move now, before you walk away.
My heart has failed my head again.
I can spend my life dreaming of how it would be breaking your heart for me
to stop misleading right now would be a great time to start.Your life means nothing.
Parting isn't such sweet sorrow.
Dripping with hate.
Words from the inner soul.
Realization of my ways.
Evidently unapparant.
Ignominous behaviour.
Physically repulsed by you.
Tormentation of emotion.
Occupy my every thought.
Freezing you, my infliction.
So cold that you will burn.
Excruciating pain you learn.
Mutual hate - on this vastitude of fate.
Only one stands to win.
Let the murdering begin.
Now you suffer.
Amongst all ye children now.
Cowards die often.
I will not let things lie.
Demise architecht.
This grudge will infect.Under pressure
Under control
Feeding the living
With the limbs of the dead
Long before the dawning
Longing for the fall
Hell, we keep the motor humming
I am humming, running dry
Black, on fire, arrows
Aiming in the sky
Searching for a shelter, home
Hiding from each other's pain
Wake me, take me
Turn around and hate me
I may not be good company
But I can kill your apathy
Near the end of the stay
Near the bottom of the line
We all follow the animal
And escape the pain
Now tell me more about the girl
That I'm supposed to be
Sometimes it seems I've had enough
To make me walk away
If this is what you want
Then this is what you want
Who would even bother?
Say, who wouldn't want it, too?
Love controls with silence
As it does with words
You used to say that I have fire
Now you're gonna see me burn
Bleeding desire
Beat inside, outside memory
Burning empire
Like a fever turning blood into fire
What I fake
In my head
Alone
Bleeds
Wherever
I go
Now is just
A matter of time
And we are less
Than a moment
Of high tension
Once bitten, twice shy
One is wrong and almost done
One is one plus one plus one
One is one more than just none
Another is just one
Another is just oneCrawling - Slowly
On the filthy smeary soil
Drowning - Falling
Into the crypts of burning flesh
Bleeding - Soring
Inwards to your rotten souls
Sweeping - Swarming
Around in the carnal halls of blood
Drivel around my hellish whores, consuming souls of the dead
Warfare against life - Bloodbath
I'm seeing it all through the eyes of the dead
Demons surrounds me - Carnage
I'm seeing it all through the eyes of the dead
Roaming - Floating
Onward through your empty veins
Seeking - Hunting
For a taste of boiling blood
Sneaking - Downwards
Into the tombs of morbid lusts
Twisting - Slithering
Around in my pool of blood
Drivel around my hellish whores, consuming souls of the dead
Warfare against life - Bloodbath
I'm seeing it all through the eyes of the dead
Demons surrounds me - Carnage
I'm seeing it all through the eyes of the dead
Floating into your filthy soul, onward through your empty veins
For a taste of boiling blood, I'm seeing it all through the eyes of the dead
Crawling - Slowly
On the filthy smeary soil
Drowning - Falling
Into the crypts of burning flesh
Bleeding - Soring
Inwards to your rotten souls
Sweeping - Swarming
Around in the carnal halls of blood
Drivel around my hellish whores, consuming souls of the dead
Warfare against life - Bloodbath
I'm seeing it all through the eyes of the dead
Demons surrounds me - Carnage
I'm seeing it all through the eyes of the deadFar within, when shall they return again?
Above the whore, to outshine every brilliant ray.
O see the face of disbelief.
O see the face of hatred.
Within it open into another world
At length he who torments with a hollow groan.
Each outcry does cease to sing
Each outcry wounded in the wing.
Each outcry I wander from here to there.
Each outcry I frown upon the eyes that stare...Hirudinoids
emotionless and feeding
threatened by anemia
i am helpless and bleeding
suspended in air
caught in another toothless dream
when pagans sleep
and atheists slumber
evangelists and bishops come to comfort one another
silent in prayer
caught in another toothless dream
possesion by twilight haunts me continuously
exercised upon my jaw
there in the garden
the serpent sings a lullaby
that summons the undead from the ground
as vampires and zombies
begin cicling around me
in the year of our lord continuum
possession by twilight haunts me continuously
exorcised upon my gums
possession by twilight haunts me continuously
time continuumI've felt the deadly grip of compromise
And fought to keep conviction burning in my eyes
Surrender perseverance doesn't recognize
And with the light of each new day I'll find my way
Beneath the pulsing beat of neon heat and city streets
Or on a mountain side under moonlit sky with stars on high
The answer lies not so much in where you are
But destination and what you'll find
Into the fire some would throw their lives
And hope that with security and fear subsides
Dreams and ambitions they would choose to hide
A disregarded spirit leaves them empty inside
Inside of every man a master plan the high command
Truth to one's self is shelter from the storm and keeps the sin unborn
The greatest truth I've ever known has been where truth begins where fear ends
How sad a man could lose his destiny to the powers that be in this world
For just outside this lifetime is a higher call stand or fall
Victory is more than just security
Affluency has no jurisdiction over death
Victorious the man who stands his ground and won't go down
But offers to the cause his every breath
I've felt the deadly grip of compromise
And fought to keep conviction burning in my eyes
Surrender perserverence doesn't recognize
And with the light of each new day I'll find my way
I've seen the empty eyes, believing lies hypnotized
I stand uncompromised and await the new sunrise
The greatest truth I've ever known has been
where truth begins is where fear ends
Victory is more than just security
Affluency has no jurisdiction over death
Victorious the man who stands his ground and won't go down
But offers to the cause his every breath["You asked me if I had a god-complex.
Let me tell you something: I am God!"]
From out of nowhere
Like a new born child he comes
With wisdom greater than the world
Some need to be lone
So that we will follow
This force messiah made of lights
He says come with me into eternity
Share this thing with me...
Prophet of pestilence
Holding on to the sounds of the weak without
Forces of tyranny in the night
In the dreams they will rise right on
The angels calling
With burning eyes of last
And they will fall down on their knees
The sign of the cross
Is in power
To manipulate the holy wars
He says ride the sky, into oblivion
Leave all you have behind...
Prophet of pestilence
Holding on to the sounds of the weak without
Forces of tyranny in the night
In the dreams he will rise right on
Prophet of pestilence
A disease in the railway with no one
Around and around they go
Carousel of emotions of dark betrayal
Prophet of pestilence
Holding on to the sounds of the weak without
Forces of tyranny in the night
In the dreams he will rise right on
Prophet of pestilence
A disease in the railway with no one
Around and around they go
Carousel of emotions of darks betrayalWhat would be if rules would be wrong?
If the words of your god are just a sad song
Maybe your friends are your worst enemies
Bad expectation spread fear like a deadly disease
What would be if dreams are the grave
Of inhuman ethics? Am I just a slave?
If eyes could talk the blind would be king
Hunger - damnation - war - suffering
Dungeon dreams
Scary bloody screams
Nocturnal ride
Schizophrenic suicide
[Chorus:]
Welcome to this nightmare
Welcome to the house of pain
Welcome to this nightmare
Welcome to the house of pain
What would be if time is too slow
To measure our standards in the death row?
Imagine intelligence would rule on this world
Manipulation would be something we've never heard
Dungeon dreams
Scary bloody screams
Nocturnal ride
Schizophrenic suicide
[Chorus:]
Meet your destiny in the race of pain nothing will remain
Meet your destiny foresee the end we will pretend
Meet your destiny human pigs are the worst animals
Meet your destiny only bad dreams - reality
[Chorus:]You sense the thunder and chaos subside
Standind proud among all of their lies
Never to burn your eyes again and
Listen to their hollow words
And forever question what awaits you there
You're tasted sin
You're tasted truth
AS a blind you've seen the world
Bearing the weight of it all
Never to repent if it should fall
Can you remember - Will you remember
The days of lust and greed
No fortitude from the written word
Did prayers bring them closer to the savior
Or did they bleed
Falling to their knees
Questioning theis believes
You're tasted sin
You're tasted truth
To shed some light on the mystery
Bearing the weight of it all
Never to repent if it should fall
Through ages of no innocence
Nothing to confide in
Never wash the sins away
There can be ''No absolution!''
There can be ''Only one!''Fated to ceaseless misery
Lair thief destroyer
You poison life with pain
Leading sheep to the slaughter
Weariness for the souls you have taken
You now face eternal torment
Your corpse will rot
Your weakness makes me laugh
Wages of your lost war
CHRIST has conquered you satan
Your evil power is useless
Against JESUS my SAVIOR
Maggots will feed upon your skull
When CHRIST destroys your rotting soulA Blank Expression
Pales eyes wide cocked back
The sheer stagnation
Shame to all who thought this an act
The best years of this life
Felt wasted protecting a secret
Insecurities fed on like a rat
Depression
True fears of dependency
Affliction
The scars on such a fragile little body
Look
Take a look inside the horror
Take a look inside
Visualize the horrors inside
Burning Sensation
To live just one day
In pure elation
Blame the ones who took this away
Can't provide shelter from
The dangers festering outside
Can't provide safety from
Monsters trapped within the mind
Depression
True fears of dependency
Affliction
The scars on such a fragile little body
Look
Take a look inside the horror
Take a look inside
Visualize the horrors inside
Shake the hand of God
As the blade moves closer
The reflection is brighter than the sun
The perception becomes weaker
The sun starts to fade away
The blank expression on the blade
Skin Calloused yet easy to pierce
On the floor, blood mixed with, tears
Look
Take a look inside the horror
Take a look inside
Visualise the horrors inside
Shake the hand of God
As the blade moves closer
The reflection is brighter than the sun
The perception becomes weakerTonight I'm feeling so strange
I feel a strange sensation
a dark unwell in my brain
tell me baby what is happening?
The moon is higher tonight
it's full and red as blood
her light makes me blind
makes me feel all more badly.
The moon's ring is glowing always so much
the night becomes all so bloody
and a growing fury makes one's way on me.
Now yeah, now I realize!
I read the terror that's born in you!
It's him who wants this happen
it's him who now's the master of me!
I see my body covered by hair
teeth an ears are prolonging more!
I'm changed! I'm no more a man!
I'm become a Werewolf!
Now my view strikes terror into you
your frightened eyes are waiting death
you know that HE's now inside of me
so you're the victim of my new being!
This night I'll tear you into pieces!
My claws will caress your corpse
and your blood will satiate my thirst
'cause tonight I'm a Werewolf!!!Let's call this everything what is seems
A violent distortion of ALL my dreams
Just to spite the cold that seems to feed
And still it burns inside of me
When everything and nothing become the same
And everyone's at fault but no one's to blame
Question is- will you remain the same?
Or will you half step you life away?
Now I'm lost in this without all the rest- it Seems so close but so far away
Fall in line or be what's forgotten
Hurts as much to say
NEVER NOTHING
And though I try
so why do you give this away?
So you will know
this love I call a lie
Then you will say
so why do you give this away?
So you will know this love I call a lie
Defining Definitions of what should be
One part honest and two parts mean
Believing nothing - seeing is all I need
Judging for myself what will come for me
when all of it is here it moves so slow
But I wonder will I know
Planting all the seeds of doubt that grow
when these fields of hate take hold
Fall in line or be what's forgotten
Now I'm lost in this without all the rest- it Seems so close but so far away
Hurts as much to say
NEVER NOTHING
so why do you give this away?
And though I try
So you will know
this love I call a lie
Then you will say
so why do you give this away?
But with all things involving the dream
So you will know this love I call a lie
The push/ pull is not what it seems
The love/ hate of what it all means
Has taken the life out of me
and I know that it's so hard to find
And then even harder to hide
but it's yours to decide
I'm lost in this without all the rest- it Seems so close but so far away
Fall in line or be what's forgotten
Hurts as much to say
NEVER NOTHING
And though I try
so why do you give this away?
So you will know
Then you will say
this love I call a lie
So you will know this love I call a lie
so why do you give this away?
And though I try
So you will know/
so why do you give this away?
this love I call a lie
Then you will say
So you will know this love I call a lieso why do you give this away?Once I desire, eternity has come
Pull back, the tale is black, all we have to die
You say so, I am invading vision, satisfy
Once I look back, so miracle
On a crib with the night
Sensation, call me to die
Look down, we have to sow and all waits to say go
Once I desire, be back to hear this cry: let me out
(And I am the first one, any want to die)
[Chorus]
With my salvation within your pain
You gotta develop pain into your desires
What it always about, you raise your pain
Why you can't desire your cold regained?
Come on, get down
I touch your legs, so cold, make me cold in the light,
And I burn now, no pain
Your pain seems so far away,
So everything that's cold in light may die down
[Chorus]
You raise your pain and I kill your strain,
Anyway, I get into your desires my way
I crave your pain
I can't swallow your pain, why you returnedThrough your teeth will my desire
Give life to this sickening perversion
This distortion of passion
Oh, how this infernal evening hath
Surrendered the beat of my heart
With every lacerating breath
Do my veins swell in eager await
Devour me, I beg of you in quickened breath
My flesh enveloped in this most
Disgusting forms of mortal indulgence
Do not deny me pleasure
For we now unabridged will be complete
As I shall rest inside of you forever
In orgasmic captivation
Am I pleased with such voracity
Let go your moral anchor and descend beside me
Our hands in flesh made metaphor, entwined forever
This love I have offered in banquet be yours
The entombment within my only desirein a dream a beauty lives
lots have tried to kiss her lips
and touch her naked body
in a dream a beauty lives
she'll fill your mind complete
unforgettable she is
you've sold your soul
this could have been your swan song
your god won't listen to your prayers
depraved you are
this could have been your swan song
you've entered a labyrinth
there's only one way out
you've sold your soul
a demon from the underworld
totally irresistible
beautiful and frightening
a demon from the underworld
she'll lead you to the one and only
Infernal Majesty
you've sold your soul
slowly you'll understand
you've sold your soul
you're one with the Beast
forget what's left behind
forget your former life
your soul's made free
the world's waiting for YOU
enjoy the pleasures of the flesh
in a dream a beauty lives
lots have tried to kiss her lips
and touch her naked body
in a dream a beauty lives
she'll fill your mind complete
unforgettable she is
you've sold your soulKANJI LYRICS

My wrath is growing stronger every day
I am the shadow in every night
I am the demon, born of black and raised in hate
My eyes are bleeding those crimson tears
My kingdom is calling stronger every day
I am the silence in every night
I am the demon waiting for the dawn to come
I'm at the gates of eternal sin
My kingdom come, my will be done
I'm at the gates to eternal sin
still waiting for the dawn to come
I scream in silence of pain and fear
There's no salvation for all my sins
The storm is coming, the dawn of flames
I walk the darkness waiting for the dawn to comeBelow cavernous dwellings
Rodents breed
The heirs to secrecy
And deceit
Upon their countenance dwelling
Mark of Cain
The wrath that their lineage bears
Sons of Shem, Talmudic tribes
Sacred text served to heal
Wounded pride
Salvation sought
Through but one portal
By deception thou shalt make war
Below cavernous dwellings
Rodents breed
The heirs to secrecy
And deceit
Upon their countenance dwelling
Mark of Cain
The wrath that their lineage bears
Sons of Shem, Talmudic tribes
Sacred text served to heal
Wounded pride
Salvation sought
Through but one portal
By deception thou shalt make war
The miserable wrought
Clannish race
The most despised among all
Roman slaves
Below cavernous dwellings
Rodents breed
The heirs to secrecy
And deceit
Upon their countenance dwelling
Mark of Cain
The wrath that their lineage bears
Sons of Shem, Talmudic tribes
Sacred text served to heal
Wounded pride
Salvation sought
Through but one portal
By deception thou shalt make war
Sickly minds, perverted wrath
Reveals hereditary taint
Cavernous pits of earth open wide
Receive malnourished forms
With great delight
Tattooed unto
Their arms was a brand
Blood in the face, jews lie slain
Destination once not known
Shock on their faces
As the gases flow
Bodies are pushed into the pilot light
Only ashes lie slain
Cavernous pits of earth open wide
Receive malnourished forms
With great delight
Tattooed unto
Their arms was a brand
Blood in the face, jews lie slain
Destination once not known
Shock on their faces
As the gases flow
Bodies are pushed into the pilot light
Only ashes lie slainShadows turn to shape, as another day slips away
Without a thought of you, I knew that this was to good to be true,
I cant believe my eyes, it's been 7 months and still you cry,
The thought of me singing you to sleep.
Time passes by and still we try to rewrite the past and make our future plans,
And if we'd only noticed that,
Right nows the only time we have complete control,
So lets let today know.
We're done running away from decisions we made,
And the chances we take along the way
(no more regret) Lets just throw away the past
(no more regret) Another chance to make this one last
(no more regret, open up your eyes and see what the life is like)
Time passes by and still we try to rewrite the past and make our future plans,
And if we'd only noticed that,
Right nows the only time we have complete control,
So lets let today know.
We're done running away from decisions we made
And the chances we take along the way [x2]
We're done running away [x15]The earth is shaking
The others are testing
Our commitment to the Lord
This is now
We must stand
We, the warriors of the Lord
Of the Lord
Lets mount up
And grab the sword
The flaming sword
Against the legions of the dark
Of the dark
I will face you
Son of the morning
Like the Lion faces its prey
I will hunt you down
Astray
Rise up, rise up from the grounds
Rise up rise up, like He rose
This is the day, come on lets fight
This is the day, one of the light
Lets mount up and grab the swordIt's hot as hell in here
Everybody wants to lose control
The music's turned up loud, the lights
We'll turn them low
Wound up like a hurricane
And my head's about to explode
Can't wait to self-destruct
Can't wait to let it go
Whoa-oh she hits the stage
Whoa-oh she makes me crave
So come and get my money (whoa)
I can feel your fever, taking over
Can you see your fever, taking over me
I can feel your fever, taking over
Got a dirty feeling, that you're the remedy
Whoa come on!
So I'm looking for a spark
I've got a body to re-ignite
Don't worry you won't get burned
So don't, don't put up a fight
Push hard to breaking point
And I'm ready to overload
No limits and no regrets
It's time to sell my soul
Whoa-oh you're all I want
Whoa-oh you're all I need
So come and take my money (whoa-oh-oh-oh)
I can feel your fever, taking over
Can you see your fever, taking over me
I can feel your fever, taking over
Got a dirty feeling, that you're the remedy
That you're the remedy
Come here you naughty girl you're such a tease
You look so beautiful down on your knees
Keep on those high heel shoes rip off all your clothes
You smell so fucking good it makes me lose control!
Losing control! (You're all I want)
Selling my soul! (You're all I need)
Losing control! (You're all I want)
I can't let you go!
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
I can feel your fever, taking over
Can you see your fever, taking over me
I can feel your fever, taking over
Got a dirty feeling, that you're the remedy
That you're the remedy
You are the remedy!Alone he stands in the doorway
His family still asleep
Gazing at the starlit horizon
And the moonsparkling sea
When dawn comes he must leave them
His home, his children and loved
For his destiny beyond those waves
Known only to the Norns
He's already dressed ready to leave
His four friends are waiting by the shore
Each with a dragon ship
And one hundred men prepared for war
He returns to his bed kissing
His sleeping wife goodbye
And as he leaves his youngest son
A tear rolls from his eye
They set sail with the first morning rays
Heading for glorious wars
And as the five ships steer out from the bay
Their hearts pound like never before
The wind is strong, the sun is warm
Their Dragons fly across the waves
No greenfaces are seen here onboard
Only a crowd of braves
Many nights pass
And days long as a year
They await the battle
They await without fear
On the morning of the fifth day
Before the sun arose
They hear bells chime and see pyres
Torched at a nearby coast
"LOWER THE SAIL, GRAB YOUR OARS,
NOW MEN IT'S TIME TO ACT!
ROW LIKE THE WIND TO THE SHORE,
ROW LIKE THE WIND TO ATTACK!"ONCE I WAS SENT TO BRING BACK YOUR BREED TO THE LORD

THE JUDAS TO THE HOLLOW BUT REVELATION TO THIS WORLD
THIS IS THE END OF YOUR MYSTIC PROPHECIES
AND THE DAWN OF A NEW AGE OF REALITYAlive alone now that they've gone dead but unburied
I've seen it unfold, terrible scenes of agony
Eyes in the darkness
Echoing their madness
The sights that have passed before them
Watching as though it has never happened
Now I only listen to what is not spoken
Murder, hatred
Anger, savage
Killings I have caused
More than can be counted
Orgies of sadism
And sexual perversion
Virgin
Tied to my mattress
Legs spread wide
Ruptured bowel, yanked
From her insides
Devirginized with my knife
Internally bleeding
Vagina, secreting
Her blood-wet pussy
I am eating
On her guts I am feeding
Mutilated with a machete
I fucked her dead body
The first and last
Your life's only romance
My knife's jammed in your ass
As you die you orgasm
Pass on to the dead
Nerve trembling convulsions
No longer looking human
I never see them, but I know they're there
Locked in my subconscious
Obscene memories I thought I'd forgotten
Haunting unrealities
Tear at me
Hold her arms
Her mouth taped shut
Screams unheard
Out pour her guts
Layers of flesh peeling away
Languish in your own decay
Descriptions of my killings
Bone chilling
Terror, tear, her
Virgin cunt
Virgins are my victims
Their tight interiors I explore
Sharpened utensils of torture
Now inserted inside of her
Sex organs extracted for eating
On her liver I am gnawing
Forbidden lust for guts
Ripped from her cunt
Tears of blood cry down her thigh
I ram my fist inside her hole
From her crotch piss now flows
Rectum filled with shit
I fucked her emptied body
Until she became stiffUp the date
And up the cunt
With my fingers
I will hunt
Score you holes
Touch the sides
And grip the skin
That divides
The thumb in the ring
Middle finger
Up your cunt
Pinch it like a crab
Make the bitch feel the itch
Feel the pain
Will you cope
Nip the skin
From cunt and ring
This is not
An evil thing
Ease away
Out of the cracks
Like your fingers
Here comes some snacksI love life but I don't think life loves me
I'll recreate my own reality
The teachers and the preachers, they all lied to me
There's no end to what a kid will believe
You don't know what's going on
You believe what you've been told
You don't know what's up
You believe what you've been told
Columbus didn't discover america
Jesus wasn't the only son of god
If he even was the son at all
If there even is a god at all
Man on the platform builds a funeral pyre
Sign on the post says, "today we burn the liar"
Unbelievable nightmare, my body's on fire
Wish I could just wake up, flames around me growing higher
[Lyrics: brecht](Instrumental)..og nr mrket kaller gr jeg atter inn
jeg lukker porten bak meg, porten til mitt sinn
jeg stenger verden ute, alene i min ensomhet
jeg legger hodet p min pute, trene faller, en etter en
leve hvert sekund av et liv
d hvert sekund av en dd
Omsluttet av mrket, min lengsel og mitt savn
Tidens hjerte slr langsomt mens blodet enn er varmt
Mine sanser har forlatt meg, kun dden gjenstr se
Et skritt i riktig retning p den lange spiralen ned
..og du forsvant bort fra meg, du forlot dette sted
n er det bare kulden dele natten med
og mrket finnes der ute, og vinden blser kaldt
mens tomheten vokser i mitt sinn forstr jeg at vi begge har forfalt
Nattens blod har dekket meg, svnen vil best
Mrke skyer samles ingen kan meg n
Sanden har har rent ut av livets timeglass
Timen har kommet , jeg vil ta din plass[After about a minute of mixing]
[Bomb explosions, gun shots]
(You know what you be?)
[Fatal]
You be like the type that come at me
And shoot one at me,
Tryna set it,
Then get another nigga to dead it
Outlaws we 'trol heat
Ya cold feet remain frozen
As Hussein show thieves
That got our own name stolen
I'm Hussein,
Flyin' down 95 in two lanes
Wearin' fitted and blue chain
The one out of these two thangs
Hustle or be hustled,
Tussle and these tough
They sheaths hunt you down
When you around and ya knees buckle
Popped up, whopped up, glock cocked up
An' got ya cop shot up,
Came to shook shop up
I took money, gave 'em horror
Recruit crooks for me
Keep my finger on strap,
'Til the gat looked ugly
I mash fast illy
G-packers get bagged silly
We pack mac millis
You know the science for that
These niggas tryna rap
When I spit it like I'm committed
Wid triple and double digits
Bag whatever bubble wid it
All y'all gon' do is be talkin' while I walk
Wid the war you ball way
Either way you playin' ya partner
Watch me bop down ya block
Wid my suit and chocolates
On some Deathrow Pac shit
Outlaw Khadaf shit, I got this,
I let you know you playin' yourself
Ain't seein' a damn bit ah coke
You might be bangin' yaself
Talk that crew shit,
I'm knowin' already who ain't gon' do shit,
Pack one nasty new wid, a lil' bit of blue shit
Confucious, run deep from Jerz,
Right off clue shit
Makaveli shit still bangin'
Y'all shoulda knew this
Y'all niggas gon' ride or dieI can't believe what I am hearing
You make my ears bleed so bad
I can see right through your lies
I stay and listen to what you are saying
Just empty words, made up stuff from
Your fantasy worlds, I got eyes, with them I can
See through just about anything
So far, so good, say what?
You're just acting like a fucking fool
So far, so good, say what?
I will deliver, I will maintain
I'm sane enough to make my own decisions
Don't need any rules I have my own
And I break them time after time
A mad dog in progress fulfilling my life
I've been on the right track since day one
Don't need to change my way of life, not ever
Gonna stay the same, I will remain
So far, so good, say what?
You're just acting like a fucking fool
So far, so good, say what?
I will deliver, I will maintain
Whatever comes in my way, I embrace it
Take it with me on my journey through life
Defending yourself with so worn out clichs
You say you are nothing, I say you are everything
You ever wanted to be
You should try to be true to yourself
Let your soul and heart guide you
Don't let your dreams just be dreams
Follow the leader, follow your heart
Just empty words, made up stuff from
Your fantasy worlds, I've got eyes, with them I can
See through just about anything
Don't need to change my way of life, not ever
Gonna stay the same, I will remain
So far, so good, say what?
You're just acting like a fucking fool
So far, so good, say what?
I will deliver, I will maintainMaggots eating rotten flesh
Chomping through a fucking mess
Eyes white and glazed
Bodies rise from their graves
Skin falling to the ground
In a decomposing mound
Their organs building up with pus
They're decaying in front of us
Zombies from the grave
Be the eternal slave
Zombies from the grave
Death is what they crave
As the dead still rise
Satiscation of human demise
They want to take the world
And turn it into our hell
Their power is a plague
Killing for their domain
Our death is what awaits
Our life goes on, but insane
Death shall rise
For our demise
Rotting stench
Our punishment
Now the time has come
To see what the dead's become
Demons from our past
Making our cities tombs
Quickly their plague has spread
Leaving everybody dead, The living hide away
While the dead leave decay
Death shall rise
For our demise
Rotting stench
Our punishment
Zombies from the grave
Be the eternal slave
Zombies from the grave
Death is what they craveBehold a white horse
And he who set upon him
Was called faithful and true
And in righteousness he doth judge and make war
His eyes were as a flame of fire
And on his head were many crawns
And he had a name written
That no man knew but he himself
And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood
And the armies followed him upon white horses
Clothed in fine linen, white and clean
And out of this mouth goeth a sharp sword
That with it he should smite the nations
And he shall rule then with a rod of iron
And the remnant were slain
With the swordChild offered to God
Soul sold by his
You're his life
You're his force
Fear their promises
They smell of lies
Shun their power
They will kill you
Child persecuted in faith
Soul humiliated on pyre
You're his life
You're his force
Listen to your heart
It cries your faith
Listen to your voice
It cries his nameCut in slice the son of god, thorns around his bloody hands
Nails through his skull...fucked by his cross
Thousand spears piercing his lambs
All his reasons are lost, torture in filthy sands
Jehova desecration!
Jehova desecration!
The salt is penetrating his wounds, his son is dead again and again
He'll die after life, suffering without end
For the forbidden sense of torture!
Jehova desecration!
Jehova desecration!People inside waiting
The bomb set into place
At the public building
Detonated
Floors dropping
The unseen buried below
Multiple carnage
The cracking and splitting of skin and bone
Concrete
Crushing
Bodies
The
Glass
Slices
Through skin
Twisted metal
Ripping apart
Screams can be heard
Somewhere from inside
Tons of bloodstained concrete
Piles of humans in the mound
Corpses fucking rotting
Concrete
Crushing
Bodies
The
Glass
Slices
Through skin
Twisted metal
Ripping apart
Screams can be heard
Somewhere from inside
BLASTED!!!!Who's world is this? Who's maddening world
Is this turned upside down or is right side up?
With peaceful lives now put at risk
It's thickening, it's so sickening
Might makes right but within our short sight
We can't see this light, has no end in sight
We stand on our freedom
To destroy that which we protect
Cutting our throats to save our necks
And it's thickening, it's so sickening
And if it would end, would this madman be your friend?
When the cost is the freedom lost, lay down
And you can tell me that you have heard
Now, tell me what's going on
And you can tell me all that you have read
Now, tell me what's going on
And you can tell me that you believe
But what the fuck is going on with this world?
Madmen roam this earth, I'd be a fool to say I approve
When they refuse to give us anything but untainted views
I don't trust one word
Pax Americana infidelis, will be the next cry of the world
Hold on to what you've got, hold on to all you've thought
Four hundred billion won't buy us peace of mind
But just keep that to yourself
Who are you to say, we've got nothing to fear?
Once we've wiped the board clear
When madmen become kings
Stand clear[Lyrics: A. Beckers, R. Tyssen]
Her last hour has come to past
Together we whisper her last
I'm trying to hide the tears
Created by my own fears
Now it's time to let her go
Time to relieve my soul
[Chorus:]
Holding her hand
Thought she would understand
Whishing that she could stay with me
So much to say
Now that she's on her way
Starting her unknown journey
Holding her hand
She's slipping through like sand
Wishing that she would stay with me
Together as one
The time for her has come
As she's turning her eyes away
I wish I could guide her
Lead her over all these lonely paths
Her time has come
I see you relieved
It makes me sad.
[Chorus:]
Holding her hand
Thought she would understand
Whishing that she could stay with me
So much to say
Now that she's on her way
Starting her unknown journey
Our separation is now complete
Why did she leave me so alone
Now that she's gone
Her love disappeared
I'm feeling coldYou told me nine times before and you said that her touch was not love all these years. You said that she stole and lied and you said to be "brave like me". And I couldn't believe when you said outlive, but I must come out and face the unwilling terms. These eyes they are old and can only focus on the son that I was, the wrong that I was. I tried to gape the teeth just so the water could fill my lungs. And all this time I thought I was drowning and all this time she made me and you caged me and beat me. These shackles reek of your cologne and manipulative phrases. She is dying and I wish Hell upon you one thousand times a day. I have her graft inside of me, she sewed this body and made these eyes. She put them in my head and gave me life. You gave me hate, greed, confusion and a shimmering blurred backhand of your affection. She is dying and I have come to realize this. He is breathing but should have stopped a long time ago. I know his heart quit but I have no reason for him to give anything. And she is dying and I have missed her life. She gave everything to me, I have so much conscience tied to my neck. I want to swim atop of this sea and give her all the love which has so diligently fallen under lock and key. it was so uneven and the anchor that I have woven is weighing and pulling me down to the bottom of this ocean. And I wish I could spread my wings far enough to stop this fall from grace but there is nothing I can do.Like the flight of a dead bird my life is going out
Darkness is my mistress at cold full moon nights
Only stars know my paths, I'm a wild wanderer of fields
Lonely trips in my realm... Will you share this with me?
As I howl at night, the wind join my song... Helpless crying of the wild
Am I soulless, forever gone?
After a while I hear a voice from the dark fields of the fall
It puts me the same question:
Shall I ever see the dawn? The sun of the dawn?
The old symbol of all dread, faithful son of the night
Too much bleeding, too much fear
But one's death is other's lifeThe deed is not the sin but the thought.
Slide in the aesthetics of the tempting white
Trapped beneath the laughter, insanity in disguise.
Eyes controlling hands craving life - Reality.
Infection injects injunction in the brains orientation...
Herdsman, hear the call of the wolves
Desultory smile of a blood-spitting mouth
Heterodoxy of a wizard's creation pray to the sands.
Have we fructified the frost with the pride?
We have failed.
We have played with the totem of gods.
Have we scented?
I wonder why I
Wonder
Still my "guilty"
Lets me know
I am left.
Left to leave.
Give me disease; paranoia lives within my soul.
Grotesque gentility; from the depths of isolation...
...Comes the speech of the tunnel's exit - Devilish.
Honesty; my only wish.
Masses of pus overcome my mind and... grin.
They grin.
Discerning the fascination of a wound.
They grin.
Formed from the mornings and the sin.
Hiding in the shadows of the sun.
...And grin.
Sheets of ice cover the nature
And the fires freeze to dust.
Antarctic dreams, hieroglyphics
Scrawled into the sky. No wrath
Within my heart I know my fault
I won't survive the loss
And the paroxysm leads me into
The
Sunburnt thoughts of frost...Drown me like the great flood
The one that struck few years ago
Fill me, I want to be fat
As if I were pregnant rat
Make me a happy bastard
With his belly like a pot
Cover me with your ocean
Blow me with your wrath
Suffocate me with your size
Make me flat like model's tits
Feed me with sight
I will explode like a tnt
Fill me up with your fuel
I'm going to whirr like a diesel
Mix me with your big-sick drink
I will feel the last vertigo
That's my soul, I wanna fill
Make's me smile, let's make that deal
That's my heart, you can rape
That's my body, you can take
Fill me please with your despair
I will be deep like remorse
Sell me your every tear
Easy! I will stand the strain
Spice your anger really hot
Easy! I will never puke
Pour it slowly into me
Pour it till I'm poisoned
That's my soul, I wanna fill
Make's me smile, let's make that deal
That's my heart, you can rape
That's my body, you can take
Suffocate me with your size
Make me flat like model's tits
Feed me with sight
I will explode like a tnt
Fill me up with your fuel
I'm going to whirr like a diesel
Mix me with your big-sick drink
Bite me, eat me
Pour it slowly into me
Pour it, I'm gonna fell hot!
That's my heart, you can rape
That's my body, you can take
That's my soul, I wanna fill
Make's me smile, let's make that deal
That's my heart, you can rape
That's my body, you can take!!!Beschreibung einer grausigen offenen Wunde. (Eigentliches Motiv der
Eintragung: Suche nach dem Mahlschatz meiner Mutter). In Joensuu lebten
wir irgendwo unter der Pietat meines Vaters und seiner pietatvollen
Angstigkeit, wahnhaft zu denken und wahnlos zu fuhlen, wann immer wir
zueilten, einen sterilen Gedanken aufzuschreiben. Der denkende Fortsatz m
Schrieb vor dem Einschlafen, um ein Traumbild zu leiten oder gedaknlich zu
kaudern, wenn der Fortraum seiner Ideen an ihren Verknupfungen
zerschellte. "Heute reinigte uns Mutter mit ihrem Speichel - fast im
Vobeihasten - Nasenlocher und Ohren. Ich zuckte immer zuruck, der
Speichelgeruch war mir unangenehm (1822)". Oder. "Wir spielten dann Schach
oder suchten die Figuren dazu und muhten uns gar nicht, zuzugeben, was wir
selbst vor Beendigung der Suchstrapazen gewult haben (1823)..."
Ich versuche nun standig, wahnhaft mit Kopfen zi denken, die mich selbst
betrachten, und wie plotzlich umstanden, weil hold im Gedanken eine Liebe
verfiel und die Kopfe vor Freude vergalen, die Augen zu schlielen. In
vollendete Schleimbeutel baden ihre Augapfel und raunend mit Messern
bewaffnet ich schwand auf das Schlachtfeld, um feindlicher Augfrucht die
Schneide zu kanten und gellendes Mitleid in Sunde zu beichten... zu
vergessen, zu schlafen, zu traumen. "Die Frauen der Umgebung salen
nebeneinander, auf Stuhlen gereiht, nur ungefahr bekleidet, sie tranken
den Tee, den man ihnen reichte, und ich hatte das Gefuhl bei Anblick
dieser Leiche wurden sie beginnen, an sich selbst zu denken. Gehullt ich
stand in Gedanken und warmen Stoffarben, futterte die Tauben vor dem
Sterbehaus und elend bat mich selbst in die Halle. Kommutabel meine
Haltung zur Totenwache, bieder noch kam mir der tote Korper verlassen und
armselig vor. Minuten spater wurde mir langweilig, ich strahlte mit mir
selbst um die Wette und sah auf die Uhr (1832)". Ich beende in Traumen
visionar meine Denkstrecke, schneide die Schale darein, dal Menschen von
Achtung mir schnen Bedenken und unter der Schleimhaut erneut tritt - doch
heller - ein Auge Hervor. Beschliele nie wieder zu schlafen, so lange die
Messer nicht scharfer und eun Kopf will reichen, die Sunde dem Sandmann zu
beichten...They flock around you
Like some hungry wolves
With their broken hearts
And their used up lies
They flock around you
Because you're beautiful
They'll do anything
To find your weakness
Don't fall, it's a bad idea
Don't fall it's a bad idea
A catastrophe
Oh can't you see
It's a bad idea
I'll get ya get ya flowers
I'll get ya get ya things
You give me superpowers
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'll get ya get ya flowers
Sweet lovin, rocks and rings
I'll make your heart believe it Anything thatyou want Anything I can get
Everything that I am
Is at your feet so don't forget I'll get ya get ya flowers I'll get ya get ya things I'll use up all my powers
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Because you're lonely
They can use your pain
To lure you close
Watch your backThis most unwitting occurrence
Is indeed about you
So take it
Or chalk it up
All the others before me
Can give what I doubt
Take what I've taken
The three of threes
Professes you to me
Challenging and the favour will be
Paid in full
Pounds of flesh
In perfect dress
Take what I've taken
This most unwitting occurrence
Is indeed about you
So take it
Or chalk it up
All these others before me
Can't doubt
What's killing you
Wells from inside
Atonement for the waste
Pleasure in one more accolade
Prehensive doubt prehensive ...
One day I know when I see you
Far from these days that beat us
Far from my habits perfect prison
One day, I know when I see you
Far from these days that beat us
Far from my habits perfect prisonSpent years in tears
Drown myself in fears
Lived in a cage filling
My life with rage
Tied my wings so tightly
Gravity feel mighty
Needed to feel the wind
Under my wings!
My wings are my eyes
I'm seeing the blue skies
I'll fly, I'll fly away
And will find my way!
Lost the joy of living
Closed my self from feeling
Lost the ability to fly and flee
Left my world with tears
Iron cage with fears
Strenghened my wings
Now I'm learning to fly!
My wings are my eyes
I'm seeing the blue skies
I'll fly, I'll fly away
And will find my way!Trying to conceal his murders
The maniac stabs the heart, stops the flow
Cleaning up the blood's a problem
He now solves, hooks through heels
Hung and bled
Corpses are suspended by their feet
Swaying, dripping, bloody piece of meat
Fastened to the ceiling leaking gore
Splashing down to the floor
Corpses he suspended turning pale
All the blood drained into his grail
Fastened to the ceiling, dry and dead
Fluids of life have been shed
Hung and bled
Congealing fluids fester the stench
Revolting septic gruel
Putrid slop licks the surface of his dungeon
A gruesome meal, rancid feast, live on death
Corpses dangle, lifeless, gray and cold
Rotting flesh, the meat hooks lose their hold
Stenching body falls onto the ground
Bones and flesh form a mound
Sanguinary killer will not stop
Hanging dead replacing those that drop
Blood, he drinks like wine, their flesh, his bread
In his maw dripping red
Hung and bled
Oozing blood the butcher's victims
Soak the concrete, putrefy
Halls of dread draped with death
Ornate crimes, stalactites made of flesh
Festooned with innards
Gaining life, sentient place
The stone walls breathe
Hungry soul, it can think
A genuine living hell
Created by the butcher, he lost control
Owner and property change their roles
Constantly feeding the gluttonous room
He once ruled the chamber, now it's his tomb
Hung by their feet, drained of blood
Swallowed by death, greed of this place
Bodies decay, devoured by evil
Slave to this hell he creates, undying
Corpses are suspended by their feet
Swaying, dripping, bloody piece of meat
Fastened to the ceiling leaking gore
Splashing down to the floor
Corpses he suspended turning pale
All the blood drained into his grail
Fastened to the ceiling, dry and dead
Fluids of life have been shed
Hung and bledTwo-face
That's what they call me
They call me a two-face
Two-face
That's what they call me
They call me a two-face
Two-face, boat-race disgraced
His face displaced again
Into two dimensions
Into two directions
Two-face, boat-race displaced
My face disgraced again
Into the dimensions
Into two directions
Nowhere for him to go
Nowhere for him to go
That's what they call me
They call me a two-face
Two-face
That's what they call me
They call me a two-face
Two-face, boat-race
Disgraced his face
Displaced again
Into two dimensions
Into two directions
Two-face, boat-race
Displaced his face
Disgraced
Into two dimensions
Into two directions
Origin horrible
Two-face, boat race
Disgraced
His face Displaced again
Into two dimensions
Into two directions
For all
For all to see
He thinks at dawn
He acts at noon
He stays alone
And in the evening
Two-face, both ways
Disgraced
His face displaced again
Into two directions
Into two dimensions
Left-side, horrible
Two-face, boat race
Disgraced
His face displaced again
Into two directions

Two-face
That's what they call me
They call me a two-face
Two-face
That's what they call me

Two-face, both ways disgraced
His face displaced again
Into two directions
Into two directionsLord make me an instrument of your peace
Where there is hatred let me sow love
Where there is injury, pardon
Where there is doubt, faith
Where there is despair, hope
Where there is darkness, light
And where there is sadness, joy
O divine master grant that I may
not so much seek to be consoled as to console
to be understood as to understand
To be loved as to love
For it is in giving that we receive
it is in pardoning that we are pardoned
And it's in dying that we are born to eternal life
AmenA bomb hits the city all life instantly vaporized
But I'm not so fortunate burning right before my eyes
Stumbling I trip over pieces of descending flesh
Leaving a pile of smoldering humanoid mess
Radiation
Coming in waves
Leading me to
A nuclear grave
Are you ready
Will you be
Will you fight WW III
Are you ready
Are you sure
Will you fight WW IV
Humanity somehow stood up on its mutated feet
Reeling with pride man just would not accept his defeat
Into the missiles deadly disease and poison gas
Launching them off terracidal journey kills the last
Vomiting blood
I choke on my tongue
The gas from above is filling my lungs
Chorus
Silence and darkness the species of man is extinct
The boiling oceans into which the continents sink
Gravity gone the moon collides with a dead earth
Flaming world out of orbit flying into deep space
Prey for your death
If you survive
You'll die in pain
In world war V
ChorusCompressed youthful voices
Suffer age
Below John's floors
Spoilage
Lingering death
Gagging your fears
Dead in horror
Grizzly facial stare
Unbelievable atrocity
Hateful monstrosity
Draining scientific minds
Pathological deeds
Creator
Executioner
Heresy
God's vision destroyed
Sinister joker
Childhood dreams
Laughing corruption
Compressed youthful voices
Suffer age
Below John's floors
SpoilageFeel my hands
Touch my pale face
My touch is vulnerable like a dust
It brings you lust
He came on wings of the wind
His vision in mortal mistress dream
He returned from the Shadow's Land
He was waiting for his bride
She was floating on the ware of delight
In his eyes she saw the depth of might
His kisses like wild wine
She saw candles of boundless right
Hold me tight
The sun is falling away
This fear every night
Every night I die
You can feel the body's heat
You don't know what it is
The frost of death
Hidden inside my vains
Hold me tight
Stop the time
Fly before it's not too late
I will be waiting till the End
When the clock struck midnight hour
They were dancing with desire
Those cursed words he said
His whispers: "Keep the faith"
In vain, it was too late
She forgot the love they've made
Fallen angel dying with teh starry night
Mystic preparation to eternal sleep
[written by P.Maslanka]The blind are dead
They don't see
They don't listen to reality
Walking in shadows
Which blind their sight
They live in darkness, without any light
Laugh at us, spit at us
When Jesus walked the earth
He suffered the same
The bible says we should be
Crucified with Christ
And in the end we recieve our gift
Eternal life
When you wake up in hell
Ask yourself
Was your image worth it?
Are you proud of yourself?
You had a chance to receive
To be a believer but
You turned your back on God
To be a crowd pleaser
You!
Walk around
Oh so, secure
But always in the end
It's just a stupid trip
You gotta keep that image
Gotta fit in
Playing up your image
It's an image of sin
Can't you see what I'm saying to you?
Jesus Christ has taken me
And made me new
I no longer have the shadows
Which blind my sight
I resolve
To walk in the lightMajesty I've seen the fate of your lands
visions of hell invaded my dreams
believe me I am your only chance
I will serve the peace of your land
To protect and save my beloved world
King Morick there's no time to waist
By mounds and plains I'll destroy the enemies
Eleandra will shine once again
Young Doryan we have heard your call
Prophecies will become reality
By mounds and plains you'll destroy the enemies
Osyrhia's light will shine once again
Gods of war, lands of freedom
On my way to battle
Lend me your force
I won't fight for gold or glory
I don't need no fame or pride
I will take my sword to veil upon my land
The victory is in my hands
Pain and torture, all I caught in my sight
the visions of terror have burned my heart
I won't fight for gold or glory
I don't need no fame or pride
I will take my sword to veil upon my land
The victory is in my hands
we won't fight for gold or glory
we don't need no fame or pride
we will take our sword to veil upon our land
The victory is our my handsCan't find a real answer
It's all the same
But when it all comes around
I guess it's kinda lame
I can hear you screaming
When it gets into your vein
Your high is repulsive
So full of pain
My soul's circumcision
Breed to give head
Liquid house of raindrops
Turn out to be dead
Returning to soma
Equinox of grief
My next incarnation in
Bonehouse
And it's about to crack
In this house of bones
Now heads start rolling
Instead of stones
Oblivions wounds
Dumb fuck despair
If I can't suck life deeper
How could I care
Get stoned
Get dead
Inside my flesh
The house of bonesI am possessed by death, perverted to unbelief
Showing no remorse, killing all those pigs
Slicing to your throat, hacking at your face
Ungodly thoughts arise, women I despise
Cadavers domain where I once stood
None remain apart from the blood
Visions of their deaths, bloody bodies lie
See the wounds on the flesh, it's you who's next to die
Watch you die in pain, I look with no shame
No hope for her to be saved, I laugh when others are grieving
So I came to you for death
Blood I spill, what's left, cold fleshI get excited at you all right!
I wanna go for a midnight drive, yeah!
Well keep running in the moonlight
I wanna take a crazy drive, yeah!
The condition of my car is perfect

We wanna bash out all night long!
Oh, Yeah!!!A haunting feeling comes throughout a darkened room
The air turns thick at this ritual of doom
Candles start to flicker as the image now appears
Alla Xul's presence, the master of all fears
Enlightened by its sight, I now feel hypnotized
Within a realm of darkness, I see two glowing eyes
Bowing down before it to feel its might stare
Manifested power given by the necro-prayer
It speaks the ancient tongues
Embraced by power
Spawn of the abyss
Invoked this night
Sumerian evil god
Grants all desiresMy life is a circle
No beginning and no end
It's always repeating a trail I defend
A misunderstanding
That can't be erased like a file
I've got all I wanted
But still I'm not satisfied
How far will I go to
And search my respect and my pride
How long will I lie to myself
About the privilege of my life
That turns around 'till I die
And take the dark with me
Why am I sad when I have more than I ever had?
My life is too stable I get no air
My jail is my skin I'm false like a fable
That is being praised for it's sin
Once I am trying to follow the light
Then the bitch grips my feet
Pulls me down underneath
How far will I go to
And search my respect and my pride
How long will I lie to myself
About the privilege of my life
That turns around 'till I die

Far away from foreign land
came the strange soulless man
drove all the righteous men
out of their homes
Hear the whole nation cry
help from the other side
against the eastern dark
The Battle of the End
I hear the sound of the thunder
coming from distant skies
dance of the dead
in the circles of fire
keeping the gods on our side
Blood of a man stains the green land
leaving the mark of death
falling from grace
into quicksand
it makes you hard to breathe
[Pre-chorus]
(Those) bright burning eyes
reflect a soul of a warrior
born from the fire of ancient gods
[Chorus]
Salvation by Fire will come
reflecting the deeds undone
face the destiny
Salvation, Salvation, Salvation will come...
Deliver us from the evil
deliver us from the go(o)d
deceiver reigns in silence
this is the end of my world
[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus 2]
Salvation by Fire will come
reflecting the deeds undone
face the destiny
Salvation by Fire will come
reflecting the deeds undone
repeating history
We lean on the ones,
the ones who let us down before
We die for a cause:
a cause long lost in the historyCan't take me apart...
Can't take me apart...
See the light a new day has arrived for us
Genesis of our evolution
A linchpin holds within a means to and end
Can't you see that we are one?
[Repeat: x3]
Can't take me apart
No you can't
We see no end to the dream
[Chorus]
We will never see the end
We will never be the ned
All of my life I felt discarded
Never feeling a part of it
No you can't
Without me you will fade, you will not remain
We are one and though the same future machine
A linchpin holds within a mean to an end
Can't you see that we are one?
[Repeat: x3]
Can't take me apart
No you can't
We see no end to the dream
[Chorus]
No you...
No you can't take... [Repeat: x5]
No you can't take me apart
[Chorus]
We will never see the end
We will never be the end
All my life I felt discarded
Never feeling a part of it
[Repeat: x5]
You can't change me
You can't change me nowHan katsoi maan reunalta tahtea putoavaa
Nyt kanuiit kasvot neitosen peittaa karu maa
Jokaisen taytyy katsoa silmiin totuuden
Silla aika ompi voittoisa, mut' tama maa on ikuinen
There's a place in the North, far far away
Home for the wandering man
Dreaming fells with skies so pale
Calm is the glorious land
Flames will send the sign to the sky
That we have come to feast tonight
The lakes are echoing with our song
Shadows are dancing on the forest walls
Enchantment of the fire and moon
Lost in the whispering night
The raven's magic enthralls the woods
Crawling in the sweet starlight
We have gathered in this distant land
Full of wisdom, secrets and tales
The morning will never rise again
Roaming wolves are howling for the dead
LAI LAI HEI!You're all so fucking hostile you're all so fucking mean
With your triple K complexion screaming keep our country clean
With your triple K superior picknick and your burning cross parade
You're all dressed up in white boys you're real American made
Hypocrite that's the name you wear
But I really don't care what you say
No bullshit you're so full of it
It comes out of your mouth everyday
I don't care what you say I don't care what you say
You want to be somebody special so you take it to the extreme
Waste a Jew a black or two and wipe their race out clean
You practice on a target but your guns still full of lead
You hunt them down ten on one and you aim to hit the head
Repulsive you really make me hate all the things you deny and you fake
Primitive you show no respect for all the lives you take and forsake
I don't care.....
Your mouths are so enormous and your dicks are just so small
You're just to dumb to realize you ain't got no brains at all
There ain't nothing in your deadheads that I could ever even understand
And you've still got the guts to tell us all that we should join the klan
I truly believe you're deaf dumb and blind
I believe you're unable to look
I truly believe you're really out of your mind take a look in the history book
I don't care.....A coarse exhalation of lungs that pray for pity
My two fingers punching the keys diligently
Trembling ground pushes my glass off the table
Spilling the blood of the son of your idol
If it were not for this
Extensive bug collection
I would know not what I've found
This world would still be flat
Mary would be a virgin
And I would still be sleeping sound
If every word is a dead symbol
Empowered by the carriers expression
I'll bury my instrument, citing this incident
I'm a flickering bulb that keeps blaming the filament
The most honest telling of this boyish fable
Is that on level ground, I'm never feeling stable
I've got to try to outlast this candle
Or trust department to fight the inferno
If it were not for this
Extensive book collection
I would know not what I've found
This world would still be flat
Mary would be a virgin
And I would still be sleeping sound
It's an endless quest to maintain
When no one is ever right
And out on the fertile plains
We bathe in fractured rays of
Sun, sunlight, sun, sunlight, light
If it were not for this
Extensive book collection
I would know not what I've found
This world would still be flat
Mary would be a virgin
And I would still be sleeping soundI'll be there for you baby

Losing time
counting hours
I'll never see myself again
And even though I'm alone
I can't remember what I'm missing
So I leave it be
Closing down
I expect the hopelessness
And even though I'm alone
I can't remember what I'm missing
and that's all I need
I am lost
I feel I am sinking now
like I was made of rain
Like a wave I roll into the endless night
I am not afraid
as the darkness starts
to make its way
I breathe as hard as you
as I end my day
I sigh and shelter
as I try to sink that deep
as deepas you and make sure
that I won't fall asleep
Losing days
I need no hours
I'll never be myself again
And even though it's killing me
I can't remember what I'm missing
So I leave it beMeet Coraline
Seems an average girl to the wise
Soft hair, innocent eyes
Perfect lips for perfect lies
She tells them she's fine
How nice it must be
To think that they're blind or that they just don't see
Well, her ignorance flies only so far
And they're just out of reach
So look in her eyes and tell me she's fine
Her dreams come alive
Her perverted attempt at reality, a grotesque demonstration of sanity
Ignored, oh, she cries
As she lies there, so sublime
She tells them she's fine
How nice it must be
To think that they're blind or that they just don't see
Well, her ignorance flies only so far
And they're just out of reach
So look in her eyes and tell me she's fine
You're so sweet, Coraline
Breath, won't you, breath, just you, breath
Oh, you're so sweet, Coraline
All your dreams come alive
Dream
Take a breath so you won't die
Watch her dreams come alive
Oh, sweet Coraline, take a breath so you won't die
She tells them she's fine
How nice it must be
To think that they're blind or that they just don't see
Well, her ignorance flies only so far
And they're just out of reach
So look in her eyes and tell me she's fine
So look in her eyes and tell me she's fine
So look in her eyes and tell me she's fine
Oh, Coraline
You're so sweet, CoralineThese embers turn to flames of yearning
I walked behind for too long
I can't stop the bleeding
These open wounds you left aren't healing
How the days just burn away
For you, I wished for something better
Cover my mouth and take my breath away
You killed the life inside of me
You walked away and left me to crawl
These changes in your heart deserving
Nothing more than to say you were right
Cover my mouth and take my breath away
You killed the life inside of me
You walked away and left me to crawl
Open your wrists, I'll let you bleed on me
Don't live another day
You walked away and left me to crawl
These open wounds aren't healing
Nothing is forever
And when I dream of the light in your eyes
I still reach for you into the night
Nothing is forever
Cover my mouth and take my breath away
You killed the life inside of me
You walked away and left me to crawl
Cover my mouth and take my breath away
You killed the life inside of me
You walked away and left me to crawlA life worn out by endless reflections
Has shattered every single last hope of rising again
Has defied your advise and counseling
The sinful nature causes a weak discipline
And drags me to the human frailties grave
Self inflicted wounds
Innumerable false steps
Unforgivable mistakes repeated to a frightening agree
Gradually growing conscious of the habit-forming addiction
Through me all actions fail
The human weaknesses
Are once again at force
In unrecognizable shapes
New structures each time
Fragile symptoms constantly show new characteristic sides
I myself am weak, am nothing
Uncontrolled line of thought color my manners
I know there is more to reach for
I know where strength is found
The overflowing, everlasting source
Within you my makerDie Pig Die
As I Clutch My Hands Around Your Throat
Die Pig Die
As I Watch Your Eyes Begin to Bloat
Die Pig Die
You Will Taste My Defecation Soon
Die Pig Die
Now I Stab Your Stomach, Face is Blue
Die Pig Die
Putrid Pile of Fucking Human Waste
Die Pig Die
Let My Anger Flow, Won't Hesitate
Die Pig Die
Bloody vengeance Guts Are Spilled, Blood Flows
Die Pig Die
With My Finger Jammed up Your Split Nose
Die Because I Tell You So
I'll Look You in the Eye As I Strike The Mortal Blow
You Gasp and Bleed and Wheeze and Piss
I'll Bless Your Throat with my Razor's Kiss
Die like a Pig Cause That's All you are to Me
You're Only Shit Underneath My Shoe
Die like a Pig Let me Hear you Squeal
You'll Suffer and Beg Before I'm ThroughWave goodbye, as we turn our backs on our past
Wave goodbye, cut our future short to pave a new path
Wave goodbye, we dropped it all on a dime to be on our own
Wave goodbye, as we make the escape into the unknown
We pushed through shattering expectations
Filled with dreams, filled with heartache
We pushed through shattering expectations
Filled with dreams, filled with heartache
We're still standing strong, standing strong
As we keep living on, living onWhat is left of our world, today
Walls have fallen with peace
But walls are built within our hearts
Wars are fought within
A cloak lies over our world
A misery show without an end
The masses follow the masses
The blind will lead the way
To see the colors that rest within your mind
The paradise we seek lies inside
Who's to blame, who will lose
Now the dice have been rolled
We must find the guilty ones
Instead of condemning what has been done
Who shall we praise now
When all our gods are gone
Living is not just to live
In a concrete or cardboard box
Think in a carbonized world
Where all has been done before
The thought of a perfect world
On a pile of broken dreams
To see the colors that rest within your mind
The paradise we seek lies inside
Who's to blame, who will lose
Now the dice have been rolled
We must find the guilty ones
Instead of condemning what has been done
>From the smoking cities we shall rise
And on the ashes we will build
Praying for that one day
The sun will rise again...when you feel grief and lone all others appear so happy
the weather then is beautiful, all could be so well
and if your world falls apart all around seems laughter
all those fragments fragile, now and hereafterThe years are passing by
And Earth is growing old
The minutes fly away
Like arrows in the air
So many faces I saw in this world
So many things are gone and really I don't care
[Bridge:]
But only death plays another game
A game without habitual rules
No turning back, it's the only way
The way that's so cruel
[Chorus:]
But stars are the same
And moonlights illuminates
The mountains with peaks
In the snow
And oceans of sand
Cry under the hottest sun
IT'S happening by
This world law
The world wars of our time
Are a flash of universe
The floods and whirlwinds
As a few drops in the sea
Somebody's hand is turning
The pages of old book
Somebody's fingers make our life and destinyThey came riding down the slopes
Five fearless men prepared to fight
We heard with fear the rumbling earth
In the mid-day light
Surprised we saw all terrified
The brave northmen's run
The fearless five with power ride
Attacking us in the mid-day sun
Their charge was fast, no alarm was sound
They broke right through our lines
I felt the cut it threw me to the ground
And now I feel has come my time
I lie here in my blood
And see my family get killed
I feel abandoned by my god
I fear death's chill
I see Hell's gates
Towering high
And dark are they
I don't want to die
Oh no! I was wrong
Denied the true Gods
And now I'm doomed
I trusted foreign men
And their god's son
But now when I need them
They are gone
I see Hell's gates
Towering high
And dark are they
I die!
They ride across the planes
And punish those of false belief
All resistance is in vain
As they caress them with cold steel
They are the punishers
And they will never bend
They are power the five of them
From Asgard they are sent
The power they have in all they do
The Christians non will feel
No one can escape them no
Them will make them kneel
Their fight is through, they must return
No one here survived
And as the blood red sky begins to burn
To Valhall they will rideA distant calling,
A faint echo form the past
The bells are still tolling,
The message of sadness and death
In the city of Acheron
The priests burned the Book
Worshiped false Gods
Scoffed at the good
Desecrated the altar
Spat on the cross
Teared down the temples
And laughed at their loss
Oh faith oh faith
Stone on stone,
The ringing goes on and on
Attracting a memory,
Forgotten and nowhere to be found
Forged by the mighty
Admired by the great
Once blessed by the holy
Protected by fate
Announcing the twilight
The wrath of the Gods
The city of Acheron
Was drowned by the floodI touch the string though the harp may not sing
Still I dare the sky for sun sparks to guide
Down below there's a land
With an ominous hole
Deep in the sand of belief
A million doves
orbit round the Earth with tears of blood
Kill the virgin, takeI am of crimson blood
nought shall hold me
mirror mine the dark of night
reflects me in water
Ablaze are my eyes
my soul consumed by woe
my braids weaved by the wind
an image in my mind
Leave I must now with haste
me who tires of quiet life
me who's path leads to war
me who fears no death
I yearn for more
I yearn to rise
I yearn for everything
I yearn for you
I yearn to riseTe busco entre los aires de norte y sur
entre la bruma de un octubre frÃ­o y gris.
Me desespero espero con ansiedad
entre las flores de un abril que volverÃ¡.
No entiendo la locura que desarmo tanta tormenta
ni entiendo cuanto amor podrÃ¡ resistir ya
mi alma enferma
si consiguiera al menos que tu mirada
a mi me diera
Con una parte de ti.
Con una parte de ti
como la lagrima al suspiro alimenta
ser el pecado que pago tu penitencia
ser la impaciencia que desborda tu conciencia.
Ser tu razÃ³n de vivir
ser la sonrisa que en tu boca vive alerta
bailar al son de un tambor con marionetas
ser la ternura que acaricia tu cabeza.
Con una parte de ti.
La luna plateada en tu pelo esta
cuando la brisa une a mi pelo como al mar
Te arranco la hoja sana como flor de azahar
que me adormece imaginando donde estas
Por tu mirada quema toda mi piel si tu me miras.
Y es que yo ya no creo en ese amor
que da la vida.
Si no me ves para ti.
Con una parte de ti
como la lagrima al suspiro alimenta
ser el pecado que pago tu penitencia
ser la impaciencia que desborda tu conciencia.
Ser tu razÃ³n de vivir
ser la sonrisa que en tu boca vive alerta
bailar al son de un tambor con marionetas
ser la ternura que acaricia tu cabeza.
Con una parte de ti
como la lagrima al suspiro alimenta
ser el pecado que pago tu penitencia
ser la impaciencia que desborda tu conciencia.
Ser tu razÃ³n de vivir
ser la sonrisa que en tu boca vive alerta
bailar al son de un tambor con marionetas
ser la ternura que acaricia tu cabeza.
Con una parte de ti.
Ser una parte de ti.
Ser una parte de ti.Look and mesmerize what shall be
And what has been
Over the night and far to the sea
Those stars that heard they scream
On that morning he wanted to feel
That day was written in prophecies
By that day the sun...
Gave birth to its beloved child
The moon that's now gone...
The whispers of the elder ones
Look and mesmerize what shall be
And what has been
Longing to shadows, longing for seas
To stars I want to scream
Look and mesmerize what shall be
And what is yet to see
Over the night and far to the sea
Those stars that heard they scream
That evening the skies started to weep
That reveries' night of eternal sleepwhen we wake in the morning we will see the glorious
sun. standing in the rays of life, our day has just
begun, the essence of time is ours, precious as every
minute goes by. i was a fool to have wasted, the
stupidity i called fun. who is to love when the hearts
have grown cold. a life can no longer exist. wheres
the love? if only heaven would shine on is a heart
would be warm. in the night im clinging to my covers
in bed. i awake once again with another nightmare.
close the door around you. lock yourself from the
outside world. an empty heart cant feel love, just
loneliness. i wish i would die, theres no peace within
me. hurt and anger in my soul. emotionless as feelings
are destroyed. only hoping my end will come. how long
can i go on? experiencing depression. how long can i
go on? there is no other way, to bring peace in my
heart, it must all end someday. memories of an
haunting dream, so close to losing my reality. tears
are running down my face. i look towards the sky,
screaming at God in heaven. oh please hear my cries of
torment. i close my eyes, feelings distraught, my
heart denies. for the one i loved now walks among
angels. we shall meet again when the death closes my
eyes. reunited together as one, happiness of mother
and son.Uniformed psychotics, the perfect military cover
Acts of malicious murder, supposed laboratory tests
War pawn wheeled on a trolley of steel, primitive future seen through crucified eyes
Screams of agony, peeling torture as the six-year-old faces his autopsy
End it now!
Released days later to her relief.
Frost-bitten hands meet a hot water trough
Hastier than mental comprehension, her loose ice-rotten hands are violently torn off
[Chorus]
Human guinea pigs are subjected to rooms of mutated bacterial plagues
Diseased and disfigured beyond recognition, dumped into filthy putrefied graves
Beaten mutilated pulps of crimson meat lay in decaying puddles on the floor
All for logical scientific progression or unthinkable atrocities of a senseless war?
The dawning of a new day, another plague is born.
An airborne septic death machine to leave enemies ravaged and torn
Internal organs dissolve to mush, blood coughed up in thickened clots
Tumors spreading through the body, your system slowly shuts down...then rots
[repeat chorus]Let me get this one flat out straight
Illuminate please it's not too late
Since when did you become god?
You might be right. I've been tattered
'N torn. self destructing since I was born
So what's got to do with you?
Close yet far - I've gone now
Safe and sound - I don't know how
Knuckled under - never giving up
And it all goes to show exactly what?
So much fun when you can tell me I'm dun
Such a sweet unchaining sound
Whisper me softly that I'm gonna die young
Before you do take a look into the ground
It's not my funeral
If you rip my life apart in no time
I'll put it back together in 2.5
How's that for punctuality?
Since you wanna fuck me over
And I know you do
Better be aware I'm gonna fuck you too
But you should by now be schooled in that very piece of my minds's obscurityHe comes through the night
And is going to be ready to fight
His sword will kill every time it is going for his will
The death has taken you can see his anger in his face
The hate and the fate mixed up because it is far too late
Go assassin, fight assassin
Kill assassin, the life assassin
The blood which flows brainless killing for that life will go
Metal in your vein is giving them the deadly pain
The bloody useless war will make sense
And thinking really shot
The kill is his will and that's what always has been his drill
Go fight kill assassin
Go fight kill assassin
Go fight kill assassin
Go fight kill assassinWelcome to darkness the future is here
Destruction and pain are my friends
Explosions and fires that rip through the night
Surrounded by bodies of death
Burning, crying, helpless
Burning, dying, in the dark
Burning, crying, helpless
Fire in the sky
Watching and praying and waiting to die
Fire in the sky
No hope for tomorrow, denied
Smoldering ashes and flames rise again
Nothing to breathe from this life
Flesh is beginning to pour in the streets
Death is my saviour tonightNot thirsty am I for the blood
Of redeemer of thy greed
My hunger can't be satisfied
With flesh of thy nazarene
No gilded streets of heaven's grace
Entice me in thy speech
No holy mother doth condone
All your pillage war and greed
But know thee that all oceans worth
Of waters turned holy
Won't change the course of river
That runs inside of me
My blood flows ever skyward
And pools where thy black is white
For woulst thou not carme at my soul
With sword of thy supreme truth
Strike me down on my bended knees
For thy baptism so soothe
My blood flows ever skywawrd
And pools where thy black is white
Alone am I to raise my head
In the starless forest night[cover]

Profane century
Medieval victory
An honor that has been gone
I feel the scorn rush through me
The countless fallen heroes
Whom befouled their dignity
Profane century
Medieval century
Amongst the ruins of hoary castles
Powerful wreaths of incense rise
The wretched knights cull the emblems
To ride along their graceful mounts
Throughout the chamber the aura of hate
Habitually dispersed upon hammering steel
Their cascading blood ensured the kinship
Enthralled amid the somber warcryThe tower of sense inside you
Ruined by the hands of lies
Your daylight is already dusk
Feel the dead inside alive
Feeding an invincible master
With all you wanted or did
The only one you respected
Can't remove a coffins lid
Show me a fleshful truth
Behind the blind dead eyes of your father
You can't cos the only truth
Is denying that fuckin' dictator
Skinfather
Larger than lies
Faithfucked believer
Use your own eyes
You are the one putting flesh on his bones
Fuckin' thief of human lives
Skinfather
Larger than lies

A sick old man, and who would guess
He was once S.S.
A deadly fascination, of a madman's solution
Six million dead, poison tales pollutes his head
Tell me a story, will ya, will ya
A real good story, I won't leave till ya
Spill your guts old man

Any skeletons, in the closet
Any skeletons, any misfortunes
Any skeletons, hiding in the closet

Apt pupil, he hears the screams
Nightmares turn into wet dreams
Hatred lives, boiling inside,
Dealing death it's bumicidein too deep,

Fun pickin-part
The truth comes out, conspiracy there is no doubt
His life is ruined, but no not yet
He's still got one card in the deck
A loaded gun, a happy smile,
He'll scope the freeway for awhile
King of the world, four hundred rounds,
It took five hours to bring him down
Tell me a story, will ya, will ya
A real good story, I won't leave til ya
Spill your guts old man leave out any secrets,
Hiding in theAs flowers on the grave of earth inferno
We are all good people
Dressed not in white we are
Ascendants of heaven
In a symbolic imaginative essence
Descending angels we are
Falling as rain to impure the ground
And to flourish as flowers
Before we wither
With a scent of heavenly dew
As time that gnaws on the bones of life
We are the floating liquid flesh
The crawling sinners we are
Melting the heavens
As death silences all sweet voices
Renders of the clouds we are
Swarming as sinners to the universal presence of the fall
And to taste the fruits of lunacy
Before we fall
Into a devilish exercise[M: Cryonic Temple L: Axelsson]
As the sun is going down, on a dark and cloudy sky,
you can se there's something coming your way
A wagon lead by horses, so black just like the night
without a coachman and it's running on its own
He's back to take his throne again
So beware all my friends, lock up your doors tonight
from this moment you shall never be alone
Raise up all your hands, and hail the king tonight
the King of Transylvania is coming home
The legend talks about him, the returning of the Lord
a name that no one ever dares to say
Rumours told he's dead, killed in ancient times
but that's a fatal lie and you will know
He's watching all of us from his throne
[Repeat chorus]
[Leads - Both / Collin / Both / Ahonen]
[Repeat chorus]God of make-believe
In your world
Nothing's what it seems
Master Of pre-judgement
What do you really know
About the things we do
We know who you are
This time you've gone too far
The scar runs too deep
Thanks for the inspiration
To rise above you all
Second coming
Back with a vengeance
Judgement day
Cleansweep
Dreams spoiled by your greed
When honey turns to mud
You can't succeed
You're laughing now
But not for long
Operation cleansweep
Has just begun
We know who you are
This time you've gone too far
The scar runs too deep
Thanks for the inspiration
To rise above you all
Second coming
Back with a vengeance

Try me, try me...!I expect to find the real you among all those lies,
Two-face beauty,
Why'd you turn and walk away,
With everything I fucking did,
I fucking had my say,
But you, you hardly know my name,
And I, I don't care,
I expect to find the real you among all those lies,
After all those fucking years,
You're dead to me,
You became some one else,
You fucking sold me out,
You fucking sold me out,
My heart is empty,
Just like your words before,
My love is dead,
Just like your words before,
I am not the first one and i'm sure i'm not the last,
Fuck YouIs it feasable for humankind to fly
Wondered and searched for all my finite life
As the volent creatures I desire
From the vault of heaven I'll salute the sky
Fly high to the endless sky with your heart
Fly, all your wishes come to life and
Fly, when you're ready to pay your price
As the wind sweeps your wings
The endeavor of mine was seen from the high
The souvereign and the other authorized
Threatened first, but then I was stood by
Persisted to make real this journey of mine
Fly high to the endless sky with your heart
Fly, all your wishes come to life and
Fly, when you're ready to pay your price
As the wind sweeps your wings
As my feet touched the ground,
I'm awakened from my most beautiful dream
Staring by a thousand malicous eyes
That thinking that I was a dangerous being
Torn apart from my beloved ones, my lands
Where my wishes were burgeoned
Exiled... Waited for my finite life to come to an end...
"That man is a man to be feared of; whatever he wishes for, would come true. That kind of men shouldn't be allowed to survive"
Souvereign IV. MuradIndependence, terrorism
A hail of pebbles and stones
Poverty and racism
The wheel of conflict rolls on
Dictatorship, fanaticism
The battle lines drawn in mind and soil
A drop of fucking human blood
For every gallon of oil
Hightech death and Disneyland
Censorship and Jesus Christ
Dual moraled Uncle Sam
World police and fucking apple pie
The crescent and the endless
Ever changing dunes
The sun and precious black gold
A different culture language
Creed and tune
A different God I have been told
Pushed into corners hunted down
Observed, surveyed and chained
Religious fundamentalism
Prosper as preassure is sustained
Hightech death and Disneyland
Censorship and Jesus Christ
Dual moraled Uncle Sam
World police and fucking apple pie
Resolution GreedSo please come in my friend, I welcome you
To the world within my dreams
Amidst this place I lie and pray for all
That your eyes could never see
And in this place I hide
As my world for fire turns
And keep the flame alive
Which for all my visions burns
Chorus
At day - The way's seen beyond a velvet sky
At night, so bright - far and wide a star goes by
I close the door my friend so you can see
What this world is all about
I see the stars from deep within my sleep
And no way to help me out
And still they shine for me
And slowly turn to ice
Still keep the flame in me
The light behind my eyes
Chorus
So here your visit ends
I held them in my hands - believe me
For the blink of an eye

I helped you out, I picked you up,
And you never had the chance to say,
You make me look do fucking bad,
Time and time again,
I guess I can't count on you for anything,
Every time I look around I see that nothing's changed,
You're still the same piece of shit you were,
I see that nothing's changed,
How can you expect me to listen to a word you fucking say?
When I can't count on you for anything,
You make me look so fucking bad,
Time and time again,
I guess I can't count on you anything,
Every time I look around I see that nothing's changed,
You're still the same piece of shit you were,
I see that nothing's changed,
I'm still waiting for youA mother mourns the loss of her son. The most wonderful man in
the world; light and shining, fair and beautiful as no other man.
Light blond hair, wonderful skyblue eyes and a skin so fair it
shines! Tall and handsome, strong and brave, perfect in all his
being. Now he is dead! Silent. Alone. Watching the lands and
others from a window up high in the clouds. Cold of sorrow,
exhausted by grief; the very little remaining life is fading
away. Too tired to move, too mournful to think of anything else
then her dead son. The others are preparing the defense of the
town, and her husband has left to find the avenger for the
killing. Nobody thinks of her, nobody has any time for her. She
is left alone, to mourn the death of her son.Jesus kom til jorden for d

Without thoughts of changing
To have my life taken away
Inheriting the skills of
The dead to hunt and live
The dead to hunt and die
Because that is our only way
Never understanding
Tomorrow never comes
Waiting and believing
That they have got it wrong
Why are we made to suffer
For their ignorance, underestimatedHumanity rising, life depriving
Mankind decline
Black humor falls in place
Evolve in catalog, prey of progress
Self evolution contribution
Retribution at hand
Pitch your fall for the big show
Grand illusion of fruition
Through suspicions of our end
Next in line, step to me and bass the buck
It's only human actions
Force me to lash out and crush
Every day I see the cattle march by
Clueless victims of society's numbing effects
Told to listen, forced to turn offYou say everything comes if you don't turn your back
And I wait everyday sometimes it's patience I lack
Because it's just more of the same, more of the same
And I just need you to remember my name
More of the same, more of the same, and I just need you
It takes all of me to keep my eyes off of the floor
And this makes tommorow seem harder than ever before
Because it's just more of the same, more of the same
And I just need you to remember my name
More of the same, more of the same, and I just need you to remember my...
Why does this seem to be right in front of me
Intangible dreams we pursue
Why it's so hard to see is eluding me
I can't believe that it's true
More of the same, more of the same
And I just need you to remember my name
More of the same, more of the same, and I just need you.On the night all mirrors fell silent
And the clocks struck accord with the rain
A storm swept in with such violence
The dead rose to complain
The stars were ill-crossed as the weather
Lost in its bitumen cloak
The Angels were warring, slick with endeavour
Falling like tears through the thickening smoke
Blood redeems, heaven torn asunder
A flood of souls scream on the rolling thunder
Blood redeems, heaven torn asunder
She stirs from dreams barely three feet under
"Victoria, I come to claim my prize
Stealing from the convent 'neath the wrath of seething skies
For though you greased the palm of Satan
With those moonlit silver thighs
I knew the beast took second place
When I looked into your eyes
Your deceiving eyes
Filled with lies
And missed good byes
And serpents hissing revelations
Your deceiving eyes
They tell enough
Of how I fell in love
With the goddess creeping deep inside you"
And with the tumult up above him roaring
Isaac sought her shallow grave
As lightning bolted through the grim down-pouring rain
He struck the hallowed earth again
Having torn at the soil like a man insane
ÐÐµ threw his fists at the poisonous cosmos
And from that pit of shame
He bore the coffin from her sorry lot
Neath trees whose eaves were knotted with rot
Through ornate chapel doors, unlocked
To splinter her sarcophagus
And gaze upon her face
Victoria
"Victoria, I come to claim my prize
Stealing from the convent 'neath the wrath of seething skies
For though you greased the palm of Satan
With those moonlit silver thighs
Making mockery of rosaries
His needs will never rival mine
I recall a summer's day
The sunlight bathed your penitential scars
As I sat and washed the blood away
Now your body stays
And the coldness of your lips
Eclipse
Like the first true kiss of winter"
Pining for the dead
On the stone floor spread
She was shining through her winding shroud
A moon amid the mad, this son of Adam had
A gift for the pretty young nun
A necklace wrought of twining snakes
Two gold illicit tongues
He laid it at her throat
Where the rope had wrung
He was burning from the furnace
Of his roused desire
He wrested with temptation
To be or unfulfilled
She was undressed for ovation
Her sumptuous form, the storm revealed
And with his driven lust exploding
Her lashes brushed his cheeks
They flickered with life, her limbs enfolding
Purring, licking wicked teeth
"Victoria, I come to claim my prize
Stealing from the convent neath the wrath of seething skies
For though you greased the palm of Satan
With those moonlit silver thighs
You have left him just for me
I see it in deceiving eyes
Those deceiving eyes
Filled with lies
And missed good byes
And serpents hissing revelations
Those deceiving eyes
They tell enough
Of how I fell in love
With the goddess re-arisen in you"Cold winter cuts - a heart that couldn't heal
destroyed by it's own stupidity
a frozen smile - cracks backing frigid lies
I shelter beneath a veil of happiness - a delicate facade
and snow falls as to bury what we had
everything we left behind
although your loving eyes - have left my gaze forever
they've been captured in my sleep - although this vacant heart
can't go on any longer - I feel your soft breath in my dreams
but it shall not be - I cannot shake these feelings
I can't renounce - this love for you is all I know
I am controlled by sorrow - my hope forever lost
bested by my weakness - will the spring's warmth never come?
And the snow
still heaping on this broken back
I am lost within its persistence
you took the meaning
from this withered soul
I have no strength without your touch
and so it was - and can never be again
and so it was - and will never ever be again.
Lost - this love for you is all I know.
Weakness - will the spring's warmth never come?
A little child crying - from the bunk below
I still love you - I can't cut that tie from my life
love born in regret? Was our blight carved into stone?
The stone that lines my heart - I wish I never loved you
cold sweat and eaten nails - I did this all for you.
A broken heart - a clenched fist full of hair - I did this all for you
and any other embrace - will just turn into shit
in the shadow of our former love
I'd trade a bloody wrist - to live forever in those nights
but the deed hath still been doneNow is your time to die
We've gathered here to say goodbye
No more you'll cry
No reason left for you to fight
Feel pain no more
Emotions never felt before
Where do we go, we go she'll never know
Holding on to you
To keep from falling
Your eyes are closing now
Another chapter's ending
Hard times we always saw
There's nothing left of you no more
Fear has no place, no place
Cover her face
Holding on to you
To keep from falling
Your eyes are closing now
Another chapter's ending
This is our last goodbye (goodbye)
This is our time tonight
Holding on to you
To keep from falling
Your eyes are closing now
Another chapter's ending
This is our time tonight[instrumental]They're gonna grill the truth out of you
Compression for everyone
It's not a miracle how you break
Seeing the signs of declining
No one is going to help you out
It's like the breeding horses
You told me how you've been, been waiting
Always praising final hours
Like the time was never right
Able to sense the rising light
Yet still feels I'm sinking
Never beared no resemblance
Against any living soul
You told me how you've been, been waiting
Surrounding cold makes me smile
I saw the animal in you, raise skies
Surrounding cold makes me smile
I saw the animal in you raise skies
The time is now
The light is with me, the rest of me is gone
Need no help to save myself
This is my hell, go find your own one
This is my hell, go find your own one
You will fail, you will see
You will see the differenceOh, another face joins the crowd
It's time to impress, time to prove yourself
You don't realize
That in a year's time you'll be over this
Moved on to the next trend
Your next catchy melody
Moved on to the next trend
Here's your next catchy melody
So, say what you will
And do what you feel you must
Your words just fuel my rage
And fill my heart with disgust
I know what really matters
And I know who will be there
The rest of you could wither away
And not a piece of me would care
Tomorrow, none of you will mean a goddamn thing
Tomorrow, none of you will mean a goddamn thing
Tomorrow, none of you will mean a goddamn thing
Tomorrow, none of you will mean a goddamn thing
Damn thing, you're spread so thin
We see right through your display
A procession of smoke and mirrors
Tomorrow none of you will mean a goddamn thing to me
In time everything grows stale and old
I'll hold on to what I have and never let go
Tomorrow, none of you will mean a goddamn thing
Tomorrow, none of you will mean a goddamn thing(Exodus)
Intro- Tom Skid
Voices inside my head are making me go mad
Now I'm afraid to sleep from nightmares that I've had
I feel I'm on the edge, I need some kind of cure
Now I've gone and killed someone, I'm mentally disturbed!
They can't keep me locked away
My psychiatrist says I'm okay
They think that they've got me trained
But I know I'm really deranged!
Arrested for murder, my case comes to trial
Prosecution's accusing me of things sick and vile
I admit I'm guilty, but plead insanity
Six months at Bellevue, then I'm walking free
They can't keep me locked away
But the Doctor says I'm okay
They think that they've got me trained
But I know I'm really deranged!

They want to calm me so they feed me Thorazine
It doesn't make me calmer, it only makes me mean
Now they let me loose, back in society
With some psychiatric help and a lobotomy
But I've got them fooled, I'm playing at their game
I'm more psycho than before, I don't even know my name
I know they should have killed me when they had the chance
But the system let me off with a little song and dance!Let the steel be my Christ
Let the blood create the path
Ignored like the dead pigeon gutted by the cat
Impregnated our babies with psychosis and lamb vomit
The clay failed to form the cast
All that is left is a moist clump of animation
Pure flat affect and no chance for grin
Retarded by the morning's sunlight and traded sorrow for silence
Sedation in the underlife
Filed in the abyss
Sedation in the underlife
Through steel I shall exist
The wheelchair pigeon is as clever as the crow
Sedation in the underlife
Through steel I shall existFeel the time
It grows in you, it feeds off you
Burns down dreams
Kills the life that you have left to live
Fear the one
Who offers you inner peace
Hell within you
You come down with blood on your face
Hear, he's closer
Prepare to accept your end
Shadows surround you
Shed a tear for the ones you hold dear
Oh, by my side you walk and smile when people die
Your touch is cold as ice, you kiss the old and bite the young
You're Death!
But to bring salvation when your inner thoughts aren't pure
Can make you feel the he's there releasing all your strings
And you try to seek redemption from the pitiful above
Can you be blind to your fate or has your mind now failed?
The reaper smiles once more cause I'll soon be there
Death by my side!
Hell within you
Uncontrolled cause of split desire
Crush a vein
Feel death flow under your skin
But to bring salvation where your life is not lived through
Can make you feel that he's there releasing all your fears
And you try to seek redemption from the pitiful above
Can you be blind to your fate or has your mind now failed?
The reaper smiles once more cause I'll soon be there
Death by my side!
On, by my bed you wake and wait to take my hand
Your grip brings emptiness, you free the weak and crush the strong
You're Death!
But to bring salvation when your inner thoughts aren't pure
Can make you feel the he's there releasing all your strings
And you try to seek redemption from the pitiful above
Can you be blind to your fate or has your mind now failed?
The reaper smiles once more cause I'll soon be there
Death by my side!
But to bring salvation where your life is not lived through
Can make you feel that he's there releasing all your fears
And you try to seek redemption from the pitiful above
Can you be blind to your fate or has your mind now failed?
The reaper smiles once more cause I'll soon be there
Death by my side!tensions rising
ancient bloodfeud renewed
overcome by anger
the days of the earth are numbered
rebel
admirion black
the glory days are over
admirion black
the final day has come
all preparations have been done
release the final flow
stand by and see the flood flow
armageddon year 2000
humanity goes to war
in eternal defiance
gods reign exists no moreThe chase has ended
At the very beginning
cannot run away from the plain pain
cannot fly away with an airplane
cannot get away from the migraine
cannot go away and drink champaign
...And you will be tired at the end
At last i'll meet you, friend
You didn't move the slightest bit.
Stay away from painful fights
The Chase
Look into your heart and then admit it:
That is the end. You could never win it
Don't run, cause I am always behind you
And you will be tired at the end
But your smell will always betray you
At last i'll meet you, friend
cannot run away from the plain pain
cannot fly away with an airplane
cannot get away from the migraine
cannot go away and drink champaign
The Chase
Look into your heart and then admit it:
That is the end. You could never win itTrapped up inside here, like lions in a cage
I've been a mark of injustice
Bound by these chains
Can't find a reason, I'm on my own
My destiny waits for a sign from me
I'm leaving alone
I'm out on my way now
It's been so many years
The chase is my lifeblood
I have no more fears
Fire, burns in my veins
Anger, shows on my face
Hatred, it poisons my soul
Look out, I'm about to explode
Evil ones try to destroy us
We're armed and prepared for attack
We'll take on the world with the rebellion
We're dangerous down to the last
Armed and dangerous
Am I evil, or am I insane
The lion inside of me, is no longer tame
A blade in my left, a gun in my right
to beat you within, an inch of your lifeWho's this? With the vocal pitch, I blitz
We be the top choice, moist, voice my script
Significant, different styles on instinct
Make sense, when rockin' rhymes over instruments
Known for the graf, although the crowd comes first
Activist, specialist, of the ultimate verse
All subjects correct, image is the key
If you want your peers respect show versatility
Type strange, how the whole sound is rearranged
Changed, so many players entered in the game
But not these two, we past dues, smash crews
You ask what's the task slash we bringin' the news
Dialogue, strong, not your average cabbage
Savage on the mic while other crews can't manage
Cause in these times the rhymes pay all things
Rent, bills plus your diamond pinky ring
[Chorus]
Comin from the Bricks, all mics we rip
(Who's this? Kickin in your Benzi box crisp)
With the fat penmanship for the championship
(Who's this? Kickin in your Benzi box crisp)
Fat tracks, lyrics, New Jerus click
(who's this? Kickin in your Benzi box crisp)
We comin from the back with the ultimate blitz
(Who's this? Kickin in your Benzi box crisp)
Holy Moses, I'ma come down like drug doses
With a voltage, cause I'm ready to shock whoever's closest
Bold enough to dismiss tricks, up in the mix
With my rhyme skit, bad with the ad-libs behind it
Time it, the rapper's precionist, ain't no dissin' us
It's just, another rap attack for your to discuss
It's us, fresh in the flesh, up in your session
Wildin' out like sex without protection
Right before your eyes I'ma rise up and size up
The status of the rappers while I sit in the back, smokin' my cabbage
Managin', not to get involved with the petty
We ever ready, cuttin' comp like a machete
Not the one to glorify guns, I'd rather drop it on the one
And make the funds for my late night weed runs
Dumb dums, want to do bids and start they static
They better ease back like Craftmatic
[Chorus]
Superficial rhymes on top for y'all to see
How we react on wax, DJ included exactly
Autographs in black books, dodgin' from the crooks
Recognize the stats, don't act for ill looks
But I keep a straight path like the subway stay
Underneath from deep in the depths of NJ
I be the one to get the job done, Tame One
Got funk like the Bop Gun, burnin' with the powers of a hot sun
Makin' my mark after dark like I'm a criminal
Break hard rocks to minerals like, ten star generals
Is it the way we slay the stages, that make these neighbors hate us
We fillin' up the pages with the game like Las Vegas
New Jersey native, ten minutes from the Money Makin
Stay rooted with the Buddha like Jamaicans
[Chorus: x2]Here we all feel alive*
Here we use our minds
Let us form together
Use our minds
Recreate, redesign
Visualize it
With a new world in our hands, we will gain control
With a new world in our hands, we will gain control
Re-a-LIZE that you will never feel this way again (again)
And what you want is right in front of your eyes (this is the life)
So take it in, and embrace
No more wasted faith, 'cause we are wrong
No more wasted faith, 'cause we are wrong ('cause we are wrong)
Don't let it be easy
You needed such a direction to visualize perfection
Visualize perfection
We are wrong, We are free
This is serenity
Stop holding on for nothing
I'm ready to face this world and gain control
With a new world in our hands
With a new world in our hands
With a new world in our hands
With a new world in our hands
Gain control
No more wasted faith, 'cause we are wrong
We are at ease with the way we've grown
And only when the timing's right
We can start to feel the stars align
Don't let it be easy
Visualize perfection
Stop holding on for nothing
Visualize perfectionHasten to the bridal bed -
Underneath the grave 'tis spread:
In darkness may our love be hid,
Oblivion be our coverlid -
We may rest, and none forbid.
Percy Bysshe ShelleyEverything that I say won't mean anything less
When I'm down in a grave
And you've put me to rest
Everything that I say won't mean anything less
When I'm down in a grave
And you've put me to rest
Will the story end
Will it ever change
I never knew a person could be so deranged
Does it make you feel good
Do you feel strong ruining the lives of everyone you love
As if life isn't hard already
Add it to the list of things to forget
With one chance to define ourselves
We're gonna keep on living
Keep on living
This is for the kids with the beaten in lips
Whose parents try to shut them up using their fists
Keep living loud and proud
They never can hold you down
This is for the kids with a soul like mine
When people tell you living is a waste of your time
Keep living loud and proud
They never can hold you down
Pull the plug with a single decision
Your way of life is a contradiction
Go to rehab celebrate with ketamine
Mend the wounds and light it with kerosene
Light my wounds with kerosene
Light my wounds with kerosene
Light my wounds with kerosene
Light my wounds with kerosene
As if life isn't hard already
Add it to the list of things to forget
With one chance to define ourselves
We're gonna keep on living
Keep on living
This is for the kids with the beaten in lips
Whose parents try to shut them up using their fists
Keep living loud and proud
They never can hold you down
This is for the kids with a soul like mine
When people tell you living is a waste of your time
Keep living loud and proud
They never can hold you down
Listen to the sound of your children revolting
Listen to the sound of the lives you're ruining
This is for the kids with the beaten in lips
Whose parents try to shut them up using their fists
Keep living loud and proud
They never can hold you down
This is for the kids with the beaten in lips
Whose parents try to shut them up using their fists
Keep living loud and proud
They never can hold you down
This is for the kids with a soul like mine
When people tell you living is a waste of your time
Keep living loud and proud
They never can hold you down
Everything that I say won't mean anything less
When I'm down in a grave
And you've put me to rest
Everything that I say won't mean anything less
When I'm down in a grave
And you've put me to restIs there a sun there in your hand?
A little light that battles with itself
Is there a message in the sand,
that tells me how to set the world in flames?
Do people cry or is it rain?
Do we care... do we count the stains?
When will the sunrise stay a day?
Laugh and shine, or is it all the same?
PSALMS FOR THE DEAD
SONG FOR THE LIVING
AND A WREATH FOR ABSENT FRIENDS
So tell me... fools and trubadours, can a simple stream grow into a flood?
A beggar man, become a president?
And a sip of wine be shared... and thick as blood?
Idols, gods... Dictators and divine,
is this the path where blind men lead the blind?
What is love, but only a dream...?
Those pains and pures were meatn to set us free!
When time is gone, the page is turned
The door is closed and all is done and said
The band has played... the spotlight's burned
ALL THAT'S LEFT ARE
PSALMS FOR THE DEADFar away in a distant land
Ten men, weapons close at hand
These men are at war for peace
Outnumbered they are up against all odds
But their spirit is undetered
On the distant cries in the wind
We hear our friends die in agony
We have learnt that we always must stay strong
Relying on each other till the day we die
Are we the only ones left?
So this is how the story goes
We live to fight another day
and we will stay together as one
Find another way
We either win or we will die by
Each others sides
For pride we fight
For pride we die
We've been here for far too long
we haven't eaten in weeks
It's hard to go on
But with each day that slowly passes by
I don't feel like giving in
I'd rather die
Cos this is the way we are born to be
So this is how the story goes
We live to fight another day
and we will stay together as one
Find another way
We either win or we will die by
Each others sides
A Warrior's heart, never dies
Never dies
We gather here, beneath the sky
The days go by and we lose track of time
Watching the seasons pass us by
Sun, wind, snow we've seen it all
But this is how we're born to be
To serve the king is our sworn duty
We fight these wars but why we do not know
A spirit of pride is all we own
So this is how the story goes
We live to fight another day
and we will stay together as one
find another way
We either win or we will die by
Each others sides
A Warrior's heart, never dies
So this is how the story goes
We live to fight another day
and we will stay together as one
find another way, this is the warrior's way
We either win or we will die by
Each others sides
We fight for pride
We fight for pride
For pride we fight
For pride we die
A thousand years could pass us by
but it'll never change our warrior's pride
Our souls live on in another life
We'll stand together at each others sides
We will fight together and together we die
Cos this is our way
This is who we are
The Warrior's way will live on forever
in the hearts and souls of all who stand together
The spirit lives on, in our song
To the endThoughts of war, complete destruction plaguing
My brain
Desperation of a world, when will it change
The need for peace the need for something to
Give me hope
Cause this planet soon will reach the end of its
Rope
Governmental bureaucratic assholes tell me that
All is well
They also tell me that to have peace, stockpiles
Must swell
It seems to be though that their logic somehow
Just doesn't work
They must take us for jerks
Insanity by the numbers
Pushing 'til we break
It's insanity by the numbers
How much more will we take
We always sit and let them push us around
This is democracy let's stand our ground
For death is certain and life is not
Don't waste the time we got
The final countdown's slowly ticking away
On a clock that's gonna fucking blow us away
We're fighting for our very lies
Do we die or survive
Funny how we've seen its power yet we still build
Wasn't Hiroshima enough, 92,000 dead
But still this insanity keeps on dragging me down
What is this fascination they have with zero ground
It's insanityOn the day of my final sacrifice
The chilling steel open my veins
Blood staines my skin
Silver chalice must be filled
Drinking the poisoned blood
I enter my shadowed coffin
Two goathorns in my hands
I raise my arms and close my eyes
To receive the infernal hails
From my brother in the land of the damned
The howling wind blows in the naked trees
Moonlit fields are glowing in the dark
Below me, the path to the cemetery
Where my spiritual brothers take me
They halt at the shadows of an oak
My nocturnal funeral commence
Lying in my blasphemous sleep
I am lowered down to the pit
A raven sings my last song
As the wolves howl their goodbyes
The funeral moon glows strongly now
For I am nearly there
This night of late october
The darkside open it's gate
Morbid souls wait for me
- For satanic conspiracy
Flowers of doom
Rising in bloom
You will see
Our immortality!A veil of mist, a foreign coast
The calm before their battle cry
Steel drawn, the line of shields must hold
Through mist, the first arrow, it flies
Battle, hold firm the line in battle
Shoulder by shoulder, brothers at side
We may stand victorious or fall
This fine day, a fine day to die
We shall fight and may die by the sword
Cutting through flesh and bone, your sword
My brother, our father taught you well
But from behind the unseen blow
Mortally wounded, down you tell
Battle, hold firm the line in battle
Shoulder by shoulder, brothers at side
Silent by my side you did fall
This was a fine day a fine day to die
Brother, I'll keep your broken swordFacing the storm
And there's no one by my side
The curse will take its toll
Is it justice or a foolish pride
As the wind is blowing cold
And the winter takes control
How can I survive
In higher lights we seem to drown
We hold the key but not the crown
In higher lights we seem to drown
We hold the key but not the crown
Look into my eyes and see
For all the wisdom I still bleed
And only willow trees will bring
Oblivion
[Chorus]
Haunted by the lust of my father
Revenge is mine and down falls the kingdom
Conceived of his greed and a harsh reality
Haunted by the lust of my father
Revenge is mine and down falls the kingdom
Your ill gotten son
Your flesh and your blood
Faith fools the day
The honest man will fail my don
Facing another wound
Can't hold back the storm
Soon the winter reigns my heart
We're both caught in agony
In higher lights we seem to drown
We hold the key but not the crown
Oh I wish that I could turn back
Reach out for the grail and find it
I would offer soul and life
Feel the emptiness my dark son
[Chorus]
Feel this cold winter night
Frozen spirits in ice
Can't wash away the misery
The dark
War will take place at dawn
There's no choice it's all fate
I'm not strong enough
The path lies clearly ahead
There's no way out
Can't hold back all the greed
And all the good deeds
They are past
There's no choice it's all fate
It's so hopeless
Too long I was blind
Haunted by the lust of my father
Revenge is mine and down falls the kingdom
Conceived of his greed and a harsh reality
Haunted by the lust of my father
Revenge is mine and down falls the kingdom
By spilling our blood we are one bound
Forevermore
Haunted by the lust of my father
Revenge is mine and down falls the kingdom
Conceived of his greed and a harsh reality"No brain is left but here I got one more nail!"
The master's final word
When he created a 'hero' like you
Born to deride and to hurt
You don't try to find a reason why
You don't have a brain
(You don't want to have a brain)
You are just a masquerade, just a nice facade
In a snob parade, I know
(You don't know)
You don't have to wait, I'll be too late
When you meet to jump off the edge
You don't have to wait, I'll be too late
When you meet to jump off the edge
I'm not like you and I don't want to be
Follow the times to a place you can't see
Don't call in doubt what the fashing may bring
And you'll be falling down
Hammer the nail into what you don't know
Keep on believing you're strong
You got your pride and I got my peace
There's no sense in proving you wrong
We will fight just to stand upright
We are here to dare
(We will fight, we are here to dare)
Guts to sail against the stream, to defend the dream
To do what we feel, I know
(We will fight)
You don't have to wait, I'll be too late
When you meet to jump off the edge
You don't have to wait, I'll be too late
When you meet to jump off the edge
I'm not like you and I don't want to be
Follow the times to a place you can't see
Don't call in doubt what the flashing may bring
And you'll be falling down
Ooohhh
You don't have to wait, I'll be too late
When you meet to jump off the edge
You don't have to wait, I'll be too late
When you meet to jump off the edge
I'm not like you and I don't want to be
Follow the times to a place you can't see
Don't call in doubt what the fashing may bring
And you'll be...
(...they listen, they follow...and they fall...)Don't go blowing me a kiss,
'Cause you'll see it break down in all its elegance,
Like a model wearing the wrong make-up for her own fashion parade
Take the broken heart and stitch it up with some tears
Blush it up, dress it up and put some ice on it
keeps us cold
Frozen our lips turn lullabies numb
Your laughing melodies in time with the heartbreak
And rhyme
Don't go blowing me a kiss,
'Cause you'll see it break down in all its elegance,
Like a model wearing the wrong make-up for her own fashion parade
Biting your lip and I know,
You are faking it, you are hating it
Writing another lipstick letter
painting our script
you're the artist.
Red for the love
white for the lies
black the cliches
I see it in your eyes
Brush in some red
Sketch in some blue
Perfect picture
Me and you
Don't forget the title
"Inventing Tragedy in Black and White"
Don't go blowing me a kiss,
'Cause you'll see it break down in all its elegance,
Like a model wearing the wrong make-up for her own fashion parade
Singing my casualty
Painting my tragedy
At the bottom of your letters
All my love
All my love
Love
Love
Love
Love
Like a model wearing the wrong make-up for her own fashion parade
There's no melody that fits
With drop dead gorgeous
Your name doesn't fit with the chorus
Or a line from the song but
She...
Singing your tragedy
And her lipstick
Stains me...
And you
Love
Love
Love
LoveI told you once
Don't make me tell you again
Stop hanging around
Fantisizing that your some kind of friend
You've had your chance
This life belongs to me
I can't understand
What it is your trying to be
Just leave me alone
Stay the fuck away from me
I won't leave myself open
To your lies and deceit
You've had your chance
This life belongs to me
I can't understand
What it is your trying to be
Reality - Face Reality
Reality - Face Reality
You've had your chance
This life belongs to me
I can't comprehend
What it is your trying to be
You've had your chance
This life belongs to me
I can't understand
What it is your trying to beWeakened By The Things I've Done
Blackened Has My Soul Become
Satan Says He'll Set Me Free
But He's A Loser Just Like Me
The Things I've Done In My Past
It Haunts My Soul And Kills At Last
My Life Is A Path Of Pain
No Light And Laid In Chains
My Effort Contains No Meaning
The Srenght I Had - Now Weakening
As Time Passes The Soul Is Screaming
The Wall Of Grief Inside Increasing
Father, I Don't Need These Emotions
Why Won't You Just Stop The Pain
My Heart Has Become Hard As Stone
I've Brought Upon Myself A Wall
Jesus You Fought The Battle For Me
Help Me To See That You Sets Me Free
How Can I Manage To Live
I Don't Receive As Much As I Give
The Dark Side Of An Emotional Soul
Will Not Let This Become His Goal
A Struggle Against The Evil Within,
A Fight Which No Man Can Ever Win
Fooled By The Lie, Of Changing My Destiny
I Fought The Truth, Never To Rest In Peace
Is There A Way, How Can I Pay
Jesus You Fought The Battle For Me
Help Me To See That You Set Me Free"Incredible"
We're breaking the doors just like a wrecking ball
Tear up the walls, gonna make an earthquake
Painting in red, find love in criminals
Two steps ahead, gonna make your ground shake
Love is in the air, I feel it everywhere
This place is about to blow, blow, blow.
It's such a beautiful night,
I feel incredible.
Baby, you shine,
We're on the road
Beautiful night and we're unstoppable.
The crowd's going wild
Big city candy bars,
Aim for the sky
Better hold them tight, now
Living it up
Be in condescending mode
Dance till we drop
Better get it on, now.
Love is in the air, I feel it everywhere
This place is is about to blow, blow, blow.
It's such a beautiful night,
I feel incredible.
Baby, you shine, we're on our road
Beautiful night and we're unstoppable.
It's such a beautiful night,
I feel incredible.

I feel incredible.
Baby, you shine,
We're on our road
Beautiful night and we're unstoppable.
Beautiful night.
It's such a beautiful night.
Beautiful nigh.
It's such a beautiful night.Degradation, I don't want your rhinoplasty
I don't need you, not any more
Though I am a perverted man
Disproportioned version of a normal man
Dirty man, any surgery cannot get
The goddamn filth out of my head
Maladjusted not because of my appearance
You can't see past, how I was born
Are you blinded by the way you live?
Violated version of a normal man
Dirty man, reconstruction, reformation
Reaching out into a shallow world
My normal features, they gaze with impunity
I am an animal, don't want to be a man
I wish destruction on every man I see
Am I a man, am I a man, am I?
To forgive them means loss of my memory
Can I decide between a psycho and a citizen
No chance of that, I want death to my enemy
I'm not a man, I'm not a man
How can you think of me
Judge of me, watch me?
All I want to be is, is to be free
Degradation, I don't want your rhinoplasty
I don't need you
Though I am a perverted man
Disproportioned version of a normal man
Dirty man, any surgery cannot get
The goddamn filth out of my headSoaked in blood only to be sterilized
Served alive, I want to be traumatized
Soaked in blood only to be sterilized
Served alive, I want to be traumatized
Don't tell, don't tell, keep this in your locket
Don't tell, don't tell, keep this in your locket
Don't tell, don't tell, keep this in your locket
Soaked in blood only to be sterilized
Served alive, I want to be traumatized
Soaked in blood only to be sterilized
Served alive, I want to be traumatized
Wade in the water, careful for sharks
Wade in the water but not for too long
Wade in the water, careful for sharks
Wade in the water but not for too long
Wade in the water, careful for sharks
Wade in the water but not for too long
Wade in the water, careful for sharks
Wade in the water, not for too long
The pain is deep and wide
Cannot escape from the lives we have made
Where are we now?
I'm starting to forget
Just what it was you said exactly
The love is gone only to spawn
Disastrous memory
I'm starting to forget
I'm starting to forget
I'm starting to forget
Soaked in blood only to be sterilized
Served alive, I want to be traumatized
Soaked in blood only to be sterilized
Served alive, I want to be traumatizedDreams close the reality of truth
An endless sleep - an immortal life
Reality banned to the past
Fixation of another world
Floating on glass clouds
I can fly I feel free
Feelings of life are distant
A dream captured in the next dream
The dead-end of subconsciousness extends - extends
Into the infinity of truth
The dreams of manking
Hope - Wishes - Love or uncertainty
Fear - Hate - Like
Like a self-developed film - Like a self-developed film
But who will show you the way
Your mind playing on tricks on you
Everything over when you awaken
Or is it an awakening in another dream
Dreams of confusion - Dreams of confusion
Dreams close the reality of truth
An endless sleep - an immortal life
Reality banned to the past
Fixation of another world
Floating on glass clouds
I can fly I feel free
Feelings of life are distant
A dream captured in the next dream
The dead-end of subconsciousness extends
Into the infinity of truth
The dreams of manking
Hope - Wishes - Love or uncertainty
Fear - Hate - Like
Like a self-developed film - Like a self-developed film
But who will show you the way
Your mind playing on tricks on you
Everything over when you awaken
Or is it an awakening in another dream
Dreams of confusion - Dreams of confusionIt's days like this I wish that I, wish that I had stayed asleep
It's times like these that make it so difficult to be
The light at the end, the crack in the sky
There's no promise for release
No way for me to get away
And all I'm trying to do is breath
Searching, for something more
Searching, for something right
Searching, for a sense of clarity
Searching, for a place to die!
Days like this I really wish, I really wish I wasn't me
It's times like this that make it hard, makes it hard to fuckin' see
No light at the end, no crack in the sky
Everyone ends up deceased
A life like mine makes a man, turns a grown man to a flea
Searching, for something more
Searching, for something right
Searching, for a sense of clarity
Searching, for a place to die!
Piece by piece, I slowly fade away,
I slowly drift apart
I see a different world, closing in on the future
Sorry to be so cynical but it's all I know
Piece by piece, I slowly start to change
I slowly start to change!
It's days like this I wish that I, wish that I had stayed asleep
It's times like these that make it so difficult to be
No light at the end, no crack in the sky
Everyone ends up deceased
A life like mine makes a man, turns a grown man to a flea
Searching, for something more
Searching, for something right
Searching, for a sense of clarity
Searching, for a place to die!
Searching for a place to die!fear and sweat, my muscles ache
I smile but it's just a fake
I fade away
it troubles me, what you're gonna say
just a day away
and you will be here to stay
I wait and I wait
and what i really hate
is the panic that stops me from breathing
my knees hit the floor
and I panic more
until you open my door[Instrumental]No, I can't go on
I'm waiting only for tomorrow
Life, so meaningless and hollow
It's the circle of sorrow
All I once believed in is dead
A faded halo around my head
Innocence turns into regret
A sinner in a white veil
The bond of trust
Burned by lust
One wicked glance led into killing romance
Now I know that death can dance
CHORUS
In the shadows of the endless night
I'm paying the sins with my life
It hurts to come into daylight
I'm cursed to roam in the dark
The passion of life
Gone in the shade of night
With no belief and bleeding wings
I'm half of the man I used to be
CHORUSWeakness shines
Right off the teeth of your pathetic smile
Nerve is gone T
He minute I turn my back the weasel runs
Spineless
That's what you are
Spineless Seven year itch
Spineless
You're so bizarre
Spineless Son of a bitch
Overthrow
They'll aim for the apple on your head but shoot too low
Say your prayers
Can't find room on this earth for you anywhere
Spineless
That's what you are S
Spineless Seven year itch
Spineless
You're so bizarre
A Spineless
Son of a bitch
Spineless
Spineless fool
You are no exception to the rule
Heed these words
Stand up now or be the eternal nerd
Spineless
That's what you are
Spineless Seven year itch
Spineless
You're so bizarre
Spineless Son of a bitch
Spineless
That's what you are
Spineless Seven year itch
Spineless
You're so bizarre
Spineless Son of a bitchDid you really believe you could silence me, bury me?
You, who loved me because I never give up, never flee
It calls me, it seduces me, it touched me, it was so warm
I saw it, I felt in love with it, I became its slave,
In life or in death, you'll be mine and nobody else's
When I fall
I'll rise stronger than before
Set fire to my hopes
From the flames I was born
Losing the battle, doesn't mean losing the war, by far
Like a shadow, I am immortal, as long as there is light in my heart
I will follow your trace, cut your wings,
I 'll follow you scent, make it end... for you
I can hide; I can breathe under water,
I can change my face,I am a sorcerer,
You will never escape
I'll come back from darkness
When I fall
I'll rise stronger than before
Set fire to my hopes
From the flames I was bornMan come on girl, you know we tryin to do something.

Girl, give me one week and I'm a have your ass tweakin
Medications decreations, survive and put down a beating

De Lidelser i sljor Lust Beklr
En Blick frn Ovan sknker mig mitt mod
Frn andra sidan dr jag stod
Jag sg hur Djvulen kom fram
Och sen tilltalade mig vid namn
Ur gon svarta sipprar Sjlens gld
Och i min famn ligger Hon dd
Fr Hennes liv och Hennes kropp
Ger min sjl evigt hopp
"How throbs the pulse when first we view
The eye that rolls in glossy blue
Or sparkels black, or mildly throws
A beam from under hazel brows!
How quick we credit every oath
And hear her plight the willing troth!
Fondly we hope 'twill last for aye
When lo! She changes in a day"
[Lord Byron]
Jag ser och hr mycket mer nr krleken dr
Dr Satans horor smeker min kropp
Sliter mitt Ktt och dricker mitt Blod
Det r dit jag vill - Att bra Hans sigill
Och i Kttets Makt - Ledas till Slakt!
Se en Man som jag nr ondskan har ftt tag p
Varje liten bit av hans sjlYour pain is my pain
Your suffer is my suffer
Your tears are my tears
Your fate is my fate
Understand me!
his pain is my pain
his heart is my heart
his blood is my blood
his soul is my soul
I hope you hear me!Waiting and watching the sands slip away from me
Looking into the eyes of eternity
I have feared the cold grip of death and the unforeseen
I have hoped the end of my life would begin all my dreams
Returning from an empty Eden and shattering life's fantasies
To my rebirth, I owe my chance
Spiraling into the mouth of infinity
Fighting the haunting remains of my memory
I have felt the cold hand of death and the nothingness
I can hear the calling that brings me back from the abyss
Returning from an empty Eden and shattering life's fantasies
To my rebirth, I owe this chance
To know the only hell is burning deep in the stars
From my rebirth, to Destiny's End
We were born unto the end
Our destiny's in our hands
Emerging from the womb of the universe
Walking the path of my former existence
I can see a vision of life and it's beckoning
I can shed the thoughts of my past and live once again
I've seen the end
Returning from an empty Eden and shattering life's fantasies
To my rebirth, I owe this chance
To know the only hell is burning deep in the stars
From my rebirth, to Destiny's EndHeute hauen wir richtig auf die Pauke
Und der ganze rger bleibt zuhause
Wir wandern von der Oder bis zum Rhein
Es ist angezapft, komm schenk was ein!

Wir singen 1, 2, 3My faith runs thinner than water
for every wish had a name and every heart had a fracture
With every fear there was someone, somwhere
who loved before, who hoped before
Someone who cried out ten thousand oceans
and someone who bled out the evening in search of you
They carried hope thick in their visions
and they held you deep in their chests
You said this would be nimble and painless
I'm sorry, that's not what i have found
Devil stay away from meOnce upon a time
a time far past
you broke my heart
and broken it would last...
You left your scars
and your scars run deep
I think of you as I weep
But soon the sorrow evolves
into the purest love
a love to see you dying
my angel from above
Days filled with confusion
nights of endless search
in horror you will be weltering as I emerge
What you did to me
now comes to you
in an act of love
I will run you through
I leave my scars
and my scars run deep
with a grin I turn around
and I leave you bleeding on the groundInstrumentalThe song that angels sing,
The spell that calls the Gathering.
The magic that might bring
Eternal life, the Gathering.
I see a world in anger,
I see a world in pain.
Each day a different story,
But still the message is the same.
Hard news I set beside me,
Sweet dreams is what I need.
What daylight wants to show me
At night, appears to be insane.
May I ask you in?
Shall I...
Shall I persuade you?
The song that angels sing,
The spell that calls the Gathering.
The magic that might bring
Eternal life, the Gathering.
My cards, the ones to choose from
The role they play tonight.
Which ones embrace the loved ones?
Which ones will summon for a fight?
Show me your precious darlings
And I will crush them all.
Wave with your blooded sword and
I'll kiss to show I'm not afraid.
May I ask you in?
Shall I...
Shall I persuade you?
The song that angels sing,
The spell that calls the Gathering.
The magic that might bring
Eternal life, the Gathering.
The song that angels sing,
The spell that calls the Gathering.
The magic that might bring
Eternal life, the Gathering.I ASKED YOU TO SIT WITH ME
FOR THE SUN RISE
I SAID IT'S QUITE A THING TO SEE
BUT YOU TURNED TO ME AND SAID
NO THANK YOU I'D RATHER WATCH THE T.V.
WHAT'S AH MATTER WITH YOU
YOU'RE GOING NO WHERE
WHAT'S AH MATTER WITH YOU
WHY DON'T YOU CARE
WHAT'S AH MATTER WITH YOU
AFRAID OF A STARE
WHAT'S AH MATTER WITH YOU
REALIZE LIFE'S NOT FAIR
I ASKED YOU TO TAKE A DAY OFF
WORK AND SPEND IT WITH ME
BUT YOU TURNED TO ME AND SAID
NO THANK YOU
I'VE NO TIME AND LIFE'S NOT FREEMucha, mucha policÃ­a por las calles todo el dÃ­a
Buscando delincuentes que no estÃ¡n entre la gente
Entre la gente, entre la gente, entre la gente
PolÃ­ticos mamones que nos tocan los cojones
Vendiendo un futuro que no vale ni un duro
Ni un duro, ni un duro
No se que puedo hacer

No se que puedo hacer
Na, na, y yo aquÃ­, Â¡Si!, JugÃ¡ndome la vida
Na, na, a cara o cruz, Â¡A cara o cruz!
Tipos tristes de traje gris por las calles de Madrid
Trabajando como hormigas para irse a las Malvinas
A las Malvinas, a las Malvinas, a las Malvinas

Nunca encuentro lo que busco y

Approaching while Im sleeping
You take my hands in tears
So sweet
Gentle
Your smile instilled with sadness
I hear your soundless voice
So close
You felt my deepest hurt
Now you heal my soul
Taking your last caress
I can find a shelter to recline
Lovely
You fascinating angel
Your eyes relieve my
Anxious mind
Listen
My breath is growing faster
Until I reach the end
Of pain
Lost in your cold embrace
Ill perceive your light
Burning my life inside
You will see my fire fade away
And it seems so unreal
While you give me your love just one time
As I lose my last drop of strength
You bring me what I did not dare to findLong I've roamed lands which are not mine
Admired Cappadocia, enjoyed Greek wine
Tea at the Bosporus, travelled the river Rhine
Heard the Lorelei sing, a song divine
My grave is easily found
And there I shall gladly be
Buried in the shadow
Beneath my cypress tree
My spirit travelled The Highlands
The North Sea taught me humbleness
My mind got drunk by the beauty of France
In Bretagne and Ireland a Celtic dance
My grave is easily found
And there I shall gladly be
Buried in the shadow
Beneath my cypress tree
No trace of Helen at the remains of Troy
But her glorious beauty shining through
On many a gracious peasant girl
In picturesque villages far below
Winds of Galicia, mountains of Spain
Portuguese valleys, English domain
Skandinavia, Alexandria
Passion for wandering, impossible to restrain
My grave is easily found
And there I shall gladly be
Buried in the shadow
Beneath my cypress tree
When my time on earth is over
And my journey has come to an end
Remembering the white cliffs of Dover
Or the breeze of our Lowlands
Of our LowlandsSay goodbye and close your eyes, let's drift away
Like a ship on the ocean, we'll set sail for a better day
Come live in a daydream, this is your wonderland
Let's swim in the deep sea, so jump in and take my hand
Dream away don't wait for the night
'Cause any old time at all sounds good to me
Hello, you can open your eyes, we're almost there
Can you feel all the energy, there's magic everywhere
Come live in a daydream, this is your destiny
Just let the feeling surround you and it will set you free
We've all got problems, don't let them get to you
Amd when your feeling down, there's only one thing to do
Dream away don't wait for the night
'Cause any old time at all sounds good to me
Dream away, everything's alright
I hope it sounds good to you, sounds good to me
Sounds good to me
We've all got problems, don't let them get to you
Amd when your feeling down, there's only one thing to doInner decay divine for all
Abysmal pain, I sleep under the skin
A fatal endless maze of shame
Killing pride in self annihilation
Look in my eyes
Remnants of lust
Join the bitter conflict now
Feeding on anger
Beholding the cries of dismay
In a bitter conflict
Come on
Arise, stand strong
Disciples of the fall
A living lust of war inside
For all is set to end in all
We're sworn to fuckin' live through and prevail
A force-fed suffering
To embrace your private agony
With just another casualty
While I show you we are all servants of fear
Inner decay divine for all
Abysmal pain, I sleep under the skin
A fatal endless maze of shame
Killing pride in self annihilation
Feeding on anger
Beholding the cries of dismay
Unconditional hate eternal
Come on
Arise, stand strong
Disciples of the fall
A living lust of war inside
For all is set to end in all
We're sworn to fuckin' live through and prevail
A force-fed suffering
To embrace your private agony
As just another casualty
While I show you we are all the servants of fearOh I'm that sick I see it that way
I'd rather be dead then have you stay
You pretend that it's OK
Right now it's my time to take
Feeding off my hate today
Feeding off the lives I waste
Now it's time to change my ways
Now it's time to erase my name
Can't see my face
You can't see my face now
Pass out of existence
Gone
Disgusted by your presence now
I wonder what it would be like if you were down
Could you cope? Could you really cope?
Could you hope? Or would you sit and wait for me?
Seeking for my placement now
Now it's time to change my ways
Now it's time to erase my name
Can't see my face
You can't see my face now
Pass out of existence
When I close my eyes
I see myself dead
I know you want it this way don't you?
When I close my eyes
I see myself
Dead, gone nowBring that break funk
'Cause I'm here giving what you want
Like spread got time to stop got
Time to peel back the roof on my new drop top
The day looking good to me
Got girls want to know cause I freak like jodeci
Besides that let's get with the ground
Want to hear that again then press rewind
If you want to get with me
You've gotta let go baby
If you want to get with me
I don't know what it is but you make me high
A burning feeling that starts inside
It really doesn't matter who's wrong or right
We can go all night, we're going all night
Base vibration
Check it out when my rhyme began
I'll drop my rhyme upon this beat
And make you people move your feet
Everybody from the front to the back, c'mon
Feel the rhythm when I bounce the track
I've gotta hit that, don't want to sit back
I really want to see your hands, could I get that, c'mon
If you want to get with me
You've gotta let go baby
If you want to get with me
I don't know what it is but you make me high
A burning feeling that starts inside
It really doesn't matter who's wrong or right
We can go all night, we're going all night
I don't know what it is but you make me high
A burning feeling that starts inside
It really doesn't matter who's wrong or right
We can go all night, we're going all night
I don't know what it is but you make me high
A burning feeling that starts inside
It really doesn't matter who's wrong or right
We can go all night, we're going all nightYour crimson lies
Betrayal of his trust
Don't walk through me
When reality becomes too much
The end runs through my veins
The perfect storm arrives
Bless you with death
Caressed by evil's touch
Cold infinity
The useless has survived
Shield through vanity
Resist all you see
Gather among failure
Cling to those around
Bless you with death
Caressed by evil's touch
Cry
Cry toward, toward the bleeding sky
Once dead has come alive
Spread
Spread your glowing black wings
You can't resolve these things
False idols of mankind
Are frail like the ones you know
Consumed by his poisoned heart
Consumed by your vacant thoughts
Protect yourself
So small in the light
Cleansed from filth
Awash with hollow hands
A vision of clarity
This moment is sown in time
Disengage reality
Formless the shape in the sky
Kill your
Kill yourself for foolish pride
The secrets that you hide
Kill the
Kill the absent, sacred one
His words will never come alive
False idols of mankind
Are frail like the ones you know
Consumed by his poisoned heart
Consumed by your vacant thoughts
Release your worth
It's all you see
And your need to control
Destroyer of hopes
And all your dreams
Couldn't be more useless to me
False idols of mankind
Are frail like the ones you know
Consumed by his poisoned heart
Consumed by your vacant thoughtsI'll smile when your face cracks, and this trail of shit catches up with you. Maybe I would love to lie, if I lived a day in your life: so empty, so meaningless. No dreams. No hopes. Just night after night, this is your life. So empty, so meaningless. Just night after night, of social unconsciousness, where you pretend to get along, and sing out of key to the same fucking songs, over and over again. This is your life, it's all laid out in front of you, nothing will ever change. No one will ever care. We'll see who's laughing then, your dreams are empty and hopeless. No one will ever miss you. We'll see who's laughing then, your dreams are empty and hopeless. No one will ever miss you. We'll see who's laughing then. And not because, you couldn't be, you never tried, to look inside. Nothing will ever change. I'm sorry. I can't wait to see you fall.Dragged after the chariots In chains Of secret ways of fate Through desert sands
And burning waste I'll beat my chains into a sword Then from the shadow
I shall come forth With light and flame Under mist of stars Rip the night Reveal myself

This could be the kingdom of heaven This could be the kingdom of you
This could the kingdom of heaven Come true

And burning waste I'll beat my chains into a sword

freedom and peace brought on peaople's request
but the halo is solied and the cabbage's gone sour
teuton tantrums and a world to devour
what they call the union of prosperity and peace
is the conductor of economy's bringing europe to its knees
and it stars to go faster
vicious circle, downward spiral
the rich get richer and the poor begin to starve
pauperized masses told to paint the world brown
it's the merry-go-round to unravel the teutonic mind
sleeping beauty waking up again
coming soon to a theatre near you
unlished arayans, plague of locusts
all these years of peace to undo
what they call the union of prosperity and peace
is the conductor of economy's bringing europe to its knees
down and down we goIt's getting near dawn, when lights close their tired eyes.
I'll soon be with you my love, to give you my dawn surprise.
I'll be with you darling soon.
I'll be with you when the stars start falling.
I'll be with you darling soon.
I'll be with you when the stars start falling.
I've been waiting so long to be where I'm going,
In the sunshine of your love.
I'm with you my love.
The light's shining through on you.
Yes, I'm with you my love, it's the morning and just we two.
I'll stay with you darling now.
I'll stay with you 'til my seas are dried up.

S.P.I.R.I.T.
Spirit, let's hear it
Let's go!
I've had enough
There's a voice in my head
Says I'm better off dead
But if I sing along
A little fucking louder to a happy song
I'll be alright
You want to give up
Gave it all that you've got and it still doesn't cut
But if you sing along
A little fucking louder to a happy song
You'll be just fine 'cause
Every now and again we get that feeling
And the great big void inside us opens up
And I really wish that you could help
But my head is like a carousel
And I'm going round in circles
I'm going round in circles
S.P.I.R.I.T.
Spirit, let's hear it
S.P.I.R.I.T.
Spirit, let's hear it
We are possessed
We're all fucked in the head
Alone and depressed
But if we sing along
A little fucking louder to a happy song
Maybe we'll forget 'cause
Every now and again we get that feeling
And the great big void inside us opens up
And I really wish that you could help
But my head is like a carousel
And I'm going round in circles
I'm going round in circles
Don't wake us up, we'd rather just keep dreaming
'Cause the nightmares in our heads are bad enough
And I really wish that you could help
But my head is like a carousel
And I'm going round in circles
I'm going round in circles
The world has coalesced
Into one giant mess
Of hate and unrest
So let's all sing along
A little goddamn louder to a happy song
And pretend it's all ok
Let's go!
So sing along
Let's sing along
A little fucking louder
A little fucking louder
Well, don't you feel so much better?
S.P.I.R.I.T.
Spirit, let's hear it (well, that's the spirit)
S.P.I.R.I.T.
Spirit, let's hear it (yeah, that's the spirit)Scheue nicht Gefahr noch Leiden
Lebe nicht von vergangenen Herrlichkeiten
Liegt auch Stolz in der Erinnerung
Das Alte wird nicht wieder jung.
...die dich hassen
die sich allein auf ihre Macht verlassen
willst du dienen und verlieren
leiden oder triumphieren.
Unter der Asche
Und bricht dein Herz noch tausendmal entzwei
Denk daran, jeder Schmerz der geht einmal vorbei
Bedrckt auch Einsamkeit dich in stiller Not
Erhalte Dir den Lebensmut.
Trume nicht zum letzten Mal
Denn aus Freiheit wird Stacheldraht
Betrge die Verlogenheit
Entreie der Vergangenheit die Vergnglichkeit.
[Lyrics: Eumel]On a hill, on the devil's top
There is a man hiding in the shadows of the night
He's trying to stop the course of time
The line dividing good from wrong
There is more than meets the eye
In this world full of lies and death
The devil's carriage is leading
All the souls to a place so far away
You can't deny your innocence
Your life won't be forever
You should show your nicest part
You are the one who cries
You will see
What you have never seen
In the afterlife you know you will forever be
At the fair, in the dragon's lair
You won't be safe
'Cause the red driver's waiting there
He will be taking you through a nightmare
You have never had before
You can't deny your innocence
Your life won't be forever
You should show your nicest part
You are the one who cries
You will see
What you have never seen
In the afterlife you know you will forever be
You will see
What you have never seen
In the afterlife you know you will forever be
The devil's carriage ride
It's a trip to the other side
All it's said and done
Won't count a single word
Been taken in the devil's care
You've never been a step downstairs
But you have to know
It's gonna happen here and now
It's your future and watch out
'Cause the devil's carriage's running on and on
At the fair, in the dragon's lair
You won't be safe
'Cause the red driver's waiting there
He will be taking you through a nightmare
You have never had before
At the sight of this dark fright night
He came and took another soul
Bleeding all its light
And from the coach the sound of laughter, of laughter
You will see
What you have never seen
In the afterlife you know you will forever be
You will see
What you have never seen
In the afterlife you know you will forever be
The devil's carriage ride
It's a trip to the other side
All it's said and done
Won't count a single word
Been taken in the devil's care
You've never been a step downstairs
But you have to know
It's gonna happen here and now
It's your future and watch out
'Cause the devil's carriage's running on and onTurn on temptation, arise, tear the sky
This nightmare is everywhere, my eyes open wide
Crash on through troubled waters, oceans collide
We stand alone until the end, we fight side by side
Standing strong together, marching forever on
Fire in the heavens, now that our time has come
We feel the fire burning bright in the night
Where the warrior lives and the warrior dies
Wherever you go we will be by your side
For the spirit of ninja will carry the night
The sky will turn black, the nightfall appears
The hatred surrounding they hide in great fear
The evil all around the sound they will hear
Will not be for long now the time it is near
Raising hell forever, still millenniums go by
Fire in the heavens, bleeding ears hear the cry
We feel the fire burning bright in the night
Where the warrior lives and the warrior dies
Wherever you go we will be by your side
For the spirit of ninja will carry the night
Standing strong together, marching forever on
Fire in the heavens, now that our time has come
We feel the fire burning bright in the night
Where the warrior lives and the warrior dies
Wherever you go we will be by your side
For the spirit of ninja tonight
We feel the fire burning bright in the night
Where the warrior lives and the warrior dies
Wherever you go we will be by your side
For the spirit of ninja will carry the night
Ninja forever tonightThrough the ages

[II.]This flesh, it burns in the fire.
Broken bodies, blackened bones in the ashes.
Unmarked iron in the fire, invincible.
I will never fucking burn.
This corpse is down by the river, washed up hatred.
Fucking drowned in the water, unknown victim.
Another day, once more chance.
Make a change, seize this time.
On your grave from this life.
Fall of the sun.
On your knees from disgrace.
Pierced from within.
You will unmask this man.
You will follow this corpse to his grave.
This time we'll plan it all our way, we will survive.
Injured pride in our bodies, savaged power.
In the fire, invincible.
I will never fucking burn.
Revolution on its way, we will stand now.
Rising again in your honour, angered victim.
One more revolution.Esta vez, te lo dedico a vos hermano amigo
que desde ayer. Andas conmigo este camino.
Es ma la suerte de poder cantar esto que mando; agradecido.
A vos arquetipo del nunca aflojar.
Leal y gamba. Amigo fundido estoy con vos.
No olvid, ser por eso que aunque yo rezo
no creo en el perdn,
si en el destino que nos arrim.
Fueron las plateadas cruces de Black Sabbath y su resplandor
sumadas a la bella sptima estrella y la concha de Dios
que estamos unidos,
desde el medioda del domingo aquel
donde se intercambiaban discos de vinilo.
Con rumbo al otro lado vamos vos y yo
vos y yo.
No olvid, ser por eso que aun rezo
no creo en el perdn
si en el destino que nos arrim.
Fueron las plateadas cruces de Black Sabbath y su resplandor
sumadas a la bella sptima estrella y la concha de Dios
que estamos unidos,
desde el medioda del domingo aquel
donde se intercambiaban discos de vinilo.
Con rumbo al otro lado vamos vos y yo
con rumbo al otro lado vos y yo fundido a vos
No olvid.What is the fault of being so different
So real insane it is so deep inside
A grin plays over my lips cause I know
That their existence is running out
Wake up, is it real or a lie
Inside, are you dead or alive
Wake up, when our liar is killing us
All the fakes in we trust
What has gone wrong in our sick brains
So real insane it is so deep inside
Mud runs out of the mouth
It's like waking up stoned
The existence is running out
We are deaf we are dump we are blind
When our failures getting clear
We are deaf we are dump we are blind
While the end is coming nearI've been up for nights and days
And my eyes remain wide awake
Because more than my life's at steak
So I ain't got time for blinkin'
All the time I'm thinkin'
If this ain't hell it's one fiery place
Metallic projectiles fly in ya face
And leave you like human garbage lyin' in drains
I've gotta keep my eyeballs open
The only thing that'll minus the pain like ibuprofen is
9milli and K on the case
I don't feel in control like pilots in planes
I'm trapped in this winding maze
I'm an insomniac, I'm insane
I've been up for days and nights
Through this crazy life
But I'll sleep when I'm dead
Until they pay me right
My eyes are open wide
But I'll sleep when I'm dead
When everything on my to do list is ticked off
Then maybe I can drift off
Until then I'm wide awake, lyin' in a daze
My eyeballs gaze
Hypnotized by the sound of my wrist watch
Clickin' tick tock
I'm in charge of the underground just like Brick Top
So I can't sleep I'd be wrong if I did stop
If I'm focused on writing a verse
You couldn't put me to sleep
With a thousand and nine
Bottles of night nurse
It's likely I'll put ya lights out first
So I'll sleep when I'm restin' in peace
Until then I've gotta bless these beats
Till I conquer the streets
If I'm conscious, I can't get lost in a dream
I've been up for days and nights
Through this crazy life
But I'll sleep when I'm dead
Until they pay me right
My eyes are open wide
But I'll sleep when I'm dead
If you're drowsy, remain in a slumber
My metaphors flow over ya head
Like a button less jumper
I can't sleep till I'm in the sky
Like lightning and thunder
Sometimes at night I wonder
Is pursuein' this dream a blunder
Or the best thing that I ever did
I can't sleep or slip till I'm 6 feet under
Hence the song I'll sleep when I'm dead
You might only need money to survive
But my life relies on a needle instead
I wanna eat steak meals everyday
I'm sick and tired of livin' on a diet
Of beans and bread
So believe what I said
I'll sleep when I'm where
I'll sleep when I'm what
I'll sleep when I'm dead
I've been up for days and nights
Through this crazy life
But I'll sleep when I'm dead
Until they pay me right
My eyes are open wide
But I'll sleep when I'm dead
I've been up for days and nights
Through this crazy life
But I'll sleep when I'm dead
Until they pay me right
My eyes are open wide
But I'll sleep when I'm dead2000 years ago
someone died
he is known to man as the son of a god
[subchorus:]
what kind of father lets his son die?
his time will come; an eye for an eye
look at a history of 2000 years
there's no joy left; there are only tears
and as time went on
wars and hunger;
the inheritance of his son
and soon we'll join him in the battle
against you
there's only one thing left to do
[subchorus]
god cries, blood on his hands and tears in his eyes
godforsaken dreams, the failure and the shame
let's goon the other side, let us cross the styx
not out of curiosity, we want revenge
when we meet our maker
we'll ask him why
and we stab him in the back
just as he did to us
now we're on the other side
we know what we came for
blood for blood is the rule
our judgement has come
[subchorus]
2000 years ago
someone died
god cries, blood on his hands and tears in this eyes
godforsaken dreams, the failure and the shame
2000 years ago
someone criedYou're a bad bitch, I know it, that's why you don't care
You make it look so easy, it's so unfair
I would lick your hallway clean girl, I swear (oh, yeah)
I'm dedicated to trying to make your team this year
Right about now, you should be wrapped up in clouds, pretty lady
Right about now, you should be feeling my love in your heart
Cause my daddy always told me basic math would come in handy sometime
And now I finally understand why
Two nickels ain't the same as one dime
I'm hold back what I wanna say, and it's driving me crazy
Maybe I just don't know where to start
It's not the "no" I'm scared of girl, yeah, it's the maybe
That you might fuck around and go breaking my heart, yeah
Right about now, you should be wrapped up in clouds, pretty lady
Right about now, you should be feeling my love in your heart
'Cause my daddy always told me basic math would come in handy sometime
And now I finally understand why
Two nickels ain't the same as one dimeoh my Tesco girl
pretty foreign you are to me
would you like to know yet more
about our fate or the ONT
how is your life ?
(is it) run away with me tonight
the crops may fail but you'd always be true
(I know) a beautiful Tesco girl
are you happy now ?
with all the things that I never gave to you
is it all just a come and go ?
and a lost Tesco girl
farewell (my) Tesco girl
for I will never see you again
another dream brings another face
and I will never know youNacÃ­ para amarte
Yo te darÃ­a lo que quieras
Mi corazon, mi vida entera
Tu pide que yo te voy a complacer
Quiero recordarte
Que yo soy tuyo cuando quieras
Que yo te amo a mi manera
Quisiera que algÃºn dÃ­a tu fueras mi mujer
Y asÃ­ juntos poder algÃºn dÃ­a
Vivir la alegrÃ­a
De darnos placer
La razÃ³n de esta sutil melodÃ­a
De una poesÃ­a que te quise hacer
Por ti me he vuelto un poeta
Hago rimas en mi vieja libreta
Miro al cielo esperando un cometa
Para pedirle un deseo y es que te traiga hasta aquÃ­
Por ti me he vuelto un poeta
Ya yo tengo mil hojas repletas
Un armario de paginas completas
Que escribo cuando te veo y eso me hace feliz
Me hace feliz tenerte
Y es que me imagino al lado tuyo hasta la muerte
Siempre que me asomo a mi venta es para verte
Quiero que la siguiente maÃ±ana traiga suerte
Para convertirme en el dueÃ±o de tu corazon
Parar ser realidad lo que paso como ilusiÃ³n
Una sensaciÃ³n, la falta de razÃ³n
La combinaciÃ³n de amor con atracciÃ³n
Tu me gustas, como negarlo
No me asusta, solo hay que demostrarlo
Estoy buscando una oportunidad para expresarlo
Por lo que veo yo voy a amarte por un rato largo
Por ti me he vuelto un poeta
Hago rimas en mi vieja libreta
Miro al cielo esperando un cometa
Para pedirle un deseo y es que te traiga hasta aquÃ­
Por ti me he vuelto un poeta
Ya yo tengo mil hojas repletas
Un armario de paginas completas
Que escribo cuando te veo y eso me hace feliz

Miro al cielo esperando un cometa
Para pedirle un deseo y es que te traiga hasta aquÃ­
Por ti me he vuelto un poeta
Ya yo tengo mil hojas repletas

Darker thought, darker need
Pure in heart, clean in soul
Dead in life, empty hole
Black is the veil that hides our tears
Black is our life through all its years
Black is our soul as it leaves the earth
Black is the child that awaits its birth
Angel world, dying sky
Beautiful one in dirt to die
Scarecrow child alone to sing
That are and be	, the hangman's swing
Black is the veil that hides our tears
Black is our life through all its years
Black is our soul as it leaves the earth
Black is the child that awaits its birth
Darker shade, darker breed
Darker thought, darker need
Scarecrow child alone to sing
That are and be	, the hangman's swing
Black is the veil that hides our tears
Black is our life through all its years
Black is our soul as it leaves the earth
Black is the child that awaits its birthBurning all the lost hopes I was breeding
turning cold nights into an autumn pyre
after the silence you've broken
after the aeons that have shone on your frail skin
nothing has left of your eyes
and nothing as left in your memories
burning all the strong knots I was weaving
bringing my life back to this blackened womb
after that time has passed over
after this storm that has turned into the sweetest rain
hear what I'm saying, I'm free on my way
and I don't long for your frozen sun
over the flames of a shelter that was never built to last
we're forging our strength
forging our fate
forging our life with the bloos that we've spent
blessed be these wounds
blessed be my doom
as I burn, as I burn thy frozen sunPulse expire, death comes in a burst
Black forecast of a lifelong thirst
Lord of the tomb by my side
Cadaverous, dead and insane in the eye
Speak a madman's prophecy
He will drain my soul when it is free
Phantoms of the grave kill to survive
Sucking death-energy from the ones who will die
Into death cast
A spiral of the past
Eclipse grips for my soul
Torn from death's bed
And buried by the dead
Their hands are white and cold
Crawling through the soil and snow
Pitch-black grave cracks up below
Screams measure a timeless echo
Hideous figures laugh and beckon
Coming through me
Souls imprisoned in gore
Malignant anguish never seen before
Victims drag their limbs across the halls of the dead
Funeral bell rings to celebrate the dread
Deteriorating
All my flesh and my bones
Are ready to explode in a gush of red foam
Virulent infectious death-disease is spread
Rush of thoughts vanish as I die undeadhe rose up from a toilet
bearing gifts and bleeding from his ass
and from his disinfected mausoleum
he scrubbed his hands
and prepared for surgery
inside the operating room he screamed
i believe this patient is already dead
the nurse's laughter echoed through the halls
as the doctor lit a smoke and shook his head
i've discovered another flaw in god's sick invention
we have built a time machine to travel through other dimensions
the mercitron engaged the patient in
a defenseless war against mortality
angered by the latest turn of events
the doctor felt he should part company
upon arrival on the planet mars
while waiting for the mothership to come
dr. piranha and his faithful disciples
in orbit searched for a baboon's heart
we are what we are
we are what we are
christ clones are imprisoned
in slave camps on a planet of trolls
as coal mines and tar pits
are filled with dead astronauts
malpractice in the cosmos
the garden of stars is filled with vengeful enemies
assassins and hitmen eagerly await orders
for research subjects to be purchased by the highest bidder
i will be hunted for infinity
detected with a dna radar
they'll watch my every move
the voices in my head will never cease
mocking me over and over and over and over again
we are what we are
we are what we are
christ clones are imprisoned
in slave camps on a planet of trolls
as coal mines and tar pits
are filled with dead astronautsa different world waits for me
a hideaway from all that's wrong
across the waves to enchanted isles
far away and there we'll stay
we all live troubled lives
but I'd rather stay here in the dark
you like the west but I go north
there is more than one true love
I'm just passing by and people change
hearing you say "people change"
and then you blackened all the stars
and then you never looked back
and then you sent the gods away
and then they never came back
and then I saw you in my dreams
and then you never came backRunning them off the highway
Running them off the rail
Running their babies into cold black water
Just me and my stash and my scale
Filling the tank over flowing
Filling a dirty syringe
Filling another cemetery
Hope drinking blood don't make you cringe no
Seeing is still not believing
Seeing that you're still here
Seeing you fall from the eighth floor window
Your reputation to smear
Shooting in every direction
Shooting stars inside our heads
Shooting before you see the whites of their eyes
I bet you never thought you'd see me dead no
I'm turning into a monster
I'll turn the heat up high
I'll turn away from this mess I'm burning
The smell of skin on fire
I'm turning into a monster
I'll turn the heat up high
I'll turn away from this mess I'm burning
The smell of skin on fire
I'm turning into a monster yeah
Shooting in every direction
Shooting stars inside our heads
Shooting before you see the whites of their eyes
I bet you never thought you'd see me dead no
I'm turning into a monster
I'll turn the heat up high
I'll turn away from this mess I'm burning
The smell of skin on fire
I'm turning into a monster
I'll turn the heat up high
I'll turn away from this mess I'm burning
The smell of skin on fire
I'm turning into a monster yeah
A monsterMaster, we extol you, your name we're lifting high
In your hands you've got everything
When the final battle's won everyone shall see
That our almighty Lord JESUS CHRIST is king
Darkness tries to make me fall because of my sinful flesh
Lord, come with your power, come in holiness
You who made demons flee when they saw your might
You who left your glory in the palaces of light
Where darkness cannot reach there will my soul be free
Where only light remains is the final place for me
Thy holy angels are serving you, GOD, and so will I
Lord of Lords, you let your blood run for all our sins
Then you rose and triumphed over death
When you conquered darkness and set the captives free
Master, I worship you, I fall down on my kneesThrough sin and self-destruction I stumble home, never alone!
My only home is the bottom of a bottle and a rolled up bill and im ready to go!
I live the same day in and out and I don't care how long I last!
All the girls and drinks and drugs but dont get me wrong Im having a fucking blast.
I am rock and roll, living a life you can only dream of,
I am rock and roll at its fucking finest
Just like the cigarettes hurt,
Just like the whiskey burns, wohoa wohoa
I guess im never gonna learn (x2)
Not gonna stop until my heart stops beating
Not gonna sttop untill my last breathe comes,
Im gonna go until I hit the floor
Cant find a way back to my feet
Anymooorreeee
Pass me a glass and lets destroy everything in this fucking place life at three hundred miles an hour you pussys cant keep up with this fucking pace
I am rock and roll, living a life we can only dream of,
I am rock and roll at its fucking finest
Just like the cigarettes hurt,
Just like the whiskey burns, wohoa wohoa
I guess im never gonna learn (x2)
Ive drunk the last time you stood here, your by my side, --> forgot the text, but i know it's different from whats here =), studied the booklet i got from AA
You thought that it should be just like the good old days of rock and roll --> same here
(ive spent the last few years tearing down my soul)
Without a drink, without regret without a second thought
You hit the nail on the head with the back of your fucking throat
I am rock and roll living a life we can only dream of
I am rock and roll at its fucking finest
[End]Wrestling the days since the staff crept away,
Sorta sleeping awake and just waiting, waiting,
I'm just going to wait 'til they say it's okay to ring that bell again.
You see, hook line and sinker, I'm in for the ride,
Got my eye on the prize and I know if I show that I'm willing to try to do it their way - I know what you'd say, you'd say I threw the family under the bus as if I hoped it would Crush us like I don't care. I do care, I swore and I swear,
I was thinking of you, always did and I do
I just see things so different, I just had to try
Like the market's middle child, we're not winning or losing, it's such sweet denial.
Up to the chin, but if we just buy in, we could thrive in the gutters and out on the towns and we're doubling down 'cause we're dying of boredom, there's nothing to do.
See if you hate the man, the man hates you too
Don't you think I have moments? Sure, I'd love to take charge.
'Cause we all see the farce, but we don't mention, mention the castle of cards.
And what's there to say? Let them eat cake?Like the screaming eagle
I'm on the run
I blaze through the sky
I kill for the fun
No reason, no warning
Nor shadow be found
Got you in my sights
And I'll shoot you down
Jet fighter, jet fighter
Turbo jet engines ignite
Jet fighter, jet fighter
Death will be filling the sky
Jet fighter, jet fighter
An airborne assault and attack
Jet fighter, jet fighter
A cold blooded stab in the back
Vengeance is calling on you
And there's nothing that you can do
Brings you the thing you deserve
Death from above
Chains of oppression
Will break with my teeth
The false reputation
Will die at your feet
So ruthless ambitions
To have no remorse
You looked at the soul
Tied by the soul
Jet fighter, jet fighter
Turbo jet engines ignite
Jet fighter, jet fighter
Death will be filling the sky
Jet fighter, jet fighter
An airborne assault and attack
Jet fighter, jet fighter
A cold blooded stab in the back
Vengeance is calling on you
And there's nothing that you can do
Brings you the thing you deserve
Death from above
Jet fighter, jet fighter
Turbo jet engines ignite
Jet fighter, jet fighter
Death will be filling the sky
Jet fighter, jet fighter
An airborne assault and attack
Jet fighter, jet fighter
A cold blooded stab in the back
Vengeance is calling on you
There's nothing that you can do
Brings you the thing you deserve
Death from aboveLyrics by Grutle Kjellson 1996
A war ruled in ancient times
Between the holy races, the vanirs and the Ases
When peace came, the deities united
>From a bowl filled with spit rose Kvasir
"Wise he becomes, he drinks the holy mead,
the blood of Kvasir, but not he who drinks
from the spilled mead that dripped
from the falcon"
Kvasir the father of poets
by dwarfhands he died
>From the blood of Kvasir they made the meads of poets, the
holy drink
Fjalar and Galar once murdered Gilling the Giant, the father
of Suttung
Enraged, Suttung demanded justice to be fulfilled
The blood of Kvasir became the mead of Suttung
Grimne flew out from Valhalla
In the shape of the falcon
To the Home of Giants and to Nitberg
Bauge was deceived, and Gunnlod betrayed
Out from Nitberg the falcon flew
Finally Kvasir should return to Asgard
But, when the mead disappeared, Suttung became furious
Out, in the shape of the eagle he followed
Sadly, Grimne had to spill from his valuable treasure
Which led to the making of the false poets
The falcon flew home to his domains
And Sutting flew into the flames of Tjalve
Music by Ivar Bjrnson & Grutle Kjellson 1996Justice System. Is there justice in the system? Or is it just us in the system?
The love to drag your ass to court. This is the areana for their sick sport. They run for office and make more laws. 100,000 reasons to futher their cause. We get charged, we better watch out. A system of fear, what they make out. Either way it goes - good or bad. The attorneys get paid and they get fat. Is there justice in a world gone crazy? Where it's survival of the fat and lazy? The less you've got they've got you on your knees. You'll cop please, they get fees....
It's all such a web of lies. Attorneys are the spiders and we are the flies.
One to prosecute, one to defend. One to judge you, and in the end, 12 of your peers are forced to sit in. As lawyers lie, so they can win. Either way, they get paid. We are the ictims with the laws they've made. They'll take your freedom, and then your home. They'll take it all, 'til you're all alone. Break up a family for a fee. I can't remember when I was free. Free to worship, free to speak. They never practice what they preach.
It's all such a web of lies. Attorneys are the spiders and we are the flies.
A country of laws and lawyers make them. Arm the police and they defend them. Books full of lies, but we don't believe them. Their jobs are secure, the long arms of the law.
It's all such a web of lies. Attorneys are the spiders and we are the flies.Instinct, survival-ism.
One against all, against one.
The living now envy those who perished in ruins.
The brutal live on in competition.
Death's masterpiece nears its completion.
Left in the aftermath.
World War Four, survival-ism.
One against all, against one.
The living now envy.
Those who... those who perished.
Adapt to the harshness or become one with the dust.
You adapt to the harshness.
Adapt to the harshness or you'll become one with the dust.
Adapt to the harshness or you'll become one with the dust.
Adapt to the harshness or become one with the dust.
Adapt to the harshness or become one against all.
Armies of the world clashed against each other as it had been prophesied.
Severed heads, adorned pikes stark against the barren land.
The horror of all horrors when the warheads detonate.
Will this be mankind's fate brought by hi-tech
barbarians.
The law of lead now reigns...Regret
Betray
Turn your back
Walk away
Forget me
Betray
And now you're filled with shame
We shared our lives
Our friendship stains
What's left for us?
A life's worth of pain
Regret
Tattooed on your fingertips
You'll never escape this
Regret
The weight upon your fingertips
Everything is meaningless
You set yourself up for one more day
A day of suffering alone in shame.I don't know why blood makes people rush,
Violence is a power you' ve denied so much
We're all the same...
I do know why drugs make people rush,
The meaning of life discovered in a secondary state
We're all the same we're living down
The vicious, boiling, shouting crowd
We're coming from underground
Living down, we're the proud people apart...but
Mind, your own against, once again my own
Mind, your own against, once again my own
I do know why war makes people rush,
Destruction is a power we release so much !
We're all the same we're living down
The vicious, boiling, shouting crowd
We're coming from underground
Living down, we're the proud people apart...but
Mind, your own against, once again my own
Mind, your own against, once again my own
Rush !Hail victim, raise your voice and curse this mortal chain
Lay down your tired albatross
Let Heaven hear your strain
This unrelenting plaque unbound, your agonizing toll
Like God Himself in parallel
Delusion takes you hold
Recoil
I see you writhe in distress
Hell on earth
No one ever stood for pain like this
Sing to me your plight unjust
Define it for the rest of us
No river of your tears, no sympathy will find you here
Not one of you bastards has a cross to bear
You clench your fist unto the sky to sound your troubled mind
Unto the throne of sorrow's scribe, of sacrifice divine
Bite your tongue
Bleed unsungWho knew you'd be hated for being who you are
And be a big target for all the insecure
All alone in a wall-less prison
Didn't forget and you're not forgiven
Live every day with the pain in the back of my mind
Torture doesn't begin to describe it
I won't forget, I won't forgive, I won't forget
Who knew you'd be hated for being who you are
And be a big target for all the insecure
There's a bullseye painted on our chests
In the crosshairs of the ignorant
But I am not your scapegoat anymore
All alone with my own decisions
I try to scream but you never will listen
It took a while but you're finally out of my life
And I swear there's no better feeling
I won't forget, I won't forgive, I won't forget
Who knew you'd be hated for being who you are
And be a big target for all the insecure
There's a bullseye painted on our chests
In the crosshairs of the ignorant
But I am not your scapegoat anymore
Try to scream but you never will listen
Didn't forget and you're not forgiven
You're not forgiven
Didn't forget and you're not forgiven, no
Who knew you'd be hated for being who you are
And be a big target for all the insecure
Who knew you'd be hated for being who you are
And be a big target for all the insecure
There's a bullseye painted on our chests
In the crosshairs of the ignorant
But I am not your scapegoat anymoreMirror, mirror, on the wall. Look at me, I can see it all. I went off, niggas turned soft, view from a coffin. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I lost my train of thought. Always on the E.T.A.C. and never on the defense. Defend yourself, motherfucker. It never used to be easy, but now it's falling into place. What never came around, now is coming my way. Straight up, straight from the streets and no fakin', I'm aching, what I see I'm taking. No time for napping, I don't believe in miracles, I'm making my shit happen. Damned if I do, damned if I don't. Hold me and lie to me, and tell me it will be ok. I won't hesitate to put a sucker on his fuckin' back. Peace to all the peeps who represent. The few that keep it true, we won't forget. It's time for some mother fuckin' action.To the other side of known world
To the places where time doesn't exist
You see all of it, you have seen nothing
All is too much to understand
Only the higher minds so blackened and ill
Can travel beyond his thoughts
In the tower of damned darkness
The Lord of chaos, the witch of the eye
Holding the keys into the shadows
Watching over green lands
Learning the ways of goodness
To prevent those shades of light
Light and its people in Arda
Weak fools, enemy forever
Enemy forever!
Gates of shadow, doors for demons
Demons of nether and void
Infernal landscapes and abyssic essence
Insane to the mind of a man
The world of unknown, enchanted domain
Fields of nightmare and fear
Like haunted dreams, darken realms
Homeland for the demonic beingsSator Arepo Tenet Opera Rotas, the inner becomes the outer
In my nekromanteion I summoned a son of smokeless fire.

The rebis transmutates into azoth, the pull of Ahriman is overcome

In the psychotronic model of reality telluric power is valid.
Harness it, treasure it, in a hypnagogic state of mind.
Trapped in the space-time continuum,
Nympholeptic for the numinous.You need to know exactly what you have done.
These lights, they will change nothing at all.
It still stands in the recesses of your heart.
(Girls, can we?)
And now I sit here questioning everything.
The sweat from your legs reminds me of old toys.
Now all I need is to be beside her.
(Girls, can we?)
Toys, dolls, models, whores.Georgie che corre felice sul prato
Nel suo bel mondo che pare fatato
E poi d'incanto non Ã¨ piu bambina

Tell how war appeared on earth
Musicians with gongs
Permeate the autobahns
Foetus of disgusting breath
And she split the egg
Cast a spell and war was born
Come follow me
Out of the obscurity
Pilgrims in songs
Swamp the empty aerodrome
Kalashnikovs but no houses
Women at the double, march
No food for the spouses
They wait for the US drop
Russians sit back and laugh
While war casts her gory locks
Over the deserted docks
She casts her gory locks
Over the deserted docks
She cast a spell
Split an egg and war was born
And pillage hopes with gusto
Even though they have no nerve
And she does just look on
And war does what she has to
War does what she has to
People get what they deserve[Music: Dave Garcia]
[Lyrics: Sean Peck]
When you feel scared or problems arise you need someone to hypnotize he will look in your mind
Instant induction a visual spash merging of emotions done so fast
Addictions in rewind.
He'll mentally molest you
Professionally trained
His evil will infest you.
Psychotically deranged
With an impression he'll make you sing neural linguistic programming
Who knows what he will find
Best to make sure nothing goes wrong
His power of suggestion is so strong
Your will he'll try to bind.
He'll mentally molest you
Professionally trained
His evil will infest you.
Psychotically deranged
He'll destroy your mental wall through hypnosis hear his call.
Hear his call
Hear his call.
Telling your future by reading your past
Past life regression removing yor mask
Feeding the frenzy that swarms in your head
What you're revealing is best left unsaid.
I'll snap my fingers then you'll awake
Your problems will linger
Your money I'll take.
So soothing the voice so bank are the eyes
It's all designed to mesmerize
Relax try to unwind
He's taking control he just won't let go
Done in such a way that you'll never know
You've got such little time
He'll mentally molest you
Professionally trained
His evil will infest you.
Psychotically deranged
Your true protector is your unconscious mindCold obscurity falls on me
Into my soul the winter to return
Whips of the storm shivered i hear
I waited for you, but you didn't come
Monotomy of misterious stars
Hit a nail to the coffin of dusk
My soul has crashed down under the beats
Just the loneliness gives shelter to me
A not happened embrace, a not happened kiss
One face what charms me in the dark
My knees hit the floor, it was a moment only
I'm sleeping, i will wake up somewhere else
I can't smell the scent anymore
That her skin breathed above silk pillows
[Chorus:]
I hate, when i feel
That the world
Turns its back on me...
And just the loneliness
Gives shelter to me!
I feel that the wild burning desire
Is calmed by the steps of happines
The bright, shinning, rising sun is nice to me
When the first ray comes and rests by my side
Bride of darkness stood before me
Between walls and doubts
[Chorus:]
I hate, when i feel
That the world
Turns its back on me...
And just the loneliness
Gives shelter to me!Take a look now to what you've created
We're the sons of your Madness and Pride
Evolution cannot be sedated
We're the Next Generation of men
[Bridge:]
We're hunters and you're preys
You won't escape
[Chorus:]
No feelings
We're perfect
We're deadly war machines
You better
Surrender
Our force... It is too big
We got claws like the deadliest predators
Our senses are sharper than yours
First of all we have killed our creators
Like the Titans were killed by the Gods
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
You're no match for the Ultimate Soldiers
It's our time to be rulin' the world
We will laugh while your bodies get colder
We're the Next Generation of men
[Bridge]
[Chorus]If you search for enrichment
And injure others
Earning more than you can spend
You'll pass the borders
When you think you've succeeded
But something's missing
Means you have been defeated
By greed, your weakness
This fantasy is not enough for me
I want it, I'll take it away from you
Your misery that softly incites me
All I do is using, abusing you
Life is often miserable
In the search for happiness
The power so desirable
They bring so much distress
Life is often pitiful
In the search for blessedness
If we weren't so insatiable
There would be much more than less
When you think you've succeeded
But something's missing
Means you have been defeated
By greed, your weakness
If you search for enrichment
And injure others
Earning more than you can spend
You'll pass the borders
I cannot see why you'd be another me
When you think you've succeeded
But something's missing
Means you have been defeated
By greed, your weakness
I just take care of myself and no-one else
This fantasy is not enough for me
I want it, I'll take it away from you
Your misery that softly incites me
All I do is using, abusing you
Life is often cynical
In the search for hopefulness
We're only wanting more and more,
So we got into this mess
When you think you've succeeded
But something's missing
Means you have been defeated
By greed, your weakness
If you search for enrichment
And injure others
Earning more than you can spend
You'll pass the borders
I cannot see why you'd be another me
When you think you've succeeded
But something's missing
Means you have been defeated
By greed, your weakness
I just take care of myself and no-one else
All that you've taken from others
Will be taken from you
All that your dissonance smothers
Will then come back to you
Whatever happens tomorrow, and whatever you do
Just keep in mind, that the source and end is you
When you think you've succeeded
But something's missing
Means you have been defeated
By greed, your weakness
If you search for enrichment
And injure others
Earning more than you can spend
You'll pass the borders
I cannot see why you'd be another me
When you think you've succeeded
But something's missing
Means you have been defeated
By greed, your weakness
I just take care of myself and no-one else
This fantasy is not enough for me
I want it, I'll take it away from you
Your misery that softly incites me
All I do is using, abusing you
Never finding fulfilment, the source and end is youGive us our bread and bury our dead
And kneel to the cross on the wall
Whether burnt at the stake or drunk at the wake
Just kneel to the cross on the wall
We've original sin, but we might just get in
If we beg to the cross on the wall
It's love your neighbour and rattle your sabre
But kneel to that cross on the wall.
See the roof fall, hear the bells crash
As flesh and bone turns to ash
Tried to conquer the sun with a Christian frost
The corpses' stench beneath the cross
And give them gold and they'll save your soul
And kneel to the cross on the wall
And hail to the boss of the great unwashed
And kneel to the cross on the wall
They wail and weep, the march of the sheep
As they go to the cross on the wall
And it's ever so wrong to dare to be strong
So kneel to the cross on the wall
See the roof fall, hear the bells crash
As flesh and bone turns to ash
Tried to conquer the sun, with a Christian frost
The corpses' stench beneath the cross.
And it's ever so wrong to dare, to be strong
And it's ever so wrong to dare, to be strong
But summer is a-coming and arise! Arise!
But summer is a-coming and arise! Arise!Wake up, do you realize who you are?
Breath of the blinding stars
I, constant developing
Thirsty for everything
Listen, this more than I
Hear with mind, don't fear the change of self inside
The process, inflaming the fevers of the tongue
Obstacles in the back, to the side, to the front
Birth of a new positive
Overcome the ways of the negative
In depth commitments that will improve
The way to live
This being one of many, assemble the pieces of the puzzle
Intently, no envy, criticize, condemn
And complain the triple negatives, double sedatives
Examine the faults of self, it's imperative
Admit when wrong, the sense of character is raised
The road is long, it will save you from disgrace
Is your truth in season? I ask for obvious reasons
Confidence runs high, reconstructing the binds
Creator of your environment
Architect mapping out the blueprints defined
Stay, these facts do not drift away
The work in progress charm protects you from decay
Splinter, the winter touch reacts
The cold chill cracks, negative self detach
The lives are the same, 'cause the ways are the same
'Cause the lies are the same, 'cause the acts are the same
Are your arms getting tired
From holding a grudge expired?
Releasing the fires, dissolving bonds
That were once made of concrete
Look up, look up at the victimized
Running to their death
Process of development inside
How many here can withstand to remain?
No gain without pain, withstand it all sustain
How much time have you wasted
From previous times before crumbling pieces
That shatter to the core, that shatter to the core
Kings of nothing, placements worth escaping
Away from this, away from this, away from this decline
Suffocated deprived, eliminate disguise
Explosive undertones paralyze(Instrumental)E de repente se viu
Um mundo novo
Aquele que no esperava
Mas a vida interviu
E me mostrou aquele olhar de entardecer
Ao Sol de meio dia
E de repente sentiu
Mais uma vez aquela brisa morna
Quem diria
Que o sorriso que abriu
Viria mais uma vez a luz do dia
Quem diria
Olhou pro cu
Estendeu as mos
E agradeceu por um novo dia
Em tanto tempo sem o Sol raiar
Olhou pra ela
Estendeu as mos
E disse tudo que queria
Assim meio sem pensar
Abre as portas do seu corao
Que eu quero entrar
E de repente bateu
Alguma luz naquele quarto escuro
Onde ele guardava o amor
E de repente entendeu
Que nada por acaso e se aventurou
Quem diria
Que aquele que j no mais via
O horizonte alm do olhar
Voltaria a acreditar
E de fato haveria
Um bom lugar pra repousar
E alegria tambm repousa l
Olhou pro cu
Estendeu as mos
E agradeceu por um novo dia
Em tanto tempo sem o Sol raiar
Olhou pra ela
Estendeu as mos
E disse tudo o que jamais diria
Assim meio sem pensar
Abre as portas do seu corao
Que eu quero entrarWho would have thought that 5 years later, I'd be back at it again
Starting right where I left off, from when I was just a kid
This is where I got my start, and where my life began to change
Now that I'm back in this business I'll make sure you remember my name
I knew where I was going, just didn't know it would be this far
Life is strange, you never know when it will take that turn
Life is strange, you better be ready for anything
I made the best out of every situation, never let the odds stack against me
I did what ever I had to make this happen for me and my family
And I'll never take it back
So give me your best shot
And make sure you don't miss it
The road to the top is all part of burning bridges
This band has come so far, and we've barely scratched the surface
We are here to stay and haven't even started
Who would have thought that 5 years later, I'd be back at it again
Starting right where I left off, from when I was just a kid
This is where I got my start, and where my life began to change
Now that I'm back in this business I'll make sure you remember
That I made the best out of every situation, never let the odds stack against me
I did what ever I had to make this happen for me and my familylook at me, I am the crippled now
could you ever hold me again?
Did you ever look and see what I was
Ever was I known when I was true?
And if this is all I am
Then peace becomes my rotten soul
They split themselves apart
And chase away those adored
they leave behind the binding hope
they chose to fight, in fear of this
I hear a million cries
pleas: only _to be heard_
I see a million smiles
pasted on faces of pain
they are scaling worlds
oblivious to their own
all for fear of being hurt
all for fear of being known
all on their own
never asking on
they fall
martyrs for liesThe Public wants what the public gets.
Lazarus himself wouldn't rise into this world.
Decry relativity damned petulant for seeing through a
Trojan horse full of zyklon while Judas' coffers overflow.
What? New world disorder is nothing new.
Choking on poison air pouring whiskey into
Crescent moon lacerations.
Time to bite the hand that beats.
Teach our
Children well, teach them to kill.
Global jihad for a thousand years.
Sanctified our blood spills, sutured with commodities.
Iron fist in silken
Glove ripping away autonomy,
Replacing with a placebo.
Realize that our wounds will never heal while Judas' coffers overflow.I know I'll never be free
Change doesn't come easy
And if I'll never be free
You'll live in hell with me
Me
Fear
A Contradiction
Co-exist as darkness brought to life
My own skin don't seem to fit me right
Pain is my way of self-expression
A Fatal choice that always hangs above
Love what I kill Kill what I love
I run you run you stop and then you take it
I run you run you stop and then you get it
I run you run you stop and then you take it
I run you run you stop and then you get it from me
The one whose giant steps ahead of where you've been
What you don't see
I know I'll never save myself
Dying from this immortality
[Chorus]
This is not an exit
I can't never change it
This is not an exit
There's now way out
Add a touch of
Who'd thought humanity's a dream
Things are not what they seem
Hungry for you but not to hurt you
Hunger for the secret of your life
I'm a timeless clock
And you kill time
I run you run you stop and then you take it
I run you run you stop and then you get it
I run you run you stop and then you take it
I run you run you stop and then you get it from me
[Chorus]
I know I'll never be free
Change doesn't come easy
And if I'll never be free
You'll live in hell with me
This is not an exit
I can't ever change it
You stop and then you take it
I stop but I can't fake it
Cause this is not an exit
Pain is my way of self-expression
A fatal choice hangs above
Love what I kill kill what I love
Love
This is not an exit
I can't ever change it
Cause this is not an exit
Hand over fist come and taste my dark trick
Hand over fist I'll kill you when I give it
This is not an exit
I can't ever change it
Cause this is not an exit
Be dangerous and unpredictable
And make a lot of noiseif your eyes could cry their color, i would save a tear to paint my most precious dreams. like fading stars falling in front of me, your selfish pride kills me inside. if your asking me to forget, i wont let you. i need this. i need you. all because your lying lips wanted to know, what it would be like to watch my heart fall apart in your kiss. promises provoke lies. (i need this. i need you. if youre asking me to forget. i wont let you, im so lost in this. you own me. you owe me more memories. you think im over this?) i could never be that strong. white lies are still lies. white lies are still lies. you live, loving my pain. ive tried to forget, how your kiss stained my lips. (and i will always remember the way each petal ends. as i fall to the floor and your arms aren't there to catch me. for the last time) i promise to forget for as long as you can hold your breath. i need you. i hate you. why wont you fucking die? this will never end. ( you finally taught me how to love. by hating everything but yourself. you told me that every tear should make me stronger, but they just bring me closer to nothing, and no one. never again will i be afraid to be alone, because being alone is better that dying for you.) never again will i be afraid of being being alone, because being alone is better than dying for you.[Instrumental]Through all the black days
Why can't you hear
That sadness surrounds us?
And so hard I tried
To face the real things in life
I can't see how
I failed to fly
How I failed to fly
Black days they scream
And it hears our lies
It feels so unreal
To face our fears
When I am lost
I run away
So deep in my mind
To cry out in fear
When I am lost
I run away so deep in my mind
To cry out of fear
Faced by reality's screams
So hard, so cruel
Black days they scream
And it hears our lies
It feels so unreal
To face our fears
Through all the black days
Why can't you hear
That sadness surrounds us?The Devil's own
Why!?
Where did I go wrong? Who was I supposed to be?
No matter what I've done, you've always criticized me
Where did I go wrong? Who was I supposed to be?
When it's said and done, will you remember
Slap on the wrist, smack in the face
The family trade, gave me a name and nothing more
Neglected seed, why!?
It's because of you I'm broken
It's because of you I'm dead inside
I never asked to be here
It's because of you I'm godforsaken
I never wanted this
It's because of you I'm dead inside
Where did I go wrong? Who was I supposed to be?
No matter what I've done, you've always criticized me
What did I do wrong? Who was I supposed to be?
When it's said and done, will you remember me?
A happy home, a fairy tale, a broken dream
Gave me a life, then turned away
Killed everything, why!?
It's because of you I'm broken
It's because of you I'm dead inside
I never asked to be here
It's because of you I'm godforsaken
I never wanted this
It's because of you I'm dead inside
Fuck!
Father, bastard, I'm the Devil's very own
Mother, know not, just who I've become
Father, hate me, for being all your not
Mother's baby, I hate what I've become
I hate what I've become
I hate what I've become
It's because of you I'm broken
It's because of you I'm dead inside
Where did I go wrong? Who was I supposed to be?
No matter what I've done, you've always criticized me
What did I do wrong? What was I supposed to be?
When it's said and done, will you remember me?Ayashiku sasu kasuka na tsuki no akari wa

Rage of the universe
Cold steel and bloodshed
In the lost barren wasteland
Fear rising higher,
Rage of the winter war
Death calls at night fall,
Our hatred still burns as
We march through endless skies
Mankind will fall, death will arise
[Chorus]
For a lifetime we fight without reason,
Still we wait for the warriors return
Though we're cast out and broken, we still carry on
Alone in a lost fallen world
Woah yeah!
Flames burning higher,
Curse of the winter land,
Black, torn, and twisted
In the fast-fading twilight
Storm winds still blowing
Steel shapes our destiny,
Death calls at night fall
Our curse with be lifted
Disguise this timeless crime
Brave men will fall, evil will rise!
[Chorus]
Still heroes we're born with promises so blind
The light at the end of the road that we all must climb (climb)
For a lifetime we fight without reason
Still we wait for the warriors return
Though we're cast out and broken we still carry on
Alone in a lost fallen world
Alone in a lost fallen world
Woah yeah!Did you see the firmament
The heaven is on fire
The devil laughs, knowing it's achieved
All the good is gone
In the garment of his mind
He takes them from the world
Now the Evil will arise
And grasps all power on earth
Defenceless angels are falling
From the dark sky in flames
God's tears, they ooze away
Like holy blood in the desert sand
WHEN THE SAND DARKENS THE SUN
THE LAST HOUR STRIKES FOR THEM ALL
WHEN THE SAND DARKENS THE SUN
THE POWER OF THEIR GOLD WILL DIE
Eternal darkness seized the spirit
The hatred banished their thoughts
So blind fury rages all over
The yell raised the holy force
An eye for an eye, ashes to ashes
The evil sermon guards all over
So he sows hatred and force
And father death is set to work
Crosses stand towards heaven
And the sea is crimson red
The last flood rinses the human kind
And their golden palaces away
WHEN THE SAND DARKENS THE SUN
THE LAST HOUR STRIKES FOR THEM ALL
WHEN THE SAND DARKENS THE SUN
THE POWER OF THEIR GOLD WILL DIE
WHEN THE SAND DARKENS THE SUN
BLOOD WILL FLOW AND WE WILL DIE
WHEN THE SAND DARKENS THE SUN
THE LAST HOUR STRIKES FOR THEM ALLThe story's been told a million fold
Of an artist's search for fame
As the years go by
His soul cries out in vain
All in fun when all's been done
Can you bear the weight
The tears you cry
Will never change your fate
Lust for life
And hands that worked so clever
The sadness lasts forever
When the battles been lost a costly cost
Rotting in the grave
As the years go by
The world is left to blameI step with two hands open
And kick the man in front of me
Reminded of my father
When will you ever learn
I found you urinating
You found me interesting
Torn raw and feeling sickness
Permit my hypocrisy
Feel the thick curtain
While she sleeps
The stench of my breath pains you
But your just smelling yourself
My plate shows something rotten
I feel so right at home
Dress me in mothers clothing
To teach me how to fuck myself
Fracture my arm like you know
The abuse makes it feel right
Feel the thick curtain
While she sleepsThere's no more to be felt
No need to gasp for air
Floor of the bathroom has stopped to be
So cold and hard - so cold and hard
There's no more sound to be heard
The roome became gloomy
But I was still conscious in spite of
The silence and void - silence and void
Have no perception of shapes or forms
No concrete memory... no here and there
Only a knowledge of my being's all I have
There ain't nothing, no one, nowhere
Alone... alone
Time must end - nothing to help me
Endless pain and tormenting want
It started to dawn on me then
Initially too weak to notice
And too far away to get fully aware
Of light shining there
Struck by sudden hope
Light became brighter and brighter
And started to brust - started to brust
Frightened of thoughts
That will eat me up from inside
There's no escape, no way to erase
Nothingness, crushed from outside
Feel like dust that's lost in nowhere
Ashamed... ashamed
Time must end - nothing to help me
Endless pain and tormenting wantCome death, or dearling
the claws of the raven hold fast
Enticed and starving
a lustful revenge to the last
Unlight flood the seeker's eye
Come flame or false hope
gifted in spirit as I
Forced upon freedom
Let impulse nor stillness be spared
Fierce tidal tandrum
nourishing rapture withinOh my god
Oh my god
If only he knew
If only he knew
If only he knew about the world
Without the bullshit and the lies
We could've saved him
They could've saved me
But instead I'm here drowning in my own fucking mind
And I'll be damned if you're the death of me
Blood and ink stain the walls
Silently with bloodied knuckles, carry on
Hoping it's not too wrong
You said the nights were far too long
Honey, it's just the start of it
Oh my god
If he only knew
Oh my god
If only he knew if only he knew
If only he knew
Just stand up and scream the tainted clock is counting down
You gave in to me would you say the nights are far too long now?
Oh my god (oh my fucking god)
The tears that stain my cheek must me look weak
I wear them proudly, I wear them proud
Just stand up and scream the tainted clock is counting down
You gave in to me would you say the nights are far too long now?
Your knife my back
My gun your head
Your knife my back
My gun your head
You need a doctor baby you scared?
You need a doctor baby you scared?
You need a doctor baby you scared?
You need a doctor baby you scared, you scared
You scared, you?
You need a doctor baby you scared?
You need a doctor baby you scared?
You need a doctor baby
You need a doctor baby you scared?I am one with Satan.
I am the horned beast.
I am thy mighty emperor.
Ruler of the dark domain.
My body is a temple.
Wherein all demons dwell.
A pantheon of flesh am I.
Am I.
Hail me the horned one I am the beast.
I am the truth.
I am everything.
Wherever life is born. I am the flame.
Wherever death will strike.
I am the knife. wherever evil dwells.
I am the one behind.
In front of the ineffable king of darkness.
You shall die!
I am one with Satan.
I am the horned beast.
I am thy mighty emperor, ruler of the dark domain.
My body is a temple.
Wherein all demons dwell a pantheon of flesh am I.
Hail me the horned one I am the beast.
Rege satanas, ave satanas, hail Satan!
Rege satanas, ave satanas, hail Satan!Hiding in the darkness, sheltered from the rain
My mom and dad are gone now, I'm alone again
Is anybody out there? does anybody care?
I don't want to live here anymore, I don't want to live
See the people suffering, watch the children die
Doesn't it make you wonder why?
Money and power, the television's red
One by one, they collect the dead
Hell is a war, hell, what is it for?
They'll slay the innocent and every mothers son
To get the ethnic cleansing done
Hey Mr.Politician, what are you gonna do?
This nightmare's up to you
Stopping for nothing, I fire at will
In the name of my religion I shoot to kill
To kill
Hell is a warFuck this!
Cross my heart I hope you die
Left by the road side
Karma's a bitch, right?
Cross my heart I hope you die
Left by the road side
Karma's a bitch, right?I could scream the words. You'd never hear anything I say. See the sweat drip from your head. I see right through your nervous smile. I see through you now. You don't wanna hear. Because you've known this all the while. Keep it in the dark. You've known this all the while.
Well I've seen it before. But I never really noticed till now. I know something's twisted.
And I could never quite understand why. I see through you now. You always knew the words. Will you ever understand?Tell me, tell me, tell me, it's not over
Tell me, tell me, tell me, I'm not afraid
Tell me, cause your skin is turning inside out
Tell me, tell me, tell me, it's not the same
Tell me!
Tell me, tell me, tell me, your condition
Tell me were you losin' from the start?
And did I allude you, did I use you?
Been kicked until your heart beats black and blue, blue, blue!
Well, I tried, to wait
You suffer, while I hesitate
Yes I, you know, before you leave me
Tell me!
Tell me!
Now, you still love me
Love me, yeah, tell me!
Tell me!
Now!
You still love me!
Want me, gotta know right now!
Yeah!
Gotta know right now!
Tell me, cause I know you've all been waiting
Tell me that your sacrifice is true
Your livin' hard, you're feelin' scarred
You're suffocating
But deep inside, your heart beats black and blue, blue, blue!
Well I tried, to wait
You suffer while I hesitate
Yes, I, ?you may?
Before you leave me
Because, I wait all day
Save your sacrificial games for later
Before you leave me, tell me!
Tell me!
Now!
Do you still love me?
Love me? Yeah!
Tell me! Tell me now!
You still love me? Want me? Yeah, tell me!
Tell me right now!
You still love me? Love me? Yeah, tell me!
Tell me right now! You still love me?
You want me, gotta know right now!
Because I'm waitin, got you waitin'!
Got you waitin'!
For you to see
Right now!Welcome to my realm
We are both condemned to live
It's a dark fate
(I can hear your calls
I can hear your calls)
The eternal life
I see it still burns
Each night I cry in pain
Alive
Though the end appears my friend
And blood tears I cry
You've searched and you've found
Cut off your old friends hand
My mind's
In frozen dreams
The rotten flesh
Of bitter lies
Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one ever will
Can't hold it
It burns
Each night I cry in pain
And blood tears I cry
Endless grief remained inside
And blood tears I cry
Endless grief remained inside
It seems so clearly
Bent the bow
Cause life in me is gone
And a cruel wind's blowing cold
And a cruel wind's blowing cold
In blame
And life it shall wane
Each night I cry in pain
And blood tears I cry
Endless grief remained inside
Cut off your old friends handUpon shallow graves
The sisters (are) dancing
Upon the bones of seven dead
Through raven's eyes
The ghosts are watching
Through a realm of pain
They slowly move
Seven daggers buried deep
The seven sisters never sleep
On this night of the scarecrow
The blood-moon shines
Seven corpses never found
The masque of the dead
They wear tonight
The seven sisters with raven's eyes
For the angel - the Scarecrow - The broken one
Whose wings are but shadows in the setting sun
The unhallowed sisters dance tonight
Kissed by the devil in the pale moon lightWe get together once a week
To bare our souls in my back seat
She makes me wear my heart on my sleeve
She cried a bit, I act the fool
We reminisce about high school
I ask her why she didn't choose me
And she said, Help me get outta here
The walls are closing in
I wanna be gone before he comes back again
Help me get outta here
I need to get outta here
Before I do something crazy
She wears makeup to hide the scars
Got bruises up and down her arms
And the coward's name tattooed on her wrist
She says that she's afraid to leave
She says someday he's gonna kill me
'Cause when he's drunk he talks with his fists
She said, Help me get outta here
The walls are closing in
I wanna be gone before
He comes back again
Help me get outta here
I need to get outta here
Before I do something crazy
And you've suffered for much too long
Baby he can't get to you
Through my arms
I may not be your personal Christ
But you don't have pray in vain
'Cause I'll be by your side
I'll help you get outta here
If the walls are closing in
But we better be gone before
He comes back again
I'll help you get outta here
We better get outta here
Before I do something crazy
Something crazy
I do something crazyWithuot a shape What I yesterday knew is oblivious. Reality the fantasy the truth a lie covered by thoughts betray what they see. What was part of me that...has it changed? Or do I perceive it diferent. Ashes reign where the fire was ruins of the reminds. Without ashes never a fire there was what burns is consumed in yesterdays mouth Day after day, a new character after the same question. The eternal quest: Only one light...without its lost Shadow. Day after day, a new scene of hate a dream or nightmare without a sense forever onwards to the unreasonable universe!!! Time Time passes by on the trail of maya Diferent becomes what does not change Without reminds everything is new The eyes without a past Time passes by on the trail of maya In our subconcious.... Raped is the pure. Uncertain our fate. Painfull weakness. that limits us of our power The reason the hunter has hunted himself forever irony.... Utopia! Without ashes never a fire there was what burns is consumed in yesterdays mouth where it casts into oblivion. Forever the same it will be never knowing what the truth is if there shall exist one that can make it through the time and stay forever in my mind!!! Without a shape What I yesterday knew is oblivious. Reality the fantasy the truth a lie covered by thoughts betray what they see Time Time passes by on the trail of maya Diferent becomes what does not change Without reminds everything is new The eyes without a past Time passes by on the trail of maya In our subconcious.... All you have seen, tasted and heard... Or that you may listened or felt before. All you seeked and found is now useless cause you'll never find the path to The Mind's subconcious.Now that we don't pay much attention
To what goes up or must come down
We decided not to follow
Apart from that we just don't care
From a decent crowded journey
Into a private desert land
Up-to-the-minute reviewed autonomy
Proof of independent anonymity
When the highest point of individuality
Culminates in loneliness
We reject our identity
And declare all reflections to be wrong
We, as a team of soloists
Are so unlike that we are desolate
Do we get a kick out of it?
This is just organised limitation
[Bridge:]
Are we strong enough for our egos?
Is there room to give us space?
[Chorus:]
I am on my own
Because I sent everybody else away
No one knows how to take me
Without being told
You are on your own
Because you sent everybody else away
No one knows how to take you
Without being told
We can no longer differ from the mainstream
'Cause we're insisting on a distinct minority
When finally everybody's different
Will we be the same again?
With emancipation-labelled foreheads
We proudly present our disintegrity
No box seems shapeless enough
For us to fit inTonight will be the end of the world
something dreadful in the air.
The fury of nature runs out of control
with the destructive violence of death.
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
hell on Earth, fire in the sky.
A catastrophe of terrible violence!
A catastrophe of terrible violence!
Earth now opens in endless gulfs
volcanos expel boiling lava.
In the sky the lightning strikes
burning everything in its path.
A wind of death destroys the trees
as the world crumbles in a black abyss.
No! This cannot be all nature's work!
This can only be frightful Devil's rage!
The end of the world is coming now
man shall pay for all his sins.
The beast is rising from his deep hell
the eternal fire shall burn the Earth.
It's too late to repent now
This is the dawn of Armageddon's day!
Mankind can't escape from the Devil's rage!
Mankind can't escape from the Devil's rage!Take a look at who's standing before you,
How does it feel to know you shunned us from the start.
When we were begging for a chance to try,
You shook your head and acted like it was a joke.
Now what, you've got your hand out to give an offer that we can't refuse,
Well you must not know me well.
Eat shit, you're a hypocrite and I don't forget the past bitch,
You must be a brain dead fool.
Yeah, Don't forget your past, everyone can see through you.
Fame will never last, so let the new kings take the throne.
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got love for us, but what about last year?
I remember what you said behind our back
And you sweared to your god that we wouldn't do shit.
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got love for us, but what about last year?
I remember what you said behind our back
And you sweared to your god that we wouldn't do shit.
We are the new kings.
We are the new kings.
GO!
Look in the eyes of a king.
Hold that thought let me explain,
You're a double crossing liar, caught up crossfire started up a fuckin' fire
And I threw it right back,
Suck it.
You will never be forgiven, not as long as I'm here livin',
And I'm never going to forget just how you treated us like shit
Right when we needed help the most.
Yeah, don't forget your past.
Everyone can see through you, fame will never last,
So let the new kings take the throne.
You changed your fucking mind? Oh yeah? Well I don't forget, HAHAHAHA.
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got love for us, but what about last year?
I remember what you said behind our back
And you sweared to your god that we wouldn't do shit.
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got love for us, but what about last year?
I remember what you said behind our back
And you sweared to your god that we wouldn't do shit.
It's always like this, when people try to change their mind as if I would forget.
Well I don't forget.
I remember every time you put us down
And all the fucking reasons why you said we wouldn't go anywhere.
I don't forget!
I remember all the shit you talked behind our back
And all the lies you spread among the people that you call your friends.
I don't forget![Music: Dominic]
Sol has sunken behind the mountains
And the velvet curtain came falling
Daily world is put on hold and
The less of it we perceive
The brighter is the sight to beyond
Answer the firmament again
The wind plays the reeds
A signal for stellar voyagers
And like mist they will come
Waiting for a sign, back to see old friends
Appointed we are in carnation
Anointed into stellar civilians
Do you remember?
As a child you sometimes awoke in tears
With a sense of falling
And a familiarity to the stars
Thoughts pervade in looking for words
And stories start being told.
[Solos: Mat]Why do I explain myself when everyone's
An idiot but me
I think some people need
Killing for stupidity and I'll be born again
Kicking and screaming
And dragged back into a life
Like Ten pounds in a nine pound bag
Still I come back to give you something
That you never had.
Idiot rules
I never fight I only win
And I don't make em
I never bend I only break them
Finish my smoke, down my drink, wipe my mouth
And I just walk away
What's the chance of finding something
Real and make it last
For that I'd carry all my bags and leave
Them in the past
Because I spend my life fixing mistakes
That left me scarred
And when I stand and meet my maker
I'll be born again hard
Don't judge me by my sinsIn a moment of clarity
It all became crystal
And now I try to find someone to heal me
I'm broken
Through the mist in a dream where I show you
Through the rain and the dark that holds you
Heal me, I'm broken
Time to discover what lies hidden in the sand
Time for renewal and to be cleansed by the hand
To heal me relieve me
Heal me
Release me while I'm still breathing
And when it all came to clarity
There was no perfection
Dreams where shattered
Hope was washed away
Through the mist in a dream where I show you
Through the rain and the dark that holds you
Heal me, I'm broken10 times the power
10 times the pain
He rolls you over
And rape what remains
He exists in every town
He is all around
He stab you where it hurts
Up under your miniskirt
Something never never changes
Something never will
He loves the fire
He degrade
He deprive
He is the judge and jury
Of your miserable lifeHindered by sober restlessness.
Submitting to the amber crutch.
The theme in my aching prose.
Fantasizing the sight of Manhattan;
That pour of a bitter red being that escapes a thin frame.
The rebirth of mutual love.
The slipping on gloves to lay tenderly.
"I'm dying."
- "Is it blissful?"
"It's like a dream."
- "I want to dream."Step up to this! witness anger from this raised up fist. the
Hood is jacked up bad, and more pain will come to exist. well,
Whose fault is it, and who's to blame? well, I'm pointing my

Bring you closer to the fire
Choke the life from your eyes
As I inhale your dying breath
Who need enemies with friends like you
Your lies cut like broken glass
Another day you will suffer
For every knife stabbed in my back
I'd rip your eyes out
If you would only look away
Blind you like I've been
Escape where you can't see
Another day you will suffer
For every day stabbed in my back
Finally there will be justice
When everything you love comes crashing down
Salt the ground that you walk on
So nothing grows and everything dies
I will never beat peace
Till these hands tear you apart
Everyday I pull tighter
Bring you closer to the fire
Choke the life from your eyes
As I inhale your dying breath
I'd rip your eyes out
If you would only look away
Blind you like I've been
Escape where you can't see
Another day you will suffer
For every day stabbed in my back
Finally there will be justice
When everything you love comes crashing down
There will be no justice
Till everything you love comes crashing down
There will be no justice
Till everything you love comes crashing down
Choke as I inhale your dying breath
There will be no justice
Till everything you love comes crashing down
There will be no justice

I wasn't there anymore
the one who used to be so close
I wasn't strong anymore
like the eagles' wings on which you rode
I was gone so far
like the eagles' wings on which you flew
to experience life I guess
overhead flew the eagle and offered again to experience life
which disappears like sweat dried up on your face
my soul was looking for a change I guess,
wanting to be wings somewhere else
it felt into the trap of my reality
in self destruction
it wasn't made to be alone
in self destruction
it wanted to feel your love
my other side wanted to return but was scared
it wanted to feel your love
my soul was looking for a change but was scared
it wanted to feel your loveI clench my teeth and realize
My world is so near its demise
A dying sun in a poisonous sky
Stinging my eyes
Burning with contempt and conflict
As of now
I am a tool
Of severe impact
I clench my fist and visualize
The blood that is spilled is our own
I open wide my bloodshot eyes
Count the dead
A result of dysfunction
As of now
I am a tool
Of severe impact
Hammer down
Cause and effect
And create a new world
Pound, drive, swing, strike
Break down, smash down
Pound and drive, swing and strike
Break it down
I am a tool
As of now
I am a tool
Of severe impact
Hammer down
Cause and effect
And create a new world
I am a tool
I am a tool to break down
Break it down and smash it all awayTry to understand who I am
My pops is an intelligent black man
My mom's locked up in S I B I brand, damn
It's like they're handing me planned positional placement
Inheritance parents mistaken left my soul aching
Hurting painful let downs are burning fire inside
Fire inside's is what I got right
Unjustified lies, life died so I picked up a mic
Microphone the danger curse
This earth's done got them tears dripping
Lifetime of decline got me blind to the real sign
Running around helpless, selfish
Direction less spiritual savior get me flexin' that will to live
Horrifying, horrifying
Shot one, shot one
Tell them how your soul fell
Closet bigotry insecurity
I see from the ones closest to me
I see this disease
Complexion sways your mental direction
Privilege culture subliminal racist
Stereotypical walk and mythical lies must go
Prejudging human beings that you are seeing
Millions of 'Mark Fuhrmans' within my midst
But flesh does not determine what is withinI've been here for a period of time
So long that my brain has gone delirious inside
I think back on all the years that I've survived
Holding back the tears that keep appearing in my eyes
But now I'm yesterday's news
And I'm tomorrow's promise but I've got my mince pies
Open wide trying to visualize devils in disguise
Devz I'm like Picasso cause I've been through every shade of blue
I'm walking under rainy skies but the flame never died
It stayed alive cause I was made to ignite
Like dynamite I'm from the cold with heavy night
I'm riding tight notice flows slip and slide
Like a tire in the snow cause there ain't no grip on ice
I'm cold in the Moscow and it's minus 29
So welcome to my life, I've cleverly designed minds
Lost souls just trying to live the higher life
I've been here so long through the sadness and the blues
But it's funny how I'm still here,
With the government and yesterday's news
I've been here so long through the sadness and the blues
But it's funny how I'm still here,
With the government and yesterday's news
Devlin, I'm dangerous I'm dead guys
And every week forgotten like yesterday's headlines
I've been through the blues just like Elvis' best time
But I ain't wearing suede shoes, I've just got the best rhymes
I refuse to die, you could attempt to kill me twenty times
But I'll still rise like I'm the day walker Wesley Snipes
So let me stick my teeth into the game and bleed it dry
When I witness blood seeking through his veins
This has become apparent I've got a talent that these other rappers haven't
So what would be the point of bloody keeping it in chains
About my rhymes but when I'm talking about?
So cut the conversation cause I've been lower rating
Taking anything I'm pleasing taking off the aviation
To a better place in time better for leaving this place behind
I've been here so long, through the sadness and the blues
But it's funny how I'm still here,
With the government and yesterday's news
I've been here so long, through the sadness and the blues
But it's funny how I'm still here,
With the government and yesterday's news
I can't see no reason why I can't retain success
I just need a real good time away from all this stress
I can't see no reason why I can't retain success
I just need a real good time away from all this stress
I've been here so long, through the sadness and the blues
But it's funny how I'm still here,
With the government and yesterday's news
I've been here so long, through the sadness and the blues
But it's funny how I'm still here,
With the government and yesterday's newsgrind and click
the bomb goes off
with a grind and a click
no flick of the switch
but a knife to the wrist
blows my mind every timeHate me
I pull my hair by the fistful
Hate me
Spinning scissors like a pistol
You dare to say
That I'm forcefully insane
The truth remains
That you've kept me in a cage
Can't stop the beast in me
It's underneath my skin
Can't stop the beast in me
It's under my skin
Save
Save yourself
This is straight war
The writing's on the wall
Here comes a massacre now
Brace for the massacre
Run
Run and hide
They're keeping score
They're never coming home now
Here comes a massacre now
Brace for the massacre
No one's safe here
Run for cover, go!
Love me
They talk in pointed whispers
Love me
While my fingers on a trigger
You gave away
All the things that kept you vain
Your progeny
It becomes your enemy
Can't stop the beast in me
It's underneath my skin
Can't stop the beast in me
It's underneath my skin
Save
Save yourself
This is straight war
The writing's on the wall
Here comes a massacre now
Brace for the massacre
Run
Run and hide
They're keeping score
They're never coming home now
Here comes a massacre now
Brace for the massacre
No one's safe here

(Lyrics: Sundin)
Beautiful, oh web of stars
that looms amid the sons of Earth
Enfolds me in thine sylvan arms
that unity's vehement charms
befalls a weary son of Earth
Beautiful, in tears bereaved
in sylphlike sadness, left to bleed
Bewailed upon a bed of thorns,
impaled, a heart, on sorrow's horns
A seeker's ode to thee I read
My tearful soul thy mourning heed
The stream that leaves thine open wounds;
A life-blood licked by hungry hounds
No verdant balm to soothe our wounds
Wherefore betwixt two worlds I'm torn
Ere thralled by sin I'll die - forlorn
This slumbering world of shallow fools
may one day clasp the cosmic Hell
lest journeymen by Earthen rules
bring forth the truth for which Angels fell
To the earth and sky and sea
I call that thou may answer me;
Father of Nature, of beast and mankind,
my soul for thy love, my tears for thy pain
...An Eden in fire,
what lives shan't remain
For when I live under a different sky,
beneath the ethereal hills the clouds passing by
Remember the time of which I cried to be part
Remember these words, for they have flown
from my heart.[Words: W. Sssenbeck / Music: Bhm, Pichlbauer, Koritar]
SUFFERING THE DEMONS SLEEP
AND THE RAGE CONTROLS MY MIND
WE`RE SUPPOSED TO FACE THE END
SOMEONE IS TO TRY
AND MY EYES CAN SEE
CONTROLS A GLIMPSE OF MY MIND
IF YOU FACE REALITY
IT CONSUMES YOUR LIFE
SUFFERING THE ANGELS WINGS
FOR THEIR SWAY AWAKES MY MIND
TO BE OPPOSED TO IGNORANCE
SOMEONE IS TO DIE
ABHORRENCE RISE
ABOVE THE GROUND
WIPE THE WEAK FROM THIS PLACE
TO SET THE TRUTH TO ZERO
SHARING THIS PAIN
SHARING THIS HATE

ANGER RISES IN YOUR HEART

DESTROYS THE SELFISH DISSONANCE
IF YOU HEAR REALITY
IT CONSUMES YOUR MIND
RAGING SO MUCH RAGING SO BAD
FACE YOUR DEATH IT`S ALWAYS HERE
DISCREPANCY OF COGNITION
RELIEF IS DEATH FOR ME
AND MY EYES CAN SEE
CONTROLS A GLIMPSE OF MY MIND
IF YOU FACE REALITY
IT CONSUMES YOUR LIFE
IGNORANCE LIKE SHADES DECEIT
FOR ITS GLAMOUR RULES THIS EARTH
TO WALK ACROSS THIS FIRY PATH
SOMEONE IS TO COME
ABHORRENCE RISE
ABOVE THE GROUND
WIPE THE WEAK FROM THIS PLACE
TO SET THE TRUTH TO ZERO
SHARING THIS PAIN
SHARING THIS HATE
FACE YOUR HATE IT`S ALWAYS HERE
ANGER RISES IN YOUR HEART
AND MY EARS CAN HEAR
DESTROYS THE SELFISH DISSONANCE
IF YOU HEAR REALITY
IT CONSUMES YOUR MINDWith every minute death is nearer
Are we not just passengers
Aboard a sinking ship?
All is lost, memories are distant
Into the air you slowly disappear
Just to come again as rain
And I bathe in your divinity....
I don't know why or how
But time kills like the plague
And death will have its way
The crates have emptied
The dreams, washed away
But tears still fall
They still do...
With every minute death rears its ugly end
More and more
Are we not just passengers caught in a storm?
The days have emptied
Memories, washed away
But tears still fall
They still do...Spit on lost reality, connived underneath the sun
Had to go and drive the needle
Of my mind right through my heart
Absence of thought disturbs me
I've seen me in a dream, I've lost me in a dream
Longing like a new widow wanting to rejoin
Force fed dosed on reality
Indian giver be true or trade away
I've liked me in a dream, I've loved me in a dream
Tangled web, quit wasting my time
Why can't I get back to where I've never been?
Let the flesh instruct the mind
Destructive signs
Spend my time counting snowflakes in my mind
I never show even though
You know I know the way, I know the way
I've seen me in a dream, I've lost me in a dream
Tangled web, quit wasting my time
Why can't I get back to where I've never been?
Let the flesh instruct the mind
Destructive signs, hey ya
Sitting here waiting for myself
I'm late again, that's always certain
As long as I make it back, make it back
I'm living in a dream, I've lost me in a dream
Tangled web, quit wasting my time
Why can't I get back to where I've never been?
Let the flesh instruct the mind
Destructive signs
Tangled web, quit possessing my time
Why can't I go back to where I've never been?
Let the flesh instruct the mind
Destructive signs
Let the flesh instruct the mindChoose the sword and you will join me
Choose the ball and you join your mother in death
You don't understand my words, but you must choose
So come boy, choose life or death
Yeah, go to hell
The only man a hoe wait for
Is the sky-blue Bally kid, in eighty-three, rocked Taylor's
My Memorex performed tape decks, my own phone sex
Watch out for Haiti bitches, I heard they throw hex
Yo, Wu whole platoon is filled with rac-coons
Corner sittin' wine niggaz sippin' Apple Boone
This ain't no white cartoon
'Cuz I be duckin' crazy spades
The kid hold white shit, like blacks rock ashy legs
Why is the sky blue? Why is water wet?
Why did Judas rat to Romans while Jesus slept? Stand up
You're out of luck like two dogs stuck
Iron Man be sippin' rum, out of Stanley Cups, unflammable
Noriega, aimin' knives which stay windy in Chicago
Spine-tingle, mind boggles
Kangols in rainbow colors, promoters try to hold dough
Give me mine before Po, wrap you up in so-and-so
I ran the Dark Ages, Constantine and great Henry the Eighth
Built with Ghengis Khan, the wreck suede wiley Don
I judge wisely, as if nothin' ever surprise me
Loungin', between two pillars of ivory
I'm lively, my dome piece is like buildin' stones in Greece
My poems are deep from ancient thrones I speak
I'm overwhelmed as my mind roams the realm
My eye's the vision, memory is the film
Others act sub-tile, but they fragile above clouds
They act wild and couldn't budge a crowd
No matter how loud they get, though they growl and spit
Clutch they fists, and throw up signs like a Crip
And throw all types of fits
I leave 'em split, like ass cheeks and ragged pussy lips
Aiyyo, camoflouge chameleon, ninjas scalin' your buildin'
No time to grab the gun, they already got your wife and children
A hit was sent from the President to rage your residence
Because you had secret evidence and documents
On how they raped the continents and it's the prominent
Dominant Islamic, Asiatic black hebrew
The year two thousand and two, the battle's filled with the Wu
Six million devils just died from the Bubonic Flu
Or the Ebola Virus under the reign of King Cyrus
You can see the weakness of a man right through his iris
Un-loyal snakes get thrown in boilin' lakes
Of hot oil, it boils your skin, chickenheads gettin' slim
Like Olive Oyl, only plant the seed deep inside fertile soil
Fortified with essential, vitamin and mineral
Use the sky for a blanket, stuffin' clouds inside my pillow
Rollin' with the lands
The tribe's a hundred and forty four thousand chosen
Protons electrons always cause explosions
The banks of G, all cream downs a vet
Money feed good, opposites off the set
It ain't hard to see, my seeds need God-degree
I got mouths to feed, unnecessary beef is more cows to breed
I'm on some tax free shit by any means
Whether bound to hit scheme or some counterfeit cream
I learned much from such with cons who run scams
Veterans got the game spiced like hams
And from that, sons are born and guns are drawn
Clips are fully loaded, and then blood floods the lawn
Disciplinary action was a fraction of strength
That made me truncate the limp on temp
With the stump, treat his hips like air pumps
RZA shaped the track, niggaz caught razor bumps
Scarred tryin' to figure who invented
This unprecented, opium-scented, dark-tinted
Now watch me blow him out his shoes without clues
'Cuz I won't hesitate to detonate, I'm short fuse[I. Benighted Like Usher]
Snuffed tapers sighed
As Death left impressing
His crest of cold tears on the Countess
Benighted like ill-fated Usher
The House of Bathory shrouded
'Neath grief's dark facade
If only I could have wept
In mourning by Her side
I would have clasped Her so tight
Like storm-beached Aphrodite
Drowned on Kytherean tides
And Kissed Her
For from Her alone
My lips would have known
Enigmas of shadowy vistas
Where pleasures took flesh
And pain, remorseless
Came freezing the breath
Of raucous life hushed unto whispers
Benighted.
Inhaling the pale waning moonlight that crept
Through the crypt of Her Lord who so lucidly slept
Benighted.
Exhaling the wail of black widowhood's toll
Waxing eternal night entered Her soul
[II. A Murder of Ravens in Fugue]
Now haranguing grey skies
With revenge upon life
Gnathic and Sapphic
Needs begged gendercide
Delusions of Grandier denounced the revolt
Of descrying cursed glass, disenchanted in vaults
Encircled by glyphs midst Her sin-sistered cult
With hangman's abandon She plied spiritworlds
To Archangels in bondage
From light to night hurled
Cast down to the earth where torment would unfurl.......
But soon,
Her tarot proved
Hybrid rumours spread like tumours
Would accrue
And blight Her stars
However scarred
To better bitter truths
Of cold bloodbaths
As bodies rose
In rigid droves
To haunt Her from their
Shallow burials imposed
When wolves exhumed
Their carthen wombs
Where heavy frosts had laboured long
To bare their wounds
To the depths of Her soul they pursued
Wielding their poison they flew
Like a murder of ravens in fugue
And knowing their raptures
Would shatter Her dreams
She clawed blackened books for damnation's reprieve
Baneful cawed canons on amassed enemies
So Hallow's Eve
As She received
Like Bellona to the ball
Those enemies
Fell-sisters heaved
Her torturies
Cross stained flagstones
To Her carriage reined to flee
But She knew She must brave the night through
Though fear crept a deathshead o'er the moon
Like a murder of ravens in Fugue
For each masked, jewelled gaze held dread purpose
Horror froze painted eyes to cold stares
And even Her dance
In the vast mirrors cast
Looked the ill of Her future
If fate feasted there....
[III. Eyes That Witnessed Madness]
In an age crucified by the nails of faith
When rank scarecrows of christ blighted lands
An aloof Countess born an obsidian wraith
Dared the abyss knowing well She was damned
Her life whispered grief like a funeral march
Twisted and yearning, obsessed an entranced
With those succumbing to cruelty
Crushed 'neath the gait of Her dance
A whirlwind of fire that swept through the briers
Of sweet rose Her thickets of black thorn had grasped...
She demanded the Heavens and forever to glean
The elixir of Youth from the pure
Whilst Her lesbian fantasies
Reamed to extremes
O'er decades unleashed
Came for blood's silken cure
But Her reign ended swiftly
For Dark Gods dreamt too deep
To heed Her pleas
When Her gaolers were assailed
With condemnations from a priest
Who'd stammered rites
In the dead of night
For maidens staining winding sheets
And She postured proud
When Her crimes were trowelled
And jezebelled to peasant lips
Though She smelt the fires
That licked limbs higher
To the tortured cunts of accomplices
So ends this twisted fable's worth
And though spared the pyre's bite
By dint of nobled bloodlined birth
Her sins (crimes) garnered Her no respite
Forever severed from the thrill of coming night
Where slow Death alone could grant Her flight
"The Spirits have all but fled judgement
I rot, alone, insane,
Where the forest whispers puce laments for me
From amidst the pine and wreathed wolfsbane
Beyond these walls, wherein condemned
To the gloom of an austere tomb
I pace with feral madness sent
Through the pale beams of a guiltless moon
Who, bereft of necrologies, thus
Commands creation over the earth
Whilst I resign my lips to death
A slow cold kiss that chides rebirth
Though one last wish is bequathed by fate
My beauty shalt wilt, unseen
Save for twin black eyes that shalt come to take
My soul to peace or Hell for company"
(To peace or hell for company)
My soul to Hell for companyI welcomed you with open arms
To share my pride and glory
You said you searched for a better life
At least that was your story
You caught me off guard with your deception
And now I'm just seeing red
I rid this world of your fucking infection
Never forgive, never forget
Never forgive, never forget
Eye for an eye, life or death
Never forgive, never forget
Kill or be killed with no regret
Never forgive, never forget
Eye for an eye, life or death
Never forgive, never forget
Kill or be killed with no regret
I am justice and I am the law
Executioner, judge and jury
You preyed on human tragic flaw
But now you face my fury
A favor to the world, I erase your life
Covered in blood I dance to your death
For crimes against humanity, I'll finish the fight
Never forgive, never forget
Never forgive, never forget
Eye for an eye, life or death
Never forgive, never forget
Kill or be killed with no regret
Never forgive, never forget
Eye for an eye, life or death
Never forgive, never forget
Kill or be killed with no regret
No fucking regret
Motherfucker
Now it's killing time
Vengeance is mine
You're the lowest form of fucking life
I dare even call you human
My heart breeds hatred, terror and spite
My revenge will be your ruin
May your family die a thousand deaths
No remorse, no idle threats
Clock strikes twelve, I take my respect
Never forgive, never forget
Never forgive, never forget
Eye for an eye, life or death
Never forgive, never forget
Kill or be killed with no regret
Never forgive, never forget
Eye for an eye, life or death
Never forgive, never forget
Kill or be killed with no regret
No regret
No regret
No regret
No regretA distant whisper touched my sleep - A longing for the reason
Before my spell will set you free - meet me again so bitter sweet.
The Springtime's all renewing lights
Unvailed to me a crawling ant
As unimportant as it seemed
Still lit worlds noone could see.
Days passed years my gaze remained on glimpses of this tiny life
It cannot be - no never no - not human - so low and imprisoned in its time.
So shall I break the ancient rule?
Shall shame fall on untroubled life?
Am I the first to take this step?
Risk all I have for what I only feel?
I swung my cape over your body
My silverish sting scratched your heart.
"On behalf of Love" I screamed - you died.
and left the vail on shadow's ground.
In coming minutes - years or lives
I drank forbidden wine alot
Looks - dreams and all was tempting me
To drain too much; still wanting more.
So dazzled as it left me standing
Amidst those sunshine thunderstorms
So unprepeared I was and wondered
Forgot that things can have a heart.
The times we had were only mine
My will unbeaten in the skies
Broke shattered by this tiny plant
I picked from a rocky-water-ball.
So shall I rhyme this ancient spell?
Shall lips form these forgotten words?
Save the pawn to lose the queen?
Wake the fool and fool myself?
Divide us now my ancient spell
Take memory from this chosen one
I envy you: for you a dream
For me the ever lasting pain.
The empress so everhigh
will wander spheres - can never die
The ant will crawl untouched by those
Just stand under - not understand - at all.
Hast thou seen this looking gass of her's.
She found though no one forced this step?
Are you willing to play your part?
Or shallst in darkness fall again?
I have not seen - yet have I felt
The looking-glass that broke the spell
I join again to fit my part.
And play "The Game" until the end.Leaving behind a world on the brink of destruction.
Dreamlike, seeking another way out.
Another empty promise that I could do without.
Afraid or unafraid, leaving behind a world on the brink of destruction.
In our lives, you don't get a second chance.
So don't talk the talk, if you can't dance the dance.
'Cause I've got family livin' around every corner.
Now you know.
Don't say I didn't warn ya.
It's not how you lost.
It's how you won.
And where I'm from, it's either do or get done.
The fight isn't over till the war is won,
And where I'm from, it's either do or get done.
My cries were left unheard.
Feel this pain from the inside.
Instinct is all I have.
Close the door on my life.
Feel this pain from the inside out, out, out.You're dead you fuck
You're dead at my feet
My revenge is almost complete
Your eyes staring
Staring into space
Seeing nothing, no heartbeat
Limp cadaver shut up forever
Life snuffed with no remorse
I will humiliate your corpse
You lay dead I laugh alive
My blood pumps, adrenaline rises
Can't help laughing as I look
At your corpse underfoot
Stepping on your chest
I yank down my pants
My butt hole dilating
To humiliate your corpse
You lay there limp contorted
I pinch a loaf for you
Your face is spattered with my shit
A pile of brown on blue
You're dead you fuck
You're dead at my feet
My revenge is now complete
Your eyes staring
Staring into space
As my urine dribbles down your face
Life snuffed with no remorse
I've humiliated your corpseLived to live through a lie
Lived and lied to buy some time
Hit the bottom ready to shine
On this tattooed cross we'll die
Alone to question, wonder why
Welcome to the bottom of your life
Here before me I can see
Here at the bottom I'll stay
I just couldn't leave here anyway
Black insides a lovely mess
This masked deception I detest
Forgive me father I have sinned
All alone welcome to the bottom again
Your soul hangs upon the line
Existence dares to decline
Here before me I can't see
Here at the bottom I'll stay
I just couldn't leave here anyway
Light becomes my enemy
My home an early grave
And I still won't leave here anyway
Here before me I can't see
Here at the bottom I'll stay
I just couldn't leave here anyway
Light becomes my enemy
My home an early grave
And I still won't leave here anywayAware, yet unaware. Falling, falling, why?
Blind! Ignorance the key, stupidity overrides
My thoughts belong to me, although my mind rebels
Reality, shaded meaning, denial is my cell
[Chorus:]
Killing my mind
Victimize my own belief
Defy myself! Find no relief
Obtrusive walls cannot reveal
Cast out myself and all I feel
My eyes refuse to see all I must endure
Revealing walls of doubt, reality so obscure
Searching, I'm searching, it's one who's deep within
Beside myself I stand and now I must begin
[Chorus]
The self inside is so sincere
Avoid the truth, the honest fear
Intensify all that remains
Bind it now with self restraints
[Chorus]This empty sky fills your empty mind.
And it's you, the fool, who thinks that I'll rot away.
When there's nothing to save you from this hell.
Fuck your faith. I'll rot away.
This empty sky can't save.
This empty sky has deaf ears to your cries.
There's no salvation.
Fuck your faith.
Rot away.Is it a revolving disc that we give each other
Does the path that accompanies me lead to sense to a moment
Warmth lies in dark freezing eyes
Eyes that speak a tricky language
Tasting the leading drop
The drop that allows me to speak from the deepest conviction
A wave that nips every rock in the bud
In the intoxication of warmth
I relearned to inspire courage and willpower in a puppet-like figure
Being somebody's slave
Used by others
A new pedestal has been cast
It was sketched by hope and confidence
Riding on a merry-go-round of passion
Dreaming and never waking up again
I woke upA fork is a cold shiny tool
To pierce, tear and ingest
Whoever has the fork in hand
Controls the meal of its choice
We're told the first few punctures
They're for our own good
Better carved up in pieces
Than blown up in the oven
Agh! Agh! Agh!
Forkboy
Flies by night on stolen fuel
To Santa Rosa, CA
Opens a fake employment office
"Want a job? Go get me drugs"
People desperate for work
Return to quite a surprise
Busted for intent to sell
Cops pay him a bounty
Forkboy skips town
Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh!
We came
We peed
We conquered
You bleed
The choice:
Fork Boy
Or Finger Food
Ugly joy
What does it replace?
Why wait
When you can eat yourself alive today
Junk bondage takeover glutton
Ready to bore in
Unfold his rotary blades inside
Pull the guts out and resell them
Buys out his next target
With the last one's pension funds
Thousands more thrown out of work
So Leona won't have to settle for a mint
Forkboy
Picked by the FBI
To be the black pied piper
After Dr. King died
Watches soap operas on TV
While 6 billion's disappears from HUD
Who are you working for
What did you hope to gain
Why do you hate your past
So much you destroy the ones you love
Forkboy!A new world order created by the government
An unimaginable force of their mindless soldiers
Their primary objective has now been put in place
A movement to eliminate every creative thinking mind
As every nation is beaten down and famed
Our world will be given up to a dominating regime
A new, absolute power of unmerciful rule
They suppress every quality that makes us human
They will consume and scorch the entire globe
Through subliminal programming brainwashing and mind control
A bastard race to rule with blood soaked iron fists
With totalitarianism they squash their opposition
A regime based on domination and enthropicide
We must not yield to the superpowers that mold us
They want us passive, with no individuality
Conscienceless clone troops mow down and try us
We are nothing more than livestock to model a new race
To be neutered and conformed
Reproducing pseudo-beings that look exactly like we do
The clones are replicas of you and I
Our very features and physicalities mocked up for reproduction
The human race replaced
There may be a solution, it's our one glimmer of hope
True patriots must find the strength within themselves to fight
We must cut the cloning at it's bloody roots
This is our only chance if we are to stay human
We must not allow the cybernauts to take our place
By killing the commander in chief and his cabinet
Final result weed out the weak
World domination modern tyrants seek
Old decrees snuffed out and lost
Cloning begins, global holocaust3 riffs is all we need
don't need no shitty lead
simple is how we vote
this bit is just one note
can't find a good song name
something clever
they all sound the fuckin'same
something witty
i think i'll call this song tittie!Lead Nornagest
Take Me!!!
[Nornagest:]
Blank eyes in sight
Empty body for a soul full of sorrow
Confusion is growing in me,
Spining wihtin my blood,
"Razors are hammering"
[Sabathan:]
Despair: silent screams are hurting my hears,
Anger: motionless, hatred is burning my senses,
Feelings: frozen scarves of my darkest past.
Solution: self-destruction.
Endless waitings, slow sufferings,
The SATANA-test is exciting my wond... my wound...
[Chorus]
[both Nornagest/Sabathan:]
It's turning and turning into my head, confusion's turning me to insane,
Tell me your choice, tell me my destiny across the Vortex of confusion.
[Solo: N.Daemon]
[Nornagest:]
At once, the kiss of the wolf sat my heart on fire,
Yet another scarve melted into Lava's spellbound,
My body's burning and my soul once again petrified in time... In time!!!
[Solo : Nornagest]
[Solo : Nornagest]
[Lead : Nornagest]
My scarves are still bleeding remains of my darkes past,
A new age shall erise, a new man is born... Oh Lord....
Take Me!!!
[Lead : Nornagest]The halls of the grotesque
Reverberate our final doom
Oh, the ravenous indulgence
The rite of passage eternal
A black lung full of ash
A parasitic void
Oh, the tenebrous upheaval
Our defeat triumphant
Into this parasitic void
The emperor's crypt
The rite of passage eternal
For this Adam of dust
Statues crumble, flags are torn
As a crawling chaos - we ascend
A black lung full of ash
A parasitic void
Oh, the tenebrous upheaval
Our defeat triumphant
Into this parasitic void
The emperor's crypt
The rite of passage eternal
For this Adam of dust
At the gates of the void
Dark spirits rising
An ominous sun
Piercing the circular ruinsI live to war it's in my blood if I want it I take
The men I've killed the children slaves
And all the woman I've raped
Between my legs I've got what it takes to be called a man
Fighting, feasting, fucking all I can
Moonlight on horseback till death we will ride
Northern winds pushing us towards suicide
Mars god of war masturbating in rage
Wild libido I've freed from its cage
Male Supremacy
I eat the brains from my enemy's head
I proudly wear their scalps
I burn their towns to the ground to me the prisoners bow
Muscle, sweat, long hair and dirt leather, fur and chains
My uniform torn and worn covered with blood stains
Testosterone mates with adrenaline
Bearing a son of insane aggression
Woman will never know or understand
The power men feel to kill with their hands
After the war I come home weak and sore
I fall into your arms
We lie by the fire
You feed my desire with me safe and warm
Outside the wind blows cold
Inside the embers glow shelter from the stormEndless structures rise and fall Enormous waves ever roll The all of your soul The strings of your world
Breaking away Explode from inside A needle point at the horizon Shooting down from a murderous sky
Growing fast - Approaching THe Rolling Power - Smattering Force
Face of Destruction - Deep hit of death Reflecting in your animal eyes With no mercy at its hands
Stop your blood in hopeless fear One look in its eyes ANd everyone denies That they ever have seen
The light in its shine One taste of its, black You know there's no way back As you stand before death
All alone Dead are your tears As the deep hit of death shatters your soul
With no mercy at command You return to ever rolling waves Chainstorm reaction Fast black knife
Bitter shine Driving the spike deep through your mind Weak and mean All is energy One and the same
Can't be destroyed Just changing form The all of your soul The strings in your world Breaking away
Growing fast - Approaching The rolling power - Shattering force Face of Destruction - Deep hit of deah
Reflecting in your carrion eyes With no mercy at its hands Make you lose your human form
Die into eternity! ...Deep ...Deep ...Hit ...of DeathGet a gun to protect yourself from someone else with a gun
Being armed up to the teeth that means you don't have to run
Better safe than being sorry, better alive than being dead
Better him than me you say as you aim your gun at his head
You live your life at gunpoint don't be scared be prepared
It's peace you say that you fight for but it's war you declare
Take a life to save a life you call that living in peace?
It takes more than a piece of metal for the peace to increase
Are you man enough to hold a gun?
Are you man enough to turn your back and run?
Are you man enough to take a life?
Are you man enough to make one?
With your finger stuck on the trigger you're one hell of a man
But you won't be much of a macho when the blood's on your hands
If you live by the gun you'll die by the gun I promise you that
And you ain't got a goddamn thing if all you've got is a gat
History repeats itself but still we don't pull the brakes
What will it take for us to learn to learn from our own mistakes
I'd rather die defending my own right to never bare arms
Than live pretending a gun will keep me safe from bodily harm
Chorus
If sacrifice is the price for freedom then tell me what's the use
killing someone to prove that killing is wrong still ain't no excuse
how can you believe that death will make the suffering cease
prepare to sacrifice your life once the bullets released
ChorusWe've been marching under the gloomy sky
Dispersed into small crowds
From horizon to horizon
Since time immemorial, for many years.
Under the endless vault of the sky covered with stars
Through the land which sucked blood for centuries
Through the rising clouds of dust
Through rain and raging winds.
Past enveloped in mystery
Future out of sight.
Hundreds of thousands of stars shattered in space
Scattered galaxies
Where the order met with chaos.
Everything is only a moment,
Story told many times
By travelling traders, wanderers and confused dreamers.
Legends and myths
Memorials of heroism and great acts
Real dreams
Frustrated lives.
Everything is only a moment
As well as this song,
Which I use to hear sung by rooks
During autumn days of fallen leaves.
Sea of loneliness in the distant universe
Phantom, passing allusion, eternity?
Jump into the abyss or fly up
Defy or give in.
Is it a matter of coincidence or free choice?Mental Blindfolds on
Early on the fascination intense
How to discern just where right belongs
Something has got to give
These things I just don't want you to see
There is no need for you to start revolutions
I don't want you to talk to the minions
Just show me a brand new face
an open mind against a dying race
Something has got to give
These things I just don't want you to hear/feel
Cannot fail in this the era of losers
burnt the shell of those that once held the torches
Cannot give you the senses anew
nor will you know innocence again
Something has got to give
These things I just don't want you to know
in time all your questions will be answered
not what you hoped for, not what you dreamed
all preconceptions crumble
Something has got to give
These things I just don't want you to learn
Won't hold up to the standards you keep
never came from the formative years
Just show me a brand new mind
Keep in what you left behind
Something has got to give
These things I just don't want you to be[Lyrics : RMS Hreidmarr / October 1999]
I reach the quintessence of all that is
I was, I am and I shall be again
Burn and torture me for I am the witch
The Antechrist you've feared for years and years
Burn me and burn us there's no time to waste
Burn, burn before you understand
For crime so pure and restless tragedies
I transgress your world into the house of dawn
For redemption and immortality
A sacred sin for divine perfection
Drudenhaus !
O Roy des cieux et Seigneur des Seigneurs
O ange des anges, toi que craignent tous les hommes en silence
Je suis l'ineffable et ton bras vengeur
L'unique salut de ce monde profane et sans grace
I pray for all and whole non-salvation
And all the phantoms on earth follow me
I search for some old forgotten treasures
And the girl made of gold is forever above me
Down into the house of dawn I rest
Between these walls of huge flesh I lay
Dawn of Miracle - Drudenhaus !
Where life sets and burns until the fall
Through the sacred semence of the Lord - my soul
I caress the total universe
Even so vast mortal skies and oceans cannot
Fill the house of presence and goldlust storms
There grows the shadow of all my passions
There all is silence and will of seduction
Mourir de notre main ou de la votre
Mourir et enfin vivre d'absolu
Et vous serez fiers de nous avoir juge
Mais nous seuls nous etions condamnes
I touch the quintessence of all that is
I was, I am and I shall be again
Fuck and slaughter me for I am the witch
The mystic force you've cursed for years and years
Burn me and burn us there's no time to waste
Burn, burn before it's too late
3. God Bless The Hustler
[Lyrics : RMS Hreidmarr / October 1999]
Shining upon their chests
The silver seal
The blood-red penitents
Towards our land
From my window I can guess
The flames of their so-called heaven
By now, I should run away
Leave the house, the church, the grave
And I won't do that
I open my eyes - cannot move
Their hell after tracks me down
Has finally put his hand in mine
Torture me if you want
I have learnt to suffer
And in my grave
Rained many a tear, oh blessed majesties
Once more saved - nevermore
Mare tenebrarum - the red penitents
My fate divine - their worst obssession
Burn in hell you cunt !
Their eyes are burning more than their crosses[Musik und Text Januar 1993 a.y.p.s.]
Ich frage mich, wie wird der Winter sein
wenn ich den Frhling niemals sehen werde
Ich frage mich, wie wird die Nach sein
wenn ich den Tag niemals sehen werde
Ich frage mich, wie wird das Leben sein
wenn ich das Licht niemals sehen werde
Ich frage mich, wie wird das Leben sein
wenn der Schmerz endlos whrt
In jeder Nacht ist das Schwarz anders
in jeder Nacht wnsche ich mir die Zeit zurck,
in der ich durch die alten Wlder ritt
In jedem Winter ist die Klte anders
in jedem Winter fhle icj mich so alt
so alt wie die Nacht
so alt wie die furchtbare KlteBrutally raped and hacked, Vagina torn ripped in half , Slash and rend,
mutilate, Garrote the bitch, decapitate, Face ripped off, disfigurement,
Bodily dismemberment, Guts are spilled, violent death, Mangled cunt to
molest... Left embracing the carcass I discover my fomentment, As I
unconsciously rub up against her gory habiliment, The muliebral texture of
the soused and silken garment, The one and only way to find sexual
contentment... Suffering from mammary and vaginal envy, I fasten around my
chest the brassiere of the deceased, Excising the breasts with painstaking
precision, I pad my bra with a pair of decomposing falsies... Hastily undress
the corpse, Peel off clothing, quite a chore, Clutching her bousterrie,
Caressing bloody lingerie, Grasping for ensanguined garb, My erection is
growing hard, Buttoning the imbrued dress, Feminine attire, a bloody mess...
As I adorn myself in my victims blood-stained apparel, My perverse urges are
fulfilled with overwhelming delight, I ejaculate as I slip into her urine
soaked panties, My carnal desire that of a necro-transvestite... Encrusted,
runny stockings, finery for a fiend... Donning ghastly vestments,
necro-splattered closet queen...I'm watching the mountains
So high in their prime
Like all of our brothers
Defenders of time
I stand by the river
So innocent, divine
Thinking there are no heroes
Only vengeance and crimes
Can't we see we are,
Can't we feel we are
Can't we try all as one
Bonded flesh, bonded blood,
bonded life in one sound
There will be no more heroes
Only a violent sky
There will be no more sinners
You could ask yourself why
No heroes, no sinners No heroes
Among killing fields
No values no names
Is there peace in the twilight?
Is there an end to theses games?
Can't we see we are,
Can't we feel we are
Can't we try all as one
Bonded flesh, bonded blood,
bonded life in one sound
There will be no more heroes
Only a violent sky
There will be no more sinners
You could ask yourself why
Will we ever change?
What do you want in exchange?
Will we ever change?
No heroes - no sinners -No heroes - NoI'm wanting waiting
Needing aching holding breathing
Watching stealing
Thirsting Gazing I've always been there at a distance
Waiting for the day you would notice me
And I lied, lied to myself
Knowing that Ie always hoped for more
if you could only see you're stealing my breath away
Broad strokes and fine lies
Painting a picture never wanted to see
it's all too clear we've only been lying, lying
How many times did it all fall down
how many times when there was nothing left
Only then you would see me, how many times
Your heart-your heart of gold is broken
I wish I could be the name on your lips
For only one moment of bliss I wish
you could see the paper-thin scars I bear for the heart of the golden
Your heart is broken
Your heart-your heart of gold is broken
Wishing I can be the name of on your lips
For only one moment of bliss i wish you could see the paper-thin scarsRaising like brothers
Sharing their dreams
Feeling protested
(but) it's not like it seemed
Jelousy grew
As time went on by
Nobody knew
That their love was a lie
Unspoken hate
Tor them apart
They had to wait
The fight couldn't start
Slaved by their descent
Unable to slove
Searching the reason
Searching the truth
Destiny paid it's dues
And they have nothing left to loose
(so they) both build a kingdom
Reigning different worlds
They were like
FIRE AND ICE
One have the poverty
One lived in luxury
They ruled
HEAVEN AND HELL
Both ruled their nation
With power and strength
Darkshaded warriors
Waiting to strike
Like vultures who circle
On the top of their victims
Patient they are waiting
'til their time has come
Tagedy took it's all
And the winner took it all

The Ancient Queen.
Deadly hate, deadly love.
Dark under the shadow.
Death has been resisted.
The Ancient Queen,
ruler of the domain.
Keeper of the fury,
the Queen dwells in shadow.
Dark rivers run though me.
Darkness follows everwhere.
Kingdoms falling again and again.
Crawl to thee over again.
The Ancient Queen, the darkest woman.
Stepping through her shadow.
She who sees the soul.
Black is her blood.
Keeper of the fury.
Stepping through her shadow.
Do you see her soul?
Black is her blood.
Keeper of the fury.
Dark under the shadow.
Thy destiny lies with her.
The Ancient Queen,
ruler of the domain.
Keeper of the fury.
In shadow... shadow.Were Passing on love, and reaching for wealth
This damned existence, a struggle just to get by
Wondering what could become, from giving up
On the surface, were passing on, passing on
Im trampled rampant underneath the moving feet
Of the relentless ever pressing greed
Exchange the golden parachute, for silver cuffs
Another arbitrary view, were waking up waking up
Youd like to think youre the only one
Running, with resolve
So typical, predictable soul, typical, predictable
Nothing, this world means nothing
Living is everything, yet nothing
When youre not alive
You brought yourself here, but youre losing the floor
Tensions tighten
Break your fucking neck!
And I bet youd try and sell me twice
If you knew you could get the price
Ive conquered more in half the time
Overlooked and undermined
And I bet youd try and sell me twice
If you knew you could get the price
Youre just too busy, busy hanging,
From your neck.
Overlooked and undermined
Break your fucking neck!Whispering voices in darkness
Their footsteps were really quite loud
They came for a skull made of crystal
They'll leave in a burial shroud
Gathering in the graveyard
A cult and a secret cabal
They'll search every inch of the catacombs
Kill them all, kill them all!!!!!
Peel their skin
Put the knife in
Burn them without and then burn them within!
Polish the headbone and try not to scratch it
Turn them to Rot Gut
Bury the hatchet!
Torches arranged in a circle
Bathing the cultists in light
We crept through the shadows
Trying to hear them and stay out of sight
They spoke of a power contained in the skull
They said, it was brought from the stars
That thing we'd been using to crack open walnuts
Used to crack walnuts on mars?
Peel their skin
Put the knife in
Burn them without and then burn them within!
Polish the headbone and try not to scratch it
Turn them to Rot Gut
Bury the hatchet!
We broke up the party with a Molotov blast
They turned into human torches when we doused them in gas
The screaming was loud it would get louder still
As I slit their bellies open in my frenzy to kill
Axes shattered vertebrae, spinal fluid squirts
Cleavers entered craniums, ruining white shirts
Burning eyeballs guttering and cooling into clots
Being hung by their intestines had them tied up in knots
Skin was pulled from muscle and devoured on the spot
Cult members dying and left there to rot
Some of them made it, I'm sorry to say
Next time they come here we will find a way to
Bury the hatchet!
Victims decaying in the darkness
Their screaming was really quite loud
They came for a skull made of crystal
They left in a burial shroud
Moldering in the graveyard
Their bones will be nibbled by rats
If they're going to steal the crystalline skull
They'll have to do better than that
Peel their skin
Put the knife in
Burn them without and then burn them within!
Polish the headbone and try not to scratch it
Turn them to Rot Gut
Bury the hatchet!The magic has gone
Everything's like chaos
The voice is strange
The touch's cold.
The night is colourful
Every sound of it makes me shudder
Attack me from the darkness
Breathes its frosty breath to me.
Somewhere in the deep -
You'll find me if you need me
You see, i needn't fear
The natural beauty casts a spell upon me
Somewhere in the deep -
From below everything's cleaner.
Don't disturb my dream -
I'm defendin' the secret of the world.
You can see a dream
Shades in the fire
Shade of a raven
As i returned.
My body belongs to the decay
Someone above is watchin' me
The sky's silent and feels blue
The wind dries it's tears.[Instrumental]Picture you a sight unseen, vengeance fills my head
satisfy my lust for blood when i see you dead
you were never what i would, something i won't sought
now that you are gone for good you have been forgot
feted the lord of death, as a deity
fuck you and your son of god, failure you will feast
bible the book of blood; it will be denied
servent of the enemy, its your turn to die
die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die
now i lay me down to sleep, pray no one my soul to keep, if i die before i wake, i want your lord to stay away
guide me not or take of me, internal torment i forsee
in his name i will not know, or follow him where he shall go
die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die
in the name of god leaving us alone
raining fire in my life in hopes that i'll conform
all i fear is nothing new, death is something dear
wait the hour that i go your image disappears
feted the lord of death, as a deity
fuck you and your son of god, failure you will feast
bible the book of blood; it will be denied
servent of the enemy, its your turn to dieRockin' records

Does time end here?
Is this what I fought for?
And what I've gained
What a fool I've been
To think life had more to offer
Instead I lye here
In remorse and suffer
And I hate you for doing this
And I hate you for saying that
I never did enough to ever please you
Never did enough for it to cease to
Affect me the way it does
Provoke me the way it must
And I'm still thinking
I'm not enough
My war on time
Got worse and faster
The sands fought hard
And every day I lost a battle
And even though I knew I lied
And even though I saw the signs
The same three words each time
I am fine
And I hate you for doing this
And I hate you for saying that
I never did enough to ever please you
Never did enough for it to cease to
Provoke me the way it must
And I'm still thinking
I am not enough
I'm ashamed of the life I've lived
I'm afraid of what I have been
And it just became
Just became enough...Bleed, when you thought you knew
Do you hear me shout?
Bleeding through my ribbon on my eyes (to come home)
What I'm thinking now
When I take you out
We can always start to havoc death till it comes
These rebel ways to show you
I want to fuck you now
We live we are to make you
In turn we know you're going down
But now it's over I'm calmer like crimson
Throwing down like water, I saw her as she hit the ground
Now it's over, I'm calmer like crimson.
Throwing down like water, I saw her as she hit the ground
Proof, when they tear you up
When they start to fuck
When they start to piss down on my scars (to come home)
What I'm thinking now
When I stumble down
We can never say that you are gone till it comes
These rebel ways to show you
I just can't take no more
The thought of me inside you
Just makes me sick you're going down
But now it's over I'm calmer like crimson
Throwing down like water, I saw her as she hit the ground
Now it's over, I'm calmer like crimson.
Throwing down like water, I saw her as she hit the ground
Hate, when you thought you knew
Do you hear me shout ?
Bleeding through my ribbon on my eyes (to come home)
What I'm thinking now
When I take you out
We can always start to havoc death till it comes
These rebel ways to show you
I just can't take no more
The thought of me inside you
Just makes me sick you're going down.
These rebel ways to show you
I wanna fuck you now.
We live we are to make you
In turn we know you're going down!Today I've understood what feels a man torn from hope
It is like taking the Earth all her flowers away
Today I uncovered loneliness for myself
It is like I have already not lived among you
Tomorrow I'll resurect heartbroken
Will the birds ever sing for me again?
Tomorrow in a mirror I'll see my new face
It will be the mask of grey
Tomorrow I'll resurect heartbroken
Will the birds ever sing for me again?
Tomorrow I'll resurect heartbroken
Will the birds ever sing for me again?
Tomorrow in a mirror I'll see my new face
It will be the mask of grey
Tomorrow I'll resurect heartbroken
Will the birds ever sing for me again?
Tomorrow I'll resurect heartbroken
Will the birds ever sing for me again?[words & music by Thomas C. Hansen]
Rain is falling down, All over your grave
Hope is all I've got, keeps me from going insane
There is a place far beyond
Where you can go to get the strength to carry on
Fly far away, to the heavens gate
There you can rest in peace
Fly away, to the heavens and you'll find
It's time for you to leave this world behindThe heaves are lit by the stars where years of secrets of universal
forces lay hid. They shine so bright, but yet they have seen more evil
than time itself. Reflected in the deepless lakes they are drowning in
black elements. They are the planetary keys to unlimited wisdom and
power for the Emperor to obtain. They being the gods of the wolves
whom upon they bark at night, requesting their next victim in thirst
of blood.I enjoy those moments I may haunt with these beats of the
night. What kinds of beings are existing at the deeps of my lakes?
They surely must be of an evil race, for no friendly thing can live in
such depressive waters. Here is also a planet similar to the moon, but
its phases is only one and it is in its most powerful for all and
ever... There passes no light without the barking of the wolves. All
these landscapes are timeless, and this is all just a part of cosmos,
but all is mine and past and future is yet to discover... Much have
been discovered, but tomorrow I will realise I existed before myself.I
will be reborn before I die.I will realise planets ages old, created
by a rules with a crown of dragon claws, arrived with a
stargate...Skull fragments are flying through the air
Brains and blood scattered just about everywhere you look
Swing of the hatchet gives permanent damage,
Head fractured, gaping hole
To incise the cranium
Slit open crushed eyeballs dripping hanging from the sockets
Steel cracked bone with fatal trauma to the cerebellum
Useful lust of gore
Hatchet to the head
Rekindled gore obsess rend the weak
Mutilate then murder consciously
Death brought to the enemies of the past
A life of beheading I must have
Pure revenge is burning inside me
Slit open crushed eyeballs dripping hanging from the sockets
Steel cracked bone with fatal trauma to the cerebellum
Useful lust of gore
Hatchet to the head
Hatchet to the head
Hatchet to the head
Hatchet to the head
Hatchet to the head
Forced from deep inside to hunt you
Bludgeoned torn apart veins erupted
Forever headless rotting corpse
Recognition you are now beyond
Wretched, onslaught, slaughter
Faceless flesh remains from the victims
Hacked with brutal force until slain
Consumed with anger, lunacy
Relentless killing dependency
Slit open crushed eyeballs dripping hanging from the sockets
Steel cracked bone with fatal trauma to the cerebellum
Useful lust of gore
Hatchet to the head
Hatchet to the head
Hatchet to the head
Hatchet to the head
Hatchet to the head
Chop it off!An incestuous relationship between mother and son
As last rites were read I had tell such a void
A loving mother, my life-giver and lover
She went away when she slashed her own wrists
The relationship with me was too much to bear
I watched her buried, her funeral, my heartbreak
As last rites were read I left such a void
I had to inimately feel her once again
I dig deep into my mothers sepulcher
Her cold, dead flesh soon stirs my lust
Stiffened legs spread to be fucked
My undying live, a son's sick obsession
Forcing myself into my mommy's rigor mortis twat
We are finally reunited once again
As i engross myself in interment intercourse
I unknowingly contract a supernatural disease
With incestuous necrophilism there is a price
Malodorous malediction from examinate cunts
An uncanny imprecation
The offensive stink fills my senses
With each stroke of my penis inside
"Mommy, sweet mommy" I scream as I ejaculate
Her flesh, healthy semen conditions her dry, rigid femme canal
Pleasure short lived
For when I pull out of the disinterred fuck
The smell that was created could sicken the dead
Forcing myself into my mommy's rigor mortis twat
We are finally reunited once again
As I engross myself in interment intercourse
I unknowingly contract a supernatural disease
With incestuous necrophilism there is a price
Maladorous malediction from examinate cunts
An uncanny imprecation
The offensive stink fills my senses
A lemme furnigation now terrible haunts
It clings to my lecherous privates
I will soon go mad from the revolting scent
As the post mortem matriarch leaves me rancid
Her embalmed vulva oozes, drains and leaks
Emitting an oder of an unearthly reek
This miasma adheres to my virility
An eeried anathema from the mortuary
As the post mortem matriarch leaves me rancid
Her embalmed vulva oozes, drains and leaks
Constant cleansing doesn't kill the smell
I cannot escape the feminine foulness
With crazed desperation
I set my genitals aflame
Hoping to burn away the venomous vapor
Reeling in pain as my pubis smolders
I curse the name of my desecrated mother
Forcing myself into my mommy's rigor mortis twat
We are finally reunited once again
As I engross myself in interment intercourse
I unknowingly contract a supernatural disease
With incestuous necrophilism there is a price
Malodorous malidiction from examinate cunts
An uncanny imprecation
The offensive stink fills my senses["The eldest sages of our kin say that the seeds of Val'inthor were stars that came to fall even before the birth of the sun. For one who has gazed upon the majesty of the Elder Tree, who have heard the playful laughter of our kin sounding through the open sylvan glades or seen the ivory robes that my daughter bears within these lands, such myth may readily seem as truth. For although Duviel, my beloved daughter joyfully wore the studded leather garments of elven scouts she was the queen of our kind"]
Midwood in autumn moon
Dawning upon silver dew
shimmering like fireflies
and golden leaves from up high
striding up to me
The lady of goldenwood
in shrouds of pearls and palest white
though she bears the mark of the wilds
She is the queen of her kind
["Among the highest branches, above the temple alcoves my youngest daughter, the elven princess Sariel, often sat and sang hymns and ballads of olden lore and was little concerned with the heavy burden bestowed upon her family. Her favourite song was that of the magical ivory flutes of Niaranden, the Naiden children - the elfkind"]
Sung by flutes of ivory
notes soar round the elder tree
stairs ascending to far up high
where golden leaves kiss the sky
The lady of goldenwood
in shrouds of pearls and palest white
though she bears the mark of the wilds
She is the queen of her kind
For the longest time we expected you Ilamrion, "Islander".
Your story planted with the very seeds of Val'inthor
On our journey I answered you with only silence,
For the ever present shadow scoured the valleys and moors
Asking your name.
Man will rise as one under the First-born's law,
unholy war brings to demise to elf and dwarf
Second-born from the shores beyond,
in his sacrifice a prophecy is undone
When night retrests,
Thousands have fallen on ivory ground
Dragon Son,
there can be only one
The lady of goldenwood
with words of death and palest gloom
And now as I leave her behind,
She remains in my mindThoughts of revenge, I bring
The mastery of my perception
Only thoughts of victory ring
I now see through the deception
Seek first, the Kingdom, and the rest, shall arrive
A sense of inner rage, is flowing
Your only chance, to stay alive
Prisoner of your own mind
Self control, I must attain, determine the goal, in peace to remain
Pressure will sustain, intimidation, the demons gain
Many voices but there is only one
The war of words, it has begun!
Mind battleground life or death
Place they seek to devour
Losing heart, false realities, from the start
Voices use the past,
So your future does not last
Fight back Fight back
Relentlessness that you lack
Your mind the battlefield, of life or death
Your mind the battlefield, of life or deathRide the wind
My aggressions mirrored themselves in her eyes
As the blade was ripping up her insides
Her eyes
Stabbing and stabbing
My love fell dead to the floor
Together with sheds of my sanity
Dead in the absence of agony
She's still here with me
As Hell turns to ice
Her dead eyes staring deep into my soul
Into the carved out hole
Sweeping forth, the wind without no name
My mind is raped by insanity
Now her blood flows in my veins
Her heart beats in my chest
Her voice screams within my mind
The wind without no name
Ride the wind
Now time itself touches my soul
It's ice cold breath in my ear
Oh, "God" I'm sorry, I lost control
I slayed love disguised as fear
The fire still burns within my soul
No wind to put it out
Now time itself touches my soul
It's ice cold breath in my ear
Oh, "God" I'm sorry, I lost control
I slayed love disguised as fearWrap the wire round the neck,
pull it tight to suffocate
His mouth is spewing steaming blood
Hang the body with a cord, gag his mouth
with shards of steel
He doesn't know the pain he'll feel
Interwoven deadly spikes, tightening cables
lacerate
Assorted gashes open wide
Ruptured veins are gushing blood, scraps of
skin are flying off
The body of the helpless prey
Jagged cable binds, you scream, No escape
Metal barbs tearing at you, Rend your flesh
Tear apart the tendons,
wire chokes the victim
Shred away his features,
shred away his being
Rip the tissue from the body, Rend your flesh
Lacerate, sharp spikes rip
Mutilate, pierce the skin
Mummified in the barbed wire
Breathing stops, life expires
Mummified in the barbed wire
Metal binds as you die
Tangled in a web of pain, No escape
Blood seeps through the metal sheath,
Saw-like noose
Tear apart the tendons,
wire chokes the victim
Shred away his features,
shred away his being
Gleaming cords encase the corpse, No escape
Lacerate, sharp spikes rip
Mutilate, pierce the skin
Mummified in the barbed wire
Breathing stops, life expires
Mummified in the barbed wire
Metal binds as you die
Steel wraps your face, blood soaks the steel
Bound in wire, soon to die, life choked out,
bleed to deathYOU HAVE ARRIVED, AT LAST

The issue got a barcode on funk mode
So now I pack a truckload of skunk, for the underground chumps
'Cause I bumps in any system, who dissed 'em?
Watch me back them up from all the way from New Jeru to Manhattan
Satin and silk, kill the best built

For all reasons, number one you're sleepin'
Speakin' like a deacon catch the drops my props leakin'
Seekin' on the deep end, sinkin' while I'm thinkin'
Of ways, to slay my competition without blinkin'
The ink's on the sheet with rhymes that are unique
Complete batter, astoundin' feats yo it don't matter
Capitalize, while I'm, categorized
The G L to the tame to the O N E
You know the time when we rock the spot
Artifacts, New Jeruz, catch wreck and get the props
You know the time when we rock the shit
Tame one and MC El we be the ultimate, ultimate
U-u-ultimate, u-u-ultimate, u-u-ultimate
U-u-ultimate, u-u-ultimateVisions.
Cryptic writings protect my life.
Clairvoyance is equal to evil.
Visions of the antichrist flash through my mind.
A great global fire.
Nostradamus, has a view of ages.
Nostradamus, knows when we'll die.Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost, but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see.
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved.
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.
Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come;
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home.
The Lord has promised good to me
His word my hope secures;
He will my shield and portion be,
As long as life endures.
Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
and mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.
When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we've first begun.No more heart broken songs, get over it, move on
Let's wipe those tears away from that pretty face
That pretty fucking face
No more crying to your dashboard records, you sappy emo bitch
We are all born alone and we all die alone
Forget about your problems just for one night
No more crying, only death and dying
Let's wipe those tears away
We are all born into this world alone and we all die alone
We are all born into this world alone and we all die alone
We are all born into this world alone and we all die alone
You're not the only one, everyone has their problems
So put a smile on that pretty fucking face
And look ahead to the future
We are all born into this world alone and we all die alone
We are all born into this world alone and we all die alone
We are all born into this world alone and we all die aloneKin, csd vre felkilt hozzm a Fldrl lgy teht tkozott a Fldn,

I should have broken your hand
Broken your leg
You shouldn't have split on the ground
You shouldn't have split to your face
I should have broken your hand
Broken your legDon't you worry he won't be back here anymore
Try a little harder go as far as you can go
a state of tolerance something which you'll never know
The mind has a way of playing games and twisting your reality
you're hooked like a fish and deep inside lies the pain
He's longing for reality no more abnormality
So sad to say you're no one's child reflection is a part of you
an' come what may your nations wild are killing you
More and more like a drug you're longing for who's it for
for pity sake, god knows who
Nowhere to turn too no one here that wants you
stay far away now way beyond normality
no one to talk too, talkin' cannot help you stay far away now
you've stepped beyond reality
Where limitations have no place the more extreme the more you do
you most certainly won't stand a chance of pulling throughIt's light as a feather, snaps right together, it's the one
It weathers the storm and the grimness of war, it's the one
It clears out the trenches with power and vengeance, it's the one
It lays waste to the temples and all those that dwell, it's the one
As a defoliant there is no accident, it's the one
It cuts down defences like razors through flesh, it's the one
Easy to conceal until death is revealed, it's the one
Structure, bone and plant, it lays everything flat out, it's the one
It's the only weapon of choice
It's the only weapon you'll need
It's the ultimate tool of destruction
It's the only weapon of choice
It discharges with ease and reloading's a breeze, it's the one
It will never jam it will never melt down, it's the one
It razes flesh from bone and mortar from stone, it's the one
It rolls through the town and lays everything flat out, it's the one
It never kicks back so precise its attack, it's the one
No pin is required no trigger desired, it's the one
Discharges with a thrust, turns matter to dust, it's the one
The kill rate's supreme and the death counts a dream, it's the one[Hook: Tiara Thomas]
Is it bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to you
I can't promise that I'll be good to you
Cause I had some issues, I won't commit
No, not having it
But at least I can admit that I'll be bad noooooo to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed but I'll be bad to you
Bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
[Verse 1: Fatal]
she been hurt, too many times,
she heard it all, knows all the lines,
and deep inside, loves on her mind
but she aint lookin........love is blind,
and shawty mine, without being mine
won't change her ways, but she a dime
and you say your fine, but I see the hurt,
we spendin time, cause I see your worth
puff, puff, pass...then we fuck and crash,
I don't commit, still I hope it lasts,
loves a jokes, but i love your laugh
and girl you bad, still my better half
what i rather have, no monogamy
you grindin slow, on top in me
love, someday? maybe, possibly,
but honestys, the policy,
i ain't tryin to be your man, girl i could just hit,
hand on your ass, i'm tryin to get a grip,
kissin, suckin, bitin on your lip,
make a few movies, wit no script
thats my bitch, fuckin right
count all day, fuck all night
You know i'm playin, but play along,
I never made love, girl am i wrong?
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Fatal]
I aint never made love, but ill fuck you right
ass so fat, and pussy so tight
we could do it all, if its only one night
fuck your man, you single tonight,
not quite, but oh well,
I wont tell if you dont tell,
late night, in the hotel,
gettin head, catrel
then i beat the pussy pronto,
fuck you all around the condo,
Go down south, call me sancho,
only give head, for the hancho
marlin brando, i'm a Don
like a light, turn me off, or on
never had love, am I wrong?
Thought I was, but the feelin gone,
better off alone, bad on my own
Be right there, when u call my phone
beat that pussy, grind and moan
when you wakin up, i'm gone,
I don't need love, i'm ridin solo,
still hoes, posin, like a photo
She a freak, only on the low tho
and if not, then its a no go
[Hook]Everything is broken
Chaos in my mind
Booze is a bitch
And my passion for life is dangerous
I have a feeling
That I do everything the other way round
The inner demon broke silence
And you broke into tears
If I push too much
I won't make any difference
Feelings of guilt ...
It seems so absurd and futile
I don't really know what else I should do
I better move on
Why can't things be as they used to be?
Everyone is so grumpy tonight
Hey fucker, something's gonna happen tomorrow
And you may understand the meaning of your dull life
It's freezing cold outside
I'm staggering down the street
Beaten up and lonely
My will conforming to the instinct of war
And limbs want to destroy
Blackout caused by a fall
Broken face, body bruised
An emotional fit taking turns
With burst of laughter
I'd like to cry but I don't know how to
The only solution is sleep
Then I'll board up window
And be your cute little boyThe world will never be free
The world will never have peace
The world will never be free
Because we are not one
The world will never be free
The world will never have peace
The world will never be free
Because we are not one
One, one, one, one
I looked behind my back and there he was
His screaming eyes could not be so bright
He was not stranger looking than you or me
With different thoughts and that wasn't right
This is the story of the world
Where actors come, and actors go
You are not trusted till you know
And even then you are alone
Sometimes a man is judged by the way he thinks
And this is why the world is not one
... but can not see
Taking no excuse because there's none
Our world is in the hands of fools
So many others besides you
They seldom give, but always take
There's only so much you can do
I used to ... of do it Jack
Everything that it can not see
And no one wants to stand uW and say they're wrong
So private's right before honesty
This is the story of the world
Where hide and seek's a way of life
Hide from everything that's real
And seek what others say is rightHow astonishing is the chance
Of leaving this world impress a sense
Of natural beauties on us; hallelujah!
I think of green fields; I muse
With the greatest affection on every flower
I have known from my infancy; hallelujah!
Their shapes and colours are as new to me
As if I had just created them
With a superhuman fancy; hallelujah!
It is because they are connected
With the most thoughtless and the happiest
Moments of life.
How astonishing is the chance
Of leaving this world impress a sense
Of natural beauties on us!
The simple flowers of our Spring
Are what I want to see again; hallelujah!
[Lyrics by John Keats (1795-1821)]I'm a son of a bitch ready to stitch
You muthers not ready to rock
I've shed all my tears & ain't got no fears
& they key to my heart bears no lock
Hell has granted me three wishes
Life - Death - Immortality
I will ride the wings of darkness
Fuck your blessed trinity
Coz I'm bursting - I'm bursting out
Coz I'm bursting - I'm bursting out
I'm a bastard & brave I'm nobodies slave
I'm telling you once & for all
Breaking the laws coz I know the score
Waiting on nobodies call
Hell has granted me three wishes
Life - Death - Immortality
I will ride the wings of darkness
Fuck your blessed trinity
Coz I'm bursting - I'm bursting out
Coz I'm bursting - I'm bursting out
Let's burst right out of here
"Let's go"Do you see the frozen nature?
Do you see the mirror on ice?
Yes I see...
I see the ravens in black sky...
When lakes feel the frost
When the snow falls on my soul
When the forest are in fire
I see the nature...
Oh, Khors, give me the strength
To kill the enemy inside of me
To destroy the lie of Jehova
To feel fire of war...
I see the burning man with horn -
He isn't man - he is God
God of sunlight, God of life & reality...
This God lives in me -
I see him every morning
And he dies every night...
Khors will come to shine,
My soul will see the light,
light of fire, light of reality...
One day all forests shall be mine...
One day all people will die...
One day the nature of our ancestors shall rebirth!
I will burn the flame, one day...
And SunGod, listen to me -
light your powerful flame, and please,
burn the heaven and Earth,
Oh, almighty Khors...A frozen Galaxy drifted
in Nature's amniotic seas
a universe of starry majesty
in the vast ocean of Space
Black planets rolled
without lustre and aim
in the yawning dark Void
It was the dawn of times
the dawn of Genesis
the age of mystery
Motionless stars
without name & knowledge
a cosmic empire
in the stifling black fluid
The world waited its own birth
in an icy, uninvaded sleep
And the Great Omnipotent slumbered
on the verge of the deep
A cosmic empire
a slumbering galaxy
A cosmic empire
in the cradle of eternity[Intro:]
This is Lotus
Dark fuckin Lotus
This is Lotus
Dark fuckin Lotus
[Monoxide Child:]
I need no introduction I'm from parts unknown
With the power to end it all like Ol' Jim Jones
I walk the dark side with both eyes closed
And down below I'm known as the unexplainable
[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
Comin out my mouth when I drool, sweatin out my pores
Show you different realms as I open up different doors
Hold onto your ores, cause your boat's sinkin
Faces meltin off cheeks when I'm speakin
[Blaze Ya Dead Homie:]
I'm still known for blood sippin
Don't matter, type A or a B, I ain't trippin
I got a thirst like a curse in control
Till I'm carvin up body parts and the heart from where it go
[Jamie Madrox:]
One drop will consume you
Two forever doom you
Standiin over the body as we drink to the voodoo
Livin with the demons and ghouls make me a custom
They eat whatever goes in the body after I cut them
[Chorus:]
They underneath the mortuary bumping this shit
Hot Poison
They built the Pyramids while bumpin this shit
Hot Poison
Way up on the mountain top they bumpin this shit
Hot Poison
When it comes to wicked bitch you know we the shit
Cause this is Lotus
Dark fuckin Lotus
We got your poison
[Violent J:]
We possess any room leave it freezing cold
First you'll get a bloody nose then your head will implode
We will stretch you, break your spine in five places
With tattooed bracelets and masked unpainted faces
[Blaze Ya Dead Homie:]
Utterly demented Dark Lotus has them submitted
On the minds of the serpents of the servant who ain't repented
You summon the seventh sign, the plagues of undead
With the pentagram as a reminder branded on your head
[Jamie Madrox:]
Open like an entrance
No truth will ever suffice for any skeptic except for death sentence
Fact in blood, splattered in ink blots
Spell out a four lettered word as the blood clots
[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
Me plus four more venomous pedals
We re-ablaze hell the same day it froze
We didn't pick our spots in this shit, we are chosen
Now come on down bitch and feel this Hot Poison
[Chorus:]
They underneath the morturary bumping this shit
Hot Poison
They built the Pyramids while bumpin this shit
Hot Poison
Way up on the mountain top they bumpin this shit
Hot Poison
When it comes to wicked bitch you know we the shit
Cause this is Lotus
Dark fuckin Lotus
We got your poison
[Monoxide Child:]
Plagues evolve from each septahydro
A psycho who likes to leave most without a dome
Mostly in your home when you're thinkin you're all alone
Apparate like a ghost and disappear with your soul
[Violent J:]
I caught Lucifer and threw a hook through his mouth
Cut it's belly open and cockroaches fell out
But I stomped em all with Jamie (Madrox) Joey (Shaggy) Paul (Monoxide) and Chris (Blaze)
Ain't no wicked shit like this
[Chorus:]
They underneath the mortuary bumping this shit
Hot Poison
They built the Pyramids while bumpin this shit
Hot Poison
Way up on the mountain top they bumpin this shit
Hot Poison
When it comes to wicked bitch you know we the shit
Cause this is Lotus
Dark fuckin Lotus
We got your poison
Cause this is Lotus
Dark fuckin Lotus
We got your poisonDo angels fly higher in the dark?
Black is my mind when a new day has come
Black are the tears when I cry
Come here and take my hand,
Join this misery
The fallen angel will set us free
Do angels fly higher in the dark?
Do they crash down and fall apart?
Let's cut the wings away
And the angel has fallen again
Together in eternal flames
Where the cold razor caresApathy this life is plain boredom
No will to live and I couldn't care the fuck less
It raped all my dreams and distorted my visions
Replaced my joy with sorrow
I'm drained on emotions no longer inspired
This life has no tomorrow
The confusion, what really happened inside my head
No solution, sometimes I wonder if we're all dead
Break me down just reap what I have sown
One last try before the final dawn
I reach down inside I take hold of myself
To leave this private hell
And when everything fails I seek trust in denial
Cause life had taught me well
Still confusion, what really happened inside my head
No solution, sometimes I wonder if we're all dead
Dehumanized, Broken
More dead than alive, I let go of this world
Fucked up inside cause the cuts are to deep
Deprived of my life I'm a negative creep
Depression had conquered the resistance inside
The pain is unreal yet I'm faking a smile
Still confusion, what really happened inside my head
No solution, sometimes I wonder if we're all dead
Dehumanized, Broken
More dead than alive, I let go of this world
Worn down - dehumanized - no more strength - broken
Unreal - more dead than alive - now - I let go of this worldWith chainsaw in hand
Your death I demand
Slicing through your fat
My awaited gore attack
Manipulating lies
Is your way of life
Riding on cheap glory
Your life is getting gory
Watch you bleed to death
Gasping for last breath
Choking on your blood
I shit onto your guts
Sacrificial cunt
I despise
Sacrificial cunt
No more lies
Slabs of fat
Lay on the ground
Ram an axe
Into your mound
Time to pay the gruesome price
A stupid cunt we sacrificeIncorporation
Analysis
Space/time, travel, silence, and freedom
Combinations
Flash back - fast forward
Repetition and rearrangement

FragmentationReach inside of me
Far beneath the encasing of ashes
Bleeding red
Still showing signs of life
Remove the darkness
Take me away
A Stream of Hope destroy this corrupted cell
Purification
(Leaving me desolate in the face of perfection)
Unable to hide I am drawn to the fire
It is this pain that brings me likely doTwo spheres are calling me to the "grounds" where I use to plead.
Madeleine, my animated sister, you're dim like the candle in my dreams.
You are the Succubus of twilight and eventide.
(The gypsy that deludes me with copulation)
So, let me form the contours of your trance
and lament with the virga that cries from a cloud.
Ginger trees exhibit eyeless shades of trust.
Sapphire flickers of light divorce the leaves from an Oak.
Kali Ma! Kali Ma!
You incise me with claw and nail.
You hold the rings of Siva.
You hold the shapes of melted wax.
Praise this disrespectful light for crashing down.
Tasseomancy!
Time frames shall warp you through the frames of time.
Tasseomancy!
Ta gaoth lugha lamhfhada ag eiteall anocht san aer!
Magdalens, Tu non lou dises pas de bon cor!
If the process of the incantations were done incorrectly,
then sketches of the moon whined with the melted ice (...oh, so slowly.)I flew on wings of the night
To find the place beyond the world
And so close I was
And so strong I felt
But only the hand touched
And in forbidden caves I found myself
Looking for the key
To the gate of a place beyond the world
And even nymphs dancing around me
Laughed at my melancholy
This day, this night,
I fly beyond the world
Hanging between the worlds
Sailing in dark air
Towards the place beyond the worldEveryone is happy in your favourite dream
It's a pleasant surprise with all your favourite scenes
just like a beautiful day without a cloud in the sky
and the only thing to blind you is the sun in your eyes
When your body's asleep all your thoughts are awake
travelling through stories that your mind likes to make
Take a look around, enjoy what you feel
is it just imagination or is everything real
Don't wake me up I want to dream
Don't wake me up I want to dream
I want this dream to last forever
Don't wake me up I want to dream
I want this dream to last forever
Don't wake me up
The skies are getting cloudy there's a storm on the way
The vision's disappearing in a strange kind of way
The perfect little picture that you paint in your head
is a distant memory when you get out of bed
Don't wake me up I want to dream
Don't wake me up I want to dream
I want this dream to last forever
Don't wake me up I want to dream
I want this dream to last forever
Don't wake me up before I understand what everything means
why does somebody always come and wake me up from my dreams
Don't wake me up I want to dream
Don't wake me up I want to dream
I want this dream to last forever
Don't wake me up I want to dream
I want this dream to last forever
Don't wake me up(Instrumental)You're here because
You're one of us
We are the strength
We are the soldiers
You've journeyed far
You've battled hard
And now you will receive the
Permanent reward
You've conquered pain
You've conquered fear
Stand proud and salute
The bloodied flag here
You pledged your death and
Your last breath
You are the gears
You are the gears
We fear not our mortality
We'll serve to the best of our ability
We give our lives to our masters
We vow to smite our enemies
You've mastered death
You've mastered fear
You are transformed
You are stronger
Now that you're here
A branded gear
Burned in your flesh
We'll seal the deal
You've conquered fire
You've conquered ice
You've tasted blood
You've taken life
You're here because
You're one of us
Become a gear
Become a gear
We fear not our mortality
We'll serve to the best of our ability
We give our lives to our masters
We vow to smite our enemies
We bless your skin
We bless you with our mark
Become a part of the clock
Become a gear
You've conquered pain
We've conquered pain
You've conquered fear
We've conquered fear
You fear not your mortality
Become a gear
(We are the gears)
You've conquered pain
We've conquered pain
You've conquered fear
We've conquered fear
You fear not your mortality
You are a gear
(We are the gears)
We bless your skin
We bless you with our mark
Become a part of the clock
Become a gear
(We fear not our mortality)It was so easy to do
And now
I got my hands deep in your gutsAt the mercy of our conscience
Confined within our fate
Never really questioned why
We are refugees in a dying world
To become a part of the end
Are we the ones, the ones to blame?
We are mortals of shadows and dust
The sun sets on our sinking ship of fools
On our journey into oblivion
We ask ourselves again and again
Now will we be rememberedSwam out to sea
To try and be me
To drown those that
Thought they could never sink
When in the deep
Weakness is easy to read
Coral blue grows in you
Coral blue tells the truth
Swam out to see
What karma would bring
It's jaws crashed down
On drowning bodies around me
When in the deep
Weakness is easy to read
Coral blue grows in you
Coral blue tells the truthIt's no wonder that you hang
Together, can't keep myself sane
I flee in solace forever
Life's short, so duck for cover
Walls have ears, and the ears have eyes
They're all allies against the same enemy
[Chorus]
I don't know what the future holds,
If you search for gold, better not sleep alone
I don't know you but I fucking hate you,
And what I am saying is it's been a blur.
I don't know you but I fucking hate you,
And what I am saying it was all a blur.
It's all about the opinion
I'm in solitary confinement
What I' am saying is
You and yours will face the judgment
Walls have ears, and the ears have eyes
They're all allies against the same enemy
[Chorus]
Self-loathing son of a bitch
Pick up the pace, pick up the pace
Obliterate the suffering now
This is a sacrifice
Burn it all away, I'll burn it all down
Separate the arrogance
Obliterate the suffering
This is a sacrifice
Burn it all away, I'll burn it all down
Separate the arrogance
I don't know you but I fucking hate you
You're a marked man, a marked man
You're a marked man, a marked man
I don't know you, I fucking hate you
I don't know you, I fucking hate you.Apology accepted
I'm elected
As the idiot affected
Blind & mean
Make a drunken scene
Mind & body are not connected
It crept up on me
Woke the demon seed
Acted like a dick so belligerent
Could have been much worse
Threw a plastic cup
Ate an apple pie
Could have thrown it up!
Drunk & Drunk & Stupid X2This mark of impailment burned
on my skin is immoral
The shackle of frailness confines one
to crawl with oneself
a smell of corrosion force
Fully clashes within
Sensorial conditions
Human emmisions grow thin
[Chorus:]
It's burned on your head
It's burned on your skin
It's burned on your eyes
A barcode never lies
A symbol of power
As dark as the night
No measure for intolerance
We'll keep up the fight
This structure of violence
Now becomes Silence is hurtful
Beginning obsession we now
learned our lesson Despite
A world of dominance
Will now pervade
Clouds cover the sun
The light begins to fade
This toilsome aggression is
now getting harder to fight
Solutions of ? combustion is rightlonesome under stars tent
walks through the silent hour
boy wakes out of weird dreams
his face decaying it seems
crazed woman with open hair
in the window staring barred
on the pond on sweet drive
lovers journeying wonderful
dark is the sound of springs rain in the night
drops of my blood falling onto golden plates
in myrial coffins a laughter whorish and wise
lust of my heart songs of madness and night
killer smiling bleach in the wine
the sick caught by mortal fear
nuns pray naked and wound
before gods pain on the crossDo you think it's fair,
To hold the world's fate in your hands,
Masses honour your name,
Having bloody wars in return
Don't touch me, don't scare me,
Just let me live my life alone,
It's my choice, not your gift,
I don't want to crawl under stone
Say my name I will answer,
Give a sign, you'll hear my prayer
The more they believe,
The less they live,
I swear I will surrender
Fire forever,
It's inside me, I'm my own master
I trust no one but me / fire
The road is long, my heart is stronger,
I'll have the faith forever
They're spreading the holy word,
Expecting money in return,
If it is the way to love,
Sorry I don't understand
Don't touch me, don't scare me,
Just let me live my life alone,
It's my choice, not your gift,
I want to lead my future
Say my name I will answer,
Give a sign, you'll hear my prayer
The more they believe,
The less they live,
I swear I will surrender
Fire forever,
It's inside me, I'm my own master
I trust no one but me / fire
The road is long, my heart is stronger,
I'll have the faith forever[N.A.R.D. / Johnny P]

But its hard to listen when you tryin to get that platinum benzy
Or purchase a home for my belo luxury home with a platinum visa
Its hard to imagine something like a nigga tryin to catch an orgasm
Track that feeling like a spasm
Tryin to study passin, got a passion gotta count that cheese
They off in the breeze but it ain't nothing
If you got that paper then say something
Better put it away Cause the day comin when you fall off,
When you just want to hall off with four sawed offs blow it all off
Recognise its the big faces that count, better yet better stay flexed
Check the paper stay stressed and get all the dough whether its fast or slow
Get up to the point where the cash will flow
Burger King and Mcdonalds really ain't the way the best will go
And its so cold in these windy streets
When the ends meet your life will be ends deep with white shit
[Chorus]
[Belo Zero]
This is my motto, pop the first bottle
Louie call 1 3 grab the key then follow
Ride up to my home paid for mansion celebrating you ladys on tables dance on
M O N E why got to have it me I remember hustlin when I was a shorty
Now or a forty X5 5 of those sit back relax and private show
No how it go more money more problem well the problem is you solve it
Don't let the money become you you take it and revolve it
No matter how you get it you hustle and go get it square stick with it
Make sure all the numbers split Cause all of them done did it
The Rockafellers Stellers and Jones
To many other people got paper but we homeless
And let alone this, we chillin while we swervin bumpin 92.3 in the suburban
Hittin curbs in city fresh why'all Proda to the feet bonapetite
No second guess why'all we confess why'all love the curency don't you playa hate
Love the game you can't worry me, you can't worry me
[Chorus]

J P, J P
Everybody may not have a great big Cadillac
Gangsta white walls, TV's and antennas in the back (uh uh)
Some peoples may not have a car at all
But they got to remember brothers and sisters (remember)
We still can pimp talk, rotate them gangster white walls
Never givin a dime to a broad (no no never)
And we gone keep on pimpin baby (keep pimpin)
We gone keep on pimpin baby (for real)
Until somebody turn the lights out, so J. P. come on bring us home

Are too bad to be true
Like a dose of poison
I consider killin' you
I take myself away
In the shadow of disgrace
I'm faced by something
That jumps around me
While I'm waitin'
And dissipating
I never knew what's like
Talking to myself
Unknown there is one
Devoted to me
To be delivered from me
You've been waiting for such a long time
Taking control of my soul
Every time I'm driving insane
I lay beneath the upcoming scene
It's happening once in a while
I'd take the train but I don't care
I'm watchin' my past passing by
Waiting for you to come
To take me over
Can't escape your sphere
Recommended suicide
I'm faced by something
That jumps around me
While I'm waitin'
And dissipating
I take myself away
In the shadow of disgrace
All of my tomorrows
Are too bad to be true
Like a dose of poison
I consider killin' youNow I'm defeated
Brake are my wings
Kneeled is my soul
I cry tears of blood
Close in cosmic void
I can feel my hate grow
Down in fire and ice
Only up again
I will fly so higher
'till touch the stars
Wounded is my body
Scar is my soul
But stronger is my spirit
I will rise again
I'll gaze into space now
'till take the stars
The Almighty has broken our wings
And destroyed our shields,
But we are not completely defeat:
We'll rise, shoulder swords against his angel
And will have our Kingdom in the Heaven
And our freedom as the stars in sky.
Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven"
In Cosmic Void I lie"
I'll have my vengeance
I'll defeat God
I'll will rise up on His Throne
And I'll hold His old Kingdom
As Demon in Hell and Angel in Heaven
I'll hold my reign in peace or blood:
Fight for me brothers, together we will win
A new order will come,
With our victory.
Total war for reign
Total war for peace
Down in fire I descend
And up in sky I take my soul:
My spirit fly over snow-covered plain
And on shining landscape
Is the time for all mankind to rise and fight this war"
But my soul is tremble
In front of might of God,
Weak appear my spirit
Beneath Universal Force.
I won't fall in darkness
But never I'll may win.
I cuoldn't surrender
And so I have fought"
Close in cosmic void
I can feel my hate grow
Down in fire and ice
Only up again
I will fly so higher
'till touch the stars
Wounded is my body
Scar is my soul
But stronger is my spirit
I will rise again
I'll gaze into space now
'till take the stars
I must fight against His sons
And I had to fall: war will be done
Sacrifice my soul to evil forces
Take their powers
We'll become stronger,
We'll destroy our enemies:
We'll make a desert called peace.
Our swords will call their names,
This will be our Hell"You sold your soul to a stranger
You confused life with danger
You made the wrong decision
Forever being held in derision
From one extrem to another
Not a moment left to recover
It will never let you go forever
Flowing with the flow
Your world revolves around me
Your life's gyrating round me
Your whole existence's a void
I'm gonna suck you in
I'm gonna spin you round
I'm gonna turn you up
I'm gonna spit you out
Once inside you turn faceless
You become part of the vortex
It's like an eternal treadmill
That never comes to a standstill
And it is useless to resist
As the pressure will persist
It will never let you go forever
Flowing with the flow
Your plans dissolve without me
You lose your dreams inside me
Your mind has been destroyed
I'm gonna suck you in
I'm gonna spin you round
I'm gonna turn you up
I'm gonna spit you out
This is the end of your world
Everything has been upturned
Submit yourself to new rules
Get used to a set of new toolsIn time you'll find I hate my life
Unless you break away I drown myself in my own mistakes
It's time to find
not to hide
Time for you to see
You learn my life
Now don't you walk away from me
[Chorus]
I can't break away
(I can't break away)
Lest you take the blame
Locked inside this shell
(Locked inside this shell)
On my way to hell
Help me I want to work this out
I can not help to feel abandoned by my own destiny
It's eating me
Just can't be free
Looking at the sky
Desperation is my only natural high
[Chorus]
Again we're standing side by side
It's time for us to bleed
A severed tie between two like-minds
I never felt I had to feel
What it's like to see
Our minds corrupt
But nothing's holding onto me
[Chorus]
THESE SCARS!
THESE SCARS!
THESE SCARS!
THESE SCARS!
These scars invade my direction
These scars help the infection
These scars live my troubled life
THESE SCARS!Spawned wanton like blight on an auspicious night
Her eyes betrayed spells of the moon's eerie light
A disquieting gaze forever ghosting far seas
Bled white and dead, Her true mother was fed
To the ravenous wolves that the elements led
From crag-jagged mountains that seemingly grew in unease
Through the maw of the woods, a black carriage was drawn
Flanked by barbed lightning that hissed of the storm
(Gilded in crests of Carpathian breed)
Bringing slaves to the sodomite for the new-born
On that eve when the Countess' own came deformed
A tragedy crept to the name Bathory
Elizabeth christened, no paler a rose
Grew so dark as this sylph
None more cold in repose
Yet Her beauty spun webs
Round hearts a glance would betroth
She feared the light
So when She fell like a sinner to vice
Under austere, puritanical rule
She sacrificed
Mandragora like virgins to rats in the wall
But after whipangels licked prisoners, thralled
Never were Her dreams so maniacally cruel
(And possessed of such delights)
For ravens winged Her nightly flights
Of erotica
Half spurned from the pulpit
Torments to occur
Half learnt from the cabal of demons
In Her
Her walk went to voodoo
To see Her own shadow adored
At mass without flaw
Though inwards She abhored
Not Her coven of suitors
But the stare of their Lord
"I must avert mine eyes to hymns
For His gaze brings dogmas to my skin
He knows that I dreamt of carnal rites
With Him undead for three long nights"
Elizabeth listened
No sermons intoned
Dragged such guilt to Her door
Tombed Her soul with such stone
For She swore the Priest sighed
When She knelt down to atone
She feared the light
So when She fell
Like a sinner to vice
Under austere, puritanical rule
She sacrificed
Her decorum as chaste
To this wolf of the cloth
Pouncing to haunt
Her confessional box
Forgiveness would come
When Her sins were washed off
By rebaptism in white
The looking glass cast Belladonna wreaths
'Pon the grave of Her innocence
Her hidden face spat murder
From a whisper to a scream
All sleep seemed cursed
In Faustian verse
But there in orgiastic Hell
No horrors were worse
Than the mirrored revelation
The She kissed the Devil's phallus
By Her own decree
So with windows flung wide to the menstrual sky
Solstice Eve She fled the castle in secret
A daughter of the storm, astride Her favourite nightmare
On winds without prayer
Stigmata still wept between Her legs
A cold bloodedness which impressed new hatreds
She sought the Sorceress
Through the snow and dank woods to the sodomite's lair
Nine twisted fates threw hewn bone die
For the throat of Elizabeth
Damnation won and urged the moon
In soliloquy to gleam
Twixt the trees in shafts
To ghost a path
Past the howl of buggered nymphs
In the sodomite's grasp
To the forest's vulva
Where the witch scholared Her
In even darker themes
"Amongst philtres and melissas
Midst the grease of strangled men
And eldritch truths, elder ill-omen
Elizabeth came to life again"
And under lacerations of dawn She returned
Like a flame unto a deathshead
With a promise to burn
Secrets brooded as She rode
Through mist and marsh to where they showed
Her castle walls wherein the restless
Counted carrion crows
She awoke from a fable to mourning
Church bells wringing Her madly from sleep
Tolled by a priest, self castrated and hung
Like a crimson bat 'neath the belfry
The biblical prattled their mantras
Hexes six-tripled their fees
But Elizabeth laughed, thirteen Autumns had passed
And She was a widow from god and His wrath, finallyA bounded sphere of wisdom
Spinning to create the now
Upon it all will wonder who, what, where, and how
Liquid covers most of her features
Sunlight covers one site at a time
Breathes in to keep everything closer
So it's never far away from
"Earth"!!! That little planet on the hill
Turning out days to guide by
Each with its own display
Some with voltage spinning from the skytop
Some with light in a peaceful way
An appearance second to no other
Such a magnificent face
So broad and full of perspective
Known to everyone as...
"Earth"!!! That little planet on the hill
Seems Earth could last forever
But for us it's not the same
The neglect to protect the creation
Leaves us little chance to remain
All in all it seems to go around in circles
Like the path followed by the moon
Enhanced by the human evolution
The wisdom of the

Set pits on fire, burn martyr masses
"Here comes a world of uncontrolled oppression in chaos"
Can you hear the damned bells, talling for the end of these days?
Can you feel the Hellfire's beat raging under your feets?
The earth shaking, Legions from the abyss rush to retaliate under the mark of Satan's empire.
Blasting spawn breeding fear and terror
The gallows are waiting to get the holy souls
The abyss open wide, leads the existence across the wicked damnation,
let the blood run free on the invincible strength of our horde
Of our horde
My regards upon this prophecy has become my enjoyment
A desire to feel some living flesh grinding under our metallic jaws
is growing with me
Tearing apart angelic hearts in offer to the Horned One
In offer to the Horned One!!!
A final age of anger rises through the Beast
This is the 666th generation since the Earth's last collapse
Hellbent for a reign of heathen entities.
The abyss down this world reduces existence to ashes
Let the blood run free on the heretic plateau of our forceThings that I thought I had put far behind
Find the mind, connect to sever
I felt deeply how my feelings combined
That it's like they'll never sever
In a way I started today
To weave guirlands for the grave
It will break me till my knees bend
It will leave me with nothing in the end
In a blatant mind, my thoughts have entwined
But if you feel the real they will divide
From beyond within, the heart plays its part
The real and fake forever severI did taste their only dream
As denial was still unborn
Secrets beyond those dethroned walls
And echoes of a martyr's scream
Deterrent vibrates the allurements face
As my barque drowns toward conquest
Don't quieten the elder's tears
For they've foreseen our past
Covered lies our remembrance
As symbols turn to dust
I won't dance
I won't dance
I won't dance within despair
I won't dance
The elder's orient
Journey into a wicked world
My body beneath the skies
Erotic wishes, my heart has failed
Incalculable is the surface's breath
Paralyzed form - the ring of death
Steps on the stairs to my silent ecstasy[Monoxide Child:]
I hear the words are spoken
I think my mind is broken
I keep on steady smoken
Hopefully I die from choken
Know what I was just thinking
Maybe if I keep drinking
The voice will quit and I can escape from this demon deakin
My lifes a living hell
Only the voice can tell
Oh please oh christ compell
Lead me from this evil spell
My body won't stop shaking
These voices keep on making
Me do things to people, this must just be the work of satan
[Jamie Madrox:]
They want my mind an soul this shit is way out of control
I haven't been to sleep in weeks, i'm sweating but my body's cold
I'm shaking like a leaf, terrified to go to sleep
Puking from the medication my vitals signs are looking weak
I see him in the mirror, he told me come inside
He lives inside my head so there's no where to hide
They want my soul to die so they can come alive
Possess my body, so everybody can realize
[Chorus:]
They say they'll give me pain
They say they'll give me love
They say they'll make me bleed
And tell me i'm above
They take me down again
This is my medicine
I cut the head off the devil and I throw it at you!
They say they'll give me pain
They say they'll give me love
They say they'll make me bleed
And tell me i'm above
They take me down again
This is my medicine
I cut the head off the devil and I throw it at you!
[Violent J:]
I take so many zoloft
I bleed my nose off
I run up in a church and rip my fucking clothes off
The demon follows me right to the house of God
But then it swallows me and takes me to the Lotus Pod
What can I do when my brains shakes my earth quakes
My lips crack, my skin dries up and flakes
Sleepless, 6 days of weakness
I pin eyelids open, with rusty paperclips
[Blaze Ya Dead Homie:]
The demons coming for me, they want to take my body
Hands reaching up behind me sufficate the breath upon me
They sqeaze my vocal chords until I want to scream
Call upon the dark lord please wake me from my dream
I'm steady popin no-doze, I never want to sleep
Mental pressure over comes the brain, the evil creeps
Body shakes for me uncontrol I need to pop another pill
Demons here to take my soul to late I need a refill
[Reverse Message:]
Spoken are the words
In the hands of pythona
Are the magic spells
To unlock the keys to the universe
It awaits, it will be summoned
By the pedals of the lotus
The night candles clean mind and soul
Shall invoke the power
[Chorus]
[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
I sit alone in the closet so I can hear what they saying
I'm rocking back and forth helpless will it, infest my ahhhh
My momma told me it would pass its been 17 days
The bag of the tynonel bottles don't say shit about a soul rape
Tell me what the fuck I'm supposed to do now (how)
Act how (now) go where (here) be with who listen more to me or you?
Father tell me whenever will I be back to normal (never)
I guess I'm cursed to live with this headache forever
[Anybody Killa:]
I can't sleep at night
Cause all these sounds in the darkness
Wake up in a cold sweat
Body feeling heartless
Pop a couple sleeping pills to try an relax
Every time I doze off something's breathing down my back
Could it be the afterlife or just a soul living inside of me
Praying for the day to take us both out of our misery
Could it be the evil ways of past on friends?
Or maybe all the lives I took are coming back for they revenge
[Chorus]
Give me pain
Give me love
Make me bleed
Take me above
Take me down
This is my medicine
I cut the head of the devil and I throw it at you!

She has done so many things it's so unreal
She has been almost everywhere
And tasted everything
She has been a dream since birth
Who could conquer anything
Night after night after every single night
She never gave up
Fight after fight after motherfucking fight
She came out on top
One rule one way of life
Only the strong survive
Never back down never back down
Destroying everything
Blood all the blood every single drop of blood
She sucks it up
Breath every breath every single damn breath
She screams with love
One rule one way of life
Only the strong survive
Never back down never back down
Destroying everything
Nobody in this world will ever stop her
Nobody in this world will ever touch her
Everybody in this world will want to be her
Everybody in this world just needs to see her
She's everything
And she'll destroy the world
Never back down never back down
Destroying everythingFirst World War ...
Second World War ...
Third World War ...
Fourth World War ...
War between the big and small
War between long hairs and skins
War over nothing but shit
War between the fat and thin
They sit and stare up at the sky
They sit and listen to the stars
Like children at the age of five
Whose minds haven't traveled so far
They sit and stare up at the sky
They sit and listen to the stars
If anyone there could see things clear
You can bet they wouldn't fly here
Hungry raid the satisfied
Conflict in the movie lines
Whites hate those not purified
War over two cheap wines
They sit and stare up at the sky
They sit and listen to the stars
Like children at the age of five
Whose minds haven't traveled so far
They sit and stare up at the sky
They sit and listen to the stars
If anyone there could see things clear
You can bet they wouldn't fly hereAll rise and come to order
Bailiff start the video recorder
You've been sworn, what's your
complaint?
Speak up son, don't hesitate!
He presided in his courtroom so long ago
He was hanging cowboys for stealing
buffalo
Court is adjourned, for his honor's
feeling ill
The shaking old relic needs a glycerin pill!
Hang up your rope 'cause you're
looking tired
If it was up to me they'd all be fired
Day after day convicting all those liars
This ain't TV jail
It's TV hell!
Chorus
Believe it or not
Those walking blood clots
Make enough money for a thousand
foot yacht
Who in Hollywood
Did they every acquit?
Just senile, judicial idiots
As the drama unfolds
And the law he upholds
If you look real close
You could see him growing mold
Small claims messiah
Is only a pariah to be ridiculed...
Objection Overruled!
All rise as he takes the bench
To hear his old voice make my
gut wrench
Silence to those who are in his court
I'm found guilty by his report
No washed-up judge can say to me
The shit he throws arround when
he's on TV
What can he fucking do, throw me in jail?
I'd slap out his dentures, post them
for bail!
Hang up your robe 'cause you're
looking tired
If it was up to me they'd all be fired
Day after day convicting all those liars
This ain't TV jail, it's TV hell!
Chorus
You lose the case
To a bigger bullshit they you today
When it comes to the end
You tell all of TV land what you've
got to say
When you're dead and gone
Will they get another fossil to carry on?
They must go to school
To hand-pick these old fools
I say to you
Objection Overruled!
It's all Perry Mason's fault!
Cat stranglingThe sterilized scalpel glistens in the light, Plasma issues forth as it
plunges into my skin, Slicing the meat, I gleefully smile, Covering my body
with carefully made incisions... The epidermis snaps back to make way for a
gaping hole, Osseous tissue revealed as sanguinary fluid flows, My stomach
painfully contracts as I regurgitate, Glazing my exposed dermis with acidic
vomitate... Defecation in hand, Clutching moist feces, Stuffing the shit, In
my freshly made slits... Splashing about, basted in blood, Avulsed flesh drips
from my lacerations, My fetish is fed, to skillfully rend, Sublime pain,
masochistic satisfaction... Blood drenched stool lines my wounds, The odor of
decaying discharge looms, The fecalith acts as my suture, My cuts erupt in
gangrenous sores...[Instrumental]A beginning brings forth questions.
Answered are these with lie upon web.
Shiver, does the child draped in it's disgrace.
The web grows like a poisonous vine fed by storybook filth,
tangling it's hypocritical mass around the throat
of human instinct like a self-perpetuating noose.
The one dangling in rage, refusing to choke,
gains a dagger to sever all ties to the vine of self-deceit.
Consuming the melody of shrieking horror
the blade penetrates as he becomes in harmony with his action.
The constant twilight of the forbidden is unveiled,
revealing darkness to be ravished forever by the intellect of
Blackeyes
Disgusted by the pathetic pleading swollen holes of the "holy"
Blackeyes
Prepared to protect any path he hath chosen.
Blackeyes
Contempt for all benevolent spinners now clinging to the vine.
Feeling, Seeing, Knowing, Being
Lift your sword, slice the vine.
Feast on pleasure, swim in life's wine.
Take your vengeance now and rise,
torment those who fear Blackeyes
All who waste life on bended knees
are begging for death to take them,
so be it go humbly to your god in white.
Look to my Blackeyes for a reflection of your fright.
Run christian soldier, for our army approaches!
Smile christian daughters for the snapshot of your annihilation.
Know this slaves of christ.
Our pulse quickens with the thought of your death.
Prey pawns on your knees!
Prey to the god you fear to protect you!
Blackeyes bring forth hell inside catacombs of a web now sighing
with the weight of helo's drenched in blood of a million spinners.
Join us little children, or be sent
to your empty promise land in tears of Red
Lift your sword, slice the vine.
Feast on pleasure, drink life's wine.
Take your vengeance now and rise,
torment those who fear Blackeyes
What be is Free
Join us little children before it's to late,
and we shall send you in tears
of red straight to heaven's gate.The commerce is over
Peace is the plan
I wonder how long will it last
When Izzy and Bizzy and Boney(?) began
We wondered how long they would last
Chuff had a cough
And cold in his snout

Now that i am sure of my fate
I'll get it straight
Defined and freed from blind belief
(arabic singing)Okay, we can stop now, time to this stop and go
We can stop pretending to be sane on this cold worn sidewalk
We look like fools today, much like yesterday
Much like the times they proved us wrong
We said it couldn't happen, they made it happen
History speaks louder than any other word
Not bound and gagged by passivity or hesitance
Dust bowls blow with our conjecture
And I look around and see rust building up
We can't move even if we try, move
We can't move even if we try, move, agitate
The praise over the recent demonstrations in Seattle
Are testament to the lack of of realism within the hearts
And minds of many activists fighting for social justice around the world
Though the demonstrations were successful in that they did
Postpone the WTO conference and brought important issues
To the front pages of virtually every major newspaper for a full week
They offered only marginal success, as the WTO still convened
And exists as it did long before the demonstrations sparked
Discussion and then quickly faded with all the expectancy
If any other news story, though progress is indeed a process
We must remember that our steps towards justice are indeed only steps
And are only noteworthy in that they will lead us to the next step
In praising simple and limited achievements as great strides
We ultimately put ourselves at risk of being discouraged
To continue after learning that our greatest efforts
Usually yield only marginal resultsLike a mist on moonlit sky
mystified the essense of light
glorified never satisfied
beauty embraced by the night.
The one that lived in darkness
was harmed by bright innocence
Then the twilight of life turned
into black velvet unfoldt.
Lonely whispers of night... hear me and guide
Once so glorious will be passe
away to the dark river of time
once so mightfull washed
by the cold stream of life.Here I am

The holy trinityI want to fuck up everything that you ever loved
I want to lose my head go for the bat and crush your head
Relax for a while think it over
All the vicious circles I'm trembling in are going further down
The last words you ever spoke still echo in my head
The world has turned and left me here
So stiff and cold
Find hope, find a cure, find happiness
For my ragged, tortured soul
Tell the world I'm sorry
For blowing it all away
Tell the world I'm sorry
When I'm out of your way
I can feel the weight of the world on my soldiers
And it's crushing me
Faith is not enough, give me strength so my heart
Can keep pounding on
It's time to step back a minute or two
To think it over
All the vicious circles I'm trembling in
Are going further downStanding in the Heads of the graves, As I count the Universal Dreamscapes,
I watch the Silent Journey of Souls, with Joy an Pity for their Eternal quest.
A thousand years of Misery ago, I was Created From Moon Dust.
My Mother was the blood of my enemies, and the Fire of the sun, my Father.
An invisible chain forged in thorns, embrace and unite my crimson memory,
to the crypts of Insanity and delirium, where I can't find the Reality....
Dark Motions, Black eyes, and and mournful Lust, The wings of solitude.
I'm cursed to follow the Dead, to see how they vanish to their Destiny...
To feel and envy their final trip, 'coz I'm not allowed to see the final gate.Bastards of a lying breed
You've ruled us for too long
Truth to you are lies to me
And your right is so wrong
Moral preached by immoral fucks
All I feel is despise
Lie no more you fucking cunts
You tear me up inside
Your sons die from your abuse
But you're giving us the blame
The easy path's the one you choose
That road will lead to pain
You're trying to control their mind
And strip them of free will
The way you force them to go blind
Will surely get them killed
My mind is free and so is my soul
You can't put me in chains
I won't play the well-adjusted role
Or bow my head in shame
So throw your stones of guilt at me
Point your finger, curse my name
Your scapegoat I will never be
I won't take the blame
Now we're on trial to serve your crime
And pay for your mistakes
There is no way we'll do the time
The chains of lies will break
Censorship can't stop our truth
We speak straight from the heart
There is nothing you can do
We'll tear your souls apart
Censorship can't stop my truth
We speak straight from our hearts
There is nothing you can do
We'll tear your souls apart
So see us rise, we're few but strong
We'll crack your fucking teeth
And feed you with your twisted tongue
Until you cannot breathe
The fury makes our eyes see red
It burns within our hearts
Soon you'll all be stone cold dead
We'll tear your souls apart[Music: Webster]
[Lyrics: Webster]
I am lost and sickened
Disoriented by this bleak environment
How I came to be here escapes my memory
This is a desert, deep scarlet grains
Stretch the horizon and the sickly brown sky
Gale force winds pepper my face
The sand tastes foul,
the sand tastes like blood
Savagely cruel, barren expanse, the atmosphere,
a caustic fog
Every breath reminds me of pain
Dust of dried blood filling my lungs
On the horizon I see a chasm, a distant pulse
begins to beat
[Lead - Owen]
Suddenly a flash, specter of the past
Vision of mass murder, torrents of blood
The vision quickly ends,
the wasteland still beckons
Plodding toward the chasm
I hear rushing liquid
My mind cannot conceive,
the massacre I behold
An infinite river of cadavers,
buoyant in their own blood
Vertigo engulfs my brain as
my body fails and drops
[Lead - Barrett]
A million corpses staring
Straining to survive,
limbs flailing in the blood
Grapple with headless bodies
Hands of the dead are pulling me downward
Drowning in this river
Intestines are alive, like tentacles they choke
Situation hopeless
I submit to the fury of the river
Paralyzed with terror
Thousands of their thoughts
are entering my mind
Conscious on their level
Every tortured death is experienced at once
Drowning in their anguish
Ordeal of their deaths now saturates my brain
Vengeful corpses shrieking
Genocide, genocide, genocide, genocideI can catch rolls from outside
I'm here for a long time, setting in the dark
And lost again in my dreams...
Till my birth I was waiting, I was waiting for the final act
And tonight I will meet the greatness,
I've chosen to do all that's possible
To keep higher the flame of liberty
But my destiny was not to survive.
So, I'm ready but I still have questions...
Is it the right way?
Have I respected the rules?
And if, would it not be the last passage?
Tonight, the final act, tonight, on the way
Tonight... the return
Tonight, on the way with the gods
Tonight... the return
Tonight, tonight...alone and free!
Tonight, the final act, tonight, on the way
Tonight... the return
Tonight, on the way with the gods
Tonight, I'm on the way
Tonight, to the other side
I don't want to know... why?
It's all the same for me
Why?... don't believe in me
Why?... Please, look inside... You've already met me!Everything Suffering, Everything is suffering
I am a temple, I am desecration.
I am a temple conceived through destruction.
I am the wretch among your pure.
I am the symptom for which there's no cure.
I am the blessed and I am the sick.
I am the blessed son of a bitch.
Everything Suffering Suffering, Everything is suffering
I am an image I'm burned in flame.
I am a bastard, a breed of shame.
I am the broken among your hope.
I am the lost among your soul.
I am the blessed and I am the sick.
I am the blessed son of a bitch.
Everything Suffering Suffering, Everything is suffering
I am a temple.
I am the temple.In a dream he cherished illusions,
Gloomy premonitions of a funeral storm,
His hatred sticked without respite,
Filled by the suffering, the screams and the shocks
Of these lower creatures who sleep without dreaming.
As this far and diaphanous star flood the landscape with its misty light,
I see the frightened souls wandering through the swamps,
Sports of a funeral lord.
The sharp flicks of the hoofs blend with the long screams of agony,
With the eternal lamentations of the blind Morpheus,
Captive of an invisible dungeon from which he was formally the master.
The flutes measure of this grim hunt,
That no blood will soil,
A requiem of a dreamed dance.
Any salvation will come to clear the profane wound,
And its essence will bear the sign forever,
Invisible but primordial at the eyes of the Last,
King of the suffering souls,
THE KING, ON THE THRONE OF SORROWFor all those who cried aloud
But whose tears were never heard
For questioning one almighty father
Of a heavenly distanced world
Beloved thee who submit
The holy writings assured
The golden cross stained with innocent blood
But stand yet a thousand heavenward
Burning naked but smiling
Not full of fear but pride
Knowing death alone could cleanse them
Of the reasons for which they all die
For all those who died
For all those whose great beauty
Stirred their tortures to rage
And for all those whose great ugliness
Did the same
For all those who cried aloud in vain
For mercy on the rack
But whom of dying naked in scorn
Not ashamed
Burning naked but smiling
Not full of fear but pride
Knowing death alone could cleanse them
Of the reasons for which they all died
For all those who died
Pleas for mercy signs of guilt
Naked bodies broken on the wheel
Tears sign the confession
With crusted blood lips sealed
Trial by waterI'll Take My Chances
Let's take it back to the summer of the end of the world
The first thoughts would be friends, east tour, and a girl
With sleepless nights and meaningless fights about my restless legs
Stealing tents and hopping fences,
wasting our heads with no time to lose
Because it's two more years until the
best part of me is the past part of me and you
And it's nights like tonight
when the stars shine brighter
and they spell your name
I think derogatorily because I
know it won't ever be the same Forever is a cinder block on string,
a broken heart seems a necessity
But I'm tired of losing sleep
I'm still breathing, but please rest assured
I'm left with an "x" amount of feelings
of the nights never heard
When I was torn between the heart
on my sleeve, the stone cold dilemma
that kept me neck deep
On the long drive home when you said you were fine
And the songs so slow, to help you think over time
But baby we both know we'll never let this go
Just keep your friends out of your ear
while I keep mine out of mind
A range of four days is a long and
unexpected holiday, one that you shouldn't take But if the outcome feels okay,
to turn the page, to walk away Then I'll have no choice but to keep keeping sad, s
traight glances, when I'm out the door
I'll take my chances
With blank stares and sideways glances,
to keep it up would be to take it for granted
To be the one to try and keep us afloat,
but the part of me that wants it picks fights
with the part of me that won't
So carve my name in the palm of your hand,
squeeze your fist until you understand that we were something special, you were one of those girls,
I was your Gosling, you were my worldWenn ich nachts nach Zielen forsche
Und durch deine Wlder streife
Find ich Frieden fr mein Herz
An Orten, wo kaum Menschen wandeln
Thringen ist nur der Name
Fr eine ganz besondre Schlacht
Die ich jeden Tag aufs Neue fhre
Mal siegreich, oft auch unterlegen
Das "T" steht fr die Treue, die ich mir selber schuldig bin
"H" steht fr die Heimat, die du fr mich bist
"" fr berlebenswille, jeder Tag ein neuer Krieg
"R" steht fr die Rache, and denen, die im Wege sind
"I" steht fr Intellekt, Dumpfheit fr die breite Masse
"N" steht fr Natur, mein Born an Kraft und Strke
"G" steht fr den Glauben, an mich und an mein Leben
"E" steht fr Eisregen, die grte Macht im Staat
und "N" steht fr die Nacht, die unsre Wunden heilt
Es ist das Leben selbst die grte Schlacht
Und viele sind lngst ausgeschieden
Der Staat sucht stndig neue Wege
Um dir die Freiheit zu beschneiden
Was bleibt dir noch an Idealen?
Was ist brig von der Rebellion der Jugend?
Nur du selbst, und dafr lohnt es sich zu leben
Denn Feigheit berlasse denen
Die in der Idiotie der Masse untergehen....Can't believe there is a future
for the children of today
Corrupted politicians are standing in their way
don't let the system fool You,
all that they want is to rule You
They're blinding their eyes for glory,
a brief moment of success
Is all their fame and fortune a substitute for happiness?
For once in their lives, why can't they realize?
The answer is love, Yeah love!
Oh Father, whom art in heaven
behold this world in need
of peace and understanding
instead of hate and greed
Choose the way that's in Your heart.Genom vttars djupa skogar

Screaming in this room tonight.
All out of dreams.
I'm still holding onto this scene tonight.
And it's all over now.
Gagging on the scene.
Gagging on the scene.
86 on my dreams.It's never enough
And never will be
All this useless gate, sickens me
Fuckin' misanthropigs putting down every race
Never questioning themselves
Only other people way of life
Misantropigs resent every race
Misantropigs hate every colour
Misantropigs want them all to die
It's time Misantropigs
Ask themselves why?
It's no good, to hate them all
It's a battle, they can't win
It's no good, always being prejudiced
It's time misantropigs
Respect all the earths kindI smell that whore
Bring me back
Bring me a brick
Take my bottle
And break it
Pour it all out
I pushed you too far
Self absorb that pity
I want to knock you off your horse
I just feel it
Everything's fine
Spit on yourself
You're so beautiful
Crack and chip off
Like the sun won't, shine, down
Take your medicine like a champ
While that sting can last a million years
Self absorb that utopia
So bad
I just feel itI saw it moving in the darkened sky
the gods arriving through the clouds
Forgotten but not forgiven
remembering all their outrage
I'll not forget when I am dead
They struck the ground I stood on
took away every soul
undressed my mind and destroyed my shadow
I am doomed to walk towards the end
Forgotten but not forgiven
remembering all their outrage
I'll not forget when I am dead
I'll not forgive when I arise
I'll not forget when I am dead
In a state of mind
that can not be felt
it can not be seen
it's like an unconcious terror
a few got out
out of the frames
but the rest were burnt in flamesReduced and erased you are
Pulled down, beaten up
Caressed by pain and smashed with a fist of steel
On a journey so wide that your senses they collide
Desperate struggle against the will of fate
It's sealed before you've any chance to break the cycle
A sufferstream runs through me
I have to let it out
My outburst comes near thee
You've got to let me be
Putrifacated acts still stop the future
With that progress in mind we feed on the feebleSixhundred and sixty six bloodless virgins
They were found from under the melting snow
The youth of those tormented pale maidens
Was stolen for the purposes of black magic witch
No blood traces were seen on the snow
Only those corpses like empty shells on the ground
Limbs in chaos without order on the ground
Macabre was that view after offerings were done
Wicked lady countess erszebeth nadasdy
Wicked lady countess erszebeth nadasdy
The dark lady of her castle
Invented the secret of everlasting youth
Accidentally she made a wound for a chamber maid
Maid bled drops of blood on the hand of countess
And behold - that drop of blood
Changed dramatically the surface of her skin
And her skin looked like a young girl's peach cheek
Every time when it was washed by virgin's blood
Wicked lady countess erszebeth nadasdy

Listen, I'll make a long story short
It's hard to accuse the big shots of a crime
Maybe they are the owner of the court of law
And soon they turn the table around and charge you with a crime
MONEY RULES EVERTHING AND NOTHING ELSE
EVERYBODY WANTS THAT COULOURED PAPER DOESN'T MATTER

Makes out of me, makes out of me
Maybe I'll get it sooner, sooner or later

They lead the life of Riley, that's a matter of fact
It's nearly impossible, that they will be caught in the act
They enjoy getting on the crazy train
And they move in the world with blood and pain

Blow the candles out, end the road here
No solace will be found

When covered with filth from all sides

Darkness descends, everyone dies
No solace will be found

I am coming back from Hell
The flames of the stake have not destroyed my hate.
My curse is not over yet
I confessed under torture all you sins.
I'm dead guiltless!
I ask for revenge!
My order was mighty and strong
A model of faith in all the Western world.
The Temple is now destroyed
By the greediness of your black, twisted soul.
I'm dead guiltless!
I ask for revenge!
One after the other you all must die
Time will not stop the Templar's revenge
The great injustice asks to be avenged with blood
For innocent lives that died in flames.sometimes our fingers speak louder than words (aggravates illness and passes through spit) I can see right through the back of your head. clearly. if its right or its wrong if this is wrong. I can't be right. dear god, I think they're right/ how long before this dies? we'll count the numbers, we'll just forget. we've learned to fail. we've embraced regret. that's not an honest answer and we don't wish it was. (you're like) sharpened sticks passing hands, aimed at hearts, passing through. straight through my heart, pass my way. sometimes our fingers speak louder than words. sometimes these wires pass right through the nerves if my heart swelled from my chest would you feed it glass or another kiss? we'll go on for days, for months, for years forever. you'll break my heart. if we count on each other over someone else's shoulder. the way we do when people become numbers am I a one, a two, a three, four, five or six, seven or an eight?Carve another notch in your bedpost, whore
Lay back and tally up the score
Count the number of hearts you've ripped from chests
Then put your pretty eyes to rest
They've had a long day of looking for love
In all the wrong places
Putting too much stock in pretty faces
When will you learn there is a difference
Between lust and loveInhale the strength to play
Blow barricades away
This universe implodes
Reality unloads
Find yourself a thousand worlds
Pick the one that suits you most
Will a choice put you at ease?
Than grab your chance to slay the beast
Keep searching for your destiny
And you will find all that will set your free
Keep moving onwards endlessly
To evolve and become on
One piece
The universe implodes
When our dream state explodes
Find yourself dreaming your life
Do you truly feel alive?
Comprehend the sacred code
That makes your universe implodes
Keep searching for your destiny
And you will find all that will set your free
Keep moving onwards endlessly
To evolve and become on
Our ego will lead us to endless penance
This journey shall wake us don't dream forever
The Matrix of reality transforms the cosmic energy
Our ego won't spare us these endless failures
This journey will guide us don't dream forever
Rise
Nothing appears to be what it really is as we believe in the illusions
Free yourself from walking in circles
This will be the end of the world as we know it
Your ascension will begin
Keep searching for your destiny
And you will find all that will set your free
Keep searching for your legacy
And you will find all answers undoubtedly
Keep looking forwards endlessly
To evolve and unite the world to become one pieceAbobinated, tiny god of mine
Overseeing my rest, my lust, my life
Torched in hatred
Loved in Horror sublime
Almost formless
Darkened, and yet you shine
You made me in your image
I deformed yours into mine
Now we're even, O loving god
Equals in my melting eyes
Mutant christ, loving christ
Know me with thine naked eyes
Holy christ, one tenth the size
So unlike the other christs
God-made man (with)
man-made god to adore
Idolatry?
My faith has been restored
Gaze upon me
Bless me, lord, or die
I'll find another little lord to fry
You baked me in this image
so I burned yours into mine

AN EBONY FLAME, A SUN INFERNAL,
NEMESIS OF THE NIGHT, MY OWN DARK ANGEL,

BLACK STAR, WHERE LIGHT NEVER SHINES,
BLACK STAR WON'T YOU BE MY GUIDE?
A DEAD SUN FOR WHERE THE LIGHT NEVER SHINES,
SHINE ON...
TWINKLE, TWINKLE BLACK STAR,
SHINE ON... BLACK STARMute all your opinions, don't you ever take a stand, still thinking won't suit you.
As I said once before, stand in the row.
Wait in the silence, let the brainwash begin.
Forget your morals, don't think of what is right.
They'll do all the thinking for you, your future is planned.
Can't shoot yourself in the head, I'll pull the trigger for you.
Too weak to make this simple task, nothing more than a useless attempt, to do something right.
I'll help you trough...
Don't utter a single word. this is what you deserve, don't ever talk back.
Don't utter a single word, this is what you deserve, buried under laws just made for you.
Don't utter a single word, this is what you deserve, don't ever resist.
Don't utter a single word, this is what you deserve, buried under laws just made for you.
So now you're on the edge, they'll give
you a push.
You'll need all help, and a little guidance to the other side.
Always expect the worst, they're obliged.
No answers received, no questions asked, forget about the holes in your head.
Can't...
Don't...
Can't...
Don't...Ella se ir y las hojas caern
La doncella no regresar
El sello del olvido se ha roto
Y ese amor puro ya no ser
Amanece la vida la esperanza nos cobijar
La verdad est escondida en sombras
Los sueos mentirn la noche ser y el dolor est
De repente todo se aclar
La ceguera tambin se alej
Sus ojos cerr y mi nombre invoc
Y ya nunca, nunca la volvieron a ver
Cosechando el dolor ese amor creci
En un mundo lleno de opresin
Cuando el rayo de luz
Se oculte otra vez y la noche comience
Ella se fue y yo pierdo la fe
Mis heridas ya no cerrarn
Es el alba engaado
Y con l me engao yo tambin
Y al final de ese da, volver
Amanece en la vida, s que pronto todo pasar
Y enfrento las sombras de pie en soledad
Cosechando el dolor ese amor creci
En un mundo lleno de opresin.
Cuando el rayo de luz
Se oculte otra vez y la noche comienceSerpentine Lyrics
deep inside I'm dying
deep inside I'm hiding
deep inside my every word I cry (alone I cry...)
deep inside I'm heartless
deep inside regardless
kill for me - my every word a lie
deep inside a child
when tears and dreams go wild when
deep inside comedian for life
say will I die for you?
see I was always there to run
will I deny for you?
the smiling scarecrow on your tongue
say will I die for you?
see I was always there to run
say will I die for you?
deep inside I'm dying
deep inside I'm crying
speak to me the words
of love and trust!
(I feel distrust)
burn for me my neonworld to dust!
say will I die for you...
and in the distance I'm alive
and in the distance neonlights so far away from me
and in the distance I'm alive
and in the distant smile I'll pass on by
and cross the plans you made, the suns you burned
the distance walks away
say will I die for you...blood burns clean. i can piss gasoline. what you're willing to waste i can smell, almost taste. see these lights in my eyes. they record a life of crime. fingers all wrapped around. tongues pulled back like loaded guns. we'll do it again one last time. blood burns clean, wash away gasoline. what you're willing to waste i can smell. almost taste.. see these lights in my e yes they record a life of crime. we'll do it again one last time. we'll do it again till they pull this gun from my cold dead hand. living your life like you're waiting to die, eyes on the clock like you're hoping you live through this. this is where we got off quiet calm hanging from dull needles in the air. dirty rubber souls tracked behind us the faint trace of suspicion on the terminal floor. if we had been able to we would have seen our reflections in passing store front windows only the late afternoon light refused to let us in and we moved like ghosts up escalators and down crowded concrete corridors. every movement was carefully detected and words painstakingly decoded and still we fell out from the camera's eye- erased from the taped evidence- we were the light footsteps of a practiced and polished abomination. we passed unquestioned into their vaults where they gave us anything we wanted without a word. this whole world laid open wide. say my name like it's all you've got s ay my name while you bleed into me. tonight the world is ours.As silence falls between day and night
With ice swept winds and cold rain they left
Shattered blood over the lost battle
Carnivore beast, a stench of the living
A creation that eats us up from within
Fallen down to scratch non-forgiven
Render your world as their eyes shrivel
Confronted by killing capacity
The throne is their desire of emptiness
Only the fools walk with tenacity towards the cross
Conspiracy, a most to make them fall in trap
That trap will lead to lifetime of slavery
A divine infinity controls the wildfire spreading throughout
So bow...so bow down
Lower your head and welcome the created ones
Made to devour every last standing
Legend speaks of forgiveness of every sin
They are filled with satisfaction
A definition of genocide through subconsciousness
Magi created the weight from the book of damnation
They incinerate souls and leave nothing to remain
Bound of mindless collapse
Join the weak because you've sold your soul
Feel the threat of our extinction
Try to give compliment - status won't be received
The throne is their desire of emptiness
Only the fools walk with tenacity towards the cross
Conspiracy, a most to make them fall in trap
That trap will lead to lifetime of slavery
A divine infinity controls the wildfire spreading throughout
So bow...so bow down
As you slowly die, you can feel as my heart slows down
And to a sudden stop.
My soul evaporates and leaves flesh and bone
Rotting from inside to ashes and a new form takes my place.
[Lead: Holm]
The throne is their desire of emptiness
Only the fools walk with tenacity towards the cross
Conspiracy, a most to make them fall in trap
That trap will lead to lifetime of slavery
A divine infinity controls the wildfire spreading throughout
So bow...so bow down
Lower your head and welcome the created ones
Made to devour every last standing
Legend speaks of forgiveness of every sin
They are filled with satisfaction
A definition of genocide through subconsciousness
Wounded and bleeding, a last effort to rise
Feel the threat of your extinction
A creation that eats us up from within
They incinerate souls and leave nothing to remainI'm afraid you failed this term
We can meet again on my terms
You don't quite make the grade
Your pleas, your opinions do not mean a thing
You preen yourself in the eyes of all
One call and it all comes down
Your insolence, your world of you
One call and we'll watch it come down
(One call and we'll watch it all come down)
I swear I'll make that call
I swear nothing makes sense like nonsense
It this life, you are kind, bumbled, not
What you've got to give is not what I want to receive
Seven years to forgive?
I'll give you seven seconds to get out
You gave me seven years of neglect
I'll give you seven seconds to get out
(Today)Everything I need is not really what I want.
I really really want to see you die.
Everything I want I can't have if left up to me
Un-af-fec-ted
By all the bullshit you cause
Un-pro-tec-ted
Naked so we see your flaws
Vi-o-lat-ed
You must think that we don't see this
Dis-re-spec-ted
Just remember it's our ass you kiss
Rot.
You don't like me, I hope you
Rot.
Un-jus-ti-fied
You keep fucking with us; we are
Hos-tile-in-side
We consider you a joke it's
Hate-mag-nif-ied
Soon you'll think that we don't see this
Strip-down-your-pride
Soon you'll feel the force of all of us
Rot.
You don't like me, I hope you
Rot.
I don't like you
Can't you see this?
Why won't you
Leave me alone?It's a crime - it is a crime to be innocent
In life - in this life and presence
All life - all life is indifferent
Now's when - when all's past and gone
[Chorus:]
Turn away - fade away
Turn away - fade away
It's a crime - it is a crime to be silent
When colours - when colours have no nuance
You little - you little insects
Splashed out - splashed out of all essence
Fade away - fade away
Fade away - closer every daythree magnet hearts
i wanted you to
two basement stars
i wanted you to
cut me out
i'd like to feed my children someday
oh my god we belong inside
my pretention and my belt-loop have been for a ride
i wanna know who you sit into
oh who did you feed my dinner to?
when i'm looking for a place to settle down
my impossible front puts a hurt on this town
i set my sights on where i'll be
you'd understand my eyes if you could
i wanna clip the cord
your eyes won't leave the gun
i think i found my way
to point an arrow towards the sun
with every green mistake
you're elevating my mercury
who's heart is bound to break
when all's at stakes a memory?
oh my god we belong inside
my pretention and my belt-loop have been for a ride
i wanna know who you sit into
oh who did you feed my dinner to?
when i'm looking for a place to settle down
my impossible front puts a hurt on this town
i set my sights on where i'll be
you'd understand my eyes if you could[Instrumental]
[MI NA SAMHNA/NOVEMBER, 1995]Any thought of moving on
Is a loop without an end
Back to the beginning
Reliving this over and over and over and over
While everything around me moves
Detached to protect others more than myself
Well I'm afraid of how this ends
No comfort in absolutes
No places without time
I am the beginning
And I'm reliving this over and over and over and over
While everything around me moves
Detached to protect others more than myself
Well I'm afraid of how this ends
And I'm reliving this over and over and over and over
While everything around me moves
Detached to protect others more than myself
Well I'm afraid of how this ends
Now a monumental waste
I refuse to be a crutch for your disease
I refuse to carry on your tragedy
I refuse
All your secrets
Never shared
Programmed into me
All your secrets
Never shared
Programmed into me
Well I'm afraid of how this ends
I never thought such things before
Ignorance is indeed bliss
And knowledge isn't just power, it's torture
I see you trying to get to me
But I'm alone even in the most crowded room
Screaming inside like an animal
Cause I'm confused and scared
Trying to survive this place
Over and over and over
Trying to survive this place
Over and over
Trying to survive this place
Over and over and over
Trying to survive this place
Over and overWretched limbs tear at nothing,
but wrinkled skin and diseased hearts,
and black eyes cast blank emotions,
that drop into hell taking you with them.
you sell your soul, you've marked your way,
death and corruption.
You sell your soul, you've marked your way, death and corruption.
Heartless, faceless, you'll stop at nothing.
Raping the willing, leave them with nothing.
Replace those you've consumed, with the young you've infected.
Replace those you've consumed, with death and destruction.
Cut off their tongues, they keep coming.
Infect the young, they keep coming.
Sell your death, cut off their tongues.
Sell your death, infect the young.seemed like a good idea at the time.
bones here, bones there...marrow fucking everywhere.
youre fired, clown. [schultz][Van Drunen / Van Drunen, Daniels]
Behold my final testimony
I'm the survivor of my race
hear the tale of sadness and genocide
where the species disappeared
and the trees could no longer breathe
a drama of collective suicide
as we let our children suffer
in a paradise long gone
utopia was always out of reach
but we still kept believing
in the madness and the lies
read my words that's all that I beseech
As we died because of our ignorance
as we died because of greed
because of our stupidity
now I'm the last one to scream
The mountains now are rising
and the oceans start to boil
the final convulsion of the earth
the heat is melting every stone
volcanes start to roar
cosmic chaos no hope for rebirth
As I'm the living witness
of the suffering and the pain
I was doomed to see the planet die
together with the tragedy
I'm craving for relief
eternally the universe will cryLand is soak up blood by ages
All is forever here
Where sun forever goes
Where fires was burning
Where sunset still live
Step by step... in chaos of unbeing
Step by step... in abyss of darkness
Fear for fear
We're was laid in fear
Blood for blood
We're was wanted by blood
We're live in fear... life of illusions
Dying emotions domain
Here hate is respect
Here power no for turning back
Here power and might for stand above
Difficult way through the fear and pain
Strong, be a stronger!
Bold, be a bolder!
Let's hell burning red,
The sky is denied
Land is soak up blood by ages
All is forever here
Strong, be a stronger!
Bold, be a bolder!
Breaking the light
Dying emotions domain
...Rise above... upward...Nocturnal flight, no shadows cast
A distant symbol of our beyond
Life lies in front of us
Sacred Ground, Rotten Earth
Ashes To Dust
Flesh Decomposed
Caressing the sacred ground
Where the deadened corpses lie
A sepulchural misty night
With a whiff of the Macabre
Silently watching the stones
Put there as a symbol of death
Our minds united; A force is lit,
And insight creates
A humanoid watchtower, reaching for
Their souls to the SkySick to death, filled to the brim
Of feigning interest in your life
Be it a god, be it a knife
An answer to the never ending strife
To hold your tongue speaks of truthful pain
Its not like I haven't already heard you complain
Breathe it in or out, puke, swallow or spit
Silence ain't golden when gold has turned to shit
But enough's enough
Don't tell me once again
Life is constant pain
I've lost what I'll never find
Tripped down when I was blind
But at least I know
When to drain the bitter cup
And when its time to simply just
Shut the fuck up
Go ahead, cut it up or cut this back
I only hope you understand indifference
That I just don't give a damn
To hold your tongue speaks of truthful pain
Its not like I haven't already heard you complain
Breathe it in or out, puke, swallow or spit
Silence ain't golden when gold has turned to shit
But enough's enough
Don't tell me once again
Life is constant pain
I've lost what I'll never find
Tripped down when I was blind
But at least I know
When to drain the bitter cup
And when its time to simply just
Shut the fuck up
Don't tell me once again
Life is constant pain
I've lost what I'll never find
Tripped down when I was blind
But at least I know
When to drain the bitter cup
And (what the fuck?)
Don't tell me once again
Life is constant pain
I've lost what I'll never find
Tripped down when I was blind
But at least I know
When to drain the bitter cup
And when its time to simply just
Shut the fuck upHere I'm alone
Look through the window
Snow's falling down
Winter has come
Think to the times
When we were happy
Changes I want
Freedom again
Many years ago the Major said: "Since today you gotta call me king"
Our liberty he took away, with the promise of a golden dream
Soon the dream became a nightmare
Soon the rebels they began to die
No one seemed to have the power to
Get rid of the Major of the Lies
There's a story about a man who lives
In the forest of the ancient rites
I am going now to search for him, if he does exist I want his guide
Then I find him and he says to me:
"I've been waiting for a pure so long
I am giving you the magic ring that will bring you to another world
[bridge]
Join me tonight for a journey through the dark
We'll find this place that is not so far"
[chorus]
Follow the prophet to Never, Neverland
Where all the free men together they will stand
A dream of liberty and peace for everyone
Under the light of the sun
I am coming back now, to the real world
To the land of freedom, I will bring you all
It is time for you now, all you slaves and poor
Break the chains that would never let you fly away
If you got the courage, and your heart is pure
All the pain and the sorrow you can behind
[bridge]
[chorus]can i weld these paper folds to flat
without burning all the red and blue
and though were not an army i know what to do
i have seen the gasoline burn
and i know the power of the sun
and ive stuck my hands outside a moving car
is it cliche if maybe i say im spinning?
you and me, somethingll be around again
never again is only a friend i keep near
go away then suddenly im around again
you can follow compass to the north
but youre better off looking for starts
cos the compass goes full circle
there you are
i have seen the gasoline burn
tried to find the water on the moon
which direction does the revolution take you?
not forward or back
like a pinwheel we go around and around
round and roundFollowers of satan, all rise and give the sign of the horns.
We now pay homage to the lord and the master. Let us pray.There are so many things that still escape from your numb and drug-infested brain
So stuck in the mud you call a life sedated, self-castrated
Your existence is such a waste of time just make an effort and check your pride
I know the surface may look fine, but deep inside you're nothing but shit
Come alive and make my vision clear for all to see
Look inside and slash your way out of this misery
Lacerate my soul as I
Revive - inside I have no feelings I ain't a thing you can control
Surrender to a stepchild of laceration
Rise - a life without a meaning starting to lose control
Surrender to the stepchild of laceration (stepchild of laceration)
I feel so comfortable in my guilt 'cause things ain't that bad when you sin
At least I have a soul to sell deranged and quite obscene
Oh god, don't praise me like a whore keep your mouth shut and walk out that door
The human abstract at it's peak I just removed the skin and saw the freak within
Come alive and make my vision clear for all to see
Look inside and slash your way out of this misery
Lacerate my soul as I
Revive - inside I have no feelings I ain't a thing you can control
Surrender to a stepchild of laceration
Rise - a life without a meaning starting to lose control
Surrender to the stepchild of laceration
Laceration crawling inside my skin 'til I bleed
Lost in perdition why don't you pray for me anymore
(Why don't you pray for me?)
I feel so cold laceration child I feel so lost in perdition starting to revive
Inside I have no feelings I ain't a thing you can control
Surrender to a stepchild of laceration
Rise - a life without a meaning starting to lose control
Surrender to the stepchild of laceration (stepchild of laceration)Before the effluvial corpse is consumed

A new improved version of me
But I'm nothing so good, no, I'm nothing
Just bones, a lonely ghost burning down songs
Of violence, of love and of sorrow
I beg for just one more tomorrow
Where you hold me down, fold me in
Deep, deep, deep in the heart of your sins
I break in two over you
I break in two and each piece of me dies
And only you can give the breath of life
But you don't see me, you don't
Here I'm pinned between darkness and light
Bleached and blinded by these nights
Where I'm tossing and tortured 'til dawn
By you, visions of you then you're gone
The shock bleeds the red from my face
When I hear someone's taken my place
How could love be so thoughtless, so cruel?
When all, all that I did was for you
I break in two over you
I break in two and each piece of me dies
And only you can give the breath of life
But you don't see me, you don't
I break in two over you
I break in two and each piece of me dies
And only you can give the breath of life
But you don't see me, you don't
I break in two over you
I break in two over you, over you
I break in two
I would break in two for you
Now you see me
Now you don't
Now you need me
Now you don'tSo you want to be free
To live your life the way you want to be
Will you give if we cry
Will we live or will we die, yeah
Solitary brother, is there still a part of you that wants to live
Solitary sister, is there still a part of you that wants to give
Jaded hearts heal with time
Shoot that love so we can stop the bleeding
If we try and live our lives
The way we want, the way we want to be, yeah
Racism in among future kings can lead to no good
Besides all our sons and daughters already know how that feelsBring the black box to the altar
Now raise your hands and do the sign
Oh hail Satan, yes hail Satan
Lay down your swords, the evil star
It's a black funeral
She was a victim of my coven
Open the black box on the altar
Her blood is still hot, so let it out
Oh hail Satan, yes hail Satan
Now drink it, drink, drink, forget that whore
It's a black funeral
She was the victim of my covenEh chico, take a look around
Bow down for the CDT sound
Are you fed up? I don't give a fuck
You are the clown of this muthafuckin' town punk
Let's have a late night light flight
Turtles airlines will be your guide
It only has first class, free your mind brother
Sit back, relax with the green smooth devil
Never ever think it's a matter of time
to bring us down - Thanx, we're feelin' fine
Don't have us out of sight, no, but step aside
Don't forget the danger, it's like suicide
Step aside 'cause CDT comes full affect
Yeah let's go ahead
Asi me gusta, no question my brother
These words are strong 'bout the lifestyle I prefer
Always speak the truth in the microphone
I like it like that when our minds are stoned
Sientate - Relajate
Con este agradable verde
Estas harto mio hermano
Apartate - No me paro
I try to fly high, but we're damn I see
I can't stop, I won't stop, hay que pasarlo asi
I don't give a fuck to the things you say
No es tu cosa, I still live my wayAz e jszaka szulott je, a forditott let sar ja,
A rettegett ordog, orokke ego legenda..
The native of dragons, The leader of the wolves
Rhadamantus tyrant, The Great Impaler Void
He hated the lairs at all, never casigated the truth
Slayed the rag-pickers at all, could not spare the riches too
He nailed the hats on their heads, this way kept the traditions of his guests
Had his feast in his forest, was made of the victims been impaled
Az e jszaka szulott je, a forditott let sar ja.. a karoba huzo vajda!
A szelrozsa minden iranyaba menekult volna ki merre lat.. egesd fel a csurt!
Sad sad desinty, but their catharsis had to be done.. anyway.
The nature always find the way to cut off what is rather like a stunt.
Dark Majesty of all the mystics come back and visit our lands!
They are too much, they are too sick, we need your wise instructions
For to keep the flames and to use the pales.
Lets burn the books, and change the churches to trainspotted ecstasy
Parties! [We have] prepared the place just to take your fair,
Join the digital trance! Black fashion cult in the U.V. light.
U.V. Lord Impaler. Come back! Dark Majesty.. Visit our lands!I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colors anymore I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes
I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a new born baby it just happens every day
I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door and I want it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black
No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comesDeep in your mind there is another side
A morbid truth one cannot hide
Unimaginable gore was your past time high
To hear people scream, to watch them die
Return back to the burial site
Face your dreams upon this night
Severed limbs not far away
Spirit past you now obey
Images of the forgotten past
Your first life revealed at last
Now you'll find to your surprise
All the corpses you left behind
A place you feel you've been to before
Where life would turn right into gore
You dig deep down through the years of decay
The truth is revealed, you found your wayReality no longer battles perception
This letter's written to no one
Sincere,
I sought your truth and divine purpose through myths of revelation
Guidance all wrapped up in a paper box,
Supported only so long as my mind was the enemy
I could not in conscience hold on
As we face distress we must not lose heart
Stand fast and press on,
Triumph awaits
As we face distress we must not lose heart
Stand fast and press on,
Triumph awaits us
The powerful constant that I had once leaned on is no longer there
(No longer)
You call this shameful disbelief,
A process like losing my closest friend
As we face distress we must not lose heart
Stand fast and press on,
Triumph awaits
As we face distress we must not lose heart
Stand fast and press on,
Triumph awaits us
Sometimes we have to watch our whole lives fall apart,
Before we can rebuild them again,
A greater foundation
We watch our whole lives
(Sometimes we have to watch our whole lives)
Fall apart
(Before we can rebuild them again) rebuild them again (a greater foundation)
I wish there was another way,
But no amount of devotion can fix this
Triumph awaits
Triumph awaits
Triumph awaits
Triumph awaits
Triumph awaits
Sometimes we have to watch our whole lives fall apart,
Before we can rebuild them again,
A greater foundation
We watch our whole lives
Fall apart (Sometimes we have to watch our whole lives)
Rebuild them again
(Before we can rebuild them again,
A greater foundation)aCold Is The Winter
On Its Ground We Ride
To The Battlefield
Under Battlesky
Warriors Are We
To Fight On This Day
Brothers At Side
To The Battle Ride["Cross the Triangle of Flames" from "Under a Funeral Moon"]
Engulfed in frost
I sailed our dreams
gloomy inner landscapes come to life
I am the wolf in the darkest scene
Phantasms sweep my role
I am Lucifer, I bring you light and pride
Three steps for the white
A journey for the black
No flags for the tens lines
(but) I'll shoot you full of signs
In other dimensions
My visions grew black wingsIt was the birth of my darkside
Uncertainty in the air
Wanting to take a chance
Suppress my fear of the dare
I choose to live a life of pain
Refuse - instead I live insane
[Chorus:]
Darkside - the violence runs red
The evil curse is everywhere
I'd rather be dead
Darkside - the violence runs red
The evil curse is everywhere
I'd rather be:
Just what I needed
Something to change my life
It makes no difference
How I make up my mind
I choose to live a life of pain
Refuse - instead I live insane
[Chorus x2]
(Dark) Darkness finds its way inside me (Side)
(Dark) Don't think I will ever change (Side)
(Dark) Look outside it's growing darker (Side)
(Dark) A reflection of myself (Side)
(Dark) Darkness finds its way inside me (Side)
(Dark) Don't think I will ever change (Side)
(Dark) Look outside it's growing darker (Side)
(Dark) A reflection of myself (Side)
And now my heart's black
And that's the way it will stay
There's nothing better
There's no other way
I choose to live a life of pain
Refuse - instead I live insane
[Chorus x2]From cold storms I emerge to inferno
Kiss me with your insanity, bless me with your plague
Burn through my head
The psychic treasures in the arena to find
Dead symbols that walk through the dreams of man
Non-divine, burning souls of red
Tounges of insanity , here I am
Lick me free from my dark past
And open my heart for your joy
I seek eternity where it lies to be found
My life will not end 6 feet under the ground
No rebirth in heaven where eternal sleep awaits
We must seek immortality beyond the seven gates
Make love with me this one last time
This one dead dream
And rot we can as gods
Together in a distant hell
Burn me with your tongues of love
Burn me free from my bitterness and hate
So let the light devour men
And eat them up with blindness
Non-divine, a restless soul
Worm, goat, eater of gods
Burn me with the3 tongues of your love
Burn me free from my hate
Set me on fire
Again and againMy dear don't leave me now
Close at the edge of my end
All this time you have been my friend
Don't go stay for a while
My dear you're losing me now
This will be my last hour
hear my voice, see my face
See how sick I am
How I long for your embraceWhispers of insanity bombard my rationale.
Aeons passed since I last did feel,
The joy of my tears,
Streaming,in dissipation of sorrow.
The insidious beauty,so quiescent.
Vehemence,stronger still,
...Yet dying....
...As yet another gorge,
Fails to bleed.
I rub salt into mine open wounds,
Scars heal,but the flesh is then dead.
Pain spills,from my mind into my body.
Time expires,
And I see what has passed.
Overspent in mourning.
Death came for me in years of past,
And left me to live in death.
Life is given to us....obsolete.....
As the dust flew,I smelt the ancient past.
From whence did I know what it is that I know?
Or what it was that I knew?
Time is the carrier of knowledge.
Much can be recalled in time....
...But in a moment.......?
Knowledge becomes nothing,
When faced with the propensity of time.
Once lost,'tis lost forever.
So much to know (each answer begets a greater question),
The importance of truth is so much greater,
And hidden amongst lies.
.....I am all which mocks virtue.....
Release the shackles of the flesh,
What name must I bequeath (upon my kingdom)?
Amidst the slumber,I awaken the dream.....
Portals of obscurity burst forth into my eyes,
As I plunge into the ascending chaos.....
I journey on,the lights dripping their luminescence.
Crossed dimensions imbibe me,
I see all,but can do nothing but see.
....I roam....
I am enraged.
Inspired by my insanity.
These worlds,unknown.
I cry for this solitude.
Is it mine fortune to have entered such visions?
Canst I decipher the vision to words?
Words cannot conceive.
I extol my journey through the vision of sound.
Imbibe thine mind if thou durst see!
Travel betwixt the demented seas!
....Reflect the journey....
[Lyrics-Greg,Winter 1995/96]
[Music-Steve,Winter/Spring 1996]I was lost: I have cried out my tears;
Spent so many endless nights alone.
Almost drowned myself in my fears,
But my spirit made me go on.
And I gathered strength for living from my sorrow,
It's time to show you some fortitude.
Now I will build a new life with my own tomorrow;
Better life - without traitor like you!
Chorus:
Overcome all despair, all the sadness,
Done with anguish of body and mind.
You will not see me fall into madness.
Youre a bad dream Im leaving behind.
Ill leave behind.
Dont believe? Yes, it is really me.
Beautiful, smiling, & still alive.
You thought after all that you did
I would never ever survive?
Now you see, you were seriously mistaken,
About me you were totally wrong.
I wouldnt let you make me feel lost and forsaken,
I will live, & I will be strong!For the pain there is a cure
For the cure there is a pain
For the pain there is a cure
For the cure there is a pain
1:40
When all else fails this is the place to be
Opioid here to save the day
Tie off
Intravenous
Injection
Or if you prefer
Off the foil
Bliss is finally here
Escape from the lies
Escape from the pain
Chaos turns to bliss
Bliss turns to HELL
Chaos turns to bliss
Bliss turns to HELL
Alas nothing ever free
Euphoria
leaving the stream
The hell
as it leaves you dead
Realizing
the emptiness
that you dread
Wondering
where it went wrong
Why to quit, why to quit
There's gotta be more!
There's gotta be more!
Into the afterlife I shall go
Higher than the angels ever felt
3:37
In a strange land
Find blood on your hand
With this I want to fly
Hoping not to die
Overdose around the corner
Needle and a spoon
3:53
A fix to be forgotten
Rips apart your mind
4:02-4:18 (repeat)
One more time
One more fix
4:51
It appears even in dreams
Coming after my soul
For the pain there is a cure
For the cure there is a pain
For the pain there is a cure
For the cure there is a painOrdinary men don't find their own way (find their own way)
It's in the struggle that we can finally see
I'll never forget how I felt so far away
When fear waged war and wore down on me
What do you say when you can't get the words out
Can you hear me
Don't let me down
What do you say when you can't get the words out
Can you hear me
Don't let me down
Can you hear me
Don't let me down
Put your fear away
Push it off the edge so that left is who you are
Stand tall against the waves in the ocean
You must be brave when it's sink or swim
Rest comes to the weary
We're so tired of losing (we're so tired of losing)
The sun will break through
You'll get what you need (you'll get what you need)
The sun will break through
You'll get what you need
Wait to speak until you find the words to say
They'll come
I promise they'll come
You'll hear them out loud without forcing the words out
Put all your fear away
Ordinary men don't find their own way
It's in the struggle that we can finally see
I'll never forget how I felt so far away
When fear waged war and wore down on me
Bravery will find you when your head is hung low
Your fear is like a fever
It too will goI came with the moonlight
I spread with the winds
I'm future and faint past
I'm ashes and dust
Hush, don't you cry
Moonchild, free your soul
I'l tell you how
As soon as you're safe in my embrace
Obedience
The key to ecstacy
Obedience
Your way to Calvary
Do you belong?
My might is eternal
I drift with the tide
I'm yesterday's nightfall
I'm vision of hope
Hush, ease your mind
Moonchild, seize the cross
I'm right behind
There to put sense to your dreams
Obedience
The key to ecstacy
Obedience
Your way to Calvary
Do you belong?
Flee with me
Into the fields of glory
See the shine
Luna, the promised land
Obedience
The key to ecstacy
Obedience
Your way to Calvary
Obedience
The key to ecstacy
Obedience
Your way to Calvary
Do you belong?You took the step and slipped away
Enchanted by a friendly face
You thought it was love
It took your life out of your hands
You never dreamt that it would ever and never end
Bought and sold
Should have seen it from the start
He stole your love and broke your heart
Love out on display
Among your shattered dreams you stand
Make a reason out of hollow words
What's it worth
[Chorus]
Oh oh oh YouOll never be the same
Put your trust on love
You're not alone
Oh oh oh I'll lighten up your darkest night
Close your eyes
I will be your day
Seasons come and seasons go
A miracle about to show
Love will come around
Put yourself back in the light
Lose the shadows of your darkest night
You'll be fine
[Chorus]I live like a cockroach
In a basement wet and cold
Maybe, I'll never know
If there's life at the surface
I guess, I'm doomed for life
To spend it in this shelter
Fall out blocks the sun
For the years to come
The fires raged on and on
Then the winter came moving on
It's cold and dark living underground
Buried alive by a nuclear blast
Fire scorching earth
There was nowhere to run
Then the storms they would howl
Blowing black snow, blowing death around
I look into your eyes
The X-ray shining through
Claustrophobic madness
Kill your beloved, killing everyone
At the dawn of a new age
The age of quarrel
And the age of quarrel
Turned into the age of ice
The fires raged on and on
The winter came moving on
It's cold and dark living underground
Buried alive by a nuclear blast
I live like a cockroach
In a basement wet and cold
Maybe I'll never know
If there's life at the surface
Guess, I'm doomed for life
To spend it in this shelter
Fall out blocks the sun
For the years to come
At the dawn of a new age
The age of quarrel
And the age of quarrel
Turned into the age of iceDeny, Your disease
Isolate, Pure
Pure, By yourself
I'm so impressed, PureSpirit is your fate and burden
Spirit is your destination
Once long ago, on a dark night
You felt body and soul unite
In a dream of epiphany
You were given perspicuity, dignity, autonomy, supremacy
Ancient spirits cursed through your veins
The sparks in you turned into flames
You heard battle drums thundering
Was this a dream or an awakening, a destining, foreshadowing offering?
The gods have marked you for your life and death
The gods will guide you up to your last breath
You will lead a secret life sheltered by darkness
Up to the day that the spirit soldiers will conquer and then
The twilight mountains you will climb
Brighter than the sun you will shine
Louder than thunder you will roar
Above the world your voice will soar
Through the universe you will fly
Expand the earth, tear up the sky
Once your spirit will break free
A new spring will bring liberty
The gods blessed you with power and a vision
The gods gave you life to accomplish a mission
Being a soldier of spirit in a cold and shallow world
Will at times seem to you rather a curse than a gift
Sometimes you damn the ancient spirits
Everything seems grim and senseless
They tell you that there's no forgiveness
For the thousand sins you could confess
Then you envy the blind fools
Who thrive in mediocracies
Who love and hate as they are told
Devoted to trivialities
Spirit soldier
Spirit soldier
Spirits, spirits, spirits
Spirit soldier
Spirits, spirits, spirits
Spirit soldier
Sometimes your dreams take you to the land
Of purity, silence and soul
Where you feel unchained and alive
Where fate is under your control
Then you thank the great omnipotent
Creators of life and spirit
That with the dawn of a new age
You'll be united with the infinite
Spirit soldier
Spirit soldier
Spirits, spirits, spirits
Spirit soldier
Spirits, spirits, spirits
Spirit soldier
The gods sent you to provide for enlightenment
The gods have placed you in line of their descent
You will lead a secret life sheltered by darkness
Up to the day the spirit soldiers will conquer and then
The twilight mountains you will climb
Brighter than the sun you will shine
Louder than thunder you will roar
Above the world your voice will soar
Through the universe you will fly
Expand the earth, tear up the sky
Once your spirit will break free
A new spring will bring libertyIt's difficult for me to get a grip on what you mean
When you stick your fingers in your ear and create another scene
You always step into the traps set perfect in your path
Busy going crazy over whose knife's in your back
Dive inside your blackest stare
The one that's saving do you date
Screaming that you're scared
You the tallest soul
With the shortest self-esteem
Painted as the victim
Who's split between the beams
It doesn't seem to matter
It's nothing
Dead a dream is dying
It's nothing
Best friend I never had
Play me to the point of pushing me too far away
I can only say whatever, ambivalent to your game
You can pretend to the mirror, it's the lie you tell yourself
And I won't walk on eggshells that's a dance for someone elseI walked on dusty roads
On burning lands
The wind picked up my sigh
The dust swallowed up my steps
Dark changed the light
The sky wasn't blue longer
Crying trees bended
Down over dryed rivers
Fire burned in the night
I fell down tired beside it
The fear spoke from the eyes
Behind the flames
I wait for the vultures
I watch them in silence
As their evil eyes
Are burning into my soul
I let the dream takes me away
Pulls me deeper and deeper
To our future
Painted with brush of madness
When the last leaf
Fell into oblivion
And the rain slowly
Carried away everything
While the wind is crying
The cold white dressed
Infinite night tells about
Frozen dreamsGrito al ver nuestras raÃ­ces puras desangrar
Castigadas por el odio, sin quitar su afÃ¡n
Piso un suelo de un terreno hostil, puedo ver

before the mirror of my inspiration
I look at my mirror's picture
so who am I if there stays a mind of an
inexhaustible mistery with me?
so dance faster with the wind of your shadow
so chase faster in the rain of storm feelings
drive the chariots of slassy clouds
looking for the silver groves
and for me the scream of forgotten rain
where only remains to me to go by the thorns
by the bridges of the past
so I give seven golden fires
so I give seven golden keys
seven golden fires
seven golden keysHeart-shaped hallways.
Leading the way to nowhere.
You left me stranded here.
Three years from anywhere.
No sign of a way back only fear.
I'll just follow the fragrance of these fake tears.
Your silence says it all. I know your throat is swelling.
You want to say so much.
But you're afraid you might say what you mean.
I loved you for who you were.
You tried and tried to change me.
It's funny now how you say you're leaving.
Because I'm not the man I used to be.
Shape someone else now, mold someone new.
Take someone else down, your heart-shaped hallway too.can see
when you stay low nothing happens
does it feel right ?
Late at night
things I thought I put behind me
haunt my mind
I just know there's no escape
now once it sets its eyes on you
but I won't run, have to stare it in the eye
Stand my ground, I wont give in
no more denying, I got to face it
won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside
if I dont make it, someone else will
stand my ground
It's all around
getting stronger, coming closer
into my world
I can feel
that it's time for me to face it
can i take it?
Though this might just be the ending
of the life I held so dear
but I won't run, there's no turning back from here
Stand my ground (repeat chorus)
All I know for sure is I'm trying
I will always stand my ground
Stand my ground (repeat chorus x 2)She lies in her bed staring into nowhere
Tears running down her face
An open wound bleeding
Her body turns pale
Recalling the road leading away from right
As the dark had appeared as light
Tricked to cross the line, dragged further in
Then trapped in a swirl of wicked lies
Now, no sign of light, no sign of hope
As a dark shadow enters her room
A freezing chill runs down her spine
The smell of death fills the room
The shadow encircles her, pale of fear
Slowly draining the last drops of life
Her last strength she forces through
And cries out to the Lord she used to know
Overwhelming light annihilates the dark
Immediate rest fills her heart
My dear child, come to Me
I will restore you and embrace you with loveKill yourself all by yourself
Your eyes cried dry and you've gained nothing
Hearts in shreds your own knife
Refuse to escape your self made torture
Alone by yourself only hurts if you need someone
To need truly need anothers touch can lead you into...
And I'm sorry, if my momentary lapse just caused you one more thing
And knowing what I've done can tug a fraying tear
Like thread slipping through my fingers and that's not much to show for pain
Endured
But in the end you'll learn its worth
Alone by yourself only hurts if you need someone
To need truly need anothers touch can lead you into hell
Longing, desire, burning inside her
Crawling in darkness, only a glimmer of hope as she yelled these words.
I'll face my pain
On my own - standing strong
Prove for myself.Zehn schwere stiefel

Her soft breath and simple charm
Wandering through memories
Takes my hand for me to see
Tried so hard

Echoes of innocence
All my thoughts into descent
Tried so hard

When we finally reach the end
She lets go of my hand

Born in the sky a million years ago
Raised by the stars. The whole universe I know
Faster than light and brighter than the sun
Blazing up high. I'm a comet on the run

Burning the sky like a roaring firestorm
Flashing through time. The light-years have no chance
Maximum speed. Thunderbolts are as in trance

On the vast fields of snow
The wind is blowing strong
With it's frozen cold and relentless touch
It leaves a dead and hollow land of ice
I have seen through the eyes of a wolf
And felt all its pain and loneliness
The beautiful land opened before my eyes
Wild as a beast I ran into the night
The calling of the howling wind
Is raging in the realms of north
Creations of ice rising mighty into the skies
And treacherous Gods shall fall
Watching through the falling snow
There's no sign of life
The fire has gone out
In the whirl of time
Behold the face of thunder
The storm is getting near
When the sky calls my name
I have no fear
The calling of the howling wind
Is raging in the realms of north
Creations of ice rising mighty into the skies
And treacherous Gods shall fall
They brought us misfortune
But their honor is about to be crushed
My blood flows cold as streams of the north
We'll never let them take our souls
The calling of the howling wind
Is raging in the north
Creations of ice, rising mighty into the skies
And treacherous Gods shall fall
Time and time again
I witness the birth of a new born star
I climb the highest mountain
To find the essence of a new era
Time and time again
I witness the birth of a new born star
I climb the highest mountain
To find the essence of a new eraWatch the ones who will not let you see.
What falls beyond their conformity.
Of one God.
Of one Mind.
Of one Soul.
You take control.
You're set apart without a cross to wear.
Left alone with out their guilt to bear.
Transcend, transcend all of the worlds that trap you in.
Transcend, transcend another farce you'll have to end.
Watch the ones that who will not let you see,
what falls beyond their conformity.A sense of strength

Gateway to hellIn a very distant future, the last generation of planet earth
has come to a point where they cannot brred anymore.
When everybody had lost their faith, a child was born, but no
one could be the father, except for a god.
This child was a gift from the skies of life-divine or...
Another sky is young...
Another frozen future has passed.
Another breed, another cast.
The rivers will run, brought to life by the sun, the circle is
still unbroken.
Oh, what a sight to see.
Reborn life, destined for all eternity.
Hail the king!
For he has chosen not to drain the godsent child, a gift from
the skies of life divine.
Now we know.
A glimpse of hope grow inside, a change of tide.
Answered prayers of survival.
Miracles.
The offspring of the unknown gods beautifies the aura of this
dying breed.
So they succeed in their quest for continued time.
Celebrate.
The knowledge of the everlasting, never-dying.
Cursed to be walkin in the shadows of death for a lifetime.
No more fears for what the years will bring.
Rebuild the shattered dream.
And now a brighter future has come, another end remains undone
and an era begins,
bringing life free from sins.
Oh, it's a token, the circle is broken.
(The drop of blood from her mouth slowly fell down to the
ground.
Th child inside dried her out. The king's beloved is no more.)
The chosen one felt the time had come to show the world what
had grown within.
This day of life, a sacred moment in time, when joy and pain
collide.
It takes a life to create a life.
Now she's gone.
Anger and hate.
fear and despair fills up his mind.
In search for answers he can't find.
What god would end a life so pure.
She was the one worth dying for.
Alone with princess angel-sent.
Her eyes so blue, my hate relents.
Her destiny is in my hands.
She was born to rule these desert lands.
( Vocals Mike: )
[A sacrifice.
A life arises, when one love has come, another dies.
I let her go and I do not know where to find her soul so alo-
ne.]
Oh, does she hold the power, is she a blessing from the skies?
Is this the answer to where the secret lies.
And in her eyes I see a light is shining through.
I feel that there is hope for a world so brave and new.
Many seasons have changed and the king is old and weak.
The princess has come of age, but still the gift of life they
seek.
In the chambers of crimson sleep.
In this vault of souls to reap.
The future lies in the hands of the shrewd (Harmony: Andreas)
or the earth will die in solitude.
The darkest night the enchanted skies were united in a storm.
Unholiness and all that's unblessed appeared in another form.
Like a raging plague all across the land all women gave birth
to man.
Raped by the wind and forced to bring life to the hundred
bastard sons.
The unholy ones will give strength for all evil to live and
the fires of death burn high.
The time has come for the king to die. (Lead Guitar: Mike)
A whole world is mourning the loss of their king.
In sorrow a new day dawning.
Now the princess is their everything.
A procession to the chambers where they kiss their fathers
ring.
Can you hear the angel of sadness sing... with broken wings.
(Harmony: Andreas)
And with death came disorder, who were they now to obey?
No leader, no followers.
No trust, no faith.
The princess is too young to tame a land, a new king must be
chosen.
In search for such a man of trust there will be contradicti-
ons.
Coming forth on desert ground, the incarnation of a king in
sleep profound.
Another self-proclaimed king, set to rule in the new empire.
On a mission to save the forsaken ones and to re-light the
dying fire.
The crowd was confused and divided in two, a battle was about
to begin.
Another man with a will as strong declared a war to win.
His army of believers was faithful, mighty and brave.
Set to capture the liar, to forever enslave.
His troops were marching on to the battlefield to set this
world on fire.
His forces are never giving yield.
[War! They fought for what would be a blood-stained crown.
Utter chaos supreme.
The sand absords the colour of dawn.
Nevermore shall they dream, nevermore.]
The years went by under a blood-red sky, the king still sup-
press the rebellian lie.
He is the one, the self-chosen son, master of the throne he
rules upon.
The sacred child awakened from her crystal sleep.
And the earth was shaking, and the people prayed for their
souls to keep.
The light of day is flowing into her virgin eyes.
Oh, the sun is stolen.
A dark formation in the skies.
Unites the powers in her eyes.
Her soul's inhaling all the living light.
Bringing on the dark, eternal night.
Gathering evil in all its might.
Seven years.
Purity.
Innocence.
Dignity.
Hail, hail the queen!
Ruling supreme.
She is queen alone in the human zone, dethroned the king unpure.
The masses were assured, she fought without a sword.
She regained their hope and faith.
Draining the liar in the crimson water.
To bring him eternal pain.
His soul is slaughtered.
Eternalizing bane.
Scream in silence, no one shall hear his cries encaged.
The unroyal king, surrended to the child of life divine.
A hundred fortnights passed but still no signs of aging.
Her endless youth... amazed, the world was raging.
A shattered race in this broken land this child came to resto-
re, like an order from the gods.
The queen and all the children gathered around the chambers
where the elder ones are joined
in sleep profound.
In wrath she crush the tanks of crystal glass.
The crimson water gushed on to the ground in the unholy mace-
cration.
Their souls no longer cried.
Die!
Their gift are denied.
[She drinks the life-blood from the feebled man.
Empty bodies, soul-drained by the vrigin queen.
Finally given the pleasure to die.
She aligns the hate inside their hearts.
Her chosen knights will make sure all life departs.
Soon comes the end of all, she watched a chamber fall.
She heard her master call.]
"Live my words, oh, sacred child. You're soon to leave this
world defiled."
"Then what awaits me my lord?"
"Trust me my child, your wishes shall not be ignored"
And then he spoke his mind, now his will is hers.
"The earth shall fall. The eternal curse is cast on the sands
they walk.
Now you must use your power. Show the human race you are the
one.
Use their trust forever and then deceive their weakened minds.
Fool them to destroy themselves in hopelessness.
Belie their seeds, belie their dreams. Hope has ceased to be."
The people worshiped their queen.
Such beauty before her time was unseen.
Their were fooled by her presence and disguise.
Faithfully they listened and swallowed all her lies.
"The times are changing, re-arranging he pattern of our lives.
So let your heart stop beating beneath this twisted sky."
They were embraced by sadness, but not afraid to die.
"So pass this sacred dagger and let yourself fly free.
So pretend you're dreaming and rise above this world of you
and me."
[Liar!
All those who died with you by their side were denied access
to the higher ground.
Betrayal.
Eternal detest from the ones left unblessed, so possessed.
Their last caress was your knife in their hearts.
Fed from her deed, watching them bleed.
In her own conceit, a world to delete, lies at her feet.
Her demon inside do no longer hide.
Showing its face of hate and disgrace leaving their saviour
unpraised.]
The ones who didn't follow.
Now sharing this moment of grief.
The end of their own existence?
In death they had no belief.
Despite all the faith in their queen they couldn't believe
what they had seen.
What was the reason for this sacrifice.
Nothing is gained from this great demise.
After the ordeal we know she has the powers to decieve us all.
But their dream of sons and daughters has made them standing
tall.
For the king had showed them it could be done when his woman
gave birth to the sacred one.
But is she of man, made of flesh and blood, or is she the
offspring of the unholy
[God?]
A leader was chosen to unveil the hidden truth.
The brave ones were gathered, the strongest were sent to the
queen.
Her reason to be must be known.
After many moons the troopsreach the temple of their majesty.
Guarded by a hundred faithful knights.
There is no escape, there's no entry to her sacred halls.
Is our vision true or false?
They rtied to find the answer but they were led astray into a
maze of slumper far from the light of day.
The riddle remained unanswered.
The queen could read ones mind, make sure that no one will find
the reason for her mission here.
The highness writhe in anger, her trust had been betrayed.
The queen was filled with langour, her decision has been made.
She would unleash her hate.
Destined to devastate.
She heard her demons roar, marching into war.
The spirit of their beloved king ho spoke unto his men, he
came to bring a message
of great importance and trust.
"The gift from the gods has come to cover the world in dust.
Her forces are closing in to your sanctuary.
So use your imagination to end her reign.
Remember these words, and be strong!"
The chosen few were sacrificed for the others life.
They were the bait, they would seal the soldiers fate.
A massive grave, to break the soldiers spell.
The forces fell into the abyss, never to rise again.
Towards the queen the last of the brave ones wandered,
to terminate this creature non-divine.
The loss of troops forced her powers to release the magic
uncontrolled that had wasted a thousand soul.
The palace controlled by demons is the heart of all evil pos-
sessed by the queen and her unholy servants.
"If we destroy it, the earth will be ours and it will bring us
eternal existance.
We'll pray for the gift of breeding. This is a game we can't
concede,
it is worth all the blood we may bleed. We must close the gate
so she can't return. We'll seal her fate, watch her temple
burn and
we'll capture her soul in the chambers of crimson sleep.
And there she will suffer eternally for what she has done to
man.
We fought our way into her dwelling-place, we searched the
corridors
of this infernal maze, to seek our enemy the one to slay.
We are the ones, we will not obey.
A disillusioned servant with great knowledge in her secrets,
we found him walking aimlessly trying to find his peace.
He said:
'Cover her eyes, they are the root of her inhuman forces.
Then she's just the child you thought she,
disconnect all her sources.'"
They found a way to blind her and it could cost some lives.
But they must seal the entry from where all evil derives.
Two of the brave ones were sent to distract her while the
others made their way
to behind her throne.
She saw her enemies for the last time
as their leader covered her eyes.
We saw the return of innocence, the symbol of purity we once
knew.
We carried her to the chambers to forever lock-up her soul.
And now the reborn earth, blessed with the gift of birth can
see her in this cage
that eternally preserves her rage.
They captured all her soldiers and forever encaged their
cries.
They had found a new leader to worship.
A king with her clear-blue eyes.Yeah, come on everybody, get your weapons up and sing
Yeah, here we go, here we go, here we go now
I'm drowning in hatred
I'm falling down onto my knees in prayer
And I will pray for my lord
To kill my enemies
I will sacrifice

Spitting out, spitting out, spitting out
Can I feel down into your heart?
Can my love heal your fears?
He's ready to meet his maker but now
Doesn't matter how many will die
He can't wait to see those open golden gates
Watch his whole life flash before his eyes
Yeah, he's ready to meet his maker but now
Doesn't matter how many will die
But as the bomb blows his body in half
He reads the writing on the wall for the very first time
That says, "You never mattered"
It says "You never mattered"
You never mattered
You're not ready
You're not ready
You're not ready for this
You're not ready for this
You're not ready for this apocalyptic and cryptic script

(poems by bartsch - december 92)
When the dark lord told me to live
I felt the raised lust of possession
afterwards the death yell of an impaled nine-eye
gotten through my dutiful ears
i had to think of all the lost creatures
which strived of their existence
in the streaming of my black blood
nocturnal shadows, which glorified
the resurrection like trumpets
offered me the right way into hopelessness
enlighten my path into inaccessible licence
but though a blessed aspiration after mercy
fled from the eternal solitude
and discovered the deliverance
with the beauty of a rotten insect.It came from dismal shadows
Creeping, sudden, from behind.
fell upon my merry whistle
darkened me at heart and sight.
Back with me, one again with the memory
Again I behold the ruins
that I left when I was all devoured by wrath.
Last night out in the timber
a thousand torrent's vehemence
came rushing through my veins
Up my throat and filled the eyes,
And then that I knew
all pain will be undone
When I pack my bags
And depart for lonely roads
And with courageous verve I stride
chop the heads off flowers aside, still wondering
How come you never bleed
When I stab right into your back.
How come you never choke
When I drown you in the sea.
Merely hours passed
that I had left him to his mountains
his colossal idols - one for every spear in me.
Slopes so steep,
I could not conquer in a lifetime.
Now they're all but ruins,
Ruins I left behind.
And with courageous verve I stride
chop the heads off plants aside, still wondering
How come you never bleed
When I stab right into your back.
How come you never choke
When I drown you in the hot and burning sea.
There is always one waiting for me, my beloved
I shall be with her again so soon.
craving for her lips, her kiss
Her hair in summer winds
The morning dew dripping down her breasts.
Shadows and Flames.
I have been demure
Cries were silent but heart ablaze.
have been one of his shadows
Condemned to stray an unlit maze.
My feet are numb, soles torn wide open
After endless years of clambering
My path is lit and leads me north.
And with courageous verve I stride
chop the heads off flowers aside, still wondering
How come you never bleed
When I stab right into your back,
How come you never choke
When I drown you in the hot and burning sea?you look back
and the ocean
are colored black
animals are going sick
the reason is the black slick
no green
is able
to remain
by the toxic acid rain
that's called polutionParrot, squatting on your throne, mentally captured, are you?
Foot-soldered concrete rooted in basement, alone.
Corporeality relinquished. Fictive molecules revolt.
Soliloquies like apparition of a long forgotten ghost.
Lonely Solipsist, sculpture squatting in a cell!
Anchored pedometry, concrete throne.
Posture vocal like your inflective prose, tethered philosophy, encrypted psychiatry.
Powers of rendition on a capricious world, a pawn.
Monet inclination for thoughts spoken never heard.
Tragic auditorium for one Pygmalion soul.
Manas in transcendence through an infinite cosmos.
Destruction.
Destruction is the ultimate creation so, your children, dont regret.
Like those to their divine inventions, like all to the planet.
So, Lonely Solipsist, what rhyparography floods my eyes?
Bituminoid lucidity, in trafficked lumens, hides.
What would happen if your trompe-loeil was exposed?
One brain stacked up eight heads high in perfect proportion.
Gravid knowledge crush the skulls in savage rebellion.
Design by observation, translated erudition, so many creators cognitively collide like a pride of pan-psychics.
Upon whom redounds this insistent obloquy? Power of observer granted power of intent. The Painters brush the Writers words, the sinners repent.
I declare this pen a syringe! Injecting foreign brains!
Obligor objectivist base knowledge on fiction anyways.
Pass the blame like nested Russian Dolls, inertly decaying. Smite the epiphenomenalism! Erase those bound to faith!Television
The means of worldwide infection
A gesture of illicit excursions
Relentless
No sign of the defenses
Staggering
Militant advertising
Raping deep with the gift of persuasion
An act of desperation
A tradition
Based on intimidation
Of destruction
Maul the opposition
An illusion
Of democracy
No conclusion
Long live the legacy
Irritate the masses
Like asbestos in the lungs
Reduce my flesh to plastic
The needle hits the vein
Advance decline
The visual narcotic
Preys in sequence
Parading in the essence of demons
One by one
Rise of the political hoodlum
Brainwash residue
Your neck in the revolving noose
Trapped in the depths of illusion
Trembling so violently
Division in the family
Domestic casualties
Degrees of manipulation
Post fetal position
Monopolize on the ignorant
Serenade the mysteries
Of the genetic stimulantsEndless fear, darkness holds me
I don't know it I am wrong or right
Where is my world that I loved so before?
All has gone, bleeding, dying
You don't know what you have done to me
Left me hollow inside, feel like dirt
I wanna slam you, just wanna kill you
All I want to see is you, lying down in pain
Forever I will hate you
Is all that I can say
Leaving the ghost of you behind
Tears of sorrow I will never spill again
Scratching your face out of my mind
Are you really sure what you wanna be now?
It's just a fake to me, yes
Fuck yourself and die a painful death
I don't need you to love me anymore
Get away and leave my life alone
One step away of twisting your neck
The crown of the human race
Fuck you, is it really youSorrow and grief
Alone i walk
Across fields
Of crimson flowers
Frozen in time
This eternity is mine
From my wounds
I won't recover
Night-time tears
In silence i see the world pass by
I watch new fears
From the pits of my soul they arise
Broken and torn
My soul is forlorn
On this endless plain
Of tombs and ashes
Every tear i have cried
is marked with a stone
My emotions are buried
Deep in the soil
I bury my ashes
My earthly remains
Silent i weep
Dark gods whisper my name
Hell awaits
Alone i stand outside its gate
Let me now in
Let me enter my dark kingdom come
And now the darkness
Surrounds my lonely soul
As i lived i now die
All alone
I reap the fruits
From the seed i once sowed
The grapes of oblivion
Delight my soul
I vanish in the darkness
On this gloomy plain i fade away
I leave a life in sadness
In this realm of shadows i'd rather stayCornered long-pig at the edge of the corral
Ascending heart rate makes for succulent portions
Capillary beds fill to the point of explosion
In an orgasmic decapitation of human cattle
De-boned and skinned
Preparation shall now begin
On the menu a hairless goat
In green mucus pesto your pieces float
Garnishing the platter
Cerebral pieces of grey matter
Soup bowl-an unspent bladder
A choice dish within the splatter
Human adipose to make you fatter
Breaded tendons dipped in batter
Cessation of your life?
Long-pig-culinary cadaver
Your destiny-a quiche of human giblets
Nae you die
-meat to cleaver-manveal breeder-
gratuitous overflow from the jugular
buckets of blood
-sanguine bleeder-compost eater-
into bloodmeal-you're left to putrify
whet appetite
the realization that you are simply flesh is now fatally apparent?
Your funeral was a buffett.
A delightful blend of your decay
A menu made of your obituary
My complements to the chef?Clad in armour, strong of will
Eye for an eye, kill for a kill
"Allah Ahkbar", "God wills it"
Cross and half moon in total war
"Allah Ahkbar", "God wills it"
No quarter given, life evened the score
"Allah Ahkbar", "God wills it"
Moving into the holy land
"Allah Ahkbar", "God wills it"
Empires clashing in desert sand
Jerusalem a city lit
Did God demand? Did God forbid?
Pilgrims slaughtered by Saracen band
Saracens slaughtered by Christian hand
Templar Van Ruddervoorde in command
Templars' grandmaster of the Flemish land
Battling Saladin, knight of the moon
At the siege of Acre meeting his doom
Outnumbered he fell, in a far away land
The templars' life took an end
Azure eyed and golden haired
Forth the knights templar fared
While above troops devoted
Heraldic banners floatedWho are you to judge me ?
Who the fuck are you ?
Fuck your line of conduct
All your fuckin' rules
Fuck your puritanism
Your false chastities
Fuck your line of conduct
All your fuckin' rules
Fuck your economy
The one that kills the weak
You know the refusal that I have
of everything that comes from you
The same denial
You give to me and my freedom
Yeah Yeah Yeah Reject for me
Fight against the war
All kind of repression
Fight against elitism
Roots of all iniquity
Fuck your puritanism
Your false chastities
Fight against prejudices
We don't wanna be a victim
Fight against the war
Fight against the war
Fight against the war
Fight against the war
All kind of repression
Ref.
I can't stand it any longer
I can't stand it any longer
There's no need to give you
My faith,my confidence and myself
Fuck your line of conduct
All your fuckin' rules
Fuck your puritanism
Your false chastities
Fight against the war
All kind of repression
Fight against elitism
Roots of all iniquity
We are the resistance
The deterrent force now
Now we're so different
But together so complete
We're a tribe but so lonely
We're free
And at the same time
Prisoners.
I cry.
Not tribe just so lonelyYour eyes are full of hate, forty one,
That's good
Hate keeps a man alive, its gives him strength
While cutting their shadows, kill them into the dark trough
Black is all the way, furious never-ending darkness show
Only way could be hard in their small and human nation
I kill the first man, getting by death, we are God, through death
[Chorus]
Go, get up, victims that died
Waiting for death, I should cry
Take the farther off to cut your means,
Listening up for afraid by means,
They showed laughing me for my heart
So they wake up these scythes, following me,
Cold wind blow out, now to go,
Let it go again with the scythes
(Something wild!)
It`s got the light, blow it out within you
Never let the best shot come from fucking Avalon, that`s the one
Time to feel my spirit, I gathered my souls
Beat my night to kill them into my sin (doom, get up!)
[Chorus]
I can`t wait to for my heart
I can`t get up, shadows, down (can't get up!)
Set them along, time is right, far too along
They wake me up (wake me up!)Life sometimes feels like a nightmare
When every step you take is a wrong one
With only binary choices there
Seeming fair?
They say that time does slowly heal
But memories amplify the pain I feel
Forever haunting me, it's so unreal
And still we dream... as we walk down the line...
We forever sleep
Since ages dead inside
A plunge red shrine
Emotions and hope subside
Foul like altar wine
Life sometimes into a nightmare
When every step you take is a wrong one
With only binary choices there
Seeming fair?
Not when luck has gone
And I said
Not when luck has gone
Living a life beyond light
With darkness to pattern my fate
Feelings left aside
Left with despair and nothing but hate
Left to witness
The final fall of mankind
No outcome of existence
Life sometimes even seems like it goes on
Still every step you take is a wrong one
Maybe you can wake up anytime you like
But you can never leave
You will never achieve
The feeling that life goes on
Or are we already gone?
Left to witness
The final fall of mankind
No outcome of existence
Floods my heart and mind
A lifeless thing in living guise
Leaping off to quick demise
A blind man in a cave of eternal light
Remnants of a dream that fades
Life at times is hard to comprehend
But every step leads further to the end
Still even death is but a guess
And darkness weaves with many shades
Darkness weaves with many shades
Take a look beyond the silver glades
See darkness weave with many shadesI'm hearing your reproachful words / Within seconds my rage is blackening me
out / This feeling is way too much for me / I'm crying out my disbelief /
Can't handle you showing discontent / After all this time you do not know me
at all / Can't you just handle the truth / You're letting me down
forevermore / Reality becoming crystal-clear / Don't bother me with your
pathetic dreams / You stigmatised my fate / I would die for seeing you
suffer my disbelief / This is the end of the line / Not endless after all /
You've got to get away from here / Far away from hereOh yeah!

ZIN'S ATROCIOUS PRIMORDIAL VAULTS
AND THE GODS HAVE CURSED MEMusic: Mikael Dahl - Lyrics: Dahl, Gtesson
1660, a child was born,
who grew up to be a man of greed and scorn
Born a noble, but denied his legacy,
young Adrian began a life of piracy
Possessed with a hunger for gold crowns,
and bloodlust in a heart so cold
All ships that he met went down
to the bottom, released from gold
His dark reputation was growing,
and so did the prize on his head
The streams of blood and gold were flowing,
and most rulers wanted him dead
Pre Chorus
Blinded by his greed he made a name in history
Great tall ships and many men met their destiny
Oh, but he could not see
how his end would be,
to hang from a tree
for his piracy
Chorus
And so the legend was born
about the king of the seven seas
Adrian Blackwood was his name
And still no one has found
the treasure from the wild plundering
times, when the seven seas were ruled
by gunpowder, blood and gold
His downfall was caused by treason,
with kings gold his crew were bought
Jealousy and greed were the reasons
when Blackwood the Cruel was caught
Pre Chorus
Chorus
Solo Both, Dahl, Both
ChorusThose who are a waste of life
Use up air that others could breathe
Human leaches all around
Looking superion is what they believe
Fake is the word you represent
Your existence on earth I resent
At the cost of others you get by
Each word that you speak is a lie
Low life
That's all you'll ever be
Lies in effect
That's what you like to see
Hiding behind material values
That help cover up your weakness
Never to change, always to look
For an easy way out of life
A pathetic excuse for a human being
Nothing to back you up, never giving second thought
Thinking you fool the world, into seeing something you are not
Fake is the word you represent
Your existence on earthj I resent
At the cost of others you get by
Each word that you speak is a lie
Low life
That's all you'll ever be
Lies in effect
That's what you like to seeInto the dark dimension we drift
Accelerating decay
Speed of life fastens so swift
The black hole dragging in
Dark dimension, we hail to the one
Imprecating upon good
Never realized the meaning of pain
To our hearts, to our souls
The cryptic carnal race
Feeling the dead, keeps dancing our souls into our graves
Forever gone, apocalyptic view of what will be
Enrichment of our lives by the pain we share
The dark dimension will rise
Eternally
The dark dimension will rise
Reality slips, the ground is giving way
The human end, controlled by hate, together we'll face our death
Defeated by ourselves, so cold and dead
Dark dimensioned nation, utopiaReason. This demigod, unto which you cluster.
Sacrilege. You sacrifive the purity of the air beneath your wings.
A slow and painful ritual to burn the youth you lost.
Demigod. Blasphemers walk among your flock.
Despite your blindfold, proudly you carry the stone on your back.
Disillusioned. You plant your feet safely to the ground.
Demigod. Blasphemers walk among your flock.
As the stone you have become.
Not once did you cry for the lost ones of your world.
Your care is limited to this demigod, onto which you cluster.
Reason. Decrystallize me. Demigod. I do blaspheme.
The fallen you condemn. Your heart even free of hate.
Yet, scared to death by their disbelief. To ordinary common sense.
And with autumn closing in. Forcing life away.
No mercy wil impale your sin. Dead are your tears.Slit open the skies and let out my stars
The night dies inside me
She's got ways to make me crawl
I respond like a machine
The sun shines from a thin sky
And these feelings they die
In the minds of the blind
Patterns red of love so dead
Under the floors, the dark woods they come back
Dark they needn't be, but your virgin blood is dead
The spark faded and gone
All the stars in her skin
The repulsion as I sin
She's roaring through my soul
All dressed in thoughts of flesh
With a beautiful wound I was born
It was all that I knew to own
Stardrowned
All the stars in her skin
The repulsion as I sin
She's roaring through my soul
Sears my nakedness my flesh
StardrownedAlle Farben dieser Welt
TrÃ¤gst du in dir
Doch weil du das nicht siehst
Bist und bleibst du ein Faschist
Die Bedeutung kennst du nicht
Doch die Wahrheit kommt ans Licht
Ich hasse die Rassen
Sie wurden geschaffen
Von Menschen die nach Kriegen trachten
Ich zÃ¤hle jetzt bis drei
Dann geht der Schmerz vorbei
Ich schlieÃe die Augen zÃ¤hl:
EINS!
Um mich wird es still
ZWEI!
Ich erkenne wer ich bin
DREI!
Vergessen ist die Wut und der Hass
Weil die Masse Rassen hasst, hasst du sie auch
Und weil du hasst, ist Liebe stets fÃ¼r dich verloren
Zum Rassenhassen auserkoren
Keine PlÃ¤ne dieser Blender
ErklÃ¤ren uns zum Tier
Eine Rasse und Menschen sind wir!
Kein Gen das uns unterscheidet
Alle Leben Menschlichkeit
Keine Grenzen, keine Rassen
Wenn der Preis Frieden heiÃt
Schluss, kein Blut und kein Wegzoll
Sinnlose Hassparolen
Vergesst nicht was Recht ist
Wenn Blutrache Gesetz ist
Ich zÃ¤hle jetzt bis drei
Dann geht der Schmerz vorbei
Ich schlieÃe die Augen zÃ¤hl:
EINS!
Um mich wird es still
ZWEI!
Ich erkenne wer ich bin
DREI!
Vergessen ist die Wut und der Hass
Weil die Masse Rassen hasst, hasst du sie auch
Und weil du hasst, ist Liebe stets fÃ¼r dich verloren
Zum Rassenhassen auserkoren
Die missbrauchte Wissenschaft
Diente Satansplan
Das Bewerten von Rassen ist inhuman
Medizin gibt kein Recht, wer ist gut und wer ist schlecht
Falsche Expertisen, ja Verbrechen wurden nachgewiesen
Die Anleitung zum Massenmord
Viele wurden auch vertrieben
Ramadan und Chanukka
Zigeuner und ein Schwulenpaar
Tief in den KÃ¶pfen steckt Wut
Sie alle folgen blind dem Rassenwahn, tja
Ein FÃ¼hrer bringt uns Hass und lÃ¤sst Terror regnen
Aus jeder Zelle meines Geistes spricht der Widerstand
Doch vergebens
Die Vergangenheit lÃ¤sst nur eine MÃ¶glichkeit zu kÃ¤mpfen
Gegen die Vergesslichkeit
Weil die Masse Rassen hasst, hasst du sie auch
Und weil du hasst, ist Liebe stets fÃ¼r dich verloren
Zum Rassenhassen auserkoren
Die missbrauchte Wissenschaft
Diente Satansplan
Das Bewerten von Rassen ist inhuman
Medizin gibt kein Recht
Wer ist gut und wer ist schlecht
Wir sind bereit!
FÃ¼r das letzte Gefecht!
Aus jeder Zelle meines Geistes spricht der Widerstand
Diesen steinigen Weg gehen wir Hand in Hand
Gemeinsam sind wir eine Einheit

DÃ©jÃ -vu I fall apart
Five minutes falling back
With my electroheart
I feel divine
It's like I travel faster
As I reboot
The darkness has no empathy
It's hard to see
I feel the world is shattered
In tears they cry
Am I about to be erased?
About to be erased

To make them struggle hard
I reap their tears
Bring harvest from their misery
Repent, repeat
The force of life is scattered
Indeed I try to cleanse it
To infinity
About to be erased

I'm unretrofied
For you I'll just fake it
In the end just save it
For a new song and leave dead
In the end time is wasted
In the end wood paneled wagon
Carpool dragons
Killing me again
Now they're looting our holes
Until there is nothing left
Calloused intentions it seems,
Coward's invention at best
I'm unretrofied
For you Jesus can't play the music
Caused he's nailed to the cross
And over gnawed off feet I find
That I can't walk
I can't even walk
We're all deadSound asleep deep in the !maternal womb
!Suconsciously dreaming aspects of his future reign
The Antarct, Prince of the Pillorian Age
He who will rule in the Gallow's Land
Reigning in soil, water, fire & air
King of the four elements
Entrance is broken to a new dimension
Where wisdom is virtue and opression [oppression?] defied
In the South
In the West
Hear the conclusion of the ravens' quest
From the North
And the East
Moving closer to be his guests
Sleep on...
Sleep on...
Your time will come
I've passed onto you the legacy of the Pillorian Age
Eternal is your inheritance
Far beyond the limits of your physical life
Your word will live !on !on people's lips
The word of the sleeping Antarct, king of kings
Visions of Gallowenia, Utopia of the Darkgreed for cash causes your blindness
creates obsession for might and fame
guide the flames for the endless time
unleashes your desire
greed - obsession - it burns in you
desire - for more and more
greed - obsession attracts a new
desire - for more and more
your inner addiction destroys your life
not noticed your brain eaten back to life
contaminates your thoughts
destroys your life more and more
desire makes you mindless
it kills every emotion in your heart
releases the pressure from your soul
estranged from society of manWe all know that
Time is the worst enemy of men
runs fast and never comes back
and even though we think to be free
There is no way out
We're all prisoners of it
So one last time, stay by my side
between the sea and the stars
Read through the scars in my mind
and you'll see the beauty of life again
Leaf through the pages of my heart
and you'll see the way I got these scars
I know it's useless to speak my mind at this point
but there must be a way, to get rid of this weight
I am just trying to understand what the past tastes like
what is right, what is wrong
what is worth and what is not
Sometimes I wish I could have had more time
to makes things clear, to explain how I felt
The time we wasted left it's mark on me
That no one will ever erase...
Leaf through the pages of my heart
and you'll see the way I got this
Leaf through the pages of my heart
and you'll see the way I got these scars
So one last time, stay by my side
between the sea and the stars
Read through the scars in my mind
and you'll see the beauty of life again
I am just trying to understand what the past tastes like
what is right, what is wrong
what is worth and what is not
Sometimes I wish I could have had more time
to makes things clear, to explain how I felt
The time we wasted left it's mark on me
That no one will ever erase...Your eternal my love.
For me your all there ever was.
Every limit overcome.
As we are tangled we are one.
Words are left unsaid, burning in my head.
Now I only wish I could hold you again.
Being there with you, I feel at ease.
Being there with you is all I ever need,
My one believe, we share a common energy.
I've flown a far beyond the sea,
To find the other side of me.
I've waited long and patiently,
To find the one to balance me.
To live without,
This is my common entity.
Life feels empty my love,
It pains me so to give you away.
Sentence untold never to unfold.
Now I only wish I could hold you again.
Being there with you I am whole again.
Being there with you is all I ever need,
My one believe, we share a common energy.
I've flown a far beyond the sea,
To find the other side of me.
I've waited long and patiently,
To find the one to balance me.
To live without this is my common entity
My one believe.
You're all I need, my one believe.
The winds of time will carry me.
To live without
Don't let this out.[I Andante]
Neiget ein tag sich
Der himmel verblaBt

Sie flustern von ewigem licht
Flustern ewiges licht
Stilles shnen erwacht
Spurt das bluhen der nacht
Flustern ewiges licht
Weist im glanze ganz sacht
Auf verborgene macht

Ein beet aus tausend traumen
Entfaltet seine bluten
Kuhler hauch umwehet
Das fiebernde gemut
Hinaus in dunkle weiten
Auf schwerer dufte flugeln
Benetzt vom sternenschimmer
Von klarem sang betort

Egal wies heute wird, wiiiird, wiiiiird, wiiird....I am scared to breathe your name
whenever we dissolve to blame:
but one day we will learn to fly
back to treasureland.
Somewhere someone investigates
we appeal to our experience;
this inner worth is inner war
we're longing for colors
as if we'd starve ...
Still in perigee
still in liberty.
Still in reach
still in me.
Oh so red the cage
the seizure
is my guard
and leader
never I have been
in such a warmth
before.
Oh so silent sleeps
the planet
healers,
are you near
I need another vision
I can trust
and feed.
We are the dead
dead ringers
we are in search
of our birth.Downward the shores we pass
Clouds bathed in sombre twilight
Dust beneath our dragging feet
The crumbled shapes of your image
Left behind the dreams of a time
That is fading away tirelessly
Paralyzed we are
The light of old aged stars
We kissed the girls, we drank the wine
So why the hell not die
We cried out our songs to indifferent ears
So why the hell not die
And fall into oblivion
And fall into oblivion
[Incomprehensible]
When it comes to the dying season
Will you stay right at our side?
When we leave this place together
Through the glens of the afterlife
At the shores of the tranquil sea
Waves take the land tirelessly
Take our thoughts away
To the light of old aged stars
Still in my mind
Still in my mind
Only among the stars, there lies freedom
Only among the stars, there is eternity
Only for one short moment our lives do last
Until all the memories are wasted away
From the shores out of our galaxy
We kissed the girls, we drank the wine
So why the hell not die
We cried out our songs to indifferent ears
So why the hell not die
We kissed the girls, we drank the wine
So why the hell not die
We cried out our songs to indifferent ears
So why the hell not die
And fall into oblivion
And fall into oblivion
And fall into oblivion
We're falling
And fall into oblivion
And fall into oblivion
And fall into oblivion
We're falling
And fall into oblivion
And fall into oblivion
And fall into oblivion
We're falling
And fall into oblivion
And fall into oblivion
And fall into oblivion
We're fallingA flash like the birth of a sun
A pillar of virgin fire
Now glowing a ruby cloud
The finger of death reaching higher
Radiant dust a chimney rise
Desert floor dissolved wide ablaze
Golden plum against the midnight sky
Burning eyes in death clouds ash grey face
I have harnessed the stars
Now unleashed upon the earth
I am become death
The destroyer of worlds
Encased in lead and steel
The end and infinity
The eight moon the sixth day the year death
The heatwave to grasp and consume your last breath
Brought high on are marked silver wing
Afar in cold thin morning air
Below as the day begins
The burning eyes in deaths face greedily stares
I have harnessed the stars
Now unleashed upon the earth
I am become death
The destroyer of worldsInto the crypts
The pits of the end
We are thrown towards the black
The earth opens wide for our violent descend
Nightmare visions attack
Tired lives in regression
Vicious circles close
Upon a world of chaos
Lack of time will take its' toll
Sadistic bondage of mankind
Under the whip - a hatred blind
Inject the pain then leave you dry
You're falling back - A feast for flies
Unholy furnace - Your funeral pyre
Perpetual demise - No fucking afterlife
Under the whip!
Hunted down hard you beg for relief
From stress - From pressure - From life
Pain will plague uout lives built on deceit
Your dreams of utopia were lies!
Sadistic bondage of mankind
Under the whip - a hatred blind
Inject the pain then leave you dry
You're falling back - A feast for flies
Unholy furnace - Your funeral pyre
Perpetual demise - No fucking afterlife
Under the whip!
Deafened by the beat of vulture wings
As they circle overhead
They ride the wings of retallation
Upon an unsuspecting prey descend
On the receiving end of a hatred blind
Darkness closes in on tired lives
Hounds of hell encircle thee
Under the whip - Our nightmares come alive!
Inject the pain then leave you dry
You're falling back - A feast of flies
Unholy furnace - Your funeral pyre
Perpetual demise - No fucking afterlife
Under the whip!
Sadistic bondage of mankind
Under the whip - a hatred blindGo tell this town I've built them all their coffins
as for this face
best to be forgotten
"baby baby, I've got a reason to leave but I'm not going far
baby baby, come on I'm begging you, please, I'm not the one in chains"
"they call me Jesse James and I own the night life
I drift from town to town across the nation
praise the lord
lock and load boys
we go down
we go down
we go down together"
your gun's firing blanks
no way out
go thell this town I've built them all their coffins
as for this face
best to be forgotten
hell's on its way
no one's gonna stop it
I wear the suit
no one's gonna top meNobody can be back
From that forgotten land
The furthest one, the blac
Lonely and gloomy sand
The bridge's narrow and thin
The sentry waits patiently
People to pass it
In despair but valiantly
No one reduced his pace
No one looked back with grief
No one changed his face
No one felt relieved
You sense their noisy treads
And look the stone face
And they seem the dead
Of a forgotten race
Last land, last land
With the sword in my hand
Just a word I can hardly say
While our foe we slay, Walhalla
Mighty Odin just states
No surrender but defeat
Real warriors learn too late
That die is like to beat
Glory in war is always better
Than honor, love and wealth
Written in golden letters
Present and future destroyed by strength
All of them have been killed
Without dropping their blade
Ranks of gods have been filled
To make war when giants invades
Valkyries have chooses their sore
Warriors doomed the fall
Leading them into war
In the days of ArmageddonVessels sink, men go under
I don't wanna die, it feels like cancer
A bridge-collapse, a train that flies
I'm scared of the screams that fill the skies
You're not gonna die, he says, he lies
Feel hell underfeet, I feel how it fries
Second by second I sink underneath
Second by second I sink underneath
It wears me down
It Wears Me Down
All of me, all of me, all of me down
Woods swallowing men with cold,
dark, beasts and deep blue skies
Quaking earth, winds that wipe
creations of man away like dust
I reach out to fathom all of my kin
I have none, that is sin
Alone we die like cattle in storm
Alone we die like cattle in storm
It Wears Me Down
It wears me down
It wears me down
All of me, all of me, all of me down"Hey man, heard you're a real clean shot!"
(When I've got a couple drinks in me, and I've got a couple drinks in me!)
"Hey man, heard you get the job done!"
(When I've got a couple drinks in me, I'm known to practice apathy!)
When you see me stagger
Know I'm being antagonized by what you can't hear
And just moving with the current
Current state of self embalment
Where I don't involve myself in human affairs
Just leave me an address on where I live
I'll make it slow and painful
I don't ask for much
(They will lead us out of town, straight out of town,
we can dodge the freight cars, just passerbys in the morning)
A few bills, and the occasional, occasional, occasional human touch
(I won't move if you won't move, and I won't move if you won't move,
trade cigarettes for stories, you and I the Lords of the Rails,
straight out of town and that is why we follow the pennies lay for we have stories and smokes)
Drink to take the edge off
I told you that I'd bring you my head
I told you I was better off dead
Have you heard the kind of shit that I've said?
Cause I'm a mad, mad man, no, I'm not a mad man.
I told you if you slipped me a drink...
I told you not to speak when I'm thinking
I told you I was having a hard time sleeping
I'm a sad, sad man, yeah I'm a real sad man!
There's empty bar stools
(To each of my sides)
And empty glasses
(So who the fuck's talking?)
And who's covering the tab?
Just a lonely man with a deathwish
(And a head full of crossed wires)
Making a deal with himself
(He keeps talking)
He keeps nodding
A SICK SON OF A BITCH
WILL ALWAYS END LIKE THISDo you think there's a chance
For this world to live in unity as one?
I can try to believe
But I feel it's like a view into the sun.
Blinded by the light everything will look so fine
But still I feel the rays are burning my soul.
So you say you believe
We can change the world together if we try.
I know we won't change.
When it comes to the point
Do you think we reach an aim that is too high?
I know we don't arrange.
But I know we're all the same
When the final curtain falls
And the sings on the way
Are leading us home
When I'm one with the world
I am one with my mind
Forget all the fury there's no need to cry
There's a place we all go, salvation to find
There's freedom to come
When I'm one with the world and my mind.
Do you feel, do you know?
There's an answer to the question when you're gone.
You're not alone.
You will see, we will see
Is there nothing or a better place to go?
We can't go wrong.
There are echoes in the wind
And they say don't be afraid
'cause the signs on the way
Are leading us homefrivolous leaking
of nuclear power plants
explodes the market
of mongoloid chants
who's next for charity
keep in line
crumbs are tasty
when intensions are fine
hands up who'll be our saviour
the future belongs to us
this is the future and it belongs to us
paradise of poverty, wonderland of war
the glory of gluttony is what we live for
moralizing innocence of uncorrupted youth
the illusion of discerning lies from truth
a conscious generation
with tears to wheep
for starving millions
and pity is cheap
who'll set the prices
when we sell our souls
who'll be the idol
to define our goals
who wants to be our saviour
the future belongs to us
this is the future and it belongs to us
paradise of poverty, wonderland of war
the glory of gluttony is what we live for
magnaninous messiah of things not
understood
the delusion of dividing evil from good
the unborn babies slain on the altar of freedom
it's the age of progress with thousands of new
ways to diesome day world war three will rage
and produce total global annihilation.
it will be the end of the age
and for great many lives the termination.
fire comes down from above,
the elements melt in the heat,
the heavens disappear with a roar.
atomic holocaust - final war.
the flesh of the wicked rot
while they are standing on their feet
their eyes rot in their sockets;
stench of burnies meat.
glaring lightning flashs tear
the darkness of the nuclear night.
mighty explosions erase the life work of mankind.
gigantic shock waves level towns with the ground.
mortal fallout covers everything
and brings the final death.
the sun is darkened,
the moon loses its light.
the stars fall from sky
and it is pitch dark night.
complete destruction - brutal mutilation.
complete destruction - total annihilation.
that day will be darkness
and come like a thief.
everywhere there will be destress.
so stay strong and believe!
stay strong and believe!
believe in jesus and have no fear,
because your redemption draws near.
"behold, i am coming soon!
my reward is with me
and i will give to everyone
according to what he has done!"
turn to jesus - trust in the holy son! (4 times)
believe in jesus and have no fear,
because your redemption draws near.
be alert! satan will deceive many people.
be prepared! for in the hour unknown
jesus christ will return!
to throw into the lake of fire
all what is evil.
to redeem the rightous and to kill the devil.
turn to jesus - trust in the holy son! (4 times)
believe in the word of christ
and you will survive.
stand firm until the end
and live the eternal life!

Never broke the silence
Never broke the ice
No more waiting
I gotta wipe her of my mind
Loving her is dying
Loving her is pain
Babylon I'm coming
Ready for the fray
I don't believe in your love
Tread on this bed of roses
I don't believe in your love
Don't give a fuck for roses
Don't give a damn for roses - No, no, no
You've been standing on the edge
Lost between the worlds of agony and ecstasy
Take your share boy straightaway
It's all heaven sent
She won't care
They call their love divine but it's all evil
Loving you was bleeding
So I had to break away
Darkness stretching out its hand
To save me from your sway
Cause loving you was wasting
Loving you was pain
Now angel of temptation
Open up the gate
I don't believe in your love
Tread on this bed of roses
I don't believe in your love
Don't give a fuck for roses
Loving you was bleeding
So I had to break away
Darkness stretching out it's hand
To save me from your sway
Cause loving you was wasting
Loving you was pain
Now angel of temptation
Open up the gate
Cause loving you was wasting
I don't believe in your love
Tread on this bed of roses
I don't believe in your love
Don't give a fuck for roses
I don't believe in your love - (I don't believe in your love)
Tread on this bed of roses - (This bed of roses)
I don't believe in your love - (No, I don't believe in your love)
Don't give a fuck for roses
No, I don't believe
I don't believe in your love
Your love, ooh, no, no, no, no
No, I don't believe in your loveSpawned from the Prime Material Plane
Sent to punish nature entire
The reptilian destroyer has been sent
By the Gods to end this world
He is a scaled biped
A true killing machine
With two horns upon his head and a lashing tail
He has claws akin to steel
And a reflective carapace
He'll trample the weak under and foot
His name is the Tarrasque
He sends fear throughout the valley
Though dormant half the turn
He arises to annihilate the ancient ways of old
His chest shall wield 100 gems and his body 10 magic shields
His scales are like pure rock forged from the deepest Abyss
Immunity to the heat and cold
The weak shall paralyse with fear
He devours from endless miles around
No shadows from his sight
Enshrouded in mystery
A hideous abomination of God
From the Elemental Princes of Evil
A gift of no return
A demon in a silver skin, a legend of forgone years
The Tarrasque shall live again
In the form of one whom is black
The blood of carrion shall fall
And devour holy flesh
This land shall be cleansed of filth
For he has the force of twelve
His powers remain intact; the ancient myths won't die
Spirit of a long forgotten past
Leaving nothing in his wake
Scaling the timeless landscape
Destroying all with his bestial hate
The horror for six is nigh
The task is at hand
The acts of mortal man are crushed by his fury and hate[Instrumental]Taas lapset pihalla nt

Taas siihen paikallesi ikkunaan jt, siihen ikkunaan jt
Lennt vuosien taa
Ne muistot pivittin sut valtaansa saa
Ne Joutsenlauluun etsii taas laulajaa, etsii taas laulajaa
Nuo hetket syntymst kuolemaan kun silmluomiin heijastuu
Saa toiset uskomaan kai Jumalaan, toiset Saatanaan, tai mihin vaan
Muttei kuitenkaan thn maailmaan
S kerran lysit mys sen
Tuon puolen vuosisadan rakkauden
Sun oli helppo olla onnellinen, olla onnellinen
Nyt mit vaistoillas teet
Kun linnut pesstn on pois lentneet
On en valokuvat kellastuneet, ne selaat taas uudelleen, ja taas uudelleen
Et ehk slini kaipaa, ei se saa tuskaa puutumaan
Tuo tuska laulun tmn kirjoittaa Tuo tuska kiinni saa kenet vaan
Tuo tuska kiinni saa
Suruhuntusi nt, se viisi vuotta sitten sai hengitt
Sut Joutsenlaulu silloin sai itkemn, sut sai itkemn
Tahtoisin olla niin kuin silloinkin, kun peityit huntuun valkoiseen
Se jnyt on jo ajan jalkoihin niin kuin sinkin
(solo)
Tahtoisin yritt ma ett silloin veden pinnalle jn
Kun joen tulvivan m uomista nn, kun joen tulvivan nn
Nuo naiset marketeissa krryineen ja miehet kantabaareissaan
Nuoruuden lhteist kai haaveilee, ja tuska laimenee, tai miten vaan
Taas hetken lhempn kuolemaa, ei haihdu tuska milloinkaan
Tuo tuska laulun tmn kirjoittaa, tuo tuska kiinni saa
Kenet vaan, tuo tuska kiinni saa kenet vain haluaaDead on the inside
Raised by wolves, in sheep's clothes
That abandoned me
but taught me to get up when, I fall on my knees
Man makes monster, monster kills man
Taking your crown's always been part of the plan
If you weren't so stuck in your own head, you'd be where I am now instead
Nobody's gonna hear you
When you're calling for help
When you're calling for help
Nobody's gonna hear you
because the sound of my screams are gonna drown you out
Drown you out
I've learned a lot but it took me too long to find out who I am
And to prove you wrong
How can you live before you die
When you're already dead on the inside
Dead on the inside
Dead on the inside
If you want an enemy I'll be the last one that you ever meet
But I can tell you now, that you don't stand a god damn chance against me
Nobody's gonna hear you
When you're calling for help
When you're calling for help
Nobody's gonna hear you
Because the sound of my screams are gonna drown you out
I've learned a lot but it took me too long to find out who I am
And to prove you wrong
How can you live before you die
When you're already dead on the inside
Fuck that, Fuck this
If you're gonna burn a bridge
You better hold your breath and learn to swim
Fuck that, Fuck this
If you're gonna burn a bridge
You better hold your breath and learn to swim
I've learned a lot but it took me too long to find out who I am
And to prove you wrong
How can you live before you die
When you're already dead on the inside
I've learned a lot but it took me too long to find out who I am
And to prove you wrong
How can you live before you die
When you're already dead on the inside
Dead on the insideDeath once walked this relic land
He came while all would sleep
Death held up his bony hand
And with it death did sweep
Across all land and water
With one gesture he did take
The lives of all man woman child
And deafening silence followed in his wake
Like stub before a shiny blade
All man fell by his scythe
Once the fever got you in its grasp
There is but one more day left of your life
Black Death
Pestilence
Black Death
Pestilence
The Lord has all forsaken
All must cleanse themselves from sin
Then rid oneself from lust
And take the holy spirit in
To redeem your pity selves
You all must flog your filth away
With nightfall cometh the shadows
Gather all the children of the Lord and pray
The shadow heavy upon this land
And still the stale air sway
In great numbers all around
The fallen lie as they fell to rot away
Black Death
Pestilence
Black Death
PestilenceJale, Jale, Jale
Donde cayo tu primer meco?
En el piso? Â¿En la cama?
En tus calzones?
Pervertido yo se lo que haces
El diablo te esta mandando
Con tu mano satÃ¡nica
Te sacas los mecos
Te va a crecer mano de chivo
Primer meco
A donde cayo tu primer meco?
En la panza de la puta?
En las nalgas de puerquita?
En el culo de borrego?
Pervertido no sabe lo que harÃ©
Mejor la puta que la mano
A lo mejor te caes en los rÃ­os de sida
sales con satanÃ¡s y jales jamas
Primer meco
Pervertido con la mano peluda
Tu pito se va joder
Una, dos, tres veces al dÃ­a
Pensando de "Trevi" te ayuda
Te vas a mandar al infiernoYou hit rock bottom, now where do you go from here?
Sunk down, locked up, all you do is disappear
All your promises are all just a pack of lies
You've got nothing, something you can't recognize
Why don't you take some responsibility?
You're pointing fingers and blaming everybody
Shudder to think if I lived like you
They would be shaking too, if they only knew
I can't take any more excuses
No longer needed and you don't have nay uses
Washed up, washed out, what more can I say
You better start filling out your resume
Why don't you take some responsibility?
You're pointing fingers and blaming everybody
Shudder to think if I lived like you
They would be shaking too, if they only knew
Everything was there for the taking
Too busy with the lying and flaking
Drugged up, fell out, too many second chances
Nothing else to do under the circumstances
Why don't you take some responsibility?
You're pointing fingers and blaming everybody
Shudder to think if I lived like you
They would be shaking too, if they only knewWay past overdrive
Full on redline
No easing up
Your life's flying by
Pushing and passing yourself
You've just passed
First over the finish
You still come in last
Face turning to stone
Your eyes owl wide
No easing up
More speed is your high
Look and feel twice your age
Grinding in your silent rage
Dying at twice the speed
Yet not enough to quench your need
Redline, foot to the floor
Redline, slow paced is a bore
Redline, yourself you've just passed
Redline, you still come in last
Redline, foot to the floor
Redline, slow paced is a bore
Redline, yourself you've just passed
Redline, you still come in last[R. Nattefrost '95]
The toes that you step on today may be
connected to the ass you'll be kissing tommorow.
These feelings are left from you.
Like a vast burning field
and then you submit yourself to me.
Perversion of the flesh.
With needles in thin skinned places.
The warm blood of life poured on the floor,
but who gives a shit when your life is a plague.
A rollercoster ride of pain.
I saw the white in your eyes.
Beat me, she said.
Cruel, violent shotgun love.
I kill you, point blank range.
I drank too much of the midnight wine,
disregardless of whatever i claim my throne.
Your voice kept ringin in my ears
like little echoes from yesterdays.
I did not want,
I did not feel.[Poetry : Arnault de Stael]
[Music : Romarik d'Arvycendres]
Triste et belle lueur
Qui d'un souffle s'endort
Vacillant faiblement
En attendant l'aurore
Son cour est une mche
Que son me consume
D'espoirs qui s'achvent
Ds les premires brumes
Je me retrouve en elle
Car sa vie n'est qu'un pleur
Qu'importent les raisons
Maintenant que vient l'heure
Adieu nuits dsols
Aux sombres clairs de Lune
Adieu parfum d'orage
Aux saveurs nocturnes
En guise de souvenir
sombres paysages
Je garderai en moi d'ternelles images
Des visages de femmes
Meurtrires assouvis
Sans sourires ni larmes
Conduiront mon esprit
Vous daignerez laisser
En un geste fidle
Sur ma dalle glace
Un bouquet d'immortelles
Et vous cher compagnon
Qui ftes plus que frre
De mes noirs difices
Conservez quelques pierres
De nos oeuvres sinistres
Poursuivez les travaux
Et qu'au-dessus des autres
Brillent encore nos joyaux
Cierge ple tu n'es plus
Qu'un volute, un parfum
Expirant vers les cieux
Un nouveau lendemain
A l'instant o je meurs
Et regarde en arrire
J'aperois dans mon cour
Un semblant de lumireCabbing it uptown
You're moving it uptown
You taxi it uptown uptown
And you're moving it southwest
You're cabbing it uptown
You're moving up sideways sideways
And you're cabbing it uptown uptown
Cabbing it uptown
Your business friend
Your business friend's Australian
And when he comes it's Gotterdamerung!
But you're cabbing it uptown
You're moving up south now
You're moving it uptown uptown
Sideways sideways
Main strips! Main strips!
People going, people going
Moving it uptown
And locked in the door bins
Slowly slowly
Jump in! Jump in!
You're cabbing it uptown uptown
But you know the best, Dan
I dunno where I am
I feel like crying
But cabbing it uptown
You're moving up sideways
Moving up slowly
You're cabbing it uptown
(Taxi!)
You'd better cab it up slowly
Moving in circles
A Shepherd's Bush man
Eats from a can
He taxi it southwest southwest
He moving it uptown uptown
Uptown Uptown
You'd better cab it up slowly
You'd better taxi it slowly
You'd better cab it slowly
You'd better cab it up
Jump in! Jump in!
Michael! Michael![Lyrics by Frode Glesnes]
[Music by Gerhard Storesund]
I've had my courage measured
By the great heroic death
Behind a grisly image
A grim and ghastly wrath
A striking portrait hidden
In a cruel and ancient vision
Dark my pride of bravery
Through the eye of Odin I see....
An axe-age,a sword-age.a wind-age,a wolf-age
Before the wrecking of the world
Soared through storm clouds
The force of fate
Weaving the web of war
Nightfall doomfall
Death come forth
Beware the Crimson rain
Precious arts of warfare
Gaining mortal sacrifice
The taste of blood the foaming frenzy
All berserkers rage
Emerging from a bloodred sky
As storming birds of prey
Shrieking Screaming Raging's menace
Catch the blood and await the fallen
My spear spreads fear my sword still kill
A grinding death my will
To be seen to be felt
Who dies first who follows after
My infinite powers like the
Strength of a storming sea
So it is for now and
So shall it forever be
An axe-age,a sword-age.a wind-age,a wolf-age
Before the wrecking of the world
Soared through storm clouds
The force of fate
Weaving the web of war
Nightfall doomfall
Death come forth
Beware the Crimson rain
Sacrifice my life for Odins court
Grant immortality
Rise again to life the heroic dead
Await the horns sound
In days of yore, in truths of tales then told:
(Odin :)
You and every one of you
Who follow me are born into my clan
I mark as my own.
An axe-age,a sword-age.a wind-age,a wolf-age
Before the wrecking of the world
Soared through storm clouds
The force of fate
Weaving the web of war
Nightfall doomfall
Death come forth
Become the Crimson rainForgive me, Father, for I've sinned
I am a child of fire and the master of winds
But I'm still wide awake
Fingers grip out of my brain
No control, my mind is lame
From the earth up to the trees I hear them calling me
The voices which rides on the breeze
Oh, its haunting me, in expectancy for your flesh
But this dream life is the only life,
An everlasting astral dimension
The dream death is the only death,
Total destruction of the soul
Within this astral plane I'll never be the same
Throwing myself at the sky while falling back to the ground
I'm off the earth but no one can hear my painful sound
I open the doors to the other side and step beyond mortality
Trapped in rage, it bursts my veins so feel the pain
I breathe your name
It isn't just a night-scape vision painted in blood
Utopia consumed!
The dark silhouettes move towards me
As I confess the morbid desire
And I witness all the falling souls consumedSo long, leave me memories
I'd rather think of better moments
I've come this far and realized things are never gonna change
Unless you face it, face it
Face and overcome what breaks you
Would you steal my heart and turn it into stone?
Kill my hope and make a mockery?
Watch me form into a person that I always said
I'd always thought I'd never die
I thought I'd never die
Is this worth it?
Don't you live your whole life in questioning?
Don't you live your whole life in suffering
Suffering, suffering, suffering?
You're so cold
Inside my head I could hear your words
Though I'm a skeptic, all my life I've made myself reject it
Now I see something
I'd give my everything just to taste the world
I'd give my everything just to taste the world
This world I see
I'd give my everything just to taste the world
I'd give my everything just to taste the world[instrumental]Oh, the year was 1778,
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
A letter of marque came from the King,
To the scummiest vessel I'd ever seen.
God damn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold,
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears,
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier,
The last of Barrett's Privateers.
Oh, Elcid Barrett cried the town,
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
For twenty brave men all fishermen who,
Would make for him to Antelope's crew.
God damn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold,
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears,
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier,
The last of Barrett's Privateers.
The Antelope sloop was a sickening sight,
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
She'd a list to the port and her sails in rags,
And the cook in scuppers and the staggers and the jags.
God damn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold,
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears,
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier,
The last of Barrett's Privateers.
On the King's birthday we put to sea,
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
We were 91 days to Montego bay,
Pumping like madmen all the way.
God damn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold,
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears,
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier,
The last of Barrett's Privateers.
On the 96th day we sailed again,
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
When a bloody great Yankee hove in sight,
With our cracked four pounders we made to fight.
God damn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold,
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears,
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier,
The last of Barrett's Privateers.
The Yankee lay low down with gold,
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
She was broad and fat and loose in the stays,
But to catch her took the Antelope two whole days.
God damn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold,
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears,
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier,
The last of Barrett's Privateers.
Then at length we stood two cables away,
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
Our cracked four pounders made an awful din,
But with one fat ball the Yank stove us in.
God damn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold,
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears,
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier,
The last of Barrett's Privateers.
The Antelope shook and pitched on her side,
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs,
And the Main trunk carried off both me legs.
God damn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold,
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears,
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier,
The last of Barrett's Privateers.
So here I lay in my 23rd year,
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
It's been 6 years since we sailed away,
And I just made Halifax yesterday.
God damn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold,
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears,
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier,
The last of Barrett's Privateers.With hearts of midnight, brightened by his infernal light
We stand as a monolith of wrath, united under the goath of a thousand young
Two horns thrust upwards in defiance, three inverted as the trinity denied
A phalanx of mourners in black, falling towards nightly terror
Unleash the temted beast, raised your horns in pridefull blasphemy
I'll be your guide into the glourious darrkness, and enchant you like a taste of sin
Unleash the temted beast, chant theron in words of blazing scorn
Grant me my dark desires, strengthened through the power of satan
Take plesure in the torment of the wretched
And rejoice in the delight of the flesh
Behold the face of satan
And walk the fields of erotic fire
Hunt the heavens ...
Godless temted beckon
Through gleaming scapes of horrid nightmare
Gathered between symbols and signs
A glow of new light is born out of the night
Give into your lust and carnal desires - in twisted blood-dripping ecstasy
In the name of satan - i lead you into temptation
(lyrics:Nagash)Carry our streams
Lift up our less than elated lives
Transmit our selves
We breathe out
Where no one whispers
Take in all the dark light
turn the nighttime into day
Cathode ray Sunshine
speak out and we receive
Show me and let us in
Alienate
Block out all
amid the breaking of the light
See it again and again
Single sight
Sensory perception
turn the nighttime into day
To our great distrust
Escapism a means of
getting through alive
Take it in and spit it out again
That measly filth
Focal degradation
Bring the chaos into light
Cathode ray Sunshine
BurnRight!
Let's move, move!
In this life I've known nothing but seeds you've sown
I've walked the highways and I've
Combed the side roads
It's been a joy of highs, oh the pain of lows
I met the Devil at the heart of the crossroads
I share
A soul with a hunting hound
My blood's a red river that flows through every town
No
Have you ever felt like I have
Cry
For me sky
Cry for me, scorned, scorned
Live this life insane, nothing but pouring rain
I'm an outlaw, it's amazing I'm
Sane
Born and dressed in black, my soul is fighting back
Fueling Hell and raising cain, cain, cain
No
Have you ever felt
Like I have?
Cry for me sky
Right
Get the fuck up, get up
When I'm a ghost and gone, I
'll be remembered strong -
By all I've met, by friends and family
When I'm lowered down, six feet in the ground
There won't be a sound except for crows
Wailing
Cry for me sky[Instrumetal]I woke up still dreaming
The air was static
My eyes can't see
My senses turn to automatic
So I dream again
The waves have reached the shore
So I dream again
And wait for something more
No sign, no answer
I'm looking at mountains, but I'm way too close
No sign, no wonder
I'm looking at every way to break the circle
Dance me to the fire dance
Following steps in the sand
Dance me to the fire dance
All hell has come loose, the future is out of my hands
Not what I planned
I'm stolen, I'm broken
I'm changing colors
The veil has gone and so has
Everything that matters
Come and hear the sound
Of silence in the haze
Can you hear the sound
The colors that it makes?
No sound, no images
This must be darkness by another name
No sound, no answer
Some kind of evils come to carry us away
Into the fire dance
Following steps in the sand
Dance me to the fire dance
All hell has come loose, the future is broken
Dance me to the fire dance
Following steps in the sand
Dance me to the fire dance
All hell has come loose, the future is not what I planned
And so I dream again I dream
The waves have reached the shore it seems
And so I dream again I dream
Dance me to the fire dance
Following steps in the sand
Dance me to the fire dance
All hell has come loose
Dance me to the fire dance
Following steps in the sand
Dance me to the fire dance
All hell has come loose
The future has spoken
Words have been brokenI'm depressed
I'm upset
And the rest of the world will pay for it!
Let everyone die!
They all suck!
See if I give a fuck!
This is How I feel
I wish it wasn't so
This is something real
I cannot let it go!
I cannot save the souls of all, so I must let them...
Fall!
I want to be good, yet I'm bad
The state of this pissy world is sad!
This is How I feel
I wish it wasn't so
This is something real
I cannot let it go! (x3)
I must let them...
Fall!InstruSo we're equal but we're not the same
What I look for you'd just throw away
Down with the water to the river to the shore
I cannot take this anymore
All the stolen, all the broken
All the borrowed, all the blue
All my hate I share with you
Another lesson in pain
Little is the space I own
Yet you don't know that you can't have it
Give me more, it can't be more than I can take
See, there were other friends I've made before
Spoken broken
More for show, for blow
Growing, bowing down and low
As I walk alone
Free my heart from stone
Now see this, see it very well
At the bottom line we're even ordinary
Irritated solo-mutants
Nerve-twisted, longing for some sleep
Attention now, cries tragedy
Finally we're more than just free
Take the good, turn it to bad
Leave a message and me alone
As I walk alone
Free my heart from stone
The ashes come from fire
The fire from the boom
The boom I think was when I pushed the button labelled go
As I walk alone (as I walk alone)
Free my heart from stoneHate, fuck, fight, kill
Hate, fuck, fight, kill
Hate, fuck, fight, kill
Hate, fuck, fight, kill
We teach our children how to act in this world
By living what they see on TV
Murder, rape, war, disease
The rules of society
Hate, fuck, fight, kill
Hate, fuck, fight, kill
A race of murderers with no remorse
And no respect for humanity
We wonder why our children kill hate and lie
With no responsibility, oh
Hate, fuck, fight, kill
Hate, fuck, fight, kill
Kill, kill, kill, kill
Hate, fuck, fight, kill
Fuck it up you
Oh, come on
Take it back, yo you better listen
I'm on a mission, I'll tell you what you're missin'
It's time to start living in reality
So fuck the world before the world fucks me
Oh, come on
Take it back, yo you better listen
I'm on a mission, I'll tell you what you're missin'
It's time to start living in reality
So fuck the world before the world fucks me
(Fuck the world for fuckin' me)
We live so many days of our selfish live
Making money by whatever means
For sex, drugs, our sadistic needs
We live and die so selfishly, oh
Hate, fuck, fight, kill
Hate, fuck, fight, kill
(Hate)
Hate, fuck, fight, kill
Hate, fuck, fight, kill
(Kill)
Hate, fuck, fight, kill
(Kill)
Hate, fuck, fight, kill
(Kill)
Hate, fuck, fight, kill
(Kill)
Hate, fuck, fight, killIt could take a second
To tear down years of work
And we won't get these days
Back again (back again)
I can't understand why I've been put here
I'm stuck in a world of sympathy
With nobody watching over me
And the words roll over and over
Yet our hearts will never be lifted
Someone, tell me how I've ended up here
With nobody watching over me?
We need to bring back the days we used to love
Before all the color drains away
I can't understand why I've been put here
I'm stuck in a world of sympathy
With nobody watching over me
I can't understand why I've been put here
I'm stuck in a world of sympathy
With nobody watching over me
To all those not living in the here and now
To all those not living in the here and now
To all those not living in the here and now
To all those (sing it loud)
Where did they go?
The days we used to know
Where did they go?
Have I forgotten what it feels like?
Where did they go, where did they go
The days we used to know
Where did they go, where did they go
Have I forgotten what it feels like?
And the words roll over and over
Yet our hearts will never be liftedFair, what do I know, what can I say
The passion is over and I should have noticed it unfortunately
But it gives me more than I ever needed in this uncertainty
And it gives me more that I ever needed, throw the passion away
Fair, what do I know
Fair, what could I say
Fair, fair and it gives me more than I ever
Feels like I'm losing the biggest, the best part of me
Can't live your life through me vicariously
What I say
Feels like I'm losing the best part of me
Was it always all about me
FairThe Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want
He makes me lie down in green pastures
He leads me beside quiet waters
He restores my soul
He guides me in paths of righteousness
For His name's sake
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil for You are with me
Mercy, grace
God we need Your spirit
Be made new
Restore my soul, hear my voice
You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies
You anoint my head in oil, my cup overflows
Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord foreverYour daddy didn't tell you
You're a joke of the summer night
Yeah, You're the fifth wheel,
Over your corpse no one will cry.
So you are burning, wrath child
You are walkin' a lie
You are talkin' with a knife.
Mother always talked to you
You're a f...in' kid, You're not mine,
You've always had war in your head,
Bombs in your brain, storm in your heart,
So You're a lepper, bad guy
You're walkin' lie
You are talkin' with a knife.
Every cop wants to catch you
Each of them will say: You gotta be mine
You spend your life in hiding-places
I only know, that your dead or alive.
Yes, you've got your own style
You are a walkin' lie
You are...

Baby I got mine
We just can't seem to make ends meet
Don't you realize when jumpin' in the water
You're gonna get wet past knee deep
Give in
Give and take
Taken by mistake
Sooner or later deceit's gonna hit
Lay your cards on the table and draw
From now on
I call the shots
Long before I die
Long before I die
Give in
Give and take
Taken by mistake
From now on
I call the shots
Long before I die
Long before I dieCome down to earth he mentions
Full of his best intentions
It's now time for an occupation
Time to make some money with that
education
Come down to ground
Mortgage bound
So proud
Can't you see these dreams will never
end themselves?
Set me free, I will find the beauty of
this world
Come down to earth he mentions
Full of their blind intention
It.s not time for a inoculation
Time to make some money with your
new foundation[Halloween Cover]
It always seems so easy to tell another lie
Convince myself that you would always give me one more try
You're always there but not this time
I don't know what to do
So many times I wanted to say these words to you
I confess
I've been wrong a million times
If there's any way to make things right
A million times I'd lie
But now that it's over, I confess!
I would have told you long ago
But you always turn away
You swore you'd never say goodbye
But I knew you wouldn't stay
I've asked for second chances
and you were always there
Now you're gone, I stand alone
Drowning in despair
I confess
I've been wrong a million times
Now there is no way to make things right
A million times I've tried
Now it's over
I confess
I've been wrong a million times
If there's anyway to make things right
Believe me I will lie
I confess
Now it's my turn to tell the lies
There's a million ways to pay you back
Believe me I will try
I confessI walk alone
My feelings have grown cold
It's beginning of the end
Leaving this world behind, behind
Big walls surround a world
I build up for myself
My minds perception of the inside
Segregates into my hell
Animation strokes my dreams
Dreams I can't forget
Restless thoughts of self distrust
Are walking through my head
Stone cold, drawn in sweat
Can't sleep late at night
All those things that get me down
And keep me close to my demise
Animation strokes my dreams
Dreams I can't forget
Restless thoughts of self distrust
Are walking through my head
I cry, I cry, cry, cry
Times do change, can't wait, only seeing what
I've done
Lost no found, minds unsound,
From the other side of the line
Leave me, and don't ask, now I
Say goodbye to all my cries and lead myself to
Higher skies, now
Releasing myself into a new dimension
It's coming closer
My soul, it wants to escape, to be released
From my body
To be free, yeah, to be free
My life shield was getting weak
I really didn't see the need
Totally conscious and I couldn't stop myself
Rolling down the hill with speed
Animation strokes my dreams
Dreams I can't forget
Restless thoughts of self distrust
Are walking through my head, through my
Head, head, head, head, dead, headI see myself there waiting by the roadside
Laid claim to nothing but a black bag and the attire I stand in
No name, no history
Just a target on my temple and a hole in my head
I could've been one of kings
The shell of a boy of the man that I used to be
A monkey in a man suit
I stand here as nothing to you
Wind me up and watch me go
Lay down your guns
Cut me from ear to ear
Eye for an eye
The glass is long gone broken
Lay down your guns
Cut me from ear to ear
Eye for an eye
The glass is long gone broken
I walk this road alone
No thanks to you
I walk this road alone
No thanks to you
I walk this road alone
Load up your six-shot baby
Put it to my head
Pull the trigger, blank I'd figured
Put it to me, dead
Lay your guns down let me die (scars)
Load up your six-shot baby
Put it to my head
Pull the trigger, blank I'd figured
Put it to me, dead
Lay your guns down let me die (scars)
Load up your six-shot baby
Put it to my head
Pull the trigger, blank I'd figured
Put it to me, dead
Lay your guns down let me die (scars)
Load up your six-shot baby
Put it to my head
Pull the trigger, blank I'd figured
Put it to me, dead
Lay your guns down let me die (scars)
Why can't you just let me die (don't)
Lay your guns down let me die (heal)
Why can't you just let me die (when)
Lay your guns down let me die (you keep)
Scars don't heal when you keep cutting
Always cutting
Cutting deeper
Always deeper
Scars don't heal when you keep cuttingHe never talked about it yet it remained
and the emotion of it, again betrayed
How could he hold his head high?
He never talked about it again
He said, let yourself be born again
He said, all you were is all you'll be
He couldn't live without it
before the rain
There's not regret about it
While in the fray
He took a spoonful of pain
He didn't think about it, he said
You'll go your own way
First Sunday of September
On this great day[Music: Wolgang Amadeus Mozart ,Arranged by Dragonland]
"Last words of my dear brother...
Seek your origin in the mithril mountain
All answers shall be revealed...
And take care of the ones back home
Before it's too late...
We'll meet again in lands beyond this world
We shall walk the silver fields again..."
[Solo: E.H]Burnt: BURN, BURN i just burn
minds to open things to learn
my dead brain is my concern
so leave me be and let me burn
BURN BURN BURN BURN
that's my fate
let my lungs evaculate
feel no love
feeling hate
feel no urge to contemplate
BURN BURN THAT'S MY FATE
peering thru these eyes of red
feeling high
feeling dead
burn burn
for you and me
all alone and me T.H.C.
burning all my time away
always got to much to say
burning all my time away
save it for another day
BURN BURN THAT'S MY FATEBlood, fallen from heaven
Obscurity, spreading the day
Pestilence, to let the humans die
Death, is a customary illustration
Fire, charges burning down
Putrefaction, all over the world
Burning flesh, the smell lies in the air
Fear, horror in the night
The animals die, the oceans are red
Snowing in summer, the fallen angel
A lifeless child was born
A lifeless child was born
The prophecy, the prophecy
Earthquake, the ground became the lacerated wound
Thunder and lightning, total destruction
Fire, the world is burning
The earth explosion
Earthquake, the ground became the lacerated wound
Thunder and lightning, total destruction
Fire, the world is burning

Why did you care, when you never cared before?
Why'd you care, you never cared.
Why'd you care, you never cared before.
I've become an instrument of your twisted flashbacks.
Still you condemn me for my mistakes.
A curse to your saviors will.
You stare so emotionless, but still I face down.
Your heart dies with every breath of this poison.
Annihilation.
I cannot, I will not, I won't forget.
Now I must stand dor who I am.
And every picture that I see is of you and every time you cry.
Because your past can't run away,
you can't run away from this,
you cannot hide.
You can't hide from this, it won't begin.Prawn cocktail black forest gateau
Eggs and gammon with a bottle of lambrusco
This is opulent luxury
I'm as happy as a pig in shit could be
You keep your cordon bleu and your seedless grapes
You know where you can stick your brown eggs
I just want what every man wants
A nibble on your volauvents and a pint
So just shake, shake, shake like a lettuce leaf
Shake it till the slugs fall off
Just shake, shake, shake like a lettuce leaf
Shake it till the slugs fall off
I like simple things, meaty pies
I like potato chips and I like my sushi deep fried
Never could pronounce houderves
Cannot speak the language of love
I just want what every man wants
A nibble on your volauvents and a pint
So just shake, shake, shake like a lettuce leaf
Shake it till the slugs fall off
So just shake, shake, shake like a lettuce leaf
Shake it till the slugs fall off
So just shake, shake, shake like a lettuce leaf
Shake it till the slugs fall off
So just shake, shake, shake like a lettuce leaf
Shake it till the slugs fall off
So just shake, shake, shake like a lettuce leaf
Shake it till the slugs fall off
So just shake, shake, shake like a lettuce leaf
Shake it till the slugs fall offWe go two, twice all the way round those things
Two high ones, two low ones, yeah
Right man
Man stopped us at corner
He had a bloody nose
And then he opened his denim jacket
It was under his vest made out of tracing paper
Chest scars portrayed Aztec life in his horrible...
...formation really late. Main sequence stars were no good for making carbon in this way. Red giant stars...
...[surplayed].
Disfigured in a lady, tedious
Was over accountant's and on business
Then I woke up and I decided to recommence my diary
Then I read Paula Yates on vision cokeheads
Then I found out we were not going to Italy
Later Mam said 'Those continentals are little monkeys'
And yesterday we has liver and sausage over
And sometimes they say 'Hey Mark you're spoiling all the paintwork'
And sometimes they say 'Your thumbprints are on the paintwork'
Distractors, post-doctors behind come in
Dressed in suits, grow talons
Everyone clenched plaits horror
And sometimes they say...
And sometimes I feel like saying
This is bloody Newark
Or some drive-in slap place
In Breda and in Cologne
With the shirt [on/off]
Sun in vicinity
As if I hadn't done 10 month's service
In the USA
On media guts
[It circles is] where I start
And sometimes they say...
And I think
If I'd wanted to live in Holland
And if I'd wanted to be lived in
I'd have packed up and pissed off
When I was 16
A [Swiss good ass/as/at] this lousy business
Was the last thing I was ever imagining
Hey Mark, why can't I live in England?
[The end of shoes, all warehouse shoe/you've got
Cheap new one, the target is too yahoo
And take over all the desparate
I'll take over discussion and
....humanely regular colours over...
...engineered oxidate zeppelin
Old world style, old man only juke box caught
All power jets on....spectacular facets]
And sometimes they say....
Hey, you're fucking up the paintwork
What is this thing they're so hard-assed about?
I thought I lived in EnglandOh busy, busy bee,
Walking to and fro.
What if we close our eyes?
What if we don't wake up?
Oh busy, busy bee,
Walking to and fro.
What if we close our eyes?
What if we don't wake up?
Oh busy, busy bee,
Walking to and fro.
What if we close our eyes?
What if we don't wake up?I am used to these things you say
I don't care anymore what words come out
I feel inside that I still don't understand
But it doesnt matter now
You had one chance for this
But you screwed up because you're ignorant
I remember
All your lies
Let's look at this
The bright side
Let's try looking at it from another way
That something wasn't worth it
You thought it wasEvery one of us is lost against ourselves,
And pushing through the constant struggle of forward thought
This thing we call humanity
Has brought us down, and has us caught
Is this what I've become? A callous, uncaring soul
That allows the will of flesh to dominate and control
This is my counter attack
Starve the self, and empower the soul
This path I chose, once again made whole
Torn between self and soul
With first step forward
I've become a new creation
Free from self and thinking clearly
My soul chokes the last impurities from my flesh
And I'm given a second chance... but this time
I let myself dieToday I watched the sunset in the East
Turns out it was the sunrise
(And I walked a path as I told a story)
(I watched you through your window)
I watched the sky as the moon was left reflecting on the day
I scared you away, so
If I can't have you I'll just close my eyes
And pretend she is you.. Pretend you are mine
I can see the world through your window
And I sing to you every night from here
Today I prayed my plane would crash
You'd hear the news
And you'd think of me as much as I thought of you
And if you never repeat my words
You said them before, and I remember the sound
I keep the lights off
I know you're right here
No matter what, you can't say no to me in my dreams
Your routine is so divine. I have it memorized
As you walk to your window with your light on inside
I know you'll never find me here
As you admire the view
Do you know how pretty you look with your hair down?
I walk to the window admiring the view
(She cried when she found it.
It's feathers were matted and pressed to its side.
It's wings were no longer able.
Still she begged it to fly.
It's body as frail as paper and wet from her tears.
She knelt in the damp grass praying it to heaven.
Gently pressing its head to her heart.
Its body as frail as paper and wet from her tears.
She knelt in the damp grass praying it to heaven.
Gently pressing its head to her heart.
The sun slips so we dance upon the image nonetheless.
The sun slips so we danced nonetheless)[Instrumental]Drowning in a crowd
Drowning in the sound
An island from within
Silence flooding in
I am silent
I am still
I am silent
Island within
Silent as a shrine
Whirling mists of time
Silent as the snow
Falling snow on snow
I am silent
I am still
I am silent
Island within
Ticker-tape parade
Cities held at bay
Echoes of the show
Fade in the afterglow
I am silent
I am still
I am silent
Island within
I am silent
I am still
I am silent
Island withinin the beginning there was darwin and marx
formulating theories to throw out God
artificial reality free of absolutes
the only sin left is telling the truth
pregnant child-mom smoking crack
spike lee and athletes counterattack
noble fight against the symptoms
of redemption lost
in the want for freedom from all cost
man, you made a lonely world
every human now a walking lie
in his own system of born to live and die
one eye desperate on the great beyond
with incantations to bring the magic wand
to turn the beast back into the prince
to balloon back home to Kansas
to bring back primeval memories gone
but something somewhere's been left undoneHiding behind the thin veil of religious insecurity. Searching for answers where questions have no meaning. Petrified by seclusion, fear of uncertainty, graciously accepting euthanasia.Into the abyss, perpetual and torturous
The gallery of suicide, internal torment
Archaic carcasses, displayed degeneracy
Once within these walls a life of death will be unleashed
Forever dying are the dead, countless bleeding heads
Cadavers splattered red from the self-slicing of necks
Stenching maggot filled bodies, skulls and bones rot away
The slaughtered souls that chose to die, enveloped in death
Darkness is the only light, suicide the way
Hideous forms of human death, mounds of flesh slowly decay
Embrace the horrid nature, carnage on display
Pain never felt
Enslaved inside this massive grave
Life, evil fate
Only slaves to death can survive this place
Die, perdition
Penance in putrid decadence
Dead miscreants
Enter the decrepit necropolis
Lurid interment in the hellish abattoir
Impetuosity and horror, after-life is tortured
Entrails, guts, and blood is this museums decor
Blood, impiety
Chastened are the sanguinary
Purge, radical
They perish, the victims of vagary
Vile tragedy
With great vehemence the hapless died
Kill, suicide
Serrated blades assist in destiny
Death opened the gallery
Sarcophagus
Ecstasy in suffering
Imprecation
Blood, impiety
Chastened are the sanguinary
Purge, radical
They perish, the victims of vagary[Falk:]
Jesus Christ I'm coming - terrestrial home.
I'm allowed to guide their train
To visit you in Rome.
I am sick of preachers telling to be plain
While you got it nice in here.
They'd better feel ashamed.
[Johann Adam von Bicken:]
Oh, ways of gold
Lead is into Your blaze of fame.
Oh, are You waiting
For what we have brought You from hell?
[Gabriel:]
Glory of Rome, glorious home.
Praising the king of the kings.
Glory of Rome, glorious home.
Reaching for haloes and wings.
[Johann Adam von Bicken:]
Heading for the angels, heading for the feast,
Heading for salvation and the ruin of the beast.
Let us fight the outcast, let us brin 'em fire,
Let us lock the center of their wicked, mad desire.
Oh, ways of gold lead us into Your blaze of fame.
Oh, are You waiting
For what we have brought You from hell?
[Gabriel:]
Glory of Rome, glorious home.
Praising the king of the kings.
Glory of Rome, glorious home.
Reaching for haloes and wings.
[Pope Clemens IIX:]
Holding in my hand: Seven parts of a seal
To unlock the land of illumination I feel.
And it's been foretold: after touching the light
We shall lock the world.
But now it's our time to transcend,
The ultimate key in our hand.
[Gabriel:]
Glory of Rome, glorious home.
Praising the king of the kings.
Glory of Rome, glorious home.
Reaching for haloes and wings.[instrumental]Its such an ugly thing
The way you treated me
I should've walked away
Never to look back!
Its all still haunting me
I'm still in disbelief
A broken memory!
Fading into black!
I won't save you
I motherfucking hate you
There's no escaping and you're never gonna fucking see!
You don't know me
Yeah, you don't know me
And you can't control me,
It's rolling in your fucking dream!
I don't know
When I lost it all, when I lost control
I don't know
If I could ever let this,
Ever let this go!
There's nothing you could say
To make me want to change
You should've walked away,
Now you fucking run!
Its all just such a waste
The time you stole from me
And now you're on your knees,
Look into the gun!
I won't save you
I fucking hate you
There's no escaping, and I'm never gonna fucking see!
I don't know you
And I don't want you
You're uncontrollable, and living on a fucking dream!
I don't know
When I lost it all, when I lost control
I don't know
If I could ever let this,
Ever let this go!
I don't know,
If I could ever let this,
Ever let it go!
I don't know (I don't know if I can! I don't know when I lost!)
When I lost it all, when I lost control
I don't know (I'll never let this go! I'll never let it go!)
If I could ever let this,
Ever let this go!Stoj, vechnost' pravda slepaja!

Ja uhozhu...Steam rises through immovable freezing air,
Sun fell down to the horizon yet.
Dark infinite forests captured by winter greyness,
Dark lying down slowly among trees,
Silence rules, silence which precedes the storm, though.
In the centre of the wheel of time
In the very heart of darkness
During the lunar transformation
It spins delicate threads of balance.
Before winter strikes in full force
And wild frosts bury their sharp claws
I will spend this night dancing with flashing shadows of spirits of the
deceased
Then I enter the cold grey-like dawn
And there in the entrails of gloomy foul weather
Where damp place and icy breath bind us
I will set off along paths covered with leaves that turned black,
Along paths which like rivers lead
Into ways running in the direction of return,
Across the ravine in time.Thunder and Lightning are roaring around.
The sky turns black and the night's falling down.
We're looking up to the brightly shining stars.
They're guiding are ways throughout all the wars.
Throughout all the wars!!!
Above foreign lands and above the wide seas
now deep darkness reigns and the daylight it flees.
From East from West and from North to the South
you can see us coming uniting the crowds.
We are uniting the crowds!!!
Here we are together, side by side forever.
All for one like brothers, no one stands alone!
Join our forces, keep the fire burning!
Bound deep in our hearts and bound for victory!!
Thousands of miles we have crossed the lands
to welcome our mates, now to raise up your hands.
There is no fear and there is no doubt.
Our hearts filled with power and glorious pride.
Pride!!!
When aims in your life seem so far away
your inner voice will lead your way.
The dreams that we have are about to come true.
Your brothers will be there.
They are calling for you!!!
Your brothers are calling for you!!!
Here we are together, side by side forever.
All for one like brothers, no one stands alone!
Join our forces, keep the fire burning!
Bound deep in our hearts and bound for victory!!
We are bound for victory!!!
[X4]
We're on our path, there ain't no return.
Life's full of secrets, got our lessons to learn.
Join our forces, keep the fire burning.
Bound deep in our hearts (and) bound for victory!!Flying high on blackened wings
Vengeance in my eyes
Colder than steel instantly real
A new power flows through me
Reaching out for something
Knowing that it's there - Somewhere
All I had was
All I gave
Was it not enough?
You took
You take
Never giving anything back
Bridges that I thought I crossed
Got to cross them all again
These parts that lead to nowhere
Mocked me all my life
Make a change
Break the chain
Make a change
End this game
Vengeance in my eyes
A new power flows in meGlowing segment of the sun
Rising higher in our hearts
Facing our harmless wish
To hold tomorrow every day
Tomorrow dies, tomorrow dies
In our hands, in our sighs
Wishing night will never come
Catching light in every breath
The will to live, the will to take
A step further, to make the way
Tomorrow dies, tomorrow dies
In our hands, in our eyesWhy can't I feel the life that I breathe?
Why am I so consumed?
Despair the face of every strain my thoughts are weak and torn
Reap what you have sewn
The flame that burns my heart is blown
I wear a face that hides my pain amidst my world of anger
How much longer can I remain, behind this mask of the damned
As I walk along this bacchanal of sin
It allows the darkness of my soul to fester within
Reap what you have sewn
My faith in life is gone
This world prepares a feverfeast that feeds the beast
Governed by the wayward souls of forgotten worlds
My world prepares a feverveast that feeds the beast
Spoken by the wayward souls, their forgotten words
I bide my time awaiting one final chance to reflect on the past
Of this disease I call my life
As I walk along this bacchanal of sin
It allows the darkness of my soul to fester within
Reap what you have sewn, my faith in life is gone
This world prepares a feverfeast that feeds the beast
Governed by the wayward souls of forgotten worlds
My world prepares a feverveast that feeds the beast
Spoken by the wayward souls, their forgotten words.So close to the memories of time of my past
breaking the lust<
Those days when we lived in the house of lies
spinning good-byes
We've lost all the passion to live and to survive
ruined inside
The heartache attacks when my heart takes a tax
to be alive
Stay in daylight of clarity
Paint it black for humility
Ambition and fortune brought up my delight
teasing the night
I won't accept all the tears from your eyes
when silence arises
We've lost all the passion to seek and to find
stolen lifelines
You paint all these pictures while we're alive
but black are the stripes
Stay in daylight of clarity
Paint it black for humility
Visual silence is near
Death hardly changes your state
Life has a story to tall
About what it means to be real
Stay in daylight of clarity
Paint it black for humility...Mindless worshipers of punishment
Un-growers and resisters
Close your eyes, sense the below
Torment and separation points ahead
Set ablaze like steel through skin
Fear not the settlement
With those who fear the truth
Fear not the settlement
With those who fear the truth
Leave now, bid farewell with no grief
Their words have no power
The forces will roam and returnThe alarm clock rings, I open my eyes
And watch the yellowed white of my room's ceiling
The dull light of the dawn falls through my window
Raindrops are hitting the ground
The splattering sound promises me a day
Full of depressive thoughts
I torture myself out of bed
It's time to go to work
Live your life in your own way
Free and full of fun
Keep on smiling every day
Think - but never get depressed
Follow the golden rule
Never loose your humor, man
Never forget - N.L.Y.H.
The work today is like everytime
Tiring, boring and grey
Nine hours later I'm at home again
Time to have some food
Now I want to disperse my thoughts
So I switch on the TV
TV-clowns grin like they want to show
How good they have cleaned their teeth
Live your life in your own way
Free and full of fun
Keep on smiling every day
Think - but never get depressed
Follow the golden rule
Never loose your humor, man
Never forget - N.L.Y.H.
But the news
Confirms my thoughts of a sick world
Can't believe
What some men are able to do
Our fate
The future of a billion souls
Lays in
The hands of a few fools
Tired I switch off the TV
Time to go to bed
Tomorrow's day won't bring anything new
But nevertheless I'm glad
I think that I have recognized
The things for what they are
I'm alive and that's all that counts
I learned to laugh in the face of fear
Live your life in your own way
Free and full of fun
Keep on smiling every day
Think - but never get depressed
Follow the golden rule
Never loose your humor, man
Never forget - N.L.Y.H.et sprang skogher ginom ut ir emarker

But I'll thought I'll stay and try to find out
What it was about with those things I did not get so far
As seen yet!
What I found out was sobering but not really surprising
Curtain was rising
Myself performing one supervising his own performance
Not recognizing
Is this one play, is this one song?
What is my part, do I do wrong?
One change was got to come along
I will find out what must be done
See nobody who is around
Walk-on parts are thin on the ground
That is beyond me, it is rough
I faced the truth and that's enoughIf I couldn't see before
I see quite clearly now
This world opens up to me
Wretched and insincere
Further regressing
Into the arms of the delusional
Traditions, religions
Of perpetual mendacity
In deference to
A non-existent God
Souls hesitant and full of fear
A death culture
Dead culture
Sacrament of holy orders
Of infamous artifice
The testament of man
Meeting his monsters
Should we choose to listen
Should we choose to see
Adding clarity and focus
Of what you are
What you want to be
The subtle distinction
Between human and inhuman
And if couldn't see before
I see quite clearly now
I see quite clearly now
Should we choose to listen
Should we choose to seeShe can't handle all the evil things
That life has come to give
Taking everything she loves
Destroying the home where she lives
Death does her no favors
Sparing her and killing everyone else
Leaving her to face the world alone
And leaving her by herself
Wreath of dead roses
Wrapped around her head
Blackened eyes staring
Not at me, but through instead
There's an evil in her smile
That gets me high
What has happened here
She looks like she once could fly
You can see the fear
She looks like she once could fly
Until she dies
Dead
Dead
Dead
Dead
Every time her eyes are open
All she sees is blood and fear
Can only dream of jagged steel
Ripping her from ear to ear
Wishing more and more every day
To be dead and gone and free
Wishing more and more every day
To be a little dead fairy
Wreath of dead roses
Wrapped around her head
Blackened eyes staring
Not at me, but through instead
There's an evil in her smile
That gets me high
What has happened here
She looks like she once could fly
You can see the fear
She looks like she once could fly
Until she dies

DeadNothing is worth than what you now feel
And your sure you can't be healed
Your thoughts they conjure a new way out
To free your life of this self doubt
You are weak yet also strong
But what rational order do your thoughts belong
Can you save yourself this fall
Can conscience over ride yourself to stand tall
One step beyond - this is a place you seek
One step beyond - you cannot see
One step beyond - this fatal lie
One step beyond - would it matter if you die
Separated from the life you desire
Your head is spinning, pain burns like fire
It is almost too much to bare
Losing a grip on what isn't there
As you commence to your final decent
Was giving up the fight always your intent
I pity you because your so small
No courage inside of yourself at all
One step beyond - this is a place you seek
One step beyond - you cannot see
One step beyond - this fatal lie
One step beyond - would it matter if you die

Alone, set in this tomb of my tears
Liar, I know now that the truth was just another lie
It's too late, my heart has broken black
It's over and failure is the only memory that hasn't turned to rust
Sorrow; the only thing that doesn't seem to crumble at the touch
My throat still fucking bleeds each time I call your name
But you will never know how hard I tried
Liar, I know now that the truth was just another lie
It's too late my heart has broken black
It's over and failure is the only memory that hasn't turned to rust
You, you left these arms holding nothingCan everyone please go for a while
I need to breath
I have to face my darkest trial
Killing me from underneath
For too long have I faced my limits
And failed to see
That all I love and call my substance
Has become my worst enemy
Steady is this run-
A run that rewrites the episodes,
Without a trace and a trusting hand for guidance
A pact with tears
Infected though all inner fears
I give up, to face the one and only chance
To go and break down..., go and break down..., go and break down...
Until I am calling
Dare to reach out for truth
If you dare to collapse
Inside lie the circles of these endless turnings
Dare to speak out the truth
While daring a relapse
Inside die the circles of these senseless yearnings
Can anyone please stay for a while
I need a relief
I cannot face another trial
Killing me and the things I believe
Ready for the run-
A run that rewrites the higher modes,
Without a face and a devoting sense for guidance
Effects on me
And flourishes to misery
Again have turned spoken words into silence
I am too tired to see
What you made out of me
I have died to feel
But what it takes is too real
I can't take it
So why not break it
I can't take it
So I wont make it...
I turn my face down, I turn my face down, I turn my face down
Until I am fallingInstrumentalAs I wander through the night
In shelter of the nocturnal sphere
Full moon shines on my pale skin
Surrounded by the Immortal's screams
Virgin of the night
Under your spell I crawl
Craving for liberation
Longing for eternal darkness
Shine on me, star of the damned
And light my path to find my inner self
Beyond the mortal existence
My body - dead, my soul - alive
Voices of the night
They will guide my way
Through this mystic atmosphere
I feel the spirit of immortality
"And he went to the mountain of dead souls
where he could rest and find new strength
where he could die in peace
die in peace apart the world of fools
He raised his head up to the sky
the cold wind caresses his face
and he thought about the time
when freedom ruled this world..."
Oh great beloved mother
They took your grace away
They snatch away your heart
Slowly they drown your life's light
I tried to keep them away from you
I tried to defend your kingdom
I tried to fight against their vanity
But I failed...That this must finish,
Nothing is forever...
She excuses if I sound lasts,
But already I do not love you.
That you are not for my,
And I am not for you...
That this must finish,
Nothing is forever...
I am tired of all that,
And am tired of you...
That this must finish,
I am arranged to everything.
I will say good-bye and will go away,
I do not want anything any more with you.
I will say good-bye and will go away,
I do not want anything with you...
I hope that you understand any cycle it has his end,
Excuse me..
From the first moment I knew it,
This had to end...
Very few things are forever...
It she wanted that this was different,
We can to be an alone friend.
I do not want that you suffer, friend!
I will say good-bye and will go away,
I do not want anything with you...
I hope that you understand any cycle it has his end,
Good-bye!Who was I or was I really there
You didn't seem to know you didn't seem to
Grew tired of being the nameless one
So I did what had to be done
Washed away the filth
From your sins I am clean
The sins never forgiven
Not even in hell you'll walk unseen
I couldn't put faith in me
I couldn't put faith in God
The only faith I found
Was in the knife that spilled my blood
In tears I laughed
As the blade slowly tore my veins
At last I was free
Free from all my pains
Now it's too late
For you to touch my lips with yours
And say you're sorry
'Cause my heart don't beat no more
And all that's left is what you'll bury
Worms now crawl in me
Crawling in my bones
They're the best friends
And they enjoy my company
Six feet under there's a paradise
Within wooden walls my Eden lies
I couldn't put faith in me
I couldn't put faith in God
The only faith I found
Was in the knife that spilled my blood
In tears I laughed
As the blade slowly tore my veins
At last I was free
Free from all my pains
Now it's too late
For you to touch my lips with yours
And say you're sorry
'Cause my heart don't beat no more
And all that's left is what you'll bury
Close those empty eyes
Forgive yourself but never life
Wash away the filth
Here comes the knife
In tears you laugh
As the blade slowly tears your veins
Read the blood
Read the truth within the stains
The shame you feel is turning into grace
And you're greeting death with a smile on your faceDemented anemic minions
Fuelled on crack propaganda
It's allright to love yourself
If you hate yourself
Alle gegen alle
Extract magic
Inflict havoc
Iconize yourself
Become a statue
So easily crushed
Watching the spoon glow
Alle gegen alle
Extract magic
Inflict havocSun`s not rising but stays behind the shore of sky
the autumn is on it`s beaty and winter makes her way
northern wind is blowing the leafs from the trees
and the rain is pressing them on a ground, vanish thee
Surrounding darkness can be touched by a hand
coldness achieves the lands and waters
wolves howl for the rising fullmoon
which reflects light on the lake`s dark surface.
[Chorus]
To the gloomy forest the light will not make a way
the nature is ready for the winter here to stay
mist is near of it`s red crimson colour
mist`s moist makes the nature color...blood
Stormy clouds arrive and stand above the land
the north gets the snowbarricades from them
water drifts deeper and deeper into the ground
everything freezes and the sun vanishes forever.I'll show you reality
Make you feel alive
Just to make you aware
That you had a great life!
It sickens me like shit
To see you so pathetic
Like you know what pain is?
Take a brief look around you
What do you see?
Yeah, just sit back
And watch the show
Cause at some point
You will be the one to bow
Go ahead judge others
Make rules and regulations
That you cant even keep yourselfI have never been content
With ordinary life
The city bores my mind
It drains the essence from my life
Stagnation of my soul
Spirit is next to go
I'll fight to make a change
Or waste away in my defeat
I'll wake up
I'll stand up
The power that I hold
Opens a door for me
My father's countenance
Will pave the way for victory
Passion of my heart
Leads me to the choices that I will make
Passion of my heart
Blinds me to the chains that would hold me back
The ones who have control
Have never looked beyond
Their own conceited lies
They fear the ones who speak the truth
All of their cautious lives
They've never dared to dream
To live beyond the walls
The walls that keep them safe and warm
I will not disappear
I will raise up my voice
This way of life we lead
Will never be the same againI am just an innocent Bastard
What can you expect from me?
My energy is empty
My batteries run low
Life leads into a hopeless situation
Leaves me with a broken motivation
I can't try harder
No one who fights more than me
I don't want to try no more
I don't really want to cry no more
This time I quit
No place for me to fit
I don't want to give no more
I don't really want to live no more
This world is sick
Welcome to the Silent Republic
I know we share this feeling
I know the pain you hide
You're sick of your senseless being
Attracted to suicide
Agonized by the fools who don't care
We will break from the truth of despair
No one tries harder
No one who fights more than us
We don't want to try no more
We don't really want to cry no more
This time we quit
No place for us to fit
We don't want to give no more
We don't really want to live no more
You think we're sick?
We are the silent RepublicWhat did you do
You're guilty
You have to die
We'll find you
Everywhere
Vengeance
Why do you torture me
My mind is in despair
Why do you punish me
For a crime I never committed
Why am I all alone
No one who hears my crying
Why do you want to kill me
For a crime l never committed
Blood, Murder, Vengeance
Now we have you
Now you have to die
[REF]
Lords of the darkness
Phantoms and demons
The devil's temptation
The child will stay innocent
Struggling for life
It's the end of the dark times
Why do you call for me
I'm not the one you look for
Why do you think I'm guilty
Of this crime I never committed
Why is no one at my side
In the hour of my downfall
Why do l have to die
For a crime l never committed
Blood, Murder, Vengeance
Now we have you
Now you have to die
[REF]
Lords of the darkness

Pay, pay, pay, sweet pay!
Meine Muskeln sind Maschinen
Sehnen staehlern, Schweiss wie Oel
Schmutz und Dreck ist wahre Arbeit
Schmerz und Tadel wahrer Lohn.
Join the rhythm of machine
Feel the power while you learn
Join the rhythm of machine
Sweat and pain is all you earn
Ah-aho!
Ah-aho!Never above, never below, always beside
I chose to back off from this open wound,
To sweep this all into the flames
Scream under streetlights 'til the voices take leave, life's beautiful miseries
Never above, never below, always beside
But you can't make amends when no one lends a chance to make up a time to love
But you can't make amends when no one lends
I find myself into situations that bloom, and you were right, I should do something
But maybe I should be the first to know this can't be fixed overnight, but I know, it's getting out of line
Never above, never below, always beside
But you can't make amends when no one lends a chance to make up a time to love
But you can't make amends when no one lends
This is everything that stands between the sky and grave...
This is everything that stands between us, that stands between us, into the darkness take us there
And through these years, I've shown my wear
Though I'm hardened still I'm prepared to fight...
But you can't make amends when no one lends a chance to make up a time for love
But you can't make amends when no one lends
This is everything that stands between the sky and the grave...Shuddering night, empty streets, a cat cries
a barking dog, one little girl
on her way to eternity
In her hand, a plastic bag, one cigarette
To calm down, a sad face
Lost her friend, her hopefulness
Eyes full of tears, but have no fear, no hope
Senseless life, no escape
Only white powder, which could help
Arteries are carving, head is exploding
Thoughts are running, hands are shivring
Nerves go crazy, stomach is vibrating
A gloomy station, one toilet room
Ugly smell, dirty walls
Drunken men, horrible sluts
Hey, little girl go away!
A candle is burning, to cook the stuff
The spoon is filled, with deadly fluid
Syringe is fixed, to shoot inside
In her young flesh
The neal forces one's way
the poison spreads in blood
Runs from body in head
Pain ache let you suffer
Drug creates a horror trip
You see disturbing visions
You go out of your mind
Shuddering night, empty streets, a cat cries
A barking dog, one little girl
On her way, to eternity
On the ground, this little girl, one syringe
Full of smut, cold body
Lost all love, in her world
You wanted, to stop it, forget it
It should be, your last time
You want to do, then to finish
Last temptation ends one life
But who cares? But who cries?Surgeons implementing superior technology
Using advanced lasing as a circumcising technique
Intense mini-lasers used to remove baby boy's foreskins
An electronic mishap ruins the operation
A power surge causes the laser to castrate
The infant boy's penis is now burnt to ash
Excision of the prepuce by amplified light waves
Only weeks old, the child now emasculated
A horrible malpractice nightmare for the parents
Testicles eliminated to stop testosterone production
Androgen manufacture totally obliterated
The infant will begin its life as a girl
Mass doses of effeminate hormones injected
Estrogen forges distant cells into female working parts
Of a little girl
As the child matures, ladylike nature will be enforced
Raised to be so pretty and feminate
Never at all told she was born a boy
Modern surgery changed the sexes
Between the legs, man-made cunnus
The pseudo-girl has grown, refusing conformity to womankind
Although lacking testes, many thoughts prevail
She finds other women so attractive and alluring
A freak in life, lesbianism becomes her role
The womanly shell holds a screaming man within
Alone she sadly strokes a rubber prong strapped around her waist
So envious of men, endowed with actually fleshly rods
Intense mini-lasers used to remove baby boy's foreskins
An electronic mishap ruins the operation
A power surge causes the laser to castrate
Unknowing she came into the world with a geniune shaft and glans
An actual fleshy rodPost-festivities
I'm feeling numb now
From remedies and Prozac
I'm kinda two-tone
I'm feeling numb now
I'm feeling numb
I'm feeling numb now

Stick with kindred

And family

I'm feeling numb)
Everything is broken
because of grist that curtails

The grist that curtails
will make us strong
(Feeling numb)
And you'll be dead
before I'm born
Puh!Travelling this strange and dark dimension
Awakened by the powers of the night
On insanity's path I saw redemption
Now I only see with the moon's eye
Brief is the flame
Burning bright for a moment
And then never to be seen again
All my life I lived in the night
I found comfort out there
All my life I lived in the night
I thought I had nothing to fear
As I gaze into the night
I see two figures sublime
As I gaze into the night
I die a second time
For a moment I stepped into the moonlight
At last... I behold my nemesis
The two cursed figures dissapearing once again
The shadowless vulture... the carcass of no hope
As I gaze into the night
Too late to realise
As I gaze into your eyes
All they told were lies
River cold, if I could be like you, flowing in the dark of the night
Black and lonely you are like my soul immortal
Without meaning, but in the great sea your journey ends
But even then you never dieBullshit is all that I hear
Bullshit, it s loud and clear
Bullshit is all that I m fed
Bullshit, by the nose I m led
Bullshit, verbal diarrhea to me
Bullshit, it flows like the sea
Bullshit is all that they say
Bullshit, 'til the end of the day
Bullshit from the corporate whore
Bullshit, with their marketing lure
Bullshit, like crap on my shoe
Bullshit is what they spew
[Chorus:]
Lies that flow from a deceptive mouth are bullshit to me
I don t fall for your twisted truth, stay away from me
Bullshit, you lie like a rug
Bullshit, so smart and smug
Bullshit from your wife and your kid
Bullshit for nothing you did
Bullshit, it rings in my head
Bullshit won t stop 'til I m dead
Bullshit, you re drying the well
Bullshit, you can go to hell[Lyrical Magick: Proscriptor, Musick: Shaftiel]
They stare towards the heart
They stare at the stone
He'll upend the plate of angles;
She'll upend the plate of angles
V dashes of Mercury
And Asarus Alchemy
Will channel V archangels... V archangels
[Chorus I:]
"In the Sun we remember;
In the planets we forget
We've come unto a hall and Asaru is who we've met"
Huluppu roots are forked
Like veins in a canny hand;
Their leaves have scuttled
In spiraled force
A VI fold nova,
Fleurs de lys...
V cards are placed in the hand of the course.
[Chorus II:]
"O' Abyssia we recall;
In spiraled force, they will fall
Man, staff and the silver gilt key shall take us to
V.I.T.R.I.O.L."

Their Universe...
It's constantly changing,
And every change in force
It's constantly dying.

Rearrange V cards, yet are they lying?
[Repeat Chorus I]
Closing verdant curtains
Closure is the apex;
One curve is the asp,
But the snake is a path in light
These twins are emerging,
Geminis still verging,
Yet Atu still carries the knife.
[Repeat Chorus II]I'm gonna be cruel to you
Cruel like the fire in our wicked eyes
I'm gonna be cruel to you
Cruel like the fire in our wicked eyes
Be my guest in our cruelty
Be my guest in our cruelty
We'll serve you a fly in your eye
Drop into my plasma pool
Let me lead you to a crowded ship of fools[Instrumental]We out in this...P and Game, we'll blow that bitch up
From the world's most infamous, 1st Infantry
(Alchemist, this shit raw like fresh beef playa
We boyz in da hood...wanna see a dead body)
Sittin' in a lowrider, murda on my mind
'Cause I had too many dead homies in my lifetime
That's why I ride wit a nine and dem hollow tips
Lift niggaz like a chrome hydraulic switch
Wit a hood rat in the car that swallow dicks
So good that I got P on that six-four Impala shit
She from Compton just like me
Caramel wit extensions just like Eve
She want to go to a Knicks game, sit next to Spike Lee
Well do the right thing, blow a nigga out his Nikes
She married to The Game, that's wifey
Ask Gotti get them blood stains out your white tee
P in the backseat finger fuckin' her girlfriend
That'll put a golf ball hole in your right cheek
Start trippin' over colors like Ice-T
And you can watch your life slip away through an I.V
We out in Cali, P and Game straight blow that bitch up
We out in New York, P and Game we blow that bitch up
You can't stop us, we gettin' this money its not bangin'
You can't pull that shit this way, we head bangin'
Wit dem glocks and dem oo-ops
Me and my fools shoot, wutchu tryin' do that
I suggest you do not
My chain is hot, what's more hot than that
That's how I murda music, that's why your broads on my back
Got two birds on my shoulders, they all over me
And ready to fuck Game and whoever else roll wit me
My presence is strong, I have a bitch seein' dollar
Signs spots stare at me too long
Have you seein' that white light you come at me wrong
Or any one of my dawgs, I'll be settin' it off
You was raised on beef and live real drama
Don't let the coupes twist you, we lettin' o's off
We out in this...P and Game, we'll blow that bitch up
(P and Game rollin' the Dutch)
P and Game, we'll blow that bitch up, mixed with the A L see
NYC to LA we do our sweep
We out in Compton, P and Game lacin' Chucks
We out in QB, P and Game rollin' a Dutch
Dumpin' ashes out the windshield
Haze got my head spinnin like dem 24 inch wheels
Ridin' to Suga Hill bangin' shook ones
On the westside highway, hand on the steel
If I like your chain then blood spill
'Cause I ain't getta million dollars when I signed my deal
Nigga I'll tie your wife to a chair and blow that bitch up
You better fire proof your crib, I'll blow that shit up
I'm all about this crime shit for real, this rap shit is luck
Try to score points on me, I'll fasten you up
In that smelly proof bag, real real fast
Shoot the deuce under my arm, I'm real real slick
Can't put a tail on me, I drive too fast
Can't put tag on me, I smoke people ass
If you from the westside, nigga throw that shit up
If you bang to eastside, nigga throw that shit up
I ain't tryna be in The Source or Double X L
I'm just tryna fuck Trina 'cause Dre said sex sells
And it was either this or jail
Imagine tryna fit birds in a Honda Accel
And they caught up on the Fed Ex mail
So we stopped doin' business and chirpin' on Nextels
We gangstas
I fold people in half, I tore people ass
But they still want to ride out as long as we see death
I get money, and I don't need your help or friendship
But love, I'ma survive just how I been
I'ma stay alive till the day I die
But right now I'm healthy, niggaz betta get up off my
A bitch is nuttin' we easily fuck it
And we possessed by the cash and these guns we bustin'...Remember the time when forever came hand in hand?
Fighting the summer on a train wreck to make amends
Falling apart, looking forward to find some gorilla glue
Singing songs about fortunes and forgottens, that made me and you
You have stolen my heart, the sad thing is you can take it
But Ill ribbon it up in a box
So dont you forget these San Francisco Dreams, its hard to swallow because it cuts at the seams, light your match and burn all the memories;
And I hope to God that youre safe in his arms, I wont forget that charm, the smile that kept me warm, all the summer nights that got me through
And the night I lost you
So read me your poems, make me jealous of your lines
Twiddle with my thumbs, tell me its alright
I know youre far away and lost, but Im right here at home
Hoping for a sunset to bring you back into my arms
Even though Ive heard that your Romeo is quite the catch
I wont forget those San Francisco Dreams
Dont forget mePedophile priest a preacher of sodomy,
Innocent children giving head to blasphemy,
In the catholic church religions is his role,
To speak the lord's word he had devoted his soul,
Committed to the church and a vow of celibacy,
His holiness burns with sexual tensions and religious lunacy,
He pushes inside, they cry as their anus rips,
From their tender lips his unholy semen drips,
Sodomizing boys within the house of God,
Screaming as they rectally accept his prod,
Withdrawing his bloody penis now hard as a rock,
He takes a page of scripture and with it wipes his cock,
He quotes the Bible to his daily congregation,
His buttocks bleed from the choir boys flagellation,
A molester of innocence, violating with every deed,
So many times among chapel pews he has spent his seed,
Children he baptizes know of his crucifix of skin,
He makes it holy in their mouths as they choke it in.Living up to an image
Easier said then done
Where it took him was nowhere
Always on the run
From the one who was knocking on his door
Take his weight off his back
Won't you take it away
Give up the pride you had
The security you never had
Not for me, but for yourself
Full circle, you turned around
Take this weightDying faulting falling world
Down with future dark turmoil
Non existing chance to live
Unite with darkness and forgive
Man who wants to live again
The earth is dead, now let it rot away
Death finding strength in death
Close your eyes and slowly drift away
Death ours instead away to doom we're led
and all must know the world is dead
Into a place for all who care
To a world without repair
No gloomy minds, no dark abyss
Leaders, Gods, just don't exist
Mother Nature's burning sun
Healthy people lives as one
Slow to live, quick to die
Death is just the tears we cry
Dream, you can dream, but you shall see
Doom for you and doom for me
Reality awakes us and quickly we know
Dreaming won't help us for nothing will...So many years i've been following the path of my damned lord, in each of his wills and toughts
i've raised my sword. Faithful children of the mighty, i am spoken avenger swearing in his
forgiven name, to pull-down our traitors, bloody liars !!! as weak they are, as strong they think
to be... but already dead they are! in my journey through the dark i've learn from the one!!!
The war against losers will arrive finally... those masked behind their "own" darkness will be
crushed without doubt by the burnings from thy throne.
Betrayer you whom infiltrate our hatred fulfilled world, will your own knowledge be strong enough
to face our score, "No one can pretend to be a son of our lord, just by the meaning of a few
humanized words! you belong to him away !!! Burn ! Miserable rats! Burn !!!
[chorus:]
In nomine dei nostri SATANAS, sanctus dominus...
In nomine dei nostri SATANAS, animus vocatur...
In nomine dei nostri SATANAS, christus trepidum...Eja me sentire vim doloris
Fac ut tecum lugeam
J'ai si souvent cherch parmi les artifices
Le regard innocent qui me dirait courage
A traves la souffrance et qui dans les naufrages
Me donnerait la main comme un ancien complice
L'evanescent baiser qui pardonne et comprend
La chair qui le mrite et les yeux qui l'esprent
Et qui subtile arcane hrite de nos pres
Mle au creuset du coeur la foudre avec le sang
Cherchant dans la poussire un avenir l'me
Arrose mon tombeau de fluctuantes larmes
Qui sait ce qui cl't de ces vaines douleurs
Si ce n'est le bonheur de voir jaillir ensemble
Plus ne m`rest rien...
Fais-toi ple ce soir je n'ai plus qu'une envie
Venir crever ce coeur qui n`a fait que trop battre
Sois belle et joue sans fiel mon me est un thtre
O de toi se dverse une ivresse infinie
Mais la fin les fleurs sont toutes un peu les mmes
Une image que l'on pleure parmi les chrysanthmes
Plus ne m'est rien...
Eja me sentire vim doloris
Fac ut tecum lugeamMarching through the woods
Our weapons held high
Here is our meeting tonight
Our fire burns higher then ever before
Out master's awaited with pride
We get immortality
We are eternal
We drink the blood flowing warm from christ
So sweet to taste the liquid might
Our satanic unity is done
Join force Belial
Hypnotic trance
Awaiting the beast
Waiting for the end
Whispering voices telling me
To rape to kill the priest
Floating caused by magic
Never ending hateThe fire in your soul is fading
When our worlds collide
The charming serpent slithers
While an innocent dies
I set a trap of the sneaking temptation
You know I feel forever desire
Cleanse yourself of your sins
I can feel your sinful thoughts
Your looks stain my soul
You are the virgin, you are the whore
Who am I to forgive you?
Turn away from the evil eye
Obey, you're mine
Forever
Get used to the pain now
It's only thing that's real
I've hidden truth behind the mask
Forever bending the truth
I set a trap of the sneaking temptation
You know I feel forever desire
Cleanse yourself of your sins
I can feel your sinful thoughts
Your looks stain my soul
You are the virgin, you are the whore
Who am I to forgive you?
Turn away from the evil eye
Obey, you're mine
Forever
Welcome to the afterglow of my past
The last chapter of the fall of man
Still, deep inside your weak heart
You know I'm the one for you
I set a trap of the sneaking temptation
You know I feel forever desire
Cleanse yourself of your sins
I can feel your sinful thoughts
Your looks stain my soul
You are the virgin, you are the whore
Who am I to forgive you?
Turn away from the evil eye
Obey, you're mine
Forever
Cleanse yourself of your sins
I can feel your sinful thoughts
Your looks stain my soul
You are the virgin, you are the whore
Who am I to forgive you?
Turn away from the evil eye
Obey, you're mine

Dead saints, shallow believers, all fakes the best deceivers no love for the broken hearted just a broken road for the dear and departed.
there must be a better way to draw rest to these withered eyes. Other than a leap from the edge for a cowered in disguise and I'm confused as to why you all look so fucking surprised that id rather cast this body to be washed out with the tides my mind it runs deeper than the darkest of oceans, and these thoughts and feelings should have been locked and never been opened and they say the only thing to fear is fear itself, I believe the only thing to fear is ourselves and after everything is all said and done there can be no remorse no compassion for the monsters we become. for the monsters for the monsters for the monsters we become.Yesterday I felt just dead
I wish I weren't there
Thoughts of failure
That I couldn't make it
Like a thousand times before
Those down shall rise,
Those on the top shall fall to ground
Cause every dog has its day
Yours is gone
I'm not where I should be
I'm not who I should ever be
You're not where we should be
We're not what we see
"WE" are not cause "we" are over
But! Those down shall rise,
Those on the top shall fall to ground
Cause every dog has its day
Yesterday's Gone!ItÃ¢??s a midnight swim, where it is late and the air is all clear.
And I remember that evening, you on the floor,
I was attached to the ceiling.
Look behind, that glass in your mouth, itÃ¢??s what I am due for.
The sun will set tonight on all the lonely dreamers,
Only to rise again so we can start it over.
And you were right when you whispered in my ear and it all became so clear.
ItÃ¢??s gonna be alright, everything will be alright even if the city ignites.
Look behind, that glass in your mouth, itÃ¢??s what I am due for.
The sun will set tonight on all the lonely dreamers,
Only to rise again so we can start it over, start it again
Now to get back to the room where thereÃ¢??s windows as large as the city
The sun will set tonight on all the lonely dreamers,
Only to rise again so we can start it over, start it againWitness a blinding light, Sudden bright light from a blast
Pulsing radiation moving through cracks under skin
Feel the fire in the wind
Deadly kiss of scorching sands
Not a prayer of hope or redemption in your eyes
Hell exploded on this earth to take all that's alive
Standing at the face of death
Terror stealing your last breath
Watch the firestorm incinerate you into ash!
All that you know burns away into dust
So many lives
So many innocent
Burn!
Every particle returns to its natural form
Ashes into ashes blown away just like the dust
Heaven burning with the sky
Hell is not the reason why
Feel the firestorm melting your spirit into glass!
All that you know burns away into dust
So many lives
So many innocent
Burn!
So many lives
So many innocent
All that you know burns away into dust
So many lives
So many innocent
So many lives
So many innocent
So many lives
So many innocent
Burn!Babylon fell
Maybe too soon
I did not notice her value
Until I looked into the storm
Why can't you see
When scrolls are drawn
Who will you die for?
Death angels fly across the threshold
Across these blazing shores
For Satan blight the sky
I am ancient
Blasphemous
Nothing left
Pray for war
Embracing evil
A prophecy of war
Dethrone the lord
The great deceiver carries light
Rapture
Join us
With demon swords collide
Black reign for the ages
Surging forth with might
We begin to slowly formulize
Rage on san redemptions
Now and ever after
Onward final battle
[Lead: Smyth]
And now you'll see
Why I was plotting forever
And as you kneel
Make sure my story gets written
End times forseen
No righteous martyr
My will be done
Empire destroyed!
Death angels scorch and burn the sky
Throughout his rigid vortex
Satan fantasized
Annihilated mist
Of utter nothingness
Pray for war
Just below
I'll break the sacred seal

My heartbeat would so easily reveal me
Who am I what is left is it my mind
That constantly deceives me
I am beginning to doubt me
If what I feel and see is real
It seems as if I exist in different worlds
There is one in darkness
One is loss of time
One of self-doubt and one of hurt
All my pride has left me
My value as a human has been extinguished
My close ones' those who love
Disbelieve me won't believe me
So I got no-one to confide in
And what worse is
I'm beginning to accept this
My body's become my prison
My keepers are what you would call...
Fiction
I am beginning to doubt me
If what I feel and see is real
It seems as if i exist in different worlds
There is one in darkness
One is loss of time
One of self-doubt and one of hurtFear myself and nobody else
Born of innocence - you and me
The struggle to know - who to be
Society's forcing you to be rotten
All morals have been forgotten
Find myself in all this mess
Free myself from all this mess
You're fighting to stay on the good side
There's no one to show you what's good or right
When desperation strikes with all its might
You turn from good Jekyll to evil Hyde
Society's forcing you to be bad
It is the truth it is so sad
It makes the worst come out
I see where it's leading to and I shout
The world says hate yet I still care
Jekyll or Hyde which will I be
Society throws the dice will I be a prisoner or will I be free
Jekyll or Hyde which will be my fate
Society throws the dice will I love or will I hate
Jekyll or hide which will I choose
Society throws the dice will I win or will I lose.Dreameater
It dwells within the darkest nightmares
It feeds on all your deepest fears
Unaware you're dreaming
You can't stop screaming
An unknown presence lingers about you while you slumber
A tentacled embrace awakens you, as if to thunder
Convulsing crying
Feels like you're dying
Dreameater
Convulsing crying
Dreameater
Feels like you're dying
Dreameater
You leave a light on, you think that it's afraid
That creates shadows, within which it still waits
Unaware you're dreaming
You can't stop screaming
Convulsing crying
Feels like you're deadGentlemen and ladies all please lend me your attention
I beg your pardon for my cheek, please join this heathenreel
Strange rules has this dance; suffers from a serious allergy
Reddens and becomes so unkind, when people're
acting just like you
The regal dance's about to start and I am here to tell you
"There's many a slip twixt cup and lip" 'tis something
that could help you
On and on please join the ball, nobody will stop you
The steps they are so simple, look the moon is dancing too
Drink a toast with the wise man, no one will care for you
Let the dances have their go, follow 'till they reach the end
Mind the minstrels they will say you're just another scarecrow
Not a word a single word, not for all the
whole damn world (you say...)
[Chorus:]
Step out of this regality dance
One foot in heaven, one in your grave
Mind this last one, it shall make you fall
A regardful bow
When your every single choice is
Taken by the spin of a penny coin
I came I saw, do not want nothing at all,
do not want to moralise you
Or spitting hateful sentences, just trying to tease
your rudimental pride
"Live and let live" told the wise man, as no one cared for him
From the soil which is now part of..."leaving is so
easier than living" (he says...)
[Chorus:]
Step out of this regality dance
One foot into heaven, one in your grave
Mind this last one, it shall make you fall
A regardful bow
When your every single choice is
Taken by the spin of a penny coin
Bienvenu Mesdames et Messieurs
To the Danse Paien
Please come in and hurry up or
You will miss your turn
[Solos: Jarpen, Aydan]
[Chorus (x2):]
Face the truth are you worthy of this honesty filled - celebration!
Another tune bursting forth from the passion that
glides in my veins - can you feel it?
A speaking portrait's in front of me, do you acknowledge yourself? -
who painted you?For lifetimes pantomime
transformed into a parade of mountains
deliverd from the golden doctrined
allowed to bleed ...
.. bleed to MYTH.[Instrumental]Morrow
The day of dark
In my sorrow I am engulfed
My fear showed
My forever needed spark
Gone is my fear for not having it all
Here now and forever
Yet I'm still hearing her calls
For my wicked needs but I will never answer
Dead now is Satan's daughter
She sucked the marrow out of my life
But still her I was feeding
God's beloved Satan's wife
I was breeding
She's gone down below
But I'm no longer at her side
And I'm drunk with the love
Of the dead who is my brideYour plane is boarding, got to
Cross the ocean all alone
My heart is stone
You need to figure out the
Things that plague you here at home
I'll carry on
Sometimes, it's one thing
And next time, it's nothing
It's more than mistrusting
It ends up just crushing me
Stop with the fighting
I know it's the right thing
I won't let you do this
We have to get through this
So, say something, I'm not holding back
Before the scene we made goes and fades to black
'cause I can't wait while you think this through
We don't have endless time, remember who left who 'cause I
Won't wait, won't wait for you
Your lifeless eyes don't hold the
Same desire anymore
I can't ignore
So long I've wondered, but I
Think now I know
You're not coming home
Sometimes, it's one thing
And next time, it's nothing
It's more than mistrusting
It ends up just crushing me
Stop with the fighting
I know it's the right thing
I won't let you do this
We have to get through this
So, say something, I'm not holding back
Before the scene we made goes and fades to black
'cause I can't wait while you think this through
We don't have endless time, remember who left who
'cause I won't wait, won't wait for you
Put my heart in your hands
Committed my whole life to you
And all you had to say
See you in a few days
But days turn into months
This isn't what you promised me
I've gotta let you go
Or just find another way
(So, say something)
But I can't keep waiting
Can't keep waiting (We have to get through this)
So, say something
I'm not holding back
(I needed time to work it out alone)
So, say something, I'm not holding back
Before the scene we made goes and fades to black
'Cause I can't wait while you think this through
We don't have endless time, remember who left who 'cause I
Won't wait, won't wait for youViolence in my head
Like a thorn that pierced my skin
Spilling strength on the floor where I stand
It surrounds me, controls me
Shows weakness inside me
Surrounds me, controls me
Shows weakness inside me
They've tried to kill me
But they won't succeed
No one
No one
No one can deny
Sadness in my heart
Like a storm that ripped apart
All the fragments of what was happiness
It takes over, and numbs me
Shows the fear inside me
Takes over, and numbs me
Shows the fear inside me
They've tried to kill me
But they won't succeed
No one
No one
No one can deny
No one
No one
No one can deny
Take one
Take one more shot
One more shot at me
Take one
Take one more shot
One more shot at me
And believe
And believe
Takes over and numbs me
Shows the fear inside me
Inside
Inside
Inside my head
No one
No one
No one can deny
No one
No one
No one can deny
No one
No one
No one
No oneKill your father
Kill your friend
Kill your neighbor
When will it end
Join the army, navy
Airforce, marines
Follow the battalion
Suicidal dreams
A vicious circle
Of death, sin and pain
History repeats
Again and again
Walk through the darkness
Everyone's asleep
Daytime's their world
Nighttime's defeat
Just a policeman
A figure well known
Product of society
Where did he go wrong
[Chorus:]
Just kill the dealer
Is this right or wrong
Is there no justice
The man with gun
[Chorus]Through waves
they shift
Below they hide
Corporate killers
Side by side
Process this signal
Final post
Global defiance
No hope for most
Inform of liquid
sliding through air
Tracking this existence
Killer hardware
[Chorus]
As the sun burns out your eyes
A new world will now arise
Out of the ashes new life appears
A final conquest without any tears
Massive violence
The slaughter begins
Future collisions
This nightmare now begins
Lying faces
Bastards are cold
Self annihilation
This feeling's growing old
[Chorus]
This burning sensation
won't last long
Eternal peace you must be strong
Ashes to ashes dust to dust
A metaphor will never trust
Progress reactions
the action [unknown]
Dark disformation
The time crawls near
Through waves
they shift
Below, below they hide
Corporate killers
Side, side by side
[Chorus]
This burning sensation
won't last long
Eternal peace you must be strong
Ashes to ashes Dust to dust
A metaphor will never trust
A metaphor will never trust
A metaphor will never trust
This persecution
This final solution
No, no resolution
This, this persecution
This persecutionDismal grin onto still born lust
like a whisper in a thousand other's rut
slow and underestimated, dismissed touch
the ferocious disgust pilfers the frail one's blood.
I miss this seditious revelation of your suns
the fierce intimation, the abandonment for once
But silence girds what regret should smother
for in the end there lies no end in my hands or any other's.
I wish I felt torment
for knowing casts a shade on suns
expired for all moments
a comfort that itself outdoes
Whatever Nothing I feel with no utterance it reigns,
whatever torment prevails, expires me.
Dismal grin to still-born lust like a whisper in a thousand other's rut
slow and underestimated, dismissed touch
the ferocious disgust pilfers the frail one's blood.
I wish I felt torment
for knowing casts a shade on suns
expired for all moments
a comfort that itself outdoesInstrumental
Melody Theme - Michael Amott
2nd Melody - Christopher AmottMaltreated Land
Kings come and go
They took their sons
Made them to slaves
Bloody history!
Live-stram of a bloody torture
And the whole world watches
Cannibals and self destruction
Brainwashed to serve
Never again a civil war
We must be united
No more hunger, no more pain
Rain will wash it away
If you really want to kill yourself
Why you share it with your best friends
Your reality is so blurred
You're stepping right into hell
Beware the devil in disguise
All your senses are slaves
Can't see the tears and traps
And the wrong way will lead you to nowhere
We gonna start a mediafada
Burning the lies
Don't hurt one another
Some will die
Some satisfied
But please use it the other way!
Fuck the system and fuck you too
Leave this world behind
Nameless I'm nobody's fool
Forget what you've been taught
Go back to the start
Rethink the world order
Together not apart
Live-stram of a bloody torture
And the whole world watches
Cannibals and self destruction
Brainwashed to serve
Never again a civil war
We must be united
No more hunger, no more pain
Rain will wash it away
We all are brothers and we all are one!
If you really want to kill yourself
Why you share it with your best friends
Your reality is so black
You're stepping right into hell!
You can't trust nobody
That's the reason why we fight
In life don't trust somebody
The devil in disguise
All your senses are slaves
Can't see the tears and traps
And the wrong way will lead you to nowhere
We gonna start a mediafada
Burning the lies
Don't hurt one another
Some will die
Some satisfied
But please use it the other way!The quest for Azunda hath drawn near
The young king, the chaos he brings
With iron grip's sword, chants come forth
The child of dark he is
In prophecy, chaos not near
In chaos, prophecies began
This child of dark, hath foreseen
He makes his own destiny
The magic he creates is from his will
The magic of Azunda, he shall receive
Iron grip's sword guides his path
To the place which is no more
The journey to this place is creation
In this creation, he shall be
Living for himself and his destiny
In his path, lies of the prophecies
In his mind he sees another
Who wishes to receive, Azunda
He sees light within in his enemy
And laughs at the prophecy
His will and his word is his sorcery
He is waiting for thee
To put an end to this prophecy
Azunda, give your power to me
The child of dark has found thee
And now must destroy, evil thee
Iron Grip's sword has gone through thee
Now, Azunda is mine for all to see
The king's task has been complete
The chaos has begun for all to seeIt crawled in his mind out of hate a parasite was born from
their fate
Oozing its way into the brain of a symbol they once called god
To rip and to tear shatter and kill awful destruction is now
fulfilled
All their lives they believed the ward
And all their lives they believed in trust
And all their lives they believed in truth
But in death they will see the light
Possessed and squirming insane a nervous blood runs through
his veins
Paying the price destroying the lives of mankind who lives by
the lord
They ripped and they tore shattered and killed and the awful
destruction
Has been fulfilled, has been fulfilled...
Falling dead from the shock a tortured mind has come unlocked
Spilling out the secrets hidden in the mind telling them the
future awaiting all mankind
A journey into visions psychedelic dreams futuristic terror
what eternity will bring
Looking towards the heavens a gloomy evil sun staring at a
legend it is done and god is gone...

I am learning how to live
I'll never be the way you are
I'm gonna climb this now straight to the top
And then we're never gonna stop
Destroy the past
I'll do everything i can
We can not hide our face tonight
In all our shame
This is our hope for tomorrow
It's the only way
You don't impress me
You think you're everything to everyone
But you mean nothing to me now
Keep your mouth shut and swallow your pride
Because we're alone for the same ride
I carry myself all alone
It's not too late
To make a better changeAll these fads
It's shoulder pads
On New Year's Dawn
To my surprise
All the Macca lads stayed at home
Picking antiques
Encloses
Cosy fleck with green bits
Main undercurrent, white spermatoze
My powers
Against them, half-useless
My senses
Alive have party
Was embarrassed but stuck with them
Walked, at shoulder, down the street, ridicule
They couldn't tell Lou Reed from Doug Yule
Suppressed hate romance
It was like being back at school
My powers before them resound
My powers heard language, two-time doom
Win populace, internal defeat
Their mob had a coup d'etat
Realize what they'd always wanted
Knew I was right all along
It wasn't then a Beatles song
Superhero in harlequin kecks
Dim-wit lecture, half read
Cursing black singers ten years dead
Was a clown in victim hat
Was shouldered and spurned
Then my powers did return....Go back go back
To your diseased control room
Don't be, don't be nice about it
Just spit it back
Why don't, ward off
Why don't you be mature about it?
In your gray raincoat
Off ward, ward off the joke
Violent food descends over you
Off ward, ward off the joke
The joke
Five years in a PC camp
Multicolored sweets in bottom of white sweet pack
The realization burns into my back
The joke
Five years in a PC camp
The joke
Violent food descends over you
The joke
The joke
Five years in a PC camp
The joke
Five years in a PC camp
The joke
Five years in a PC campWe are blind to the
worlds within us,
waiting to be born
I cast aside my chains
Fall from reality
A purgatory unleashed
Now burn the face of the earth
Purgatory unleashed
Now burn the face of the earth
The face of all your fears
All your fears unleashed
The face of all your fears
Born of the demon sky
Twisting reality
Sweet nauseating pain
Is death the only release?
Nauseating pain
Is death the only release?
The face of all your fears
All your fears unleashed
The face of all your fears
The face of all your fears
I cast aside my chains
Fall from reality
A suicidal disease
The face of all your fears
Now covered with scars
Humanity exiled
A purgatory unleashed
Now burn the face of the earth
Purgatory unleashed
Now burn the face of the earth
The face of all your fears
All your fears unleashed
The face of all your fearsHold on to that vision
There'll always be some friction in your life
But you gotta keep your head high
And beat the odds with a sigh, my friend
Keep pushin' to the plateau
Find gold at the end of the rainbow, begin
Feel the sweet sensation
Suddenly you've taken charge of your life
No one can surpass
Feeling good, you're on the road at last
Yes, you're made of Armor
And Saints will conquer
And you ask what this thing could be
Just jump on the road and follow me
I knew that one day I would reach you
And show you lives worth living for
Sometimes you'll go through hell first
But at the end you'll be at heaven's door
Do you realize your on the way
To an everlasting day
Don't turn your head on the ones who placed your crown
Or soon you'll find yourself going down!!New page - They say it's a new way
Won't change - Rules are all the same
Control - Freedom is a symbol
New fight - Let's get ready to rumble
I don't want the same shit
Without soul
I don't want the same shit
Under control
I don't want the same shit
Without brain
I don't want the same shit
and feel the same pain
Masses - You can be used without a face
Fuck this - Don't be a member of the race
Real life - You are all alone
Stand up - Nothing counts but your ownWhy trying
Why thinking
Why fighting
They won't see
They won't care
They won't feel
They won't listen to your reasons
Stop dreaming
Stop preaching
Stop actingBleed for my pain
Revenge on treacherous snakes
They will pay
Slicing the flesh
Sculptured wounds my catharsis
I will stain
Into the heart
Needle injects gasoline
Convulsions
The one that they betrayed
Has made them this way
Plagued by the bastards
I will kill you
Killed by my rage
Scream at my face
The grisly scars went unavenged
Until now
Deep in the hole
You are not gagged and scream aloud
But unheard
Choke on your vomit
You watch your hands cut off
Then your legs
The one that you betrayed
Will kill you this way
Scarred by the bastards
I will kill you
Killed by my rage
I must kill you
Into the throat
The scalpel slices
Warm blood sprays out
The gushing entices
Pull out your heart
And let you watch
Shove in your mouth
Then stab your crotch
I watch your agony
I am released
From years of pain
Your death averted
My becoming insane
You are dead
I have killed youMaha Kali, dark mother dance for me
Let the purity of your nakedness awaken me
Yours are the fires of deliverance which shall bring me bliss
Yours is the cruel sword which shall set my spirit free
Devourer of life and death who rule beyond time
In thy name I shall fullfil my destiny divine
Maha Kali, formless one, destroyer of illusion
Your songs forever sung, the tunes of dissolution
Kalika, black tongue of fire, embrace me
Make me one with your power for all eternity
Awaken within me the reflection of your flame
Kiss me with your bloody lips and drive me insane
Jai Kalika! Jai Kali!
Make me one with your power for all eternity
Maha Kali come to me
Smashana Kali, I burn myself for thee
I cut my own throat in obscene ecstasy
I make love to abominations, embrace pain and misery
Until my heart becomes the burning ground and Kali comes to me
O dark mother, hear me calling thee
Mahapralaya, bring to me
Through all illusions I shall see
I shall cremate this world and set my essence free
Jai Kalika! Jai Kali!
Without fear I will dance with death and misery
Maha Kali, come to me
"O Kali, thou art fond of cremation grounds
So I have turned my heart into one, that thou
may dance there unceasingly.
O mother, I have no other fond desire in my
heart. Fire of a funeral pyre is burning there."
[Female voice:]
Jai Maha Kali, Jai Ma Kalika
Jai Maha Kali, Jai Ma Kalika
Kali Mata, namo nama
Kali Mata, namo nama
Jai Kalika! Jai Kali!
At your left hand for endless victory
Maha Kali, come to me
Jai Kalika! Jai Kali!
Mahapralaya will set our spirits free
Maha Kali, come to meCut to pierce and flood, held it back as long as I could.
Coldness spreads within me now.
Crushing in and smashing down.
Crushing in and smashing down.
Grab for myself or endure a living death.
Into the fray with pure commitment.
I must, I will. Despite all odds, despite the obstacles.
Despite all odds, despite the obstacles.
Crushing in and smashing down.
Crushing in and smashing down.Nobody feels guilty
Himself of the crime
The system is perfect
In peace, in wartime
In this game
I tell you, man
You better be
A wolf than a lamb.
Just as guilty as the other one,
Just as silly as another one
Sailin from the ARARAT
Sailing from that place
Came so close to a cateract
Falling from Grace
Get out, get away!
The chain is as strong as it's weakest link
The pride, your pride is the weakest link
Get out, get away!
One day.Below the lid of a vast rounded monument
Trickling of gristly vestiges and whacked hopes
Enhanced by the horrible excess of fetid exhalation
And uterine strangulation by the wreaths
Of the herds astray, arid in despair, blessed
With dilated flakes of fire, slowly wafting down...
Say, what does a maternal heart feel when merely
Vinegar stills your child's thirst?
You'd implore to harbour his torment in your chest...
To make this burden yours, but... Sacrilege!
Who are you, harlot, to interfere with His emerald will
When even your glance should never leave the soil?
There resides the fusion, there is the nucleus
Angel prick and holy semen,
And a woman genuflecting an aroused beast of burden alike
Seduced by the father and seducing the son
There resides the fusion, there is the nucleus
A phallic communion that sanctifies interior wastelands
He that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption
Carnal malefactor, rub your sterile wriggling womb
With a candle in reverential contemplation
And give voluptuous harbour to vile insects
He that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption
The scorpion shall open the book of Salomon for you to see
And the snake slither out of the lips that delivered once
The redeemer of man, born out of shameful maternity...
He that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption
The lactiferous beast subjugated reason to appetite
Praised be human nature, ciborium of shame and waste,
For bathing in decline a redeemer moisty of semen so contemptible
There resides the fusion, there is the nucleus
Angel prick and holy semen
And a woman genuflecting an aroused beast of burden alike
Seduced by the father and seducing the son
There resides the fusion, there is the nucleus
A phallic communion that sanctifies interior wastelands
When a woman is knead by the claws of fowls attracted
By seminal odours no longer hidden by dignity
And purified by their beaks rummaging her swollen vagina
When laments alter into praises despite holy duty and menacing perdition
Seers can say that his birth does death subdue no more
His birth does death subdue not, for my God proceeds of failed humility...

you could hear the churchbells ring hear the laughter
but with hope and glory, lingers memories
in the dark a girl would dance with her shadows
First she lose her father in the burning debris
sorrow took her mother so castly so she was
brought up in a house of strangers
Many years went by so her torment grew a place where children mustn't cry
not a soul to talk too she created her friends through a roomlit view
hand in hand but never shy, the silent few
Locked in a room the walls were closing in
it shocked her system from within so she lies staring at the images insideEnter a stage of bloody dismay
Where beast and man are cast
To be slain
Chants from the mob
Feeds their victims desires
Without fail, the crowd is there
To greet the champions
And their besieged
A test of strength and valor
Spirits of honor and courage
Upon every strike the mob is fed
Sickening, glorious
For no audience in history
Hath welcome death so greatfully
A test of strength and valor
Spirits of honor and courage
Upon every strike the mob is fed
With sickening, glorious bloodshed
Glorious bloodshed!
Power beheld by the slaves
Turn them into warriors
Commanded for engagement
In a realm of carnage
A realm of chaos
Dignified butchery
Relentless
Murder reigningI left alone, my mind was blank.
I needed time to get the memories from my mind.
What did I see, can i believe,
That what I saw last night was real and not just fantasy.
Just what I saw, in my old dreams,
Were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me.
'Cause in my dreams, it's always there,
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair.
The night was black, was no use holding back,
'Cause I had to see, was someone watching me.
In the mist, dark figures move and twist,
Was all this for real, or just some kind of hell.
666 the number of the beast.
Hell and fire was spawned to be released.
Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised,
As they start to cry, hands held to the sky.
In the night, the fires burning bright,
The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done.
666 the number of the beast.
Sacrifice is going on tonight.
This can't go on, I must inform the law.
Can this still be real or just some crazy dream.
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes,
They seem to mesmerize...can't avoid their eyes,
666 the number of the beast.
666 the one for you and me.
I'm coming back, I will return,
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn.
I have the fire, I have the force.
I have the power to make my evil take it's course.Masters in microcosms of instantaneous.

Star, unreachable demiurge, ice, frost and silence.

Burning leaves
Turn to ash before my eyes,
Crushed my dreams long gone.
Burning leaves
Dead branches reach to the sky,
The flame within me is gone.
On the light of the last dying star
Serpents crawl closer
All five branches, cursed from the start
And roots are torn to pieces
Right before my dying breath
I lay my eyes to the sky
As an eagle spreads its wings for the last time
Leaving me, the oak, the grove, to die
Burning leaves
Turn to ash before my eyes,
Crushed my dreams long gone.
Burning leaves
Dead branches reach to the sky,
The flame within me is gone.

I asked an angel if I could fly
Give me wings and I will
I asked an angel if I could fly
How long must I wait?
How long can I care?
Sometimes I wake up empty
And nothing goes my way
I'm holding onto something
It changes every day
Tell me where did all my feelings go?
Ow, yeah
Ow, yeah
They told me secrets I should know
Ignorant and if so
They told me secrets I should know

Thinking big, I was yours
Drowned in the water of your soul

He used to pull her plaits
But he wanted more
The patience is a virtue
So a white dress
Flashed before her eyes
It's like in fairy tales
A whale on the shore
Is breathing harsh smoke
It's like in fairy tales
He came to take
What her naivety had
A stain on the bedclothes
An envelope with a verdict
Do whatever you want he said
It's like in fairy tales
A whale on the shore
Is breathing harsh smoke
It's like in fairy tales
The wind is blowing
Behind the window at night
And the blue whale's body
Is gliding over the cradle
I'm living my life...[instrumental]Fell in love at first sight
I can't explain the feelings
When I first saw you
We were so so happy
A lifetime of love sweet honey child
You will always be mine
But then I played the fool
I never meant to hurt you
Or sleep with all your friends
We reconciled, we found ourselves
Our love was meant to be
Oh baby can't you see
You left me standing in the mud
Crying to myself
A heart so full of pain
But we found our love again
This time forever
True love with bells

ugly thoughts invade your mind
No charity, no dignity,
no sympathy... so I'll be deaf, dumb, and blind today
Nausea is all I feel today
Divorce these crimes from my eyes
Lowered cowls, silent vows,
withered crocus on the ground abound
From your cell are distant bells,
blossom falls like snow and dies in silence
All decays and breaks silence
All decays then dies...
Sadness chimes bitter times
Hardened fools unfair, unkind
Mercy me, mercy you
Say you do have pity for the things we do
Say you do... you do
Save me... no vision today
Save me... no hearing or speaking today
Say you do have pity for the things we do

Hear no evil, see no evil, say no evil.We've crossed the line of dignity, upon us lay a curse
Herald into infinity like gods amongst the worst
The common line we amplify was never to be heard
The dream that we would deify is now forever burned
A menace to the entity
We atone our deadly sins
Walk the road of empathy
And a new world begins
Cross the line, redefine, break away unbent, unafraid
Together we stand in the dark
Seeking the light and what is right, together we cross the line
Our journey will come to an end and then our human cause will be justified.
Justified
Beyond the flow of space and time we stumble upon a door
A crossing bridge to another world we have never seen before
The open road ahead will safely lead us through the storm
We are ascending to a higher form
And a new life is born
See through the cloud of hypocrisy
In sympathy we trust
Fulfill the spoken prophecy
And our cause will be just
Cross the line, redefine, break away unbent, unafraid
Together we stand in the dark
Seeking the light and what is right, together we cross the line
Our journey will come to an end and then our human cause will be
Justified
Take the step you won't regret, look for the sun behind the dark cloud of lies
Turn the key and you will see the answer has been right in front of your eyes
Cross the line, redefine, break away unbent, unafraid
Together we stand in the dark
Seeking the light and what is right together we cross the line
Our journey will come to an end and then we all
Will cross the line, redefine break away unbent unafraid
Together we stand in the dark
Seeking the light and what is right together we cross the line
Our journey will come to an end and then our human cause will be
JustifiedBodies hung in rows on hooks
Holes remain where limbs once were
Heads removed while stumps ooze blood
Putrid stench-filled death locker
Buckets under corpses fill
Blood collected for the orgy
Torso drained and limbs are saved
Along with heads for decorations
[D.C.]
Blood splashed on the ground
Naked zombies gather 'round
Writhing fucking giving head
Blood orgy of the undead
Teeth dislodge in genitals
Zombie-cum fetid and old
Gruesome lust in undead loins
Bloody thrusting rotted groins
Heads on stakes
Candles in the skulls
Shredded flesh
Sprinkled on the floor
Victims fill a purpose on this night
Blood orgies
And cannibalistic sacrificeDesecrating - with possessed burning eyes
hell has risen - the gods of pain
Pull the veins - tear out the rotted soul
take the last breath - snuff out the life
No resurrection
Massacrate the lord of the weak
Buried blessings
Destroy the remains of Christ
In the burnt out chruches
They stand awaiting their doom
Indulge in their blood
Sepulture of hypocrisy
Light of holiness
Forever now extinguished
Edure eternal pain
You foolish ghost of god't was an eve in late summer, autumn was nigh
still a warm sun did colour the sky
The meadows did shine in a strange golden light
and vales did forth the soft haze of night
When through the air a voice did resound
beckoning the shepherd to rise from the ground
THE SHEPHERD:
"What sweet voice does sing in such a woebegone tone?
What maiden does wander the heather alone?"
Bewitched by its tone, he followed her song,
whilst the sun did descend and the shadows grew long
In the dim light of dusk, near the sparkling cascade
on a moss covered stone sat a crying young maid
THE SHEPHERD:
"Why art thou dreary? What happened to thee?
What song didst thou sing so woefully?"
THE MAIDEN:
"Go whither O shepherd! Don't sadden thine heart
Thou canst not help me - not thou who thou art!
An old man who's been born in a cradle of wood
of a tree that at least a hundred years stood,
cut by a boy who at heart was still pure -
might be my redeemer if he knew that he could..."Fucked with a knife
No escape from your fate
Destined to be mine
Every night I wait to see
In the dark, watching
Stalking your every move
I know when you're all alone
All alone
Tied tight to the bed
Legs spread open
Bruised flesh, lacerations
Skin stained with blood
I'm the only one you love
I feel her heart beating
My knife deep inside
Her crotch is bleeding
She liked the way it felt inside her
Fucking her harder, harder
She liked the way it felt inside her
Fucking her harder, harder
Stick it in
Rip the skin
Carve and twist
Torn flesh
From behind
I cut her crotch
In her ass
I stuck my cock

We always searched for deity
Forming legends and twisted beliefs
Paranoia and selfdeceit
Sell your soul to the highest bidder
Fooled by stories of life beyond
Losing grip of reality
You are living in a dream
Beyond good and evil
Is where you find the way
Salvation and saviour
To your miserable lives
Sycophants awaiting judgement day
Watching the skies for the third coming
Live their lives prepare for the event
Let them rot it will never happen
Lost in madness and insecurity
Devour the flesh of your saviour
Drink the blood and slowly fade away
Now you are truly astray
Beyond good and evil
Two sides of the same coin
Enslavement and damnation
Deny man's sickest creation
[Lead: Blomqvist]
[Lead: Sahlgren]
Beyond good and evil
Your spirit will live on
Free from religious slavery
Prosper and grow strong
Beyond good and evilYou are everything
I would you are found in what I do
As the moon passes slowly by
We say our words and then we cry a little bit cause we do belong
The dark seems so bright tonight
Keep me close keep me warm
The stars cast a mellow light
Enough for a rose a rose to be born
Who can say if you remain my dear
Who can tell if you will always care
But you know that I'm around to comfort you
And play the clown so you can laugh
'Cause we do belong
The dark seems so bright tonight
Keep me close
Keep me warm
The stars cast a mellow light
Enough for a rose a rose to be born
Cry your tears of joy
Cry a tear for me
And you and everything we are
The dark seems so bright tonight
Keep me close
Keep me warm
The stars cast a mellow light
Enough for a rose a rose to be bornWhere has the fire of hope gone?
Why has the wisdom been forlorn?
Visionaries write their destiny
And ridicule their true belief
Let sacred angels fall again
Swear truce to doctrines that prevail
We hold the sceptre of your doom
On darkened skies crows still reigns
[Chorus]
Seize the day...Carpe Diem
Seize the day...Carpe Diem
Seize the day...Carpe Diem
Seize the day...Carpe Diem
Deserted wastelands breed damnation's souls
Awakened from a deep complacent sleep
Eager the reanimate a kindred lost
And from their futile sacrilege
They have been redeemed
[Chorus]
Seize the day...Carpe Diem
Seize the day...Carpe Diem
Seize the day...Carpe Diem
Seize the day...Carpe Diem
Where has the fire of hope gone?
Why has the wisdom been forlorn?
Seize the day...
Carpe Diem...Father, with cruel intentions
Doesn't want the newborn
To come into this world
So he takes precautions
That can not bear the light of day
[Chorus]
Crash test foetus
Stomp and kick it around
Crash test foetus
Hits the lights
see how far you can go
Mother sliced open
From neck to cunt
Decimated family
They've become
Last screaming sounds
fill the roomFreezing winds of lands unnamable
Haunts the wastes of my soul
And time has come to join eternity...
To rest my eyes upon the darker shade of colour
This is the end and the beginning
As dimensions warped in time's motionless storms
The long awaited circle is close
And the gates stand open wide before me
Lie down and let your dreams attack
The silence of a soul that is real
Is the silence that you lack
I feel the strength pulsating through me
As I close the gates behind you
Dies ist das Ende deiner Existenz
Wenn sich dein Himmel zu Eis verwandelt
Und ein Hauch von Klte dein Blut erstarren lt,
Werde ich deine Seele zerschmetternI see your eyes
Blue and wide open
Take your time
my divine creature
My arms will provide
undivided attention
Sleep, child sleep
rest your eyes
until the sun comes up
and you'll awake
to light, everyones day
up again
Rest your head
in my lap, honey
The day I wept
is when I had you my love
Sleep, child sleep
rest your eyes
until the sun comes up
and you'll awake
to light everyones day
up againEmptiness surrounding me
Tearing me down, tearing me down
Dark like a black deep space
Voiding my soul, voiding my soul
Calmness raping my mind
Breaking my hope, breaking my hope
Endless fear of pain and tears
Shatters the dreams of reality
Life is a form of million moments
And every moment is closer to a death
Second by second drifting into torments
Time to face the final last breath
Resurrection, no more mortals
Desecrating life, desecrating life
Forces of darkness
Provocating to die, provocating to diePalillo fuera de su lengueta

Obscurity hides the plateau
Stars darken in their place
Nanna's glowing above
Illuminates the silent scenery
[Chorus]
Seven they are Yezidi's call
Aeon of night Eager to Prevail
From the mountains of dawn they cry
The call of the frantic god
From the womb of mother earth they scream
The wage of creation and sin
("The sleeping lord awakes
Tiamat pulls at her chains,
The blind phantom rages
Azag Thoth howls
Vibrations at the black ether's edge
As nocturnal fear penetrates the land
Ecstatical celebrations at their zenith
The seven sharpen their claws...")
Winds emerge from the east
Deep, dark water moves
Even the cold it don eclipses
When they adore the dog-faced beast

As they admit the infernal tide
The eye on the throne derides
The old gods and their tribes
in chaos Tiamat laughs pride..[Warslut/Bullet Eater]

Fear of the Prey as it
Falls to the Jaws of the Beast
Come feel the Rushing of
Senses and Blood as it
courses and allows you to be

Look in my eyes, a killing glance
Love can hurt and that is no secret
But how much pain can I forget?
Everything, everything, you let go
And everything, everything, brings liberation
Everything, everything, we let go
And everything, everything, leads to salvation
The time we split, I felt this anger
You were my blaze but pulled my anchor
Every cloud has a silver lining
And that's blessing in disguise
Everything, everything, you let go
And everything, everything, brings liberation
Everything, everything, we let go
And everything, everything, leads to salvation
Salvation
When I remember the past sad gray days
The cold September, when you said, goodbye
Look in my eyes, a killing glance
But every end is a new beginning
I'm looking forward to rise from the dust
Everything, everything, you let go
And everything, everything, brings liberation
Everything, everything, we let go
And everything, everything, leads to salvationNeunzehntes Kapitel
DER WERKELMANN
Zehn tote Hampelmnner zappeln hin und her,
zehn toten Hampelmnnern fllt das gar nicht schwer.
Zehn tote Hampelmnner zappeln auf und nieder,
zehn tote Hampelmnner tun das immer wieder.
Zehn tote Hampelmnner zappeln ringsherum,
zehn tote Hampelmnner, die sind gar nicht stumm.
Zehn tote Hampelmnner spielen gern Versteck,
zehn tote Hampelmnner tun das auch im Dreck.Tiredness and sleep we expound
As a natural urgency to redeem
From the flesh to dwell 'round
And project experiences in a dream
Climb into the astral tree step by step
Meet all the angels and see your God
Rise along ethereal paths, fly into the web
Filled with symbols, representing your lot
See, hear, ethereal levels
Touch, feel, ethereal levels
See, hear, ethereal levels
Touch, feel, ethereal levels
While you move in a deep trance
Stepping out of your earthly shell
Filled with divinity so immense
You're visiting heaven, while you saw hell
Reach the last chakra at the top of the tree
This divine feeling that seizes your soul
In a deep meditation it could happen to me
In a boundless light, you approach the goal
See, hear, ethereal levels
Touch, feel, ethereal levels
Along ethereal levelsInstrumentalA Travel Of Pleasure,
Uncontainable Desire
He Couldn't Resist,
And She Started To Suck
Climax To The Limit,
Control Starts To Miss
Unconscious Of The Danger
Their Minds Are Flying Away
Responsibility And Pleasure
Two Incompatible Terms
The Car Is Going To Crash
There's No Time To React
A Violent Accident, Cut Off Their Lives
Spared Pieces Of Flesh
Totally Calcinated
Nothing Was Recognizable
But Right After The Autopsy
Everything Was Cleared Up
She Died By Asphyx
And His Dick Was Out Of Place[Instrumental piano]- The Apocryphal Wisdom Of An Allegorical Apocalypse -
The prophet:
Many martyrs have fallen
since I passed that what
The truth:
Many skies have bled.
The prophet:
Many gods did return, many prayers
lost their aim many loves have felt.
The truth:
Many suns were born.
The prophet:
I wonder if the children will forgive ...
When the light dies through infinite darkness
and the children start to cry:
when a scream turns to a whisper
when the ages bleed alive ...
Reality becomes illusion
illusion is reality;
is this an alliance of the ancient
or the new birth of a prophecy?
Unnatural beings, morbid existence
resuscitated horror, ambigious visions
see the apocalypse - rise ...
We were
banned by the fire, in the grip of the ceremony.
We saw
types in our hearts, we denied every life we could give
And
infinity grasped out for slaves, day by day - year for year.
Why
that prophet spoke to the abyss below him:
"Have we ever been free"?
And behind the shade sleeps an apocryphal wisdom
in the hour of twilight
in this legendary times ...
Unnatural beings, morbid existence
resuscitated horror, ambigious visions
see the apocalypse - rise ...
Now that the breath has gone
the fire claims its might;
now that, in this dark millenium
no master is alive.
Now that s castle stands
between the ruins of the past;
now that the omens wither away,
no hope will ever last.
The prophet:
I wonder if the children will forgive ...A virus brought decay to your chromosomes
Disturbed the DNA you lost your self-control
Material energy has brought you this blur
Psychotherapy your last chance to be cured
The mental atmosphere beyond your universe
Is filled with cosmic fear can you break the curse
As you're lying numbed they're entering your mind
As deep as they can come to see what they can find
The spaceship rotates into the outside
A world of emptiness
Camera obscura
Dark... the dark big void
Approaching the land where it's sunset at dawn
To cure is their mission, a challenge too big
Too big for a human being
Countdown
Take off
Free yourself
You've had enough
Fight against
Be strong
This surgery
Will last longSpeak in flames
Infliction the devices
Resting on the shadows false promises
Still
Arousing still
Separating all of that you feel which still
Continues to condemn you for your ways
A thought that wreaks of pain
An act of true emotion
Burn the styrofoam remains
Multiple incisions
A puncturing of the many senses
A lack of truth evolved
Raw defenses
And a portrait of you depth declined
Swine Apprentice
For one example
The flock was raised in the cold
Points of afterbirth, Suffocate from the cold
And I'm pouring out my chest, leaking in the
Freezing cold
Heed the chosen words, produce manifold
I paid my dues
My hands calloused and ashed
Reveal infected wounds and my scabbing scars
Caress my broken back[music: Puolakanaho & EToS]
[lyrics: Puolakanaho & Vetel?inen]
I can recall the sweet symphonies of my lost side
She filled my dreams with the enchanting aura
But the sweet days of delight were buried in dust
On the battle fields of the unholy hordes
Sometimes blood paints all to black...and we can't see all the colours
Sometimes the blood of faith stains our hands...and fills the grail of
unholy
I can feel the warmth of those brightest nights
But the shadows still haunt my heart
Over and over again I can see her dying in my arms
Can I ever gather the shivers of my past?
Sometimes blood paints all to black...and we can't see all the colours
Sometimes the blood of faith stains our hands...and paints the soil of
unholy
Kill...or be killed...
For your roots...and this land...
Live...for the Ancient ones...
Blood of faith...stains my hands
Now my long night is over and the flames witness the new dawn
I'm on the northern throne all alone
Once again I'm here to face my painful past...
Without my queen of the northern star
Sometimes blood paints all to black...and we can't see all the colours
Sometimes the blood of faith stains our hands...and fills the grail of
unholy
Kill...or be killed...
For your roots...and this land...
Live...for the Ancient ones...
Blood of faith...stains my handsEffigy of the impious
Encroach upon my mind
Desolation
Bloodstained altars
Seven temples
And the seventh is for you
Hinnom, Tophet
Imminent annihilation
Children and slaves
No-one will be spared
Cleansing fire
Glowing hands of horrid God
Strips your flesh
Rips apart your soul
You pray for death
As for mercifulness
Screams of agonizing
Cries of pain
Muffled
By sounds of thoph
Prophets appeasing demons
Cutting their bodies
Immolated for Baal-HammonShedding the old skin
Procreating new sin
Incubation and isolation
A new storm is brewing
Ritualist!
Shedding the old skin
Ritualist!
Procreating new sin
Ritualist!
Incubation and isolation
Ritualist!
A new storm is brewing
Away with obstacles to progress
Those deficient in ambition to prosperity
Yearning but what already is gone
The remains digress
And start anew
Ritualist!
Aligned with the continuum
Ritualist!
Expanding the source at hand
Aligned with the continuum
Expanding the source at hand
Altering the past and the present
The future changes the chain of command
Transfusion of new blood
Congregation of the true blood
With no chains attached
We're letting the past rest
And things will never quite be the same
Transfusion of new blood
Mobilization of true blood
What's leaving is already left behind
What's leaving is already left behind
With no chains attached
We're letting the past rest
Things will never quite be the same
When we are in charge of the game
Dispatching the chained ones
While being watched by the eyes of time
Everything is clearer now
The search is on for the next horizon
Ritualist!
Moving forward with silence and rapid pace
Ritualist!
Since the horror dawned upon our immediate race
Ritualist!
The veil has once again been extracted
Ritualist!
From the mist that dimmed our eyes
Ritualist!Waste the endless days
pondering on how to get away
you're a mask, nothing real
just a piece in a spinning wheel
when you're almost there
it steals your thoughts
disturbance surrounds you
then it's gone
in the shades, in the weakest of moments
deep in your doubts full of agony
don't forget that we're fuel for the engine
and you're nothing but a spoke in the wheel
the same awakening
strikes your mind every time
it's a shame, all this suffering
like you thought you had a life
are you closing in?
you forgot one thing
that it's a dead end street
where all the dreamers meet
in the shades, in the weakest of moments
deep in your doubts full of agony
don't forget that we're fuel for the engine
and you're nothing but a spoke in the wheelThe dawn has reached the sky
What does the darkness trying to hide
Shadows overrun the sunlight
Nocturnal violence took it's price
[Solo J.E.]
Diabolic evil minds
They rule atrocious bestial crowds
Ideas seem to fade away
As their presence is shown by howls
The dawn has reached the sky.
Shadows overrun the sunlight.
Confusion - Don't let the shadows rule your life
Existence - Hold up the sun and humanize
Eyes betray their parlous lies
Their purpose should be known by now
[Solo J.E.]
Anxiety for improvements
Crying to neglect their appearance
Forced into seclusion
Secrecy has forced your breakdown
The dawn has reached the sky.
Shadows overrun the sunlight.
In the darkness you fear your life
When the shadows appear into your mind
Your dreams seem to turn into dust
The desire you feel deep insideStrength. Born from pain. Beyond that of my flesh.
Betrayed, robbed and beaten, but not defeated. Through my
search for allies, I have found myself.
Persistance is the answer to regain all that was taken.
Hatred drives me onwards
across to desolation of dying dreams and failure,
to find I am my own salvation. From the experience of injustice, from the
horror that I have witnessed comes the knowledge that freedom must be won.
Strangled by frustration, no longer will I be my
victim. My patience is whaning, now all it takes is one spark to set me off. I have to try to find some peace and hold that
peace inside before it gets to late.
Emancipate my mind. Breathing life into my visions,
forcing them into reality.
From paradise into the inferno, into paradise, into paradise.Leading quiet lives of desperation, we maniacally cling to the unreal.
Life pursues its stranglehold, upon us, its pain revealed.
We, as a race, are frail and weak, crises leave us paralyzed.
We strain to deal with what's thrown at us, we're therefore traumatized.
Really, I speak for no one but me,
And I am losing my grasp.
On that which I must call "myself",
This burden might be my last.
Stranded and sinking into remorse,
The darkest recesses of my mind.
The cavernous tyranny of pain and fear,
Is lunacy far behind?
I have dealt eternally with anguish,
I have learned to live with my distress.
From all this trauma comes profound catharsis,
And a way to cope with my life's bitterness.
Loneliness draped around my neck, in its sinister seduction.
I pray a light will come from this, my frightened introspection.
A lifetime of misery and its brethen, has depleted my reserves.
And this has brought me the true conclusion, *nothing* is what I deserve.
My early involvement in sordid acts,
Has left me scarred for life.
The road I have taken, self-doubt intact,
Denigration is my wife.
Am I a slave to the powers that be?
Have I any inner strength?
Fleeting struggles of humanity,
I pontificate at length.
I have dealt eternally with anguish,
I have learned to live with my distress.
From all this trauma comes profound catharsis,
And a way to cope with my life's bitterness.
As an outcast, I've become inner-dependent, trapped in a world of lies.
But now I must question my own self-worth, that leaves me demoralized.
Possessing fate of mental demons,
Surrounds my soul in these masses of pain.
Voices damning all of my thoughts,
Self-infliction capacities retained.
I'm not the only one in this world,
Who's suffered through emotional discord.
Intensities-caustic and penetrating,
Is it me I've spent all my life hating?
Thinking distorted emotions clouded,
By my personal asceticsm.
In condemnation I've been enshrouded,
Acetylene baptism.
I have dealt eternally with anguish,
I have learned to live with my distress.
From all this trauma comes profound catharsis,
And a way to cope with my life's bitterness.
I've expunged a multitude of, but sad to say,
Not all my doubts and fears.
But I look forward with trepidation,
And step with caution into my remaining years.
I am quite sure that in these words,
There's not much hope that things will ever change.
Maybe my time for suffering's past,
And I can vaguely hope for brighter days.
I have dealt eternally with anguish,
I have learned to live with life's distress.
From all this trauma came profound catharsis,
And a way to cope with my life's bitterness.Pray you never kneel
To the master of the pit
Violently stirring their brew of corruption
Lords of the dark summon certain destruction
Pray you never kneel
To the one who calls you slave
With the hearts and tongues of the gods in their hands
The legions of hell bellow forth their commands
Bow down and kneel
To the master of the pit
Though the powers of chaos are those you abide
You raise your sword to cast him aside
You know there is no escape
When you see your sword in flames
As the hell rains pound the darkening land
Man and sword begin their last standI thought you were alive
You're no use to anyone
The moment you arrive
All the deeds are done
I'm heading for a break
Laughter from the ground
I'm down in deepest freeze
I feel like fever now
When something goes reverse
It makes me want to puke
Before scratching my back
What was I thinking of
I thought I was you
I thought I could spend my life
For a break
From the ground
In deepest freeze
I feel like fever now
I go reverse, I want to puke
I scratch my back
I feel like fever now
I feel like fire now
What time did you see it happen
One face in a purple frame
Your crime is your radiant passion
A border around the name
Thin blue line, red light flashing
The silent rules of a lonesome game
I had to get away
I checked it more than once
I thought you were alive
You're no use to anyone
The moment you arrive
All the deeds are done
I'm heading for a break
Laughter from the ground
I'm down in deepest freeze
I feel like fever nowThe son ov morn
What made me so divine?
I, transcending ecstasy through ecstasy
I who am eternally defined by my Will
Behold I am the spawn ov downcast Ariman
Awakened, yet am no longer human
Kindle me to Thy rapture
As I descend into Sheol
Hiva! hear my call!
Transform my flesh into flame
Hiya! hear my cry!
Sustain my being in million-fold forms
Our creed: the living flesh
Our law: trespass all the laws
Since NUIT is our refuge
And HADIT becomes our light
All stirs within
Tis chaos in and above me
In the world ov nether-nether
"I" infinite space is all-consuming
Behold! I am unending!
The consciousness ov "I" shines universally
Unbound by wretched dogma
I spew my will forth!
Hell is democracy!
All things exist in me
I believe in naught save myself
My sermon steadfast and proud:
There is nothing but god in me!
All things stir in me
With joy and suffering
My sermon steadfast and proud:
There is nothing but god in me!Back against the wall, now!"
"Well, I don't need to stand for any of this shit!"
Cancel the time
Stop the disturbance,
Turn out the lights,
I don't want to see.
Shut down the mind
End all its functions
Destroy all the rules
Block all emotions.
Stop interference,
Just be cold.
Leave me alone -
I don't want it.
Find someone else, to be your slave
It's too late.
"Well, I don't need to stand for any of this shit"
"Hands against the wall now!"
The damage is done. [Repeat; x 9]
Throw out your thoughts
Start again.
Malicious redemption - the options are few.
Blow up the world
And start again.
Move through the night with caution.
The damage is done ......
The damage is done. [Repeat: x 9]We have roamed the plains a million years
Gathered at the shore
When we had run out off all fears
We have come from everywhere
Crumbling worlds behind
Reason is what we're gonna give
To be given peace of mind
Crimson is the pavement
Blood is dripping from our dreams
To the sound of smashing yesterdays
We dance in ecstasy
Oh craving devour me, take me away
Oh to infinity, take me away
Take me away
Oh yeah take me away
Far away
Don't you turn your face to the night sky
Said the fainthearted one
You may see through the charades
An instant that won't come undone
I can feel the ease of my pain
Decline of the blood reason level
Gazing in awe bystanders scream
Mentally critical fettle
We're sailing on gentle waves
We read the sky
Stargazers, stargazers
Behold the key
Stargazers, stargazers
Infinity
Reason left behind
Where are you detecting the wrongs
Spirit that always denies
I've gone insane
Release me from waiting
For the sparkle to rise
I can see they're nailed to the cross
Cannot live till they're gone
Immortal they cry on terrestrial embers
While they laugh at the clown
You feel a chill as if time stood still
There's no way out
Stargazers, stargazers
Behold the key
Stargazers, stargazers
For a lucid dream
You'll leave the world behind
Oh craving devour me
Release me, please, take me away
To infinity, oh take me away
Craving devour me
Take me, take me away
Stargazers, stargazers
Behold the key
Stargazers, stargazers
Infinity, reason left behind
When the sun rose to wake another day
they were gone, gone without a trace
Babylon, craving in lucidity
Babylon, the fire will remain
And the sun razes from their memory
What the dark had cyphered in the sky
And the flame's burning their lucidity
Babylon, rise up to the night
Oh, let us wander
let us wander between the worlds
We override their principles
Abrogate horizons
Abandon mental gravity
Oh, we overrule the eye
Compromise your sanity
To heaven
To hellThere ain't no way I'm gonna wait for Saturday night
I've worked all day, I've slaved away
I gotta set it right
Gonna hit the streets, cruise around
Gotta find some action
Ain't gonna stop until I drop
Or get some satisfaction
(chorus)
Gonna tear it, gonna tear it loose
Gonna shout it from the roof
Blast my way into the night
I'm gonna live my dream
Shout and scream!
Ear it loose
Tear it loose
Tear it loose
Tear it loose
Tear it loose
Tear it loose
Tear it loose
Tear it loose
I've been brutalized, computerized
Punched in and punched out
Now here comes the night and it just ain't right
To be shut in or shut out
So I'm breaking down the barricades
Gonna slow the hands of time
Cause to waste away the rest of the day
Is such a fucking crime
(repeat chorus)
I'll keep grabbin' hold of all the gold
In this old world of trash
Long as there's a light breakin' through the night
I'm never gonna crash
And if I'm down and out one day
I won't throw in the deuce
I'll just kick it out, thrash about
'till I tear it looseWe've been blind pretending we can see
Been as dazed as dazed can be
We'd turn up to the light to see what the darkness looks like
Let's share this vigil
I would sing you a lullaby
If I wanted you to fall asleep
I would tell the truth
If I wanted you to fall from grace
I would make you murder me
If I wanted you to fall apartA rollercoaster ride to a (cold) place of death
The utmost self-searching journey
And I can feel it in the air
Everything is turned upside down and inside out
The chaotic, strangled inner glow
From dead, empty lifeless eyes
Snot, tears and fucking misery
Dodens kolde satans guf's
C jennom marg og bein. Feber I en dypf'ryst s jel
Fra fleinsoppens og helvetes k jetting - lenker
"et langt skritt til himmelen
et lite steg fra helvete"
My darkest thoughts haunt me
(and) I am trying to hide
but I don't know how
twisting like a fucking worm
I see the soul in your eyes
I see through you...
Distrubing flashbacks
A rusty machine in a mechanical voidI feel the world fall from the inside
It's coming down
My beating pulse crawls to a strange height
Please calm it down
I need a strong pull from your little lies
Or I'm going down
'Cause I built it all up from the inside
And you burned it down
'Cause when you took your love away
You let go
I feel the world fall from the inside
It's coming down
Although I miss you I'll never say I do
Bleed like the rain that's falling
Cut me through and through
I'd seen it all hiding in plain sight
And I held it down
But I'll give you all that you deserve tonight
'Cause you earned it when you burned me down
'Cause when you took your love away
You let go
I feel the world fall from the inside
It's coming down
Although I miss you I would never ever say I do
Bleed like the rain
Like the rain that falls upon my skin
Then you just gave our love away
You just let go
Then you just gave our love away
You just let go (You just let go, you just let go)
Bleed like the rain that falls upon my skin (Bleed like the rain that falls upon my skin)
[Solo]Written by Sting
No time for the complexities of conversation
No time smiles, no time for knowing
No time for the intricacies of explanation
No time for sharing, even less for showing
If I could
I'd slow the whole world down
I'd bring it to it's knees
I'd stop it spinning round
But as it is
I'm climbing up an endless wall
No time at all
No time this time
No time at all
No time this time
No time for a quick kiss at the railway station
No time for a suitcase, sandwich and a morning paper
Only time for time tables, calls and transportation
No time to think no time to dare
If I could
I'd slow the whole world down
I'd bring it to it's knees
I'd stop it spinning round
But as it is
I'm climbing up an endless wall
No time at all
No time this time
No time at all
No time this time
If I could
I'd slow the whole world down
I'd bring it to it's knees
I'd stop it spinning round
But as it is
I'm climbing up an endless wall
No time at all
No time this time
No time at all
No time this time
No time at all
No time this time
No time at all
No time this time
No time at all
No time at all...I blame you for how I am
Or else I wouldn't understand
All I know is survival all is hell
Bottom of the hole through which I fell
Answer the question to end them all
Why did the doctor make this house call
Every day sun sets no sunrise
Lines of rage around my eyes
I can't stand up I only fall
I am here but I am uncalled
I can't stand up I only fall
I am here but I am uncalled
Got something to say then tell me
I am all ears
Got a word of reassurance let me know
I am all fears
Got a little comfort what is it
I am all tears
Got the parking brake in your hand then pull it
I am all years
Tumors bursting on my back
My rainbow's seven shades of black
I'll steal back what I own
Fall further down this hole
I can't stand up I only fall
I am here but I am uncalled
I can't stand up I only fall
I am here but I am uncalled
ForEmpty feelings inside
feelings I cannot hide
Can't bare it anymore
Tell me what it's good for
Blamed for something I didn't do
Blame it on me but I can't help you
Pathetic lying fuck
Empty feelings inside
feelings I cannot hide
Can't bare it anymore
Tell me what it's good for
Blamed for something I didn't do
Blame it on me but I can't help you
Pathetic lying fuck (come on) (no more)
And how can I make this come to an end
I can see only one way, my way
I'm not finished with you
Since you started with me
My bitterness will be your end
And now, you will, loose again
Blood drained illusions
When it comes to seeing you
Sudden dark emotions
One day I am completely breaking through
Pretend you do not hear me
But I have one more thing to say
My bitterness will be your end
Now you will lose again
Empty feelings inside
feelings I cannot hide
Can't bare it anymore
Tell me what it's good for (come on)(no more)
And how can I make this come to an end
I can see only one way, my way
I'm not finished with you
Since you started with me
But I have, one more, thing to, say
Now you will lose again
Fuck youKomm zu mir -

Deine Haut, so blutig rot
Schenk sie mir - an einem Stck...
Ihr Geschmack, so reif und zart

La seinen Schlag verstummen
Schtte aus dein Blut
Kotz' dir die Seele raus
La das Leben aus dir flieen
Ich nehm' es in mir auf
Mein Dank wird dir gebhren
Ein neues Leben schenk' ich dir
Ich werde dich belohnen
Gebe dir Unsterblichkeit

Du wirst der erste sein
Und alle werden - folgen...
Mein Reich komme

Wie habt ihr mich herbeigesehnt...
Seid Anbeginn der Zeit
Nun endlich bin ich ganz bei euch
Fr alle Ewigkeit
Mein Reich entsteht aus eurer Welt
Auf den Ruinen aller Seelen
Ich nehme euch die Farben fort -
Und schenke Finsternis dafr...On wings of tomorrow we're coming to fly
Erasing the sorrow and this is the place where you die
We're shaking the chains off the world of today
We're coming to get you no matter what you're gonna say
This is the time of the ending
It's the dawn of a new world order
This is a new beginning
Where a new world shall arise, we scream
On the wings of yesterday you're gonna die
And you know it's gonna be - we're screaming
This is illumination - we are
We are illuminates - beware
This is illumination - we are
We are illuminates
We live inside society, our presence is unknown
We plot and we manipulate you to which way to go
Illumination comes across the world to bring an end
Intimidating silent force that puts us in command
This is the dawn of the ending
It's the time of a new world order
This is a new beginning
Where a new world shall arise, we scream
On the wings of yesterday you're gonna die
And we know it's gonna be - forever
This is illumination - We are
We are illuminates - Beware
This is illumination - We are
We are illuminates
In the darkness, we shall await
Prepare for changes, to seal your fate
This is illumination - We are
We are illuminates - Beware
This is illumination - We are
We are illuminatesYou killed my fuckin' brotha
Payback muthafucka
1 - 8 - 7 nigga
Watch me pull this fuckin' trigga
Revenge
Drive-byGood Samaritans are something I can't stand
Suppressing their own needs to lend a helping hand
Looking out for number one is my only creed
Self-preservation runs deep in my breed
I, me, mine suits me just fine
I won't even give you the time
Go out and buy your own watch
I ask nothing of you but leave me be
Me, myself and I - Only these three apply
Me, myself and I - On these three I rely
Me, myself and I - My only true ally
Me myself and I - I'm greed personified
Thinking of myself is all I ever do
Not a single thought will I waste on you
My only concerns are things pertaining to me
Don't bother trying to find any generosity
I, me, mine suits me just fine
I won't even give you the time
Go out and buy your own watch
I ask nothing of you but leave me be
No charity, no one rides for free
No solicitors, can't you fuckin' read?
Take your social clauses and your empty pleas
Me, myself and I is the only thing for meBreaking out this stifled room
A jail cell, a stell tomb
To see the light
My mere existence
God's kill in sight
Confined in madness
Jurors hate criminal minds
They're making dates for killing time
Breaking out this stifled room
A jail cell, a stell tomb
One has to fight
For dissension
God's kill in sight
Confined in madness
Wasted life, tasted
Wasted life, tasted
Kill me!
Kill me!
Kill me!

Wasted life, tasted
Wasted life, tasted
One has to fight
For dissension

dari mimpi burukku
selama ini ku hanya terperangkap
dalam medan magnetmu
baru kusadari
kau seperti parasit
minta ini itu
kau minta padaku dengan semaumu
cukup sudah ku kini mulai gerah
ku perlu oksigen
untuk aku bernafas
tanpamu
reff:
pergi kau ke ujung dunia
dehidrasi di gurun sahara
hilang di segitiga bermuda
pergi kau ke luar angkasa
hipotermia di kutub utara
hilang di samudra antartika
dan jangan kembali
parasit parasit parasit (parasit)
kau memang parasit
parasit parasit parasit parasit
mulanya malu-malu
lalu jadi benalu
minta ini itu
kau minta padaku dengan semaumu
cukup sudah
ku mulai naik darah
ku seperti bom atom
yang siap meledak karenamu
repeat reff
parasit parasit parasit
kau memang parasit
minta dibayarin
minta ditraktirin
minta dianggarin
minta dijemputin
minta ditelponin
minta di sms-in
minta dibeliin
dasar kau parasit ah...We're just the braces amidst
These selfish trials and fits
Not so safe or scared or dumb is the rest
Our unravelling has just
Enough of it here to be
Drown propped up and watching
You stare at us pull you down
You read the news
You take the vows
You blame the costs
We play the chords
Now the only course
That traces an end
To the violence
Has left us without any
Chance to stand our ground
... Stand up and ...
March
Get back in line and
Fight
The time to start is
Now
Don't let yourself play the
Fool
There's no way out
Placatingly wound we search
Without purpose the game ends
Promise me today
So tomorrow's a new surprise
All these sores lingering
Shutdown and loving it
The greedy hands will lie
But we stand ready to strike
Yours' is the blood
Theirs' the first
The speed the greed
The machines and the paper dolls
We didn't want this
We didn't need this
We couldn't see it coming
But we're to blame for it
... Stand up and ...
March
Get back in line and
Fight
The time to start is
Now
Don't let yourself play the
Fool
There's no way out
Watch us coming
While you drop away
Bow your fucking heads
And pray for us
Cause it's my time
And it's our side
You can't stop us any longer
Bow your head
Pray for us
It's our time
It's our sideLa noche extiende sus alas y arropa cielos con macabre opacidad
El triste eco del Kaddish se escucha desde la torre de Babel
Extranos seres nocturnes vengan a la raza elegida
El exodo cibernetico, la promoesa no cumplida
Todo en el nombre de dios
La justicia reside en los ojos del portador
Hombres entre dioses nucleares aprenden a ser bestias
Tormentas de acido no impediran la diplomacia asesina
El acreedor cobra sus deudas, la oscuridad refuerza la realidad
Revelaciones de terror: Profeta o Charlatan?
Todo en el nombre de dios
Llora Palestina- todo en el nombre
Todo en el nombre de diosForgotten tomb hill
Unnamed graves
No light can reach there
Memories fade away
Only frozen soil
And eternal wind
Remember the sacrifice
Of those who are now buried in time
A Dauntless heart
A Righteous mind
No sign of fear
Cast aside
Left to die
Just one frozen tear
Unsung heroes
Forgotten valour
Unknown soldiers
Entombed in time
Only shadows grow
Where the forsaken lie
Hope buried in snow
A thousand scars
Regret none
But only the dead ones
Have seen the end of war"The old appeals to racial, sexual,
And religious chauvinism,
And to rabid nationalist fervor are beginning not to work.
A new consciousness is developing which sees the Earth as a single organism,
And recognizes that an organism at war with itself is doomed.
We are one planet."Even if I act sometimes
Like a split personality
I am obsessed by you
Like a polypeptide of someone else's mind
But I know I'd better sleep
Sleep into a land where I find
The stairway to my personal void
My possession
Enthused a sudden voice
In a vain attempt
I leave you with this thought
Nothing isn't anything but it's
Tasteless and it's flat
Nothing if it's anything it is
Even less than that
I look around while something is in my head
Like a ton of lard
Like a death at a birthday party
I've got to spoil the fun
Nothing isn't anything but it's
Tasteless and it's flat
Nothing if it's anything it is
Even less than that
I don't want to bleed in vain
In a painful freeze
With a heart disease called love
By the frozen treesWhen we play our charade
We were like children posing
Playing at games, acting at names
Guessing the parts we play
Oh, what a hit we made
We came on next to closing
Best on the bill, lovers until
Love left the masquerade
Sad little serenade
Song of my heart's composing
I hear it still, I always will
Best on the bill, charadeYou'll hear me screaming your name
I am the angel of decay to seize you
There'll be no thoughts to maintain
I'm the seduction of decay
Time contaminating space to reinfect and agonize anything around
We are metabolite of dreams the chosen ones to sacrifice the wasteland-bound
Oh, Euphoria is looming in the darkness
Coincedence of opposites we are
Once beautiful intentions
Scientist II: Oh, we'll drag you over
Oh, it's gonna drag you over
Aaron: Oh, from the start we run away
And don't seem to care what for
Forever feels just like a blink after passing by
Just foScientist II: It ain't the far cry that it seemed In just a wink we'd come for you
You may not feel it
We are the light, the scorching heat
We are the untold chosen few
And now we've come for you
We'll fit you like a velvet glove that's gonna choke their minds
Affiliate yourself with what you can't defy
Some below and few above
We're gonna numb their minds
Scientist II: Riot on the edge
Aaron: On the brink of insanity
Scientist II: Riot on the edge
You'll hear me screaming your name
I am the angel of decay to seize you
There'll be no thoughts to maintain
I'm the seduction of decay
Aaron: I hear their tales reverberate
From shrouds of myth that only time would weave
Bred in a den of lunacy
Who can we trust? Who's next in line?
The sacred drive to rationalize
Commit ourselves another day to the lesser crime
Scientist II: Choke on your own pace with candour
Aaron: So pleasant in the quiet Vicegerents of the tide Scientist II: Riot on the edge
Aaron: On the brink of insanity
Scientist II: Riot on the edge ols don't know the prime's another state of decay Scientist II: Riot on the edge
Aaron: On the brink of insanity
Scientist II: Riot on the edge
You'll hear me screaming your name
I am the angel of decay to seize you
There'll be no thoughts to maintain
I'm the seduction of decayHow could you be content
To drift through life never questioning
Sticking your head in the sand
Whenever you see something you dont like
If you cant see it then its not there right
Age wont make me apathetic
Old ways for old people, new ways for new
This is our way to kill old people
Age wont break meLike a song I hope to sing
I sing it for you
Like the words I have to bring
I bring it for you
And in leather, lace, and chains
We stake our claim
Revolution once again
No I won't
I won't wear it on my sleeve
I can see through this expression
And you know I don't believe
Too old to be told
Exactly who are you
Tonight
Tomorrow's
To late
And we love to wear a badge, a uniform
And we love to fly a flag
But I won't, let others live in Hell
As we divide against each other
And we fight amongst ourselves
Too set in out ways to try to rearrange
Too right to be wrong
In this rebel song
Let the bells ring out
Let the bells ring out
Is there nothing left?
Is there, is there nothing?
Is there nothing left?
Is honesty what you want?
A generation without name
Ripped and torn
Nothing to lose, nothing to gain
Nothing at all
And if you can't help yourself
Well take a look around you
When others need your time
You say it's time to go, it's your time
Angry words won't stop the fight
Two wrongs won't make it right
A new heart is what I need
Oh God, make it bleed
Is there nothing left?Soon his eyes stare up on you
The sun Lucifer
The seal of Sin
Upon your chest, protect you
In the sky the morning star soars
Way up high remind us all
The years to come all love will die
Before the sun, a star sends its light
Set your ritual... right
Streams of torment
Streams of blood
Fear for your doul, your spirit
Remember me gaze at the sun
Light your fire let them remember
Forgetful they are
Still they are gods
In the sky
Way up high where I roam
All love will die
Let the ghosts gather
Wandering endlessly
All of them old and new
Let them all gather
All hell your ritual seam to attractIf I could know the way this ends
I'd then understand
I'll live What it is to be made from the best of you
Let my hands make movement for hearts of the tested few
If I could know the way (?)
The way this ends
I'd then understand
(wa-oh wa-ah-oh)
If I could know the way
(wa-oh wa-ah-oh)
I'd see the glory in these hands
I'm placing stone upon stone
But this castle is falling faster than my hands
They gained the west wall
Fall back to the stables
Prepare for the last stand
I end here you start now
Like iron sharpens iron
I will make you better
You will make me my best
Like sea salt to my skin (to my skin)
Without you I am but a tasteless man
If I could know the way (?)
The way this ends
I'd then understand
(wa-oh wa-ah-oh)
If I could know the way
(wa-oh wa-ah-oh)
I'd see the glory in these hands
This is end this is end
This armor weighs but I will fight till I face the sky
If I could know the way
(wa-oh wa-ah-oh)
If I could know the way (?)
The way this ends
I'd then understand
(wa-oh wa-ah-oh)
If I could know the way
(wa-oh wa-ah-oh)
I'd see the glory in thisalmost sadness - feeling more or less ashamed, nothing more than space in your time between love and refined, and it has taken you so very long, how can selflessness be a part of this, when head and heart are nothing but floorboards? you feel in love, with just a thought, my heart was shamed, my eyes look away, as i only wanted love, as you only wanted a whoreThe downfall - a pleasure to watch it in your arms
Flaming red inferno, we relish the dying horizon
With fiery thorns in your hands
You strike stakes of lust through my heart
When all around us is lit
Our love will gleam like the vital spark
Into an ocean of reddish tears
We glide away, unite our souls
My inflamed skin caressed by your hands
The fever enslaves us again and again...
Thousands of souls torches
Extinct, withered side by side
We are destined to celebrate
The cremation of mankind
Slowly devoured by a gorge of heat
Melted away - the bad depraved seed
Screamed out for help, to heaven they cried
"I declared the earth as purgatory"
All I wanted was to touch the sky,
but I was doomed to fail
Like an anguished child I sank down on my knees
In hopeless desperation I await your final kiss
"His locus est ubi mors gaudet succurrere vitae"Tekst: Ivar Bjrnson 1993
P balkongen skuer hun og lengter
-Isders Dronning
Alene og grtende brer hun sorgen

I landet hvor dag er natt og natt er dag
Ruver et slott med vegger av is, dekket av
rimfrost
Utenfor disse vegger eksisterer intet liv

snkrystaller
I landet hvor vinden grter, bor
tragediens barn
Fdt av frost og kulde, kledd i sorgen
Fra hennes yne renner trer som formes
til perler

En ensom ravn flyr forbi
Den sker videre mot varmen, p vinger

Musikk: Ivar Bjrnson 1993/-94
(Submitted by DrkWarrior@vo.lu)Nothing breeds more contempt for this world
Than memories now formed
Every moment a new seed
Is grown to no reason, the trouble unfolds
For the trials of today
I'm no jury, really don't care how you feel
The pleasant notion of miraculous change
Drifts into multiple jeers
[Chorus]
You want the good life
You break your back
You snap your fingers, you snap your neck
Seconds drip through my hands
Washed of moments unborn
All the spaces between bleed
A tribute to the sacrament never exposed
A message to the forces,
I've no pity, don't know how thankful to feel
Expectations of my daily bread
Gives me the hunger to steal
[Chorus]Fort surrounded by waters, during that winter of battles
Those waters were covered by diamond like ice
In that castle of stone, under siege of curved sabres
It was so freezing, so cold and no food
Sorceress of that castle got an idea to help them away
From the hunger to the victory of war
She just needed to practice sex magic with the warlord
Lord, from enemy side to fulfill victory rite
So she started to enchant warlord from enemy camp
Young warlord seemed to fall in love with sorceress
But he was just pretending he was magician too
By the science of sorcery he knew he attempt for deceit
So he was acting like falling in love with the sorceress
And finally she asked him to meet her in the dark
In the darkness secretly at the gates of castle
She promised to give herself for warlord
Warlord took his warriors along to the gates
Those warriors were hiding in the shadows of the walls
Sorceress opened the gate for warlords entering
But too late she noticed attack of enemy
Fortunately for that castle and for defenders of it
Guard noticed the intruders, so he alarmed all soldiers
After short battle enemy was killed
Sorceress was arrested as a traitor of the land
She was sentenced to the sentence of death
She was put to prisonment, her dungeon was walled up
And she died in that dungeon but she set infernal curse
Epidemic arrived most of warriors died
The fort still stands in middle of dark waters
And every dead of the night a phantom of sorceress
Wanders at those corridors, haunts in those huge halls
And you can hear the echo of her sobbing from the wallsWhen the first single cells, felt the first rays of light
Carbon beings in process leading to life that we have today
A billion years later, technology springs
Exploding progress pushes is forward
But exploring progress is tearing us down
What is fiction is fact
There is no blame for conditioning
Reality's created by ourselves
We're to blame for our problems
Cells of our shells, merge with the earth
Becoming separately involved, composting, transgressing
In order to embrace life and death, we must eliminate
The boundaries that lie between the physical and the spiritual
Symbiosis, a two way process
People read their lives and then create their psychosis
Staying conscious requires effort
Evolution re-awakes the primal subconscious
Aware, awake, alert
Know or felt by ones inner being
Flow and slower, observer and observed
A wave, infinite ocean
Life and death in cyclic motion
You're a human being
You have an ego and mind
It's a useful part of you but it's not you
Flow and slower, observer and observed
A wave, infinite ocean
Life and death in cyclic motion
You're a human being
You have an ego and mind
It's a useful part of you but it's not youI am staring in glass
I see someone that is standing
Who looks a lot like me
Staring in glass, I see someone
Standing who looks a lot but is not me
Just my split identity
The paradise throws me on ice
And I awake with a scream
Can't you see the light, can't you see the time
That is cutting open my sorrowfull eyes
And I am a person who doesn't bleed
from a thousand wounds
I have finally overwon my life
With me go content and moral
and disappear forever
I have finally overwon life
The road I walk is grey
Without reflections, full of delusions
And I don't know where I should go
In the mirror I see my infinity
My crying infinity
I am staring in glass
I am standing alone
And I am a person who doesn't
bleed from a thousands wounds
I have finally overwon my life
With me go content and moral
and disappear forever
I have finally overwon life
Right before me I see my solemn eyes
Looking in the mirror of serenity
They are shining so mysterious
and wide
Even already resigned,
almost immovably
In the mirror I see my infinity
My crying infinity(Matos)
Oh boys, I've seen the old man;
Straw mask around the forehead
The blaze, a blast and the awakening dead
(The magic seeds will spread...)
The bleeding warrior, he has fought
(Healing leaves, piranha teeth, nobody leaves this place 'till the
dawn!)
Against the passion, for the love
(Serpent skin, a savage scream, don't you believe, it grows and
grows...)
Oh boys, it's all so easy:
Warn up the soul
While the body is freezin'!...
- I swear it!
Against the men for the land,
Against the beast to survive
Against the demons to keep the faith
(The spirits and the fate...)
A word - together they will shout!
(Run and pray if you're afraid you better stay away from it all!)
A rumble shakes up all the ground
(Start to sing, to turn and spin, get rid of all your sins right
now!...)
Oh boys, it's all so easy:
Warm up the soul
While the body is freezin'!
A word - together they will shout!
(Healing leaves, piranha teeth, nobody leaves this place 'till the
dawn!)
Against the passion, for the love
(Start to sing, to turn and spin, get rid of all your sins right
now!...)
Oh boys, it's all so easy:
Warm up the soul
While the body is freezin'!
Still we can hope a single word together;
Warm up the soul...
- Boys, I swear I've been there!We have done it too many times
You have seen us fall, seen us crawl
Seen us fighting back again and again
But as so many times before been broken down again
Stolen life
Get yourself a gun, do the world that favor.
Just pull the trigger, come back and you are healed.
Move ahead, take the step, taste the guilt.
You deserve it so swallow.
Cyanide shot injection
The crystal clear purl so sweet
Angel voices caress me into sleep
Courage makes me see
Fear questions my courage
Lies make you doubt
I confront the fact face to face
Without any answers to display my cargo is the end of it all
To take a chance isn't always right
Still it isn't totally wrong
Now I'm cloned, a new person now remade
Done from the ground
Still I scream for breakout
Cyanide shot injection
The crystal clear purl so sweet
Angel voices caress me into sleepInstrumentalThe dawning is over
The morning is over
And I can't look into your eyes
A cold November morning
A shivering new dawning
I watched your energy slide
It's sad to see it dying
That fire once so lively
Now three tears have fallen from my eyes
A dampened need for fire
A kindled desire
The power just vanished from your eyes
This feeling is crying
The sea it is sighing
For spirits that just give up and die
The dawning is overShining bright but yet so dark
Full of love but yet so spiteful
Devoted to the mightiest of all powers
I whisper thy name in my dream
Rise above the storming sea
Come forth and unite with me
My goddess of lust and desire
Come forth and release your fire
Mesmerized by your beauty
I gaze into your eyes
Dreaming away, far away
Into another sphereWe're such a success story
The king is not returning
But living safe and sorry
Another church is burning
See the things out of sight
Time will turn it all to sand
Nothing left and nothing right
Have it all in your hand
Wanna leave but you stay
Slowly rot and fade away
Burn an X in your head
Godly being young & dead
Zombiefield angelic race
Rottten flesh on a pretty face
Had it all in your hand
Young & dead in promise land
We're such a success story
But living safe and sorry
The king is not returning
Another church is burning
More bigger faster better
Dead gods and man-made weather
Firearms made of plastic
Our world is so fantastic
You can't fight what's in your soul
You can't fight what's in your soul
And keep the devil in the hole
Before your eyes it will be unfold[Verse]
Pues ay esta los perdidos
Los hallaron decapitados
Hoy nos falta burros cabrones
Y estoy tomando aplicaciones
Y si tu creas que tu puedes
Ven paca wey - trabajo tienes
Tu sueldo - sera metal!
Pero de cual? No sabemos?[Chorus]
Plata! Cuando llegas y no faltas
O plomo! Vives si la cagas y no llegas o mueres
Plata, si no te falta una grapa
O plomo! Por que si lo llegas te vamos a feriar!
Plata! Si te paran pero sales
O plomo! Vives si tardas y no llamas o mueres
Plata! Si a tiempo siempre llegas
O plomo! Si te creas el mas perron te vamos a plomiar
[Verse]
Si acaso sigues pendejo
Como se jala este trabajo
El negocio es de metal
Yabes pa ya, plata pa aca
Ya metido companero
Pa salir wey... Esos el pedo
Tu sueldo sera metal
Pero de cual? No sabemos?
[Chorus]
Plata! Cuando llegas y no faltas

Plata! Si te paran pero sales

Plata! Si a tiempo siempre llegas
O plomo! Si te creas el mas perron te vamos a plomiar
[Bridge]
Tu creas que tu trabajo
No es algo permanente?
Que si pierdes 100 kilos
Que solo te despido?
Plata o plomo - uno o el otro
Plata o plomo - aqui no hay otro
Estos algo serio, piensalo pendejo
Quieres ser un player, o ser rata callejero
Tienes que escojer, dime cual va ser
Vivir ghtto rico, o guizado en barril
Dime cual va ser, te dejo escojer
Con plata seras rey, con plomo... Muerto wey
[Chorus]
Plata! Cuando llegas y no faltas
O plomo! Vives si la cagas y no llegas o mueres
Plata, si no te falta una grapa
O plomo! Por que si lo llegas te vamos a feriar!
Plata! Si te paran pero sales
O plomo! Vives si tardas y no llamas o mueres
Plata! Si a tiempo siempre llegas
O plomo! Si te creas el mas perron te vamos a plomiar
[Outro]
Ay sta - ya les dije se busca burros cabrones
Plata ganes plomo pierdes este juego players quieren
Y si tu creas que si puedes ven pa ka wey trabajo tienes
Tu sueldo sera metal! Pero de cual - no sabemosCold sweat in nightmares
The desolate one
Deceived by betrayers
Alone in a crystal ball
All hopes are shattered dreams
Through the lens of a neon screen
The hourglass is sifting
Terminal from the final incision
Send signals to space, burned bridges
Too late, the loner is rising
Beware, I've nothing left, nothing left
A silhouette of disfigured
Transparent hypocrisies
A cry through sullen walls
I laugh with despise
Running through the corridor
I've opened the door
The hourglass is sifting
Trying to heal from the final
Send signals to space, burned bridges
Too late, the loner is rising
Beware, I've nothing left, nothing left
Send signals to space, burned bridges
Too late, the loner is rising
Beware, I've nothing left, nothing left
My lips are cracked from the heat
In the desert of pain
The sandstorm cracks my feet
Getting over the storm
The crystal balls open highway
Has opened the door
In my climb I'm like a mirror
Your reflection shatters on you
Nothing leftI work the graveyard shift, cadavers lay silently in wait
My utensils are ready to perform degrading autopsies
Through the sinews of dead flesh
And within the dried marrow of old bones
I have discovered the secrets of the dead
Mercilessly I pit out what the dead cannot hide
I become enlightened with a knowledge that makes me strong
A power I now possess launches me into the afterworld
Traveling paths in the innermost niches of putrefaction
I will become a god of suppuration in this dead domain
But to enter the putrid portal I must frantically carve
Tediously I labor over crude necropsies, bizarre necrotomy
My entire being soon liquefies as I cross over
I take on the form of foul cadaverine
Now through the perished, hardened veins I flow
Immersed into the deceased where no life resides
Except for wriggling fat white maggots filled with smegma and decay
Apparitions haunt the viscera, my presence they avoid
In terror they try so hard to hide
Disappearing into the offal of the btchered
When the dead go the way of all that is flesh
And the burdensome mortal coil is shaken off
Moving as I wish between the living and the dead
Carcasses are tenements for all spectral souls
An actual cosmos existing within a corpse
The morticians could not fathom what I see
Like a scalpel I cut my way through the necrosphere
Plunging into the deepest recesses of the carrion
They are unable to flee from my disembodied grasp
The dead scream as I infernally enslave them
Truly I am gifted, empowered with necromacy
Originating in dead matter makes me necrogenic
The interior decomposed membranes of the stiffs from a necrosphere
Which has always remained unseen by mortal eyes
Until I found the concealed secrets of the rot realm
Now I am divine, the dead now worship me
As if I am a godYou see me hang my spirits high
My dirty linen's out to dry
I've sought not freedom nor espy
Placating reason in the rhyme
A vindication of my crime
To ridicule the most sublime
Is an art I wish to kill
Now I'm crowning new dementia
With the thorns of yesterday
Liaising pandora
Laureate of disarray
Each eye through blindness finds its sight
Each peak through valleys finds its height
Each wrong through nil can make a right
For nil will excavate that strain
Nor subjugate the caustic pain
The linen doused within the rain
Again and again and again...
Now I'm crowning new dementia
With the thorns of yesterday
Liaising pandora
Laureate of disarray
And I'm breathing in absentia
Through the thorns of every day
Liaising pandora
As I drink the guilt awayEsperÃ¡ndote esta noche siento algo especial,
El latido de mi corazÃ³n a toda velocidad no te
puedo olvidar ni un momento has provocado la locura en mi, tan
solo espero que tu llegues pronto solo quiero estar junto a ti

Un saludo tanto gusto encantado de volverte a ver
toda la anoche por delante tu me miras why yo tambiÃ©n
se acaba enseguida la conversaciÃ³n la ropa vuela en la habitaciÃ³n
nada frena el deseo solo hay pasiÃ³n si quieres verme en otra ocasiÃ³n

Marca mi nÃºmero es el seis seis

Me has dicho algunas veces si esto nos puede acortar
nicotina why unos trapos es la vitamina ideal
mi amor a todas horas why en cualquier lugar puede ser muy original
hacia arriba why abajo como quieras tu siempre que el cuerpo te pida mas

Marca mi nÃºmero es el seis seis seis[Music and Lyrics: Mark Kelson]
Is this my coldest winter
I've lost my warmth, my soul
so still in your coffin
I want to touch you
a vision of perfection
hear your heart beat
hold you close
in all your splendour
must I travel eternity
without feeling the warmth
of your breath on my skin. . .
I have fallen from grace
numb is all I feel. . .
Shall I awaken from
this twisted dream
from this darkened symphony
which is my agony
Our love is
stronger than death
I can feel you
through my veins
like the desire
I once saw in your eyes
you shall come to me
and we shall unite. . .
I have fallen from grace
numb is all I feel. . .
Shall I awaken from
this twisted dream
from this darkened symphony
which is my agonykeep on pretending
an artificial trick
spread magis sparks
enjoy this happy hour
brighten your wrinkled face
hope you won't get tired of smiling
such a fascinating scene
nevermind our greedy sights
what an ache this state could bring
that which slowly disappears
architects of better future
seemingly so fragile staff
no hidden cameras at all
call and win - don't dare to think
some things they're not destined to last
as we brought those fires
can't stand this immense tension
wish I could step out from this hurt
a madcap show
systematic acts
heroes of new age
stuck in global distaste
second hand motions
false feelings' trade
surprised & staggered
construction slowly breaks
on and on - in endless search
our souls are rotten to the core
just a joker from a box
ingenious puppet dance
feel the heat is on
celebrate world hello dayBy the works of Darkness... My
By the works of Hatred... Eyes
By the rites of the Waste... Meet
By the words of Pain... Yours
And our eyes meet the flames!
Zi dingir Cutha, Kampa!
Zi dingir Absu, Kampa!
Zi dingir Cutha, Kampa!
Zi dingir Absu, Kampa!!!
No spice shall ever silence my hunger
No wine shall ever silence my thirst.
No delight shall ever satisfy my senses
No woman shall ever satisfy my lust.
My eyes meet yours and I turn my face awayThere is a deep pathos here
A monumental sorrow
Blood has stained this ground
The very land itself a barrow
The echoes of battle ring cold through the ages
The moon shines on old dunes, awakening ancient hatreds
Swords held high to the desert sky at such great a cost
Standards fly above funeral pyres
Victory and loss
We are strong, but when the day is done we are left bereaved
Marching on to the battle drum
Triumph and defeat
Behold the storming flood of iron
Destruction wrought there upon the field
A host of warriors fall, never to return
Their epitaph a song of steel
Empires built upon the bones of those who stood beside us
The sun has set eternally into the dark
And we have seen the fields of war steal the lives of sons and brothers
The iron heart of glory beats a hollow dirge
The gods of battle rise and fall but the thirst for blood lives on
The Wolves of Winter rise and howl for honour's debt
The sands forever greedily consume the blood of friends and fathers
The gates of Hood will open wide with dreams of death
There is a deep pathos here
A monumental sorrow
Blood has stained this ground
The very land itself a barrowThere is a wicked barrier that detaches and discolors our unattainable
dreams from our inescapable realities
Nothing chafes the ego more than the monstrous realism of eight hours of
subservience
applied for and anticipated so that the possibility of a less materialistic
existence could be avoided
Like slowly sucking cold tar through a narrow straw
Vomit upon your dreams
Slowly sucking until you dieOur forefathers came with a vision and dream, to settle on this land
They built a great nation with blood and sweat, to benefit all of man
A path of destruction they did not see, they did not understand
Live for the moment instead of the future, typical for all of man
Chorus:
Overpopulation will soon take its toll
The growth of mankind is simply out of control
Soon no where to turn, we run short of precious land
Take our complex problems and place them in our children's hands
Living on a dream, a final prayer, future lies unseen
Hope to make a difference in our lives, its up to you and me
Destroying ourselves day by day, can we change at all
Hope for the best and keep on fighting before we take a fall
Repeat chorus
In the past, wars were benifical, man's its only enemy
Without this devastation we have inequality
People live longer thatn yeasterday, their offspring on the rise
It's mordern science, will it be answer or will it be our demise
Repeat chorus
Solo: Skowron
Repeat third verse
Repeat chorusYeah
Now we're Anthrax and we take no shit
And we don't care for writing hits
The sound you hear is what we like
I'll steal your pop-tarts like I stole your socks
Yo man, what's the matter with you?
I'll get it the next time, I mean it
Charlie, beat the beats, the beats you beat
The only thing harder is the smell of my feet
So listen up 'cause you might get dissed
Go drain the lizard or take a chair
Damn, watch the beat
I'm on your case, I'm in your face
Kick you and your father back in place
Step up sucker, understand
Don't you know
I'm the man, I'm the man
I'm so bad I should be in detention
I'm the man, shut, shut, shut, shut
Shut up
We've got real def rhythms and fresh new jams
And ya think we got egos but we're just hams
Scott plays stick ball and likes to skate
Frank is never on time he's always sleeping
Late
They drink the drinks, the drinks they drank
I put my money in the bank
They cut their crack, they offer joints
We don't do drugs, do you get our meaning
Point, point, watch the beat
I'm on your case, I'm in your face
Kick you and your father back in place
Step up sucker, understand
Don't you know
I'm the man, I'm the man
I'm bad, I'm so bad I should be in detention
I'm the man, shut, shut up
For a heavy metal band raps a different way
We like to different and not cliche
They say rap and metal can never mix
Well all of them can suck our
Sexual organ located in the lower abdominal area
No man, it's dick
Master
Fart the farts, the farts he farted
I pick my nose 'cause I'm retarded
Like El Duce says, "Smell my anal vapor
And wipe my butt with your face
Toilet paper, yo, watch the beat
I'm on your case, I'm in your face
Kick you and your father back in place
Step up sucker, understand
Don't you know
I'm the man, I'm the man
I'm bad, I'm so bad I should be in detention
I'm the man, shut, shut, shut up
So, as this rap is winding down
It's plain to see we wear the crown
You know Anthrax is number one
But we don't care, we just wanna have a festival
Fun you stupid, idiot
Joey mailed the mail, the mail he mailed
We are the kings that all shout hell
We're like a diamond that is forever
And will remain the hardest ever
I'm so bad, it's a crime
NotLa luna regala, una sonrisa,
Y el viento, aÃºn llora.
Gente enferma pide, y pide sin sangrar,
Del fuego eterno nadie entiende, nadie mira el sol,
Caen los cielos y llora el viento (x2)
La luna nos regala una sonrisa y ahora la tierra parece, despertar,
La luna nos regala una sonrisa y ahora la tierra parece, despertar,
La luna nos regala una sonrisa y ahora la tierra parece, respirar,
Tragar lagrimas negras de almas muertas que parecen sonreÃ­r, no es normal,
Tragar lagrimas negras de almas muertas que parecen sonreÃ­r, no es normal,
Tragar lagrimas negras de almas muertas que parecen sonreÃ­r, no es normal,You'd never imagine
Us bringing a loaded gun
To the ballroom
This party's about to kick off
Tonight is the wrong night
The devil's own are
Only starting up the first round of the fight
So hang on tight
Dear mother, the needle
Is jabbing the womb
Draw back and release
This child of disease
This mob is a riot
The outlaw youth are
Only emptying the first round of the night
'Cause everything's not alright
I suppose you thought you had our hands behind our backs
Wool over our eyes
Now your pulse is in my palm and you stand hands to mouth
Wearing your disguise
It's pretty apparent
This boy is a curse
The Christ of the moment
So blow him away
Hey come on and take the new number
If you're next in line
Then kid I got a really big fucking surprise
There won't be a next time
I suppose you thought you had our hands behind our backs
Wool over our eyes
Now your pulse is in my palm and you stand hands to mouth
Wearing your disguise
I suppose you thought you had our hands behind our backs
Wool over our eyes
Now your pulse is in my palm and you stand hands to mouth
Wearing your disguise
I suppose you thought you
I suppose you thought you
I suppose you thought you
Pulled the wool over our eyes
I suppose you thought you
I suppose you thought you
I suppose you thought you
Pulled the wool over our eyesThree inch health

Lay down the law
It's great to see
I've become what you hate

Blame unintentionalism
Scared of pride
Hate what you don't understand
(I am) laughing all the way to the grave
It's great to see
I've become what you hate
I grow

Father of the world, where have you gone?
The sons you have made are loosin' their minds.
The seed of all evil is now sown in their hearts
War killing machine is never gonna stop.
No! No! No! No! No!
This is not the way to go
The world needs your love!
Where have you gone?
Your child of madness is longing for his life
'Cause war, sickness and death have knocked him to the ground
This world is going to pieces,
We can't make it all alone
We have been forsaken
At the beginning of the end.
No! No! No! No! No!
This is not the way to go
The world needs your love!
Where have you gone?
Slaughter! Illness! Death!
War! AIDS! Drugs!
Fanatics! Priests! Bombs!
You don't care!
No! No! No! No! No!
This is not the way to go
The world needs your love!
Where have you gone?After times of desolation
Frozen minds will melt
Our buried souls are rising
The deep fall of heaven
Fallen angels are with me
Their shadows darken the sky
Storms are coming
We will enter a new chapter of time
Beyond damnation of soul
We have left our mortal bodies
We will go everywhere
We will live!breeding, seething,
feeding, breeding
oush one reality, push two for
what you wanna see
for what's to be
program finance inconsistencies
for some legalities
preaching out,
their righteous ways
preaching rape,
preaching rape through their
enslaved cash hogs
it's not my reality... yeah!
seething, feeding, breedingOpen my eyes felling the dark
With downward eye, gaze sad
Under the rain walking alone
Looking for the last door
I hear a song and touch the stars
From dawn to dusk
There is a force of clatiry
There is a light
Gaze not in my eyes!
Can I enter the hole of light?
You reach a hand to hold me but
I can't be your awake gide
Breath's a ware that will not keep
I must keep my last breath
Like the mass of the hills
When the moonlight revive
Shinning on the blind eyes
I'm feeling that
Time remains what is was
I am waiting for you
At the end of a tune
In the dawn, in the grey dawn
Time leave me nowYou have returned to the torture-chambers
To find peace among the rotting corpses
You have returned to the execution place
To inhale the smell of blood
Death and terror rules the land
We have been spellbound
By the Devil
You have returned to the hidden graves
Only you know about
You have returned to to face your victims
And feel sensation of violence once again
Death and terror rules the soul
You have been spellbound
By the Devil
Murderer, you have returned
To create fear and sorrow
Death and terror rules the land
We have been spellbound
By the DevilPump, pump, pump it up
Pump, pump, pump it up
Pump, pump, pump it up
Pump, pump it up, pump, pump it up
So boy, I'll be your woman now
And in just about half a hour
I'll be kissing you a thousand times
But I want more from you
You know what it could be
Yes, I wish we spend the night together
This has been my greatest dream forever
If I only knew what's waiting for me
That's why I, I want to tell you
Well, tonight I turn eighteen
Now I know just what you mean
You can kiss me everywhere
I'm eighteen and I don't care
Well, tonight I turn eighteen
I'm no longer seventeen
In the car or on the stairs
You can have me anywhere
At the party we will dance for hours
Luckily my friends now left the power
Say goodbye and leave for good
Now it's down to us, just you and me
We are alone looking at each other
My friends are gone
I don't know why are such a bother
Mom and Dad no longer rule my world
Now I want to have it all
Well, tonight I turn eighteen
Now I know just what you mean
You can kiss me everywhere
I'm eighteen and I don't care
Well, tonight I turn eighteen
I'm no longer seventeen
In the car or on the stairs
You can have me anywhere
Well, tonight I turn eighteen
Now I know just what you mean
You can kiss me everywhere
I'm eighteen and I don't care
Well, tonight I turn eighteen
I'm no longer seventeen
In the car or on the stairs
You can have me anywhere
Yes, I wish I spend a night together
This has been my greatest dream forever
If I only knew what's waiting for me
That's why I, I want to tell you
Well, tonight I turn eighteen
Now I know just what you mean
You can kiss me everywhere
I'm eighteen and I don't care
Well, tonight I turn eighteen
I'm no longer seventeen
In the car or on the stairs
You can have me anywhere
Pump it up, pump, pump it up
Well, tonight I turn eighteen
Now I know just what you mean
You can kiss me everywhere
I'm eighteen and I don't care
Well, tonight I turn eighteen
I'm no longer seventeen
In the car or on the stairs
You can have me anywhereThese endless sufferings will never stop
Your departure's brought emptiness in my mind
I hear the angels singing your funeral hymn
Memories of you remind me of your wasted life
Why did you leave me here without telling a last goodbye?
Dark thoughts come to me
And contaminate my mind
So many tears I have shed thinking of you
So many nights I have suffered from your absence
These endless sufferings will never stop
Your departure's brought nothingness in my heart
I hear the angels weeping your funeral hymn
Memories of you remind me of your wasted life
Why did you leave me here without telling me a last goodbye?
Dark thoughts come to me
And contaminate my mind
So many tears I have shed thinking of you
So many nights I have suffered from your absenceThe ivory is cold, where is my desire
In a cage of gold, not a trace of fire
Ice cold as ice. I'm heading for tomorrow
I am tired of waiting. I'll beg and steal and borrow
Life is too short to be wasted
So why do I sit around
Dance on the edge of a razor
Get off the ground and I'll never return
Walk on fighting
Don't look ever back
Walk on fighting
Don't you look back to your cries
The phone it waits in silence, no message left by you
There is no use in crying. I know I've been a fool
Now it's too late, no words left to say
I gotta call it late, Forget and look away
Life is too short to be wasted
So why do I sit around
Dance on the edge of a razor
Get off the ground and I'll never return
Walk on fighting...[1.]
Eisig ist die Nacht, und der Rsser dumpfer Hufschlag drhnt
Schneessturm peitscht das Land, unsre Haare wehen wild im Wind
Voll Blutdurst jeder Ger und der Stahl singt kalt und Silberhell
So geht es in der Schlacht, wir erreichen die Feinde schnell
[2.]
Dem Feind entgegen ohne Zagen, niemand wei, wer wiederkehrt
xte spalten Schdel, rotgetrnkt ist jedes Schwert
Aus tausend Wunden strmt es warm, am Kriegerblut der Grund sich labt
Und Schlachtendonner hallt aus dem Nebeldunst, der blutrot wabt
Manche Brnne bricht entzwei, mancher Helm gibt preis das Hirn
Gen Walhall' ziehn tote Helden auf den Rssern der Walkr'n
Wotan schleudert Blitze wild und Donar schwingt den Hammer stark
Feinde werd'n gemetzelt in dieser rasend-wsten Schlacht
[3.]
Die Feinde sind zerschlagen nun, wie welkes Laub vom Wind verweht
Stolz hebt die Eisenfaust zum Grue fr alles das, was ewig steht
Wann immer sich ein Gegner naht, gedenken wir des Blutschwurs treu
Dann geht es auf zur nchsten Schlacht, da stehts das Land bewehret seiDrowning in the sunset's lullaby
Sleeping in the womb of the firefly
Floating in a sequence frozen still
The liquid reaper mover in for the kill
Standing by the shore
Last departure cannot wait no more
(soon to close its doors)
A farewell in grey
See all the lost ones now march away
(serpentine parade)
The end of forever
The last wave of the cosmic sea
Manifestation of the never
A last sting of the honey bee
Floating in a sequence frozen still
The liquid reaper mover in for the kill
Fail to breath inside my hollow shell
Felt no sorrow as the curtain fellThus ends the fifth battle
By the treachery of men the field is lost
The night falls and great is the triumph of evil
The league is broken
The last vestige of hope lives in the hidden king
Only he troubles the dark one's mind
Only he could bring ruin to the black foe
Though the land lies down in agony and the curse lives on
A new star shall arise
And a new day shall come, againLord I miss the highway, running against the wind
Blessed are the stoned, and all the places they've been
Shadow of a man at home, beating a dead horse
Home too long, cross to bear
Methods of the past mold the future
You can't fall short as you get older
Wear the chains you forged in life
Link by link by link
I've been sober thirteen days and seven nights
I know next time I'll get it right
You tried to make me stay
I said 'No Way', grabbed my bag and hit the highway
Echoes in the dark, new faces bring the sun
Comfort and disturbed, always think the worst
You live and die by your own decisions
You live and die by your own religion
Being run around is being trapped
Seized up, kept!
Wear the chains you forged in life
Link by link by link
Link by link by link
I've been sober thirteen days and seven nights
I know next time I'll get it right
You tried to make me stay
I said 'No Way', grabbed my bag and hit the highway
I said 'No Way', grabbed my bag and hit the highway
Sobriety suits you so well, it suits you so well
It suits you so well
It suits you so well
So well!Mass ceremonial suicide,
a nation of millions caught in the jaws of a lie,
uniform stagnant filth,
sub culture with no remorse or guilt,
feeding the frenzy of fears,
it feeds on it's young for years
A new chain for the same set of slaves,
a new shovel for the same set of graves
I can't pretend I care anymore,
none of this is worth anything anymore,
an angel with the eyes of a whore,
this facade has been bleeding from the core
A new home not far from the last,
a new home from the same suffocating pastAll my life it seems my line has been set
And this time I'm gonna play to win
'Coz here you are at my fingertips
Gonna reach right out and pull you in
It doesn't matter what you do
I simply gotta make you mine
And even though I cry for you
I could never break the tie
It doesn't matter what they say
I just can't get enough
It doesn't matter anyway
I'm never gonna give you up
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you go
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you go
Never, never, never, never
Never, never, never, never
Mama says someday that I'll meet someone
Who will take me away from you
I guess that she just doesn't know about love
There can be no substitute
'Coz what I feel for you is strong
I simply gotta make you mine
I have waited much too long
I can never let this die
It doesn't matter what they say
I just can't get enough
It doesn't matter anyway
I'm never gonna give you up
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you go
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you go
Never, never, never give you up
Never, never
Never, never, never give you up
Never never
Never, yeah
All this wanting and frustration I feel
I'm sure I'll pay the price
But I keep my dreams until I make them real
'Coz I know you're worth the sacrifice
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you go
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you go
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna, never gonna
Never gonna let you go
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna, never gonna
Never gonna let you go
Never gonna give you upI am the scumbag that you want to kick,
because your girl - she sucked my dick.
knowing I got a piece of her hide.
Frustration eats you from inside,
I'm the home wrecker and the damage is done.
So we laugh at you as I'm flying the cum,
Your little slut, whore, wife won't be the same,
you make her cum - she screams my name!
You have no power, I devour.
COMPOUND PRESSURE!
swallowed my spunk with no disgrace.
I got a big fat cock and I shot her face,
Did her doggy style up her fucking ass,
BILE style - bloody and fast!
Let all my friends dog her when I was through,
crew.
she was thinking of you when she fucked my whole
but I fucked your woman to get back at you.
You have no power, I devour.
I'm the lowest motherfucker now that is true,
COMPOUND PRESSURE!
You ain't nothing, how does it feelThe gone staying by me
Feeling disease, crying sun
Soil adorning me, preparing to grow
Fever, disgust, dear sigh
Bewatching the truth, morals to break
Catch soon the breeze, immortals
And if my tears were only joyful
I would better rest in silence
Instead of writing down my claims
To pleasure such a lonely road
A sombre tangle to disclose
The damned poets of dirt
Lake fulfilled with sand, prayers of lies
Wishing disease, unholy blue
Is covering meand our sins
Forever gone, trapped in lifeWhere will you be they tense for warfare?
What will you see with your innocence there?
Where will you be my darling?
Where will you be they tense for warfare?
Where will you be when God is glorifying?
There we will be between the dead and dying
Where will you be my darling?
Where will you be when God is glorifying?
Prophecies and glory forge a massive disdain
For lying passive in the shadows whilst the enemy reigns
Devoted to the votive, holy standard above
"By command of the king of Heaven"
Came the death of love
Where will you be when they're vilifying?
How will they see when the truth is blinding?
Where will you be my darling?
Where will you be when they're vilifying?
Where will you be when the dark is rising?
How will you keep from it's terrorizing?
Where will you be my darling?
Where will you be when the dark is rising?
Burning was the sunset like a portent of doom
On the saintly iron maiden as she fell from her wound
But visions and ambition
Never listened to submission
And she was on a mission from the highest above
To Lord upon the slaughter
Like a sword through hissing water
She arose where archers sought her
For the death of love
The righteous death of love
Gilles adored her drama
Her suit of pure white armor
Blazed against the English in a torrent of light
And as they rallied onto night
A cancer fled his soul
Dissolving
Framed amid the thick of fire
Aflame, a Valkyrie
She made him click without desire
And in his eyes she swam a Goddess
And even when they caught her breath
Her words would leave a scar
"For only in the grip of darkness
Will we shine amidst the brightest stars"
How will you breathe when their wheels are turning?
How will you know if the sky is burning?
Where will you be my darling?
How will you breathe when their wheels are turning?
Where will you be when Babel builds my fire?
Will you not flee and label me pariah?
Where will you be my darling?
Where will you be when they light my pyre?
Aligned with Joan in all
That was enthroned and divine
He swore to score the crimes
Jackdaws poured on this dove
Crimes he knew alone
Derived from minds of the blind
The church unfurled for murder perched
Upon the death of love
Framed amid the thick of fire
Aflame, a Valkyrie
She claimed the skies were lit with spires
And in his eyes she swam a Goddess
And even when she fought for breath
Her words would leave a scar
"For only in the grip of darkness
Will we shine amidst the brightest stars"I gave up everything
Even though I was a king
I sat under the crown
I'm waiting for the light
I won't be leaving soon
'Cause life is just waiting
But I know for what
It's good to know
That it's only diception
I'll wait 40 days or 9 lives
It really doesn't matter
What counts is here and now
Not surfing in California
Light is worth 100 prayers
Demons stealing peace are merciless
They are strong but can be beat
By 2 small girls: Love and humility
Bright so light!!!Calling my friends, calling out
All at the end and falling down now
Fall back again I've no doubt
Try to pretend there's no way out now
I'm calling my friends but times are changing and tomorrow
you'll remember what I'm saying
Even if I'm on my own calling out
All I can see is clouded out
All I can be I've found it out now
Oh life back then just hung about
and time well spent is handed down now
I'm calling my friends but times are changing and tomorrow
you'll remember what I'm saying
Even if I'm on my own calling out
What can I do about the way the futures fading?
How can I change the laws of life?
With all the bad things I never get deflated
I remember what I'm saying
Even if I'm on my own calling outThis time I'm giving up on you. It's what I'll keep telling myself. The
hourglass has dropped its final grain, I can't complain. I should've
expected more from you. Though I expected more, those big green eyes just
dropped me to the floor. We flickered long ago, now just smoldering ash.
The wind will take it away. In our lungs, through our sorry souls. I
should be there by your side. I've tried. Your affections change with the
wind's directions. I have a confession. I would love to know why you give
me this second hand sympathy, what more do you want from me? Don't leave me
with this. Again.Church bells resounded like judgment day
As they were making love
In the rainswept graveyard
She fucked him hard, silhouetted by flame
A monsoon Tigress set upon prey
Fall for the love of me
Crawl for the love of me
Drool for the love of my virulent sway
I grow more master the faster the days
Lilith Immaculate
This delectable reaper
Her eyes were profound
Drawing him in deeper
Until he was drowned
Hurled on the shore
Of the world underground
Lilith Immaculate
Mortal kind, a morbid wine
For this dark moon goddess
And freed to stretch her claws
This beautiful whore
Would be brutally honest
Tortuous one, taboos undone
A glittering star on a sea of myriad waves
And a thickening mist, a seductress
Leading lovesick hearts astray
Lilith
In the throes of orgasm, she bucked and he broke
At the height of the storm, the chaos they'd smote
Burning behind her in arabesque smoke
Framed a vision transformed as she sucked from his throat
Victoria smiled, her now golden eyes
Possessed a regal bearing
Of omnipotent power
From wet lips to her smoldering thighs
Her beauty perfected and her will agonized
Fall for the love of me
Crawl for the love of me
Drool for the love of my virulent sway
I grow more the master the faster the days
Lilith Immaculate
With dread single purpose
Her mind told him stay
She strode through the fire
Desire aflame
She murdered the nuns
In such horrible ways
Lilith Immaculate
"That night we lay entwined on hay
Inside a soldier's barn
Her panting breath an opiate
As in her bolder grasp
I caught the scent of desert sands
The Holy lands, the fall of reason
But only when I smelt the blood
Did I fear her colder hand"
"I am darkness, I am sin
The Queen of lust invited in
Reborn at last to cast my
Fecund shadow on this world,
You shall worship me, enslaved
For many lovers shall I crave
And in return, I'll gladly pave
Your psycho path with pearls
For I have been grating
And waiting so long to find
The most perfect hostess close to me
Whose thin-ice troubled mind
Was like a cracked, black ornate mirror
To slip right through in time
When at last I wore Harmonia's necklace
The cursed twin serpents mine"
Tortuous one, debauchery won
The attention of Emperors, Princes and Tsars
For the toll of her kiss, no soul could dismiss
The advance of her throne from afar
This English rose with traits of those
Who graced the harems of the East
Adorned with thorns, she raised the horns
And scarlet hems to wasted priests
Fall for the love of me
Crawl for the love of me
Drool for the love of my virulent sway
I grow more master the faster the days
Lilith Immaculate
This delectable reaper
Her eyes were profound
They drew him in deeper
Until he was drowned
Hurled on the shore
Of the world underground
Lilith Immaculate
Fall for the love of me
Crawl for the love of me
Drool for the love of my virulent sway
I grow more master the faster the days
Lilith Immaculate
The flutes and sweet wine
Of her voice anodyne
Her power was growing
Every hour malign
The truth, Lilith's kingdom
Drew closer with timeWe are the chosen ones, we sacrifice our blood
We kill for honor
We are the holy ones our armours stained with blood
We killed the dragon
In glory we return, our destination's end
We slayed the dragon!
No more living in fear it's time to raise our king.
We made it happen we're the chosen ones!
Riding through thunder and lighting once again
We slayed the beast we brought an end
Now we have left the kingdom of the damned
Heroes of the day, legends forever!
It seems to me like a journey without end
So many years, too many battles
We've finally arrived, now we're standing at the gates
Heroes of the day, legends foreverThe storm is approaching, infernal darkness,
Covered the sun and the night fell.
The Lord of hideous monsters got the mortal,
Grips with the king of light.
Two minds and two bodies clashed with
Each other: Hell and heaven.
Rule, power, axe - it was the
Picture of my king.
He gave us faith in life,
They showed us how to fight with evil.
Now he's gone.
I'm anxious about my life.
I'm anxious about our future.
That's the end. Collapse. Ruin all around.
I'm dazzled by the blaze of fire.
I see the exhaustion of my king slaying,
The lord of shadows. They die together.
Their bodies get smashed against the rocks.
Bloody mortal remains of my kings are
Crying for vengeance.
There's nobody to take revenge.
Rule, power, axe - it was the
Picture of my king.
He gave us faith in life,
They showed us how to fight with evil.
Now he's gone.
I'm anxious about my life.
I'm anxious about our future.Time is the defacer. Time is the devourer. The grand mediator of effect and the prosthesis to which we depend. Time is the defacer. Time is the devourer. The harnessed horse of reason and the place where meaning collapses. Borders are constructed, divisions are demarcated. The essence of science is control, but the essence of control is loff of. Neither subject nor object, time is abject. As any crime shows the fragility of the law, as any corpse shows the fragility of the body, time bares fragility of the symbolic order. The violent revolt of being.I walk down to the seashore
To bury my hate
I wait till the morning of the mourning
But it's too late
Down to the seashore
Through the illuminous gate
You wait for tomorrow but today is today
No one can understand my pain
Find me the ocean
Where waters stand still
Nothing can befall evermore
Find me the ocean which swallows all that floats
It's time to prevail your conspiracy
It's a whisper of a dead man
I've heard it before
It's yearning my emotions
Before I was born
It was only delusion
Of illuminous gate
'cause today is the day
Find me the ocean
Where waters stand still
Nothing can befall evermore
Find me the ocean which swallows all that floats
It's time to prevail your conspiracyAs twilight died
Blazing throught a mountain wood
I ran away by faith in a burning flame in vain!
When you think you know the way
To reach the place without a name
You just can't wait
Scared, in despair
A girl appeared in white clothes
And lighting up a trail up the slope (said:)
,,Try and fly to the sky"
a house stood high
Ten floors to climb
I think I saw a million traces there
And I went up the stairs
No one anywhere
Only empty chairs...
But a lady in bed
Once she said
,, If when I'm dead I stay alive
I'll kiss your ahnd like a butterfly"
I saw her lying in bed
As pale as death
To an end had come her life
I felt her soul was still inside
Scared, in despair
A girl appeared in white clothes
And lighting up a trail up the slope (said:)
,,Try and fly to the sky"
a house stood high
Ten floors to climb
I think I saw a million traces there
And I went up the stairs
No one anywhere
Only empty chairs...
But a lady in bed
Once she said
,, If when I'm dead I stay alive
I'll kiss your ahnd like a butterfly"
I saw her lying in bed
As pale as death
To an end had come her life
I felt her soul was still inside
I saw a lady in bed
Once she said
,, If when I'm dead I stay alive
I'll kiss your ahnd like a butterfly"
I found her lying in bed
As pale as death
To an end had come her life
I felt she kept her soul inside[J. Nordavind '96]
A cold sharpened blade
plunge through the skin.
Death triumphant.
Death the king
Blood on my hands.
Blood on my lips
I took the frail bliss of your eyes
and its darker than you think...
I violate.
I come at night.
My great endurance of body, mind and heart[Bonus Track]Catch fire just like a living disease
Unholy desire a world on it's knees
Our burning minds they are ridden of hope
In a dreaming utopia dead on dope
A generation of obscenities
We have lost our faith in our own creativity
What is evil, but good
Tortured by it's own hunger and thirst?
The living end
The dwarfed soul of man
The living end
The sweetest of lies it's embrace so warm
So void of life one with the promised swarm
Our burning minds they are ridden of hope
In a dreaming utopia dead on dope
A generation of obscenities
Our ignorance will be the end of humanity
A dead nation under one dead god
The living end
The dwarfed soul of man
The living end
Written in napalm over genetic wastelands
We move on, our fate is to die by our own hand
A dead nation under one dead god
What is evil, but good
Tortured by it's own hunger and thirst?Grow strong
and learn to fly
Do not for an instant
consider
the circling death above
nor the slithering one
below
Soar and bask
in your youth
Many and vile
are the pains on your path
Blacksmith of fortune and fate,
a cunning trickster,
brings down the hammer
with unexeeded might
Mad and blind
(Will you be crushed?)
Better not ponder
Follow the footprints
Do not worry,
you will always be caught
if you fall...
(...won't you?)Weakling avenger
On grains of drain
Life
Wielding ultimate death
Bombastic necrohell
Seeping in bitterly
Masked beast temporarily
Revealing sick fear
Templates broken
Membranes burst
Sordid spilling wound
Spineless locust embrace
Infertile foggy renderings
Failure
Sucked into the sorrowhole
Brutally avenging nothingBlessed is he who has got
His transgressions forgiven
And his sins hidden
Blessed is the man whom the Lord
Do not ascribe misdeeds
And is without deceit in his spirit
Buried it deep inside
But soon a sprout came forth
It kept on growing
I couldn't hide
When I kept it to myself
Slowly my bones corroded
And my vitality vanished
Like in the summer dry
Too many people living this life
Who can take their guilt away?
Their minds are rotting
And causing an endless pain
Soon they are demented and put away
I confessed my sins to You
And did not hide my guilt
I said "I want to confess my misdeeds to You"
And He took away my sin and guiltNight brings patience
And lucidity of mind
Am I the only one who is awake?
It seems to me that right now
Things are even more real and clear
To some extent I am filled with darkness
With darkness
I dont need the sun to be my source of light
Cause Ive got it inside
I dont need the moon to be my company
Cause Ive got it inside
Ive locked the darkness in the lighthouse
Its all about keeping it inside and not letting it out
This is what my life turns in
I am filled with darkness and light
Im a lighthouse
I dont need the sun to be my source of light
Cause Ive got it inside
I dont need the moon to be my company
Cause Ive got it inside
I give my light to those who are adrift and keep the darkness inside
Cause I am
A lighthouse
I dont need the sun to be my source of light
Cause Ive got it inside
I dont need the moon to be my company
Cause Ive got it insideInnocents are all the children
Rubbing their lamps, planting their beans
Hoping that one day, miracles will happen
Never knowing what it means, what it means
When the sun goes down, mysteries begin
The fullmoon brings monsters around
Vampires and werewolves could now come in
And all the shelters could be found
Pride in their heart when heroes win
Sadness comes when they fail
Eyes wide open, hope within
Victory's like wind in the sail
Where have gone those wonderful stories
They made us fear, laugh and cry
We want our dreams and fantasies
Give us back our fairytales, our fairytales
Tales of hope, tales of misery
Tell us now, tell us the moral
Is there really one in every story?
No matters if it's good or evil
Pride in their heart when heroes win
Sadness comes when they fail
Eyes wide open, hope within
Victory's like wind in the sail
Where have gone those wonderful stories
They made us fear, laugh and cry
We want our dreams and fantasies
Give us back our fairytales, our fairytalesIf god forgives, then god forgive me
Because the pain I cause is the pain I feel.
Underachieve...
There is not much I'll ever be when all I see
Is the evil that surrounds me.
If god forgives then god forgive me.
If god forgives then god forgive me.
You don't forgive.
All I see is the evil that surrounds me.
it's amazing how quickly the mind matures
When the world outside creates internal war.
I know, I know what's right... I do the wrong thing.
My heart and soul will fade until emotions die.
May the fire in my eyes light the way for me.
May the bridges that I burn take out my enemies.
If god forgives, then god forgive me.[Hunters And Prey version in Brazilian Portuguese]

[Lyrics: Rafael Bittencourt]
Vai como um rei
Voa na presa
Espanta de vez
E a fome vem
Cruzando rios,
Montes e cus
Vaga no ar
S outra vez
Morrendo o dia
Respira exausto
Estria sem fim
Matar ou morrer
Atrs da trilha
Olhos de guia
Fitam coelhos
Fogo de palha
No sei bem se sou
Caa ou caador
Hoje e amanh
O rio vai e eu vou atrs
A esperar resposta
Pro que vou dizer
Se o dia foi da caa
Quem ir saber?
Espero que o tempo
Faa-me entender
Que o corpo cai na terra
E ela h de comer, tudo outra vez!
No sei bem quem sou
Nem pra onde vou
Hoje e amanh
O rio vai e eu
Vou atrs
A esperar que o vento
Traga-me o condor
O dia foi da caa
Ou do caador?
Espero que o tempo
Faa-me entender
Que o corpo cai na terra
E ela h de comer,
Tudo outra vez
Tudo outra vez
Tudo outra vez!!!Tenderness is greed
Yearning is remorse
Love me so that I can abuse you
Sin after sin I feel endless shame
This land is afraid of the light
This soul is short of bitterness
Tenderness is beautiful
Yearning is strange
Leave me so that I can miss you
Sin anfter sin I feel endless shameThe foul smell of evil hangs over the moores
Where in a lonely hut witches dwell.
Repelling creatures ageless feared and fitted
With powers from the depths of hell.
Once a noble man a baron brother of the king himself
Visited the witches on a daark dark night.
He asked assist to gain the throne
He sold his soul to win a fight.
The days getting short and nights getting colder
winter has come, the sun is too weak
The forcees of night are now growing stronger
Searching for souuls for men blind with greed
Three witchees stand in a circle of evil
Tongues speaking words old and unknown
Call for a demon to serve in their daark spell
Fulfill what they owe to get what men own
I'll be king, I want the power, I will change my fate
Magic's on my side foreveer, so the witches say
Time is right to gane the throne, I'll take my brother down
I'll be king to rule the land, yes I'll take the crown
[Chorus:]
I've lost my soul
I've lost control
To the circle of witches
My life is black
There's no way back
From the circle of witches
circle of witches
circle of witches
circle of witches - never again
Lie in wait, prepared to fight, soon the king must come
Allied with the darkest powers, murder will be done
Loyal soldiers, stand for battle, bliinded are their eyes
Witchcraft takes away their sight, as we take their lives
I look at myself, a mirror of darkness
My mind it is drowned, a dark flood of hate
I owe too much to the powerrs of evil
I know I'm damned, sealed is my fate
For the gloom og gold and glory, I have sold my soul
Blackened aree the sunny days, the dark side takes control
Hell awaits as nightmares haunt me, demons in my head
Satan waits with patient joy, he'll greet me when I'm dead.A life under God
Blind, still walking
Mental murder
Deaf, still talking
Crime divine
Mind read, explored
All reason dead
Brainwashed, forlorn
Experience the sour
Taste of holy pain
Oppressed and forsaken
Religiously insane
Insane, insane, breed in chains
Religiously insane
Insane, insane, breed in chains
Insane, insane, insane, breed in chains"I gross so more soul I smell your terror and I hunger"
Roaming path of sleeping dead reaching for untied
Journey of the desperation let to reveal
Joy with bleeding seared peachy with reason laid just back fault
Something it back to up something its forward
Darkness hiding behind those of black path of clad
Darkness standing in arches of hell fire ream
Meddles creating an end pushed rhythm of the time
Meddles spilling the blood of the burning awn
Silent just to dark on in not re-passion mysterious chain
Higher in the darkest clouds and turning to feeling of the dark you've pray
Claws in life, nothing seams the dark
Again sworn everything to come is creedSacrifice,can you feel the hand
Of god oppose your will to die...
Your time has now come...
You are Satan's son,
The end of life is near, your death is clear
The time of life is short, you are now reborn
Time to die, hear the cries, damned souls
Returning from inside. You can't escape
Though you try, there's nothing left but to die
Your time has come you are Satan's son
You feel the hand of god oppose you will to die
Your life is now here your rebirth is clear
Time to die, hear the cries
Damned souls returning from insideMy will is invulnerable like air with the sound of my voice
the universe shrinks in a wrinkle of pain.
Listen to me. I will nourish your flesh with blood dew
Explore the labyrinth of memory and free yourself
from the hypertrophy of remembrance.
I want to awake from paralysis the icons buried
in the absence and disharmony so that they can
enjoy again an instant of contemplation
and penetrate the realms of senses.
This is the final call, the time of rebirth and catharsis
the quietness after the storm
Univocal language of phrases ancient like music
Relish the essence of this immaterial fluid
Principle of aggregation and disgregation,
everywhere and nowhere
Forsake the anguish and waver in the absolute freedom
Let stasis convert into motion
and let your essence strip of all lies.
Throw your dice and enjoy the chance
The moon could not appear again.Faceless coward - slithering - the depths a mind can take
Blackened heart - alerting masses - a plan - the world to shake
Now no one will ever be the same
How could we have ever known? No prediction to have known
Will and honour - now be shown!
Standing unified - the nations will collide
Vengeance will be swift - we pray for your demise
The city begins to shake - behold the blackened sky
Unsuspecting people watch - can't believe their eyes
Terror unfolds - who to despise
How could we have ever known? No prediction to have known
Will and honour - now be shown!
We never will forgive - interrupt the way we live
Teach your people how to hate - run and hide, but it's too late
Solo
There is no place to hide - in time we'll hunt you down
The coward flees for life - our nations are abound
We will not stop until you're found
Standing unified - the nations will collide
Vengeance will be swift - we pray for your demiseflawless your pure elitist cult looks so flawless now the concept of annihilation I'm a sinner without cause an aberration unbound blackness lays her wings on me the mirror lies but I stand still I hammer all the nails inside the burning chaos of my mind feel it flow feel it blow feel it rage inside your heart feel it turn feel it burn nothing's left to tear apart burn you see me burn you feel me burn beneath the rays of a colder sun burning ice and velvet rain (I know I have to die for) falling from the liar's den (get rid of all this sorrow) begging for the hands of rain (you know you have to die for) a venom leech is what I am (inside I feel so hollow) self-deceive your brain crawling in the corner of your brain impostor guess is what I am guess is what I've always been been so disgusted by this world yet I feel it crawling underneath you feed my wrath and heal my fury turn me to the beast I despise rain of glass nails of fear winds of hatred gather here cold emotions turn to dust all the shit you worship I distrust I can't have enough of burning hatred shape my wings in blood and anger I feel it flow and serves me right there's nothing left inside of meradiation plague, fallout rain laid earth waste,

you can't teach a corpse, how to fucking live
you can't know the hate, that drives the blood in them,
how can it hurt, when you can not feel
just close your eyes, a dream that's all too real,
let the dead fall in front of them,
carry out the sentence handed down,
all dead again, cause they never get far
and it's always on to them, cut down while they run,
terror eats the soul of every man,
cyber corpses need to kill to justify their plan,
human cattle fighting for a world they can't defend,
never-under-estimate, paralyzed hope in quick decline,

through ethnic laws, weed out the weak,
only their kind can live on, demons are inside of me,
disinformation leprosy, patriotic arrogance, eradicates intelligence,
soldiers are the children of the existential atom bomb,
products of a paranormal suicidal vision-quest,

I hope to see the light again, someone help me
I need your hands to reach out for me, I'm descending
This tension is eating away at my dreams, dragging my casket
Oh, I'm blinded by conspiracy, so I question
Contradictions plague my mind, always guessing
I'm caught underneath all the agony, I'm descending
This tension is eating away at my dreams, dragging my casket
Digging my grave, who's going to save me?
Burnt by the fire, stole my desire
Holding me down, who's going to save me?
Embracing my pain, no one will save me
I'm dragging my casket down
Shovel the earth upon my dreams
Nothing is ever what it seems
Diluted illusions reality
Buried ambitions, they've diedI have to forget, push things from my head
I've got to leave that past of blood and tears
My brain injected, information infected
I'm absorbed lost in my storm
I've got to stop and clear my conscience
I've got to look for another direction
My arms out stretched, my hands touch nothing
I'm absorbed by the fog of my lies
You're out there somewhere
Outside getting on with life
I'm in here nowhere
Inside looking for a key
So what can I do to find myself
Which way is right, which way is left
Direction undiscovered, my body exhausted
I'm absorbed totally confused[instrumental]What the thrush toils at, the partridge asks for
The hapless one takes, the troubled one steals
Puts upon a spade, sets on a runner
Hides under a door, shields with a bath whisk
The farmer hammers and tempers his spears
Marries off his sons
Hands out his daughters
In boots clogged with clay in fancy mittens
The sea swell rumbles and the wind it blows
And the king hears it from five miles away
From six directions, from seven back woods
From eight heaths away the wind still blows
The farmer hammers and tempers his spears
Marries off his sons
Hands out his daughters
In boots clogged with clay in fancy mittens
Song of the troubled oneWhy so many obstacles on my way.
Why these creatures
Whirl `round on me?
I want to know who do they obey.
Which occult strength manages them?
I'm living in darkness
Far from this world
I'm living in my dreams
My own legend
Their infernal sound
Leads me to sink into folly
How to overcome this fear
Which paralyzes me?
Let me dream of a real existence
Far from this world
Of suffering and anxiety...
I'm living in darkness
I'm seeking the truth
Hess living in my brain
The fallen angel
Let me dive into the seeking serenity
Let me live my own legend
Find the answers
Which are eluding me
Understand the meaning
Of my non existence
Let me dream of a real existence...
I'm living in darkness
I'm fighting for freedom
I'm living in my dreams
My own legend
No doubt. Beyond this zone of terror
Will find all the answers
No doubt. The try to stop me
But Ill fight. Cause even if the price
Of the knowledge consists of suffering
Even if the path to the eternal passes
In transit to hell
Ill go to the end
To the end of my dreamsThe seductress that flatters with her tongue
Don't be lead astray by her deceit
Nany are the victims she's cast down
All her slain are a might host
Her house is the way to hell
Descending to the chambers of death
Time and time and time again
Men are slaves to her
Sexual immorality
Leaving out the purity
It's not the way God intended it to be
Repentance is essential here
So we must practice what we preach
Fornicators shall have their part
Only hypocrites do the opposite of what they teach
You've been paid for
At a price
You've been bought by blood
the precious blood of Christ
You've been bought by blood
All her slain are mighty host
Her house is the way to Hell
Descending to the chambers of death
You've been paid for
At a price
You've been bought by blood
The precious blood of Christ
You've been bought by blood[Instrumental]I'm breaking static, I'm changing my frequency
If I don't speak out, then no one's listening
But I won't live in vain, in vain
We stand on the edge wondering, wondering
If I take one step will I live, will I sink?
We're dying for more every day, every day
So count down from ten and jump when I say
Zero, zero
We're breaking static, just radio frequencies
If we don't speak out, then there's no one listening
Is anyone listening to me?
We stand on the edge wondering, wondering
If I take one step will I live, will I sink?
We're dying for more every day, every day
So count down from ten and jump when I say
We won't hesitate
We won't close our eyes
We won't turn away
We're taking back our lives
We won't hesitate
We won't close our eyes
We won't turn away
We're taking back our lives for the first time
For the first time (we won't hesitate)
We won't close our eyes
We won't turn away
We stand on the edge wondering, wondering
If I take one step will I live, will I sink?
We're dying for more every day, every day
So count down from ten and jump when I say
Zero, zero, zero, zeroAnd you stare at me in your Jesus Christ pose
Arms held out like you've been carrying a load
And you swear to me you don't want to be my slave
But you're staring at me like I need to be saved
In your Jesus Christ pose
Arms held out
In your Jesus Christ pose
Thorns and shroud like it's the coming of the Lord
And I swear to you that I would never feed you pain
But you're staring at me like I'm driving the nails
In your Jesus Christ pose
And you stare at me
In your Jesus Christ pose
Arms held out like it's the coming of the Lord
And would it pay you more to walk on water
Than to wear a crown of thorns
It wouldn't pain me more to bury you rich
Than to bury you poor
In your Jesus Christ poseExisting in my mind
Thoughts I can't control
Altered state of being
Confusion takes its toll
The mental struggle
Of mind and body are one
Oblivious to the moment
When peace of mind sets in
Is it real is it a dream
Can't open my eyes I cannot scream
A parasite dwelling inside my head
Devouring my mind life hanging from a thread
Is there another inside of me, deep within my mind
Without a trace of life blood I see but I am blind
This can't be reality
Fighting for my sanity
Though I try I can't break free
From this thing controlling me
Subconscious-The war inside my head
Subconscious-Twisting into form
Subconscious-Prisoner of pain
Subconscious-The war rages ever onCould a word hold power over mind and body
when it relates to the soul?
long tragedies on battle fields
children tortured, one million kills
under the flag of our God
[Chorus]
Desires turn to blood
as lust claims our souls,
with the simplest lie of all:
to be chosen by some God
Centuries of slander
masked with opium slumbers
aimed to control our essence
to breed and keep their hold with fearlament seeps from between
blood soaked lips
forgiveness for myself never
seemed so distant
my heart still beats and longs
for your presence
(your) silent cries resonate in
my head
a life full of beauty taken within
the first few beats
how can I give you anything
when everything is already gone
forever this scar will burn me like fire
go now without summer breezes
and playgrounds
may grace guide you with
wings and halo
trembling as your sacrifice cuts
through me
could I ever comprehend the beauty
that could have been
life in its most perfect form
untainted by the ways of this world
pure and dependent, cries leave me
with a permanent echo
for what you have lost Andrew will be
an inspiration that lasts a lifetime
what has been taken from you can
never be replaced
but what you have given me can never
be taken
see you in heavenErstes Kapitel
Erffnung. Ein Toter klopft rhrig an die Decke seines eichenen Totenschreins. Wie wild pocht der Leichnam auf die Truhe ein - zuerst mit einem alten Regenschirm, spter mit dem Holzwanst seiner zinnoberroten Marionette, die man ihm vor Jahren in die hinabgesenkte Truhe legte, um einen geselligen Tod zu wappnen. Der Tote streckt sein starres Hndchen aus dem Erdhgel, der ber der Kiste zu einem leidigen Hufchen zusammenfiel und bei schlechter Witterung das kalte Regenwasser in den Sarg sickern lie. Es scheint, als wrde sich Leben breit machen in dieser Totenstadt.
Klopfzeichen.
Violine.
WERKELMANN
Wir schlagen - klopf-klopf - bse ein
auf diese kalte Truhe.
Ein Toter will leibhaftig sein
und gibt partout nicht Ruhe.
Er streckt das kalte Hndchen dann
aus einem Totenhgel.
Wir klopfen, klopfen laut und bang!
Wer stirbt, dem wachsen Flgel.
Der Tote schleppt sein Beinchen jetzt
auf Teufels schwarzen Acker.
In einem Kleidchen abgewetzt
tanzt der Tote schicker-schacker.
Er spannt ein schwarzes Schirmchen auf
und huscht - HUSCH HUSCH - zum Totenpfuhl.
Ein Glckchen klingelt - Toter lauf!
- und bringt den Jud' in Teufels Pool.
August? August? August!
Ich seh' ein Trumm mit Gulen dran...
Die Klepper fahren Geisterbahn.
Die Schimmel gehen, kein Gaul soll stehen.
Der Kezman lsst die Gule drehen!
Die Pferdchen drehn' sich ohne Ziel!
Ein Toter fhrt gern Ringelspiel!Las aguas turbias
suben esta vez.
Brota el agua del subsuelo
pudriendose las races.
Y el pueblo porteo se aflige
si no para de llover.
Se saturan de evacuados
tinglados grises.
Pues los cauces entubados
no se dejan contener.
Y pronto todo est inundado,
menos que maana
y mas que siempre.
De llegar la sudestada
arrimando al ro.
Junto a la tormenta brava,
el final se har evidente.
Sobrevivir el valiente,
huirn los ricos.
Antes de que los lavabos
regurgiten defecciones.
S que dirn que estoy errado.
Que es imposible
que no puede suceder.
Que la antigua prediccin
est cumpliendose.
Las aguas turbias.

Just you wait till we learn.
Just you wait till we know.
Just you wait till we know.
"I will wait to find out.
I swear I hope I'm wrong.
I hope the truth is warm.
I want to come in from the cold"
So you think you figured it out?
So you think one day a week will do?
So you think your will is free and clear?
So you think you think.
What can you say you truly know
when so much has be covered
and re-covered with dust?
The war for men's minds only blinds us from
what's in front of our eyes.
But we're all experts now.
We all know the world over and over again.
We've all watched too much TV to not know
what we stand for.[instrumental]Shadows amongst the cloudburst
Maelstorm returns
A darkened shroud begins descent
Wasted man secured
As pulses fade
Seventh offensive laid down
Project D.O.4
Hearoes made dishonoured ground
Artillery now silent
Fires forever silent
Chlorine burnt the throat
Of all blood agent kills
Gradients of syndrome
Clouds of war enraged
The day is lost, the night has won
All ends at point blank range
Maximum casualties
The pointless slaughter
Wiped out generations
Man, en masse destroyer
Final road to glory
Surrendered life eternally
No survivors
Now proclsaim the call for victoryOn a battlefield up north
Tons of steel united in bloodshed
Sombre men of invisible might
The fallen snow covers
All the wounds of the earth
Slaves of restriction
Remains this skeleton earth
The dust kills all sound
We're sucked into a black hole
The eyes that watched
From the top of the hill
The eyes that capture human guilt
A stiff vulture claw shows the way
To a land of mist
To a land of war
Night of torment
Fever, Flames and Hell
In the cold grip of ArmageddonThere are signs on the ring
Which make me feel so down
There's one to enslave all rings
To find them all in time
And drive them into darkness
Forever they'll be bound
Three for the Kings
Of the elves high in light
Nine to the mortal
Which cry
Slow down and I sail on the river
Slow down and I walk to the hill
And there's no way out
Mordor
Dark land under Sauron's spell
Threatened a long time
Threatened a long time
Seven rings to the gnomes
In their halls made of stone
Into the valley
I feel down
One ring for the dark lord's hand
Sitting on his throne
In the land so dark
Where I've to go
Slow down and I sail on the river
Slow down and I walk to the hill
Lord of the ringsLet's fuck 'til the sun goes up
Because we haven't got long but we've got enough
A night to remember, a day to forget
(Don't stop 'til we pirouette)
I'm no saint, you're no martyr
One more night playing heart pinata
How do you say "goodbye"...
How do you say "goodbye" when you've hardly said "hello"?
The only way we know, the only way we know
The only way we know, the only way we know
How do you say "goodbye" when you've hardly said "hello"?
Let's fuck! Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Let's fuck 'til our hearts give up
It won't be long!
A night to remember, a day to forget
If our eyes were diamonds we'd be rich
Your voice makes my heart skip beats
So keep quiet before it quits on me
Your voice makes my heart skip beats
So keep quiet before it flat lines
Before it flat lines
I'm dead, tell them all we're dead
We can hold the wake right here in this bed
Sunk into you tangled in sheets
Buried in blankets, six foot deep again
Kick it!
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Let's fuck 'til the sun goes up
Because we haven't got long but we've got enough
A night to remember, a day to forget
(Don't stop 'til we pirouette)
I'm no saint, you're no martyr
One more night playing heart pinata
How do you say "goodbye"...
How do you say "goodbye" when you've hardly said "hello"?
How do you say "goodbye" when you've hardly said "hello"?
Oh!
We're young and in love, heart attacks waiting to happen
So come a little closer, tell me it's all in our heads

Lots of things in life that I like but I hate you
Seems you only bitch and moan
When there's other things to do you waste my time
Why don't you leave me alone?
The world would be a better place if you were dead
Place the gun up to your head
[Chorus:]
You can't help the fact that you're so stupid
Every word you say is utter crap
Brainless, senseless, thoughtless common idiot
Why don't you just shut your trap?
Better stay away from me cause I'm not safe
Might reach out and grab your neck
Seems you just don't know, seems you don't understand
You had better take control
Watch your every move, you better watch your step
Someone buries you alive
[Chorus]
Brainless, senseless, thoughtless common idiot
Why don't you just shut your trap?
Right now![Instrumental]...It was not long ago when I had fallen from this mortal world,
lost in dream flight to pierce the horizon as a bird...
Is this life the pillor I must bear?
To grow in this wretched world?
...With hate each day I burn...
The birds above, they ride the winds
And from each piercing talon dangles a soul
The stone awaits my fall
Upon a grave I dug myself
The birds sing their requiems
Please lend me your wisdom to fly above the heavens,
Across seas of gold, to my land of frostbitten, ageless night
Let me dig my own grave
Let me, oh precious noose of mine
You are my mother, whose womb around my neck
Grants me a world of cold nihility
An endless winter night
A bitter, black frozen hell
For me
Forever!
Is this the pillor I must bear?
To die on this fucking world?
...With hate I die and burn...
The birds above, they caress the winds
They lend me the wisdom to fly...
[Written by J. Haughm ('97)]I cant belive, whats become of me
Not the way i want to be
I told myself i would never do that
I warned myself i was headed for this
And sometimes i want to end it all.
I can't pretend as i watch it die
I remember what this used to be
Do you remember what this means
This is dragging me down: I'm falling far
Before my eyes, i watch it fall apart
This falls apart.
I cant beleive whats come of meGet up
And get your grandma outta here
Pick up
Old Jim is workin' hard this year
And baby
Do the things he says to do
Baby, if you're feeling good
And baby if you're feeling nice
You know your man is workin' hard
He's worth a deuce
Honey
Don't put your man behind his years
And baby
Stop cryin' all your tears
Baby
Do the things he says to do
Do it
Baby, if you're feeling good
And baby if you're feeling nice
You know your man is workin' hard
He's worth a deuceCome to the edge of reason
Embrace the sun in place of night
Come to your senses sometime
Never witness an understanding
Before the dawn surrenders light
Damn the dawn for turning my world red
Before too long my perfect night is over
Damn the dawn tomorrow is calling again
Before too long
Enter the realms of madness
Open the doors and close your eyes
Entertain thoughts of endless wonder
Call for the visionary
Call for the one who reads the skies
Damn the dawn it takes the deepest breath away
Before too long another night is over
Damn the dawn turn your world
Your own sweet way before too long
Day breaker, are you the silent sinner?
Day breaker, so unpredictable
Day breaker, live on and on forever
Day breaker, give up your forgiven dawn
You are the breaker of my promises
Do you have something I can keep?
You are the keeper of my yesterdays
Give me something that I needTrapped in the Claws of Time

A cruel land's fallen son
Pleading to the skies above
Forgive me please for what I've done
The only truth is death they claim
I chose to gift that lie
Force feeding truth to so many
My eyes numb as I watched them die
[Chorus]
Train me, then blame me
I bought into this game
Mold me, then scold me
I'll never be the same
If only you could see me now
I broke a dark one-sided twisted vow
You take a poor, broke, lost, and stolen soul
And simply throw his world away
Believe me when I tell you now
They mold the truth, and turn it upside down
It took me years to see, and comes this far
And still I feel so lost today
Will anybody save me now
Exposed I stand alone
A prisoner in my own body
No place really feels like home
I've grown to see the wrong I've done
And I cannot shake this pain
So I close my eyes, and let it go
With one final breath of shame
[Chorus]
Rain down on me
And wash this pain away
Rain down on me
And wash this pain awayFrom the depths of depression subsiding below
To the center of your pain as all hatred grows
You swear to avenge
Destroy self control
Ideas self destruct
Your warmth turns cold
Revenge so sweet
Kill this beast
I lost respect for your beliefs
Your soltion is no solution
I am this beast
You say you're blind
You see
You can't believe reality
Corrupt regenerate disease
Lost in ignorance
Their pain is seen
Revenge they'll pay
You're as guilty as they.Being submerged under the dreams
In an other dimension
The time loses it's essence
The mind's flying free
The memories that have been
Living in the deep
Now they're rising to the surface
The sounds are embracing me
They're calling me before the white light
The other side is summoning me
Its door is open
The world of eternity is waiting for me
The other side is summoning me
An other beautiful world
Unknown but known
You're stepped out of the present
Your soul's having a rest
This strange calmness
Goes with you on your wayNo, I just refuse to believe my eyes
In front of me something I can't recognize
You stood beside me all my life
The heart machines are ticking
I can hear the life support pumping
The line between life and death
Doesn't become any clearer than this
Cover with an oxygen mask
These words will be his last
With the energy he's got left
He turns to me and says
I can not stand by you
Till the end of the world
Like I said I would do
No, I wont be able to
Help you carry the weight
Of the world my time has come
Silent as a butterfly
I'll be flying beside you
Watching above you
Silent as a butterfly
All of a sudden I've lost my strength
Isn't it scary how things can change
It made an instant just like that
Whenever I have questions
You always have the answers
You told me about life and the
Importance of being yourself
What you are, you value honesty
How not to lose grip of reality
With both your feet on the ground
I can not stand by you
Till the end of the world
Like I said I would do
No, I wont be able to
Help you carry the weight
Of the world my time has come
Silent as a butterfly
I'll be flying beside you
Watching above you
Silent as a butterfly.
You weren't supposed to see
Me like this and I'm sorry
I would say it's not true
But I will see you soon
Far away
I can not stand by you
Till the end of the world
Like I said I would do
No, I wont be able to
Help you carry the weight
Of the world my time has come
Silent as a butterfly
I'll be flying beside you
Watching above you
Silent as a butterfly.No good will ever grow in me
For hate and anger is all i feel
Trapped in your lies for so many times,
now feel my hatred and my burning eyes
I want to see your every single tear
As i color your life pale and dark
I will open the door for you to the land of despair
And guide you through tha path of thousand mourning stars
I want to end it here...(blood will follow blood)
I want to end it all...(blood will follow blood)
I want you to see...(blood will follow blood)
That i will never fall...(blood will follow blood)
Blood will follow blood!
I know what you feel in your heart
For i'm the disease in your blood
Moments of terror will come your way
And crush your soul and end your days
Now embrace my rage and feel the flames burning inside.
As i'm crawling through your veins
Like razorblade tearing you apart
I am your pain
No good will ever...
There's a cruel poembook, an engraving in your mind.
And every time you'll turn me one more page.
I will strike through your eyes like a thunder from the sky.
And show you all the might of my rage.Hey!
They walk over you
As if you weren't there
Equality does not exist
In our cold life since
They don't know who you are
They don't care
They don't see that we are
Everywhere
Nation under fire
And they just sit back
They don't seem to realize
That we will fight back
They don't know who you are
They don't care
They don't see that we are
Everywhere
Out of sight
Out of mind
Out of sight
Out of mind
They walk all over you.
Look into their eyes.
Make them see their foes.
Thieves are in town, feed your world
Destruct their fate to blow.
They don't know who you are.
They don't care.
They don't see that we are
Everywhere.
Out of sight.
Out of sight.
Out of mind.
Out of mind.
Out of sight.
Out of sight.
Out of mind.
Out of mind.
Out of sight.
Out of sight.
Out of mind.
Out of mind.Battle weary Saxons fight the fight to grip the north
Studded armoured warriors defy this mighty force
On the hill the men all raise their swords up to the sky
An axe strikes the shields of steel, another victim dies
They're coming after you run for your life
Warriors of hell fight the fight
They're coming after you run for your life
Saxons of the Fire ride tonight
Running 'cross the plains of fire scorched blazing steel
The axe falls on another man screaming through the fields
The mighty sword is seeking men & slicing to the bone
You never can sstain the force to drive these Saxons on
They're coming after you run for your life
Warriors of hell fight the fight
They're coming after you run for your life
Saxons of the Fire ride... tonight
They're coming out of the sunset fire, too many to hold back
"Draw your sword you dreaded fool you're under our attack"
Heathen men of distant lands were forced under command
Blood & sweat fall to the earth, the Saxons make a stand
Many men took many slaves on this bloody day
Warriors & savages seeking out their prey
Metal hitting metal in this war for noman's land
Blood & sweat fall to the earth, the Saxons make a stand
The battles over, villages are burning to the ground
The many men who've went to war are lost but never found
Winners are rewarded well, boasting of their scars
Turn toward the blazing sun to quest the land of far
They're coming after you run for your life
Warriors of hell fight the fight
They're coming after you run for your life
Saxons of the Fire riding... tonightIn the dead of the night
There's something calling to me
I can see all these visions
Of insanity, insanity
There's no way to control it
Feel adrenaline rise
All these things that I see
What are they telling me, telling me?
Will they set me free set me free?
Yes I've got to believe got to believe
It's unreal
Because I'm back in the circle
The circle tonight
All around me the faces
Reflect in my mind
I turned the page
Now I'm back in the circle
Back in the circle again
As I walk through the shadows
Filled with uncertainty
I get lost in this moment
Of insanity, insanity
I have tried to make sense
Of the things that I see
I follow the light
'Cause it's my destiny, destiny
Will it set me free set me free?
And I've got to believe got to believe
It's unreal
Because I'm back in the circle
The circle tonight
All around me the faces
Reflect in my mind
I turned the page
Now I'm back in the circle
Back in the circle again
I've got things going on inside my head
Seems so long I've been gone this road has led
To everywhere
I'll never be the same at all
Because I'm back in the circle
The circle tonight
All around me the faces
Reflect in my mind
I turned the page
Now I'm back in the circle
Back in the circle again
Caught in the circle
You got to believe got to believe
What you're hoping to see hoping to see
What you want to believe want to believe
Is what you want it to be want it to be
Yes you got to believe got to believe
What you're hoping to see hoping to see
What you want to believe want to believe
Is what you want it to be want it to beMy world has changed
The houses shook
Someone ordered a tornado
I can't find the coffee, no!
I need to pull myself out!
Out, out of this crisis
Finally stand on my own two feet
I gotta wash my silly snout
I'm only poor metal player
I got no cash to visit psycho doc
My God has changed his phone
number
I feel like crazy fuck
Cofused and shaken
I need to gather my thoughts
It's so good I have those
Damn cigarettesCan you write words forever and never bleed onto this page? Can you scream out forever and never mean a word you say? The world has stopped dead right here but you haven't missed a beat. You smile like a criminal at the halo by your feet. You mouth the words that you should, but you never feel their sting. An open wound. It sells so well. My world has crumbled here, but you don't look away. Do you still need the proof? Can't you see it in my face? You mouth the words that you should, but you never feel their sting. Everyone looks up to you now and you must be so very proud. Everyone looks up to you now. Martyr of the crowd. When she was alive did you even know theA balm in your hands, it has begun to hide.
Once more, (left as) the one awake, a script knotted in a hand.
Absent and building, and looming in the air
hung and thin between (sparks of sunlight).
The dark and the dark, all the hours.
Numbers and worlds well-tuned.
Not all thing are well wound - there are joys.
But I am bound, to follow you.[Lyrics: Albert Bell / Music: Forsaken]
This is my body; this is my blood
From these dying whispers of a dying life
I weave the Redeemer's darkest dream,
A wish to conceal the promise of fate
Shall I ever escape what is deemed?
Father, spare me from the harshness of reality
Shall a crown of thorns be my cruel destiny?
[Chorus]
A pilgrimage through the dawn of creation
A blessed sojourn for the meaning of salvation
I gaze through the face of death
For they shall know me - the Redeemer
They say I hold the key of the eternal presence
A prophet that defies the world's futile essence
I am the offering that mankind shall forever bequeath
A karmic fortune that cannot ever be retrieved
The words of wisdom shall be forged
From the bones of my weakened body
I long to rebuke the blood spilled through
The ages of humanity's story
Father forgive them,
For they do not know what they are doing
My God why have you forsaken Me?
Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit
[Chorus]
A pilgrimage through the dawn of creation
A blessed sojourn for the meaning of salvation
I gaze through the face of death
For they shall know me - the RedeemerTake another look at yourself
tell me what do you see x2
yours souls reflection
is it what it used to be
Take another look at yourself
tell me what do you see
answers revolve around our heads
like figures of our imagination
measures are taken to purge pleasure and take life in as pain
this is bigger than you and me x2
alarms as you wake from his dream
human fellowship is sacred
this is bigger than you and me
Take another look at yourself and
tell me what do you see x2
yours souls reflection
is it what it used to be
Take another look at yourself and
tell me what do you see
as we move along waiting here
our days repeat and increase
your default setting
runs your life secretly
which direction are you heading
escape the pressure
this is bigger than you and me
alarms as you wake from his dream
human fellowship is sacred
cuz this is bigger than you and me
alarms as you wake from his dream
human fellowship is sacred
cuz this is bigger than you and me
separate yourself from the machine
embrace your own identity x2
escape the pressure
Take another look at yourself and
tell me what do you see x2

is it what it used to be
Take another look at yourself and
tell me what do you see

Enjoy Metal fans:
@mtaboraDarkness flees the rising sun
The village lies ahead
It will wake to a new day soon
Soon they'll all be dead
We came in cover of moonless night
Fifty men at arms
Now at first morning light
The church bell sounds the alarm
Sacrifice to Gods of old
Bleed them of their lives
Fresh blood on our swords
Gods of war arise
Sacrifice to Gods of old
Bleed them of their lives
Fresh blood on our swords
Gods of war arise
Hear the tortured screams
Shattering the air
They awake from soothing dreams
Into their worst nightmare
Fire sweeps their homes
They feel the dragon's breath
Consuming and destructive flames
Agonizing death
Some seek shelter in the church
A refuge for those with faith
But we know how to smoke them out
A pyre will be raised
But those who choose to stand and fight
Will die with dignity
For the unfortunate few who survived
Waits a life in slavery
The day draws to a end
The night comes dark and cold
We return to our ships
With silver, slaves and gold
We gave them agony
As they fell and died
The Gods have granted victory
For our sacrifice
The day draws to a end
The night comes dark and cold
We return to our ships
With silver, slaves and gold
We gave them agony
As they fell and died
The Gods have granted victory
For our sacrificeFirst of all you will eat all the bodies
No matter they pray for freedom they'll kill you
Forward you crush those going backwards
The wolves are now your lords
Voracious flames upon the earth
Second step you eat all the creation
Swallow the trees, the lakes and all the valleys
Crush the moon and drink the river flowing
Deeper than ocean blue
Burning all that, burning all that
They teach you how to conquer and rule the world
The towers that you built so strong, no man can touch
They tell you how to find and raise the fears
And let them grow inside of your heart, they need no walls
Is there a chance you face the void inside?
Winds of doom will blow your pride away
Behold the bright lights coming down on time
Before these altars black made for your sacrifice
You take for granted what's been there for ages
Inside the womb the new blood gets ready to fight
The buildings of our fathers
Crumbling in dark vibrations
Wolf down the one that made us all
No hope, you wolf down the earthSe despierta fri en la noche, el sudor cae por su piel
Sabes que todo es mentira tu vida es pura ficcin
Esto es un callejn pero
Nunca, no digas nunca
Que no, que no podras salir
Seguro que hoy la encontraras, en ella crees ver la verdad
Abre tus ojos hermano, tienes que sentir
Ganas de vivir
Nunca, no digas nunca
Que no, que no podras salirI see the light out of you
I see the day coming in
When I know it is true
I ain't walkin' away
How many times can I be
The face within your dream?
I don't care what I see
I'll be there if you scream
I swear you lost your life
It comes disguised as blue rays
The way you stare out at me
Makes my heartbeat decrease
I'm stuck in something
I'll never be free
I can't move someone
Please help me
I drove a million miles
All the rooms were gray
I don't want to be nice
I think, it's clever to swear
I wouldn't seek your advice
But I would look
I told you not to be so cute
Around the block
What can I do?
But be impressed against the clock
I'm stuck in something
I'll never be free
I can't move someone
Please help me
I see the light out of you
I see the day coming in
When I know it is true
I ain't walkin' away
How many times can I be
The face within your dream?
I told you not to be so cute
Around the block
What can I do?
But be impressed against the clockspeak the truth don't you dare lie to me
I've seen it all before you disagree
the way you always attack all the things that you say
the way your turn your back and then you walk away
shut your mouth and open up your eyes
you better take your time and try to realize
that no one's free from sin and when I look at you
I scream within WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU
you raise yourself up to a higher degree and look down in disgust at our misery
you're no better than your enemy
but it's easy to hate what you just can't be
don't deny the fact that you're a mortal man
you can't escape from death when it's close at hand
don't sit upon a pedestal and raise your voice
if you're to deaf to listen to the peoples
choice
truth tell me the truh the truth motherfucker
tell me the truth tell me the truth tell me the truth
the truth you sucker
you play us out and you take us all for fools
but I never understood who even made the rules
I'll make my stand against supermacy
'cause hypocritical goverments threaten me
I know you ain't blind and I know you're aware
but your ego's to big for you to even care
the doors are wide open but your eyes are closed
you're unable to look any further than your nose
you open your mouth and all I hear is lies
you keep spreading your message that I despite
because the game you're playing is so easy to see
it's just another repeat of our history
you talk about peace it's a very strong word
it's always being said but it's never been heard
hi-tec weapons are here to reasure it
but I've never seen a time when they've done a shit for it
Truth.....
kick it to me now 'cause I just can't figure
take a small mistake and make a small one bigger
equality's a word have you ever even heard it
I guess not and you don't deserve it
turning your backs on the problems that surface
I get a feeling that you're doing it on purpose
your mide is SLIME so please resign
you can't control your own life don't try to tule mine
Truth.....It's Already Wednesday
Yesterday I painted our bathroom in all sorts of colors
And the day before I slept in, before I went shopping
And I cooked our meal, seemed to forget the dishes
And I saw a little TV and went to bed...
Now it's already Wednesday - half the week is gone
Yet another Wednesday of things I haven't done
The week flies by like an aeroplane, that's got no destination
And now it's already Wednesday - How'd three days get wasted?!?
And today I went to an interview for a boring job
And the lady there was boring too - I started to fade away
Yet I smiled and begged, which took time and energy
Though she pissed me off - I could really, really use the money ...
Now it's already Wednesday - half the week is gone
Yes another Wednesday of things I haven't done
The week flies by like an aeroplane, that's got no destination
And now it's already Wednesday - How'd three days get wasted?!?
It's already Wednesday yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah - It's already Wednesday
I'll make a list of things to do Ã¢?? (and) get as much as I can
Cross off what's done - carry the rest to the next day
John and Poul had "eight days a week" - maybe I could borrow one
Now cause it's already Wednesday - half the week is gone
Yet another Wednesday of things I haven't done
The week flies by like an aeroplane, that's got no destination
And now it's already Wednesday - How'd three days get wasted?!?
It's already Wednesday yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah - It's already Wednesday
It's already Wednesday yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah - It's already WednesdayI'm in mood for breaking some rules
I'm in shape for beating my ghosts
I will bend but never will break
living in the maximum level of pain
Part of me, part of my soul
will never cry, never let go
And the dark is now descending
my inner strength is bending
this torture's everlasting
and part of my soul is torn apart
Trying to appease this sense of hate
this monkey on my back is tough to beat
friends now help me to find my way
this dishonour is my bundle to bring
Part of me, part of my soul
will never cry, never let goIn the night
In the circle of death
They congregate to hold a feast
There lies a body in the center of the ring
Each human soon becomes a beast
They sing the song to glorify the dead
They chant, the chant eternal life
The master sails as he lifts the gleaming blade
The sound of flesh sliced by the knife
Men without anguish
Men without fear
Men chosen to ride the earth
Evil confrontation nears
These mindless sinners
Sit there without
Greed, not even grief
The final incision
Having now been complete

[Lyrics: O. Alexander]
My time has come to enter beyond
The realm of the lifeless
Dawn of grey take my soul away
Like autumn leaves that fall from trees
And voices of a winter breeze
These voices calling unto me
To enter the eternal drift
For I must depart this tragidy my life
I must end this misery. . . Forever
Tears of agony
Fall from above
I gaze into the stars
Is she in the heavens?
Mother earth give birth to death
Love is the seed of life
Hate is the tree of death
It is now this tree stands tall
I kneel beside her grave
And cry for her return
Roses fall to the ground
But her soul still remains
We shall unite in eternity
Nothing can keep us apart
Blood pours of thy flesh
For you I take my own life
I watch myself bleed
A lake of sadness becomes dry
As I descend into thy grave. . .
Tears of agony
Fall from above
I gaze into the stars
Is she in the heavens?
I visit her lonely grave
Lust for her I crave
Once so beautiful
Now she's rotted fleshThoughts spawn as quick as they waste.
Forge disoriented futures.
Cutting in and out, floating in and out.
I'm about to chance a great deal of my past.
I'm about to chance a great deal of my future.
Why does this decision turn its back on me?
I'm not the only one risking it all.
This must be some sick joke that I played on myself.
This must be some sick self that I joked on my play.
This is where the ghosts play.
This is where the ghosts play dead.
This is where the ghosts play dead wrong.
Patience runs thinner and thinner.
When will I realize I'm floating in space unattached from your life?
Did I belong there in the first place?
Distance seems to go on forever.
When will I realize I'm floating in space unattached from your life?
How long will this go on?
Please cleanse my soul.
Cleanse my corrupt soul.
I threw it all away so I could learn what it's like to waste all of our time.
Did time even exist?
For all its worth, we had a great run at it and I found out a lot about myself.
I found out a lot about living.
I will never forget every time.
I will never forget every time that I made you smile.
I will never forget every time that I made you cry.
I'm so sorry.
For this, I will repent.
Next time, I'll sacrifice.
I was not the right one.Won't You take a ride with me today
into another world we leave to stay
in secret rendez-vous within Your mind
tomorrow is denied and left behind
"Come with me and I will show You
something that You never seen before..."
Look into the mirrors and You'll see
things that are and why they're meant to be
sugar blossoms under silver trees
won't You take my hand and follow me?
Rivers made of honey floating by
underneath a shiny golden sky
life can be so easy, can't You see?
If You just take my hand and follow meI'm awake so
You better feed me now
I won't slow down
Once we have left this town
Rhymes and riddles
I'm still sleepy so
You must hurry
Please take your seats
You'll stay with me
Be with me
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
No one really knows the pain I'm going through
My final ride is almost done
The world has moved on now it's time to go
My final ride is almost done
Come lift my spirit up, I'm Blaine!
Come lift my spirit up, I'm Blaine!
I am nothing
But at train and
I assume that you don't like me
I'm insane but
Not yet crazy
I will never let you go
Enjoy the ride you'll stay with me
Stay with me
I'll stay with you
I'll stay with you
No one really knows the pain I'm going through
My final ride is almost done
The world has moved on now it's time to go
My final ride is almost done
Come lift my spirit up, I'm Blaine!
Come lift my spirit up, I'm Blaine!
I am the one I am the one
The godlike terror train
The superior, artificial brain
Feel free to call me Blaine
I will roll on
Riddle de-dumb, I'm best
Try me, try me,
I'll never fail that test
Blue's for girls and
Pink's for me
Cause
I'm the mono
Don't even dare to mess with me
No one really knows the pain I'm going through
My hate will last forevermore
The world has moved on now it's time to go
My hate will last forevermore
Come lift my spirit up, I'm Blaine!
Come lift my spirit up, I'm Blaine!
Beneath the demon moonImprisoned behind the wire, the doomed await their end.
Tangled corpses fill the pits, starved, shot, or poisoned.
To the horrors the world turns away from the suffering in apathy.
A blind eye to the victim's pain that they choose not to see.
Unless there's money to be made, unless territory is gained.
Imprisoned behind the wire, the doomed await.
Imprisoned behind the wire, the doomed await their end.
Tangled corpses fill the pits, starved, shot, or poisoned.
To the horrors the world turns away from the suffering in apathy.
A blind eye to the victim's pain that they choose not to see.
Unless there's money to be made, unless territory is gained.
Annihilation reigns.
Annihilation reigns, unless there's money to be made, unless territory is gained.
Unless there's money to be made, unless territory is gained.My thoughts have never been this cold in life
But never again I'll live and breathe amongst mortals
You've summoned me once
And my rise is your torment...
Your immortality was that close to you
As close as your death now
And now I watch you die my mortal slaves
I cause realities end...
Listen - a whispering, a crying
Some vague and pulsing imprint
Of long - ago suffering and death
Thousands will be perished in smoke and ashes
Imagine your lifetime back when you were born
It's lost...
All over the world your kind will be destroyed
This is my rebirth - don't cry...

A trial and a time[Instrumental]Taking off her "face".
I don't think we have met.
Sounds different than the beat
Your heart used to make.
Let's recollect all our thoughts,
We've never been so apart.
Maybe I could change.
Poison takes in vain.
At day, it feels a lot like love.
I know at night, it feels a lot like blood.

Panic darling.

She smiles in french but her arms are crossed. (Stand in line, turn and draw.)
She's changed her name to a heart. (Stand in line, turn and draw.)
That speaks but it does not beat. (Stand in line, turn and draw.)
All the flashes are blinding. (Stand in line, turn and draw.)
What started out as a hope for a different world. (Stand in line, turn and draw.)
It's now the sand that you're sinking in. (Stand in line, turn and draw.)
Once everyone has taken pieces of your design, (Stand in line, turn and draw.)
It's hard to recognize. (Stand in line, turn and draw.)
Rejoice.
It's a lions den,
It's a lions den,
It's a lions den,
it is all a lie.
I used to live the casual life like you, now my screen is crystal clear with a life like view and I've never been more ashamed, I wish that I could see the sunlight too. I should've covered up my eyes when that wish came true. Innocent and golden but its blocked in a display. They're saving up to take me home and write down what I say.
If I could change the way I spoke, then I would speak away the darkness of the past and guide myself away from all the cameras in my path.

Dein leben eine illusion - schenke mir deinen tod
Dein tod eine illusion - ich gebe dir dein leben

Die zeit der spiele ist verstrichen

Schau der wahrheit ins angesicht
Gib ihr dein lebenAnd still there comes another sunrise again
Clouded by the shades of yesterday
Still I feel naivet's hope for change
Memories endured memory remains
Peel the skin off this walking corpse
Fingernails scrape the skin from off my back
When the pain you feel is deliberate masochistic and integral
And all you know is you lived it fought it but you gave up hope
Never let your pain get in the way
You told me I'd feel no pain
You can always count on it
Not thinking about it
Will never take away
Take away my pain
Feel the things that make your heart turn gray
I wear mine proudly on my sleeve
When all you taste is your own blood filing up your mouth and throat
Thought it didn't taste good you refused to let it make you choke
I've become so much stronger since I've embraced my pain
You can always count on it
Can you live with it
Once you learn to live with it
Nothing can ever take it away
You can count on
You can depend on
You can take from
I'm so proud of my painIs this the river?
The river of the dreamer
who lost the reality
Death in your hands
and dust in your soul
are tinting your reality
She lost her destination
Her mind was the tempting thruth
Nunc et in hora
mortis nostrae
Ora pronovis sanguisque
Gratia plena
Is this the river?
The river of the dreamer
Her lost realityHer lost destiny
She lost her destination
Her mind was tempted with blood
Her lost reality
Beyond the dark
there is a place
where your cries
become dumbCruelty has a human heart
Jealousy a human face
Terror the human form divine
Secrcecy the human dress
I won't rest, I just can't
Unless you caress
Those visions in blue
I see blue...
Blue is how I feel
It's all that's real
I see blue...
Blue visions reveal
All that's real
Now listen to me...
When hurts so much
Is the greed of the human race
They won't believe me
See the war within me
I can't rest
Unless you caress
Those visions in blue
I know it's so hard
What I'm asking of you
Though you know it's so true
See my visions in blue
My visions in blueWe who never feared the moonlight
We who never fled from the rain
All the dying on this earth
All this pain since the birth
I see - they are creeping
They are dying
I feel their fear, the deadlight in their eyes
They are drowning in the angel's tears
Do you feel the eternal fire?
Let it burn, let it burn higher
All the dying on this earth
Let they die in your fire
The great inferno is coming
The end of mortality is near
All the dying on this earth
All this pain since the birth
I see - they are weeping
They are dying
Faces - speaking of decay
Creature - abandoned castaway(Instrumental)There you finally are, sister of the winds
And mother of my future deeds.
I'm in a battle I yet can't win,
So help me and tell me what you need.
Let's hear what burdens your royal heart bears,
Is it a burden of love or of hate?
Tell me what obstacle lies in your way
And I'll see what can be done to fate.
Twice they count, the unfaithful.
The infidels of the crown.
The dark one's pretenders
Trying to bring us down.
So let your magic be unleashed
And dispose of the false serpents of the night.
Poorly my powers will bite, I can not harm royal blood.
I am not able to assist you in your fight.
Witch, be gone then out of my sight
And take your feeble pitiable tricks and hide.
I shall be gone soon, though I give you one advice:
Take the highest caution your wisdom can provide.Should I never roam anymore,
I'm on journey, silently the moon whispers
Words I'll be recalling
Miles away lies the unknown fate
Through dwarven lands, where the shadows
Never fall in I rest and sing,
under an oak so old
[Bridge:]
Round and round we dance through
The willows Even though the day's turning dark very fast now
Rivers full of dreams flow endlessly
May the stars will stay and will laugh at our smallness
[Chorus:]
Into the woods, hear the silver firs' breathing
Where the forests end, it's the banquet of bards
So, that's the magic - whirling clouds and fair
Journey stories to find!
Someone's announcing the event of a new day's birth
Bards around a table sing "All is fair in love and war!"
Farewell, my friends, I leave
Wisdom's all I learned so far, words of ages
Heard the jester's voice, by the ruins he spoke
Atrocious truths under the cloak of lunacy
Learning from into the brushwood of K'horen
I lie and wait, chasing my dreams so far
[Bridge:]
[Chorus:]
[Solos: Aydan, Jarpen]
In a forgotten place of earth, a noble quest it has begun
Another banquet, another song, grace to you o forest deep
Gathering of dwarves, elves and men
Satchels and pouches they bring forth
The banquet of Bards
Now that we leave all the crickets stay silent
Along our quest, we'll see the world spin
Mystic places and yellowing leaves that won't fall
It's my own fate
Into the woods, hear the banquet of bards
The treasure I found now I share with youTime brings wisdom, time wrecks and destroys
Shadows come above the sky and takes one by one
Why did you forgot the things of it`s bringer
Although you rose on third day from the dead?
You promised us the new earth and sky
But you betrayed us over and over again, why?
You found us completely without a story
From the darkness our voices will be heard
Generations to the other, blood will be shed
World trambles slowly towards to it`s end
Voices of dark breaking the silence
And swallows the earth, the mindless
Who will not serve itself the master
Achieves nothing and will be forgotten
There is no use for the fear and pain
When you wake, you got thorns of power and strenghtInstrumentalIn my eyes stagnation surrounds
Blood that life beaten and bound
An act of mercy, a scene pain
There is no difference
It's all in your name
This act of god
Lights of fate brighten my eyes
Fires of hate scourge through the sky
Lost in your darkness, burned by your flame
Forced to believe it's all in your name
This act of god
Honesty's heresy in this holy war
Contradiction and affliction hardening my heart
My heart
Life conflicts with open decay
Death restricts enlightenment
Love is paradise hate is insane
There is no difference it's all in your name
This act of god
Honesty's heresy in this holy war
Contradiction and affliction hardening my heart
My heart
This act of god
This act of god
Holy war
Holy war
Honesty's heresy in this holy war
Contradiction and affliction hardening my heart
My heartNumenorean corsairs
Your sons have stepped ashore
From the battle and storms
With northern fleets
Great treasure they fought
From the shores of Gondor
Drove their men into the sea
It's time for the feast
To the habour of Umbar
Like a wind we sail
Your pitiful slaves now row
Tonight we will celebrate
Open your barrels
Bring me your finest wine
Where are the women?
Your heroes have arrived
No sleep tonight my friends
It's time for the pleasures
Because it is soon another day
And our ship leaves again
Fill my mug, I just want to forget
All the troubles and fighting
And the ghosts in my head
Dancing and drinking
In Buccaneers Inn
And later tonight it's time for sin[Music & Arr. by Vold 1996]Pray to your god
So sinister, yet so commonplace
Subconscious network
The eerie light you worship so readily
Peer in your eyes, in your mind
Used you as your own enemy
Fixate on its gloried role
Profiled and led away from the truth
Like many fools
Some hope of a way to break its glare
Masses steered by fabricated thoughts
Societies wet dream and its goals
Societies wet dream
A long forgotten past
Replaced by what is "now"
Reeling out of control, growing
Finite possibilities lay in waitThis seeking is
concealing
What is hidden in the back
Outstanding your
pretending
And this is what makes me so sick
"Ihavebeensickbeforeyoucameandknockeduponmydoor"
What ever
made you think
that I lost this game...
I did not even play!
Repeat then
delete and
hope that no one got you wrong
Find phrases where
Silence is
to camouflage this discomfort
"Tellthisjokeonceagainistilldidnotgetit"
Me, unmoved
Me, freak...
Tell me why should I be
the one you'd like to see?
Fuck me?
Fuck you
Fuck me I fuck you, too
Fuck me?
Fuck you
Fuck me I fuck you, too
These lines are written down because
Then I can scream 'em out
It does not only ease the pain
It helps to see things clear
My giving
Your taking
I know those hopeful eyes
This case has
two faces
One is right, the other left
"thedayIneedafriendlikeyouI'lljusthavemyselfalittlesquatandshitoneout"
What in the world
makes you think
that I have lost this game?
Who can win this anyway?
My hate is my comfort
My hate is my shell,
my justification
to send you to hellHeading into the battle
Against inferior foe.
Early morning's sea lies so silent and clear.
Let them feel a broadside
From our three decker of pride.
Let the enemy fleet shatter for the wind.
The Man of the Hour
In a challenging game,
He rose to power
By his family name.
The Man of the Hour
In the lion's den,
Wielding his power
While dooming his men.
With gun ports open
And without striking sail
He turned the ship around to chase the Danes away.
The wind made the ship heel
Causing panic aboard.
Cannons, men and cargo they all broke astray.
Lower decks were flooded,
Chaos and agony.
The morning air was filled with an aria of cries.
Crewmen jumped the rail now
Choosing ice before the fire.
Down from powder deck they saw the smoke arise.In a twilight blue and shadowed
As the faintest stars were born
In a month of summers ending
Earth's peace was shattered by a storm
Came a rider helmed with lightning
Racing down the skies
Magic weapon in his hands
And madness in his eyes
Lifting high his blade of music
To the world again he comes
Scarlet-eyed and masked in metal
Summoned by the battle drums
The sky is filled with screaming music
Anthem to a dream of hell
Lashing men to killing madness
The song of war will cast it's spell
In a twilight blue and shadowed
As the faintest stars were born
In a month of summers ending
Earth's peace was shattered by a storm
Warrior of both past and future
Let your magic sing
Chimes of peace or battle thunder
Which message do you bring?
Thunder rider, cloaked in darkness
The past burns in your eyes
On the quest for ancient treasure
Do you know where it lies?
Dark horseman
Caped in shadow
Sliding down the wind
Stranger to this place and time
Where will you begin?Lyrics: Grutle Kjellson 1994
Bottomless abyss, Ginnungagap
darkness without end before the Morning
of time
the Cold Empire's eleven rivers frozen
frost mist spreads itself wide out
The gust from Nivlhel in the North
fills the mighty gap
Licking tongues of fire from the South
boiling, bubbling venom
All life has its origin in a source of
JOTUNBLOOD
Your mind's own evil inner;
JOTUNBLOOD
Streams from Hvergelmes Source
united with nauseating drops of venom
The first, the Father of all families
created by the Two Elements
With himself he breeded
our proud ancestors
Our Primitive Force's deep roots
with energy from the cattle's four rivers
A knife through the dark
A shrill scream
A pale face foams
He wanders proudly over Ymer's bones
All life has its origin in a source of
JOTUNBLOOD
Your mind's own evil inner;
JOTUNBLOOD
If one seeks all Midgard's knowledge
If the Wise Woman swings her staff
One can not avoid one's origin
The chaos of the Primitive Force;
JOTUNBLOOD
Music: Ivar Bjrnson 1994In this world of death and pain
the memory remains,
the dragon that can't be slain
I live life like a warrior
taking control of everything and everyone
who stands in front of me weakly
unafraid to stand my ground
I don't fuck around
get in my face and I'll knock you down
pound for pound the undisputed king
of these street
I never ran taking shit from no man
I've fought em all, win or lose, do or die
I'll never give up till I'm asleep in the sky
No one can stop me from living my life my way
my beliefs are all I've got and I'll
take them to my grave
Don't try and help me, just stay the fuck outta my way
I live for myself and I'll die by what I say
I'll fight to the death for friends and family
defend their hon or till there's nothing left of me
like it or not, you can never forget me
unafraid to show this world
how it should be
it's my life, my way motherfucker
fuck with me you gonna pay motherfucker
i swear to God I'll never stop
fightin for the top until I fuckin drop
No one can stop me from living my life my way
my beliefs are all I've got and I'll
take them to my grave
Don't try and help me, just stay the fuck outta my way
I live for myself and I'll die by what I say
My life's been nothing but a struggle
since the day I opened my eyes
and now I've gotta fight so hard just to get ahead
provide and survive
everyday I smash through the lies that
are twisting me around
this life we live is slipping away but
I'll never let you down
cause my days maybe numbered, but
I'll never let you forget
who I was and what I stood for
A life with no regrets...
A life with no regrets...
No one can stop me from living my life my way
my beliefs are all I've got and I'll
take them to my grave
Don't try and help me, just stay the fuck outta my way

Fate Passare, Respiri Con Facilita
Mostrano I Suoi Pensieri Sulla PaceMoving out from the inside
We breed our extinction
An approaching era of sunlight
Beyond comprehension
What is what was what went wrong
The screams of the ageless
Brought down by the disease installed
In the formula for our creation
We hear the final call
Echoing rage through the blood stained walls
Mother nature can feel the end
The coming face of season hell
When the last rain of judgment washes away
Traces of our existence, burnt embers astray
Encrypted fossils of insight
(Explore the enigma)
The tragedies on the human show
Our trusted leaders sell humanity by the pound
For reasons we'll never know
We hear the final call
Echoing rage through the blood stained walls
Mother nature can feel the end
The coming face of season hell
This ship has sailed with ever decreasing profits
While we see the end we refuse to stop it
Why can't we see, until a change is made
Every night sweeps the other side
Unmask the earth charade
What is me? A smile upon the end
Faithless, soulless, shameless man
Somewhere lost his way
When the last rain of judgment washes away
Traces of our existence, burnt embersWelcome to my exhibition, welcome to my hell, upon the altar lies my human
sacrifice, distorted images I hunt to find.
[Chorus]
One final body to finish up the artwork, violent art, the darker part.
New murder, new painting, it never gets done, heavy murders - a godly work
of art.
Colors created by blood, murder - I'm in it for the art, my sick brain eats me.
I'm feeding it with pain, my treasures I hide, but from myself I cannot run.
[Chorus x2]
One final body to finish up the artwork, violent art, the darker part.
New murder, new painting, it never gets done, heavy murders - a godly work
of art.Feels so good
Feels so right
Feels so good
Look inside those crazy eyes
Of a blackened, hazy mind
Think you've found a secret power?
Better close those eyes
(Feels so good)
Living under city towers
(Feels so right)
Fallen apples rotting under
(Feels so good)
Warming under sunny summer skies
Open up the real world, crawl inside
Worshiping in the house of Cain
Poisoning your life away
Worshiping in the house of Cain
Poisoning your life, poisoning your life away
Away, away, away
Once you had a real name
Now you caught up in life's little pains
Never thought of asking why?
Wake up, come and kiss the sky
(Feels so good)
Underneath the dying flowers
(Feels so right)
Eye to eye with all that thunder
(Feels so good)
Thinking of chemical suicide
Turn out the lights and crawl inside
Worshiping in the house of Cain
Poisoning your life away
Worshiping in the house of Cain
Poisoning your life, poisoning your life away
Away, away, away
Worshiping in the house of Cain
Poisoning your life away
Worshiping in the house of Cain
Poisoning your life, poisoning your life
Worshiping in the house of Cain
Poisoning your life away
Worshiping in the house of Cain
Poisoning your life, poisoning your life away
Away, yeah
Living under city towers
Fallen apples rotting under
Warming under sunny skies
Open up the real world, crawl inside
Inside
Leave all the tears behind
No more fears with the hands of time
Squeezing poison through his veins
Just a kiss to ease the pain
In the dark streets [Incomprehensible]
Serpent's maid is deliveringI'm enthralled by this force
Priceless peace altering my mind
Essence of higher life
Infiltrates my spiritual being
Perfect state of mind [x2]
Grace divine comes to me
Silent God moves within my heart
Giving me certainty
Now I am a fragrance of life
Perfect state of mind [x2]
Having knowledge of He who guides me
I see through your empty and hollow lies
You can never separate me from Him
My spirit is forever in His hands
I bring forth praises
To He who reings
He is my perfect
State of mindEstas alucinando
Why pasas de pensar,
Te va mucho a la gacha
Te tienes que cuidar.
Te han dicho en tu casa
Que tienes que mirar,
Why nadie te comprende
En esta sociedad.
Junkie,
Junkie,
Junkie,
Junkie.
Cargado de problemas
Que quieres olvidar,
Te lanzas a la calle
Haber que pasa allÃÂ¡.
Te encuentras ya muy chumbo,
Lo estas pasando mal,
Te dices a ti mismo
Lo tengo que dejar.

[lyrics: Puolakanaho & Vetel?inen]
And the ancient mystic words misled me...
They reached my hidden innocence
So the sweetest moments of the perfect beauty...
Turned to the hours of the deepest despair
I'm nothing but a shattered soul...I cannot see...
Been ravaged by the chaotic beauty
Ruined by the unreal temptations...I cannot flee...
I was betrayed by my own beliefs
And my heart betrayed all dead emotions...
I could hear my breath even if I did not breathe
Now the changing tides wash over me...
And the freezing breath breezes through me
I'm nothing but a shattered soul...I cannot see...
Been ravaged by the chaotic beauty
Ruined by the unreal temptations...I cannot flee...
I was betrayed by my own beliefs
I'm nothing but a shattered soul...
Been ravaged by the chaotic beauty...
Ruined by the unreal temptations...
I was betrayed by my own beliefs...Not again.
Not again.
Not again.
Not again.
Why did God make glass to be shattered?
To hold and to cut?
Your crooked cross covers your eyes.
Forgot my name.
Forgot where I came from.
I died getting here,
Make me gold,
I'm waiting.
Call me the Dark Angel.
(don't touch me, don't trust me)
Please don't scare.
(please keep your hands away from me)
I'd like to have a word with you. [x8]
(Just keep your hands off me)
(Please keep your hands off me)
Call me the Dark Angel.
(don't touch me, don't trust me)
Please don't scare.
(please keep your hands away from me)
Please don't scare.
I'd like to have a word with you. [x9]
I'd like to have my way with you.
Take my time with you,
Id like to abuse my mind with you.
Id like to share my knife with you.
Don't scare,
Don't scare,
Don't scare,
Don't scare,
Don't scare,
Don't scare,
Don't.[Instrumental]Extrapolating from the abhorrent
We disinter a sordid truth
Heinously plundering death's depths
Like a bumbling violent sleuth
Tearing through the layers of decay
With vicious rancor and bitter scorn
To get at the cold, dead heart of the matter
Which we bring forth to mourn
Carnage canonized
We let death reign unfettered
Derangement eulogized
To the last bloody letter
No one can do it better
In grisly detail we play out or own
Death scenes' coup de grace
With homicidal zeal we remove the curtain
That decorum would draw
Retrograding your morality in our sick
Dead world, it had no place
Desecrating your sense of dignity
But of course in the end, it's all a matter of distaste
Your values mollified, severed by clean
Precise cuts, each to the last
Your senses vilified, taste and tolerance
Are now taken to task
In the name of gore
We'll set right this bloody score
The grave can't hold us anymore
We'll kick in the mausoleum doors
Even sicker than before
We enjoy this gruesome chore
Revealing the ghastly horror
The face of death that you deplore
Rotting through the core
This slaughterous carnage you abhor
Is the vocation we adore
As we drain another oozing sore
Bringing revulsion to the fore
As the vomit stains on the floor
Forevermore, in the name of gore
Stopping at nothing to indulge
An off-color sense of tumor
We regurgitate force-fed atrocities
Straight onto a silver platter
Serving up ghastly repast
Hard to swallow without black humor
With tongue in cheek
We gorge on the matter of splatter
Leaving no headstone unturned
And no grave site unmarred
Our wayward journey six feet
Straight down we undertake
Dark horses tread swiftly
Through this unhallowed dance macabre
Somnambulating through
Our own nightmares while fully awake
Never letting sleeping cadavers lie
We wring out their sickening stories
Though lending a near and a voice
To the dead would make some wince
No detail is omitted
No matter how repulsive, vile or gory
We won't recant our morbid epithets
Flesh, not words, is what we mince
Decay by any other name
Would reek and fester just the same
We delight in beating a dead corpse
In its own malignant game
Slicing off another cutting remark
That could shear off protruding bones
Our barbs are quite malicious
And our verbal daggers sharply honed
Decay consecrated
Wallowing in our own pathological waste
Reality regurgitated
And smear right back in your fucking face
In the name of gore
We'll set right this bloody score
The grave can't hold us anymore
We'll kick in the mausoleum doors
Even sicker than before
We enjoy this gruesome chore
Revealing the ghastly horror
The face of death that you deplore
Rotting through the core
This slaughterous carnage you abhor
Is the vocation we adore
As we drain another oozing sore
Bringing revulsion to the fore
As the vomit stains on the floor
Forevermore, in the name of goreA Lonesome Wind Entered the Pits of my Dreams
Swept my Thirst into Shades of Gleams
It Spread a Rain of Ethereal Tunes
Coloured my Pictures so Freezing Cold
By the Shelter of the Night the Pale Silver Eye Returned
In the Distance of the Nordic Light the Inverted Horizon Burned
A Woven Bridge between the Sunken Lands was Forged
Twisted my Longing into Caskets of Time
It Opened the Eternity of a Cosmical Maze
Coloured my Pictures so Dusty and Old
Beside the Vast Snowy Woodland
Beside the Enormous Hillsides of Frost
Below the Magnificent Starsky Black
I am Cloaked by the Moonshine Mist
In Nocturnal Midwinter Hours
In Bloodred Darkness Gone
The Call - I Heard
The Vision - I Saw
The Scent - I Knew
The Oath - I Swore[Lyrics by RMS Hreidmarr]
Blessed be my own decision
This body must burn upon the Altar of Holocausts
Murder her when you make love
Like millions of worms penetrating her flesh
While she's lying down, down in the dirt
And there is no nobility
When I try to kill the sin in me
To fuck equals to kill
And I'll make her live in the purest, blackest hell ever
When I raise my fist slowly, so-called king
And when my words become your one and only world...
Keys to the gates of submission
Obey, and look down
I don't love you
I'm the eye of deception
Control the worms
I was meant to die, to order and to reign
I am just a white fading flower
As he used to call me
Burn the witch
Razorblade
Expire
Last breath
Krieg in Sicht
Yet if as holiest men have deem'd, there be
A land of souls beyond that sable shore...
How sweet it were in concert to adore
With those who made our mortal labours light,
To hear each voice we fear'd to hear no more
Behold each mighty shade reveal'd to sight
The Bactrian, Samian sage, and all who taught the right !
Motherfucking sage will not come to save you, fool !
Krieg in Sicht
A smile - I defy
With all my innocence
My lips closer to yours, I feel your breath
Attraction, repulsion and pride
Desire made me think I had the right
To take your life away
Die by my own will
Nature of Holocaust

Missing you was always one more kiss.
Now there's nothing that I can do.
One more nail in the coffin, and it's all for you.
Always were and always were a simple love story.
You were everything I ever hoped and dreamed.
Drown me in a pool of my blood.
It's getting harder just to breathe.
I'll suffocate you faster just so you can't see, so you can't see me sleep.
It's getting harder just to say the right things.

And they're calling me. the day

Don't let me wake.
Drown me in a pool of my blood.

a una aldea llegaban las fuerzas del mal
los viejos queran huir, huir lejos de all, de su hogar no, no, no.
Pero la juventud, tena otra opinin
huir lejos sera, tan solo una ilusin
solo retrasar el final fatal, su rendicin no. no, no.
Entre la esclavitud o el morir
haba que tomar una actitud, haba que decidir.
Y de cada corazn surgi una voz
un grito atronador.
Yo, estoy aqu
Yo, para luchar
Yo, para morir
Por mi libertad [BIS]
Se armaron con lo poco, que pudieron encontrar
mujeres, nios, todos, prepararon el lugar
saban que no habra paz, ni a donde escapar, no hay rendicin, no, no,
no.
La tropa del mal lleg sin desconfiar
seguros de vencer, sin batalla presentar.
Pero algo hizo temblar su corazn
cuando el pueblo atac.
Yo, estoy aqu
Yo, para luchar
Yo, para morir
Por mi libertad [BIS]
Quizs fue suerte
quizs algo mas
pero siempre hay esperanza
para el que lucha
por su libertad, libertad.

Yo, estoy aqu.
Yo, para luchar.
Yo, para morir.
Por mi libertad.
POR MI LIBERTAD
POR MI LIBERTAD
POR MI LIBERTAD
POR MI LIBERTAD
POR MI LIBERTADThe penetrating stares of judge and jury condemn emotion, dictate the standards of said principles and bore plasticity through your character. Life slowly turns into a sterile cage of uniformity and enforced morality. Tolerance is nothing but void. The individual has been canceled.Hanging on the CROSS the price was paid
Blood shed for remission of sins
You don't care well that's too bad
There will be a price to pay
HE'S the living GOD
Raised from the dead
Crucify your life
Through CHRIST be BORN AGAIN
Satan is defeated
CHRIST in victory rose from the dead
Satan puffs himself up to appear mighty
He knows his future is in the flames
Your whole life was just day one of eternity
JESUS wants to greet you in his loving embrace
There are no exceptions
If you haven't chosen CHRIST you chose satan
There is no middle ground
Your eternity depends on your choice
HE'S the living GOD
Raised from the dead
Crucify your life
Through CHRIST be BORN AGAIN
HE'S ALIVEGreed has caused you to become a monster
Greed has caused you to become so cold
You said you loved him, then you put him away
"Till death do us part" means nothing to you
Greed has caused you to betray your family
Greed has caused you to become so jaded
We've got some news for you, every dollar you save
Will cushion your pillow in hell
You act like we're blind, deaf and dumb
Betrayal has now left us numb
We're sorry we can't escape from
This choice now we all must succumb
He's been thrown away, left for dead
This is the only father we've had
Thrown away, left for dead
How could you choose money instead
Greed has caused you to become a monster
Greed has caused you to become so cold
We've got some news for you, every dollar you save
Will cushion your pillow in hell
You act like we're blind, deaf and dumb
Betrayal has now left us numb
We're sorry we can't escape from
This choice now we all must succumb
He's been thrown away, left for dead
This is the only father we've had
Thrown away, left for dead
How could you choose money instead
We will never forget that you're the reason
This sadness has overwhelmed us
This grief is too much to bear
How can we look you in the eyes
How could you ruin his life
After all the years of of joy he brought us
There is no 'we' anymore
There is no 'us' anymore
You will have to live your last days in infamy
How could you do this
How could you choose to have him
Thrown away, left for dead
This is the only father we've had
Thrown away, left for dead
How could you choose money insteadAin't no cloud in my sky,
Got no reason to cry,
Now there's you in my life,
(now that there is you in my life)
And the smell of your perfume,
I can't get it out of my mind,
(can't get you out of my mind)
Cause when we're together,
The feeling's so right,
So right girl, and you know that...
I like the way you soothe me, I like it,
I like the way you make love feel,
I can't explain it's so unreal,
One kiss from you, it moves me (I like it),
Takes me to a different world,
I'm so glad I found you girls,
I like the way you soothe me,
As I work, my mind drifts,
Cause I'm dreaming of you by my side,
(thinkin' of you all of the time)
The time goes so slowly
And I feel so lonely
When we're apart, (we're apart)
Just can't wait to be with you,
Cause your love is so right, girl,
All I'm thinking is...
I like the way you soothe me, I like it,
I like the way you make love feel,
I can't explain it's so unreal,
One kiss from you, it moves me and I like it,
It takes me to a different world,
I like the way you soothe me, I like it,
I like the way you make love feel,
I can't explain it's so unreal,
I know sometimes, it can be hard,
I know love is not easy,
And I thank you for the love you give me,
And promise that forever, I will love nobody but you, girl...
I like the way you soothe me, I like it,
I like the way you make love feel,
I can't explain it's so unreal,
One kiss from you, it moves me and I like it,
It takes me to a different world,
I'm so glad I found you girl,
I like the way you soothe me, I like it,
I like the way you make love feel,
I can't explain it's so unreal,
One kiss from you, it moves me and I like it,
It takes me to a different world,
I'm so glad I found you girl...I remember when I was twelve years old
No worries in my brain with a pound in my pocket
And a chest full of smoke
I remember all the chordies we drove.
We used to play football all day and use jumpers for goalposts
And throw egg yolks at windows to wind up the old folks
Started learning about the birds and the bees
So there's birds from my class on their knees behind trees.
My favorite emcee was Sharkey Major
Way before I hit one double O three, Temptation, Kiss 100, or Flava
Get off from school and take
Ninety two point three but let's skip forward in time
Seven years down the line and it seems the spotlights on me
Sometimes I still wish that I was still twelve or thirteen.
Life can pass you buy, just watch how fast it flies
Nineteen eighty-nine's when I started mine, now I'm like 'what happened to the time?'
Life can pass you buy, just watch how fast it flies
Nineteen eighty-nine's when I started mine, now I'm like 'what happened to the time?'
Fifteen, bag of weed, bag of beers in the park
Duckin' out from Feds in the dark.
Then we appear with grass stains up and down my legs and arms
And with a fresh beer clenched in my palm.
Sixteen, my bars are different class
I've been rolling with Dogz and Glamour and Shotz for a year
I've been steppin' up fast.
I guess I got around in the bits.
I was selling bags of bud and Tales from the Crypt.
I met Ghetts when I was fourteen, lost touch.
By sixteen, I'd linked up with Ghetts again
Rolling with The Movement and started doing sets for them.
Mercston, Scorcher, Unique and Wretch and 'em.
Two thousand six, I was seventeen when I finished my first solo CD
But this time there's an album in the midst.
Life can pass you buy, just watch how fast it flies
Nineteen eighty-nine's when I started mine, now I'm like 'what happened to the time?'
Life can pass you buy, just watch how fast it flies
Nineteen eighty-nine's when I started mine, now I'm like 'what happened to the time?'
By the time I hit seventeen, I was the coldest younger on the scene
With bars you never heard and flow you never seen.
Before I come around it was 'cock it and shoot'.
Emcees being cocky and rude, then I moved to some deep concepts in my tunes.
Monitor my brain waves, tell me if I'm crazed but I think the games changed
And emcees are opening doors in the same ways.
As I did when I was a kid, on Rinse radio waves
And now I'm paving the way for a fatal display
Might blaze in a haze till I'm dazed then wave a grenade in your face
Seventeen with bars that I regulate and generate pace
I'm only scared of who my enemies face.
Life can pass you buy, just watch how fast it flies
Nineteen eighty-nine's when I started mine, now I'm like 'what happened to the time?'
Life can pass you buy, just watch how fast it flies
Nineteen eighty-nine's when I started mine, now I'm like 'what happened to the time?'
Nineteen, showing strength in the booth
Now it's time to prove what Devlin can do.
From the very first time I ever crept on a tune
I've immensely improved, the ascendance is due.
Original spitter, not remnants of you.
Swear I can see success in my view.
Crazy what letters in a sentence can do
'Cause my lyrics are the only thing sending me through.
Kanye called me a gangster rapper; I'm not a gangster rapper
Devs, I just spit it real.
You're an emcee like C difficile.
I look skinny 'cause I keep on missing meals.
I'll get cold like you know how frigid feels.
No children, sticking them rigid still
I guess my life's f***ed up but I'm only nineteen and I've got a lot of living still.
Life can pass you buy, just watch how fast it flies
Nineteen eighty-nine's when I started mine, now I'm like 'what happened to the time?'
Life can pass you buy, just watch how fast it flies
Nineteen eighty-nine's when I started mine, now I'm like 'what happened to the time?Night's fallen, flesh's calling
spilling in the flood some tears of blood and agony
There on the beach lying
wasting and staining the sands of time indifferently
Stranded on the shores of life
The fish's kiss - it still remains unanswered
Chorus
Bathing in silence, yearning to swim
on a calm and quiet ocean
urging to sin or to breathe with no motion
while hearing the sound of sweet violence
Torch-bearer's burned wings
firing all the arrows in a broken fantasy
Star's fallen, sand-crawling
dropping just like jetsam from a lonely ship at sea
Stranded on the shores of life
The fish's kiss - it still remains unanswered
Chorus
Until the day's end's
a bitter wet bed seeking a soft place for a rest of my head
Tender the arms which embrace the brave
I am fallen asleep in a watery red.
ChorusWhat they say
They say I'm crazy when it comes to you
(No matter what they say)
(No words I know can keep me away from your love)
(They say I'm crazy)
This is why
They see me walking down this lonely avenue
They see me talking when I'm the only one in view
(They say I'm crazy)
Well I'm not crazy
(Maybe a little crazy)
When it comes to you
I hear them whisper
Certainly, she's lost her mind
And draw conclusions on any reasons they can find
They say I'm crazy
Well I'm not crazy
(Maybe a little crazy)
When it comes to you
(They say I'm crazy)
Well I'm not crazy
(Maybe a little crazy)
When it comes to you, you
(When it comes to you)
All others just a waste of time
(When it comes to you)
There is nothing more on my mind
(When it comes to you)
I'm just in love
(I'm just in love)
And a little (crazy)
When it comes to you
Yes I'm just crazy
When it comes to you
They've come to notice
That it's a smile I always wear
And those who notice
That when I'm down it's still there
(They say I'm crazy)
Oh, but I'm not crazy
(Maybe a little crazy)
When it comes to you
(When it comes to you)
All others just a waste of time
(When it comes to you)
There's nothing more on my mind
(When it comes to you)
I'm just in love
(I'm just in love)
And a little crazy when it comes to you
(When it comes to you)
All of my problems seem to fade
(When it comes to you)
All of those nights turn to day
(When it comes to you)
I'm just in love
(I'm just in love)
And a little crazy when it comes to you
Yes I'm a little crazy, hey
When it comes to you, you, yeah
(No matter what they say)
(No words I know can keep me away from your love)
They say I'm crazy when it comes to you
(Say I'm crazy)
But I'm not crazy
(Maybe a little crazy)
When it comes to you
(Say I'm crazy)
Well I'm not crazy
(Maybe a little crazy)
Hey, when it comes to you
(Crazy) when it comes to youWrithing in pain
Your third eye blinks, untamed
We were one to live
Now thereÂ¹s but grief you give
Griefgiver
Dread the hurt
Crush me in the dirt
Panic, extol
Angers my mind and soul
Evolve, inherent living hate
We divide as you subjugate
Disreguard, pre-empt the deed
To avenge IÂ¹ll not concede
Griefgiver
Evolve, inherent living hate
We divide as you subjugate
You proclaim grief to me
My existence, your disease
Evolve, inherent living hate
To amend is far too late
Enraged inside your grip
Now alone, your power trip
GriefgiverThe southern end of the Misty Mountains
Waters of Entwash and Limlight
There it stands, the mighty wood of great age
Hiding secrets from the early years
Once so green and great that it reached
All over the Eriador
Huge tracts of lost lands
Beleriand covered by this great vast forest
Creatures hiding in the deepest shadows
Keeping the darkest ones away
Great guardians, fathers of woods
Defending their ancient pride
Long ago they wandered the land
Nowadays there's left only a few
Others crushed by the armies of unlight
In Fangorn there lives the eldest one
The eldest of the ents
This forest named after him
Fangorn, Treebeard
The guardian of his lands
The oldest being in Arda
So much evil he has seen
So much shadows in his dreams
With his heart full of grief
He trusts and still believes
To his kingdom so serene
For his entlings and him
Hear me my fellow ents
It's time to march into the battle
The evil has raped our lands too much
So many brothers gone by the darkness
Every orc under the banner of the hand
Will be crushed by our hate and anger
Every Uruk who stands against our power
Will be teared apart form his life
The white hand of Saruman
All his glory soon beaten down
All the walls and towers of Isengard
Destroyed by the entish wrath
Die, die uruk-hai!
The war is over and all is silent
Ravens fly to Isengard
Tall creatures with the shape of a tree
Marching north with victory
Their work is now finished
Ents have crushed their enemy
Dead uruk's every where
Reign of Saruman gone for goodBurning's the horizon of your mind drifting down
When the other side's marked its path.
See what the unknown's concealed for your fate
When the oracle lays down his masked.
Flying through the dragon's eye
To hear the secret speak;
Red clouds fill the crumbling sky
Forgotten times you seek.
Where has it gone,
He key to unknown lands.
In circles you roam,
Hold your fortune in your hands...
Never-ending maze,
Filled with pleasure, filled with pain
Take the chalice served for you,
Let you senses drain.
Approach to his domain,
A new life's to be born;
Far from human sanity,
Far from heavens door.
Keep the torches lit
The fire that makes you be...
Bright light, darkened night
Reign of immortality.
Reflections of the past,
No truth will ever last
Choirs of doom.
Dance with the dead
Through rivers of red
Will all end soon?
Nothing now remains
Of the key to unknown lands,
Marching through the void,
Feel the menace with your hands;
Lords of thunder
Down crushing flash...
The oracle is silent
And your torches turn to ash.
Stare into the dragon's eye
Far away from time;
A part of the eternal mind
...Until the bell will chime.Camouflage you close your eyes, hiding in plain sight
Wrapped tightly in blankets of lies, live whatever life you synthesize
Disguise the truth about yourself, bury it six feet deep,
Bring to life your deceit and stealth, lock the door and throw away the key.
Hide behind your lies, I seek through your disguise
It leads to your demise, I see it in your eyes.
Disarray your life slips into, falling apart at the seams,
You can't understand what's going on, who you once were is forever gone.
On and on the tangled web you weave, running from your past
You listen to whatever you want to believe
Too late karma comes around to you so fast.
All you do is lie, cheit deceive
Everyone you hate, need, believe
All you do is lie.I, the personification of hatred
Destrictive being, attendance of the Meratreg
I bring to thee the endless turbulences of "my death".
I, the personification of wrath
Infectious virus, bringer of sickness.
My twisted tempts,
Are covering the sun of "your miserable existence".
I, the personification of perfection
Splendor and Almighty creation of myself
I am the filthy seed, procreated by the horns.
The heart of darkness, the eye of the beholder.
Phantasms of the living
For a stink called world
Illusions of human realism
Only sterile blackness prevail
Emptiness and loneliness...
Blacker than black
"Black blood within human flesh....
Prevail the anti cosmic essence of times!!!"
I am the reminder of what men forgot:
THe reality of death, the mirage of life.
At the edge of existence I stand, waiting in silence, the moment...
I am the representation of despair
I am the stone around your leg, the canon watching your brain.
Suicide incitation, I am here e there just for my listeners.
I am blacker the blackIt started back in high school
So cool, king of the scene
You found that making people laugh
Was more than just a dream
The public took right to you
Like flies to a pile of shit
So funny and smart, so talented
But success just couldn't fit
Wasting your life no future bright
Dancing on your grave
Living like a slave, someone should've said
Nfl, efilnikufesin nfl
Nfl, efilnikufesin nfl
Wake up dead in a plywood bed
Six feet from the rest of your life
And when you couldn't see your own dependency
Nfl, nice fuckin' life
The whole world is your playground
Yet you can't find your niche
Your only friends, it helps you through
Helps you dig your daily ditch
The bottom line can't touch you
Cause you're above the rest
But your little friend's the enemy
And the bottom line is death
You lived a life of excess
Goddamn shame it's such a waste
Just one too many cookies
From the batch no one should taste
Yet his memory stills stays with us
Cause watching him was fun
Too bad things weren't different
Who knows what he'd have doneThe time has come to crack the sky
He wakes to rise once again
He closes his eyes and wonders why
His mission had come to end
Sent through time to give the world
Sounds of thunderous song
Fighting for victory that was his along
In his sleep the world did pass him by
Still he dreamed, his passion couldn't die
His powers taken from the gods, given to unworthy men
Creating naivete with no message to send
Feeding on the weakened minds, all who fell for the plan
Prepare for the end, his time is at hand
In his sleep the world did pass him by
Still he dreamed, his passion wouldn't die
With a vengeance in his torn heart
He has come to claim his glory
Believer of forgotten time
The legend carries on his story
A fire burns within him that burns forever more
The fight that he's been fighting, it's what he's living for
He's lives his darkest hours out on the street of dreams
A journey with no promise, but still he had to see
Through a broken sky he stands on top the world once again
The unworthy weakened minds, lives come to an end
The masses roar to hear, sounds of thunderous song
Praising his victory, that was his along
In his sleep the world did pass him by
Still he dreamed, his passion never died
With a vengeance in his torn heart
He has come to claim his glory
Believer of forgotten time
The legend carries on his story
The masses
All bow down to himYou make me wanna scream.Save today...just break away.What's making you want to stay?Is it me?You swear talk days are over.I just can't be your lover.Bury me in the back of the yard with dirt.Raise a glass tip your hat and toast to the past.Don't strike a deal with me go ahead and stay on your knees.Last thing I'll say to you,Catch a cab,hop a train cause,you and me are through.I'm sick of living every day of life like I'm the one to blame.My life is mine to own I'm gonna take this time for me to take it back.I gave you everything.I don't even wanna wear this ring.You should of,should of,spent more time on me.All together strong as ever you can hear me sing.Hey,hey baby why can't you just break away.Was it something he said?Take this chance to get away.Stop forgetting the pain.You may not live another day.Just hop a train,some day I will stop the rain.Just know that come what may.One word and I'm on my way.You can live through this pain.I will stop the rain.Hey,hey baby why you can't just break away.Was it something he said?Take this chance to get away.Stop forgetting the pain.You may not live another day.Just hop a train,some day i will stop the rain.WORK AND WORK ALL THE TIME
JUST TO FUCKING STAY ALIVE
BUT I JUST CAN'T SEEM TO STAY AHEAD
BILL COLLECTORS ON MY ASS
I NEVER HAVE ANY CASH
SOMETIMES I THINK I'D BE BETTER OFF DEAD
ALWAYS BROKE MY MONEY IS GONE
SOMETHING IS ALWAYS GOING WRONG
A HALF DECENT LIVING JUST A FUCKING DREAM
LOCKED INTO A CLASSEST CAGE
PUTS ME IN A FUCKING RAGE
I GET SO FRUSTRATED I JUST WANT TO FUCKING SCREAM
SLAVE AWAY - ALL MY LIFE
WORK ALL DAY - NO END IN SIGHT
FIRST IT STARTED OFF IN SCHOOL
YOU'RE TREATED LIKE A FUCKING FOOL
IT'S JUST A PART OF THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME
THEN YOU GET A DEAD END JOB
WORKINGWITH SOME OTHER SLOBS
THAT'S WHEN YOU REALIZE YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
MR. BOSS MAN RAISES A GLASS
FUCK THE POOR AND MIDDLE CLASS
TRIES AND THINKS OF WAYS TO KEEP THE PEOPLE DOWN
THERE'S MORE OF US CAN'T YOU SEE!!!
IT'S THEM AGAINST YOU AND ME
MAYBE LIFE WOULD BE BETTER IF THEY WEREN'T AROUND
BURN THE RICH - TO THE GROUND
WATCH IT ALL - COME CRASHING DOWN
WORK-SLAVE-TOIL-DIG YOUR GRAVE.You've got to boost your mind
Just don't leave behind
Your right to freedom
- seek all the answers
Don't throw away
Your biggest chance
To find a life to live
Studying ways to comprehend
Try to understand the human matter
Try to understand -
Try to understand the understood
Dedication made your head a cold thinking machine
Medications are the law
You're born just to win
To win the race to be the model doctor
The modern doctor
The fancy doctor
Your illusions fade away
When you make an error [x4]
Goodbye
Throwing away your only chance
You thought that you knew
Crippled man, sad remains
God will not help you
No friend but yourself
You'll pay for that
Prepare for the real test
Throwing away your only chance
You thought that you knew
Crippled man, sad remains
You'll pay for that
Prepare for the real test
God will not help you
No friend but yourself
Compassion dies
Lords of opression
In jail you'll die
Your knowledge won't help you now
Loser
This is what you are
Bad dreams
Nightmares, mental scars
The weight of justice will crush you
And smash your middling good intentionsLook into the yes of a madman
You can see it in his face, he's a weak and sad man
Staring straight ahead, his eyes set like stone
With a nine millimeter cocked at your dome
No way out, it's too late 'cause you're already in it
So what'cha gonna do you'll be dead in a minute
Thinking slow will get you nowhere fast
A young life terminated with one short blast
You live like that, you die like this
That's how it is
Livin' with regret is no way to live
That's how it is
You're dead too soon if the bullet don't miss
That's how it is kid
How it is
That's what you get for
Living like this
With a bullet in your head, you're dead, you can't miss
Ain't no time for regret when you're body is in a bag
Ain't no time to change your mind when your head begins to sag
Should've known better, ain't working for you now
Maybe if you'd know better you'd be here somehow
So change your ways before you ways change you
With a hole in your head that you can see through
You're looking up and you're looking down
Shot's are rippin' out from all around
You're crying out for help but it can't be found
The voice of regret is the only sound
You play the game and you pay the price
For hustlin' in the gutter with the motherfuckin' street lice
You're runnin' and gunnin' and whatever else goes
And you're goin' with your crew whichever way the wind blows
"Cause you got their back and they got yours
And you live for yourself and you make your own laws
But sooner or later what goes around comes around
You wind up dead and buried in hard, cold ground[Music: Gates]Cold breeze blows in a misty grove
Making dying leaves fall on the forgotten one
Sleeping in a frost-covered ground
Waiting for someone to find his lonely grave
And so did winter come over the grove
With beautiful pure white snow
Covering all tracks of struggle and fight
Of an ending life
On a grove sleeping
Silently sighing
Lonely forgotten this wandering soul
Coldness is creeping
Only one sleeping
In the grove covered with cold winter snow
Northern winter in darkness and cold
Makes the icy tears spring in his lonely soul
Sitting next to his own frozen corpse
He wishes he could rest and haunt no more
After the winter came a blooming spring
White wood anemones within
Where his body rested flowers turned red
As if marking his bloodstained bed
On a grove sleeping
Silently sighing
Lonely forgotten this wandering soul
Coldness is creeping
Only one sleeping
In the grove covered with cold winter snow
On a grove sleeping
Silently sighing
Lonely forgotten this wandering soul
Coldness is creeping
Only one sleeping
In the grove covered with cold winter snowAs we stop one moment
To think about our lives
The melody keeps changing
But the song remains the same
What's our destination
What are we heading for
Actions of tomorrow
Depend on yesterday
In the house of my soul
I feel a fire burning
In the heart of the young
The roud to freedom's turning
As the storm keeps raging
In a distant world
I hear the violent thunder
But still escape the rainTrapped inside this prison cell
You make life a living hell
I've always gave for you
I can't believe what you put me through
Violent destruction comes over you
Thoughts of suicide it's nothing new
I watch you wreck the place
Angel's heart Satan's face
Excuses running thin
I've got to leave this hell I'm in
Black rage of anger, smashing walls
I think you'd shoot yourself if you had the balls
Nothing learned, nothing taught
Nothing found, nothing sought
What is this you put me through
Cannot choose to be with you
Inside's just an empty head
Matter's dead no cells are fed
Is this the life you want to show
Well it's not what I want to know
Your violent tendencies
Have driven me away from you
If I stayed I know I would have shot ya dead
Yes someone should shoot ya down
Violent destruction comes over you
Thoughts of suicide it's nothing new
Anger, anger
Hate and destruction, hate and destruction
Anger, anger
Hate and destruction, hate and destruction
Anger, anger
Hate and destruction, hate and destruction
Anger, anger
Hate and destruction, hate and destructionSuara lonceng dari kejauhan.
Menutupi sedikit kesedihan ku.
Sekali lagi aku akan.
Berlari dengan sekuat tenaga ku.
[Bridge]
Terus mengulang kenyataan yang ada.
Menuju bintang nan jauh disana.
Menerawangi hari esok yang ku dambakan.
Hingga perasaanku dapat dimengerti.
[Reff]
Kujelajahi dunia yang luas di hadapan ku.
Tak apa walau sebatas mimpi.
Lantunan dalam hati menolongku ketika tersesat.
Terus, dan terus melantunkannya.
Perlahan hangatkan dengan sinarnya.For so long I have felt alone
Content to live with unrest
Longing faded into countless nights
That buried my weary heart
But you brought an end
To this dead hour
And meaning to a calloused life
Held in your arms
But too far from my heart
These thoughts will carry me through
The darkest nights
While your eyes rested in mine
I remember the way you looked at me
And the way you drew me close
With one deep sigh
Scattering pieces of my restless mind
Forgetting all that we have left behindIn the morning mist by the waning moon
Through the woods she set on foot
With a sacred blade cut the berries down
Dug up the dreaded mandrake root
Tread my path to summer's end
"This bequest I leave you", she says
You will see what could be evergreen
Turn to copper and fade to gray
By the standing stones
Atropine eyes smiled at me
Sitting in a sluggish vertigo
Sands of time form another dream
No love without sacrifice
No liege springs without decay
The final kiss is a wormy one
In soils cold caress to rest we'll lay, to rest we'll layCan't move an inch
But for the act to
Leave fingerprints
Freedom farewell
Look in the lens
Answer the questions
Are you a threat?
Nec plus ultra
After all the grabbing it's time to bite the dust
Leave behind the breaches of my trust
Cleaning up the mess is up to us
Non plus ultra
Now that all hands are tied
We're panic stricken
Wealth out of sight
Demolition the damaged pride
The price of ambition
Nec plus ultra
The current system leads to profit seeking deeds
Leave behind the traces of our blood
Now the course for change is up to us
Non plus ultra
Now that all hands are tied
We're panic stricken
Wealth out of sight
Demolition the damaged pride
The price of ambition
Access is now denied
We're panic stricken
Wealth out of sight
Intuition forgotten guide
The price of suppression
Terre eos vi
Augearis
Perde eos vi
Nobis imperium
Can't move and inch
But for the act to
Leave fingerprints
Freedom farewell
Look in the lens
Answer the questions
Will you behave as required?
When we think the end is here
With nearly all faith gone
There is hope along the way
And there a new age dawns
"None are more hopelessly enslaved
Than those who falsely believe that they are free"
Nobis victoria
Non plus ultra
Now that all hands are tied
We're panic stricken
Wealth out of sight
Demolition the damaged pride
The price of ambition
Access is now denied
We're panic stricken
Wealth out of sight
Intuition forgotten guide
The price of suppression
Can't move an inch
But for the act to
Leave fingerprints
Freedon farewell
Look in the lens
Answer the questions
Will you behave as required?
When we think the end is here
And our faith will disappear
"Chasing our addictions we're stunting our growth
Once we get rid of this ballast we'll be able to
Restore the balance and distribute our wealth"I lay here silent, how do I tell her
How far away I feel
With every breath she tries to hold tighter
But far away is all I feel
You needed a hand and I tried to be that hand
But life is yours to hold
Strap down tight, it's going to be a long ride
It's time you ride alone
Then she said, "I found God
But I'm not the God you see"
Then she said, "I found God
But I'm not the God you see"
"Don't leave me like this alone", she said
"I'd die to be with you
I took my own life, I took my own life
I took my own life with my own hands"
Listen to me, listen to me
Listen to me 'cause I can't save you
Listen to me, listen to me
Listen, I've got to save myself
I've got to save myself
I've got to save myself
I've got to save myself
Then she said, "I found God
But I'm not the God you see"
Then she said, "I found God
But I'm not the God you see
Put your nails in me"
She said she's never felt alive
Then she said, "I found God
But I'm not the God you see"
Then she said, "I found God
But I'm not the God you see
And I could never be"
Oh, I can't save anybody
No, I can't save you
Put your nails in meI bear witness to an unclear reality
I won't wait for the pure satisfaction it's building
Forged to perfection
Tape my eyes open for the oncoming storm
No!
I can sense there's still fear in the air
As humanity starts through your flesh
Their skin starts to rot, beginning to crack
No one cares anymore
Your false pretenses starting to fade
Burn! With your self righteous lies
Oh how all the pitiful will fall
Sister! Sister Charlatan no one cares anymore
I no longer admire you
There's no one left to impress
Sister! Sister Charlatan!
I no longer admire you
The way you burned them all live
Fire in your eyes
I will always remember
How fast the beautiful will fall
Walls come crashing down
It was all just a lie
You were so good at making your mark
And running away
Forge a smile with your second face
Sister Charlatan, I no longer admire you
Go!
I no longer admire you
The way you burned them all alive
Fire in your eyes
I will always remember
How fast the beautiful will fall
Walls come crashing down
I no longer admire you
Sister, Sister Charlatan
I no longer admire you
This is my declaration
Sister Charlatan
I no longer admire you
This is my declaration
Sister CharlatanAgony lives in my soul,
passion haunts my mind,
peace and chaos fight in my heart,
in my dreams there is always daylight...
Black was the day,
Constant the flow of my tears...
Black is the day,
My yearning is invincible...
Beauty surrounded me,
Illusion was beauty made true...
Beauty surrounds me,
The dream is always there...
I can hear the thunder of silence,
I feel the cold in the middle of the flame...
I see shadows of the invisible,
I breathe where there is no air...
I eat the bread that ran out yesterday,
I am dumb but I cry Thy name...
I regret the joy I have,
I suffer from the happiness I wish for...
I am a prisoner behind bars of freedom,
I now sense the things that have never happened.I heard the nations are threatened by crisis
A curse from east, where the demon rises
The sin is changing the face of this earth
While we are waiting for the darkest birth
The coming vision
Was our decision
Can it be
That all we need
Is a resistant breed
The harming cast
Flourishing fast
Can it be
That this is it
The final exit
No
There is no way out of guilt when you free the deceiver
So wont you, wont you please spread disease Nikita
No
There is no way out of guilt when you kill a believer
So wont you, wont you please spread disease Nikita
Politics shaped the organic statement
A lifeless planet as a final judgement
The sickness in me is the sickness in you
The bitter response to the things that we do
Angry virus free us please
From the scum on this earth with a painful disease
Angry Nikita if this won't be
We will destroy ourselves one day else you will seeTwilight burn across the sky
Time has come the doom is near
Stillness rules this cloudless night
Armageddon is here
Woe to you
Earth and sea
Total destruction
Twelve days of total eclipse
Yet the stillness rules this night of mist
But slowly clouds of death are forming
The time has come to reap
Burning skies
Battle cries
Total destruction
The end of mankind universe
So many battles yet to fight
Take heed forever learn
When the bells chime the return
Screams of fear
The doom is here
Total destructionAgain we took a step back
And I can't stand it anymore
A waste of time that's all it was
We should have realized it
The same old story written new
The same mistakes the same regrets
But after all it was the best
For everyone except you
Tell me how you're feeling
How you can go on knowing
That we nearly found a way
Come on talk to me
We nearly made it dear
How does that feel right now?
Are you feeling better?
Come on talk to me!
Thinking over the things that I still miss
For the sake of my heart I should stay strong
Thinking over that there's no place to run away, run away
Step1
It's time to break through
That apathetic way of life
Step2
Clear up your mind and learn
To use the passion that you have
Step3
Be honest to yourself
And everybody that's around
Step4
Stay strong and go on
Never stop dreaming
As you see
Things work out in the end
Just believe in who you are
As you see
Things work out in the end
Take my hand
And follow me
So take my hand and follow me
Follow me!
Thinking over the things that I still miss
For the sake of my heart I should stay strong
Thinking over that there's no place to run away, run away
Thinking over that there's no place to run away, run away
Thinking over that there's no place to run away, run awayI bled on a pivotal stretch
Like a clockwork Christ
Bears sore stigmata, bored
And as I threw Job, I drove
Myself to a martyred wretch
To see if I drew pity
Or pretty litanies from the Lord
So the plot sickened
With the coming of days
Ill millennia thickened
With the claret I sprayed
And though they saw red
I left a dirty white stain
A splintered know in the grain
On Eden's marital aid
So glad for the madness
I walked the walls, naked to the moon
In Sodom and Babylon
And through rich whores and corridors
Of the Vatican, I led a sordid Borgia on
I read the Urilia text
So that mortals wormed
As live bait for the dead
And as I broke hope, I choked
Another pope with manna peel
Dictating to De Sade
In the dark entrails of the Bastille
And as he wrote, I smote
A royal blow to the heads of France
And in the sheen of guillotines
I saw others, fallen, dance
I was an incurable
Necromantic old fool
A phagadaena that crawled
Drooling over the past
A rabid wolf in shawl
A razor's edge to the rule
That the stars overall
Were never destined to last
So glad for the madness
I furnaced dreams, a poet, for of sleep
Turning sermons with the smell
On witchfinder fingers
Where bad memories lingered
Burning, as when Dante was freed to map Hell
I sired schemes and the means
To catch sight of the seams
And the vagaries in between
And midst the lips and the curls
Of this cunt of a world
In glimpses, I would see
A nymph with eyes for me
Eyes of fire that set all life aflame
Lights that surpassed art
In sight, that no intense device of pain
Could prise their secrets from my heart
I knew not her name
Though her kiss was the same
Without a whisper of shame
As either virtue or sin's
And pressed to her curve
I felt my destiny swerve
From damnation reserved
To a permanent grin
So glad for the madnessAttain the supreme divisions of faith.
Universal forms, your destiny is safe.
Control of your senses, from freedom to delusion.
Spiritual realization, convinced of your lord's opulence.
Engage yourselves in devotion, dwell in your masters kingdom.
"You are supreme master of birth, death and fear"Just because you turned your back, just because you turned away, it doesn't make me any better it doesn't make you any less, you think your better, my ideals are still the same, you're the one who fucking sold out, you're the only one to blame. Just because you turned your back it, doesn't make me any less LETS GO! Bring it back, just because you turned your back, ill never turn away turn away form this fight, ill never turn my back on this fight.Giving our blood

There's no way to rise from beneath your wings
Chained to your side, I can never leave
You choke out the light like a cloud hanging over me

You're dragging me down with your suicidal symphony
(Shadow maker)
Over my head, over my head
Everything is so empty, no glass half full
How can someone so beautiful be so miserable?
I'd follow you down to the edges of earth
Just to hear you say that your life is cursed

You're dragging me down with your suicidal symphony

Would you stay and listen?

Lick it.
-------------------------Last night I, I saw you standing
And I started, started pretending
I knew you, you knew me too
And just like a lonely, you were too shy
And you were the only and so was I
And I, dreamed of you ever since
Now I, build up my confidence
That next, next time you come my way
I'll know just what to say
Can we talk for a minute?
Girl, I want to know your name
Can we talk for a minute?
Girl, I want to know your name
I started, to write you letters
'Cause I want her to be more than ever
I wanted to get down and receive
To hug you, girl, yeah
But, just like a baby, I do not talk
I tried to get closer, but I could not walk
And I dreamed of you ever since
Now I build up my confidence
That next, next time you come my way
I'll know just what to say
Can we talk for a minute?
Girl, I want to know your name
Can we talk for a minute?
Girl, I want to know your name
Last night I, I saw you standing
And I started, started pretending
I knew you and you knew me too
And just like a lonely, you were too shy
And you were the only 'cause so was I
And I, dreamed of you ever since
Now I, build up my confidenceIn Pearl City
Pearl City
No-one knows, no-one cares
about your world of stocks and shares
I don't need no riding crop
I don't need no roundabout stop
You're welcome to Pearl City
See the bank
Bright white trains
You old coots
retired early
At Pearl City
In Pearl City
Cappuccino and a slice of quiche
It's salad for the new educated 'teach'
Everything is gonna work out fine
They're sleepin' us in the lec-lecturer line
In Pearl City
In Pearl City
Ye over-counter drugs
Have left you totally bushwhacked
In Pearl City
We asked Vauxhall drivers
what they wanted from a garage
Did ya? Did ya?
At service center on the rock
Pearl City
I don't need a bird beggin at my knees
I don't need no riding crop
I don't need no roundabout stop
(Are you on the ball?)Honesty is dealt a fatal blow
Mislead by governments false conduct
Trapped in confusion
Open your eyes, and see the truth
False authorization
Mistaken for standards with false appeal
Democracy by the people, warped concentrations
Misrepresentation of morals, a nation who's god is left on the shelf
Consumed with the lust of money, scarred soldiers in a losing fight
Truth of Christ is lost, country eating itself away
Misrepresented representation
A nation that will drive into the groundUp to her elbows in soil and schizophrenia
The dirt has begun to breathe
Cries of a phantom infant tease and torment a dying mind
Held down in profanation
Subjugation of the senses
Pushing pins in her eyes
Pushing pins in her eyes
She never sleeps
Hallucination never diesTake a piece of life in hand, you know that life is yours
Indulgence, everlasting rage escaping through your pores
Day by day it grows so close, intensify the end
You know the day will come, we go beyond the end
What's in store, we fear no more, a blaze of ritual fire
Accept a form of life unknown by death, I am inspired
Hoping for a place of worship to pardon all my sins
This is where your life will end, beyond begins
Become at one with death it self and see where it will lead
Escaping from domestic, self-inflicted greed
Hoping for forgiveness, can you take the pain much more?
Soon your life will know just what's in store
Craving life beyond the end
To no avail, put down your blackened veil
Assuming that your life was pure
Immense disease for which there is no cureAnd now I think I understand your plans. You'd rather have an audience then listen when I need you. listen, when it really matters. Don't you let your lines come crossed time and again? Do you remember when loyalty meant something? Because I still do. and theres a few of you that I can still give in to, when I've seen you grow, when I've seen you fall apart. All the things I used to know, im destined to forget. Now I've watched you fall apart. All the things you'll never know, ill try not to forget. And when our heart awakes I too will kill it off, and if the weather fits we'll witness her hurt. Those memories make us complete. It's the way, I wish you still could be. But the rest of you are so fucking codependent or chemically confined. I cannot seem to forget those days memories make us complete. It's the way I wish you still could be all the time. All you have to do is get up for one more time. And not to feed another addiction. Don't let your lines come crossed.Something's come over me... I can't bear to see you live
Between lies, between sins that bespeak iniquity
I just want to hold your pretty hand
The rest of you can be dissolved in acid
I just want to hold your pretty hand
Purified of their sins, fornicators will be purged
Breath of god: wind of change
I ride, (and) you will meet your death... whore
I just want to hold your pretty hand
The rest of you can be dissolved in acid
You've payed for this death with all your sin. Die.Mortified by the lack of conscience,
Our sanctity bears no relevance.
Insignificance is our existence,
Hear the litany of life's persistance.
Our pleas for mercy fall upon unhearing ears,
Take my life, my soul, wipe away these bitter tears.
Vanquished in the name of your god,
One of the same to whom we all pray.
Vanquished in the name of your god,
One of the same to whom we onced prayed
Try to close my mind - From the screams I hear,
Repentance is denied, the conformation of my fear.Wake up step out of your dream come out of the mire
Realize what they do think about what you do
Is this what I live for or a dream I die for
Where is the sense what's the price you pay
Did you see their faces beaten to obey
Did you see the colours sulphur yellow, concrete gray
Did you see the eyes listless and indifferent
Oppression no resistance bodies without a spine
Sudden fall
Sometimes they talk behind your back
Is he your friend who do you trust
How far can we go who sets all the limits
Who gives us rights we've never wanted?
Sudden fall
Day by day your hands are used
To build a world called decadence
So shut your eyes close your ears
Close your mind and perish with the multitudechemical lobotomies
controls abnormalities
destroying realities
your perception is what they need
They say your problem's real
that's why you need this pill
misinformation they in sill
corruption now revealed
chorus
you've got problems
they will treat you
step inside
Medication time
Feeling alittle depressed?
Are you feeling alittle distressed?
Put our products to the test
Just ignore the side effects
Doing just as your told
pharmaceuticals taking hold
Brain function starts to slow
Intelligent life form now a drone
You've got problems
they will treat you
Step inside
Medication time [3x]
fabricating mental disease
The public they deceive
extinguish humanity
Eugenic Death misanthropy
standing next in line
Open up your eyes
those before you have died
chemical warfare genocide
You've got problems
they will kill you
step inside
Medication time[music & lyrics: Dan Swan]
When I'm in this state of mind I'm wishing I am blind
Sometimes life is more than pain to me
I feel the power of my grief, Death would be such a relief
All the secrets that I hide would die with me
Depression is my only friend. Will this torture never end?
Let me carry on to the dreamers' sky
I keep crying in my dreams. Can you hear my endless screams?
When I fade away I fade, away.
Life is just a masquerade. In dept to myself but I can't pay
Soon I'll call it all a day, away.
I've never felt what you call guilt
I still believe "do what thou wilt"
My sorrow will destroy the world I've builtLeblos liegst du da
Mit dem Geruch von Fleisch im Haar
Leblos ist dein Leib
Nur ein Beweis von Endlichkeit
Verfrbt ist deine Haut
Der Tod hat ihr den Glanz geraubt
Heute war dein letzter Tag
Dein neues Heim ein kaltes Grab
Heute war ein Neubeginn
Mein Leben verliert seinen Sinn
Du warst mein letzter Halt
Ohne dich ist alles leer und kalt
Mit deinem Blut schreib ich ein Gedicht
Verschlie deine Augen ewiglich
Du warst die Quelle meiner Kraft
Doch eine Kugel hat dich hingerafft
Mein Glauben an die Wirklichkeit
Weicht der schlimmsten Form von Einsamkeit
Und alles, was mir von dir bleibt
Sind Gedanken voller Zrtlichkeit
Wenn endlich dann die Nacht anbricht
Komm ich zu dir und hole dich
Trag es fr mich, nur ein einziges Mal
Das scharlachrote Kleid
Trag es fr mich, es schmcket dich
Das scharlachrote Kleid
..auf erstarrtem Fleisch...
Trag es, wrdevoll
Das scharlachrote Kleid
Trag es, bis die Fulnis kommt
Das scharlachrote Kleid
..auf erstarrtem Fleisch...
Der, der dich von mir nahm
Versprhte sein Blut, klebrigwarm
Sein Leichnam verlor jede Form
Keine Spur von Menschennorm
Den Rest verbrannte ich
Mit einem Lcheln auf dem Gesicht
Dein Bildnis versiegelt mein Herz
Doch Liebe besiegt jeden Schmerz
Wenn denn einst meine Stunde naht
Steig ich mit Wrde in mein Grab...
Und trag es dann fr dich, nur ein einziges Mal
Das scharlachrote Kleid
Ich trag es fr dich, es schmcket mich
Das scharlachrote Kleid
..auf erstarrtem Fleisch...
Trag es, wrdevoll
Das scharlachrote Kleid
Ich trag es, bis die Fulnis kommt
Das scharlachrote Kleid
..auf erstarrtem Fleisch...What you cannot see is not what it seems to be
Your life manufactured, to be disassembled
Disassembled...
Your world dehumanized, godless, desensitized
Your mind insignificant, god damned degradation
Falling down, breaking down
Falling down...
All comes...
Falling down, breaking down
Falling down...
All comes falling down
All comes falling down
Break...
I am your fate to bring your world of hate
To a final end for my existence
I will tear you down
Burn you to the ground
I will tear you down
Burn you to the ground
Falling down, breaking down
Falling down...
All comes...
Falling down, breaking down
Falling down...
All comes...
Falling down, breaking down
Falling down...
All comes falling down
All comes falling down
Your world will end
Your day is dead
Your time will end
Your world is deadCondemned return of the crowned one Homicide of the first son Continuous trial of the forsaken Bleeding these sores Deformity of this new cult The inbred rising against the bastard law As the visual perversion of Christ sits between eyes of the judged Masturbate the embrace of dark Urine burns the eyes of the unconverted Harvesting the knowledge of putried elegance The broken crest Evolve as the squandered birth Brittle in poise To once again nourish from this embraced death Slaughtering these plagues Of the Holy Catastrophic profit Of unkempt dignity Enter this holocaust of the free Bring us justification for vengeance Destroyer of the sick accuser The sky denied Strangling the swan of starvation As birth covers the floor of the church Carnivorous grave worms hanging from hooks Devouring the gray matter of emotion I hear the salvation of Hell calling...Hell calling One more dead, One more lost, in a plagued existence...PLagued existence The chalice that bleeds youth for all The bone of wrath that breaks all will Unproficized legion Feeling the eclipse of portals Wage your war on sin The war between the lack of it will be you who casts the first stone Blind oblivion is just the beginningIn me lies no fear. Nothing else can make me still,
so I'm calling on you now to lend me the strength.
I need to wake up again.
Slaughter my anything and my everything,
make the oncoming traffic be the end of me.
Don't let me wake up again.æ±ã®ç©ºããçã£èµ¤ã«æãããç¼çã®åã

Poems by Bartsch - November 1996)
Ich bin nicht nur eine Farbe
Sondern letztlich Siebzehn und Drei
als elfte Mglichkeit zu sterben
Eine Zeit ist zu kurz aber niemals lnger
darum lat mich meine Schulter begraben
und alle Finger einzeln auskleiden
Dann kann ich das schwarze Loch leugnen
und tief in gefaltete Keuschheit einblicken
Beim nchsten Mal lauschen wir deinem Blut
und ergeben uns in die Snde meiner strangulierten Sprotte
Halbierte Uhren lachen lautlos in deiner Nhe
und belgelaute Versuchung trbt frucht'gen Suizid
Mein Sattel rutscht morgen nicht mehr weiter
und 1955 sterben die Toten in infernalischem Vergessen
Meiner letzten Domne
Dennoch erobern wir nicht, wie Erinnyen auf Seite Zwei
sondern erschleichen unsere unbeseelte Natur
In dreifaltigem Clairobscur
Liebkosener Wahn Bewirkt zuweilen eine besondere Gegenwart
welche sich wie zu tief gesunkenes Blut in Rasierklingen verhlt
und somit unser Brustloses Glhen im Bestiarium widerhallen lt
Als meine vergifteten Schatten im Zodiakallicht entzweibrachen
und nur ein weiterer Tod den verkmpften Gerchen mifiel
Erschrak eine gehrnte Klinge in der Vollendung animalischer Lust
und der Verksung neue Glieder
Schmckten sich grobem Gewande
Bacchanten erklommen eisige Schlnde
doch gebaren die zarte Verdmmnis nicht
Notzucht erblindet in oviparer Todessehnsucht
und das Nein gegen Gott & Luzifer is erdacht
Ein ruchloser Zwang erfordet willkrliche Gefahr,
wenn die Totenklage einer glcklos verschiedenen Maid
blulich Anarchie ber die Pforten der nackten Begierde trufelt
Um in uralten Anreicherung des Siedepunktes mein Leben zu vergeben,
wird der blasphemische Ursprung aller Grabfsser zum Untergang gereichenSalida

The king of agony and fear,
he is the eldest of all kings.
He takes the weak and bows to the strong
his mercyless majesty, yet invincted.

He is immortal, his pinions carry winds

Where will be the border?
And who will draw your line?
In your life there is no order
You just lost track of time
This is your direction
You will never have satisfaction
Intentions, although they were noble
Dreams however, could not be shared
The only choice left
Is to turn away...
Will you ever have enough?
How to explain
It is purity I seek?
In a life with no emotion?
But one has to realise
I need to hang on to a dream
With no emotion
Is this your direction?
You will never have satisfaction
Will you never ever have enough
In a life
With no emotion
- So much for this love
With no emotion
- So much for this love
How will you get further?
For you there is no way,
Is this the way
You want to die tonight?
Our feelings and words
Never meant the same
Where will be your border?
And who will draw your line?
In your life there is no order
You just lost track of time
Time, never was on my side
How to explain
It is purity I seek?
Is this the way you want to die?Furious winds, sky grows black, circum polar vortex
Weather changing patterns causing solar storms
Living on the San Andreas fault line
I feel the earth shake, ground splits open wide
Massive tidal waves, seaports flood
Power lines fall, bridges rip apart
Cars drop into the sea, crimson stench rises up
Obscuring the light, gas lines burst out in flames
Water starts gushing everywhere
Sharks wait to claim their prey
No one will survive on this day
The West Coast slips into the sea
The worst quake in world historyYou say it's not good enough for you
But then you say it's not good enough for anyone but you
You say you just have to be left alone
So now you're alone
So you curse me and you hit me
And you claw me to bleed
Then you want me and you want me
And your want turns into your need
Submission is free, it's just what we need
When I talk, you'd better listen to me
Submission is free, it's just what we need
When I talk, you'd better listen to me
So I grip you by the back of your mane
You say it's no good without a little bit of pain
You say I do nothing but hurt, I'll show you hurt
So you curse me and you hit me
And you claw me to bleed
Then you want me and you want me
And your want turns into your need
Submission is free, it's just what we need
When I talk, you'd better listen to me
Submission is free, it's just what we need
When I talk, you'd better listen to me
Wake up, to me you're all just slaves
Now here's some medicine so you will behaveVoices inside
Keep on twisting my thoughts
things that are rationally right
sre crooked to me
but I make it work my way
the thoughts inside
are painfully and cruel
but they are a fuel so strong
that it makes my life go wrong
I seek their pain to ease my mind
it makes pain in my head seem less bright
and brings me closer to delight I feel my past
getting control over me when will I be freed
from this misery when my mind let me be
it seems that no
body understands
the pain that's in my head
it's only eased by death
it's the only way to live
it seems that no
body understands
that chaos in my life
it's hurting me so much
I want to hurt somebody else
a memory of burning flesh
is the deepest thought for me
the shadows keep hurting me
it's blackening all of thisSanta lucia comadre de los ciegos
HabÃ­a hombre que daba baÃ±os de mecos
El hueso siempre crecÃ­a
Con la vista de santa lucia
El dijo "chupa mi verga"
Ella dijo "!soy madre de pobres!"
Santa lucia se arranco los ojos
Con sus uÃ±as filosas
No quiso pito del buey
No quiso pecar
Santa lucia quiero tu ojos
Comadre de ciegosIt's something inside
It's hard to put your finger on
There's no reason to hide
So be proud you're in control
Not everyone can
You're one of a few
Neglected by man
No one really knew
The seekers of force, turned their heads away
Bid on the wrong horse, were only led astray
Mentally controlled, powers beyond reach
You keep it untold, all you do is tease
[Chorus:]
It's mine - by inheritance
no one can take it away
Why play - why take the chance?
Why not just make them pay?
An invisible touch, developed in time
And if things get too much
You change it with your mind
It's not to be seen
No one is to know
It starts like a dream, then you let it grow
[Repeat chorus]
[Bridge:]
It's like the rain
You can't prevent from falling down on your face
It's not like pain
You can't ignore it, still there is no trace it's capturing
Reaching for you
There's nothing that you can do
Terrifying
You can feel the ice from inside of you
You've got no remorse, once you've increased your prey
No sense of divorce
When you hear them pray
It's easy as hell
No need to try hard
So why won't you tell "no"
You always state
[Repeat chorus (*2 times)](Words: Ihsahn/ Music: Ihsahn & Samoth/

Ravens caw in reverence
Anthems to the Welkin at dusk
In celebration of the few
The kin
Beyond flesh
Beyond words
Those of the core
Beyond gods
As gods received
I float among them
On wings once broken
Now gleaming black
I share their song
Of words unspoken
Cries of the past
In times of fiendish tempest
Bloodlust turns against the coil
Hungry to the fall
I greet the pit
Blind Savage
Cursing Life
Yet, at the moment of my final step
The hands and golden chains are given
Bidding me that which can not be deprived
The bonds of trust and unity
Till the end
Brethen and sisters of my circle
I acclaim thee all
When guiding stars are clouded and deranged
Fear not to take my hand
The bonds of trust and unity
As gods received
Till the end[lyrics: Sundin, Stanne]
In orbit they pass around you - the memories from abandoned past
Images from within your mind bring unknown feelings into your veins
Delve into thy twillight past, a voyage done before
The borderland 'twixt life and death - existing evermore
Emerging from material guise - an ever-living soul
Thy spirit lives forever more, in spite of aim or goal
The forces of your vital mind deteriates vagely
as you're about to pass away The darkness that
surrounds you fades...
You reach out to touch, to feel the eternal
forgivness for thy impure soul
Desperation fills your mind - approach the centre
Centre of infernal salvation and infernal death
Enter to the plain of life, to knowledge loomed through time
An ever-living certainty where life is formed to chime
Foolishness and wisdom walk gently hand hand in hand
Embraced in darkest universe as contraries blend as one
Fear fills your mind on this ongoing journey
journey to a thousand secrets untold
Credlous at first to this place of wonder
Wonder's so real - it could be an illusion
Through dark veils of destiny - Realm of shades revealed
Through dark veils of destiny - Infinite life concealed
Your soul now levitates slowly and below your body fades
Your conciousness remains but thy skin will soon rot away
Visions from an obscure rality appear as your soul departs
This once so undisturbed and now frail and feeble world
Brought forth, the abyss now appears - foulmouthed temptations call me near
Dark visions laughing over me - if swollowed I will cease to be
Tempted to this world beyond - eager to break the bond
The sacred promise of an earthly stay - now broken as you writhe in dismay
Come to where all life descends in brimful harmony
Cautious, interlacing, they engrave what they shall be
All bounds cannot be broken or confusion will prevail
- lifeless dark eternity of chaos and despair
Indescribable light descends between spheres
Spheres that behold that nondescript fear
Thought of the sins that were done in the past
the past is forgotten and the present will last
Through dark veils of destiny - Realm of shades revealed
Through dark veils of destiny - Infinite life concealed
Floating through these halls of light, emotions burst within
Pure beauty of divinity enrobes remaining sin
Alone, enthralled, I bow this force, paternal majesty
Freed from anguish, freed from hate - into my destiny
Into the void of tranquillity
Through the rise and fall of worlds, one greater mind prevails
Conjuring new creations as it watches the old ones fail
Eternal coil of time and place - reality and tale
The answers to all questions hide within this astral vale
Passed through tranquillity - aeons now flow away
Claimants of destiny - death can no more hold sway
Forced to return - departure of soul
Material world - arrival as toldMorbid paroxysm leads to despair
Insanity springs eternal
Lucidity fades to its demise...
Disintegration of the soul
To the existential void
Sanity ordains me not
A servant of paramount chaos
On perpetual orbit in the cosmosBrothers we are
From each other never far
Cause our hearts beat as one
United in the battle to hail the holy Metal
Kingdom Reitermania will come
Soon everyone can hear the freedom call
Reitermaniacs will never fall
We are the hope, feel the mystical might
And fight with us in the army of light
Can you feel the power
We will push it to the max
All for one and one for all
We are Reitermaniacs
Our will is unbreakable
We know no lie we won 't hide
Life is our fight and we ride on to guide
The army of light
We search for the glory
To give reasons for a new history
Soon we will reach our aim
Reitermania will not just be a flameDeath is coming fast
She's my only faith
And no one will be ignored
This is a sick quest
I know I'm insane
But I don't want to be cured
Relentessly
I'm the desecration master
In search of the ultra violence
Addicted to the taste of blood
Hunting prey certainly
Relentessly
I need to see and fell humans suffering
Eyes full of fear imploring my mercy
No need to use weapons that kill too fast
I use my own hands to touch the petrified skin
It's almost possible to watch the light of life,
Vanishing and turning into a fancus orgasm
Ususally using rape for female creatures
I ejaculate inside the dead body
But my satisfaction quickly disappear
Until the next time I dream of massacre
Satan will guide me forever
The sacret face of god will be traked downThe Howls And The Barks And The Growls

Made your living till the day you retired
Stealing, taking, using, and abusing
Now for all your sins that you are
accused of
Cruelty, greed, dishonesty, and hate
Forever locked outside the pearly gates
Begging, praying, pleading, and bleeding
Won't extinguish the fire you're feeling!
They say when you die you go to hell
But when you're dead it's too late to
tell you
You're left to rot in your wooden cell
Am I in Heaven, or am I in Hell?
Am I in Heaven, or am I just in Hell?
Chorus
Only death decides for sure
Don't you know only death decides...
Where you go!
Pain, sadness, fear
Is all you've ever given throughout
the years
Thievery, intimidation, and assault
Tools of the trade until death puts a halt
Because you're deceiving, unfeeling,
and misleading
The world is final, there's no use in
appealing
The culmination and sudden realization
It's all real, no hallucination!
They say when you die you go to hell
But when you're dead it's too late to
tell you
You're left to rot on your wooden cell
Am I in Heaven, or am I in Hell?
Am I in Heaven, or am I just in Hell?
Chorus
Only death decides where
you go?
Can't you see what death decides for me?
You'll never know until death decides!
Dealer, pusher, conniver
It's no surprise you fell paralyzed
Felon, loser, and misuser
You're dead broke, a washed-up boozer
Misery, disaster, catastrophy
Exactly how you knew the end would be
Torture, terror, and nightmare
Is what you'll receive when death comes
in three's
They say when you die you go to hell
But when you're dead it's too late to
tell you!
You're left to rot in your wooden cell
Am I Heaven, or am I in Hell?
Am I Heaven, or am I just in Hell?
Chorus
Only death decides for sure
Don't you know only death decides for me?
You'll never know until death
decides...
Where you go!I got a letter in the mail just the other day
Opened it up, this is what it had to say:
"Wouldn't you please give us the pleasure
Of having you at our table tonite?
From, the donner family"
We've been hungry for such a long time
And we've eaten our dogs and rawhide
We've got half of our family on ice
They would not want the rest of us to die
They would not want the rest of us to die
They don't care
They would not have us starve to death
We're so cold
We're freezing and there's nothing left
They don't care
I'm sure that they wouldn't mind
It's so bad
Half of us are snow blind
It's too late now, we can never go back
We can make up for the protein we lack
Four days of no food have left us all weak
I feel like I can't stand on my own two feet
My own two feet, my own two feet
We've been waiting for such a long time
For some word of help or some sign
That someone's coming to our rescue
Until then, we'll do what we have to
Until then, we'll do what we have to
They don't care
They would not have us die this way
It's like this
We have to find some food today
They don't care
They knew what we were going through
They don't care
This is what it's come to
We never felt like we could really do it
Now weare just thankful we all lived through it
We ate those people because we were hungry
Yeah, we're survivors of the donner family
The donner family
We've been hungry for such a long, long time
And we've eaten our dogs and rawhide
We've got half of our family on ice
They would not want the rest of us to die
They would not want the rest of us to die
They don't care
They would not have us starve to death
We're so cold
We're freezing and there's nothing left
They don't care
I'm sure that they wouldn't mind
It's so bad
Half of us are snow blind
I got a letter in the mail just the other day
Opened it up, this is what it had to say:
"wouldn't you please give us the pleasure
Of having you at our table tonite?
From, the donner family"
The donner family

[Lyrics: brecht]Into the battle we ride again
Against the dark one, against the terror, suffering and pain
We're the Valar, Lords of the West
The light of trees still shines in our eyes from the past
Across the sea, into the north
There dwells the evil, the enemy we must fought
The elves cursed his name for all the time
Now he will feel the anger of those, who remained divine
Armies of evil, orcs and dark men
Scattered away as their fortress fell
Whirlpool of battle changed Middle Earth
To still remind the victory of ValinorI glare at what has become
Under these darkened grey skies
I cry out for my death
To seek the land of horror and pain
These piercing blades of steel
Is the way for us to die
The sword cuts through the sky
But no cries are heard, not one
I forever close my eyes
Immortal I have become
All life seeps from my skin
My ambition is now complete
I am the ruthless lord
Of this ancient realm
I spread this plague of fears
As a saviour eternally damned
In a world where the skies reign blood
And the pitiful and weak are none
All glory shall come again
In these forms of purest black
We praise the chants of war
We slaughter the sick and weak
Raise our swords to kill
For our Reich of impurity and hateWrists are severed
The deepest cuts are traced in red
So beautiful
The separation of her flesh from the razor
Feeling a pain she's never known
Like broken glass
Draining the blood that's running cold
She tasted eternity
It's kiss like a last goodbye
As she's taken herself from me
Forever abandoned
Eyes held open, the bitter taste of blood and sweat
The emptiness
The suffocates a final breath, endless silence
That dulls the pain beneath her skin
Her vacant eyes watching the blood that's running thin
She tasted eternity
Its kiss like a last goodbye
She's taken herself from me
FOREVER ABANDONED!I walk through the buildings of the capital hills,
Walk through the sightseeing floor,
the escalator was filled
with lucky, light shining faces in a glittering mall
which spot the label signs on, on the wall
A blister infect is crawling out of the roofs,
out of the brain soups
and holds the white flag against the pain
in the amount of business and money instinct
lurks the most though and resistant brain
I asked every prowler that I met in our loose youth
They talk of disaster and band politic mood
I'm not alone in the desert of freaks in this town
as a long legged lowlive in my gown
Drink the electric scum, electric scum, electric scum
Let us dive into the crystal ball shine as pantomime
This is my tent, almost a design
Just the look in oneself can change the bad times
Let us dive into the crystal ball shine as pantomime
This is my tent, just the look can change these times
Drink the electric scum, electric scum, electric scum
Let us dive into the crystal ball shine as pantomime
This is my tent, almost a design
Just the look in oneself can change the bad times
Let us dive into the crystal ball shine as pantomime
This is my tent, just the look can change these rhymesWasted Time
-----------
Words can't say
The way I feel
Words can't save me
Faith has been broken
Time after Time
Harsh words are spoken
By those who deny
Harsh words are spoken
Lies always lies
He whispered "Be kind to me
Come kill me one more time
I'm lost in bitter rage"
Why, tell me why
Holding on to the pain
Holding on, watch life fade
Holding on to the past
Holding on, to Wasted Time
I can't see through delusion
Oh I'm trying
Isn't life strange when you're living a lie.Hallowed be the fatherland
God he knows
How long I'd been away
From here I did start for a search so
Full of decease
I still hear my cryouts
From the old cellar's inside
Born in the days of medieval
My inner voice
Is always asking why
I came from nowhere
Without a task, without a name
No fear of evil
Fate, so god please lead me through
Forgotten realms
Mysterious dreams
In sunless rooms I'd sworn
I'll finish what I started, once
I'll find my holy grail
In the holy land
Returning of the miracles
It's my own requiem
The jester's tears
They are inside me
Agony's the script for my requiem
Returning of the miracles
It's my own requiem
Is the script already written
Jester's tears I cry
Yes, I cry
I went out of my mind
In desert lands
Insanity's pawn
Out of control
Much too long I've been isolated
From my thoughts
Enclosed by the leader's spell
Bewildered to marc
As a glory knight
And I tried
Still I hear the scream of thousands:
"Crucify, crucify
Take it all
Our gold, our home, our life,
But we didn't kill your Christ!!
Reach out for your holy grail
Enslave us and make us
Your god's sacrifice!!"
Returning of the miracles
It's my own requiem
The jester's tears
They are inside me
Agony's the script for my requiem
Returning of the miracles
It's my own requiem
Is the script already written
Jester's tears I cry
Yes, I cry
Still I'm confused
If I was dreaming
Too late I realized
I'd been another fool
I pay the price
Returning of the miracles
It's my own requiem
The jester's tears
They are inside me
Agony's the script for my requiem
Returning of the miracles
It's my own requiem
Is the script already written
Jester's tears I cryYou're the worst of all,
With all your accusations and compunction
I can't suffer this duress,
From someone so deprayed and selfish
You embody all that I've been through
Without you I am sure I will be loved
My existence conforms to your distress
Your ambition, the cause of mine
A disruption, I'm nothing, even less
Misfortunes never come singly and I was there to stay
You don't allow me a single place,
Nor any love into your lives
An unperceived, annoying presence you'd rather ignore
But in my life you know you'll leave... a beautiful emptiness
Where you used to be
Impotent screams will turn
Into the love of silence
My liberation, then silence,
Will be perfect and pure
It's all in my dreams,
I'll remove you
And all our mutual disgust
In my dreams,
I solve the problem by removing it
My wish is to see you grovel,
Like you once forced me to
There's no other way, here's my course of life
A path without the sickening trace of you
I need the beauty of a cleared, pure world
This eternal interruption of your rash life can save me
You don't allow me a single place,
Nor any love into your lives
An unperceived, annoying presence you'd rather ignore
But in my life you know you'll leave... a beautiful emptiness
It's sad to feel you don't believe in love,
It's sad that you're so cold
And I'll be the same,
If you keep on poisoning my life
Drowning in self-sacrificing visions
When you're gone, then we will all be released
It's sad my life has been like hell so far,
It's sad that you're the cause
And I'll be cured in this beautiful, empty world
Floating, floating away with your perilous visions and hate
When you're gone, silence will fill up the emptiness
When you're gone, we all will be released
In my dreams I shall rinse my body and soul
My wish,
The accomplishment lies here before me in my hands
I will be released from your accusing eyes
And torrents of verbal abuse
You'll know the causes are your own mistakes
While life flows out of you
and exempts me forever!My love, wrap your hands around my heart
free me from the frost that enveloped my life
my love, reach out your arms and pull me close
let us tread in silence as their world drowns beneath
My love, wrap your hands around my heart
free me from the frost that enveloped my life
my love, reach out your arms and pull me close
let us tread in silence as their world drowns beneath
If being alive is just to survive
i'd choose to drown in the turbulent seas
if being alive is just to survive
a glacial pace comes to an end
It brings on the floods that are the truest of tests
a glacial pace comes to an end
let our love guide us through the torrents ahead
if being alive is just to survive
i'd sink within you for eternity
a glacial pace comes to an end
and it brings on the floods that are the truest of tests
a glacial pace comes to an end
let our love guide us through the torrents ahead
don't give up on me
my love, wrap your hands around my heart
free me from the frost that enveloped my life
my love, reach out your arms and pull me close
let us tread in silence as their world drowns beneath
a glacial pace
a glacial pace
a glacial pace
a glacial paceBlack blood. Dust and ashes.
In the spiders web the fly is lost
Dead eyes in darkness prying
Within my corpse the worms still crawl
Bleached bones 'round my throne lie scattered
Where life once bloomed now silence rule
Faceless A dark god now risen
To purge the earth, to thin the heard
Brought to life in silence
Out of worm infested graves
In darkness I've risen
To curse the world again
The Earth is dead...
The black wounds never healing
Welcome death, I've come to you
The hellish pain increasing
My legacy I've brought to you
Brought to life in silence
Out of worm infested graves
In darkness I've risen
To curse the world again
Plaguebringer
The Earth is dead...Running wild crazy and free
Being anything I want to be
Got no time for hanging around
Ain't nobody gonna tie me down
Spend my time doing what I please
Take the world on, got 'em on their knees
People think that I'm no good
Won't do the things they think I should
Life's confusing me and messin' me around
Don't know if I'm ever coming down
Got to get your mind out of my head
Leave me alone and live your life instead
Play my music way too loud
My hair's too long, I don't fit in the crowd
Leather jacket and denim jeans
Metal studs run down the seams
Times are hard but I don't care
'Cause if I want it I'll take my share
Talkin' life on a bit too steep
Outta my way or I'll bury you deep
Gotta stop pushin' shovin' me around
Gotta stop tryin' to put me down
Got to get your mind out of my head
Leave me alone and live your life instead
Lotta people got a lot to say
But I'm doing things my own way
'Cause I'm free as the wind
Maybe someday they will understand
Just why I choose to be my own man
It doesn't matter I ain't gonna change
The master plan should be rearranged
Breaking rules is what I do
On the bad side it's a better view
If it's too loud then you're too old
Get the hell out 'cause you've been told
Gotta stop pushin' shovin' me around
Gotta stop tryin' to put me down
Got to get your mind out of my head
Leave me alone and live your life instead
Lotta people got a lot to say
But I'm doing things my own way
'Cause I'm free as the windI have seen how the same human souls
Wander through different bodies
Drifting through the centuries
When flesh decayed
For ages drifting in the wind
Through landscapes unknown
Among worlds where the suns never die
Where moonlight is bright as day
Beyond timeless void
Beyond all the spheres
In a realm where the powers of earth
Are bound in the fathomless sky
An endless journey
Perpetual suffering
When heartbeat has died
And earthly life has ended
The trip through the emptiness begins
Vultures free your bones
From flesh and blood
Make your spirit soar
Your soul lost in space
Struggling for a new life
Awaiting rebirth
To be captures
In a human body againMylaem, e nie byem w porzdku

I entered the Darkside,
Evil arrived far from the North,
I known the might of Demonlord.Bloodied, cleaved and mutilated
Dead bodies amputated
Man's bloody inclination
God's final abdication
Angels weep on bended knee
So beings the tyranny
The fallen one will rise again
So ends the time of man
My will be done
Now they death day come
Never more the sound of laughter
Misery for ever after
The cries of suffering
Are what the death day bring
No one gives the benediction
All hear the malediction
Lucifer makes his accent
No words for man's lament
My will be done
Now they death day come
On black wings I take to the sky
Scouring the land
Rejoicing in and laughing at
The folly of man
Centuries of hatred
Centuries of fear
Have led you to the end of days
And the one you so revere
The gates of heaven have been shattered
Wings of angels torn and tattered
All due to mankind's thirst
For war so well rehearsed
When you see my demon eyes
Too late to apologize
Can you feel the irony?
War for all eternity
My will be done
Now they death day comeAs faces crept in from the room next door
to my eyes I let a razor race swiftly down my armless body
towards the clays of hell
Blink to separate desecration from pain
Toward the clays of hell the acrid tears and razors race
The faces become more defined
as the scent of my sweat and vomit draws them nearer
Blink to separate desecration from pain
Blink to separate the face from the name
Another flash
Another face
Blink once for the pills
Blink twice for the shame
In the eyes of the canary these faces (remain)Take my fingers and take my hands
Save me from myself, selfish distractions
Board the windows and lock all doors
Save me from my flaws, misguided solutions
I'm always walking on the easiest path
And I know that road, it leads to nothing
Aligned my footsteps and led me to the route
That you've laid for me, ready and waiting
Why have I turned my back so many times
On a clear direction?
Why have I listened to the whispers
That are from the dark
Take my fingers and take my hands
And save me from myself, selfish distractions
Board the windows and lock all doors
Save me from my flaws, misguided solutions
It never seems to matter how many times
That I fail on my own convinced that I'm stronger
Your gentle hand is reaching leading me safely away
From the dark, the fiction in my mind
Why have I turned my back so many times
On a clear direction?
And once again, I realize that I'm short of the goal
I've wandered so far from where I should be
I've led myself astray for what?
For comfort? There is no comfort here
Carry me home, carry me home
There is no [Incomprehensible] comfort here
Take my fingers and take my hands
And save me from myself, selfish distractions
Board the windows and lock all doors
And save me from my flaws, misguided solutionsSpeak now old soul disagreeing
Your choice soon lays
Speak now old soul
Your choice will soon be yours
Speak your time
Darkness ?
Darkness ?

A quest for the brave falls in the fog
A light shines from a distant land of ghosts
They don't want you there
They don't want me here
Remember my name
The machine is crumbled in
A quest for the brave falls in the fog
A light shines from a distant land of ghosts
They don't want you there
They don't want me here
Remember my name
The machine is crumbled in
A quest for the brave falls in the fog
A light shines from a distant land of ghosts
The dark will bring me back
Darkness ?
Darkness ?
A hollow ? room lifts me from its lights
Nothing in focus, carry us today is a ?
Accept all we are given
It is all here for a reason
A golden lever
A choice of gold or velvet
Do I go on or follow the ropes in the smoke?
Accept all we are given
It is all here for a reason
One last search
Our shallow minds embrace this dream
One last search
To kneel in the famine room

One last search
To kneel in the famine room
One last search
One last search

Just with IRON FIST!
Don't ask my why
Hate me, hunt me,
But you'll never get me!
Be careful, I'm waiting for you
I'll smash your fuckin skull
.... And eat your brain!
You won't need it anyway.[Couplet 1:]
You know da world has many problems,
but you you don't care
You think you're simply da best, but at last you won't share
You smile, yes you smile, and you criticise the others
I know your simply da best, but da best to kill the earth
[Couplet 2:]
Crushing, you're crushing, you're crushing the others and you don't
Care for their rights, for their business, or for their life
Spoiling, you're spoiling, you're spoiling all da place and you don't
Care, you don't respect, your mother, da mother earth
You're ignorant, power's in da unity
I want to get you out, to kill da pain inside of me
You're ignorant, power's in da unity
I want to get you out, to kill da pain inside of me
Get out da bastards [x4]
Human people have to overcome their egocentrism
I wish I will kill da pain
I'll kill da pain
I wish, I wish, I will kill da pain

Oh, fuck, why not?!It's inside my brain
It drives me insane
It's eating me alive
Into the pits of black
A faithless payback?
Evil twisted mind!
Twisted reality
Makes me feel low
Blood driven infinity
Welcome to the freak show!
The symphony - is killing me...
The symphony
The savage symphony of terror
Narrow downright lad
Voices in my head
Strapped and buried
Killing deep dark hole
Burning lonely soul?
Prohibition is your foe!!!I'm running up a thousand steps
An endless stairway to another plane
I must be fast, my time is short
I hear the cracking sound of a million stones
I must climb the staircase of the highest tower
where at the end, a blaze of flame shall burn
Run to the doorway that brings me back to my domain
Run through the fire and take my leap of faith
[Chorus]
It's falling
Black tower of centuries old
Spiral Tower of the Universe
It's falling
Black tower of centuries old
Spiral Tower of the Universe
I am a traveler between the worlds
My art is ancient and kept unknown
I'm granted passage to different realms
Bust I must be back on Solstice Eve
I must climb the staircase of the highest tower
where at the end, a blaze of flame shall burn
Run to the doorway that brings me back to my domain
Run through the fire and take my leap of faith
[Chorus]
It's falling
Black tower of centuries old
Spiral Tower of the Universe
It's falling
Black tower of centuries old
Spiral Tower of the Universe
The fall of the Spiral Tower
Spiral Tower of the Universe
The Twilight Tower between domains
Is now collapsing and nothing will remain
I must be fast, my time is short
I walk through the portal once and for all
I must climb the staircase of the highest tower
where at the end, a blaze of flame shall burn
Run to the doorway that brings me back to my domain
Run through the fire and take my leap of faith
[Chorus]
It's falling
Black tower of centuries old
Spiral Tower of the Universe
It's falling
Black tower of centuries old
Spiral Tower of the Universe
It's falling
Black tower of centuries old
Spiral Tower of the Universe
It's falling
Black tower of centuries old
Spiral Tower of the UniverseOh God I feel I have lost my flock
We are scattered and without reason
There is no strength in our stock
The wolves pick up on our weak scent
Trapped by a system that heralds discrimination
Underneath an unclean sun your caste will be revealed
Wallow in servility your branded the Musahar
Toiling while the hours pass so slowly like drifting dust
Held by laws obscene by all is our unfortunate gift to the world
Victims of a religion that blackens me as my neighbors' slave
Bodies filled with poverty burns slow above the fire
Violence from the provocation of shadows touching higher castes
Oh God I feel I have lost my flock
We are scattered and without reason
There is no strength in our stock
The wolves pick up on our scent
Inside on hallowed sins I pray
To save me from this world that wants to commit suicide
[Solo: Tony]
Inside on hallowed sins I pray
To save me from this world that wants to commit suicide
Oh God I feel I have lost my flock
We are scattered and without reason
There is no strength in our stock
The wolves pick up on our weak scentWhat would you say if I threw it all away
The life that I lead, could it be more surreal
Searching in my mind in the order to find some sense of reality
I fear that I am beginning to lose what's left of my sanity
Awake again full of bloodstains on my hands
I wonder where I have been, and whose death I have foreseen
Breaking my will with the purpose to kill all shreds of humanity
To lose the control of body and soul is my main anxiety
Something's coming over me
My reality slowly slipping away
I just can't remember but can't seem to forget
Who I am blacked out again
Can't longer say what is real and what is a dream
The demon is rising up from far deep down within
Searching in my mind in the order to find some sense of reality
I fear that I am beginning to lose what's left of my sanity
Something's coming over me
My reality slowly slipping away
I just can't remember but can't seem to forget
Who I am blacked out again
I have fallen into the depths of sin
Where humanity ends and pain begins
Breaking free from this torment I must do
If I told you my secret, oh would you believe it's trueIn your dreams, does everything seem
Black and white?
Dark as night?
Does morning seem far away?
Cold and damp?
Racing back to where your world is safe
Nightmare, always the same for me
Falling, throw me a line
Save me, give me the sense to see
Nightmare, never come near to me
Far away, the warm light of day
Round and round
Fear sinking down to when you were a child
Run and hide
Locked up inside
The horror seems so real
Nightmare, always the same for me
Falling, throw me a line
Save me, give me the sense to see
Nightmare, never come near to me
Nightmare, always the same for me
Falling, throw me a line
Save me, give me the sense to see
Nightmare, never come near to me
Nightmare the horror seems so real
Throw me a line
I'm fallin' fallin' fallin'
Ever so real to me, always haunting me
In my dreams everything seemsTruth in lying
Never can tell
Words that twist and betray
Lore of secrets
Casting her spell
Charms to lure you away
Sorceress
Master of the Sejd
She'll light the way
Her eyes will leave a mark
Her dreams will fill the heart
Her name brings out desire
Riddles in the dark
She'll light the spark
Falcon wings forever soaring
Goddess of the fallen warriors home
Fateful Beauty Glowing and pure
Turn your gaze down in awe
Golden Mistress Sowing the need
Sacrifice to receive
Maiden of the shield guides you ashore
The prize of war
Ride on silver wing
Let valkyries take you home
Her gift is of love
A chance to be reborn
Falcon wings forever soaring
Goddess of the fallen warriors home
Falcon wings forever soaring
Goddess of the fallen warriors home
Freja's choice is always glory
Borne upon the blood-stained wings of war
Blood-stained wings of warOriginally performed by Stevie Wonder
No New Years Day to celebrate,
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away,
No first of spring, no song to sing,
In fact, here's just another ordinary day.
I just called to say I love you;
I just called to say how much I care;
I just called to say I love you,
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart.
No April rain, no flowers' bloom,
No wedding Saturday within the month of June.
But what it is is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you.
No summer's high, no warm July,
No harvest moon to light one tender August night,
No autumn breeze, no falling leaves,
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies.My friends I stand before you
To tell a truth most dire
They lust a traitor in our midst
Who haven't vote the captain's ire
He don't deserve no mercy
We ought to shoot him with a gun
But I am not an evil man
So first let's have a little fun
We'll tie that scoundrel to a rope
And throw it overboard
Drag him underneath the ship
A terrifying deadly trip
Keelhaul, that filthy landlubber, send him down to the depths below
Make that bastard walk the plank with a bottle of rum and a yo-ho-ho
Keelhaul, that filthy landlubber, send him down to the depths below
Make that bastard walk the plank with a bottle of rum and a yo-ho-ho
I will not say what he has done
His sins are far to grave to tell
It's not my place to judge a man
But boy he will burn in hell
The sharks will dine up on his flesh
And davie jones will have his soul
Take his money and his hat
He won't need them where he's gonna go
And first lets tie him to a rope
And throw him overboard
Drag him underneath the ship
A terrifying deadly trip
Keelhaul, that filthy landlubber, send him down to the depths below
Make that bastard walk the plank with a bottle of rum and a yo-ho-ho
Keelhaul, that filthy landlubber, send him down to the depths below
Make that bastard walk the plank with a bottle of rum and a yo-ho-ho
We'll tie that scoundrel to a rope
And throw him overboard
Drag him underneath the ship
A terrifying deadly trip
Keelhaul, that filthy landlubber, send him down to the depths below
Make that bastard walk the plank with a bottle of rum and a yo-ho-ho
Keelhaul, that filthy landlubber, send him down to the depths below
Make that bastard walk the plank with a bottle of rum and a yo-ho-hoSigns from the past, watching eyes
From an intime age
The door to the unknown is opened
For a long time
There's only a step
Where the knowledge of thousand of years
And dying stones' sound are
Your soul is waiting silent
Signs from the past
They're lying in front of us, but the truth distruls
Signs from the past
A message that we have never understood
Signs from the past
An ancient, an ancient sound from the last world
Signs from the past
Another hundred of years is flying away
The past remains a white stain
This way leads to the oblivionOn the day of the De Danann rule,
Breas ruled the pagan lands.
He led his people as a fool,
under the shadow of Balors hand.
The Tuatha De lived a life of pain,
in body and spirit their weakness grew,
as though their battle was in vain,
this can't go on the people knew.
Dagda, All father, once God and provider,
fell into disgrace with the king.
The food he recieved would not feed a spider.
-The best pieces, Cridinbel would win.
Aengus was shoked by the state of his father,
"Crindinbel must die", He did say.
He put gold in the food, and the food on the platter,
Crindinbel fell dead on that sacred day.
Nuada awoke from the otherworld dream,
his hand was forged by the gods,
water was brought from the healing stream,
"You will be king?". -He nods.
Breas journied to the Fomor lands.
And met his Fomorian father.
They held each other in their hands,
their kinship would stay hereafter.
The Il-Dana came to meet with Nuada,
the greatest hero of the Tuatha De,
The Fomor arrived for their early tax,
these savages Il-Dana did slay.
Balor declared war and sent his tribes,
Nuada prepared as did the scribes
Samhain approached and tensions were high,
Dagda went to the Fomor spy.
Breas the dishonoured led a Fomor invasion
the Il-Dana won this first battle occasion.
Back to Moytura the De Danann returned,
they set up camp and the pagan fires burned,
the first day of battle was a mighty event,
druids were chanting as the scouts forth were sent.
A great clash of shields,
cries of was frenzy,
blood fell on fields,
each warrior the enemy.
Nuada killed Indech,
the king of the Fomor,
the worm god was unleashed
with a taste for war.
Nuada raised his sword of light,
against the mighty Cromcruach,
Balor caught uhim in his sight,
Nuada died a hero's death.
But Balor to the ground was cast,
Il-Dana was the new high king,
De Danann heroes won at last,
never again to laugh and sing.The seven signs are arising
From the depths of hell
The wrath of God awaiting
Yet twisted minds rebel
The heavens will all open
And death will fly free
The end of time will strike us
From life to insanity
Listen to my words
Listen to my words
The seas are now dying
The first sign is done
Beginning of our sorrows
Blackened is our sun
The second seal is broken
And final war has come
Famine now upon us
The third sign succumb
Listen to my words
Listen to my words
Opened is the fourth seal
Behold your f***ing death
Beasts of earth are stalking
All life will soon suppress
Arisen is the fifth sign
For martyrs that were slain
Stars of heaven fallen
For the sixth sign of pain
The moon turns to blood
The people flee in herds
This time has been foreseen
So listen to my f***ing words
Heed this warning
For the time has come
Evil surrounds us
To destroy our earth
Fear the seventh sign
The anti-Christ's birth
True death
Into the chaos!
(guitar solo)
Listen to my
Listen to my
Listen to my words!My vision is hazy, there's clouds all around
I'm writing these last words for death is abound
Now I'm high in the sky, my last trip I'll take
I'm sorry my family, for all my mistakes
[Chorus]
As I look around at the fear in their eyes
All are praying 'cause they're gonna die
With all this chaos, it's getting harder to breathe
I'm trying to write this for something to leave
Now my family and friends, you knew me so well
I hope there's a story for someone to tell
[Chorus]
To my wife and my kids, I will be in your sight
When you see a star, it's me shining bright
I see the end is near, the grounds coming fast
So just keep my memories, our love will last
[Chorus: x2]Now we're Anthrax and we take no shit
And we don't care for writing hits
The sound you hear is what we like
I'll steal your pop-tarts like I stole your
Socks!
No man, what's the matter with you?
I'll get it the next time, I mean it
Charlie, beat the beats, the beats you beat
The only thing harder's the smell of my feet
So listen up 'cause you might get dissed
Go drain the lizard or take a
Chair!
Damn, watch the beat!
I'm on your case, I'm in your face
Kick you and your father back in place
Step up sucker, understand
Don't you know,
I'm the man! I'm the man!
I'm so bad I should be in detention!
I'm the man!
Shut up!
We've got real def rhythms and fresh new jams
And ya think we got egos but we're just hams
Scott plays stick ball and likes to skate
Frank is never on time he's always
Sleeping!
"Late!"
Drink the drinks, the drinks they drank
I put my money in the bank
They cut their crack, they offer joints
We don't do drugs, do you get our
Meaning!
"Point!" "Point!" Watch the beat!
I'm on your case, I'm in your face
Kick you and your father back in place
Step up sucker, understand
Don't you know,
I'm the man! I'm the man!
I'm bad! I'm so bad I should be in detention!
I'm the man!
Shut up!
For a heavy metal band raps a different way
We like to different and not cliche
They say rap and metal can never mix
Well all of them can suck our
Sexual organ in the lower abdominal area!
No man, it's "dicks!"
Master!
Fart the farts, the farts he farted
I pick my nose 'cause I'm retarded
Like El Duce says "smell my anal vapor"
And wipe my butt with your
Face!
"Toilet paper!" Yo, watch the beat!
I'm on your case, I'm in your face
Kick you and your father back in place
Step up sucker, understand
Don't you know,
I'm the man! I'm the man!
I'm bad! I'm so bad I should be in detention!
I'm the man!
Shut up!
So, as this rap is winding down
It's plain to see we wear the crown
You know Anthrax is number one
But we don't care, we just want to have
A festival!
"Fun" you stupid idiot!
We are the kings that all shout hell
We're like a diamond that is forever
And will remain the hardest ever
I'm so bad, it's a crimeCome alone horrid eyes
Bone from bone, sigh to sigh
In all dying there is a certain beauty
To travel the seas of temptation
And the velvet skies of pain
Sodomize the sacred in the velvet skies of pain
Lightning the fuse of death
We march towards the twilight
In apocalypse and pain
Never to see the light of day again
And when the birds of burning flesh return
Ye shall arise from the ashes, as Gods, and burn and burn...I'm walking along the river
Raindrops fall from the sky
The eagle above never wonders
'bout all the feelings gone by
The flower buds open their hearts
They're begging for water to fall
As they're starting to fill up my senses
I recognize them all
[Chorus]
Falling far beyond the horizon
Falling in my and your lane
Falling in fear as the ground comes near
They're falling in the rain
They're falling in the rain
Throstle in the tree can you hear me
Let me hear singing your tune
Stars in the sky let me be part
When we take a dance with the moon
Butterfly open your wings
Woodpecker answer my call
Walking in midst the silence
Where I hear the raindrops fall
[Chorus]
In silence they roam in the grass
In silence they drop on a stone
In masses they fall from heaven above
But when they fall they die alone
[Chorus]
